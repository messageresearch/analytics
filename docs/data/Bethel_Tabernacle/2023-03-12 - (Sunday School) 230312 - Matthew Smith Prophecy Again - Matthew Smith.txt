========================================

and uh we don't really have to turn there if you don't want to I got it here and I'm going to be kind of moving through it well actually no go ahead go ahead and put it up on the screen I'm going to go ahead and um and read uh the first 11 verses um and uh Matthew chapter 17 and verse 1 I'll just start reading y'all catch up it says after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them into a high mountain apart verse two and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou will let us make here three Tabernacles one for the one for Moses one for Elias while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him um continuing on uh and then the disciples and when the disciples heard it they fell in their face and were sore afraid um see uh um and Jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid and then when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus only and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying television to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said of them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things so um I wanted to in this and I'm going to be hopefully if I have the time I want to come back and pick up some of this later and so just one thing to keep in the back your back your minds when I was studying this out I noticed there's seems to be a fair number of parallels if we actually take this these 11 verses and look and compare them to Revelations chapter 10. I mean which I'm going to hope to do that a little bit later on but the one thing I want to catch for now is if you notice you know when when Moses and Elijah appear Peter's first instinct is a trinity Doctrine he's trying to build three Tabernacles and make three gods right and you know because of because of humanity is tends to do that um we tend to see the servants and the the means through that God works through and then try to deify the messenger instead of the message and what ends up happening and it's you know what I'm uh the problem is it's showing that any time you're trying to deify a prophet and say well this individual person is is not actually the message or the messenger this is actually the God and you're trying to worship a prophet it's the same Spirit as a trinity right it's the same thing and it ends up with a lot of the exact same pitfalls and and train wrecks that you get um you know you end up with with you know some sort of centralized control and and you end up with the nicolaitan attitude towards and crushing any sort of individual relationship with God because it's all funneled through some well we're you know the we are the the the the you know we have the prophet you know we have the the we are the central Authority and so um the and so then it you know it comes down it says so but as Peter's saying this while he's still speaking God corrects it right there it says no no not these people but this is my beloved Son hear ye him right the the servants are fine but you've got to keep your eyes on Christ um because you know after the cloud descends and it it you know they saw they saw Jesus only right so um oh man burning through my time quick um so I want to come down from there and and look at this uh in the sermon the masterpiece um I'm gonna I'm gonna probably have to skip a lot of this um so brother Brown This is the first sermon in which brother Branham tells the vision in which he sees the bride in preview right we're all familiar with the sermon he sees all the he sees the bride and then all the different churches come by and then the Church of America is in this horrible State um and and then he sees the bride again and you know she goes up right well um so I want to read some excerpts from that I don't think I have time to read the whole thing so he says um so this is the first time he's ever telling anybody this uh this vision um so he says I fell into a trance and when I did there was somebody with me I didn't see the person I was just it was just a voice and I looked and as I looked this way he said the birds the bride will come in view for preview and I looked coming to me and I seen the prettiest bunch of clean dressed women I ever seen in my life but each one of them looked like was dressed different they all had long hair longer sleeves and skirts and so forth young women they look kind of I'd say about maybe 20. um uh okay and he says um uh skip over this um and he said so then he goes into you know how he's he was an American and he saw the Church of America come by and how she was you know basically dressed with um he what he describes here almost like shredded newspaper and that's it just just vulgar and and lewd and just a complete disgrace and and all the you know all these different churches from around the world coming around and they're all just progressively worse um and uh which is interesting um because he started this he started this um by saying uh how he'd been in in New York Los Angeles um but the filthiest bunch of women I ever seen in my life was in Jeffersonville Indiana that's what he said um he said I'd never seen so much Guam and filth in my life as I've seen amongst them people and so it was him looking at this in his own Hometown feeling so just broken about how how you know sinful the people were in his own Hometown that that's when the lord gave him this vision and so here he is seeing so here he sees the Church of America come by completely um just just immoral and he um and so his heart's broken about this right and it says and I started to bow my head and he said wait the bride must come again and I looked and here they come again and they passed by sweet looking little ladies they was all looking right at me as they passed by I noticed each one was dressed different and one in the back had kind of a long hair hanging down and had it rolled around like this might have been German or something like that and I watched them and then they were starting to leave two or three of them in the back started to get out of step and I was just going to holler at them and they was trying to get back in Step again and I've seen them just um and the Visions Fade Out and changed for me so um so we have this this image of you know if you could imagine in your mind so the Bride Comes then all these progressively deteriorating churches and then the Bride Comes again and he says um and in the in the in the beginning paragraphs of this he's talking about how he never told anyone this and he wasn't even sure exactly what it what the interpretation of this Vision was and so then he comes down here and says now here's the interpretation thereof uh now remember I had just got through writing I hadn't finished I hadn't wrote these notes yet but in preaching this morning I came I caught what it was right in my sermon did you notice the church only came in view um uh it's true friends the heavenly father who writes the word um skip this uh did you notice the Bride come in view twice right so all the churches come and view once the Bride Comes in view twice the first seed and the second seed both of them exactly the same one and the reason they were dressed in different parts shall come from All Nations it'll make up the bride each one had long hair and no makeup and real pretty girls and they were watching me that represented the bride coming out of all the nations see each one represented a nation as they marched perfectly in line with the word um and then I have to watch her she'll get out of step with that word if I don't watch when she's passing by if she gets by maybe it'll be in my time when I'm over see when I'm finished or whatever it is watch they was getting back trying their best they was getting back they was getting in line because they was looking out somewhere else watching about that church that just went out into chaos um the front one's never the back ones just two or three of them was kind of stepped out a little bit to the right hand side and looked like was trying to get back in line as they went by they was just passing me oh far as the wall passed me and I was standing there um and then uh okay notice the church only came in view once each Nation the church but the Bride come in twice that's what it was now not knowing it um this morning okay so I want to kind of paint this little bit of a mental picture a little bit because I think this this Vision within this is some really good balanced teaching because so imagine he says when the bride's passing by she's looking at him the whole time she's passing by okay so she's walking by and she's you know walking by like this and y'all are the bride or brother Brandon you're just going like this right okay well once you get past him she has to move past the prophet she has to to go where she's going because he's you know just watching her she goes by if she goes back you know once she goes past him she can't keep keep looking or she's going to walk in a circle right she has to go and take she the prophet has to leave the scene or she'll get hung up on that right she'll never move past him and so on the one hand she has to move past but notice as soon as she does she ends up out of Step so now we have a problem right we have a problem in which you and we see this in the message today people don't want to move past the profit they've got their eyes on the prophet right and they end up walking in a circle or you have the people who are completely turned away from the prophet end up chasing a denomination right but notice the thing that kept her in line even when she didn't have her eyes on him was his voice that continued on right he called after her and his voice continued after him and that kept her in line This is and so this is um so it creates a balance right you uh see here and so then um picking up where it was uh talking about the bride again in the in the same quote says um all others never appeared no more they went out never to come back again but the bride came back because she is Alpha and Omega God the great sculptor has made him a masterpiece for it is a piece of his first masterpiece like he made in the Garden of Eden and took a piece from and made it another piece and that was Martin fell so going back to where we said you know with with the Elijah Ministry his the purpose of brother bran was to point back at the original church right it was his it was brother Brown's voice that kept the this when the bride came in View the second time it was brother she watched him when she came to you the second time not so much the first time right and so what is what it's indicating is that there's there's a first church and then brother Brandon's job is to keep us in line so that we could remain as the as the when the Bride Comes in View the second time right it's a it's a restoration of what came in the beginning and so in this this thought of that his voice continues after him um you know this this brought to my mind Revelations chapter 10. and so I'm gonna I'm gonna read that uh we'll start it at verse one um and it says and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was it were the Sun and his feet is pillars of fire which I you know thinking about what brother Donnie was preaching over the meetings talking about how you know every time there's a what God is trying to do in this age the devil is trying to mimic that um here you have the mighty Angel the rainbow about his head and in the same time you have the you know the rainbow Brigade marching through the churches right with their with their imitation um uh see and it um and he had his hand a little book um how much time I got not a lot so I'm going to skip some of this um uh her book and his right hand upon the seat he had left put upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice and um as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven Thunders out of their voices when seventh owners out of their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying to me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the scene upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear that him by live forever and ever who created the Heaven and the things uh created heaven and the things that therein are and the Earth and things that there and are and the Sea and the things which are therein and there should be time no longer um it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel okay when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spoken to me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said to him give me the book give me the little book and he's letting me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter and it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the hand of the Angel and ate it up and I was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said to me that must prophesy again before many people and Nations and tongues and Kings okay so um I want to focus in on in starting in in verse 10 or in verse seven um where it says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel right it's in are we in the days of the seventh angel in a sense yeah but the Angel's gone the Angel's off the scene but we are in the day of his voice right his voice has continued on um and you begin to sound and uh it is in that under that voice that the mysteries of all the mysteries of God are finished okay um and so it's and it uh comes down here and so John which I don't really have time to really get into because I have five minutes left um uh is is this type of the bride and so the bride after this you know as the seventh angel is sounding then has to go and prophesy herself right if if we're John and we have to prophesy again what does that really mean right because are we all Prophets right I mean Bibles is where prophets priests and kings but we're not bringing a new word right we're not we're not revealing some new mystery you know um but there's this there's one of my I think it's a beautiful quote it's from God's only provided place of worship um and it said but in the day when the son of man will be manifested revealed brought back the church together with the entire deity of God him amongst his people showing the same visible signs manifesting himself like he did at the beginning when he was manifested on Earth in a form of a prophet of a prophet God right he hyphenated it's hyphenated there it's a prophet God glory promised by Malachi 4. it says uh look Enoch was a Living Word of God of his age he was a prophet a prophet is God's reflector how many knows that the reflector doesn't reflect itself the reflector isn't the reflection there has to be something strike the reflector to make it reflect so a prophet is a chosen vessel of God that cannot reflect nothing at all but he's in direct line with that reflection God to reflect the image of Christ the word see nothing else can do it okay so here we have this image site mental picture here's a mirror it's a prophet there's the light the word God God is light strikes the the mirror of the prophet and then that Prophet directs that to the people and so we can look at the mirror and see the light of God shining off of that prop reflector prophet and say well that's God but it is but the mirror's not God the reflection is God right the prophet is not his message he is a reflector of the message and he without the reflector we wouldn't see the message and so it's important to have him right otherwise we'd be way out of Step but we also recognize that God is the actual thing that we're seeing here okay and to really turn our worship towards uh towards the The Giver of the light and then so he comes out and he says to reflect the image of Christ the word see nothing else can do it and then period you are a reflector that's the reason the prophet had to eat the book that's the reason he had to eat the scroll he had to reflect the word for that age you got it well okay this is John prophesying again right we're not bringing some new word we're just simply re-manifesting the same word that was in the beginning right the bride becomes a reflector that reflects the first church and so um you know everything that was everything that was there has to be again this is I mean I don't know maybe I know kind of growing up in the message a lot of times it's kind of like you you read you know hear about people talk about this and it's like okay well how does this help me put my pants on on Monday and go to work right like because it's all these Wonder these deep dark Mysteries and you know my wife always asked me what I'm if she knows I'm doing Sunday school or preaching whatever she always ask me what are you going to talk about and I try to tell her something and then I I you know kind of told her my notes last night she's like wow that kind of went over my head I said yeah okay fair enough well because you know it's well it's Mysteries and it's types and it's oh if you don't have a mind for it and you don't catch it okay great well so I told her all right look God is as complicated as you want him to be right it's one of the most beautiful things about God is as complicated as you want them to be if you want Mysteries there's mysteries for days you will spend your lifetime trying to get through it and never do it okay but he's as simple as you need him to be okay everything that I just said can be condensed into like a couple sentences which is God cares about you a whole lot and he cared so much about you that he engineered time and space to have someone on the earth who could explain all of this to you and that person's a prophet and that Prophet brought a message that would point you back to God who cares about you so much and that there's God care that prophet's message was to tell you that when the storms of life come there's a God who is deeply invested in your life and has power to help you that when you're sick there's healing when there's when there's trouble there's there's there's Comfort when there's all these things God is deeply there's not some it's not a fairy tale and it's not a Bible story you know people think oh well you know the Miracles were for the Bible days well when did the Bible stop being relevant um we're still in the Bible days um you know there's all of these things and so the way it helps you what the whole summation is is that there's there's a there isn't this big Chasm between you and God there isn't there's there's a there's a a God who cares about you so much that he gave you his everything that he is right there and and for whatever you might need and all those stories in the Bible about the the first church again when it says you know writing a book of Acts again after what would come in the last days I mean as there's an old saying um there's an old saying that goes well it's it's actually I think Stalin said this said uh a million deaths or a single death is a tragedy and a million deaths is a statistic because you can't really get your head around a million deaths because but you can get your head around one death right you can really empathize with one person but you can't really live with a million people it's too big I feel like we kind of have a similar kind of attitude when it's like Bible stories it's like oh there's all these stories in the Bible and okay well you know Jarius had a had a daughter and she died and Jesus came and rose from the dead or you know there's a crippled man who was by the wayside begging and Peter and John went by and you know said Silver and Gold Have I None and then he could walk and it's kind of clinical and and there's not a lot of well okay but The Man by the wayside begging had a family and he couldn't go to work for maybe 30 years and they starved and so when Peter and John Peter and when they when he got his healing there was a real human story there and a lot of the times we get so hung up in our individual problems and it's like oh well I have this sickness or I have this financial problem or I have a marriage problem or I have a whatever problem and it's hard to connect that to the almost like historical recounting of the Church of the book of Acts but it's the same God there and so when when it talks about they're going to write another book of Acts it means friend that sickness that's been crushing you for 30 years you don't have to actually deal with it anymore there is actually power on the earth to heal you there is actually power on the earth to go find that you know to to fix your wretched condition right whatever you know there's the amount of of Brokenness that people have in their lives that God is more than able to repair it's not I don't know it's it I just if I could if I could just convey anything because I'm really out of time and I gotta I gotta stop um it's that there's it's not the Mysteries are here again it's we can make it as academic and as complicated as we want to make it the if I could just condense it down to one thing it would be just understand that the love of God is so big it can condense all the mysteries of the universe down to a single thing is that Jesus loves you so much that he will fix anything that you need him to and that all of your problems can be can be healed so we'll we'll end it there and uh thanks for hopefully my rambling will have helped you a little bit
