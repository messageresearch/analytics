[0:28] 15 Joshua 24 14
[0:41] 15 24 Joshua 245 and 16 it
[0:48] says I'm sorry let's start at verse 14
[0:50] now therefore fear the lord and serve
[0:52] him in sincerity and in truth and put
[0:57] away the gods which your father served
[1:00] on the other side of the flood and in
[1:03] Egypt and serve ye the Lord and if it
[1:06] seem evil unto you to serve the Lord
[1:09] choose you this day whom ye will serve
[1:13] whether the gods which your father
[1:15] served that were on the other side of
[1:17] the flood or the gods of the amorites in
[1:20] whose land you dwell but as for me and
[1:23] my house we will serve the Lord amen
[1:28] we're going to take a title this morning
[1:30] on sincerity and Truth sincerity and
[1:33] truth let's just bow our hearts Heavenly
[1:35] Father we thank you for this day thank
[1:36] you for the reading of your word Lord we
[1:38] pray that you break the bread of life to
[1:40] us this morning and father in this Lord
[1:42] simple Sunday school lesson Lord that
[1:44] You' come down father father most
[1:46] importantly that you'd come and minister
[1:48] to us through father your word father be
[1:50] with Pastor father as he's preparing we
[1:53] love you now we just commit our hearts
[1:54] to you father in the name of Jesus
[1:56] Christ amen God bless you take your
[1:58] seats this morning
[2:02] Amen to set the scene here for the
[2:04] chapter that we just read there in
[2:07] Joshua this was Joshua's last
[2:11] declaration to the people of Israel it
[2:15] was uh it was his last sermon if you
[2:17] will to his congregation he gathered all
[2:20] the tribes of Israel together he
[2:22] gathered the elders and the judges and
[2:24] the officers together to hear what God
[2:28] and and the people were were there to
[2:29] hear what God had to say one last time
[2:32] through this faithful servant Joshua and
[2:36] as we read his words began to describe
[2:39] all the things if you go back and you
[2:41] read the whole chapter actually you
[2:43] start at chapter 23 we don't have time
[2:44] to get into it but if you go read
[2:46] chapters 23 and 24 his words began to
[2:49] describe all the things that the Lord
[2:51] had done for them from the days of
[2:53] Abraham all the way to the Escape at
[2:56] Egypt to the Red Sea Deliverance to the
[2:59] batt Battle of Jericho and all the way
[3:01] down into the most previous victory that
[3:03] God had led them into and then after all
[3:07] that he made this remark he made these
[3:09] remarks fear the lord and serve him in
[3:12] sincerity and in truth choose you this
[3:15] day whom you will serve and as a leader
[3:18] to say that you know whichever way you
[3:20] decide to go you know whether you decide
[3:22] to choose the the way of serving gods
[3:26] and Idols it doesn't matter as a leader
[3:28] he said as for me and for my house we
[3:31] are going to serve the Lord and that was
[3:34] a Leader's declaration Amen to say it
[3:37] doesn't matter what you do what I'm
[3:38] going to do is I'm going to serve the
[3:40] Lord and I want you to follow suit with
[3:42] me I want you to follow the word I'm
[3:44] saying amen and uh a few verses later it
[3:48] says he comes back and there's some back
[3:51] and forth between the Israelites and him
[3:53] and they kept saying you know we will
[3:55] we're going to serve the Lord we're we
[3:57] we we will and we're going to obey the
[3:59] words
[4:00] and so Joshua he made a covenant with
[4:03] them and it and set them a statute and
[4:06] an ordinance the Bible says so he put
[4:09] their their Covenant on this great Stone
[4:11] and it was to be a witness forever that
[4:15] Israel had made this oath to serve God
[4:19] and you know um back in verse 15 when
[4:22] when Joshua says in sincerity and truth
[4:26] I believe the Lord kind of was giving
[4:28] him some insight into what goes on into
[4:31] the hearts of his people you know
[4:33] sincerity is so important in our walk
[4:36] with Christ amen the Bible places a high
[4:39] value on it um and you know even so much
[4:43] to say that it came before truth we're
[4:46] going to get into that in just a second
[4:47] and we'll touch on it but it's important
[4:50] but the problem with sincerity alone is
[4:52] that it if it lacks its counterpart
[4:56] which is truth then it's dangerous amen
[5:00] some some of the most sincere people in
[5:02] the world have been deceived and led
[5:05] down a wrong path because truth wasn't
[5:09] involved in what they were sincere about
[5:12] amen you can go you can go read you know
[5:14] stories of even in this latest Century
[5:17] of of men who had gifts of leadership
[5:20] amen they had a gift of leadership but
[5:22] they LED these people down a path that
[5:25] was destructive amen and they the people
[5:27] that W went into their you know
[5:30] Clans and into their things they were
[5:32] sincere people but it lacked the truth
[5:35] and we're going to get into this in just
[5:37] a minute it didn't lack the whole truth
[5:39] amen it lacked it had 99% of the truth
[5:43] amen a lot of times
[5:44] 99.9% of what the serpent said to Eve
[5:48] was true there was just a sliver of
[5:50] falsehood you know and and it seems
[5:53] sometimes it can seem harmless you know
[5:55] but in that case and in our case it's
[5:58] between life and death um you know you
[6:01] think about Cain and Abel there in the
[6:03] Book of Genesis brother bham says this
[6:06] many times Cain was sincere in his heart
[6:09] amen when he provided the sacrifice on
[6:12] the altar he was completely sincere in
[6:14] what he was doing but that didn't make
[6:17] it right amen you know because if you go
[6:20] and read that Genesis chapter
[6:22] 4 uh Abel was a shepherd and Cain was a
[6:27] tiller of the ground and of the of the
[6:30] the the
[6:31] um you know Farm amen thank you and so
[6:36] what he was doing he was sincere in his
[6:38] heart and I want you to think about this
[6:40] for a moment his sincerity just as Sin
[6:45] was just as sincere as Abel was led his
[6:49] sincerity led to the first murder in the
[6:52] history of the world it led to provoke
[6:56] emotions called jealousy and rage things
[6:59] that previously weren't even known in
[7:02] the world because a man was trying to do
[7:04] a service to God without a revelation
[7:07] amen and imagine this it led to the
[7:09] first time in all of history that a
[7:12] mother had to grieve over her dead
[7:15] child and it led to the first time that
[7:18] a father had to grieve and to comfort
[7:20] his wife after blood was shed because of
[7:23] what because of a sincere heart amen so
[7:26] you got to be careful when in your in
[7:29] your service to God sincerity is
[7:31] important but it's got to have its
[7:34] counterpart truth amen it's so important
[7:37] you know and if you think about it what
[7:39] Satan does now in our modern society is
[7:42] exactly what he did back there in the
[7:45] Garden of Eden it's it's exactly what he
[7:47] did with Cain it may not look exactly
[7:49] the same you know culture changes things
[7:51] change his tactics don't change though
[7:53] they just become a little bit more
[7:55] crafty in the way that he does things
[7:58] amen it may not look the same as it did
[8:00] back
[8:02] there he attracts a modern Church world
[8:06] with the lure of sincerity amen a
[8:10] sincerity without the truth and the very
[8:13] same thing it was the very same thing
[8:15] that that it did in the times and and in
[8:17] the Book of Genesis it's exactly what
[8:19] he's doing in the church world the
[8:21] modern Church world today it it leads
[8:24] people to a form of Jesus and it's going
[8:26] to lead people to a form of Jesus a form
[8:29] that you can read in the Bible amen
[8:31] everybody has the ability to read the
[8:33] Bible it's a book everybody can read the
[8:35] book and see what the word say but it
[8:37] lacks the ability to have a true
[8:39] relationship with Jesus called Christ
[8:42] amen it lacks the ability to have a
[8:44] truth behind whatever sincere thing is
[8:47] in their
[8:48] heart and and you see that same that
[8:50] same Spirit just like Kane you know
[8:52] they'll have you know they'll have
[8:54] million dollar altars and buildings but
[8:58] you know but the most that they do in
[9:00] those places of worship is maybe repeat
[9:03] a prayer that doesn't go any higher than
[9:06] the ceiling amen it's the same thing
[9:08] that Cain did he had a beautiful altar
[9:11] with the nicest fruits and the nicest
[9:13] grains and you know wow it it was way
[9:17] more appealing than Abel's altar it it's
[9:19] way it seems almost more appealing to
[9:22] the to the Natural Eye you know and if
[9:24] you look at the sacrifice of Cain you
[9:27] know Abel's altar had had blood
[9:30] sacrificed on it blood splattered on it
[9:33] it took the life of something that was
[9:35] close to him you know he was a he was a
[9:37] shepherd and and his sheep meant
[9:40] something to him a true Shepherd their
[9:42] sheep means something to them amen so
[9:45] for in order for this to have taken
[9:47] place it meant that it was close to
[9:50] Abel's heart amen it meant that this
[9:53] sacrifice wasn't just you know taking
[9:55] something that he had you know laying in
[9:58] his house this this was something that
[10:00] was close to his heart and his soul amen
[10:03] and he had it because he had that
[10:05] Revelation amen his
[10:07] relationship with God meant more than
[10:12] the relationship that he had to those
[10:14] sheep although that was kind of
[10:15] everything to him God meant
[10:19] more and still in this day it's it's
[10:22] exactly what what God's what God
[10:25] requires it it requires life it requires
[10:28] the blood atoning in our life to cleanse
[10:31] us continually amen he's shed the blood
[10:34] thank the Lord he shed his blood so that
[10:36] he would be a constant continual atone
[10:40] atonement for our sins amen but it's got
[10:42] to come that way God's provided way
[10:45] can't come any other
[10:47] way and and you can't say that those
[10:49] people aren't sincere Amen in the church
[10:52] world I mean they these people the
[10:55] people that are in denominations and
[10:57] systems that believe with all their
[10:58] heart they know they believe some some
[11:00] of them may believe in in lighting a
[11:01] candle or burning an incense or
[11:03] repeating a prayer amen and and and
[11:07] that's what they believe that it takes
[11:08] to worship God and you know I you you
[11:11] meet them and they're the most some of
[11:13] the most sincere individuals that you
[11:15] ever meet I mean they're more sincere
[11:17] than than me sometimes amen they're more
[11:19] sincere than you sometimes if you're
[11:21] really honest amen they they could put
[11:22] us to shame and they truly think that
[11:25] they're worshiping God but it but it's
[11:27] contrary to what the Bible says is
[11:29] worship amen we are to worship Him in
[11:31] spirit and in truth amen and Jesus saith
[11:35] I am the way I am the truth the life no
[11:37] man cometh to me except unto the cometh
[11:40] unto the father but by me sometimes from
[11:44] you know the outside looking in it may
[11:47] look more appealing to go the way of
[11:50] Cain's sacrifice the way the natural the
[11:54] natural side of things it looks you know
[11:56] look at the appeal of Cain's sacrifice
[11:58] it looked amazing there was no mess
[12:00] there was no blood there was no death
[12:02] and and you know the anybody can look at
[12:04] that and say well that's a lot that's a
[12:06] lot fancier than this that's a lot nicer
[12:09] looking that's a lot more appealing but
[12:11] you've got to look past the surface of
[12:14] things because past the surface is where
[12:18] God is going to get into the life of
[12:20] Abel and although he was the first man
[12:22] to be murdered he was pleasing to God
[12:27] Amen Abel's offering like I said just it
[12:31] required something that was that was
[12:33] uncomfortable it required that death and
[12:35] spiritually it requires the same thing
[12:38] today it requires us to go further than
[12:42] some nice flowers or some repeating a
[12:44] prayer or going to church and those
[12:47] things are important I don't want to
[12:48] discredit those things and I don't want
[12:50] to discredit the people that do those
[12:52] things I don't think there's anything
[12:54] wrong with those things amen but it's
[12:56] not enough amen repeating something from
[12:58] the scripture isn't enough if it's not
[13:01] life to you if this word is just words
[13:04] if it's just something that you read in
[13:06] the morning and it doesn't become life a
[13:08] living reality to you then it's not
[13:10] enough amen it's got to be a
[13:14] reality brother Benham says in wisdom
[13:16] versus Faith 1962 he says just like the
[13:20] this Easter will be they'll spend
[13:21] millions of dollars Across the Nation to
[13:23] put some flowers on some altars altars
[13:26] wasn't made for flowers it's for
[13:27] sacrifice see it's just the same old
[13:30] Spirit of Cain that same see the same
[13:32] old old devil from Eden see what what
[13:35] happened Cain thought surely you know
[13:38] this man was sincere because it meant
[13:40] life or death to him and them people
[13:43] don't think they're Hypocrites amen
[13:45] don't think that those people are
[13:46] hypocritical in what they're doing
[13:48] they're sincere you say then they could
[13:50] be sincere and wrong sure a man can take
[13:54] arsenic sincerely thinking he's taking
[13:56] castor oil or something something else
[13:59] see sincere that don't do it it's truth
[14:02] not sincerity truth them women over
[14:05] there in Africa sacrificed their little
[14:07] babies to God the alligators are you
[14:10] that sincere no how many of them stand
[14:13] the Chinese and break their bones to
[14:14] Kitchen gods and how many of the M
[14:16] mahian uh mohammedans and up in there
[14:19] and the firew Walkers and put them
[14:21] things in there and hooks in their flesh
[14:23] hooks in their mouth sew their mouth up
[14:26] some of them put a stick and brother vam
[14:28] this isn't just here say brother bham
[14:29] went and he saw these things amen he
[14:31] witnessed this stuff and he got a he
[14:33] said I got a statue up there little
[14:35] figurine weigh sacrifices to God to
[14:37] think he'd go to heaven a priest puts a
[14:39] stick in his mouth wraps it around his
[14:41] head with a with a chain comes down puts
[14:43] his head behind him chains his feet he
[14:45] can't eat or drink or eat spit nothing
[14:48] till he dies you don't see you you won't
[14:51] see Christians making a sacrifice like
[14:53] that you won't even believe the truth
[14:55] the word see now Beauty he said surely
[14:59] God will receive I'm going to catch this
[15:01] in just a second now Beauty he said
[15:03] surely God will receive look how pretty
[15:06] my altar is see that same Spirit today
[15:09] of wisdom well if we build this
[15:11] denomination surely God will receive us
[15:14] he won't receive nothing but the word
[15:17] amen he won't receive nothing but the
[15:19] word and something he catches there is
[15:23] that it's it's subtle there at the end
[15:24] he says surely God will receive is that
[15:27] Pride can follow this attitude surely
[15:32] God will receive this sure look how
[15:34] pretty my altar is you know a sincere
[15:37] heart without the truth backing it up
[15:39] remember what we saw in Cain it it it
[15:42] breeds the wrong thing amen sure it
[15:45] looks nice from the outside but Proverbs
[15:47] 14 says just talk about Pride for a
[15:50] second there um there is a way that
[15:53] seeth right into a man but the end
[15:54] thereof are the ways of death and that
[15:57] bread hatred and anger and jealousy amen
[16:01] a sincere heart bred those things amen
[16:03] and out of those came what
[16:07] murder off from what the heart of a
[16:10] sincere and a beautiful
[16:14] sacrifice you know humility is uh
[16:18] humility is a necessity when you're
[16:20] approaching God there a couple
[16:21] scriptures here first Peter 56 humble
[16:24] yourselves therefore under the mighty
[16:25] hand of God that he may exalt you in due
[16:28] time James 4 chap uh
[16:33] 4:6 God resisteth the proud but giveth
[16:36] grace to the humble James 4:10 says
[16:39] humble yourselves in the sight of God
[16:40] and the Lord shall lift you up it can't
[16:42] be look at my sacrifice look at what I
[16:46] did for the Lord look at what I can do
[16:48] for the Lord look at our fine churches
[16:51] God resists that kind of attitude amen
[16:54] you know in my opening statement I had
[16:55] made a comment I wanted to touch on the
[16:58] the importance of true sincerity for a
[17:00] moment the prophet makes this statement
[17:03] and it's really important to look at
[17:05] both sides of the fence on this because
[17:08] I have the full quote if if you want it
[17:10] just let me know and I'll send it to you
[17:11] but this comes from the message getting
[17:13] in the spirit 1961 the prophet's talking
[17:17] about man-made systems and organizations
[17:19] and he says that's what we've tried to
[17:21] do for 2,000 years and Pentecostal
[17:23] people you're doing the same thing
[17:25] trying to pick him up by organization
[17:27] you'll never do it separate ating
[17:29] yourself from the other brothers you've
[17:31] got to come back and we got to be one I
[17:34] don't care if the man's wrong if he's
[17:36] wrong and sincere in your in his heart
[17:39] and you're right and your belief and
[17:42] wrong in the way that you're acting I'd
[17:44] rather be in his place than in
[17:47] yours that's right I'd rather be wrong
[17:51] in my Doctrine and right in my heart God
[17:54] will respect it more so if a man is
[17:56] wrong what of it help him he needs help
[17:59] love him if you can't love your enemy
[18:01] the same way as you love those who love
[18:04] you then you're no better off than the
[18:05] publicans that's right that's what the
[18:07] church failed to see I hope you get it
[18:09] tonight so God will brother ROM says God
[18:12] will respect it more the prophet said
[18:14] because he's got the right motive and
[18:16] he's got the right attitude the right
[18:18] Spirit behind it so if you're a little
[18:20] mixed up in your Doctrine that's okay
[18:22] now it's not okay to stay that way amen
[18:25] God leads you into all truth the spirit
[18:27] of truth will lead you into to all truth
[18:29] amen but it's okay because you've got
[18:31] the right Spirit and the right attitude
[18:34] behind it amen and God respects that
[18:36] more because he knows that you're
[18:38] malleable he knows that you if you the
[18:41] moment you hear it oh thank the Lord
[18:44] Lord thank you for correcting me amen
[18:47] but if you've got the other side of
[18:49] things if you've got the right Doctrine
[18:52] but the wrong attitude and the wrong
[18:55] spirit amen look at what that thing
[18:58] breathes
[18:59] it's not that it will be impossible With
[19:01] God all things are possible amen and I'm
[19:05] thankful for that but if there's Pride
[19:08] involved Pride goeth Before Destruction
[19:12] God resisteth the proud he gives grace
[19:15] to the humble and it's so it it's so
[19:19] vital to check our attitude to check our
[19:21] spirit to check your motive and your
[19:24] objective in doing things you could have
[19:26] the scriptures lined up you could have
[19:28] every quote lined up you could say bless
[19:31] God I've got this thing and you have the
[19:33] wrong attitude and it's wrong it's you
[19:35] have the wrong attitude about it amen
[19:37] but if you approach it with the right
[19:39] attitude amen then God can take that
[19:43] thing amen he can take whatever maybe
[19:45] wrong Doctrine or maybe whatever
[19:47] whatever you're doing maybe sincerely
[19:49] but you're doing wrong he can correct
[19:51] that
[19:52] amen glory to God and and and just to
[19:55] take a little turn this morning just got
[19:57] a few minutes here when it comes to to
[19:59] serving the lord and I said this it it's
[20:02] important to be malleable it's important
[20:04] to let God correct you and and let God
[20:06] provide Clarity in your life because
[20:09] what happens as men and as women as
[20:12] humans is that we can some sometimes we
[20:15] can get something in our hearts that we
[20:17] want to do and maybe it's a service
[20:19] maybe it's a service for the Lord maybe
[20:21] it's something we felt led to do or we
[20:24] felt led to say to someone and then we
[20:26] act upon it but sometimes just because
[20:29] we had an inclination to do something or
[20:31] to say a certain thing that doesn't
[20:34] necessarily mean that it was the that
[20:36] was what the Lord was looking
[20:38] for that's why it's critical at every
[20:42] juncture in your life every decision
[20:44] that we look at the word amen we look at
[20:48] what the word says about it first
[20:50] because human tendency is that if we do
[20:54] something that we think is right we'll
[20:57] convince ourselves to keep keep doing it
[20:59] but the more you do it that doesn't make
[21:01] it more right amen the more you do
[21:05] something wrong it doesn't make it more
[21:07] right you need to correct that thing and
[21:09] then God will make it right in your life
[21:11] amen I hope that's clear this morning
[21:13] the more you do it the more it doesn't
[21:15] it just produces the wrong thing and the
[21:17] more that you do it it can produce the
[21:19] wrong thing and then eventually you have
[21:21] got this Forest of things that you don't
[21:24] even know where it started well it
[21:25] started with a sincere heart maybe but
[21:28] it wasn't right with the
[21:30] word and and you know maybe just some
[21:34] natural examples you know if if you
[21:35] learned how to do something a certain
[21:37] way and you know you were taught how to
[21:40] do it the wrong way that can happen
[21:42] sometimes and now you've been doing it a
[21:45] long time it's still the wrong way to do
[21:47] it amen people can get comfortable in
[21:51] that you know especially religion you
[21:53] know they'll come comfortable in the way
[21:55] they worship God and comfortable in
[21:56] their Church attendance and comfortable
[21:58] in every aspect of their Christian walk
[22:00] I don't want to go down a list just
[22:01] comfortable in it and and Joshua knew
[22:03] that concept well he knew how important
[22:06] it was to check with God at every
[22:08] Crossroad because because why because he
[22:10] learned the hard way amen you remember
[22:12] aen and you remember the wedge that had
[22:14] gotten in the camp you remember the sin
[22:16] amen but he kept on going with God you
[22:19] know he said you're going to conquer
[22:21] every foe you're going to conquer every
[22:22] enemy so he sent out a few hundred men
[22:24] to go and fight this battle but there
[22:25] was sin in his Camp amen and he lost men
[22:29] wives lost husbands he lost brothers
[22:32] because he didn't check with God before
[22:35] a juncture a critical juncture in his
[22:37] life and he learned the hard way
[22:39] sometimes we have to learn the hard way
[22:41] sin had gotten in his Camp so when
[22:45] Joshua came to preach his last sermon he
[22:49] make sure to note to the Israelites he
[22:51] makees sure to note to this next
[22:53] Generation he says put away the strange
[22:56] Gods which are among you and and incline
[22:59] your heart unto the god of Israel you
[23:02] know he he recognized you know maybe the
[23:04] gods and the idols had made their way
[23:06] into the their Dwelling Places and into
[23:09] their heart and he said put those things
[23:12] away serve only Jehova and serve him
[23:15] with
[23:17] sincerity in your hearts and
[23:21] truth you know and as as people of God I
[23:24] believe it should be you know I believe
[23:26] it should be our heart's desire to
[23:28] follow the whole counsel of God I I want
[23:30] to have a sincere heart when I serve him
[23:32] I want to be I want to be more sincere
[23:34] you know brother Bram had that had that
[23:36] time you know the angel said you need to
[23:37] be more sincere I want to be more
[23:40] sincere amen but I don't want it to stop
[23:42] there I want the truth and I don't just
[23:45] want some portion of the truth that's
[23:47] going to take me 99% of the way I don't
[23:49] want a sincere walk with walk with the
[23:53] Lord that's going to be the wrong
[23:56] sacrifice amen I want to come God's
[23:58] provided way and I want the truth Amen
[24:00] to change my life because you can be
[24:03] sincere in your heart saints of God but
[24:06] you can be wrong in you can be wrong in
[24:09] the scripture and it takes the whole
[24:11] thing out of cater you watch that with
[24:13] Cain we watch that in that example it's
[24:14] so important to have a duality of both
[24:17] of those things amen because the truth
[24:21] is what sets us free glory to God and
[24:24] and and if you're wrong in something
[24:25] just remember God God is able I mean
[24:27] we're all wrong wrong in something we
[24:29] all we all got our we're all humans we
[24:31] all think we're right in what we do but
[24:33] God God is the one that's right in what
[24:35] he does amen and you just have to have
[24:37] the right attitude you know there was
[24:39] that example just this is the last last
[24:41] thing here there was that example of of
[24:43] a man by the name of Apollos Apollos in
[24:45] the book of Acts and the Bible said that
[24:48] he was instructed in the way of the Lord
[24:50] he was fervent in spirit and he spoke
[24:52] accurately the things of the Lord those
[24:54] are the things that that the Bible says
[24:56] about him but he was only teaching what
[24:59] he knew and that was the baptism of of
[25:02] John amen so when two individuals that
[25:05] did have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[25:08] repentance unto baptism through Jesus
[25:11] Christ heard that he was preaching these
[25:13] things aquill and Priscilla they took
[25:15] him aside they explained the things of
[25:18] of God the Bible says more accurately
[25:20] amen and what did he do he heed to what
[25:23] they said and it was he became a great
[25:27] uh help in the word working of the Lord
[25:29] he because he heeded to what he said
[25:30] sometimes it's just it was just a detail
[25:32] it was just a small deta an important
[25:34] detail amen it was important detail but
[25:37] it was a detail in his life that God had
[25:39] to correct he did and they took him away
[25:41] I love the way that they put it they
[25:42] took him away privately spoke him spoke
[25:45] to him the things of the Lord accurately
[25:47] and he accepted it amen no matter what
[25:50] the case and that God is able amen
[25:54] aren't you glad for that let's just bow
[25:55] our hearts this morning Heavenly Father
[25:57] we thank thank you for the the word Lord
[25:59] we thank you for your presence this
[26:00] morning we pray father for the worship
[26:02] Lord we pray that we can enter in Lord
[26:04] today in spirit and in truth we commit
[26:06] our hearts to you now in the name of
[26:08] Jesus Christ amen God bless you
