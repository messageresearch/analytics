[44:50] for a title
[44:53] i want to speak on
[44:55] inoculated power
[44:58] inoculated power
[45:01] inoculation is a placement of something
[45:03] that's going to grow or reproduce
[45:07] and is most commonly commonly used in
[45:10] respect
[45:11] in the introduction of a serum or a
[45:13] vaccine
[45:15] it's used on a human or an animal
[45:18] especially to produce or boost immunity
[45:22] to a specific disease
[45:25] it's to cause to become filled or
[45:29] saturated with a certain quality
[45:32] or principle
[45:34] in another word to be filled with the
[45:37] holy ghost
[45:38] that it saturates your very being
[45:42] hallelujah
[45:43] you're injected with the live virus
[45:46] that's what this is it's not weakened in
[45:49] a pure state it's in its pure state when
[45:51] you got a vaccine
[45:53] what they do they weaken the live virus
[45:55] and put it in you we're not weakened
[45:57] tonight we're not standing here under
[45:59] some weak word
[46:01] we have an inoculation power
[46:05] it's not being weakened by some
[46:06] denomination or some idea around this
[46:09] message
[46:10] come on
[46:11] it's not weakened by our so-called
[46:13] headquarters
[46:14] we have the pure unadulterated word of
[46:17] god
[46:18] you take someone who said it had a
[46:20] smallpox you inject him with the
[46:22] smallpox virus what's it do it builds up
[46:25] an immunity
[46:28] preach with me
[46:30] it builds up an immunity to fight
[46:32] against that disease or any disease
[46:36] it don't matter what disease inoculation
[46:38] is inserting something alive into your
[46:41] body
[46:42] just like getting a holy ghost it's
[46:45] something alive that god has placed in
[46:47] you to help you overcome every devil
[46:51] all right

[52:44] we've seen some awful diseases in this
[52:46] this world spanish flu coveted
[52:49] bubonic plague
[52:51] found this interesting
[52:53] in october of 1347
[52:56] a genevieve's fleet returned from the
[52:58] black sea carrying her cargo as a death
[53:00] sentence for europe
[53:02] by the time those ships landed in italy
[53:04] most of the sailors were dead
[53:07] the few who survived wish they hadn't
[53:10] fever wrecked their bodies
[53:12] festering bulls volcanoes on their skin
[53:17] i know something worse than this
[53:20] it's a sin curse on our human bodies
[53:23] authorities ordered the vessels out of
[53:25] the harbor
[53:26] but it was too late
[53:28] flea infested rats had already scampered
[53:31] down the ropes into the village and this
[53:33] bubonic dictator had begun her reload
[53:35] ruthless march across the continents
[53:38] it was thought to be contained in a
[53:40] harbor but the rat got out
[53:44] you can't contain the devil
[53:47] i'm going what no matter what they tried
[53:49] they could contain that disease because
[53:51] it got into rats
[53:53] you can't contain a devil you can't just
[53:55] put him up on a shelf and say
[53:58] okay dad will you get up in our closet
[54:00] you take these little little short skirt
[54:02] up there
[54:03] put it up on little shorts put it up on
[54:05] the shelf
[54:08] it's there you know it's there you know
[54:10] it's like when i was a young person
[54:13] we had walkmans
[54:16] man if things were they were it
[54:19] and if you want to listen to the music
[54:21] you just carry a big old case around
[54:22] with all your tapes in it
[54:25] i've seen it done i've seen people take
[54:27] those lord moved for them i've seen them
[54:29] put them in the closet
[54:31] only to bring them out
[54:35] guilty
[54:37] but one day
[54:39] those things were thrown out and
[54:41] destroyed
[54:42] you've got to destroy it take your
[54:44] little short skirts use shorts or
[54:46] whatever whatever it is that bothers you
[54:49] burn it
[54:51] you can't contain it quarantine the
[54:53] devil
[54:55] throw the cane on him
[54:57] hallelujah
[54:59] word in the world
[55:03] you got a stomp on him sarah don't like
[55:06] this story but i like telling it
[55:12] when we first got married we lived in a
[55:15] trailer out in the country well i come
[55:17] home from work one day
[55:18] and i seen her over there in the kitchen
[55:21] and she had a broom handle
[55:24] i said what in the world are you doing
[55:26] there was a rat
[55:28] in the kitchen
[55:30] she was and it was
[55:34] that's what the devil does to us
[55:37] he'll come before you
[55:40] he'll try to scare you to death
[55:44] but
[55:45] what she did when she kept poking that
[55:47] thing i think finally grabbed a hold of
[55:48] it
[55:50] she took it outside
[55:52] and started beating that rat's brains
[55:54] out
[55:55] on the porch
[55:57] if you've got a devil to not bother you
[56:01] take the word
[56:04] beat his brains out
[56:07] hallelujah
[56:08] oh
[56:10] you know what you do with rats you set
[56:12] traps for them
[56:14] set out traps you got to get rid of the
[56:16] rats
[56:17] you got to make your home rap free
[56:20] you got to make your home devil free
[56:23] whatever that devil wants to bring in
[56:25] it's time to kick him out
[56:27] you got to destroy the rats
[56:30] you set out poison for them right that's
[56:32] the way you kill them
[56:34] we got a poison for the rat the devil
[56:37] it's the blood of jesus christ
[56:41] it's death to the devil but it's life to
[56:43] the believer
[56:45] hallelujah
[56:46] set out traps for him
[56:48] but instead he sets out traps for us
[56:54] this is one of my favorite statements i
[56:56] stole it from somebody
[56:58] i might already said it here once before
[57:01] if the devil
[57:02] is not under your feet
[57:05] he's out of place
[57:09] is he under your feet tonight
[57:12] he's undermined
[57:14] the greatest disease
[57:16] bigger than his black death was sin
[57:19] sin can hit and wipe you out before you
[57:21] realize what's hit you
[57:23] asked adam and eve in a garden
[57:26] that's what happened there
[57:28] satan started coming up and whispered in
[57:30] her ear
[57:32] what did god say
[57:34] spill the tea sis
[57:38] tell me what god said
[57:42] when sin hits you unless you're gonna
[57:44] change the soul to get inoculated it's
[57:46] death to you
[57:47] that's what happened in the garden of
[57:49] eden it was death to them
[57:52] god seen them
[57:54] he said i can't leave you like this
[57:57] he says
[57:58] i'm gonna go to my laboratory and i'm
[58:00] gonna start working on a cure
[58:04] i'm gonna start working on a cure for
[58:06] sin
[58:08] first thing he did he just throw
[58:09] lambskins on them
[58:11] with that blood
[58:13] they walked out of the garden
[58:14] the blood of bulls and goats was what
[58:17] the old testament needs but that
[58:18] couldn't take away sin
[58:20] that wasn't a cure
[58:22] god started working on his laboratory
[58:25] oh hallelujah he gave moses the blood of
[58:28] bulls and goats
[58:31] you know when a man starts to find a
[58:33] vaccine to cure sin they start small
[58:36] they don't find a cure after the first
[58:38] time
[58:39] it took a while to find the cure just
[58:41] like god he started out with the blood
[58:43] of bulls and ghosts they didn't
[58:44] eradicate sin
[58:45] it was just for covering
[58:47] it wasn't a cure because they had to
[58:49] come back to offer another one for the
[58:51] sins they committed after the first time
[58:54] year after year they had to come back
[58:55] and repent
[58:56] for what they have already what sins
[58:58] they committed that year
[59:00] god worked at his laboratory to find a
[59:02] cure for sin
[59:04] god eventually says
[59:06] i found it
[59:08] next thing you know you hear you hear a
[59:10] prophet speaking behold a virgin shall
[59:13] conceive
[59:16] hallelujah
[59:18] he said i've got to come down myself
[59:21] i've got to take up a flesh body i got
[59:23] to take a body to live in
[59:26] i must be led to the slaughter like a
[59:29] lamb
[59:30] i've got to be crucified
[59:32] for you
[59:34] that's the cure that's the only way it
[59:36] can eradicate sin
[59:38] oh brother
[59:39] he says i got to give my life for
[59:41] sacrifice
[59:42] that'll not only cover sin it'll
[59:44] eradicate it
[59:46] i'll tell it a minute i'll definitely
[59:47] eradicate it here a little bit
[59:49] what we need was a blood from a pure
[59:52] unadulterated blood
[59:54] of jesus christ
[59:56] doctors and scientists that's what they
[59:57] started using guinea pigs
[59:59] or little rats to test out their vaccine
[1:00:02] to see if it works for us first
[1:00:04] that's scary
[1:00:06] before they try it on human beings
[1:00:08] they'll make sure it works first they
[1:00:09] take the rat or water animal they use it
[1:00:11] eject it with a virus and then put the
[1:00:13] inoculation to see if it's effective to
[1:00:16] see what it what about the side effects
[1:00:17] of it
[1:00:19] i tell you
[1:00:20] god's so sure of his
[1:00:23] he vaccinated himself
[1:00:25] hallelujah brother branson said jesus
[1:00:27] christ the son of god when he was born
[1:00:31] some of them says well now he was the
[1:00:32] egg of mary
[1:00:34] god the creator overshadowed the virgin
[1:00:37] mary and created the cells within her
[1:00:40] womb and brought forth a man
[1:00:43] which was emmanuel god himself made
[1:00:46] flesh
[1:00:47] with
[1:00:48] with no help from anybody
[1:00:52] he's the creator who made the first man
[1:00:54] oh my there he is there he stands
[1:00:57] and then he did that so he could take
[1:01:00] the inoculation went down to the river
[1:01:03] john baptized him brought him up the
[1:01:06] holy ghost fell up on top of him
[1:01:09] went into the wilderness to be tempted
[1:01:10] of the devil
[1:01:12] 40 days
[1:01:13] to show the devil that this thing is
[1:01:15] real
[1:01:17] show the devil that he had the
[1:01:18] inoculation power to overcome everything
[1:01:21] he throwed at him to show you what you
[1:01:23] can have tonight
[1:01:25] to get inoculated you have power
[1:01:30] do you realize what kind of power you
[1:01:32] have
[1:01:35] you don't
[1:01:36] because if you got sickness you'd speak
[1:01:38] to it
[1:01:40] in the name of jesus sickness leave
[1:01:43] in the name of jesus disease leave
[1:01:46] in the name of jesus every demon flees
[1:01:50] hallelujah
[1:01:55] he come down and walked on this earth a
[1:01:57] perfect man
[1:01:58] went to the rarely baptized by john god
[1:02:00] inoculating himself
[1:02:02] at the river went up to the world to be
[1:02:04] kept of the devil he came down off of
[1:02:06] that mountain victorious
[1:02:08] he showed that the inoculation held he
[1:02:11] went to the garden of gethsemane
[1:02:13] great drops of blood and sweat
[1:02:16] in agony
[1:02:19] if it be your will let this cut past for
[1:02:21] me the vaccine held
[1:02:23] he went to pilas hall took the whips the
[1:02:26] vaccine held

[1:02:57] race

[1:03:01] something to keep me in times of
[1:03:02] temptation

[1:04:27] that's going to get us out of this world
[1:04:28] and take us in a rapture
[1:04:31] but we refuse it
[1:04:34] definition of a remedy
[1:04:38] a medicine an application or treatment
[1:04:40] that relieves or cures a disease
[1:04:43] i just put the bomb
[1:04:44] the holy ghost
[1:04:46] it corrects or counteracts
[1:04:50] to cure
[1:04:51] relieve
[1:04:52] or heal
[1:04:55] i like this one
[1:04:57] to restore to the natural
[1:05:00] or proper condition
[1:05:03] there's the ticket back
[1:05:05] he's going to restore you back to where
[1:05:07] you were before the foundation of the
[1:05:09] world

[1:05:15] back to where there was no sin
[1:05:17] back to where there was no devil
[1:05:19] this is a remedy for the new birth the
[1:05:22] new birth is so it's no different from
[1:05:24] any other birth
[1:05:25] it's a mess
[1:05:28] sorry sister
[1:05:32] and every once in a while when it comes
[1:05:34] up on me
[1:05:35] i'll get messy
[1:05:37] again with it i'll cry i'll boohoo and
[1:05:40] carry on i guess i don't look very good
[1:05:44] i'm not very good to look at i've got
[1:05:46] something down on the inside
[1:05:48] of me that's taken me on and on and on
[1:05:52] and on he's not stuck and on
[1:05:56] it'll take you to eternity
[1:05:58] hallelujah that's what that inoculation
[1:06:00] power will do for you
[1:06:02] hallelujah
[1:06:06] people refuse it
[1:06:08] they don't like the thoughts of being
[1:06:09] born again
[1:06:11] and some of these modern teachers teach
[1:06:12] the new birth is to walk up and take
[1:06:15] fellowship with the church that's the
[1:06:17] new birth
[1:06:18] they're wrong
[1:06:20] all you gotta do is join our camp
[1:06:22] join this camp
[1:06:28] oh
[1:06:30] lord or should i say all you have to do
[1:06:33] is come to our stillwater camp
[1:06:38] all they're produced is stillborn babies
[1:06:41] there's no power of inoculation
[1:06:43] inoculating our young people to face the
[1:06:45] devil
[1:06:47] to get them out of this world
[1:06:49] oh it's a mess a new birth is a mess
[1:06:51] there's no difference
[1:06:53] when a man's born again it makes him do
[1:06:55] things he wouldn't think he's going to
[1:06:56] do
[1:06:58] it makes you squall it'll make you
[1:07:00] boohoo and carry on
[1:07:02] it might make you do things you think
[1:07:04] you would ever do but it brings new life

[1:07:40] steps if a doctor has a remedy for the
[1:07:43] disease
[1:07:47] the man just sits on a step but refuses
[1:07:49] to take the remedy

[1:09:01] thinks he's too good to take the
[1:09:02] medicine of the holy ghost
[1:09:04] i hope he don't ever think we're too
[1:09:05] good tonight
[1:09:08] if the lord wants me to get up and run
[1:09:09] down that aisle i want to be willing to
[1:09:12] do it

[1:10:36] sugar and water
[1:10:37] he started laughing
[1:10:39] i said you don't want me to feel better
[1:10:42] but he wanted what some people gets a
[1:10:44] placebo effect and they think they've
[1:10:45] got it because sometimes it does work
[1:10:47] with your mind i've heard it it worked
[1:10:49] with your mind you make you you are
[1:10:50] feeling better and that's what happens
[1:10:52] to some people in the church

[1:11:28] you'll be kind of mad wouldn't you
[1:11:30] he said doc i come in for the flu shot
[1:11:33] you're giving me nothing
[1:11:35] we go a lot of places there but we won't
[1:11:39] placebo effect people are getting a
[1:11:41] simple effect in church
[1:11:44] what we thought we had our real holy
[1:11:46] ghost
[1:11:47] we didn't

[1:12:19] to the soul
[1:12:22] that's where you get your power that's
[1:12:24] where you get your overcoming power
[1:12:27] oh why don't we sit in church and feel
[1:12:28] the power of god moving around i'm
[1:12:30] falling on some people

[1:13:57] peter and to the rest of the apostles
[1:14:05] men and brethren what shall we do
[1:14:07] and then peter said unto them
[1:14:09] repent
[1:14:11] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:14:14] name of jesus christ for the remissions
[1:14:16] of sins
