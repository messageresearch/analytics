couldn't pay it like brother Dale says we were busted disgusted and couldn't be trusted He Paid a Debt he didn't know it the contradiction of Christ you know the contradiction of Sinners against himself was staggering that God would take a completely innocent person convict him as a sinner send him to hell that's what brother Bram said he never committed a sin but he became sin took your sin and God judged him brother brandom said as a sinner and sent him to Hell friends you and I never have to go there because of that and God traded the completely innocent for the totally guilty now how many convicts I got in here tonight oh come on come on every one of you you were born a convict praise the name of the Lord well we're going to find out how we got out of it tonight Romans chapter 5 preach in the name of the Lord we're going to go right into the word of God making a last addition that I just had a prayer request come in if you're streaming and uh you want to get one in just send it to me I'll make one more look before it's all said and done try to make I got a wonderful testimony from Brother Matt to today okay I got that brother Luther so um wonderful testimony from Brother Matt and I'll give it to you in a little bit it's it's tremendous you're gonna have to wait amen praise the Lord so not only about uh what the Lord is doing there but uh wonderful grace of God for brother Jason and U and there was a another situation there with a a young girl very in very bad sit situation and the Lord just came on the scene in an amazing way Romans chap 5 we're going to take part 15 tonight y'all ready for that amen how many more parts brother Jason let's um amen let's begin now of course Romans 5 is where you know Paul's talking about where we're justified by the blood of Christ aren't you glad for that amen that's what brother Tony was singing about amen Paid a Debt that I couldn't pay so verse n much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him that's almost enough to shout and go home for if now catch this if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by death by the death of his son now notice he didn't say you you got reconciled when you repented at an altar you're reconciled in Christ 2,000 years ago see watch all right for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement so there's a lot a lot a lot of joy to be had in the knowledge of the atonement we're going to be preaching along those lines tonight verse 12 wherefore as by one man sin had entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no law nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgressions who is the figure of him that was to come but not is the offense so also is the free gift for if through the offense of one many be dead which is true much more the grace of God and the gift by Grace which is by one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many and not as it was by one that sins so is the gift for the Judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offenses under justification for If by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ therefore as by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men under justification of life for as by one man's Disobedience many were made made Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous moreover the law entered that the offense might abound but where sin abounded thank God grace did much more abound that as Sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace Reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord let's pray father we thank you for your word Lord we read it it's almost too good to be true at times Lord we stand here tonight so aware of that and as I've pondered Lord this material for weeks now Lord and all throughout the day today particularly Lord focusing on it over and over and over again Lord I would read across it and just try to comprehend what it is you have done for us Lord it it defies all expectation we who had a right to expect nothing but death and destruction Lord and somehow someway through some Supernatural otherworldly power we find ourselves on the way to heaven Lord it just seems astonishing to us and I pray tonight if I'm able to accomplish anything at all Lord it will be to astonish the people Lord you can you can you can it was said to me once by a foreigner she said it quite sincerely not trying to insult me she said you cannot Amaze Americans by anything but Lord may we be amazed tonight may we be astonished father at what you have done for us I commit myself into your hands for service to this end in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated Hallelujah amen praise the Lord several other requests that came in I'll get to those just in a minute just to preach to you a little bit amen now the last time we were preaching along part 14 was Sunday or the Sunday previous I should say and we were trying to get you to understand how that when brother Brandon would say that the bride is ordained to not fall and that she is predestinated to stand and we were making the point that not only is she predestinated to stand but she's predestinated to stand victoriously and you know sometimes if we're If we're honest we don't always feel super Victorious you say well what happened to the predestination of God what happened I thought I was ordained to not fall why do I constantly seem to stumble and slip up I thought am I not ordained you know was either was brother bradam wrong or am I not in that number and I want to tell you that neither of those are true there's something else that we were trying to get you to understand what it's based on and that is I want to come tonight to the second half of what it's based on now give me my PowerPoint uh brother Josh want to uh look straight into some quotes that I did not put up last time we we put them up this time and I want to go over them and read them for you and have you read them along with me because we want to just review quick ly what the first half was and to cut to the chase the first half as you're going to remember from a couple of Sundays ago is that that you're you're ordained to to not fall because the seed that you're feeding on is not doesn't have fall in it and every seed brings forth of its kind and so when you eat the book you're becoming the book when you eat the seed of the word of God you become the word of God and your mistakes and your let me just keep with that word because that's the word brother bradam uses your mistakes not withstanding nothing changes what God has determined about his family so that was the first part we were really laboring to show you in the word of God why brother Brandon would say she's ordained to not fall she's predestinated to stand there see and it's not because you're we're we're all the time super people but it's God has declared it by his word and that seed that you're feeding on is the same genetic material of the gene of God that's in you which is the same genetic material that the Bible is made out of which is the same genetic material that the Holy Ghost is which is the same genetic material IAL that your new body will be so we're not talking about that we became children of God we only found out we always had been and the life of the Holy Ghost is you cooperating in the vision you don't always get it right but the vision don't change am amen see so now watch and I'm going to read through these quickly because we've already covered them and I don't want to spend more than about 10 minutes in rehearsal so brother brandham we're talking about seeds coming forth so brother Brandon makes this statement he says and everything this is after the Garden of Eden this is on the seventh day God has rested everything under control to bring forth of its kind now remember when he put the seed in the Earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from seed to a plant listen friends regardless of your weakness and regardless of the devil's tyranny you can't not be a believer there is something inside you that shouts amen even when your when your human mind says but I'm not meeting the great and I just I'm unworthy and I I I don't have the goods it's not it's not anything you've done it's this is something God has determined before the foundation of the world so he says the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it I love that statement to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was so you were going to get transformed from a sinner to a saint you were that was it that was a done deal the day you were born amen his transforming power because you became a good guy no because of his transforming power because I can because I'm super a super strong Christian no because of his transforming power see no God put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said it would be as long as it stayed in its right category it would be exactly what God said it would be this is why I've said that that your mission agents should you choose to accept don't worry I'm not going to self-destruct your mission should you choose to AC to accept is to line up your life in the line and Order of God's word and the seed will take care of itself you don't even have to chase God's will you don't have to worry about you don't have to wonder about it you just line up your life and you say well I'm trying to do that I don't always get it right well then try again and keep trying and just keep trying because it's not wins and losses it's the fight he's looking for it's faith in your heart brother brandom said it what you want to be I want to be quite a bit quite a bit more than I find myself to be it had to be that way because he had made it that way and made a channel see God's word once he does once he does it he can't ever change his mind you can't say he had a bad idea when he gave you a gene of God see so that anything that stays in his channel in his line of word it will have to bring forth exactly like his word said it would do it cannot move from there it's Channel just exactly right so with everything and Trust in his own son that it be that way then God said it's all good so I'll just rest and each and each of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the speci that I desired it to be please stop doubting God because of your weaknesses say Amen to every word God said you're an overcomer then say it so I don't feel like a Christian let the weak say I'm strong say I I want the Holy Ghost brother said then say you've got it and just believe it and then you'll have it because faith comes by hearing and then by our by the confession of our lips that's where you hear recognize and act upon the word of God so we got to put the devil to silence friends put him to silence in your life stop letting him accuse and harass you because of your human frailties because you got a ton of them see all right this is rigged election so just enjoy it so he says that's what it must be because I have given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in its potentials now to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be he goes to the church age book whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed now this is exactly why we had to have a message because we had to have we had to get back to the original seed why would we need to get back to the original seed cuz we are Original Seed and we're predestined to go in a Rapture but since faith comes by hearing how's he going to get this seed in a Rapture he's going to bring back a word with the same genetic makeup as the gene inside you and the same Holy Spirit this brother brandham said this is the spirit in word form see so it's it's working this way regardless of whether the devil likes it or not now I'm I'm glad that it that it that it causes us to strain at it it does does me when I think of my own frailties and I say this is too rigged this is too stacked this is too unfair but you have to understand that when he sits on his throne and you're sitting there with him he's not going to entertain a an objection from Lucifer you understand so his his word is so case closed that even on that day when you read in the Bible that Lucifer is brought before him Lucifer does not try to raise a railing accusation against the family Seated on the throne he tried that in Zachariah and the Lord told him don't ever do that again get out of get out of here and don't ever accuse my family of that again it's all based on God's choosing say I chose to be Christian you did not you only chose to surrender you were already a child of God see all right whatever seed started the church so see this is why we had to have a message of restoration it will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it's the same seed in these last days the true bride Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone and she will be the Super Church a super race as she nears him they and the bride will be so much like him they will be in his very image this is non-negotiable this is not going to happen if you agree that it's going to happen this is going to happen see and so your best course is to start lining your life up with the word of God so that you're agreeing with the vision because it gets rough if you don't do that but you're ordained to do that amen there's plenty of Believers in here tonight who could raise their hand and say you know God brought me through a lot of my own rebellion and I really paid a heavy price that I wish I would have never had to pay amen how many old sinners we got in here that will say that say my goodness I I paid a heavy price why wouldn't he just leave me alone that's not that's not an option see every seed that the father gave him is coming all right he goes on there is in order this is in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations cannot produce this and this is such a sensible answer why can denominations of good people not produce this because it's an ad mixture it's a Mongol seed it's a it's got truth and error and that could never produce a Rapture that could never produce a body change that's impossible understand it it's got to come back to the original word that Paul swed for the the Christian Church it cannot deviate from that in any way shape or form so it doesn't matter that that I mean if churches want to survive why has the church nominal compromised with the political and social agendas of the world es especially starting in the 20th century and that's where you begin to see the the falling away of old-fashioned standards of Holiness that had been standards for 20 centuries and suddenly people want to say well you're misin spurge did did Matthew Henry did John Wesley these men with Brilliant Minds did they misinterpret it also see so so I mean I was I was looking at some notes from Spurgeon and he's talking about how that that there has to be an unfeigned obedience to Doctrine that's his words there has to be obedience to Doctrine not hearing only but doing and it has to be from the heart that's Charles Spurgeon from a couple hundred years ago so so this idea today that well you know it's just the grace of God and it doesn't matter that we don't keep anything what doesn't now and now in one sense that's true but that's only true for the elect lady and that only becomes true for her when she's born again of the spirit of God then then there is no condemnation possible to her but you have to be born again and how do you get born again you have to be able to agree and amen to every word of God see so that's what brings that's what entitles you to the Token that's what entitles you to the New Birth so so he says here this is in order to unite with them they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations cannot produce this it's not that they're not good people it's that that's wrong seed they will produce their Creeds and their dogmas mixed with the word this mon rizing brings forth a hybrid hybrid product that's a law of nature inescapable see that's not something William brandham is inventing that's a law of nature a hybrid seed brings forth a hybrid product an original seed brings forth an original product the original word brings forth an original Christian you understand all right so so this is where we were we were showing um on couple of Sundays ago that when a prophet says she's predestinated not to fall and I gave you this example it's the here's the first side of it it's the same as as if I said uh that I will plant a wheat seed and it is ordained to not be corn because it can't be because I planted wheat see so that's the law of nature so so predestinated not to fall is a seed that is destined to grow to its intended crop and this is we we dealt with that and I I don't want to just keep backgrounding but this is exactly why we had the opening of the seals to bring forth a birth of a of a bride that would go in the Rapture not not even the years of background it it it's really comes with the opening of the seals now brother Bram was a prophet all through his life so we're we got plenty of quotes we quote from before seals in the seals after the seals it doesn't matter we we anytime he had anything that prior to the seals that he was uh needed further Clarity on the angel of the lord gave it to him and he brought it to us amen so so we find out then that that we made the point how that the same way that the false prophet literally prophesies people into the tribulation is the process the same process only in the other direction why the word of God preaches you right into a Rapture he literally prophesies them into a tribulation and God sends a true Prophet not the false prophet a true Prophet to prophesy you into a Rapture so so it's it's it's just beautiful in that way so brother brandham we we talked about there in Christ's mystery God revealed and he Christ manifested in his church all together to bring back the original Adam and Eve again man and woman let me let me darken that for a minute because I don't have that on the on the board and so this is where he makes that tremendous statement so it's man and woman which are one made out of the same blood and the same spirit and everything else and this is why he would say that profound statement the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit see so and you say why because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptizes us into his body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word that's a part of see and and so so when he says she's it's predestinated the church to that great glorious stand and that was what was thrilling my heart a couple of Sundays ago that we're not just I I love that song it's probably one of my favorite worship songs brother Anthony was singing I'm gonna make it he's already said that I would but I I I I love the fact that when I think about that I'm going to make it I have no plans to have to crawl or creep or roll over the Finish Line I'm going to run across the Finish Line that's my plan what's your plan I plan to be running until he calls us home see so he says this is what denominations won't touch they'll never touch that because it's the Revelation so the first reason the first reason that she will that she is predestinated to not fall we said to you last time is the exact same reason why denominations can't touch it because they don't have the pure seed word they operate on seeds of discrepancy see and so it bars them from receiving the new birth now and I and I this was one of the last statements I made and I thought to myself but this gives me courage when I said it two weeks ago and it gives me courage to repeat it tonight that just just as receiving Life In The Blood and having that token on display of the word of God the the same the same requirement that that that that literally that seat of discrepancy they're preaching literally brings them into a tribulation the the word you believe literally takes you in a Rapture and and in fact is it's so beautiful because it it literally bars them their seat of discrepancy bars them from going in the Rapture see and but your pure seed bars you from going into the tribulation say I might go impossible to go the seed Gene of God bars you from going into the tribulation see so this is exactly why because when you pass from Death to life you can never come into the Judgment as John said in St John 5 Paul said in Romans 8 there's now there's therefore now no condemnation to them which you're in Christ now who walk not after the flesh but who walk after the spirit in other words who's been born again now secondly all right so enough backgrounding that was the what we were really emphasizing La couple of Sundays ago that that's why you go in the Rapture that's why they can't go in the Rapture that's why they go in the tribulation and why you can't go into the tribulation secondly here's the other side of of it brother Brandon talks about it like this so he says she knows it so did Eve know it but she fell but this one knows it and won't fall she is ordained Hallelujah she is ordained to not fall see so not only are you feeding on the right seed but we have found out you are the right seed amen you're not just feeding on the right seed you are the right seed there has been people who fed on this seed who then fell away from this seed but the but the real seed cannot fall away from the Original Seed see so so he says she won't fall she is predestinated to it now you ready for the scripture he's going to give you the second half she won't fall she is predestinated to it and he quotes the psalmist David blessed is the man who God will not impute sin and he says you ministers know what I'm speaking of when there's a couple dozen of you sitting here blessed is the man whom God will not impute sin so what we are discovering is that sometimes in the in the our Our Miss is to prove this word true but come on let's just look at each other in the eye and admit to the fact that sometimes we don't do a good job of that sometimes we fail to do that sometimes we stumble but I know that the image of me in heaven hasn't stumbled there is an image of you here there's an image of you already in heaven and this image stumbles that image not only doesn't and never has and never will see I know that my image in heaven has not stumbled neither has it been altered so when the Lord taught us to pray and I've preached on this before when the Lord taught us to pray part of our daily dying and dedication and repentance should be Lord thy kingdom come thy will be done in this earth as the in heaven see and so make me look like make me this is my prayer Lord make me look like I already do in that Kingdom move uh move on my desires to press for that Kingdom that's a prayer you should pray Lord move on my desires bring a supernatural power upon my desires that I want to press for that image image see let me reorganize all my priorities let me change my aims let me let me think about my life now here's where it comes down to brass tacks and nuts and bolts of our life Lord let me because it's not just a free ride let me let me organize my life so that I'm in the line and Order of God's word so that this image for goodness sake please let this image look close to that one I'm glad there's that one but I'd very much like to look like that one and that's a desire of a real Christian see so when you when you really preach it like Paul preached it the natural human tendency quite natural is to say wow then it doesn't even matter I can just do whatever I want to do do you know what now that and that not argument is not new it's not novel in any way they were arguing that in Paul's day Paul saidwell you know you're going to say to me Paul well then let if if if my sinning and him forgiving me and cleansing me and saving me gives him glory then let me sin more so I can give him more glory and Paul said you're a fool for thinking like that this isn't about that see Paul wasn't worried because Paul knew that heathens and sinners are going to abuse that they're going to have a easy believer ISM they're going to have a false Grace but they ignore the fact that the Bible says that Grace teaches us to deny ungodliness nobody none of them want to quote that one oh it's just his grace but Grace teaches us to deny ungodliness that's the grace that before as as as as as I I was reading spurgeon's notes as Spurgeon said before I was I I I forget exactly the the the two different words he used I was abstained I I couldn't love him but now by his grace I can't not love him before I had a mind enmity against God and now I love God and I can't love the world anymore see so so this is where David said Psalms 32 and2 blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose Spirit there is no gu now I'm going to say something here that's right if that was true about every human then this is a redundant statement right and there are no redundant statements in the Bible the very fact that David is saying blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity signifies that there that's not everybody see and in whose Spirit there is no guile see this is the same th and what does that well what does it for the 144,000 the same thing's doing it for you amen the Bible speaking of the 144,000 in Revelation 141 verse 1 and verse 5 and I looked and lo a lamb now just listen because they're going to receive this same message this very same message that you have that you enjoy see and and the Bible says and I looked and L lamp stood on Mount Zion and with him 144 and 140 and 4,000 having his father's name written in the forehead see theyve re they've received a revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ because it's a revelation of the name of God and the and the word interpreted is a manifestation of the name of God verse five I'll get through it verse five and in their mouth was found no gu for they are without fault Before the Throne of God if that message is going to do that for them how does it not do it for you now here's the be here's a more beautiful part god decreed this about them 2,000 years before they would ever even stand on the earth we don't even know who they are to this day they haven't even been identified to the themselves and 2,000 years before they would ever be on the earth God has already declared that and you say how how does he know that that's going to happen his word in Revelation 14 has already declared it I would tell you that it's going to be impossible for it to not happen because he's already put it in his Bible see now I want to take you back to our text tonight and I want to read that 9 through 21 again except I'm going to use the JW version jwv all right this is from my work on my rewrite of the book of Romans I I I often go back to it when I'm trying to understand Paul writes in sometimes in such abstract ways King James English causes us in our modern Minds to have to really strain to get his full meaning so I've did all the heavy lifting for you this is this work is several years old I occasionally go through it and make edits but I want to just read I want to reread our text whoops is it gonna come back on for me let me go off and let me come back on uh okay let's Advance all right all right go right here and then now the next one all right now watch because here is the other side of why you're ordained to not fall why you are predestinated to stand and stand victoriously speaking of the blood of Christ and now that we have been justified by his blood we much more surely then will be saved through him from the wrath of God for since we were restored to favor with God by the death of his son while we were still enemies we will most certainly be delivered from Eternal punishment by his life makes sense and not only that but we even boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have received atonement so I can actually boast it's it's not me boasting In My Own Strength it's me boasting in what the blood of Christ has done and because I have received the Word of Promise and that has entitled me to the Holy Ghost and there's no condemnation possible to me see this is the beauty of it and I and I you know how I've preached you about that word atonement that atonement is is is is really when we talk about and this why a lot of the early church fathers use the word atonement but it only describes Christ's worthiness to be your sacrifice but they would often use the word satisfaction because that entails both sides that entails the atonement that he was a worthy lamb that you couldn't be but then it also covers the preceptive side and requirements of the word because every precept has to be upon precept somebody had to live it perfectly cuz you certainly won't and I certainly won't and we have't and we won't no one ever has anywhere in the Bible except one man the elected son of Isaiah 42 and he's the elected son and I'm in him and therefore he lived the preceptive sight of the word on my behalf say does it is it really brother Jason that that my sins don't count against me it's that your your life has already been identified in the life of Jesus and the record is sealed and nothing else can be added and so all your failures don't get added to that record it's finished see so I'm I'm I gain access to this by the Holy Ghost baptism see not because I want a lottery not because I'm a better person but because I've received the word for my day see watch verse 11 again and not only that but we even boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have received atonement for death had passed upon all men the reason being that when one man Adam sinned sin entered into the whole world and through sin Came Death so then death automatically passed upon all men you see people sinned even before the law was given and and though there was no law to break since it had not yet been given they all died anyway even though they did not uh disobey an explicit commandment of God as Adam did what a contrast between Adam in Christ who was yet to come and what a difference between our sin and God's generous gift of salvation for if for if this one man Adam could bring death to all people through his sin did he anybody want to argue that if one man if this one man Adam could bring death to all people through his sin then how much more abundantly through the one man Jesus Christ will the grace of God Supply a pardon for them see this is Paul's point and the result of God's gracious gift is very different from the result of that one man's sin for Adam's one sin led to the total condemnation but God's free gift face many transgressions resulting in total justification besides if by the trespass of one man a Adam death reigned through that one man how much more surely will those who receive God's overflowing Grace and the free gift of his righteousness reign as kings in this present life and the one to come through the one man Jesus Christ therefore since everything I've just said therefore just as one man's trespass led to condemnation for all so one man's Act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all because of one man's Disobedience many were made Sinners so also by The Obedience of one many shall be made righteous the law was added so that the trespass might increase but people uh people then being able to see just how sinful they really were but where sin increased Grace increased all the more sin once used death to exercise dominion over us but God re Grace Grace could now rule over us through justification leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord does it get any better can you hope for a better deal than that and guess what I mean it's free hey if I had a deal and I say how many will give me this and we can start a bid in an auction say what's what what are we bidding on eternal life my goodness you'd empty your bank account I'm here to tell you it don't cost you a dime all it takes is a complete surrender of your life to the word that God has brought in this hour or any hour and that entitled you to the Holy Ghost you're born again of the spirit of God and there is no condemnation possible to you after that this is why he would say the bride is predestinated to stand there she is ordained to not fall why because even if she commit a transgression God blessed is the man who God will not impute iniquity to see so this is the beauty of it this is why when brother brandom comes to questions and answers I'm GNA stop in 11 minutes listen I didn't put this one up here because I wanted to put some up and I wanted to read some now I'm coming down to the end and I just want you to catch this brother Ram comes to questions and answers and he's talking about this whole idea where John had said in 1 John 3:9 whosoever is born of God do not commit sin how do you get born of God uh to omnipotence meat the Holy Ghost which is Christ which is the word brings to life a seed that is part of the word that is part of Christ that was in God and just as Christ is a Offspring just as Jesus of Nazareth is an offspring of God so is the family of Jesus Christ an offspring of God so John says whosoever is born of God does not commit sin here's why his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God is that your Bible so brother brandham says for by one spirit this is question answerers 195 for one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and are free from sin and we cannot there is an atonement waiting for us Christians don't sin they make mistakes but they don't sin brother Brandon is going to read this this is a this is a true story I lived in this city and mayor vissing and brother brandham were bosom friends brother Bram tells this story which was a a known fact in the city of Jeffersonville the mayor of the city says Mr Branham I know that you make sick calls there's speed limits highest speed limit in the city is about 35 miles an hour but I'm giving you permission to run 90 if you want to because I have faith in you that you wouldn't do it unless you had emergency call or somebody dying Yonder in a wreck and I'll give you permission as the mayor of this city that you can run any red light man my kind of Mayor you can run any red light do whatever you want to just go right on brother brandham talks about an officer he said How Could An Officer ever arrest me out here making 45 miles an hour in a 35 M Zone he can't I cannot break any speed laws in this city because why I'm above the speed law and when we are dead and God has recognized our repentance he's recognized our baptism he's recognized the blood of his own son which by faith has been applied he recognizes his foreordination and know that I do it and has recognized me in Christ dead and Christ in Christ died in my place when he was slain before the foundation of the world Christ is my sacrifice and God could not impute to me sin anymore he's given me the Seal of the Holy Ghost as a witness that I've passed from death to life so the law of sin and death has no jurisdiction over you friends it has no jurisdiction over you we're free I could say it like brother brandham said it we're Above the Law I realize that mankind makes mistakes and and and if he M if he breaks God's commandment then there's a penalty but not to the people who are above the law oh my Hallelujah because I am Above the Law I you've heard me say it before I I got a new passport I you know what kind I got I got it from Heaven you know what it is it's a diplomatic passport I you say aren't you an American I'm a Christian Hallelujah I've got a diplomatic passport you don't what that means that means I I am immune from prosecution Hallelujah I'm a diplomat from the kingdom of Christ and I'm not subject to the laws of the common Earthling oh people don't like that but I have diploma imunity because I am a child of God I am a son of The King and I am ordained to not fall it's not it's not just I'm not ordained I'm ordained to not fall I'm predestinated to stand there's a reason for that number one I'm feeding on the pure word how can I not become the word when I'm feeding on the pure word you well because of your mistakes they don't count against me this thing is sealed on both sides friends I'm here to tell you as you've heard me say it before once you're in Christ you've believed the word you've been baptized in the Holy Ghost you're going in the Rapture and there's nothing you can do about it Hallelujah I'm signed sealed and delivered I'm ordained for the Rapture I'm predestinated not to fall for Satan's trickery in this world that's what God has done for me and that is what God has done for you amen you know I I remember some time ago and I I'll close with this I remember some time ago I visited Ellis Island and I was just so amazed at the amount of people that trafficed through there from other lands coming to this land they came from other kingdoms into this Kingdom called the United States and it's not just Ellis Island the same principle that I'm talking about here the same principle at at our Southern border at our northern border where wherever whatever way you come into the United States you're going to have to go through processing you're going to have to be processed you're GNA they're going to have to determine do you qualify to stay here you see I I said this in Colombia on Sunday and I and I was talking about the great white Throne judgment when you when you take it from the perspective of Revelation 20 where the Bible says that the the sea gave up its dead and death and Hell gave up its dead and the dead both small and great stood Before the Throne and so I made this statement I said people talk about who gets to go to heaven everybody that's not the question everybody gets to go to heaven the question is who gets to stay amen and so you have to you know you know what the great white Throne is judgment is it's like a processing they come into Alis Island they come into Southern border they come into northern border however they get here they have to go through processing did you ever notice that the that the staff doing the processing aren't being processed you ever think about that the only people who are being processed are people who are coming there to see if they get to stay there but the staff has already been processed they're actually part of the processing team you're Seated on the thr on with Christ I'm not I'm not being processed I'm being processed now my whole life is standing before the word of God and I'm going through my processing right now oh Hallelujah friends they they want to know about your background they want to know about your life they want to know about your family they want to know if you got your documents they want to know if you got your papers I showed up I didn't have anything except Christ Hallelujah I only I just said I'm with him hallelujah oh I'm with him are you with him tonight my they're going to they're going to pull everybody's record you know I we all got our record pulled one day and you know what you know I thought I thought to myself I thought to myself when I thought about that and in the image of my mind I thought you know I was surprised when my record got pulled you know why because I knew what all I had done and I knew I had a wrap sheet a mile long and when they brought out my record it didn't have any of that on it it was completely clean I thought they had pulled the wrong file and I found out that they did and they didn't and I said well I don't understand my wrap sheet should be 100 miles long how does it not have any did you pull the wrong file they said no we pulled your file right here's your name at the top Mrs Jesus Christ I said wait a minute whose filed you pull they said the file of Jesus Christ you pulled his file yeah and his life was counted to you you got credit for his life and he never sinned so you never sin take your place Hallelujah friend that's where we stand tonight no wonder she's ordained to not fall she is predestinated to stand and stand victoriously oh I'm so glad he pulled somebody else's record besides mine he pulled the Lord's record my

week um we bought a new vehicle um off a Facebook Marketplace and um we'd been praying for a new vehicle for a while trying to find a good deal we got what I thought was a pretty good deal and um we got it home and the great trial that everyone has to face is the DMV and uh so I had to go to the DMV to you know get my my title and tags and everything when I got there they let me know that the girl that I bought it from had made a mistake on the back of the title so I had to go hunt her down to get a title error acknowledgement form signed so they could transfer the the title well horror of Horrors um she had taken the listing down off the Facebook Marketplace and we had communicated entirely through Facebook Marketplace and she had her settings set to not accept new messages so she is now in the wind there is no no contacting her she's gone I don't have an address I don't have a phone number I don't have anything and I'm like well I call the DMV I'm like is there anything y'all can do and they're basically like no you're on your own so I I'm just completely at a loss I've I have now a car that I don't technically own in my driveway and no money to show for it so you know I'm I'm just kind of panicked and I was on the way home from the DMV I'm like Lord you did some Miracles recently you helped me find some small things you put a knife in my pocket I need you to help me find this girl this is you know and so we we get I went to uh Kate was at Andrew and Emily so I meet him there I'm like guys we got to we got to pray and we got to we got to like I don't know we got to find this girl because I you know we have to find her and um so we just started pulling her Facebook apart um we looked for friends list any sort of public record we could find uh we she had just moved down from Massachusetts so we didn't even really have like so the address on her on the title that we had wasn't even a valid address that she you know we found some like public records we I mean anybody with the same last name we're like looking for any public records and Kate had stepped into a back room and she just started praying about it and um she said it was like the Lord spoke to her and said hey that address you well because we had found an ad the the name of a name with the same last name as the girl associated with an address that had a a phone number that we called that was disconnected and she said that that name that you have he has family look for family and so she finds another name associated with him that had a public phone number and I'm like all right we're going to call that and then like the greatest Miracle ever someone answered an unknown number and this lady answers the phone and I'm like I'm this is going to be weird you don't know me from anybody but are you friends or family of so and so and she's like yeah I am I'm like listen this is here's my story I know this is kind of out of the blue could you please get in contact with her and let her know to contact me and here's my information well it turns out that was her mom oh wow so uh but yeah so that within an hour I had a a phone number I had papers signed that evening goodness and Monday I finally got my stuff squared away at the DMV but I that was I I couldn't believe it it was kind of a really the Lord really did a miracle for us on that one wow praise the [Applause] Lord amen anybody body else before we go brother who is it where you at wait I got to go this way oh John okay go ahead so months ago when brother Daryl was here preaching I claimed my healing for my eyes and I'm thanking God for it and I am healed and I I till I see it I expect it amen and I thank him for it praise the Lord Brother John Luther good there you go okay so um I have a couple of um testimonies of meaning to give one of them was with a pocket door that I had to do that um I could not get it back in the thing on the track or nothing like that I I tried and tried and I got crowbars under and it trying to get it up on over so it would be on the pulley and everything and I just kind of stopped I remember once I was working with Matt's dad and we had a window in a brick building that we were doing it was like 8 ft tall 8 18 in wide and we had to grind on those bricks to get the thing to go in and we just couldn't get it to go in and uh he just we just stopped for a minute and prayed and then all of a sudden it popped in so I was doing this door and I was just like well I need help and um help me Lord and then somehow it got in there I don't I was just like you got to be kidding me and I was very thankful for that but that's happened several times on this job but the one that um I was riding my bike up at U NWA and I I fell down a couple of times because of my own um not paying attention but uh the second time I was basically what I was doing as I had told Aron I where I was riding and I wanted to kind of film some of it because it's just dirt roads you never see a car nothing it's it's it's really nice up there except now the deer flies are like to chase you out but so I was trying to get my phone up while I was riding I had a pothole and um I felt pretty good and I really wrecked up my left knee bruised it I could still bend it and everything and it was the bruising kind of went away and then it was just like I couldn't straighten it I couldn't like I had hyperextended it or something and I was just like and this was like four or five days later and uh um so I tell Melissa Melissa wants to pray everything for me she wants to make sure I don't fall apart and uh that's just but so we prayed and then I was just like flabbergast in the middle of the night cuz I get up and I'm like oh my goodness it was totally it's been totally fine ever since and I it just I don't know what happened but I couldn't straighten it all the way it was just it was very painful and then it was gone praise the Lord you amen and we found a ring so um it looks like an engagement ring sister Wanda found it up in this area of the church so if you want to claim it claim it amen praise the Lord anybody else before we go anybody else amen shake hands with somebody then say God bless you you're dismissed in Jesus name we'll see you this weekend don't forget brother Samuel's meeting start Friday night Friday night Saturday morning Saturday night for us here God bless
