Amy's family again we greet him in the Sunday school class and we had a good time in Sunday school class this morning my I feel like I've already been to church but amen I've got some more that's on my heart and on my mind so we want to invite you this morning to the book of Acts chapter 1 foreign I wanted to make just um a quick announcement here let me see if I can get to it easily yes so um Sister Sarah Younce would like um wanted to say uh to my Bethel family I'd like to thank each and every one for the phone calls text messages food and flowers but most of all for your prayers we love and appreciate all the thoughtfulness may God richly bless you for all the kindness you have shown as I recover kindness is a beautiful thing you know that it's so absent from the world and and sometimes just a little love can go a long long way but love you know perfect love demonstrates itself it's it's um it's not passive it's active perfect faith is Pat is not passive it's active so it demonstrates itself and so we're happy our sister came through that good and I was on the road to recovery want to be remembering uh brother Larry and sister Sherry Jenkins also that entire family his mother passed away yesterday I got a chance to visit her last week before going out of town and what a grand lady and love the Lord with all of her heart and you know couldn't see quite to the level of this message but that's just in the hands of God nothing nothing all you can do is present it and live it but she certainly was a great Christian lady and I'll be accounted a great privilege to be speaking her funeral and we'll be sending you details on that um probably Tuesday or Wednesday I'm not sure brother Larry hasn't got the exact arrangements with me just yet but amen looking forward to that privilege Acts chapter 1 let's begin reading at verse 4. and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he ye have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the Earth and while they looked steadfastly toward Heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel I'm sorry we skipped verse 9. and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward Heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said Yemen of Galilee why stand you gazing up into heaven this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven may the Lord bless the reading of his word as we pray father we thank you for your love and your kindness to us thank you for your revealed word to us today Lord we are just so grateful for you that we are able to assemble here today on a bright and beautiful sunny day there's no Devastation to our Fair City our church and our family's Lord are all fine and Lord we pray for the Saints of anyone who suffered any kind of loss during the storm we have word from the churches in Florida that all the Believers are safe and the Lord was sparing his family as is to be expected you just do that so often Lord may we never make light of it may we always be very grateful may it humble us I pray now be with us in the word I pray be with my heart and my mind as you have led me down this path Lord I commit myself into your hands as always Lord to be an oracle of you I commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated brother Branham spoke quite extensively on the ministry of the son of man I'm preaching to you today on parallels of the Third Exodus the Third Exodus of course is our home going amen the first Exodus was in Egypt when God brought a nation out of a Nation bringing Israel out that was The Exodus the second Exodus of course was when Christ Rose and carried uh men the the graves of many of the saints Saints which slept arose and were and went into the City and were seen and went back to heaven with him brother Branham even talks about Abraham and Sarah making a short Whistle Stop there in Jerusalem and uh don't know how that what that looked like but they he said Lord we haven't seen the old city in a long time can we make a quick Whistle Stop him and then after they turned down Glory Lane and went up Hallelujah Avenue a few times and and Abraham grabbed her and said oh Sarah we've been recognized we better go and vanished and so uh I tell you something friends um there's such a there's still such a shroud of mystery around what it's going to look like when the saints come back but we know they're coming back and we know that we'll be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we know that one of these mornings brother Branham said that you'll feel a little funny feeling and uh in one place he called it a little twinge of almost like a pain he said it'll be the last pain you ever feel in your life oh man I am so looking forward to that amen when I I expect that you know I I I told when my preached brother Eddie's memorial service that um I said you know I'm looking for one of these mornings between six and nine to be you know if I'm not already up to be waking up and hear a familiar voice say Jason son get in here I'll shout all the way I'll jump out of the bed amen praise the Lord and uh oh my goodness my feet will go to dancing amen praise God so we're looking for that hour we don't know what all it will entail we know the bride will get together for brother Branham called it a month or so some people looked for the quote 30 to 40 days I've never been able to find it said that way but I find where he calls it a month or so and so will we have a Ministry well we'll certainly have a purpose I know that you know and one of the some of the purpose that we do understand is to get together before we meet him in the air because that's the order you say where do you get that from from the gospels that that that Jesus himself was seen and the Bible says that the Saints which roads were seen and so so we find that they were there for 40 days when Jesus ascended and and and then brother Brandon picks up the near narrative he led captivity captive and and they they went down and come to the gates and fell back on the scripture you know open up the Everlasting Gates and allow the Lord Of Glory to come in and a voice one of the Angels behind the gate who is the Lord Of Glory I need the password the Lord Mighty in battle the gates Rose and here brother I've said here went Jesus down the corridor down our I think uh you know Hallelujah Avenue and and all the way up to the father's throne and that great procession following him saying father they're yours my blood oh it has been offered and sacrificed and they're yours and so I look forward to that because you know we we we we long for that hour my and so we we know that there will be a time where at least we'll be getting together because you're not gonna when it comes time to see the Lord in the air remember that this is most most perfectly fulfilled on the day of Pentecost what we just read because Jesus feet doesn't come back down and touch the Earth till Revelation 19. so this is most properly fulfilled uh it's a dual meaning but it's most properly fulfilled on the day of Pentecost when he came down and they said just as you saw him go up he'll come down just like that he'll come down and he came down among them and divided himself into the church we'll say a little more about that as we go along but we find that that we're going to want to make sure that we've got all of our old acquaintances renewed and you know I want to see if this one made it or that one made it and my I want to see loved ones I haven't seen in years and because when it comes time to meet him in the air we want to have all eyes fixed all attention fixed oh I don't want to have any more questions at that moment I want to behold My Redeemer amen and even those in the sixth Dimension he's up higher they haven't seen him and so they're longing also so we find that brother Branham talks about the ministry of the son of man and it's extremely important to us because of it because of what it means and we realize and we've showed you before that there is a distinction to be made between the office of son of man and the ministry of Son of Man the office of son of man is a prophet and God uses a prophet because it's a prophet that brings you into the presence of God and gives you the Living Word a bleeding word without a prophet you have no access and that's why that's why whenever in every stage of redemption everywhere where God was showing Redemption from all the way to the Old Testament all the way to now he always used a prophet because the office and Ministry of a prophet is a Ministry of atonement and Jesus himself came as a son of man and so so we realize that we're looking for more than just his Blessing which you can get just by giving and God will cause men to give unto your bosom you can pay your tithes and offerings you don't even have to be a Christian and God will still bless that you can go to a Benny Hinn service and receive the true anointing of the Lord Jesus Christ it might be a an artificial false vessel but it's still a true anointing falling on a false vessel but when it comes to being taken into the presence of God you have to have blood you have to have a bleeding word and that's what a prophet comes to do to give you access as we've preached on that before Aaron could not go into the presence of the Shekinah without a lamb without blood without a sacrifice Moses went in and out and in and out and in and out of that Shekinah on Mount Sinai he walked in and out without any blood without any lamb he never sacrificed anything he because why he would that that office that he held that's what it was built for and when the Lord told him to go back down and make sure nothing touches the mountain if even an animal touches it's got to be killed and and when you come back bring Aaron with you and when he brings Aaron back into the presence of the Shekinah they never bring a lamb they never offer blood there's no sacrifice because Aaron is with Moses and he's under the umbrella of the son of man Ministry let us be glad and rejoice because God has sent that Ministry into the end time God has given you people say we don't need a prophet you certainly do if you didn't have a prophet why was Paul a prophet if you don't have a prophet you there's no way to establish Redemption see so that's why even during the the church ages they only got a dip of the Holy Ghost they didn't have the full token the abstract and the full title uh was in Paul's day and and the alpha and in the Omega and I'm determined not to get ahead of myself so let me just let me just keep keep going methodically along so we find that the minute that the office of son of man is Prophet but the ministry of son of man is a broader term it means the word made flesh so now at when when when Paul was taken home that didn't stop the ministry of Jesus Christ in the church see because that the word was still made flesh and when brother Brannan went home that didn't take away the pillar of fire that didn't take away the ministry of Christ Mrs Jesus was still here she's the final voice why because she's in the ministry of the son of man see so the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy all right so so we find that brother Branham would tie the word many times a lot of usage on this word incarnate or the Incarnation now Incarnation literally means embodied in flesh or taking on flesh it refers and I'm reading directly from the lexical Aid it refers to the conception and the embodiment of a deity or spirit in some Earthly form that's that's incarnate all right this is Incarnation or the appearance of a God as a human if capitalized it is the union of divinity ah it is the union of divinity with Humanity as an example Jesus Christ it is in its religious context the word is used to mean God deity or Divine being in human form on Earth so it's Christ in you the hope of glory so this is why a prophet had the bleeding word to deliver to you and I because we weren't merely looking for salvation from destruction the foolish virgin have that we were looking for Redemption which is a further work than than just salvation from destruction we were looking to be redeemed back to our original state what was our original state when morning Stars sang together and sons of God shouted for Joy I'm here to tell you something friends that's always been God's plan that's always how he's done it there's no reason to even think he would do it different just because it's the end time see so brother Branham now is going to pick this term up incarnate or Incarnation and I'm going to give you two quotes and I and they asked me for a PowerPoint I decided to skip it because I I don't want to get too slowed down this morning but just pay attention from the second seal now brother Branham is going to talk about the Beast because remember before the bride goes up and Satan is cast down now that's already in process and I can't preach on we're already ascending and he's already descending that's certainly true in the spiritual realm but but physically we're still here and but physically we're leaving here and in a very real form we're going there and in a very real form he's coming he's going to be thrown down here now you say well how has he already descending how is he already he has already fallen from his position to accuse you because you have now passed from Death To Life you've received the engrafted word you've become Mrs Jesus Christ and now because you are in the full uh grip of redemption then there is now therefore no condemnation to you it's not possible you cannot even be indicted God will not even hear a charge against you even if there's DNA evidence even if Satan brings forensic evidence and has you dead to rights God will not even hear the case because just like he imputed righteousness to Abraham and it had nothing to do with Abraham being good or better successful or a failure Abraham was a success many times also there were times when he failed he backslid and left the promised land brother Brandon said anytime a Jew leaves the promised land he's backslid and a famine came on and his perseverance got a little thin and he abandoned the promised land and went down to Egypt almost got himself killed almost lost his wife see picked up Hagar and of which Israel's still paying for that one they're still paying for that one and so so we we find that and then he did the same thing you know to the to the kingdom of the Philistines lying to save his skin so that when God imputed righteousness to Abraham it wasn't that God was saying I'm just going to turn a blind eye and I'm just going to say he lived a perfect record that had nothing to do with Abraham not his failures or successes he believed the word that made him part in the into the seed line of Christ and it's that faith and God attributed the righteousness of Christ that Christ would hadn't even come to live yet but when Jesus would come he would live a perfect life and before hundreds of years before he ever even showed up thousands of years before Jesus was on the scene Abraham was given full credit for the life the Son of God would live now that's before Calvary and before the Holy Ghost how much more are you and I Hallelujah so he's so now we find out that when the bride goes up and Satan comes down presently you have a false prophet the Pope he's a he's a false prophet because he's a preacher of false teaching and that makes him a false prophet see it's not a question there there's a distinction that has to be made between real prophets and true Prophets because Balaam was a real prophet but it wasn't a true prophet but he was a real one you understand but he wasn't a true one because he abandoned the word Moses was both a real one and a true one all right so so it's not just about being a prophet many false prophets shall arise and deceive many which means they shall have Global success which is kind of you know almost uh their success really is a is a Harbinger it's kind of an identification if they're successful that's kind of an identification that they're not a true Prophet because no true Prophet was ever globally successful wasn't even successful in his own home City which of the prophets Jesus said which of the prophets did your fathers not kill and you polished their tombs showing that you agree with what happened so you keep it going with your imagery so now but when we when the bride goes up and Satan comes down right now in the false prophet there's demon placeholders they're only there as placeholders when the bride goes up and Satan comes down he incarnates the false prophet he kicks the demons out and takes over and the false prophet becomes the Incarnate Beast see so now it's not just Beast as a power or an anointing it's literally incarnate the Beast the bride goes up Satan comes down incarnates the false prophet and he becomes the Beast incarnate personified as a human as a person all right so brother Brandon picks up in the second seal now as Satan is going to has incarnated himself from Antichrist to false prophet now and in the days of the Jews is Antichrist amongst the early church that shocks a lot of people they don't they think the Antichrist is just an end time sequence it's not the the apostles show that the Antichrist was already working in the early church so he says in the days of the Jews is Antichrist amongst the early Church in the Dark Ages he become a false prophet remember they crowned him in the fourth age as a false prophet started out as the whole thing started out as just a reasoning of the word and then it kind of became a saying and then it went to a Doctrine and then it became a person see don't don't think that don't think that Satan don't have that in his Playbook he starts in your mind as a as a thought contrary to this and after a while he gets you to even talk about and ruminate on it and after a while you become convinced of it and when you become convinced of it you become it see and so this is why reasoning against God's word is so very dangerous because Satan is never going to be content just to have you questioning a reasoning with it he's trying to get you to an Incarnation see all right so so he says now that's the all right um amongst the early Church in the Dark Ages he become a false prophet to the world see her there with her cup of iniquity now that's to the church age now but in the age after the church goes home he becomes a beast he becomes the devil incarnate the red dragon himself oh my can't you see what I mean he is Incarnate in his people then he's got his people Bound by his power the false prophet has prophesied them right into it now look at that how did the whole world run after the Beast the false prophet prophesied them right into it what's his prophesying preaching what's his preaching false teaching and the whole world wonders after the Beast you see so now just flip the script what what brought you to become the word made flesh what makes you the ministry of the son of man what makes you Misses Jesus Christ because a true Prophet has preached you into it Hallelujah so the false prophet has prophesied them right into it give them over to strong delusions to believe a lie and be damned by it denying the word with a form of godliness God works his place in a trinity justification sanctification and incarnate himself in his people with the baptism of the Holy Ghost now there should be no more question in your mind what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is God incarnating himself in you so it's and then Paul could say it's no longer I live it's Christ I died it's Christ that lives he is now incarnate inside me therefore the works that he did I do also therefore the life he lived I live also therefore the faith he had I have also amen therefore the translation he had in Resurrection I shall have also if that same spirit that was in him being you it shall also Quicken your mortal bodies so that's what the Holy Ghost is it's not a sensation it may have all kinds of Sensations it may produce all kinds of those things in your life but brother Branham said he said in this way I don't have the court in front of me you say well I speak in tongues you might and you might not well I have this sign or this miracle or this wonder you might and you might not he said but one thing you will do you will reproduce the life of Jesus Christ Hallelujah see so same thing the devil is just a type after Christ so Satan incarnates himself now watch when Jesus incarnates himself in his people the very life that was in Christ is in the person he moves on two years later to Invisible Union the invisible Union of the bride of Christ why doesn't the world recognize Christ in you because it's invisible they know you're different they admire your lifestyle but they cannot figure the secret of life how you got it see and you you try to offer them the path And when they see the path and there then there comes the rejection so brother Branham says look at the elected Abraham Church pulled out look what kind of a sign that Jesus himself the incarnated God standing there in human flesh you say that was an angel the Bible says it was God Lord God Elohim standing there in human flesh now that bears out go search your Hebrew if you have a Hebrew lexical Aid as I study that you find that the word Abraham referred to Melchizedek when the Bible it's Capital l-o-r-d but when you look at that Hebrew word that word is always it's never not associated with almighty God the Creator there's no instance where it's not used in that in that way it's all Abraham was not wrong in calling him capital L O R D Lord see so we find that it was Lord God Elohim standing there in human flesh now here's what he was showing say oh well he just did that to build Abraham's Faith well it's more than that well he did that to prove it to Sodom this is a little more than that this is this is going to transcend Millennia and come down to your day in my day Lord God Elohim standing there in human flesh showing that he would so anoint his church in the last days it be God working in human flesh again I hope you can absorb that today you say oh I I I don't think I I can quite make that kind of a claim then get get in your prayer closet get in the word of God because that's what's up that's what you say why is this happening in my life that's why why is this trial or this chaos or this thing going on it's because God is determined to bring you to that you are coming to the image of Christ and going in a Rapture and there's nothing you can do about it Hallelujah so I just say let me get to going Lord hallelujah whatever it takes in my life Lord God I pray that sincerely today I pray it all the time lord whatever it takes see showing that he would so anoint his church in the last days it'd be God working in human flesh again as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man same kind of a thing they see it now watch this statement they see it right there in the scriptures we do we can see it right in the scriptures it's promised All Through the Bible if you go to you know where it's I mean it's not just Malachi 4 or Luke 17. it's not just Revelation 5 and 4 and 5 and Revelation 7 and Revelation 10 Revelation 18. find yourself in Revelation 19 before he comes back when he comes back in Revelation 19 that's late in the chapter that's latter days that that means that the marriage supper has already ended and he's coming back now the second Woe Is Over the Moses Elijah have been killed the 144 000 have been martyred the foolish virgin have been martyred the end of the second woe behold the third won't cometh quickly and then now you see him the heavens open like it did in Revelation 4. now you see the heavens open like it did in the book of Isaiah in the book of Jeremiah The Book of Ezekiel and all these things and said the heavens open and I saw this and I saw that because what does the heavens opening signify a revelation of God is now coming down to his family and so we find that that that when he write the Bible says the heavens are open and he wrote out on a white horse a purity of the word and the armies of Heaven which was his family his bride she's already been raptured she's already been at a wedding supper this is the end of the end and the an Armageddon is coming on so don't race ahead to that because verses before that you get to what's happening right now the the the the bride hath made she's been called to the marriage of the Lamb the marriage is now and the bride hath made herself ready say what am I going to church for why do I listen to a tape why do I read my Bible because you're making yourself ready [Music] that's why the word is for yeah it's making you ready prior to see The Coming Out of Heaven on white horses so we have all of these things as brother Jack Duff says if you want to hear if you expect to hear come up you better first hear come out if you don't obey come out you'll never hear come up see so so we see our life right here in the scriptures we're not wondering I love this you know we're not wondering about the meaning of life that's a question that has plagued mankind for millennia what is the meaning of life we're not wondering anymore the book has been unsealed to us the mystery has been unfolded and we see ourselves in the vision Hallelujah I'm actually a part of this thing not wondering about the meaning of life we've preached you this morning on on this in the Sunday school about our approach to prayer and what it should be and the Lord already tells you his intentions you already know he's got good for you and not evil plan you already know he's bringing you to your expected end you know he might not reveal why you're going through this trial or the one you just went through as brother Dave as Brother David um gadman says you're either just come out of a trial or you're in a trial or you're going into a trial you either just come out you're in it or you're going into one because Peter said don't think it's strange it's for your development it's for your construction it's for your good see so God is bringing you to something he may not always reveal why the why of everything but I know his intention I know it's for my good I know it's done in love all I got to do is cooperate in the vision you will have a much more blessed life if you'll just start cooperating in the vision Hallelujah God will devastate his children he'll he will he will blister the height of his family if they refuse to walk in his vision for them I know I've been blistered been there done that got the T-shirt [Music] so we know our purpose for being here we have the opportunity friends you have the opportunity I can't force you and God won't force you all I can do is preach to you and live it as best I can all we can do is be one for all all for one and one for all all we can do is pull together all we can do is acknowledge We're All in This Together all we can do is pray for one another but we have the opportunity today to finish the work of Christ among the Gentiles and these closing scenes of History you have the opportunity it's offered to you to to enter into the ministry of the son of man say I I wasn't called to the ministry you're mistaken the entire family of God is called into the ministry your ministry might not be a Pulpit Ministry there's that's just one of the few this is there's only five of them kind yeah actually only four uh Apostle doesn't even necessarily mean a preacher this means one cent yeah so you don't even necessarily have to be a preacher to be a missionary and so so even if you do that it only Narrows four of them down to coming behind a desk like this there's many more forms of ministry than that so when we look at our Third Exodus parallel today brother Branham makes this statement and we've we've heard it before from the message persevering brother Branham describes how that according to the scripture that when the resurrection of the saints come the resurrection of all the 2000 years seven Church ages of church history that when all of those Saints rise say Do you believe in the return do you believe in Brother Brad I'm returning yeah my grandma too my dad too amen Hallelujah they're all coming back Hallelujah so you say well do you believe there will be a Ministry that Ministry is going on right now see so brother Brown talks about there that would be a great number the Bible calls it a number no man could number it's so vast but brother reminds us remember that's that's from 2 000 years that's an accumulation of seven Church ages and you know down around the world as the as the gospel from the East traveled to the West as the Lightning goes from the East to the West so shall it be to the coming of the son of man so we we find but he says but he says but now concerning we which are alive and remain those who get changed we're not talking about now those who come out of the Grave that'll be a number no man could number but he says but but on concerning the change there will be one in the field I'll take one and leave one just somebody come up missing there will listen to this there will just be a very very like Jesus truly truly certainly certainly brother Branham says there will just be a very very few in that rapture that'll be changed there will be a very very few in that Rapture that'll be changed now how very striking that the title of the sermon for that statement is perseverant so now that that informs my thinking perseverance must be big perseverance is a big Topic at the end time when it comes Rapture time we're not talking about the Saints coming back we're talking about we which are alive and remain to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye now we've got to think about our perseverance see if we faint not Paul says yes all right give me brother Jason First Corinthians chapter 10. now Paul having realized that the second Exodus had just passed as we told you the second Exodus first Exodus was Moses coming out of Egypt a nation out of a Nation second Exodus is Christ resurrecting and the Saints going with him the Third Exodus is the Saints returning from the New Testament and we which are alive and remain shall be changed and we'll meet the Lord in the air that's the Third Exodus so now Paul having realized that the second Exodus had just passed looking forward now to the Third he reflects on the first Corinthians 10 he's going to give an outline of people who were interested in the first Exodus they were they were invested in the first Exodus moreover brethren I would not that you should be ignorant now I'm paralleling and I'm going to parallel one to two to three moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers I want you to notice how many times you're going to read the word a-l-l how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ who drank from it all of them but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples see Paul having just realized the second Exodus was passed he now is teaching the church how to receive the third and so he reflects back on the first amen see now these things were our examples to the intent we talked about this morning in our Sunday school the intention of God is revealed to us to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted who lusted some of those who crossed the Red Sea with Moses drank from the spirits of rock ate the manner that came from Heaven baptized into Moses and the sea in the cloud see don't don't therefore our examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither verse 7. neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and they rose up to play neither well this is a bullet list now this is really starting to this is getting serious neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents I'm not a pandemic boy neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the Destroyer now all these things happened unto them for our examples who's our the people of the Third Exodus this is for us to take a lesson see these are for our examples and they are written for our admonition unto whom the ends of the world are come all right now you've got your marker now you know when this is Mo when this is most perfectly fulfilled upon those who have reached the time of the ends of the world you are the generation upon whom the ends of the world have come so if there was every anybody that needs to think about what he said in the message perseverant and read his teaching out of Paul's teaching out of First Corinthians 10 it is now it is this group see now brother Branham teaches extensively on Paul's writings here as he always did and he he there's a number of places I'm only going to point to a handful of them but there's more than what I'm listing today prior to the seals in 1957 he talks about it a whole lot in Corinthians book of Correction good sermon if you want to go get it he comes in 1962 in wisdom versus Faith what could I say more well that sermon will blow your mind see he comes after the seals and not only after the seals but all the way in the last year of his ministry in 1965 and in and in the month of April in one month he covers it in fact is every one of these I don't know if there's a significance to it I haven't studied it out but it was curious to me that every one of these was in April and in April 1957 would have been the first Easter after Pentecost after Azusa and America rejected the gospel for the last time and judgment fell on her now at the at the resurrection at Easter time he's preaching on Corinthians book of Correction why didn't you go in the Rapture why haven't we gone yet what's the problem with our churches let's go to Corinthians book of Correction he's still preaching to them in 62 in April wisdom versus Faith he comes in 1965 and in one month does God ever change his mind about his word One in a Million there's got to be a people who prove brother Brown said to prove they're not like Eve they're not she's not that kind of a woman this Pride of the last day is a virgin to the word and she will not receive the seed of another man she keeps herself strictly to Christ amen and finally choosing of a bride where brother Branham takes this and really begins to break it down I think it would be important to us to look at it now Paul has went down this this laundry list of of people who were not well pleasing and how they got overthrown they lusted after evil things they were idolaters and they were foreign fornicators and and they tempted Christ and they murmured and and so when we when we start to look at these things you start to look at the at the parallel in the second Exodus I could just let me just take you to the second one just in order to come back to this first one I mean when I look at the upper room experience and there was 120 people I'm thinking to my and this was this is the way my quirky mind thinks and I was thinking about that I thought 120 people wow how was there not at least five thousand but I mean he just fed that many twice and not even counting women and children twice he took two fish and Five Loaves and broke off baked bread and cooked fish and just crept creating cooked fish and baked bread and fed five thousand men not counting women and children and they took up 12 baskets full and he did it a second time and they took up I think seven baskets full how where were those five thousand how was it only 120 people could put yourself there for for just a moment how could they see that and and know that he walked on the water he spoke and raised dead people Simon cuts the air off of a high priest servant and Jesus reaches down picks it up out of the dirt and reconnects it and doesn't need surgery there's reconnection is totally healed I mean how could they see that you they they they had already they already had Temple guards saying saying why didn't you arrest him we sent you to arrest him and they said never a man spanked like this we can't even put it into words we just never heard anyone talk like that how were they not all there how they how they they the Sanhedrin and Nicodemus comes in the middle of the night and says we know you're of God we the San Hayden we know because what we know is that nobody can do what you're doing now we've had people who could do Miracles but we've never had anyone do what you're doing since the days of Abraham and Melchizedek when he discerned the heart thoughts of a woman sitting behind him and that had never happened and he said we know that nobody can do that you're reproducing that we know you must be of God And yet when the Holy Ghost fell there's 120 people is it any Wonder then that in that day of the second Exodus not all the graves opened brother Adam says who was the ones that opened it was the ones who had the truth not just because they were Jewish but the ones who had the true Faith Seed of Abraham who believed God's word their whole life didn't say they were perfect people but they had a perfect Faith toward God's covenant promise see and so so so we find that that not all of them came up can you imagine can you imagine for a moment being a Jew and you were you've got family records that you can prove unequivocally unmistakably you can bring out your family record my daddy his daddy his daddy his daddy his daddy his daddy his daddy his daddy his uh Abraham and Jesus even told them they said we Abraham's Our Father and Jesus didn't deny that he didn't argue with them on that I said I know you're Abraham's children but here's a curious thing you're trying to kill me and Abraham really didn't do that hahaha Abraham rejoiced to see my day and yet you're trying to kill me now that begins to show me something that though you're the lineage of Abraham you're the children of the devil because you're he was a liar and a murderer from the beginning and I see lying and murdering in you and why is it you can't understand my speech why can my word not find a place in you see and so can you imagine can you imagine being a a full-blooded Jew and the thing the most epic event of the whole reason you are a Jew is that God's going to establish a kingdom of Jew of Jews in the Earth where on the throne of David and and Israel's going to become the epicenter of the whole world and Justice is going to flow out of there in the millennium that's the son of David can you imagine that your whole life and your birth and everything you've been taught from a child and you've been raised to believe it and you are it and it's not a joke and you haven't just imagined you're a Jew you're a for real one and your Messiah the event you've weighed it on for thousands of years and he rises from the dead and you don't go with him now you wonder why there be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth and and and the false church that spent their life building hospitals and schools and saying we preached and did Mighty works and did all this in your name and he will say depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you your faith was artificial you're just trying to you're just trying to earn your salvation and you cannot earn it there's no way to earn it it's got to be the grace of God and that comes through the administration of Faith by by faith you are saved through Grace by Grace you are saved through faith see so it is a faith in the revealed word that's where Grace is embedded that's why when the Gentile bride leaves the Earth Grace is over for the Gentiles they'll still come to altars still crying still believe they're getting saved they're not see you you go to you you find that in in the in Revelation 21 he that's filthy is filthy still he that's rights is righteous still so so we see these parallels from the first Exodus to the second Exodus to the Third Exodus I mean you know when when they are you know when when we think about if you go back and look at some of these references that Paul is referencing you have to go chase it because Paul doesn't say where he just says here's what was going on and here's what was going on and they were lusting and they were murmuring and and and and and and and and what was some of his others he says uh so they're they're lusting and they're murmuring and they're complaining and you know they're they're they're lusting after evil things and they're idolaters and and and fornication you know lusting after evil things I mean you know that's what happened to Lot's wife see because she was told you got to make a total separation from unbelief don't even look back but she had to she could not overcome herself she had to make one last lustful gaze you see like Brother David Samuel made a point on that morning Bible study I've never forgotten so so noteworthy and worth repeating and he said he said you know yes sister lot left you know she left the boundaries of Sodom she left that City physically said but the problem was when she she turned to look and she turned to a pillar of salt she turned she she went one last lustful look and it was the last thing she ever did in life and he says the reason is is because though she left the boundaries of the city she had already built a metropolis in her heart and she couldn't let that go see and so they were overthrown in the wilderness lusting after evil things neither be idolaters of some as some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play they sat down to enjoy the blessings of God just like you're sitting here today but the allurements the the playful allormons the the contaminating poisons of the world you know the the the the the movie stars and the sports start let me change it movie idols and sports idols and financial idols and political idols and it's all idolatry and why does he preach in perseverance but only be a very very few make that Rapture that should speak to us today does it speak to you today this is not a time to have Idols ahead of the word of God say how do I know if I got Idols what what's the direction of your life what what's more important to you what you want or what he wants in your life see fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day I mean look fornication is a physical deed that follows a spiritual fornication that's why you that's why you see in in the Christian in the Christian nominal world so many preachers and even within ranks of every denomination even within ranks of the message of the hour you find that they commit a physical fornication physical adultery and it's because it almost always is preceded by spiritual adultery and they they commit spiritual adultery against God's word they disbelieve it and change it and make it fit what they want and that's adultery that's fornication and because you say why does it lead to physical adultery because it's the same spirit it's brother man said it's the exact same demon spirit see it's like I said to you this is why the Holy Ghost is so important to give you a new birth because if you don't have your nature changed as I said to you there's so many versions of the Gospel say how many well denominations and organized Christian movements there's north of 33 000 of them so there's a lot of versions of the Gospel say I thought there is only one gospel there's only one true gospel but there's there's tens of thousands of versions you see and if you don't get a new birth if you don't get that Fallen nature changed you'll hunt around until you find a version of The Gospel that you want to be true and you you want he said oh there's a version that'll let me do this and do that and do this and I can be free and I can still believe in Jesus but I can still have this in my life and that in my life and this my life and all kinds of idols and all kinds of fornications spiritual and natural and it doesn't matter that's a version of The Gospel it's out there it's for sale if you want it but it's not the one dripping with blood [Applause] I'm here to taste something this version is dripping with blood and I will not stand by and let this version be cheapened I will not let it be cheap and this gospel is dripping with the blood of Martyrs it's worth standing for neither tempted Christ as some of them tempted see they you know what you know what they're and then they and they started murmuring and and God sent the serpents among them and sent a destroyer among them you know you know what they were you know what you know what they were tempting Christ with and murmuring about they didn't like the way go back into the Book of Numbers you'll find all this chapter 14 I think chapter 21 I believe they didn't like the path God had chose for them they didn't like this desert we want to go back to Egypt we remember this and the garlics and all of this and now you brought us out here and there's no water and what are we going to do and this bread we hate this bread it is I'm sick of eating this bread and where's the meat and you know and where's how are we going to do this and complaining I'm here to tell you something friends the lesson that they learned is is that that Christ is not here to serve you Christ is here for you to serve him and you don't ever want to put him in the roll in a reversal role of of making your life what you want it to be you need to say I want to die I took my own my own desires I want his life whatever it is whatever's the cost and it's upon the age upon whom the ends of the world are come that's you and me so we found out that the presence of Supernatural privileges in the lives of the Old Testament Israelites did not produce automatic success no on the contrary in spite of their special advantages most of them all but two actually of of the original generation Joshua and Caleb uh all but two of them were disqualified and died in the desert see here it is numbers 21 give me that brother Jason numbers 21 4-6 we should read it this is tempting Christ neither let us tempt Christ remember our ninth verse neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted or destroyed of serpents here it is here's what he's referring to numbers 21 4-6 and they journeyed from Mount hore by the way of the Red Sea to Compass the land of Edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way and the people spoke against God and against Moses wherefore have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness this is not just to Moses it's the god for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loatheth this light bread and the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of Israel died so we never we must never try to get Christ to serve us instead of us serving him they tried that and it didn't end well God launched an epidemic of poisonous snakes among them so very few make that Rapture the same lust for the world the same never coming to a new birth which you have to you can only surrender your way to see you you'll you'll choose whichever version of The Gospel that you wish was true idolaters chasing Idols of this oh what this crashing world chasing Idols come on teenagers chasing Idols from a crashing world oh my fornication spiritual physical Same Spirit self-serving attitude that literally pushes God past his limits of Mercy which you can exhaust not his grace Of course brother says you can never exhaust his grace he said but I have exhausted his Mercy many times murmuring against the word oh yeah they do it today where's the promise of his coming and that's not just his physical coming in fact is when you go to the to the Greek it's where is the promise of his parisia you might know the word more Perugia it's a mispronunciation of the Greek word where is the promise of his perusa his parasia for nothing has changed and all things are the same you see it's not it's not just about the coming of his physical coming it's where's This Promise of the word to be made flesh I can't even live from day to day as an overcomer where is the Holy Ghost I thought I was supposed to have power where's the promise I I was told that it would come upon me and it would change my whole nature it will if you get the real thing Hallelujah if you get the real fire breathing experience it'll change everything say well I still have to battle you of course you will you're still in an unconverted flesh but there's power Wonder working power in the blood of the lamb and in the word of this hour Hallelujah friends and that's the hour that we have arrived at this is why brother Brandon would talk about and I I said this to you uh recently about the term consummation the consummation of the ages and I've turned my last corner now you still with me all right I'm gonna take these last 15 minutes so we find then that brother Brandon would use this word more than 90 times curiously that I don't know who was responsible but you don't you won't find all of them if you don't it's even spelled differently in different ones and I'm not sure how that happened in the book on the tape it's always just the word consummation uh the consummation of the ages and brother Branham talks about it nearly a hundred times so it's an important topic you would agree consummation he starts talking about you know the consummation of the ages the consummation of the seals the consummation of everything it's the seven of all sevens it's the bride has now come full circle the word has went back to grain see laying I've been preaching on you she must lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened that's the problem and the bride he's got all kinds of problems in in the Azusa Revival those remnants of whatever's left of it but it's obvious he wasn't talking to the bride because they're he's hitting them for their painted face and their Jezebel ways and cutting their hair and wearing pants and Men drinking smoking Corrals and cussing so he's not talking about the bride we don't we don't stand for that in the message of the hour it's not not the not the real message and so but but he does come to the real message and say now there is a problem and the real message and that is we are a seed we have come back to grain but boy we're Mighty green we got to lay in the presence of the sun now I don't believe in just saying that forever he said he said that 60 years ago I mean eventually we've got to get mature right eventually you can't just keep saying well someday somewhere [Music] the rainbow it's right now it's right now the consummation of the ages the perfecting of the ages I was preaching you last time when I was on this subject that this is the time of all things yeah I mean and I encouraged you to say if you ever if you were ever tired of failing Now's the Time of all things all Victory all overcoming perfect faith if you're tired of being sick if you're tired of the devil pushing you around if you're tired of seeing your children drug around the world by an evil spirit good news this is the time of all things this is the time of full strength full faith perfect love perfect power this is the time to reach up and take a claim and take a hold of what God has done in your hour my goodness if you if you pass the greatest epic event in human history and you stay in failure then that's on you that's not on God that's not on your spouse your parents your pastor your deacons that's on you because you have come to the day of all things you're in the time of total freedom total Victory and it's for you it's the consummation consummation means the last part of a process or action as in the signing of the contract marked the consummation of six months of negotiations synonyms for consummation are closed closing conclusion finish end ending end game finale Grand Finale home stretch mop up wind up wrap up oh man words related to it Apex climax Crescendo culmination crowning are you ready for crowning high water mark a Meridian a peak a pinnacle a summon a top a tip top a Zenith a Capstone [Applause] that's what consummation means it's a Capstone it means an accomplishment an achievement an actuality an actualization an attainment of fruition this isn't anymore a pipe dream or a prophecy this is a fruition this is the fruit in the top of the Bright Tree ripening it means fulfillment it means realization this fulfillment is real time has met prophecy and we're not waiting any longer last Gentile Church age has seen the effects of the seals and the trumpets and the vials the prophecy is already in motion that's what you woke up to today you woke up to a torrent of motion and around the world can't see or feel and they're completely blind and unaware to it but to you who have had the word open to you and you've had your eyes open you realize wow this is the time when I can finally be a conqueror this is the time when I can be the possessor of all good things this is it it I love this one it means an aftermath it means an epilogue a final section of final section or speech after the main part of a book a play or a musical composition oh we've been playing this Symphony for a long time friends oh we've had crescendos and crescendos and we've had great musicians and they've come and gone and we had great worries of Faith Among Us and and and and and we lost a lot of our first chair violinists and thank God we had other ones to jump in the place we lost some of our pianists and God had other ones to jump in the place we lost some of our generals but God's got other ministers rising up young ministers even right now even right now friends say why this close to the Rapture why is God still calling young ministers because it was the Young Generation with Joshua that took the land Hallelujah friends we're marching to Zion beautiful beautiful Zion [Applause] brother Branham says and I read this to you the anointing time and sign what did he say Malachi 4 would restore back to the original Pentecostal faith this is the upper room now don't confuse that term that's a misnomer to call Azusa that they called themselves that because they thought they were the long-awaited restoration and brother Brandon went along with it just out of courtesy but he clearly showed in his teaching that that because they denominated it proved they were not what they thought they were they were only a portion of what was coming see so what did he say in Malachi 4 would restore restore back the original Pentecostal Faith that's the upper room that's Jubilee that's the abstract title put back into the hands of God's family again remember Adam lost it God gives it back Hallelujah I don't care what the devil has taken from you in this life in this day Jesus Christ gives it back you just rejoice in that I don't care what you've missed out on and you might have even been a party to it but Jesus Christ gives it back Hallelujah it doesn't matter how far away you find yourself this is the hour of all things Hallelujah back to the people with the same Pentecostal message the same Pentecostal sign the same Pentecostal evidence the same God the same power the same teaching and love this all-inclusive everything exactly with the Vindication of the same Pillar of Fire that struck Saul down on the road to Damascus in him is among us today doing the same signs that he did in that day say well sum it up in one word uniting that's what it's all about friends it's about uniting time and sign there if there's a uniting time and We Know by prophecy there is then there has to be a uniting sign maybe if it's a uniting time there has to be a uniting sign it can't just come and have no effect in the earth it has had an effect it has come out of her my people and come up into a new day arise shine thy light has come and it's literally changing a bride into the image of the word you see listen sometimes we can really get down on ourself and think and and let the devil you know play a sob story to us no I just fail and I fail and I fail again and after I failed and I fail I even fail at failing and fail some more and it might seemed like so many times and I read in the Bible and I hear these preachers saying oh it's such a wonderful thing I wish it was me I see everybody rejoicing oh I just wish I could Rejoice with them I wish I could feel like I was a part of that thing let me tell you something friends there is a uniting time and there has to be a uniting sign and that's you and that was always God's plan and don't don't despise the day of small things let me tell you something God is doing more in you than you're aware of I'm here to tell you while the world is falling away further and further and further you're getting closer and closer and closer while the world is going more and more crazy you're coming more and more into faith I know you might feel weak I know you might be a failure you might have had a failure on your way to church but I'm here to tell you God is in control he's in control of your lives and all he ever has needed what he needs is all he's ever needed a total surrender I mean listen this is exactly what the prophecy was where we read in book of Acts yeah you men of Galilee why are you standing here gazing at this don't you know there's a reality to be poured out you need to get going don't stand here and look all your hearts are sad he's going away but and you're bewildered and I want to go with him let you've got a mission let me give you some good news he said to him the same one that you've seen go up he'll come down just like you've seen him go up so just like you've seen this he'll do this you get that so it's going to be boom boom and when he goes up he sends me he that body lays on the altar and that life is sent back down into the church it came down just like it went up and when it came down It produced the body of Christ like the one that went up Church into a many membered body of the one man that ascended as you see him go so shall he come again and when he came again it went from 1 to 120 and it went from 120 to thousand and it went around the world and we're rejoicing in it today and now we've come to the end we've come to laodicea and now what's happening the very thing that came down and produced a body when that body at the end time goes up it'll be just like when he came down just like this that's all that's all that's happening in the same way he came and produced a body when he's ready to go up in a body he that ledeth will actually be taken out of the way that's Christ in the bride when that one came down in a many member body now he's ready to go up in a many-membered body and he'll go up just like he came down and there will be a body of Believers there'll be a people with the full authority of the word of God for this hour that's you that's the opportunity that's granted to you today how many want that opportunity oh let's stand to our feet let the let the bride Rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come and the pride has made herself ready as he went away so would he come again and when he goes away it'll be just like when he came it'll turn and transform a people into the Living Word and when they leave when they leave just like brother Henry greens to always say God started his church like he wanted it and now he wants it like he started it I just say I resemble that I identify with that I love that that's my whole purpose in life that's what I'm longing for that's what I'm living for and I know that that is true and I know I'm a part of it and I can't deny it and I I don't think I earn it I don't think I deserve it but I know I'm a part of it oh I could have never done it to myself but God rich and mercy has identified himself has he been unveiled to you today friends he's unveiled himself in his word to do what take a family at the end time up that looks just like the family when he came down because because it'll be him going up just like he came down amen it's like that the one that went up shall so come down and when he comes down he'll live in Seven Ages and then he'll go up and this one will look just like this one oh blessed be the name of the Lord why you gonna sing Anthony brother Anthony Sing for us oh I want to see him look upon
