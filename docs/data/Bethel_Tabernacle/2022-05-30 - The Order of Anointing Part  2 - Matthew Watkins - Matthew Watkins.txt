did not see but i believe when jesus died he died for me [Music] i never knew [Music] and i never saw the crowd of force that my jesus wore and i never saw the lowly hill that they call calvary no i never saw it but i believe he died for me and every step that he took a calvary [Music] and every drop drop of bloody shed for me there's a lot of things i did not see but i believe when jesus died he died for me [Music] i never saw the rusty nails they drove in his hands and feet when i never heard him cry to the father why hast thou forsaken me and i never saw the roman soldiers as they pierced him in his side but when he hung his head in the locks of his shoulders heavily for me he died and every step that he's moved [Music] for me there's a lot of things oh thank you jesus i did not [Music] i see when jesus died he died for me and every step [Music] drop of bloody i did not see but i believe when jesus died he died for me [Applause] thank you for that you know you know down my way they got a river down there they call the pascagoula river but the locals the locals call it the singing river i was baptized in that river i tied a man preacher all 80 year old preacher off to a tree and that was a very swift current i tied him off to a tree so they wouldn't get the best of him and uh and but you know down south there there's rivers like that they call the singing river but you know the down south there in the slave times to get the message out they would sing it in the fields you know there was they would sing it out you know songs have messages in them and they would sing like down by the river and then everybody would go yes lord down by the river late at night on a rainy night and they would follow through so that way there the fields and all the work hands if they was getting ready for their jubilee they would sing and they would know what to do right there in the field so i'm going to see if you get this message if you get this mess if you miss me [Music]

go unseen but when pilate cried i'll beat him he pointed straight to me [Music] my friends they all cheered me as i took the whip in hand and placed some stripes up on the back of this guiltless man

amen this morning you love the lord are you ready for the word amen to come with an expectation i know that i did expecting to hear from the lord this morning revelations chapter 10 let's just begin reading at verse one and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried notice with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he had cry when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swore by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that are therein just dropped me bring me back up if you could seems like i lost it there and the earth and the things that are the and the earth and the things that therein are in the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice are you glad we're living in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets let's just bow our heads we're gonna we're gonna continue reading but let's stop there lord we thank you father for your presence i know lord that everyone who's gathered here today lord came not to hear me father but they came to hear from heaven they came to have a divine communication a channel lord where you could reveal yourself to them in a greater way i know that every person here would lord have a desire just to know you more we came today lord because we love you that's why everyone who's gathered here today they came because they have a love for you and for your word they're gathered here lord now waiting for you to speak i pray god that you would come lord and do what i can't do my words are just just feeble words lord of a man who can fail but your word lord is eternal and we look to it today i pray you bless each and every single one for these needs that were written in for my mother-in-law may you be a healer to her right now jesus may you go to her lord in her living room father may the great physician just come and visit her god pray you'd relieve all of these symptoms lord of pain father for brother ken sister jennifer the johnson's lord traveling may you bring them here to us safely lord and i pray that you would continue to touch their family lord for each and every single one of us here today we ask that you would just receive our worship as we enter in now in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated this morning amen we spoke last sunday and i'm just going to have you if you could have that powerpoint ready brother caleb we spoke last sunday of the the order of the anointing and i'm not going to do too much recap of what we spoke on but we're just going to pick up from where we left off and never so much i didn't get to that i'm i'm just thankful the lord gave us this opportunity to share this uh to you but we spoke and took uh showed you the the faith of peter and how that peter's faith was so different before and after the upper room and peter's faith which seemed really profound and lord i'll never deny you and and uh i'll never forsake you and and here's peter's broad and bold and uh faith that he speaks and and yet just a little while later we read in the book of luke how that jesus said before the crows three times you'll deny me peter oh lord i'll never deny you i i would never walk away from the message i would never walk away from where else would i go this is the same man who spoke these same exact words so words are good it's good for the redeemed to say so we believe in the in words we believe in verbalizing our faith but verbal faith isn't enough as we took time to show you intellectual faith just saying that you believe it's an important step it's important that we profess and we confess what we believe but ultimately what we find out is that when peter's faith was put to the test and he was under the pressure his faith failed him and so we say it was an anointing that we spoke on and we read the quote and i'm not i don't think i had it here on our slide uh i don't think that i do but so i'm just gonna i'm just going to reference it today but we spoke about how that brother branham speaks of the anointing that can come on the flesh and he spoke of david and the revival and if you're going to read the rest of that quote and trying to do god a service without it being his will brother branham talks about how that they were hooping and hollering and shouting and he said he had all the signs of a revival but it wasn't god at all so he shows how that the holy spirit could come and anoint your flesh it could anoint your flesh and you can jump up and down and you could shout the mind and you could understand things and you can maybe intellectually rationalize and see something yet that not really be god at all uh it could be a step of god bringing you towards something but brother branham says that all depends on the he says it all depends on the order of the anointing and so it was it was something that would happen to peter after pentecost that would be different than what he had prior jesus says he that believeth on me shall out of his belly flow rivers of living water if you go read i think that's matthew 7 and if you go and read the parentheses in your king james bible it says but he spoke of the spirit which had not yet been given so there was an anointing there was an anointing of the spirit that had been given to shamgar that's how he just just slayed the philistines there was an anointing of the holy ghost that came upon david and so much that he would pray i pray that your spirit your holy spirit depart not from me right so the anointing that came upon him to slay goliath there was an anointing of the holy spirit that came upon shadrach meshach and abednego for them to face the fiery furnace but yet what was going to take place in the upper room was going to be different than anything that anyone had ever experienced before because now that spirit that dwelt in christ would be poured out to a church and it would be greater than an anointing on your flesh it would be greater than an anointing on your on your spirit but it would be an anointing or a tabernacling of the presence of god in your soul and so what we our goal here today are the marker the goal that we're striving for is not to hoop up and hype up an anointed spirit of god when it comes and i feel my feet get to dancing but my goal is to say lord move it beyond my intellectual room move it beyond my human emotional realm and let it sink into the soul to where the gates of hell can't prevail against that amen so it's not based upon feeling let me just say the message of the hour the revival of the message of the hour was not an emotional revival it was not an intellectual revival it was a word revival and that word revival brings knowledge of the word and it brings emotion because it's the full unveiling of christ and all of his person and so not in the human spirit but the true conversion of the heart takes place in the soul and it's not based upon feelings and it's not based upon what you understand and what you don't understand amen it's based upon a revelation from god listen to what we we took time and we showed how that brother branham stood in the middle of the road and you know that there's always that see-saw effect and any time you get take the see-saw all the way down this way and then you you got it you got to we got to correct that so so we take the see-saw the other way and brother branham said there's always two ditches between calvinism armenism one example that he uses right towards a baptist uh intellectual conception and a frolic or a fanaticism of pentecost and brother branham says there's two ditches and he says but the bride goes right through the middle calling upon both of them amen right listen to what the prophet says i love this so much and you can just display the first slide and the greatest news flash in history he says some people make the gospel if you could advance brother caleb stay stay with me this morning because i got a lot of a lot of slides some people make the gospel a funeral procession [Music] that's right they go to church and just like it was a funeral possession others make it a frolic that's right some of them just make it a frolic just make it a just a big time to go and play a bunch of music jump up and down on a platform dance all over the platformer down in the aisle and run and sit down and talk about their neighbors are you with me that's right some of them thinks they ought to stand and say the doxology and the apostles creed so-called you you so he could look at a dead dying body he could look in the mirror and he could see stoop shoulders he could see sarah who had wrinkles was way past the age of giving birth sarah and abraham could wake up every day and look in the mirror and see their current condition and look at the promise of the word and choose to deny what they've seen with their eyes and believe what the word of god said about them this is the characteristic of a true believer when you can look beyond yourself oh come on somebody when you can look beyond your inadequacies and your failures and you can look to what the word said about you and say i choose to believe this and cast down any vain imaginations and he says though he's called a con church though it wasn't so now faith that's what faith is is the revelation of god the church is built upon the revelation the whole entire body amen so we get this question as we spoke on last time that it's do you you we spoke on all the different philosophies of history and we spoke on romanticism and and all of these isms that you have and rationalism and and so we we look at this and we say well you know if if you could if you couldn't actually vindicate i was asked this question if we could not actually vindicate the message of the hour by facts and that was the word this person was using by facts i want to read you the definition of fact you can mute that for a second a fact means a thing that is indisputably the case that's what a fact is so let me show you what the difference between fact a thing that is indisputably the case versus what revelation means revelation is the supernatural communication of truth to the mind [Music] you know what that means that means no one else's no one i'm not i was going to say no one else's opinion matters let me rephrase that no one has an opinion when revelation strikes your heart all opinions are off to abraham it wasn't the opinion of anybody it was it was elohim who revealed himself to abraham and that was where his faith was rested not on intellect so some people mentally believe they intellectually as peter followed jesus up until that point intellectually mentally and they could have great professions of faith as peter did i'll never deny you lord but when the real test comes they show their true colors and so some people can mentally believe they can mentally follow the message of the hour because because why because my parents told me this was truth because mom and dad told me this was true then i was raised and their mom and dad told their mom and dad and their mom and dad told their mom and dad and you know you can get a believer a person in church who is there at church at a message church believing confessing mentally intellectually brother man are you criticizing i'm not criticizing that at all that's very normal and very natural but the necessity is is that that changes from mom and dad taught me and mom and dad told mom and dad and mom and dad told mom and dad and it's based upon facts because they have facts of indication of facts you see that'll never hold you but when that changes from fact and changes from mom and dad and elohim himself comes to that individual and supernaturally communicates the truth of the word of god and you know what that means mom and dad can walk away and my mom and grandpa and grandma can walk away and the pastor can walk away but that faith will still hold you hallelujah that faith will still hold you it's your rock it's your revelation and nothing can shake that jesus said upon this rock i'll build my church it's amazing what things reveal what people's faith is really anchored in you see people who follow the message for years and then watch maybe based upon the revelation or the experience of their grandpa who was a pastor or the grandma who was a pa a wife of a pastor and they got this experience and then watched when grandpa goes off the scene and grandma goes off the scene and they're no longer there they hold for a little while but eventually because that was what was anchoring them when my mom and dad or grandma and grandpa leave now that anchor's been ripped loose and they're floating like a boat in the tide and they'll hold them for a little while but before you know it they're way downstream so some people believe this by because well the message is vindicated by facts some follow let me tell you some follow the bible not just believers some people go to church and claim christianity but for the same reasons well historically it's factually proven and scientifically proven but let me just say this i'm just going to cut through the chase here the message nor the bible can be vindicated but because everybody's opinions always change and everybody is an arbiter of their own truth so is it was it meant to be based upon scientific evidence and that we understand this by facts some people follow brother from some people follow the bible this way but let me tell you what history says as we said last sunday historically pilate never existed right factually by the facts by the facts you know what most people's facts are is www.google.com and that's gospel man that is the truth just just type it out and certain people it's sad because nowadays they don't even look at the you don't even go through and research actual articles you just look at the first ansel google gives you it's like people when they feel uh heart pain associated with our chest pain associated with shoulder pain and the ears itching what is that the symptom of cancer oh i got cancer and they go to the doctor i diagnose myself i need to be treated right now it's amazing how quickly people just believe anything that they want to believe or anything that they read and let me just say this pilate never existed by the facts until 1962 when some archaeologists discovered an archaeological site a a inscription in a column and it was the seal of pontus pilot and you know what all of those people who said pilate never existed now go well i guess intellectually i got scientifically by fact he did actually exist you know what my faith didn't change when i found out they found pilate's inscription i believe that pilate existed before the inscription was found i believe he existed before when science said he never did science today says the messiah never existed he never walked he was in a different time frame or error than even the apostle paul does that shake your faith brother man no because my faith isn't resting on the failure or the fruit the the the futility of man's mind or his understanding my faith is resting in nothing less than the revelation of god himself revealing himself to me can you say amen so it's a revelation it's a revelation and it's not just well in the message we just have a it's just we just have a greater understanding i've heard people say that very sincerely well what's the difference between the baptist church and the message of the hour well in the message we just have a little bit more understanding of what the bible says friends if that's all the message is to you you've never had a revelation of the message of the hour right never and that's okay that's where some people are at here today that's why we're preaching here today amen not here to criticize you or to kick you i'm here to help you yeah amen oh it's just a little bit further it's just we just got a little bit more light so the way you said to the man why is that important because the way you view the message is very important and crucial to how you're going to live amen how you view the message of the hour the same exact way with how you view the bible if you don't believe the bible is the infallible word of god it will determine how you live your life it will make up the way you view the world it will make up the way that you view god it will make up the way you view tragedy when tragedy strikes it will may it will shape and define the way you go through sorrow when you lose a loved one based upon how you view the word of god amen so let me just say this the message the elected bride of christ it's not just another level it's not just a well we're just on a different level no no friends to be the bride is an entirely different calling amen than the church it's an entirely different calling altogether it's god's choice and not yours and not your moms and not your dads and not your enemies thank god it's god's choice and god chooses he didn't choose israel because of their behavior or because of their looks or how great they were but they were dirt daubers as the prophet of god called them just tent dwellers but israel wasn't just on another level than every other nation they were totally the bible says separated unto god for his own good pleasure god loved all humanity but he showed a special love to abraham's seed they were elected by grace let me just say the message of the hour is an election by nothing else than grace upon grace upon grace it's amazing to me and i'm just going to take time to go through this before we get to some of our slides it's incredible how people want to come years years after brother branham leaves the scene and they start to question his honesty and they start to question his vindication and start to question as we said last sunday it would be like questioning if we had no youtube videos to show us mike tyson's best top 10 knockouts it'd be like me showing you who who was who was one of uh mike tyson's uh greatest you can name ten of them greatest knockouts go to this highlight reel it'd be the same as if we didn't have the proof or the youtube video and then mike tyson was just a story that was told by your dad and your dad's dad told him and then his dad told him and oh my iron mike they caught him why did they call him iron mic oh you should have seen his left hook you should have seen his jab you should have seen the incredible mic it'd be like me going you know what i don't you know mike mike was good i'm sure mike was good but i think i could have took mike i think mike would hold anything to me could you imagine how dumb that would be how foolish mike really wasn't nothing you know go ask the top 10 men who are laying on the mat about mike tyson's left hook go ask him about his jab go ask him if he was all that oh it's the same exact way you go ask cancer if brother branham was a vindicated prophet go ask tuberculosis if he was a dishonest man who just made everything up you go ask death himself and i promise you you'll get a different testimony than some of these that you see on google.com [Applause] go ask brother edmund way go ask for the edmond way when brother branham tells in the sermon and he tells about the cloud the supernatural cloud that appeared over flagstaff arizona and brother branham tell us about it you've seen it there in the magazine the constellation of seven angels you know what happened in that service brother way passed away was dead a nurse there on the scene checked his pulse and he was dead god through the through the ministry of brother branham raised that man from the dead yeah so you go ask death himself what he thought about brother branham yeah hello it's amazing how man's thoughts are exalted to such a place that they can't even see how foolish they really are romans chapter 1 verse 21 in the screen if you could put it up romans chapter 1 verse 21 because that listen when they knew god when they knew god now that's an important word when they because of what's going to follow when they knew this is the word for gnosis it means to intellectually know something to know it based upon fact when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations vain means what to exalt yourself they became vain they be they exalted their imagination this is saying when they knew god intellectually then their intellect became their god and their intellectual understanding replaced what god's word said but became vain in their imagination and their foolish heart was darkened notice professing themselves to be wise they became fools professing themselves to be wise they became fools skipped in verse 25 who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshiped and served the creature yeah amen this is the creature this is the creature they worshipped and served the creature more than the creator and paul can't even take that he just writes it in there who is blessed forever amen amen they worship the creature more than the creator for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change their natural use and of that which is against nature and likewise the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lusts one towards another men with men working that which is unseemingly and receiving what what brother how did we get to this because they exalted the creature above the creator because they became vain in their own imagination they believed so much they had so much confidence in their science they had so much confidence in their google facts they had so much confidence in their education they had so much confidence in critical thinking and scholars and philosophy that it eventually explained away the word of god you say brother matt that leads to this let me just say this and as a warning i'm going to say it to everybody that's here but especially our young people when you leave the truth of the message of the hour it is a bottomless pit amen when you lose the stability that the word of god brings and you leave the message yes this is what happens yeah amen you say that not all of them some of them know you're right some of them go worse than that worse than fleshly outward sins they become religious which brother branham says the hardest demon to break more than more than alcohol more than drugs is a religious spirit and he says in verse 20 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate isn't that interesting that's in there hello what's the first people that want to debate you when they leave the message oh i'll give me a debate they become full of wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things we could speak a lot about that disobedient to parents without understanding covenant breakers without natural affection implacable and merciful who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure and film that do them is isn't it incredible to you how these men and women who leave the message of the hour are so emboldened by their new found freedom just so emboldened by this new found freedom even becoming more bold and more religious than they ever were sitting in church amen and they don't just leave the message but now they become anti-message we could speak about you said brother matt you're speaking people leave the message i'm talking about anyone who leaves the faith same exact thing that happens you go and watch anybody who becomes an atheist after years two men i used to watch their youtube videos hilarious rhett and link someone had showed me a few videos of there some funny just comical videos watched two or three of them funny guys they were professed christians leaders of the uh of the the the um the promise keepers movement great evangelical movement here in the states they were two proponents two of the leaders of that group and they did an entire series on there i forget that i think they called it their deconstruction of faith how they looked into the facts of jesus they realized how messy the facts of jesus were how messy they lost they first you know what they said their first the first thing that they lost was their faith in the old testament lost their faith in the validity of the old testament then it went from there and it's a bottomless pit and it went from there to there to there to there to there it's so incredible as i was just looking at this yesterday evening it's so incredible that they don't just leave the faith they become anti-faith evangelists they don't realize they're fulfilling the scripture professing them to be wise they become fools how foolish is it in reality here's what exactly what they're saying i've been living this is what i'm going to profess this is what they're saying i've been living and preaching and uh teaching something boldly for 20 years i've been behind this pulpit i've been preaching it i've been living it i've been teaching it for 20 years i've led generations i've led generations of people with my teachings but now i no longer believe them therefore i'm going to boldly and loudly tell people it was all wrong while i boldly and loudly lead people into my next truth [Applause] there's there's no shame there's no bow was wrong they don't question themselves same people leave the message i was wrong for i preached it and taught it and lived it for 20 years but now it's wrong so now i'm going to bold i preached it boldly and loudly so now i'm going to boldly and loudly teach you to follow me they there's the problem you don't follow a person who doesn't even know where they're going you don't follow a person who has no direction they're just aimlessly questioning and doubting everything they have no answers they only have more questions because they appeal to the intellectual reasoning of man they have eve's interpreter as brother branham would say amen they've appealed to the human intellectual reasoning of man why are they so eager to lead people when you can clearly see they have no idea where they're heading so you say brother matt what does this mean it's there's got to come a difference between an intellectual faith or an intellectual understanding of something or an anointing upon your flesh to make you shout or an anointing upon your flesh to make you dance or an anointing upon your mind to make you understand and become a theologian of the word thank god for emotion thank god for understanding thank god for teachers we need them yes amen but there's got to come something that moves beyond your mind beyond your flesh and it anchors [Music] i'm going to move from that i've got a lot more but we just we just won't say you say there brother matt they're just ex-message believers the fact is they never were believers in the first place they weren't ex-believers like an ex an x that you are away from it's a it's a they never were a believer in the first place because to be a believer is not to say i confess this or i believe this or i understand this because intellectually i understand it but to believe a to be a believer peter understood and peter found out that there had to come something in his life that was greater than all of his human mind can understand amen so what would happen even brother branham would stand in between these two listen to this if you could put my powerpoint back up brother branham would would come in between these two so so what would you have and i don't have we're gonna have to just skip through this some of this so i'm just gonna move quickly it's 12 30 now just give me just a little bit longer i'm not going to tell you how much longer but give me a little bit longer so so you say brother matt what is it what does it mean then what is the opening of the word we read in revelations chapter 10 how that i hear john if you could you could turn in your bible with me let's let's pick that up that's where we should go right now john chapter 10. notice you could put it on the screen for me revelations chapter 10 let's read about this remember what we said last sunday this is revelation the book of revelation is not john's book john didn't write john on the isle of patmos did not write the book of revelation john was just the scribe jesus was the author strong angel noticed this and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud rainbow was on his head let's move on down to verse five verse seven but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me now this is john and john is a type of the bride that's good and i'm glad we can say that and that's a cliche but i want you to put your name there i want you to say john is a type of me john is a type of me i stood there and heard the mighty heard they heard that voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel go back verse eight uh he says in verse eight he says with a voice i heard from heaven said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the scene upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book you see what happens when the preacher shows you the open book by the preaching of the word and he preaches the message of the hour and then you stand and say give me that book that's not just your book that's my book amen when it becomes your inheritance when every promise in the book is your promise not just a promise to a church not just a promise to a prophet it's your inheritance in the holy spirit john says he says go and get the little book and i went into the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and he said unto me you know the voice of the lord is telling you here today take it take every promise that the word has said and take it for yourself you need a promise for healing take it you need a promise for salvation take it need a promise for your for your children take it need a promise for your home take it need a promise for your mind the angel is saying it's one thing to say i believe it but it's another thing for the person the bride to stand up and say give me that little book it's my promise it's my inheritance amen and he said take it and eat it up eat it up eat up the open word eat up the message of the hour eat up christ the mystery of god revealed eat him consume him let it be your daily bread and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey it may may not may be hard to understand and hard to hard to hard to hard to swallow but when you believe it and you speak it it'll be sweet as honey when it comes out of your mouth so john says he says give me the little book take it eat it up and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth just as the angel said it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i'd eaten my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people and nations and tongues and kings so what was this this was the opening this was the word the little book the open book remember it was a little book open in the hands of the angel see you say brother that what is the opening of the word let me make it i'm going to oversimplify this so you though that are streaming and hear me say this don't think i'm st this isn't this isn't all there is to it but let me oversimplify it someone asked me a young person said brother matt what does it mean what does the opening of the word mean let me open this oh let me oversimplify it means the opening of this bible to you a book that had been sealed and men had probed that and men had thought and given their ideas and it must mean this and it must mean that when the word is opened it's the bible being open to you and you say ah it's my book i see myself in there so the message of the hour what is it it was the son of man christ himself revealing himself or opening himself or unveiling himself what do you read when you read the message of the hour you're reading the opening or the unveiling of god and he's identified by his word he was identified that's why god vindicated him with signs and wonders that's why jesus said you believe in god believe also in me jesus says you don't believe you don't believe me then believe that works that i do right for they testify to you of who i am you don't believe what i say then believe the works that i do for they testify to you of who i am what was the vindication for not so that we could all say oh it's vindicated it's unquestionable it's scientifically proven no it's so that you have confidence and faith faith that this message was not from a man it was from the throne room of god amen and it was a shady eye it was all elohim it was jehovah himself speaking and communicating himself to you that's why there was a melchizedek sign and brother branham would turn his back to the audience and begin with his back to the audience start to discern hearts what was he showing the same way melchizedek turned his back and said sarah laughed it was a melchizedek sign not to lift up a man but to raise your faith it was sin to raise your faith oh if we ever needed anything then our church today is that our faith would be raised so that we could believe every promise in the book is mine amen it was the sign through a prophet the word was made flesh and lived behind skin yeah so we're not living in the age of a partial truth we're not living in the days of luther or wesley where they had a partial understanding we're living in the understanding of the fullness of god i'm going to emphasize some of these things here today so that you can take them home and remember them we are living in the age of the fullness of everything god was the fullness of everything god promised is now yours and let me just say don't settle for less don't let anybody sell you anything less it is the fullness of god amen it is the full inheritance not partial truth but it was the fullness of what was promised to be revealed of who god is who god was and who he is today amen we have the seven sealed mystery of christ revealed throughout history what was the seven church ages brother branham says that revelation of the seven church ages was upon which every other revelation would come amen that the book of revelation was the gentile dispensation it was history or his story it was all of time from the beginning in the garden the message of the hour starts as brother jason of mars preached and taught so beautifully today it was showing you two seeds that were in the very beginning the origin of everything and it didn't just show you the beginning and it didn't just show you the end but it showed you everything in between [Applause] and it doesn't just reveal to you who christ was or who he's going to be but who he is right now it was the full seven sealed mystery revealed through history and let me say this it's only the revelation of that is only given to the elected seed who was predestinated before the world began to see it and she sees it not by knowledge or intellect but by revelation and that can only come when you're born of the spirit of god jesus said unless a man is born of the spirit of god he can never see the kingdom of heaven he may understand intellectual and maybe understand certain concepts and principles in the word but the true mystery of the revelation of the kingdom of god can only be open to him when he's born of the supernatural birth of christ that's why we preach you must be born again can you say amen it can only come by a new birth by a pentecostal i'm not speaking of azusa street i'm speaking of the book of acts can only come the same way they were born as the same way you've got to be born we haven't been restored past paul's message we've been restored to paul's message why did brother branham say all the voices when he said i would paul be judged yes paul will be judged will he be accepted he'll be accepted brother of adam says well good then i'll be accepted because i preached what paul preached and the voices of thousands that was my voice that was your voice try it out we're resting upon that [Applause] amen it was the revelation of the bible the open book yes and let me say this outside of that revelation anything else is just an intellectual head knowledge that won't hold you right anything outside of that remember it's the order of the anointing anything outside of that is an anointing on your flesh or an anointing in your mind and it'll never hold you didn't hold peter right now right it's got to be a revelation faith is a revelation faith oh can you say amen faith is a revelation listen what brother branham says about it here and he says i didn't have time to put this but i'm just going to read it to you the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be over emphasized revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize when god reveals himself to you amen personally amen jesus said the gates of hell can't prevail against that when god reveals himself brother adam tells us in the seat is not air with the shuck listen to this he tells us this and you could you can display that slide then the next slide there for me brother caleb brother madam tells us and the seat is not ever there with a shot that this happened at the opening now they could produce that justification will save a man you believe that sure it was a carrier of the word just the same as i believe the stalk is a part of the wheat sure it is but it's the carrier it ain't the life then along came sanctification how many believes in sanctification you believe the bible you have to sure so still that's not it's a little more like that's two more words so everything the church had everything denominations had everything all the reformers had everything luther had everything all the man and the men the men under the man anointing under the intellectual age when there was an intellectual anointing that came upon the mind of man all of that was a step but then come to penick but he says but then come the pentecost the restoration of the gifts speak it in tongues they call it the initial evidence of the holy ghost speaking in tongues they call that the initial evidence which brought forth the what the shock but they denominated but when you come to say i and my father are one amen when brother burnham came to the third pool of his ministry and it was no more signs of healing it was no more sign in the hand it was no more just prophecy and a prophet prophesying but he said the crowning capstone the third pull of my ministry was not another healing revival it wasn't notice it wasn't another intellectual revival it wasn't another emotional revival but he said when i stood in sabino canyon and the sword struck my hand and the voice said this is not a king this is the king's sword it's the word of the lord amen it's the revelation of the word it's the crowning of your ministry people didn't want that ah we go back to the healing go back to why because people want to dwell in either the intellectual realm or they want to dwell in the emotional realm go back to a healing revival brother branham have another tent brother adam says what was it they're rejecting they've wrecked they failed to recognize the awakening of the bride and he says when you come to say i and my father are one of these other things then the shuck pulls away but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of god in its fullness and in its strength for he's the same yesterday today and forever so brother branham's ministry what was it he tells us in the seat is not air with the shock this happens at the opening of the seven seals revelations 10 is that the full word is to be born in manifestation vindicated by the spirit of god in the full strength as christ did when he was here on earth so brother branham's ministry was the revealing of that son of man this is what the open bible brings you this is what the opening of the word is to bring we've moved from partial to full reality he says now they still won't believe it go to the next slide i think that's what i've got the next slide for the kingdom witnesses yes let me let me stop at this i forgot to have this in here as we said ask mike tysons victims what they thought about iron mike let's hear some what some of the witnesses say gordon lindsay never had we known of any preacher calling deaf mutes and blind people to prayer for and then to see those people delivered on the spot a ministry that was beyond any that we had before witnessed amen go to the next one he says it was branham this is the book the preachers and i had the names of let me just pull them up so that we have them here i thought that i put them in there but i didn't this is oh it is in the pictures good this is james morris author of this book it was branham more than any other evangelist who started the post-world war ii fundamentalist healing revival following his encounter with an angel on may 7 1946 word radiated listen word radiated in every direction that all manner of diseases and afflictions were healed instantly by the little indiana preacher even cases of raising the dead were published amen gordon this is t.l osborne god has chosen diverse and mysterious ways to reveal himself to his servants especially those called for the dispensational purposes as was brother branham's call in short the man we know is william branham was sent to demonstrate god again in flesh go and try to go back go and try to find any other man who you have multitudes of his peers multitude of his contemporaries saying this about his ministry you won't find it go to the next one brother caleb christ the hiller f bosworth when the gift is operating brother branham is the most sensitive person to the presence and working of the holy spirit and the spiritual realities of any person i've ever known next god called this is morris this is a a didn't have the man's name here uh uh yeah this is george acharoth god called this humble man and anointed his ministry to a degree that within a few short years his name was known in the most remote jungle outstation wherever you would go in this world you would find that the name of this messenger has preceded you wow amen even the jungles of africa voice of healing in bible days there were men of god who were prophets and seers but in all those secret records none of these had a greater ministry than that of william bran i'm a prophet and seer of god whose photograph appears on the front cover of this issue a full gospel of full gospel men's voice branham has been used by god in the name of jesus to raise the dead amen have you ever had any go back have you ever heard any other healing revivalist have you ever got any other facebook sponsored message for an event of a preacher come into your local city to raise the dead now we laugh and that's okay have we have we had any other ministry come to our men are saying that william branham's ministry was to reveal jesus christ in flesh again what was it we've moved from this partial to a full reality notice the next slide brother caleb now still they won't believe it jesus promised that as it was in the days of noah it was in the days of lot it would be in the last day we've got it we've got it jesus promised as it was in the days of lot as it was in the days of noah brother branham says we've got it it's here it's already vindicated just how many scriptures in sodom age what happened to abraham would return back again abraham's royal seed which is in christ christ returning in the form of the word working in human beings aha so it was more than just a glam show it was more than just glamour it was more than just oh oh it was greater than barnum and bailey's circus it was more than any kind of special event that you could go to it was christ returning in the form of his word do we realize what god sent when he sent the message of the hour it wasn't just another show it wasn't just another healer it wasn't just another revival it was christ returning amen he said brother jesus is returning he is in his corporate body he's coming but remember his coming happens in three phases it was christ returning in the form of his word working in human beings showing the signs that he promised he would say he would sign it would do he says he promised that he would do it god promised and god keeps his promise so his return the return of christ what are we waiting on i'm just waiting on the return of the lord i'm just waiting on the return and i'm here waiting with you we're waiting for the corporal brother adam says you he says i believe in a corporal physical resurrection and i believe in a corporal return of the lord jesus that's what believers believe i believe that go back that's what believers believe and i believe that but notice his coming his returning the second coming of christ was going to happen in three phases not just one event right but it would be one event that happens in three phases notice revelations 10 and i saw another mighty angel come down you follow that i saw another mighty angel come down so if you're coming down from heaven it must mean you're coming to earth i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud of the rainbow was upon his head his face was aware of the sun see his pillars of fire he added his hand a little book open and set his right feet foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth cried with a loud voice notice this first thessalonians 4 the next slide for the lord himself shall come down yes for the lord himself shall descend from heaven first thessalonians 4 revelations 10 i saw another mighty angel come down first thessalonians 4 he says for the lord himself next slide to the caleb shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump there's your three phases he first descends with a shout what was a shout a message then a voice a people becoming the message and the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord go to the next slide so what was this he said oh brother matt that's just a picture that's just a photo that's just something that time magazine took this was the coming this was the returning this was the headship to the body it was more than just a supernatural cloud it was more than just another sign in the heaven it was the sign in the heaven that was representing something had happened something different than what luther had something different than what john wesley had something different than what pentecost had now the head the headship is returning it was the constellation of seven angels brother man says what was it he says it was a message it was a it was it was the word of the lord brother and says where i received my commission to go back to jeffersonville and preach the seventh opening of the seven seas so the mighty angel descends as we read in revelations 10 with an open book he descends with an open book the seals are now opened and the seven thunders utter their voices what does that do brother matt those seven thunders communicate the mysteries right yeah of the book to the people who can receive them and not everybody can receive them a lot of people can understand them but not everybody can receive them so what was that to do it was to communicate the mysteries to you are you glad to this morning it was to communicate the mysteries by the seventh church age messenger which was one of the stars in the seven stars in the hand of god he was one of the seven eyes that went to and fro i know this is all elementary but i just felt led the the holy spirit stopped me last night was going to go a totally different direction and god constrained me and said right now this you this is what you're going to minister and i'm going to i'm going to say this i want the young people everybody to be listening but more than ever before i want the youth to be listening to what i'm preaching here today because let me just say this this isn't mom and dad's book this is your book this isn't mom and dad's message this is your message oh can i get an amen from the parents it's got to move beyond their message it's got to become your message it's got to become your book that you take and you consume and you eat it communicates the mysteries by the seventh church age messenger brother branham that the seven seals were opened not by a prophet the seven seals were opened by christ amen it was christ returning and brother adam wasn't jesus christ amen some people make him jesus christ he wasn't jesus christ some people make him just anybody he was just a reformer he wasn't a reformer some people make him just a prophet he was more than a prophet he was a church-age messenger [Applause] you see how important it is to stay in the middle of the road and don't go to either ditch but withdrawal from the ditches some people say only play tapes other people say don't play any tapes i play tapes almost every single day we need the tapes we need preachers we need teachers we need understanding we need emotion we need feeling we need revival we need everything the lord wanted to give us when he gave us the opening of the word it was the opening of the full understanding the fullness of christ he says the seven thunders let me move through this he says the seven thunders so what was this this was the beginning of the return the shout was the beginning of the rapture the rapture that everybody's waiting for has already started amen it was the beginning of the rapture and there's people who are literally not figuratively they are literally caught in the cyclone they're called in the vortex and while others can't feel it they can feel it and while others can't see it they can see it while others have no sense of it just another preacher yelling and screaming and spitting other people enter into the revival this was the beginning he does three things when he descends young people so there isn't just one event of the return of the lord but there are three phases there's a shout a voice and a trump and that last trumpet brings the dead dead saints so the other two phases must happen before the resurrection of the dead right before he could return so brother then why did god send us a vindicated message why was it so thoroughly vindicated you know what god was going to do he was going to remove every doubt of who he was he was going to so thoroughly and emphatically vindicate his messenger so that you knew this message was not from brother branham it was from god amen he was going to remove all doubts he was going to remove all questions was he three is he two is he one was it an apple was the white horse right or christ who is it you see men probe at that book of revelation they have no understanding they guess at it they probe at it they guess at it they probe at it but god was going to release the full revelation of the mystery to his people he was going to fully and thoroughly vindicate it to remove before god can judge the world brother branham says this in the message the trial he says before god can ever judge the world of sin he first must vindicate he first must send a messenger to show who truth a message of what truth is to be judged by amen right so before he could judge the world he first had to thoroughly show himself that he's the same yesterday today and forever culture changes education changes america changes they change every four or eight years but god never changes his word's still applicable his word still applies his word doesn't degrade we don't water it down because the culture changes it's still the same voice so he thoroughly vindicated himself thoroughly revealed himself to remove all doubt it wasn't to lift up a man it was to lift up christ in that man so that you would accept the message that that man brought that it wasn't the man's message it was christ it was the mighty angel descending it was to remove all doubts you know what the cloud brought the cloud was to remove all clouds came up with that myself thought it was good cloud i had that in my notes did a little shouting jubilee in the back the cloud was to remove all clouds all clouds of dow all clouds of question all clouds of obscurity is he two is he three is he this is he that this church says this this church says that this church this preacher said this then he changed his view then ten years later he reformed he moved from charismatic and nazi evangelical now he moves from evangelical now he's a hillsong pastor now he pastors and now he's the now he moved from that to the music ministry and he's well known and he writes i think 38 songs then two years later he denounces everything he's ever believed and says he's not a christian anymore makes a facebook post balling his eyes out saying how good it feels to say i'm not a christian aren't you so glad your faith does not build on any man or any emotion or any experience and not any on any person it's based on christ who has revealed himself to you and the gates of hell can't shake that money can't buy that popularity can't give you that but god in his grace and mercy revealed it to you it was fully unveiled it was to remove all obscurity of who jesus was so that there was no excuse he was fully unveiled all misconceptions of who jesus is was removed all misunderstandings were removed it unlocked the mysteries of the bible and it became an open book but notice this before his physical corporal coming he descends with an open book the word was revealed and given to john a type of the bride and then john eats the word and he becomes the word as god said to moses i'm come down notice i god said to moses the children of israel i've come down to deliver my people but who did his people see moses right hello but who was it it was god delivering his people people seen a prophet of kentucky hillbilly but it was jesus who i see [Music] it was christ it was christ veiled behind skin it's a razor's edge there's a ditch on the left there's a ditch on the right but the bride stays right in the amen the prophet came down in the same way god sent us to moses but it was the lord who descended it was him the lord himself shall descend i'm not going to give it to a reformer i'm not going to give it to just the gift of a prophet or a good preacher but i'm coming to do this myself i'm coming down for deliverance that's what the message of the hour is others see it as bondage and they leave it i see it as my freedom i see it as my ticket to get out of bondage i see it as my deliverance so the promise of restoration it was it was all that joel prophesied what was this this was all daniel prophesied when daniel said seal it up daniel don't even don't even write it it was the full revelation of the mystery it was the prophecy of joel it wasn't just a restoration of intellect wasn't just a restoration it was a pouring out of his spirit so that so the opening of the word didn't bring a theology amen i just understand the bible better i know that it was adultery and not an apple in the beginning listen friends those are all good but you can have the knowledge of the revelation and miss the revelation entirely i understand this no it was the opening of the word didn't bring a theology but as you said then brother matthew what was his purpose its purpose was to bring a power to unleash and unlock a power to break any grip of the enemy that he has in your life to destroy any stronghold that satan has built in your mind that's what the word was to bring to his people a power of the strength not just some of the strength but the full strength of christ would come without measure again to a people to who brother the mat to believers it brings the power to destroy and to expose the enemy and his threats that's what revelation brings a power to cast out demons a power to heal the sick both your mind your body and your spirit a power to raise the dead the opening of the word you say brother matthew what does the message bring what does the open word bring it brings life life amen if i could oversimplify what it brings i just simplify it right there the opening of the message of the hour the opening of the word the unveiling of christ didn't bring head knowledge it didn't bring ins it didn't bring intellect it didn't bring emotion it brought life and you can feed upon it the world is feeding on the world and they're dying but you can feed upon christ i'm so glad that i fed upon him and i can live i can have life you say brother matt does that mean you don't have trouble no does that mean you don't have trial no jesus said in this world you'll have tribulation but i've got life i've got something the world can't give the world can't take it away i've got something so precious to me oh you ought to say thank you lord brother branham says this notice and he cried verse four when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write notice verse three he says and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth so what was the voice we had the voice of theologians they were good they probed at it they got a lot right i'm thankful for the shock i don't i don't push it away i'm thankful for the tassel it brought me to where i'm at today i'm thankful for the minds of men i'm thankful i draw upon them i'm thankful for historians who can read about bible history but listen friends when god sent the message it wasn't the voice of a theologian it wasn't the voice of intellect it wasn't the voice of human reason it wasn't the voice of a reformer right god sent a loud voice as one a lion you know what a lion does when a lion roars every other voice every other voice is silent and when god sent the message of the hour he sent it with a loud voice not to be questioned not to be doubted not to be pro not to be debated my goodness not to be opinionated to be believed to be consumed it's what's going to change your body an emotional experience is not going to change you an intellectual experience is not going to change you the word is going to change he cried with a loud voice that voice cut through every idea of who christ was it cut through every idea of theologians it wasn't the opinion of a man anymore it wasn't even the opinion of brother branham but it was the mighty angel speaking with a loud voice how many witty roar the bible says seven thunders utter their voices say brother matt what does that mean that's why the message of the hour is the voice of god you may hear a tape and you may turn on a tape and you may only hear the voice of brother branham and that's fine that's fine i love his voice but the message of the hour is more than a voice of brother branham it's more than the voice of it's more than hunting stories more than fission stories but when you hear you're hearing the voice of god communicated to you amen not the church it's good that he comes and speaks to the church but he's got to speak to you yes amen listen to me young person he's got to speak to you amen you may hear his voice as he speaks in the pulpit you may hear his voices he speaks to your dad or your mom he's got to speak to you you've got to hear his voice amen you've got to obey that voice you've got to hear that voice in order to obey it it was the voice as a lion roareth this is what daniel couldn't understand go to the next line if you could but thou will daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased verse 8 and i heard but i understood not then said i my lord what shall be the end of these things go to the next slide and he said this is to daniel go thy way daniel for the words are closed closed and when they were closed men probed ah you know i think it might be this no i think it's over here the word was closed and sealed up till the time of the end many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but i'm thankful but the wise but the wise shall understand in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished so that book that was sealed is now open yeah amen it's now opened oh i'm thankful it's opened i'm thankful it's an open word i'm thankful god opened it not to enlighten me not to enlighten me i'm so glad for the enlightenment but it was to change me it was to take a heart that couldn't be turned and turned that heart back to faith back to a supernatural faith back to a supernatural understanding back to an apostolic church are we an apostolic church brother matt what does it mean to be an apostolic to be a church of the apostles to be a church like the apostles in the first church are we apostolic you say for brother man i believe i want to believe i want to have apostolic belief how many can say i want to believe like the apostles believed i want to live like the apostles live give us a church that is like the first church give us a power that the first church had give us a faith that the first church had unveiled when god was unveiled he poured out himself and all of himself is available and i said lord i want to take advantage of it today because you're standing your feet with me we have so much more we just won't get to matthew 11 but what weren't you out to see a prophet that's verse 9 matthew 11. speaking of john what went you out to see a prophet yey i say unto you matthew 11 brother caleb verse 9 i say unto you and more than a prophet for this is he of whom it is written why was he more than a prophet we had prophets we had micah we had nahum we had malachi we had jeremiah we had isaiah prophets but now john was going to come and brother branham says john was the breach between law and grace he was a change of dispensation john was more than a prophet jesus says verse 9 this is verse 10 for this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare the way before thee say brother matt why was he greater than a prophet because the word had been written specific special word had been written about this man and now john had became the word that was written about him you say brother branham was a prophet he was a prophet i say unto you he was more than a prophet for this is him of who malachi chapter 4 speaks about of who luke of who revelations 10 verse 7. this is he jesus says among them that are born of women there have not risen or greater than john the baptist not withstanding that he is least in the kingdom of heaven he that is least is greater than he and from the days what was it he was more than a prophet he was the word made light that's what brother branham calls him and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john it was a marker jesus i hope you catch it it was a marker jesus was placing and he was saying you've waited on this day and john is the marker until this day the prophets have prophesied the law has spoken until john but now something's going to happen because what john was introducing the lamb he was introducing the son of god and now the dispensation of law would be turned to a dispensation of grace [Music] for this is he notice this for all the prophets prophesied verse 14 and if you will receive it this is elijah this is elias which was for to come he that hath ears to hear let him hear [Music] notice jesus said it's only to those who have ears to hear this is he what was the ministry of malachi 4. it was more than emotion it was more than intellect it was more than theology it was more than doctrine come on friends it was more than just an understanding it was a marker when malachi 4 came it was going to set forth what was that cloud over flagstaff it was a marker if you'll receive it this is he of whom it was spoken this is elijah if you'll receive it this is the message of the hour it's the beginning of the rapture it's the beginning of a cycle and there are people who are literally being transformed being transfigured being going to be translated one day because why they feed upon not theology they don't feed upon the words of men listen this isn't a revival i love preachers but god didn't send us a revival of just good preachers i love good teachers but god didn't send us a good revival of just good teachers and theology this wasn't even the revival of a ministry or the gift of a prophet this was a revival of the word and the bride feeds on the word it's her revival and it's more than just a revival say brother matt are you glad you're part of revival i am but i'm so much more glad i met the reviver didn't just receive the revival i was introduced to the reviver and he revived my heart and there's a people who under their message under their messenger become the final voice to the final age they're literally called up in the rapture being transformed into the message of the hour which was a revel you say brother matt what is that we just preached for an hour and a half on what it was and i didn't even scratch the surface we preached on an hour and a half of what the message of the hour was and i didn't even scratch the surface let me just sum it up by saying it's the fullness of everything christ was everything christ is everything christ is going to be it's the full unleashing or unlocking of all of the power that god ever intended for you to have and it's for you it's for your family it's for your children it's for them that are far off as many as the lord our god shall call i just want to raise my hands and say lord let me be an empty vessel this morning let me empty myself and let me receive the fullness of christ all of his acts all of his experience give me all the experience i can have give me all the life give me all the signs give me all the wonders oh come on somebody help me preach this morning give me all of the miracles give me all of the acts give me all of the fruits of the spirit i want to be like him i want to live like him give me all of his word give me that little book i'll take it and i'll eat it and it'll transform me when the rest of the world is going off into chaos and doubting fears and confusion and guessing and walking away from the faith there's a bride that's ascending and walking higher and higher and higher by your heads by your heads every head bowed every i close lord we've been a little lengthy this morning but i believe that you spoke i pray god that you would anchor your word do lord what you did for the apostles do what you did for your prophet do what you did lord in the life and ministry of your servants may it come as an unction of the holy spirit may it fill us from our head to our toes may we be filled with every sign every wonder everything the word said that we should be i just raise my hand and say i want to be it lord jesus i don't want to fall short of it i want to i want to us i want to consume every bit of the word that you're trying to give me and today lord i'm raising my hand and i'm saying i'm going to take the book but i'm going to eat it it's changing people the world lord is a fountain just as much as this word is a fountain that we draw from this dying dark world and we can throw in there and throw in all of their philosophy throw in all of their science throwing all of their technological advancements throwing all of their ideas through in all of their culture throwing all of their riches throwing all of their best ideas throwing all of their best efforts learning it's a fountain that people are feeding upon and it's producing death it's producing school shootings it's producing mass murder it's producing war it's producing missiles it's producing hatred it's producing malice and people are feeding upon it education science civilization your prophet said moves you further away from the war from the word moves you further away from god but there's also a people who aren't feeding on that today they're feeding on the promise of the word they're feeding on the fountain of life and in that fountain there is not death and hatred there is peace that passes understanding i reach out maybe you want to reach out today and say i'm taking a hold of that peace that passes understanding out of that fountain flows joy i'm reaching out and taking that joy out of that fountain flows answers to life and i'm reaching out and taking a hold of those answers out of that comes healing oh how many want to raise a hand and say lord i'm drinking i want to drink from that fountain today i wanted to fill me fill my vessel lord from my head to my toe god let it be in the order of an anointing that doesn't just come on that flesh not just on my spirit let it transfer to my soul brother tony sing for us yes jesus there is none like you oh let's just raise our hands before we're dismissed no just raise your hand close your eyes and sing it to
