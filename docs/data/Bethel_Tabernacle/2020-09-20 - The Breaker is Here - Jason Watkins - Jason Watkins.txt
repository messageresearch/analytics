do do do do do i'll be right here by the kevin good morning friends god bless you i want to begin straight away back into our sunday school lesson on the book of revelation and we were ending last time on um i was in the spirit on the lord's day john well we actually went to john um from verse 9 revelation chapter 1 verse 9 john who also excuse me am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ and we moved through some concepts about how that he goes into verse 10 and says i was in the spirit on the lord's day we want to deal a little bit more today on the day of the lord because it's quite vast actually one of the larger aspects of the first chapter but we were trying to show that that you're going to need the spirit you're going to need to be in the spirit to face the day of the lord because we certainly are at that day and i think that's why that verse 9 precedes with john saying right before he says i was in the spirit on the lord's day he says i am your fellow companion in tribulation and companion and tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ and we dealt with the aspects of paul's imprisonment and you know the the trials that brother branham went through john's imprisonment on a roman penal colony the island of patmos which was basically a roman alcatraz if you will and it seemed counterintuitive if you look at that we were commenting on it last time that it seemed counter-intuitive to the purposes of the kingdom of god to have paul in a dungeon even to have paul on house arrest at certain times he was under house arrest under a guard but then there were other times if you've ever seen the nimitine prison where they lifted him up out of it um to actually execute him uh it's not it's not you wouldn't attribute that to house arrest and so you'd think that you know that john would have been spinning his wheels man here's two years lost and the value of john is so great surely god wouldn't let that happen but actually it served god's purpose for paul to be in prison in house arrest or in a dungeon it served god's purpose for brother branham and we kind of closed with that and went down through a little bit of uh of his life speaking about the trials that he went through born into abject poverty went through rejection as a boy rejection as a young man rejection by his family rejection by the ecumenical system and all doors closing to him yet it was all preparing him and even seemingly god rejecting him when he's pleading for the life of his of his infant daughter and brother branham talks about how that it takes that kind of a crushing uh but the rejection that he suffered you know was literally preparing him to deliver to the bride the greatest work of of teaching since the days when saint paul was writing the new testament to us since john come back from his island prison we have come to that day the day of the lord because as we have taught you that you constantly there's 10 different times in the book of revelation where he makes the statement i'm alpha and omega i'm the first and the last i'm the beginning and the end i'm he that was and is and and is forever more and so we find that that we we were showing how that brother branham brought that out to us that he was he was fully in the alpha he would be fully in the omega and while he would be in the in between everything in the in between wouldn't be completely him man made theory and dogma creeds of men would get injected to it god would carry on he would intercede for the ignorance of his family because you can't disbelieve what you don't know and so we find that's the the the sin that condemns someone is unbelief so we showed how that you know luther luther didn't know that he was an unbeliever in sanctification he didn't know that that revelation hadn't come yet wesley didn't know he was an unbeliever in the outpouring of the gifts if you read history church history that at the very end of the philadelphian age when they would have their big methodist campground meetings and uh methodist the methodist church had a big foothold here in the early days of america and uh they would they would shake and pass out and be slain in the spirit and they the methodists didn't know what they thought uh an evil spirit was taken they'd throw water in their face to wake them up and you know smack them come out of that you know that's that's the power of the devil they didn't know wesley's age didn't know they were unbelievers in the restoration of the gifts just like pentecost those early azuza fathers didn't know that they were unbelievers in the revealed word but it wasn't their time that would come in what we call the day of the lord and the day of the lord would encompass not only the judgments in the tribulation but the day of the lord would encompass the uh the beginning of the rapture in first thessalonians 4. that's the day of the lord that is the day that many or not many but some preachers in paul's day tried to tell the church that day's already arrived and the resurrection has passed and paul would say no that day what day the day of the lord that day cannot come til there come a falling away first and the man of sin be revealed so we realize that the day of the lord is a very broad term that takes in the tribulation the three and a half years the last half of daniel's 70th week or what the jews commonly refer to it as the time of jacob's trouble we realize that that the day of the lord pours out great wrath and the you know the uh people say yeah there's the plagues and there's the woes and there's all these different things and they're uh and the antichrist is coming and they're almost completely unaware that the antichrist has been working in the church from the inception that the woes two of them are already have already happened and the third is yet and so many of the of the vials and we see these things that have been poured out already happening and so while judgment the day of the lord is falling on the earth god is closing out denominational ages he's closing out laodicea church systems not the age at the end of laodicea the church goes in a rapture literally but you have to realize that and people say well revelation 4 1 that's the rapture correct that's absolutely true and remember it's a voice that called from heaven to john now it's not a voice anymore on the earth john turned to hear a voice and when he turned to hear a voice he he didn't turn to see a man he turned to hear a vote to see a voice and the voice he saw the seven lamp stands so john literally is turning to see the church it's christ in the midst of the lamp stands walking by the holy ghost in the midst of his church it is the corporal body it's not the nail scarred man it's the corporal body brother branham takes that up that she was gird about the paps with a golden girdle that christ standing there in the image walking among the seven lampstands was uh uh his his his garment was girded about the pabst and brother branham said the symbolism of a woman he said look it's a woman because it was it was christ but it was christ in his bride the church is the female so so we realize that that john is now turning to hear a voice and he's seeing now the incarnate word again because remember that jesus was jesus before he was a human before he was a human he was the word that's i mean in the old testament how did those old testament saints ever find righteousness how were they uh accounted as righteous men like noah men like abraham how did they acquire abel when he offered his sacrifice how did they acquire this righteousness because they received a revelation of the word which was jesus in the beginning was the word jesus was the word and so he was jesus the bible teaches us in ephesians three that every there that everything that is made that was made it was made by jesus john also says there was nothing uh there was not anything made that was made without him making it john taught us that clearly so you have him in the old testament as the word you have the word becoming and living in a human body as the nazarene and then you have that same jesus that body the nazarene is laid on an altar and that life which is jesus met paul on the road to damascus as the pillar of fire and it is that pillar of fire that divided himself into the church and now the church is the corporal body of christ in the earth his nail-scarred body is laying on an altar in heaven he's now living in his church and so we find then that the that that you have to be in the spirit to catch all of this first of all we found out last time that you have to be in the spirit to endure the level of rejection you have to be in the spirit to endure the child training people do not endure child training who nor do they endure persecution jesus said that the seed sometimes falls on stony ground now don't think of of a field with a lot of stones in it think of a of a piece of granite stone like jutting out of a mountain and on the top of that is a thin layer of grass that has grown but it can only grow at a certain season as soon as the summer heat hits it and the sun gets up high that grass can't put roots down because it's on rock and therefore it gets blistered by the sun and withers and jesus says this is the one who for a time anons with joy but because of persecution because of rejection because of the trials that it requires to mold sons and daughters of god because of the heat that is required in the crucible uh you know and and the rejection and the and the things that we have to go through here and this is why paul would encourage the church especially the church who are alive and remain at the day of the lord or the coming of the lord the coming of the lord and the day of the lord and the judgment of god these are all one one one overlapping happening they happen in sequence it fires through a shout a voice and then a trumpet and then then then drug judgment falls on those who got left behind and the gospel picks up two prophets who go to the to the jews to the 144 000. this is all an unfolding sequence of events brother branham describes that how that five stars each one of those stars blow out at five and each one of those five blow out five and it's like a roman candle it just keeps going unto the consummation of the ages and so you have to be in the spirit on the lord's day you first got to get that you're going to be a companion in tribulation uh but you know that's why jesus would anoint paul to say all things work together for the good of them that love him don't worry it's the father's pleasure to give you the kingdom you're going to win in the end friends we see the day of the lord we see a day of mass hysteria we see a day of rampant chaos and insanity on the streets listen it for brother branham when he closes out 1964 i think in the message shalom he says you know to the effect i don't have it in front of me but to the effect that it's now he said it's a really dark time for the world because the seals had been open christ had been crucified the age went completely black they put christ out second crucifixion and indictment and we realized that the day of the lord had begun you get that the day of the lord had already started so so we realized then that that he says but it's a but it's a glo it's a dark time a sad time for the world but it's a glorious time for the bride because i because revelation 4 and isaiah 60 correlate to being called up higher arise shine thy light has come yes darkness is on the age now it's done those those those church systems are finished they'll never rise again they've put christ out they'll never carry life again they were only temporary carriers to carry the life to the next age now that they've put christ out there's no life left in them are we still in laodicea as time we are because the bride goes in the rapture at the end of the laodicean age in time there's not an eighth age in time there's a there's a an eighth age is uh eighth day is a spiritual term that that represents back to the original back to the first so now we have the restoration of the token the restoration of the abstract the restoration of the jubilee we now have uh we now have a full abstract token titled deed and so we realized that it was a voice in heaven that called john higher now it's the exact same voice from heaven and revelation 18 4 that says come out of her my people it's the exact same voice in revelation 11 11 when moses and elijah are killed and they lay in the street which is jerusalem and the whole world sees them through satellite television and uh that that a voice calls from heaven come up hither and they are resurrected now you know people could say well then then then then that means that revelation 4 1 is is only applicable to our body change but that's not true because in revelation 11 11 that's that happens in a moment that's an instantaneous resurrection there's there's nothing leading up to that they're killed and then they're resurrected after three days but we realize that in revelation 4 the rapture it starts a cycle not a one strike strike event it now first thessalonians 4 kicks off a shout a voice a trumpet and the tr and and and the the trumpet sounds the dead in christ rise and then we which are alive and remain in the earth are changed in a moment but you you'll never get to that change until you go through the process of redemption and the process of redemption can only come from christ and christ is the word and so the voice that he turns to see is the voice of the word and so he says i was in the spirit on the lord's day and so brother branham says here let me catch this couple of quotes here so he says here in the future home so the the one who goes in with jesus now how do you get into him by one spirit and he is the word you become part of him what part of him are you the word that's living of this hour recognizing you'll walk with him in the millennium that's a beautiful statement you will walk with him in the millennium i want you to understand something friends he's on his way to the throne so walk with him if you walk with somebody headed to the throne you're headed to the throne so he so so received the word of this hour you're in the day of the lord the day of the lord is not something yet in the future the the rapture mystery is here the revelation to change your body is here the the trumpet has sounded the jubilee is now sounded we've been loosed from the bondage of man-made systems and we're already effectively being translated starting in our soul controlling our spirit lording over our flesh by the word of god and eventually we get a body likened unto his glorified body so you want to be part of the word that was to come in the lord's day as paul said that day shall not come until well that until has been now because until the man of sin be made known and that's what a prophet did in this age he made known the man of sin he's not he doesn't get it he's not identified particularly because he hasn't begun his ride particularly he can't begin his ride until the bride is gone but a prophet was able to identify him by the bible and point to the beast system of rome and point to all of that man-made systems of blasphemous names and brother branham's called him death because that's what john identified him as and brother branham took a scripture and a reality and connected the dot and said that's who death is but he can't begin his full right so the day of the lord is unfolding and and in the it is in the day of the lord that a people returned back to the full spirit for john to see the day of the lord he had to have the full spirit he couldn't have a dip of the spirit like the ages had he couldn't have a partial understanding like the ages had he he had to have the full token life and that comes at the day of the lord it awakens a a a bride it raises her up to be the voice of god in the world the final voice to the final age it sets the chaos and madness on the streets that we see and eventually it'll translate a bride then go to the jews and the world will spin off into those last 42 months of destruction so we so we find then that that he's headed toward the millennium so this is why you know paul would say that they who are in the flesh cannot please god one of the greatest privileges that you have to be in the spirit during this time of the lord's day is that is that you have the ability to reproduce jesus christ if you live according to the flesh you'll never do that because the flesh is weak it's full of sin it's not converted and even as a son and daughter of god you will never show christ to the world you've got to live by the spirit so so we see then that that that there is a supernatural thing that is going on inside of us by this spirit that comes in the day of the lord the principle is that if we get this spirit of god then it's there then then there is no it's no more you just living it by your willpower it's literally the life of christ because your willpower won't do it you will stay frustrated all your life trying to live a good christian life you will suffer constant frustration why because it's too hard today it's too wicked today why is it because it's the day of the lord you understand christ has been put out of the church there's the earth now has no more contact with with christ except through a bride that's how wicked it is and so there you'll be frustrated trying to live by your own willpower it has to be christ living in you all right let me see i've got um a couple of minutes i i think i will stop right there uh i've got actually one minute without going into overtime so we will we will conclude right there for today i don't want to go any further um i i was going to try to get down to verse 11 but we will save that so let's pray father we thank you for your word today thank you for our sunday school lesson and we pray that lord it will be effectual to the people that they may gain strength from it father and gain understanding of the life they live in the world they're present in may it be so father we commit it to you and the remaining service into your hands in jesus name god bless you you
