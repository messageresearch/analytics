[0:29] you
[0:57] you
[2:17] good morning everyone god bless you
[2:19] let's stand and pray
[2:24] heavenly father we just come before you
[2:26] lord and we are so thankful for your
[2:28] goodness your mercy
[2:30] your grace that you give to us lord i
[2:32] pray that your holy spirit would just be
[2:34] upon
[2:35] each one of us now lord speaking and
[2:38] and teaching and and guiding our
[2:40] thoughts today lord we just
[2:42] submit surrender ourselves to you lord
[2:45] that you would be glorified in our lives
[2:46] we ask these things in jesus name
[2:49] amen amen i'm going to be
[2:53] starting a series on a book of acts
[2:55] church
[2:56] and you can go ahead and be seated
[3:01] in the sermon god has a provided lamb
[3:03] brother branham says
[3:06] and if the branch ever brings forth or a
[3:08] vine brings forth a branch it
[3:09] has grapes on it the next vine comes out
[3:12] or branch out of that vine will have
[3:13] grapes on it
[3:14] if the church that come off of that vine
[3:17] was a pentecostal church with all the
[3:19] gifts
[3:20] if that ever really puts out another
[3:22] branch they'll write another book of
[3:24] acts behind it
[3:25] and that's what they had in the days of
[3:27] the apostles and the apostolic
[3:29] age never ended amen
[3:33] i want to draw from that thought a book
[3:36] of acts church and
[3:37] maybe even expand on it a little bit
[3:39] look at it from
[3:41] a different angle not just looking at
[3:43] the gifts and the supernatural power of
[3:46] god though that's
[3:46] certainly a part of it brother joe my
[3:48] goodness it's good to see you here
[3:50] praise the lord
[3:51] amen
[3:52] [Applause]
[3:54] love you brother he's been through a lot
[3:56] but he's faithful
[3:58] amen amen in the sermon be not afraid i
[4:03] want to look at it a little bit from
[4:04] this angle
[4:05] and is what kind of character
[4:09] did the holy ghost produce
[4:13] in the book of acts not just
[4:16] looking at supernatural gifts
[4:19] but looking at the kind of life
[4:23] those men and women lived in the book of
[4:26] acts
[4:29] be not afraid 1960 brother branham says
[4:31] i've had ministers will say to me
[4:33] you better go see him because he's in an
[4:35] influential man in this city
[4:39] i love this i don't care if he's a bum
[4:41] in the street
[4:42] so drunk he can't move he's just as much
[4:45] as a mayor of the city in the sight of
[4:47] god
[4:48] because it's whosoever will let him come
[4:51] but we went after somebody else that was
[4:52] a movie star and had some great pull or
[4:54] some tap dance or a modern jitterbug or
[4:57] whatever you want to call it
[4:59] in other words brother branham's calling
[5:01] out
[5:02] the christian celebrity worship
[5:06] that took place then and how how much
[5:09] worse is it now
[5:11] everybody wants this celebrity this
[5:12] one's a christian tim tebow
[5:14] we're buying we'll buy his jerseys he's
[5:17] no good at football but we'll just buy
[5:18] his dirties because he's
[5:19] a celebrity christian um
[5:22] and you can go on and on and on all
[5:24] these celebrity christians
[5:26] and what does it amount to in the end
[5:30] seventy percent of the time it amounts
[5:32] to utter
[5:34] moral failure look at the story of ravi
[5:37] zacharias
[5:39] all of his sins exposed before the world
[5:42] an abuse a serial
[5:44] abuser of women
[5:48] that's not what it's about it's not
[5:50] about celebrity
[5:52] it's not not about the big shot it's
[5:55] about every soul
[5:57] and if we can't look and this is what
[5:59] brother branham's saying
[6:01] we can't look at the celebrity and the
[6:03] stinky bum
[6:04] on the street in the same way there's
[6:07] something
[6:08] wrong in our way of looking at it
[6:14] god goes to the gutters this is back to
[6:16] brother branham
[6:17] god goes to the gutters go out into the
[6:20] streets and highways and compel
[6:22] them to come in and remember that was
[6:24] the last call
[6:26] the church has gone off without him see
[6:29] you've gone
[6:30] off on tantrums
[6:34] a lot of things come to my mind when i
[6:35] read that
[6:37] a lot of things come to my mind
[6:40] i don't know if i should say them right
[6:43] now
[6:44] but let let me try to put this in a
[6:47] gentle
[6:48] way we
[6:52] and there's nothing wrong with that
[6:53] we're
[6:55] we're so focused in the message movement
[6:59] on special meetings that i
[7:02] fear that our young people that are
[7:04] aspiring to be preachers
[7:06] what are they are aspiring to is to be
[7:08] invited to be the preachers
[7:11] at special meetings and now we've
[7:13] reached the pinnacle
[7:15] i'm i'm preaching at a special meeting
[7:18] i'm
[7:19] i'm a pastor of a church
[7:22] i would that we would look at it this
[7:24] way
[7:26] and that our young people that are
[7:27] aspiring to do something for god would
[7:30] think
[7:30] how can i go to the gutters how can i go
[7:34] to the streets to preach the word of god
[7:36] you don't you don't need to preach in
[7:38] this pulpit
[7:40] to do great things for god
[7:43] you might do much better things for god
[7:46] out of this
[7:47] building it's needed
[7:51] but we the church has gone off
[7:55] without him i wonder
[7:58] not everyone not all of us i'm not
[8:00] trying to paint
[8:01] such a broad stroke across every single
[8:04] person and everyone
[8:06] but i wonder if we haven't thought about
[8:08] this very often
[8:10] and if we've not got completely gone off
[8:13] without him
[8:14] but if we've our focus has shifted to
[8:17] the wrong thing
[8:19] in the wrong direction we want to be
[8:21] preachers and pulpits we want to have a
[8:23] time to preach and wednesday and sunday
[8:25] you could preach literally every day
[8:27] somewhere
[8:28] people are literally
[8:31] coveting ministers to visit them and i
[8:33] know kovitz going on
[8:35] and yet and yet if god if
[8:38] god leads you and guides you there's a
[8:40] way
[8:42] to go anywhere pretty much
[8:47] and so it it's not about what the
[8:49] limitations are it's about
[8:51] the god that we serve and his calling
[8:53] upon our lives
[8:55] but i wonder if too many lives and great
[8:58] ministries have been wasted
[9:00] inside of a church because that's the
[9:03] only focus
[9:04] that's been placed is we've got to be a
[9:06] minister and i've got a minister inside
[9:08] of the church i don't believe you have
[9:10] to do that
[9:19] and i'm just these are questions that
[9:21] i'm asking myself
[9:25] are we looking for recognition from the
[9:27] message elite
[9:29] are we looking for recognition at all
[9:33] do we treat the dirty stinking drunk
[9:35] with the same heart as the great men
[9:37] of message society
[9:44] so god goes to the gutters how
[9:47] does god go to the gutters
[9:52] how does god go to the gutters
[9:57] we are the body of christ we are his
[9:59] hands
[10:00] his feet his heart are we ready to be
[10:03] the
[10:03] hands and feet and voice of jesus
[10:07] and go the places no one else wants to
[10:13] or have we gone on without god
[10:18] or are we making a purpose to go on
[10:22] without god
[10:25] again they're just questions all of us
[10:27] have to answer them as individuals
[10:30] i'm not talking about our church and the
[10:33] church body and our pastor i'm talking
[10:35] about all of us
[10:36] as individuals and i it i don't care how
[10:40] spiritual
[10:40] you are how born again you are you can
[10:42] still go on
[10:45] without god mary and joseph were chosen
[10:48] vessels and what did they do they went
[10:52] they went forward when jesus was 12
[10:55] years old they went forward without him
[10:59] that didn't make them
[11:01] wicked sinners that made them
[11:05] in the wrong place going the wrong
[11:07] direction
[11:11] acts 4 17 17-20
[11:15] let's look at the nature of these people
[11:20] that were filled with the holy ghost
[11:24] this is the sanhedrin council but it but
[11:26] that it spread no
[11:28] further among the people let us
[11:30] straightly threaten them
[11:32] that they speak henceforth to no man in
[11:35] this name
[11:36] how did that go for the sanhedrin
[11:38] council
[11:40] they called them commanded them not to
[11:42] speak at all or teach in the name of
[11:45] jesus
[11:46] but peter and john answered and said
[11:48] unto them whether it be right in the
[11:50] sight of god to hearken
[11:51] unto you more than unto god judgey
[11:55] for we cannot but speak the things which
[11:57] we have seen
[11:58] and heard now that's
[12:02] that's gutsy that's the kind of that's
[12:04] what
[12:06] that's a book of acts believer not a
[12:10] soft soap jellyfish
[12:14] someone that says whatever it takes
[12:17] even if it means my death i will serve
[12:20] and obey
[12:21] the calling that god has placed upon my
[12:23] life
[12:26] the authorities the big shot said
[12:29] you guys can't do that now they put
[12:32] their muscle behind that too
[12:33] right acts 55
[12:36] 17-21 then the high priest rose up and
[12:41] all they that were with him which is the
[12:43] sect of the sadducees
[12:44] and were filled with indignation and
[12:48] laid their hands on the apostles and put
[12:50] them in the common
[12:51] prison so they got arrested for
[12:55] preaching in the name of jesus
[12:58] and they got thrown in prison
[13:01] but the angel of the lord by night
[13:03] opened the prison doors
[13:05] and brought them forth and said go stand
[13:08] and speak in the temple to the people
[13:10] all the words of this life
[13:13] so this is what the the lord spoke to
[13:15] them you just got out of jail
[13:18] he doesn't say go hide because they're
[13:21] coming after you
[13:22] he says go to the very place you
[13:24] arrested before
[13:26] stand and preach the words of this life
[13:30] what was their response when they heard
[13:32] that
[13:33] they entered into the temple
[13:36] late at night when it was dark and no
[13:38] one could see them
[13:40] and it was safer early in the morning
[13:44] and taught but the high priest came and
[13:46] they that were with them and called the
[13:47] council together
[13:49] and all the senate are the children of
[13:50] israel and sent to the prison to have
[13:52] them brought out
[13:53] they weren't there aren't these the guys
[13:55] that we
[13:57] arrested yep
[14:00] yeah they are but they really don't
[14:03] they're not counting their life as
[14:05] anything
[14:06] that's a book of acts church that's a
[14:09] book of acts
[14:10] believer they weren't waiting for the
[14:14] next special meeting
[14:17] they weren't looking they weren't
[14:19] looking for
[14:21] a great speaker to come no they were
[14:23] just being obedient
[14:26] they knew the people that listened to
[14:28] them preached said we
[14:29] these guys are ignorant and unlearned in
[14:31] other words they don't talk
[14:32] like a real rabbi
[14:36] but they saw their boldness and took
[14:39] note these ones
[14:40] had been with jesus they took what they
[14:44] had
[14:45] whatever they had and they completely
[14:47] gave it
[14:48] to christ for his glory no matter what
[14:51] the cost
[14:53] that is what jesus calls us to
[14:58] that is a book of acts holy ghost
[15:00] believer
[15:03] acts 40 through 42 acts 5
[15:06] 40-42 and to him they agreed
[15:09] and when they had called the apostles
[15:11] and beaten them
[15:13] called the apostles nice greeting
[15:17] come here and they beat them
[15:22] they commanded that they should not
[15:24] speak in the name of jesus
[15:26] and let them go and how did that go for
[15:28] them
[15:30] and they departed from the presence of
[15:32] the council rejoicing that they were
[15:36] for his name
[15:41] what did jesus tell them in the sermon
[15:42] on the mount
[15:44] i think we i think i need to turn there
[15:47] take me a second to find it but matthew
[15:49] chapter 5.
[16:08] yeah verse 10
[16:12] blessed are they which are persecuted
[16:14] for righteousness sake
[16:15] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[16:17] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[16:20] and persecute you and shall say all
[16:22] manner of evil against you falsely for
[16:24] my sake
[16:25] rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
[16:28] is your ward
[16:30] in heaven for so persecuted they the
[16:32] prophets
[16:33] that were before you rejoice
[16:37] rejoice when you're persecuted
[16:41] that should be our that should be our
[16:42] reaction that we
[16:44] we've been persecuted we've been put out
[16:47] and where is where are you usually
[16:50] persecuted and put out
[16:52] when you preach the word those who
[16:55] believe they have the word
[16:57] but are going against it and so
[17:01] it should not cause us to be sad or
[17:03] weepy
[17:05] in another place jesus says rejoice
[17:08] even he says leap for joy
[17:12] i mean think about that
[17:15] think about that for a second that's
[17:18] quite a reaction i mean
[17:19] when when that's like winning the nba
[17:23] championship
[17:25] right they leap and throw their fist in
[17:27] the air and shout for joy
[17:30] and so that should be not just
[17:33] uh let's see i'm persecuted jesus said i
[17:35] should leave for joy
[17:36] i'm just gonna leap for joy even though
[17:38] i don't know it's it's literally it
[17:40] should be a natural holy ghost
[17:43] reaction within us that i've stood for
[17:45] jesus christ i've been faithful to him
[17:48] and people are standing and fighting
[17:50] against me
[17:51] it should cause me to be joyful
[17:55] and it shouldn't stop me from doing what
[17:57] i'm supposed to do i think
[17:59] i think that's a great point and daily
[18:03] in the temple and in every house
[18:05] they ceased not to teach and preach
[18:08] jesus christ do what you're called to do
[18:12] and don't stop doing it it does you
[18:15] don't have
[18:16] you don't have to wait for someone to
[18:18] say
[18:19] hey here's the pulpit
[18:23] did they were they waiting for someone
[18:24] to say here's the pulpit
[18:27] sure okay so the situation is different
[18:28] we have churches
[18:30] etc i understand that portion of it
[18:34] but that doesn't this when i when i was
[18:37] a young
[18:38] minister in my early 20s
[18:41] i remember praying and feeling
[18:42] frustrated i'm sitting here
[18:46] why won't my pastor let me preach more
[18:47] often i wish i would have more
[18:49] opportunity to preach and the holy
[18:52] spirit said why
[18:54] would you limit your ministry to these
[18:56] four walls
[18:58] i haven't called you to stay within
[19:00] these four walls
[19:02] and it really struck me and convicted me
[19:04] when i heard that
[19:06] don't stop if he's called you to teach
[19:08] and preach jesus
[19:10] christ don't stop doing it don't wait
[19:13] for someone else to give you permission
[19:16] that these they didn't wait for
[19:18] permission do it
[19:20] brother branham says if you don't have a
[19:22] pulpit get one put it on the street
[19:25] start a bible study in your home with go
[19:27] to the go to the
[19:28] gutters go to the homeless people and
[19:30] witness to them
[19:33] preach to them don't don't wait there's
[19:37] how many people haven't heard there's
[19:39] nations there's entire nations
[19:41] there's not one message translated
[19:46] from brother branham or even printed or
[19:49] even preached
[19:50] a message by a message believer has
[19:52] never been preached
[19:53] in nations in this world
[19:57] what are we sitting here for they say
[19:59] there's covet
[20:00] okay if god calls you
[20:03] you'll go when you're supposed to go and
[20:06] where you're supposed to go
[20:11] and nothing's going to stop you
[20:15] you say the government can stop me and
[20:16] throw me in jail temporarily
[20:22] again this is a book of acts holy ghost
[20:26] church it's not just supernatural in
[20:30] special meetings
[20:32] we have a special meeting and people are
[20:34] healed and this no
[20:35] it's these when did they have a special
[20:38] meeting
[20:41] they were on the street they went to the
[20:43] temple in public places
[20:46] what is the last call brother brother
[20:48] branham told us the last call
[20:49] go into the highways and the hedges
[20:54] and compel them
[21:04] acts 15 25-26
[21:12] it seemed good unto us being assembled
[21:15] with one accord
[21:16] to send chosen men unto you with our
[21:18] beloved barnabas
[21:20] and paul listen to this next portion
[21:23] about barnabas and paul
[21:24] men that have hazarded their lives for
[21:26] the name
[21:27] of our lord jesus christ amen
[21:31] lord help us i think that's that's
[21:33] called that's all of us
[21:36] it isn't just for barnabas and paul
[21:40] all of us all of us
[21:43] should stand for the gospel in season
[21:46] and out of season
[21:48] whether we're hated or loved it
[21:50] shouldn't matter
[21:51] we're not living for a pat on the back
[21:54] we're living for one pat on the back
[21:56] that's when we go to heaven for jesus to
[21:58] say well done
[22:00] thou good and faithful servant you might
[22:01] be rejected
[22:03] you might be rejected constantly for the
[22:06] sake of the gospel
[22:09] jesus christ is your portion men that
[22:12] have hazarded their lives for the name
[22:15] of the lord jesus christ
[22:19] acts 20 22 through 24
[22:25] and now behold paul
[22:28] speaking to the elders of in ephesus
[22:31] and now behold i go bound in the spirit
[22:34] unto jerusalem
[22:35] not knowing the things that shall befall
[22:37] me there listen to this
[22:40] i'm going to jerusalem god called him to
[22:43] go to jerusalem he was being obedient to
[22:46] go to jerusalem
[22:47] but this is what every city is happening
[22:49] save that the holy ghost
[22:51] witnesses in every city saying that
[22:53] bonds
[22:55] and afflictions abide me or wait for me
[23:00] then what does he say next so therefore
[23:02] i'm gonna run to spain
[23:05] because it's too dangerous to go to
[23:08] jerusalem no but none of these things
[23:12] move me
[23:15] none of these things move me
[23:18] they don't change me from being obedient
[23:22] to what the lord has called me to
[23:25] neither kind count i my life dear
[23:28] unto myself
[23:31] wow
[23:35] it's easy to say oh yeah i don't count
[23:37] my we all
[23:39] i feel like we most of us count our life
[23:42] dear
[23:43] and to ourselves and we have to be
[23:46] careful
[23:47] because we're not living we're lit we're
[23:50] called to be stewards
[23:52] right we're called to multiply the
[23:54] blessings that god gives to us
[23:56] in in many different ways we're called
[23:59] to be excellent in everything we we do
[24:02] to be obedient in everything we do and
[24:05] yet we're not called to make
[24:07] that our focus and our hope
[24:10] we should say i don't count any of that
[24:12] dear to me
[24:14] what i'd count there is my character and
[24:16] being obedient and being a good steward
[24:18] of what
[24:19] god has entrusted me with but that stuff
[24:23] it doesn't mean anything to me give it
[24:25] up i'll give it up now
[24:27] if the lord asked me to neither count i
[24:30] my life dear unto myself
[24:34] so that i might finish my course with
[24:36] joy and the ministry which i have
[24:38] received of the lord jesus
[24:40] to testify the gospel of the grace of
[24:42] god
[24:45] you say brother jason we're in a
[24:47] different age we're not under that age
[24:48] they were called to persecution and
[24:50] difficulties and trials
[24:51] that's right but are we called to a
[24:54] different character we're supposed to be
[24:55] soft soap a bunch of sissified
[24:59] christians
[25:00] is that what we're supposed to be no
[25:01] we're supposed to be called with the
[25:03] same character
[25:05] we don't do what we do for recognition
[25:08] about from others
[25:09] we don't do what we do so that others
[25:11] will speak well of us
[25:13] jesus says woe unto you when all men
[25:15] speak well of you
[25:17] for so did they the false of the false
[25:19] prophets before you
[25:21] again it's a character issue it's not a
[25:24] situational issue you say we're not
[25:25] going to be persecuted we're not
[25:27] some people in the bride of christ today
[25:30] are persecuted
[25:32] it's not all about you in america or me
[25:35] in america
[25:36] there's people in iran there's people in
[25:38] turkey there's people in china
[25:40] and the list goes on who are gravely
[25:43] persecuted they're in prison
[25:48] so it's not about
[25:51] age or situation it's about the kind of
[25:54] character that the spirit of god
[25:56] is to produce within us we're not to be
[26:02] soft we're not to be weak
[26:05] we're to be witnesses and the holy ghost
[26:08] coming upon
[26:08] upon us gives us power to be witnesses
[26:13] and it gives us boldness
[26:16] that doesn't mean we don't have to pray
[26:18] for boldness paul
[26:20] asked wrote letters and asked people
[26:22] pray that i would have
[26:24] boldness to be a witness
[26:28] of the grace of god and so that that is
[26:31] for
[26:31] that is for all of us we need to pray
[26:33] for that we we sometimes we have
[26:35] shortcomings we
[26:36] we fail that's what the blood of christ
[26:39] is for
[26:40] to forgive us but don't just stay
[26:43] in the same position don't linger
[26:47] in weakness and fear
[26:51] we're called we're called to have a
[26:53] boldness
[26:54] we're called to be witnesses we're
[26:56] called to not
[26:58] be so concerned about what people think
[27:00] of us but
[27:01] to be concerned what jesus christ
[27:04] thinks of us
[27:07] amen how many want to be a book of acts
[27:10] believer
[27:12] i want to be a book of acts believer i
[27:13] want to have the character
[27:16] that god produced in those meant
[27:19] fearless
[27:21] that doesn't that doesn't mean there
[27:23] isn't
[27:25] you feel fear but you don't act upon
[27:29] your fear you don't well i'm scared so i
[27:31] adjust my life
[27:32] to avoid all difficulties and trials
[27:35] that's not
[27:36] the christian life that's not the
[27:40] christian walk
[27:41] often times the christian walk takes you
[27:43] to
[27:44] counter intuitive places calls you to do
[27:47] things
[27:48] that make no sense it causes you to give
[27:50] or
[27:51] spend money or spend time on things
[27:54] that zap you you see memes i'm only
[27:57] going to spend
[27:58] time think on things that add something
[28:01] to me
[28:02] okay that's the bible of satan
[28:07] we're called i'm gonna i'm gonna only do
[28:10] things
[28:11] that add to others that's
[28:14] what christianity is and in adding to
[28:17] others
[28:18] god will add to me but if my focus is on
[28:20] that last part it's not right
[28:23] god will add to you but if your heart is
[28:26] on yourself
[28:28] you you put a block on the blessings
[28:30] that are flowing
[28:31] you were created to live for others
[28:35] for your spouse for your children
[28:40] for the church for the bum on the street
[28:43] for the person that stinks the person
[28:45] that annoys you the person that
[28:48] gets on your nerves we're called to say
[28:52] i'm putting all that aside i'm putting
[28:54] my frustrations aside
[28:56] i'm putting my anger aside i'm putting
[28:58] my bad attitudes aside
[29:00] and i'm going to serve the person people
[29:02] that don't
[29:04] like me that don't treat me right
[29:08] because i'm not i'm not made for myself
[29:10] i'm not made
[29:11] to be a sissified christian that
[29:15] follows the easy path what did
[29:18] what was it that brother bran the the
[29:20] message in tongues
[29:22] was spoken to brother branham because
[29:24] you have chosen the hard way
[29:27] there was two paths in front of brother
[29:29] branham the hard way and the easy way
[29:31] i mean think about think about what his
[29:34] ministry the the money that his ministry
[29:38] died when he died there was millions
[29:41] that went on to
[29:42] brother billy paul brother branham could
[29:44] have built a huge auditorium in tucson
[29:48] and in jeffersonville and he could have
[29:50] just traveled back
[29:51] between there and it would have been
[29:53] full completely full
[29:55] and life would have been easy
[29:58] for brother branham he had nice office
[30:01] big staff
[30:02] he never chose that he actively you know
[30:06] he didn't even talk about this
[30:08] aspect right this is reading between the
[30:12] lines
[30:15] he chose the hard way and the lord told
[30:18] them this is
[30:19] my way oh the other ministers of that
[30:22] time they chose the easy way the way
[30:24] that seems most logical business-wise
[30:28] brother branham took the opposite
[30:30] direction
[30:32] and what did he do because of that
[30:35] what was it tremendous blessing awaited
[30:38] him
[30:39] where now no in heaven
[30:42] that we're not living for today
[30:44] sometimes we gotta remember that
[30:46] we're not living for temporary blessings
[30:50] lay up your treasures in heaven
[30:55] right it's a hundred fold if we if we
[30:59] jesus said if you leave everything
[31:01] father mother
[31:02] everything in this life you'll receive a
[31:04] hundred fold
[31:06] in the life to come you know what that
[31:08] is and the interest rate
[31:09] is ten thousand percent
[31:13] so what if i told you you could invest
[31:14] your money
[31:16] your time your energy into something
[31:18] that pays
[31:19] ten thousand percent
[31:23] you'd say sign me up i want it right now
[31:26] yep you can you you have access to that
[31:30] just have to start making deposits
[31:33] and you'll get all of it plus ten
[31:36] thousand percent
[31:37] in heaven amen let's stand and pray
[31:45] heavenly father we're so thankful for
[31:47] your grace lord we
[31:48] we want to be bold
[31:52] book of acts believers that we don't
[31:55] count our life as anything we don't
[31:58] count it dear to ourselves that
[32:00] but that we want to finish our course
[32:02] with joy
[32:04] thank you lord thank you for the joy
[32:07] that comes in times that should be
[32:09] painful
[32:11] thank you for that lord i pray your
[32:13] blessing upon each one
[32:15] under the sound of my voice may they
[32:17] experience that
[32:18] joy of being in the channel
[32:22] that you've called them to be in of of
[32:25] walking in boldness of being a witness
[32:28] being a book of acts church lord we ask
[32:30] these things in the name of jesus christ
[32:32] amen god bless you
