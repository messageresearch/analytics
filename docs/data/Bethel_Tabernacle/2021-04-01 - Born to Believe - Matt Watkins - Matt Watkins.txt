in spite of all my mistakes problems and issues the lord still shows his love to us amen god bless you that'll be all the music thank you and may praise the lord we'd like to uh minister to you here tonight if you have your bible turn to deuteronomy amen chapter seven we have just a few scriptures we'd like to read amen and i sent the brothers also a powerpoint if you guys have that you can go ahead and display it amen let me make sure i'm in the right spot here let's go to numbers actually numbers not deuteronomy yes numbers chapter 13. amen i'd like to just minister to you tonight on something the lord just placed upon my heart and i would like to title this born to believe born to believe and the lord spake unto moses saying send thou men that they may search the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel of every tribe of their fathers shall you send a man everyone a ruler among them and moses by the commandment of the lord sent from the woof sent them from the wilderness of piranha all those men or heads of the children of israel verse 17 and moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan and said unto them get you up this way southward and go up into the mountain and see the land what it is and the people that dwell therein whether they be strong or weak few or many and what the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad and what cities they be that they dwell in whether in tents or in strongholds i'd like to just turn over now if we could just for one more scripture reading to the book of galatians hebrews i have my notes backwards i i changed the uh the notes around so just forgive me hebrews chapter 4 galatians is next we'll have you be seated before that hebrews chapter 4 verse 1. let us therefore fear last a promise being left for us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith and film that heard it for we which have believed to enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world let's just keep going here just for a moment verse 6. see and therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of one simple reason he doesn't there's many mistakes that you read about when you when you look at the lives of all of those who came out of egypt and crossed in and there's many reasons we could list we could find and the list would go long but notice he limits it just to one thing because of unbelief now remember what the prophet of god said what is sin it's unbelief use smoking well no it's drinking we'll know it's carousing what's this thing over here brother and said it's all linked those are symptoms of one problem unbelief amen i'm preaching i'm born to believe not born to be an unbeliever but born to be a believer are you a believer here tonight again he limited notice uh uh let's just stop right there and i'll have you be seated let's pray lord thank you for the reading of your word tonight lord it's truly our desire to be lord and a believer as you spoke lord in your word not of those who were unbelievers lord and those who failed because of unbelief lord but something in our hearts stirs lord and says i want to be a believer lord i want to believe all your word everything that's been written unto me let me take hold of it by faith now god as i minister what you've placed upon my heart i just ask for your grace lord and for your help for all of us lord we just raise our hands here tonight and ask you lord for your help here on this wednesday night those that'll listen in those that'll father stream this by archive those that are live listening and god may you just speak to them be lord be may your word be real unto each and every single person we ask we ask it in jesus christ's name and the church says amen amen you can be seated tonight if you have that um i'm gonna read something but not from that yet i just want to read one quote from the prophet that i didn't have um time to put up but i just like to read it to you listen to what he says here and he he's quoting here joshua one when he when he says what i'm about to read he's speaking about the scripture where it says that moses had died and it came to pass that that the lord spoke unto joshua the son of nun moses minister saying arise and go over this jordan thou and all the people uh unto a land which i do give thee even to the children of israel and then he says every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given you as i said unto moses now listen to what brother branham says here that is the promise the promised land is to live very important not just visit not just once a week not even twice a week but he says the promised land is to live in this land of the holy spirit that's god's promise for the church is to live in the power of the spirit and then he stops and i wish i would have showed you this but but i didn't have time to put it on my notes he says it's the promised land us to live in the land of the holy spirit is to live in the power of his spirit it's another world it's another land you have to come out of the conditions that you've been in to come out to live in this promised land to receive the promise it's another land it's another world he says it's the power of the holy spirit we know and we're we we've taught many times before and i'm sure we know that when we read the book of joshua when you read the book of joshua and you read of how that god was going to take them into canaan a land that he had promised them and he swore unto abraham and god says in the souls of wherever the souls of your feet touch that's the promised land that i've given you i think as believers we know here tonight that god isn't looking to give us some physical land some geographical location there's a promise to the natural seed of abraham of a promised land that he gave and and david conquers most of all of that land and then they lose that that uh that promised land and then god restores it uh back through moses and then through joshua and they go over in there to conquer all of the land of canaan and the bible says you're to drive out all the inhabitants of the land everybody that's there all their pictures all their molten images and he says you're to go and possess the land that i've promised you all of it not some of it not just a portion but every single bit of it from the all the way from the north boundary to the south to the east to the west all that the land that i've promised you i've given unto you but you've got to go and fight for it you've got to go and drive out the enemy off of your land and you've got to have victory to take hold of the promise i've given you now to israel that was very natural spoke of a very literal piece of ground even today the promise that god has given israel is a physical location a promised land and brother adam says israel's back in her homeland but we know as believers that to the believer god is not looking to a natural piece of land but it's a spiritual condition that is promised to the believer that was promised through our father abraham that your seed shall possess the gates of his enemy and to the believer to you to me to our family to our children to our church that promise is still the promise to god's seed to abraham's seed that wherever the souls of your feet step on that i've given you and brother branham says what is that wherever you whatever you can believe by faith whatever you can claim in the holy spirit that i've given unto you all of the promises of god that god gave to abraham are to the believer now amen spiritual blessings you believe that and he says what is the promised land to the believer it's the land of the holy spirit so where are we to live in where are we to dwell over in israel somewhere it's good to take trips over to israel i would love to one day go see and go see jerusalem but god says you can go to spiritual jerusalem right now you can go to the spiritual promised land that i've given you right now in fact you can live there every day of your life amen because i've given it to you it's a promise what was that promise and it was to live in the land of the holy spirit it was to live in the power i love how brother adam says this it's to live in the power of the spirit it's another world it's another land it's not this world it's not this land it's not a land of unbelief it's not a land of doubt it's a land of faith it's not a land of sickness it's a land of healing amen it's not a land of fear it's a land of faith it's not a world that the world that we live in here today is a world that's gripping with fear gripping with anxiety field uh doctors offices filled with people with undiagnosable conditions mental conditions physical conditions hooked on uh put them on some type of pill to try to manage the anxiety or manage the depression but god says brother adam says that's not your promised land your promised land is a whole different world it's not a promised land of fear it's not that you're a believer and you're to live in fear but i've given you a promise that you can live in faith amen that you don't have to dwell in this condition of this world but you were born a believer you were born to live by his promises you were born to live you were made and born by the spirit of god to believe what the word of god said and to not doubt what the word of god says but to take hold on eternal life to take hold of the promises of god he says here and i want you just to follow this closely he says in deuteronomy chapter 7 if you have your bible i'd like you to turn to that if you could deuteronomy listen to what scripture says here and this is this is a commandment that god gives to moses deuteronomy chapter 7 brother if you have it you can put it on the screen verse 18. i just got it notated here deuteronomy 7 verse 18. now notice this commandment here he says thou shall not be afraid of them but shall well remember what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh and unto all egypt so he says thou shout now anytime we see that word we immediately think of a command because it's a command this isn't a suggestion this isn't hey uh uh to 10 tips to live a a better life a more successful life this is a command that god commands them and says all of them's putting you into a land on a journey where there's going to be many things that would cause you to fear but god says i'm going to i'm going to i'm going to command you unthrough moses thou shalt not be afraid of them but remember what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh and unto all egypt in other words if you ever start to fear what the devil is doing to you in your life presently remember what god did for you in the past because what god the deliverance god gave you yesterday will give you strength to fight the enemy for today and god says anytime you start to fear what the enemy's doing and the enemies are messing up in your life just go back in your memory and say the same god who was with me a year ago has not changed his promise has not changed his word has not changed i will remember what god did and it'll give me strength to face my challenge today and he says thou shall not be keep that up if you could thou shall not be afraid of them but thou shalt remember thou shalt remember what the lord god did this this was a physical for israel this was a very real not an invisible spiritual war we face an invisible spiritual war here today as believers i know we have our physical challenges and some of us go through a lot of difficulties uh but we we fight a spiritual warfare that's why the ephesians six paul says that we don't wrestle against fleshly things not against flesh and blood but against spiritual wickedness can you say amen but for israel this was representing a real physical tangible army with real weapons and a real desire to destroy them they faced this where brother matt before uh kanan no in the promised land which was a type of the holy spirit to the believer they still face challenges in fact some of their greatest challenges they faced was not coming from egypt to canaan but it was after they had crossed through joshua the the who was a type of christ came into canaan some of their greatest challenges were waiting them after they had crossed into the land of promise we find that our greatest trouble and our greatest battle and our greatest struggle oftentimes is after we're born of the spirit of god we thought we had trouble back then but now we really know what real trouble really is for them it represented the well-armed uh heathen nation that was coming to destroy them you say brother matt what is it today it's a it's it's it's a real demon spirit you can label it whatever you want you could call it uh you could call it any addiction that you want you could call it any temptation or any sin that you want but behind every temptation is a real living spirit being called a demon spirit that wars with us every single day he warned with you this morning he ward with you he's warring with your mind right now whether you can see him or feel him or know what his name is he battled you this morning he's to try to stop you from coming to church here tonight and he's doing everything he can to prevent you from taking hold on what the lord is trying to say it's a real spiritual force a real spiritual difficulty and you know what god says god says about all of your problems you're not to fear them thou shall not fear them thou shall not be afraid of them right thou shalt not be afraid of them listen the lord knows every every temptation you could come under the bible says he was attempted in always of every way that you can fall under temptation the lord jesus experienced himself that's how he's a kinsmen redeemer that's how he's a high priest uh who can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities because he felt those same infirmities and now when we reach out to him in faith and in prayer god says i know what you're talking about i know what you're experiencing i know what you're fearing and here's what i want to tell you i already overcame it all you got to do is just trust me and believe for it he knows every snare every temptation and he gives a commandment now notice god says this god says this to he tells the same thing to abraham now here's abraham who we're going to get to just for a moment a man who the bible says was living in a strange country surrounded by uh some of the greatest nations in in history and not knowing where he's going not knowing where he's even what he's going to face he doesn't know the challenge that's going to await him tomorrow all god said was get up and leave and he says and i'm going to give you a promise abraham i'm going to promise you that that i'll bless you that your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and here was abraham who was traveling through a a strange country what is that word what does it mean when it says it was strange i'm sure there was a lot of weirdos in that country but but really what it means is is that he didn't know he had never seen it before it was strange unto him he had never passed that way before it wasn't like a destination that he had taken a journey that way but it was a strange country and the bible says he faced uh not knowing even what he would face yet notice in genesis 15 brother josh genesis 15 just get be ready um have your trigger finger ready here because i'm gonna i'm gonna say a lot of these so genesis 15 verse one notice what god tells abraham after these things the word of the lord came unto american division saying you can say it it's okay what was the first thing the lord tells abraham go get up get out of here lord it's a strange country i don't even know where to go i don't know what i'm going to do how am i going to live how am i going to eat where am i going to sleep what kind of problems will i face tomorrow how will i ever make it god says just go abraham and he says the word of the lord came to him with a vision say in the very first words he says to abraham fear not abraham you say why lord why wouldn't i fear because i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward i'm not just going to send an angel i'm not going to send a friend i'm not going to send another king from another nation to protect you i want you to know abraham you can have confidence not to fear the devil because i'm going to be your shield [Applause] hallelujah i'm thy shield i am thy exceeding great reward notice what he says i am thy shield that word shield means a wall that's what it means i am thy shield a wall i own a wall all around you glory it means a fortress that's what god was saying a fortress that word shield wasn't just a shield like you would have given night but it actually is a more richer meaning than that god says i am the wall that will surround you and protect you from all of your enemies and all of your foes i'll be your defense you know what god was saying abraham you're going to face challenges you're going to face difficulties but i'll be your wall i'll be your defender i'll be your protector can somebody say amen here tonight you know what abraham you know how abraham responded to that he believed amen let me give you abraham's response to god he believed he was a believer amen and you know what a believer does i believe he believes you know what a believer is made to do he's born to do he's anointed to do his seed gene that's down inside of him is is the purpose of a seed of abraham what was down inside of him it was to believe the word of god to accept the word of god to say i believe it lord do you understand to abraham no do you do do you does everything make sense to you no did god explain everything no did god give you the answer to all of your questions no but i believe hallelujah but i believe abraham's response to god was i believe lord he believed in the lord the bible says in hebrews he believed and it was accounted unto him for righteousness because why righteousness comes by believing the word of god notice god gives the same exact promise to his son isaac who isaac lived in a very uh a fearful land and a very hostile environment he was surrounded by philistines and every time isaac would try to dig a well they would bury isaac's whale and he'd try to dig another well they wanted him out of there they harassed him they wanted him out of his promised land and they tried to push him out of his promised land let me tell you something friends every day that every for every minute that you're in your promise satan will try to harass you out of it for every minute that you're standing in the holy spirit knowing where you stand as a believer in your promised land the devil will try to kick you out of there he'll try to do anything he can to push you off of what god has revealed to you amen but you know what isaac did isaac just stood his ground and believed the word of god amen notice isaac was was was surrounded by trouble the bible says as i said every time that he tried to dig a well uh and we don't have time to read it who would says where was he gonna get his water from the the well but every single time he tried to dig a well the philistines would come to bury it you ever felt like that you went through so much labor and so much effort for something only for the devil just to come and fill it all back in you know how tiring that must have been i'll give you another word you know how discouraging that must have been for every time he tried to to to to labor in something to dig a well back then drilling machines he was digging it literally digging it by hand and that the bible says that the philistines would fill it back up the philistines had stopped them and filled them with the earth the scripture says every time everywhere isaac went he traveled from that city to another city and he faced the same exact problem he calls over the bible says even called one well esac which means contention because that's what he was represented this is a land of contention there's constantly contention i get one word from that word contention all tension and if i can say anything about living in 2021 i got one word that's a good description tension amen am i preaching to anybody who could identify tension everything in this world is tension and it caused great discouragement no doubt to isaac even as hell he's trying to raise his children in a land of tension of contention he's trying to raise a family in a land of contention he's trying to provide for his own children by digging whales it was really going to be their water source and no doubt isaac could can name it that because every time that he tried to to do something to dig a well the philistines came in and they would just bury it and you know isaac could say god why did you have me move here god why don't you help me build a house here if it's just going to be trouble if it's just going to be contention and tension the whole time lord why are you even having me do this how am i ever going to make it and do you even have a plan for my life you ever felt that way oh i could i could see a great gloomy cloud coming over isaac i want you to notice what he says here in genesis 26 brother uh josh verse 15. i want you just to read this for a second notice what he says here and for all of his whales which is father servants that dig in the days of abraham's father philistines and stop them filled them with earth no doubt isaac was all troubled on every side how am i going to make it lord what am i going to do uh lord i i don't why did you even bring me here why am i planted here if it's always going to be tension you know what god answers him in verse 24 and notice what god says to isaac abraham's son in verse 24 and the lord appeared unto him the same night and said i am the god of abraham thy father fear not for i am with thee and i will bless thee and i will multiply thy seed for my servant abraham's sake in other words isaac you don't need to fear because the same promise that i gave your father is also an anointing upon your life and the same promise i gave him that i'll be a wall around him i'll protect him i'll deliver him is the same promise i'm giving you isaac let me just fast forward beyond abraham and isaac and come to you tonight god says the same promise that i gave abraham and i gave to his son isaac has been transferred by faith to your children to your family to your situation to your problem i am thy wall of defense amen amen saber the matter i'm a seed of abraham look at galatians 3 verse 29 i love this notice what it says here in galatians 3 verse 29 brother josh aldis wait for that good he says and if you be christ how many can say i'm christ then you then are you abraham's seed see how am i abraham's you ever asked that question i believe i'm i'm you know we're called father abraham had many sons and many sons had father how am i connected to abraham here's how galatians 6 because galatians 3 because who was abraham's notice it doesn't say to thy seeds plural but it says unto he told abraham unto thy seed and who was abraham's seed christ amen so paul says and if you be christ's i can put a check mark there and say yes that's me then you are by transferred promise abraham's seed and further than his seed you are heirs you know what it means to be an heir you're an heir according to the promise amen according to what promise the same promise he promised abraham has now been transferred to me i just want to stop and say thank you lord for that you say brother matt why is that so special because if i'm abraham's seed then the same god who was a shield to abraham in his greatest difficulty is still the same shield to me as a believer the same promise that he promised abraham that i'll protect you and i'll defend you is the same promise to me as a believer listen to what brother adam says here and i don't didn't want to take too much time i don't see the remote up here brothers for that you can control it that's just fine put that power point up listen to what brother branham says i don't want to miss these it's just too good to miss notice he says in confirmation and evidence the powerpoint that we had you have to close okay you got that notice now faith god told abraham here give him a promise and then god confirmed this promise to him let me pull up my mind because it's it's i got a notation in here let me just make sure i have it right he says now faith god told abraham gave him a promise and then god confirmed this promise to him give him an evidence by taking an oath before him genesis chapter 22 if you have your bible i just i i want you to turn to there just quickly if you could genesis chapter 22 i want you to look at this because it's it's important to understand what brother animal is even saying here because he says he confirmed to him by taking an oath before him genesis 22 verse 15. start at verse 15. you got your bible and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou has done this thing and is not withheld thy son thy only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sandwiches upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice what does brother madam say here and notice in the powerpoint he says god made an oath to him there was abraham here was god himself making a promise god says i swear that's a powerful word it's a powerful word so such a reverence to that word there should be as i swear you know we teach our children don't swear don't don't don't say that you know why because there's such a there's such a what word am i looking for there's a sacredness there should be when you swear by your word and when you give an oath to something and god doesn't do this in many places you read about in the bible in fact this is one of the only one of the first and one of the only times you'll find god swearing something and making a promise making an oath listen to what brother branham says here and he says to give him an evidence by taking an oath before him if you have that powerpoint and the immutable thing load notice and the immutable thing is that god cannot lie do you know now why it's so special when god swears something may not mean anything to you if i swear to you that i'll be at your house to help you tomorrow or i'll be there if you ever need me i swear that may may mean nothing to you at all but when you know why because i could lie and i could fail to keep my word but when god swears and when god makes a promise he swore by himself not by any person not by any condition but he swore by himself and brother branham says he says and the immutable thing is that god cannot lie it's not even possible and not only that when he promised notice and not only that when he promised him then beyond that he swore to it god taking an oath to himself say brother matt why is that important to me because you're a child of abe you're you're a seed of abraham not a natural seed you're a spiritual seed and if that's the case then the same promise the same immutability that god cannot lie applies to you and to me glory god's confirming his own word that he swore by an oath he says i swear unto you brother adam says god taken an oath to himself listen go on to the next slide this is what brother adam says here you've got to swear to someone greater than you and there was no one to swear to greater than himself so he swore to himself and the promise was unto abraham and is a conjunction notice and as a conjunction to his seed not just abraham but to your seed after you in other words when god had this thought in his mind that i'm gonna make a promise here i'm gonna swear by an oath god wasn't just looking at one man named abraham but god was looking at the entire line of abraham to every seed that would come after him i'm making an immutable promise abraham to every seed of abraham and all you have to do is believe yes you realize that all you have to do to claim abraham's promises is simply by faith believe them amen and it does so much to god when you believe his word brother branham says when you believe his word he says it makes him want to give you whatever you ask for that's what brother adam says he says it makes him love you and want to give you whatever you ask for why doing what brother man just believe in his word it means so much to god because at heart it is so it hurts the lord so much when we doubt his word and it means so much to him when we believe his word i say lord don't let me doubt your word lord let me believe your word amen notice this here and he says and he swore to himself and his seed after him not seeds but his seed and christ is the seed of abraham and we be it in christ the life of christ in us makes us abraham's children and our heirs with him according to the promise according to my word according to my conde my behavior no it's not based on my behavior according if i what i can do and what i can't do god says i'm not gonna make it based upon you i'm not gonna put it upon you whether you fail or you get up tomorrow or you stay down i'm going to swear by myself so that no matter what you do my promise still stands you love him for that notice hebrews 6 and don't don't take it down don't take it down everyone has a bible just turn in your bible quickly hebrews chapter 6 if you don't get there then then just stop trying to turn and just just listen along i'm going to give you just a minute hebrews chapter 6 so powerful here and he says in hebrews 6 verse 17 so when god notice so when god i want to i want you i want you to realize put if you could put that on the screen i'm sorry to go back and forth brother josh hebrews 6 verse 17 and i just realized now why i wanted to have that up because i want to i want to read this to you from the king james that i want to read it to you from a different translation notice hebrews 6 verse 17 wherein god wherein god willing willing what does that mean he's desiring it's his will he wants to do this this isn't something that you even had to ask him to do but paul says wherein god wanting willing desiring more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise are you an heir of the promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath what is that saying it's saying that he didn't even have to swear he never had to there was no one forcing him to god had no he didn't have any obligation to swear it he could have just said it and required you to believe it amen notice why hebrews 6 verse 17 listen here so when god desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose so when god had a desire and he wanted what is what was you say brother matt wise why are you getting so excited over this because i see it that god says i had a desire i want to convince you i want to make sure i want it i don't have to do this but i'm going to do something to show you the unchangeable character of my purpose to show you how positive sure that that i am i'm going to swear it by an oath you know what hebrews you go through this entire book of hebrews and you read all of hebrews 6. what is it it's god encouraging you you can believe this you can trust this you don't have to doubt this you can believe it by and you can have faith so that you could receive why lord why would you do that because worse than you want to obtain the promise that god has given god wants you to obtain that promise more than you want to say lord i want to believe what you've promised god wants you so bad to believe what he's promised and he says i'm going to encourage you in your faith and so what does god do he goes to abraham here in verse 15. go go back to verse 15 brother josh in hebrews 6 for men barely swear for and and so after he had patiently introduced him pointing to abraham and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise god wasn't content not he god wasn't content just to offer a promise to abraham and to abraham's seed and also his descendants but god wasn't satisfied just to offer a promise but he said i want to confirm it right now i want to swear by it i want to put my own word there say why lord so that you can have faith so that you can believe it so that you can claim it i'm going to swear by an oath men's words can can change men's words can men's character one day he thinks this and the next day he believes this and one day he's up and one day he's down but god says but so i'm not going to swear by any man i'm not going to make it a promise that's connected to any person or any ernie or any condition but i'm going to swear it to myself i don't have to because you say brother matt why does it have to be because the bible says that in god is light there's no darkness at all there's no chance in fact the bible says it's impossible for him to even lie but i but just just because i want to convince you i have a desire to to to anchor it in your soul i'm going to swear by an oath he desired i love this translation he desired to show more convince convincingly the immutability of his character of his purpose to all the children of god this is why he promised it you know why because it's part of you you're in your nature it's part of your sinful nature to doubt do you realize that that it's too that it did in every person all of us me included all of us there's something that's in our makeup something that's in our d our human dna our human structure our human the way that the the that we're made in sin born in sin shaped an iniquity there's a propensity for us not to believe his word not to believe the impossible not to believe what we can't see it's oh sure we can believe anything that we that's why we we need to see it to believe it god needs to sometimes perform it before our own eyes before we'll finally say ah now i believe it because it's not in you naturally it's in you as a christian it's in you to doubt the word of god it's in you to not believe what you can't see it's in you to the things the promises of god that you haven't realized yet it's natural in your sinful condition to say i just don't know lord i'm just not sure god do you know that's natural for you to doubt thomas was a doubter too here here was the bible tells the story of thomas that that that you know after even after all of the disciples had witnessed and told him about the resurrected christ and how they had how they thomas still the bible says the bible says thomas still doubted still still doubted what the what what the that he had risen you imagine here's here's all of the disciples and here's all of the believers rejoicing and excited and testifying and here's one person who just can't believe now it was easy for them to believe because they had seen him thomas had it yet you know what the bible says that jesus appeared unto them and here was thomas the doubter thomas always questioning and the bible says that jesus appears and you know what the lord doesn't begin to hug all of his disciples and they begin to embrace and they're beginning to rejoice and beginning to shout you could see thomas over there in the corner you know trying to get the you know the matter out of his eyes am i really seeing this and jesus is over there hugging and and they're all embracing they're all rejoicing and they're all testifying and you know as jesus hugs peter he glares over thomas as he's pat and peter on the back oh peter i mean old thomas really after all you wouldn't believe you're sitting there in doubt not believing you know what pete you know what thomas had said thomas had said i won't believe unless i touch his hands and i can feel the nail scarred if i can put my put my hands in his hand he said unless i could touch his own hands i wouldn't believe you know what jesus does jesus doesn't glare at him he doesn't even rebuke him as he does many times before the resurrection he'd rebuke them then he'd speak to the storm but he never rebukes thomas he walks over to thomas and says here thomas here's my hands touch them is that what helps you to believe thomas whatever helps you whatever brings and raises your faith brother branham said this he said james says lay your hands upon the sick and they shall recover and every person asks brother random says brother brandon but the a real gentile faith is it's just to believe we shouldn't have to have our hands laid on us brother adam says that's true he says real gentile faith he says but god will meet you he'll condemn to you at whatever level you're at god will condemn send himself down to you and say if this is what you need in order to believe i'll do it for you because i want you to believe my word and never doubt my word so i'll reveal myself to you at whatever level you can give me i'm glad that's the kind of savior glad that's the kind of father i'm glad that's my creator he doesn't kick me aside when i doubt his word or i'm having trouble believing or i'm having trouble obtaining but he says i'll condemn sin down to your level and i'll meet you at whatever faith you can give me and brother adam says even if it means laying he says if that's what it takes for delay or an elder or minister to lay his hands upon you said god doesn't dishonor that god honors that because he sees that's what level of faith that you have hallelujah i said hallelujah what does it mean god is swearing he's saying to he's saying it doesn't it doesn't matter instead of leaving you in your doubt instead of just kicking you over to the side but in mercy and in love god promises and swears to us i swear by myself and god says and i got a promise for you abraham and it transcends you and your natural seed it's going to carry over to christ because christ is my is the see is he is the seed and whoever is in christ is a seed of abraham listen what brother adam says i'm not going to be too much longer here listen to what brother adam says he says he says when he promised him then beyond that he swore he says he says in christ in the seat of abraham let's go to the fourth slide all i want you to notice that this promise that god made abraham wasn't only just to abraham but it was to his seed after him now many people says oh if if i'd been like abraham if i would have have been where god had talked to me and give me the assurance like he did abraham then i would have i would really have faith brother branham if i just had brother madam says if god had talked to me he's still quoting this here a person saying this if god had talked to me like you did abraham brotherhood stops but you have the same promise that abraham had if you're a seed of abraham he says then you say brother brother branham i'm a gentile go to the next slide you say brother burnham but i'm a gentile i could i could not have the seed of abraham the seed of abraham wasn't the natural seed it was the spiritual seed for the circumcision of that was nothing he says for the circumstances that was nothing the promise he even give him before circumcision but it was given to him before circumcision and it wasn't because he was circumcised and in the covenant with god that way it's because that abraham believed god it wasn't because of his circumcision it wasn't because of all of his obedience lord why'd you swear to him because he believed me because there was something in abraham that believed me you know how important it is for my children to believe my word does your word mean anything to you amen means something to you doesn't it as a christian as a man i'll speak to to to all believers here but especially to men or something about the word your word means something you know it discourages you when someone doubts your word especially those who you love and you make a promise to you you promise you promise something to someone who you love and you tell them i'm gonna you can you know i'm going to be there i'll be there to help you and you you can count on me you know what it bothers you when you get a text later you know or just making sure you're still coming it's like didn't i say i didn't i say i was does my word mean nothing have i done anything to to to to make you doubt my character that when i promise something you know why because it means something to you when you make a promise anybody feel that way when you say something i'm not talking about when you frivolously say it i'm saying when you really put your name behind something and you you make a promise to it you want it it pleases you when when those who you love believe what you say and let me just say if you how much more the lord jesus when he says something in his word how much it must do how much it must hurt him when we question that word or when we doubt that word or that when we have trouble believing it but brother how much it must bless him when we really by faith and i just want to say lord i believe your word i want to by faith believe your word and accept what you've said without doubting without questioning without wondering i want to believe your word scripture says that when we are dead and notice the next one scripture says that when we are dead in christ we become abraham's seed paul speaks of it and that which is jew is not jew outwardly but jew inwardly therefore if you are born of the spirit of god you are abraham's seed and our heirs with abraham according to the promise therefore every promise that god gave abraham is yours somebody say it tonight it's mine he says every promise that he gave abraham is yours because spiritually you are abraham's seed now but when you have separated yourself from the things of the world next slide crossed over that separating line and are so journeyed in a strange land a land like you wasn't in how many are sojourning in a land like i wasn't in am i in my sin i'm not there anymore i'm so journey and i'm not i'm you say brother matt you're still in the states you didn't move out of the country no i didn't i didn't move out of the country when i gave my heart to the lord but i very much moved out of this cosmos and this worldly system i'm not sojourning in that land anymore i'm a pilgrim and a stranger in the beginning notice here with a people that you never associated with in the beginning then you become no no go back and he says in the beginning with the people that you never associated with in the beginning then you become a spiritual jew you say brother man what are you tonight i'm a jew by faith i'm a spiritual jew how because i left the other thing i heard from my theophany i left the world in the worldly systems and i'm so journeying to a better country a better home a better life a better land one who's builder and maker is god not this one the next one because the same way that abraham by faith left his country left his people went into a strange land with strange people next slide he says you have left your people speaking to christians hello you left your people left the world behind left your associates behind crossed over through the blood of jesus christ and are sojourners seeking for a city whose builder and maker is god like abraham was pilgrims along with him dwelling in tents churches fellow citizens of the kingdom of heaven heirs of all things through jesus christ we have crossed over separated amen separated just as israel you can you can end that there brother josh just as israel separated just as abraham left his country you think of of all of abraham's seed think of israel as they left and they crossed over into the promised land what were they they were a seed of faith they were born to believe they were born to believe the word of god listen friends the real true faith the abraham's kind of faith was abraham believed god before it came to pass i said abraham believed god before it ever manifested are you a believer here tonight you say why are you believer is it because of because you've seen god and he's promised he's kept his own word it started way before that even before i seen it i believed it before it was manifested i believed it and tonight before i see the promise come to pass i want to let you know lord i believe it long before a real believer real abraham's faith real true seed faith of abraham is a faith that believes before the promise shadrach meshach and abednego didn't wait to get into the fire and see the fourth man before they believed if they had they would have never seen the fourth man but god required that before they before the fourth man appeared they first had to believe in the fourth man and before god could show up in your trial before he could show up in your fiery furnace you've got to have the same faith and say in spite of whether i see you whether i feel you whether i touch you whether i can see any promise of god coming to pass in my life before i step into the fire i believe in the fourth man i believe in a god who could show up at the very last moment when everything seemed too late god can still show up amen because that's real faith daniel had to believe in the god of jehovah long before he went into the lion's den he already believed amen are you here tonight think of it israel even even notice this here the bible says they come out of egypt with a high hand and pharaoh you know the story trapped before them uh here here they were in a in what seemed like a hopeless situation a hopeless predicament they were trapped with the red sea in front of them and mountains but pirahata forget the name of the of the two mountains but they were they were history says they were they were steep incline made out of a certain type of rock that would cut you you couldn't just walk up it they had nowhere to go the red sea in front of them pharaoh's army behind them you know the story very well it seemed like god had led them into this hopeless situation in it entrapment left is a mountain on the right is a mountain in front of me is a red sea behind me is an entire army that's upset mad angry and wants to kill me and doesn't believe in my god and here they are trapped what are they going to do and so the bible says they begin to cry and and and and begin to begin to cry unto moses you know that's very familiar story you've heard it so many times you don't hear they were crying unto god and led by the spirit of god this is this wasn't moses didn't make a wrong turn he didn't he didn't accidentally turn by the red sea but go read the story god has them turned by perihoth and the two mountains god is the one who led them to this hopeless situation and the scripture says that they had led there and had but purposely by the lord you know they were completely hopeless the bible says that they begin to panic and begin to cry out and begin to well and begin to moan i could see families and mothers who have children and fathers who have wives all of them begin to blame moses and why would god lead us out here let us we were better as slaves in israel in egypt better off as slaves they go on to say that further in the story down in the wilderness oh it'd have been better for us just to die of slaves than to come out here into this wilderness and just have our graves out here and there there they are at the red sea moses why'd you bring us out here why'd you have us leave egypt were there not enough graves in egypt that we couldn't be buried there and the bible says you have to believe just for a moment i have to think that maybe you know even moses himself you know lord what in the world here we've cut you you all after all of after all that you've done and all the signs and wonders that you've shown imagine moses the bible says that even moses began to cry and and god says in exodus 14 you don't have to turn god says moses wherefore christ thou unto me why in other words why no sympathy god don't you see that maybe you could look down and you can see from your view that got impossible and possible and impossible and impossible and we're surrounded by impossible right we're gonna die and god says why crying moses you remember the scripture why are you crying moses you know what god does god says speak why cry speak unto the children of israel that they go forward suddenly the bible says the winds begin to come moses you know the story takes his staff puts it in the red sea and the waters begin to part and here's this great miracle great miraculous sign as you can imagine how miraculous it would be this great ocean as david said stood up in like a heap just like two mounds of dirt and it just stood up before them and a pathway from that side of this of the red sea they could see clearly now to the other side of the red sea i hope you hear me here tonight they could see from this side what was this side their death their trouble their trial their destruction their problem the issue they could now see from their darkness and their impossibility they can now see all the way to the other side where there was safety and where there was peace and the bible says that now this great miracle thus saith the lord notice you don't have to turn thus the lord saved israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians exodus 14 turn i'm just trying to be in a hurry but i want you to catch this exodus 14 verse 30. i want you to read this can you give me about five more minutes it's only 8 35 here notice it says thus saith the lord thus the lord saved israel this is exodus 14 i think verse 30 if we've got it right out of the hand of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the seashore now you know what you know you know what they're feeling now what a night and day difference now they went from crying thinking they were all going to die and now they're looking at the egyptians who harassed them who beat them who were coming to kill them now they're all dead and they're dead upon the seashore the scripture says next verse and israel saw the great work which the lord did upon the egyptians and the people feared the lord and believed the lord and his servant moses i want you to look very closely look it read it again and israel saw the great work which the lord did upon the egyptians and the people feared the lord and believed the lord and his servant moses they were believers they believed but when did they believe when the enemy was dead when there was no more trouble when there was no more struggle when there was no more pressure when there was no more impossibility now they're dancing and singing and the bible says notice in verse chapter 15 brother josh verse 1 and 2 notice this here suddenly they break out and tambourines singing rejoicing scripture says verse 1 of chapter 15 the very next chapter then notice then then not before not when there was is not when there was egyptians you hear me tonight church not when they were about to get killed they weren't singing then they weren't dancing then they weren't rejoicing them but then after they were dead after the enemy was defeated after they were on the other side and all the egyptians were dead then they sang then saying notice then saying moses and the children of israel this song unto the lord and spake saying i will sing unto the lord for he hath to triumph gloriously the horse and his rider he hath thrown into the sea keep going the next verse verse two the lord is my strength and song and he has become my salvation he is my god was he not your salvation before was he not your strength before now he's your song now he's your victory now he's your strength now you have salvation he is my god and i will prepare him a habitation my father's god and i will exalt you i want you to notice something that maybe you've never thought about before they were singing a good song a godly song all the words were true they were shouting and saying very wonderful things things that we could read and say the lord is my strength and song he's become my salvation i could read that and say amen that's true that's good bless god he's my salvation he's became my savior but let me tell you something it was the right song but they should have been singing it on the other side of the red sea not this side of the red sea this side of the red sea the battle was over but when does faith when is faith most important when is faith when is this type of song the most important to god not after you've came out of the trial but when you're in the middle of the darkest moment of the most impossible situation of what looks hopeless then god says now sing your song of deliverance now sing your song of victory now's the time to get the tambourine when brother matt when the clouds are dark when it looks impossible when the situation is hopeless a believer believes the word in the midst of his darkest moment a real believer was born to believe when it looks completely hopeless [Applause] what's god saying god saying i want you to believe on this side not on that side but when it looked impossible when pharaoh's army was behind when there was a mountain on the left on the right and a red sea in front of you god says that's when you're supposed to sing that's when you're supposed to believe i say lord help me to believe help me to believe then then lord on that side the bible says oh think about it verse 14 brother josh verse chapter 15 as the musicians can come verse 15 if you could put that up notice what they say then the dukes of edom shall be amazed the mighty men of moab trembling shall take hold upon them all the inhabitants of canaan shall melt away why because of what god had done verse 16 notice notice here they are fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone till the till thy people pass over o lord till the people pass over which thou has purchased amen say brother matt that was a good song that was a powerful song that was right but how much more it would have meant to god if they could have sang that song on the other side of the red sea and how much more it means to god you say oh i'm going to sing a song when i get over there when all my battles are over and all the war is over oh i'm going to shout and rejoice then god's saying you should shout and rejoice now if you want victory now you were born to believe the word of god don't wait to see it abraham but before you ever have a manifestation of it believe because it means so much to god you can play something for me it means so much to god stand to your feet it means so much to the lord and i just want to say every head bowed every eye closed let's just raise our hands for a minute i want to say lord help me to believe to be a believer because i'm abraham's seed your promise what is the promise to the believer to live in the land of the holy spirit it's a different world it's like a different it's a different place it's a different you've got to come out of this condition of doubt you've got to move into that world i want to say lord help me to believe when i can't believe when it seems impossible when it seems like everything's against me and and it seems like all the odds are stacked against me when it seems like it's impossible but lord i want to raise a hand and say but lord i'm not waiting for you to perform it i'm not waiting to even see the first sign that anything's going to change right now i was born to believe and i'm going to raise my hand and say lord i believe it right now i accept it right now i claim it right now i have i want to be a child of abraham i have a seed of abraham who the bible says i want the word to be mixed with faith i don't want to come short of the promise of god but i want to claim every promise you've given me i want to take hold for my family for my job for my health for my children lord whatever it would be here tonight you see hands raised up everywhere [Music] help us realize lord we're children of abraham never born to believe the word of god they weren't born to doubt not born to be you even commanded your children don't fear them but lord many times i've been afraid but you're reminding me here tonight to say anytime you feel that sense of fear and that sense of discouragement just remember what i did yesterday remember the victory that i've given you remember i brought you out of the land of egypt and i promised and i swore by myself and i swore and it's impossible for me to lie lord then i'll believe it i'll raise my hands and say god i believe it i accept it jesus i accept it here tonight what do you play [Music] oh yes

continued prayer tonight for my daughter and mariah it was in the hospital i'm sure many of you know last sunday us was there for two nights and um they thought that they had it figured out it was appendicitis and they were gonna remove her appendix and then there was some confusion on that not confusion but the confusion between the first neurologist and the second did more ct scans they thought it was said it's something else we'll treat it with antibiotics so they've given her that and she just continues to be in pain not not great pain thankfully like she was in but continue with some discomfort they and it could very well still be what they thought it was in antibiotics or just have need to run their course but she's suffering and i don't like to see her suffering like that
