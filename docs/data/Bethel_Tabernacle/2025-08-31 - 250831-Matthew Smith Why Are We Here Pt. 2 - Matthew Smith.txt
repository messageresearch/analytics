TRANSCRIPT
========================================
stand and have a word of prayer. Gracious Father, Lord, we come before you this morning, inviting you into our Sunday school service. That Lord, that you could your spirit could move even here. That Lord, that I would come to you with an open heart. That Lord, something that might be said could perhaps touch the heart of someone who would hear it. We could have instruction, understanding of your word. Father with which to some ammunition, Father, with which to fight the spirits of these this age. We ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Want to um going to if the Lord Lord willing um kind of continue my thought from last week um title being why are we here? And I I want to take for a a part two sort of a subtitle today, the three-fold purpose of God. Um, I'm going to try to go a little kind of slow. There's old military saying, slow is smooth and smooth is fast, right? So, I'm going to kind of slow down, take my time, and try to go through it a little kind of smoothly, and hopefully we can go get through it quickly. It is a large topic, and I probably won't be able to get it all done today. But, um, for a t uh a text, I I want to read two places. Um, well, we'll we'll read one scripture briefly, and then you y'all can sit down. So, we're going to read Genesis chapter 3 and verse 4. Um, and uh, for the sake of time, I'll just read it. If they put it up on the screen, you can read it there. Or if you fast, you can turn to it. Um, Genesis 3 and verse4. And the serpent said unto the woman, "You shall not surely die. For God doth know that in a day you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil." And when the woman saw that that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof to eat, and gave also to her husband with her, and he did eat. Y'all can be seated. Um, I also want to read Revelations 21. Um, and we'll start at verse one. And it says Revelations 21 and verse one, "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride, adorned for her husband." And we skip down to verse 9. And there came unto me one of the seven angels, which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the lamb's wife. And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God. Now, I I read these two scriptures because I want to illustrate something um sort of a a key point, right? And it's kind of right there in the subtitle. Um that there's a purpose to the Bible. There's a purpose to God's plan. Everything that is and has been created has a point. There's a a plan for it in place. And the Bible is, you know, written by the greatest storyteller that ever was. And every storyteller, every good story begins with a conflict, right? It begins with a a crisis. It begins with a problem that needs to be solved. And then the story is about how we go about what trials and tribulations we go through and what the the process was to resolve that. And then the conclusion of the story, the final act of the story is the protagonist returning back to where they started with the solution to the problem, right? That we return that the the the way a good story ends is when we're back where we started with the problem solved that made us leave in the first place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's ex So I'm showing you in the beginning. This is, you know, Genesis chapter 3 kind of right there in the beginning of here's the crisis, right? Here's the crisis. Adam and Eve, man falls and it the the method by which they fall is that Satan came in and disrupted the family. &gt;&gt; He broke the the structure, the unity of God's family. And it ends the conclusion of the story, the final act is the the God's people returned back to where they started &gt;&gt; with the initial conflict, the the sin resolved, &gt;&gt; right? We have a resolution. And so, but ultimately the the beginning state and the ending state is God's family in unity back in an Eden condition as a family under &gt;&gt; in God's house. Um and I want to read um this is from oneness in 1962 February 11th. Now the first man and first woman in the garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God so much that God could come down at any time he desired and talk lipto ear with Adam and Eve. Now that is perfect oneness. God and his creation. God speaking lipto ear with Adam and Eve. And they were so perfect in harmony with God till they were one with God. God and his family was one. And any man and his family, a correct, good, noble, obedient family is one with another. I'm going to read that again. Any man and his family, a correct, good, noble, obedient family is one with another. any family. And if there's something in the family that moves them apart, then it's not right. &gt;&gt; The family's broken somewhere. They should all be one. Father with mother, mother with father, children with parents, parents with children, all in agreement. And when you see that, you'll see one lovely picture. That's God's purpose. Okay? That's God's purpose to see families in unity one with another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna I'm gonna re emphasize something. He says any man and his family, a correct, good, noble, obedient family, if your family does not have oneness, does not have unity, if there's a wedge between parents and children, it is not a good family. Right? Because he says that's what the prophet said. A good family is one that has oneness. If there's not oneness, you don't have a good family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If there's a wedge between husband and wife, you do not have a noble family. It is not a good thing. Okay? Anything that comes between the members of the family is wrong. You cannot have dissension in the family if because what happens is we let things come into our family and break up the family unity and you know parents man it's just such a big thing um where to even begin with this listen when you have the hearts of the children leave the home because there's been a wedge there's been an emotional or spiritual wedge driven into the home because something was said, something was done. Now the the children are offended, right? The dad made a mistake or or didn't take the time to take care of the emotional needs of his children and now there's an emotional wedge there that's that the devil is hammering farther and farther down and it's driving those children's hearts out of their home. Yeah, they still live there, but they don't live there in their heart. They're looking for every excuse to go out the door. &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. &gt;&gt; You could have a husband and a wife that something was said, something was done. Might have been something minor, but it's just another straw on the camel's back and eventually something breaks and now the the wife's heart leaves the home. Husbands husband Yeah. They're they're under the same roof. They're married in name only, &gt;&gt; right? They they're effectively trying to raise children in a broken marriage out of wedlock because the the the love that binds the marriage together is broken. And this is this is the goal of Satan because and you know it's the Satan it's Satan's goal because that was his goal in the very beginning. That's what he did in the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? That's how Satan attacked God and his family was to drive a wedge and drag God's family to family court. Right? Now we have a marriage and divorce situation. Now we have, you know, Adam raising children that aren't his. Now we have stepchildren involved because that's how Satan will attack God's children every single time. It's not a coincidence that we see the social issues that we have today because that's the product of when you let Satan run the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Um and so God if God's great purpose and we want to get into this. What was God's three-fold purpose? This is from Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Um, now God had a purpose and a hidden mystery. And that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning. The hidden mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began. And now and how that it's unfolded itself right down to the present hour that we're living in. See, then you will understand clearly. Then you will see, I believe, what is being done. And um I'm just kind of taking some excerpts because we don't have time to go through the whole thing. But um he says, "See, God has this all to himself. It's a secret. And that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of a half hour and seven thunders uttered their voices." And John was even forbidden from writing it. See, the coming of the Lord, that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he'll come and when he will come. So here he is, brother Brandham talking about that part of this mystery is the seventh seal, right? The the sealing of the seals that that that even John there was a silence in heaven for the space of a half hour. John isn't allowed to write because there's a there's a mystery that's being bound up here, right? There's a mystery going to be tied up that's going to be released in the last day. And God's keeping it a secret, right? He's got a big secret that's from before the foundation of the world. It's the whole point of everything. And he says, "And he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible." Therefore, the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ. The entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose. He wanted to achieve in the entire Bible. And all the acts of the believers in the Bible has been in type and expressing what God's great goal is. &gt;&gt; Okay? So the entire Bible from cover to cover had one purpose behind it, right? It's what brother Brandham just said. He has one purpose in the entire Bible. There's a goal that he's trying to achieve. It's it's the reason he did started from the very beginning before the foundation of the world. That's what he set out to do. That's the whole reason he built all of this. &gt;&gt; Amen. is to achieve one goal. Notice God has a threefold purpose in this great mystery secret. God in his great mystery secret that he had before the world began, he got a three-fold purpose in it. And now what we want to go up this morning is what is that three-fold purpose? I'm sure you all can just rattle off the three-fold purpose. what the three purposes are off the top of your head. Anybody? Nope. I couldn't either. That's why it's Sunday school. So, he says, um, right? So, so here we have God. He's got three purposes, right? It's a three-fold purpose he's got in this mystery. The whole reason the world has began is wound up in this. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, uh I might be able to read the quote if if I have it. Um but I'll summarize it because time flies when you're having fun. Um I'm going to summarize it into three bullet points, but it is in Christ the mystery of God revealed. I highly encourage you all to go listen to and read that. Um but he has I'm going to just summarize it. Number one, the first purpose was Jehovah expressed to his people as a father. &gt;&gt; Two, to have preeminence in his people who take on his nature and express his life as a husband to his wife. And three, the redemption of God's family back to their original state as they were in the Garden of Eden, a united family. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God's threefold purpose, I know this is rocket science, three-fold purpose was to have children, a wife, and a family. &gt;&gt; Wow. Shocking. I know. But but ser I mean, but but we kind of we because it's so simple, we don't take it seriously. Right. &gt;&gt; The problem is we don't take it seriously and then we end up deviating from God's plan because we're not taking his purpose in life seriously, right? It's vital. It's not a small thing. Family order and family structure, the way husbands treat their wives and the way wives treat their husbands and the way children interact with their parents is not uh it's not a side benefit of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. It's the whole point, right? It's not just like a thrown in on the deal. It's the whole deal, right? It's God's purpose is to have unity in his people down to the family unit because it's a small microcosm of what he's trying to do on the whole. &gt;&gt; Right? And you know, you don't we we talk about the family structure is a type of God's family. That's not nothing, right? Types are very, very important to God. Types and shadows and reflections because &gt;&gt; God communicates in types. God's ways are so much above ours, we can't comprehend them. We can't wrap our head around God's laws in their entirety. So what does he do is he takes one of his laws and he condenses it into a story and he packs it down into a little flesh and blood example and puts it in the Bible so that we can see what is God's great universe spanning law condensed into the flesh and blood of fallen man. Right? That's what a type is. It's a reflection of this massive thing condensed into a small thing into into your life. And so that's why types are important. You know, Moses, I'll give you a an example. Moses smites the rock. Water comes forth. They need water again later. And he's the God tells him to speak to the rock and instead Moses gets a temper about it and smites the rock again. And then because of that, Moses was not allowed to enter the promised land. Okay. Brother Brandham said it's because Moses broke God's type, right? God couldn't allow him into the promised land because he broke the type. The type being that Christ, the rock, was smitten 2,000 years ago. Water came forth, spirit came forth, fed the people, right? There's an outpouring of of the spirit at the day on the day of Pentecost. And then fast forward in our day, we don't smite the rock again. He's the high priest of our confession. We speak to the rock. And the same Holy Ghost that poured out on them then would pour out again. &gt;&gt; Okay? And and when that happens, it would take them into the promised land, right? That that happened right before they enter the promised land, which is the Holy Spirit, right? The the full manifestation of the Holy Ghost. What Moses did was he got himself out of the type of those that would speak to the rock as the high priest of their confession. And instead he put himself into the type of those who had crucified Christ aresh because he smoked him twice. &gt;&gt; Right? Instead Moses got out of this type and into a different type. And because of that, God can't allow Moses to go into the promised land for the same reason God can't allow the denominational world to have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, a true actual Holy Ghost experience because they've crucified Christ twice. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. They're not they're not you uh uh speaking to the rock. And if God allowed Moses to enter the promised land, then the denominational world in this day would have precedent, they would have legal precedent with God to have full access to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit like the bride does when God can't allow that. So because God can't allow it here, he couldn't have allowed Moses into the promised land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? The type has to follow. And that's exactly what we do in the modern day when we think oh well the family structure and and children and the relationships between family is not that important that it's just a side we don't center it as one of the core fundamental purposes of our lives. What ends up happening is when you break fellowship in the family, you're moving out of the type of of God's children in the Garden of Eden, and now you're moving into the type of God's children on the other side of a flaming sword. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. That that what the fall did was it it had to it pushed God's children out of his presence, out of that lip-to-ear communication, and put a flaming sword between them that says, "We can't communicate. you there can no be no direct communication because there's sin in the in in the uh in you and if you tried to enter God's presence it would kill you right not not that God would strike you dead but that just your existence would cease to be right if if if God is the is the the life of God is the you know cosmic bleach that dissolves sin to its very essence and just disintegrates it. If you enter God's presence sinfully you will disintegrate. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. It's not it's not God striking you dead. It's it's just it's matter and antimatter. They it dissolves, right? This is why God puts a flaming sword there. You can't do this because he doesn't want you doesn't want you to disintegrate. So because so when you when you break communication in the family and the family the the the relationship between husband and wife is broken the relationship between mother the the parents and the children is broken and everything's in disarray in the family God can't speak in that family that family is now there's a flaming sword between that family and God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have scriptures 1 Corinthians 11 and verse three. But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man. The head of Christ is uh head of Christ is God. Every man praying or prophesying have having his head covered dishonereth his head. But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoreth her head. For that is even all as if she were shorn. And then skipping to verse 13. Judge in yourselves. It is. Is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? Doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given her for a covering. But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God. So if a woman cuts her hair, she dishonors her h her head and as such it is unseammly for her to pray. &gt;&gt; That's what that's what Apostle Paul just said. Okay? She dishonors her head. If a woman dishonors her head, she no longer has access to God. There's a flaming sword between her and God. Right? There's a wedge between husband and wife. That's what the what he just said. If the woman dishonors her head and allows a wedge to come between her and her husband, she can no longer have access to God until that's resolved. Right? Brother Ram said she can't pray with cut hair unless it's a prayer of repentance. Now going to 1 Peter chapter 3. Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands, that if any obey not the word, they also may be without the word be one by the conversation of the of the wives. While they behold you, chasteed your chasteed conversation coupled with fear. whose adorning, let it not be that outward adorning of plating hair, and of wearing of gold, and of putting on of apparel, but let it be the hidden man of the heart, and that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. For after this manner in the old time, the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands, even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord, whose daughters ye are, as long as you do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. So, here's Peter laying out in pretty practical terms what it means to honor your head as a woman. And then he says in verse 7, likewise ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered. &gt;&gt; So if a man does not honor his wife and treats her with the dignity and respect that she deserves as a child of God and as the as the she's doing all this stuff, right? cuz cuz he said that um uh where is it? Uh but let it be of the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God of great price. Right? That when a woman is behaving like a lady, God sees her as of great price. She is very valuable to God when she's behaving like a lady. And if and if the woman is behaving like a lady and the man does not honor her accordingly, God cuts him off. Ouch. Right. Husbands, treat your wives like they are the purchase of God. They God's blood paid for that woman. &gt;&gt; Paid to save her. And if you don't treat her as such, you have you have you have dishonored God and his family. And God will cut you off right there. You have driven a wedge into your home. You have you've treated her disrespectfully. And there God puts a flaming sword between you and him. your prayers will not be answered. Right? The same I mean this goes all the way to the bottom the the way h you know I'm running out of time so I can't really go too much into more into it today but I will just end with this. This is what I was going to hope to end on last time but here we are. Um I just wrote a bunch of questions rhetorical questions. I'm not going to take a quiz. Um, I said, "Do we suppose do we suppose that if family was the purpose of God when he formed our bodies that our biology and therefore psychology would contradict that?" Right? Do we think that we just special and that, you know, we don't we're not just naturally inclined to follow God's word and our biology if that's how God built us? Do we suppose that if God made us in his image, with his attributes, and with the same needs of the heart as himself, that we could just ignore them and suffer no consequences? Do we suppose that if God's great purpose was to have a family that Satan's disruption of that original family was a coincidence? Do we suppose that this modern that in this modern age so intent on disrupting the original pattern of the family is also a coincidence? Do we suppose that our individual freedom and liberty can run contrary to the foundation of our existence and the result and result in lasting fulfillment? Do we suppose the that the natural does not type the spiritual? Do we suppose that we can tr truly be the fulfillment of the invisible union between the earthly bride and the heavenly groom when we do not have a revelation on what God means by the word marriage? And do we suppose that God is unconcerned with the unity in our earthly families given his entire purpose of being is tied to having a united family? &gt;&gt; Amen. If the three-fold purpose of God and the entire Bible culminates in a marriage complete with an invisible union, a wedding supper, a millennial honeymoon, and finally king and queen sitting on the throne together, do we then suppose that he is nonchalant about the line and order of his word concerning earthly marriages? And that's where I've got to stop. We're out of time. God bless you all. I love you guys. I will see you later.
