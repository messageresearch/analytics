[0:00] time to the studies of your word Lord we
[0:02] ask that your Holy Spirit would come and
[0:04] speak to us and teach us the Lord help
[0:06] us to get ourselves out of the way that
[0:08] you would be magnified and glorified and
[0:09] we would know how to live in this dark
[0:11] and evil age father we we asked your
[0:15] blessing upon each one
[0:18] commit these things to you in the name
[0:20] of Jesus Christ amen
[0:22] so start a new subject today I'm titling
[0:25] it seven women take hold of one man and
[0:29] if you want to go ahead and pull that
[0:30] PowerPoint up and we're going to read in
[0:32] Isaiah chapter 4.
[0:35] strange title right
[0:39] so Isaiah 4 and you go ahead and go to
[0:42] the first screen and in that day seven
[0:44] women shall take hold of one man saying
[0:47] we will eat our own bread and wear our
[0:49] own apparel only let us be called by thy
[0:51] name to take away our reproach in that
[0:54] day shall the branch of the Lord be
[0:55] beautiful and glorious and the fruit of
[0:58] the Earth shall be excellent and calmly
[1:01] for them that are escaped of Israel amen
[1:03] may the Lord add the blessing to the
[1:05] reading of his word he could be seated
[1:13] so looking in this verse I want you to I
[1:18] want you to see that number one
[1:21] um a woman
[1:22] is a type of the church
[1:24] so you see the woman in society you're
[1:27] going to see the direction of the church
[1:28] you're going to see sisters
[1:31] in the true elect that's the direction
[1:34] that the elector going right and so
[1:36] those things are parallel to one another
[1:40] let's look at some quotes
[1:42] brother Branham in recognizing your day
[1:45] and its message says they don't
[1:46] recognize second Timothy 3 where it said
[1:49] in the last days men would be heady
[1:51] high-minded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:53] lovers of God truce Breakers false
[1:56] accusers incontinent and despisers of
[1:58] those that are good the bride see having
[2:01] a form of godliness but denying the
[2:03] power thereof
[2:06] for this is the kind
[2:09] that'll go from house to house and Lead
[2:11] silly women silly women LED away with
[2:13] diverse lusts never learning or never
[2:16] able to come to the knowledge of the
[2:18] truth never they wouldn't do it
[2:20] and they won't do it God said so
[2:23] in blind Pharisee can't you see it I'm
[2:25] not angry I'm just driving the nail and
[2:27] then clenching it neither does the
[2:29] churches recognize that this the women
[2:31] can't understand it
[2:36] they're supposed
[2:38] uh silly women LED away with diverse
[2:41] lusts Hollywood all this kind of stuff
[2:44] Bob here wearing shorts wearing makeup
[2:47] all this kind of stuff which is
[2:48] Unbecoming do you know the woman plays a
[2:50] great part in the last days
[2:53] you know the Bible said that those who
[2:56] Escape out of this great damnation will
[2:58] be a beautiful Branch before the Lord
[3:01] sometime someday I'll get to it the Lord
[3:03] willing for it for you women
[3:06] all right so
[3:07] right there you see brother Brandon
[3:09] saying that that beautiful branch in our
[3:11] eyes we say well that isn't that Christ
[3:13] Christ is the beautiful Branch but
[3:15] brother Branham is showing us no that
[3:17] that is actually
[3:19] the bride in the last days she'll be
[3:22] glorious the scripture says let's go
[3:24] back to that scripture and I'm going to
[3:25] be referring to this a lot
[3:27] throughout this
[3:29] I want you to see so the first part we
[3:32] see the negative right
[3:35] so this is juxtaposed to each other so
[3:37] on one hand the world the denominations
[3:41] those who've committed adultery against
[3:43] the word this is what the condition will
[3:45] be for them
[3:47] but then in that day in the darkest of
[3:49] day in Satan's Eden in the worst age the
[3:52] most deceiving age the branch of the
[3:54] Lord will be beautiful and glorious and
[3:58] the fruit of the Earth shall be
[4:00] excellent and calmly for them that are
[4:02] escaped of Israel so I want I want to
[4:05] keep this scripture in front of you
[4:07] because as we're going this is what
[4:09] we're talking about you might say you're
[4:12] why are you so focused on the women
[4:13] don't think I'm so focused on the women
[4:15] because
[4:16] what we're talking about is bride
[4:19] so when I'm speaking about women
[4:21] condition of women feminism
[4:24] Satan's attack on the family all these
[4:27] things you think oh this guy doesn't
[4:28] like women no you're missing the point
[4:31] you're not seeing what's happening in
[4:33] society is reflective of what's happened
[4:35] to the church and what what's happening
[4:38] to you sisters is what's reflecting of
[4:41] all of us men and women
[4:43] in the bride right we're all bride it's
[4:46] not like we're Grooms and bride Christ
[4:49] is the only groom every one of us is
[4:51] bride having to submit to our husband
[4:54] right
[4:55] having to
[4:57] dress be dressed modestly be dressed in
[5:00] what he provides for us you see seven
[5:03] women
[5:04] are going to take hold
[5:06] of a man
[5:07] so taking hold means to seize
[5:10] there in other words we want you and
[5:13] we're going to use you for our purpose
[5:16] saying we're going to eat our own bread
[5:17] and we're our own Apparel in other words
[5:19] we're gonna
[5:20] we're gonna have our own jobs and we're
[5:22] gonna we're gonna go out into society
[5:24] and we're going to do exactly what we
[5:26] want to do just
[5:29] we don't want to have a reproach we want
[5:31] to be called by your name now you're
[5:33] thinking about it when I'm talking about
[5:34] this in the natural but let's look at it
[5:37] in the spiritual as we go forward
[5:40] see if I can get past this
[5:48] let you see what God thinks of the woman
[5:49] that really escape this damnation of
[5:52] this day said she would be beautiful
[5:55] I heard a woman the other day laughing
[5:56] at a girl a bunch of half-naked females
[5:58] with morals lower than a mother dog
[6:00] laughing at an old woman with a long
[6:02] dress listen here your little twisted up
[6:04] female she's got something you know
[6:06] nothing about she's got moral you don't
[6:09] even know what the name is you lost it
[6:11] in the Cradle almost you don't even know
[6:13] right from wrong she does
[6:17] she's got something hit in her heart
[6:19] that you don't know nothing about you
[6:21] lost it can never find it don't you call
[6:23] her old-fashioned and so forth you see
[6:25] look at this is what the devil does
[6:28] he'll he'll he'll call you names
[6:31] you're oh you're you're under the thumb
[6:34] of a man you're under the patriarchy and
[6:37] we're supposed to get scared by this
[6:38] terminology you're old-fashioned
[6:41] yeah exactly that's right I'm under the
[6:44] word of God that's where I'm at that's
[6:46] where I want to be
[6:48] but they want to call names and it's
[6:50] supposed to trigger us into fear oh just
[6:53] shut up and sit in the corner no we're
[6:56] gonna speak the truth and live the truth
[6:58] and we're not going to be afraid to be
[7:01] called old-fashioned and part of the
[7:03] patriarchy and blah blah blah
[7:06] says you're uh
[7:09] she's she's got hit in her heart
[7:11] Treasure of decency you don't know one
[7:14] word of it you're mad me brought you up
[7:16] like that your pastor permitted him it
[7:18] shows where he stands I'm a preaching
[7:20] about him right here now see
[7:23] it said seven women will grab one man
[7:25] and said we'll do our own work let's
[7:27] just let us just take your name to take
[7:29] away our approach but he said how
[7:30] glorious will that little branch that
[7:32] escapes all these things that will be
[7:34] Holiness unto the Lord in that day when
[7:37] real genuine born-again women know their
[7:39] place though they be laughed at and
[7:41] called silly and old-fashioned and
[7:42] everything but act like a woman like a
[7:45] lady stand like a woman dress like a
[7:47] woman talk like a woman Live Like a Lady
[7:50] amen
[7:54] the flashing red light of his coming I'm
[7:56] going to have to get this here because
[7:57] my eyes aren't I'm getting old
[8:01] and said uh
[8:04] let's see
[8:06] but they were perverted until they it
[8:09] becomes so common that when we become so
[8:11] common that they lived with the men the
[8:14] natural perversion from the sex cells
[8:16] had changed its position because that
[8:18] women had become so cheap
[8:21] imagine
[8:22] what he's talking about in back in the
[8:24] 50s and 60s
[8:27] a few days ago I was over Tucson went to
[8:30] get a loaf of bread and there was a boy
[8:31] sitting out there and two little boys in
[8:33] the car another came in got a pack of
[8:35] cigarettes
[8:36] the old grade headed gentleman looked
[8:38] down said who is the cigarettes for your
[8:39] mother said no it's for that boy he said
[8:42] is he old enough to have them said yes
[8:44] sir you look back like that and I was
[8:46] standing with a loaf of bread and a
[8:48] quart of milk watching and he went and
[8:49] said all right and he give it to him he
[8:51] looked back at back to me and said I
[8:54] doubt that
[8:56] I said he can't get old enough to do it
[8:58] he ain't old enough at any age
[9:00] he said I'll agree with you said do you
[9:02] have a hard time trying to quit them I
[9:04] said I never did start them
[9:06] said I never did start him said my
[9:07] parents smoked and used tobacco but the
[9:09] Lord God kept me from it he turned and
[9:11] looked at me kind of strange he said
[9:12] well I think it's a rotten shame today
[9:14] to see of how said used to be we put a
[9:17] woman on a pedestal said we honored her
[9:19] we took off our head and her presence we
[9:21] walked down the streets and gentlemen
[9:22] would hear somebody make a remark about
[9:24] a certain woman they'd slap him down see
[9:27] said they honored women but he said sir
[9:29] women has brought it upon themselves
[9:31] said now they don't get up they used to
[9:33] get up in A Streetcar lady get up every
[9:35] man would take his hat off and let her
[9:37] sit down said now it's push crowd said
[9:40] they have brought it on themselves and
[9:41] that's the truth the devil hole of
[9:43] Hollywood Yonder produced it out of on
[9:45] the televisions and magazines till the
[9:48] thing has become a great big pot of
[9:51] Filth that's right
[9:54] all right so let's look at revelation
[9:56] 17.
[9:59] that's what it's become is
[10:02] just the the normal standard of the day
[10:05] what you see on your phone what you see
[10:08] in the media what you see are all around
[10:10] you we look at it and say oh this is
[10:13] just what it is it is propaganda and
[10:16] teaching from the devil treat it that
[10:18] way don't treat it like well this is
[10:20] just what it is because then you take it
[10:21] into your eyes you take it into your
[10:23] spirit and you think that's normal
[10:24] you're normal
[10:27] sisters that live this message that's
[10:30] normal that's right what's out there is
[10:33] a hell cesspot they say well we have
[10:36] freedom we can dress what you want
[10:37] that's not Freedom that's bondage to sin
[10:40] that's bondage to evil tell me today are
[10:44] you more honored
[10:46] treated more honorably you might be made
[10:49] fun of you might be called old-fashioned
[10:50] but when it comes down to it do they
[10:52] treat you with more honor than they do
[10:53] with the sex woman on the street you
[10:56] better believe they do
[10:58] why because it's the spirit that's on
[11:00] you
[11:01] when that spirit's on you you have under
[11:03] his protection under his safety and
[11:06] they might mistreat you they might speak
[11:08] against you but there's a level of honor
[11:10] that they'll never get around
[11:12] because that's how you're conducting
[11:13] yourself
[11:14] that's exactly what the prophet is that
[11:17] man was saying to brother Brandon is a
[11:18] woman stopped behaving herself with
[11:21] honor and respect she took the
[11:23] protection off that's what happened she
[11:26] took her protection off she cut out cut
[11:29] her hair put on pants put on makeup and
[11:32] what's the result
[11:33] that protection leaves now what's there
[11:36] man just treats a woman like a brute
[11:39] and looks at her like uh just a
[11:44] object of lust
[11:48] now that's his problem but it's the
[11:50] woman's problem too she's presented
[11:52] herself that way she needs to not do
[11:54] that and the man needs not to look like
[11:55] that look that way
[11:58] Revelation 17 1-3 and there came one of
[12:01] the Seven Angels which had the seven
[12:02] vials and talked with me singing to
[12:04] become hither I will show unto thee the
[12:06] Judgment of the great that sitteth
[12:08] upon many Waters with whom the kings of
[12:11] the Earth have committed fornication and
[12:13] the inhabitants of the Earth have been
[12:15] made drunk with the wine of her
[12:17] fornication so he carried me away in the
[12:19] spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a
[12:22] woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast
[12:25] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[12:28] heads and ten horns we understand
[12:30] anytime in the Bible it speaks of a
[12:33] prostitute you're either looking at
[12:34] Israel who is committed
[12:39] idolatry against God as blasphemed God
[12:43] turned against God so God pictures her
[12:46] as an Unfaithful woman he does that in
[12:49] the Old Testament in the New Testament
[12:51] we see and you read in second
[12:53] Corinthians 11 that Paul's fear was that
[12:56] they would receive another word another
[12:57] gospel in another Jesus and he Likens on
[13:01] that unto he said I have
[13:03] engaged you to Christ as a Chase virgin
[13:06] but I'm afraid you'll receive another
[13:08] Jesus another Spirit another gospel thus
[13:11] committing adultery and becoming a
[13:13] that's exactly what had happened to the
[13:16] church not only that but it's gone so
[13:18] far as not only she's has she accepted
[13:20] the protection of politics but now she's
[13:24] in in this picture she's sitting upon
[13:26] politics and controlling politics
[13:31] and she's drunk
[13:33] she's drunk with the wine of her
[13:35] fornication and the kings of the Earth
[13:37] have also committed fornication with her
[13:39] and the woman was arrayed in purple and
[13:42] scarlet color how anybody cannot see
[13:44] that this is the Roman Catholic Church
[13:46] they're completely blind what are the
[13:48] colors of the Roman Catholic Church
[13:50] purple and Scarlet
[13:53] and what what is she decked with every
[13:55] church and every altar is decked with
[13:58] gold and precious stones and Pearls
[14:00] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[14:02] Abominations and filthiness of her
[14:05] fornication just imagine she's got a
[14:07] golden cup with the blood
[14:09] of the martyrs in that cup and she's
[14:13] drinking it and she's drinking it with
[14:15] the kings of the earth that's how that's
[14:17] how far this woman has fallen and upon
[14:20] her head was a name written mystery
[14:22] Babylon the great the mother of harlots
[14:25] and Abominations of the Earth this woman
[14:27] by her own works and deeds has clothed
[14:31] herself right she's clothed herself in
[14:34] purple and Scarlet that's her own Deeds
[14:37] her own Works she has taken that upon
[14:39] herself and done that for herself now do
[14:42] you are you don't forget the scripture
[14:45] we LED with Isaiah chapter 4.
[14:49] she's clothed herself
[14:52] but there's another one
[14:54] they didn't clothe theirself
[14:56] and I heard as it were the works of a
[14:58] great multitude and as the voice of
[15:00] Benny Waters and the voice of Mighty
[15:02] thundering saying Alleluia for the Lord
[15:03] God omnipotent let us be glad and
[15:06] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[15:08] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[15:09] wife has made herself ready and to her
[15:12] was granted
[15:14] so it was given to her it was a gift
[15:17] of Grace that she should be to raid in
[15:20] fine linen clean and white for the fine
[15:22] linen is the righteousness of the Saints
[15:25] this is the righteousness of the Saints
[15:27] what is our righteousness
[15:29] not our own
[15:31] it's his righteousness and we're clothed
[15:34] in it so our husband
[15:36] gives us fine linen clean and white to
[15:39] be clothed in and that's the expression
[15:42] of our character right
[15:44] our character doesn't come from ourself
[15:45] our character comes from him living in
[15:49] us and that's the very thing that we're
[15:52] clothed with is what he grants to us so
[15:55] one woman she closes herself closes
[15:56] herself in purple and Scarlet
[15:59] she's decked with all kinds of gold and
[16:01] jewels and here we have the true wife of
[16:04] the Lamb she is granted she's given
[16:08] this garment and it's made of fine linen
[16:12] clean and white you see that what it
[16:16] says in Isaiah chapter 4 in that day
[16:19] seven women shall take hold of one man
[16:22] saying we will eat our own bread what
[16:25] does it mean
[16:26] you're thinking of literal women
[16:29] this is denominations this is the Roman
[16:32] Catholic church we will eat our own
[16:34] bread what's bread
[16:35] The Word of Life the word we will eat
[16:38] our own bread we're gonna we're gonna
[16:39] create our own word we're going to take
[16:42] our own word and we're gonna we're gonna
[16:45] eat that word that's the word we don't
[16:47] want the word of Christ that's
[16:49] Vindicated for the the hour that we live
[16:51] in no we want our own bread
[16:54] we want to we're gonna we're gonna
[16:56] provide our bread for ourself
[16:59] and we're going to take what does it say
[17:01] we'll wear our own apparel right she
[17:05] refused the apparel that Christ was
[17:07] offering she refused the bread that
[17:11] Christ was offering notice what she says
[17:13] next only let us be called by Thy Name
[17:16] Church of Christ
[17:20] they want to be called by the name of
[17:22] Jesus Christ but they don't want his
[17:25] bread
[17:26] and they don't want his garments
[17:28] they want their own garments their own
[17:30] word
[17:31] their own righteousness and not that
[17:34] which Christ is offering to them but
[17:36] notice
[17:38] in that day there's a branch from the
[17:40] Lord
[17:41] and what is that Branch it's beautiful
[17:43] and glorious
[17:45] the fine linen is what the righteousness
[17:47] of saints
[17:50] right and the fruit of the Earth shall
[17:52] be excellent and comely for them that
[17:54] are escaped of Israel so what is it
[17:57] speaking of there isn't there is a great
[17:59] hour of deception and there's going to
[18:01] be a people that escape
[18:03] there's going to be a people escape from
[18:05] that deception and what is it going to
[18:07] be the fruit of the earth well they're
[18:09] going to have really nice farms in their
[18:10] backyard right no what is it speaking of
[18:14] the fruit of her life
[18:16] the the kind of Life the character that
[18:18] she produces before will be calmly
[18:23] it'll be comely so in other words she
[18:25] she is she has the beauty the true
[18:28] beauty right what is true beauty
[18:32] brother Branham tells us in marriage and
[18:33] divorce that Christ was not featured in
[18:36] outward Beauty there's no beauty that we
[18:39] should desire him but what was it it was
[18:42] the beauty of character and what does he
[18:44] tell us in choosing of a bride when
[18:46] you're choosing your wife young men you
[18:49] don't go for outward Beauty you look for
[18:51] character
[18:53] that's what you're looking for that's
[18:54] what your should be Desiring so that's
[18:57] what Christ is going after that's what
[18:58] Christ is looking at
[19:00] who will receive my garments
[19:04] who will receive the bread that I have
[19:07] to offer you might say I want to be
[19:09] called by your name Christ
[19:11] you don't just get called by his name by
[19:13] your own efforts and your own desire if
[19:16] you take your own bread and your own
[19:17] clothes what is it it's filthy
[19:21] it's filthy in his sight he doesn't
[19:23] accept that and he's not going to place
[19:26] his name on someone who takes their own
[19:29] bread and their own garments he puts on
[19:32] one that we surrender everything that we
[19:34] have and that we could produce and take
[19:36] what he grants to us amen and that's
[19:40] what that that's what the message has
[19:41] been given to us in this day is to
[19:43] clothe Us in the word we're Washed by
[19:47] the washing of Water by the word so that
[19:50] our garments are without spot and
[19:51] wrinkle or any such thing
[19:54] husbands Ephesians 5 25-27 husbands love
[19:58] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[20:01] church and gave himself for it that he
[20:03] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[20:06] washing of Water by the word that he
[20:08] might present it to himself a glorious
[20:10] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[20:13] such thing but that should be holy and
[20:15] without blemish
[20:19] so husbands are to love their wives
[20:22] that's what Christ does Christ provides
[20:25] for what we have need of that's what
[20:28] this whole thing is saying he will he he
[20:30] offers his very body his very life all
[20:33] that he is for the protection of and for
[20:36] the provision for his bride
[20:39] that he might present his bride to
[20:42] himself the way she's supposed to be
[20:44] presented
[20:45] it's him doing that work providing for
[20:49] her
[20:50] and her saying amen I receive what you
[20:54] have I I accept what you have
[20:58] Genesis 2 24.
[21:01] therefore shall a man leave his father
[21:04] and mother and shall cleave unto his
[21:08] wife and they shall be one flesh so
[21:12] that's what he's that's what he's
[21:13] calling us to in this day is calling us
[21:15] to be one flesh Christ has descended
[21:18] from heaven with a message and what is
[21:21] that message to produce a bride that's
[21:23] in an invisible Union
[21:25] with him
[21:27] but what what does the church do say
[21:29] where where is he I don't see him
[21:31] anywhere
[21:32] where is the promise of his coming
[21:35] everything's the same since the fathers
[21:37] fell asleep see they don't they don't
[21:39] see it they don't recognize that he's
[21:42] come to cleave to his wife
[21:44] right and what's the response of the
[21:47] wife yes I submit I submit to what you
[21:51] have for me
[21:52] I honor you I respect you
[21:56] Genesis 3 16 under the woman he said I
[22:00] will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[22:03] conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring
[22:05] forth children and thy desire shall be
[22:09] to thy husband and he shall rule over
[22:12] thee so you see God in his original
[22:14] creation he made man and woman equal
[22:17] right
[22:20] he made them equal but he made them
[22:22] different
[22:23] didn't make them the same when we read I
[22:26] can't remember if it's the next
[22:27] scripture I have up
[22:28] yeah
[22:30] but I suffer not a woman to teach nor
[22:32] you serve authority over the man but to
[22:34] be in silence for Adam was first form
[22:36] then Eve and Adam was not deceived but
[22:38] the woman being deceived was in the
[22:41] transgression so you notice that it
[22:43] isn't a result of the curse
[22:46] that man the husband is the head of the
[22:49] wife
[22:50] that's not the curse that's God's
[22:52] original design
[22:54] why why why do I say that is because
[22:57] when Paul is arguing that women
[22:59] shouldn't be a preacher and take
[23:01] authority over the church and over the
[23:02] man he's going back to the original
[23:05] creation
[23:06] he says Adam was first formed proving
[23:09] that Adam is to be the leader the
[23:11] preacher right he's he's to lead
[23:15] let me go back to this verse so it's not
[23:18] that but what it what is this speaking
[23:20] of he shall rule over thee you say well
[23:23] that was that's showing it was a change
[23:25] we were to be equal and he wasn't going
[23:27] to rule over here this word ruling is
[23:29] different than leading than headship
[23:31] it's not the same thing ruling here
[23:34] speaks of uh leading with rigor we would
[23:38] call it a dictatorship
[23:40] he shall have dictatorship over thee
[23:44] that is part of the curse right now the
[23:48] man is going to be dictator over the
[23:50] woman and we see that in in societies
[23:53] through history the woman is merely
[23:55] property
[23:56] her her voice is has no value uh she she
[24:02] is just there for producing babies that
[24:04] was the picture and she's you can just
[24:07] discard her anytime you want to she has
[24:09] no rights nothing that that was all of
[24:12] history but what is what does Christ
[24:15] come and do we'll we'll get into this
[24:16] probably in the next time I do Sunday
[24:19] school but what does Christ do in in a
[24:22] day when a woman couldn't even be a
[24:24] witness in a court of law as soon as a
[24:26] man rose up and said a word
[24:29] he
[24:30] it was done
[24:32] the woman's word was invalidated Christ
[24:35] rises from the dead and who's the first
[24:36] person that he meets
[24:39] a woman
[24:40] and guess what guess what the disciples
[24:42] did when the woman came and said oh I
[24:45] saw Christ she's emotional
[24:48] they they dismissed it they didn't
[24:50] believe it just like the rest of society
[24:52] but that didn't bother the Lord Jesus he
[24:55] was going to show them the value of the
[24:57] woman he had he even had following along
[24:59] him with him women
[25:02] that he wanted to listen to his message
[25:06] you say what's the big deal in that a
[25:08] lot a big huge deal because if you read
[25:10] Jewish literature of the time women
[25:13] didn't even need to know the law they
[25:16] need to knew the rules about kosher
[25:17] outside of that don't let her in the
[25:20] synagogue don't teach her anything just
[25:22] she should dress like this she should
[25:24] cook like this outside of that she needs
[25:27] to know nothing Christ is there and what
[25:30] is between Mary and Martha they're
[25:32] having a disagreement one of them is
[25:34] serving the other one is not serving
[25:36] serving is listening to the word Jesus
[25:38] said the one that's listening to the
[25:39] word is chosen the best thing
[25:41] right he's not validating what society
[25:44] and what everybody else was doing he's
[25:46] saying women need to sit and listen to
[25:49] the word as just as much as men need to
[25:51] sit and listen to the word
[25:53] see it's see you have to understand the
[25:56] gospel is coming to to restore the right
[26:00] relationships in families and in homes
[26:04] they didn't have it right
[26:06] they didn't have it right in the Old
[26:08] Testament most of society didn't have it
[26:11] right
[26:12] the gospel comes to make those things
[26:14] right
[26:15] but here we have again she's sorrow and
[26:18] conception is Multiplied and sorrow you
[26:20] shall bring forth children which of
[26:21] course is makes perfect sense since she
[26:23] ate an apple
[26:24] um
[26:27] no she committed adultery and so God was
[26:30] cursing the very thing that was used in
[26:33] that adultery and the process that was
[26:35] there uh produ from the that the
[26:39] adultery
[26:40] but her desire will be to your husband
[26:42] well why would he say that because her
[26:44] desire went away from her husband
[26:46] right and he shall rule over thee so the
[26:48] the relationship is this is the curse
[26:52] you say oh no this is just how the
[26:54] relationships are supposed to be is it
[26:56] not the curse
[26:59] it is the curse just as much as thorns
[27:02] and thistles are the curse for the man
[27:05] right
[27:07] um
[27:11] I I found this fascinating therefore
[27:14] Sarah laughed within herself saying
[27:16] after I am waxed old shall I have
[27:18] pleasure my Lord being old also so I
[27:22] think that's from the I'm I'm referring
[27:25] to that because in the New Testament it
[27:27] tell it encourages women to call their
[27:29] husbands Lord so sisters call your
[27:32] husband lord well we have we have a
[27:34] strange we have our society is very
[27:37] strange in that uh this is a different
[27:41] word so this is an Adonai that's the
[27:44] word we use for God in Hebrew this is
[27:46] adoni
[27:48] and so we think well man that's like
[27:50] really how how can I do that it
[27:53] literally would translate to sir
[27:56] if if you looked at it so it's it's it's
[27:59] and the reason why I realized this was I
[28:03] was in the airport in Tel Aviv
[28:07] and a man just walked right past me and
[28:10] was walking past everybody in the line
[28:12] and a woman yelled out at an e and I was
[28:16] like
[28:18] huh why is she calling him Lord
[28:21] so I looked at brother Colin who was
[28:24] with me and he said oh that's just like
[28:26] saying sir it's the same same thing in
[28:29] in English huh so in other words it's
[28:32] just simply saying speak to your husband
[28:34] with respect you don't have to call him
[28:36] Lord I'm not that's not what I'm saying
[28:39] it's telling you be respectful be be be
[28:42] be reverent even the Bible says to your
[28:45] husband
[28:49] uh
[28:51] uh we got like one minute left so I'm
[28:54] just gonna stop there and we'll pick up
[28:57] so let's stand
[29:00] it's amazing to me you begin to talk
[29:02] about this and it's incredible how the
[29:05] spirit of this
