========================================

[Applause] there's a pair of glasses sure that someone is lost has been found in the church if anybody if they belong to you or you're on the platform on this pulpit now i know that many are working and they have to go home early and so i won't speak very long and then have a prayer line to pray for the sick that gives me an opportunity to to catch up and some of the emergencies have just been in the room protection just now for coming in and this afternoon some of them of course very very bad and violent i've been making the calls and praying for the sick seeing the hand of our lord jesus heal the sick and the afflicted that's how wonderful he is now not too often that we get into these healing services because usually we the holy spirit will come around he's in the emergency case and desert it right quick and pick it out and say something about it then the rest of them we just maybe it's nothing too bad so we just pass it on by i thought being here twice today it should be that we dedicate one service for a prayer for the sake i believe in healing the sick i believe it is the bible command we cannot preach that without the full gospel without including that now it's possible i don't know yet i haven't called home yet tonight it may be possible that next sunday i'd be through here again and if you if you don't hear from us this week if billy don't let you know he'll know a little later on in the week if you don't hear then we'll be here again next sunday because that gives you a labor day you see to rest up and uh so to get home and so we'll try the lord willing now if you don't hear i think billy drops your card or tells you to do this service to some way so if he doesn't call you then i'm coming back for for us just next to come and send me if brother never just saw it one of them blessed some lady something oh that's fine if anybody wants to know this little collins here and during the time of the seven seals the doctor had told that little boy was rheumatic fever that he had to lay on his back and drink to a tube that's that was it and the father and mother brought in the home and set him in the room prayed for him and the lord jesus healing so completely he went back to school and the authorities called them in about so they called a specialist who was waiting on him and she couldn't believe he couldn't believe such a thing as that and they brought the boy down for a test and he was perfectly normally played then jesus came you know strange thing i was going to ask someone to sing that song tonight as i was ministering in the room there here comes someone saying it out there then jesus came if that wasn't saying i was going to ask someone to sing it before i i spoke tonight so he works all things right now many of you will be waiting over to in the mornings it's got a long distance to go and i i appreciate that effort some of you will drive home tonight cause you got to go to work but daylight in the morning and i i know it's hard and then when i think and see that i get spells too you know i get moody i get to the spot to where i what gets me is where i get to those spells when i get all overworked and satan comes tell me why nobody cares for you you really haven't got a friend in the world see and so remember i'm not amused from temptation i got to overcome that then when i look back and see something like this i put it right back in his face and say what about that that helps me to overcome what about that like a certain friend of mine sitting in the meeting here there was a a clan kind of uh a clan that doesn't believe in divine healing come to this young fellow uh recently and said to him that stuff is there preaching here about that divine healing there's nothing to it and this man lives in kentucky right near an old woman that when was it acting campground that was dying with cancer and her sister came to the meeting that night with a handkerchief in her purse that she'd taken and uh the holy spirit called out the woman back there and i've never been in that country before and told her that she had a handshake in her purse that she had there she took them home and her sister was up on a certain ridge there dying with cancer of the stomach the doctors give her up and i say go put the handkerchief upon the woman for thus saith the lord she shall live and that's the night the neighbors that they thought they had the salvation army when brother ben got up there and then that lady was so perfectly healed until she does her own work and the neighbors were so this young man knowing that he said then explain her case explained you know she had cancer she's hearing low when the doctors to perform the operation and just simply turn sort of put her back and nothing can be done and now she's perfectly normal well said explain that that's settled you know what the bible says and they could say nothing a myth because the man was standing right in their midst that's where we it puts satan to the shame does it the man was standing there as the miracle was performed on amen does god raise the dead here's the man in my ear raised by them amen god heal the sick oh my the hands could just go everywhere god heals the state and we know he's the great the great i am not the great i was or will be i am i am at every present everywhere all time the same yesterday today and forever now i hurry let's turn now into the blessed bible i want to read a passage that that used to just turn me around when i read it and i want to have a prayer line and i pray for everybody that wants to be prayed for and now we're going to turn to mark saint mark's 11th chapter of saint martin and we're going to begin to read about the the 22nd verse of the 11th chapter of saint mark and many of you know this scripture it's very familiar it was a scripture i was thinking on uh brother russell when those when he spoke to me and said about those squirrels and they that was just the very scripture i was thinking of it's always been a puzzle he said if ye say not if i say if you say now let us read jesus answering said unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those saints which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith and therefore i say unto you what things so every you desire when you pray believe that ye receive them and you shall have them and when you stand please forgive if you have ought against any that your father also that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespass but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses now faith is based on forgiveness now and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us that's what we all hunger and it's just laying right at the door yeah we see it but we want to see more of it we wanted such a flow that it'll it'll be a help to us flow out to others remember jesus as we had in the lesson this morning he never used his power for himself he used it for others that's what it was set for and you think sometimes why would a man that was so full of power like him would have ever be sick yes sir i've read and some books somewhere where when he raised up that boy for the widow's son from nahum of lisa prince the house of david that he stepped on a rock and grown with a headache he bore our infirmities bear means to pack them he bore and he had all things and like we have he had sickness he had temptations he had trouble he had flusteration just as we have because he had to be the right kind of a mediator so he had to be partakers the husband and of the fruit before you even know the woman has to well and many things see if we look right into the scripture i want to say that i believe every scripture never been up to this room there's critics today that don't want to believe that a critic once said that when jesus said there was disciples to where that colt was tied were two ways met that he pre-arranged that for where that quote was time see they don't understand that god rearranges god told me other day was brother down here and i would shake his hand on the street again that's very strange i wasn't here that morning but two minutes longer or a minute longer i'd not met him on the street but i stepped off the car just in time to shake his hands when he was coming in on the street he didn't know he had his glasses off he couldn't see me when he heard my voice he started crying what was it usually he doesn't do that but it was the answer to what was told him up there under the oxygen tank he would do it i said you were also set in the church again his heart's desire was having chicago meeting he wanted to come to that meeting his heart was part i sent him a telegram and greetings for us and the children told him was praying that he could get well right quick and a loving brother who visits him said that you he just wanted to come so bad but here he says tonight see that was not pre-arranged the same god arranged it he makes everything work perfectly on the doll amen a critic once said that no wonder jesus could take five loaves and feed five thousand said the loaves were bigger in that day and he just cut each soap to feed a thousand i'll give you to understand a little boy had it in his lunch [Applause] a little child of five bowls of bread that could feed five ounces then what about the twelve basketballs taking that fast oh they just that's just critics that's all that doesn't change god's word it's just the same thing moves on now we want to speak now upon faith and a different type of faith perfect faith that's a great thing now a faith we're told in the bible faith cometh by hearing now you cannot be saved without faith and faith is something that you have to believe is there that really nothing else will declare but faith now i'm trying to bring faith to you so that you can be ready for this prayer line in the next few minutes now faith he that cometh to god must believe that he is and it's impossible to to please god without faith you cannot please and if you say you believe god you have never seen him see so then you've got to believe it by faith and if you could see him it would be no more faith the anything that the census declares is no more faith it's a scientific fact see it's not no more faith but you have to accept him by faith and he that cometh to god must believe god and faith comes by hearing the word of god amen see you must first believe this is god's word and you must come to god by the word amen see just take the word what it says and that's right everything else contrary to it is not right abraham had to believe just what that boss told him and when he was 100 years old 25 years later he was stronger believe that he was 25 years ago when it was given to him he believed it and he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong giving praise to god knowing that he was able to perform what he promised that's where everyone must be that way you must come with an unfailing faith believing that god made the promise but now you have to be in a position to have that faith that's what we're going to talk about to receive that faith in hebrews the book of hebrews 11th chapter we are told that faith is the substance of things so far now here's where many people fail to receive their healing or what they're asking for because they take faith to be something that it is not see they don't believe it it's not a imagination it is a actual substance now listen closely it is not what you imagine it's just as real to you as any sense of your body will declare anything else it's just as real as my eyes says this is a piece of paper it's just as real as to say that but that is a lie it's just as real as the that i feel my coat it's just as real as the as i hear that baby talking uh there or making this noise see it's just that real it's music playing it's just as real as i taste anything in my mouth it is that real only you can't show it to somebody else you have alone amen it's yours faith is the substance amen see it's not just a myth so many people call now these are real deep lessons and i'll catch the top of it and then you dig down in it notice it is something that you possess ah not imagination you really have it it's just as real to you as any other thing that could be it's just as real as as you know that you're right in your automobile it's just as real as you know that you're sitting in the church it's just as real as you hear my boy it is a substance not an imagination not an emotion but something that you have and it comes to you by hearing the word of god in that only amen faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god that puts it back don't worry your faith in is not in some individual it's not in a man it's not in our organization it's not in a group of people it's in god because god is the word amen your faith is in god faith cometh by hearing the word of god then when god by his word not what somebody else did somebody else did but by what god's word said he said let every man's words be a lie and mine be truth now you see somebody else do something by a word act of god or promise of god and many of them say i can do that too it's an imagination and when they do you find them rigged up out there somewhere yes it's got to be a substance now that is potentially a faith that is something that would bring you to a faith it's potentially like if you ask me for an oak tree and i'll give you an acorn potentially you have an oak tree but it hasn't produced itself yet but when it really brings itself out it is an oak tree and when you imagine that god does this but when it's revealed to you it's a faith stand a perfect faith that cannot fail that's the reason those visions are so so tremendous to me because it's been proved right every time see and i know that he promised that and he promised in his word and here he comes and promises for this day therefore you know where you're standing when he says so that gives me a faith because he never does nothing contrary to his written word see if it was contrary to the word i couldn't have faith in it brings it right back again to the word see faith in hearing the word of god you must share the word god's word is that all sufficient word that's all you have need of is this word now faith being deception and in there we find out in hebrews what faith was and what those did you have faith see there's many times that people have faith today and tomorrow they haven't got it the next day there's something and something else but when god wants anchors and you see it there's nothing ever going to make you move from it you're just poking reaching pursuing and pursue this adventure without authority you're just trying this and trying this and go to this and run here and run there you haven't got the faith yet but when that is what we call things excuse me i want you to thank you i i want you to get this now we the church has got to lift itself in the power of god how we're too close to the end now and to the end now and i believe the church is in condition where we can teach it a little deeper things and rub some of this make-believe out and get into something real see it's got to be something that you know if you say uh uh brother branham uh that isn't a lie yet i'll annoy the light how do you know it's like i'm looking at it well how do you know what you could be wrong my side has always declared to me that that was life and that's the reason i believe those visions because it's always declared to me the truth because it comes from the word amen then if he says it that settles it now when it's declared like that there's no more guesswork it's going to be then you hear it thus faith the law see because it's beyond human thinking it's up into the realms of the large things but you're standing here just as the vine just as the branch producing the fruit that's in the vine see god uses man and man only god doesn't use machinery god doesn't use groups of man god doesn't use organization god uses individuals always now faith is the substance and by we understand all those things are done it's not a it's not a imagination it is a substance especially perfect faith that's what i'm talking on tonight getting to perfect faith it is not an imagination now other just people can say well i got all faith oh i sure have or are you standing here for us see your your very actions prove that you haven't got what you're talking about see if you have faith then where you standing for airlines what do you do these things for see if you had perfect faith you'd look right straight to god and believe it and walk away and you would you would have no need of coming into a prayer you'd have no need of these things because your faith has done made it so ever see what would be the use for me saying i got to put a shirt on i got a shirt on how do you know you got a shirt well i see it feel it and i know it's there well that's just how real that when perfect faith takes the hope you don't need no more great already done you know hallelujah how do you know it faith tells me so amen that's it see do you get it now one of these that's perfect faith not otherwise i'm venturing out well i'll go the bible stick all the elders let them know they want to pray over i know how i'm going and you say well i'm going to be healed you're making yourself if don't watch how you're going to make yourself just it's worked out then when he passed you you say oh i still don't see there he was you didn't have faith your genuine faith would do it right there your your genuine faith will make it so surreal to you that look at that little woman with a blood issue she said if i can only touch the border of his garment i'll be made well and as soon as she did it she said she felt within herself that her blood issues stopped and she actually believed it and when she touched it the fruit that it stopped it stopped jesus turned and said who touched me that's perfect faith and that same perfect faith tonight will touch jesus christ just as it did then a woman come with a perfect faith for that time now now we see at first the disciples didn't have this perfect faith they didn't have it because they had christ walking with him but then afterwards christ was in that amen and so you see it's hard then to have this perfect faith without the holy spirit it has to bring it it does now you say the disciples didn't have perfect faith no or they had an epileptic child there that they were trying to cast this devil out and they couldn't do it and the father seen jesus coming and he said we have brought my son to to your disciples and they could not cure him and afterwards the disciples asked jesus saying why could not we cure him and jesus says because of a lack of faith and of your unbelief that's right because of your unbelief that's i remember they had this house jesus had given them power the healer was sick to raise the dead and cast out devils just a few days before that yeah they had the power but not the faith to use the power there's the brandon tabernacle there's a church the bride today the holy spirit is here with the power amen but you haven't got that faith amen see what i mean it takes faith to move it here i got a shell that i hand loaded i know what it'll do by ballistics like the word but i've got to fire the gun the fire has to get to the power the power's got the power of it's got to have the fire to light it off and the same thing that powers in the shells but it needs bait to charge it that's what it takes the perfect faith to ignite the power of the holy spirit which we have now since he's come upon us amen faith to ignite to see great things is to the faith something that presents it to you for the heart full of joy you walk into the stick room knowing exactly what you're going to say walk in there i know what's going to happen something's already been revealed and you know it when you walk in in the name of jesus christ rise up from there say up the law there you are that's perfect faith if there'd be 10 million people said they're saying it wouldn't happen you know what's going to happen anyhow because you know it it's going to happen regardless what anybody else says you're the ones got the faith could you imagine joshua he called the elders of israel together and said uh brethren we are the servants of the lord i would like for you to say uh ask the lord if it'd be all right if uh if he give us a little more sunlight see and hold the son of the one no he had need of it and without prayer without anything he had need of it and he just commanded the son he said stand there amen i have need and i'm in the service of the lord and he sent me over here to do this job and i'm doing the best i don't know how and the enemy is routed and they're out in here if i let the sun go down they'll get together and cause me more trouble so stand still you hang there hey man for 24 hours [Applause] now if the world's turning it holds it up and the sun stays in the place and it don't run what happened then that's right now you make yourself a infidel if you say this and then if you don't you shouldn't full of science because they said the world stop and drop so now what if you say god's word is not right then you're an infidel yeah but it happened that's the main game i don't know the mechanics of it but it happened i don't know the mechanics of the holy ghost but i know it fell on me i can't tell the mechanics of it but i know the blessings of it that's that's all i i don't know about is the blessing of the holy ghost and mechanics keyword semester is secret this boy cannot be healed because the disciples had power jesus gave them power to heal all manner of sickness to cast out devils to cleanse the efforts and to raise the dead he gave that power but they didn't have faith to operate the power that they had and then they questioned jesus and said well now why couldn't we do it now remember they had the word and the word was flesh then and the word told them i give you power heaven amen i give you power and they had the power but they didn't have faith to operate the word that was in that amen see what i mean yeah but jesus had it he was the word and he had faith that what he said would happen and man he said oh bring him here how long will he suffer he has faith with his power how did he he said i can do nothing in myself wow he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word and he had faith in god who made him the word he was god the word and it was in him and that giving faith because he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scripture had said he was this and here the scripture is hiding to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was therefore he relied upon what god had made him amen and if he did that then can't we rely on what god made us as believers these signs shall follow in that belief [Music] he had faith and what he was and if you are a believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer and if you've got faith in god the bible says over here if our uh if our hearts condemn us then we can have faith but if our hearts don't condemn us then we have faith we have confidence towards god if you want to read that found saint john 3 21. i got the scripture written down here amen then i mean first john 3 21. uh notice if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence towards god but as long as you're doing things that's wrong you can't have confidence towards god so you see you can you automatically know that you're wrong you automatically touch yourself like you're a sinner by knowing that you're wrong but when your heart don't condemn you and you know you are a believer and there's nothing between you and god you can ask what you will and know that it will be given amen because it's the word that's given to you just like it was to those disciples now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you and have faith in what the word says you are and jesus has faith in the word of god that says what he was it is written on thee didn't david and the psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him [Music] you
