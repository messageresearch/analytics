[39:53] by text and then in person uh about the
[39:56] status of camp in regards to the
[39:58] hurricane um that came through and that
[40:01] area was severely uh affected and so uh
[40:05] I just want to say a couple things first
[40:07] off and that is is that just so that
[40:09] there's an understanding we are under a
[40:12] contract with a deposit for the camp and
[40:15] so we don't have a we don't have an
[40:17] option just to arbitrarily say let's
[40:19] just move Camp you know some has said
[40:22] maybe it's just a better idea with all
[40:23] the uncertainty there to do that we
[40:25] really don't have that option so so as
[40:27] long as Carolina Point can have Camp
[40:29] they are expecting us to have Camp um
[40:32] and as we finally did make communication
[40:34] and and have a conversation with the
[40:36] camp director there at Carolina point
[40:38] and thankfully uh their Grounds was
[40:41] really for the most part spared from a
[40:44] lot of the damage in that area and so
[40:47] they had other young life camps that
[40:49] were uh damaged greatly Carolina point
[40:52] just suffered a couple trees I think a
[40:53] tree on the office but they are in their
[40:56] words Camp is ready the only uncertainty
[41:01] still they've already verified the roads
[41:02] from Bard Bard actually got power last
[41:05] Monday um and so they've had power for a
[41:08] week now Carolina Point does not have
[41:10] power so without power we don't have
[41:13] camp and so they are expecting you know
[41:17] that as as much as you could count on
[41:20] that as their expectation that they'll
[41:22] have power uh the beginning of this week
[41:24] or somewhere in this week so really
[41:27] D-Day for us would
[41:29] be probably Saturday uh next Saturday if
[41:33] they don't have power by next Saturday
[41:36] we will have to make a determination at
[41:37] that time on what to do uh and that
[41:40] would mean that camp would be postponed
[41:42] until their next available date we don't
[41:45] have all the answers because there's so
[41:47] much uncertainty still there's another
[41:49] storm brewing right now supposed to hit
[41:53] um over Florida on Wednesday at about
[41:55] 700 p.m. or 7: a.m. I forget and so
[41:58] there's a lot of uncertainty and so
[41:59] these kind of things are challenging um
[42:02] we just can't don't have all the answers
[42:04] and we really can't so it's quite a
[42:05] dynamic situation we do need to pray
[42:08] that if it's God's will for us to have
[42:10] Camp the Lord can restore the power the
[42:14] Carolina Point we've got a lot of kids
[42:16] there's been already a lot of
[42:17] preparation that's went into it and
[42:18] there's a lot of expectation to have it
[42:21] and so um that's
[42:25] uh us that ready but they do need power
[42:28] so they're ready minus power so power
[42:30] comes they're good to go um they have
[42:33] internet already and the the kitchen his
[42:35] own generators um and so we are I just
[42:39] want to say before I bring brother Jason
[42:41] up uh we are in desperate need it's
[42:44] urgent need for help at Youth Camp this
[42:47] year we have a lot of things that we
[42:49] don't have help for uh a lot of a lot of
[42:52] uh let me just say that we have a lot of
[42:54] help but not a lot from our church last
[42:57] year our church really uh helped quite a
[43:00] bit so if it's if if it's possible and
[43:03] if the Lord would put upon your heart to
[43:04] help in some capacity at Youth Camp I
[43:08] think we need shuttle drivers still um
[43:10] AV Jason will go brother Jason will go
[43:12] over some of that here in a second so
[43:14] there is a need for volunteers and help
[43:16] at Camp um and so uh we need assistance
[43:20] you know this is our youth camp this is
[43:22] bethl Youth Camp so our church should be
[43:24] well represented and if there's any way
[43:26] for you you to go and be a help of some
[43:29] kind I just ask that you'd consider that
[43:31] see if the Lord would make a way for you
[43:32] to be able to help out we do need it
[43:34] next Sunday as I said is the day that
[43:36] we'll load up the truck and then the
[43:38] following Monday after Camp is when we
[43:41] will unload and all those times will be
[43:42] announced so God bless you brother Jason
[43:45] come on
[43:48] up amen God bless you so just uh wanted
[43:52] to go over some specific details and
[43:56] also specifically request your help um I
[44:00] think those who have committed to
[44:02] helping for with Camp already have let
[44:06] us know um when they'll be arriving
[44:09] we're just trying to manage all the
[44:11] logistics of that if you haven't let me
[44:13] know when you're planning on arri
[44:14] arriving yet and you're going to be
[44:16] helping please do let me know there's
[44:18] just a few that haven't I think um next
[44:22] Sunday um after after we have lunch
[44:25] we're going to have we're going to a
[44:27] U-Haul here and we're going to do kind
[44:29] of a tear down and we're going to be
[44:33] packing up that U-Haul so um if you are
[44:38] able to we would love to have
[44:40] everybody's help next Sunday the more
[44:43] people that help the faster it will go
[44:46] and the people who are um currently are
[44:49] AV people I just would say make a
[44:52] request uh if if some of you could stay
[44:57] next week after church and assist us
[44:59] with some of the tear down of course the
[45:00] musicians are going to have some of that
[45:03] responsibility as well so just reminding
[45:05] the musicians next week we need you for
[45:08] tear
[45:08] down but where're brother John
[45:10] especially you
[45:13] um
[45:15] um we we need all hands on deck brother
[45:18] George will not be able to be here next
[45:20] Sunday which is uh uh
[45:23] uh a big hit to us so if a few of the AV
[45:27] people can replace brother George that
[45:29] would be amazing um so that's again
[45:32] that's next Sunday that we'll be doing
[45:35] that after we have lunch so the other
[45:37] part of it is just to make everybody
[45:39] body aware there's obviously unloading
[45:42] that has to happen so a number of us are
[45:45] getting up there on Wednesday um before
[45:48] camp and we'll be starting the uploading
[45:51] un unloading so U brother Aaron will be
[45:54] driving the U-Haul up for us so he'll be
[45:56] there and a few of other of
[45:58] us if you want to come up and can change
[46:01] your plans or make your plans to be able
[46:03] to come up on Wednesday to be able to
[46:05] help with unloading they just uh they'll
[46:07] charge us $76 for that extra night um to
[46:11] stay there um appreciate all the help we
[46:14] absolutely can get and if you can get
[46:16] there as early as possible those who are
[46:18] planning to come up on Thursday if you
[46:20] can get up there as early as possible on
[46:22] Thursday to help with the setup there's
[46:24] I mean concessions and and chairs and AV
[46:29] setup and everything else there's
[46:32] there's a there's a ton of work to do so
[46:35] um soon as sooner you can get up there
[46:37] as um brother Matt mentioned we're still
[46:40] working on we may have a solution for a
[46:42] shuttle driver but um with all the
[46:45] different teams we can't really pull the
[46:46] musicians off to put them on shuttle and
[46:49] we can't pull the security off to put
[46:50] them on shuttle so um if somebody got
[46:53] the inspiration last minute to come and
[46:56] you're over 25 years
[46:58] old
[47:00] um that would be amazing cuz we really
[47:03] could use the help to have a shuttle
[47:06] driver and also last year was so amazing
[47:09] everyone that helped after Sunday I just
[47:11] want to put in your mind don't think
[47:13] service is over I'm gone uh we really
[47:17] need help um we have to load all that
[47:20] stuff that we unloaded we got to put it
[47:24] in the truck and get it back down here
[47:27] because we've got to unload it again and
[47:30] set up the AV again so um we'll do that
[47:34] on Sunday after church just just as far
[47:36] as musicians and people in a that are
[47:38] helping with AV and everyone understand
[47:41] like right after church we should get
[47:43] started right away on those things I
[47:45] think concessions will have their own
[47:46] process and we'll need to stay open just
[47:48] for a little bit after that but
[47:50] nevertheless we need all the help and
[47:52] all the hands that we can get after
[47:53] church Don't just run out right away we
[47:56] need help with the tear down and then
[47:57] again after driving four hours home and
[48:01] being so tired from Youth Camp let's get
[48:04] up again on Monday
[48:07] morning and unload that U-Haul again um
[48:11] I think we usually tried not to do too
[48:13] early but like 9:00 10 o'clock something
[48:16] like that because we have to get the
[48:18] U-Haul back after we've rented it and
[48:21] then uh over the next couple days on
[48:24] Monday and Tuesday musicians will have
[48:26] their plan AV Booth will have their plan
[48:28] for getting everything set up so that we
[48:31] can have service on Wednesday so as you
[48:33] can see there's a lot of help that's
[48:35] needed so if if you're able to cancel
[48:39] all your plans and come help us we sure
[48:40] would appreciate
[48:42] that it is a sacrifice we understand
[48:46] that but it's it's for a great great
[48:48] purpose and we all even in our families
[48:51] have many testimonies about the how the
[48:52] Lord used the Youth Camp to bring
[48:55] Salvation and the Holy Ghost to
[48:57] Deliverance to our own children also um
[49:01] skit skit practice uh will be
[49:04] immediately after church today so we the
[49:08] announcement that went out saying we
[49:09] need all all the uh Camp volunteers to
[49:12] meet after church we're doing that now
[49:15] so um I'd like to get everybody's
[49:17] Commitment if you can text me or let me
[49:20] know if you can come uh help next Sunday
[49:24] after church we' we'd like to know that
[49:26] and if you're able to get up there and
[49:28] help at Camp we'd like to know that as
[49:30] well if if some some of y'all changed
[49:32] your mind cuz I I asked everybody and
[49:35] I'm asking everybody again pray the Holy
[49:38] Spirit just Mo sweeps through the
[49:40] building and changes your
[49:45] hearts and uh provides for your bank
[49:48] accounts as
[49:50] well so young people don't leave do not
[49:54] make brother Luther track you down he is
[49:57] good at it and it might hurt so stay
[50:01] here do not leave if you're a part of
[50:04] the skit do not leave stay here come to
[50:06] the front and be ready sister Deb will
[50:08] be ready I don't know if Chris is going
[50:10] to be helping but we can send Chris to
[50:12] track you down
[50:13] too so don't be TR don't need to be
[50:16] tracked down just stay and come to the
[50:17] front right away as soon as Tony
[50:19] dismisses don't walk that way Walk This
[50:22] Way Amen brother Tony you want to come
[50:25] and lead us in song
[50:29] again amen God bless you you love the
[50:34] Lord praise the Lord I
[50:37] um I just want to make a one or two
[50:41] comments just behind um that and you can
[50:44] carry them brother Andrew that's fine
[50:49] um you know um if I could just say it in
[50:54] this
[50:55] way can camp for our young people is
[51:02] hard it's difficult it it requires a lot
[51:06] of
[51:07] Labor and it requires a lot of
[51:11] sacrifice so I think that's the first
[51:14] thing that we have to get in our mind
[51:17] it's going to take sacrifice and it's
[51:19] going to take all of us pulling together
[51:23] but we're doing it one Soul among our
[51:26] youth is worth 10,000 wordss one and we
[51:30] have a whole church full of them we love
[51:32] them this is our opportunity to provide
[51:35] them with a unique environment a unique
[51:37] experience that's focused on their lives
[51:41] and the choices and decisions that they
[51:44] are facing they're facing a mad world a
[51:47] world far worse than we ever faced for
[51:50] us adults um they face things that you
[51:54] know it when I look back
[51:57] and I I see them facing things just in
[52:00] the last 5 to seven years that seemed
[52:04] unimaginable to me where you couldn't
[52:07] even comprehend that it could ever get
[52:09] that far out of kilter and not only is
[52:13] it completely gone crazy but crazy is
[52:17] the new
[52:19] Norm you agree with me and so I just
[52:23] want to say that it only can work the
[52:27] most efficiently if we're all if all of
[52:30] us are all in so whether you have you
[52:34] know teenagers now you may have in the
[52:37] future and maybe you've got uh little
[52:40] sweetie pies now and they'll always stay
[52:43] Sweetie Pies but they'll face different
[52:46] challenges so you know you start looking
[52:49] forward I I've always said to parents
[52:52] who are just raising small children you
[52:55] be very kind to these parents who are
[52:57] raising teenagers because you have no
[52:59] idea yet amen and and so we're all in
[53:03] this thing together and I think that
[53:05] camp is a wonderful time to prove that
[53:09] amen so set some things aside uh
[53:14] willingly inconvenience yourself all of
[53:17] us are are going to be working full
[53:19] steam when Camp is over um everybody's
[53:23] exhausted everybody and so uh but it's
[53:26] worth it amen praise the Lord you
[53:28] believe
[53:30] it we have our married couples Gathering
[53:32] our second one today it's at 3 p.m. at

[54:57] Brenda Lewis song that song just wow man
[55:01] it's all like it's such an Anthem for
[55:03] the
[55:03] bride before we do that got a couple of
[55:06] prayer requests one is that we want to
[55:09] pray for the homes family um especially
[55:13] for sister Sue um and the children there
[55:17] and brother Mike Wall's assembly there
[55:19] along the Beltway uh brother Nathaniel
[55:23] uh just a young man um got into is you
[55:26] know we don't know all the details yet
[55:29] but he he ended his life yesterday and
[55:33] um the family of course is devastated I
[55:37] I sister Sue wrote me back I'd WR
[55:40] written to her just to let her know we
[55:41] were praying for her and the children
[55:44] and she said of course they are
[55:46] shattered and uh brother Nathaniel loved
[55:49] my wife and I greatly loved my mom loved
[55:52] this church and so we just have to
[55:55] commit those things things to God what
[55:57] else can you do amen it's uh in the
[56:00] hands of the Lord so we just want to be
[56:02] praying for that family sister Brenda
[56:04] also needs prayer today she can't be
[56:07] here she's with her mom um sister Joyce
[56:10] had the heart procedure but they uh went
[56:13] in and came back out and said there's
[56:15] nothing we can do and I happened to know
[56:18] she had the best cardiologist in this
[56:20] area and he said there's just nothing we
[56:23] can do uh she already had open heart
[56:25] surg surgery some years ago she's not
[56:28] willing to do that again and I doubt
[56:29] whether the doctors would be willing to
[56:31] try that again so sister Brenda writes
[56:35] please remember my
[56:37] mom as she continues to have pain and
[56:39] feels like it is leading to another
[56:41] heart attack the doctors are unable to
[56:44] do anything for her we are trusting in
[56:47] the will of God for her knowing he can
[56:50] heal her or let her go home but not
[56:54] before it's her time and in the meantime
[56:57] the natural suffering and knowing from
[57:00] minute to minute if it will be an
[57:02] emergency is hard to watch I need to
[57:04] stay close by to help her at this time
[57:06] please keep us in your prayers God is
[57:09] our comfort and strength and I am so
[57:11] grateful we have him right here with us
[57:13] through this God bless you my church

[57:26] prayer if you'll bow your heads all over
[57:28] the building

[57:32] Brenda and her family we think of sister
[57:35] Joyce right now Lord the physical pain
[57:38] that this kind of thing causes she's in
[57:40] such discomfort there's such anxiety and
[57:43] fear that goes along with those things
[57:45] Lord but we're just up holding her up in
[57:48] prayer sister Brenda her mom the boys
[57:51] the whole family Lord may you strengthen
[57:54] them in this hour if it's your will Lord

[58:04] fight the fight of Faith she told me
[58:06] Lord that she desires to be one of those
[58:09] who are alive and remain at the coming
[58:11] of the Lord father maybe you'll honor
[58:14] that request we sure from our heart ask
[58:17] that of thee if you're going to take her
[58:19] home then Lord don't let the enemy just
[58:21] torment her like that I pray you will
[58:24] strengthen her her heart strengthen her

[58:44] devastating news Lord we had great love
[58:47] for Nathaniel knew him since he was just
[58:49] a boy and Lord we don't understand these
[58:52] things and they're hard to understand
[58:54] but we just give it into your hands we
[58:56] feel Lord at times like the king of
[58:59] Judah who when the enemy was compassed
[59:02] and he just said Lord we have no might
[59:05] against this enemy and we don't know
[59:07] what to do but our eyes are upon thee

[1:03:22] get these uh 10 verses and we'll let you
[1:03:24] be seated
[1:03:27] and Abraham was old and well stricken in
[1:03:30] age and the Lord had blessed Abram
[1:03:32] Abraham in all things and Abraham said
[1:03:35] unto his eldest servant of his house
[1:03:38] that ruled over all that he had this is
[1:03:41] eleazer put I pray thee thy hand under
[1:03:44] my thigh and I will make thee swear by
[1:03:47] the Lord the god of Heaven and the god
[1:03:50] of the earth that thou shalt not take a
[1:03:52] wife unto my son unto my son of the
[1:03:56] daughters of the Canaanites among whom I
[1:03:59] dwell but Thou shalt go unto my unto my
[1:04:03] country and to my Kindred and take a
[1:04:07] wife unto my son Isaac and the servant
[1:04:11] said unto him per Adventure the woman
[1:04:13] will not be willing to follow me unto
[1:04:16] this land must I needs bring thy son
[1:04:19] again unto the land from whence thou
[1:04:21] camest and Abraham said unto him beware
[1:04:26] thou that thou bring not my son thither
[1:04:30] again the Lord God Of Heaven which took
[1:04:34] me from my father's house and from the
[1:04:37] land of my Kindred and which spake unto
[1:04:40] me and that swear unto me saying unto
[1:04:44] thy seed will I give this land he shall
[1:04:47] send his Angel before thee and thou
[1:04:50] shalt take a wife unto my son from then
[1:04:53] and if the woman will not be willing to
[1:04:56] follow thee then Thou shalt be clear
[1:04:58] from this my oath only bring not my son
[1:05:02] thither again and the servant put his
[1:05:05] hand under the thigh of Abraham his
[1:05:07] master and swear to him concerning the
[1:05:10] matter and the servant took 10 camels
[1:05:14] and the cam and the servant took 10
[1:05:17] camels of the camels of his master and
[1:05:20] departed for all the goods of his master
[1:05:24] were in his hand and he arose and went
[1:05:27] to Mesopotamia unto the city of naor
[1:05:30] Amen may the Lord bless the reading of
[1:05:32] his word as your
[1:05:48] seated we're carrying on today I think
[1:05:51] this should be the sixth
[1:05:54] installment um and in our series
[1:05:56] opposing the Judgment of heaven and um
[1:05:59] we want to make some some new ground
[1:06:02] tracks uh make new tracks today in some
[1:06:04] new ground um one of the just just uh
[1:06:09] one or two comments from last time just
[1:06:11] to acquaint you and gather your mind
[1:06:14] amen and get us all going in the same
[1:06:16] direction here we I made a statement to
[1:06:20] you by Smith Wigglesworth from yester
[1:06:23] year and the reason reason that I wish
[1:06:26] to reread that statement to you is
[1:06:30] because even more so I would even almost
[1:06:34] Say by far more than I realized when I
[1:06:37] read it to you last Sunday that it
[1:06:41] really is the key to what the burden uh
[1:06:46] of what it means to be able to be a
[1:06:50] carrier of the word of God in this day
[1:06:53] and operate perfect faith we not ified
[1:06:55] you last time that we realize that
[1:06:59] perfect faith is where is is has always
[1:07:03] been God's plan and I want to say some
[1:07:05] on that today I promised you we would
[1:07:07] take really an an in-depth nuts and
[1:07:09] bolts breakdown of it I plan to keep
[1:07:12] that promise but it's not likely I'll
[1:07:13] get to it today because I'm still trying
[1:07:16] to get the real Crux of my burden well
[1:07:19] that be okay we're not going to go long
[1:07:21] we've got a uh we've already had a
[1:07:23] lengthy preliminary we've got a lot left
[1:07:25] left a busy day lot going on so we won't
[1:07:28] go too far today but I want to try to
[1:07:31] really make sure I anchor this solidly
[1:07:34] in your heart Wigglesworth said to
[1:07:37] hunger and thirst after
[1:07:40] righteousness is when
[1:07:42] nothing in the world can Fascinate us so
[1:07:46] much as being near God so that is
[1:07:49] telling me that you know the world is
[1:07:51] filled with fascinating things the world
[1:07:54] is filled with um tinel and distractions
[1:07:59] and entertainments and sidebars and
[1:08:02] sidetracks and reels and shorts and and
[1:08:06] all kinds of uh media uh that that Vis
[1:08:10] for the attention of your mind and very
[1:08:14] rich men in the world are always
[1:08:17] spending um um eyw watering sums of
[1:08:21] money trying to outcompete the other guy
[1:08:25] this guy over his medium wants your
[1:08:27] attention this guy over here wants your
[1:08:29] attention this guy over here and they're
[1:08:31] all spending money who can get the most
[1:08:34] attention and and here is something that
[1:08:37] is totally free and will give you
[1:08:39] eternal life and put you in heaven I
[1:08:42] would say this is all is what should
[1:08:44] capture the attention of God's family if
[1:08:48] your vision is on things above and I'll
[1:08:50] say more about that
[1:08:52] shortly so the enemy we we said last
[1:08:55] time time and say again he always tries
[1:08:58] to hinder the appeal of the word by
[1:09:01] turning you aside uh from Our obligation
[1:09:06] to press every day and so you know uh
[1:09:09] given that the enemy I made this
[1:09:12] statement to you last time that given
[1:09:14] that the enemy is always trying to do
[1:09:16] that then I think you would agree that
[1:09:20] it would be sensible advice if you don't
[1:09:22] help him amen
[1:09:25] he's already pretty good at his job he's
[1:09:28] already knows how to appeal to your
[1:09:30] weakness he already knows how to
[1:09:33] distract you he's a master psychologist
[1:09:36] he's been doing it he's been practicing
[1:09:39] on human beings for 6,000 years so he's
[1:09:44] he he's no rookie at this see and we are
[1:09:48] no match for him you say well I'm a Son
[1:09:50] of God truly so was Daniel and Daniel
[1:09:53] had an advantage over you was a prophet
[1:09:56] but the Bible said of Lucifer that he
[1:09:58] was wiser than
[1:10:00] Daniel that takes my breath away I I'm
[1:10:03] like what chance do I have if Lucifer is
[1:10:06] even wiser than a great prophet of God
[1:10:09] who when I read Daniel I don't even
[1:10:11] understand everything he said and now
[1:10:12] there's somebody even more powerful than
[1:10:14] him I'm glad there's somebody more
[1:10:16] powerful than the more powerful I'm glad
[1:10:19] that my king my father that that he that
[1:10:23] he he rules the whole world the whole
[1:10:25] universe and I can really truly actually
[1:10:30] do all things through Christ who
[1:10:33] strengthens
[1:10:35] me Satan knows this so quite naturally
[1:10:39] any as as any good strategist War
[1:10:43] Chieftain as any good tactician and
[1:10:46] studying of war strategy would know uh
[1:10:49] he knows that the power that we have
[1:10:52] that it's greater in us than he that's
[1:10:54] in the world you know that we don't
[1:10:57] always act like we know it but I'll
[1:10:59] promise you Satan knows it so he knows
[1:11:02] listen he knows he can't take Christ
[1:11:05] head on he's all that's been tried and
[1:11:08] he failed and got and got deported out
[1:11:12] of heaven and put into the lower parts
[1:11:14] of the earth he already knows that every
[1:11:16] time he comes face to face with the
[1:11:19] pillar of fire he loses see and we know
[1:11:23] we know that Jesus stripped him of every
[1:11:25] weapon that he has but he does have one
[1:11:28] weapon and it's a Psy it's psychological
[1:11:32] weapon and that is brother Adam said his
[1:11:34] greatest his only weapon is if he can
[1:11:37] get you to doubt your
[1:11:39] weapon so what now you just think with
[1:11:42] me what better way would you imagine for
[1:11:46] him to accomplish that he's not going to
[1:11:48] walk up and try to tell you Jesus is a
[1:11:51] liar the word's not true and God's not
[1:11:53] real he knows better than that see so
[1:11:56] what all he needs to do is distract you
[1:11:59] and turn your attention and Fascinate
[1:12:02] You with other things besides the only
[1:12:05] thing that will give you strength make
[1:12:08] sense is that easy see so he knows that
[1:12:13] so that's why I say given that the enemy
[1:12:15] is always trying to to do that I don't
[1:12:18] think we should help him I said to you
[1:12:21] last time and I'm only mentioning it
[1:12:23] again because I didn't have the uh
[1:12:25] figures and I wanted to have the figures
[1:12:28] The Institute of Bible research are the
[1:12:30] ones who conducted that study about
[1:12:32] Bible reading and they found and I said
[1:12:34] to you last time just reading your Bible
[1:12:37] we're not even talking about praying and
[1:12:38] coming to church and fellowshipping the
[1:12:40] Saints those are all augment they all
[1:12:42] work together see but just reading your
[1:12:45] Bible if someone reads the Bible just
[1:12:48] one day per week it has almost no effect
[1:12:52] on their life at all that's what the
[1:12:54] study found
[1:12:56] if someone reads the Bible two or three
[1:12:58] days per week you can see it but it's
[1:13:01] negligible uh in affecting their life a
[1:13:04] little bit it starts to move the needle
[1:13:05] just a little bit on the other hand when
[1:13:08] somebody crosses the Rubicon and begins
[1:13:11] reading the scripture at least four
[1:13:13] times per per week the study shows that
[1:13:17] that person is 30% less likely to
[1:13:20] struggle with loneliness depression and
[1:13:23] anxiety imagine imine if you could
[1:13:26] reduce your anxiety by a third by just
[1:13:29] reading a
[1:13:30] book we're not talking about taking a
[1:13:32] medication we're talking about just
[1:13:33] reading a book see and so a 30% less
[1:13:38] likely to struggle with loneliness
[1:13:40] depression or anxiety 59% less likely to
[1:13:45] view pornography
[1:13:47] 228 times more like percent 228 per more
[1:13:52] likely to share their faith
[1:13:55] and the the the conclusion of the study
[1:13:59] is very simple it's very straightforward
[1:14:02] listen close when the word not the world
[1:14:07] becomes the majority of your week your
[1:14:10] whole life and all your priorities will
[1:14:12] start to change
[1:14:14] amen is that easy when the word not the
[1:14:20] world becomes the majority of your weak
[1:14:24] that's when you're whole life will start
[1:14:26] to change so we find that that what was
[1:14:32] what was um you know brought upon the
[1:14:35] world today that we live in we've talked
[1:14:37] about how that and I'm I just mean last
[1:14:40] Sunday I mean this this whole thing of
[1:14:43] opposing the Judgment of Heaven is that
[1:14:46] we've talked about the greatest
[1:14:48] existential threat to human uh existence
[1:14:52] uh is a is a is a is the deception of
[1:14:57] the last day and and the deception of
[1:15:00] the last day is one and the same with
[1:15:04] the original lie amen the original lie
[1:15:08] told to Eve in the garden and the
[1:15:11] original lie was that you could water
[1:15:13] down God's word and you didn't have to
[1:15:15] believe every word of it and you didn't
[1:15:16] have to practice every word of it that
[1:15:19] you know and that and that lie has has
[1:15:21] propagated you know in into this last
[1:15:24] day a especially and uh you know that
[1:15:28] that that that all you have to do is
[1:15:29] admire the fine qualities of Jesus and
[1:15:33] and and and agree that he's the son of
[1:15:35] God and died to save Sinners and died
[1:15:37] for you and that that's all you need it
[1:15:40] doesn't really matter I I had a man
[1:15:41] saying to me in great sincerity very
[1:15:44] recently a very fine man we actually
[1:15:47] became quick friends and I and but but I
[1:15:51] but I could see the the the blind spot
[1:15:54] is that he had swallowed the lie that it
[1:15:58] doesn't matter the grace of Jesus just
[1:16:00] covers everything you don't really have
[1:16:03] to worry about how you live or what you
[1:16:04] change because there's plenty of Grace
[1:16:07] at Calvary to which I was able to say to
[1:16:10] him and he received it quite in a
[1:16:12] friendly way and I I said to him what
[1:16:15] I've said to you that before the man on
[1:16:18] Calvary existed he was the
[1:16:21] word and that word was made flesh and
[1:16:24] that that flesh man went to Calvary so
[1:16:27] you can't equate the flesh man in any
[1:16:31] way less than the word of God made flesh
[1:16:34] see because that's what he was so when
[1:16:36] you say you have Jesus you love Jesus
[1:16:39] you believe Jesus do you believe the
[1:16:42] word because he was the word before he
[1:16:44] was the man on the cross simple enough
[1:16:47] don't need to keep going over that
[1:16:49] there's one sure thing that will prevent
[1:16:53] perfect Faith from being a reality in
[1:16:56] your life and here's one of the little
[1:16:58] nuts and bolts I am going to touch on
[1:17:00] today if there is one Sure Thing One
[1:17:04] absolutely sure thing that will prevent
[1:17:08] perfect Faith from being a reality in
[1:17:11] your life and when I say being a reality
[1:17:13] I mean the functioning of it amen amen
[1:17:17] now perfect Faith let me say this
[1:17:19] perfect Faith's not a new thing it's not
[1:17:23] it's not just oh it's at the end time of
[1:17:24] the seventh seal and now we we got
[1:17:26] perfect Faith Joshua was operating
[1:17:28] perfect Faith amen and he stopped the
[1:17:31] sun you know why he stopped it because
[1:17:33] he needed it
[1:17:34] stopped and he didn't even have to have
[1:17:36] a prayer meeting to do it he just said
[1:17:38] Son stand still he operated perfect
[1:17:41] Faith now there was a reason that he
[1:17:43] could do that see and then when you and
[1:17:46] you say well maybe I don't need uh the
[1:17:48] son to stand still Jesus talks about
[1:17:52] that you know when you have perfect
[1:17:54] faith
[1:17:55] you will say to this mountain be moved
[1:17:59] be cast into the sea don't doubt it in
[1:18:02] your heart but believe what you've said
[1:18:03] will come to pass now that whole doubted
[1:18:06] in your heart is the is the real key to
[1:18:09] it all because brother brandham talks
[1:18:11] about how that Jesus could operate
[1:18:13] perfect faith in everything he said and
[1:18:16] did because his heart condemned him not
[1:18:19] amen he said I do always that which
[1:18:21] pleases the father so you're starting to
[1:18:23] see a pattern so Joshua was dedicated to
[1:18:27] God that's why he could do that and he
[1:18:30] say well I don't need to move a mountain
[1:18:32] and I don't need to stop the sun I just
[1:18:34] need daily overcoming power it was
[1:18:38] perfect faith that a prophet went back
[1:18:40] to the life of Job and in all of his
[1:18:42] trials and all of his afflictions and
[1:18:44] they were many and they were hard and
[1:18:47] they were worse than anything any of us
[1:18:48] have ever went through but he held his
[1:18:51] faith because his heart he knew that he
[1:18:55] had not broken God's law and that
[1:18:58] enabled him in the Old Testament to
[1:19:01] operate perfect Faith to even when his
[1:19:04] wife said you should just curse God and
[1:19:06] die that was the most sensible thing he
[1:19:09] had
[1:19:11] heard that was absolutely
[1:19:14] logical because how could God be real
[1:19:17] and love and care with all of job's loss
[1:19:21] after job had given him his whole life
[1:19:25] I mean what kind of God is this job that
[1:19:27] you worship what have you done I think
[1:19:30] of a prophet in our day what have I done
[1:19:32] but give you my whole life what have I
[1:19:35] done but preach the gospel night and day
[1:19:37] day and night I I so you know come in
[1:19:40] and just collapse in my chair and get a
[1:19:42] little rest eat some meal go back out
[1:19:44] and preach on the streets what have I
[1:19:46] done so weak from fasting I have to put
[1:19:48] my spurs on just to climb the telephone
[1:19:50] pole and what have I done but go in the
[1:19:53] garages and go in the stores and tell
[1:19:55] everybody I meet man do you know Jesus
[1:19:57] let me tell you about the love of God
[1:19:59] and when it comes to your own baby he
[1:20:02] won't even hear you he won't even talk
[1:20:05] to
[1:20:06] you see and a prophet said he said he he
[1:20:10] said I just said well if that's okay if
[1:20:13] that's the way it is then I'll just and
[1:20:15] he's about to say quit but something
[1:20:17] deep on the inside I'm here to tell you
[1:20:19] something friends you need perfect Faith
[1:20:22] you need it this that day he lived in
[1:20:24] was nothing compared to this day job's
[1:20:26] day pales compared to this day you're
[1:20:29] needing perfect faith and and a prophet
[1:20:31] brought that to us after the seals there
[1:20:33] 1963 I think I said 65 last week it's
[1:20:36] actually 63 but you need to be able to
[1:20:39] operate perfect faith and and so we find
[1:20:42] out that that then quite naturally in
[1:20:46] order to prevent you from operating it
[1:20:49] there's one sure thing that will keep
[1:20:51] you and prevent perfect Faith from being
[1:20:53] a reality in your life and that is to
[1:20:56] believe the
[1:20:59] lie to believe the
[1:21:02] lie that God's word can be Sid stepped
[1:21:05] watered down and that it doesn't it
[1:21:07] doesn't matter how you live it matters
[1:21:11] see so today you know unlike other times
[1:21:15] in this pull pit now now I want to come
[1:21:18] really to my heart because I I thought
[1:21:21] to myself that today I would very much
[1:21:24] like like rather than rather than
[1:21:26] showing you the awful side of of doing
[1:21:30] that with all of the negatives that
[1:21:31] it'll bring on your life and we've
[1:21:33] preached that and preached on it and
[1:21:35] preached on it and preached on it I
[1:21:37] thought today rather than take that kind
[1:21:39] of approach again for the eenth time
[1:21:42] today I felt in my heart a desire like
[1:21:46] Paul had I believe in 1 Corinthians 12
[1:21:49] covet earnestly the best gifts and yet
[1:21:51] show I unto you a more excellent way
[1:21:55] amen I want to today show you a more
[1:21:58] excellent way we've spent a lot of time
[1:22:01] uh talking about the negatives and the
[1:22:03] downside of watering down God's word and
[1:22:06] what that'll do to your life and the
[1:22:08] chaos and we've seen it and we all know
[1:22:10] people who've done that we see the chaos
[1:22:11] that follows in their life so we could
[1:22:14] we could spend another service saying
[1:22:16] don't do that take a stand for the word
[1:22:18] of God but let me just let me flip it
[1:22:20] today and just show you a more excellent
[1:22:23] way I want to tell you something
[1:22:24] something there's nothing like having
[1:22:26] perfect faith in your life that it's
[1:22:29] operating day and night there's nothing
[1:22:31] so so uh comforting to you is that when
[1:22:35] that wayward child and you see them left
[1:22:38] and right and they're they're they can't
[1:22:39] stay in the middle I'm here to tell you
[1:22:41] you're going to want perfect Faith oh
[1:22:45] you're there's nothing like when the
[1:22:46] doctor says there's nothing we can do
[1:22:48] for you you're going to want perfect
[1:22:49] Faith there's nothing like when you when
[1:22:53] when the when the
[1:22:54] go exceeds the income you're going to
[1:22:57] need perfect Faith Hallelujah when a
[1:23:00] world that's broken and and broke woke
[1:23:03] and left and crazy and insane there
[1:23:06] there's got to be somebody that can
[1:23:08] operate perfect
[1:23:13] Faith perfect faith and perfect love now
[1:23:19] because and here's why 1 Corinthians
[1:23:21] 12:31
[1:23:24] is so vital because that's what Paul's
[1:23:26] point is though I have the the tongues
[1:23:29] of men and angels though I give my body
[1:23:31] to be burned and have not perfect love
[1:23:34] profits me nothing amen though I can do
[1:23:37] all things and do great Miracles and you
[1:23:40] know
[1:23:41] uh Ascend the heights of Everest
[1:23:43] whatever you whatever it is you think
[1:23:45] you can accomplish in life though I
[1:23:48] covet earnestly go ahead covet earnestly
[1:23:51] the best gifts but even when you do that
[1:23:53] I can still will show you a more
[1:23:55] excellent way hallelujah amen and that
[1:23:58] way is perfect
[1:23:59] love see and now we're going to find
[1:24:03] here in a statement brother Brandon
[1:24:05] makes um an astonishing statement I told
[1:24:09] I was talking to Brother Brad y I said
[1:24:10] this could almost be the the the the
[1:24:12] center of everything I say we could
[1:24:14] almost read this and go home for the day
[1:24:16] and be
[1:24:17] benefited but perfect love and perfect
[1:24:20] faith brother brandham in in the message
[1:24:23] perfect faith says
[1:24:24] perfect he's talking about perfect Faith
[1:24:26] perfect love that love and faith are Ken
[1:24:29] folks amen see so perfect love and
[1:24:33] perfect Faith are kin they are
[1:24:37] married faith and love Listen to What a
[1:24:41] prophet says and this is only one of
[1:24:42] them I I could have read many I may in
[1:24:44] later Services
[1:24:47] 1953 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[1:24:50] forever that's so perfect for me today
[1:24:53] it was the first one I hit and Hebrews
[1:24:55] 13:8 is is what I'm is what is so strong
[1:24:58] on my heart today Prophet says it this
[1:25:02] way in the 20 years of research of the
[1:25:05] Bible and talking with the angel of the
[1:25:11] Lord and the many things I just want you
[1:25:13] to absorb that for a minute this is a
[1:25:17] prophet who is saying I talked to the
[1:25:20] one that led Moses
[1:25:25] Hallelujah I talked to the one that they
[1:25:29] followed of a A Cloud by day and a fire
[1:25:33] by night I talked to the soldier that
[1:25:37] met Joshua on the other side of Jordan
[1:25:40] and he said he was the captain of the
[1:25:42] Lord's army and a prophet is saying 20
[1:25:45] years of studying the Bible and talking
[1:25:49] with the angel of the
[1:25:50] Lord and the many things I find here is
[1:25:55] two things that is love and
[1:26:00] faith if you now we're not talking about
[1:26:04] you know love like the fuzzy silly
[1:26:07] feeling that filio human love that we
[1:26:10] get gooy over one another we're talking
[1:26:13] about something that far outstrips that
[1:26:16] amen because human love will fail you
[1:26:19] that's right see you you say I love that
[1:26:22] person and that person says they love me
[1:26:25] if it's not true genuine love of God
[1:26:28] then hard times will fail that that love
[1:26:30] is there cuz times are going good but
[1:26:32] when times begin to get hard or when
[1:26:34] there's some kind of a a a great
[1:26:37] disappointment one side to the other I'm
[1:26:39] here to tell you that will fail let me
[1:26:41] just say friends that's why uh it's not
[1:26:45] in my notes and it's feel inspired to
[1:26:46] take the opportunity that I have this
[1:26:48] morning but this is exactly why young
[1:26:52] people listen to me this is exactly why
[1:26:56] you don't look outside of the ranks of
[1:26:59] God's family for your Earthly mate see
[1:27:04] because you say well but they said they
[1:27:06] love me I can prove to you by the Bible
[1:27:10] that they don't love you and you don't
[1:27:12] love them if you don't have the Holy
[1:27:15] Ghost if because the love of God which
[1:27:18] is the only real love is poured into us
[1:27:22] by the Holy Ghost that's what the Bible
[1:27:24] teaches you understand so I'm not saying
[1:27:27] that they're lying to you or you're
[1:27:29] lying to them young person I'm not say
[1:27:31] accusing you are your are your uh
[1:27:34] boyfriend or girlfriend I'm lying I'm
[1:27:35] simply saying what you're saying is
[1:27:38] impossible that you might feel that you
[1:27:40] might think that you might absolutely
[1:27:43] believe that and and listen let let me
[1:27:46] say this I'm not denying that in human
[1:27:49] to human relations you can learn to love
[1:27:52] someone yeah amen I don't they listen
[1:27:54] they've been having arranged marriages
[1:27:57] in eastern culture for
[1:27:59] centuries I remember uh one sister was
[1:28:02] asked about that an elderly sister when
[1:28:05] I was over there with some other
[1:28:06] ministers and brother Bisal and brother
[1:28:07] Donnie different ones and we were there
[1:28:08] holding meetings and I you know brother
[1:28:11] Ed asked one of the Elder sisters CU she
[1:28:14] was part of an arranged marriage her and
[1:28:16] her husband have been together since
[1:28:18] that you know their dads uh put them
[1:28:20] together and brother Ed asked the
[1:28:22] question that we all were wanting to ask
[1:28:25] how do you love someone if it's arranged
[1:28:28] and she just looked at almost
[1:28:30] incredulous she said you learned to love
[1:28:32] yeah so this is a practiced human trait
[1:28:36] I get it I get it I I'm not suggesting
[1:28:39] that everyone who's been married for 50
[1:28:42] years uh was uh maybe found their their
[1:28:45] Divine mate that that elected one maybe
[1:28:48] they've learned to love maybe they
[1:28:50] learned to make it work you can do that
[1:28:53] I can't deny that in the face of history
[1:28:56] and in the face of of of of arranged
[1:28:58] marriages but I will say this that you
[1:29:00] are you are selling yourself short to
[1:29:04] have that perfect one because I'm here
[1:29:07] to tell you you might learn to love them
[1:29:09] they might learn to love you it might
[1:29:11] always never go beyond human fio love
[1:29:14] and if they don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:29:16] that's all it can ever be if you don't
[1:29:18] have the Holy Ghost that's all it can
[1:29:19] ever be but I'm here to tell you you go
[1:29:22] ahead and take that but you are shorten
[1:29:25] shorting yourself on a perfect marriage
[1:29:29] on finding that divinely elected mate
[1:29:33] and you're missing out that elected
[1:29:36] person that's the other half of you is
[1:29:39] somewhere in the
[1:29:41] world and a lot of times you've missed
[1:29:43] that person because you've been trying
[1:29:45] to find
[1:29:47] them rather than trying to find he who
[1:29:51] can bring them to you and Jo you
[1:29:53] together
[1:29:55] together
[1:29:56] amen my I'm already preaching my married
[1:30:00] couple's material but that's actually
[1:30:02] not even in my married coup's material
[1:30:04] for today so just the Lord wanted that
[1:30:07] said so so brother brandham says I want
[1:30:11] to start this quote again in the 20
[1:30:13] years of research of the Bible and
[1:30:15] talking with the angel of the Lord and
[1:30:18] the many things I find here is two
[1:30:19] things that is love and faith if you
[1:30:23] love
[1:30:25] God just purely unadulterated love
[1:30:29] you've got to have faith in him see
[1:30:32] It'll accompany Faith every time so if
[1:30:35] you really have the love of God are you
[1:30:38] starting to see the picture that the
[1:30:40] operation of perfect faith is attached
[1:30:42] to perfect love of God see now we're not
[1:30:45] just talking about as we've said a love
[1:30:47] for God because there's a difference a
[1:30:49] big difference between having a love for
[1:30:52] God and having the love of God amen and
[1:30:54] as I've said the love of God is poured
[1:30:57] into our hearts by the Holy Ghost so he
[1:31:00] says I find two things that is love and
[1:31:03] faith if you love God just purely
[1:31:06] unadulterated love you've got to have
[1:31:09] faith in him it'll accompany Faith every
[1:31:11] time and when love and faith gets
[1:31:16] married you ask what you want to and
[1:31:20] you'll have
[1:31:22] it so you're starting to see the key to
[1:31:25] perfect Faith perfect Faith isn't a new
[1:31:28] thing at the end time perfect faith has
[1:31:31] always been operating make sure you
[1:31:33] don't doze on me amen this is two
[1:31:36] important material set up and pay
[1:31:37] attention
[1:31:39] amen so love and faith go together now
[1:31:44] you can see that Bible readers you can
[1:31:48] see that in the text we read in Genesis
[1:31:51] 24 because he says and I will make thee
[1:31:55] swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and
[1:31:57] the god of the earth that thou shalt not
[1:32:01] take a wife unto my son of the daughters
[1:32:04] of the Canaanite among whom I dwell but
[1:32:07] Thou shalt go unto my country and to my
[1:32:12] Kindred see so he said so brother Ram
[1:32:15] says love and faith are kin folks see
[1:32:18] and you'll go to my Kindred and take a
[1:32:21] wife unto my son so their kin that is to
[1:32:24] say that they're from the same family
[1:32:28] perfect love and perfect Faith are from
[1:32:31] the same family verse five and the
[1:32:34] servant said unto him per Venture the
[1:32:36] woman will not be willing to follow me
[1:32:38] under this land must I needs bring thy
[1:32:41] son again to the land from whence thou
[1:32:43] comest and Abraham said unto him beware
[1:32:46] that thou bring not my son fither again
[1:32:50] you see friends you have to understand
[1:32:53] that that Abraham had already lived
[1:32:55] there he had already had a previous life
[1:32:58] to the life he enjoyed now he had a life
[1:33:01] before he met MDC he had a life before
[1:33:04] he got the promised son he wasn't
[1:33:06] interested in compromising and going
[1:33:10] back to that life if it means getting a
[1:33:12] bride for my son I won't leave the word
[1:33:16] and he's saying to his Prophet don't
[1:33:18] leave the word don't compromise the
[1:33:20] promised word because the god that who
[1:33:24] made me the promise he'll send his Angel
[1:33:27] ahead of you you don't have to abandon
[1:33:30] the word to find happiness you don't
[1:33:32] have to leave the word to find Freedom
[1:33:35] you don't have to leave the word to find
[1:33:36] peace and contentment you don't have to
[1:33:38] leave the word to have a healthy
[1:33:40] marriage or be a young person and be
[1:33:42] popular don't leave the word to do it
[1:33:44] you can stay right in the
[1:33:47] promise of God's word sir my son will
[1:33:51] not leave the promised word for this day
[1:33:54] the day is too important of a day
[1:33:57] friends this is the preparing for the
[1:34:00] wedding supper this is the preparing to
[1:34:03] bring forth The Offspring of my seed
[1:34:05] Gene there's no room for compromise in
[1:34:09] this hour amen this isn't just any day
[1:34:14] see there was a day in Abram Abraham's
[1:34:18] life like in all of our lives there was
[1:34:21] a day of sojourning
[1:34:25] much
[1:34:26] wandering failures yeah caught in lies
[1:34:31] fear left the promised land goes to
[1:34:33] Egypt out of
[1:34:35] fear conniving lying comes out of there
[1:34:39] carried around that ticking Time Bomb
[1:34:40] just waiting oh you know when you've got
[1:34:42] a ticking Time Bomb of sin that you
[1:34:45] haven't let the Holy Spirit take from
[1:34:46] you all it needs is the right
[1:34:49] circumstance and the right atmosphere
[1:34:50] and it'll blow up again see and and
[1:34:53] that's why you're never to walk away
[1:34:55] don't walk around with that ticking Time
[1:34:57] Bomb down inside you let the Holy Spirit
[1:34:59] deliver you of it right now today in
[1:35:02] this service all Abraham he got he gets
[1:35:05] in a jam and he's lying to pharaoh and
[1:35:07] then he gets in another jam and he's
[1:35:08] lying to a BC same lie same exact fear
[1:35:11] same exact lie I'm here to tell you but
[1:35:14] I love it when I look in the Bible
[1:35:16] because once Isaac came on the scene you
[1:35:19] don't find Abraham doing that once it
[1:35:21] became sunship once you came once you
[1:35:24] were sojourning once you were wandering
[1:35:27] once you had all kinds of problems but
[1:35:29] once you entered into the sunship of the
[1:35:31] son of man once you became a child of
[1:35:33] God you then then never again did
[1:35:36] Abraham doubt or fear or kite he didn't
[1:35:39] have to he had met the king
[1:35:42] Hallelujah see so it's it's the this is
[1:35:46] the age of the Bride this is the time of
[1:35:49] the invisible Union this is the time of
[1:35:52] the Harvest so the there's there's no
[1:35:54] room for us to believe the LIE there's
[1:35:57] no room for us to be distracted we need
[1:36:00] to be all in all on uh everything needs
[1:36:04] to be primed and ready on a daily basis
[1:36:07] because you don't never know you say I
[1:36:09] don't need a mount moved your child
[1:36:11] might say I don't need to stop a storm
[1:36:14] your family might need you to say I
[1:36:17] don't got any kind of a problem without
[1:36:19] somebody you love might soon have that
[1:36:21] and you're going to want to have perfect
[1:36:23] faith and that only comes by perfect
[1:36:25] love because they're
[1:36:28] married
[1:36:29] Hallelujah
[1:36:31] see all the wondering and all the
[1:36:34] sojourning it's all come down to this
[1:36:36] glorious hour no you will not take my
[1:36:39] son there he's going to marry my
[1:36:43] Offspring is going to come from my same
[1:36:45] seed Gene line see verse seven the Lord
[1:36:48] God Of Heaven which took me from my
[1:36:51] father's house and from the land of my
[1:36:53] kindred and which spake unto me that
[1:36:55] swore unto me saying unto thy seed will
[1:36:57] I give this land he shall send his Angel
[1:36:59] before thee and thou shalt take a wife
[1:37:01] unto my son from thence verse eight and
[1:37:03] if the woman will not be willing to
[1:37:06] follow thee then Thou shalt be clear of
[1:37:08] this my oath only bring not my son
[1:37:11] thither again I'm so glad to know the
[1:37:14] rest of the story I'm so glad to know
[1:37:18] there was a fair Rebecca
[1:37:20] waiting oh elaser hadn't met he didn't
[1:37:23] know who who she was he didn't even know
[1:37:24] how to find her and so he just stood by
[1:37:27] The Well of water and he said Lord if
[1:37:29] you love my master then provide
[1:37:32] Hallelujah and God what did he do he
[1:37:34] brought her out of her home brought her
[1:37:36] into service that's what he did to me
[1:37:38] that's what he did to you he brought you
[1:37:40] out of a family brought you out of a
[1:37:41] church brought you out of a a barroom
[1:37:43] whatever he did he brought you to The
[1:37:46] Well of Life
[1:37:49] Hallelujah I'm glad to know she said I
[1:37:51] she said I shall th go the servant put
[1:37:56] his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
[1:37:58] master swore unto him concerning the
[1:38:00] matter the servant took 10 camels of the
[1:38:04] camel oh my the servant must have had
[1:38:06] the same Faith Abraham did because he
[1:38:08] took all the treasures and all the gifts
[1:38:09] and all the camels which the camels
[1:38:11] represented the word that would carry
[1:38:13] her back Hallelujah the servant I know
[1:38:16] he asked the question what if she won't
[1:38:17] come there must have been something of
[1:38:20] Faith stirring because he went ahead and
[1:38:22] took the treasures and took the gifts
[1:38:24] and took the camels I know I'll find her
[1:38:26] I know I'll find her the angel of the
[1:38:29] Lord is leading
[1:38:34] me why would anybody
[1:38:37] want a different version of The Gospel
[1:38:40] when we have the the version that's
[1:38:43] actively being led by the angel of the
[1:38:46] Lord
[1:38:49] see there are significantly more signif
[1:38:53] ific anly more some Scholars suggest it
[1:38:56] may be as many as five seven8 10 times
[1:39:00] as many it's it's hard to pin it down
[1:39:03] because a lot of scriptures in the Old
[1:39:05] Testament refer to the first coming and
[1:39:08] the second coming they have a dual
[1:39:09] meaning and sometimes you you have to be
[1:39:12] careful how you divide it but but all
[1:39:14] Scholars agree that there are at the
[1:39:16] very least significantly more scripture
[1:39:19] verses throughout the Old Testament and
[1:39:22] the New Testament that speak of the
[1:39:24] second coming of Christ versus the first
[1:39:27] coming see and so so so H how many you
[1:39:31] know I mean um you know how many have
[1:39:35] have
[1:39:35] turned uh today from looking forward
[1:39:40] right to Looking
[1:39:43] Backward and you know they they've
[1:39:45] they've forsaken their own mercies and
[1:39:48] it didn't matter that their lives fell
[1:39:50] apart and everybody around them that did
[1:39:52] the same thing their lives fell AP part
[1:39:53] marriages exploded and children went
[1:39:55] haywire and and and and all kinds of
[1:39:58] horrible things have happened were it
[1:40:00] not for the grace of God I'm glad
[1:40:02] there's a grace of God because I'm here
[1:40:04] to tell you something friends you you
[1:40:06] can't deny that even sometimes God's
[1:40:09] family God's the Bible has examples of
[1:40:12] even God's family doing things like that
[1:40:15] but the mercy of God was greater I'm so
[1:40:17] glad that the mercy of God was greater
[1:40:21] it didn't matter that Peter denied him
[1:40:23] and ran for his life In The Garden of
[1:40:24] Gethsemane Jesus said when you gather
[1:40:27] and meet me go tell Peter I'll be
[1:40:28] wanting to see him too Hallelujah I'm so
[1:40:31] glad for the mercy of God so that we
[1:40:34] find then that that there's too many
[1:40:37] that look backward at the sacrifice of
[1:40:39] Calvary as as if that's all there is
[1:40:42] rather than seeing Calvary as part of a
[1:40:45] great Symphony that has many parts and
[1:40:49] many pages deep and many instruments and
[1:40:51] many players and it has shos and then
[1:40:54] it'll come down and go back up again
[1:40:55] then get it powerful then it'll get soft
[1:40:57] then it'll go forward and and and that's
[1:40:59] what Redemption is it's a great Symphony
[1:41:02] the sheet music was written by God
[1:41:05] before the foundation of the world and
[1:41:07] it's being played out and they look at
[1:41:09] Calvary as if as if that's all there is
[1:41:12] to Redemption rather than seeing it as a
[1:41:15] part of a greater drama see H now it's
[1:41:19] true you certainly can't bypass Calvary
[1:41:21] but neither can you stay there
[1:41:24] amen amen you can't bypass it don't try
[1:41:27] that don't just sit in a message church
[1:41:29] and believe in Doctrine and think you're
[1:41:30] going to make it you're not you must be
[1:41:32] born
[1:41:33] again you must be all you'll do if you
[1:41:36] do that is you'll grit your teeth and
[1:41:38] try to live like a Believer should and
[1:41:40] it'll drive you nuts until you can't do
[1:41:42] it anymore see I would just say because
[1:41:46] as I've said the Holy Ghost isn't hard
[1:41:48] to get the nature change isn't hard to
[1:41:50] get you you all it re requires is
[1:41:53] surrender all it takes is a total
[1:41:55] repentance and surrender of your entire
[1:41:58] life to God and when God say well I I
[1:42:00] did that but I didn't get it then God
[1:42:02] knows your repentance wasn't
[1:42:04] genuine say well no I really felt it in
[1:42:06] my heart well then he knows you didn't
[1:42:08] repent of everything you're not going to
[1:42:10] make God out to be a
[1:42:12] liar I'm sorry not while I'm not while
[1:42:15] I'm alive nobody's going to accuse God
[1:42:17] of lying you understand they said what
[1:42:20] must we do and Peter said you must
[1:42:22] repent and I'm here to tell you that if
[1:42:24] your repent is thorough and your repent
[1:42:27] is absolute and your repent is
[1:42:29] everything No Holds Barred Lord take my
[1:42:31] whole life I don't want to be me then
[1:42:33] God will keep his promise and the
[1:42:35] rushing Mighty Wind will come down into
[1:42:37] your life as well I don't know what
[1:42:39] you'll feel or what'll happen to you but
[1:42:42] you'll find that this Fallen Life Starts
[1:42:44] coming subject it starts following the
[1:42:47] the word of God and everywhere where it
[1:42:50] fails it says Lord forgive me and help
[1:42:51] me to press on again and help me to
[1:42:54] press on and help me to press on and
[1:42:55] that's what it'll do you might shout you
[1:42:58] might not you might speak in tongues you
[1:43:00] might not you might dance you might not
[1:43:02] you might run you might not but one
[1:43:04] thing you will do you will come subject
[1:43:06] to every word of
[1:43:10] God see
[1:43:13] so so you you certainly can't bypass
[1:43:16] Calvary but neither can you stay there
[1:43:19] because he's not still on the cross amen
[1:43:23] you can't just stay at the cross you
[1:43:25] just stay at the
[1:43:26] tomb you can't just stay merely with his
[1:43:29] Ascension see on when he ascended up on
[1:43:32] high to to to align
[1:43:37] ourselves with perfect Faith which is
[1:43:40] perfect faith and the perfect word the
[1:43:44] what you you know the the the Bible and
[1:43:46] and brother brandom especially in that
[1:43:48] in that message perfect Faith he's
[1:43:50] repeatedly emphasizing and this is what
[1:43:53] really has come so clear to me
[1:43:56] repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly it
[1:43:59] becomes the theme of his message that he
[1:44:02] he continues to emphasize that perfect
[1:44:05] faith is and must be rooted in God's
[1:44:08] word there's no way to have perfect
[1:44:10] Faith operating when you doubt part of
[1:44:12] his word that's just that that's that's
[1:44:15] an absolute in the universe you're not
[1:44:17] going to move that see and so it's it's
[1:44:20] not about personal opinions it's not
[1:44:22] about personal interpretations it's not
[1:44:24] about your own personal experiences to
[1:44:27] operate perfect Faith your desires and
[1:44:30] your actions must align with the word of
[1:44:34] God every word without the exception of
[1:44:38] any of the word
[1:44:40] see brother brandom says it like this in
[1:44:43] perfect faith and one of the things I'm
[1:44:45] doing that I've never done before is I'm
[1:44:47] jumping all around the message usually I
[1:44:49] like to have things I'm my OCD wants me
[1:44:51] to always have it chronologic ically and
[1:44:53] goes like that I don't really have OCD
[1:44:55] but devil tries to sell it to me
[1:45:00] but but but but he says it like
[1:45:05] this oh what I was saying was that I'm
[1:45:08] gonna I might here's a quote from
[1:45:10] paragraph 138 and then later I might
[1:45:12] read one from paragraph 33 and then I
[1:45:13] might jump up to 61 and come back to 19
[1:45:16] because that that's how uh this this
[1:45:18] whole thing has come real to me he says
[1:45:21] here when you got
[1:45:24] Pure I got to hurry when you got Pure
[1:45:29] unadulterated Faith Like Your Love Is to
[1:45:33] your companion amen see here's where we
[1:45:36] were concluding last Sunday we didn't go
[1:45:38] into this quote when you got Pure
[1:45:41] unadulterated Faith Like Your Love Is to
[1:45:44] your companion then you prove it by the
[1:45:48] way you act amen that is so simple yeah
[1:45:52] I I don't see how anyone can can refute
[1:45:56] that
[1:45:57] sensibly I mean it is it not the natural
[1:46:00] typing the spiritual could I could I
[1:46:03] convince you that I loved sister Debbie
[1:46:06] if I treated her
[1:46:08] bad no one would believe that she
[1:46:10] certainly wouldn't believe it you
[1:46:12] understand and so it's not just I told
[1:46:15] you I loved you when I married you if I
[1:46:16] ever changed my mind I'll let you know
[1:46:18] that's a joke that's not true right she
[1:46:22] she she knows every day that I love her
[1:46:26] she knows every day I'll will never
[1:46:28] leave her never I will never leave her
[1:46:32] she'll never leave me we're together for
[1:46:35] eternity see so when you have a pure
[1:46:40] love and an unadulterated Faith you see
[1:46:42] what makes the position of the man I was
[1:46:46] referring to that I met and spoke to you
[1:46:49] realize what makes that so untenable to
[1:46:52] the Holy Spirit you can't say that you
[1:46:55] have the love of God and not follow his
[1:46:58] word that's in congruous that's that's
[1:47:00] illogical that's
[1:47:02] nonsensical and God won't honor that
[1:47:05] doesn't matter what you think in your
[1:47:06] head you've still got to prove it by
[1:47:08] your life
[1:47:10] see that's why a prophet would say you
[1:47:13] might shout or dance or run you might
[1:47:15] not do any of those things but one thing
[1:47:17] for sure you will come subject to every
[1:47:19] word because why because God makes me no
[1:47:23] do you think sister Debbie all all 110
[1:47:27] lbs of her can make me do anything I
[1:47:30] promise you she can't take me out in the
[1:47:31] yard and give me a
[1:47:33] whipping sometimes I'd rather she'd just
[1:47:35] do that but she has no ability to make
[1:47:40] me do anything I do everything because I
[1:47:44] love her and I want her and I live to
[1:47:46] see her happy and I live to see that
[1:47:48] smile and vice versa she does the exact
[1:47:51] same things see
[1:47:53] and so so he says when you got Pure
[1:47:56] unadulterated Faith Like Your Love Is to
[1:47:59] your companion then you prove it by the
[1:48:02] way you act you ain't complaining no
[1:48:04] more you know it's done just walk along
[1:48:07] no matter what the thing looks like what
[1:48:09] anybody else says you know what's
[1:48:12] happened you know that it's finished
[1:48:14] just as well as you know you love your
[1:48:17] husband as well as you know you you love
[1:48:19] your wife love and faith has to go
[1:48:22] together they kin folks they love love
[1:48:26] produces Faith see so so when you have
[1:48:30] found I mean
[1:48:33] look I didn't I I I'll make this
[1:48:37] statement I'll make this statement I'm a
[1:48:38] little bit ahead of myself but I want to
[1:48:40] I want to make the statement so that you
[1:48:42] can get it and you can understand it
[1:48:45] when it comes to perfect
[1:48:48] Faith now hear me because I've thought a
[1:48:50] lot about how to say this
[1:48:53] when it comes to perfect Faith you can't
[1:48:56] go get it amen all you can do is prepare
[1:49:01] yourself to receive it amen you
[1:49:04] understand amen perfect faith has to
[1:49:06] come from God the best you can have is
[1:49:09] human faith and be that as it may that
[1:49:12] may that may not that even human Faith
[1:49:15] with all your human faith brother brand
[1:49:16] talks about some people just have a
[1:49:18] bulldog Faith they can just I mean even
[1:49:20] even brother Brandon would catch uh
[1:49:23] women and men in the prayer line who
[1:49:25] weren't living right and they would
[1:49:27] still get healed because brother said
[1:49:28] that's just Faith they they that that
[1:49:31] that Dean of that college told him of
[1:49:33] that bible school said brother brandom I
[1:49:35] had a lot of confidence in you till I
[1:49:36] heard you say that Satan can't heal and
[1:49:39] he says why we've got a a a soothsaying
[1:49:42] woman we've got a a magician woman you
[1:49:45] know uh in our community and people walk
[1:49:47] in and they bring a piece of their hair
[1:49:49] and she does puts something in it and
[1:49:50] throws it over her back and the the
[1:49:52] disease Jesus leave the people and
[1:49:54] brother brandham wrote him back and he
[1:49:55] said I'm surprised that a scholar a man
[1:49:58] of your stature would say to me that
[1:50:01] Satan can heal when Jesus said he can't
[1:50:05] amen said that woman all that woman is
[1:50:08] doing is she's people are putting their
[1:50:10] faith in that and Faith moves and
[1:50:13] brother Brandon would stand there to
[1:50:15] that young woman and he would take the
[1:50:16] ceiling fan and he would say now just
[1:50:18] watch it and he would start making it
[1:50:19] rotate and he would stop it he'd start
[1:50:21] making it back rotate he go to the mini
[1:50:23] blind or the the window blind he'd raise
[1:50:25] it and cl and close it just by looking
[1:50:26] at it she said brother bandam that's
[1:50:29] spiritualism he said it's not
[1:50:30] spiritualism all it's just
[1:50:32] Faith he said another place give me any
[1:50:34] crossy child I'll straighten her eyes
[1:50:36] just by looking at him and he could
[1:50:37] prove it he could prove it he said now
[1:50:40] as soon as she gets outside they'll go
[1:50:42] back cross again see they asked him do
[1:50:45] you have to be a Christian to get healed
[1:50:47] he said no you don't have to be a
[1:50:48] Christian to get healed he said you need
[1:50:50] to be a Christian if you want to stay
[1:50:51] healed
[1:50:53] amen see because it's it's your faith in
[1:50:56] God that's just like that gift of
[1:50:58] discernment as perfect and Flawless as
[1:51:00] that was and never missed and yet
[1:51:02] brother brandom said it never healed
[1:51:04] anybody all it did was give people Faith
[1:51:06] to believe what God had already done for
[1:51:08] them what Christ did at Calvary every
[1:51:11] Redemptive blessing is yours because of
[1:51:14] Calvary see and so so we realize then
[1:51:18] that that that when we talk about
[1:51:20] perfect faith that you have to
[1:51:23] understand that perfect faith is not
[1:51:25] something you go get it it's something
[1:51:27] you prepare yourself to receive and then
[1:51:31] you are trained in the word of God how
[1:51:32] to operate it see so so that I said I
[1:51:36] jumped ahead of myself to say this just
[1:51:38] like when you when you found your loved
[1:51:40] one you didn't go
[1:51:44] unprepared you you you heard there was
[1:51:46] going to be a youth Gathering there's
[1:51:48] going to be a youth camp there's going
[1:51:49] to be some young people you didn't just
[1:51:51] go unprepared you didn't go your pajamas
[1:51:53] with Bed
[1:51:54] Head you heard there was going to be a
[1:51:56] pretty girl there you dressed up you
[1:51:58] cleaned up I hope
[1:52:00] so and you you walked in there's only
[1:52:03] one chance to make a first impression
[1:52:05] and so you you you prepared yourself to
[1:52:09] go receive something if you loved her
[1:52:12] you're going to want to make sure it
[1:52:14] gets
[1:52:15] reciprocated so what did you do you
[1:52:18] couldn't go you you couldn't I mean
[1:52:20] that's how perfect Faith Works you can't
[1:52:22] go demand it see you you know it's um
[1:52:27] it's it you can't demand it um you you
[1:52:30] can't even expect it until you prepare
[1:52:34] yourself make sense see so he says they
[1:52:38] kin folks love produces faith when Satan
[1:52:42] tempts
[1:52:44] us we are to resist him in a perfect
[1:52:48] faith in a perfect word so that's how
[1:52:51] it's going to work a perfect perfect
[1:52:52] faith in a perfect word how you going to
[1:52:55] get perfect Faith to work if you don't
[1:52:56] have perfect faith in the perfect word
[1:52:59] see so so when Satan tempts us we are to
[1:53:02] resist him in a perfect faith and a
[1:53:04] perfect word like Jesus did the word of
[1:53:07] God is perfect we we're to have perfect
[1:53:11] faith in this perfect word and resist
[1:53:14] Satan Jesus had perfect Faith he had it
[1:53:18] and it come because he was the word and
[1:53:21] then you become the word you become the
[1:53:24] word as you receive the word amen you
[1:53:27] see you see what's happening when you
[1:53:29] read it more than once or two or three
[1:53:31] times in a week when you when you read
[1:53:34] it a lot you are what you eat the Bible
[1:53:36] says we are transformed into the things
[1:53:38] we gaze at so what are you gazing at say
[1:53:41] I got this problem that problem this
[1:53:42] week because I can't overcome it what
[1:53:44] are you gazing at what are you feeding
[1:53:46] on see this is not rocket science you
[1:53:50] understand many of God's true Born Again
[1:53:53] children struggle for years over things
[1:53:55] they can't defeat and that's why perfect
[1:53:58] Faith would take that thing and
[1:54:00] annihilate it if you know how to operate
[1:54:02] it see so he he said if you and so now
[1:54:06] look at the premise here's what it's
[1:54:07] based on he said you become the word he
[1:54:11] says it again you become the word as you
[1:54:13] receive the word he quotes the Lord if
[1:54:16] ye abide in me and my words in you is
[1:54:20] that what Jesus said see
[1:54:22] my words which this word abides in you
[1:54:27] then ask what you will and it'll be done
[1:54:30] for you see so when we look at it like
[1:54:34] that friends and I'm coming down to a
[1:54:35] close just make these last
[1:54:38] comments
[1:54:40] so we come down because that we
[1:54:44] are infused with eternal
[1:54:47] life you believe you
[1:54:50] are infused with eternal life then then
[1:54:55] that gives me an an eternal perspective
[1:54:58] would it not if you're infused with
[1:55:01] eternal life remember brother brandham
[1:55:02] said if I had the life of John Dillinger
[1:55:04] in me I'd carry guns and rob banks if I
[1:55:06] had the life of Harry Houdini I'd do
[1:55:08] magic tricks and be an escape artist you
[1:55:10] know and so he says but so if I say I've
[1:55:13] I'm in if I have the Life of Christ then
[1:55:15] how will that not make my nature like
[1:55:17] his see so when you're infused with
[1:55:20] eternal life you have an eternal
[1:55:23] perspective then your life becomes a
[1:55:26] willing vessel for all the training you
[1:55:29] will ever need for the world to come and
[1:55:31] training can be difficult but what
[1:55:33] training for an army is not
[1:55:37] difficult people don't be in this day
[1:55:40] it's just it's just so sad that people
[1:55:43] are not willing to have hard work and
[1:55:46] face things just face things just you
[1:55:50] know they they have aund say man up
[1:55:53] Cowboy Up you know girl power all these
[1:55:56] different things I'm here to tell you
[1:55:57] that's all people whistling by a
[1:55:59] graveyard there is a way to man up there
[1:56:02] is a way to be a real Son of God a real
[1:56:04] daughter of the Kingdom you feed upon
[1:56:06] the word of God you become the word of
[1:56:08] God and I'm here to tell you the word of
[1:56:09] God ain't afraid of the devil the word
[1:56:11] of God ain't afraid of a mountain that
[1:56:13] needs moving the word of God ain't
[1:56:14] afraid of those things the word of God
[1:56:17] will defeat Satan anytime anywhere under
[1:56:19] any condition and the word of God will
[1:56:21] speak us
[1:56:24] the word of God will stand up and speak
[1:56:27] up see and so so a lot of times we have
[1:56:32] to set our mind on things above I I
[1:56:35] thought about that when when we were T
[1:56:38] when when I was reading that study from
[1:56:39] the Bible Institute my goodness what an
[1:56:41] exponential jump from two to three times
[1:56:43] a week to uh four four days a week and
[1:56:48] uh what an exponential jump and I
[1:56:50] thought you know it's about setting your
[1:56:51] mind on things above and and and can I
[1:56:54] can I say it like this I'm not limiting
[1:56:58] when I say set your minds on things
[1:57:01] above which the Bible commands us it's
[1:57:04] not about merely thinking about Heavenly
[1:57:07] principles it's a it's it's it's equally
[1:57:10] or more so uh it's setting your mind on
[1:57:15] things going on
[1:57:18] above amen things going on on above this
[1:57:24] is about life going on in another realm
[1:57:28] that's what it means to set your mind on
[1:57:31] things above I'm aware there's a whole
[1:57:34] another life going on above me I it's
[1:57:38] it's there I believe in a in a right now
[1:57:40] heaven right now I believe that it's
[1:57:43] operational it's up and running it's a
[1:57:46] real place and it has real influence on
[1:57:49] our lives and Angels really do move in
[1:57:52] around us hallelujah oh what they are
[1:57:56] planning for and they're building and
[1:57:58] they're actively preparing for the life
[1:58:01] that is to come very soon for all of
[1:58:04] God's family for all those throughout
[1:58:06] the world who have put their trust in
[1:58:07] him you know I think about the people in
[1:58:09] the Bible I think about Moses Moses saw
[1:58:12] them Ezekiel Saw them Isaiah saw them
[1:58:15] Zachariah saw them Paul saw them brother
[1:58:19] Ram saw you know what you know what all
[1:58:20] these men saw that John went there John
[1:58:23] saw it you know what they saw they saw
[1:58:26] activity yeah they saw people in
[1:58:30] movement they saw angels praising they
[1:58:33] saw living creatures influencing they
[1:58:37] had a SE a glass they they had a
[1:58:39] Heavenly Host they had Elders 4 and2 of
[1:58:41] them Hallelujah heaven is real and it's
[1:58:44] really happening and it's influencing
[1:58:46] the Earth and it's influencing me and I
[1:58:48] just say Lord God let this Earth be
[1:58:51] influenced by that Heavenly

[1:59:18] its influence on my and I want to have
[1:59:21] it more not less more and the way I'm
[1:59:24] going to do that is I'm going to lay
[1:59:26] aside the weights and sins that so
[1:59:29] easily beset me so that I can run this
[1:59:32] wrath so that I can have perfect Faith
