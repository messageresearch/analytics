[4:58] And nothing
[5:00] I
[5:02] desire
[5:04] compares
[5:06] with you.
[5:08] &gt;&gt; You say amen to that.
[5:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise God. How grateful we are. We
[5:12] have a living
[5:14] father that loves us and keeps us. Uh
[5:17] brother Joe couldn't make it today. He
[5:19] wasn't feeling well. I want to remember
[5:21] him. Sister Angie Heath is uh it's a
[5:25] family friend in Montana. It's actually
[5:28] the in-laws on the other side of my
[5:30] oldest daughter's
[5:32] marriage.
[5:34] And so she's she's dealing with a second
[5:37] bout of cancer going through chemo and
[5:41] um she really doesn't have a support
[5:43] group up there or church that she goes
[5:45] to. She counts this as her church. I
[5:47] just I just ask that you would just
[5:50] remember her in prayer as we pray and
[5:53] just continue. She um she had breast
[5:57] cancer. She had been removed and then um
[6:01] you know they said it came back in her
[6:02] lungs and stuff. So we just want to
[6:04] remember her. She's probably
[6:06] I'm thinking 50 years old.
[6:10] So we want to remember her. if you have
[6:12] a request upon your heart this morning
[6:14] um that you want the Lord to just speak
[6:17] to you specifically about what you've
[6:19] got on your heart. Amen. Let's pray.
[6:25] Father, I love you this morning.
[6:28] Lord, if I didn't have you as a as my
[6:30] father,
[6:32] if I didn't have you as my confidant, my
[6:35] friend, my brother,
[6:39] Lord, I would be groping in darkness.
[6:42] I'll be so lost.
[6:44] But I'm so thankful, Father, that you
[6:46] reach down your hand,
[6:48] Lord, where you said, "No man can come
[6:50] to you unless the Father draws us." I'm
[6:53] thank you for that drawing, Lord, this
[6:55] morning. I pray for Joe, father, not
[6:58] feeling well the last few days. And
[7:01] Father, we are praying for a complete
[7:03] victory, complete healing for our
[7:05] brother. Lord, doesn't matter what the
[7:07] symptoms say or what's going on. We know
[7:10] that you are more than able. And we're
[7:11] claiming that promise in the name of
[7:13] Jesus Christ for our brother. As we
[7:16] remember Sister Angie today, Lord,
[7:20] Father, sometimes life, you get down low
[7:24] and you just need a God with skin on it.
[7:27] As our brother spoke,
[7:29] I pray for her this morning. Father, I'm
[7:32] asking that you would touch her and help
[7:34] her. Father, it doesn't matter what
[7:36] stage
[7:38] even cancer cannot stand before you in
[7:42] our prayer of faith this morning. I love
[7:45] you, Father. I pray that you'll bless
[7:46] your people this morning. Lord, we are
[7:49] asking it's a Father earnest of our
[7:53] salvation. The children's bread is
[7:55] healing of the body, Father.
[7:58] And Lord, you are the one that keeps
[7:59] your word and we believe it, Father. We
[8:02] love and worship you this morning. We
[8:04] pray that you just have your way,
[8:06] Father, throughout this whole day,
[8:08] especially in the greatest form of
[8:10] worship. when the word comes forth, may
[8:12] we just step aside and allow you to have
[8:13] your way. Father, touch our hearts,
[8:16] strengthen us that we may leave this
[8:18] place better, Father, than when we came
[8:20] in. As we collect the tithes and
[8:23] offerings, Lord, I pray that you would
[8:24] bless the cheerful giver. We thank you
[8:26] for the blessings you give us and the
[8:28] bounty you provide. Father, we are
[8:30] grateful in every way. In Jesus Christ's
[8:33] name we pray this morning. Amen.
[8:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you greet one another in
[8:39] the name of the Lord this morning? I
[8:42] want to say welcome to our visitors. God
[8:45] bless you, brother George. You back

[33:15] &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord, right now. Right now,
[33:23] &gt;&gt; oh, this dark age, Lord. We need you.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; We need you.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord. We need bright.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, hear our prayer today. We lift our
[33:39] hands
[33:40] and bow our knees
[33:43] and worship
[33:45] at your throne.
[33:48] [Music]
[33:50] We need you, Lord. We need you, Lord,
[33:55] right
[33:57] now.
[33:58] [Music]
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[34:02] God bless you, friends. Greet in the
[34:04] name of the Lord. Happy to have you in
[34:05] the house of God today. Amen. Turn
[34:08] around and greet somebody with a good
[34:09] hearty handshake. Say, "God bless you,
[34:11] pilgrim." Amen. That's what we are on a
[34:14] pilgrim journey.
[34:16] Praise the Lord.
[34:21] Amen.
[34:24] So, we're going to invite you right away
[34:26] to Isaiah chapter 14.
[34:29] Happy to have you in the house of God
[34:30] today. Rainy day. Amen. Maybe the Lord
[34:34] will rain down with his presence. Amen.
[34:36] Praise God. We not maybe he promised he
[34:39] would. Amen. We gather in his name,
[34:41] proclaim his word, and if you believe
[34:42] it, then that's and he will uh he'll
[34:46] absolutely do that. Praise the Lord.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to um after service,
[34:51] you've been seeing the announcements
[34:53] we're having try to figure out what the
[34:55] weather's going to do. So, I told
[34:57] Brother Brad, he's uh going to have to
[34:58] be the meteorologist today and make the
[35:00] call. And so we're trying to figure out
[35:03] what all we can do uh this afternoon and
[35:05] if we can get everybody helping. Um we
[35:09] had the question of do we let them go to
[35:11] lunch, come back, but I don't think
[35:12] we'll need to do that. I think it'll go
[35:14] very quickly if everybody will pitch in.
[35:16] We'll have to be careful because if it's
[35:19] even a light drizzle, that ramp, that
[35:21] loading ramp will be slick. So uh just
[35:24] be careful. Amen. They'll try to
[35:25] organize it. I think they're going to
[35:27] try to uh maybe have some food um at
[35:30] least on the side. Won't be your ideal
[35:32] lunch food, but it'll be good enough.
[35:35] Praise the Lord. You love him.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Um so that that'll
[35:41] just be we'll figure that out as we get
[35:43] right to the end. And then if we have
[35:45] some left over, if we can't load up the
[35:48] m the the instruments today and a lot of
[35:50] the AV equipment because you can't
[35:51] really do that in the rain, uh then
[35:53] tomorrow that's a holiday and maybe some
[35:56] people could uh be willing to come back.
[35:58] But hopefully we can get it today. We
[35:59] might get a little bit of a break. I've
[36:01] been praying. Amen. You have not because
[36:03] you asking a lot. So I put it in order.
[36:05] I said, "Lord, we we we could really use
[36:07] some no rain."
[36:09] Amen. And I've I've had that happen,
[36:11] friends, back in the day, so many times
[36:14] where I had a job and I had to finish it
[36:16] and there was no option. I had hungry
[36:18] children to feed and it was raining and
[36:21] if I don't finish it today, I don't get
[36:24] paid. And then then it's the weekend and
[36:26] I would just say, "Lord, I don't care if
[36:28] it rains o over this entire city. I
[36:31] don't care if it rains in this
[36:32] neighborhood. Just don't let it rain on
[36:34] this house." And you cannot imagine how
[36:36] many times, brother Mark, how many times
[36:38] I literally would be painting. This is a
[36:41] true story. I have been painting before
[36:44] and it raining in the street in front of
[36:47] the place and the side street that went
[36:50] this way, raining on that one, and not
[36:52] raining on what I'm painting. Raining
[36:54] behind it, raining around it, raining
[36:56] everywhere. And uh I I've had
[36:58] eyewitnesses of that who were astonished
[37:01] at that. And I said, "Well, I've just
[37:03] learned how to pray." Amen. Praise God.
[37:06] Amen. So, we're just looking for that.
[37:08] If it if it is, we'll figure it out. But
[37:10] it's up to the Lord. I just figure that
[37:12] uh hey, you're nothing if you don't try.
[37:14] So, pray ask. Brother Brandham said,
[37:17] "Ask big."
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I just heard him just yesterday.
[37:20] You can't people he said people are
[37:22] worried about, you know, bothering him.
[37:24] He said, "You can't bother him. Oh, I
[37:26] don't want to ask too much." You can't
[37:27] ask too much. You'll never ask as much
[37:29] as he wants to do. So just go ahead and
[37:32] and and swing for the fences as they
[37:35] say. Amen. Praise the Lord. I remember
[37:37] back in the day, brother brother Dale
[37:39] told me that the way the first time he
[37:41] ever met Sister Joanne, the first time
[37:42] he ever laid eyes on her, she was on a
[37:45] high school softball team and he said
[37:47] she stepped up to the plate and cracked
[37:49] one and they never caught it. It would
[37:51] cleared the fence and brother Dale said,
[37:53] "That's my kind of woman."
[37:57] Amen.
[37:58] So, uh, Amen. So, I I just think that
[38:02] we've seen God do too much to doubt him.
[38:04] Amen. And I've seen him do too much, uh,
[38:07] to question him whether, however he
[38:10] decides to answer it. I'm not going to
[38:11] doubt him. And however he answers it,
[38:13] I'm not going to question him. Amen.
[38:15] Praise the Lord. Amen. Isaiah chapter
[38:18] 14. Amen. We um, happy to have uh,
[38:21] everybody here today. I think uh, Sister
[38:23] Vicki was here somewhere. Here she is.
[38:24] Sister Vicki, God bless you. Happy to
[38:26] have you here today. Amen. Praise the
[38:28] Lord. And any other visitors, amen, that
[38:30] are here with us. God bless you.
[38:33] Amen. Isaiah, Isaiah 14. We're
[38:37] continuing on today uh with Satan's
[38:40] competing claim from uh last last time.
[38:45] Isaiah 14:13 and 14. We have two verses.
[38:48] We'll let you be seated.
[38:51] This is Satan. Speaking of Satan, this
[38:53] is when the prophet outed him. A That's
[38:55] right. Amen. Nathaniel, good to have you
[38:57] here today, too. Amen. For the Lord has
[39:01] said in thine heart,
[39:03] I'm so glad I got people who won't let
[39:05] me forget stuff.
[39:07] Amen. For the Lord has said in thine
[39:09] heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will
[39:14] exalt my throne above the stars of God.
[39:18] I will sit also upon the mount of the
[39:21] congregation in the sides of the north.
[39:25] I will ascend above the heights of the
[39:28] clouds. I will be like the most high.
[39:32] Quite a bold statement. My I will be
[39:35] like the most high. My goodness. Amen.
[39:38] Let's pray.
[39:41] Father, we thank you for your word today
[39:44] and we ask for your blessing upon it
[39:46] now. Lord, you see the burden of the
[39:50] word that's upon my heart. And and
[39:52] today, Lord, we just want to be able to
[39:55] take our time and and go very
[39:57] methodically. I don't want to miss
[39:59] anything. I think these points are so
[40:02] relevant to the hour we live and so
[40:04] vitally important that we wouldn't want
[40:06] to miss what is your people need to
[40:09] receive today. So, help me not to feel
[40:12] hurried, Lord. uh we don't want to wear
[40:15] the people out as you know as I am as I
[40:18] preach. I don't not a long preacher but
[40:20] I want to be concise. So I ask for your
[40:23] mercy today in Jesus name. Amen. God
[40:26] bless you friends. You can be seated.
[40:40] Now if you will turn with me in your
[40:41] Bibles. We're going to go to Ephesians
[40:43] chapter 5. And uh if you'll give me that
[40:47] uh brother Kevin, Ephesians chapter 5.
[40:51] We're going to u read these. I let you
[40:54] be seated for that because it's a
[40:56] lengthy reading.
[40:58] And I um you know I I want to
[41:02] just remind you that in our text where
[41:05] we read from Isaiah as you're turning to
[41:07] to Ephesians 5 that Satan is making
[41:12] these are counter claims to the ones
[41:14] that Jesus made in the book of
[41:16] Revelation that you know that he will be
[41:20] their God and he will dwell with them in
[41:22] the earth and they will be his his
[41:24] family and his children. And so Jesus
[41:27] has a claim that he's figuring how it's
[41:30] going to end up. But Satan has a polar
[41:33] opposite claim that he actually intends
[41:37] to be above the stars of God, which are
[41:39] the sons of God, the family of God. So
[41:42] you can imagine that in the book of
[41:44] Revelation how that it declared a
[41:48] position that you you can't get higher
[41:51] then you you there's no way to be higher
[41:55] than for God to be your father and you
[41:58] to be his son.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; And that in the new heavens and the new
[42:02] earth, God himself will dwell with you.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; There's no accomplishment. Uh brother
[42:09] George, good to see you, too. I see you
[42:11] here still with us today and some
[42:12] visitors in the back. God bless you.
[42:14] Amen. Sister Sister Brother John's
[42:16] family. Amen. Praise the Lord. Happy to
[42:17] have them today. Um and so I'm sure I'm
[42:20] missing somebody. So, Amen. But that
[42:23] should hopefully cover everybody. Um so
[42:26] these are these are Satan is now
[42:30] counterclaiming,
[42:31] no, I'm actually going to be higher than
[42:34] the sons of God. Well, how do you how's
[42:37] that going to work, Lucifer? because I'm
[42:40] I'm going to be a son of God dwelling
[42:43] with God.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; So, but Lucifer is not saying Lucifer is
[42:47] not saying that, you know, I'm going to
[42:49] create another position above that. What
[42:53] he's simply saying is is that the claim
[42:55] that the Lord has made about himself and
[42:58] you is not happening.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Full stop. That's his claim. I'm going
[43:03] to be above the sons of God. I'm
[43:05] actually going to be the one sitting at
[43:07] the head of the congregation and the
[43:09] sides of the north. I'm actually going
[43:12] to ascend above the heights of the cloud
[43:14] of witnesses. I will be like the most
[43:18] high. So, this is Satan desiring
[43:22] worship. Now, here is a here's a turn.
[43:27] And if you you're really going to want
[43:29] to get my turn because I'm going to just
[43:32] you know when when you're when you're
[43:33] teaching which is trying what I'm going
[43:35] to try to do today. Uh you you you tell
[43:38] them what you're going to tell them. You
[43:40] tell them and then you tell them what
[43:42] you've told them.
[43:45] That's that I'm serious. That's that's a
[43:47] that's a that's a motif. That's a that's
[43:50] a saying. That's a that they they train
[43:52] you for that. When you're when you're
[43:54] teaching a lesson, tell them what you're
[43:56] going to tell them. Tell them then tell
[43:58] them what you've told them and that way
[44:00] when you leave here you've got it. So
[44:02] I'm about to really tell you where I'm
[44:04] headed because Satan is not making this
[44:07] claim merely hoping at the finish line.
[44:10] He's somehow miraculously going to pull
[44:12] it off.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; He's actually staging to accomplish it
[44:17] now in your life because your life is a
[44:20] worship.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; So this is a here and now. I'm not
[44:27] preaching about somewhere over a
[44:29] rainbow. I'm here to tell you Satan
[44:31] believes he can get there then because
[44:33] of what he can do here now.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; And that's how the Holy Spirit is
[44:39] working as well. Jesus has made a
[44:41] tremendous claim and he's not waiting to
[44:44] get there then to do it. He's working to
[44:47] get there then here and now. So this is
[44:51] the battle. This is the epic tugofwar
[44:54] that is going on. And Christ is
[44:59] attempting to gain worship from your
[45:02] life. And Lucifer is attempting to gain
[45:06] worship from your life.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Choose you this day.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Bradis preached the power of
[45:13] decision. So such a wonderful uh
[45:15] wonderful quote. And uh brother Caleb
[45:18] actually posted a quote so tremendous
[45:20] and I I wanted to get to it today. I
[45:22] don't think I'll have the time, but I'll
[45:24] put it in the next next installment.
[45:27] All right. So now So now we come to
[45:30] Ephesians 5. And here is a here is an
[45:35] overcomer 101.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is training 101 how to be an
[45:42] overcomer
[45:43] &gt;&gt; because we're in a battle
[45:45] &gt;&gt; and God is getting worship and Lucifer
[45:47] is getting worship and they're both
[45:48] getting plenty
[45:50] &gt;&gt; and the worship could not be different
[45:53] could not be more different. Yeah. I'm
[45:55] here to tell you something friends when
[45:57] you're a Christian you're when you're
[46:00] really Christian and your your life is a
[46:04] worship you're nothing like the world.
[46:08] at all.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Every facet, every aspect of your daily
[46:15] walking around talking, breathing life
[46:18] is to the beat of a different drum,
[46:21] &gt;&gt; to a to a symphony that it's playing a
[46:24] different melody, a different harmony, a
[46:26] different rhythm. And and and Brother
[46:28] Brandham talks about that so much that
[46:31] that, you know, you've got to start with
[46:33] the composer. He composed music that he
[46:37] once played. Your listen, your life is a
[46:40] life song.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; That song's not just a song. That's a
[46:47] That's a true teaching. See? All right.
[46:52] So, let's look at Ephesians 5:1-17.
[46:56] Be therefore followers of God as dear
[47:01] children, and walk in love as Christ
[47:05] also hath loved us. Now, how did he love
[47:08] us? How is it that you're supposed to
[47:10] walk like he did? He did always that
[47:13] which pleased the father. He said, "It's
[47:15] written of in of me in the scrolls
[47:18] concerning me. uh in sacrifices and
[47:21] offerings thou hast no pleasure, but a
[47:23] body thou hast prepared me. It's written
[47:26] about me. It's written concerning me in
[47:28] the scrolls. I here's my declaration. I
[47:31] have come to do thy will, oh God.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; So, first of all, if we're going to walk
[47:38] in the same love toward God that Jesus
[47:40] did, then you need to admit today, I
[47:43] don't own my life.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; It was purchased. That's right.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, let's carry on. Walk in
[47:52] love as Christ also hath loved us and
[47:56] hath given himself for us an offering
[47:59] and a sacrifice to God for a sweet
[48:02] smelling savor. So, his life was a sweet
[48:04] smelling savor. It was an offering. See,
[48:07] it's a worship. Verse three. Now, watch.
[48:09] You can get right to the nitty-gritty,
[48:11] right to the where the rubber meets the
[48:13] road. But fornication and all
[48:17] uncleanness or covetousness, let it not
[48:21] be once named among you as becometh
[48:24] saints.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Neither filthiness nor foolish talking
[48:27] nor justesting, which are not
[48:30] convenient, but rather giving of thanks.
[48:32] There is there is one of the leading
[48:36] money making forms of entertainment is
[48:39] vulgaresting.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. They they have late shows
[48:43] that millions of people watch. They
[48:45] YouTube and Facebook are full of reals
[48:48] where people are making vulgar comedy.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; See,
[48:53] &gt;&gt; it's not it's not about, you know,
[48:55] Jesus, you know, said that old fox. It's
[48:57] not Jesus had a sense of humor. It's not
[48:59] don't ever tell something funny or
[49:01] something like a joke or you play
[49:03] something on somebody. I was just I was
[49:05] in the car yesterday with Travis and and
[49:07] my and Nathaniel calls brother Travis
[49:10] and I saw it was Nathaniel and I
[49:11] answered I said, "Hey bud, how's it
[49:13] going?" He said, and I could hear the
[49:15] confusion in his voice. Said, "Yeah,
[49:17] it's brother Jason. What what's up?
[49:19] Why'd you call me?" Uh,
[49:22] and then I I let him off easy. He was,
[49:24] "Man, this is so weird. I thought I was"
[49:27] And so he was he he he had the right
[49:29] person, but I was playing a gag on him.
[49:32] But one of the leading things that we
[49:34] have today, one of the most quickest
[49:36] ways to make money is be vulgar and
[49:39] funny.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; See? Right.
[49:43] So for this you know
[49:47] are neither filthiness nor foolish
[49:49] talking nor justesting which are not
[49:51] convenient but rather giving of thanks.
[49:54] For this you know in other words your
[49:56] life should be a thanksgiving to God.
[49:58] for this. You know that no whoreonger
[50:01] nor unclean person I I wish that at some
[50:05] of these Hollywood funerals they would
[50:08] read this verse
[50:10] &gt;&gt; because it doesn't seem to matter how
[50:12] vulgar, how low class, how low down, how
[50:15] filthy, how nasty that the entertainer
[50:18] who has now died suddenly they died on a
[50:21] drug overdose or they died and passed
[50:24] out and drowned or or they died in a
[50:26] gang fight or whatever and somehow Now
[50:28] everybody says, "Oh, they're up there
[50:30] looking down." That's not true.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; They're if if they're looking at all,
[50:36] they're down there looking up screaming.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; See,
[50:41] &gt;&gt; for this for this you know that no
[50:44] hormonger nor unclean person, nor
[50:48] covetous man who is an idoltor hath any
[50:52] inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and
[50:54] of God. Let no man deceive you. Don't
[50:58] let this this deceitful age deceive you.
[51:02] Let no man deceive you with vain words.
[51:04] For because of these things cometh the
[51:07] wrath of God upon the children of
[51:09] disobedience. They wonder why God is
[51:12] going to let the tribulation come. And
[51:15] they actually try to turn blame back on
[51:17] God.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; See,
[51:21] &gt;&gt; be ye not therefore partakers with them?
[51:25] Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Choice is yours. But if you're going to
[51:29] be a Christian, don't be a partaker with
[51:32] the ungodliness of this world. For ye
[51:35] were sometimes darkness. This is before
[51:37] you were born again. But now are you
[51:41] light in the Lord. Here's a good piece
[51:43] of advice. Walk as children of the
[51:47] light. Are you born again of the spirit
[51:48] of God? Then walk like that. See,
[51:52] for the fruit of the spirit is in all
[51:54] goodness and righteousness
[51:58] and truth, proving, see, the life we
[52:01] live, proving what is acceptable unto
[52:04] the Lord, and have no fellowship with
[52:08] the un the unfruitful works of darkness,
[52:14] with the unfruitful works of darkness,
[52:17] but rather let your life testify against
[52:20] it.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Not you get out on the street holding up
[52:23] signs, you know, telling people, you
[52:25] know, you're you're repent or go to
[52:27] hell, you know, um and and I'm not
[52:30] against fire and brimstone preaching,
[52:32] and that's uh shocked to plenty of
[52:34] people, but what good would it do me to
[52:36] get on the street corner and yell that
[52:38] out if when I walk away, my life doesn't
[52:40] agree with my sermon?
[52:43] See,
[52:45] so for it is a shame even to speak of
[52:49] those things which are done of them in
[52:51] secret, but all things that are reproved
[52:54] are made manifest by the light. For
[52:57] whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
[53:01] Wherefore he saith, awake thou that
[53:04] sleepest, and arise from the dead, and
[53:07] Christ shall give thee light.
[53:09] See then that you walk circumspectly,
[53:13] not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the
[53:18] time, because the days are evil.
[53:22] Wherefore be you not unwise, but
[53:24] understanding what the will of the Lord
[53:28] is.
[53:30] You know, there's a there's a great
[53:32] movement today for what is termed by the
[53:36] movers and shakers of society, the the
[53:39] we're you know, we're talking about the
[53:41] super rich, the billionaires. Uh, and
[53:44] you know, I I I I have a podcast that I
[53:47] listen to that's all MIT grads and
[53:50] sometime some of them are double and
[53:51] triple majors in science and math and
[53:54] and business and different things like
[53:56] that. And I do it just to just to stay
[53:57] on the cutting edge of technology uh and
[54:00] and what's moving. And I constantly hear
[54:03] them talking about we're headed toward
[54:07] super abundance. And they've titled
[54:08] that. They've labeled it like that where
[54:10] we're literally coming to where we can
[54:12] we can solve the problem of everything.
[54:15] We can solve every problem. We can
[54:17] answer every question. We're going to
[54:19] get to the point where there will be no
[54:21] need for a monetary system. There will
[54:23] be nobody in want, nobody in need.
[54:25] everything will everybody will have
[54:26] it'll be super abundance and and you
[54:30] know and and and I and I realize that
[54:32] that there have been I I I realize like
[54:35] brother Brandham said they're trying to
[54:37] build a false millennium
[54:40] &gt;&gt; because the element that they're leaving
[54:42] out is the fallen nature of a fallen man
[54:46] and power apart from character is
[54:49] satanic.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not like there hasn't been
[54:53] super abundance down through history,
[54:56] societal abundance. I mean, you know,
[54:58] the the the Moguls taking over India, uh
[55:01] the Romans taking over Europe and uh but
[55:05] you always ended up in B and this is
[55:07] their own testimony, but you basically
[55:08] ended up uh you know in four activities
[55:11] that human beings do whenever you get to
[55:15] complete control and super abundance,
[55:17] which is food, art, music and sex. not
[55:21] necessarily in that same order,
[55:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:24] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't matter what empire ever
[55:26] rose up and had super abundance, it all
[55:30] they they couldn't answer the sin
[55:32] question and the whole thing imploded
[55:34] because of filth and vulgarity.
[55:41] I want to make a statement to you today,
[55:43] and you're going to have to give me some
[55:45] time to explain it because it's going to
[55:47] sound bizarre.
[55:50] Satan is not my greatest enemy.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; I am
[55:58] &gt;&gt; my greatest enemy.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Satan is a fallen angel.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; He is no threat to me. That's right.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; You see,
[56:10] brother Brandham said, "A demon spirit
[56:14] is almost powerless unless he can get
[56:17] someone to work through."
[56:20] &gt;&gt; You see, so he's already been stripped
[56:23] of his power. And the Bible says, and we
[56:26] didn't read it, we could go on down in
[56:27] our in our text from Isaiah, the world
[56:30] will narrowly look upon him
[56:34] &gt;&gt; and they'll be shocked that they ended
[56:37] up and the whole world imploded upon
[56:40] itself and destroyed itself all because
[56:42] of this one person.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; See, and he's a person.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; They'll even say, "Is this the man?"
[56:49] Now, he's not a man. He's a fallen
[56:51] angel. But but when they realize that
[56:53] he's actually a person, brother Brandham
[56:55] said, "People say the devil's not real."
[56:56] He said, "Don't you believe that he's
[56:59] very much real. He's very much active.
[57:01] And he has a vision and he has a counter
[57:04] claim for how he sees it ending up. I
[57:07] don't want to end up in his in his world
[57:11] because every time I've ever seen men
[57:14] who were under his control rise up with
[57:17] control, it went bad for the people."
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[57:21] So, he's a fallen angel. He's already
[57:24] been stripped of power. The world will
[57:27] narrowly look upon him. So, he's not a
[57:29] threat. I am.
[57:32] You are the threat.
[57:36] I am the son of God. I'm the one made in
[57:40] his image to be an amateur god.
[57:45] I'm the one in the image of God with a
[57:49] living soul and free moral agency. I'm
[57:53] the one that I should fear and be
[57:56] careful to keep very close to the Lord.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, I'm afraid of this person. I'm
[58:04] afraid of the devil." You need to take a
[58:07] look at that man in the mirror. That's
[58:09] the person that can hurt you.
[58:11] That's the one I I I'm not going to be
[58:14] able to control the devil, but I can
[58:17] control his access to me.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; I'm the son of God. I'm the one supposed
[58:22] to be an amateur god. I'm the one that I
[58:24] and not all of me is converted.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Only a third of me.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; The other two parts of me, body and
[58:33] spirit, are not converted. I still have
[58:35] to keep my memory, affection, reason,
[58:38] conscience, imagination. That's a bad
[58:40] one.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; I have to watch what I look at, listen
[58:44] to, touch, taste, go, have, hold.
[58:48] See, that that's that's where Satan is
[58:51] trying to get access to. That's the one.
[58:53] It's those it's those other two parts of
[58:56] me that I need to be fearful enough to
[59:00] be very careful to keep him close to the
[59:04] Lord.
[59:08] because not all of me is converted
[59:11] yet.
[59:14] Only my soul is in heavenly places with
[59:16] Christ Jesus. Now, now that's quite a
[59:19] that's quite a lot and it's certainly
[59:21] the main part. Amen. But it's not all.
[59:25] So this is this is where you know
[59:27] brother Brandham would teach us that
[59:30] when you take a stand on the word of God
[59:33] that's when you go that's when you do
[59:35] when you as brother Brandham um coined
[59:38] it I you know you grow faith muscles you
[59:41] remember he tells the story of the man
[59:43] and the devil big devil come and the
[59:45] devil said boo and the man jumped back
[59:46] and he got little and the devil got
[59:48] bigger and the devil just walked him
[59:50] across the floor he got littleer smaller
[59:52] and smaller and smaller every time the
[59:54] devil jumped until finally when he had
[59:56] nowhere else to turn, he just said, "Boo
[59:57] back." And when he did, the devil got
[59:59] small. He grew. And then he did it
[1:00:01] again. And he did it again. And he did
[1:00:03] it again till finally he booed the devil
[1:00:05] out of existence. That's what I want to
[1:00:08] do, friends. I I want to have this man
[1:00:10] under the subjection of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:12] so that I'm not afraid of the devil.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham talks about in
[1:00:18] certain places that it's when the son or
[1:00:20] son and daughter of God, that born again
[1:00:24] person that's part of God's godhead,
[1:00:26] that's the one that walks down the
[1:00:28] street and demons that see him coming or
[1:00:30] her coming howl and faint.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; See, so when I take a stand, I grow
[1:00:39] faith muscles. I become large and Satan
[1:00:42] becomes small. So, but in other words,
[1:00:44] let me say it like this. Christ
[1:00:47] the word, Christ is his word. Christ the
[1:00:50] word is what becomes large and brings
[1:00:54] what? What's getting smaller? What's
[1:00:56] what's being put under control? My
[1:00:58] fallen parts.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; My fallen nature. And that's being put
[1:01:04] under. Please pay attention to me. Don't
[1:01:06] be sleeping. I've spent many hours
[1:01:08] studying this. Don't be distracted.
[1:01:11] Please pay attention. Amen.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:01:16] It's when it's when it's when his word
[1:01:18] becomes large because I allow it to
[1:01:21] become large.
[1:01:23] And when that happens, then that brings
[1:01:26] my fallen nature in subjection to the
[1:01:29] word of God. Trust me, your young people
[1:01:32] need to hear what I'm preaching today.
[1:01:37] My soul, my soul lives in perfect faith
[1:01:42] to God's word every minute of every hour
[1:01:45] of every day. That's that's a done deal.
[1:01:48] That's that's not in question. That's
[1:01:50] not what we're talking about. That's in
[1:01:52] fact that's what the new birth seals
[1:01:54] into me. Says you're sealed until the
[1:01:56] day of your redemption. That's what's
[1:01:58] sealed into me. a perfect faith in the
[1:02:00] revealed word and a true worship to the
[1:02:05] true God.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; John Jesus said in John 4, "But the hour
[1:02:11] cometh, and now is when the true
[1:02:14] worshippers shall worship the father in
[1:02:17] spirit and in truth. For the father
[1:02:19] seeketh such to worship him." God is a
[1:02:22] spirit. Catch it. And they that worship
[1:02:25] him must worship him in spirit and in
[1:02:29] truth.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:02:36] so we're studying, you know, we're
[1:02:39] studying today
[1:02:41] about this fallen being, this one called
[1:02:44] Lucifer, who started out as an archangel
[1:02:46] who started at the right hand of the
[1:02:48] throne. I don't have time to go in that
[1:02:50] today. That's for another installment.
[1:02:53] Oh, and and and and but but we're but
[1:02:55] we're studying today about a being a
[1:03:00] being who's very real and who is vying
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; for your worship.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; He's fighting God over your worship.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; He's trying to file a competing claim
[1:03:15] against the claim of the Holy Ghost that
[1:03:18] lives in you. The Holy Ghost that lives
[1:03:20] in me says I believe God. Satan is
[1:03:23] filing a competing claim. Said, "Oh, if
[1:03:26] I can just get you to do this and I can
[1:03:27] get you to do that, then I will
[1:03:29] invalidate your claim."
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; And the world
[1:03:36] because you claim you're a Christian.
[1:03:38] You claim you got the baptism of the
[1:03:40] Holy Ghost. But if I can affect the
[1:03:42] other two guys that make you up, then I
[1:03:45] can get the world to doubt what the
[1:03:48] promise of the word is cuz they see that
[1:03:51] you're not what it said you would be.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Is this all right?
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; So the unconverted parts of me are the
[1:04:03] ones that are vulnerable to him. What
[1:04:06] kind of worship
[1:04:08] is my life?
[1:04:12] Brother Ben Brandham said it like this
[1:04:13] in his homespun way. You're somebody's
[1:04:16] fool.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; You're either a fool for Christ or
[1:04:19] you're a fool for the devil.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; But that was that was his last closing
[1:04:24] sermon. His last full text sermon was
[1:04:26] leadership in Kabina. He preached
[1:04:28] communion there uh in Tucson. But but
[1:04:32] that was just a short communion service.
[1:04:34] But his last text sermon was leadership.
[1:04:36] Who's leading you now? Cuz somebody
[1:04:38] always has been and somebody is right
[1:04:40] now.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; So, it's the it's the greatest battle
[1:04:47] ever fought. And I'm I'm just I I'm here
[1:04:51] to tell you something, friends. We're
[1:04:52] all in this thing together. And I know
[1:04:54] you'll rejoice with me. I I realize this
[1:04:57] my my body and my spirit are not
[1:04:59] converted. I'm just glad I got a
[1:05:01] competing voice down on the inside of
[1:05:03] the inside
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; that desires every day when my feet when
[1:05:08] my unconverted feet hit the floor,
[1:05:10] there's a man inside on the deep inside
[1:05:12] saying, "Walk in the grace of God
[1:05:14] today." Every time my eyes or my ears or
[1:05:17] Satan tries to pull this or that way,
[1:05:19] there's a voice down on the inside and
[1:05:20] says, "Uh, live in subjection to the
[1:05:22] Holy Spirit. Bring every thought captive
[1:05:25] to the Holy Ghost." Amen.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; But it's up to me whether I'll do it or
[1:05:30] not.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; It's the greatest battle ever fought.
[1:05:36] The part of me that exercises faith to
[1:05:38] stand on the word when everything is in
[1:05:42] peril or threat or temptation. I want
[1:05:46] you to know today, I want to leave you
[1:05:48] encouraged, not discouraged. I want you
[1:05:51] to know that Satan can't force you to do
[1:05:53] these things. You have the Holy Ghost
[1:05:56] and you have the power and you have the
[1:05:59] ability. No matter when everything is in
[1:06:01] peril or everything might seem like a
[1:06:03] threat or there might be temptations all
[1:06:05] around you, you can be an overcomer.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Real power, friends, hear me now. Real
[1:06:12] power is not conquering Satan.
[1:06:16] Jesus already did that.
[1:06:19] Amen.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Real power
[1:06:23] is conquering myself.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; To stop allowing Satan refuge
[1:06:33] from God's delivering power because I
[1:06:36] worship it and won't let it go.
[1:06:40] when the maniac jumped on the platform
[1:06:42] there to to to knock brother Brandham
[1:06:45] out into the audience and brother
[1:06:46] Brandham said he was well able to do it
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; and when the security detail and the
[1:06:52] police rushed to get him brother
[1:06:54] Brandham waved him off because he he
[1:06:56] just knew and this man you know this man
[1:07:00] is just coming and brother Brandham said
[1:07:01] he said I'll break every bone in your
[1:07:03] body and he and he said you know I I
[1:07:07] turned and I and I said because you have
[1:07:10] challenged the servant of the most high
[1:07:12] God, you'll fall at my feet." And
[1:07:14] brother Brandham said, he said, "I'll
[1:07:15] show you." He said, "He spit in my
[1:07:17] face." That's a thing now. It wasn't It
[1:07:20] was terrible back then. He said, "He
[1:07:22] spit in my face." And he said, "Uh, it's
[1:07:25] terrible anytime, but he said he did
[1:07:27] that to to break my concentration."
[1:07:30] But the devil caused him to do that.
[1:07:32] See, a lot of times you can be sitting
[1:07:34] right here in the house of God and Satan
[1:07:36] will do something and break your
[1:07:38] concentration.
[1:07:39] I mean it it can be anything for this
[1:07:41] this is why we have church order. This
[1:07:43] is why we don't allow a lot of commotion
[1:07:46] where the Holy Spirit is very timid.
[1:07:48] Even even even a even a a child crossing
[1:07:52] from one side to the other can distract
[1:07:54] somebody and break the concentration of
[1:07:56] the Holy Spirit.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; So this is why we have deacons and order
[1:08:00] and nursery for crying babies. That's
[1:08:02] part of nature. Nothing you can do about
[1:08:03] that. But we have ways uh to remedy
[1:08:06] that. We don't have a lot of commotion
[1:08:08] or talking when we come in here in the
[1:08:10] pre-ervice.
[1:08:14] So,
[1:08:19] so brother Brandham said he spit in my
[1:08:22] face and he said, "I'll show you whose
[1:08:26] feet I'll fall at." And brother Brandham
[1:08:28] said, "Come out of him, Satan."
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; And the man spun around, whirled around.
[1:08:35] His eyes rolled back. He spun around and
[1:08:37] collapsed and fell over brother
[1:08:39] Brandham's feet. And Bill, brother Billy
[1:08:43] Paul told later said that the policeman
[1:08:46] walked up and said, "Is he dead?" And
[1:08:49] brother Brandham said, "No."
[1:08:52] And he said, "Is he delivered?" And he
[1:08:55] said, "No, he worships that spirit and
[1:08:59] he won't let it go."
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; This is for real.
[1:09:05] There's a realm, friends, a world that
[1:09:08] you don't even realize going on in in
[1:09:10] realms you can't see. Angels moving,
[1:09:12] evil spirits moving. Sometimes, Brother
[1:09:14] Brandham said, "If he ever takes his
[1:09:16] hand away from me, Satan would slay me
[1:09:17] in a second." I'm here to tell you, you
[1:09:19] arrived here today by the grace of God.
[1:09:21] You're hearing the word by the grace of
[1:09:22] God. You'll leave here and be given an
[1:09:24] opportunity to go live it by the grace
[1:09:26] of God. Amen.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; So a lot of times
[1:09:33] we have to make the decision
[1:09:36] to allow
[1:09:38] to stop, let me say it that way, we have
[1:09:40] to decide to stop allowing Satan refuge
[1:09:45] from God's deliverance. Because if if
[1:09:47] you don't want to let it go, a prophet
[1:09:51] said, then Satan has a divine right to
[1:09:55] stay right there. And even the Holy
[1:09:57] Spirit will not command him to leave
[1:10:00] because you are the free moral agent.
[1:10:03] You're the image of God. You've made a
[1:10:05] decision. I love it. I enjoy it. I'm not
[1:10:07] going to give it up. And I could pour a
[1:10:09] gallon of oil and every minister here
[1:10:11] could pray for you. And the Holy Spirit
[1:10:13] could come down to deliver you and you'd
[1:10:15] leave here bound
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; because you will not make the decision
[1:10:20] to become free. I'm here to decide
[1:10:22] today. I want to be completely free of
[1:10:25] every obstacle, anything that could keep
[1:10:28] my life from being a testimony of true
[1:10:31] worship to the world.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Satan has a God-given right to stay
[1:10:38] there. And God's word can't be taken
[1:10:41] back. See, just it's it's the same thing
[1:10:43] you see in Romans 7 where Paul says, you
[1:10:46] know, the the law was not bad. The
[1:10:49] problem wasn't the law. The problem was
[1:10:51] with me that in my flesh I couldn't keep
[1:10:54] the law perfectly.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; See, because Paul hadn't been born
[1:10:57] again. And so he says, so Satan, he he
[1:11:01] says it like this. Satan took advantage.
[1:11:03] Don't think Satan you we're talking
[1:11:04] about claims and counter claims. Don't
[1:11:07] think he's not very savvy on
[1:11:09] manipulating the word of God, which was
[1:11:12] for your good to be for your your doom.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. The same word that'll give you
[1:11:18] eternal life is the same word that will
[1:11:19] judge you.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; And so, so Paul said, I I I he took
[1:11:27] advantage of the word and the the law
[1:11:29] which was actually sent for my life
[1:11:32] ended up being for my death. He says,
[1:11:35] "So, was that which was good made evil?"
[1:11:38] No, the law's not evil. The problem was
[1:11:40] me and Satan knew that. And so, he took
[1:11:43] advantage of it. You can't keep the law.
[1:11:46] So you're condemned. And that was that
[1:11:48] and that held up.
[1:11:50] That held up in God's court.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; That's exactly why paradise every
[1:11:56] doesn't matter what prophet, priest or
[1:11:58] king they were, how righteous they were.
[1:12:01] Joseph, Moses, Abraham, David, Isaiah,
[1:12:05] Ezekiel, all of them without fail could
[1:12:08] not go into the presence of God when
[1:12:10] they died. They didn't go up. They went
[1:12:12] down
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; into the lower parts of the earth. And
[1:12:15] God had a paradise divided off with a
[1:12:18] gulf fixed in between. And in this side
[1:12:20] you had hell and in this side you had a
[1:12:22] paradise.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; And then you say, "Well, they couldn't
[1:12:26] go back and forth." Good. That's great.
[1:12:28] But neither could they escape. That's
[1:12:30] why on resurrection morning that the
[1:12:32] graves of them which slept arose and
[1:12:34] went with the Lord to meet to go into
[1:12:36] the air because he that ascended first
[1:12:39] descended into the lower parts of the
[1:12:41] earth and led captivity captive. I want
[1:12:45] to be captured by him today. I want to
[1:12:48] be his captive. I don't want to be
[1:12:49] Satan's captive anymore.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; So, so you know, Paul's showing that
[1:12:57] this is this is what Satan has done.
[1:12:58] He's taken advantage of of God's word
[1:13:01] and and and and of course, God couldn't
[1:13:03] change his word. He can't do that. Uh
[1:13:06] and so so so what does Paul do?
[1:13:10] Paul is showing the church it was
[1:13:13] hopeless for me to be able to fix it.
[1:13:16] There was nothing I could do it uh do
[1:13:19] about it and and and God can't change
[1:13:22] his word. And so he came and he
[1:13:25] satisfied the requirement himself and
[1:13:29] suffered the penalty of his own word of
[1:13:32] judgment on my behalf or in mystead. I
[1:13:36] love how brother Dale says it. He didn't
[1:13:38] just die for me. He died instead of me.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; God traded the innocent for the guilty.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; What love is this?
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; so this is then the only way. I mean, if
[1:13:55] you think about it, that's the only way
[1:13:56] free moral agency even has legitimacy.
[1:14:00] He could not, as brother Brandham said,
[1:14:02] to be an overcomer.
[1:14:05] He said, "He cannot push me through a
[1:14:07] pipe and hold me up as a great
[1:14:08] overcomer." Meaning like a mold, like a
[1:14:11] cast. You know, you can you have a die
[1:14:13] cast. You pour it full and you close it.
[1:14:15] You wait for it to dry and you pull it
[1:14:16] out. And this is an overcomer diecast.
[1:14:18] And when I pour when I get poured in, I
[1:14:20] come out. No. Or I get pushed through a
[1:14:22] forming pipe that forms me into a shape.
[1:14:26] Mechanics use that, you know, and
[1:14:27] different things. But he said, "That's
[1:14:29] not that's not an overcomer. I if I'm
[1:14:32] going to overcome then I am given the
[1:14:35] choice to either grant Satan refuge or
[1:14:39] accept God's deliverance. That is me
[1:14:42] today. That is you today. You can either
[1:14:46] uh allow Satan refuge to keep
[1:14:48] influencing you and he'll keep tripping
[1:14:51] you and he'll keep stumbling you and
[1:14:53] that weakness and that besetting sin
[1:14:55] will keep knocking you out and knocking
[1:14:56] you out and knocking you out all the way
[1:14:58] till it's time to go home. I want to be
[1:15:01] free of it. I want to live in the full
[1:15:03] liberty of the Holy Ghost. I want my
[1:15:06] life to be a true worship.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; I'm given that choice
[1:15:13] to either grant Satan continued space
[1:15:16] that he's not entitled to within me or
[1:15:19] accept God's deliverance.
[1:15:23] born in sin.
[1:15:25] God knowing that a fallen mortal could
[1:15:28] not choose him, God offers him grace.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; See, so you're saved by grace through
[1:15:36] faith. See? And so, so it's grace
[1:15:39] through faith. So, so the Holy Spirit
[1:15:42] doesn't just give you the grace of
[1:15:45] revealing himself to you, but he
[1:15:48] actually gives you the faith to believe
[1:15:50] it. So, you're saved by grace through
[1:15:53] faith, and it all comes from him.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; When the fallen man receives that
[1:16:00] revelation of Jesus Christ into his
[1:16:03] heart, then here's the beauty of it.
[1:16:06] When that happens, you're talking about
[1:16:07] a supernatural thing. It's supernatural
[1:16:10] cuz it's not natural.
[1:16:12] It's not something you could have done.
[1:16:14] The human mind, the fallen mind is
[1:16:16] enmity against God. Could never agree
[1:16:17] with God. You were born on your road to
[1:16:20] hell and no way to stop it. It's the
[1:16:22] grace of God that came to you and
[1:16:24] revealed himself to you and then gave
[1:16:26] you not only the word to believe, but
[1:16:28] the faith to believe it. And it's not
[1:16:29] just believe it intellectually. He's
[1:16:31] given you the Holy Ghost so you can live
[1:16:33] it. So you can be it.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; See, so when that happens, then God
[1:16:40] credits that believer with the perfect
[1:16:43] with the perfect life that Jesus lived.
[1:16:46] Not just at that moment when you repent,
[1:16:48] but but but for all moments going
[1:16:51] forward all the way to the coming of the
[1:16:53] Lord. If I do sin, I have an advocate
[1:16:56] constantly with the father that that the
[1:16:58] blood speaks for me constantly.
[1:17:01] Hallelujah. I'm so glad for that
[1:17:02] atonement in Christ.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; We find that when that happens, then no
[1:17:08] failure can be charged against the
[1:17:11] redeemed man. He's already perfected in
[1:17:14] Christ. He's not becoming perfect. He is
[1:17:18] perfect.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; In the mind of God.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; This is exactly what we see in the Old
[1:17:26] Testament shadow in Abraham. The Bible
[1:17:28] said Abraham believed God's word and God
[1:17:32] counted it to him. God accredited his
[1:17:34] account with righteousness that Abraham
[1:17:37] had never lived.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; You see, Abraham had times where he
[1:17:41] stumbled. He never doubted. He never
[1:17:43] staggered at the promise of God. But he
[1:17:45] staggered in his flesh. David staggered
[1:17:47] in his flesh. Moses staggered in his
[1:17:49] flesh. Elijah was a man of like
[1:17:50] passions. Brother Brandon said that many
[1:17:52] had his ups and downs. But I'm here to
[1:17:55] tell you something, friends. That day on
[1:17:56] Calvary changed it all. Hallelujah. And
[1:17:59] today, you can rise above this sin
[1:18:01] cursed world. You do not have to live in
[1:18:03] the bondage of repetitive sin and
[1:18:06] failure. You're making a choice to do
[1:18:08] that. And I'm here to tell you, Satan
[1:18:09] can't force you to do that.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; You are free in Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Numbers 22,
[1:18:24] Kev, your Sarah. Numbers 22
[1:18:29] is the story of King Bailo of Moab
[1:18:33] going out to hire a a false prophet.
[1:18:37] Now, he was a real prophet because you
[1:18:38] can be a real prophet but not be a true
[1:18:41] prophet,
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; right? Amen. So, Balam is the best
[1:18:44] example of that. He was a true prophet
[1:18:47] from birth, but he I mean he was a real
[1:18:48] one. He was a real actual prophet, but
[1:18:51] he didn't remain as a true prophet of
[1:18:53] God because he sold out his gift for
[1:18:56] gain. See, and he and he adulterated the
[1:19:00] word of God. He God forced him to bless
[1:19:03] Israel anyway. But then when he couldn't
[1:19:05] curse Israel, he went around behind the
[1:19:07] scenes and whispered into Bailo's ear
[1:19:09] and said, "Listen,
[1:19:11] you don't need me to curse them. You,
[1:19:13] they can curse themselves. God will
[1:19:15] curse them. All you got to do is get
[1:19:16] them to transgress." See, well, how do I
[1:19:19] do about that? Throw a big feast and
[1:19:21] invite them. And it was called the feast
[1:19:22] of Bale Pure. And when you get here,
[1:19:25] let's just have a big party. And oh,
[1:19:27] they're believers. But they're
[1:19:28] believers. Oh, it's okay. If we can get
[1:19:30] them to come to the party, that's just
[1:19:32] phase one. And then we can get them to
[1:19:35] sit down, phase two. And then we can
[1:19:36] tell them a few jokes, phase three. And
[1:19:38] then we can kind of begin to serve food
[1:19:41] and a little bit of wine and maybe a
[1:19:42] little bit more wine. And the next thing
[1:19:44] you know, we get them a little tipsy.
[1:19:45] And the next thing you know, our women
[1:19:46] start uh acting in a lewd way and and
[1:19:49] the men get all inflamed over watching
[1:19:51] it. And the next thing you know, you'll
[1:19:53] even have their princes taking
[1:19:54] prostitutes back all trying to take them
[1:19:57] back to to the camp of Israel.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; It is shocking to me what people who are
[1:20:03] supposed to be Christians and believers
[1:20:05] actually come to the house of God and
[1:20:06] hear the word and even wave and praise
[1:20:08] the Lord and and allow ungodliness to
[1:20:11] exist in their lives.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; We're all in this together. Yes.
[1:20:21] Amen.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; 30 years. You've heard me say that we're
[1:20:27] all in this together. This isn't big I
[1:20:30] and little you.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Numbers 22. So,
[1:20:38] we'll catch it. I'll give you the verse
[1:20:39] in a second, Kev.
[1:20:42] So, Balum Balo comes. He sends some
[1:20:44] princes to to Balum. says, "Go take some
[1:20:48] money and some gifts and tell him, I
[1:20:50] need him to come see me. I need to curse
[1:20:52] these people."
[1:20:54] Verse seven,
[1:20:56] "And the elders of Moab and the elders
[1:20:58] of Midian departed with the rewards of
[1:21:00] divination in their hand. And they came
[1:21:03] to Balam and spoke unto him the words of
[1:21:06] Bao." That was the king. And he said
[1:21:09] unto them, Ba Balam said this to these
[1:21:13] men, lodge here this night, and I will
[1:21:16] bring you word again, as the Lord shall
[1:21:18] speak unto me, and the princes of Moab
[1:21:22] abode with Balum. And God came unto
[1:21:26] Balam. Doesn't even say Balum prayed or
[1:21:30] Balam went to church or Balam built an
[1:21:32] altar. Balam sacrificed. It just simply
[1:21:36] says he allowed these people,
[1:21:39] these Moabites to sleep in his house to
[1:21:43] come in. He opened the door, invited
[1:21:46] them in, and they came in. And verse
[1:21:48] nine, and God came unto Balam and said,
[1:21:51] "What men are these with thee?" as if
[1:21:55] God didn't know.
[1:21:58] Is it funny when God asked a question,
[1:21:59] you're like, "Really?
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; You're asking me a question? Remember
[1:22:05] friends, it ain't that God needs to
[1:22:07] know. It's that you need to know.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; You need to answer the question.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Balam, God already knew who these men
[1:22:15] were. God already knew the nefarious
[1:22:17] plot that they were planning. And he
[1:22:20] says he wants Balam to come to terms
[1:22:22] with it. What men are these with thee?
[1:22:27] You know, they were there to offer him
[1:22:30] fortune and glory. They actually he
[1:22:32] rejects them the first time. They he
[1:22:33] sends even higher princes. You can take
[1:22:35] that down, Kev. Higher people with even
[1:22:38] more gifts. And Balam does the same
[1:22:40] thing again. Invites them in. Come on
[1:22:41] in. Spend the night. Uh Matthew Henry
[1:22:45] com in his commentary he says it's easy.
[1:22:49] It is easy for us to say, "Come see our
[1:22:52] zeal for the Lord." And to think we are
[1:22:56] very faithful in his cause when we are
[1:22:59] seeking our own objects and even doing
[1:23:02] harm instead of good to others.
[1:23:06] We have all kinds of things that
[1:23:08] ventures that we do and say, "Oh, I'm
[1:23:10] going to go serve the Lord in this." And
[1:23:13] the whole time it's a trap of the devil
[1:23:16] to lure you into a less than fruitful
[1:23:20] lifestyle that doesn't truly represent
[1:23:23] uh almighty God. See, and that and and
[1:23:26] and listen, that goes beyond those
[1:23:28] doors. You come here out of respect. You
[1:23:31] dress decently morally, men and women.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; You speak decently. You speak morally.
[1:23:37] You act decently. You act morally
[1:23:38] because if you don't, the deacons will
[1:23:40] excuse you. And we've had to do that
[1:23:42] before.
[1:23:43] And and but what about when you go
[1:23:45] beyond those doors? You're still a
[1:23:47] Christian, aren't you? You're still a
[1:23:49] believer,
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; aren't you?
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Does your testimony change in your place
[1:23:55] of business or out recreationally or
[1:23:57] when you're shopping in the market or
[1:23:59] when you're on a ball team, is your
[1:24:01] testimony different? That should not be.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:24:07] See, and you you testify we're going to
[1:24:09] do good for God and actually you're
[1:24:11] harming them.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:24:16] here's what I want you to catch. Now,
[1:24:18] I'm going to give you another quick
[1:24:19] turn. I'm going to run for the finish
[1:24:21] line.
[1:24:25] Satan wanted in on Balam's worship.
[1:24:31] It's what that's what the whole ploy is
[1:24:33] about. Satan wanted in on it. He knew
[1:24:36] there was going to be a worship. The
[1:24:37] king had already said, "I want you to
[1:24:39] ble curse them." So now you're going to
[1:24:41] have to get get an altar. You're gonna
[1:24:42] have to build it. Seven altars. You're
[1:24:43] going to have to have seven lambs.
[1:24:44] You're going to have to offer to
[1:24:45] Jehovah. And Balam wasn't offering to
[1:24:47] false gods. He was offering to Jehovah.
[1:24:50] He was supposed to be a a kind of like a
[1:24:52] believer. See, we got the world full of
[1:24:55] today kind of like Christians.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; And they meet in churches and they sing
[1:24:59] songs and they're very sincere. Those
[1:25:00] tears aren't crocodile. Many of those
[1:25:02] tears are real. But Jesus said the day
[1:25:05] is coming and now is. And I'm here to
[1:25:07] tell you and it is right now when the
[1:25:09] worshippers must worship in spirit and
[1:25:11] in truth. The the church age God is done
[1:25:14] dealing with the age of the church. This
[1:25:16] is a time of the bride to become the
[1:25:19] full word to be married to the son of
[1:25:21] God to take a flight in the skies.
[1:25:23] That's never happened in the 2,000 years
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; of the church.
[1:25:29] It could have happened in the first age,
[1:25:30] but the seed had to go into the ground
[1:25:32] and they backslid. See, so Satan wanted
[1:25:36] in on Balum's worship service. Can I say
[1:25:39] it to you in in in no uncertain terms?
[1:25:42] Satan wants in on your worship service.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; This guy, he wants in on that.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; He wants to have a say. He wants to have
[1:25:52] an influence in how your life is a life
[1:25:56] song
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; of true worship to God. Satan desires
[1:26:01] this in our lives and and in our daily
[1:26:04] service and our worship to the true God.
[1:26:06] First Peter, give me that, brother
[1:26:08] Kevin. 1 Peter uh chapter 2 verse 5. 1
[1:26:13] Peter 2 and five. I want you to read it
[1:26:15] with me.
[1:26:17] Ye also,
[1:26:19] as lively stones,
[1:26:23] are built up a spiritual house and holy
[1:26:27] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:26:30] sacrifices acceptable to God uh by Jesus
[1:26:35] Christ. So as in the very true story of
[1:26:40] Balum, then then we need to think about
[1:26:42] things that that we bring into our house
[1:26:46] of lively stones.
[1:26:50] You're you're as lively stones, you're a
[1:26:54] spiritual house. See? And so I think
[1:26:57] that God could ask us,
[1:27:01] and I maybe I should say all too often,
[1:27:07] God could ask us very legitimately and
[1:27:10] sadly all too often concerning the
[1:27:12] things that we give our time to that
[1:27:15] have little to no eternal value at all.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; It affects your worship.
[1:27:25] Amen.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; I know he's had to confront me in this
[1:27:28] way too many times and I don't like
[1:27:31] that.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Just a lot of times it's things, you
[1:27:35] know, little things that that that they
[1:27:38] have no no eternal value yet they seem
[1:27:41] to find their way. They worm their way
[1:27:44] into our worship, into our lives of
[1:27:47] service to him. Or or my goodness, even
[1:27:49] worse, dare we even say, uh, you know
[1:27:52] what? If we open up our senses, remember
[1:27:54] that unconverted guy? What if we open up
[1:27:56] our senses to the darkness of this
[1:27:58] world? The things that we watch, the
[1:28:01] things that we hear, the things that we
[1:28:02] partake of that that are that are
[1:28:05] spiritually toxic,
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; completely
[1:28:11] counterproductive to a life of spiritual
[1:28:14] richness in Christ.
[1:28:18] I wonder if like Balam we hear the voice
[1:28:20] of the Lord asking
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; who who's that in your house?
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Who Who is this in your house?
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; I didn't put I didn't put this here.
[1:28:34] This is where I live. Who Who's in your
[1:28:37] house?
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 3
[1:28:42] and then we'll go to 1 Corinthians 6.
[1:28:44] But 1 Corinthians 3:16,
[1:28:49] "Know ye not that ye are the temple of
[1:28:52] God?"
[1:28:54] Did you know that?
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Know ye not that you're the temple of
[1:29:01] God and that the spirit of God dwelleth
[1:29:04] in you? Paul's asking a question to
[1:29:07] these Corinthians. 1 Corinthians 6
[1:29:11] 19 and 20. What know ye not that your
[1:29:15] body is the temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:19] which is in you which you have of God
[1:29:22] and ye are not your own.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; For ye are bought with a price.
[1:29:28] Therefore, everybody say therefore.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Therefore,
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; glorify God in your body and in your
[1:29:35] spirit which are gods.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; So now the question becomes even closer.
[1:29:41] It's God asking you, "Who is this in my
[1:29:45] house?
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; You thought it was your house.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; But actually, I bought it. I own it. You
[1:29:53] were on your way to hell. You were on a
[1:29:55] death sentence. I saved you. I redeemed
[1:29:57] you. I live here.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; What do I see in my house that's not
[1:30:02] supposed to be there?"
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; You still with me? Oh,
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; yeah.
[1:30:13] It might be well saying that to you this
[1:30:17] morning, friends.
[1:30:19] Who is this that you have
[1:30:22] in my house?
[1:30:27] What could we say?
[1:30:32] What what could we say given that just
[1:30:35] as Balum we opened the door?
[1:30:39] We actually let them in. We actually
[1:30:43] invited them in. We actually bedded them
[1:30:46] down,
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; tucked them in.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; I I I just feel like just leaving my
[1:30:59] notes and just preaching. I'm just
[1:31:00] trying to stay right to my notes today.
[1:31:02] I I love that song that Sister Esther
[1:31:05] sang. Uh, let today be the day. I get
[1:31:08] she's singing about the coming of the
[1:31:09] Lord, but the coming of the Lord is now.
[1:31:12] Let today be the day that you leave here
[1:31:14] free. Let today be the day that you say
[1:31:16] I'm done. I'm kicking them out of his
[1:31:18] house. I am a house that's supposed to
[1:31:21] be a tabernacle. I'm to be a temple of
[1:31:24] the Holy Ghost.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; How many want to say, "Today is the day.
[1:31:27] Come, Lord Jesus. Come.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna go too fast. Kevin, don't try
[1:31:37] to follow me. I'm going to just go
[1:31:38] quickly. I'm going to have to hurry. But
[1:31:40] you mark you mark this down. Solomon
[1:31:43] tells us in the fourth chapter of
[1:31:44] Proverbs, above all else, guard your
[1:31:47] heart for everything you do flows from
[1:31:51] it. Listen, friends, you realize that
[1:31:53] the heart is so much our inner life.
[1:31:55] It's so the core being of our uh and and
[1:31:58] and and it's literally where it's
[1:32:01] literally where long-term health or
[1:32:04] long-term damage proceeds from.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; So, you should guard your heart. You
[1:32:11] shouldn't be allowing these these these
[1:32:14] Moabites inside your house.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; It's God's house. He's given it to you
[1:32:22] to live for him and to be an example of
[1:32:25] the word of God.
[1:32:27] The Bible warns us, and I I didn't read
[1:32:29] it. Well, I think we did read it today.
[1:32:31] Yes, we did in our text where we were in
[1:32:33] Ephesians 5, have nothing to do with the
[1:32:36] fruitful fruitless deeds of darkness,
[1:32:39] but rather expose them. Paul goes on to
[1:32:42] tell the Philippian church in the fourth
[1:32:44] chapter. encourages us to focus on
[1:32:47] things that are true, things that are
[1:32:49] noble, things that are right, things
[1:32:52] that are pure, things that are lovely,
[1:32:54] things that are admirable, things that
[1:32:56] are excellent, things that are
[1:32:58] praiseworthy.
[1:33:00] Are the elements sleeping in my house
[1:33:02] praiseworthy? Have I opened the door and
[1:33:06] now there's a part of me that's
[1:33:07] manifesting something that the the life
[1:33:10] song of my praise is contaminated?
[1:33:16] There's accountability when you're a
[1:33:17] Christian. You believe that? Let me
[1:33:20] leave you with some good news today. I
[1:33:22] needed this so bad when I came across
[1:33:24] it.
[1:33:27] Let's just be honest.
[1:33:30] Let's just be honest. If you'll be
[1:33:32] honest with me, real honest, then I'll
[1:33:36] stop right here.
[1:33:38] If I if I detect that you're not being
[1:33:40] honest and you're just trying to get out
[1:33:42] of church, I'm gonna keep going.
[1:33:45] Amen.
[1:33:47] I got lots more I can say.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:53] You know,
[1:33:59] maybe sometimes we'd have to admit
[1:34:05] that we've been careless or
[1:34:10] distracted,
[1:34:14] inviting things in that that don't honor
[1:34:17] him.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:19] things that do not build us up
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; spiritually.
[1:34:24] But the beautiful part is
[1:34:28] that God is merciful
[1:34:30] and ready to help and ready to forgive
[1:34:34] and ready to cleanse.
[1:34:38] And I had forgotten of all my years, I
[1:34:41] guess, because I only quoted it so far
[1:34:43] and never quoted the tail end of it,
[1:34:45] which for me was such a personal moment.
[1:34:49] And you know, you have those going down
[1:34:50] through life. You get those great times
[1:34:52] in the Lord and then sometimes you get
[1:34:55] something you see in the word and it's
[1:34:57] been there all along, but suddenly it
[1:34:59] just means everything to you.
[1:35:03] And when we read from the apostle John,
[1:35:08] he says,
[1:35:10] "If we confess our sins,
[1:35:13] he is faithful and just and will forgive
[1:35:17] us and
[1:35:20] purify." Your King James says, "Cleanse,
[1:35:23] purify us from all unrighteousness."
[1:35:27] Amen.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; And I when I I said, "Lord,
[1:35:32] I forgot that it said that. How although
[1:35:36] I I I knew it since a child reading my
[1:35:39] Bible, but it suddenly came off the page
[1:35:42] and it meant so much to me." And I said,
[1:35:44] ' Not only do I have an advocate with
[1:35:47] the father, if I do commit a
[1:35:49] transgression, if I do sin, if I do
[1:35:51] stumble, if today you're you're here and
[1:35:54] you're sitting here right now and you
[1:35:56] realize you got Moabites living inside
[1:35:58] of your house, or more perfectly his
[1:36:00] house,
[1:36:02] and you want to say, "Lord, forgive me."
[1:36:05] He will. And here's the here's actually
[1:36:08] the thing that makes it all worth it.
[1:36:10] He'll purify you of all unrighteousness.
[1:36:15] I just raised up my hands. Maybe you'd
[1:36:17] like to raise up your hands with me and
[1:36:18] say, "Lord God, forgive us, Lord God. We
[1:36:21] want to have a life song that worships
[1:36:24] you in purity. Oh, forgive us Lord God
[1:36:27] when we've allowed the non essential
[1:36:30] things in our lives and or God forbid
[1:36:32] that today there'd be young people, old
[1:36:34] people, married people, single people
[1:36:36] who feel who find themselves constantly
[1:36:39] bound, constantly a repeating sin,
[1:36:41] constantly stumbling. How can I ever be
[1:36:43] free? Am I possessed by a devil? Am I
[1:36:46] really a Christian? Do I have the Holy
[1:36:48] Ghost? Lord God, they couldn't even seek
[1:36:50] you in that way if they didn't have an
[1:36:52] interchange inside their heart. And so
[1:36:54] we raise up our hands today to say,
[1:36:56] "Forgive me and purify me, oh God.
[1:37:00] Purify me with righteousness. Purify me.
[1:37:04] Cleanse me of all unrighteousness."
[1:37:08] Oh, stand to your feet with me this
[1:37:10] morning, friends. Why don't you raise up
[1:37:12] those hands to God and just say, "Purify
[1:37:15] me, Lord. Purify my heart. Purify my
[1:37:19] mind. I'm repenting. I'm asking for your
[1:37:22] pardoning grace. I'm going to get rid of
[1:37:24] that moabitete. I don't want that in my
[1:37:26] life anymore, Lord. I want to be a
[1:37:28] vessel. I want to be a vessel that sings
[1:37:33] your grace to the world.
[1:37:37] Purify
[1:37:38] my heart. Purify my life. May you grant
[1:37:43] it to us today, Lord. Father, a sermon
[1:37:48] like this is penetrating and
[1:37:53] I sure didn't expect it. It seemed to
[1:37:55] come out of left field on me. I didn't
[1:37:58] expect it when you when I had the first
[1:38:00] concept of this little miniseries,
[1:38:04] Satan's
[1:38:05] Lucifer's complete competing claim. I
[1:38:08] didn't imagine.
[1:38:10] Oh, last time Lord, we had a shout in
[1:38:12] Jubilee and we ran all over the place
[1:38:14] rejoicing.
[1:38:17] Well,
[1:38:19] today was a little different.
[1:38:23] But I know these are your people.
[1:38:26] And I know the same ones who were
[1:38:28] rejoicing at the word last week were
[1:38:30] being penetrated today. And it's created
[1:38:33] a a desire. And I have a desire. Even as
[1:38:36] I preach it and I've studied it and I've
[1:38:39] put the notes together. I've been living
[1:38:41] off of it for days. But today, as I
[1:38:43] preach it under your anointing, I want a
[1:38:46] fresh cleansing. Oh God. I want a fresh
[1:38:49] purging. I want a fresh purifying. I
[1:38:52] want to be purified of all
[1:38:54] unrighteousness. Let today be the day.
[1:38:57] Let today come Lord Jesus. Come purify
[1:39:00] my heart, oh God.
[1:39:02] May you grant it, master. We love you.
[1:39:06] We pause right here, Lord. There's so
[1:39:08] much more to say, but I feel by your
[1:39:10] permission we can just stop right here.
[1:39:12] Give you some time to deal with hearts.
[1:39:15] I commit it to you, Lord. But I commit
[1:39:17] myself to you, these people, to you. All
[1:39:19] those who are streaming or catch this
[1:39:22] service at a later time.
[1:39:25] Many will. Lord,
[1:39:27] I hear from them.
[1:39:30] We're all in this thing together.
[1:39:33] I'm so glad of that. I'm so glad, Lord
[1:39:36] God, that we have a word that's true.
[1:39:40] that we not only have these challenging
[1:39:43] questions, but we have the answer to the
[1:39:45] devil's challenge.
[1:39:47] If we confess our sins,
[1:39:50] you are faithful and just to forgive us
[1:39:55] and to cleanse us from all
[1:39:57] unrighteousness.
[1:40:03] Amen.
[1:40:05] Amen. Let's sing that, brother Kenny.
[1:40:08] Purify.
[1:40:10] Purify
[1:40:12] my heart.
[1:40:15] Let me be as gold
[1:40:19] [Music]
[1:40:21] and preious
[1:40:23] silver,
[1:40:25] purified
[1:40:27] by my heart.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's beautiful.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Let me be as gold.
[1:40:34] [Music]
[1:40:36] Pure
[1:40:38] gold. Refiner's fire.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Refiner's
[1:40:43] fire.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, why don't you reach out and touch
[1:40:46] him today?
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Let this song be your prayer to him.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Say it like this.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Is to be.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; My life is to be
[1:40:58] holy.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Set aart
[1:41:04] for you, Lord.
[1:41:07] I choose to be. I choose
[1:41:12] holy.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Does anybody want prayer today?
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; You want to come forward and let me pray
[1:41:20] with you and say,
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; "Brother Jason, I need more of this God
[1:41:23] in my life."
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I I feel like being the one at
[1:41:28] the front of the line. Friends, we're
[1:41:30] all in this thing together.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Why don't you lift up that voice today?
[1:41:35] Say, "Purify, Lord God.
[1:41:38] Hallelujah. Some are coming for prayer.
[1:41:40] You're welcome to come.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Young people, don't miss your day of
[1:41:44] visitation.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Parents, don't miss your day to
[1:41:48] recalibrate your home.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Set a new standard
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; that your children can see.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; I came to church with this parent. I
[1:41:59] went home with a different one.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Maybe a parent can say,
[1:42:04] "I brought this child to church today,
[1:42:06] but I took a different one home." Oh,
[1:42:09] granted, oh God. How many can want that
[1:42:11] kind of movement of the Holy Spirit? Pur
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; purify.
[1:42:16] Purify.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Me from within.
[1:42:22] [Music]
[1:42:24] deep within
[1:42:28] reers.
[1:42:31] [Music]
[1:42:35] My heart's one desire
[1:42:39] [Music]
[1:42:41] is to be
[1:42:46] holy.
[1:42:50] Set aart
[1:42:52] for you, Lord.
[1:42:55] I choose to be
[1:43:00] holy.
[1:43:04] Set aart
[1:43:07] for you, my master.
[1:43:12] Ready to do your will.

[1:46:46] There's nothing I can do but surrender.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; All I can do is stand here today and
[1:46:51] surrender. Raise up my hands and say, "I
[1:46:54] surrender it, Lord.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; I will not I will not ever again take
[1:46:59] this flow of light back into my life.
[1:47:01] I'll change and I'll do what's what
[1:47:03] needs to be done.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Speak what is true."
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're so worthy, Lord.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; You are,
