[34:58] church you know those happen every once
[35:00] in a while that's not what's happened
[35:02] here it's just that I I think I expected
[35:05] to go further in my notes today but the
[35:09] Lord seems to have from the earliest
[35:10] hours of this morning slowed me down and
[35:14] um so this might be a short sermon amen
[35:17] but I think the Lord wants to make a
[35:19] point and uh now that don't I mean
[35:23] brother Diggs will 15 minutes in say
[35:25] don't get nervous I'm getting ready to
[35:26] close that don't mean nothing so so I'm
[35:30] saying it might be a short sermon that
[35:32] don't necessarily mean anything but um
[35:34] it looks like it to me but I want your
[35:37] undivided attention and uh I I can see
[35:40] the purpose of God in it I truly can
[35:43] because we've been last time we spoke
[35:46] about what I call and what I've called
[35:49] for a long time the greatest existential
[35:52] threat to human existence and that and
[35:57] I've said that it's not Russia and it's
[35:59] not China and it's not North Korea and
[36:01] it's not any of that the greatest threat
[36:04] to human survival is the Beast system of
[36:08] the Antichrist that is going and the
[36:11] reason that it's a much greater threat
[36:13] is because it's going to take the world
[36:15] into the tribulation where the world in
[36:17] their Madness will destroy themselves
[36:20] and it will be an Extinction event and
[36:22] so there is no greater threat than the
[36:25] deception that was to come in the last
[36:28] day and remember this let me just say
[36:33] um because I I might forget it and it's
[36:36] not in my notes but I just want to say
[36:39] this that when we speak about the about
[36:44] the
[36:45] deception you you realize that this is
[36:48] something that mankind has well earned
[36:51] that God said in the end time he would
[36:53] send a strong
[36:55] delusion and the unbelievers would
[36:57] believe a lie and be damned by it amen
[37:02] you understand that so so when we when
[37:05] we think about this strong delusion and
[37:09] how that the people uh you know will
[37:12] believe a lie they've brought this on
[37:14] themselves we we talked about last time
[37:17] that we went back to Isaiah and we went
[37:20] in other places in the Old Testament it
[37:22] was their eyes they have closed their
[37:25] ears they have closed
[37:28] amen and so I again it's not the cruelty
[37:31] of God you're going to hear today where
[37:34] we read a quote here that we read maybe
[37:37] a little more than a couple years ago
[37:39] maybe and I I wanted to read it for us
[37:42] again
[37:43] today because it is
[37:45] extremely deceptive and and when he says
[37:50] you would believe a lie I'll send you a
[37:55] strong delusion to believe a lie and be
[37:57] damned by brother brandham rightly
[37:59] points out in the Greek text that it's
[38:03] actually the Lie the original lie now
[38:07] don't think of the original lie as sex
[38:10] in the Garden of Eden that was just the
[38:11] consequence of the reasoning away of
[38:14] God's word that was that was a
[38:16] consequence of believing see the the the
[38:19] lie because it was it was
[38:22] after Eve was told the LIE the Bible
[38:26] says then she saw
[38:28] that it was good for food and and one
[38:30] thing to be desired so say then brother
[38:33] Jason what was the LIE the lie that was
[38:36] in the Garden of Eden and the same lie
[38:40] that's operational today and the same
[38:43] lie that will take the world into the
[38:46] tribulation period missing the Rapture
[38:48] even Christians by the tens of millions
[38:51] will miss the Rapture because of
[38:54] believing this lie and the LIE is in a
[38:58] nutshell that the word of God can be
[39:01] compromised just a little
[39:04] bit that you don't actually have to
[39:06] believe all of it you can just believe
[39:09] 99% of it and you'll be okay and that's
[39:12] not
[39:15] true it's so cunning and it's so close
[39:19] that it would actually deceive the very
[39:21] elected if that were possible thank God
[39:23] it's
[39:24] not so so that's the LIE is that God
[39:28] won't actually do what he said he would
[39:31] do amen all right let's read Revelation
[39:37] CH 2 verses 18-
[39:42] 24 friends if it was not for the
[39:46] interval of time that little interval of
[39:49] time between the sixth and seventh seal
[39:51] where God and the sixth and seventh
[39:53] trumpet where God took a gentile Prophet
[39:56] sent him down into the Earth a seventh
[39:59] star in his right hand and sent him down
[40:02] just dropped him down in a little
[40:03] interval of time almost it's like snuck
[40:05] in got a bride ready and took them home
[40:09] if it wasn't for God doing that and us
[40:11] having this message we would believe the
[40:13] life we would also be caught in the
[40:16] delusion that the world you ought to be
[40:20] thankful oh you ought to thank God
[40:23] blessed are your eyes for they see
[40:27] your ears that they hear these things so
[40:32] so just just you know the Lord has me
[40:35] kind of in an odd frame of mind today
[40:38] and I feel very solemn in this and so
[40:40] it's it's so close to my heart that I've
[40:43] got to be able to stand on that day and
[40:46] say I have not
[40:49] shun you the whole
[40:53] C Revelation chapter 2
[40:57] now this is the thot tyan age the fourth
[40:59] age the reason it's important is because
[41:01] this runs all the way to the
[41:04] end so watch uh and unto the angel of
[41:08] the church in
[41:09] thyra write these things sayeth the Son
[41:12] of God who hath his eyes like unto a
[41:15] flame of fire and his feet are like fine
[41:19] brass I Know Thy works and charity and
[41:22] service and faith and thy patience and
[41:26] thy works and the last to be more than
[41:28] the first not withstanding I have a few
[41:32] things against thee because thou
[41:34] sufferest that woman Jezebel which
[41:37] calleth herself a prophetess now this is
[41:39] a false church this is the Roman system
[41:43] of of a church she's
[41:47] had three Church ages already to pollute
[41:51] the world and now she's come to the
[41:53] fourth age which will then be a thousand
[41:55] years of Dark Ages
[41:57] and it'll be during that time that God
[42:00] will come under the fifth age with
[42:01] Luther to start back restoring the brid
[42:05] tree amen all right
[42:08] notwithstanding I have a few things
[42:10] against thee because thou sufferest that
[42:12] woman Jezebel which calleth herself a
[42:15] prophetess to teach and to seduce you
[42:18] see what she's doing through her
[42:20] teaching she
[42:23] seduces get that don't read ahead look
[42:25] this way you get that through her
[42:27] teaching she seduces how will the Beast
[42:31] system persuade people to go into the
[42:34] tribulation he'll teach them or prophesy
[42:36] them right into it by telling them the
[42:39] original lie all of God's word you don't
[42:42] have to keep all of it God won't
[42:44] actually do what he said you can
[42:47] compromise the word of God just a little
[42:49] bit that's the lie that dams the
[42:54] world teaching and to teach and to
[42:57] seduce my servants to commit
[42:59] fornication and to eat things sacrificed
[43:03] unto idols and I gave her space to
[43:06] repent of her fornication and she
[43:08] repented not behold I will cast her into
[43:12] a bed and them that commit adultery with
[43:16] her into Great Tribulation except they
[43:19] repent of their deeds verse 23 this is
[43:23] interesting and I will kill her children
[43:25] with death and brother Brandon is making
[43:28] it clear that these are the Harlot
[43:31] Daughters of organized
[43:33] religion now he's very clear not the
[43:36] people the system it's the organiz the
[43:40] organizations not the people brother
[43:42] Bram said God has plenty of godly people
[43:45] caught trapped in those systems and
[43:48] that's why the message of the hour came
[43:50] to call them out of
[43:52] that you're called out so you can be
[43:55] called up and if you're if you ever want
[43:58] to be caught up and called up like John
[44:02] in Revelation 4 do you want to be you
[44:05] want to be called up someday then you
[44:07] better be called out or you'll never
[44:10] hear come up unless you first hear come
[44:12] out see all
[44:15] right verse 23 and I will kill her
[44:18] children with death and all the churches
[44:20] shall know sure they will by the time
[44:23] they're in the tribulation and we're
[44:24] gone they'll certainly know it that I am
[44:26] he which searcheth the Reigns and hearts
[44:29] and I will give unto every one of you
[44:31] according to your works but I say unto
[44:34] you and to the rest in thyra as many as
[44:37] have not this Doctrine in which have not
[44:39] known the depths of Satan as they speak
[44:42] I will put upon you none other
[44:45] burden now that we know that this fourth
[44:48] age this Jezebel system carries all the
[44:50] way through to the destruction the fifth
[44:52] Church age sixth Church age seventh
[44:54] Church age is all about the restoration
[44:57] and he says I gave her a space to repent
[45:00] so so in that way Luther's message of
[45:03] justification he's trying to reform that
[45:05] Catholic church trying to get them to
[45:08] repent Wesley comes along and now he's
[45:10] got to get Luther and the Catholic
[45:12] Church to repent then the isua fathers
[45:14] come along now they got to get the
[45:15] Methodist and the lutherans and the
[45:17] Catholics to repent then a prophet comes
[45:19] along one born out of season he's trying
[45:21] to get the Pentecostals to repent nobody
[45:23] will repent amen amen and finally they
[45:27] close the doors to the prophet of the
[45:29] age and he says all men have forsaken me
[45:32] this is the present stage of my Ministry
[45:34] and then God calls him out west and
[45:36] shows him a vision says go back East
[45:38] because we're about to change the scene
[45:40] and now seals come open and a time of a
[45:43] bride begins where she's called out of
[45:46] these systems aren't you glad to be
[45:48] called
[45:49] out amen praise the Lord let's let's
[45:53] pray father we thank you Lord God for
[45:56] your word word today and Lord I I've
[46:00] I've humbled myself and as brother
[46:01] brandham said I humbled myself again
[46:04] Lord I wouldn't put my feet on the floor
[46:06] this morning without having my mind and
[46:09] Reporting Lord in the name of Jesus I
[46:11] put my feet on the floor I'm going
[46:13] forward today with the word to the
[46:15] people what is it that you have for us
[46:17] Lord father I had plenty of notes that
[46:20] was not the issue there's notes I won't
[46:22] get to today but you just seem to zero
[46:24] me in Lord on this thought thought to to
[46:28] bring it down once more father to make
[46:31] make it as the prophet said you drive a
[46:33] nail you got to make it cinch or clench
[46:36] you got to drive it all the way until it
[46:38] clenches so father I pray that you will
[46:41] grant it to us today and may Lord those
[46:44] who hear this message live today or
[46:47] those on the internet those by an
[46:49] archive that they will think deeply and
[46:52] Ponder what they're hearing today Father
[46:55] I ask you this in Jesus name amen God
[46:58] bless you friends you can be seated
[47:00] we'll have my PowerPoint thank you
[47:01] brother
[47:08] Mark
[47:13] amen so again I'm not going to cover a
[47:16] lot of but it seems like this portion uh
[47:19] and I've
[47:21] been myself part two I said man oh man
[47:25] when I get to part three it's going to
[47:27] be nuclear and the Lord just seems to
[47:29] have a slower pace for me today so I'm
[47:32] I'm as brother Dale would say cooling my
[47:34] Jets
[47:36] amen and it's uh it's a controlled burn
[47:39] believe me amen but hey you know brother
[47:43] brandom talks about that that that's
[47:44] real power he said you you you've got
[47:47] more power when you can do that you've
[47:50] got more power than the man that runs
[47:52] all over the platform and makes a big
[47:54] bunch of noise he said because you've
[47:56] learned learn to conquer
[47:58] yourself and I think that that that is
[48:01] Paramount today friends that we need to
[48:04] let we need to learn to conquer
[48:06] ourselves amen we have seen the enemy
[48:08] and it is us you know and this is this
[48:11] was the theme of what I was taking at
[48:13] the ministers meeting uh yesterday there
[48:15] in Lula Georgia uh be because we realize
[48:19] that our our you know the promise to
[48:21] Abraham was and to his seed remember
[48:24] it's the singular Christ seed which is a
[48:27] spiritual seed not the sons of Isaac
[48:29] because not all Israel is Israel you
[48:32] understand but that spiritual seed which
[48:35] was a faith Seed of Abraham the promise
[48:38] was that it would possess the Gate of
[48:41] its enemies and I and the Lord laid it
[48:43] on my heart and I think it's relevant to
[48:45] us today that I have no greater enemy
[48:49] than my
[48:50] flesh and this flesh has 10 Gates amen
[48:55] it has five In the Flesh and five in the
[48:57] spirit and gates are a stronghold to a
[49:00] city who controls the gate controls the
[49:02] city the enemy can breach the gate I'm
[49:04] here to tell you you can have every good
[49:06] intention and well and fine but if you
[49:08] don't guard these Gates you got a
[49:10] problem if you let the the enemy if you
[49:13] give your eyes and your ears and your
[49:15] feet and your hands to the wrong thing
[49:17] I'm here to tell you the S Satan will
[49:19] use that and he'll he'll light up your
[49:22] memory and then he'll anoint your
[49:23] imagination and then he'll come back
[49:25] here to your conscience and he'll bring
[49:26] bring it all forward and wrap it all up
[49:28] and and and you'll eat it like a
[49:30] birthday cake and the next thing you
[49:33] know you'll be on your knees repentant
[49:34] somewhere Lord forgive me I didn't mean
[49:36] to do that and that'll be true you
[49:38] really didn't mean to do that but you
[49:40] didn't guard the gates see so the
[49:43] promise is in the seed of Christ and
[49:46] that's why that's why it's it that's
[49:49] that's tanam out to what I'm preaching
[49:52] today there is no effective way hear me
[49:56] when I say it there is no effective way
[50:00] to guard the gates without a new
[50:05] birth because and you're going to see
[50:07] why here in a minute the carnal mind is
[50:09] enmity against God it could never even
[50:11] agree with God's word it takes the Holy
[50:13] Spirit to even draw you to eternal life
[50:16] you can't even you can't even decide you
[50:19] can't even decide to decide to get
[50:22] eternal life your mind is enmity it
[50:25] means it's hostile to God's word and
[50:28] that and that's that's not because
[50:30] you're a bad person it's because you're
[50:31] born in sin and that's why Jesus said
[50:35] you must you must you must be born again
[50:40] see he he he's not he's he he doesn't
[50:43] say you know uh in order to get in
[50:46] heaven you must believe William Brandon
[50:48] was a prophet what he said was you must
[50:52] be born again amen because he because if
[50:54] you're born again that only comes by the
[50:57] spirit of God and then you'll do the
[50:59] works of God which are to believe on him
[51:01] whom God ha sent see so it's we never
[51:05] want to get the cart ahead of the horse
[51:07] it's not about trying to be pleasing to
[51:10] God in our works it's you find your way
[51:13] to heaven you surrender your way there
[51:15] friends you you live because you're
[51:18] willing to die and whoever will save his
[51:21] life will lose it but whoever's willing
[51:24] to lose his life will save it amen
[51:27] am I in the scripture you know your
[51:29] Bible is that true see so it so it's not
[51:33] about living under a law because we we
[51:37] we we have been delivered from the law
[51:40] all right I don't want to get ahead of
[51:41] myself let me just let me just carry
[51:43] on we said to you last time how that how
[51:50] that Eve in the Garden of Eden that when
[51:55] she was
[51:57] when Eve was partaking of that which was
[52:01] forbidden because she had listened to
[52:03] reasoning and she had reasoned the word
[52:06] of God she she believed the lie that you
[52:09] can reason the word of God and therefore
[52:13] when she Eve as I pointed out to you
[52:15] last time Eve was not thinking oh I'm
[52:20] going to do this and it's going to break
[52:21] fellowship with God that wasn't on her
[52:23] mind at all Eve thought it was a good
[52:26] thing
[52:27] Eve went to Adam joyfully look what I've
[52:29] found I've got a whole new understanding
[52:33] you know we don't have to live under
[52:35] these laws exactly you see and so so Eve
[52:40] and I pointed out to you you say but I
[52:42] know people who are outside the message
[52:45] and love God and Eve also loved that
[52:47] being that came down remember we were
[52:49] talking about that Eve loved that being
[52:52] that came down every day in the cool of
[52:54] the evening and tucked them in and
[52:56] kissed them good night and spoke to them
[52:58] like a father would to his children Eve
[53:01] never imagined that what she was going
[53:03] to do would break the fellowship with
[53:05] that
[53:06] being but it did it broke that
[53:09] fellowship and it ended and then when
[53:11] Adam did it it broke the whole world
[53:13] Eve's not the one broke the world she
[53:15] couldn't only a Son of God could do that
[53:17] and Adam being the Son of God saving Eve
[53:20] broke the world Amen you understand so
[53:23] so we realize that that Adam was not
[53:26] even in the transgression he did it with
[53:28] his eyes wide open uh he was I mean to
[53:31] say he wasn't deceived he did it with
[53:32] his eyes wide open and so Eve got
[53:35] deceived by it so we find that the
[53:38] challenge today that the word challenges
[53:42] us with is that we're not we're we are
[53:45] another Eve but we're not like that one
[53:48] see now that was our sister we'll see
[53:50] her again today she'll have as much
[53:52] regret as David had for what he did
[53:54] they'll have as much regret as I what
[53:56] I've done and what you've done but I'm
[53:58] glad that God is a god of Mercy see and
[54:01] so so we realize that that you know she
[54:05] got misled into that by misinterpreted
[54:08] Theology and so we we're finding that
[54:11] today the challenge for us in the word
[54:14] is to prove to the world that we're not
[54:17] like that first Eve the second Adam was
[54:21] not like the first Adam the second Eve
[54:24] will not be like the first Eve I want to
[54:26] prove I'm one in a million I will not Li
[54:29] I will not accept this Harlot system of
[54:34] religion uh today I'm not going to
[54:37] believe in that Jezebel system or her
[54:41] children her Offspring see all right
[54:44] again not the people the
[54:47] system so but by disbelieving his word
[54:51] she indeed lost fellowship with the
[54:54] person of him and I and I said said to
[54:56] you then and I say it to you now I don't
[54:58] even know how to make it pler than that
[55:00] you can see it from the book of Genesis
[55:03] therefore to me in my mind the fall in
[55:05] Genesis it should be the first sign to
[55:07] the world that he and his word are the
[55:10] same thing that should be the first sign
[55:13] that when they see that that what Eve
[55:15] did in her action broke Fellowship
[55:18] because she disbelieved the word and
[55:19] when she disbel the word that broke
[55:21] fellowship with him then how is he not
[55:24] the word how do you how would the word
[55:26] World think I can believe in Christ but
[55:29] I don't have to believe all the word I
[55:32] can disregard parts of the Bible because
[55:35] I believe in the man on the cross and as
[55:37] I said to you uh that before he was the
[55:40] man on the cross he was the word that
[55:43] word built a body and that body went to
[55:45] the Cross but he was always the word see
[55:49] so if you think it through you'll see
[55:52] that this is exactly why the keeping of
[55:55] the law could come to an end but not the
[55:58] keeping of the
[56:01] word you get that because the the
[56:04] keeping of the law did come to an end
[56:06] amen it got fulfilled in Jesus but the
[56:10] keeping of the law did not end the
[56:12] keeping of the word you see so so when
[56:16] when the strict observance of the Old
[56:19] Testament law ended in Christ his family
[56:23] did not become Lawless
[56:27] we we came under a new law called The
[56:31] Law of Liberty it's still a law it has
[56:35] regulations it has borders and
[56:37] parameters it has requirements and
[56:40] prerequisites it it has identifying
[56:43] markers that you're under it or you're
[56:44] not under it you're you think you're
[56:46] under it but you're wrong see it is a
[56:49] law of Liberty it's not a
[56:52] lawlessness Christian Grace is not
[56:55] lawlessness
[56:57] that's that's turning Grace into
[57:00] disgrace the grace of God teaches us to
[57:03] deny ungodliness that's the Bible see so
[57:09] so you say I'm not under the law you're
[57:11] you're you're you're just under a
[57:13] different law see you're under the law
[57:16] of Liberty and the law of
[57:19] Liberty is not the law to go live how
[57:21] you want in a sinful condition the law
[57:24] of Liberty is that you finally can live
[57:27] according to the vision God had of you
[57:30] you couldn't do it before there wasn't a
[57:32] law behind you but now there's a law of
[57:34] Liberty that will Empower you to finally
[57:37] finally be the kind of man or woman that
[57:40] God intended for you to be so you can
[57:44] lay your head on your pillow at night
[57:46] content and know that you're living
[57:48] under the blessing of God in the will of
[57:51] God and that God can get behind your
[57:54] life see
[57:57] so we're now governed by a new law James
[57:59] 1:25 we don't just leave my PowerPoint
[58:02] there by the Mark I'm just going to
[58:04] quote this James 1:25 but who so lookth
[58:07] under the perfect law of Liberty and
[58:09] continueth therein he being not a
[58:13] forgetful hearer but a doer of the work
[58:17] this man shall be blessed in his deed is
[58:20] can I make it pler I love James because
[58:23] of he's so plain spoken
[58:26] he just he just plain spoken listen to
[58:29] it again but who so lookth into the
[58:31] perfect law of Liberty and continueth
[58:34] therein he being not a forgetful hearer
[58:36] but a doer of the work this man shall be
[58:39] blessed in his deed amen all right so we
[58:44] find that this is the man whose Soul has
[58:48] been reconnected back to God and he now
[58:52] sits in Heavenly places when I think of
[58:54] that scripture I realize that we don't
[58:55] know everything about Dimensions we
[58:57] think we know because you're sitting
[59:00] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[59:02] Jesus so the perfect law of Liberty is
[59:06] is really and I and I'm going to have to
[59:08] really explain this to you carefully I
[59:10] want your real close attention you're
[59:12] giving it to me so far please keep it
[59:14] keep it coming the perfect law of
[59:17] Liberty is full free moral is is full
[59:24] free moral agency at its
[59:27] best you're free moral agent because you
[59:30] have a soul now you can choose now you
[59:33] can reason that's great and it's
[59:36] dangerous you understand it's a
[59:38] two-edged sword it's fantastic it set
[59:41] you above all other in creation but
[59:44] there's a there's a side to that the
[59:46] enemy can come in and disrupt your
[59:49] harmony with the Lord see so I want to
[59:52] say it again the perfect law of Liberty
[59:55] is itself self uh it's the operational
[59:59] standard of full free moral agency at
[1:00:02] its best because only God can bring a
[1:00:08] mortal man from his sinful condition
[1:00:12] into this law this this elevated law of
[1:00:14] Liberty only God can do that you see you
[1:00:18] can't do that by joining a church that's
[1:00:21] right or just reading your Bible or even
[1:00:24] believing Doctrine you it's still no
[1:00:28] matter what you do your best effort is
[1:00:31] still filthiness to God it's got to be
[1:00:32] the grace of God the mercy of God Jesus
[1:00:36] said no man can come to me except he's
[1:00:38] drawn of my father see you can't come to
[1:00:41] me Jesus said until my father draws you
[1:00:43] oh and by the way you can't get to my
[1:00:45] father except through me so it's you're
[1:00:48] talking about an impossible situation
[1:00:50] you can't get to God but through Christ
[1:00:52] you can't come to Christ unless the
[1:00:53] father draws you you see what I'm saying
[1:00:56] so so we realize then that that only God
[1:00:59] can bring a mortal man from a sinful
[1:01:02] condition that he's born in to this law
[1:01:04] of Liberty which as we've said is really
[1:01:07] free moral agency at its best see
[1:01:10] because when when a man is born in sin
[1:01:15] this way he comes with a mind that is
[1:01:20] enmity against God brought on by the
[1:01:24] Fallen nature of his wrong birth amen
[1:01:28] you understand so you're in you got a
[1:01:29] real problem you're born in sin you you
[1:01:32] come into the world you're shaping in
[1:01:34] iniquity as the as a mashup of various
[1:01:36] scriptures describe so enmity your mind
[1:01:40] is enmity against God enmity means
[1:01:45] hostility and it and and it has some
[1:01:47] other synonymous Greek words that Greek
[1:01:49] word there uh that that that Paul is
[1:01:52] using the carnal mind as enmity against
[1:01:54] God it means it's h hostile toward God
[1:01:57] uh uh uh synonymous Greek words mean
[1:02:00] that it is that it's in a state of ill
[1:02:02] will or active
[1:02:05] malice you understand this is how you're
[1:02:08] born you say I'm a good person but your
[1:02:11] your carnal mind is in a state of
[1:02:13] Perpetual active malice against keeping
[1:02:17] this
[1:02:18] see and so it's a mind that that that it
[1:02:23] goes on to describe it in the Greek it
[1:02:25] goes on to describe that it's active
[1:02:27] malice it's hostility it's ill will it's
[1:02:30] a mind that could have a tendency toward
[1:02:34] hear me defamation or evil report about
[1:02:38] God's
[1:02:40] word that it would speak evil of God's
[1:02:43] word that it would defame God's word by
[1:02:47] and and you see scientists doing it all
[1:02:49] the time they defame God's word they
[1:02:52] disbelieve it and they say there's no
[1:02:54] such creature and they try to expl
[1:02:55] explain everything away with Evolution
[1:02:58] see and so they they defame when when
[1:03:01] you're and they do this because they are
[1:03:04] born with a broken mind amen that could
[1:03:09] not can't agree with God's word see and
[1:03:12] so it's a mind that would have a
[1:03:14] tendency toward doubt or defaming God's
[1:03:18] word or or giving an evil report about
[1:03:20] God's word even logical doubts and
[1:03:23] reasonings very much like the the
[1:03:26] Israelites at Cades
[1:03:28] Baria they had what did they have an
[1:03:30] evil report the spies came back two of
[1:03:33] them had a good report 10 of them had a
[1:03:35] bad report and the people reasoned that
[1:03:38] the 10 knew better than the two and the
[1:03:41] reason for that is is not because that
[1:03:45] Joshua and Caleb rebutted the report of
[1:03:50] the 10 the 10 said there's Giants Joshua
[1:03:55] and Caleb didn't rebut that they didn't
[1:03:57] say oh that's not true they said it
[1:04:00] doesn't matter we're more than
[1:04:03] able yes they're there but that doesn't
[1:04:06] matter yes the world is sin but it
[1:04:07] doesn't matter I can do all things
[1:04:10] through
[1:04:13] Christ so it just depends on who you
[1:04:15] want to serve who you want to
[1:04:19] believe so so we find then that that if
[1:04:24] that if I can observe
[1:04:27] understand and and choose myself to
[1:04:31] believe and live in a way that's
[1:04:35] pleasing to God then why do I need a
[1:04:40] savior all
[1:04:42] right I'm trying to go slow I want you
[1:04:44] to think with me you're going to think
[1:04:46] with
[1:04:47] me if I can observe and understand and
[1:04:51] choose myself to believe and live in a
[1:04:54] way pleasing to God then why do I need a
[1:04:57] savior and that was Paul's point that if
[1:05:01] salvation could come by the keeping of
[1:05:04] the law he said then the law would have
[1:05:05] been the standard but that could never
[1:05:07] produce it it had to come by the baptism
[1:05:11] of the Holy Ghost if I can get back to
[1:05:14] eternal life on my own why would I have
[1:05:17] to come God's provided
[1:05:20] way and then you say well that yeah
[1:05:22] you're right that's silly nobody would
[1:05:23] think like that you're wrong Millions
[1:05:26] think like that I don't need to believe
[1:05:28] all the word I can get back on my works
[1:05:31] I can just be a good person I can just
[1:05:33] oh they're good people when the Bible
[1:05:35] says there is none good not one not a
[1:05:38] single one there's only God only Christ
[1:05:40] is good see and Christ is his word so
[1:05:44] the only way to be good in the eyes of
[1:05:46] God is to look like the word to not look
[1:05:49] like it but be it how do I be it by
[1:05:51] eating it see by becoming it
[1:05:56] so why would I need the holy spirit of
[1:05:59] God to draw me or reveal anything to me
[1:06:03] I got everybody's attention I hope I do
[1:06:05] I'm going to really need everybody's
[1:06:06] attention because I don't want to have
[1:06:08] to preach this again for a little while
[1:06:11] so please make sure I have your
[1:06:13] undivided attention I might have to do
[1:06:15] like brother Diggs and come down and
[1:06:16] stand beside you and preach to
[1:06:20] you amen praise the Lord Brother dig as
[1:06:22] soon as he walks off the platform
[1:06:24] everybody gets nervous
[1:06:28] amen if you're going to come to the
[1:06:29] house of God you ought to pay
[1:06:31] attention why why'd you come if you're
[1:06:33] not going to pay attention this is the
[1:06:34] house of judgment this is the house of
[1:06:36] also of Life see so we come here to
[1:06:39] learn what God wants to say to us I
[1:06:41] promise you I promise you if Jesus
[1:06:44] materialized himself standing in front
[1:06:45] of this pull pit every one of you would
[1:06:47] pay attention see all right so watch so
[1:06:51] why would I need the holy spirit of God
[1:06:55] to draw me or reveal anything to me or
[1:07:00] speak to me at all if I can get myself
[1:07:04] there fair question why would I need to
[1:07:08] come God's provided way fair question
[1:07:11] why do I need God at all why do I need a
[1:07:13] savior if I can do it myself fair
[1:07:16] question then isn't the answer obvious I
[1:07:19] can't do it myself I need a savior I I
[1:07:23] don't I I need God's provid Ed way cuz I
[1:07:26] don't know the
[1:07:28] way because the true way is hidden it's
[1:07:30] narrow it's hard to find only the Holy
[1:07:32] Spirit can take you to it
[1:07:36] see so I am a free moral agent because
[1:07:40] well first of all I am a human
[1:07:43] being and even born wrong I am still hey
[1:07:48] I'm still made in the image of God I
[1:07:51] have a fully functioning conscience that
[1:07:53] tells me I shouldn't lie that I had that
[1:07:56] before I was born
[1:07:57] again right I uh you've got you are born
[1:08:01] in the image of God you you do have a
[1:08:03] fully functioning conscience brother
[1:08:05] brandom said when you told that first
[1:08:06] lie you knew but you shouldn't tell that
[1:08:08] no Mom it wasn't me and and and I was
[1:08:12] the best at it because I I could have
[1:08:14] cookie crumbs on me and say no Mom it
[1:08:16] wasn't
[1:08:17] me oh some somebody snuck in the window
[1:08:20] and spread cookie crumbs on me
[1:08:26] oh my sister Jean had enough wisdom to
[1:08:28] figure out get through that amen praise
[1:08:32] the Lord so so we find then that that
[1:08:37] hey I I'm a human being I'm a free moral
[1:08:41] agent and and even if I'm born wrong I'm
[1:08:44] still made in the image of God I've got
[1:08:46] a fully functioning conscience I have I
[1:08:49] have epic powers of reasoning I have a I
[1:08:52] have a naturally I mean why do I need
[1:08:55] God I've got a naturally occurring
[1:08:58] intelligence above all other animals I'm
[1:09:00] a human not only do I start with a head
[1:09:04] start on all other animals I can go to
[1:09:07] the institutions of learning and higher
[1:09:09] education and I can even accelerate and
[1:09:12] grow my intelligence why in the world
[1:09:14] would I need God why do I need a
[1:09:16] provided way see I'm a human I have free
[1:09:20] moral agency do I not I have reasoning
[1:09:22] do I not I'm intelligent am I not I'm a
[1:09:25] o all other creatures I can go to
[1:09:27] education I can get a higher education
[1:09:30] through science and culture I can
[1:09:32] achieve what I want amen and all of that
[1:09:36] is true everything I just said is
[1:09:40] true you can observe what to believe or
[1:09:46] disbelieve do or not do up to the point
[1:09:51] where sin limits your carnal mind and
[1:09:55] you fall short of eternal
[1:09:58] life and I'll tell you if you fall short
[1:10:03] of eternal life I don't care what you
[1:10:06] achieve academically you're
[1:10:08] finished you'll come to an end and your
[1:10:11] life will be for not and your education
[1:10:14] will be for
[1:10:15] not all your effort and all your
[1:10:18] attempts at success and you actually
[1:10:21] might achieve them but it will go to Ash
[1:10:23] and Cinder
[1:10:26] amen only Eternal has no beginning and
[1:10:31] no
[1:10:33] ending so eternal life
[1:10:36] then is not achieved I hope I have
[1:10:40] convinced you at least of that today
[1:10:43] that eternal life is not and cannot be
[1:10:45] achieved
[1:11:08] about and how not do wrong and even has
[1:11:12] a whole religion around it and people
[1:11:15] can concentrate their way into that but
[1:11:18] that's not eternal life you understand
[1:11:22] so as brother Bram said many good men
[1:11:24] had died di down Through the Ages and
[1:11:26] brother Brenham said some of them even
[1:11:28] died for a real cause but you know
[1:11:30] meaning a good cause but there never was
[1:11:33] one who could raise himself up again
[1:11:35] from the dead I present to you the man
[1:11:38] Christ Jesus the only one like him
[1:11:40] Hallelujah this is the one that can lead
[1:11:42] you and guide you to eternal life and
[1:11:45] education and science can't do it your
[1:11:47] reasoning can't do it logical reasoning
[1:11:51] can't do it
[1:11:56] the
[1:11:58] resurrection was a supernatural
[1:12:02] event you believe
[1:12:05] that brother Brandon talks about the
[1:12:07] Bible being a supernatural book the
[1:12:09] Bible is a supernatural book see and
[1:12:12] it's and it's it's even written in a
[1:12:14] supernatural way and it reveals a
[1:12:16] supernatural God it's a supernatural
[1:12:18] book about a supernatural God who wants
[1:12:19] to read it you know say it again this is
[1:12:23] a supernatural book written about a
[1:12:25] supernatural God who has a supernatural
[1:12:28] power who wants to read
[1:12:30] it
[1:12:32] see the work of the Gospel is a
[1:12:36] supernatural work that occurs within
[1:12:40] human mortal beings so this is where we
[1:12:44] were recapping and I'm recapping today
[1:12:47] this is where we were last time in John
[1:12:49] 6 verse 39 and this is the Father's will
[1:12:53] which has which hath sent me
[1:12:55] that of all which he hath given me I
[1:12:57] should lose nothing but should raise it
[1:13:00] up again at the last
[1:13:03] day and you remember that they came and
[1:13:07] they pushed back on that because that's
[1:13:10] quite a declaration he say he's
[1:13:13] making and and they and they pushed back
[1:13:16] and they said is not this Jesus the son
[1:13:18] of Joseph whose father and mother we
[1:13:20] know how is it then that he saith you
[1:13:23] know I came down from heaven cuz he had
[1:13:24] said that I'm the bread that came down
[1:13:27] and and this is the Father's will which
[1:13:29] sent me that all which which of all them
[1:13:32] which he hath given me I should lose
[1:13:33] nothing but raised up in the last day
[1:13:36] and now he's speaking supernaturally
[1:13:38] from a supernatural truth they're
[1:13:42] rebutting that with carnal human
[1:13:44] reasoning you understand now what the
[1:13:48] reasoning was was not I mean it was true
[1:13:51] they did know him from a boy they did
[1:13:54] know his parents they didn't in another
[1:13:56] place they said don't we know isn't his
[1:13:57] brother Joseph and isn't his sister this
[1:13:59] one and that one and isn't he from
[1:14:01] Nazareth and then they argued over where
[1:14:02] he was born you know and so so we find
[1:14:05] out that excuse me Jesus doesn't come
[1:14:09] back and offer them a business card of
[1:14:13] who he is you know he doesn't give him
[1:14:15] you know his you know his his his
[1:14:18] WhatsApp you know he just he come he
[1:14:20] comes back to answer their objection no
[1:14:23] man can come to me
[1:14:25] you think what I said a minute ago was
[1:14:27] tough get ready no man can even come to
[1:14:31] me except the Father which hath sent me
[1:14:34] draw him and I will raise him up in the
[1:14:37] Last
[1:14:39] Day verse 45 it is written in the
[1:14:42] prophets and they shall all be taught of
[1:14:45] God every man therefore that hath heard
[1:14:47] and hath learned of the father cometh
[1:14:49] unto me so Jesus is now identifying back
[1:14:53] there under job when morning Stars sang
[1:14:56] together and sons of God shouted for joy
[1:14:58] as we were saying last time that brother
[1:15:01] brandom said the the sons of God saw the
[1:15:03] Plan of Redemption and I got so thrilled
[1:15:06] because when I thought about that I
[1:15:07] thought well if they saw a Plan of
[1:15:10] Redemption then they must have saw a
[1:15:11] redeemer and if they saw a redeemer then
[1:15:13] they saw a redeemed people and no wonder
[1:15:16] they're shouting and I'm still shouting
[1:15:18] about it
[1:15:22] today and then they kept pushing back on
[1:15:24] that again and they still kept resisting
[1:15:26] that with human reasoning he finally
[1:15:28] comes down to an end of the matter and
[1:15:31] he said in verse 65 therefore I said
[1:15:33] unto you that no man can come to me
[1:15:35] except it were given unto him of my
[1:15:37] father see you see you see what you're
[1:15:39] doing he was saying to them see what
[1:15:41] you'reall doing you're trying to I'm
[1:15:44] here telling you the secrets of eternal
[1:15:46] life I'm here telling you that all the
[1:15:48] father's giving me will come and I lose
[1:15:50] nothing I'll raise them up in the last
[1:15:51] day and you're arguing about my humanity
[1:15:54] and I'm trying to tell you that that you
[1:15:57] you've got a big
[1:15:59] problem you've got a big problem no man
[1:16:02] can come except my father draws
[1:16:05] him you understand and and so you stop
[1:16:09] using your
[1:16:11] reasoning stop trying to reason the word
[1:16:14] of God because no man can come except
[1:16:17] the Father which ha sent me draw him and
[1:16:19] I'll raise him up in the last day so
[1:16:23] stop doing that and finally when they
[1:16:25] just keep doing it and they keep
[1:16:28] offering human reasoning which Millions
[1:16:30] do then he find that it says therefore I
[1:16:33] said unto you this is why I said it no
[1:16:35] man can come to
[1:16:36] me I I get it I get why you're doing
[1:16:39] that because really the truth is no man
[1:16:42] can come to me except it were given to
[1:16:44] him of my father no man can come to me
[1:16:46] today who was not taught of my father
[1:16:48] back
[1:16:50] then I I disbelieve Satan's lie now
[1:16:53] because I disbelieved then I believe
[1:16:56] God's truth now because I believed it
[1:16:58] then I side with the Holy Ghost now
[1:17:00] because I took my stand with Michael
[1:17:02] back
[1:17:04] then so you can see a clear disconnect
[1:17:08] between the natural and spiritual mind
[1:17:11] one is mental reasoning in your head and
[1:17:14] the other is the thoughts from your
[1:17:16] heart and that's why the Bible says as a
[1:17:18] man thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:17:19] that's the real man see people can
[1:17:22] imagine they're Christians and because
[1:17:24] they go to a church and somehow they
[1:17:26] disregard that they use profanity and
[1:17:29] take social drinks and the women cut
[1:17:31] their hair and wear makeup and dress
[1:17:33] immorally and and they can carouse and
[1:17:35] Gamble and do all these kinds of things
[1:17:36] and still imagine they're a
[1:17:38] Christian see because they're good
[1:17:42] looking wholesome people that pay their
[1:17:43] taxes and and they must be good people
[1:17:47] see and I'm not even judging them at all
[1:17:49] listen friends can I can I just say this
[1:17:52] to you I don't know if I've said it here
[1:17:54] I preached too too often to know where I
[1:17:55] said what but let me just say in case I
[1:17:58] haven't said it here and if I have maybe
[1:17:59] you need to hear it
[1:18:00] again that when when I when I when a
[1:18:04] minister or when you are trying to
[1:18:08] declare the word of God to somebody and
[1:18:10] they say as they often will stop judging
[1:18:14] me you're judging me here's what I say
[1:18:17] to them I'm not judging you I'm judging
[1:18:20] me I'm judging that the life you live I
[1:18:23] don't want that I want something more
[1:18:25] than that what you are that's between
[1:18:27] you and God God's your judge not me but
[1:18:31] I'm I'm the Bible says I am to judge
[1:18:34] myself that I be not
[1:18:36] judged amen I judge myself that I be not
[1:18:40] judged and I judge that you have a
[1:18:42] misunderstanding of Christianity that I
[1:18:44] don't want to emulate it might sound to
[1:18:46] you like I'm judging you but I'm not I'm
[1:18:48] judging
[1:18:50] me what you are is between you and God
[1:18:53] you'll answer to God for it not me he's
[1:18:56] the Arbiter and I'm glad I'm so
[1:18:59] glad so so we find then that that that
[1:19:04] there's a clear disconnect then between
[1:19:06] the natural and the spiritual mind as
[1:19:09] I've said and say again one is your
[1:19:11] mental reasoning in your head and the
[1:19:13] other is the thoughts from your heart
[1:19:16] and that's what uh the problem is that
[1:19:20] when you're born
[1:19:22] again you can think from your
[1:19:25] head but and that's your human
[1:19:29] reasoning that's not where the enmity
[1:19:32] is that's not where the enmity is I have
[1:19:34] no problem thinking what two plus two is
[1:19:37] I can think and reason in my head you
[1:19:39] understand that's not where the enmity
[1:19:41] is the enmity is in my mind and my heart
[1:19:44] a fallen nature keeps it from
[1:19:46] acknowledging God and His word when I'm
[1:19:49] not before I'm born again that you see
[1:19:52] that's the part that's hindered by being
[1:19:54] being born with a fallen nature that and
[1:19:57] consequently then that's the place that
[1:20:00] only the holy spirit of God can bring
[1:20:03] life to you
[1:20:05] amen I could convince you
[1:20:08] here I can convince you that I could
[1:20:11] preach Hellfire and brimstone and and
[1:20:13] make you afraid I could convince you
[1:20:16] that there's going to be a tribulation
[1:20:18] and you might get left behind and you
[1:20:19] don't want to face that and every bit of
[1:20:21] that could be true that still don't give
[1:20:23] you eternal life I can't give you
[1:20:24] eternal life all I can do is tell you
[1:20:26] the truth and God is the only one who
[1:20:28] can give you eternal life the holy
[1:20:30] spirit is the only one who can come down
[1:20:31] into the mind of your heart and do and
[1:20:34] annihilate that old nature and bring you
[1:20:36] to a newness and you're and you're
[1:20:39] you're you're not no longer you're no
[1:20:42] longer conformed to the world but you're
[1:20:44] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:20:48] not this one this
[1:20:50] one see that's why people can sit in in
[1:20:54] churches for years and be
[1:20:57] multigenerational families in a church
[1:20:59] for years and they believe it here but
[1:21:01] there's no conversion
[1:21:03] here people can set in messes churches
[1:21:06] and believe God sent a prophet and
[1:21:08] believe it was William brandom but still
[1:21:10] not be converted
[1:21:14] here so it's in your heart not your head
[1:21:17] with reasoning when when when when that
[1:21:20] mind you know when when when it's not
[1:21:23] dominated by the holy ghost from a new
[1:21:26] birth your reasoning will guide you away
[1:21:30] from the fellowship with God Amen the
[1:21:33] reasoning the reasoning in your in your
[1:21:36] heart now not not your computer the
[1:21:38] reasoning in your heart as a man
[1:21:40] thinkthin his heart see and so that's
[1:21:43] where reasoning takes place that you're
[1:21:44] free moral agent you're Body Spirit and
[1:21:46] soul you've got a soul that Soul makes
[1:21:49] you a free moral agent that Soul gives
[1:21:51] you a mind in your heart it's a nature
[1:21:53] of the spirit you understand so it's as
[1:21:56] a man thinketh in his heart the problem
[1:21:58] is you're born with a fallen nature over
[1:22:00] that Spirit it has a wrong nature it has
[1:22:03] a fallen nature and Paul said we all at
[1:22:05] one time had our conversation in the
[1:22:07] lust of the Flesh and the things of the
[1:22:09] world not because in our brain we
[1:22:12] thought this is good or bad or ugly or
[1:22:14] whatever it's because it was our desires
[1:22:16] we wanted to be sinful or at least we
[1:22:18] wanted to be not godly see and so and
[1:22:22] and the only way to be really Godly is
[1:22:24] to to come by a new birth and let the
[1:22:25] Holy Spirit come down and change that
[1:22:28] and annihilate that old nature that was
[1:22:30] not your original nature he gave me back
[1:22:33] my original Nature by a gene of God that
[1:22:36] came to life when the light of God's
[1:22:38] word Shone on
[1:22:41] it see so so so when it's not dominated
[1:22:46] when your spirit is not dominated when
[1:22:48] the mind in your heart is not dominated
[1:22:51] by the holy ghost from a new birth then
[1:22:54] reasoning will guide you away from
[1:22:57] fellowship with God even God's family
[1:23:01] friends I mean think this through with
[1:23:03] me you ready to think again even God's
[1:23:07] family born of the spirit of God
[1:23:10] himself still have to cast down vain
[1:23:16] imaginations even with a new birth see
[1:23:20] even God's family born of the spirit of
[1:23:24] God himself still have to cast down vain
[1:23:28] imaginations even we have to Die daily
[1:23:32] to this unredeemed flesh and the mind
[1:23:37] and we have to choose to
[1:23:39] believe and
[1:23:43] confess not just believe but confess
[1:23:47] from our lips everything that God's word
[1:23:50] declares I have to believe it in my
[1:23:53] heart I have to confess with my lips and
[1:23:55] I have to make my feet walk according to
[1:23:58] its statutes this unredeemed body
[1:24:01] wouldn't even come to church if you
[1:24:03] didn't make it this unredeemed body
[1:24:06] would never read your Bible and pray if
[1:24:09] if there wasn't an inside man saying I
[1:24:12] need the nourishment of the word of God
[1:24:15] and you're going to sit in this chair
[1:24:16] and you're going to feed me you're going
[1:24:19] to go to that building and you're going
[1:24:20] to I'm going to Rejoice with the people
[1:24:23] and I'm going to glorify God and I'm
[1:24:25] going to gain strength and fellowship
[1:24:27] because I I got a whole new uh vision in
[1:24:30] mind I I'm not ending here I didn't
[1:24:32] start here I'm not ending here I'm
[1:24:35] living for the next
[1:24:38] life I mean listen friends 1 Peter 4:18
[1:24:42] if the righteous scarcely be saved where
[1:24:45] shall the ungodly and sinner
[1:24:51] appear I'm pretty sure you shouldn't
[1:24:53] take the Great of God
[1:24:57] lightly see because I mean if the
[1:25:00] righteous
[1:25:01] scarcely be saved if I believe all the
[1:25:04] word and confess it and live it and I'm
[1:25:06] scarcely saved where will you stand if
[1:25:10] you reason it at
[1:25:14] all God forbid you'd take it for granted
[1:25:17] just because you come to this church or
[1:25:19] believe God sent a prophet or my mom and
[1:25:22] dad and brother Jason love me you've got
[1:25:25] to work out your
[1:25:28] salvation with fear and trembling I'm
[1:25:31] sure Mom and Dad love you and I know
[1:25:34] brother Jason loves you I can tell you
[1:25:35] he does but that's not going to put you
[1:25:38] in glory as I said here a service or two
[1:25:41] ago if it was up to me I'd take all of
[1:25:42] you home with me to heaven but I can't
[1:25:44] do that I got to get me there and I've
[1:25:46] got to preach the gospel and I'm trying
[1:25:48] to get you there see so so now we come
[1:25:52] to
[1:25:55] this quote that I had been wanting to uh
[1:25:59] cover
[1:26:01] again you still good don't get nervous
[1:26:04] and get ready to
[1:26:10] close remember my title it's going to be
[1:26:13] important here in a minute opposing the
[1:26:16] Judgment of heaven and I said to you
[1:26:18] last time you think I mean when I think
[1:26:22] about it I think
[1:26:25] goodness if I'm made by God and created
[1:26:27] in His image and everybody else is too
[1:26:30] surely If Heaven rendered a judgment
[1:26:32] we'd all agree with
[1:26:34] it why is the world not do that why why
[1:26:38] is it such a small percentage of the God
[1:26:41] created humans that are willing to do
[1:26:43] that You' think that when there's any
[1:26:45] issue be it a social issue a political
[1:26:48] issue a Christ a Christian service to
[1:26:51] God issue uh any kind of an issue and
[1:26:54] God's word renders a verdict on it this
[1:26:57] is how men should act and conduct
[1:26:59] themselves this is how women should act
[1:27:00] and conduct themselves this is how
[1:27:01] teenagers should act and conduct
[1:27:02] themselves this is how preachers should
[1:27:04] act and conduct themselves this is how
[1:27:05] government should act and conduct
[1:27:06] themselves you'd think since it came
[1:27:08] from heaven from that Supernatural book
[1:27:13] You' think the whole world would go yes
[1:27:14] sir thank you we'll we'll get right on
[1:27:16] that am and yet they go in the opposite
[1:27:20] direction so now would you doubt what
[1:27:22] I'm preaching you today that it's got to
[1:27:24] take a supernatural birth you can't
[1:27:26] reason your way into eternal life if you
[1:27:30] can't reason your way into eternal life
[1:27:32] how you going to get eternal life
[1:27:33] reasoning any part of the word of God
[1:27:35] away you already can't reason yourself
[1:27:37] there if you believe every word of it
[1:27:40] it's still got to take the holy spirit
[1:27:42] that you've got to surrender to and die
[1:27:44] to see your good your goodness is no
[1:27:48] good he can't use it he can the only
[1:27:51] life God can receive is his
[1:27:55] own he's the only one holy enough to be
[1:27:58] in his own presence and that's why Jesus
[1:28:01] was no less than God in the form of a
[1:28:03] man see who lived out that life and now
[1:28:06] by faith in him we're joined back to
[1:28:08] ABRA Faith seed of Christ not the sons
[1:28:12] of Isaac not the seed of Isaac and
[1:28:14] that's brother bram's language not the
[1:28:16] seed of Isaac because all Israel is not
[1:28:19] Israel but the faith Seed of Abraham is
[1:28:22] not seeds plural as many but One
[1:28:26] Singular Christ seed behold the Christ
[1:28:30] seed see
[1:28:33] watch brother brandom now comes to
[1:28:36] Revelation 2 and20 notwithstanding I
[1:28:38] have a few things against thee because
[1:28:40] thou sufferest it means to
[1:28:42] tolerate that woman
[1:28:45] Jezebel my I I just want to stare at
[1:28:48] that word
[1:28:49] tolerate you should not
[1:28:52] tolerate this system
[1:28:54] am in your life in your activities in
[1:28:58] your worship it's not to be tolerated
[1:29:01] God's got a problem with people oh well
[1:29:04] I don't believe it but the problem is if
[1:29:06] you tolerate it if you allow it if
[1:29:10] you're friendly towards
[1:29:12] it notwithstanding I have a few things
[1:29:14] against thee because thou sufferest
[1:29:16] tolerate that woman Jezebel which
[1:29:18] calleth herself a prophetess this is
[1:29:20] obviously a church to teach and to
[1:29:23] seduce my servant to commit fornication
[1:29:26] and eat things sacrificed to Idols you
[1:29:28] say well I'm not Catholic oh awesome
[1:29:31] wonderful but but she had
[1:29:34] daughters and today there's in brother
[1:29:37] bram's day there's only 900 of them you
[1:29:39] talking about exponential growth now we
[1:29:42] have north of 33,000 of
[1:29:45] them countless Independence that's why
[1:29:48] you hear me say it's rather amusing but
[1:29:50] I mean it quite seriously when somebody
[1:29:52] tells me they disagree with the message
[1:29:54] of the hour I just say okay fine go get
[1:29:56] in
[1:29:56] line go that way go all the way to the
[1:30:00] end just hold up your flag and and let
[1:30:03] everybody know that you've got a version
[1:30:05] of The Gospel that disagrees with
[1:30:08] 32,999 and the
[1:30:13] message now with this verse I want you
[1:30:17] to drop down to verse 23 and see the
[1:30:19] proof of a great truth I've been
[1:30:21] bringing to your attention all along
[1:30:24] here's the verse and I will kill her
[1:30:26] children with death and all the churches
[1:30:29] shall know that I am he which searcheth
[1:30:32] the Reigns and
[1:30:33] hearts I have been saying right along
[1:30:36] that there are actually two churches
[1:30:39] though the spirit speaks to both of them
[1:30:42] in each age as though they were but one
[1:30:45] here here it is plainly stated that
[1:30:48] there are churches plural and it states
[1:30:51] just as plainly that some of those
[1:30:53] Church churches most evidently do not
[1:30:55] know that he is the one who searcheth
[1:30:58] the Reigns and the hearts see so they're
[1:31:01] they're using their human reasoning and
[1:31:03] they don't realize that he's searching
[1:31:06] their hearts see they think it's all
[1:31:10] about their their works and their
[1:31:11] decisions and it's not it's about
[1:31:13] whether or not they've been born
[1:31:16] again by the spirit of God that's the
[1:31:19] criteria you must be born again it's not
[1:31:23] about even correct teaching Satan don't
[1:31:25] care how right you are in your Doctrine
[1:31:29] he does not care how religious you are
[1:31:32] he knows if you fail to get that life
[1:31:35] you won't come up anyway he wins by
[1:31:38] default I don't want to let him win I
[1:31:40] don't want to see him win in me I don't
[1:31:42] want to see him win in
[1:31:48] you here it is plainly stated there are
[1:31:51] churches and it states just as plain
[1:31:53] okay
[1:31:54] uh it's most evident that they do not
[1:31:56] know that he is the one who searcheth
[1:31:58] the Reigns and hearts otherwise they
[1:32:00] would actually act and live like real
[1:32:02] Christians and not the nonsense we see
[1:32:05] today all right and we see a lot of it
[1:32:07] don't we he is going to prove to them
[1:32:09] that it is so now then now then what
[1:32:13] churches will be those that do not know
[1:32:16] this truth of course it is the false
[1:32:19] Vine group because the True Believers
[1:32:22] certainly know that judgment begins at
[1:32:25] the house of God and they being
[1:32:27] God-fearing judge themselves that they
[1:32:29] be not judged that's according to
[1:32:31] Paul now why it's a fair question it's a
[1:32:35] fair qu it's a logical this is sensible
[1:32:38] why does God call these churches his
[1:32:41] churches even though they are the false
[1:32:44] Vine the truth of the matter is that
[1:32:47] they are Christians but they are not
[1:32:49] Christians of the spirit they are
[1:32:52] Christians of the flesh they are bearing
[1:32:55] the name in vain according to Mark 7 how
[1:32:57] be it in vain do they worship me
[1:32:59] teaching for Doctrine the Commandments
[1:33:01] of men so if if if if people get
[1:33:05] offended that we identify them that way
[1:33:08] I'm only pointing out what Jesus
[1:33:10] said that's all I'm doing I'm his
[1:33:13] servant I'm just pointing out this is
[1:33:15] what he said in Mark 7:7 see so that's
[1:33:19] the danger that's the existential threat
[1:33:23] that in vain they worship him there's no
[1:33:25] greater danger no greater danger than
[1:33:28] for you to follow after that and believe
[1:33:30] that see
[1:33:33] amen but indeed they are Christians for
[1:33:37] what else could they be a muhammadan we
[1:33:39] would say more today a Muslim a
[1:33:41] muhammadan is a muhammadan that is his
[1:33:44] religion no matter how he lives no
[1:33:46] matter how he lives it because he
[1:33:48] subscribes in theory to what the Quran
[1:33:51] teaches so he's a he's a Muslim all
[1:33:53] right
[1:33:54] right in the same way a Christian is a
[1:33:58] Christian as long as he subscribes to
[1:34:00] the fact that Jesus is the son of God
[1:34:03] born of a virgin was crucified and died
[1:34:04] and rose again at that he is the savior
[1:34:07] of mankind
[1:34:09] Etc in fact in the leodan age there will
[1:34:12] be those who call themselves Christians
[1:34:15] because they subscribe to the Fine
[1:34:18] qualities of Jesus while reserving to
[1:34:21] themselves here comes the reasoning
[1:34:23] reserving to themselves the right to
[1:34:25] deny his deity Christian Scientists have
[1:34:29] done that already as well as multitudes
[1:34:32] who preach a social gospel amen see I
[1:34:36] mean this is why you can have a audience
[1:34:39] of 30,000 people and you never mention
[1:34:41] the cross or crucifixion or sin or
[1:34:43] anything you just have a big smile and
[1:34:45] 30,000 people will come to hear you
[1:34:47] preach a social gospel see because you
[1:34:50] tell them they're they're a good person
[1:34:52] and they need to live their best life
[1:34:54] now and I'm here to tell you this is not
[1:34:56] my best life now and there's no effort
[1:34:59] all the king's horses and all his men
[1:35:01] couldn't make this my best life I'm
[1:35:03] trying to get to my best life Hallelujah
[1:35:06] if this is my best life now I want a
[1:35:11] refund oh my if I'm in the Millennium I
[1:35:14] want my uh I want I want my money back
[1:35:19] see he is a nominal Christian and
[1:35:22] belongs to the church church but he is
[1:35:24] not a true or spiritual believer that
[1:35:28] kind of a Believer is one who has been
[1:35:30] baptized into the body of Christ and is
[1:35:33] a member of him but
[1:35:35] nonetheless it is in God's order that
[1:35:38] the tears grow up to grow up with the
[1:35:40] wheat and they are not to be uprooted
[1:35:43] that is the command of God so now this
[1:35:47] is why I'm this goes back to my title
[1:35:50] you know uh when we talk about opposing
[1:35:52] the Judgment of God this is God's
[1:35:54] decision that if you're going to be a
[1:35:56] real Christian you have to be one born
[1:35:58] of the spirit that's the that's the
[1:36:00] Judgment of Heaven you can't just be a
[1:36:03] nominal Christian you can't just
[1:36:05] subscribe to the Fine qualities of Jesus
[1:36:09] you can't just believe he was the son of
[1:36:11] God and died to save Sinners because the
[1:36:12] devil believes
[1:36:14] that you understand this is the Judgment
[1:36:17] this is the command of God don't oppose
[1:36:21] the Judgment of Heaven by continuing to
[1:36:24] believe it doesn't matter it it
[1:36:28] matters you have to be filled with the
[1:36:31] Holy Spirit you have to be changed by a
[1:36:34] supernatural power
[1:36:39] Hallelujah their day for binding and
[1:36:41] burning is coming but not yet so the
[1:36:44] spirit is speaking to this mixed group
[1:36:47] on the one hand he is praising and on
[1:36:50] the other hand he is rebuking he has has
[1:36:53] told what is right with the True
[1:36:55] Believer now he warns what the false
[1:36:58] Vine must do if it is to stand Justified
[1:37:02] before the Lord you can take that down
[1:37:04] for the mark that's what he that's the
[1:37:07] Judgment of Heaven all right you still
[1:37:12] good all right
[1:37:15] now their day of binding and burning is
[1:37:18] coming so they're being bound that's
[1:37:20] happening now is they're being Bound for
[1:37:25] the burning that's what the whole that's
[1:37:28] ecumenicalism we're all one and they're
[1:37:31] all trying to homogenize everything into
[1:37:34] one and they're disregarding the true
[1:37:36] New Birth of the spirit of God this is
[1:37:39] one of the things that you know that has
[1:37:42] caused easy believism to be believed and
[1:37:45] even encroaches into message pulpits so
[1:37:48] I'm shocked to say and and we we've lost
[1:37:51] the sense of the oldfashioned bapt ISM
[1:37:53] of the Holy Ghost don't ever lose that
[1:37:55] Beth Tabernacle don't ever lose that
[1:37:58] sense of the oldfashioned are you
[1:38:00] willing to be oldfashioned and have an
[1:38:04] oldfashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:06] in
[1:38:09] fire see so the the and and and one of
[1:38:13] the things that has contributed to that
[1:38:16] believe it or not was the two Messengers
[1:38:18] that went to
[1:38:20] Sodom and now that's scriptural because
[1:38:22] if you'll notice what the two Messengers
[1:38:24] that went to Sodom did is they blinded
[1:38:26] the people they didn't convert them they
[1:38:28] blinded them so that they actually
[1:38:30] couldn't find their way to safety and
[1:38:32] perished you
[1:38:34] understand Billy Graham's hour of
[1:38:37] decision
[1:38:40] program one of the certainly one of
[1:38:43] Christian radio's most beloved and long
[1:38:47] lasting my goodness it went almost
[1:38:49] three4 of a
[1:38:50] century uh one of the most long lasting
[1:38:53] and loved uh programs um for 74 75 years
[1:38:59] something like that Billy Graham when he
[1:39:02] began it he didn't want to do it and
[1:39:03] they said brother you know they said we
[1:39:05] will brother Billy we will we'll make
[1:39:07] sure that the funding is there and he
[1:39:09] said oh well if you can get the funding
[1:39:11] and he he admits that he said it just
[1:39:13] jokingly and then they show up to him
[1:39:15] we've got the funding and he was stunned
[1:39:18] and he got back to his hotel room that
[1:39:20] night this is this is his own words
[1:39:22] stunned I bowed my head and said in
[1:39:25] silent prayer said Graham emotions so
[1:39:28] overcame me that I could not think
[1:39:30] straight clearly the funds had come from
[1:39:33] God the team soon signed with ABC and
[1:39:36] the first broadcast was live from the
[1:39:38] Billy Graham crusade in Atlanta Georgia
[1:39:41] on November the 5th
[1:39:45] 1950 now Billy Graham had a
[1:39:49] conundrum and brother brandham caught it
[1:39:52] listening to him preach live
[1:39:54] and he was he was upgrading the
[1:39:56] Ministerial Association they were at a
[1:39:58] Minister's breakfast and Billy was
[1:40:00] upgrading the the ministers for not
[1:40:03] doing their job and the evidence was his
[1:40:07] evidence misguided took a prophet to
[1:40:10] know what the real problem was but his
[1:40:12] his accusation against the ministry
[1:40:15] Association was that I come into a city
[1:40:18] and I get 30,000 converts to Christ I
[1:40:22] get what he said was I get 30,000
[1:40:24] decisions for Christ and I come back a
[1:40:28] year later and I can't find
[1:40:30] 30 and brother brandham said oh I was
[1:40:32] just sitting there burning so bad he
[1:40:34] said I wanted to say to him he said not
[1:40:35] that I count myself like that highly
[1:40:37] esteemed man he said but I just wanted
[1:40:39] to say to him Dr Graham you know to what
[1:40:42] what happened to Paul when he went in
[1:40:44] and 130 and come back and there's
[1:40:46] hundreds he said because you don't take
[1:40:48] them all the way to the Holy Ghost all
[1:40:50] you do is tell them to make a decision
[1:40:53] and that's why you don't take them all
[1:40:55] the way into the new birth and that's
[1:40:57] what a prophet of the age was trying to
[1:41:00] so that we don't fall victim to that you
[1:41:04] understand so it was Graham's conundrum
[1:41:07] where 30,000 would go down to 30 and
[1:41:11] late in in
[1:41:13] 1953 the Southern Baptist convention and
[1:41:16] I had to go to the bigram website and
[1:41:18] Wikipedi in different things and run
[1:41:19] some research on this to make sure I had
[1:41:21] all the facts straight but in 1953 the
[1:41:25] SBC or the Southern Baptist convention
[1:41:27] they came up with a new slogan to kick
[1:41:30] off a renewed campaign for evangelism
[1:41:33] and it was called a million more and 54
[1:41:36] now I know we say million more and 44
[1:41:38] and that's because brother Brandon
[1:41:40] inverted that he actually the first time
[1:41:41] he ever said it that was that was it you
[1:41:44] know that was late in 53 in the spring
[1:41:47] of 54 brother brandham said what's all
[1:41:48] this a million more than 54 so when he
[1:41:51] first heard it he said it right and then
[1:41:53] other times he would he would say a
[1:41:54] million more in and 44 I mean 54 and
[1:41:58] then another place I found him he said a
[1:42:00] million more in 34 44 54 something like
[1:42:04] that and then after that he just got
[1:42:06] stuck on 44 million more than 44 and he
[1:42:08] said that for years all the way through
[1:42:10] to the end of his life but it was
[1:42:11] actually in 1954 which is how he first
[1:42:13] said it which was the accurate uh
[1:42:16] rendering and so in in late 53 they came
[1:42:19] up with this new slogan a million more
[1:42:21] in 54 and though it was not a direct
[1:42:24] Ministry initiative of the Billy Graham
[1:42:27] uh evangelism uh Evangelistic ministry
[1:42:30] Billy Graham actually is credited for
[1:42:33] playing a very significant supporting
[1:42:36] role to that Southern Baptist convention
[1:42:38] slogan because the aim of the SBC was to
[1:42:42] actually add 1 million members to their
[1:42:45] churches in 1954 through increased
[1:42:48] evangelism and Outreach and they went
[1:42:50] door too in many communities didn't
[1:42:52] matter what kind they got in they just
[1:42:54] wanted a number see that's what brother
[1:42:56] Brandon was so critical of you would
[1:42:58] never say William Brandon was
[1:43:00] criticizing evangelism my goodness the
[1:43:02] man evangelized seven times around the
[1:43:04] world but he was critical of the fact
[1:43:06] that you're not you're just getting
[1:43:08] decisions you're not getting people you
[1:43:11] get you get you get as brother brandham
[1:43:13] said they are Christians naturally
[1:43:16] speaking but that's not a spiritual
[1:43:18] believer see and so Graham's widely
[1:43:22] known the article goes on to say his
[1:43:24] widely known Evangelistic Crusades
[1:43:27] influenced and helped or uh energized
[1:43:30] that campaign indirectly but I I I
[1:43:33] thought to myself the that campaign
[1:43:37] didn't solve the
[1:43:39] conundrum it didn't fix the
[1:43:42] conundrum the I I if the new birth
[1:43:45] listen friends if the new birth was the
[1:43:48] product of a human mental achievement by
[1:43:52] a natural decision that you could make
[1:43:55] then then making a decision for Christ
[1:43:58] is all you'd need you see and so but and
[1:44:03] and Billy Graham wouldn't have had the
[1:44:05] the issue of people falling away from
[1:44:08] 30,000 to 30 if all it took was a mental
[1:44:12] decision then that's all you need to do
[1:44:13] and they wouldn't have lost you know
[1:44:15] 29,000 and some odd so the mystery of
[1:44:19] redemption was that's why it was not
[1:44:21] given to Billy Graham as great man as he
[1:44:23] was and I believe he was a saint of God
[1:44:25] and I believe he'll be in heaven but he
[1:44:28] was not the seventh angel given the
[1:44:30] mystery of
[1:44:31] redemption God had something better for
[1:44:34] you and I Hallelujah friends and that's
[1:44:37] what we've come down to today God has
[1:44:40] shown us the true way the straight and
[1:44:43] narrow way the full way and now now you
[1:44:46] say but I but I'm a free moral agent can
[1:44:48] I just put this thought in your head and
[1:44:50] I'm GNA let you go home with this one
[1:44:51] today
[1:44:55] you're free moral
[1:44:57] agent
[1:44:59] but if you're not born again then you're
[1:45:03] limited in your free moral
[1:45:06] agency because you actually if you're
[1:45:08] not born again can't choose to live
[1:45:11] pleasing to
[1:45:13] God understand you can't even choose to
[1:45:16] believe the whole word you can't make a
[1:45:18] decision to that so now where's your
[1:45:21] freedom Now where's your freedom moral
[1:45:23] agency the only time a human being is
[1:45:26] actually fully free moral agent is when
[1:45:30] he's been
[1:45:31] transformed by the renewing of his mind
[1:45:34] and now he can actually be free to
[1:45:37] become everything God ever Envision now
[1:45:41] I have freedom I'm under the law of
[1:45:44] Liberty stand with me friend stand with
[1:45:46] me I how many want to be under the law
[1:45:48] of Liberty today not a not a man-made
[1:45:51] law not a regul book not a not uh plans
[1:45:55] and spec sheet it's not about that he's
[1:45:57] not trying to build me that way I'm
[1:46:00] Lively Stones you're built up in the
[1:46:02] power of God by the word through the
[1:46:04] Holy Spirit by becoming a believer of
[1:46:08] every word of
[1:46:11] God this is what makes you a free moral
[1:46:15] agent so the argument that people walk
[1:46:17] away from the word and say now I'm free
[1:46:20] that's the exact opposite is true
[1:46:23] now they're not free to be in the image
[1:46:25] of God you see the only way that you are
[1:46:31] totally a free moral agent is when you
[1:46:34] have been converted by the baptism of
[1:46:38] the holy spirit amen praise the Lord
[1:46:41] there's more I would love to say but
[1:46:43] we'll stop there for today told you I
[1:46:45] wasn't going to preach
[1:46:47] long amen praise the Lord you love the
[1:46:50] Lord I hope that the holy spirit is
[1:46:54] satisfied with with your response to the
[1:46:58] word today and uh here on and online and
[1:47:03] anyone associated with bethl Tabernacle
[1:47:06] I hope that the holy spirit is satisfied
[1:47:09] with your heart's response but I've been
[1:47:12] satisfied with this material so if I
[1:47:16] have will inform me that he's still not
[1:47:20] satisfied with your willingness to
[1:47:22] accept it and to believe it and to cast
[1:47:25] down this easy believism nonsense that
[1:47:28] it doesn't matter and that we're all one
[1:47:30] we're not we're not we're not that's not
[1:47:32] true we are A peculiar people called of
[1:47:36] God to be an example in the world that
[1:47:39] the world is prophesied not to follow
[1:47:42] but but God honors it amen amen let's
[1:47:47] pray Lord we thank you today for your
[1:47:50] word I thank you that I was able Lord to
[1:47:53] stay on track and stay on target and I
[1:47:56] must say that I feel satisfied that I
[1:47:59] was Lord and I I could see more that I
[1:48:03] thought that I would say today but I
[1:48:05] started out not knowing how far I would
[1:48:07] get and I feel quite finished for today

[1:48:12] children Lord near and far help us to
[1:48:15] have it help our young people to
[1:48:18] understand this Lord they must see you

[1:48:23] creature said and John said when he had
[1:48:26] opened this seal and I heard a living
[1:48:28] creature say come and see and they
[1:48:31] opened another seal and he said I heard
[1:48:33] another living creature say come and see
[1:48:36] and he went all the way through seal

[1:49:22] was finished finished but we didn't
