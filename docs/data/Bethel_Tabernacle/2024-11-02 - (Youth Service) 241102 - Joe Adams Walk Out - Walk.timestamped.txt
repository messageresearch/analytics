[34:43] I'll let you know when I set my clock I
[34:44] had said it yet we're going to look here
[34:47] acts 12 and verse1 it says now about the
[34:49] time Herod the king stretched forth his
[34:51] hands to Vex certain of the church and
[34:54] he killed James the brother of John with
[34:56] a sword and because he saw that it
[34:58] pleased the Jews he proceeded further to
[35:01] take Peter also then were the days of un
[35:03] leaven bread and when he had apprehended
[35:05] him he put him in prison and delivered
[35:07] him to the
[35:09] for uh qurans of soldiers to keep him
[35:13] after Easter to bring him forth to the
[35:15] people Peter therefore was kept in
[35:17] prison but prayer was made without
[35:19] ceasing of the church unto God for him
[35:22] and when Herod would have brought him
[35:24] forth the same night Peter was sleeping
[35:27] between Two Soldiers bound with two
[35:29] chains and the keepers before the door
[35:31] kept to prison and behold the angel of
[35:34] the Lord came upon him and a light
[35:36] shined in the prison and he smoked Peter
[35:39] on the side and raised him up saying
[35:41] arise up quickly and his chains fell off
[35:44] of him off of his hands and the angel
[35:47] said unto him G thyself and B
[35:50] on so he did and he said unto him cast
[35:54] thy G about thee and follow me and he
[35:56] went out and he followed him not that it
[35:59] was true which was
[36:00] done that he saw a vision and when they
[36:03] were past the first and second ward they
[36:05] came unto the Iron Gate that leadth into
[36:07] the city which opened to them of its own
[36:09] accord and they went out and they passed
[36:11] on through the street for for withth the
[36:14] angel departed from him and Peter was
[36:17] come to himself he said now I know of
[36:18] assy that the Lord has sent his Angel
[36:21] and has delivered me out of the hand of
[36:22] Herod and from from all the expectation
[36:25] of the people of the Jews you can have
[36:27] your seats tonight this thing keeps
[36:30] cutting out is that is that just me use
[36:33] use that Brad's going to switch to that
[36:35] I'm G to switch to
[36:39] this no we're gnaas
[37:12] is for clothing and was clad with Zeal
[37:16] as a cloak verse 19 so they that fear
[37:19] the name of the
[37:21] Lord a awesome those that fear the name
[37:24] of the Lord from the West and his glory
[37:25] from the rising of the sun when the
[37:27] enemy shall come in like a flood the
[37:29] spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[37:32] standard against him so many of us at
[37:35] some point in our lives whether you're a
[37:37] young person here on the front rows
[37:38] tonight or whether you're an older
[37:40] person sitting back in the back at some
[37:43] point of your Christian Journey you have
[37:45] faced an onslaught of the enemy all you
[37:48] going to have to work with me tonight
[37:49] I'm a preacher so we we find that Satan
[37:52] has come and he's attacked and you have
[37:54] faced his attack you've encountered his
[37:57] accus ations you've endured his
[37:59] sicknesses you've come against his
[38:01] schemes you you you you know you faced
[38:03] these things and some of us even the
[38:05] great of us we have we have fall victim
[38:08] to his lies yes yes even the great of us
[38:12] even the great preachers that we hold in
[38:14] such a high level they have even Fallen
[38:16] victim to Satan's Onslaught but I want
[38:19] you to know that's how the enemy does in
[38:21] a great battle plan if the enemy can
[38:23] surround you on all sides he knows that
[38:26] the victory is is about to happen and
[38:28] that's exactly what the enemy tries to
[38:31] do he tries to attack you on all sides
[38:33] he attacks your body he attacks your
[38:35] mind he'll attack your family he'll
[38:37] attack your relationships he'll attack
[38:39] your ministry he'll attack your church
[38:41] he'll come in and tell you things are
[38:43] false when in fact they are true he'll
[38:45] tell you you don't have the Holy Ghost
[38:47] when in fact your life lines up with it
[38:49] he does all these things to come against
[38:52] you to destroy your
[38:53] walk right now we find out that the
[38:56] enemy comes in like a flood and we
[38:59] understand the Bible tells us and I
[39:01] believe the writers put the comma in the
[39:02] wrong spot cuz it says when the enemy
[39:05] comes in like a flood we think the enemy
[39:07] is the flood but really in fact the
[39:10] Bible should read like this when the
[39:11] enemy comes in come like a flood the
[39:15] power of God come on somebody like a
[39:18] flood the spirit of the Lord will raise
[39:20] up a standard against it come on there's
[39:24] not one of us here tonight that hadn't
[39:26] faced the own s of the enemy but you're
[39:28] here tonight you're still standing
[39:30] tonight why because the spirit of God
[39:33] have lifted up a standard for you do you
[39:37] believe that
[39:38] tonight and I love what he says in verse
[39:41] 17 here it says he put on righteousness
[39:44] as a breastplate and a Helen of
[39:46] Salvation was upon his head and he put
[39:48] on the garments of Vengeance your God
[39:51] means
[39:52] business come on this ain't some panty
[39:54] waste pushover God he puts on the
[39:57] breastplate of righteousness he puts on
[39:59] garments of Vengeance and he's come to
[40:01] this service tonight to fight your
[40:03] battle all
[40:05] right oh
[40:08] Hallelujah notice according to their
[40:11] deeds accordingly he will repay oh I
[40:15] love that come on devil attack tonight
[40:20] cuz I got a greater
[40:21] God come on with it come on with your
[40:24] own s cuz there's going to be a a
[40:26] standard living lifted
[40:28] tonight yes and I just love how this
[40:31] says they they say that this phrase here
[40:34] it reminds them of a great impetuous
[40:36] stream or Force because water has an
[40:39] ability to not only wash out it only has
[40:42] ability to only to wipe out but it also
[40:45] brother Jason has the ability to cut
[40:47] deep cords and deep deep Canyons in in
[40:50] as we see out there in Arizona uh the
[40:53] Grand Canyon there was made by
[40:56] water and I want you to know that the
[40:58] Holy Ghost can come into this service
[41:00] tonight though you just came from a
[41:02] great camp meeting and yet you may have
[41:04] left there with something suppressed
[41:06] something pushed back but I want you to
[41:07] know that the spirit of the Lord can
[41:09] come in tonight and wash things out of
[41:11] your life WIP things out of your home it
[41:14] can come in those things that you have
[41:15] suppressed it can cut deep inside and
[41:18] rip those things
[41:19] outen things that happened to you maybe
[41:22] when you was a child things that
[41:23] happened to you that you didn't think
[41:25] anything about but it's hindering you
[41:26] from walking with the Lord he hindering
[41:29] you from giving your all come on young
[41:31] people get with it
[41:33] tonight the power of the word of God is
[41:37] a surgeon's hand and it can cut in and
[41:39] cut
[41:41] out I remember just about five years ago
[41:44] my son and I went to make a Facebook uh
[41:50] uh Marketplace buy all right cuz I did a
[41:53] lot of buying and selling back in the
[41:54] day and I I'm thinking I'm going to get
[41:56] my daughter this was Lauren was probably
[41:58] 13 maybe it's been a lot longer than
[42:00] that anyway I was going to get her a new
[42:02] the iPhone
[42:04] x this is a long time ago right iPhone x
[42:08] and the guy had it and he had a good
[42:09] price on it 200 bucks man I ain't
[42:12] passing that up it was so great that I
[42:14] got out of the deer stand early and I
[42:16] went me and my son he was probably what
[42:18] was Joseph 14 13 14 years old when we
[42:22] get there and I wait in this parking lot
[42:24] it was sketchy yeah hey there an iPhone
[42:27] 10 was worth it a sketchy part of
[42:30] town but this guy finally came and I
[42:33] drove a Mercedes at the time and uh I
[42:36] pulled up and somehow my do is unlocked
[42:40] wow and so I meet this guy he had a
[42:43] hoodie on pulled over his head he gets
[42:45] in my back seat and brother Jason he
[42:48] pulls out a knife this long and he holds
[42:51] it up to my
[42:52] throat give me all your
[42:54] money and I started fighting with them
[42:56] put is I could have took the little
[42:59] fella I mean hey I was like hold on dog
[43:02] you in the wrong car not
[43:05] today but I was pushing his hand away as
[43:08] I pushed his hand away the knife got
[43:10] closer to my son and I realized he said
[43:13] I'll stab you I'll kill you right here
[43:15] give me all your money I'm like 250
[43:17] bucks $200 ain't worth it so I reached
[43:19] in my console and gave him the money and
[43:21] he got out but I want you to know that
[43:23] has traumatized my son today he still
[43:27] don't like he doesn't like being in big
[43:29] crowds he still don't like being in
[43:31] certain areas of neighborhoods it
[43:32] traumatized him but what am I telling
[43:35] you that the Holy Spirit can come even
[43:38] tonight something that maybe you didn't
[43:40] allow you didn't want to happen but it
[43:42] happened when you was a child and it
[43:44] happened and it tormented you and it
[43:45] destroyed you and it's keeping you from
[43:47] giving your off the Holy Ghost tonight
[43:50] has the opportunity and the power to cut
[43:52] those things out of your life that's
[43:55] true the word of God is powerful it's
[43:58] quick it's sharper than a two-edged
[44:00] sword and we have a promise in the word
[44:04] that God will raise a standard on our
[44:08] behalf yes that's not up for debate on
[44:12] he will raise the standard whether
[44:15] you're young whether you're old whether
[44:17] you're blind whether you're
[44:19] whether you're crazy if you are a
[44:21] Believer if you are a son of God and a
[44:23] daughter of God tonight he will raise
[44:26] your standard for you he will not allow
[44:29] the enemy to come against his little
[44:31] bride he will fight for you let me tell
[44:34] you there's not a man of God here
[44:36] tonight a husband that won't stand for
[44:38] their wife won't stand for their
[44:40] children and you think God ain't going
[44:41] to stand for
[44:43] it Hallelujah that's true we find here
[44:48] that the children of Israel when they
[44:49] left
[44:50] Egypt I got to kind of pace
[44:55] myself when they left Egypt man they
[44:59] thought it was great this is great we
[45:01] moving but sometimes you move in the
[45:04] wrong
[45:05] places sometimes where God leads you you
[45:09] think man this is what serving the
[45:11] Lord's about look at me I'm in a
[45:13] trap so here they're leaving and now
[45:17] they at a place brother Jason they got
[45:19] mountains on this side they got
[45:21] mountains on that side they got a great
[45:23] big vast River in front of them or a sea
[45:27] in front of them and then they got an
[45:29] angry
[45:31] Pharaoh an angry Pharaoh now he's
[45:34] repenting that he let them go and we
[45:37] find here that God LED them down to that
[45:41] area yeah God is the one that ordained
[45:45] he had a blueprint already printed out
[45:47] and said Moses I know you don't know
[45:48] where you're going but I'm leading you
[45:50] right here this is where I'm bringing
[45:52] you to because God was about to display
[45:55] his power God was about to display the
[45:57] standard being lifted and when pharaoh
[46:00] and his army was coming what did God do
[46:02] God spoke to Moses he said come on Moses
[46:05] quit crying to me about this situation
[46:07] quit talking to me about it I've given
[46:09] you the word I put thus sayith the Lord
[46:11] in your mouth you are my voice you are
[46:13] my mouthpiece now speak to the children
[46:16] of Israel that they'll go forward in
[46:18] Victory and what did he do he spoke to
[46:20] the Red Sea and their sea split open and
[46:23] they walked through on dry ground all
[46:25] right yeah come on I'm talking to other
[46:28] believers this morning mayy you got a
[46:30] situation you don't know how you're
[46:31] going to get through all you see is a
[46:33] trouble on this side all you see is the
[46:35] mountains on that side all you hear is a
[46:37] threat to the enemy from behind you but
[46:39] I want you to know God has promised I'll
[46:41] raise a standard I'll bring you through
[46:44] I'll see you through your red trial I'll
[46:46] see you through to Victory I'll bring
[46:48] you to the other
[46:50] side true brother I like how brother B
[46:53] will say when all hell has turned loose
[46:55] on you
[46:57] all of Heaven has turned loose
[47:01] also when all hell has turned
[47:05] loose all of Heaven think about all of
[47:08] Heaven for just a
[47:09] minute every Prophet that's already on
[47:11] the other
[47:13] side think about every believer already
[47:16] made it on the other
[47:18] side think about your Samson your jeffa
[47:21] these great these great judges Through
[47:24] the Bible think about some of the great
[47:25] women the the ray and these different
[47:27] ones they're already on the other side
[47:31] they made it why can't
[47:34] you they trusted why can't we that's
[47:38] good so we find all of Heaven they're
[47:40] there cheering you on whether you hear
[47:42] it or
[47:45] not Satan may think he's got the upper
[47:47] hand and make you think he's got you
[47:48] right where he wants you but God had a
[47:52] setup set this scene up just like he's
[47:55] setting this one up in leod DEA
[47:58] he knows exactly what he's doing and
[48:00] when all hell's turn loose on You Hell
[48:03] may be against you hell may be around
[48:05] you he may be trying to draw you in and
[48:06] take you out but I want you to know
[48:08] tonight all of Heaven is for you all of
[48:11] Heaven is behind you this ministry and
[48:13] this ministry team here at Beth
[48:15] Tabernacle is for you this morning or
[48:17] this evening this church is for you the
[48:19] message is for you the Holy Ghost is for
[48:21] you moms and dads are for you we're for
[48:24] you tonight when Heaven is here tell you
[48:27] all the shackles of hell can break away
[48:30] tonight and he's here tonight he's here
[48:33] to bring you into a greater atmosphere a
[48:36] greater relationship he's here to take
[48:38] you out of that prison that you've been
[48:40] in that prison of unbelief and walk you
[48:43] out to Freedom all right Amen brother
[48:46] now we understand that the greatest
[48:47] battle ever placed or ever fought was in
[48:49] the human mind and we find there that
[48:51] Satan is trying to test the power and
[48:53] the strength against you know his
[48:55] strength and his power over God's
[48:57] strength and God's power and he comes
[48:59] and he brings a tax on you to see if you
[49:01] really believe what you say claim that
[49:03] you
[49:04] believe do you really believe he's a
[49:06] Healer do you really believe he's a
[49:07] deliverer do you really believe he can
[49:09] give the Holy Ghost to young people in
[49:10] this day and age yes sir when so many
[49:12] have walked away so many have forgot
[49:15] about this message they turned their
[49:16] back against this message do you really
[49:18] believe that it really is the voice of
[49:20] God for this last day and so Satan will
[49:23] put you under attack he'll put you under
[49:25] his microscope he He he'll aim every gun
[49:28] in Hell on you but what am I telling you
[49:31] tonight let me tell you he can't have
[49:33] enough to stop what God's already
[49:35] deposited on the inside of a Son of God
[49:37] tonight God put a seed on the inside and
[49:40] no matter what that seed has to go
[49:42] through no matter what attack it has to
[49:44] face God is determined to see that seed
[49:47] to
[49:49] Victory and I believe I'm talking to
[49:51] seeds tonight young people older
[49:54] people that are going to make the
[49:56] victory there are going to be the
[49:57] Victorious ones so Satan will come and
[50:00] he'll attack you with reasoning and
[50:02] doubts and try to get you to whether you
[50:04] truly believe the word or not he test
[50:07] you to see if you believe what you claim
[50:09] to
[50:11] believe we find brother B would tell us
[50:13] in the greatest battle ever fought when
[50:15] this great battle started on Earth there
[50:17] had to be a mutual meeting
[50:19] place there had to be a place selected
[50:22] for the battle to begin for the battle
[50:24] to rage and that Battleground be in the
[50:27] human mind yes now how many of you young
[50:32] people ever had a mind
[50:34] battle the rest of y'all not here
[50:38] tonight we've all all right now let's
[50:41] young people turn around look at these
[50:42] older people in the back I know they old
[50:43] they look decrepit but that's okay how
[50:46] many you've ever had a battle mine
[50:47] battle old people oh my it was a lot
[50:50] more old hands go
[50:52] up see that's something that we all must
[50:55] face
[50:57] why the mind you ever wondered about
[50:59] that that little gray
[51:01] matter you know if you could peel your
[51:03] now we ain't going to go there I just
[51:06] think that little gray matter matters so
[51:09] much that Satan chose the mind but
[51:13] thankfully God chose your heart yes but
[51:17] see he chose the mind because he knows
[51:19] that's where the place where decisions
[51:21] are made and so what does Satan try to
[51:24] do Satan tries to influence your
[51:27] decisions Satan will get you on every
[51:30] social media platform oh you thinking
[51:33] man they gonna like this click click and
[51:35] you got no likes oh now you done had a
[51:38] bad day now you're in now you're in
[51:40] depression because nobody liked you like
[51:42] you thought this was a cool pick look at
[51:44] me haha click click click and ain't
[51:47] nobody liking your
[51:49] click and now you all down in the dumps
[51:52] now you all depressed now you all weary
[51:55] what am I telling you but because that's
[51:57] the place where decisions are made
[51:59] because Satan knows if he can get you to
[52:02] to to doubt the word of God and D doubt
[52:04] your position as a Son of God then
[52:07] you'll lose the power you'll lose the
[52:10] victory gory amen true come on young
[52:14] people get with it tonight come on
[52:17] notice decisions are made that we
[52:19] realize whether you're younger old we

[52:32] anxiety nervousness I me you can't
[52:35] hardly do anything without just being so
[52:37] nervous and introverted and you just
[52:38] don't want to be around people some of
[52:40] you it's
[52:42] fear find more and more today brother
[52:44] Jason this lust and pornography and
[52:47] passions not just for the men but also
[52:49] for the girls we find that the battle
[52:52] some of us faces unbelief and reasoning
[52:55] and doubts and of that nature or maybe
[52:57] some of your battle is you know you're a
[52:59] cynical person or you're you know always
[53:01] a Critic nothing worse than a Critic
[53:04] right when you try to have a good
[53:06] service AG look at the them young people
[53:08] just jumping and hollering and hooping
[53:10] and everything you know what they ain't
[53:11] got nothing we didn't do that my day
[53:13] well your day was
[53:14] dead it's a different day come on
[53:18] there's a different day come on quit
[53:20] going back to your day and let them have
[53:22] their day the prophet of God said every
[53:25] generation shall have their opportunity
[53:27] at the word of God and that's why you
[53:29] had a camp meeting last week or week
[53:31] before last is so that this generation
[53:34] can have a move of the Holy Spirit they
[53:36] can have their chance at a Revival they
[53:38] can have their chance at the word of God
[53:40] they can walk out of their prison
[53:43] sales and live a life of
[53:46] Victory I say give them an opportunity
[53:48] give them a chance to walk out give them
[53:50] a chance to be free Satan's doing
[53:53] everything he can can to bind them and
[53:55] to keep them and to hold them why can't
[53:56] we give them an opportunity to be free
[53:58] tonight why can't we give them an
[54:00] opportunity to have the the victory in
[54:02] their lives in this hour but no we done
[54:04] got so starchy so formal so
[54:08] powerless well we don't want the word to
[54:10] do what the word says it'll do let me
[54:13] tell you the word may not work in your
[54:15] church but it works in my church it
[54:17] works in this church it'll heal the sick
[54:20] it'll save the Lost it'll grab a young
[54:22] person it'll snatch him from the fire
[54:24] the word still works
[54:27] so give our young people an opportunity
[54:29] for it all
[54:32] right think about some of us we battle
[54:36] some of us we battle
[54:38] suicide let's just be real tonight
[54:41] brother Dennis about five years ago I
[54:42] was we were having our special
[54:45] meetings and I was working at the time
[54:47] and man I was just in that place I'm
[54:51] being a little bit transparent if I'm
[54:52] too much well you just have to forgive
[54:54] me but I I was just in a state of
[54:57] depression and you know and it Satan get
[55:00] you on all kind of things life was good
[55:02] it wasn't bad but you know he just get
[55:04] you in that low Point you're all alone
[55:05] and you're working so much and all this
[55:08] kind of stuff but I drove out of that
[55:10] meeting brother Ron Spencer preached
[55:13] that night he preached on jealousy at
[55:15] the
[55:18] altar I got in my car brother Jason and
[55:21] I pulled out into the main Highway and
[55:23] there was an 18-wheeler coming and a
[55:25] voice said pull right right in front of
[55:28] it see how the enemy loves to
[55:31] work you young people think well that's
[55:33] just me nobody understands me yeah we do
[55:37] we may be old and have no hair but we
[55:40] understand because we may not face your
[55:43] battle but we have our own battle and
[55:46] Satan's trying to destroy us just like
[55:48] he's trying to destroy
[55:52] you that voice said pull out in front of
[55:54] that 18 Willer you will not even be
[56:00] missed and can I tell you for a split
[56:02] second brother Dennis I thought about
[56:05] it then I thought about my wife my
[56:07] children my church those that'll be
[56:11] missed see Satan loves to put that on a
[56:15] Believer cuz we face all of us Face mind
[56:20] battles cuz that's the place where
[56:23] decisions are made but says the mind
[56:25] accepts the life which is in the word of
[56:28] God and there brings that life so your
[56:31] mind now not just the matter of it but
[56:34] not but the mind just hears the word and
[56:36] receives the word like he was telling me
[56:39] reasons and said that's logical and says
[56:42] yes that's true and so your mind accepts
[56:45] it and your mind's controlled by your
[56:46] spirit and he says see just your
[56:48] thoughts don't do that but the word of
[56:50] God brought in the channel of your
[56:52] thought it's not the thought as
[56:54] Christian Science make it out to be mind
[56:56] matter no he said that isn't it but your
[56:58] mind accepts and grasp it what is your
[57:01] mind controlled by your spirit and your
[57:03] spirit catches the word of God and
[57:06] that's the thing that's got life in it
[57:08] and it brings life into
[57:11] you so that's why we preach
[57:15] Faith that's why we preach Faith because
[57:17] Faith cometh by hearing hearing of the
[57:20] word of God so faith has to be
[57:25] preached and and brother M will say this
[57:27] he goes it must it must be accepted in
[57:29] the mind then it's believed in the heart
[57:31] then the word of God becomes a reality
[57:33] then every sense of the soul and body is
[57:37] just scoured out with the Holy Ghost
[57:39] then your senses of God your conscience
[57:42] of God everything that's Godly flows
[57:44] through you there's no doubt anywhere
[57:47] there's nothing can rise up and can I
[57:50] tell you he's still the dissolver of
[57:53] doubts he is today as much God as he was
[57:56] yesterday he is still the dissolver of
[57:59] doubts but brother B would tell us now
[58:02] under the United under the the one head
[58:04] he says now if if he can get you to stop
[58:06] just for a
[58:08] minute see Satan wants you to stop
[58:11] remember the story of the girl who
[58:13] stopped just for a minute listening to
[58:15] the
[58:16] music oh he done delivered her brother
[58:18] Dennis from that lifestyle dancing up
[58:21] there and she stopped just for a minute
[58:25] yeah yes because you see there was
[58:27] something inside of her that never got P
[58:30] purely cleaned
[58:32] out she comes so far but not far enough
[58:36] and that's why it's important to not
[58:37] only come so far but to go all the way
[58:40] all the way you know we're not just
[58:42] going and we're going to you know we're
[58:43] leaving Egypt but we're going to leave
[58:45] some of our children behind no we're not
[58:46] leaving a hoof behind let me tell you
[58:49] and when we take a Rapture as a body
[58:51] we're not leaving one of y'all behind we
[58:54] believe it for every last one of us that
[58:56] you're going to be filled with the Holy
[58:58] Ghost that the token life is going to
[59:00] come down and it's going to baptize you
[59:02] with the power and when that time comes
[59:04] for these bodies to be changed oh
[59:06] Hallelujah ain't enough devils in hell
[59:08] can keep these bodies from transforming
[59:10] we will take a step into another
[59:14] dimension we don't believe in a soar
[59:16] religion we're going all the way or we
[59:18] ain't going at

[1:06:02] family that's
[1:06:04] Satan see Satan's attack is is what
[1:06:07] brother B said it's
[1:06:08] disbelief see God's word disbelief God's
[1:06:11] word and there's only two forces Satan
[1:06:14] and God and he said what is Satan's
[1:06:16] weapon against you is to try to get you
[1:06:17] to
[1:06:18] disbelieve your weapon God has given you
[1:06:22] a weapon it's prayer and prayer is
[1:06:24] operated by fa faith and faith in the
[1:06:28] word of God so you can operate prayer in
[1:06:31] the word of God by faith tonight what am
[1:06:34] I telling you I'm telling you you don't
[1:06:36] have to remain where you are you have a
[1:06:39] choice that you can make tonight as a
[1:06:41] son and daughter of God as a young
[1:06:43] person that's hearing the word being
[1:06:45] preached see the battle grounds your
[1:06:47] mind and Satan knows that if he can get
[1:06:49] you to disbelieve the
[1:06:52] word then what you're going to do is
[1:06:54] you'll essentially lay your weapon down
[1:06:56] come on brother you'll lay it down say
[1:06:59] well maybe that's not for me and then
[1:07:01] you're two days without reading your
[1:07:03] Bible you're three days without reading
[1:07:04] your Bible you're a week without reading
[1:07:06] your Bible you're a month without
[1:07:07] reading your Bible oh and then you're
[1:07:09] six months and every day you go without
[1:07:12] reading and praying the weaker you
[1:07:16] get and you lay it down on the prophet
[1:07:18] of God says never Lay Your Weapon down
[1:07:21] hold it in your hand day and night not
[1:07:25] right and day keep that word before you
[1:07:28] keep his Commandments before you get
[1:07:30] into the presence of God that's the only
[1:07:33] way you're going to escape
[1:07:34] [Applause]
[1:07:35] leoda amen amen so we find the
[1:07:39] attack is in the mind this little gray
[1:07:42] matter that we call the brain and
[1:07:45] sometimes we want to say that's our
[1:07:46] minds you know with the Mind man is
[1:07:49] created Great Inventions Automobiles and
[1:07:51] airplanes with the Mind man is landed on
[1:07:54] the moon and Achieve great great things
[1:07:56] brilliant things by proper use of the
[1:07:59] mind but just think for a minute if you
[1:08:01] was just dwelling on bad things evil
[1:08:05] things dirty
[1:08:10] things the things that come through your
[1:08:13] mind that you dwell on and you dwell on

[1:08:53] rate but we get concerned concerned
[1:08:55] about oh look at me you know when I was
[1:08:59] a young boy believe it or not I was this
[1:09:02] size in sixth grade when I get I thought
[1:09:06] I was going to be the
[1:09:09] stuff I maxed out now I'm maxed out in
[1:09:12] height at six in sixth grade but I was
[1:09:15] 220 PBS at 5' 5 and a half when I was a
[1:09:19] senior that's what I said
[1:09:23] my I got picked on for being little roly
[1:09:27] poly I got called the little Michelin
[1:09:28] man I got called the little dough boy
[1:09:32] all those little
[1:09:33] jokes and what does it do it begins to
[1:09:36] set a complex in your mind look at me I
[1:09:39] can't be like them statues over in
[1:09:42] Paris with the six-pack I mean I'd be
[1:09:45] happy with one
[1:09:47] pack but we fine we let things maybe how
[1:09:52] we
[1:09:54] look how we look Define who we are
[1:09:58] spiritually I told the brothers this
[1:10:00] morning not everybody can be Andrew
[1:10:02] Glover tall dark and
[1:10:04] handsome some of us got to be short
[1:10:06] dumpy and
[1:10:08] cute so hey now I welcome it I don't
[1:10:13] mind at all I'm married 22 years four
[1:10:15] kids I ain't looking for nobody else it
[1:10:18] don't
[1:10:19] matter brother Jason we have
[1:10:22] arrived the days are looking is over
[1:10:27] wo but I ain't going to let myself go I
[1:10:30] go to the gym every day I try to run try
[1:10:34] to eat right try to do the right things
[1:10:36] because see it ain't so much for my wife
[1:10:38] it's for
[1:10:39] me but Satan will use your physicality
[1:10:42] how you're shaped how you're made maybe
[1:10:44] your personality maybe some of you a
[1:10:45] little bit rough around the
[1:10:47] edges don't nobody raise your hand right
[1:10:50] now that's not the time to do it Brad
[1:10:55] we think well why did God make me this
[1:10:58] way I don't want to be like this God
[1:11:01] made you that way for a
[1:11:03] purpose so that you could fulfill his
[1:11:06] purpose you think I want to preach like
[1:11:08] this all the time we had a bible study
[1:11:10] this morning I preach just like this
[1:11:13] brother J said that was a bible study on
[1:11:15] steroids cuz it ain't in
[1:11:18] me sometimes I want to be able to preach
[1:11:20] like brother Jason Watkins brother Tim
[1:11:21] puit brother Donnie Reagan all elegant
[1:11:24] and I mean just so resourceful with all
[1:11:26] the knowledge I mean man I got to take
[1:11:28] pictures of all these quotes and put
[1:11:29] them in my head to have a photographic
[1:11:31] memory they got
[1:11:34] it but we find we let little things eat
[1:11:38] away at us and Satan uses that to
[1:11:42] imprison you with what we call a
[1:11:46] complex you're not good enough well who
[1:11:48] said so you're never going to make it
[1:11:52] who's got the final say
[1:11:55] and we let these little things eat away
[1:11:57] at us and you get and you form a little
[1:11:59] complex do you know that even brother
[1:12:01] Bram had a
[1:12:03] complex brother Bram himself had a
[1:12:05] complex he lost the feeling for the
[1:12:10] people and he said do me a favor when
[1:12:13] you pray pray that God will give me the
[1:12:16] feeling back for the people that I lost
[1:12:18] in that complex but see cuz a complex is
[1:12:22] real it's real but it's not real it's a
[1:12:25] false reality of a s allow the devil to
[1:12:28] ENT trap you and imprison you telling
[1:12:30] you that you're something when that's
[1:12:32] not what you are or telling you that
[1:12:34] you're not this and in fact that is what
[1:12:36] you
[1:12:37] are so we all have faced complexes and
[1:12:41] the lies of the enemy and the things
[1:12:43] that try to come and bombard our minds
[1:12:46] and I'm going to go just a little bit
[1:12:47] further and Satan I tell you you know
[1:12:48] what you're not going to make the
[1:12:51] Rapture I told my church last week or
[1:12:54] this past week I said you know when I
[1:12:55] was a kid I did not like to hear the
[1:12:57] word rapture it scared me to death but I
[1:13:00] didn't sit in a church like you sit in I
[1:13:03] didn't know the realities and the reward
[1:13:05] that the Rapture is to me the Rapture
[1:13:08] was Armageddon it was like a big big war
[1:13:10] and they going to cut your head off
[1:13:11] because you got to accept the name of
[1:13:13] Christ and if you don't then they gonna
[1:13:14] cut your head off and I mean I had it
[1:13:16] all messed up Baptist Church don't teach
[1:13:19] you very good let me just put it out
[1:13:20] there but we find now Satan would tell
[1:13:23] you that you you can't receive the Holy
[1:13:26] Ghost cuz if you would you would have
[1:13:27] just got it in the camp you just come
[1:13:29] out
[1:13:31] of look at you you came back the same
[1:13:34] way you
[1:13:35] went same desire same nature same
[1:13:39] attitude same Rebellion Mom and Daddy
[1:13:43] asked you to do
[1:13:45] something your body didn't know you can
[1:13:47] do all them gations did it you just get
[1:13:49] asked a question
[1:13:55] all I ask you to do was going make your
[1:13:58] bed you about made your grave with all
[1:14:00] that twisting and jumping and everything
[1:14:01] you just
[1:14:05] did and you think that's cute huh it's
[1:14:09] not
[1:14:10] cute because Rebellion is as a sin of
[1:14:14] Witchcraft Rebellion is not cool I don't
[1:14:16] care what age you are whether you're a
[1:14:18] grownup or
[1:14:20] not well we find Satan will use these
[1:14:22] things and he use these things against
[1:14:24] you cuz he knows how you're
[1:14:28] natured brother Dennis he knows that
[1:14:31] you're very
[1:14:32] Meek very
[1:14:34] quiet but I seen brother Dennis we was
[1:14:38] preaching together at a meeting there in
[1:14:39] Ohio one time out in a in a park and I
[1:14:43] preach like I'm preaching right now
[1:14:45] Dennis you know he just come he's all
[1:14:49] dignified got to get it all right y'all
[1:14:52] know I don't know if you ever heard
[1:14:53] Dennis preach he's
[1:14:55] can we turn to the
[1:14:57] scriptures bam and that joker just
[1:15:00] unloads a whole another man I'm like who
[1:15:03] died and took him
[1:15:06] over I'm like I didn't know that man
[1:15:08] could preach like that like a power
[1:15:11] house but you look at him think man no
[1:15:16] and sometimes that's how we look at each
[1:15:17] other they look at your outward
[1:15:19] appearance you know what you ain't so
[1:15:21] pretty I ain't going to like you cuz you
[1:15:23] ugly that's kind of how we are AR
[1:15:26] we come on you know how it is in grade
[1:15:29] school you poor you stay with the poor
[1:15:33] folks if you was rich you had rich
[1:15:35] friends if you was middle class you had
[1:15:37] middle class friends if you were poor
[1:15:40] you had grimy
[1:15:42] friends and sometimes that's how we
[1:15:45] treat each other in
[1:15:47] church we're Sons and Daughters of God
[1:15:50] and Satan will get into that because how
[1:15:52] somebody's natured
[1:15:55] I understand you're not gonna be buddies
[1:15:56] with everybody in your
[1:15:58] church but you can at least be
[1:16:01] friendly you can at least say Hey
[1:16:03] brother sister how you doing but Satan
[1:16:05] will form that little complex and you
[1:16:07] you ignore that sister long enough then
[1:16:10] here's a little complex sets down on her
[1:16:11] I guess I'm ugly I guess I'm not good
[1:16:14] enough and then Satan slams the door of
[1:16:17] that prison and now depression sets in
[1:16:20] and now the thoughts of suicide begin to
[1:16:22] dwell in her mind
[1:16:25] all because of maybe she's not fitting
[1:16:27] in or he's not fitting into the crowd
[1:16:31] because well we're short or we got a
[1:16:33] deformity or we're just not pretty or
[1:16:35] we're tall or fat whatever you want to
[1:16:37] put it there or maybe you're so natured
[1:16:40] that
[1:16:41] way see Satan uses these little things
[1:16:45] to imprison you in a Cell of his own
[1:16:49] making can I go just a little bit
[1:16:53] further and we find that we have this
[1:16:56] constant
[1:16:57] bombardment how many Of You' have been
[1:16:58] bombarded
[1:17:00] today all right some of you older people
[1:17:02] you young people I don't know where in
[1:17:04] the world y'all playing
[1:17:06] at but us older folks we on the
[1:17:08] battlefield for my Lord woo get on the
[1:17:11] battlefield Young
[1:17:14] Folks Mercy but he comes and he bombards
[1:17:18] your mind and you walk around with no
[1:17:22] joy you mean to tell me we got the
[1:17:24] greatest message that ever hit the face
[1:17:26] of the Earth but yet Satan knows if I
[1:17:29] can get them under bondage if I can
[1:17:31] bombard their mind over and over and get
[1:17:34] them to reason and get them to doubt and
[1:17:36] get them to unbelief and get them to
[1:17:38] look at physical situations get them to
[1:17:40] look at Natural Things versus the word
[1:17:42] of God then he'll keep you bound and
[1:17:44] you'll have no joy no peace your faith
[1:17:47] begins to Wain and you become a prisoner
[1:17:51] that's Frederick Douglas many of you may
[1:17:53] know Frederick Douglas if if you hav't
[1:17:55] you need to go look at your American
[1:17:56] history book but frr Douglas was a
[1:17:59] abolitionist and he made a comment he
[1:18:01] said if you want to make a slave a
[1:18:03] contented slave then you let him know
[1:18:06] there's nothing wrong with
[1:18:11] slavery let him know there's nothing
[1:18:14] wrong don't let him know there's
[1:18:16] anything else but
[1:18:19] slavery Harriet Tubman y'all familiar
[1:18:22] with Harriet Tubman here in South
[1:18:23] Carolina
[1:18:25] give you a history lesson if you don't
[1:18:27] Harriet Tubman she she had that the uh
[1:18:31] Underground Railroad right she was
[1:18:34] funling slaves out out out and she made
[1:18:38] a comment brother Andrew she said I
[1:18:40] would have I would have freed she
[1:18:42] because I freed a lot of slaves and I
[1:18:44] would have freed a lot more if they
[1:18:45] would have only knew they were
[1:18:49] slaves if they would have only knew that
[1:18:52] they were slaves because only then do
[1:18:56] you realize you need to be set
[1:18:58] free that's good brother and young
[1:19:01] person what am I telling you tonight is
[1:19:03] you're in a prison some of you are in a
[1:19:05] prison of depression some of you are in
[1:19:07] a prison of anxiety and nervousness and
[1:19:09] and introvert and or maybe extrovert
[1:19:11] whatever it may be you're in a complex
[1:19:13] you're in a prison of your own making
[1:19:15] fear and and worry and guilt and a shame
[1:19:19] and lust and passion and everything but
[1:19:22] I can tell you tonight you can be free
[1:19:24] if you realize that you're a slave
[1:19:28] tonight cuz God has no intentions of
[1:19:31] leaving you the way he found
[1:19:33] you God has no intentions of you walking
[1:19:36] out of this service the same way you
[1:19:38] walked in maybe you're here tonight and
[1:19:41] you are in prison and you are battling
[1:19:45] an issue and it may not look it may not
[1:19:47] be drugs and alcohol and and pornography
[1:19:50] and and things of that nature but maybe
[1:19:52] it's just little things that you're
[1:19:54] harboring to yourself nobody knows cuz
[1:19:57] you kept
[1:19:59] it but the holy spirit is here I can
[1:20:02] tell
[1:20:03] you CU this message has gone different
[1:20:05] ways completely different than I
[1:20:06] expected it to go because I can see him
[1:20:08] starting to just move and starting to
[1:20:10] search and starting to pick starting to
[1:20:13] cut dealing with
[1:20:15] depression there's never been another
[1:20:17] age to face depression like the age in
[1:20:19] which we're living
[1:20:21] in millions and millions and millions of
[1:20:23] people brother Dennis are
[1:20:25] anti-depressants but tonight you have
[1:20:27] the greatest anti-depressant there ever
[1:20:29] was it's the Holy Ghost it's the
[1:20:33] gospel it can do more for you than any
[1:20:36] shrink any psychiatrist any peill that
[1:20:38] you'll ever take in your life you don't
[1:20:40] have to keep revisiting the doctor when
[1:20:42] you come to drct Jesus he'll cut that
[1:20:45] thing right out of your life and set you
[1:20:48] free that's the truth we find some of us
[1:20:52] we have no motivation to keep pressing
[1:20:54] in the battle then eventually you just
[1:20:57] give in you
[1:20:59] cave how many you had friends sitting
[1:21:01] right here amongst you cave and now
[1:21:03] they're no longer sitting in the house
[1:21:04] of
[1:21:06] God maybe got their hair growed out and
[1:21:09] you know got three or four girlfriends
[1:21:11] or boyfriends or you know they got uh
[1:21:14] knocked up excuse the language a excuse
[1:21:17] me but they got pregnated by some other
[1:21:19] boy and this that and other before they
[1:21:21] got married and all that all that has
[1:21:23] happened because people got weary and
[1:21:25] well
[1:21:26] doing so let me just go just further and
[1:21:29] we we're going to start bringing this
[1:21:30] down here I want to start turning a
[1:21:31] corner see Satan will press into your
[1:21:34] minds with a purpose to destroy you yes
[1:21:37] sir he will press you he will attack you
[1:21:40] with the purpose to destroy you and the
[1:21:43] Bible says in John 10:10 the thief
[1:21:45] cometh not but for the steal to kill and
[1:21:48] destroy but I come that you might have
[1:21:51] life and that you might have life more
[1:21:53] abundantly so Satan wants to destroy
[1:21:55] your fellowship with Believers he wants
[1:21:57] to destroy your self-esteem he wants to
[1:21:59] destroy your relationship with God your
[1:22:01] relationship with your friends your
[1:22:02] relationship with your family he wants
[1:22:05] to divide the siblings he wants to
[1:22:07] destroy your faith in God's word he
[1:22:09] wants to destroy the faith and
[1:22:11] confidence that you have in a
[1:22:14] Ministry and brother Brown would tell us
[1:22:16] he says you don't have to stick a life
[1:22:18] in a man's
[1:22:20] back to break his character to kill
[1:22:23] him you go talking about his characters
[1:22:26] and some of us we've seen it over the
[1:22:28] dinner table you hear the stories and
[1:22:30] you wonder you know Mom and Dad saying
[1:22:32] these things and then you can't help
[1:22:34] their kids I can't help their kids no
[1:22:37] preacher can help their
[1:22:39] kids and then you find their kids
[1:22:41] drifting and they become a prisoner to
[1:22:43] the
[1:22:45] world but we all have faced that and
[1:22:47] seen those things and those battles and
[1:22:49] those complexes every one of us get some
[1:22:53] Psalms 139 vers 14 says I will praise
[1:22:56] thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully
[1:23:00] made when I found that scripture that
[1:23:04] little 5 foot five and a half 220 PB fat
[1:23:08] kid called roly poly little Pillsbury
[1:23:12] Doughboy I don't worry about my weight

[1:26:43] difference what your past has

[1:27:04] altar keep coming because one day it's
[1:27:08] going to
[1:27:09] stick he said it doesn't matter listen
[1:27:11] he says it don't make a difference what
[1:27:13] your past life has been when you got an
[1:27:16] invitation to come you're ready to come
[1:27:19] if you've been bad if you've been a
[1:27:21] street walker if you've been a gambler
[1:27:23] if you've been a drunkard if you if
[1:27:25] you've been a murderer no matter what
[1:27:27] you've been if God gives you an
[1:27:30] invitation knocking at your heart he
[1:27:34] will take care of the rest yes
[1:27:37] sir now I'm speaking to you on walk
[1:27:40] out and we go back to Peter here see the
[1:27:45] king he apprehended Peter because he saw
[1:27:49] the joy in the people's eyes when he
[1:27:52] killed James so he said I'm going to
[1:27:55] kill another one and maybe that's what
[1:27:57] he's done he maybe he's killed some of
[1:28:00] of your friends spiritually and they're
[1:28:02] not walking with the Lord anymore and
[1:28:04] he's determined to take you and to throw
[1:28:06] you into a
[1:28:08] prison a prison now back in that day was
[1:28:11] was designed to psych psychologically
[1:28:14] and physically torture The Prisoner
[1:28:16] prisons was also designed to strip the
[1:28:19] prisoner of every ounce of
[1:28:21] dignity to humiliate you to embarrass
[1:28:25] you and the Bible says in Acts 12 and
[1:28:28] verse 10 and when Herod would have
[1:28:30] brought him forth the same night Peter
[1:28:34] was sleeping Between Two Soldiers there
[1:28:38] was 16 men that was commissioned to
[1:28:41] watch over him and make sure he didn't
[1:28:46] Escape so he sleeping this man had so
[1:28:49] much peace with God brother Jason that
[1:28:52] knowing that tomorrow he's going to give
[1:28:54] his life if it's required that he just
[1:28:57] fell
[1:28:59] asleep I want to be a Peter so I don't
[1:29:02] worry about what tomorrow holds I got
[1:29:04] peace in my God and he fell asleep
[1:29:08] chained to two prisoners prison guard
[1:29:11] excuse me and we find
[1:29:14] here says Peter was sleeping Between Two
[1:29:17] Soldiers bound with chains and the
[1:29:20] keepers before the door kept a prison
[1:29:23] and behold the the angel of the Lord
[1:29:25] came upon him and a light shined into
[1:29:28] the prison and he smoked Peter on the
[1:29:30] side and he raised him up saying arise
[1:29:33] up
[1:29:34] quickly and his chains fell off of his
[1:29:36] hands and the angel said unto him guard
[1:29:39] thyself and bind on thy sandals
[1:29:43] otherwise say it's time to
[1:29:46] walk you can't stay
[1:29:48] here you can't stay
[1:29:51] here a light an Ang Angel of the Lord
[1:29:55] came into his prison cell historians
[1:29:58] that say that Peter's left arm was
[1:30:00] chained to the right arm of a guard and
[1:30:04] his right arm was chained to the left
[1:30:06] arm of another
[1:30:09] guard but when the angel of the Lord
[1:30:11] comes in your
[1:30:13] room can I tell you a young person when
[1:30:16] the angel of the Lord comes by your way
[1:30:19] I don't care what you've been chained to
[1:30:21] what kind of drug you've been chained to
[1:30:22] what kind of pornography you been
[1:30:24] chained to what kind of past life you've
[1:30:26] been chained to it doesn't matter to God
[1:30:28] cuz when he sends the angel of the lord
[1:30:30] your
[1:30:32] way chains begin to fall
[1:30:34] off those chains that held you you
[1:30:37] wonder will I ever escape will I ever be
[1:30:42] free as a young man brother Dennis for
[1:30:45] 20-some years all I wanted to do was
[1:30:46] serve God I didn't know how to do
[1:30:49] it I didn't know how to serve God I
[1:30:51] didn't know how to find God I didn't
[1:30:52] really know how to pray to God but
[1:30:54] something B on my heart day after day
[1:30:57] after day and go to the bar and I'd go
[1:30:59] to a party and I'd do this and I do that
[1:31:01] but something in my heart longed to
[1:31:03] serve God but one
[1:31:07] night one night that same angel I
