[4:10] that you would be his glory
[4:14] considering where we came from and the

[4:46] attitude will bring any promise of God
[4:49] to pass. Amen. Let's pray. Father, I
[4:53] love you this morning.
[4:55] And Lord, I I just upon my heart, I
[4:58] wanted to pray for those that Father
[5:00] allowing this audio and the streaming to
[5:02] go forth. how they separate their time,
[5:06] Father, in focusing on the technical
[5:10] aspects of the audio and the visual. I
[5:13] pray that you would pray bless them,
[5:15] Lord.
[5:17] There's a reward for those that work for
[5:19] you, Father. And I pray it would be a
[5:22] blessing to those that would stream. And
[5:24] Lord, as we gather in the house of God
[5:27] this morning, Bethl Tabernacle,
[5:30] we pray that you would come in a mighty
[5:33] way this morning, Lord, in the name of
[5:35] Jesus Christ. We lift you up before us,
[5:38] Father. We are nothing in ourselves,
[5:40] Lord, but Father, with you, we can do
[5:44] all things. I pray for your people this
[5:47] morning, those uplifted hands. Father,
[5:50] I don't know what's behind them, but you
[5:53] do. And you are more than able to meet
[5:56] each and every need that was presented
[5:58] to you this morning. I love you, Lord. I
[6:01] thank you for your work at Calvary. Pray
[6:03] you forgive me for my shortcomings,
[6:06] Lord. That you would help me through my
[6:08] faults and failures to learn. May they
[6:10] each be stepping stones to draw closer
[6:12] to you, Lord. And as we gather the
[6:15] tithes and offerings, Father, I pray
[6:18] that you would bless the cheerful giver.
[6:21] Look upon the hearts, Father, today.
[6:23] Reveal yourself in a special way. We
[6:25] pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.

[36:07] I can face tomorrow

[36:17] [Applause]
[36:19] All fear is gone
[36:24] [Applause]
[36:26] because I know
[36:32] he holds my future.
[36:36] [Music]
[36:39] And life is worth the living
[36:45] just because
[36:48] he lives.
[36:52] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap of
[36:53] praise. Hallelujah.
[36:58] Amen.
[37:00] Praise the Lord.
[37:02] And we just want to remember the all the
[37:04] Watkins who are traveling back from the
[37:07] uh successful wedding that
[37:10] Brother Gideon, sister Annaise had. So
[37:13] pray for them as well on their travel I
[37:16] think soon to their honeymoon although I
[37:18] don't know the details. Welcome to our
[37:21] visitors. Brother Jim, sister Julie, so
[37:24] good to see you. God bless you. And uh
[37:29] so we're going to continue. I think
[37:31] about a month ago before I left for
[37:33] Egypt. Um,
[37:36] I preached on quicken into the seventh
[37:38] seal and I want to do part two this time
[37:44] looking into the scriptures. We're going
[37:46] to start in Galatians. Um, if you want
[37:48] to go ahead and bring that PowerPoint
[37:49] up.
[37:55] I didn't see any prayer requests uh come
[37:58] in uh earlier today. Um, but we want to
[38:03] you If you have a prayer request upon
[38:05] your heart, we'll have you lift your
[38:07] hands when we go to prayer. But we'll
[38:09] start with our PowerPoint. The back
[38:12] screen is still off.
[38:16] So,
[38:18] it's broken.
[38:20] Okay.
[38:23] Galatians 3:24.
[38:28] Wherefore the law was our school master
[38:30] to bring us unto Christ that we might be
[38:32] justified by faith.
[38:35] But after that faith is come, we are no
[38:37] longer under a school master.
[38:39] Amen.
[38:40] For you are all for you are all the
[38:44] children of God by faith in Jesus
[38:47] Christ. This word for children is
[38:50] actually the in Greek is the root word
[38:53] for adoption. So this isn't children
[38:56] like like little ones. That's not what
[38:59] it's speaking of. It's speaking of the
[39:01] word hyios which or hios which means uh
[39:06] son.
[39:08] So you are all sons of God by faith in
[39:12] Christ Jesus. And this of course is
[39:14] significant as we go into the rest of
[39:17] this chapter and into chapter 4.
[39:21] Uh as we look further, we'll read a
[39:24] couple more verses and then we'll pray.
[39:29] For as many as of you have been as have
[39:32] been baptized into Christ, have put on
[39:35] Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek.
[39:37] There is neither bond nor free. There is
[39:40] neither male nor female. For you're all
[39:43] one in Christ Jesus.
[39:48] And if you be Christs, then are you
[39:49] Abraham's seed and hes according to the
[39:53] promise. Amen. Let's pray.
[39:56] Heavenly Father, we come before you,
[39:58] Lord. And we ask your blessing, Lord,
[40:01] upon the reading and the preaching of
[40:03] the word. Lord, I pray that you would
[40:05] anoint us, your people. Lord, anoint
[40:08] your anoint the saints here to pull on
[40:10] the word.
[40:11] Amen. anoint me to get out of the way,
[40:13] Lord, that your word might flow into
[40:15] hearts and minister to each one, Lord,
[40:17] bringing bringing healing, bringing
[40:19] strength, bringing bringing deliverance,
[40:21] Father.
[40:22] Lord, we pray for all the the Watkins
[40:25] and all the ones who went up to the
[40:27] wedding. We pray that you would watch
[40:28] over and protect them as they travel,
[40:31] Lord. That you would uh be with the new
[40:33] couple uh traveling as well, Lord. Watch
[40:37] over them and keep them. Lord, we ask
[40:40] for those who have any needs here in the
[40:43] building, Father, that you know the
[40:45] hearts
[40:46] and and you know what each one is going
[40:49] through. I pray, Lord, that you would
[40:51] meet their needs even now, Lord. We're
[40:53] stretching our hands forward by faith,
[40:55] believing, Lord, that your promise is
[40:57] true and it's for us today. We ask these
[41:00] things, Lord, and commit ourselves to
[41:01] you in Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you.
[41:05] Be seated.
[41:08] And so we we I I just want to appreciate
[41:11] Brother Matthew's Sunday school uh this
[41:14] morning. If you didn't listen, um please
[41:18] please go catch the recording. It was a
[41:20] great blessing. And
[41:23] under the under the seventh seal, you
[41:26] know, it's it's not enough to merely uh
[41:31] grab the information about the seventh
[41:33] seal because the seventh seal isn't like
[41:35] that. Seventh seal is is a secret. It's
[41:38] it's silence in heaven for the space of
[41:40] half an hour.
[41:42] And so the other six seals we can go
[41:44] through and we can find all the
[41:46] information that we can look at the
[41:48] history. We could study it out. We could
[41:50] see even in the fourth in the horse
[41:53] riders and the four beasts. We can see
[41:55] how the devil works and anoints people
[41:59] and situations and churches etc. And
[42:02] then we can find out how God on the
[42:04] other hand combats that. And then we
[42:06] understand that there's uh his the not
[42:09] only the history of the Jewish
[42:11] persecution but the future of the Jewish
[42:13] persecution. And then uh the the world
[42:16] under judgment
[42:18] of the ministry of the two prophets.
[42:21] So we can look at that and see all the
[42:23] information there. But the seventh seal
[42:25] is not that. It's something we have to
[42:26] be quickened into.
[42:28] Amen.
[42:28] It's a revelation. Thank you. And that
[42:31] revelation is it's far beyond merely
[42:34] information but it's a person.
[42:37] All the seals speak of Christ but
[42:40] particularly the seventh seal. What is
[42:43] it? Seventh seal is Christ.
[42:46] Amen.
[42:48] And so
[42:50] just as Ruth Ruth, the bride is a type
[42:54] of Ruth, the gentile, and she didn't she
[43:00] didn't even have actually rights
[43:02] directly to the covenant. But through
[43:04] that relationship, she she had rights to
[43:07] redemption.
[43:08] Amen. And so when she came to claim her
[43:11] rights of redemption, she was given six
[43:14] uh six scoops of of flour, right?
[43:19] Yeah.
[43:19] She was given skip six scoops of grain.
[43:22] Why not seven? It would work better if
[43:24] it was seven because six represented
[43:27] what belonged to her, but seventh was
[43:30] who belonged to her, right? That's a
[43:33] person. The seventh was Boaz.
[43:35] Amen. And so Christ
[43:38] is that seventh seal. But then then
[43:41] again it's more than that
[43:43] because who is in Christ?
[43:46] Amen.
[43:47] What is the purpose of the seventh seal?
[43:48] We we forward to Revelation 10. We
[43:51] always talk about Revelation 10. But
[43:53] again it's it's something we should un
[43:56] see and understand that the purpose of
[43:58] the open book was not merely that it
[44:01] could be revealed and it could be off in
[44:03] the distance for us to behold.
[44:06] looking up there saying, "Oh, look at
[44:07] the look at the seals are open. Look at
[44:09] the book is open to us. We can see the
[44:12] reality of the book of redemption." No,
[44:14] the purpose was for it to get inside of
[44:17] us.
[44:17] Amen.
[44:18] The purpose was for us to take the book
[44:20] and to eat the book and become one with
[44:23] the book and then out of eating that
[44:25] book to be to prophesy again.
[44:28] Amen. So it's not only becoming the word
[44:31] but becoming to the place where we're
[44:33] speaking the word. So within this we
[44:37] understand then that not only will God
[44:42] be revealed to us in fullness in this
[44:45] hour but then out of that revelation of
[44:48] himself comes a revelation of who we are
[44:52] in him.
[44:53] Amen.
[44:54] And that in itself is the preparation
[44:56] for the rapture. That is the purpose of
[44:59] why the mighty angel came down was to
[45:02] make us ready for the rapture in
[45:04] revealing himself. That's why brother
[45:06] Brandham says in who is this Melkazedc
[45:08] he says think of this great person of
[45:10] how great this man must be and now the
[45:12] question is who is this man? theologians
[45:15] has had different ideas. But since the
[45:17] opening of the seven seals, the
[45:19] mysterious book that's been mysterious
[45:21] to us according to Revelation 10 1-7,
[45:24] all the mysteries that's wrote in this
[45:26] book that's been hid down through the
[45:27] age of reformers is supposed to be
[45:29] brought out into view by the angel of
[45:32] the last church age. How many knows
[45:34] that's right? That's right. Supposed to
[45:35] be brought out. All the mysteries of the
[45:37] mysterious book is to be revealed to the
[45:40] Leodysian messenger of that age. So he's
[45:43] precursing his message on Melkazedc.
[45:46] This message is coming because the seals
[45:48] have been broken.
[45:50] Amen.
[45:51] And then he goes to he begins to preach
[45:53] and towards the beginning of his
[45:55] preaching, he's leading out who Melzdc
[45:58] is and who we are in Mel in Melzdc. He
[46:03] says, "Now notice, praise God for the
[46:05] opening of these seals is my prayer to
[46:07] know these things. Now the true
[46:10] revelation of Melzdc comes into view.
[46:14] And so the this this this the opening of
[46:17] the seals and its effect and its purpose
[46:21] and the revelation of the word doesn't
[46:23] just stop in March of 1963.
[46:26] It keeps progressing. It keeps opening
[46:29] up more and more to brother Brandham.
[46:31] And who is this Melkazedc is a part of
[46:33] that.
[46:34] Many other messages that are a part of
[46:35] that. But in that message is brother
[46:39] Brandham says, "Isn't it isn't it
[46:40] strange that in a message about Melzdc,
[46:43] the secrets of our our lives are opened
[46:46] up and revealed?" And I believe I I I do
[46:49] believe that really grasping the
[46:52] revelation of what is contained in that
[46:55] message, who is this MelkiseDC, is a
[46:58] huge part of getting us ready for the
[47:01] rapture.
[47:02] Amen.
[47:05] because it it will bring us stability.
[47:07] It will bring us strength. It will bring
[47:09] a real understanding of who we are. Now
[47:13] the the it says he says that the
[47:15] revelation of predestination comes into
[47:18] plain view
[47:20] and many times this becomes a
[47:22] misunderstanding for people and they go
[47:24] off in one direction and they go off in
[47:26] another direction about that. But
[47:28] understand, every time that brother
[47:30] Brandham shows and speaks about the new
[47:33] birth, he always connects it to the life
[47:36] that's being produced.
[47:38] Amen.
[47:38] Amen.
[47:39] Understand? He he never disconnects
[47:41] that. If you've been born again, that
[47:45] produces a new nature which produces
[47:48] different the fruit of the spirit which
[47:49] produces a different kind of character
[47:52] in your life. Right? It can't not do
[47:56] that. Now, there's There's millions of
[47:59] people that mimic it. And that's where
[48:01] people take predestination and they go
[48:02] into disgrace. The only reason you go
[48:05] into disgrace is that you're merely a
[48:08] mimic of Christianity.
[48:10] Amen.
[48:10] If you are truly I'm getting towards the
[48:14] end of the sermon already,
[48:17] but I'll come back to the beginning.
[48:19] Praise God.
[48:20] But if you're truly predestinated by
[48:22] God, that necessitates the fact that God
[48:27] is going to be doing a work in you.
[48:31] You can't you can't get around that. He
[48:33] will do whatever it takes.
[48:36] And that is ultimately what love is.
[48:40] God is love. Now, I'm getting off into
[48:43] another message. In the Bible, there's
[48:45] four different kinds of love. Did you
[48:46] know that? I'm going to preach on that
[48:48] at some point in time in detail. But
[48:50] there's agape love. There's filelio
[48:53] love. There's stoay love which is family
[48:55] love. Felio is like friendship. Stoay
[48:58] love is is family. And then there's
[49:00] aeros love which is love between uh two
[49:03] lovers. Uh some people call it lust.
[49:05] However you want to call it, it's not
[49:06] necessarily a a negative thing as long
[49:08] as it's channeled in the right
[49:10] direction. But it is a lower level uh uh
[49:14] carnal type of of love. Many in English
[49:18] we just say love.
[49:21] I fell in love. What if you fall out of
[49:23] love?
[49:24] That's not agape love.
[49:27] Right?
[49:29] That many people say they love God and
[49:32] this church is such a loving church.
[49:34] What love? There's four different kinds
[49:36] of love.
[49:37] Many people love God with aeros love.
[49:41] It's just all about uh it's all about
[49:44] emotions and sensations. It's in the
[49:47] second and third realm. It's not it's or
[49:49] it's in the first and second realm. It's
[49:50] not in the inside of the inside love.
[49:53] It's not the right kind of love. And we
[49:55] we all talk about how we love one
[49:57] another. We love this person. We love
[49:58] our children. We
[49:59] But which one are you talking about?
[50:02] Amen.
[50:03] It's it's good to love your family with
[50:05] stoay love. But if you're a Christian,
[50:07] it needs to transcend
[50:09] that and go beyond that. And so if we
[50:11] understand really at at its root is the
[50:14] devil wants to give us unending aeros
[50:18] love in every direction. And he doesn't
[50:20] care if we love God with aeros love.
[50:23] In fact, that that helps him because it
[50:25] blinds us.
[50:26] Amen.
[50:27] Because all the focus is external,
[50:29] external, external, not the inside of
[50:32] the inside. What happens with every if
[50:34] everything falls apart? You're
[50:36] disappointed in everything in your life.
[50:39] What happens then? You don't love God
[50:41] anymore
[50:42] because he didn't live up to what you
[50:43] fel your feelings.
[50:45] But what if it's a revelation quickened
[50:48] into your soul and everything falls
[50:50] apart and you don't even understand why
[50:52] you're still believing? It doesn't even
[50:54] make sense to you.
[50:55] Why you're still believing? Because all
[50:57] the external
[50:59] uh uh evidence is that you've been
[51:02] abandoned.
[51:04] You're alone. You're so you're you're
[51:07] weak. You can't function. Well, if it's
[51:09] real agape love that you have that's
[51:12] been given to you by God himself, then
[51:15] it's something different. Even Peter
[51:18] when Jesus confront was speaking to him
[51:21] to call him to feed his sheep and his
[51:24] lambs he went between two different
[51:26] words. He says Peter
[51:30] do you agape me?
[51:32] Yes Lord you know I feel you.
[51:36] Uh
[51:37] oh you know I love you as a friend.
[51:41] That's a good love. There's nothing
[51:42] wrong with that. That's not what Jesus
[51:44] was asking. Amen.
[51:46] Once again he says, "Peter, do you agape
[51:49] me?" He says, "You know I feel you owe
[51:51] you." He comes back another time. He
[51:54] says, "Peter, do you feel me?"
[52:00] See there? That's the understanding the
[52:02] distinction there. Loving,
[52:06] truly loving. When God loves you, it
[52:08] means he's going to do whatever it takes
[52:11] for you to grow into the stature and
[52:14] image of Jesus Christ because that's
[52:16] that is his first purpose for you. So if
[52:19] that means that you have to suffer,
[52:23] that means you're going to suffer. If
[52:24] that means things need to be taken away
[52:26] from you, that means that God sees
[52:28] things on a higher level. and his
[52:31] purpose and his function for you is a
[52:33] lot higher than aeros love or stoay love
[52:38] you know just sto love a family just
[52:40] meeting your need
[52:42] you know that's the purpose of a a
[52:44] father in his family is meeting the need
[52:47] of his family well loves us like that
[52:50] but his love all those loves have to be
[52:54] are first subject to agape love which
[52:56] God see if you look at agape really
[52:59] closely
[53:00] you'll understand that it's seeing the
[53:02] intrinsic value that is in
[53:06] that individual whether it be God or a
[53:09] human or whatever it is but then it goes
[53:12] beyond that is it's it's meeting the
[53:13] need it's an action
[53:16] it's what God is doing in us
[53:21] so it's very very important for us to
[53:24] actually realize what kind of love are
[53:26] we loving God with
[53:28] amen Amen.
[53:30] And then secondarily is we have to see
[53:33] God ho how God loves it. God's love is
[53:38] manifested. The church age book tells us
[53:40] clearly it's an election.
[53:42] So God's going to do whatever it takes
[53:44] to call you to draw you. You could say
[53:47] you can say you can maybe have the false
[53:49] idea I don't have to do anything and
[53:52] I'll be saved anyways at the end. Well,
[53:55] in one way, actually that's true.
[53:59] But in another way, if you live like
[54:01] that, live anyway, and you are God's
[54:04] elect, he is going to beat that out of
[54:06] you.
[54:09] He will be sure that you don't think
[54:11] that at the end.
[54:15] We must choose. We must make choices.
[54:18] But ultimately, Jesus tells us, "You
[54:21] didn't cho choose me. I have chosen
[54:23] you." Right.
[54:24] Right. So, we have to make daily. We
[54:26] have to make choices daily. We have
[54:28] we're we're called upon to make the
[54:30] right choices. But we also understand at
[54:34] the very end that is God working in you
[54:36] both to will to choose and to do of his
[54:40] good pleasure.
[54:42] It's not us choosing and that God coming
[54:44] around and say, "Oh, he chose that. I'm
[54:47] ordaining it now." No, that's not how it
[54:50] works. That's not the revelation that's
[54:51] in Who is this Melzdc?
[54:54] We're a part of his life.
[54:56] And when you're a part of his life, you
[54:58] will ultimately produce his life. Every
[55:00] journey of the attribute sons of his
[55:04] spirit is different. And the timing of
[55:07] the quickening of that is different.
[55:09] Would to God we were all quickened when
[55:10] we were eight years old
[55:12] by the spirit. But not all of us are
[55:15] quickened when we're eight years old.
[55:17] God knows that we needed some scars. God
[55:20] knows that we needed some pain. And God
[55:22] knows that we needed to fall on our face
[55:28] and he pro we probably need to fall on
[55:29] our face a few more times.
[55:32] I know. I know. I'm finding that out.
[55:38] Hey, I say no thanks, too. None of us
[55:40] want that.
[55:42] But you understand that it's coming
[55:44] anyways
[55:45] because you're still here. If he was
[55:47] done with you, you'd be home in glory.
[55:50] So, you're still here. He's still
[55:51] working. And again, the false doctrine
[55:55] of uh turning grace into disgrace is
[55:58] only done by the false seed, right? It's
[56:03] not done by the predestinated seed.
[56:06] They're battling against that idea. We
[56:08] put all of our efforts, all of our
[56:09] strength, all that we are into
[56:12] worshiping and following and glorifying
[56:14] God.
[56:16] But we understand at the end of the day
[56:17] that it is God working in you both to
[56:21] will and to do of his good pleasure. We
[56:24] work out our salvation with fear and
[56:25] trembling because it's God working in us
[56:28] to make those choices and to do of his
[56:32] good pleasure.
[56:34] My goodness, I'm way off way off my
[56:36] scripture. So,
[56:38] we're looking at or we we're trying to
[56:41] look at Galatians.
[56:43] And as we read before in verse 26,
[56:48] you're all
[56:51] sons of God, God by faith in Christ
[56:54] Jesus. And so, the place I want to go is
[56:57] to look at the process of becoming sons.
[57:00] Amen.
[57:01] Or another way to look at that and and
[57:04] to talk about it is adoption.
[57:07] So the process of becoming sons for you
[57:12] are all sons of God by faith in Christ
[57:15] Jesus. Again, you're going from a a
[57:17] child to sunship through what? Your own
[57:22] efforts, your own works? No. Through
[57:24] faith in Christ Jesus.
[57:27] Right. and and and the let's let's back
[57:30] up even further and look at the bigger
[57:32] picture with the book of Galatians. Why
[57:34] is Paul writing the book of Galatians,
[57:37] right? They they're all uh in Galatia,
[57:40] they've received the the gospel. They're
[57:42] Gentiles. They've received the Holy
[57:45] Spirit.
[57:46] Amen.
[57:46] They're a part of the new covenant. And
[57:48] then false teachers come in come in
[57:50] behind Paul after he's left and say,
[57:53] "Wait a minute. In order to be a part of
[57:54] the new covenant, you first have to be a
[57:56] part of the old covenant. So, you have
[57:58] to follow the laws. You have to follow
[58:02] uh the the the holidays. You have to
[58:05] follow the Sabbath. You have to get
[58:07] circumcised.
[58:08] Then you can receive the Holy Spirit and
[58:11] be part of the new covenant. And so,
[58:14] that's the context of what Paul is
[58:16] saying. It isn't through the law or the
[58:19] works of the law that we become sons of
[58:22] God. Amen.
[58:24] It's through faith in Christ Jesus.
[58:28] I like this. I love this verse. Once
[58:30] again, we see we're not baptized into
[58:33] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. We're
[58:34] baptized into Christ.
[58:37] And those that have been baptized into
[58:39] Christ, what what have they done?
[58:43] They've put on a garment. What garment
[58:45] is that? Christ.
[58:47] Amen.
[58:48] So you when you put on a garment, you
[58:50] actually are becoming that thing.
[58:52] There's other scriptures that talk about
[58:53] that you've put on uh the word put on
[58:57] there is not being a fake. The word put
[59:00] on is actually mean you're becoming
[59:02] that. Another place you look at uh in
[59:06] history that there was specific clothing
[59:09] for diff specific positions.
[59:12] So if you were a servant, you dressed a
[59:14] certain way. If you were aristocracy,
[59:16] you dressed a certain way. So as
[59:17] servants of Christ, there's a certain
[59:19] way that we live, right? And in order to
[59:23] do that, we put on Christ. So having put
[59:26] on Christ, we become, that's our
[59:28] position, positionally placed in Christ.
[59:31] Amen.
[59:32] All right.
[59:35] Galatians 4:1. Now I say that the heir,
[59:38] as long as he is a child, differs
[59:41] nothing from a servant, though he be
[59:43] lord of all. Now we go down and we see
[59:48] that he's speaking about adoption.
[59:50] And so when we begin to understand that
[59:54] this is Paul's
[59:56] uh big picture description of what
[59:59] adoption actually means,
[1:00:01] I'm sure you've heard it many times. I'm
[1:00:03] pretty sure I've said it a number of
[1:00:05] times myself over the pulpit, but the
[1:00:07] English interpretation of the word
[1:00:09] adoption is an incorrect
[1:00:12] uh uh interpretation. And why do I say
[1:00:15] that? In English, when we think of
[1:00:17] adoption, we think of taking someone who
[1:00:20] is not your child,
[1:00:22] going through a process and making them
[1:00:24] your child. But this is not at all what
[1:00:26] Paul is describing here. And that's not
[1:00:29] what the word huothesia means. We don't
[1:00:32] nec in our culture. We don't have this
[1:00:35] coming to manhood process,
[1:00:38] right?
[1:00:39] You know, it'd be good if we did. Might
[1:00:42] help some people
[1:00:46] would definitely help our culture. Most
[1:00:48] most cultures around the world actually
[1:00:50] do still have this
[1:00:52] process. But what it is is taking
[1:00:55] someone who's a child and that
[1:00:57] specifically Paul is using the situation
[1:00:59] where it is a place where there's an
[1:01:02] inheritance and there is like an
[1:01:03] aristocracy like we think of the old old
[1:01:06] English days where you know there's
[1:01:08] there's a lord of the manor and then he
[1:01:10] he is producing an heir and that he's
[1:01:14] training that heir. So this is the whole
[1:01:16] thing that we're looking at in Galatians
[1:01:18] 4:1. Now I say that the heir as long as
[1:01:21] he is a child differs nothing from a
[1:01:24] servant though he be lord of all. In
[1:01:27] other words, he's the he is the one
[1:01:29] that's going to follow up his father.
[1:01:31] Once his father passes away, he will
[1:01:34] then be the lord of everything. But
[1:01:36] until then, he's no different than the
[1:01:39] servant, the butler,
[1:01:41] the footman, whatever whatever position
[1:01:43] it is. his his official title being the
[1:01:47] heir uh and his training being different
[1:01:51] yet he's no different than the servants
[1:01:53] of the household, right? He is a child.
[1:01:58] It's not a fake thing. He is the child
[1:02:00] of his father,
[1:02:01] right?
[1:02:02] But he's not in positionally a son yet.
[1:02:06] Amen.
[1:02:07] Right? Because that has to do with
[1:02:09] maturity.
[1:02:11] So, so what is his process? He's under
[1:02:14] tutors and governors until the time
[1:02:16] appointed of the father. So the time
[1:02:18] appointed of the father speaks of that
[1:02:21] time where he is going to go from the
[1:02:24] age of minority to the age of majority
[1:02:27] from childhood to adulthood.
[1:02:31] Even so we when we were children were in
[1:02:35] bondage other under the elements of the
[1:02:38] world.
[1:02:40] Amen. This in in one way this means that
[1:02:44] and it s but it sounds like it's saying
[1:02:46] you know the the thing that put us under
[1:02:50] toutelage was the world we were being
[1:02:54] tutored by the world what it's actually
[1:02:56] saying and if you look further in
[1:02:58] Galatians chapter 4 is the law which the
[1:03:02] next verse I believe says the law was
[1:03:06] our school master
[1:03:09] Right?
[1:03:10] The law is our school master.
[1:03:12] Right?
[1:03:15] So
[1:03:16] the elements of the world is the law.
[1:03:18] Again, get the picture. The Galatians,
[1:03:22] they've been adopted as sons.
[1:03:26] Now you you've been adop now you've been
[1:03:27] adopted as sons.
[1:03:30] You want to go backwards.
[1:03:33] But when the fullness of the time was
[1:03:34] come, God sent forth his son made of a
[1:03:36] woman made under the law to redeem them
[1:03:39] that were under the law that we might
[1:03:42] receive the adoption of sons. We Osia.
[1:03:47] And because you are sons, God has sent
[1:03:49] forth the spirit of his son into your
[1:03:52] hearts, crying, "Aba, Father,
[1:03:55] wherefore thou art no more a servant,
[1:03:57] but a son. And if a son, then an heir of
[1:04:00] God through Christ. How be it then, when
[1:04:03] you knew not God, ye did service unto
[1:04:05] them, which by nature are no gods. But
[1:04:09] now, after that ye have known God, or
[1:04:11] rather are known of God, how turn ye
[1:04:14] again to the weak and beggarly elements,
[1:04:17] where unto you desire again to be in
[1:04:19] bondage again. What were they turning
[1:04:21] back to? What what weak and beggarly
[1:04:24] elements were they turning back to?
[1:04:26] The law.
[1:04:28] Amen.
[1:04:29] You're wanting to turn backwards. You've
[1:04:31] you've been placed as sons by receiving
[1:04:35] Christ Jesus.
[1:04:37] Right? By receiving the spirit of his
[1:04:39] son, God sent that into your hearts. Now
[1:04:42] you cry, "Aba, Father." You're in the
[1:04:44] position of sunship. You're no longer an
[1:04:49] heir that's under toutelage. Then why do
[1:04:51] you want to go backwards and be an heir
[1:04:55] under toutelage?
[1:04:57] All right. Why do we want to go
[1:04:58] backwards from walking in the spirit to
[1:05:01] walking under legalism
[1:05:04] to walking under fear to walking under
[1:05:08] control of another man? Why do we want
[1:05:10] to go backwards into that when God has
[1:05:13] set us free, has redeemed us, and has
[1:05:16] told us, "You're my son."
[1:05:18] Amen.
[1:05:18] Amen.
[1:05:18] Your name on the check is just as good
[1:05:20] as mine.
[1:05:24] Ye observe days and months and times and
[1:05:27] years. I'm afraid of you or afraid for
[1:05:31] you lest I have bestowed upon you labor
[1:05:35] in vain.
[1:05:38] Amazing.
[1:05:41] So again, see that process. We can we
[1:05:45] can even see a similar process in this
[1:05:48] day and age. You've received the
[1:05:50] revelation of the seventh seal.
[1:05:53] Amen.
[1:05:54] He's quickened you into that revelation
[1:05:56] of the seventh seal, right? I hope so.
[1:06:00] It it appears that way.
[1:06:02] Why would we want to go back into
[1:06:05] denominational spirit?
[1:06:08] Why would we want to go backwards into
[1:06:10] the place where we were being tutored
[1:06:12] and under toutelage? We are supposed to
[1:06:14] go forward.
[1:06:15] Amen. We're go supposed to go deeper
[1:06:17] into the word,
[1:06:19] right? We're supposed to catch more and
[1:06:22] more of what the prophet said.
[1:06:29] Galatians 3:10,
[1:06:32] for as many as are of the works of the
[1:06:34] law are under the curse. For it is
[1:06:35] written, cursed is everyone that
[1:06:37] continues not in all things which are
[1:06:39] written in the book of the law to do
[1:06:41] them.
[1:06:43] but that no man is justified by the law
[1:06:45] in the sight of God. It is evident the
[1:06:48] just shall live by faith and the the law
[1:06:51] is not of faith.
[1:06:53] Um but but the man that doeth them shall
[1:06:56] live in them. Christ has redeemed us
[1:06:59] from the curse of the law, being made a
[1:07:01] curse for us. For it is written, cursed
[1:07:04] is everyone that hangeth upon a tree,
[1:07:08] that the blessing of Abraham might come
[1:07:09] on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ,
[1:07:12] that we might receive the promise of the
[1:07:15] spirit through faith. Amen. So we see
[1:07:19] receive the promise of the spirit not by
[1:07:22] the works of the law.
[1:07:26] Paul speaks about that in Galatians.
[1:07:30] Uh,
[1:07:32] have you suffered so many things in
[1:07:34] vain? Oh, let me go back. There we go.
[1:07:38] This only what I learn of you received
[1:07:40] ye the spirit by the works of the law or
[1:07:42] by the hearing of faith? Are you so
[1:07:44] foolish, having begun in the spirit, are
[1:07:46] you now made perfect by the flesh? Have
[1:07:48] you suffered so many things in vain, if
[1:07:50] it be yet in vain?
[1:07:53] He therefore that ministerth to you the
[1:07:55] spirit and workketh miracles among you
[1:07:56] doeth he it by the works of the law or
[1:07:59] by the hearing of faith.
[1:08:03] Amen.
[1:08:05] It's not by the works of the law. It's
[1:08:07] not by what you deserve. It's by by his
[1:08:10] grace that he does that.
[1:08:12] Amen.
[1:08:13] He opens our hearts. He opens our minds.
[1:08:15] He draws us. He reveals himself to us.
[1:08:18] Can you give yourself a revelation?
[1:08:22] It takes God to give you the revelation.
[1:08:25] Amen.
[1:08:26] And so when the person that's
[1:08:27] ministering to to you, it's by it's all
[1:08:30] through faith.
[1:08:32] Amen.
[1:08:32] It's the hearing of faith. Faith cometh
[1:08:35] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[1:08:37] God.
[1:08:39] And so
[1:08:42] it's obvious they receive the spirit
[1:08:45] simply by hearing the word. In Acts
[1:08:48] 10:44 when Peter was would while Peter
[1:08:51] yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost
[1:08:53] fell on all them which heard the word.
[1:08:58] And so we understand as we look at this
[1:09:02] and look at faith, if you really realize
[1:09:05] it, from Genesis
[1:09:08] to Revelation, from the beginning of
[1:09:11] time to the end of time, salvation is by
[1:09:14] faith.
[1:09:14] Amen.
[1:09:17] It isn't it isn't like some
[1:09:20] dispensationalists say that under the
[1:09:22] under the Old Testament you are saved by
[1:09:24] the works of the law. Paul makes that
[1:09:26] clear. By the works of the law is no
[1:09:30] flesh saved.
[1:09:32] Amen.
[1:09:33] Right? Not only that, but the blood of
[1:09:36] bulls and goats,
[1:09:38] how how did that save you?
[1:09:42] Did it save anyone?
[1:09:44] There's no remission of sins
[1:09:46] by the blood of bulls and goats. It was
[1:09:49] it was only a type. They were to do it
[1:09:51] in faith because what was it? It wasn't
[1:09:55] that magically the blood and bulls and
[1:09:57] goats saved them. They could have, you
[1:10:00] know, you they could have a horrible
[1:10:02] mind, a filthy heart, um committing
[1:10:06] every abomination and then just go offer
[1:10:08] sacrifice and everything's fine and not
[1:10:10] believe in it. Not ex. It's something
[1:10:13] from the heart that man believes from
[1:10:16] the heart.
[1:10:17] It was always that way,
[1:10:19] right? And so if you came before the
[1:10:22] cross,
[1:10:23] what were you saved by? Putting your
[1:10:25] faith
[1:10:27] in the word of God as it's revealed for
[1:10:29] that day.
[1:10:30] If within the word for that day it said
[1:10:32] offer a sacrifice, then you obediently
[1:10:34] offered a sacrifice. But understanding
[1:10:37] that Paul says clearly in Hebrews, it
[1:10:40] should have completely blown their
[1:10:41] minds.
[1:10:43] By the blood of bulls and goats, there's
[1:10:46] no forgiveness of sins.
[1:10:48] Amen.
[1:10:48] So what is it? Well, how about after the
[1:10:50] cross? Because after the cross, where is
[1:10:52] the blood?
[1:10:56] Find me a vial of the blood,
[1:10:58] right?
[1:11:00] It It was dropped on the ground. It
[1:11:03] completed its purpose. But what is what
[1:11:05] is the significance of the blood? It's
[1:11:07] the life that was in the blood.
[1:11:08] Amen.
[1:11:09] It's the Holy Spirit coming upon us.
[1:11:12] It's the washing of water by the word.
[1:11:14] So in every age, there's a message
[1:11:16] brought. And in that age, if you receive
[1:11:20] the word, how?
[1:11:23] By faith.
[1:11:25] What is faith? Faith is a revelation.
[1:11:28] When you receive that revelation of that
[1:11:30] word for that day,
[1:11:32] amen,
[1:11:33] you're saved.
[1:11:34] The just shall live by faith. When God
[1:11:37] sees that, when he sees that faith
[1:11:40] present in you that he himself has put
[1:11:43] in there,
[1:11:44] he looks at you and says, "They're
[1:11:46] perfect.
[1:11:48] They're sinless.
[1:11:49] They never even sinned in the first
[1:11:50] place. It's all in the sea of
[1:11:52] forgetfulness."
[1:11:54] Amenise.
[1:11:57] So really, it's the word
[1:12:00] that washes the people
[1:12:03] from Genesis to Revelation. Just depends
[1:12:06] on which side of the cross you're on.
[1:12:08] But then it also depends on what word is
[1:12:11] being delivered in your age.
[1:12:13] Amen.
[1:12:14] People look at that and say, "What does
[1:12:16] that matter? I believe in Jesus." Well,
[1:12:20] that's fantastic. What if something's
[1:12:22] hidden
[1:12:24] like for a thousand years
[1:12:28] and suddenly a preacher comes and opens
[1:12:30] the Bible and
[1:12:33] you know
[1:12:36] says the just shall live by faith. It's
[1:12:38] not it's not by the seven sacraments of
[1:12:41] the church but it's by the blood of
[1:12:42] Jesus Christ and faith in that blood.
[1:12:45] When you hear that message what is your
[1:12:47] response? because that's going to judge
[1:12:50] your eternal destination.
[1:12:52] If you listen to that and say, "No, I
[1:12:54] have the pope.
[1:12:55] My safety is in the pope."
[1:12:58] Well, you haven't received the word for
[1:13:00] your age.
[1:13:02] Right? And so God knows how to get his
[1:13:06] predestinated seed in every age. You you
[1:13:10] not only
[1:13:11] are you predestinated to the age, the
[1:13:14] word that's going to meet you in that
[1:13:16] age is predestinated to you and everyone
[1:13:20] surrounding you to get you to that word.
[1:13:23] Think about that for a minute.
[1:13:28] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:13:30] It should be a very familiar quote. What
[1:13:33] is the new birth then? You'd say, "Well,
[1:13:35] brother Brandham, what is the new
[1:13:36] birth?" It is the revelation of Jesus
[1:13:39] Christ personally to you. Amen. Not you
[1:13:44] joined a church, you shook a hand, you
[1:13:45] done something different, you said a
[1:13:46] creed, you promised to live by a code of
[1:13:48] rules. But Christ, the Bible, he is the
[1:13:51] word that was revealed to you. And no
[1:13:53] matter what anybody says, what takes
[1:13:55] place, it's Christ, pastor, priest,
[1:13:59] whatever it might be, it's Christ in
[1:14:00] you. That is the revelation that the
[1:14:04] church was built upon.
[1:14:06] Amen.
[1:14:07] Amen.
[1:14:08] Amen.
[1:14:09] Amen. And it's that revelation of the
[1:14:11] word that changes you.
[1:14:13] Amen. We're we're begotten again by
[1:14:16] what? The word of truth.
[1:14:20] So it's the word of truth that we hear
[1:14:22] it with faith
[1:14:25] that brings the change, that brings the
[1:14:27] transformation to our lives.
[1:14:30] 1 John 5:1, "Whosoever believeth that
[1:14:32] Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and
[1:14:36] everyone that loveth him that begat
[1:14:38] loveth him also that is begotten of
[1:14:42] him."
[1:14:44] That's the word agape.
[1:14:48] So, right together, just as always,
[1:14:51] Brother Brandham always did it is here's
[1:14:54] the here's the here's the new birth and
[1:14:56] this is what it produces, right? The new
[1:14:59] birth produces love,
[1:15:02] right? The new birth produces life,
[1:15:06] right? But all of that, we understand
[1:15:08] all of that is in a process.
[1:15:11] The person that I I hope this is true.
[1:15:14] The person that you and I were 10, 15
[1:15:18] years ago is quite different than the
[1:15:21] person that you are today.
[1:15:24] Right? And so the love that you had then
[1:15:27] is not as mature as it is today or I
[1:15:31] hope that's the case for me.
[1:15:36] And so there is a there is a process
[1:15:39] that we entered into. Now the process
[1:15:42] that we entered into is not what saves
[1:15:44] us. Right? It's him doing the work
[1:15:48] within us that saves us.
[1:15:50] The process that is going on within us
[1:15:53] is produced by the work that he's done.
[1:15:56] So one follows the other. But the one
[1:15:58] doesn't the the the the work that the
[1:16:00] change that he's working in us is not
[1:16:04] what saves us. Right? It's Christ has
[1:16:07] saved us.
[1:16:08] Amen.
[1:16:10] The word has saved us. The revealing of
[1:16:12] it into our hearts is what quickens that
[1:16:14] seed gene to life, which then makes us
[1:16:18] subject to the word of God.
[1:16:21] Makes our lives subject to the word of
[1:16:23] God.
[1:16:26] John 1 12 and 13.
[1:16:30] But as many as received him, to to them
[1:16:33] gave he power to become the sons of God,
[1:16:38] even to them that believe on his name,
[1:16:42] which were born not of blood, nor of the
[1:16:45] will of flesh, nor of the will of man,
[1:16:49] but of God.
[1:16:51] Amen. So he when we receive him that in
[1:16:56] itself gives us the power to become the
[1:17:00] sons of God. Again no man can come to me
[1:17:04] unless the father draws it first.
[1:17:06] Yeah.
[1:17:07] Right. So we we can't come to him of our
[1:17:10] own will and of our own accord.
[1:17:12] As I'm never going to get to it, but as
[1:17:16] Romans nine says, it's not of him that
[1:17:18] willth or of him that runth, but of God
[1:17:20] that showeth mercy. He will have mercy
[1:17:22] on whom he have mercy and whom he will
[1:17:25] he hardenth.
[1:17:27] So God having mer and I've heard this
[1:17:30] many times especially overseas. Uh if
[1:17:33] God chooses to have mercy on some how is
[1:17:36] that fair? And I say exactly
[1:17:39] exactly right. If God were to give us
[1:17:42] what what was fair there would be no one
[1:17:45] saved.
[1:17:47] Everyone would be lost and in hell. So
[1:17:51] what if God seeing that actually no one
[1:17:54] seeks after God? I think that's my next
[1:17:56] one of my next scriptures. Yeah. Romans
[1:17:58] 3:9. What then? Are we better than they?
[1:18:01] No. And no wise, for we have proved
[1:18:03] before proved both Jews and Gentiles
[1:18:06] that they're all under sin. As it is
[1:18:08] written, there's none righteous, know
[1:18:09] not one. There is none that understands
[1:18:12] that. There's none that seeks after God.
[1:18:15] Right?
[1:18:16] And so it's God that seeks after us. We
[1:18:19] don't seek after him. We don't go after
[1:18:21] God. God goes after his predestinated
[1:18:25] seed,
[1:18:26] right? And so it's not our choosing.
[1:18:29] Yes, we have to choose,
[1:18:33] but ultimately we understand that it's
[1:18:35] we're we're choosing him because he
[1:18:38] first loved us. We love him because he
[1:18:40] first loved us.
[1:18:42] And so it's his choosing of us. And so
[1:18:45] him giving us power to become sons of
[1:18:48] God. It's look at the big picture of
[1:18:50] that. When he quickens the word in us,
[1:18:54] what does it do? That's the power
[1:18:57] to make us into that position of sons of
[1:19:01] God.
[1:19:02] That doesn't take away the fact that we
[1:19:04] were already his attributes. We were
[1:19:08] already children as the scripture we
[1:19:10] read in Galatians. Because you are sons,
[1:19:14] God sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:19:16] into your heart whereby we cry,
[1:19:18] "Aba, Father." So why are we already
[1:19:20] sons? Because we're a part of his life.
[1:19:22] We're in his mind. We're his attributes
[1:19:24] before the foundation of the world.
[1:19:26] Amen.
[1:19:28] And so that's that's why it's so
[1:19:30] beautiful when it tells us that we were
[1:19:32] we were not born
[1:19:34] of blood. Well, I thought I was born of
[1:19:37] blood.
[1:19:39] I could I was sure I had blood. When I
[1:19:44] went to the doctor, I was I was
[1:19:45] convinced I had blood. I was born of
[1:19:48] blood, but that's not what this is
[1:19:49] talking about.
[1:19:51] I was born of the will of the flesh
[1:19:53] through my parents. That's not what this
[1:19:55] is talking about. I was born of the will
[1:19:58] of man. Well, actually, I was a surprise
[1:20:00] to my parents. So,
[1:20:05] some of y'all were born by the will of
[1:20:07] man, but I I was it was contrary to my
[1:20:09] parents will, but God had a
[1:20:11] predestinated thought that needed to
[1:20:12] come forth. And so, he just bypassed
[1:20:15] their choosing.
[1:20:18] But that's not what this is talking
[1:20:19] about. This is talking about a different
[1:20:21] kind of birth. This is talking about the
[1:20:24] new birth.
[1:20:25] This blows to pieces the denominational
[1:20:28] preaching that you hear. the Billy
[1:20:30] Graham gospel,
[1:20:32] right?
[1:20:33] Come. Make your choice. Make your
[1:20:35] decision. Everybody, you have to make a
[1:20:36] decision. Preach the word and the
[1:20:39] predestinated seed will respond to that.
[1:20:41] Amen.
[1:20:42] Right.
[1:20:43] Amen.
[1:20:44] No matter what.
[1:20:46] And I'm not saying you don't have to
[1:20:47] make a decision, but when the gospel
[1:20:49] that's being preached is uh all about
[1:20:52] the decision and everything is into your
[1:20:56] human will, they're ignoring scripture.
[1:20:59] Amen. It's
[1:21:00] not of him that wleth or of him that
[1:21:02] runth. We're not born of the will of
[1:21:04] man. Can you give when you come forward
[1:21:06] and you know if you got saved at Billy
[1:21:09] Graham, saved at a Billy Graham event, I
[1:21:12] don't I don't say that people aren't,
[1:21:14] but I got saved so many times with Billy
[1:21:16] Graham and all this different stuff
[1:21:18] growing up going to Baptist church.
[1:21:22] I I walked forward at a Billy Graham
[1:21:23] event. Didn't change me one lick. went
[1:21:26] straight back to the drinking and
[1:21:28] smoking weed,
[1:21:31] but it was emotional.
[1:21:35] This idea that you can choose, you make
[1:21:38] a choice and then God causes you to be
[1:21:41] born again. It's very strange to me.
[1:21:45] It's a foreign gospel to my ears. It's
[1:21:48] God
[1:21:50] that draws you. No man can come to me
[1:21:52] unless the father draws him first.
[1:21:54] Amen.
[1:22:04] Skip forward just a little bit.
[1:22:07] Yeah. John 6:63.
[1:22:10] It is the spirit that quickenth.
[1:22:14] The flesh profits nothing.
[1:22:18] So it's the spirit that the word
[1:22:20] quickenth means to give life or to bring
[1:22:23] to life. So it's the spirit that brings
[1:22:26] life,
[1:22:29] not the flesh.
[1:22:30] Amen.
[1:22:31] It's not our flesh bringing the word to
[1:22:35] life within us, right? It's the Holy
[1:22:38] Spirit quickening us to life. Another
[1:22:42] way it says the flesh profits nothing.
[1:22:44] Or another way another way to look at
[1:22:46] that is the flesh uh gives no help at
[1:22:49] all. or the the flesh or human effort
[1:22:51] accomplishes nothing.
[1:22:54] Amen.
[1:22:55] The words that I speak unto you, they
[1:22:58] are spirit and they are life.
[1:23:01] Jesus speaking to the Pharisees in John
[1:23:06] uh chapter 8. He's going back and forth
[1:23:10] with them and he says, "The reason
[1:23:12] you've rejected me is because the word
[1:23:15] has no place in you." Right?
[1:23:18] Think about that for a second.
[1:23:21] So, and he says there of their father,
[1:23:24] the devil. Right? And so, that's that's
[1:23:26] that place where he tells him that. And
[1:23:29] and so we realize that there in order
[1:23:32] for the word to be quickened to within
[1:23:35] us, there has to be a place for that
[1:23:38] word to be
[1:23:39] so that when the word that is spirit and
[1:23:42] life is spoken
[1:23:45] and it's it goes to the place that it
[1:23:47] needs to go to, it can bring it to life.
[1:23:50] It couldn't it couldn't quicken anything
[1:23:51] in the Pharisees
[1:23:53] that were listening to him because there
[1:23:54] was there was no receiver there.
[1:23:57] Amen. If you look at it like that as a
[1:23:59] as a Wi-Fi signal, if I get a brick
[1:24:03] outside and I take it and as hard as I
[1:24:06] try to point the router at that brick,
[1:24:10] it's not going to do anything because
[1:24:12] there's no receiver in it. You have to
[1:24:14] have a receiver in it to get the
[1:24:17] information from the router into
[1:24:20] whatever device you have in your hand.
[1:24:22] And so that is what the predestinated
[1:24:24] seed have. They have a receiver
[1:24:27] inside of them that when the word is
[1:24:29] preached, it quickens that receiver to
[1:24:32] to life.
[1:24:34] Something happens. But if there is no
[1:24:36] receiver, the word can come there for
[1:24:38] 30, 40 years, a thousand times and
[1:24:41] nothing happens.
[1:24:42] Certainly maybe externally they get an
[1:24:45] anointing. Externally character starts
[1:24:47] to happen because you birds of a feather
[1:24:49] flock together. You are who you hang
[1:24:51] around and so forth. something might
[1:24:53] happen, but that's a lot different than
[1:24:55] having the very life of Christ living
[1:24:58] inside of you. That will put you in a
[1:25:00] place like Daniel where everyone is
[1:25:03] against you and you'll still manifest
[1:25:05] the life of Christ
[1:25:07] within you. Amen.
[1:25:13] Works as faith expressed. Man, I just
[1:25:16] love that message that brother Brandon
[1:25:18] preaches there in Shreveport.
[1:25:21] It it you know sometimes when you think
[1:25:24] about healing and you hear healing
[1:25:26] preached sometimes you get a little
[1:25:28] discouraged because you think I believe.
[1:25:30] Why am I not healed?
[1:25:32] Why isn't this healed? I believe.
[1:25:34] Well,
[1:25:36] that's this helps us understand. Brother
[1:25:39] Brandham talks about it. It's a
[1:25:40] revelation. God has to drop that into
[1:25:43] your heart by spiritual revelation. When
[1:25:45] he drops that, then it's finished.
[1:25:47] Amen.
[1:25:49] You know, it's it it really it comes
[1:25:51] back to God's grace
[1:25:54] because even healing even healing is
[1:25:56] God's grace, right? It's the children's
[1:25:58] bread. And sometimes God, we talked
[1:26:01] about God's agape love. His agape love
[1:26:04] looks and and sees what we're going
[1:26:07] through and says,
[1:26:10] "I need Jason to go through this.
[1:26:12] I could heal him, but unless he goes
[1:26:15] through this is this is not going to
[1:26:18] work this attribute out that I need to
[1:26:22] bring draw out of him. And so I won't
[1:26:25] let him I won't let him die, but after
[1:26:29] he suffered a little while, it'll make
[1:26:31] him perfect.
[1:26:33] Amen.
[1:26:35] And so really, we realize as we look at
[1:26:38] this is it's a revelation. Healing is a
[1:26:40] revelation. Yes.
[1:26:41] Salvation is a revelation.
[1:26:43] Amen.
[1:26:44] Now, faith is a revelation from God.
[1:26:46] Faith is a revelation. There's where I
[1:26:48] want to stay there just a moment. It's a
[1:26:50] revelation. He has revealed it to you by
[1:26:52] his grace. It's nothing you did. You
[1:26:55] didn't work yourself up into faith. You
[1:26:57] ever have faith? It's given to you by
[1:26:59] the grace of God. And God reveals it to
[1:27:02] you. Therefore, faith is a revelation.
[1:27:05] And the whole church of God is built
[1:27:09] upon the revelation.
[1:27:11] Amen.
[1:27:13] That's wonderful.
[1:27:15] Very familiar scripture. Ephesians
[1:27:17] 2:8-9. For by grace are you saved
[1:27:19] through faith and that not of
[1:27:21] yourselves. It is the gift of God, not
[1:27:24] of works, lest any man should boast.
[1:27:27] Amen.
[1:27:28] Amen. So even our faith is a gift of
[1:27:32] God. It's not from ourselves. It's not
[1:27:34] human faith. It's the faith of the son
[1:27:36] of God.
[1:27:37] Amen.
[1:27:38] Imparted unto us.
[1:27:42] And again, can you obtain that yourself?
[1:27:45] Can you can you go to a monastery and
[1:27:47] get alone and work yourself up to the
[1:27:50] place where you have the faith as the
[1:27:52] son of God?
[1:27:54] Many times we act and live like we can
[1:27:57] do that
[1:27:59] and we forget that it's him living in
[1:28:02] you working out the faith. We can only
[1:28:06] allow the right atmosphere to come for
[1:28:09] him to bring what he needs to bring.
[1:28:12] We do what we need we know we need to do
[1:28:14] by the scriptures but understanding that
[1:28:17] even that it's him working in us.
[1:28:20] Amen. To me that brings such rest
[1:28:23] because it's not based on how good I am
[1:28:26] at any particular thing.
[1:28:29] When we start to look at something as
[1:28:31] somebody is so good at this or they're
[1:28:33] so much more consecrated or they're so
[1:28:35] much more this, you know, they couldn't
[1:28:39] do that unless God placed that desire
[1:28:42] within them because the human flesh
[1:28:45] doesn't want to do that.
[1:28:47] You know, I I can remember
[1:28:50] when I first
[1:28:54] received the message, I had such a
[1:28:56] hunger
[1:28:57] to feed on the message.
[1:28:59] Amen.
[1:28:59] If I tried to do that again, I would
[1:29:01] die.
[1:29:04] I would listen to six, seven, eight,
[1:29:06] nine messages a day. I didn't do
[1:29:08] anything. I was in college. I did the
[1:29:10] bare minimum work to get my college done
[1:29:13] and then I was back to listening to
[1:29:14] Brother Brandham. And then I'd read and
[1:29:16] then I'd schedule something with one of
[1:29:18] my friends and I'd go witness the
[1:29:19] message to him.
[1:29:21] It was like all day every day all I did
[1:29:24] was listen to brother Bam. Then then I
[1:29:26] got out of school. I was working and I
[1:29:29] had a job where I could take a it's
[1:29:31] going to show how old I am. I had one of
[1:29:33] them old boom boxes that I brought with
[1:29:35] me because the truck I worked in didn't
[1:29:37] have it. And I just carried I had they
[1:29:39] gave me a solo job and I just carried
[1:29:41] that thing wherever. And I listened to
[1:29:42] brother Brandham. My brain would
[1:29:44] literally explode if I tried to do that
[1:29:46] again. What was it? It was an anointing
[1:29:48] from the Lord
[1:29:50] that drove me to that.
[1:29:52] Amen.
[1:29:53] I would like to do that again.
[1:29:55] I can't.
[1:29:57] And so on the one hand, I could say,
[1:30:00] man, I just I'm such a failure. I used
[1:30:02] to be so on fire for God. God has
[1:30:06] seasons. God has purposes. God has
[1:30:09] functions for every time of life. In
[1:30:11] fact, if I did do that, I would be
[1:30:13] called an irresponsible father.
[1:30:18] It it wouldn't be it wouldn't be right.
[1:30:20] Now, God might anoint you to do that.
[1:30:22] God God might take you and anoint you
[1:30:24] for a season and you say, "Okay, I'm
[1:30:25] going to going to retire from work and
[1:30:28] spend all my time listening to the
[1:30:30] message."
[1:30:32] And whatever it might be, it might be
[1:30:33] prayer. It might be a season in life
[1:30:35] where you're anointed. You could pray
[1:30:37] two, three, four hours a day.
[1:30:40] Yeah. I would like to say I can do that
[1:30:42] now. I can't.
[1:30:43] Amen.
[1:30:44] Because it it God does these things in
[1:30:47] us. We get ourselves so worked up. I'm
[1:30:50] not asking you to be lazy. I'm not
[1:30:53] telling you
[1:30:54] forget it. Just wait until God anoints
[1:30:56] you to do it. I'm telling you that when
[1:30:58] God anoints you to do it, you will do
[1:31:00] it.
[1:31:01] In the meantime, do what you know to do.
[1:31:03] Read the Bible. Listen to the message as
[1:31:06] much as you possibly can every day. Even
[1:31:08] if it's just 20 minutes.
[1:31:10] Spend time in prayer.
[1:31:12] If you're a father, lead your family in
[1:31:14] prayer and listening to the message and
[1:31:17] and reading the Bible.
[1:31:20] Do the things that you know you're
[1:31:21] supposed to do, understanding that God
[1:31:24] when God when the season is for more,
[1:31:26] God will take you into those seasons.
[1:31:28] Amen.
[1:31:29] Being a you know, you you could be a a
[1:31:33] mother of a young children or a
[1:31:35] homeschool mother or whatever it is.
[1:31:38] those those things you hey you should
[1:31:40] pray for three hours a day and the the
[1:31:42] housewife goes
[1:31:46] God will anoint you for that if he wants
[1:31:48] you to do that
[1:31:49] it's just as spiritual for you to
[1:31:51] fulfill your duty as a Christian to your
[1:31:54] husband and to your home as it is to
[1:31:56] pray
[1:31:57] living the life of Christ in the midst
[1:31:59] of what you're doing then is like a
[1:32:02] prayer
[1:32:04] right
[1:32:06] and so re realize that it is God working
[1:32:09] in you both to will and to do of his
[1:32:10] good pleasure. Now, if you have no
[1:32:12] desire for God, if you're just going
[1:32:15] after entertainment, you're going after
[1:32:17] fun times and that's the whole focus of
[1:32:20] your life, we understand there's
[1:32:22] something that's the matter
[1:32:25] and there there's a there's a core issue
[1:32:28] in your heart that's taking you away
[1:32:30] from God. I don't say that you don't
[1:32:31] have God,
[1:32:33] but perhaps there's a scar, there's a
[1:32:34] bruise, there's a pain, there's
[1:32:36] something there that's there's lack of
[1:32:38] forgiveness, whatever it might be that's
[1:32:41] causing you to be in a place where
[1:32:42] you're you don't have a desire for God.
[1:32:45] Well, get it out of the way.
[1:32:47] Amen.
[1:32:48] Take action. Take the steps. Have the
[1:32:50] difficult conversations that you need to
[1:32:52] have. Say the things that you need to do
[1:32:54] so that there's nothing between your
[1:32:57] soul and the savior. Hallelujah.
[1:32:59] Because anytime there's something that
[1:33:01] you you that we've done or there's some
[1:33:03] kind of little thing you have against
[1:33:06] someone, it's going to it's going to
[1:33:08] manifest in your spiritual life. And
[1:33:11] especially in your desire for God,
[1:33:14] you'll you'll run from him. Like Jonah,
[1:33:19] you'll run from him, but he's going to
[1:33:20] run faster. So just make it right and
[1:33:23] avoid the pain and avoid the suffering
[1:33:26] and the trials that he will take us
[1:33:28] through because he loves us. As I said
[1:33:31] before, agape love, it means God's going
[1:33:34] to do whatever it takes
[1:33:36] to complete you.
[1:33:38] Amen.
[1:33:38] To bring you to that place. That's what
[1:33:41] ultimately love is. And that's what love
[1:33:43] is for us to one another. The greatest
[1:33:46] desire we should have for other people
[1:33:49] is not that they be happy, but that they
[1:33:52] grow spiritually. That's the purpose and
[1:33:55] function of the body of Christ.
[1:33:56] Musicians, if you'd come, that's the
[1:33:59] purpose and function of the body of
[1:34:00] Christ
[1:34:03] is to build one another up, right? What
[1:34:05] is building one another up mean? Just
[1:34:08] saying it's okay. Everything's fine. No
[1:34:11] problem. Building one another up. The
[1:34:14] purpose of that is actually to cause
[1:34:17] them to grow spiritually. And all of us
[1:34:20] have things in our lives that need to
[1:34:23] get out of it, that need to change,
[1:34:27] habits, attitudes,
[1:34:30] um, lack of forgiveness, whatever it
[1:34:33] might be that's there.
[1:34:35] We have to get that that God is going to
[1:34:37] take those things out of our life.
[1:34:39] Amen.
[1:34:39] And
[1:34:43] I never really finished my message or
[1:34:45] got to the whole end of it. So, probably
[1:34:48] be another month before I get to it.
[1:34:51] But, let me just
[1:34:54] give a a little bit of a
[1:34:57] completion.
[1:35:01] You know, we we got to a few of the
[1:35:04] parts. You know, number one in our
[1:35:06] stages of adoption,
[1:35:08] we're first our first existence
[1:35:13] is not here on this earth. It's in the
[1:35:16] mind of God. Part of his life, part of
[1:35:19] his thoughts, one of his attributes that
[1:35:22] needs to be expressed. Then from there,
[1:35:25] Brother Brandham tells us that we're a
[1:35:28] seed gene born in the flesh to be
[1:35:31] tempted by sin.
[1:35:32] Amen.
[1:35:33] Isn't that interesting? And that's what
[1:35:35] we're here for is for that seed gene to
[1:35:38] meet difficulties and trials and
[1:35:40] temptations so that what? So that we
[1:35:43] fail? No. So that we overcome
[1:35:46] those things.
[1:35:49] But that seed gene in order to overcome
[1:35:52] has to go to step three, which is to be
[1:35:54] quickened by the new birth. Amen.
[1:35:57] So that's as far as we got this time. We
[1:36:01] thank the Lord for his goodness. Let's
[1:36:02] stand.
[1:36:03] Amen.
[1:36:05] Heavenly Father,
[1:36:08] Lord, we thank you so much for your
[1:36:10] word,
[1:36:13] we thank you so much for your
[1:36:16] sovereign work within our lives,
[1:36:20] Lord. It brings brings us to this place
[1:36:22] of rest, Lord. Knowing that under the
[1:36:25] seventh seal there's rest. The seventh
[1:36:28] day there was rest and the seventh seal
[1:36:30] there's rest. Lord, we thank you for
[1:36:32] that.
[1:36:34] Lord, we ask that you would move in
[1:36:37] every life, Lord, if there's anything in
[1:36:39] any of us, Lord, that we need to to deal
[1:36:42] with
[1:36:44] in our family or amongst one another or
[1:36:48] whatever it is, Lord,
[1:36:50] may we not let it stay in the way,
[1:36:53] Lord, to to poison us and to hinder what
[1:36:58] you're trying to do within us. Lord,
[1:37:01] cleanse us, change us,
[1:37:05] transform us, Lord, by the renewing of
[1:37:06] our minds.
[1:37:08] We commit ourselves to you in Jesus
[1:37:10] name. Amen.
[1:37:19] [Music]
[1:37:21] Amen.
[1:37:23] Let's just worship him for a few
[1:37:24] minutes.
[1:37:26] More
[1:37:27] of you.
[1:37:29] [Music]
[1:37:33] more of you.
[1:37:37] [Music]
[1:37:40] I had it all,
[1:37:44] but what I need is more of you.

[1:37:55] I've had my feel,
[1:38:00] but yet I hunger
[1:38:05] still.
[1:38:06] [Music]
[1:38:08] Empty and bare.
[1:38:12] Lord, hear my prayer for more of you.
[1:38:22] More of you.
[1:38:29] More of you.
[1:38:33] [Music]
[1:38:36] I've had it all,
[1:38:40] but what I need is more of you.
[1:38:46] Yes, Lord. Amen.
[1:38:50] of things I've had my fear,
[1:38:56] but yet I hunger
[1:39:01] still.
[1:39:04] Empty and bare.
[1:39:08] Lord, hear my prayer for more of you.
[1:39:18] More More of you.
[1:39:22] [Music]
[1:39:25] More of you.
[1:39:30] [Music]
[1:39:33] I've had it all,
[1:39:36] but what I need is more of you.
[1:39:46] of things I've had my fear.
[1:39:52] [Music]
[1:39:54] I hunger
[1:39:57] still
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:40:00] empty and bear.
[1:40:03] Lord, hear my prayer for more
[1:40:08] of you.
[1:40:12] Amen. We have a prayer request that came
[1:40:14] in from
[1:40:17] uh Sister Sarah Smith. Um,
[1:40:22] Brother Frank Prader asks that we
[1:40:24] remember brother David Ristler and his
[1:40:26] family. His 10-year-old grandson Jet
[1:40:28] Ristler passed away Friday. He has
[1:40:31] fought leukemia for a few years, but
[1:40:33] Satan is not one. Young brother Jet has
[1:40:36] run into the arms of the Lord and is
[1:40:38] safe. pray for the family and the Lord
[1:40:41] give them strength and peace and
[1:40:42] comfort. Amen. Let's pray for them.

[1:40:52] My goodness, what a what a heartbreak.
[1:40:55] And
[1:40:57] Lord, no doubt
[1:40:59] just feeling the depths of that. And I
[1:41:01] pray Lord that you'd be their comfort
[1:41:04] Lord that you'd just draw near to them
[1:41:07] knowing Lord that he's
[1:41:11] even early entered into his rest but yet
[1:41:14] Lord the family having broken hearts.
[1:41:18] Lord I pray that you'd just minister to
[1:41:19] them Lord that you'd send the saints
[1:41:22] Lord to to be a be a help and be a
[1:41:25] strength to them Lord and and just give
[1:41:28] them peace Lord.
[1:41:30] We just commit them into your hands,
[1:41:32] Father.
[1:41:34] Lord, and we want to just commit
[1:41:35] everyone here into your hands, Lord. Go
[1:41:37] before us, Lord. Be with us, Lord. Do
[1:41:41] the work in us. Complete it, Lord.
[1:41:43] Knowing that you promised to do it until
[1:41:45] the day of Jesus Christ. We ask this in
[1:41:48] Jesus' name. Amen. You can stay in
[1:41:51] worship if you want, but otherwise
[1:41:52] you're dismissed. God bless you. Glory
[1:41:57] lifts me up
[1:42:01] and every day I live.

[1:42:14] And it gets easier
[1:42:18] to
[1:42:19] understand
[1:42:21] this road I'm traveling down.
[1:42:27] No more wondering
[1:42:31] or wavering.
[1:42:34] I'm standing on solidly
[1:42:37] ground.
[1:42:40] Now I know I'm headed to my future home.
