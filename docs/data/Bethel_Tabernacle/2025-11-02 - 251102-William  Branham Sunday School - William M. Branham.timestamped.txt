[7:46] You know, there's something about it
[7:48] that when we see our Lord Jesus do
[7:51] things
[7:53] and can know that it's him that nothing
[7:56] else could do it but him, we just simply
[7:59] when we get together, we just everybody
[8:01] wants to testify.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to say something
[8:05] and they want to talk about it. You
[8:08] could have a revival at your church. The
[8:10] pastor can speak a marvelous message or
[8:13] the evangelist or whoever it might be or
[8:15] you can see some certain thing take
[8:17] place or something in the neighborhood
[8:19] someone was healed. The neighbors get
[8:21] together and talk about it. How
[8:23] marvelous was you there? You should have
[8:25] seen it. It was the most outstanding
[8:27] thing. Something about the works of God
[8:30] that thrills man's heart more than
[8:32] anything else that happens. Amen.
[8:34] There's it's just an unforgettable
[8:36] experiences when we come in contact with
[8:39] the Lord Jesus and see the things that
[8:41] he does.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; So great and marvelous is his ways.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; Now we find out that they were rejoicing
[8:50] over the works that had been done in
[8:52] that day's revival and perhaps I would
[8:55] liken us tonight in the same manner. Uh
[8:59] we have just witnessed one of the
[9:01] greatest revivals.
[9:03] I believe that the world has ever seen
[9:05] in these last 1015 years. It's been a a
[9:09] revival not just like the days of Billy
[9:12] Sunday or the days of the Welch revival
[9:15] or the days of of Wesland revival or the
[9:19] Moody revival or Billy Sunday revival.
[9:22] It's been a worldwide sweeping affair
[9:25] around the world.
[9:27] great healing services and great revival
[9:30] fires is burnt on practically every hill
[9:33] there is in the world
[9:35] &gt;&gt; right tonight way over in the lands of
[9:38] Africa down in China Japan THIS GOSPEL
[9:43] IS BEING PREACHED AND people are being
[9:44] healed right this very minute
[9:46] &gt;&gt; around and around the worldise
[9:49] &gt;&gt; it's been one of the greatest revivals
[9:50] because I believe it's one of the last
[9:54] revivals this world has seen
[9:56] &gt;&gt; a world's sweeping revival.
[9:59] But now in the last few years, it's
[10:03] quietened down. You don't notice the
[10:06] enthusiasm in the people that used to
[10:08] be.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; I remember having the privilege by the
[10:11] Holy Spirit to spearhead that revival.
[10:13] It started that angel of the Lord
[10:15] appeared on the river and said that
[10:18] &gt;&gt; about many years ago. And to see it
[10:21] happen and see it set ministers hearts
[10:23] of fire everywhere. Revival broke out.
[10:26] Why? You could just simply walk into a
[10:28] building and the people just get up out
[10:30] OF THEIR CS AND STRETCHERS AND WALK AWAY
[10:32] HEALED.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; You didn't even have to say ONE WORD.
[10:35] JUST JUST BEING THERE. That's all it
[10:37] taken. I remember one night in Van
[10:39] Dailyaly, Illinois. Walked into the
[10:41] meeting and no more had been in the
[10:44] meeting over five minutes. AND THERE
[10:47] WASN'T A FEEBLE PERSON around the place
[10:49] anywhere.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[10:51] &gt;&gt; Wheelchairs pushed out and piled up.
[10:53] HALLELUJAH.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; BLIND WAS SEEING and deaf and dumb
[10:56] speaking and and just simply it the
[10:59] spirit of the Lord was present and it
[11:01] just healed a whole group of them.
[11:03] &gt;&gt; Now that's when you can do something
[11:05] when revival is going. But let that
[11:07] revival fire die down. Then you can
[11:10] hardly the people are still Christians
[11:12] but they're not revived INTO THAT SPIRIT
[11:15] THAT GREAT atmosphere that does
[11:17] something. It's just like in a forge in
[11:20] A BLACKSMITH SHOP. YOU'VE GOT TO GET THE
[11:22] IRON HOT BEFORE YOU GO TO pounding it on
[11:26] the anvil. If you don't, you'll never
[11:28] straighten it out. That's what it takes
[11:30] TO HAVE A REVIVAL IS EVERYBODY UNDER THE
[11:33] HEAT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[11:35] &gt;&gt; that's brought down the powers of God
[11:37] and a revival moving. Then there's
[11:40] prayer meetings going day and night,
[11:42] every minute everywhere while the people
[11:44] wouldn't even leave the grounds. I
[11:46] remember in Jonesboro, Arkansas, when I
[11:49] first started my about my third meeting,
[11:51] first in St. Louis, then at Carnegie,
[11:53] then down to Jonesboro, the paper stated
[11:56] 28,000 people in the meeting for 20 or
[12:00] 30 miles from the city with this tent
[12:02] set up. You couldn't get a farmhouse to
[12:04] stay in little city of Jonesboro.
[12:08] and people coming for miles, packing
[12:11] lanterns, walking through the jungles,
[12:13] catch a a bus and come. I sat out in the
[12:16] wilderness one evening praying before
[12:18] the service started. I seen young ladies
[12:21] coming with their shoes and stockings
[12:22] under their arm. Then before they get
[12:24] down there, stop and brush off the dust
[12:26] from their feet, put on their stockings
[12:28] and and and shoes and go into the
[12:30] meeting. And I've seen them lay their
[12:32] sick children under old cotton trucks
[12:36] AND STAY THERE DAY AND NIGHT.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; Hold papers and canvas over while it was
[12:42] raining. STORM OF BLOWING, NOT LEAVE
[12:44] THEIR PLACE WAITING JUST TO GET INSIDE
[12:48] the building.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; There's where the blind was seeing, the
[12:52] deaf was hearing. And the MINISTRY
[12:54] TONIGHT IS A 100 MILES BEYOND THAT. BUT
[12:56] THE revival fires has died down.
[12:59] See the people walk up there and say
[13:01] just point your finger say well do you
[13:03] believe brother that's all he's out and
[13:05] gone that's all it had to be done they
[13:08] believe the revival is a moving now
[13:11] these disciples had seen that and in a
[13:14] amateur form they were living the joy
[13:19] while Jesus was resting of what they'd
[13:21] seen done that day and I think the
[13:23] revival was doing something like that
[13:25] that we're now just living in a
[13:27] quietening time while he's resting uh
[13:31] maybe between the meetings or the
[13:34] revival and his coming and we are
[13:37] rejoicing over the things that we have
[13:40] seen done during the time of this
[13:41] revival.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; Great wonderful works. No matter what
[13:46] the world says, we still seen it done.
[13:50] It's a statement. It's a fact. It was
[13:52] done. They must have took an opportunity
[13:54] while the sales was going along pretty
[13:57] well to talk about him, about his acts,
[14:03] about his claims, about his messiahship.
[14:07] Many of them might of these disciples
[14:10] might have spoke of what they had seen
[14:13] done one to another just like we do
[14:15] during the time of the revival at at
[14:17] Shreport, during the time of the revival
[14:20] at at some other town. would talk about
[14:22] it now. That's the way they were doing.
[14:25] Maybe it was Simon as we talked about
[14:28] last night saying, "Well, when Andrew
[14:31] told me about him, I was just a little
[14:33] bit skeptic." But when he told me who I
[14:36] was
[14:37] &gt;&gt; and who my father was, that took all the
[14:40] guess out of me. I I believed it. Then
[14:43] it might have been that Philip might
[14:44] have said some of the other way. It
[14:46] might have been Andrew says, "We talked
[14:48] about the lady at the well last night.
[14:51] might have been talking about her when
[14:53] they said something like this. Brethren,
[14:55] you know when my strange time was
[15:00] when I we went away to get some fiddles
[15:02] and we come back and we're standing
[15:04] outside the bushes and seen him talking
[15:05] to this ill famed woman, we thought in
[15:10] our hearts, what if uh some of the
[15:13] priests would come up and see this our
[15:15] master talking to a woman of this
[15:17] caliber? What would they say about him?
[15:21] And then we remember how we knew that
[15:24] had confidence in him that it was for
[15:27] some purpose that he was talking to her.
[15:30] And then when he told her, "Go get your
[15:32] husband and come here." And she said, "I
[15:36] have no husband." How our hearts jump
[15:39] because we thought there's one time
[15:41] there's a failure. Jesus had told the
[15:44] woman that she had go get her husband
[15:48] when she had no husband. You remember
[15:50] the look that we had on each other's
[15:52] face as we marveled to think that all
[15:55] the confidence we had in him and here it
[15:57] was dropped all of a sudden. Then we
[16:00] find immediately he spoke UP AND SAID,
[16:02] "YOU'VE TOLD THE TRUTH FOR YOU'VE HAD
[16:05] FIVE HUSBANDS and the one you have now
[16:07] is not yours."
[16:08] Then when she recognized him then as the
[16:11] Messiah, the Messiah of God, and said
[16:14] there that we know that Messiah's
[16:18] coming, he must be a prophet, for we
[16:20] know when the Messiah cometh, he's going
[16:21] to do this. And the testimony in that
[16:24] city, that woman's testimony had bearing
[16:27] on the people of the city.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; Then it might have been young John that
[16:31] said, you know, I tell you what made it
[16:35] real to me. that day when he broke the
[16:38] bread. Now we was all hungry and you'd
[16:41] went out into the wilderness and we
[16:42] couldn't find him and there we met him
[16:44] and all the multitudes came around and
[16:47] the first thing you know we find him
[16:50] saying send him away to the city to get
[16:52] some food and and he told us to feed a
[16:55] man and he got those five biscuits and
[16:59] two little fish and he broke that bread
[17:04] and I noticed his hand when he would
[17:06] reach back for another piece of bread
[17:08] that biscuit It has grown out again.
[17:13] Reach back. That fish has grown out
[17:14] again. Not only the regular fish, but it
[17:17] was a cooked fish
[17:19] &gt;&gt; already grow back again. What kind of an
[17:22] Adam did he turn loose? Brethren, cooked
[17:25] fish, cooked bread, bypass the growing.
[17:27] We know he's the creator, but here he's
[17:29] making creation of already cooked fish
[17:32] and cooked bread.
[17:35] John might have said something like
[17:36] this. He said, "You know, when I was a
[17:38] little boy, we lived down by Jericho,
[17:42] and I remember my Jewish mother used to
[17:44] rock me to sleep in the afternoon, take
[17:46] my afternoon nap. I used to look up in
[17:49] her eyes and she'd tell me Bible
[17:51] stories."
[17:53] And you know, that's a good thing for
[17:54] any mother to do to her child.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; Bring up a child the way it should go.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[17:59] &gt;&gt; it'd be better turning on the
[18:00] television, watch uh some of these
[18:04] things that goes on on the television.
[18:06] be better off you reading my Bible story
[18:08] &gt;&gt; cuz it's impressing his little mind.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; Now Satie you she used to tell me about
[18:16] the a story of the Shunomite woman
[18:19] receiving her little boy back to life by
[18:22] the prophet Elijah. I like that. Then
[18:25] she used to tell me about our people
[18:27] coming up out of Egypt. was right on the
[18:29] Jordan River. And she'd point across
[18:32] river and say, "John, they camped just
[18:35] on the other side." And they were 40
[18:38] years in that wilderness. And God fed a
[18:42] man. Their clothes never wore out. And
[18:45] God gave them bread fresh every morning.
[18:48] And how my little childish heart I used
[18:51] to say, "Mama, has God got a lot of big
[18:54] ovens up there in the skies and he bakes
[18:57] all this bread and gets these angels
[18:58] ready that bring down the morning bread
[19:00] and lay out on the No, I should say,
[19:03] John, you're too young to understand.
[19:06] God doesn't have ovens in the sky. He
[19:08] don't need ovens. We have to have
[19:10] ovens." But God doesn't need it because
[19:12] he's a creator.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; See, he just speaks.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the bread laid out on that.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; He is the creator. And brethren, when I
[19:21] stood there today and watched him take
[19:24] that piece of bread AND TEAR IT OFF AND
[19:26] WHEN HE REACHED BACK FOR ANOTHER PIECE,
[19:28] IT WAS CREATED. I know we wasn't
[19:30] following following a false prophetise
[19:34] &gt;&gt; that was the creator himself
[19:37] &gt;&gt; in man. And uh then they might have
[19:40] discussed the attitude of some of the
[19:42] people. Some believed, some did not. And
[19:47] then his attitude towards the people.
[19:50] Now you know Christianity has changed so
[19:53] much in these last days.
[19:56] NOW YOU'VE got to baby a person. Promise
[19:58] them a whole lot. Give them a whole lot
[20:02] to make them believe, come to church,
[20:06] HAVE PROMISE THEM THAT THEY'LL have
[20:08] better associates AND EVERYTHING. THAT'S
[20:10] NOT CHRISTIANITY.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; CHRISTIANITY IS NOT BABYED. CHRISTIANITY
[20:14] IS RUGGED.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[20:16] RIGHT. It's a It's a Christianity is not
[20:20] a hotbed plant.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; A hot bed plant is a hybrid plant
[20:25] mostly. You have to spray it all the
[20:27] time. Keep the bugs off of it. That's
[20:30] because of its weakness.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; That's what you HAVE TO DO. A LOT OF
[20:33] CHRISTIANS KIND OF SPRAY THEM WITH A A
[20:35] LOT OF PROMISES.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; You you don't need it.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; A REAL GENUINE HEALTHY PLANT DON'T NEED
[20:43] any spraying. the bugs stay off of it.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; It's just like today that man trying to
[20:51] take things and pervert them. God in the
[20:55] beginning, he said, "Let every seed
[20:57] bring forth of its kind." I was reading
[20:59] in Reader Digest here where the they're
[21:02] taking what we call a hybrid corn and it
[21:05] makes a prettier ear. Sure, great big
[21:07] fine ear, but it is no good. Nothing to
[21:10] it. And they make a better tomato. don't
[21:13] even taste like a tomato. They make got
[21:16] a chicken now that don't even have
[21:17] wings.
[21:19] Hybriding.
[21:20] See, and now remember, you might have
[21:23] hybrid corn, but you can't plant that
[21:26] seed back. It won't produce again,
[21:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[21:28] &gt;&gt; It'll die.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; Why? It don't have no life in it. You
[21:32] have to hybrid it each time. If it
[21:34] wouldn't, it just keep on multiplying.
[21:36] That shows that evolution, according to
[21:38] man's ideas, is wrong. You can take a a
[21:42] mare horse and a jack and breed them
[21:44] together to get a mule. But a mule
[21:46] cannot breed itself back again. It's
[21:48] finished. That's all. He's finished. And
[21:52] they say now that in another 20 years,
[21:55] if they don't keep these people meeting
[21:57] this hybrid stuff like of corn and wheat
[22:02] and stuff that they're hybring, that is
[22:04] changing the the posture of women. that
[22:07] won't be able to have babies in 20 years
[22:09] from now. It's killing the generation,
[22:12] that hasn't got the STUFF IN IT, MAN'S
[22:14] NOT MADE LIKE THEY used to be. Look at
[22:16] man today. WHILE THERE USED TO BE BALL
[22:19] GAMES WAS ROUGH, NOW THEY HAVE TO WEAR
[22:21] HELMETS TO KILL A DOZEN EVERY YEAR. HIT
[22:23] HIM ON THE HEADS LIKE A GUINEA. He dies
[22:24] right now. FIGHTS AND EVERYTHING. MAN'S
[22:27] MADE UP OUT OF A BUNCH OF MUCK. IT'S IT
[22:29] IT'S BECAUSE OF HYBRID STUFF. IT HAS
[22:32] polluted the whole system of of our
[22:35] living, our whole economy. AND AND AND
[22:39] THAT HYBRID'S GOT INTO THE CHURCH, TOO.
[22:42] Instead of having a real RUGGED BUNCH OF
[22:44] BIBLE BELIEVERS, THEY'VE HYBRIDED BY
[22:46] DENOMINATIONS.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; And they have to say, "I GOT THIS, I GOT
[22:49] THAT,
[22:50] &gt;&gt; and I belong to THIS, AND I BELONG TO
[22:52] THAT." IT'S HYBRID.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; AND THE THING CAN'T PRODUCE ITSELF
[22:55] AGAIN. WE NEED A BOOK OF ACTS AGAIN. BUT
[22:58] THE ONLY WAY YOU'LL DO IT IS GET BACK TO
[23:00] THE BIBLE AND AWAY FROM SOME OF THIS
[23:02] HYBRID RELIGION,
[23:04] &gt;&gt; high breeding. Had to be babyed. No
[23:06] faith. Just a bunch of powder puffs.
[23:10] Just sensified baby into it. I'm I say
[23:13] you're a Christian. I'm Methodist. Are
[23:16] you a Christian? I'm Presbyterian. I'M
[23:17] PENTECOSTAL. THAT DON'T MEAN THAT TO
[23:19] GOD. YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN BECAUSE YOU'RE
[23:22] BORN IN THE SPIRIT OF Christ
[23:25] &gt;&gt; and the word of God lives in you.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; You know, uh always enjoy a hybrid
[23:32] horse. You know, he's got sense. You can
[23:36] you can teach him things, do things for
[23:39] him,
[23:40] &gt;&gt; and he'll learn. But you take an old
[23:42] mule, you can't do nothing to him. He's
[23:46] just a big old LONG-HAIRED DONKEY. HE
[23:49] SITS THERE AND YOU CAN TALK TO HIM. HE'S
[23:51] STICKING HIS EARS OUT and h see that
[23:54] HE'S JUST A HYBRID. PUTS IN MIND A LOT
[23:56] OF THESE SO-CALLED CHRISTIANS HYBRID
[23:58] DONKEY RELIGION. YOU TELL THEM JESUS
[24:01] CHRIST THE SAME YESTERDAY AND FOREVER. I
[24:03] don't believe it. See, SO YOU CAN'T
[24:05] NEVER TEACH him nothing. HE'S GONE
[24:07] ANYHOW. MY CHURCH BELIEVES IT THIS WAY.
[24:09] MY BELIEVES IT THAT WAY. BUT GOD'S WORD
[24:11] SAYS HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY AND TODAY
[24:13] AND FOREVER.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I like not a hybrid
[24:18] Christian. I like a like a pedigreed
[24:20] horse. He knows who his papa was, who
[24:23] his mama was, who his grandpa and
[24:24] grandma was. He knows all the
[24:26] generations all the WAY BACK. SO DOES A
[24:28] petty Christian. HE KNOWS WHO HIS FATHER
[24:31] IS. HE COME FROM GOD. HE'S THE WORD OF
[24:33] GOD. HE'S THE SAME AS HE EVER WAS. HE'S
[24:35] A REAL PETTY PRODUCT OF GOD. THE word of
[24:38] God is in him. Jesus Christ manifested
[24:41] himself.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; Bunch of unbelievers. Jesus wanted to
[24:45] shake off a bunch of parasites one day.
[24:47] He had too many following him. He had
[24:49] his disciples. Then he had the 70, the
[24:51] ministerial association. Then he had the
[24:53] congregation by the thousands. And then
[24:56] he made this statement. HE SAID, "EXCEPT
[24:58] you eat the blood, eat the flesh of the
[25:01] son of man and drink his blood, you have
[25:03] no life in you."
[25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; Now, what do you think a medical doctor
[25:05] would say sitting out in the
[25:06] congregation? What do you think a
[25:08] sensible thinking man would? What we
[25:10] call sensible thinking? He never
[25:12] explained it. He didn't have to explain
[25:14] it.
[25:16] While the doctor said, "Get away from
[25:18] that fell. He's crazy. He We'll be human
[25:20] vampires drinking the blood of a man,
[25:22] feeding his flesh." And the
[25:24] congregation, I imagine the priest said,
[25:27] "This is the time. Here's where we come
[25:28] in." Out we go. We'll never attend
[25:30] another one of the meetings. Away they
[25:32] went. Then he got all them away from
[25:34] him. Then he turned around and he said
[25:36] to the 70, HE SAID, "WHAT WILL YOU say
[25:38] when you see the Son of Man ascending up
[25:40] into heaven? From whence's he comes
[25:46] said the son of man ascending up from
[25:48] whence he come while he's had us at the
[25:50] very manger where he was born. We know
[25:53] his mother. We seen the clothes the
[25:55] swallowing cloth he was wrapped in. He
[25:57] was born down there in Bethlehem of
[25:58] Judea. He was brought up over HERE IN
[26:00] NAZARETH. THERE'S HIS BROTHERS, his
[26:01] sisters, and all of them with us. And
[26:03] then he said, "THIS SON OF MAN HAS SENT
[26:05] IT UP." HE DIDN'T EXPLAIN IT.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; He just said it.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, THEY COULDN'T EXPLAIN IT. THEY
[26:12] COULDN'T FIX IT out in their mind. Well,
[26:14] they said, "Yours where we come in." So,
[26:15] they went out. That's as much as they
[26:17] COULD STAND. THEY STILL HAD THE SAME
[26:19] GROUPS.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. We still have them. We
[26:22] notice then he turned. REMEMBER THOSE
[26:24] DISCIPLES COULDN'T explain that either,
[26:27] &gt;&gt; but they had faith.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus turned and looked to the 12
[26:31] and said, "Would you go also?" Then
[26:33] Peter made those notable words, "Lord,
[26:36] where would we go? For we are fully
[26:38] persuaded. We know that you have the
[26:41] word of life and you don't think they
[26:44] couldn't explain how he's going to eat
[26:45] his flesh and drink his blood. They
[26:47] couldn't understand how he's going to
[26:48] send up where he come down from when he
[26:50] was born in Bethlehem. THEY COULD BUT
[26:52] SEE FAITH DON'T KNOW NO FAILURE. It's
[26:55] anchored. It stays there. NO MATTER WHAT
[26:57] ANYTHING SAID,
[26:58] &gt;&gt; it stayed there. They were ordained to
[27:01] this life and he's they stayed there.
[27:03] Now those different kinds, some
[27:05] believed, some said a man never spoke
[27:07] like this. Some didn't believe and they
[27:09] said, "Well, that might disgust that."
[27:13] Some said, "A man never spoke like this
[27:14] man." There's something strange about
[27:16] him. WHAT HE SAYS, he's able to back up.
[27:19] Well, they did say that she said he
[27:21] don't talk like a priest. He doesn't
[27:23] talk like a rabbi.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; For what he says, God backs it up.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; He vindicates what he said.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; Oh my. It must have been young John then
[27:33] said, "Think of it. We have him with us
[27:36] right now."
[27:37] What a comfort that must be. WHAT A
[27:40] SECURITY.
[27:41] WHAT A SECURITY IT OUGHT TO BE TO US.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; YES,
[27:44] &gt;&gt; I'm a missionary
[27:46] round and around the world. And I've
[27:49] seen all kinds of religions and all
[27:50] kinds of gods that they have. the
[27:52] heathen gods, the Mohamad, the Buddha,
[27:56] and seek Jane or whatever more and the
[28:00] heathen gods, the tribesmen.
[28:03] But every one of them, there's none of
[28:05] them, right? But Christianity, every one
[28:09] of them, their founders are dead and
[28:11] they got the grave where HE WAS BURIED.
[28:14] BUT CHRISTIANITY IS THE ONLY ONES,
[28:15] RIGHT? BECAUSE OUR FOUNDER DIED, BURIED,
[28:18] but rose again. AND WE CAN PROVE THAT
[28:22] HE'S ALIVE.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; At the grave of Muhammad for the past
[28:26] 2,000 years nearly been a white horse
[28:30] change guards ever so many hours waiting
[28:32] for Muhammad to rise up the dead and
[28:35] ride down the world and conquer it. BUT
[28:38] JESUS IS ALREADY UP FROM THE DEAD.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; BEEN UP FOR 2,000 YEARS AND IT'S WITH US
[28:43] TONIGHT. YES.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; And then when we see the darkness and
[28:48] see the end of time way it is now coming
[28:50] up to the hours that we're living
[28:53] &gt;&gt; while we're sailing life solemn
[28:56] WHERE THE STORMY SEAS AND AND THE VESSEL
[28:59] CAN WRECK AT ANY TIME. THESE LITTLE
[29:01] LIGHTS CAN SNAP OUT LIKE THAT
[29:03] &gt;&gt; or we might never leave this building
[29:05] tonight.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; None of us.
[29:08] WE DON'T KNOW WHAT time deaths are
[29:10] coming and what
[29:13] to THEIPLES TO KNOW THAT THE VERY
[29:16] creator that had thoroughly identified
[29:19] himself to be that person WAS SAILING
[29:21] WITH THEM.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT A BLESSED
[29:25] THOUGHT IT IS. WHAT A BLESSED HOPE IT
[29:28] IS. WHAT AN ASSURANCE IT IS.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; AND THIS DARK HOUR AT THE END OF WORLD'S
[29:33] HISTORY TO KNOW THE CREATOR IS SAILING
[29:36] LIKE SALOMINE WITH US.
[29:38] safely tucked in.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Arms, whatever may come, let them ride,
[29:43] burst, blow, whatever they want to, it
[29:45] makes no difference to me.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; I'm sailing with the creator.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; What a security while sailing these
[29:51] waters.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Now, while speaking, talking of him
[29:56] about what great things he' done at the
[29:59] revival, feasting, Jesus was probably
[30:01] resting like he is. I said between the
[30:03] revivals
[30:05] and we they had been so clearly
[30:07] identified to who he was. The people
[30:10] knew who he was of those who was BLINDED
[30:14] BUT THOSE WHO HAD A HOLD on the
[30:15] scripture because they know that the
[30:19] scripture
[30:21] God's word has been given a lot to each
[30:24] generation. AND THAT PROMISE OF THAT AGE
[30:28] HAS to be fulfilled. AND HE FULFILLED
[30:31] EXACTLY WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE done in
[30:33] the time of the Messiah. He met every
[30:36] qualification.
[30:39] Then we he was assured that he was the
[30:43] man.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; But you see, HE WAS SO COMMON. He didn't
[30:47] dress like a priest.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; He had no not an education as as what
[30:53] we'd call education. We had no record of
[30:56] him even going to school.
[30:59] BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIM THAT
[31:02] WAS DIFFERENT. And then he invited them
[31:05] when they couldn't understand said,
[31:06] "Search the scriptures for in them you
[31:09] think you have eternal life." And that's
[31:12] the thing that testifies of me.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; They tell you who I am.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; And I remember that all had this in
[31:20] their heart and was thinking of these
[31:22] things. And while sailing around on the
[31:25] sea, how they could be like children as
[31:27] long as he was in the ship with them.
[31:31] NOW FRIEND, WHAT THAT ought to do to us.
[31:34] THE SAME IDENTIFIED JESUS CHRIST, the
[31:38] same creator, THE SAME GOD IS WITH US
[31:43] TONIGHT.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; WHAT A SECURE IT IS. WHAT A FEELING to
[31:48] know that his presence is here. Yes.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Now
[31:52] &gt;&gt; we find right when they having this
[31:54] great time all of a sudden trouble
[31:58] arose.
[31:59] The ship rock the sails blew off. The
[32:02] water filled the boat. All hopes of
[32:05] survival was gone.
[32:08] Now isn't it strange? Just like it is
[32:10] now as we're coming down to the end now.
[32:14] Isn't it strange? We can talk about how
[32:16] great he is. We can tell how great he is
[32:19] in our church when we testify. We tell
[32:21] the our our employees employers how
[32:25] great he is. We tell the people on the
[32:27] street how great it is. AND WHEN TROUBLE
[32:29] STRIKES, WE ARE FRUSTRATED.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; We just the things that we've seen him
[32:36] do, the things that we know he does, and
[32:38] just let a little sickness or a little
[32:40] trouble strike the home. Watch what
[32:41] happens.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; All gone to pieces. All All hopes are
[32:45] gone. Though they had seen him do so
[32:46] many things, all forgotten when trouble
[32:49] strikes.
[32:51] Like now we have seen this great
[32:53] revival. We have history of other great
[32:56] revivals. We have his presence. We know
[32:59] these things. And sometimes trouble sets
[33:02] in that we can't remedy.
[33:06] They u
[33:08] for instance like now we have trouble in
[33:10] our churches. Now we have denominational
[33:13] troubles, arguments in our churches. We
[33:15] don't know what's going to take place.
[33:17] We see a great thing forming up there.
[33:20] All of us believers in the Bible see
[33:22] something's fixing to take place.
[33:23] There's nobody what knows that. And all
[33:26] the churches are going to be brought
[33:27] into that ecumenical council of
[33:30] churches.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; And when you do that, you're going to
[33:32] forfeit your great evangelical teaching
[33:34] of the Bible.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Pentecostals are
[33:37] sympathizing with it, going right into
[33:38] it like a hog going to its slaughter,
[33:41] &gt;&gt; right? Ecumenical council, many great
[33:44] Pentecostal leaders agreeing with them.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, don't you never stick
[33:49] your neck in a thing like that.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what the Bible said would
[33:52] come to pass. There's the beast in the
[33:54] market perfectly. Everything's set right
[33:56] in order. And we see this and we wonder
[33:58] what's going to be the outcome of it.
[34:00] trouble set in
[34:05] and they forgot
[34:07] that the very one that they were talking
[34:09] about, the very creator was in the boat
[34:11] with them. NOW, YOU SAY, "IF I COULD
[34:13] THINK THAT, WELL, REMEMBER, we still
[34:16] have him because he's the word always."
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; And John 1:1, as we spoke last night, he
[34:21] was the word and the word was made flesh
[34:23] and dwelt among us. And we still have
[34:26] his word that directs us to his thoughts
[34:28] and his doings for this day.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; See the not the thoughts Moses had in
[34:35] his day, not the thoughts of disciples,
[34:37] not the thoughts of Luther or Wesley or
[34:39] the Pentecostal age or any of those. We
[34:42] have the Bible here that tells us of
[34:44] what's going to happen now.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; See, we see the Pentecostal revival in
[34:50] the Bible, the Lutheran and all those
[34:51] church ages. We saw them. But we also
[34:54] HAVE THE SCRIPTURE HERE TELLING US WHAT
[34:56] IT'S GOING TO BE NOW. And that's God.
[35:00] God interpreting his own word for this
[35:04] age that we're living in.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; He's his own interpreter.
[35:09] And yet we get frustrated. Paul be
[35:12] frustrated. His disciples sometimes get
[35:15] physical troubles that they can't remedy
[35:17] such as sickness, cancer.
