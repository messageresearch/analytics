TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Good morning. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand and have a word of prayer. Dear gracious father, Lord, we want to come before you this morning, Lord. invite you into our Sunday school, Lord, that we could learn something, Father, that your word says to the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. So, Father, we want to begin with our pursuit for knowledge and understanding of your word by recognizing your authority. Father, we want to ask that you would come down, reveal yourself to us, open the word to us, Father, but above all, that you would anoint our hearts that we could hear it and receive it. that Father, it wouldn't just be Lord a a a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol, but Lord that it would move and it would act that the hearing of the word would would quicken life within us. We ask these things, ask this blessing upon the word as we before we would read it in the holy and precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. We want to turn um this morning to Genesis chapter 2. Um, and we'll go to verse 21. Um, Genesis chapter 2 and verse 21. And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept. And he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof. And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man. And Adam said, "This is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called woman because she was taken out of man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh." And they they were both naked, and the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. Y'all can be seated. Um, I want to also turn, well, I'll just read it here. We don't just for the sake of time. Um, I'll just read it from my notes. This is Romans 13 and verse 8 through 10. Says, "Owe no man anything but to love one another. For he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. For this, thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness. Thou shalt not covet. And if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Love workketh no ill to his neighbor. Therefore, love is the fulfilling of the law. Um, now I want to uh I want to continue on with my thought that I've been um speaking on um the title, why are we here? um speaking on primarily on on the family and and and how the family is to be structured and the purpose of it. Um and so I want to last week we had we had um I talked mentioned I'd ended with the point that in Genesis chapter 2 um that the in Genesis the pattern of the family right the type that the modern family is supposed to follow is the type is the pattern after the uh family in the garden of Eden that the the Lord had a ideal for a family and that it is our goal as message people to return back to that that we would organize our families and structure it in that way and that in fact is God's great purpose that in fact the purpose of the the Bible and the scripture and everything the whole everything was that God could have a family that God could be a father he could be a husband and that he could have children in you know in his perfect ideal for a home which was the Eden condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, and so it is our job, it is our goal to pattern everything that we are, all of our family and the way we we do things after that ideal, after that perfect image. And so um and I I read this this uh here in in Genesis chapter 2 um that that last verse verse 24. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh. Now I want to note again just to reiterate that here it is the the you have the narrator of the Bible telling a story right? He's telling the story of how, you know, God made Eve out of Adam. And then he gets to verse 24 and then the narrator stops and breaks the fourth wall and talks directly to the reader and says, "This is why we just heard this story." &gt;&gt; Right? Therefore, shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh. This is an important point. This isn't just something that we can pass over, but that it would indicate the process of building a marriage. If we're going to start, if we're going to build families, if we're going to build the, you know, the foundation of the family is the marriage and the foundation of the marriage is the man, right? Because God started there. God started with a man and then added the woman to the man. And if you get that out of order, you get that out of order, you're going to end up with all kinds of problems, &gt;&gt; right? That it is it because the man is the head of the home, right? That, you know, we'll we'll get there at some point. I don't know if we'll get there today, but you know that particular scripture um you know talking about that uh the husband is the head of the wife Jesus Christ is the head of the church right and husbands love your wives even as Christ loved the church. So there's a there's a a calling for the men to behave as Christ would behave and that that's the foundation. Everything's built on the man and his relationship with God. Right? Um, so there's two co key concepts that I want to kind of keep forefront in our mind in dealing with any of this. And the first is that if the natural types the spiritual, then the spiritual predicts and determines the natural, right? English when if the natural type's a spiritual then what's going on spiritually is simply a predictor of what's going to happen naturally. &gt;&gt; Right? If in the garden of Eden when Adam left the garden or left the uh Adam fell and God's going through the garden saying, "Adam, Adam, where art thou?" God is not asking, "What bush is Adam hiding behind?" Right? He's asking, "Adam, where's your heart? Your heart's left the garden. Your heart's not with me anymore. Where did you go spiritually?" And what happens and we see this with with in a marriage before a marriage goes bust or when children rebel against their parents the hearts leave the family first right it is always the heart that leaves first and but and it's and it's a predictor right the the the the when the heart leaves that's when the person the heart always leaves before the person physically leaves. Yeah, &gt;&gt; right. Adam had to leave the garden because spiritually he had already left the garden. His heart had already been gone before he had to leave the garden. Right? So what happens spiritually is the is the determinator for what will happen physically. And then kind of key to this is that a marriage does not start at an altar. It starts when a young man gets the Holy Ghost and moves out of his father's home. Okay? There is it is important that a young man leave his father and mother before he goes and seeks a wife. Right? That's scriptural. That's and and I'll I'll uh let me um come down to my other other scriptures here. So in John 14, in my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare uh and if I go and prepare a place, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there may ye be also. And whether I go uh whether I go, you know, and the way you know. So here's Christ. Christ does not have an invisible union with a bride until he goes and prepares a place for her. Okay? young men who want to go take a wife to, you know, and have have a marriage, it is your responsibility to be able to provide for her and have a home outside of your dad's spare bedroom. Okay? That's not preparing a place, right? And I can already hear someone go, "Well, actually, it says in my father's house." Well, okay. Okay. You might have an argument if I were a trinitarian, but I am not. The the fact of the matter is it is Christ going to prepare a place for his bride before he goes 2,000 years later to to have an invisible union. This is a pattern that we are to follow. Okay? It is important that a if a young man cannot prepare a home and provide a home to that girl, he's not fit to marry her. Period. Okay? That is that is that's not um it's not just good advice. Okay? It is good advice, but it's not just good advice, right? It is it is actually vital that a that a man is able to provide for his family. It is it is key. It is integral. It is not like I said before, the family is not just a a nice benefit to the message of the hour. It is core to the message of the hour. Okay? The same thing with your finances and your ability to provide for your wife and your family as a man. It is not just a side note. It's core and it's integral. Okay. Um I'll I'll read this. This is 1 Timothy chapter 5. But if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel. Okay. that any man who can who who is not providing for his family and and I will just make a note here and and again at some point I will well I I think I I I let's just do it now um the that provide there to provide for your family that's not just finances okay remember the natural types the spiritual if you are failing to provide for your family financially it's a pretty safe odds that you are not providing for your family spiritually either. Okay, you it is it is incumbent upon every man. You will be it's not just something that's going to make your life easy. It's something that you will answer to God for on the day of judgment. If you fail to provide for your family both physically and spiritually if you do not put food on the table and a roof over their head, but also when they have spiritual needs, it is your job to handle that. is your job to be the provider spiritually and to lead them and guide them into things that they have need of when they have questions, when they have concerns, when when your when your children need need direction and guidance, you have to be there. Not just that, but man, and and man, I wow, time goes and I don't really have time to get into this too much, but listen, children, I'll just say this. There was a um this isn't in my notes so I'm going to kind of go off road here for a minute. Um there was I believe in the late 1800s early 1900s I might have the dates a little bit wrong but the story is is the same. Back in the day um there was a orphanage it was commonly known that u when a mother died early on like in childbearing or something like that and there was no nobody to take care of the baby. babies would go to an orphanage and it was commonly known that babies in an orphanage would die. They did not live. They they would live maybe a couple of months and um nobody knew exactly why because it wasn't that they weren't being fed. It wasn't that they weren't being, you know, clothed and and washed and things like that. It's just they had an incredibly high mortality rate. Virtually no babies made it to to adulthood if they were raised in an orphanage. And uh there was no immediately apparent reason why their physical needs were being taken care of, but they would just die. And nobody knew why. And so a doctor found out one day that there was an orphanage in Germany in that did not have a near 100% mortality rate for infants. And this was a huge revelation. He's like, "We got to go. I got to go get down there immediately. We got to figure out what's going on. Why are these babies not dying?" Because this is everybody knows it around the world. Everybody knows babies just die. And so he gets there and the only difference the only difference between this orphanage and all the other orphanages was that the the lady who ran the orphanage made it a point every single day made it a point to pick up and hold and love on every single one of those babies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every single one of them. She made a point even if it was a few minutes, a few hours, whatever it was, she made she didn't go anywhere without a baby on her hip because she had to make sure she had time in her day for every single baby under her care because they all need to be held and shown affection. &gt;&gt; All of them. And what and so many times and we there's man I I get into there's a lot of scientific literature on this. Babies need affection. And it doesn't just stop when they're babies. Your children need the affection of their parents. They need time. They need personal time. You need to build a relationship with them. You do not get to let them grow up to teenagers. And then when their heart left the home, if you neglected their heart for the first 13 years of their life, you don't get to scratch your head and wonder what happened. &gt;&gt; Okay? You have you have a certain you have until they are teenagers to build a heart connection with them. Okay? Their heart will leave just like Adam's left. And when Adam's heart left, so did Adam. And when your children's heart leaves your home, they will leave right behind it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. You You have an obligation. You have an obligation as a parent to to woo your children the way God woos his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To build a connection. Fight for their for their heart. &gt;&gt; Fight to to have a love connection there because I you know you because ah I'm I'm I'll I'll get tongue tied and and shut down on this and I I just don't have time to to get into it. I will get here at some point. I promise. But just just bear that in mind. You have an obligation to to fail to build that connection with your children is to deny the faith and be worse than an infidel. &gt;&gt; Okay? It is important that you do that because it is the only thing. You are the first version of God that they will ever see. &gt;&gt; You're the first version of God. And if you if if dad cannot set his golf clubs down long enough to spend time with his kids, then he is not being Christ to those kids. Christ set aside heaven and earth. He set aside the throne of glory to tell his children that he loved them. And if and if you know, I'm I'm sorry, but if your fishing pole has to collect some dust so that you can spend some time with your kids, so be it. &gt;&gt; Okay? You've got to do that. It is it is your obligation. It's what you signed up for when you had kids. &gt;&gt; And I'll I'll uh I'll I'll just make one one final point because I am I am rapidly running out of time. One final point just sort of hitting that point about the natural um sort of natural provision. Um it is especially in this day and age and I know it's in this economy things are the way that they are. And I but I I just want to I want to read this. This is something I read. Um this is from and knoweth it not. Um he says um uh just watch, stay close to Christ. Let me warn you now as a minister of the gospel. Don't take any foolishness. Don't imagine anything. Stay right there until this inside of the inside is anchored to the word that you're right in Christ because that's the only thing that's um going to because we're in the most deceiving age that we ever lived in. It would deceive the very elected if it was possible because they have anointing. They can um they can do anything like the rest of them. Clean your lives up, pay your debts, owe no man. Jesus said, um uh let's see now. I don't mean things like your house rent and stuff. You got to do it. Get all your things off your hands. Get everything right. Make ready. Get ready. remember in the name of the Lord something's fixing to happen. So he said that on uh August the 15th and then August the 22nd. So this is one week later he actually gives some commentary on what he just said. Um uh I said um now someone uh someone asked should we buy a car? Um, now that isn't what Jesus spoke of or the Bible there, um, that said, "Oweow no man nothing." That's lingering debts that you could pay, pay them. That's owing no man nothing. It doesn't mean we owe our rent or our telephone bill and what more. We owe those things and we pay them. But an old lingering debt that you could be paying on, pay it off. See, don't go with anything hanging on you like that. &gt;&gt; Okay? You speak going to going to to the other side. Don't pass on. Don't try to face the rapture if you have a bunch of lingering debt. He said, and this is the same same sermon, but I'm going to skip a paragraph because uh just for the sake of time. He says, "Oh, some Christian here at the church one time went out and got some work done on a car here. Um and the man came down. The man said, "I'll pay you. I'll get I get paid Saturday or something another." And he never paid him. And weeks after weeks rolled by and never paid him, never said a word. And the man come and ask me, see, it reflects against the church. &gt;&gt; It reflects against Christ. &gt;&gt; If you can't pay him, go tell him. Say, I owe you and I'm going to pay you. I'm a Christian, but I just can't do it right now. I owe this. And you remember it's on God's books, too. You know that you do. Right? When you owe someone money, it's on God's books, too. Don't h It's in It's in the Bible. It's in the message of the hour. Christians oughtn't be racking up 30 $40,000 in credit card debt of just consumer debt because they wanted to go on vacation to Disneyland. &gt;&gt; Okay? You oughtn't do that. You You owe that, &gt;&gt; right? That's going to that's going to be you're going to have to answer for that one day. if you're just racking up debt and then and that you can't pay back right now. Again, we understand there's difference between, you know, rent, your mortgage, your car payment, medical bills, something like that. That's different. That's not the same thing. But if you're just smoking your credit card because you got to have the latest, greatest toys, that's wrong. &gt;&gt; Okay? The Bible says it's wrong. And I'll I'll end with this because I I got two minutes left. Um I just I'll just read three bullet points that I have here in my notes. It says when we say that we are Christian husbands that means something more than that we are husbands who also go to church. It is a public declar de declaration that we are leading our homes in the way Christ would lead our homes. Number two if the natural types of spiritual then the spiritual determines the natural. If the heavenly groom has made an invisible union with their earthly bride, then our marriages should reflect and demonstrate what that looks like made flesh. We are the invisible union made flesh. Allegedly, right? Allegedly, we are the word made flesh in this day. Well, what's the word made flesh in our day? Christ has come down. There's an invisible union. We're going to a marriage supper. They're supposed How are we supposed to be the fulfillment of that if our marriages are completely contrary to the word of God? If our families are completely in disarray and and I'll I'll finish with this. It says uh we say preach the gospel with all your hearts and when all else fails use words. So when our families are not a reflection of the heavenly family, then we are preaching an antichrist message to the world through our lifestyle. That's hard, &gt;&gt; but it's true, right? When your family is in chaos, when you are not living according to the word, when you are not taking on the role of the in the family that God has laid upon you in the word of God, right? When husbands do not honor their wives, do not love their wives the way Christ would love the church. When the when the wives do not honor their husbands and do not follow their husbands in the way that the the church follows after Christ. When children are not obedient to their parents and are just going every which way and they're they're completely rejecting the instruction of their parents and not following their parents, then what that is it's it's just natural typing the spiritual folks. It's all it is. The natural is determined by the spiritual. And if your spirit, if our hearts are not connected, that's why I read that that quote, if you'll remember from the message oneness where brother Brandham said, anything that disrupts the unity of the family is not of God, right? There has to be a heart connection because that's how we reflect God's relation to his church. We have a heart connection with God. We have a heart connection to our brothers and sisters. And bear in mind a church is simply a collection of families. The things the the the things that that afflict us in our family dynamics will unfold on the church level. If every church family in the church is disrupted and broken and there's disunityity, then there will be disunityity in the b in the church body itself because it's just going to roll up the chain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? You can't if you don't have unity in your own family, then you can't have unity with your brothers and sisters in Christ either. It will it that's where it's going to go, right? Natural is determined by the spiritual. And and you know, it'll just keep moving up the up the line. And and it's not a again, it is not for nothing that on the in the in Acts chapter 2 that they were in one mind and one accord. They they had a heart connection in the church and that's what brought the move of the spirit amongst them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. And if we do not have connection, if we do not have we're not operating in love and that's part of the reason why I read that scripture in in in Romans 13 that all the law can be summed up in love your neighbor as yourself. All of it. You have to have unity and that you're operating in love one towards another. If you don't, then you will not have the Lord moving in your church. Okay. At the end of the day, that's where all this is leading. But it starts it starts at your own home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It starts in your own family that you start there and build get actual true divine love. And that doesn't man well anyways. I'm out of time. I'm going to I'm going to quit. I'll just finish that and say finish that thought and say you have to have divine love in your own family. And that doesn't just mean that, you know, we just um anything goes and and we just want to have gentle parenting and um you know, we don't want to be invasive in our children's lives. And no, true love means that you'll bring correction if it's if it's needed. True love means that husbands and wives can have conflict. You can have an argument with your wife, but you'll do it in a way that's that's subject to the Holy Spirit. You can have conf I mean, every marriage is going to have have conflict. They all do. they have to, you know, it's called an engagement for a reason, right? Um, but look, they're all going to have conflict, but but there's a pathway to do that subject to the word of God and to do it properly under under the the the anointing of of of um of divine love. So, we'll pull the brakes there before I end up in the song service. We'll have a word of prayer. Father, Lord, we come before you this morning. We ask that you would that you would take these broken words, this these stammering lips, Father, and that you would maybe take the things that were said today and Lord, that someone could hold on to it. Give them strength by it, Lord, that you could take it and you would know how to place those words in the hearts of the people that it would bring it would bring life and it would bring encouragement. We thank you, Father, for all that you do for us. Thank you for the anointing that you bring. Ask that you'd be with us through the remaining of the service, through the the worship service, and into the ministering of the word. We ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
