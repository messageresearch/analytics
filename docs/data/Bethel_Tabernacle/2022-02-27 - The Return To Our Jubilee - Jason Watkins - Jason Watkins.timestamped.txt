[25:36] a pretty easy to book a book to find
[25:38] right in the beginning of your
[25:40] bible
[25:44] amen all my old sunday school students
[25:46] remember janice's exodus leviticus
[25:50] we learned it as a song
[25:53] amen

[26:12] and that you'll pray for me if i
[26:14] cough and hack oh well we'll blow it out
[26:16] and it'll be fine
[26:17] amen the return
[26:19] to our jubilee
[26:22] this is what i want to speak on today
[26:24] the return
[26:26] to our jubilee brother branham
[26:29] took
[26:30] three different sermons
[26:32] uh concerning the jubilee
[26:34] and one of the last ones that he took
[26:37] was return and
[26:40] jubilee
[26:41] because
[26:42] you know the the what the what the world
[26:45] has failed to understand is
[26:48] is the jubilee god kept his promise
[26:51] to the early church he offered that
[26:53] jubilee to israel and they declined it
[26:56] and they crucified the lord of glory the
[26:58] one who brought him the jubilee it's
[27:00] everything they had waited on you know
[27:01] for thousands of years and at the finish
[27:04] line they fell apart that's a sad sad
[27:07] reality but it worked into the plan of
[27:10] god to allow the gentiles to come in
[27:12] which god foresaw that and warned them
[27:13] it would happen in the old testament he
[27:15] talked about that he would bring up a
[27:17] people he'd make israel jealous because
[27:20] he'd call a people that were not
[27:21] formerly his people and that be the
[27:23] gentile heathens
[27:24] so
[27:26] we realized that they declined it and
[27:28] god poured it out upon the new testament
[27:31] church in the upper room
[27:33] amen and of course we know by the
[27:35] teaching of the scripture
[27:37] that um that that first church age just
[27:40] like israel they backslid committed
[27:42] adultery on christ and
[27:44] instead of christ being able to come
[27:46] back and take that bride home in a
[27:49] rapture he had to sit back down in the
[27:51] eternities intercede for 2000 years seal
[27:54] the word up under seven seals make it
[27:57] mysterious so just like he did in the
[27:59] garden of eden when he guarded the way
[28:00] to the tree of life wasn't guarding a
[28:02] path or a trail it was guarding the
[28:04] revelation of christ because the people
[28:06] were fallen and he couldn't let them
[28:08] partake of that tree of life in a
[28:10] falling condition because then they
[28:11] would live forever in a fallen condition
[28:13] so there's no way to do that so he he
[28:16] guards the way to the tree of life with
[28:18] the cherub and with flaming sword and of
[28:21] course that was the spirit of christ
[28:22] those cherubs that's what they were
[28:25] and so uh just backgrounding before we
[28:27] get going and then of course jesus
[28:31] was still using that exact same flaming
[28:33] sword in his day and he would say things
[28:35] like except you eat the flesh of the son
[28:37] of man drink his blood you have no life
[28:40] in you what was he doing guarding the
[28:41] way they couldn't take that it blew
[28:43] their mind they walked away said this is
[28:45] hard saying we can't follow this exactly
[28:48] and and you know he would he would say
[28:50] things like you know you see the son of
[28:52] man standing here but the son of man is
[28:54] in heaven and they couldn't put all that
[28:55] together and you know he would he would
[28:57] say why can you not understand my speech
[28:59] and my words why are they foreign to you
[29:01] it's because you're of your father the
[29:02] devil and so he's guarding the ways
[29:05] guarding the way because the only one
[29:07] that can give you access to the tree of
[29:09] life is the spirit of christ
[29:11] aren't you glad for that you should be
[29:13] glad it's protected
[29:15] it's protected see because that means
[29:17] that when you get to heaven it's going
[29:19] to be a perfect place
[29:21] because nobody else can get there
[29:23] without that revelation and there's no
[29:25] way to get that revelation unless he
[29:26] reveals it to you amen so it is a
[29:29] protected and it is a deeply guarded
[29:32] secret the revelation of the mystery of
[29:35] god
[29:36] and so we're look gonna so so when we
[29:39] find out then that that that the power
[29:42] under that jubilee and all the access
[29:44] that that jubilee was to give the church
[29:46] and lead them to a body change never
[29:48] happened in that first stage see that
[29:50] alpha h fell away but he promised at the
[29:53] end time in the omega he would restore
[29:55] the jubilee he would bring us back to
[29:58] the faith
[29:59] of the fathers amen which was the
[30:03] jubilee which was the abstract title
[30:05] deed remember the book of life that adam
[30:08] lost control of
[30:10] satan grabbed a hold of it
[30:12] but it vanished from him and it appeared
[30:14] again in heaven because brother and said
[30:15] his filthy hands couldn't hold it
[30:17] oh we're going somewhere today friends i
[30:19] hope you all are buckled up praise the
[30:21] lord i'm preaching ahead of reading my
[30:23] text but i wanted to just background you
[30:25] a little bit before we get going so you
[30:27] don't get lost in the shuffle amen
[30:29] leviticus 25 38-42
[30:34] amen
[30:36] i am the lord your god which brought you
[30:39] forth out of the land of egypt to give
[30:42] you the land of canaan
[30:44] and to be your god not wonderful that
[30:47] was his whole purpose
[30:49] and if thy brother
[30:51] that dwelleth by thee be wax and poor
[30:54] and be sold unto thee thou shalt not
[30:57] compel him to serve as a bondservant
[31:01] but as a hired servant and as a
[31:04] sojourner he shall be with thee and
[31:07] shall serve thee unto the year of
[31:09] jubilee
[31:11] and then shall he depart from thee both
[31:13] he and his children with him above that
[31:16] and shall return unto his own family and
[31:19] unto the possession of his fathers
[31:22] shall he return that's a promise for us
[31:24] friends we're headed back to the
[31:26] possession of our early fathers
[31:29] and our children with us
[31:30] amen hallelujah
[31:33] for they are my servants which i brought
[31:37] forth out of the land of egypt they
[31:40] shall not be sold as bondmen
[31:44] father we thank you for your word today
[31:48] and i'm praying that you'll be with me
[31:51] lord and this enemy trying with these
[31:54] lying symptoms but lord i've i've
[31:56] decided today
[31:58] that the prophet taught me that
[32:00] if i've got a situation or a problem
[32:02] just find me a bible character that had
[32:04] the same situation
[32:06] directly or indirectly and just do what
[32:08] he did and you'll come out the same way
[32:10] at the same deliverance and so when i
[32:12] look back at jonah
[32:14] and and i'm glad to pick jonah because
[32:17] nobody had worse circumstances than
[32:19] jonah and lord of jonah could come out
[32:21] of it then surely i can come out of this
[32:23] and jonah made a decision he actually
[32:26] decided he said and thought about it and
[32:29] he proactively decided to call the
[32:32] symptoms of the lie
[32:35] and he called the promise true
[32:38] he oh and he said the promise was the
[32:40] reality i'll look again toward jerusalem
[32:43] and i'll pray because he promised me
[32:45] that if i did that he would hear and he
[32:47] literally took the symptoms that were
[32:50] tangible and real and he made a
[32:51] proactive decision to call them the lie
[32:54] and decided to call the word the truth
[32:57] and believe it and it brought him out so
[32:59] today lord i'm calling these symptoms
[33:01] the lie and i'm calling your promise
[33:04] that by your wounds i'm healed by your
[33:06] stripes lord i am made well and so i
[33:10] commit it now to you
[33:12] i ask you to take over lord this vessel
[33:14] and use it unworthy as it is but i stand
[33:17] under the bloodstained banner today
[33:20] lord the blood's speaking for us thanks
[33:22] be to god we commit ourselves into your
[33:24] hands for service now
[33:26] in jesus name amen god bless you friends
[33:29] you can be seated
[33:53] so
[33:54] leviticus is a wonderful promise that
[33:59] details the difference and it makes a
[34:01] sharp
[34:02] difference between
[34:05] a bond servant and a hired servant
[34:08] and we find that
[34:10] the reason that god would not allow god
[34:13] is making a difference between his
[34:16] family
[34:17] and every other human being in the earth
[34:21] and he's not embarrassed about that he
[34:24] doesn't he's not shy about that he's not
[34:27] uh you know he's not worried that that's
[34:30] politically incorrect he doesn't care uh
[34:33] what the rest of the world thinks he
[34:36] makes a difference between his family
[34:39] and everyone else in the world
[34:42] and he says now if it's somebody who's
[34:44] not a member of my family you're welcome
[34:46] to make them a bond servant but you
[34:48] can't make my family that they have to
[34:51] be a hired servant in other words they
[34:54] they're not just going to be out they're
[34:55] not going to be your bond servant you
[34:57] know just working off a debt they're
[34:59] actually hired by you they're still a
[35:01] israelite they're still your brother and
[35:04] you're actually helping them get through
[35:06] a rough time and as soon as the jubilee
[35:09] comes the dead is settled and they go
[35:11] free with their kids and all their
[35:12] possessions because they're they're
[35:15] still the person i purchased and brought
[35:17] out of egypt
[35:19] and it doesn't matter today that we have
[35:21] come in a fallen condition we're still
[35:22] children of god it doesn't matter that i
[35:25] came born the wrong way and i needed a
[35:27] savior i'm still a son of god it doesn't
[35:29] matter that i found myself poor
[35:31] sometimes spiritually and i make
[35:33] mistakes and you make mistakes but i'm
[35:34] still a son of god
[35:36] and and god is commanding the enemy my
[35:39] children are different yes they're born
[35:41] in sin yes they're trapped in a body yes
[35:44] the
[35:45] the demon powers are all over the earth
[35:47] but they're still my children who i
[35:49] bought
[35:50] and no amount of no amount of of reality
[35:54] that they live in now temporarily in
[35:57] this earth and and and they wouldn't be
[35:59] here
[36:00] they'd rather be at home in glory but
[36:03] they're here because i put them here
[36:05] it's in my plan but just know this satan
[36:08] i'm gonna get them back
[36:10] all of their children back all of their
[36:12] possessions back my family loses nothing
[36:18] nothing
[36:20] the jubilee
[36:22] restores everything say what does it
[36:24] restore to me brother jason give it to
[36:26] me in plain language the jubilee
[36:28] restores to you
[36:30] everything that god saw of you in his
[36:34] vision before the foundation of the
[36:36] world but a fallen birth hindered that
[36:39] and took it and things happened to you
[36:41] and you even were complicit in some of
[36:43] it and things didn't go always go good
[36:45] and you're sometimes you're a victim of
[36:47] your own
[36:49] feet to run swiftly to mischief
[36:51] sometimes the devil sometimes a family
[36:54] sometimes a church but whatever the
[36:56] devil has put upon you and has hindered
[36:59] that vision i'm here to tell you this
[37:02] return to jubilee is bringing you back
[37:05] to that full measure of everything you
[37:09] were ever intended to be
[37:14] there's not one
[37:16] part of you
[37:18] not one
[37:19] anything that god saw you have to
[37:21] remember god's words are eternal
[37:23] which means they're fixed
[37:25] which means they can't change that's why
[37:27] he's the same yesterday and forever
[37:29] see and that that's why that's why when
[37:31] the lamb was slain i was dealing with
[37:33] this in the in the morning bible study
[37:35] when the lamb was slain before the
[37:36] foundation of the world
[37:39] there was that was fixed there was no
[37:40] way jesus wasn't going to perform that
[37:44] because that had to be because it it
[37:46] already was before it was
[37:49] it had to be because it already had been
[37:51] you understand and and that's what we
[37:54] find today friends i started in god i'm
[37:56] finishing in god i came from the mind of
[37:59] god i'm going back to the mind of god
[38:01] and there and that's what the jubilee
[38:03] has returned to you today that's what
[38:05] this message has returned to you rejoice
[38:08] for the bride hath made herself ready
[38:12] this is why we we need to take authority
[38:14] over the enemy in our homes and in our
[38:16] lives and in our families and let him
[38:18] know the jubilee is back and i've been
[38:21] restored back to a position of authority
[38:23] in christ
[38:26] i owe the devil nothing
[38:28] i owe him nothing
[38:30] he has no say in my life i don't i'm not
[38:32] interested in a treaty
[38:36] with him
[38:37] i'm not interested in any kind of uh
[38:40] armistice i i i won't kill him
[38:46] and every blow i hit is i'm trying to
[38:48] i'm trying for the knockout
[38:50] amen i i he's trying to kill me and i'm
[38:53] trying to kill him and this this is this
[38:56] is not a game this is for blood
[38:59] oh i'm here to tell you friends i'm glad
[39:01] that i'm part of the family of god
[39:02] because in the mind of god i already won
[39:05] hallelujah
[39:10] brother branham says in the message in
[39:12] 1962 returning jubilee now
[39:16] in a type
[39:18] or a figure
[39:19] we take israel because it's the jubilee
[39:22] time
[39:23] and the church was given a portion which
[39:26] was christ himself
[39:28] that was poured out by the holy spirit
[39:31] into each heart that would receive it
[39:34] and become sons of god now that was the
[39:37] promise that israel was given that they
[39:41] declined as a nation
[39:42] that he said there come a day when i
[39:44] know you've got that law you've got that
[39:46] tables of stone
[39:48] but there's there's coming a day he
[39:50] prophesied in
[39:51] in many many places where i'm going to
[39:54] take out the heart of stone and i'm
[39:57] going to put in a heart of flesh now
[39:58] what is he saying i'm going to actually
[40:00] come and live inside you i'm not just
[40:03] going to be above you
[40:05] and you're keeping some law of moses i'm
[40:07] going to come and live inside you but
[40:09] before i can do that i gotta come live
[40:11] with you to be a kinsmen to be a
[40:14] propitiation to be an atonement to be
[40:17] your total satisfaction
[40:22] so that god can come and live inside you
[40:24] because you give your life to me
[40:27] so this was the promise
[40:30] under the jubilee
[40:32] the church was given a portion he says
[40:34] which was christ himself
[40:37] that was poured out by the holy spirit
[40:39] to each heart that would receive it and
[40:42] become sons of god now israel was a
[40:45] servant to god they was given a
[40:48] possession and this possession was not
[40:50] given to anyone else
[40:52] it was to be to israel only palestine
[40:57] belonged to them
[41:00] so there is an assurance in the jubilee
[41:04] and you know when when we look and say
[41:07] well the jubilee then is found in the
[41:09] holy ghost today
[41:11] no well you know what all what all did
[41:13] it guarantee me what what did it
[41:15] guarantee
[41:16] the receiver who received and entered
[41:19] into this time of jubilee excuse me i'll
[41:22] have to make an adjustment this thing is
[41:24] too far out and
[41:28] a little bit of popping
[41:32] so
[41:33] it guaranteed a promise
[41:37] that his chosen people
[41:40] which were the jews
[41:42] that the promise of god in the world to
[41:46] come they were they were prophesied
[41:48] about a millennial reign
[41:51] when there would come the
[41:53] the house of david would pr would would
[41:56] put a king on the throne
[41:58] that would rule and reign for a thousand
[42:01] years
[42:02] and that there would be you know new
[42:04] heavens and new earth and there's
[42:06] nothing you read in the new testament
[42:08] that's inconsistent with what the
[42:10] promise was in shadow in the old
[42:12] testament they have a perfect
[42:15] correlation between them
[42:17] and so we're prompt they were promised
[42:19] that his chosen people
[42:21] would be the leading tribe of the earth
[42:24] in the millennium
[42:26] under the son of david
[42:28] ruling from jerusalem this is why
[42:31] israel was looking for messiah when
[42:32] they're under the boot of the roman
[42:35] nation
[42:36] of the roman empire
[42:38] and they're looking for messiah to come
[42:42] and establish the rule of the son of
[42:45] david and run the romans out and
[42:48] reestablish the kingdom of israel
[42:50] because remember that israel is a type
[42:53] of you in many ways one of the ways that
[42:55] we point out often is that israel was
[42:59] placed
[43:00] in the in the center
[43:02] of of of heathen culture
[43:07] and they were dropped right in the
[43:08] center of it i mean after the flood and
[43:11] the noah and his family come out and
[43:14] then they begin to year out and age out
[43:16] and die off and sham was the last one to
[43:19] die and then right after there you find
[43:21] samira miss and nimrod and you find the
[43:24] valley of shinard you've got a uh you
[43:26] know you've got a a tower of babel and
[43:30] and and history this is ancient history
[43:32] and it's going to go forward and
[43:34] eventually congeal into the babylonian
[43:37] nation which would then become a tool in
[43:40] the hand of god because god had called
[43:43] abraham out of that chaldean religion
[43:46] and set him apart as a family in the
[43:49] earth and said in thy seed will all the
[43:51] nations of the earth be blessed and so
[43:53] now you've got a family of god in the
[43:55] earth by faith because he believed god
[43:57] came right out of heathenism and then
[43:59] you've got the forming up
[44:01] all the while you're moving toward
[44:03] babylon as a leading gentile power and
[44:07] eventually down the road they're gonna
[44:09] clash
[44:10] israel's gonna become a nation i'm gonna
[44:12] have to really
[44:13] uh
[44:15] be careful with my voice if i blow it
[44:16] out here at the beginning i'll never get
[44:18] to what i really want to get to so i'm
[44:20] gonna try to slow down a little bit and
[44:21] save my voice a little bit so just
[44:23] follow along with me if it's a less
[44:24] dynamic just try to stay awake anyway
[44:27] amen
[44:28] and so
[44:30] so it should intrigue you i love this
[44:32] stuff but because you can see it
[44:33] parallel in history you take prophecy in
[44:36] scripture and overlay it with history
[44:37] and it's flawless
[44:38] this is the greatest history book ever
[44:40] been written
[44:41] it's history and prophecy and the the i
[44:44] have confidence in the prophecy because
[44:45] i see the history it
[44:47] point for point stroke for stroke line
[44:49] for line it's flawless and perfect and
[44:52] there's no way to have made it up
[44:54] because it was written thousands of
[44:55] years uh you know and and and we see it
[44:58] come to pass a thousand years written
[45:00] thousands of years ahead of it coming to
[45:02] pass and then it came to pass see and so
[45:04] so you can imagine then why i have
[45:06] confidence in its prophecies about
[45:08] tomorrow and what it's telling me i'm in
[45:10] today and where and it's telling me this
[45:12] is my day and there's a message here and
[45:15] there's there's to be a people to
[45:16] believe it how do you know it's true
[45:17] because i'm here and i believe it
[45:22] and if i'm the only one going then i'm
[45:24] still a believer
[45:26] say what about us well you need to have
[45:28] that singular faith that if there's only
[45:30] one it's going to be me
[45:32] amen
[45:34] just be careful i'll sneak up on you and
[45:36] club you
[45:38] amen because i'm going in amen
[45:43] so so we find out that they're going to
[45:45] finally
[45:46] congeal into a nation called the jews
[45:49] david's going to sit on a throne
[45:51] solomon's going to follow him it's going
[45:52] to be a type of the millennium almost
[45:54] for the venom said like a millennium
[45:55] unfortunately after that they're going
[45:57] to begin to backslide
[45:59] just like the early church did
[46:02] see and so we're we're going to find you
[46:05] know they had already even been asking
[46:07] for a king you know was was tantamount
[46:10] that's where brother branham
[46:11] drew the correlation of nicea
[46:15] with the old testament when they asked
[46:16] for a king
[46:18] and the prophet tried to say god is your
[46:20] king they said yeah but we want to be
[46:21] like the other nations right there they
[46:23] committed adultery against god see
[46:26] and so we find out that it was just the
[46:29] it was inevitable that they would
[46:30] eventually backslide as a nation and
[46:32] then wouldn't you know it god just kind
[46:34] of accidentally had babylon right all
[46:36] accidentally right yeah god happened to
[46:39] have babylon on the scene and called
[46:41] nebuchadnezzar his servant
[46:44] because he was going to use here here
[46:46] comes a hebrew prophet saying lord
[46:49] i think it's jeremiah and he's he's so
[46:51] distraught over the sins of israel and
[46:54] he's just almost demanding lord you've
[46:56] got to do so this is horrible i mean
[46:59] they're they're full of iniquity and god
[47:02] comes to him comes to his prophet it
[47:04] wasn't jeremiah it might not have been
[47:05] but
[47:06] but anyway the narrative is the same god
[47:08] comes to him and says says listen
[47:11] i'm going to do something
[47:13] that if i told you what it was you
[47:15] wouldn't even believe it
[47:17] and he says what are you going to do he
[47:19] says i'm going to bring the king of the
[47:20] north
[47:21] and i'm going to my servant
[47:23] nebuchadnezzar and he's going to come in
[47:25] and he's going to ravage the land and
[47:27] take him captive and then the prophet
[47:29] was like no i was just kidding
[47:31] now don't do that i don't please don't
[47:33] do that but it was too late it was
[47:35] already in god's plan to do that see and
[47:38] so so but they so now they're promised
[47:41] they're waiting in the time of christ
[47:43] somebody's got to come along and restore
[47:46] because they've got a promise about a
[47:48] millennium they've got a promise of a
[47:50] new world they've got a promise of a
[47:52] restoration of the kingdom and that was
[47:54] going to be uh the the the climax of
[47:59] of the type in the bible called jubilee
[48:03] that was a calendar time but that was
[48:05] going to be fulfilled in a in a whole
[48:07] new world in a whole new way and and and
[48:11] god was going to perfect the people and
[48:14] give them glorified bodies but of course
[48:16] that couldn't come until christ came as
[48:18] a sacrifice and which and then and then
[48:21] it still had to have the upper room
[48:23] experience you've still got to have the
[48:25] upper room experience
[48:27] you've still got to accept christ as
[48:29] your personal savior you've still got to
[48:31] have a personal revelation of jesus
[48:34] christ
[48:35] made personal to you
[48:37] individually
[48:39] see and so
[48:41] so this is what the receiver was
[48:43] guaranteed and of course we had an old
[48:46] testament
[48:47] bride for israel
[48:49] say you know and there's some people say
[48:51] well israel's his people but brother
[48:53] branham there's a direct quote where
[48:54] brother adam calls calls him a hebrew
[48:56] bride
[48:57] and of course that makes sense you say
[48:59] well they were his children they were
[49:00] his family of course they were but
[49:03] once you understand
[49:05] the godhead is by expression then it
[49:08] suddenly makes sense because
[49:10] yeah they were his family but they were
[49:12] his family because they were offspring
[49:15] from the original seed the original seed
[49:17] is a spoken word
[49:19] and and you know when
[49:21] you came here by a union between a man
[49:24] and a woman a father and a mother and
[49:27] cain and abel got here that way but
[49:30] that's not how adam came
[49:32] that's not how jesus came
[49:35] you understand they came by the spoken
[49:37] word and that's why brother brennan
[49:39] would even say concerning jesus christ
[49:41] he was the son that eve would have had
[49:44] see by that spoken word but she ran
[49:46] ahead of god's program and and i was so
[49:48] appreciating brother jason sunday school
[49:51] from uh our i mean uh i think the
[49:53] wednesday night service uh you know
[49:55] talking along those lines i thought that
[49:57] was profound i got some comments if i
[49:58] have time to get to him from it this
[50:01] morning
[50:02] but we find then that he says here in
[50:05] jeremiah 3 14
[50:07] turn o backsliding children
[50:11] so they're his children saith the lord
[50:14] for i am married to you see so and i
[50:17] will take you one of a city and two of a
[50:20] family and i will bring you to zion
[50:23] all right and zion is the
[50:25] pinnacle that's that's where we're
[50:27] aiming that's where we're headed that's
[50:29] that's what our whole our that's what
[50:31] gives our existence purpose
[50:33] is we're marching to zion beautiful
[50:36] beautiful zion
[50:38] oh my this is this is what the return
[50:42] of the jubilee has accomplished for you
[50:45] because it's put you back in that cycle
[50:48] headed home the early church fell but
[50:50] the last day church was to come back to
[50:53] that and carry on to a body change
[50:56] see
[50:58] so of course it would include gentiles
[50:59] we've dealt with that also you know
[51:02] because he would they he would he would
[51:04] include gentiles in the taking of a
[51:06] people for his namesake as a bride
[51:08] there's also the 144 000 will be
[51:11] attendance to the bride
[51:13] and i you know i i know this much
[51:15] friends
[51:16] that this word that god has sent to us
[51:19] in this hour is sufficient if he can
[51:22] just keep you quiet and still it'll
[51:24] dress you in the garments of the word i
[51:27] know that this word is a jubilee word we
[51:30] have returned to the faith of our
[51:32] fathers and it will accomplish the
[51:35] purpose of why it came
[51:37] sometimes he's just got to get you to
[51:39] stand still long enough and allow him to
[51:42] deal with your life and don't always be
[51:44] in such a layout of sin hurry sometimes
[51:46] you need to get alone with god sometimes
[51:49] you need to be still and know that i am
[51:51] god
[51:53] see
[51:56] this same word that
[51:58] we're receiving today brother jason how
[52:01] how do i know i mean
[52:03] i just seem to have
[52:05] so many areas in my life that are still
[52:07] weak and
[52:08] they're chaos and well i'm going to tell
[52:10] you something friends this word came on
[52:12] an earth that was in chaos and brought
[52:14] it into order
[52:16] it created all the heavens and the earth
[52:18] and and and without interference it made
[52:22] all things work in harmony with the very
[52:26] nature of the creator
[52:28] and that's what you see no wonder
[52:30] brother branham would say that you know
[52:33] if god had chosen
[52:35] uh the wind
[52:36] to preach the gospel or he said he could
[52:39] have chosen the trees to preach the
[52:40] gospel brother brown says frankly would
[52:42] have probably been done a long time ago
[52:44] because the wind would have just obeyed
[52:45] him and the trees would have just obeyed
[52:47] him it's mankind
[52:49] it's humanity
[52:51] that always gives him his problems
[52:53] we're always getting in the way we can't
[52:55] get out of our own way much less try to
[52:57] get out of his way
[52:58] you know this is what the gospel is for
[53:00] this is what church service is for this
[53:02] is what your bible reading is for it's
[53:03] what tape listings it's what fellowship
[53:05] does it's what prayer does it's what a
[53:07] prayer closet does
[53:09] see
[53:10] it gets you alone with god there's
[53:12] there's so many times i i can't you know
[53:15] it'd be hard to oversell
[53:17] the value
[53:19] of having being alone with god jacob was
[53:22] alone with god
[53:23] jephthah was alone with god you you find
[53:26] that that jesus got alone you find that
[53:29] peter was alone on the housetop amen you
[53:32] find all of these times you find that
[53:34] cornelius was in prayer alone when the
[53:36] angel came to you fine john was alone on
[53:38] the island of patmos there's a there's
[53:41] there's value in getting alone with god
[53:43] and just quietly communicating with your
[53:46] master
[53:48] see laodicea tries to block that
[53:50] constantly it fills your life up with so
[53:52] much stuff
[53:57] see but if he would have just used the
[53:59] wind or the trees
[54:01] it would have all been finished they
[54:02] would have obeyed him even in a fallen i
[54:04] i noticed when i go out in nature
[54:07] i was talking to
[54:08] my son the other day we were doing some
[54:11] bird watching and
[54:13] and and and i was just commenting as we
[54:15] were running along uh walking along a
[54:17] nature trail i said i want you to notice
[54:20] this nature i said everything you see
[54:22] here is is is a is a testimony to the
[54:28] character of god
[54:30] all nature tries to worship and praise
[54:32] him the leaves clap their hands the wind
[54:34] the sun the bible says the sun rises
[54:36] every morning and declares his glory to
[54:38] the world to a world who hates him who
[54:40] doesn't even believe him many of him
[54:42] don't even believe he's true and yet a
[54:43] son is up there declaring his glory
[54:44] every day
[54:46] see and all nature you know joins and
[54:49] that's why the bible says all nature's
[54:51] groaning
[54:53] their their nature itself under this
[54:55] burden of sin sin is on the earth
[54:58] literally
[54:59] and it and and nature struggles and but
[55:02] yet the the trees and the flowers and
[55:04] you talk about death burial and
[55:06] resurrection how that you know that with
[55:08] the seasons you come and the leaves fall
[55:11] and then the spring the buds come back
[55:12] and then the leaves come out and then
[55:13] they die again and then winter time
[55:15] comes and then the buds come back and
[55:16] then it comes back again and this death
[55:19] burial and resurrection death burial and
[55:20] resurrection and and all of nature
[55:24] even under sin
[55:26] struggles to to
[55:28] to to to be an image of the character of
[55:32] god that's what a believer is friends
[55:35] that's what we are as sons and daughters
[55:37] of god yes we're in fallen bodies yes we
[55:39] make mistakes yes it's a sin a sinful
[55:42] world yes the lid is torn off and demon
[55:44] powers are screaming but but even under
[55:46] this struggle i'm constantly trying to
[55:49] to be an illustration of his nature i'm
[55:51] trying to show the world what it's like
[55:54] to have christ living inside of us
[55:59] isn't it true
[56:01] see
[56:07] i tell you something friends we're
[56:08] headed somewhere i i love that statement
[56:12] where brother branham talks about when
[56:14] you cross over
[56:16] and i don't know
[56:19] for all i know i'll cross over before
[56:21] tomorrow before i know for all i know
[56:23] you will
[56:24] before i know before for all we know the
[56:26] rapture could come any minute
[56:29] but you say well that's kind of
[56:32] uncertain well
[56:34] it's it's uncertain as to when but it's
[56:36] very certain that it is
[56:38] it is coming
[56:40] there is a world waiting and we are
[56:41] going somewhere this world is not my
[56:43] home
[56:44] not in its current condition
[56:47] and so we find that
[56:50] you know in that in that regard
[56:52] brother branham said when you cross over
[56:55] the first thing now you just take some
[56:57] peace in this this morning because the
[56:59] prophet will be the only one that could
[57:01] know this
[57:02] when you cross over
[57:04] one of the first things that'll go
[57:05] through your mind
[57:07] is why was i ever worried
[57:12] why was i and not just why was i
[57:14] worried that i might not make it i
[57:16] haven't worried about that in a long
[57:18] time
[57:18] i haven't worried that i would miss the
[57:20] rapture because i am the rapture
[57:23] but you know
[57:24] what
[57:25] to to say to say
[57:28] how that i was an overcomer you know
[57:30] there that's where our real battle is
[57:33] friends if we're real sons and daughters
[57:35] of god is that we've tasted of the
[57:37] heavenly manna and it causes us to want
[57:39] more and it causes us to want to be more
[57:42] i mean as paul said listen
[57:44] if if the resurrection isn't true then
[57:47] of all men i would be the most miserable
[57:49] see because paul had saw it
[57:52] paul got caught up to the third evidence
[57:53] like somebody inviting you over to a
[57:56] seven-course meal and letting you walk
[57:58] in and walk around the table and smell
[58:00] it and salivate and say now isn't that
[58:02] beautiful yes it's gonna oh it smells so
[58:04] heavenly sorry you don't get to eat it
[58:05] now please
[58:06] leave i'd rather not i'd rather not saw
[58:09] it
[58:10] i'd just rather you never told me about
[58:12] it i'd just rather you told me that the
[58:13] only thing in the world was potato skins
[58:16] and there's nothing else in creation
[58:18] other than that don't take me and then
[58:20] paul said i've already saw it and now
[58:22] that i've saw it i heard things that
[58:24] can't even be said i i can't even put it
[58:26] in language i have a prophet in this day
[58:28] who said i don't have enough words to
[58:30] tell you and if i'm not going i'd rather
[58:33] never know but i do know and i am going
[58:36] hallelujah
[58:39] and i take such courage in that today
[58:44] see
[58:45] i'm i i'm often amazed that anyone would
[58:48] feel the need
[58:50] to distance the last day bride from the
[58:52] original pentecostal experience in the
[58:54] book of acts
[58:57] it's just astonish unless
[59:00] it stuns me
[59:02] i i've never been able to get my mind
[59:04] around
[59:05] even the motive behind wanting to do
[59:07] that
[59:08] i can't i can't fathom that
[59:11] and so
[59:12] i mean to me that's everything that's
[59:15] the jubilee that's the holy ghost that's
[59:17] the new birth that's the life of christ
[59:19] that's my ticket home
[59:22] hallelujah you're not getting my ticket
[59:24] home
[59:25] you can have air take my houses my lands
[59:27] change my dreams my plans i've placed my
[59:30] whole life in his hands
[59:33] hallelujah
[59:36] i mean when you look at the revelation
[59:39] 10 1 angel give me that on the screen
[59:42] guys
[59:43] revelation 10 1. let's make a quick note
[59:47] i'm not going to break it down because
[59:48] there's a lot to be said
[59:50] revelation 10 1 angel
[59:52] of course
[59:54] is the lord jesus christ
[59:56] and i saw another mighty angel
[59:59] come down from heaven clothed with a
[1:00:00] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:00:03] and his face was as it were the sun and
[1:00:05] his feet as pillars of fire there's four
[1:00:07] examples right there
[1:00:09] of christ appearing in the form of his
[1:00:11] bride
[1:00:12] i'll just deal with two of them a
[1:00:14] rainbow's upon his head just two of them
[1:00:15] all right he's got he's also closed with
[1:00:17] a cloud and i definitely could take you
[1:00:19] on a trail through the scripture to show
[1:00:21] you that's christ in his family and then
[1:00:23] his and his face was as it were the sun
[1:00:26] don't even get me started but just look
[1:00:28] at the rainbow brother branham said
[1:00:31] why
[1:00:31] why a rainbow
[1:00:33] because a rainbow
[1:00:35] is means a covenant angel
[1:00:38] see now this is not the strong angel
[1:00:40] standing with john there was a strong
[1:00:42] angel representing the prophet of our
[1:00:44] day standing with john who represented
[1:00:46] the bride amen
[1:00:47] so you've got you've got the strong
[1:00:49] angel you've got a mighty angel you've
[1:00:50] got the bride you've got the sea of
[1:00:52] glass crystal see because she's pure and
[1:00:55] holy and clean you've got the four and
[1:00:57] 20 elders you've got all the heavenly
[1:00:59] hosts you've got the one daniel sauce
[1:01:01] seated on the throne you've got christ
[1:01:03] stepping out of eternity hallelujah
[1:01:05] you've got a lamb's book of life and and
[1:01:07] christ coming as a lion as a slain lamb
[1:01:10] to take it call for a queen the only the
[1:01:12] only person you don't have in this scene
[1:01:16] is lucifer
[1:01:17] because there's therefore now no
[1:01:20] condemnation to them who are in the
[1:01:22] jubilee
[1:01:24] to them who are born of the spirit of
[1:01:26] god the book has been opened and you
[1:01:28] realize that you are the book of life
[1:01:30] your names are on that book
[1:01:34] and so brother branham said he
[1:01:36] has a rainbow because it's a covenant
[1:01:38] and brother branham would just go back i
[1:01:40] love i just love a hillbilly prophet
[1:01:45] because you can't beat him because
[1:01:47] he he's not going to go out there in
[1:01:49] theological deep waters that you don't
[1:01:51] even understand anyway
[1:01:52] and and your
[1:01:54] eight-year theology degree only confuses
[1:01:56] you worse he'll just stand over here in
[1:01:58] the shallow waters and go back and take
[1:01:59] a piece of paper and go back to the old
[1:02:00] chinese laundry man and he'd say you're
[1:02:02] right you bring your laundry you don't
[1:02:04] speak english you don't speak mandarin
[1:02:06] so you just write your name big on a
[1:02:07] piece of paper and he rips it in half he
[1:02:09] keeps the top half you keep the bottom
[1:02:10] half and when you bring it back you've
[1:02:12] got the lower half of who you are your
[1:02:14] name he's got the upper half see here's
[1:02:17] a descending angel it's a covenant he's
[1:02:20] got a rainbow because it's a covenant
[1:02:22] and it and it fits it comes back again
[1:02:25] and it fits perfectly
[1:02:27] hallelujah it's christ coming in in his
[1:02:30] body
[1:02:31] that's what the message of the hour is
[1:02:33] this why brother branham would call it
[1:02:36] the bride coming of christ
[1:02:39] see it is it is the lord jesus christ
[1:02:41] but revelation 10 1 portrays him in the
[1:02:44] biblical imagery of the bride coming of
[1:02:47] christ because that's what the world is
[1:02:50] blind to they're looking for the nail
[1:02:52] scarred man and they won't see him until
[1:02:55] revelation 19 at the end of the
[1:02:57] tribulation but to you who do see him
[1:03:00] now
[1:03:02] you say where is he i'm looking at him
[1:03:04] hallelujah where's the book i'm looking
[1:03:07] at the book
[1:03:09] hallelujah
[1:03:11] his feet are as of pillars of fire not
[1:03:13] pillar
[1:03:15] of fire
[1:03:16] pillars like in the upper room at
[1:03:18] pentecost he divided himself into his
[1:03:20] church oh hallelujah it's pillars of
[1:03:23] fire and you know what he puts one foot
[1:03:25] on the land and one foot on the sea
[1:03:27] because he's saying that old roman
[1:03:29] system of the of the old world i've got
[1:03:32] authority over that and in revelation 13
[1:03:34] he comes up in the land and i got
[1:03:36] authority over him and this bright
[1:03:38] coming of christ has one foot on the
[1:03:40] land and one on the sea that every b
[1:03:42] system is under your feet
[1:03:46] and that's the jubilee fringe that's the
[1:03:49] liberty you have in christ jesus
[1:03:52] that's the authority by which you claim
[1:03:54] your children
[1:03:58] the authority behind it
[1:04:00] there's no you can't enforce that say i
[1:04:02] claim my children
[1:04:03] how are you going to go get them you
[1:04:04] can't say you couldn't save you
[1:04:06] how you gonna save them
[1:04:08] see
[1:04:09] and so i i have to bring my token
[1:04:12] well my my token is my page of authority
[1:04:16] it's my it's my id badge hallelujah it
[1:04:19] shows that i'm part of a part of christ
[1:04:21] coming in this hour
[1:04:24] oh this is what they they miss they they
[1:04:27] chop him into three pieces two pieces
[1:04:29] one piece oh he's you can never put him
[1:04:32] like that in some man-made explanation
[1:04:34] he's the ever unfolding expression of
[1:04:37] almighty god he'll be that in the
[1:04:39] ceaseless ages to come
[1:04:43] see so
[1:04:45] so the millennium then will be the full
[1:04:48] family of god
[1:04:51] as at
[1:04:52] pentecost
[1:04:54] but now
[1:04:56] with the adoption completed
[1:04:58] the family all having glorified bodies
[1:05:01] likened unto his glorified body
[1:05:04] that's that's our existence
[1:05:06] in the millennium see
[1:05:09] and so the royal family then would be
[1:05:11] the perfection of that church at
[1:05:12] pentecost so why would we seek to
[1:05:15] distance ourselves from it
[1:05:17] why ever even let that concept come into
[1:05:19] your mind
[1:05:20] we're say oh
[1:05:22] brother branham said you can't mix this
[1:05:24] with pentecost
[1:05:28] he's not talking about acts 2.
[1:05:30] he's talking about 1906
[1:05:32] he's talking about what became a
[1:05:34] denomination of course you can't mix
[1:05:36] that with this he's not talking about
[1:05:38] the upper room that's the new birth
[1:05:41] that is the message of the hour
[1:05:44] see my goodness
[1:05:46] and so
[1:05:47] so this royal family in the millennium
[1:05:49] will be the perfection of that church at
[1:05:51] pentecost that's what we're aiming at
[1:05:53] that's why we preach you have to have an
[1:05:55] experience with the holy ghost see
[1:05:58] so human beings think about that
[1:06:02] in the under the authority of this
[1:06:04] jubilee
[1:06:05] human beings operating in glorified
[1:06:07] bodies
[1:06:09] the full mind of christ operating the
[1:06:11] power of god ruling and reigning
[1:06:14] with christ managing world affairs
[1:06:17] among the nations amen that's our
[1:06:19] millennial as priests and kings that's
[1:06:21] our that's our millennial destiny
[1:06:24] lords and ladies if you will of the
[1:06:27] royal family representing the justice of
[1:06:29] christ the peace of christ the laws of
[1:06:31] christ we're there to represent the king
[1:06:35] ruling and reigning with him
[1:06:38] for a thousand years
[1:06:40] so then
[1:06:42] so then when you read joel 2 now brother
[1:06:44] mark give me joel chapter 2
[1:06:47] and let's catch 10 verses starting in
[1:06:48] verse 23.
[1:06:51] now i want you to follow along with this
[1:06:53] because
[1:06:58] if everything i'm saying is true
[1:07:01] about what we're headed for
[1:07:04] then
[1:07:05] you're being prepared for that right now
[1:07:09] and you're already coming into that
[1:07:12] right now so that when this
[1:07:15] bride receives a body change it's a very
[1:07:19] short step
[1:07:21] it's not a long listen they're they're
[1:07:24] they're you're going to see here in a
[1:07:25] minute about the former reign let's
[1:07:27] let's read it together verse 23 be glad
[1:07:30] then
[1:07:31] now this is joel
[1:07:33] uh where where peter was referring to
[1:07:35] brother branham said he's referring to
[1:07:37] joel's prophecy all right now remember
[1:07:40] she said well i was fulfilled in the
[1:07:42] early church right right right right but
[1:07:44] they fell away remember and now we're
[1:07:46] restored back remember they crested off
[1:07:48] started backsliding christ sits down
[1:07:50] seals the word seven seals at the end he
[1:07:52] opens it up brings us back to that and
[1:07:54] carries us on so now the omega is being
[1:07:57] restored to the alpha amen you get me
[1:08:00] all right so so you're here this is this
[1:08:03] is this now is you
[1:08:04] all right
[1:08:05] be glad then your children of zion and
[1:08:08] rejoice in the lord your god
[1:08:12] for he hath given you
[1:08:15] the former reign moderately
[1:08:17] and he will cause to come down for you
[1:08:20] the rain
[1:08:21] the former rain and the latter rain in
[1:08:23] the first month
[1:08:24] and the floors shall be full of wheat
[1:08:26] and the fats shall overflow with wine
[1:08:28] and oil
[1:08:29] and i will restore to you all right so
[1:08:32] now
[1:08:33] this this return this this jubilee
[1:08:36] that's coming
[1:08:37] is the is a time when the former latter
[1:08:40] rain is coming uh
[1:08:42] in the first month so
[1:08:44] yeah first of all you understand there
[1:08:46] there's a whole lot said about former
[1:08:47] latter rain and let me let me just kind
[1:08:50] of cut to the chase because it's a whole
[1:08:51] sermon where where we're positioned the
[1:08:53] former and where the latter rain started
[1:08:55] so clearly the let me just cut to the
[1:08:57] ladder clearly the latter rain starts
[1:08:59] with the opening of the seals because
[1:09:00] that's the restoration of the mystery of
[1:09:03] god amen now you say so so now here's
[1:09:07] the here's the pitfall
[1:09:09] in thinking
[1:09:11] and sometimes this ideology gets in
[1:09:13] people's heads
[1:09:15] oh um
[1:09:16] someday
[1:09:18] a power's coming under the third pool
[1:09:20] there's coming a new message and there's
[1:09:22] coming a great power and the bride's
[1:09:24] gonna have a revival that's gonna take
[1:09:26] us into the body change
[1:09:28] okay first of all
[1:09:30] that is completely upside down to the
[1:09:32] scripture and to nature
[1:09:34] because if you understand anything about
[1:09:37] raising crops
[1:09:38] is once your latter rain comes that's
[1:09:41] the last rain you want to head it to the
[1:09:44] heart to head it to ripening and in fact
[1:09:46] is once that's come if if it rains again
[1:09:49] you ruin a crop so the whole thing
[1:09:51] you're waiting on is the latter rain has
[1:09:54] come and now it's moved out there the
[1:09:56] shuck has pulled away the grain is out
[1:09:58] there baking in the presence of the
[1:10:00] august presence of god and what's it
[1:10:03] doing coming to a harvest we're not
[1:10:05] waiting for another revival you're in it
[1:10:09] we're not waiting for another superman

[1:10:20] in it right now it's happening all
[1:10:23] around you
[1:10:25] so they say well what's the what's the
[1:10:26] significance then stop letting the devil
[1:10:29] live in your life and stop letting the
[1:10:31] devil push you around and stop letting
[1:10:33] the devil make you afraid and make you
[1:10:35] sick and make you fearful we have
[1:10:37] victory
[1:10:39] we have the authority this is the hour
[1:10:41] where we have the sayeth the lord
[1:10:44] amen
[1:10:45] they're experiencing that right now in
[1:10:47] ukraine
[1:10:48] as we speak
[1:10:50] i'll get to it in a minute
[1:10:53] so he says
[1:10:56] verse 24.
[1:10:59] this is this is
[1:11:01] this is right now
[1:11:03] this is what the jubilee
[1:11:05] brings you
[1:11:07] this is what the return of the token
[1:11:09] brings us
[1:11:11] and the floors shall be full of wheat
[1:11:14] and the fats shall overflow with wine
[1:11:16] and oil
[1:11:19] and i
[1:11:20] will restore to you
[1:11:22] the years that the locusts hath eaten
[1:11:24] the cankerworm and the caterpillar in
[1:11:25] the palm or my great army which i sent
[1:11:27] among you
[1:11:28] and ye shall eat in plenty and be
[1:11:30] satisfied
[1:11:32] and praise the name of the lord your god
[1:11:35] that hath dealt wondrously with you
[1:11:38] and my people shall never be ashamed say
[1:11:41] well this is on the other side right but
[1:11:43] the elements of this are in play right
[1:11:45] now
[1:11:46] because this is what peter identified
[1:11:48] when they said these men are drunk and
[1:11:50] peter said no this is what joel
[1:11:53] prophesied would happen to us and that
[1:11:55] wasn't the rapture that was the birth of
[1:11:57] the church see watch
[1:12:00] you shall lead in plenty of verse 27
[1:12:02] ye shall know
[1:12:04] that i am in the midst of israel and
[1:12:06] that i am the lord your god and none
[1:12:08] else and my people shall never be
[1:12:10] ashamed i know that right now
[1:12:13] i'm not confused i'm in man-made
[1:12:15] theology i'm not trapped up in man-made
[1:12:18] denominations it's all well it's all
[1:12:21] going to the mark of the beast it's all
[1:12:22] blasphemous names my eyes have been
[1:12:25] opened i know who the lord is
[1:12:29] oh that's why brother brandon would say
[1:12:31] oh you in new york city you in tucson
[1:12:34] you out here you in there rejoice the
[1:12:36] bride has made herself ready
[1:12:39] that's why there's a rejoicing among the
[1:12:41] saints of god that's why we come here
[1:12:43] and there's an excitement to have the
[1:12:44] presence of god among us
[1:12:48] watch
[1:12:49] and it shall come to pass afterward that
[1:12:51] i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[1:12:53] and your sons and your daughters shall
[1:12:54] prophesy your old men
[1:12:56] shall dream dreams so certainly this is
[1:12:58] before the
[1:12:59] catching away
[1:13:01] you're young men because you got old man
[1:13:02] your young men shall see visions and
[1:13:04] also
[1:13:05] upon my upon the servants and upon
[1:13:08] the handmaids in those days will i pour
[1:13:11] out my spirit
[1:13:13] and i will show one now watch as he
[1:13:15] moves toward the end time and i will
[1:13:17] show wonders in the heavens and in the
[1:13:19] earth blood and fire and pillars of
[1:13:20] smoke the sun shall be turned into
[1:13:23] darkness and the moon into blood before
[1:13:26] the great and terrible day of the lord
[1:13:28] come see now we're trending now look at
[1:13:30] the very next verse and it shall come to
[1:13:32] pass see
[1:13:34] when shall it come to pass
[1:13:36] after the terrible day of the lord come
[1:13:39] and it shall come to pass that whosoever
[1:13:41] shall call on the name of the lord shall
[1:13:43] be delivered for in mount zion and in
[1:13:46] jerusalem shall be deliverance as the
[1:13:49] lord hath said and in the remnant whom
[1:13:51] the lord shall call i'm here to tell you
[1:13:53] we're going to make it
[1:13:55] we're going to make it friends you say
[1:13:57] how do you know that last verse is going
[1:13:59] to come to pass because all the other
[1:14:00] ones did
[1:14:01] i see all the other ones why would i
[1:14:03] doubt the last one
[1:14:05] hallelujah this world is headed toward a
[1:14:08] terrible day but i'm going to be home in
[1:14:10] glory
[1:14:12] hallelujah
[1:14:14] with the things friends that we know
[1:14:19] with the things that we know
[1:14:22] and how that we know they go forward
[1:14:24] in the millennium
[1:14:27] i mean there's some things we know we
[1:14:28] don't know at all because as a honeymoon
[1:14:30] a lot of it's kept secret
[1:14:32] but we there's some things we do know we
[1:14:34] know time continues
[1:14:36] we know that time keeps going see
[1:14:39] nations are reborn the heathen
[1:14:43] are raised up to hear the gospel
[1:14:44] preaching i just read it recently i just
[1:14:46] refreshed myself brother brown says it
[1:14:48] in a couple different places
[1:14:50] about that because the bible says we'll
[1:14:51] rule and reign
[1:14:53] for a thousand years and he said what's
[1:14:55] ruling and reigning if you don't have
[1:14:56] any subjects
[1:14:57] so you understand over a thousand years
[1:14:58] say well there's a thousand years enough
[1:15:00] time to do that good great friends what
[1:15:02] is this nation 250 years old 200 and
[1:15:05] however many
[1:15:06] and i mean look look how long our
[1:15:08] history seems to us all the way back to
[1:15:09] the days of george washington of course
[1:15:10] a thousand years
[1:15:12] nations will be long established
[1:15:14] and and there will be a royal family and
[1:15:16] there will be christ on the throne and
[1:15:18] we will be priests and kings and we will
[1:15:20] be the executors of his will and his
[1:15:22] word and his justice and his peace
[1:15:23] hallelujah we're going somewhere
[1:15:26] oh my
[1:15:28] for sure for sure for sure say what all
[1:15:31] do we know well i know for sure uh that
[1:15:34] that that the millennium will will be
[1:15:36] more than merely a thousand year church
[1:15:38] dinner and fellowship
[1:15:39] [Laughter]
[1:15:42] i love church dinners and fellowship but
[1:15:44] it's going to be more than a thousand
[1:15:45] year church dinner friends
[1:15:47] oh most of joel's prophecy that we just
[1:15:50] read is fulfilled on this side and
[1:15:52] that's what the jubilee is all about
[1:15:56] we have returned to jubilee
[1:15:59] see god
[1:16:01] god is going to make up for the 2000
[1:16:03] years of misery
[1:16:05] and separation in a 1 000 year reign is
[1:16:07] going to make life there twice as good
[1:16:09] as it ever was bad here
[1:16:11] oh hallelujah when you read the
[1:16:12] martyrology and you look at what the
[1:16:14] church went through it seems
[1:16:16] unimaginable well he's gonna in a
[1:16:19] thousand years he's gonna make up for
[1:16:21] two thousand years and it's gonna be
[1:16:22] double good as bad as it ever was oh
[1:16:25] hallelujah oh god's going to make up for
[1:16:28] it friends oh my
[1:16:29] that's why brother brandon would say
[1:16:31] we're going to live we're going to life
[1:16:34] we're going to live see
[1:16:36] and and so so
[1:16:38] you know brother branham would say
[1:16:40] you know civilization
[1:16:43] education he said all of these things
[1:16:46] are of the devil and yet brother branham
[1:16:48] wasn't against education or civil
[1:16:50] civilized law
[1:16:52] because when you have the breakdown of
[1:16:54] civilized law then barbarism sets in
[1:16:55] that's history is
[1:16:58] unequivocal in testifying to that
[1:17:00] that you think people are so civilized
[1:17:03] just let civilized law collapse and you
[1:17:05] you'll find out what man is capable of
[1:17:07] doing to man in a fallen condition
[1:17:09] because outside the holy ghost he's just
[1:17:11] beast
[1:17:12] remember see he's civilized got laws
[1:17:15] but uh he's just beast and when that
[1:17:17] when that order collapses then you get
[1:17:19] barbarism every single time it never has
[1:17:21] failed even one time
[1:17:22] and so so we find that
[1:17:25] that
[1:17:26] brother brennan would say we're going to
[1:17:29] a civilization but a a civilization and
[1:17:32] an education so much higher than this
[1:17:35] one
[1:17:36] it would hardly even be compared said
[1:17:39] everybody brother ram said everybody's
[1:17:41] saying we got to go to the moon we got
[1:17:42] to go to the moon we've got to go to the
[1:17:43] moon brother brahm said i want to pass
[1:17:45] the moon so fast i don't even see it
[1:17:48] hallelujah amen
[1:17:50] oh my why is all this important see
[1:17:53] because i see
[1:17:55] that if i look at the millennium in this
[1:17:57] in this larger aspect and
[1:17:59] oh boy
[1:18:01] do i ever want to get busy getting
[1:18:03] myself ready oh boy do i ever want to be
[1:18:06] dedicated to the lord oh my goodness
[1:18:09] friends do i ever want to sell out
[1:18:11] everything and say father take over my
[1:18:13] whole life take over my whole mind
[1:18:16] that's the value of looking at what's
[1:18:18] coming
[1:18:19] oh i need to i think we need to get busy
[1:18:21] don't you friends come on i think we
[1:18:23] need to get busy and be serious because
[1:18:25] we're we're just on the verge of world
[1:18:28] transitioning
[1:18:29] i think we need to encourage each other
[1:18:31] to press toward the mark because we see
[1:18:34] it a little bit clearer today you are to
[1:18:35] encourage one another don't be a
[1:18:37] discouragement at one another encourage
[1:18:39] one another so what paul said to the
[1:18:41] thessalonians encourage each other with
[1:18:43] these words see
[1:18:45] so
[1:18:46] hey maybe we haven't been thinking large
[1:18:48] enough
[1:18:49] you know maybe we haven't been thinking
[1:18:51] large enough
[1:18:53] so here's a kickstarter for you we're
[1:18:55] going to life
[1:18:57] we're going to live friends
[1:19:00] that's what the jubilee has returned to
[1:19:02] us in this hour
[1:19:04] you know that's why i had such a
[1:19:06] particular appreciation
[1:19:08] for brother jason breaking that down
[1:19:10] about how that satan offered eve
[1:19:13] you know to be independent like him and
[1:19:15] self-governing
[1:19:16] call your own shot make your own
[1:19:18] decisions choose your own lifestyle be
[1:19:20] like god he does that
[1:19:22] be like him you know be independent make
[1:19:25] call your own shots he tells every
[1:19:27] teenager that you know see and and and i
[1:19:30] love how brother jd broke it down that
[1:19:32] it's just a it's like a it's just a trap
[1:19:35] you know it's it's a spider web
[1:19:37] and it's a black widow and she's just
[1:19:39] luring you in
[1:19:41] and and and there's absolute death
[1:19:44] waiting see lucifer knew he needed that
[1:19:46] book of life he knows that that book of
[1:19:49] life contains the secret
[1:19:51] see that's why he was chasing it he he
[1:19:53] went to take it from adam as we said in
[1:19:55] the beginning
[1:19:56] but his brother branham said his filthy
[1:19:58] hands couldn't hold it and we we see it
[1:20:00] again and it's in heaven i'm getting too
[1:20:02] much echo now
[1:20:03] and so we we see it that it was in
[1:20:05] heaven i mean that's why he accuses you
[1:20:07] there because that's where it went see
[1:20:09] so he's still after that book of life
[1:20:11] and the book of life but the book but
[1:20:14] what he's missing is is that the book of
[1:20:16] life was to be written behind skin
[1:20:19] just like i said to you the last time
[1:20:21] this this is the third iteration of the
[1:20:24] bible
[1:20:26] the stars were the first one the pyramid
[1:20:28] was the second one enoch's pyramid this
[1:20:30] one is the third and there's a fourth
[1:20:32] iteration and it's flesh
[1:20:34] that's why brother branham said when the
[1:20:36] books are closed for the last time the
[1:20:38] word will be flesh he's not coming to
[1:20:39] rapture your bible he's coming to
[1:20:42] rapture you
[1:20:44] this is the freedom that you enjoy
[1:20:46] friends oh my goodness teens want their
[1:20:49] freedom i thought how remarkable as i
[1:20:52] was listening to the wednesday night
[1:20:53] service and
[1:20:55] i was uh by rule i couldn't come because
[1:20:57] i was really pretty sick and so
[1:21:00] excuse me so
[1:21:02] but you know brother jd talking about
[1:21:04] how that teens want their freedom and i
[1:21:06] thought wow now here i'm going i'm
[1:21:08] studying on the jubilee on the on the
[1:21:11] setting free
[1:21:12] and here he is talking about teens are
[1:21:14] going to get trapped and people are
[1:21:16] going to get trapped and and i thought
[1:21:18] what a what a perfect foundation i hope
[1:21:20] you were paying attention wednesday
[1:21:22] night i hope if you weren't here you
[1:21:23] caught an archive it was vital it was
[1:21:25] top secret intel that the devil wouldn't
[1:21:28] want you to know
[1:21:29] you need to listen to it several times
[1:21:31] because that's the but you need to know
[1:21:33] your enemy
[1:21:34] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:21:36] we're in the time of liberty now this is
[1:21:38] the jubilee
[1:21:39] the bride has come back to her freedom
[1:21:42] she's not here for bondage
[1:21:44] because i can promise you
[1:21:47] and i've
[1:21:48] i've studied humanity
[1:21:50] for years in ministry
[1:21:52] and i can tell you that when brother jd
[1:21:54] talked about it it's a trick just to
[1:21:56] grab more control and lock you under
[1:21:58] further bondage i want you to know
[1:22:01] something every drug addict
[1:22:04] knows that's true
[1:22:06] every sex addict
[1:22:08] every money addict
[1:22:10] every fame addict every power addict
[1:22:13] knows
[1:22:14] that's true
[1:22:17] if they don't die you know
[1:22:20] you know
[1:22:21] if they go on and if they don't end up
[1:22:23] dying a premature way
[1:22:25] they they finally reach many of them
[1:22:27] don't
[1:22:28] most of them don't
[1:22:30] when you become addicted to any one of
[1:22:32] those things it ends your life
[1:22:33] prematurely
[1:22:35] you die a sad lonely broken person you
[1:22:38] you you finally get to a point where you
[1:22:41] you had all this fame you had all this
[1:22:42] money
[1:22:43] this this sex addiction this money
[1:22:45] addiction this power addiction this fame
[1:22:47] addiction that this this drug addiction
[1:22:49] until finally people literally step
[1:22:52] beyond the fear of death
[1:22:54] and the fear of death can't keep them
[1:22:56] back anymore and they step in a closet
[1:22:58] and hang themselves
[1:23:00] after they were famous after they were
[1:23:02] rich and they even die and hang
[1:23:03] themselves rich
[1:23:06] and they're still famous and still rich
[1:23:08] and still couldn't sit down in a
[1:23:09] restaurant without being mobbed and they
[1:23:11] take their own life why because it's
[1:23:13] what every addict knows that when you go
[1:23:15] the way of the world and satan pulls you
[1:23:17] in and pulls you in you hear me young
[1:23:18] people he pulls you in he pulls you and
[1:23:20] he pulls you in i'm here to tell you
[1:23:22] every last one of them you read their
[1:23:24] life stories of all these rock stars and
[1:23:26] movie stars and sports stars and
[1:23:27] politicians and they died and jumped out
[1:23:30] of windows and hung themselves and shot
[1:23:31] themselves and they died young and died
[1:23:33] and overdosed drugs and their whole life
[1:23:35] was blown to pieces
[1:23:38] blown to pieces
[1:23:40] because they listened to the siren song
[1:23:43] of the enemy they they let the pied
[1:23:44] piper lead them down that path
[1:23:47] oh it's bondage the jubilee is here
[1:23:52] hallelujah you have authority now to
[1:23:54] make a claim in the name of christ
[1:23:58] oh my

[1:24:04] hopelessness
[1:24:05] that they all come to
[1:24:07] they feel so desperate

[1:24:20] too many till it's sickening

[1:26:11] didn't have to pay nothing
[1:26:13] didn't have to do nothing
[1:26:15] just get up and go
[1:26:18] i don't care what kind of bondage you
[1:26:20] might have arrived at this building with
[1:26:21] today
[1:26:22] i'm just here to tell you you can just
[1:26:24] get up and walk away from it
[1:26:26] you don't have to leave here with the
[1:26:28] bondage you came with you can be free
[1:26:30] because this is the hour of return to
[1:26:33] jubilee
[1:26:35] he says that's all he had to do go back
[1:26:38] if he knew the sound of the trumpet but
[1:26:39] he had to know the sound of the trumpet
[1:26:41] see for they were sons of god
[1:26:43] this is why i said to you at the
[1:26:45] beginning i owe satan nothing
[1:26:46] i owe him nothing you owe him nothing
[1:26:50] don't feel any allegiance to him you owe
[1:26:52] him zero
[1:26:53] see
[1:26:54] brother branham says he goes on we jesus
[1:26:57] said in saint john 8 35 that the son
[1:26:59] abides forever in the house now watch
[1:27:03] uh give me second kings four brother
[1:27:05] mark and be prepared i'll give you the
[1:27:06] verse in a minute let's get second kings
[1:27:07] four ready
[1:27:10] he says jesus said in saint john 8 35
[1:27:13] that the son abides forever in the
[1:27:16] house now a servant does not abide
[1:27:20] a servant does not abide remember he is
[1:27:23] a son not a servant if he's a son he's
[1:27:26] born a son if he's a servant
[1:27:29] he is joined or bought all right
[1:27:33] now here comes an interesting story in
[1:27:35] the days of elisha now watch second
[1:27:37] kings
[1:27:38] chapter 4 verse 1
[1:27:40] 1-7
[1:27:42] now there cried a certain woman of the
[1:27:44] wives of the sons of the prophets unto
[1:27:46] elisha saying
[1:27:48] thy servant my husband is dead and thou
[1:27:50] knowest that thy servant did fear the
[1:27:52] lord
[1:27:53] and the creditor her husband is actually
[1:27:55] part of the priesthood the lord and the
[1:27:58] creditor is co okay let me start again
[1:28:00] now there cried a certain woman of the
[1:28:02] wives of the sons of the prophets under
[1:28:03] elijah elisha's saying
[1:28:05] thy servant my husband is dead and thou
[1:28:07] knowest that thy servant did fear the
[1:28:09] lord and the creditor is come to take
[1:28:13] unto him my two sons to be bondmen and
[1:28:16] elisha said unto her
[1:28:18] what shall i do for thee tell me what
[1:28:20] hast thou in the house
[1:28:22] and she said
[1:28:24] thine handmaid hath not anything in the
[1:28:26] house save a pot of oil
[1:28:28] then he said go
[1:28:30] borrow the vessels abroad of all thy
[1:28:33] neighbors even empty vessels
[1:28:35] borrow not a few
[1:28:37] verse 4 and when thou art come in
[1:28:40] thou shalt shut the door upon thee and
[1:28:42] upon thy sons and shalt pour out
[1:28:44] into all those vessels and thou shalt
[1:28:47] set aside that which is full so she went
[1:28:50] from him and shut the door open as she
[1:28:53] shut the door upon her and upon her sons
[1:28:56] and brought the vessels to her
[1:28:58] and who brought the vessels to her and
[1:29:00] she poured out and it came to pass when
[1:29:03] the vessels were full that she said unto
[1:29:05] her son bring me yet a vessel and he
[1:29:07] said unto her there is not a vessel more
[1:29:10] and the oil stayed then she came and
[1:29:12] told the man of god and he said go sell
[1:29:15] the oil and pay thy debt and live thou
[1:29:17] and thy children of the rest
[1:29:20] you see friends that remember remember
[1:29:23] that
[1:29:24] it's obvious that the creditor here is a
[1:29:26] type of satan because he's trying to
[1:29:28] make these sons of israel bond servants
[1:29:31] and we read in our text that's illegal
[1:29:34] that that that that her
[1:29:36] to make her sons who were children of of
[1:29:39] abraham bond servants was illegal a jew
[1:29:42] could not be a bond servant only a hired
[1:29:45] servant to work off a debt so it proved
[1:29:48] that it was satan trying to take away
[1:29:50] the opportunity of eternal life so
[1:29:52] elijah what is elijah going to do
[1:29:54] he's going to show her how to create oil
[1:29:57] a type of the holy ghost i'm here to
[1:29:59] tell you i don't care what what debt you
[1:30:01] find maybe you find your children
[1:30:04] somewhere under the grip of the enemy
[1:30:06] and you say the devil says i got him
[1:30:08] brother brad don't you worry he can't
[1:30:11] keep her because she can't be a bond
[1:30:13] servant
[1:30:15] she's a child of god sister melissa
[1:30:17] don't you worry she's a she's a child of
[1:30:21] god all of them
[1:30:23] don't you worry sister don't you worry
[1:30:26] brother
[1:30:27] this is a lie of the devil we're in
[1:30:29] jubilee
[1:30:31] we have authority over him
[1:30:35] we have a token
[1:30:38] hallelujah glory to god
[1:30:43] [Applause]
[1:30:48] amen
[1:30:52] spurgeon prayed a
[1:30:54] very sincere prayer
[1:30:57] in his memoirs he
[1:31:00] unfortunately
[1:31:02] in 1887 he said in a prayer we thank
[1:31:06] thee once more
[1:31:07] that thou what is by some means this is
[1:31:09] a time of war facing europe
[1:31:14] it says cause peace to be reestablished
[1:31:16] throughout the earth he's praying asking
[1:31:18] god to grant it grant that this nation
[1:31:20] this will be england
[1:31:22] granted this nation may not be drawn
[1:31:24] into war
[1:31:26] we have been foolish once over at grant
[1:31:28] that we may not be so again but oh
[1:31:31] let thy kingdom come without the use of
[1:31:33] the sword oh angel of war
[1:31:35] will thou not rest all sort of the lord
[1:31:37] put thyself into thy scabbard
[1:31:40] and be still
[1:31:42] for the sake of the great prince of
[1:31:44] peace we ask it amen
[1:31:49] very noble prayer
[1:31:55] we are to pray for the peace of
[1:31:56] jerusalem there's nothing wrong with
[1:31:58] praying for peace
[1:32:01] i'm praying for peace for all of god's
[1:32:03] family even in a war conflict right now
[1:32:05] in a war zone right now listen friends
[1:32:08] right now
[1:32:09] brothers and sisters to us in christ who
[1:32:11] hold this message dear
[1:32:13] who have the books in their language
[1:32:16] and believe god sent a prophet like we
[1:32:18] have been privileged to have in this
[1:32:19] land for decades and decades and decades
[1:32:23] and they had to hide it in secret false
[1:32:26] walls i've seen where they used to hide
[1:32:28] their books and they had a wall that
[1:32:29] looked just like a wall but the kgb
[1:32:31] didn't know right behind the wall was a
[1:32:33] typewriter where
[1:32:35] brother nikolai has
[1:32:36] got a a hard typewriter and he's trying
[1:32:39] to translate in the message into russian
[1:32:42] and he he's doing five pages at a time
[1:32:45] and so he's got to take his finger and
[1:32:47] jam the button pow
[1:32:49] a
[1:32:50] pow m pow
[1:32:54] just to say amen
[1:32:57] so that it sort of go through five pages
[1:32:59] and copy
[1:33:00] and make five five copies and he's got
[1:33:02] ribbons in between it all and he's gotta
[1:33:04] smack it
[1:33:06] and and you know and he's got to try to
[1:33:08] use instruments and this is what they
[1:33:10] did
[1:33:11] just to spend months getting one book
[1:33:16] back in soviet days
[1:33:18] hiding behind false walls
[1:33:20] pounding out five pages at a time to try
[1:33:22] to secretly pass it get arrested you're
[1:33:23] going to the gulag
[1:33:25] and he was raided more than one time
[1:33:27] they never found his false wall
[1:33:30] i saw it kgb never got to see it
[1:33:34] why because i was in the family of god
[1:33:36] amen
[1:33:38] you know they
[1:33:39] brothers that went behind
[1:33:41] enemy lines through poland and through
[1:33:43] east germany
[1:33:45] and took this message in peril over
[1:33:46] their lives and sometimes caught and
[1:33:48] sometimes jailed
[1:33:51] jailed in asia and different parts of
[1:33:53] the world today fighting and right now
[1:33:56] they're fighting and
[1:33:58] this is a noble prayer that spurgeon is
[1:34:00] praying but it can't be granted because
[1:34:02] first of all jesus had said there be
[1:34:04] wars and rumors of wars and nations rise
[1:34:06] against nation
[1:34:07] but remember
[1:34:10] but remember that
[1:34:12] that the woes
[1:34:14] that that
[1:34:15] that you begin to catch up on in
[1:34:17] revelation 7
[1:34:19] the woe one
[1:34:20] first world second with third woe first
[1:34:22] world war second world war armageddon
[1:34:25] that once that starts that that's just
[1:34:27] gonna keep going and the only thing that
[1:34:29] even holds it temporarily is an
[1:34:30] injunction by the angel who rose out of
[1:34:33] the east with the seal the living god
[1:34:35] showed it was christ of course because
[1:34:37] he's the only one who has the seal
[1:34:39] and
[1:34:40] and and you've got to wait till i
[1:34:41] brother branham said an interval of time
[1:34:43] to seal 144 000 jews under the trumpets
[1:34:47] but under the seals he's got a seal of
[1:34:49] gentile pride call her out of a church
[1:34:51] send a prophet sneak a prophet down
[1:34:53] nobody even believes he's a prophet call
[1:34:55] a bride who hears an eagle scream
[1:34:58] oh my something it it's a deep calling
[1:35:01] to a deep and what did we do we left
[1:35:03] churches and families and denominations
[1:35:06] and we became outcasts why because it
[1:35:08] was a jubilee
[1:35:10] because something about it spoke about
[1:35:12] freedom and i can be a real christian
[1:35:14] and i can have the real power of god in
[1:35:16] my life
[1:35:20] see so
[1:35:21] i mean that that's not just nation
[1:35:22] rising its nation now it's global
[1:35:26] world war what you're seeing happening
[1:35:28] right now
[1:35:30] is is precursors to armageddon it's
[1:35:33] global war
[1:35:34] and we could always think man we should
[1:35:36] then be gone well we're not
[1:35:40] say well before the first bomb falls
[1:35:43] well qualify that to the brothers and
[1:35:45] sisters who are getting bombed right now
[1:35:48] i get that brother branham's intimation
[1:35:50] was it was intimating nuclear bomb and i
[1:35:53] certainly believe that before that
[1:35:54] happens the bride will be gone
[1:35:56] but you know something i i said to some
[1:35:58] brothers i was
[1:35:59] i was talking to the other day in a chat
[1:36:01] and i said hey
[1:36:03] i said whoever said
[1:36:05] that the third pull and the power of
[1:36:07] missing limbs if necessary had to start
[1:36:09] in america i said i won't surprise me at
[1:36:12] all if we start hearing testimonies and
[1:36:14] stories coming out of our brothers and
[1:36:16] sisters over there i'm here to tell you
[1:36:18] friends the move is on
[1:36:21] and this bride is almost out of here

[1:36:26] get the holy ghost in your life
[1:36:28] these things are transitioning rapidly
[1:36:30] and it can't stop until it's over it
[1:36:32] goes to the consummation of the ages
[1:36:36] amen i read you a quick testimony
[1:36:42] i sure want to thank the lord for giving
[1:36:44] me strength today i've powered through
[1:36:46] this and

[1:37:06] sisters on both sides

[1:37:49] lines

[1:37:53] taking care of his family and to this
[1:37:55] moment i've been monitoring it closely
