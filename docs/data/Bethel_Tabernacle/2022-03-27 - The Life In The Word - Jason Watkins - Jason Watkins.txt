========================================

gap and daniel's seen the first peak of the messiah prince and then he sees the second coming of that messiah when jesus comes back what daniel doesn't see is that in between the first coming of the messiah and the second coming there's a gap and that gap is called seven church ages and you live in that gap and daniel doesn't see any all daniel knows this here comes the lord and then here comes the king and he calls him the kingdom the age of the kingdom the kingdom is coming and daniel doesn't see the kingdom is coming but first there's got to be you there's got to be me there's got to be an entire gentile dispensation to give to give us salvation to give my family and your family and your children and their children a chance i'm think thank god god's got it all in control and it's and nothing is happening that god hasn't already foreordained to happen before time let's all stand we're out of time lord we thank you for this morning's teaching i pray god that it would inspire us lord not to just ask questions questions are good lord but you've given us so many answers some lord that weeks questions that we won't have answers to and that's okay but you didn't intend for us just to go through life and these events and these things that transpire and to live in fear and what about this and what about that lord you've not you you've said it and lord in the book of matthew you'll hear about wars and rumors of wars but then you followed that up and said but but don't be troubled don't be troubled when you hear about these things for the end is not yet we're thankful lord god

the night and lord now here we are gathered in the house of the lord lord and it's just a beautiful thing to behold to see the faces of the believers lord ready now to move on into the anointed word and father we have a presentation we want to bring to the church and there's been so much thought now put into it but where we know lord that it needs an anointing from you lord for the people to catch the same anointing and the same vision father we want to be all on the same page so we're asking that of thee this morning that you'll give our brother lord liberty to open his heart lord and speak to the people we commit it to you in jesus name god bless you friends you can be seated praise the lord god bless you brother good to have you here today amen different ones of you so uh we've been working on this for quite a while and brother kinney has really spent a lot of time um first he had to really digest and assimilate the vision that that i had and to try to really understand what we're moving toward and you know he's then then of course there's the preparation on how to communicate that to you because i think you want to know and i think that knowing is helpful and so i want you to give brother ken your undivided attention he's heading up our fundraising activities and our plans and ideas and it's still moving on you know we're always open to other ideas and we're not saying today that we're putting a period behind anything you're going to hear we're always open to good ideas continuing so i wanted us to ask you to give brother ken your undivided attention and he's going to take just a little bit and then we will start up the worship service straight away after that did you enjoy the sunday school class hey man i was enjoying it listening in the back praise god brother kenny come my brother and he'll just use this guys hey man is this the clicker i'm not sure how you use this all right good morning bethel family how's everyone this morning first of all i'd like to just say uh no questions brother jason specified that to keep the time under control if you have questions feel free to talk to me or brother jason or brother matt anytime after this we're going to try to keep this before you so there's going to be meetings mate or you know presentations maybe every few weeks keep everybody updated on how we're moving forward um so i just want to start by saying you know brother matt and brother jason have presented to the church their vision for the church moving forward talking about beautifying the church and possibly adding on to the church and i'm up here today to explain a little more about the direction moving forward as we fell out of the lord our building project started with the vision our ministry team has for the future of bethel tabernacle today we're going to talk about taking ownership of that vision so i just wanted to i presented made this presentation i'm not really a formal speaker at all and you're going to find that out over the course of the next 15 or 20 minutes i don't know which button to push here brother jason to go forward i see so i'm just i i copied and pasted a few of these pictures of the church that brother steve put together for us and i wanted to present these for us and then um move into the slide show that i created i'm taking ownership of the vision and scripture says in proverbs 29 18 that without where there is no vision the people will perish well brother jason and brother matt have definitely got a vision for our church moving forward and they've tasked me and asked me to help create and facilitate this fundraising drive because of my experience doing that up in toledo and michigan area with brother paul and that was years ago since we relocated here to buffer years ago the brothers there in ohio and michigan they carried on with brother paul's vision and if you ask brother jason the lord has really blessed the church up there a member of the jason they have quite a facility of quite a church building and grounds there and not comparing ourselves to that but i just want to remind everyone if you have seen what they have going on up there with their building and their facility if you've watched any of their services online we serve the same god amen and we just we can't put past what god can do for us so i'd like to start off with the mission of the church so go go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father son and of the holy ghost and we know that by revelation of the hour that that means in the name of the lord jesus christ teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always and even unto the end of the world so basically he's commanding us to go find the gene seed of god baptize them teach them to be like jesus and lead them to the baptism of the holy ghost when i asked brother jason what was his vision for the church and how you know as it relates to the great commission and and then preparing us as the bride of christ for the rapture so he's he uh his vision really astounded me but jason said you know and after i sent the text he said brother ken i really want to take some time to think this through because i don't want to give just a short answer i want the people really to catch what uh what my heart is and what the lord's given me and so this is what he sent me he said i have always envisioned a church as a vibrant base from which to work constantly for the master an assembly that is not merely another church on the corner instead one with an atmosphere pulsating with faith and activity 365 days a year not a mere meeting house a couple of times a week i think we all can agree that we're definitely not just a a meeting house a couple times a week or you know merely just another church on the corner and that we definitely create an atmosphere pulsating with faith and activity by the grace of god okay he said i see it as a place for gathering the family of god around the feast of the word fostering and fostering and propagating the work of the kingdom in every possible way a place where spiritual vision thrives and inspiration is multiplied in the hearts and minds of the saints who gather there so let's look at fostering and gathering that means nurturing encouraging and further spreading and growing so here we are trying to foster and propagate the kingdom of god in our hearts among one another but also projecting it to others amen a place where spiritual vision thrives i just said wow and how are you a church this is a question how are you thriving in the spiritual vision for the church and i want all of you to think about that as we go through this presentation all my life being raised in message ranks i have observed that the assemblies god blesses the most are those who constantly lift their eyes to the field of war of the world and have missions work on the forefront of their agenda bethel tabernacles should have a leading purpose to go or send someone and through the years we've done that saints of god we've always supported missions work overseas since i've been here i can testify to that as such we need an efficient facility maximizing every gift and office of the ministry and among the saints for foreign missions and local evangelism i'm going to read that again as such we need an efficient facility maximizing every gift and office of the ministry and among the saints of foreign missions and local evangelism that's powerful you know brother branham says he when he talks about the bride that they'll be sighing and crying for the lost are we doing that i just want to i just want to remember remind everybody that this is really important saints that's part of the great commission that's what we're here for we're here to be effective witnesses not just witnesses but effective witnesses we can be good witnesses with our with our words but if we're not living what we are saying the people won't catch it it's like you know if brother jason brother matt brother j.d you know brother any of these other ministers they get up and then they preach the word but then they go live in any old way we're not going to follow what they're teaching we're not going to catch that vision it'll be an intellectual you know knowledge we're gaining i envision a church as a place where people and families can come together to worship in spirit and truth and find the healing strength and confidence to be part of something larger than themselves serving an eternal purpose until the master calls us home it will be worth every effort all for one one for all a family of god isn't that beautiful being part of something larger than ourselves and serving an eternal purpose oh amen that's what i want so it's obvious that the ministry is laying a foundation of the vision of the church of today and tomorrow so our our us here today and then the youngins as they come up we've got uh we've all got to take part of this vision and take ownership of it parents you're doing you know you're doing this for your children and your grandchildren young adults and children this is for you this vision that brother jason has isn't just for us as a you know for a now this is for if the lord tarries we move forward so god's already raising up young preachers to carry this ministry up right here among us we got you know brother caleb brother matthew smith he's raising up you knew young musicians and singers we got brother mason on the drums brother enoch he's quite a singer amen and some of you other young people are and children are going to you know possibly be future trustees deacons wives of pastors sunday school teachers musicians all that church can you see the vision can you see yourself in this vision well i sure wish this was you up here brother george brother george is a much better uh speaker as far as presentations go amen so i believe with all my heart let me change this each of us must personally catch trust and agree with and operate in the vision of our pastor this is taking ownership of the vision you believe it all right so we are a body and as part of the body we all have a purpose we all must do something to be part of that vision we all can't be hands we all can't be feet and arms and legs we all are our separate part of that body and we all have a purpose i'm asking you this morning to think about what part you play what do you see yourself as in this vision so what is your vision of the church saints the rapture amen mine too ultimately amen we're all looking forward to that but we must keep planting potatoes and we should live like it's you know going to be tomorrow it left amen the rapture we should live like it's going to be tomorrow but playing like it's going to be a hundred years from now amen we also need to envision spiritual growth for all of us for each one of us as individuals to pray praying that we'll draw closer to the lord okay the low country and growth from new souls can you say amen i know brother i don't think brother rowan's here but i sure would love to see about 20 or 30 more brother rowan's walk in those doors amen and just catch the the revelation of what god is doing right now i want everyone to look around we have a nice group of young families here with young children that will be teens in a blink of an eye trust me on that men are all grown up now i have you know three grandchildren and hopefully more if the lord tarries i want you to think of this you know we have a nice group of of single young adults here right now that are of marrying age but i don't want any of you to get any ideas about leaving once you're married right brother right dads right moms y'all can't leave you all got to stay here you got we've already signed contracts with parents so right brother jason contracts are all signed we got him in the back office we can show you after service amen so you know recently over the last four or five years we've had some growth from saints that have relocated um and i and i'm thinking about it you know i wanted to try something i know the whole church isn't here right now and plenty of the ones that have relocated aren't even here right now but i'd like to ask for those of you who that have the lord has brought you here in the last 12 months i'd like you to stand up in the last 12 months okay we're going to get to you in the last 12 months stand up come on there you go jackson all right is that it for 12 months i think there's a couple more at least one more bro brother rowan's not here okay keep standing and in the last in the last two years nope keep standing that's part of it keep standing in the last two years if the lord brought you here stand up that goes for y'all too three years even if you were here before and you came back in the last three years brother matthew [Music] see brother matthew he left us for a while but he got home sick amen he went to new mexico and the lord had something for him to do here because he's part of this body he had to he had to first he had to get his uh his little his rib there amen all right four years if the lord's brought you here in the last four years stand up all right how about five okay so in the last five years the lord has brought about half of our church here what happens if the lord tarries another year or two i mean on a regular sunday if everyone's here there's not enough room for everyone to sit as it is so you can see how this is all playing into the vision that brother brother jason brother matt have been talking about you can have your seats we have some amazing additions that the lord has brought to to make our church more complete we've brought some additional members to our worship team and great gifted singers here amen some additions to our ministry team we got brother jd and his sister amy here helping in that area amen let's see oh we can't forget brother brad and sister sarah amen we've got uh trustees and i texted brother mark and brother george and asked them how long they've been here it's been seven years already wow how time flies we've got deacon brother brother uh luther in the back there how long you been here brother luther [Music] it seems it seems like yesterday that brother luther got here amen we've got our young people taken over the booth for us that's growth within our own church that these brothers probably won't leave they'll be here and they'll have families just some examples of what god's doing how many prayer warriors god relocated here with us amongst you i'm not just mentioning the ones that are visual because god has body parts that can't be seen amen remember also brother jason talk to us about two or three more families that are planning to move here and join our assembly in the next few months in the coming months and one of those families has 10 believers amen and i've talked to other believers that go to this assembly and said rumor has it there are other families that are planning to move here and praying that the lord show them if this is where he wants them so where could we be in just a matter of three or four months not to mention a year or two or three or four if the lord tarries i want to talk about the visitors how many visitors we got here you won't have to stand up just raise your hand okay we got three four five and brother larry and y'all aren't really you're really not a visitor yeah but we got we got we got three visitors here this morning and that's probably getting too close to about average three to four visitors a week on sundays and that's wonderful but what happens if if we get out there and do the evangelizing of the low country how many more visitors will we have a week and isn't that the ultimate goal to bring people in here so that they can be watered if they're a seed of god amen that's where the vision's going saints some of the believers that are are visiting here they may even be from other churches that are in the message but they're just praying that the lord would god stir in their hearts maybe to make some changes like brother brad and sister sarah most recently god would stern in their hearts to to to to make some changes god was leading them here but when they you know but when the some visitors come in and they look on a sunday and they see there's only three seats available in the church and i got six in my family that's a discouragement so i know everybody understands where the part of the vision i'm going towards is that we need more room we need more square footage brother brother matt was talking about beautifying the inside but that also kind of types what god's doing to us he's beautifying us and we're all growing spiritually not just in numbers but as individuals so if you type that with the natural we're beautifying the church we are the church we're being beautified and we're beautifying the church we're growing as individuals as the church of god and i think it's time that this church grows in the natural amen so however you come here as a visitor we want to know that everyone that there's we want the visitors to know that there's room for them and comfortable not we're not piling up on one another amen all right so i'm gonna skip we're just gonna go through a few of these um pictures uh once again brother matt already presented them to us but we're gonna keep these in the forefront of our mind because this is um what we'd like to see the church become who wouldn't who doesn't want to see that raise your hand who doesn't want to see that all right so see you all you all are on board all right in such such i just want to say thanks again brother steve for the all the time and energy he's put into putting these things together plans are about ready so that we can get uh send them out to the contractors and get them uh get them to do some bids for us accurate bids so we can start looking at what the pricing and cost is going to be so how many so far wants to take ownership of the vision this morning by a show of hands i think there's a few out there that got their hands up brad come on i i'm showing you i'm showing you foreign all right so here i'd like to just share a couple examples of when god's people caught a vision and he had and they took ownership of it here in exodus 35 it actually starts with verse five but we're just going to kind of skip through for time take you from among you and offering unto the lord whosoever is of a willing heart and i highlighted that because your heart has to be willing you can't give begrudgingly or else it doesn't count let him bring it an offering of the lord gold and silver and brass and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen goes on and every wise hearted among you shall come and make all that the lord hath commanded the tabernacle his tent the ark and the staves thereof with the mercy seat and the veil of the covering and they came everyone whose heart stirred him up and everyone whom his spirit made willing and they brought the lord's offering to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation and for all his service the children of israel brought a willing offering unto the lord every man not some men every man and woman whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work which the lord had commanded to be made by the hand of moses and then if we go a little bit further this is still the same situation this is being read in niv in exodus 36 then moses summoned every skilled person whom the lord had given ability and who was willing to come and do the work they received from moses all the offerings israelites had brought to carry out the work of construction in the sanctuary and the people continued to bring free will offerings morning and morning morning after morning free will so all the skilled workers who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left what they were doing and moses said the people are bringing more than enough for doing the work of the lord commanded to be done then moses gave an order and they sent his word throughout the camp no man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary and so the people were restrained from being from bringing more because they were they already had was more than enough to do all the work we serve the same god so if we get behind this as a family and push into this vision it's going to require some sacrifice but i don't we don't want to overburden the church i can't emphasize that enough it will require some sacrifice of time a little bit of your finances probably but if we're going to move forward for our for our for ourselves for our church for our young for our young people our young adults our young children to make to give them a future should the lord tarry this is what we got to do and just look at what god did for them because they caught the vision god takes a little and turns it into a lot amen so there's something for everyone to do because we're a body and time is always the hardest thing to give because of the the you know it's easy to throw 5 10 20 into the basket so you know for most people but time and that's what we need mostly saints is your time so that we can we can pull together as a team to do these fundraisers that we're getting ready to talk about okay taking ownership of the vision so the first most important thing is pray for god's will to be done for the building fund and the construction project have a willing heart to help that's a must donating items time and energy and you'll understand that donating items a little more as we move into this financial support of course you know there's there's there's three types of of people for that that give there's those that usually will give like one lump sum for their giving there's another group that gives like a smaller amount but it's constant it's in every every month or every week they're giving the same amount and then there's the other ones who give sporadically because they love brother jason and then here so we're going to talk about pledging a regular amount monthly towards the building fund so what that is is what we're going to ask is for you to set aside a specific amount whatever you can afford above over and above your tithe and your offerings that you're already giving if you're already giving money to you know say the the missions field or for offer general offering for the building that we have right now or for the youth group whatever you're giving towards we don't want to quit giving to them we have to be happy givers but we don't want to rob peter to pay paul because that that just doesn't that doesn't help us to reach our goal anything additional that you would give has to be identified as building funder it won't go to that and even if it's only five dollars a month a little is a lot with god behind it so if you can't i don't understand everybody is living under us you know a tight budget right now with the price of everything going up but you know what if this is god's will that brother jason if god and brother jason are communing and then brother jason's sharing what god is communing with him god will make this happen we all we got to do is do our part and if all we can afford god knows our heart if all we can afford is five dollars a month god can turn that five dollars a month into a hundred dollars a month so enjoy your ownership of the vision i want everyone to to be uh enjoy what we're doing and what we're getting ready to move into i don't want it to be like a duty so participate in the fundraising teams encourage one another to actively take ownership of the vision if there's someone that maybe isn't getting involved then i need you know we all need to you know encourage one another hey come on let's do this get out of your comfort zone there's going to be a list of different types of fundraisers that i've come up with but in some of them you may not feel like oh i don't want to do any of those well you got to get out of your comfort zone and then if you have ideas outside of the ones that i present please share them because i'm you know i'm just part of this i'm not all of this everyone needs to work we're a family so here's some of the building fund drives so pop-up stores because impulse purchases are huge so what we were talking about brother jason and i and brother matt were talking about was like you know doing finds i just put a couple ideas up here bake sales t-shirts such stuff like that and we set up little pop-up stores out in front of stores i know many of you have seen this so maybe the sisters and the children and even men that like to bake and can bake i can't want to get together and make a bunch of food items i told brother jason we could set up pop-up stores right outside urban brew urban nest and i'm sure there's other small businesses in the community that would allow us to do that you know if we could make a hundred or you know 50 or 100 or 200 from each stand on a weekend that'd be great so but we need bodies to do that we need willing people willing to buy you know take you from which and maybe you can't give cash to the offering but maybe you're what you're giving is you're putting twenty dollars towards baking items so that the church can sell them and then the profits go towards the building fund and those are just a couple ideas so if you've got other ideas for pop-up stands just talk to us so a yard sale when we lived in ohio this was one of our biggest things that we did and they had a thing called sylvania junk days it was like a really rich neighborhood like hilton head would be and every every month during sylvania junk days they would set their junk which was like brand new stuff out to the road like exercise equipment all kinds of nice stuff in our church we would get four or five pickup trucks with trailers and we would drive around through the neighborhood and load stuff into our trailers and our trucks and we would store them and then we would have a great big yard sale literally we made i don't even remember the thousands amounts of thousands of dollars two three thousand dollars from one event that we did with that so there's things like that that we can do maybe there's not neighbor neighborhoods that we can do like that but we can go to thrift stores we can do different things a lot of our sisters are thrifty instead of buying it for yourself if you see it's it's worth it if it's a good item buy it purchase it bring it bring it and then we we can do a yard sale we can do facebook marketplace was another big one we could we could create a page for the church where we brought and we set up a facebook market uh marketplace and if you like if sister rachel purchased something or any of you purchased something we'll post it on the facebook marketplace but they would pick up at sister h's house so that we don't have a pla we don't have to rent a space to keep everything if that makes sense and these could that would also be for our donated items that we have so instead of us having a garage sale of our own stuff which we accumulate so much stuff we just donate it for the yard sale or for the facebook marketplace a candle sale this is an idea that i got because we make we get these locally made candles that we sell at urban brew and we could make up some sheets and send the people out who want to do it to you know you can either take them with you to work to fill out or school you can take them people can canvas areas of the neighborhood and and sell these candles i told brother jason i'll purchase the candles for through urban brew and then we can you know we can we'll give all the profits to the church you the church will just buy you know pay me back for the the purchase of the candle and whatever we can make on them we can make about 50 profit on those candles so that's just an idea i know in the past when i was with the youth we did car washes a few times more than a few times to raise money for different things we wanted to do with the youth so car washes dog washes for people that like animals if you want to set up dog wash stations here's one a portrait fundraiser we got a few photographers in the church so basically what we do is we we we sell chits to people for ten dollars or whatever that cost would be they go they needed a nice place that we've just we've picked out here in beaufort we take some pictures of them and they for that ten dollars they get one portrait but if they want to buy a package we can sell them a package and then we just we take whatever the cost is and we add a few dollars to it and then whatever the profit is so if we got three photographers or more out there if we're doing this and we get a lot of families that could equate to a lot of money this is one we were talking about yesterday a five or a 10k run um travis and deborah are going to help with that one because they're the the runners in the church um this is something that we could be huge it could be really huge for anybody that's been you know did any of that running if you want to be involved with that just let travis and deb or me know here's something my wife thought of we were actually brainstorming ideas for urban brew to make more money and then when this all came into light of what church was going to do i just said babe what if we just took this and did this for the church instead of for us and she's like you know awesome idea i was thinking the same thing so what this is is a mother-daughter tea we set up urban brew we close it down on a sunday we always close on sundays we and we sell tickets for mother daughters of any age they come in they have like snacks and tea and rachel likes to go to these i've heard so maybe she could help with that and um and you know decorate it nice place nice music and we even talked about maybe bringing in a special speaker of some sort that could minister to mothers and daughters in some way you know form uh fashion that's just another idea i think would be a really a really and if it works and it goes over well we could do that time and time again here's one so the men don't feel left out and we don't really drink tea so we we like fraps so we can do a father-son frap and do something similar and coffee bean sale this is something that i'm kind of working on the backside for urban brew in urban nest purchasing a real large shipment of beans that i could never get rid of on my own and when i purchase them the church can buy some from me as a you know at cost or whatever and then whatever they sell them for same thing as the candles you can go door-to-door we can set up stands whatever it is and uh whatever profit is made the church can we'll split it with the church maybe a concert that be another idea we got so many gifts here why not use them how about put music on spotify i don't know how spotify works but maybe brother matt does i know that the lafontaine's put some music on spotify that could be something we could look into and then if you have any other ideas text me or call me with your ideas of brother jason brother matt not jason probably he's too busy but brother matt and i'll be pretty much heading this up i'm really excited about this vision saints and uh i hope all of you over the coming days and weeks will be in prayer of what god wants to how god wants to use you and then yield to that you know i guess the hardest part about putting all this together was is that i know the finance the financial times are tough but i just want to re-emphasize that we're not asking you to you know to put yourself in dire straits but it's more about giving of your time than your finances and but back to the pledges for those of you that are interested in doing uh a pledge which would mean you know once a month or whatever you're going to cut the church a check that's separate if that's something you're interested in after praying about it i think the best way to handle that would be for you to text brother jason individually privately an amount that you feel like you can you know without hurting yourself or your family or taking from your family an amount that you think you can do is a pledge and they don't have to be no one else is going to know who's involved in it you're just going to send that to brother jason and then it's between you brother jason and the lord what you if you follow through with that or not but if you make that pledge reminds you i want to remind you that you it's we're going to be counting on that so if you can't make a pledge and you'd rather just give individually as you can then that's fine too but for those of you that feel led to want to pledge five dollars a month 10.20 you know whatever it is how many of us go out to eat at least once a week you know if we go

with us amen brother matt good to see you and your wife god bless you brother from saskatchewan i understand praise the lord got a lot of friends up in that province so happy to have you happy to have uh brother larry and sister sherry and we would not count them as visitors that was almost blasphemous man don't ever raise your hand as a visitor amen so uh we're loving seeing them today and all the different ones of you god bless you we're gonna turn into the word today into revelation chapter one amen praise the lord we it's been a a wonderful day already and we've got quite a bit more to go now we had a a nice very nice presentation if you weren't able to get that please go online make sure you catch the archive of that if you weren't here for the entirety of it if you only call it part of it please go back and catch the archive i know sometimes you might have been listening driving and that's that's fine as well but brother kenny covered everything so thoroughly and that was a first because we're our updates won't need to be that involved there'll just be updates but i told brother kenny i don't worry about the time i want you to do a thorough job because that was you never get a second chance to make a first impression so we wanted to really lay out our vision there and i sure appreciate brother ken doing that and so i just want you to know and i let brother anthony know sing worship the lord amen uh we've got some baptisms at the end of the service today so i'll regulate my side of it amen the lord will help me amen i don't ever consider myself long-winded at any rate but uh we'll abbreviate just a little bit today but i have a definite burden i know you're lovers of the word amen so we want to look into the word of god revelation chapter 1 and we're going to read verses 9 through 20. now what i will do is as i will we'll read verse 9 and 10 and then we'll let you be seated and then we'll keep keep reading from there so revelation chapter 1 verse 9. i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet amen father we thank you for your word today now i just committed and give it into your hands completely instruct us lord with what we have need of for today we commit it to you in jesus name amen god bless your friends you can be seated so i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a voice says of a trumpet you know brother branham makes comments when he's doing his study on these chapters in the book of revelation and brother branham picks up this this idea of being in the spirit and it is it is so important to do that because brother branham actually would say before you do anything before you pray before you do anything get in the spirit so i when i read that from a prophet saying that before you do anything get in the spirit then that tells me that it is based upon uh you living in a in a higher realm higher than this natural realm that that's where the word of god is going to flow to you the best and god's going to be able to get behind your life and how many wanting behind your life amen i want god to be able to uh to verify and to vindicate that my direction is is correct that my attitudes are correct that my thinking is correct because this is a day of messed up thinking this is a day of you know perplexing and and the bible talks about perilous time and men's hearts failing for fear and mankind losing the ability to turn between right and wrong and he's heady and he's high-minded i'm going to tell you something friends if we ever needed the mind of christ to be functional in our lives this is the hour and i'm here to tell you that the holy spirit is the most functional uh being in existence but but but when he's working through you and i the problem is not in the holy spirit the logjam's not in the holy ghost the logjam sometimes is in us and our minds and our hearts and our attitudes uh it can be in complex as it can be it can be just somebody cuts you off in traffic and you haven't learned how to control your spirit to not grieve the holy ghost because i'm here to tell you something friends in this hour that we live in i don't think we should be out operating at any moment without the anointing of the holy spirit upon us leading us and guiding us i'm speaking to you today on the life in the word and i heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet now we're not going to turn to it i want them to keep that on the screen right there but in numbers chapter 10 verse 2 they were commanded make thee two trumpets of silver of course silver represents redemption make thee two trumpets of silver of a whole peace shout thou make them so the silver the redemption is made of of one thing both of them are made from one thing and that is the grace of god and he says that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly and for the journeying of the camps now we find that we have two trumpets here and of course we can we're not trying to do this as a bible study today we can correlate that because you have the trumpet of israel that is used to gather them but you also have and here's something the prophet pointed out that we have what we would call the gospel trumpet and it's a gospel trumpet in the ages and that's what john is hearing i heard behind me a voice sounded like a trumpet see and so there's a gospel trumpet in the ages that we hear during the preaching of the word in each age and so two trumpets made from one piece of redemption it's all the grace of god now let's i just wanted to drop that point in i'm going to move on verse 11 saying i'm alpha omega the first and the last what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia and ephesus and smyrna and pergamus thy tyrus sardis philadelphia and laocia verse 12 and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man clothed with the garment down to the foot and gird about the pabst with the golden girl now here is your first in the very first chapter you're going to see it again in chapter 10 you're going to see christ and the imagery of the scripture is christ in his body in the church that's why brother branham would say gird about the paps like a woman would be and so we find that it's christ absolutely that's who john saw one like the son of man and brother branham's and brother branham is showing us that the bible imagery is christ in his church because christ is his body lays on the mercy seat the blood making a perpetual atonement or just reading it this morning fresh house brother branham said that you know sometimes we we get in life and we have different struggles and sometimes we find ourselves in weakness sometimes we stumble yeah amen sometimes we struggle uh to to keep our our life in the past of righteousness does it brother branham said sometimes you'll do wrong said you'll you'll it doesn't mean you're not a son it just means a lot of corrections on the way to which i say praise god hallelujah whatever lord by whatever means necessary i want to make sure that my life is a testament to your life and so brother branham was saying you know sometimes we do we make those mistakes and i probably should pull it up to not butcher it but but it just moved me because brother branham said just remember that he's a faithful high priest he knows what you're going through he knows sometimes temptations can get so strong you almost can't stand it he knows what the sin of the world he knows the influence of the devil and he said that's why he said he sits there at the right hand of the father to intercede on behalf of his family down in the earth i just said blessed be the name of the lord and so he he we see this imagery you see it again in revelation 10 1 so much imagery there in bible imagery that it's that it's christ is fetus pillars of fire and rainbow around around his head and oh my so much so much so we don't want to get sidetracked into that today but but that is as brother branham to use brother branham's words a bright coming of christ see remember the nail scarred man the earth doesn't see until revelation 19. that's the one they're looking for but they will never see that version before the rapture the only version of jesus christ the earth sees before the rapture is in his bride body see they see the nail scarred man in chapter 19 and they're wailing and and it's not a happy moment for them uh but it's it's a glorious thing for us isn't it so he goes on he says he describes in verse uh well let's skip down to verse 17 and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead verse 17 and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and the great hell and of death write the things which thou has seen and the things excuse me which are and the things which shall be hereafter and he goes on to describe the mystery of the stars and the and the and the and the golden candlesticks as being the age of the churches and the messengers to those churches you know i was commenting last night uh how many are still just living off of wednesday night my what a move of the holy spirit what a word that came forth to challenge us and and lift us i'm here to tell you something friends the word of god is the only form of magic that whole stuff with harry potter that's nonsense that's demon demonic stuff i'm here to tell you there is a magic and it's the power of god and it is so powerful it can take human mortals and lift you into an immortal realm it can take people who who come from all walks of life and and brother branham talks about how that you travel you go somewhere in prayer there's a value in pressing into the spirit of god and it takes the word as as the word so much talks about in the bible out of the word he sent forth his word and healed the people so you're you should have no conflict with me if i should say to you there's nothing greater for you there's nothing greater i could give you than the word of god there's no possession you could have greater than a word of god not just a head knowledge not just an accumulation of knowledge but a living word and that means it's an anointed word that means it's a bleeding word that means it's spirit jesus said my words are spirit and life so we we we were rejoicing at the word that he sent his word and healed the people he we're washed clean by the washing of the water of the word the bible says that the word of god is health to all your flesh i mean that's everything that's your that's that's your that's this flesh that's your spirit man i'm here to tell you if you need your imagination healed today if you need your memories healed if you need your affections healed there is a word here that can bring healing inside your physical body and in your mind thank god he hasn't left us thank god we could have a preacher come up here and begin to preach and begin to labor and begin to push and demons start losing their grip and they start heading toward the back door and by the time the preacher's anointed demons are out in the street saying what happened what happened and the people in here are rejoicing under the power of god that's value beyond value there is no greater value that it wouldn't matter what kind of church we build or renovate or remodel or buy in the future whatever we need to do i'm here to tell you i want a place where the power of god moves and the people have an expectation that he lives much deeper than emotion it's much further than that it's a living reality that it's not natural it's super natural you understand that i mean as as a natural man born in sin your mind is enmity against god he could never agree with his word so it it literally takes the holy spirit to reveal himself to you and and i i remember commenting to brother brad in the back i said you know this is we look in prophecy as brother matt was doing such an excellent job today that what i don't know what his title was but i can tell you what you were hearing you're hearing modern events made clear in prophecy and we're not talking about modern events in the 60s but i believe that modern events is a sermon that has to be preached periodically i mean that that's exactly what they were that's what the prophet when when here you got one prophet saying we'll be in there 70 years in captivity here's another one saying oh it's only two years but the true prophet of god went back to the word and interpreted that day's modern event by the prophecy said listen there's been prophets before us and they didn't prophesy there's no nothing in their prophecies to make you think that we're just going to get a two-year slap on the wrist that it's going to be 70 years because we have sinned and forsaken god and and and the prophecies of elijah do not portend happiness for us and so that was a modern event that's why brother brandon when he comes along modern events made clear in prophecy i'm going to tell you something friends we can't emphasize it enough that you see i remember i remember years ago a minister testifying how the lord moved on him that every time a seal was opened and a living creature said come and see and the holy spirit spoke to him said how can my people know me if they can't see me i'll tell you brothers you ministering brothers here it is incumbent upon us to lay in the presence of god and get the fresh kill of the word and bring it to the people because god's family will believe it and eagles will feed on it and we were just commenting on that this is the age we have reached an age here's a modern event made clear in prophecy not merely what's happening in china or north korea or ukraine or europe or the vatican those things are are moving at the at the at the pace of prophecy i was i was saying that yesterday in the men's breakfast and i've been preaching on it that that god moves at the speed of prophecy brother i'm talks about him stopping time speeding up time we've we've ministered on it here many times i don't need to go into it again today but he moves at the speed of prophecy he doesn't move by this he makes this obey this we've talked about that before so so we find that that we've reached an age where it is an age of total victory i want i want to encourage you today you're living in the day where the bride of christ comes to perfect faith where she comes to total victory where she comes to total deliverance where we're coming to that perfect image of god and why should we not have liberty why should we not have freedom in the spirit why should we not have overcoming power i say we should and that's what i want and that's the whole desire of my life the world is is much is far too challenging the the the things that's going on in the world today you hear me friends it's much too challenging to not operate in the spirit i mean you know this gospel that we preach alone we were talking about this yesterday in our fundraising ideas and how that we'll even have to really observe the scripture to be wise as serpents and yet harmless as doves because if there's one thing that's sure about the word of any age it is not pc sensitive to the age it doesn't care at all about political correctness it's not bothered by it's not afraid of cancer culture the word of god has always been straight and just comes forth and i mean why shouldn't it because it comes from god and god isn't subject to man to man's opinions and neither should he be i don't want a god who can be swayed by the popular opinion of mankind across the earth i wanted god to tell me the truth hallelujah friends i'm i'm not here to i get using wisdom i get that believe me i get using wisdom the bible talks about that that a lot of times a lack of wisdom you cut yourself off from being able to help the person at all and it's not even their fault it's your fault and so there is a certain amount of wisdom and and and you know i brother matt was giving me a testimony the other day of the of the gentleman him and brother travis went to see matt said he said i'm going to tell you something if you're going to go to war you're going to want travis jackson with you amen he said that brother is fearless amen he said he doesn't you know he's not even doesn't care who's around he's going to tell what god did for him i'm going to tell you why because it's real and it matters and i like telling you what god has done in my life i like bragging on the power of god i like promising you things that he has promised in his word and i want to encourage you to believe them there is no power like the word of god when it's anointed by the spirit of god see otherwise it can be just a dead letter which is just an accumulation of knowledge and the world impales themselves uh in in the pursuit of just knowledge the accumulation of knowledge they study the bible just to accumulate knowledge my goodness friends you you which what's more important to know the content or to know the author to know this book or to know the author of the book amen and so so we find that that the bible testifies that that knowing god is far more important even than knowing the bible itself and so we find so many so many uh situations where preaching the word of god the way it was intended to be preached can become very politically unco incorrect it can it can make it can cause you to be ostracized by even your blood family it can cause you to to be set aside it can cause you to miss career opportunities it can cause your it can cause your financial outcome to be less than if you went the way of the world that's why brother branham said if you want to be successful if you want to be in you know the business success and and or maybe he said you want to be a lady killer and you want to do all these things he said you better you better forsake this because this will destroy you if you're if that's your goal this will this will wipe you out you'll never be you'll never achieve those those accomplishments but i say i don't want those things i want this life because i know those things are going to pass away this will never pass away and the fruit of this will live on and on and on and i'm here to tell you when all the billionaire and zillionaires and and when they're all gone and the world is on fire i want to be at home in christ i want to know that my life mattered and it's continuing to matter jesus said in saint john 6 oh give me that uh brother josh saint john 6 53 to let's just i'm not going to read it all but he says in saint john 6 53 he talking about something that's politically incorrect jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you so you know i think that i could that i could persuade you today that if you're going to if you're really going to get life if you're going to choose life now you don't have to but if you're going to choose life then pretty much you're going to have to forsake the world because the the whole world is designed and it has one function to destroy you say well that's that's an audacious statement well that's pretty negative well look all i know is is that the same one who's the god of the evil age goes about seeking whom he may devour so you tell me you tell me what the spirit behind behind the world is today he's the god of the age and he goeth about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour he he'll here here's here's the spirit of the age and you know what he does he he seeks to kill and destroy you see so so i don't think i'm out on a limb today to say go the way of the world and you are going the way of destruction go the way of the word and you are going toward life amen there should be no doubt in your mind see he goes on in verse 60 tells how that many therefore of his disciples when they heard this said that's a hard saying who can hear it verse 63 here's jesus response it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing i mean he didn't even say prophets little he said it prophets nothing the word the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so now he's not mincing words that that that the flesh the the way of the world it's just like in the bible where it talks about how that you you can see that the difference between isaac and ishmael and the bible records i think the king james uses the word uh flesh that our desire i think it uses the word desire that ishmael was a product of the desire of the flesh of abraham but isaac was a product of the word of the promise i think that it uses the word promise so so you've got two boys you've got two human beings in the earth and one of them is is has been manufactured by the promise in the word and the other has been manufactured at just the desire the human fleshly desires of a man who took a woman and she got pregnant and had a child and and now you just correlate that over into the spirit then why the spiritual why would you want a man made after the desires of flesh that's what denominationalism is it's just man-made why would you choose that people say oh you're you're outcast you're a little cold i say my goodness if i'm that then what are you because i'm a part of the kingdom of god so where does that leave you i'll tell you where it leaves you leaves them and leaves them on the outside looking in it is the spirit that quickeneth flesh profit is nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life the word of god has power in it the preached word i've i've stood you know and and it can it comes in many different ways i've we've seen people stand here in front of this altar or this platform and we've laid hands and we've prayed for them we've anointed with oil some we have some we haven't some we laid hands on some we didn't some we just made a mass prayer you know but we've seen god move we've seen god heal we've seen god liberate and restore i've seen people come to christ with the baptism of the holy ghost with with no prayer at all just preaching like the house of cornelius the bible says while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on him i want to tell you something friends i've been in services where that has happened and i've had testimony come back we've made we made no altar called no prayer line prayed for no one all we did was preach the word and people believed it and people rose up to their feet delivered of complexes and fears and depression and suicide demons and young people been filled with the holy ghost and people have been healed in their bodies we've seen that happen amen it just happened recently i just got a testimony back from a brother i won't say who but he he said he had a family member uh in lima where brother diggs and i were ministering just recently with brother paul lafontaine and there was a apparently a young woman who was a family member who had been a defector from the message and had backslid which they all do as soon as they leave it they end up backsliding and and sure enough true to form she she got a critical spirit she started backsliding went into the world and she heard brother paul was running special meetings and something pricked her heart to go and she'd come in sunday morning and she heard me ministering oh you know what's it what you wanna you wanna hear something amazing i was ministering on quantum mechanics i was ministering on quantum entanglement which is which is that that's that's god's creative connectivity of that's why brother branham would say all nature runs in continuity see that's because scientists don't understand that i needed a hillbilly prophet to understand it they they have a hard time even explaining it themselves they admit that it's hard to explain it's a concept you know because it's hard to explain how you take two entangled particles and and send them in different directions hundreds of light years apart but because they're entangled they have they they keep a constant connection and when one is observed its position this one will immediately snap into that position and they'll do that and i and i was talking about the sympathy uh sympathetic resonance i've preached on it here before and how that god it doesn't matter that he's in heaven and that i'm in earth i'm in sympathy with the holy spirit and when the holy s like the wheel within the middle of the wheels and when one went forward they all went forward and when one lifted up they all lifted up and i said god moves from heaven and we move on the earth and whatever the father does that's what we do and that young woman saw that and came to her senses and repented and wrote to her family said i'm a believer hallelujah hallelujah friends at what at the preaching of the word of god they said when the world happened to you she said i went to a service and i heard a sermon and when he got there talking about sympathetic resonance and he explained it that way said i never thought of it like that she said i realized that's a deep call to a deep that's god moving in my life see so don't ever give up friends don't write people off let's let god determine that the word as long as we're still here there's still a chance hallelujah then let's double our effort to be the living word let's double our effort to preach it without fear let's double our effort to call the spirit of god down in our services hallelujah bring him with you when you come amen the bible talks about people who are fools and slow of heart to believe everything that god has done and jesus used that sometimes even to speak to his own his own children cleopas and his companions on the road to emmaus got that rebuke they weren't the only ones jesus said you know he would just just say it in different ways he said you know here's the word of god in which you think you have eternal life and actually it testifies of me and so you have no problem seeing the written version but it's the living version you gotta you're stuck on see and and and jesus would say because they already had a faith in this but he said unless you believe that i am he you'll die in your sins see now that's another step that's asking someone to go beyond the natural to go beyond human uh constraint and that now you're starting to get to perfect faith now you're starting to get to total deliverance because i believe we've arrived at the age of total deliverance but sometimes people can be very foolish very slow of heart to believe everything that god has done we find you know here in the last day where i don't know it's it's kind of like man believes that he's his own highest achievement please and and you know he he chase you say well you know what are you going to base that on well the fact that he he continually chases after his own pleasure and happiness and disregards this that this is the true pursuit of happiness and so you know he he never he never ends up realizing that that he's just a tiny speck on a tiny little ball in an incomprehensibly large universe just a little tiny just a little tiny speck on a little tiny ball hanging in an in incomprehensible and it's incomprehensible how large and how vast the universe is you remember i i showed the that latest nasa um or it was actually a news it was uh i think it was a abc news interviewing nasa and they were talking about the hubble telescope just what it could see now they've released is it the web from from the scientist yeah and and now they're saying that's going to be like a hundred times more powerful and just with the hubble just with the hubble which is now ain't old tech they were able to see that there are more galaxies no one's not talking about planets and stars a galaxy contains millions each each galaxy the milky way is a small galaxy that they could that the hubble could identify and prove that there are more galaxies in the universe then are contained in all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the earth and the and you remember you saw it with me i played it here 15 minutes something another and the reporter said more than more than the grains of sand on a beach and he said more than all the beaches more than all the grains of sand on all the beaches they can see more galaxies than that our future is bright our future is bright i'll tell you some friends we're headed somewhere and i just say oh good he got a goody lord let's get on with it all but but i don't want a shortcut i want to finish my mission how many want to finish our mission say what is my mission to come to perfect deliverance to come to total faith perfect faith total deliverance to see a bride in his very image oh my trying to comprehend a god that can't begin to fathom and how that this great being offered mankind everything and he spurned it and the bible says in their wisdom they became fools all their fame i i remember commenting on this in the services i've been preaching so out so much that and it just keeps resounding in my in my spirit especially relevant to young people because you can take famous people and philosophers and people who have achieved great accomplishments i mean i'm glad there was a thomas edison i'm glad we got lights you understand i'm i'm glad for the automobile i'm i'm glad for the jet airplane i'm glad for these things but you know the thing about it is there's been millions of great people like that who left a great heritage that you and i enjoy and yet today they don't necessarily enjoy it unless they ever at one time committed their heart to the lord jesus christ and allowed a supernatural new birth to take place they're you're enjoying their heritage but their heritage for them is zero they get no benefit of it today because we can see in history that although they knew the word of god they they railed against it they said he wasn't real they spent their whole life trying to disprove it and i just say then no wonder the word would call you a fool you don't realize you're a tiny speck on a tiny ball in a vast universe and there's a great being who put all of this thing in prophet said he rolled it off his hand oh my friends you know we we find that all of their accomplishments how very sad for them because they they gain no value of it what value is there no matter how good no matter how good an accomplishment that you or i might make what value is it if it's not eternal because it's not eternal has to end i don't care how valuable you think it is it's going to end see and so so so we realized then that that that it's you know uh if it's not eternal then it is a it is a joy that must end in sadness because it'll have eventual loss now i get that i mean even true love always ends in loss it has to many of you today here have experienced the loss of loved ones true love always ends in loss it's it's always going to there's never a way that true love is not going to end in sad loss but then to say well then fine then i just won't love then if you don't love you don't live see so aren't you glad there's a heaven aren't you glad there's an eternal life aren't you glad brother branham said it like this and it sounds crazy aren't you glad there's something called death that can take us out of this pest house and put us in another world oh my where every day is the glory of god and there's no more anxiety and stress and sickness and pain and sorrow and parting it's all hallelujah i'm living for that hour friends i've got my whole life dedicated to that hour to that very moment where on the other side death is done away with forever separation and the the certainty of all good things coming to an end is done away with forever isaiah prophesies and here's here's material that brother branham was able to correlate to our modern day arise and shine isaiah 60 josh isaiah 60 verses 1 and 2 arise shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee now it well i'm not going to take the time to do it today but if you if you just go up into into the chapter right before into chapter 59 you'll read about the condition of the world at the dawning of this time when you uh when when isaiah 60 one and two comes to pass and it has and we're we're in it we're in this fulfillment darkness over the earth and gross darkness over the people we're here it's happened you've arrived amen and there there there there's not an another one it's not going to get better there's not another cycle you're in the last one you're not got another revival coming to combat it you've got your revival to combat it after this it's an exodus wow and and when you go into chapter 59 you want to go home today and read it you'll be amazed at how how perfectly in line the 59th chapter is with the conditions we have in the world today yeah brother matt could have just took isaiah 59 and preached on modern events made clear prophecy and correlated everything right back to it and and i'm not going to take the time to do it i'm really out of time now but i i just want to press on just a little bit more but we find that it's going to show the condition of the age at the time of isaiah 60 because the the the beauty of isaiah 60 is that it calls forth a bride to become a perfection of christ to come into his very image to be the measured perfection of christ the tabernacle of the living god you know it's we would never know one great commentator made this statement we would never know the mind of god until we learn to know the voice of god and i thought about that for quite a bit and and he was actually he was actually you you you could see in his uh in his devotional that he's he's believing that there's got to come something more he can see the trouble within his own movement he can see that that revival of azusa hasn't quite it it seems to have stalled it seems to have gone off track and and and this this great leader among them was very troubled over it and he starts forecasting you can recon you can read it almost like reading between the lines you can see the longing of his heart to say you know i believe that there's got to come something i all hope is not not lost there's there's got to come something there's got to come a revival and he's and he says because we would never know the mind of god until we until we learn to know the voice of god and this is what god has provided for us he wasn't wrong he wasn't wrong god did exactly that has provided us a voice in this last day you know it here here's something that a lot of people miss is that jesus you know in one in one way he would say i've told you all things and i've withheld nothing and that same jesus would would look him in the eye at another time and go now what i do now you don't know but you'll know after see because the holy ghost will come he the holy ghost and when he comes he'll remind you he'll lead you and guide you into all truth and he'll remind you of what i'm saying now and you might forget it and then the bible sure enough it follows suit that the by the the here they go into a situation and the bible says and they remembered oh yeah that's what he no that's what he meant now we see it and you know what did that unfolding manifestation it wasn't that jesus needed to come back and preach more doctrine you understand what he preached was spirit and life and it was going to come into material and that's why you need the spirit of god upon your life not an eighth messenger you understand we don't need another super we're not even supposed to chase supers and and the bride gets let us let off the trap i've raised up in this message and my whole life i've seen one off left of center camp and another one and another one another i'm going what is wrong with you people that why why why why why are you what is in you or a better question is what's missing that you're always chasing after something like that the next greatest minister the next greatest camp the next greatest revelation the next greatest this the next greatest thing i'm here to tell you something friends it's all for one and one for all the ground is level at the foot of calvary and god is not a respecter of persons and you don't need you don't need me or another man you need christ to make his word alive inside your life lift you up above the shadows and set you on a higher plane this is what we're desiring friends this is what this is the life that is in the word this is what i'm pouring out my heart to you today it's it's there's life in the word of god but it's not accumulating knowledge and it's not just a it's not just the running wild of emotions but it's something real that has a balance to it and it seeks to know him in the power of his resurrection being in fellowship with his sufferings made conformable unto his death see and so it would take the holy spirit in the lives of the apostles to bring his teaching word into a form of manifested life and so therefore it's very very vital today for that exact reason it's vital today that we have an open book that would that we have a restored word that we have a mighty god unveiled unsealed because when when when christ was unsealed under the opening of the seventh seal it also unsealed the bride it when he was unveiled it unveiled her and i there's not a lot of quotes i could read to you today but i'm i i don't even know if i'm going to show them i uh i might run through them quickly but but we find that that it takes the holy spirit to do this brother branham describes it like this and this is a mashup of teaching from a couple of different sermons and i i probably i probably better at least give you a couple of quotes anyway today take that down brother josh and give me my powerpoint just so that just so that i can establish what i'm saying on a prophet's message because let me let me make this point too because i don't have this one in quotes but this is also something the prophet taught how that i don't remember it seemed like it's one of his easter seal sermons i don't remember which one and even that may stand correction but i'm pretty sure it was in one of them where brother branham describes something as sealed and he says now when when something is sealed he says it has something sealed up on the inside see now he's he's talking about the word of god coming forth all right the word for this hour and you're going to see that in these quotes in just a minute the word for this hour and what did it come to do what what was the opening of the seals you think oh that was just some just some by interpretation of of the book of revelation and all we did was translate some some apocalyptic symbols and told you what the red dragon was and who the mighty angel was my goodness friends it is so much more than that it's why the book of revelation is the bride's book i mean yet paul you don't see paul quoting from the book of revelation why he's already gone by the time john comes back with it there there's no there's no teaching on it at all it was it was reserved for the last day when a prophet would take it up and start with the revelation of jesus christ that's where he began that's where everything must begin the revelation of jesus christ that's not just knowledge that's the person of christ coming into you and that is the revelation that's how you know him because he's become one with you you've become one with him and brother brenham describes it in this way how that when the seal is broken it releases what's on the inside now when the seals broke what it released was his full word back to the church but now watch it's not just doctrine brother branham said then down comes an anointing upon that word to make it live inside your lives you see what i'm saying friends so it's not just the accumulation of knowledge word and neither is it the neither is it the exercise of frolic and emotions in a church service it's the word is spirit and life and it's received with people who love god and are willing to have the word of god sown into their life and become the image of the word and god moves in a living way among the people and it changes lives it makes teenagers live holy and dress holy it makes marriages come out of disorder into order it causes ministry to have signs following and an evident fruit of the ministry it produces something in your lives see that anointing that to make it live and you're going to see here the anointing is clearly it's a it's a person i'll just tip you off the anointing is not a fuzzy feeling it's a person all right watch oh let me turn on life in the word the anointing of not a spirit the spirit 1964 and i've got i'm going to read you one from 64 and 1165 i want to put them in chronological order paradox now what is it christ coming to his body christ is the word we all know the anointing is christ that comes on the word that makes the word live is that right is that right how many have proved that's right see that is the anointing christ is the anointing the spirit that comes upon the word that quickens the word to make it live now the word is in your heart you you believe in divine healing whatever more see and christ the anointing coming to his body see the can see the connection there see the connection there saints you see the connection he's making look at that first line again christ the anointing coming to his body christ the anointing coming to his body you understand that's a connection just like husband and wife to become one now watch him flip it now here's his segue now the church has got to get to the ministry until to that level that's what we're that's our level of ministry to make this connection you understand that to get to the church and christ become one he can anoint you for every blessing that's in the bible all of it is all of it is yours everything promised at this age is yours i want you to have faith today i don't care what your physical need is emotional needs spiritual need mental need financial need family need doesn't matter every promise in the book is mine i've got an anointing in this age and an open word and a word and an anointing presence causing it to come to pass in my life i can't help but be a christian it compels me to be a christian i can't i'm not going to be able to avoid a body change it's changing me hallelujah now he goes to 1965 power of transformation why don't you want that one be not conformed to the world but be transformed power of transformation let the holy spirit come upon any person that's truly got something down there a healing comes from the inside let that healing come from the spirit that's in you if it's a genuine spirit anointing the genuine seed it can't do nothing but bear a son or daughter of god what a confidence we should have today friends that this word that you've believed you've not followed cunningly devised tales you've not followed something that's that's just trying to tickle your ears you're not you're not following someone that's trying to be fancy or popular where you're following the body word of the son of man you're you're you're you're you're hooked in you're connected you're connected to heavenly places in christ jesus that's the life that's what the word was set to do see there's no conflict you know it's it's it's so crazy to to see that that some people joust back and forth between oh you're you know here's some emotion and you're too pentecostal and here's here's no emotion and you know but it's it's just the word we just want the word only and you guys are are a bunch of fanatics well but you guys are just a bunch of dead letter say which side you're going to defend today neither one because it's not neither one the bottom line is there ain't no side there's only one side and his spirit and his life and he's the word and he's an anointing and he lives hallelujah hallelujah it's not an emotion for the sake of emotion it's neither is it accumulating of knowledge it's a living breathing experience of the holy ghost that comes into your life and makes the promises of god come to pass i'm not here to declare a conflict i'm i'm i'm here to declare unity and oneness in the faith of god and the bride of jesus christ will follow that amen amen amen amen amen god bless you friends let's stand to our feet god bless you we'll carry on plenty more material where that came from and just feel a little nudged to stop right there we've got a baptism and i love baptizing especially when it's young people and you know i the these little guys grew up here and i i watched their lives from little tikes and here they are young men growing up brother landon and brother mason are going to be baptized today and uh i think it was uh you know where we're there there's always the desire and it's always a fine thing i love doing it anyway i do it sometimes i only need a reason to it i'll get little kids deciding to start talking to them about spiritual things just to see where they're at i love children amen don't you they're so wonderful and to see them grow up in the beauty of holiness and uh one mother said to you do you need to talk to him because i think mason got sprung on he said you need to talk to him uh before you baptize him i said no i was standing at the altar when he tears rolling down his face amen amen he wanted more god amen i want to tell you something friends that's what we're trying to accomplish here and i i've watched brother landon i've watched him grow i've watched his spirit in his nature and what what beauty i'm so appreciative of you families who take the time who put in the the the time and spend the effort to raise them to nurture them to to to demonstrate god to them to they see you remember brother brandon was such a sad story when brother brown tells it he said all my life i was raised to think god hated me but jesus loved me what a torture for a child i mean you see you see what that catholicism influence in his family had tried to do god hates you but jesus loves you what a conflict what a conflicted person brother branham was he was so conflicted he didn't even know god but he was terrified he was going to die without his mercy and he's he's laying there remember he tells the story he said i was out there i think around phoenix and he was pushing cattle on on a ranch and he said oh slim we sitting by the fire one night and said slim reached in and got that comb like a homemade harmonica almost and he said it had a reed on it and he started started blowing on that and you know some real tender song about the lord and christ i forget now which one it was and brother branham said i would just i would i'd pull the cover over my head i didn't want to hear that you know and jesus keep me near the cross or something like that and he said and finally they would quit and he said i would pull my cover back and he said i'd lay there and i'd look up at those stars that beautiful western sky and he said tears would roll down my face he said i could hear the wind blowing through the trees and it seemed to say adam where art thou son and he said i look up at those heavens and those beautiful celestials and he said tears would run down my face and he said i would say please sir please sir don't destroy me before i can have a chance to find you oh there's so much value in getting a child to surrender to the lord right off the bat there's so much value parents don't ever think you that that should be your primary focus that should be the zenith of all of your efforts everything you you try to achieve and strive for should be to be christ be an example be a living word raise them in the admonition of god train them bring them up in the ways of god don't make the spirit of god a foreign thing to them my goodness i'm so glad to see our two brothers coming this morning amen
