[0:00] he turned his face to the wall and
[0:01] prayed unto the lord
[0:03] saying i beseech thee lord remember
[0:06] now how i have walked before thee in
[0:08] truth
[0:09] and with a perfect heart and have done
[0:12] that which is good
[0:13] in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore
[0:18] and it came to pass before isaiah was
[0:20] gone out into the middle court
[0:22] that the word of the lord came to him
[0:24] saying turn again
[0:26] and tell hezekiah the captain of my
[0:29] people
[0:30] thus saith the lord the god of david thy
[0:33] father
[0:34] i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy
[0:36] tears
[0:37] behold i will heal thee on the third day
[0:40] thou
[0:41] shalt go up unto the house of the lord
[0:44] and i will add
[0:45] unto thy days fifteen years and i will
[0:48] deliver thee
[0:49] this city and this city out of the hand
[0:52] of the king of assyria
[0:54] and i will defend this city for mine own
[0:56] sake
[0:57] and for my servant david's sake
[1:00] let's pray father we thank you this
[1:03] morning
[1:04] for your word lord there's a blessing
[1:08] just in
[1:09] reading your word and a blessing and
[1:11] hearing it read
[1:13] so father may we stand under the
[1:16] fountain of that blessing today
[1:18] be with us lord and strengthen me and
[1:21] body
[1:22] and father give us attentiveness and
[1:25] hearing hearts
[1:26] above all things we commit this to you
[1:28] today
[1:29] in jesus name amen god bless you friends
[1:32] you can be seated
[1:36] it's quite an amazing story
[1:39] this story of hezekiah and
[1:42] i want to as i did with the brothers
[1:46] yesterday i felt the need to really
[1:51] build hezekiah up in your mind and you
[1:54] say well why would
[1:55] why would you need to do that well i can
[1:57] tell you
[1:58] as a student of the scripture for since
[2:01] a boy and i've always studied the word
[2:04] of god intently from a very very young
[2:07] age
[2:08] and even even with all of that and
[2:11] everything brother branham had ever said
[2:12] about it
[2:13] i never really did a real examination
[2:17] of all of hezekiah's accomplishments
[2:21] hezekiah was probably
[2:25] he was certainly one of the greatest
[2:28] kings israel ever had and he was
[2:33] by far and away the most obedient
[2:37] king that israel ever had you'll find
[2:40] that
[2:40] even when you say well you know there
[2:42] was david and there was
[2:43] solomon but i don't need to rehearse to
[2:46] you
[2:47] the failures of david
[2:51] and i mean david's failures were so
[2:54] enormous that he got
[2:55] tens and tens of thousands of israelites
[2:59] killed and he set plagues loose
[3:02] by his failures he uh an innocent
[3:06] baby lost its life because of david's
[3:09] failures
[3:10] uh solomon we could go down and talk
[3:12] about what a great king he was
[3:14] represented the millennium time there it
[3:17] was a millennium
[3:18] time almost for israel but yet hezekiah
[3:22] in all of his life there's not a single
[3:25] thing
[3:26] ever recorded against him but one little
[3:28] small slip up
[3:30] and all it was was he he got a little
[3:33] bit
[3:33] prideful and uh he kind of bragged
[3:37] about all of his blessings you know you
[3:40] know
[3:40] look at all my gold and all my silver
[3:42] and all of our dedicated instruments and
[3:44] look at our
[3:45] temple and look at my palace and you
[3:48] know he's showing it
[3:49] to babylonian diplomats which was not a
[3:52] smart idea
[3:53] because then they they were going to
[3:55] come later and try to take it from him
[3:57] uh so you know you don't want to cast
[4:00] your pearl before swine
[4:02] you understand so there's a there's a
[4:04] balance even
[4:05] when you're witnessing the great things
[4:08] god has done for you
[4:10] so you've got to have wisdom when you're
[4:12] witnessing
[4:13] even even to know who to witness to
[4:16] and and to what level sometimes brother
[4:18] branham would come along
[4:19] and if he felt a little tug to witness
[4:21] to him he'd just
[4:22] tell a little story just enough to drop
[4:26] a little spiritual note in not even
[4:27] hardly
[4:28] noticeable and see if he'd get a
[4:29] reaction you know if
[4:31] if you keep throwing a lure into a spot
[4:33] and you don't get nothing you're going
[4:34] to change
[4:35] to another spot so so brother branham
[4:38] you know used a lot of wisdom
[4:40] when he was witnessing and so
[4:44] hezekiah you know not only
[4:47] so so now let me first say
[4:50] not only when we look at
[4:54] what he didn't do in other words he
[4:57] didn't commit adultery
[4:59] with bathsheba he didn't chase the wind
[5:01] like solomon
[5:02] he didn't number the people like david
[5:05] he didn't set up idols like solomon
[5:08] you're following the picture hezekiah
[5:10] just by virtue of what he never fell
[5:12] into
[5:13] you should go my goodness this guy was
[5:16] an epic king
[5:18] but then when we begin to look at even
[5:20] the things that he
[5:21] actually did we find that
[5:25] that that hezekiah you know he took the
[5:28] throne
[5:28] at 25 and his name means god has
[5:32] strengthened
[5:33] now he didn't even have the advantage of
[5:35] a godly father his father the king
[5:37] before him was an exceptionally wicked
[5:39] king
[5:40] you know just uh spilled idolatry
[5:43] everywhere
[5:44] uh throughout um israel
[5:48] in fact is it was under the reign
[5:51] of his father that we find that
[5:54] that the the very the very br brass
[5:58] serpent
[5:58] that moses built for the people
[6:01] they actually had set that thing up as a
[6:04] shrine and were
[6:05] worshiping it it was hezekiah who
[6:08] destroyed it
[6:10] now imagine the kind of revelation it
[6:12] took to go
[6:13] and destroy something moses built
[6:16] see so this was a man who was
[6:19] very uh adept at
[6:22] hearing from god we find that even at 25
[6:26] years old
[6:27] he zealously began as soon as he got the
[6:30] throne from his dad
[6:31] ahaz who had been ahaz had been one of
[6:34] the worst kings
[6:36] in israel's history and so we find that
[6:39] that as soon as hezekiah got the throne
[6:41] at 25
[6:42] he reopened the temple in jerusalem
[6:46] he sanctified the temple vessels that
[6:48] had been desecrated
[6:49] he reinstated the levitical priesthood
[6:51] he restored proper worship brought back
[6:53] the passover as a national holiday
[6:56] i mean they weren't even having church
[7:00] the church building was closed the
[7:02] preachers weren't even preaching
[7:04] the priesthood was completely collapsed
[7:06] the vessels were
[7:07] they couldn't even use the temple
[7:09] vessels and so
[7:11] passover huh what's that passover yeah
[7:13] what's that
[7:14] i mean that had that had gone you're
[7:17] talking about
[7:18] idolatry in the as brother branham
[7:21] called it
[7:21] the most holy place the most holy people
[7:25] see and so hezekiah does all of this
[7:28] hezekiah on the political side uh
[7:32] he he took you know for his his
[7:34] continuing religious
[7:36] reforms he smashed all the idols
[7:38] throughout all the land
[7:40] along with all the remains of their
[7:42] pagan worship
[7:43] he smashed as i told you the the bronze
[7:46] serpent that moses had made
[7:48] and you know during the time when the
[7:50] assyrian
[7:51] empire was on the march conquering one
[7:53] nation after another
[7:55] hezekiah on the infrastructure political
[7:57] side
[7:58] he actually fortified jerusalem against
[8:01] siege
[8:02] he built a 1700 foot long tunnel to
[8:05] provide a secret water supply
[8:07] that archaeologists only just recently
[8:09] found and so
[8:11] you know and and and so this is
[8:14] certainly the most obedient king israel
[8:16] ever had and
[8:17] and and one of the most accomplished
[8:21] kings
[8:22] that israel ever had this is a man who
[8:25] understood how to talk to god and get
[8:27] answers back from god
[8:28] even though he didn't have a priesthood
[8:29] and a church to go to wow
[8:32] think about that and didn't even have
[8:33] the holy ghost but we find
[8:36] that when hezekiah has a little faux pas
[8:40] he gets a little prideful he doesn't
[8:41] honor god in all of god's blessing and
[8:44] sometimes we
[8:45] we can do that moses did that he didn't
[8:47] honor the lord when he struck the rock
[8:48] twice of course it broke the type
[8:50] but what really what really you know
[8:53] bent god
[8:54] at him was he said you failed to uh
[8:58] to sanctify me i'm the one who brought
[9:01] that water out not you
[9:02] you acted like you did that but if i
[9:05] hadn't done it you'd have stood there
[9:06] like a dummy
[9:08] so you know and so you didn't even you
[9:10] didn't even honor me
[9:12] when you used my power so
[9:15] so we realized that that he come when
[9:18] the lord comes to him
[9:21] excuse me over this and he's going to
[9:24] actually die and the the assyrians
[9:27] you know are trying to come get those
[9:29] treasures and hezekiah has to pay king
[9:32] cinecrip 300 silver talents and
[9:34] 30 talents of gold and and uh you know
[9:38] just to protect them and then
[9:39] later on cinecrib tries to come back and
[9:42] get more money
[9:43] you know and he's trying to extort uh
[9:45] the king so anyway and god had to run
[9:47] him off
[9:48] but we find that that that hezekiah
[9:53] when he's told that
[9:56] you've got a disease and you're going to
[9:59] die
[10:00] that hezekiah is told to set your house
[10:03] in order
[10:05] so if you think about it for um just a
[10:07] minute
[10:08] here is a king who was great at being a
[10:11] king
[10:12] he was great at being a believer he was
[10:15] great at helping
[10:16] people he lived selflessly he served the
[10:20] nation
[10:20] he built their infrastructure he
[10:22] protected him against foreign invasion
[10:24] he was studious
[10:25] he was efficient he ran the treasury
[10:27] correctly
[10:28] he opened their churches back he put the
[10:30] priesthood back in
[10:32] started supporting the ministry did all
[10:35] of these things
[10:36] but yet his home wasn't in order
[10:40] amen and you find the remnants of that
[10:43] because as soon as
[10:44] hezekiah passes away his son succeeds
[10:47] him and immediately goes right back to
[10:48] idolatry
[10:50] and replenishes the land into idolatry
[10:52] so
[10:53] here is hezekiah sometimes if we're not
[10:56] careful friends
[10:57] you know where we can be we can be all
[11:00] out to the uttermost part of the earth
[11:02] you know say well i've never been there
[11:04] well maybe you're in judea and all
[11:06] samaria
[11:07] you see but you say well you know uh i
[11:10] don't even know
[11:11] about that but the real question that
[11:13] jesus
[11:14] told the the real statement that jesus
[11:17] made
[11:17] to his disciples were you'll receive
[11:20] power
[11:21] and the first place you'll have to be a
[11:23] witness is in your home
[11:24] in your jerusalem
[11:27] personal jerusalem there's where you'll
[11:30] have to set the standard don't go trying
[11:32] to run out
[11:33] into judea and don't whatever you do try
[11:36] to go out into samaria in the outer
[11:37] regions and whatever you do
[11:39] don't be trying to run abroad without
[11:41] you know
[11:42] without your home in order without first
[11:45] things first you should always do first
[11:48] things first
[11:50] you know just like you make god first in
[11:52] your life and you don't make him second
[11:54] and brother branham said he don't want
[11:56] to be second
[11:58] he don't deserve to be second
[12:01] he deserves to be first he paid a great
[12:03] price to be first in your life
[12:05] and i think you ought to honor that
[12:07] moses had a commission
[12:09] to go and do what he was going to do god
[12:12] told him verbatim
[12:13] go do this he had thus saith the lord
[12:15] and when he went to do it
[12:17] here comes a destroying angel to kill
[12:18] his child
[12:20] because he didn't have his home in order
[12:22] first yes he had a commission
[12:24] yes he had thus saith the lord but if it
[12:27] wasn't for zipporah quickly recognizing
[12:30] you know there's nobody who knows the
[12:32] husband's shortcomings more than the
[12:34] wife
[12:37] and so when she sees this angel coming
[12:39] to take out her child
[12:40] it doesn't take her a second to figure
[12:43] out what's up
[12:44] she knows okay this is why this is moses
[12:48] again running off without everything
[12:50] ready
[12:51] and trying to do god a service and it's
[12:53] even god's will
[12:54] but his home isn't in order
[12:57] and so quickly she does she has to pick
[13:00] up his slack
[13:03] she the well the wife wasn't a
[13:04] circumcised child that was the man's job
[13:06] and so we find that she's having she's a
[13:09] spiritual woman
[13:11] who has to make up for the spiritual
[13:13] holes in moses's swiss cheese
[13:15] as we were saying to the brothers
[13:17] yesterday you got holes in your cheese
[13:19] it's good cheese tastes great it's got
[13:20] holes in it your life might be good it
[13:23] might be great you might be doing a much
[13:25] for god
[13:26] but what about the holes that might
[13:28] exist at ground level at ground zero
[13:30] right where you live
[13:33] example before your family the example
[13:36] before your spouse now this is
[13:38] brother or sister i think the example of
[13:41] hezekiah
[13:42] applies to men and women because we all
[13:45] have our place i'm going to tell you
[13:46] something friends we're living in a day
[13:48] as i
[13:48] spoke to the brothers yesterday
[13:51] that we're living in a time where it's a
[13:55] dismal time
[13:56] where there's such a blending of light
[13:58] and darkness that it's dismal and you
[14:00] can't
[14:01] it the the more it blends and
[14:03] everything's about blending now
[14:05] they they've got it so blended you know
[14:07] it started out with
[14:08] you know it doesn't matter you know you
[14:11] know
[14:12] what what you believe as long as you
[14:14] believe jesus was the son of god who
[14:16] died for you
[14:16] but it matters more than that you see
[14:20] it wouldn't have done it wouldn't have
[14:22] done a man any good
[14:24] imagine a man standing there at golgotha
[14:27] watching jesus die
[14:28] believing him to be the son of god
[14:30] hearing his last words
[14:32] and walking away from there and with a
[14:35] bold declaration
[14:36] i am a follower of jesus christ and i
[14:39] believe in that man he is my lord and my
[14:41] savior
[14:42] and then and then 50 days later when
[14:45] peter comes out and preaches an
[14:46] indictment
[14:48] and the other disciples start preaching
[14:50] in the streets and that man says well
[14:53] you know i know about jesus at calvary
[14:55] but these apostles i
[14:56] i don't need that i don't there's no
[14:59] it's not incumbent upon me to
[15:01] to believe the continuation of calvary
[15:04] as long as i believe that historical
[15:06] event
[15:06] i'm good no you're not because the whole
[15:09] kingdom the whole doctrine of everything
[15:11] is built on the doctrine of the apostles
[15:12] and prophets
[15:13] and therefore jesus that whole ministry
[15:16] of jesus and the son of man ministry was
[15:18] going to replicate itself in a church
[15:21] and that was that was what was going to
[15:23] go into all the world so
[15:25] you you you you can't just you know have
[15:28] one part of something fixed you've got
[15:30] to take all the word
[15:32] and here we are in this day where
[15:35] they finally said there's such a
[15:37] blending to where now
[15:39] they're they're even there are lawsuits
[15:42] and people getting fired from jobs
[15:45] because
[15:46] they won't call they they call a man a
[15:49] man when the man
[15:51] doesn't want to be called a man okay
[15:52] i'll call you a woman i don't want to be
[15:54] don't call me anything
[15:55] don't identify me as a gender i'm well
[15:57] what are you then
[15:58] i'm neither so what are you yeah neither
[16:02] okay so what do i call you it
[16:05] you know do i call you an it you're not
[16:07] a he you're not a her
[16:09] but people today are actually losing
[16:12] their jobs
[16:13] losing their careers over this because
[16:16] because they
[16:17] they look at a man and call him by his
[16:18] man name his birth name and
[16:20] you know or a woman and the whole thing
[16:23] this is the blending it's
[16:24] it's such a time of a blending
[16:28] of light and darkness that it's becoming
[16:31] increasingly more difficult to discern
[16:34] between
[16:34] right and wrong and this is why mankind
[16:38] was told
[16:38] in prophecy that at the end one of the
[16:41] one of the telltale signs
[16:43] of the end time would be humanity would
[16:46] lose its ability to discern between
[16:48] right and wrong
[16:50] so that they would call things that are
[16:51] obviously wrong and had been thought of
[16:53] as wrong for thousands of years suddenly
[16:54] they'd call it right
[16:56] and call you wrong for not calling it
[16:57] right though it was though their parents
[16:59] and grandparents and great-grandparents
[17:00] called it wrong
[17:02] and you know you you uh the society is
[17:05] so
[17:05] woke today that you you don't even
[17:07] hardly know what to say in public
[17:09] and and you find out that these
[17:13] pre-tribulation
[17:14] and i use that word very sparingly you
[17:16] know but we find
[17:18] that elements that are going to be
[17:19] poured out in fullness in the
[17:20] tribulation
[17:21] you can't buy or sell except you have
[17:23] that mark the bride doesn't see that in
[17:25] its fullness but we
[17:26] are already seeing the platforms of it
[17:29] being built
[17:30] there are people already losing their
[17:32] income because they won't acquiesce to
[17:34] the
[17:34] to the radical antichrist spirit
[17:38] and so i'm here to tell you something
[17:39] friends you all you're already at a
[17:41] point where you'll deny yourself
[17:42] opportunities to
[17:44] to advance by staying
[17:47] with the bible and so so we find that
[17:51] that
[17:52] and and and therefore if there was ever
[17:54] an age
[17:55] where we have to have our spiritual
[17:57] compass
[17:59] calibrated shined up and cleaned and out
[18:02] and looking at it for every step we make
[18:04] because if you don't have a spiritual
[18:07] compass that's functioning properly
[18:09] in this day of blending of light and
[18:11] darkness and blending of right and wrong
[18:13] if you don't have a spiritual compass
[18:15] you're finished
[18:16] you're just finished you don't stand a
[18:18] chance this is not the time to have your
[18:21] senses dulled by the entertainments and
[18:23] rudiments of the world
[18:25] you need to have your spiritual acuity
[18:27] needs to be sharp
[18:28] you need to be constantly in contact
[18:31] with god
[18:32] this was this was the saving grace for
[18:34] hezekiah because he could go to god
[18:36] and and say lord you know i've been a
[18:38] righteous man and god actually applauded
[18:40] him
[18:41] and said i mean it's remarkable if if i
[18:44] say you're
[18:44] you're a good old boy or if i pat you on
[18:47] the back or if i give you a hero cookie
[18:49] it's another thing if a prophet even
[18:51] comes along and says
[18:53] i don't see any sin in your life you're
[18:55] clean before god but it's on all another
[18:57] whole another level for god to come down
[19:00] and go
[19:01] actually you're right hezekiah you have
[19:03] been a just man
[19:04] and you've lived perfectly you you're
[19:06] you're correct and beca and you're
[19:08] weeping bitterly and i really believe
[19:10] friends that that that was what was
[19:13] fueling the bitter tears
[19:15] that hezekiah became suddenly aware
[19:19] that i've done everything but do the
[19:22] first thing
[19:22] first i did the second third and fourth
[19:25] and fifth things really well
[19:27] but i've got holes in my cheese my home
[19:30] isn't exactly right
[19:31] my children are suffering my marriage is
[19:33] suffering my
[19:35] my the the the token to be applied over
[19:38] my home is hindered
[19:40] i want to tell you something friends i
[19:42] think that was what
[19:43] fueled the desperation of hezekiah's
[19:45] prayers
[19:46] because hezekiah could have just went on
[19:48] to his reward he had earned quite a bit
[19:50] amen but he didn't want to go with his
[19:53] home left
[19:54] unfixed amen and so you know that is a
[19:58] great
[19:58] lesson that we should take today out of
[20:01] the life
[20:02] of this great king god bless you let's
[20:04] stand
[20:06] father we thank you for our little
[20:08] sunday school class today

[20:16] sunday we
[20:18] thank you that we are here and alive to
[20:20] see it master
