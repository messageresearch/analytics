[43:04] Genesis chapter 19 we'll just begin
[43:06] reading I'm going to minister something
[43:07] the lord gave me this many months ago
[43:11] and um and I just wrote a title and if
[43:13] you ever go into my Google Docs you'll
[43:16] see just a bunch of those just one line
[43:19] that's all I've got is just one title
[43:20] and I just hold it there and let the
[43:22] Lord wait to to uh you know let it
[43:24] ruminate and give me inspiration to
[43:26] preach it and so I did that maybe 8 nine
[43:30] months ago and then I had prepared
[43:32] something uh you know for weeks now I'd
[43:35] prepared knowing that when I spoke here
[43:37] I would speak on uh another part to the
[43:40] Supreme token and actually had prepared
[43:42] that had all my notes laid out and then
[43:44] this morning the Lord just completely uh
[43:47] changed that and just flooded me with
[43:49] inspiration for this sermon I'm going to
[43:51] preach today so do you believe that the
[43:54] Lord Jesus still speaks how many believe
[43:56] that how many would say Lord speak to my
[43:58] heart today amen he can use the
[44:01] instrumentality of of men I'm just like
[44:03] you I got plenty of mistakes and
[44:05] failures and feel more unworthy uh you
[44:09] know to to be up here but I just want to
[44:11] yield my vessel now and let the Lord use
[44:13] me I know he has something he wants to
[44:15] say amen I want to preach to you this
[44:17] morning if they can uh just have my
[44:19] slides ready my title is the legacy of
[44:23] lot the legacy of lot just Genesis
[44:29] 19:1 and there came two angels to Sodom
[44:33] at even and lot sat in the gate of Sodom
[44:36] and lot seeing them rose up to meet them
[44:40] and he bowed himself with his face
[44:42] towards the ground and he said behold
[44:44] now my lords turn in I pray you into
[44:47] your servant's house and T all night and
[44:50] wash your feet and you shall rise up
[44:53] early and go on your ways and they said
[44:55] nay but we will abide in in the street
[44:57] all night and he pressed upon them
[45:00] greatly and they turned unto him and
[45:03] entered into his house and he made them
[45:06] a feast and did bake unleavened bread
[45:08] and they did eat but before they lay
[45:11] down the men of the city even the men of
[45:13] Sodom Compass the house round both old
[45:16] and young and all the people from every
[45:20] quarter notice how the the extent to
[45:25] this condition the Bible takes time to
[45:27] point out it was not just the youth but
[45:30] also the
[45:31] elderly the entire the def that that the
[45:34] disease had spread throughout the whole
[45:37] tribe the whole city there and it says
[45:39] here in verse four but before they lay
[45:42] down let's read verse 5 and they called
[45:43] unto lot and said unto him where are the
[45:46] men which came in to thee this night
[45:49] bring them out unto us that we may know
[45:51] them and lot went out at the door unto
[45:54] them and shut the door after him I want
[45:57] you to notice his words because it'll
[45:58] give you an indication of his spiritual
[46:00] condition notice what he calls them and
[46:04] said I pray
[46:05] you
[46:09] Brethren imagine that that he's so
[46:12] closely connected with the
[46:14] community that he's calling these men
[46:19] Brethren verse eight behold now I have
[46:22] two daughters which have not known man
[46:26] let me I pray you bring them out unto
[46:28] you and do you to them as is good in
[46:31] your eyes only unto these men do nothing
[46:35] for therefore came they under the shadow
[46:37] of my roof and they said stand back and
[46:41] they said again this one fellow came
[46:43] into sojourn and he will needs be a
[46:45] judge now we will deal worse with thee
[46:48] than with them and they pressed sore
[46:50] upon the man even lot and came near to
[46:53] break the door but the men put forth
[46:56] their hand and pulled lot into the house
[46:58] to them and shut the door and they
[47:00] smoked the men that were at the door of
[47:03] the house with blindness both small and
[47:05] great so that they wearied themselves to
[47:07] find the
[47:09] door we can just keep reading but I just
[47:11] to save time I want you to turn over to
[47:13] Luke chapter 17 really familiar
[47:15] scripture Luke chapter
[47:19] 17 we got just a uh just a sobering
[47:23] passage there and then the second one is
[47:24] sobering also amen but don't get all
[47:27] droy and Dr drowsy on me and blue this
[47:30] morning amen we're going to we're going
[47:31] to show you that the legacy of lot is
[47:34] not our
[47:35] Legacy amen Luke chapter 17 and let's
[47:39] just begin reading here very familiar
[47:40] scripture let's just begin reading here
[47:42] at verse 26 I'm sorry verse 28 likewise
[47:46] also as it was in the days of lot so
[47:50] Jesus points back to this as an
[47:52] indication of where we live today they
[47:56] did eat they Dr drank they bought they
[47:58] sold they planted they builded but the
[48:01] same day that lot went out of Sodom it
[48:04] rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[48:06] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[48:09] it be in the day when the son of man is
[48:13] revealed now we know the prophet of God
[48:15] links this and we know it's linked to
[48:18] the ministry of the son of man that
[48:19] would come in the end time remember it
[48:22] was at even the angels came and in the
[48:25] end time the son of man would be
[48:26] revealed and notice he points to that as
[48:29] a marker and says in verse 31 in that
[48:31] day he that W he which shall be upon the
[48:34] Housetop and his stuff in his house let
[48:37] him not come down to take it away and he
[48:39] that is in the field let him likewise
[48:41] not return back and then he inserts this
[48:43] one verse I want to draw emphasis from
[48:46] remember Lot's wife remember Lot's wife
[48:51] Lord
[48:52] Jesus Lord how we love you with all of
[48:55] our hearts God how we need you Lord I
[48:58] just pray right now father in the midst
[49:00] of this audience as I stand Lord both
[49:02] numbered here and those that are maybe
[49:04] listen live or later Lord I pray God
[49:07] that you would just let us pull up a
[49:08] chair to your table this morning God and
[49:11] may we feed Lord from your word truly
[49:14] Lord Jesus this is what we are hungry
[49:16] for it's what we're thirsty for Lord I
[49:20] pray God that you would feed your
[49:21] children Lord I just want to submit
[49:23] myself and surrender myself to you right
[49:25] now Lord God I pray that you would use
[49:28] Lord the gift you've placed in my life
[49:31] Lord and may I not stray Lord in my own
[49:33] thoughts but may God I just be centered
[49:35] and focused just a tool Lord we ask it
[49:38] in Jesus name bless our pastor those
[49:40] traveling Lord my dad I pray that you'd
[49:42] be as Lord as portion today God give him
[49:44] strength Lord and return him or safely
[49:47] to us we ask in Jesus name amen you can
[49:49] be seated this this morning you can just
[49:53] display my slide if you have that
[49:55] brother Mark you can go ahead and just
[49:57] display that and I'll have this
[50:02] here the legacy of
[50:05] lot I thought long and hard about this
[50:08] as the Lord just begin to deal with my
[50:10] mind on this uh sermon and I thought it
[50:14] was such a contrast between the life and
[50:17] the legacy of Abraham and the life and
[50:20] the legacy of this man his nephew lot
[50:24] we'll take just a moment just to lay
[50:26] some Foundation I know that you're
[50:28] familiar with the story but uh just to
[50:31] make good Bible teaching here to to to
[50:34] show you where we're at with this we'll
[50:35] just take just a moment to talk about
[50:37] this man lot we know that lot was the
[50:41] grandson of Tara and the the son of
[50:45] heran who died actually in Earth we know
[50:48] that he was also the nephew making him
[50:50] the nephew lot making him the nephew of
[50:54] Abraham and he was born also o in the
[50:57] same place that Abraham was born in
[50:59] lot's father suddenly dies and this is
[51:03] his dad I don't know much about his dad
[51:05] because the Bible doesn't say much about
[51:07] him but we know that they both lived in
[51:10] this city of ER and we know the Bible
[51:13] records that that he dies that his
[51:15] father haran if I'm saying that right
[51:18] dies and so lot was taken as like an
[51:22] adopted son and brother brandham calls
[51:24] him that that Abraham being that this
[51:26] was his family Abraham had a love for
[51:29] him like a son and we know that lot is
[51:32] there living now without a dad and I
[51:35] don't know his history and you know I
[51:37] just want to be very careful and and and
[51:39] go slow here just at the moment because
[51:42] you don't I I don't want to portray lot
[51:45] in a way that that the word didn't
[51:47] portray him and I want to make sure I do
[51:50] justice to what we know about him
[51:53] because I don't know his whole history
[51:55] and you know many times s it's the it's
[51:57] the it's the Legacy that was not left by
[52:01] the previous generation that the next
[52:03] one doesn't have a chance and so we we
[52:06] don't know about we know that ER was a a
[52:09] place of uh you know it was Mesopotamia
[52:13] where Abraham lived if you ever look
[52:15] that up on the map you'll find where the
[52:18] Garden of Eden was the Bible tells us
[52:20] that there was three rivers and out of
[52:22] that was The Tigress the Nile and the
[52:25] Euphrates River you can actually still
[52:27] see that tigress and the Euphrates there
[52:29] today if you just look at a modern map
[52:32] and if you ever notice the land that
[52:34] splits the two rivers is actually the
[52:37] land of
[52:38] Mesopotamia meso means between potamia
[52:42] the rivers and so Abraham came from
[52:46] between the two rivers that's what it
[52:47] means there that this was the place we
[52:49] know that further this is where Babylon
[52:52] is established and so it would have to
[52:55] been a very evil place that that he's
[52:58] living in that's why God calls him out
[52:59] of that place you know I want to I want
[53:02] to give you a scripture in the book of
[53:04] Isaiah that I read this morning and I
[53:07] never had called it before I thought it
[53:08] was so powerful that Isaiah points back
[53:12] to the faith of Abraham and it says from
[53:15] when Abraham and his descendants God
[53:19] pulled them from the
[53:21] pit and I thought that was so powerful
[53:24] because many times we make Abraham to be
[53:26] this great God chose him because of some
[53:29] Faith No Abraham was just another man in
[53:31] a pit that God had mercy
[53:34] upon and so any Jew looking back to the
[53:37] faith of Abraham and Paul points to him
[53:39] in Hebrews Jesus mentions him and we
[53:43] know that that it was Abraham's Faith
[53:45] this was not a good righteous man not a
[53:48] man who was different than the you know
[53:50] was somehow better than the rest of
[53:52] society but somehow God showed Sovereign
[53:55] Grace and pulled him out of the pit and
[53:59] so God takes him out of the land of of
[54:02] of his fathers we know the story in the
[54:04] test of Abraham as he goes through and
[54:07] the Bible says he left there he he
[54:09] obeyed the voice of God he left that
[54:12] land and and and and he takes lot with
[54:15] him we know that story very well and at
[54:18] some point you know here lot's
[54:20] grandfather uh you know Tara decides to
[54:23] relocate his entire family to Canaan but
[54:26] they ended up settling in haran instead
[54:30] and at T after Tara's death the Lord
[54:33] comes to Abraham and he's Abram we know
[54:36] at that time and he speaks to him and he
[54:40] tells him you know that I'm going to
[54:41] make you we know this is in Genesis I
[54:43] think it's chapter 21 or chapter uh 12
[54:47] and he and he tells them I'll make of
[54:48] thee a great nation and in thy seed
[54:51] shall all the nations of the earth be
[54:54] blessed and that's all Abraham had to go
[54:57] Abraham had to go on he just had a
[54:59] promise from the Lord and he left
[55:02] everything he he he immediately in fact
[55:05] if you go look up that Hebrew word there
[55:08] when the Bible says he he he he left it
[55:10] means that he instantly he didn't
[55:12] question it he immediately left
[55:15] everything that he known he immediately
[55:17] left everything that he had been raised
[55:19] and and and and and and just left his
[55:21] entire family left his Heritage left his
[55:24] his
[55:25] history and and he just goes and he's so
[55:28] joury I think this is so amazing because
[55:30] all he had to go on was just the word of
[55:33] the voice that spoke to him God didn't
[55:35] show him anything more than that get up
[55:40] and go and God waits for
[55:43] obedience and Abraham the Bible says
[55:46] doesn't question it he just obeys the
[55:49] voice of the Lord and so he sets out on
[55:51] his journey and we know the Bible tells
[55:53] us how that lot goes with him forgive me
[55:55] let me set that's just here for a
[55:58] moment thank
[56:00] you felt
[56:04] [Laughter]
[56:06] that and so we know that that lot goes
[56:09] with him and we know that that here
[56:11] comes the story of how they come to
[56:13] bethl I think it was bethl and the
[56:15] Sheep's herder lot's sheep's herders and
[56:18] Abraham's uh sheep herders begin to
[56:20] argue and quarrel over the land and and
[56:23] and and you know and that there wasn't
[56:24] enough land to support two families and
[56:26] two tribes and the amount of sheep that
[56:28] they had apparently and so the Bible
[56:30] says that he gives Abraham gives an
[56:33] offer to lot and just says you know I we
[56:35] we're going to have to separate now this
[56:37] was all directed by the Holy Spirit was
[56:39] all directed by the Lord because Abraham
[56:41] was going to face many tests in his life
[56:44] he was going to before he inherited the
[56:46] promise he was going to come to many
[56:48] Crossroads in his life he was going to
[56:51] come to many decisions in his life and
[56:53] he was going to have to make the right
[56:55] choice he didn't realize it but he was
[56:58] leaving behind a
[57:01] legacy you know I thought about this
[57:03] word legacy and and and actually sorry
[57:06] for blanking that actually this word
[57:07] legacy this is actually what it means so
[57:10] powerful a legacy is actually portrayed
[57:14] as the impact I love that word and The
[57:19] Inheritance that one leaves behind it's
[57:22] portrayed as the
[57:24] impact and the inheritance
[57:27] that he leaves behind let me give you
[57:29] something the Lord just gave me this
[57:31] morning I thought it was so good that a
[57:34] legacy is not a
[57:39] resume because there's a worldly version
[57:43] or a worldly teaching of legacy and many
[57:46] times it surrounds
[57:48] money and what kind of livelihood you
[57:51] leave your family and how much wealth
[57:53] that you leave your family you actually
[57:56] find in the Bible that the Bible goes
[57:58] directly actually against that almost
[58:00] entirely when we think of Legacy the
[58:02] first thing we think of is money or
[58:05] maybe land or a house or property that's
[58:07] left behind and and and it becomes a you
[58:10] know the all important all consuming
[58:12] thing of as you get older what are you
[58:14] leaving that's not saying that that's
[58:16] not important friends I'm not not at all
[58:18] don't misunderstand me uh but but it but
[58:21] because even in the Bible this was
[58:22] important to them also but they didn't
[58:24] have much these were tent dwellers this
[58:28] brother brandham calls them dirt dobers
[58:31] the the the the Abraham's Seth's seed
[58:34] was never popular Rich famous but that
[58:39] was actually the seedline of Cain that
[58:41] was Builders of great cities but Seth's
[58:45] line was they they were vagabonds they
[58:47] were tent dwellers they were they were
[58:49] sojourners they were
[58:52] pilgrims they were just journeying they
[58:55] were just passing
[58:57] through the they understood that life
[58:59] was just a vapor they understood that
[59:02] you're here today and you're going
[59:04] tomorrow and and so that that was his
[59:07] seedline his legacy was after uh a a a
[59:11] after the the even the sons the Bible
[59:13] talks about the inheritance that he
[59:15] leaves first it would come to the sons
[59:17] and if there were no Sons it'd go to the
[59:19] daughters and then the brothers and then
[59:20] the uncles and finally whoever it was
[59:23] the closest relative would receive the
[59:24] inheritance left behind behind and so
[59:27] God's sign even in Proverbs the Bible
[59:30] speaks of this and it tells talks about
[59:33] uh uh being able to leave uh your
[59:35] children uh an inheritance was actually
[59:38] a sign of blessing this is what Proverbs
[59:41] 13 teaches and I'm just skipping a lot
[59:43] of my notes here to save time but there
[59:46] was also a sense uh that that that there
[59:50] was also a clear teaching in the Bible
[59:53] that actually the best Legacy that that
[59:56] a man could leave behind is the
[59:58] testimony of the life of his
[1:00:02] children blessed is the man who you know
[1:00:05] who you know whose quiver is full the
[1:00:07] Bible speaks of for they shall defend
[1:00:09] him at the gate and so you know that
[1:00:12] that teaching was that those children if
[1:00:14] there was an accusation against the
[1:00:15] father he would actually come to the
[1:00:17] gate and not have to open his mouth to
[1:00:19] defend the accusation because his
[1:00:21] children had the testimony of their
[1:00:23] father and they defended him
[1:00:26] think about Jesus he don't have to open
[1:00:28] his mouth to defend himself because his
[1:00:31] children speak for him with their lives
[1:00:34] they speak about the testimony that's
[1:00:36] why the prophet of God said as long as
[1:00:38] there's a Believer who will say Amen to
[1:00:41] the word of God it proves that Jesus is
[1:00:43] still
[1:00:44] alive think about that and so it was
[1:00:48] actually the the greatest sign or that
[1:00:50] you could leave was actually to your
[1:00:52] children and and so it was actually Pro
[1:00:56] you'd look at like property and and land
[1:00:58] and homes and and things like this but
[1:01:01] the Bible even the teacher of here's
[1:01:03] ecclesiast we know Solomon you know
[1:01:06] talks about he's talk about how that you
[1:01:08] work hard and you to make money and that
[1:01:11] might be passed down and Solomon says to
[1:01:13] a fool and then he squanders that and
[1:01:16] then what Legacy is that something that
[1:01:19] moths the you know just as Jesus said
[1:01:21] don't lay yourself Treasures in Earth
[1:01:24] where moths and rust do doth corrupt but
[1:01:28] lay your Treasures in
[1:01:32] Heaven Proverbs talks about wisdom I
[1:01:35] don't want to get sidetracked here so
[1:01:37] just bear with me here for a moment but
[1:01:39] it talks about wisdom being more
[1:01:41] precious in PSAL Proverbs 3:15 that that
[1:01:44] that that wisdom is more precious than
[1:01:47] rubies and to walk in the ways of
[1:01:49] righteousness and and in the paths of
[1:01:52] justice that that that bestows a rich
[1:01:55] and
[1:01:56] inheritance on The Descendants after
[1:02:00] him uh even the psalm David says here
[1:02:03] how important is to pass the knowledge
[1:02:05] and you know the scripture in Psalms
[1:02:07] chapter 78 and I'm just recalling it by
[1:02:10] memory but s David says we will not hide
[1:02:13] these things from our children but will
[1:02:16] tell to the Next Generation the
[1:02:18] praiseworthy Deeds of God and David
[1:02:20] begins to list the mighty works that God
[1:02:23] did and how that they came out of the
[1:02:25] Red Sea and and God made him the waters
[1:02:27] to stand up as a heap and and he was
[1:02:30] drank out of the rocky cck in the desert
[1:02:32] and how that Shadrach and meach and
[1:02:34] abedo was delivered in Daniel's F in the
[1:02:38] story of
[1:02:41] Daniel something greatest Legacy that
[1:02:45] you can leave behind it's good to leave
[1:02:46] Earthly wisdom it's good to leave
[1:02:48] Earthly knowledge it's good to teach
[1:02:50] them good things about life and and
[1:02:53] business and success and and not to be
[1:02:55] lazy and to be hard workers I believe in
[1:02:57] all of that friends but the greatest
[1:03:00] treasure you can leave them is the
[1:03:02] wisdom of this
[1:03:03] [Applause]
[1:03:06] word and and Jesus says this in Matthew
[1:03:09] 6 we just quoted it and says that that
[1:03:12] that talks about how how how uh uh
[1:03:15] worthless Earthly treasure
[1:03:18] is and he talks about to not store up
[1:03:21] yourself Treasures on Earth do we
[1:03:24] believe this
[1:03:26] but store up for yourself Treasures in
[1:03:29] Heaven where moths and and and Vermin do
[1:03:32] not destroy it where thieves do not
[1:03:35] break in and steal
[1:03:37] it and so we know that this Legacy the
[1:03:40] leaving behind a legacy and you know I
[1:03:43] just want to say this because the Holy
[1:03:44] Spirit reminds me as he did before I
[1:03:46] came out and I want to make sure I say
[1:03:48] this because not always do the children
[1:03:51] follow in the Legacy Godly Legacy Left
[1:03:54] Behind for the from the
[1:03:57] father and so so we know we can see that
[1:04:00] we can show you that in the Bible in
[1:04:02] many places how they there was Godly
[1:04:04] legacies left that children squandered
[1:04:07] later
[1:04:09] right and so don't I just say that
[1:04:11] because don't ever look at a family and
[1:04:13] say bye what kind of Legacy look at
[1:04:15] their children friends that's not always
[1:04:17] the case just because you're left a
[1:04:20] Godly Heritage or left good wisdom in
[1:04:22] the teaching of the word of God doesn't
[1:04:24] mean that those children won't squander
[1:04:26] that
[1:04:27] Legacy
[1:04:30] hello and so we think of this because
[1:04:33] it's so powerful that this was the
[1:04:35] Legacy this was this is what the Bible
[1:04:38] teaches and we we we read this
[1:04:40] definition that the legacy is portrayed
[1:04:42] as the impact and The Inheritance that
[1:04:45] one leaves behind it's the it's the
[1:04:49] impact or the Legacy let me just go back
[1:04:52] to what I was saying here earlier a
[1:04:54] legacy is not a resume of
[1:04:59] accomplishments it's not a list of how
[1:05:02] much money you left in the bank when you
[1:05:05] breathed your last
[1:05:09] breath it's not the all of the worldly
[1:05:13] Acquisitions or the great business that
[1:05:15] you it's not a legacy according to the
[1:05:18] Bible but a legacy is the
[1:05:22] imprint you leave on the future
[1:05:29] it's an imprint or as this definition
[1:05:31] says it so well an impact that you
[1:05:36] leave think about the Legacy that
[1:05:39] Abraham was
[1:05:40] building and he never even realized it
[1:05:44] think about that friends he never even
[1:05:47] realized that his name would be mention
[1:05:50] in Hebrews chapter 12 when it begins to
[1:05:53] list the heroes of the
[1:05:57] faith and you think about Abraham as
[1:06:00] he's he leaves everything he knows he
[1:06:02] comes to many test in his life and God
[1:06:04] says just leave it Abraham and then God
[1:06:07] you know his father dies and and God
[1:06:09] says you can't stay here uh crying and
[1:06:12] weeping over over what you've lost
[1:06:15] you've got to get up Abraham you got to
[1:06:17] keep going you can't stop you can't you
[1:06:20] can't let anything stop you
[1:06:23] Abraham you can't let your you can't let
[1:06:26] sorrow stop you then he comes to the
[1:06:27] story of where he has to separate
[1:06:30] himself and he tells lot you know you
[1:06:32] you you choose choose what you I
[1:06:35] whatever you take I'll take the opposite
[1:06:37] and the Bible says that lot looking at
[1:06:39] the well-watered pl Plains chose to
[1:06:43] pitch his tent towards
[1:06:45] Sodom but Abraham also made a choice oh
[1:06:49] come on somebody Abraham also made a
[1:06:52] hard choice to pitch his tent away from
[1:06:57] Sodom you think about this scripture in
[1:06:59] Hebrews chap 12 and it says wherefore
[1:07:01] seeing we are also compassed about with
[1:07:05] so great a cloud of witnesses that great
[1:07:08] cloud of witnesses he goes on to tell
[1:07:11] about this man named Abraham I thought
[1:07:13] about this because Abraham walked by
[1:07:17] faith and not by sight he wasn't going
[1:07:20] based upon what he felt he wasn't going
[1:07:23] based upon Intel or knowledge that he
[1:07:25] had received he was going based upon
[1:07:28] faith in a promise in a word given by
[1:07:31] God and that's all he had and that's all
[1:07:34] that he
[1:07:35] needed and and I just thought about that
[1:07:38] this morning I thought that that that is
[1:07:41] so perfectly fitting or typing the life
[1:07:45] of a True Believer that we live our
[1:07:48] daily lives by the invisible things that
[1:07:53] we can't touch
[1:07:56] amen think about that just for a moment
[1:07:59] friends do you realize you've based your
[1:08:02] entire life of things you can't
[1:08:08] see a Christian bases his life not on
[1:08:12] what he knows or understands or even
[1:08:15] feels but let me just say this you've
[1:08:18] never seen God with your
[1:08:20] eyes you you say well I've seen the
[1:08:22] pillar of fire you might seen as
[1:08:24] anointing or you know or or something
[1:08:26] like that but the Bible says no man have
[1:08:28] seen him and so you've never seen
[1:08:34] God yet how many Believers of God do we
[1:08:36] have here
[1:08:38] today you've never seen
[1:08:40] him you've never even you've never seen
[1:08:43] you've heard about Jesus you've you've
[1:08:45] you you've lived your life reading the
[1:08:47] stories of Jesus of Nazareth but you've
[1:08:50] never seen him let me just go further
[1:08:52] you've never been to heaven
[1:08:57] you've never been there but yet you're
[1:09:00] going there yet you're living your daily
[1:09:03] life all for a place you've never
[1:09:08] been you've never you've never you've
[1:09:10] never uh seen anyone individual from
[1:09:14] Heaven yet you know that there's people
[1:09:16] there waiting just beyond the Riven
[1:09:19] Veil you've never seen it you've never
[1:09:22] even seen a many of us here have never
[1:09:24] seen a rich manuscripts of the of the
[1:09:27] Bible and yet you believe in it today
[1:09:30] you say brother Matt why because I have
[1:09:33] contacted something from that place and
[1:09:36] I've received just a down
[1:09:39] payment just a down payment and that's
[1:09:42] enough to make me forsake everything in
[1:09:45] this world and it makes me forsake
[1:09:48] everything that I want it makes me
[1:09:50] forsake all my dreams it makes me
[1:09:53] forsake all my plans why brother Matt
[1:09:55] because you've been there no I've never
[1:09:56] been there but there's something in my
[1:09:59] heart there's a seed of faith that says
[1:10:01] I know that it's more real than what I
[1:10:04] see here
[1:10:06] today you've never seen uh we talk about
[1:10:10] the grace of God the mercy of God yet
[1:10:13] yet they're not
[1:10:16] tangible think about that just for a
[1:10:19] moment nothing of what you're living
[1:10:22] your life for do you have physical
[1:10:26] evidence
[1:10:29] for and yet you people are living all
[1:10:33] the days of your life according to
[1:10:38] this shows you the power of
[1:10:42] faith it was Abraham who left everything
[1:10:45] brother bam says here in Jehovah Gyra as
[1:10:47] we go just a little further we find that
[1:10:50] Abraham had separated himself from lot I
[1:10:53] want you to notice the Christian Act
[1:10:55] Abraham he said lot you take the choice
[1:11:00] lot being
[1:11:02] backsliding in his heart he took the
[1:11:05] well-watered plains of Sodom and
[1:11:08] Gomorrah but Abraham took the
[1:11:12] poor desolate Barren
[1:11:17] ground what was it inside of
[1:11:21] lot brother Bon begins to give us just
[1:11:24] some
[1:11:25] some insight into the condition of his
[1:11:28] family we know that the prophet of God
[1:11:31] types him with that backslid and
[1:11:33] lukewarm believer he preaches a message
[1:11:36] called escap and come hither
[1:11:39] thither and he talks about how that lot
[1:11:42] was a famous man in that
[1:11:45] City you think about this as from the
[1:11:49] very beginning he sets his eyes towards
[1:11:52] the city of Sodom
[1:11:55] now remember a few things about lot
[1:11:57] because I I got to disc cover these just
[1:11:59] here for a
[1:12:00] moment remember that lot the Bible calls
[1:12:04] a righteous
[1:12:07] man and and you can go pick this up even
[1:12:10] if you look at his life in in Genesis
[1:12:14] 19 and the Bible calls him in second
[1:12:18] Peter chapter 2 verse 7 the Apostle
[1:12:21] Peter describes lot as being just
[1:12:27] just in other words he he he had an
[1:12:30] experience with the Lord in his
[1:12:32] life he was just and even calls him
[1:12:37] righteous yet he chooses to live his
[1:12:41] life in a backsliding city Wicked City
[1:12:45] like
[1:12:47] Sodom most of us think you know today
[1:12:49] and when we think of cities like Sodom
[1:12:51] and we think of of of LA or we think of
[1:12:54] San Francisco go and cities that would
[1:12:56] be like Sodom I tell you what friends
[1:12:58] it's about that way about every city you
[1:13:00] go to today it's spread from C to see
[1:13:04] but let me just say it's easy to look at
[1:13:06] a city it's easy to look at a backslid
[1:13:08] and people but actually to find Sodom
[1:13:11] you only need to look at your
[1:13:15] heart because the Bible says that the
[1:13:18] heart is deceitful above all else it's
[1:13:22] wicked how many believe that here today
[1:13:26] and so even despite all of this God
[1:13:28] calls this man lot
[1:13:30] righteous yet way deep below all of the
[1:13:35] external
[1:13:37] layers of what everyone's seen from his
[1:13:41] confession from maybe the way he comes
[1:13:43] out of her and he's there with Abraham
[1:13:46] he looks like a Believer he dresses like
[1:13:48] a Believer he talks like a Believer he
[1:13:50] knows the message he quotes the message
[1:13:55] and and we spoke on this before I'll
[1:13:57] just I'll just repeat it here for a
[1:13:59] moment that it never ceases to amaze me
[1:14:02] when you watch that that that that judge
[1:14:06] the Bible speaks of that when the judge
[1:14:08] died and you watch how that the people
[1:14:10] the family love the Lord serve the Lord
[1:14:12] believe the Lord live the message I've
[1:14:15] watched it live the message as far as
[1:14:17] from an external outside appearance that
[1:14:20] have all the layers that would look like
[1:14:22] Believers yet if you were to peel back
[1:14:24] all the those layers what you'd find is
[1:14:27] you'd find what was in lot that lot had
[1:14:29] a string to Sodom that he couldn't
[1:14:35] break he
[1:14:38] had lifestyle it was it was a it was a
[1:14:42] deep spiritual problem Oh I Feel the
[1:14:45] unction of the Holy Spirit right now it
[1:14:48] was a deep rooted something beyond the
[1:14:50] layers of what you could see outside and
[1:14:53] you watch behind because when you peel
[1:14:55] back all the layers and you watch what a
[1:14:57] person is really anchored to all you got
[1:14:59] to do is remove that anchor that Dad
[1:15:02] that Grandpa that Grandma that
[1:15:06] church that father who believed the word
[1:15:09] stood for the word kept those children
[1:15:11] straight but watch when that Ministry or
[1:15:13] that testimony either goes errant and
[1:15:16] backslides and if their faith was only
[1:15:19] anchored to the man they'll backslide
[1:15:21] with that
[1:15:22] man prophet of God says when I leave the
[1:15:25] word you leave
[1:15:28] me let me just say this friends if I
[1:15:30] ever leave this word you leave me I
[1:15:33] believe any true god-called Minister
[1:15:35] would say
[1:15:37] that and you notice when they when that
[1:15:40] person dies are gone then suddenly like
[1:15:43] a boat floating on the tide that
[1:15:45] Anchor's pulled up and then slowly you
[1:15:48] don't notice it at first maybe but it's
[1:15:49] drifting further and further and
[1:15:53] further and then before you know
[1:15:57] it what
[1:16:00] happened what happened to
[1:16:02] lot behind all of the layers there was a
[1:16:05] deep rooted spiritual problem he was
[1:16:10] bound by an unseen
[1:16:15] cord his heart the Bible says he seen
[1:16:18] the well-watered plains he seen the city
[1:16:20] of Sodom and that City
[1:16:23] somehow took Talons and planted in his
[1:16:27] heart lot though he was righteous
[1:16:30] brother bam picks it up and says oh the
[1:16:32] sins of that City vexed his righteous
[1:16:36] Soul he said brother mat then why didn't
[1:16:39] he come out he had a chance he had many
[1:16:43] chances to come out in fact the the
[1:16:45] Bible records the story of lot and his
[1:16:47] family being taken captives by the Kings
[1:16:51] the five Kings you remember that story
[1:16:52] of Abraham and lot in his entire family
[1:16:55] is taken captive and and what is it it's
[1:16:58] God it's the grace of God it's the mercy
[1:17:00] of God trying to shake him and his
[1:17:04] entire his entire family is taken
[1:17:06] captive says Abraham armed an army and
[1:17:08] goes and and Slaughters the Kings and
[1:17:10] rescues him see brother the mat why are
[1:17:12] you preaching on that because I just
[1:17:14] want to show you that despite a powerful
[1:17:17] Supernatural
[1:17:20] experience even being delivered yet he
[1:17:23] still went back to
[1:17:28] Sodom he couldn't break loose the Bible
[1:17:31] says in 2 Peter 2:8 for that righteous
[1:17:34] man dwelling among them in seeing and
[1:17:37] hearing vexed his righteous
[1:17:40] soul from day to day with their unlawful
[1:17:42] Deeds the prophet of God says it vexed
[1:17:45] his righteous soul but he didn't have
[1:17:47] the
[1:17:49] backbone to speak out against
[1:17:52] it another place he said he didn't have
[1:17:54] the playing downright
[1:17:56] gumption think we need some gumption
[1:17:59] about us friends I believe in how many
[1:18:01] would just want to say Lord in the
[1:18:03] wishy-washy World let me have some
[1:18:05] gumption about
[1:18:09] me he he couldn't he couldn't break
[1:18:11] loose from it lot knew better than to
[1:18:14] stay there he knew the scriptures of
[1:18:16] Psalms blessed is the Bible says is he
[1:18:19] that walketh not in the way the counsel
[1:18:21] of the ungodly nor sth in the seat of
[1:18:23] the scornful
[1:18:25] lot should have said at that moment this
[1:18:27] is my chance this is my
[1:18:30] Deliverance but yet somehow he couldn't
[1:18:33] break free he didn't have the plain
[1:18:41] gumption God gave him opportunity to
[1:18:44] leave listen God will never leave us
[1:18:47] without an opportunity friends to get
[1:18:48] out of this
[1:18:50] place God gave him opportunities to
[1:18:53] leave he gave him a chance to leave we
[1:18:55] just told the story he's attacked and
[1:18:57] he's taken
[1:18:58] captive oh but he he couldn't break
[1:19:01] free you say well lot never had a Bible
[1:19:05] Sodom had no Bible That's Right lot had
[1:19:09] no pre what what chance did his children
[1:19:11] have there was no Bible in those schools
[1:19:14] what chance did his family have there
[1:19:16] was there was no scripture being read
[1:19:18] there was no sermon being preached
[1:19:20] you're right in Sodom but I tell you
[1:19:22] what Abraham was his life was a sermon
[1:19:26] being preached to lot every day of his
[1:19:29] life and sometimes the only sermon that
[1:19:32] they'll hear is the sermon You Preach
[1:19:35] with your testimony I say oh God give us
[1:19:37] a testimony Lord not a compromising how
[1:19:41] many want that not a compromising Spirit
[1:19:44] but let them see my
[1:19:52] life the Bible says that the sins I I
[1:19:55] just focused there for a moment vexed
[1:19:58] his righteous
[1:20:00] soul and because he could never take a
[1:20:04] stand against
[1:20:05] it say brother Matt what was he do you
[1:20:08] believe he was he was a I do I don't I I
[1:20:11] I believe with all my heart as the Bible
[1:20:13] says and brother bam says he was a
[1:20:14] Believer he believed the
[1:20:18] word he I have no doubt he respected
[1:20:22] Abraham this is a family M of his I have
[1:20:25] no doubt but you say brother Matt what
[1:20:27] happened to him I tell you what happened
[1:20:29] to that
[1:20:30] man that man had be so
[1:20:34] unaware or
[1:20:37] asleep to the
[1:20:40] war that was
[1:20:44] raging and friends let me just stop here
[1:20:46] for a moment and just say that we can
[1:20:48] become so
[1:20:51] unaware that the battle never
[1:20:58] stops the battle never
[1:21:02] stops I I and and in a moment let me
[1:21:05] just say it is it is so staggering to me
[1:21:08] in a how quickly we can go from the the
[1:21:11] season of Revival and faith and
[1:21:14] victory to the season of carnal and cold
[1:21:18] and backslid
[1:21:20] it can we be honest people here today
[1:21:25] listen friends we're in a battle we're
[1:21:27] in a war the brother bandam said in
[1:21:30] greatest battle ever fault that the
[1:21:31] greatest battle was being waged right
[1:21:33] now in the mind and there's it's always
[1:21:37] been about a war it started in heaven
[1:21:40] that battle started in heaven in a
[1:21:42] Heavenly Dimension you know that there's
[1:21:44] three battles the prophet tells us
[1:21:46] there's three battles one that started
[1:21:48] in heaven and then that battle that
[1:21:50] Heavenly battle became an Earthly battle
[1:21:52] and it's now the battle of the human
[1:21:54] mind and one day it will leave the
[1:21:57] battle of the human mind and it will it
[1:22:00] will spill over into the battle of
[1:22:02] Armageddon that battle of Armageddon
[1:22:04] will only be the physical Battle of
[1:22:06] those demonic forces that you say are
[1:22:09] they just suddenly going to appear no
[1:22:10] brother they're just suddenly going to
[1:22:12] take on flesh because right now they're
[1:22:14] in the fourth dimension whether you can
[1:22:17] see them hear them touch them they are
[1:22:20] making the minds of people go crazy
[1:22:26] you don't don't ever forget that this is
[1:22:27] a real spiritual war it's a real
[1:22:30] spiritual battle the same battle that
[1:22:32] happen in in heaven and my Bible says
[1:22:35] that when Satan wored in heaven God cast
[1:22:38] him out of Heaven oh and I could hear
[1:22:40] the prophet say if he cast him out of
[1:22:42] Heaven what will he do to you when the
[1:22:43] Devil Comes attacking you and your home
[1:22:46] and your mind you say what do I do
[1:22:47] brother Matt cast him out of your house
[1:22:50] cast him out of your heart cast him out
[1:22:52] of your mind cast him out of your
[1:22:55] family he's a squatter he's just a
[1:22:58] bluff the prophet of God tells us in the
[1:23:01] Feast of the trumpets those 200 million
[1:23:05] demons that were held at the river
[1:23:08] Euphrates and the Bible says that they
[1:23:11] were held in Revelations it says that
[1:23:13] they were held for a certain year and a
[1:23:17] certain month you'll read it at a
[1:23:19] certain day at a certain hour at a
[1:23:22] certain moment
[1:23:24] just like Jude says they were reserved
[1:23:27] Fallen Angels
[1:23:28] reserved they were reserved in other
[1:23:31] words they were held back you say
[1:23:33] brother Matt what were those 200 imagine
[1:23:35] that picture here for a moment 200
[1:23:37] million demons waiting on the edge of
[1:23:39] the bank of the river but that river
[1:23:41] that flowed from Eden stopped them from
[1:23:43] Crossing and brother bandam says those
[1:23:45] demon Spirits wanted so bad to go over
[1:23:49] when you go over the river of Euphrates
[1:23:52] you know where you be in the land of
[1:23:53] Judea
[1:23:57] the land of
[1:23:58] Israel and the prophet said what did
[1:24:00] those 200 million demons want to do they
[1:24:03] wanted to cross that River to destroy
[1:24:05] the Jews he's always hated the Jews you
[1:24:09] say why does he hate the Jews brother
[1:24:11] Matt is it their dress coat is it the
[1:24:13] long locks that the asdic Jew has is it
[1:24:15] the Hebrew language I tell you what
[1:24:17] brother it's not their language it's not
[1:24:19] their dress code the reason he hates
[1:24:21] them is because God loves them and Satan
[1:24:25] ha that's why the devil hates you and
[1:24:27] attacks you in your home and your family
[1:24:29] and say why am I under such an onslaught
[1:24:32] because God loves you oh that ought to
[1:24:35] make you shout this morning the devil
[1:24:38] can't touch me until my God gives him
[1:24:40] permission to touch
[1:24:42] me and the prophet says they wanted to
[1:24:45] cross that River of Euphrates but they
[1:24:47] were held
[1:24:48] back they were they were restrained they
[1:24:52] couldn't cross my brother says oh but at
[1:24:55] the opening of that those Seven Seals
[1:24:57] what did those Seven Seals
[1:24:58] unlock the prophet of God said those
[1:25:00] seals to Gentiles were the trumpets to
[1:25:04] the
[1:25:05] Jews and under that six TR under that
[1:25:08] Sixth Seal when that tribulation seal
[1:25:11] was broken but the prophet of God says
[1:25:13] when that trumpet sounded it was a
[1:25:16] freedom call not to
[1:25:18] Angels but to
[1:25:21] Demons to rush over that r River and the
[1:25:25] prophet of God says those
[1:25:27] 4200
[1:25:31] million 200 million oh I say all my
[1:25:35] notes but I just want to preach it do
[1:25:37] you realize that the angel the armies of
[1:25:41] Satan have a number but the Bible says
[1:25:44] the angels of God don't have a number
[1:25:48] Hallelujah in other words the armies of
[1:25:50] God are innumerable they're surrounding
[1:25:53] you at all times
[1:25:56] and brother brandom says that those
[1:25:58] demon chargers at that six trumpet which
[1:26:01] is under that six seal say brother Matt
[1:26:04] we're not in the six seal that's your
[1:26:05] tribulation that's right but if you go
[1:26:07] listen to the Feast of trumpets brother
[1:26:09] bam tells you that under that breaking
[1:26:12] of that seal he says that they're
[1:26:14] released an amateur
[1:26:18] tribulation a
[1:26:20] pre-tribulation
[1:26:22] anointing amen you go find that in
[1:26:25] Stalin Hitler ikan musolini you say how
[1:26:29] could those how could those people fall
[1:26:32] under the
[1:26:33] deception of that man Hitler go go and
[1:26:36] listen to artificial intelligence
[1:26:38] they'll they'll take the H Hitlers I'll
[1:26:40] call them sermons because that's what
[1:26:42] they were and they'll take his sermons
[1:26:44] and they put it in his native in his
[1:26:46] tone and his in his voice but they put
[1:26:48] it to the English language it'll send
[1:26:50] shivers down your spine say what was it
[1:26:53] it was an an anointing he didn't realize
[1:26:56] he was under an anointing and the rest
[1:26:58] of the Germany didn't realize they were
[1:27:00] falling under an anointing you say an
[1:27:03] anointing to do what to destroy the
[1:27:07] Jews I tell you what the spirit the
[1:27:10] anointing that this nation has fallen
[1:27:13] under right now and the rest of this
[1:27:15] world is a is a is some of those 200
[1:27:18] million demon Chargers that's why they
[1:27:20] attacked Israel on October 6 last year
[1:27:23] October 7th last year
[1:27:24] you say how could they do that because
[1:27:26] the minds of men have gone crazy and
[1:27:30] they don't know that they've ingested
[1:27:31] those demons as the prophet of God says
[1:27:34] it got on men like Stalin Hitler ikan
[1:27:37] musolini and he says and they went after
[1:27:40] the Jews to destroy them and they didn't
[1:27:42] know they were under an anointing you
[1:27:44] say where are those demon spirits today
[1:27:47] brother Matt the prophet tells us that
[1:27:49] they were released into the fourth
[1:27:51] dimension you say what is the fourth
[1:27:53] dimension brother map well I don't have
[1:27:55] my phone I thought that I did up here
[1:27:56] I'll show you hold up hold up your phone
[1:27:58] hold up your cell
[1:28:00] phone that's the fourth
[1:28:02] dimension brother bam said it's
[1:28:05] science and what do people do today they
[1:28:07] feed and feed and feed and feed and feed
[1:28:09] they don't realize that a prophet of God
[1:28:11] a Vindicated Prophet said this God will
[1:28:14] not destroy this world until the people
[1:28:16] get in the spirit of
[1:28:19] destruction and they don't know that the
[1:28:21] very news media and some of these things
[1:28:23] that you have on entertainment and
[1:28:24] Hollywood listen friends come on
[1:28:27] somebody help me preach this morning you
[1:28:29] be you better be careful what things you
[1:28:30] feed upon because it's those spirits
[1:28:33] that are driving the world out of their
[1:28:35] mind and they're coming under an
[1:28:37] anointing of a six old if they could
[1:28:39] fall under the six seal anointing what
[1:28:41] about a people who come under a seven
[1:28:44] seal anointing and it's not to prepare
[1:28:47] us for Destruction it's to prepare us to
[1:28:50] get out of here one day
[1:28:58] and he didn't
[1:28:59] realize the the prophet of God says
[1:29:02] something so powerful and he's he's
[1:29:04] talking about this human battle and then
[1:29:06] that battle you
[1:29:08] say what's what caused those demons to
[1:29:12] leave the war to leave heaven and go to
[1:29:14] Earth I tell you what happened is Jesus
[1:29:16] cast him
[1:29:17] out and I tell you what will cause the
[1:29:20] war to go to Armageddon is when God's
[1:29:22] bride cast him out
[1:29:24] amen and it's the greatest battle ever
[1:29:27] fought even the prophet of God dealt
[1:29:30] with that pressure just s that me and
[1:29:31] brother Joe how to sh we fellowship and
[1:29:33] about sometimes you go any preacher can
[1:29:35] can can can relate man you go to
[1:29:37] sometimes prepare a sermon and you don't
[1:29:39] even have nothing you've studied for
[1:29:41] days and you feel like you come to the
[1:29:42] pulpit inspiration list now the people
[1:29:44] would never know that but you feel like
[1:29:47] you ain't got nothing some of those
[1:29:48] times that's the greatest sermons you
[1:29:50] ever
[1:29:50] preach when you felt like you didn't
[1:29:52] have nothing but I was talking to
[1:29:53] brother Jo about that I said you know I
[1:29:54] was reading where brother brandham just
[1:29:56] says you know I went down to the
[1:29:57] basement to study and to pray and my
[1:29:58] brain my mind was just a million miles
[1:30:00] away from me couldn't get a thought what
[1:30:03] was it he felt that intense pressure
[1:30:06] it's a time of spiritual
[1:30:08] warfare it's a come on friends it's a
[1:30:11] time of pressure it's a time of
[1:30:14] spiritual warfare the enemy comes in
[1:30:16] like a
[1:30:17] flood and let me just say that those who
[1:30:20] are not sensitive to the war will become
[1:30:23] victims of the war
[1:30:24] War those who are asleep like lot and
[1:30:28] backsliding and cold and carnal in their
[1:30:30] heart you would just become a
[1:30:32] casualty to that six seal
[1:30:34] pre-tribulation
[1:30:37] anointing people who are not sensitive
[1:30:40] if we're not sensitive to the Holy Ghost
[1:30:42] and the Holy Spirit are filled just for
[1:30:46] a moment I watch people on their phones
[1:30:48] in church doing a million other things
[1:30:50] besides listening to the word of God and
[1:30:52] I don't criticize that I say God help
[1:30:54] that brother help me Lord do we realize
[1:30:57] this world has gotten people so
[1:30:59] laxidasical so Out Of Tune and out of
[1:31:02] touch that's for some the only time they
[1:31:04] hear the word of God is sitting on a CH
[1:31:06] church
[1:31:08] pew I don't say that to rebuke you I I
[1:31:11] say to myself to say God help
[1:31:14] us if this is the only time that we're
[1:31:17] tuning into that other dimension we end
[1:31:20] up just like that
[1:31:24] prophet of God says why I got it right
[1:31:26] here before me I'm just going to read it
[1:31:28] brother brandom says that that that the
[1:31:30] reason he says I want to give a warning
[1:31:32] right
[1:31:33] here it says concerning the last days
[1:31:36] that because of abounded iniquity that
[1:31:38] the love of many will wax cold in the
[1:31:41] lady of SE or last age
[1:31:44] self-love and love for material things
[1:31:47] will take the place of the true love of
[1:31:49] God listen to what he says we need to
[1:31:52] guard against the power of sin in these
[1:31:55] last days so many are getting so hard in
[1:32:00] their hearts because they haven't
[1:32:03] realized the effect of this last day
[1:32:09] spirit I raised my hands when I read
[1:32:11] this he says it's time to draw nigh to
[1:32:14] God and let him fill our lives with his
[1:32:18] love or we will feel the coldness of
[1:32:20] this last day church and reject the
[1:32:22] truth of God
[1:32:24] which alone is able to help us you'll
[1:32:26] find that in the thigh tyon Church
[1:32:29] age I I just I can't get past this slide
[1:32:33] and I need
[1:32:35] to because I think of how how this
[1:32:39] condition didn't happen
[1:32:41] overnight because lukewarmness doesn't
[1:32:43] happen overnight it just starts with
[1:32:46] worldly distractions that all of us are
[1:32:48] susceptible
[1:32:49] to the Bible says because of the cares
[1:32:52] of this life that that listen the Bible
[1:32:55] says that because of that they were
[1:32:57] drunk not on wine but on the cares of
[1:33:00] this
[1:33:02] life say what are those cares not sinful
[1:33:05] things I'm just talking about normal
[1:33:06] things that we do on a daily
[1:33:08] basis but people are falling asleep
[1:33:12] their their their their experience has
[1:33:13] grown cold oh it's not what God did for
[1:33:16] you one time listen friends I'm all for
[1:33:19] a one-time experience but it's got to be
[1:33:22] a daily experience
[1:33:24] that we feed every day of Our
[1:33:29] Lives it's the pressure of the age it's
[1:33:32] the darkness pressing down upon people
[1:33:35] dark clouds listen you may not be able
[1:33:38] to see it here today and it looks sunny
[1:33:39] outside but in the spiritual climate of
[1:33:42] leosa it's a dark dismal day because my
[1:33:45] Bible says that it would be it would be
[1:33:48] dark and gross Darkness upon the face
[1:33:50] the knowledge would increase they'd get
[1:33:52] every learning every ever learning but
[1:33:54] never able to come to the knowledge of
[1:33:55] the truth you say brother Matt what is
[1:33:58] it it's a storm but I speak to that
[1:34:00] storm today and I say in the evening
[1:34:03] time it shall be
[1:34:05] light I'm not going to let it consume me
[1:34:08] I'm not going to let it consume my
[1:34:10] family I'm not going to let it consume
[1:34:12] my heart I'm going to speak to that
[1:34:13] storm of
[1:34:18] Le like Joshua fighting in the day of
[1:34:20] battle the Bible says he had ran the
[1:34:22] enemy's back oh oh but he needed some
[1:34:24] evening light brother Luther and the
[1:34:27] Bible says that the light shine what is
[1:34:29] it my brother my sister it's a dark day
[1:34:31] but arise Shine for thy light has
[1:34:34] come he had an evil heart left left I'm
[1:34:39] getting a sound warning the place you're
[1:34:41] in is very loud must mean Jesus isn't
[1:34:44] here brother bandam said everywhere he
[1:34:46] went there's noise I I tell you what
[1:34:49] friends that goes off in every church
[1:34:50] that every sermon I preach it goes off
[1:34:52] not not not that I preach even when I'm
[1:34:54] in the back there and I tell you what
[1:34:56] now I use it as a measure to go if it
[1:34:58] ain't going off something's
[1:35:01] wrong I say our our our our watches
[1:35:04] ought to be sounding an alarm the place
[1:35:05] you are in is very
[1:35:11] loud you people don't have an apple no
[1:35:14] I'm not even going
[1:35:19] there so he couldn't get past it I
[1:35:23] thought about that that do you realize
[1:35:26] lot what Legacy you're going to
[1:35:29] leave what are the consequences of your
[1:35:35] choice lot settles down in the sinful
[1:35:38] city of
[1:35:41] Sodom we know the story is hardships
[1:35:44] after being delivered wasn't ended Sodom
[1:35:47] the Bible says was a very Wicked City
[1:35:49] and even though lot was counted that as
[1:35:51] a righteous man a righteous man didn't
[1:35:52] belong there
[1:35:54] he allowed his family to become
[1:35:56] entrenched in the city and in its
[1:36:00] culture now we've got to walk a very
[1:36:02] fine line here because you're in the
[1:36:05] world but you're not of the
[1:36:09] world remember brother bam said I I it
[1:36:12] doesn't matter I'll just go be with the
[1:36:13] Indians they realize there's bad Indians
[1:36:15] too can't go
[1:36:16] anywhere but you can find a hiding
[1:36:22] plac God God is going to destroy it we
[1:36:26] know that here the angels we read the
[1:36:28] story they're demanding to have lots
[1:36:32] guests who are
[1:36:35] angels no not these were Angels which
[1:36:38] typed the angels that would come in this
[1:36:41] generation now remember brother Bram
[1:36:43] don't get confused brother brandham was
[1:36:44] the SE the seventh Church age messenger
[1:36:47] or seventh angel but the prophet says he
[1:36:50] wasn't not an angel like an Angelic
[1:36:52] being but Angel just means
[1:36:56] messenger and so these were Messengers
[1:37:00] when that messenger came to Abraham two
[1:37:02] goes down into Sodom and the prophet
[1:37:04] said it's a modern it's a type of the
[1:37:06] mzc sign of the son of man in Luke 17
[1:37:10] that would come to the bride but at the
[1:37:12] same time the bride is receiving their
[1:37:15] sign the lukewarm church is receiving
[1:37:18] theirs and he sends a Billy Graham and
[1:37:21] an Oral Roberts
[1:37:24] and the prophet said it was their
[1:37:26] Ministries that were actually
[1:37:29] blinding the
[1:37:31] people from a false light the greatest
[1:37:33] robbery brother Brandon preaches in the
[1:37:35] flashing or the I know a man who could
[1:37:37] turn on the light the greatest robbery
[1:37:38] that ever happened happened in our day
[1:37:40] when they used they robbed a train using
[1:37:42] a false light and the prophet says in
[1:37:45] the greatest robbery the church has ever
[1:37:47] had is when sermons and preachers are
[1:37:49] preaching a false
[1:37:51] light say what is a false light a light
[1:37:54] from
[1:37:57] yesterday you got to walk in the light
[1:37:59] as he is in the light and then you have
[1:38:02] fellowship and the blood of Jesus his
[1:38:03] son cleanses you from all
[1:38:05] sin and actually think about that that
[1:38:08] that light preaching a previous light
[1:38:10] blinded them and here's an angel brother
[1:38:13] bam takes time and I don't have time to
[1:38:14] teach on it Graham g r h M5 and then
[1:38:17] brother Bram takes the last name brandom
[1:38:19] God changed Abraham's name from Abram to
[1:38:22] Abraham why did he do that for Abraham I
[1:38:24] happen to believe it wasn't just for
[1:38:26] Abraham but it was going to be a a it
[1:38:28] was going to be a signpost to
[1:38:32] you about the ministry that would come
[1:38:35] in this generation I was talking to my
[1:38:37] son Gideon I said do you realize
[1:38:39] something so powerful about Billy Graham
[1:38:41] who brother bam types as an angel that
[1:38:43] goes down to Sodom he's these angels
[1:38:44] that Lots with do you know you can go
[1:38:47] Google this if you want to go to Google
[1:38:49] it that that Billy Graham's daughter her
[1:38:51] name is Anne Graham she married a man
[1:38:54] and his last name is
[1:38:59] Lots l o TZ and if you ever click on her
[1:39:03] Wikipedia she's a
[1:39:04] preacher and her homepage is called
[1:39:07] Angel
[1:39:10] Ministries the ministry of an Graham
[1:39:13] Lots I don't think it's an
[1:39:16] accident lot here he is with these
[1:39:18] angels think about that
[1:39:26] you you can't even read some of
[1:39:30] this how did a Christian man not a
[1:39:33] Christian in the sense of of a Christian
[1:39:35] but a Believer righteous man get into
[1:39:38] such a condition the prophet of God said
[1:39:42] even Mrs lot Mrs lot was just a
[1:39:44] reflection of
[1:39:47] lot oh Brothers do we realize that our
[1:39:51] family is just a reflection of
[1:39:56] ourself okay I'll say Amen to it CU I'm
[1:39:59] not talking about just the good things
[1:40:01] I'm talking about all of the bad you got
[1:40:03] a garden and what are you planting in
[1:40:05] that Garden it will
[1:40:08] grow it will grow come on somebody I
[1:40:11] said it will
[1:40:13] grow even David comes to Solomon at the
[1:40:15] end and brings him in the room what's he
[1:40:17] doing he's passing the Legacy Elijah
[1:40:19] with Elisha he's passing Legacy Elijah
[1:40:22] with jehoash he's passion a legacy
[1:40:25] listen friends you will either pass a
[1:40:27] legacy by Design or by
[1:40:31] default but you will leave one we will
[1:40:35] leave an
[1:40:37] imprint we will leave an imprint upon
[1:40:40] those around us whether we want to or
[1:40:43] not we will leave a
[1:40:46] legacy you think about that as he
[1:40:49] brother bam says his wife even sister
[1:40:52] lot
[1:40:55] prophet of God says in time tested
[1:40:56] memorials Miss lot became very
[1:41:00] worldly taken up with the things of the
[1:41:05] world and then I stop at these words and
[1:41:08] he says Mrs
[1:41:10] lot didn't mean to do
[1:41:14] that when she went down
[1:41:20] there
[1:41:22] thought just be
[1:41:24] sociable all right to be
[1:41:29] sociable didn't mean
[1:41:32] to guarantee you
[1:41:35] lot never would have
[1:41:39] imagined that he losed that
[1:41:42] woman that he
[1:41:44] loved he never imagined that it would be
[1:41:47] his
[1:41:48] children later when they leave and lock
[1:41:51] his his daughters they an incest Cal
[1:41:54] relationship have children in the entire
[1:41:56] tribes of
[1:41:58] Moab and and and and you you say brother
[1:42:02] Matt why are you saying that because I
[1:42:03] promise he never sit in the church as a
[1:42:06] Believer he never would have dreamed
[1:42:09] he'd end up
[1:42:12] here never would have imagined he never
[1:42:15] would have thought that he brother brand
[1:42:17] and in in from that time and he deals
[1:42:20] with that little girl and he's there in
[1:42:23] the Psych wward in in in in in Flint oh
[1:42:26] Michigan and he's and and he goes to
[1:42:29] that insane asylum and and brother
[1:42:31] brandham says people just crawling on
[1:42:33] the walls banging their heads against
[1:42:34] the concrete and here's this little
[1:42:37] pretty young
[1:42:39] girl and brother Bram says oh my it's so
[1:42:42] overwhelming he says to her imagine as
[1:42:44] brother bram's there and he's looking at
[1:42:47] that situation saying this is so
[1:42:50] overwhelming and the little girl says
[1:42:53] brother Bram and and brother brandham
[1:42:55] says I don't even know where to
[1:42:59] start and that little
[1:43:01] girl says
[1:43:04] sir I wish you'd start with
[1:43:08] me brother bham says you you're not a
[1:43:13] patient she says yes sir I
[1:43:16] am says no no how you look perfectly
[1:43:20] fine he says I wish you'd let me tell
[1:43:22] you my story story I'm here as a patient
[1:43:25] I've lost my
[1:43:26] mind and the prophet begins to hear her
[1:43:29] story she says I went with the wrong boy
[1:43:31] got the wrong friends that's where it
[1:43:33] always
[1:43:35] starts and and she says he he he got me
[1:43:38] drink and he put something in my drink
[1:43:39] next thing I knew I had lost all of my
[1:43:42] all of my chastity she says I I had I I
[1:43:46] I had she said I I woke up her life was
[1:43:48] just overnight
[1:43:50] ruined and she says I I didn't mean I I
[1:43:53] thought about those words she didn't
[1:43:55] mean
[1:43:56] to she didn't mean to end up there how
[1:44:00] many times I've sat on the end of a h
[1:44:03] and I'm not saying this in any way to
[1:44:04] criticize them but how many times
[1:44:06] especially you don't have it here but
[1:44:07] out west it's in every corner it's been
[1:44:09] that way for years every time you stop
[1:44:11] at a stoplight there's a transient there
[1:44:13] a homeless person sleeping under the
[1:44:15] bridge or holding the sign up beard down
[1:44:16] to here how many times I've stopped
[1:44:18] there and not letting them notice that
[1:44:21] I'm looking and I'll just stare at their
[1:44:22] eyes
[1:44:24] and I'll
[1:44:25] think how did you get
[1:44:29] here how' you up
[1:44:33] there I promise you when you he that man
[1:44:36] was here he is now a beard down to here
[1:44:38] he's probably addicted to some drug he's
[1:44:41] homeless but I promise when he was four
[1:44:44] and five and six he never would have
[1:44:47] imagine he'd be standing on the side of
[1:44:49] a
[1:44:51] street like how did did it in there how
[1:44:54] does it end with lot and his family's
[1:44:57] fleeing took an angel to come out and
[1:45:00] rip him out of that City could never
[1:45:02] break the CT
[1:45:05] himself think how did he get there how
[1:45:08] did it start she says brother bam I just
[1:45:10] drank the wrong thing and I got with the
[1:45:12] wrong boy and the next thing I know she
[1:45:14] said I was I was I was an alcoholic I
[1:45:17] went to the good Shepherd's home went

[1:45:29] a little
[1:45:30] while like lot got delivered out of
[1:45:32] Sodom for a little while but then I went
[1:45:35] right back to it she said and then I
[1:45:36] just became a full-blown alcoholic
[1:45:38] started thinking there was no hope for
[1:45:40] her and so she she says next thing I
[1:45:42] know I was on the street selling myself
[1:45:44] as a
[1:45:46] prostitute and now they put me here and

[1:47:24] the transformative blood of
[1:47:31] Jesus
[1:47:33] he he never would have imagined he got
[1:47:37] there I tell you what brother John
[1:47:41] ostein never would have imagined when he
[1:47:44] was in the prayer line and in the
[1:47:46] meetings with God's
[1:47:47] Prophet never imagine when his wife was
[1:47:50] hilled of breast cancer
[1:47:53] Assemblies of God preacher he'd never
[1:47:56] imagine that that would be his
[1:48:04] legacy modern day
[1:48:08] lot I promise when demon
[1:48:12] shakarian stood there with brother
[1:48:14] brandom at the full gospel businessman's
[1:48:16] meeting and stood with God's Prophet
[1:48:18] even Deus in the Bible who Paul the
[1:48:20] Apostle Paul talks about Deus
[1:48:24] I never I promised Demus would have
[1:48:25] never imagined when he's standing there
[1:48:27] with Paul but one day the Bible says
[1:48:28] Deus Paul says Deus has forsaken me
[1:48:31] having
[1:48:33] loved present
[1:48:36] World never would imagine Demons should
[1:48:38] care and you go on the Full Gospel
[1:48:39] businessman there's a website you go on
[1:48:41] it's powerful go hear the the
[1:48:43] businessman's breakfast you could hear
[1:48:44] brother Brandon you could hear Brother
[1:48:46] Deus get up there and introduce God's
[1:48:48] Prophet now every would have imagine
[1:48:51] though that Deus would one day in his
[1:48:53] life forsake the ministry and walk away
[1:48:56] from the
[1:48:57] message and say he's washed up it was a
[1:49:01] prophet sent to bring healing and now
[1:49:02] he's getting all mixed up trying to
[1:49:05] teach the word he never would have
[1:49:08] imagined that his great
[1:49:12] granddaughters would be the
[1:49:16] Kardashians listen friends when you
[1:49:18] leave this message you are leaving Jesus
[1:49:21] Christ
[1:49:24] you mean to say that I said it just the
[1:49:26] way I meant
[1:49:27] it I would have defended Jesus had I
[1:49:30] lived there I would have never got him
[1:49:31] crucified the prophet says tell me what
[1:49:33] you do with the message of the hour
[1:49:35] which is Christ for your day and I'll
[1:49:38] tell you what you would have done back
[1:49:41] then he never would have me me he never
[1:49:44] would have
[1:49:47] thought the prophet says of Lot's wife
[1:49:49] when God gave her last message of Grace
[1:49:52] those angels down there told them within
[1:49:54] a few hours that Sodom and gomor was
[1:49:56] going to be burned up she could not
[1:49:57] stand the thought of giving up her
[1:49:59] social
[1:50:01] life to come out into a desert she
[1:50:04] couldn't stand
[1:50:06] it that Modern
[1:50:08] Woman couldn't stand to come out to the
[1:50:11] desert to live like
[1:50:13] Sarah out there in the desert to have to
[1:50:16] wear common plain clothes of women in
[1:50:19] the
[1:50:21] plane she wanted to be in luxury her
[1:50:25] husband had become a great man in the
[1:50:27] city he sat at the gate as a judge she
[1:50:30] wanted these luxuries she couldn't think
[1:50:33] about it my brother my sister she
[1:50:34] couldn't stand the thought of having to
[1:50:37] give those things
[1:50:39] up and as she went out with her husband
[1:50:41] she kept looking back weeping and
[1:50:43] grieving because she had to give it up
[1:50:46] to separate
[1:50:48] herself you know what it was she was
[1:50:51] forced to come out and and there's such
[1:50:53] a difference when you force someone to
[1:50:55] come out because you can force the body
[1:50:57] but you can't force the
[1:51:00] heart that's why we received a message
[1:51:02] that didn't give us a body dress code
[1:51:05] and all the outward external but the the
[1:51:07] Bible says it will turn the hearts of
[1:51:10] the children when you turn the heart the
[1:51:11] body turns with it the reason people
[1:51:14] leave this message is because their
[1:51:16] heart was never connected to it and
[1:51:20] eventually the heart leaves long before
[1:51:22] for the body but the body will always
[1:51:24] follow the
[1:51:26] heart and the prophet of God takes time
[1:51:28] to point that out and says she was
[1:51:29] looking back over her left shoulder
[1:51:33] representing her
[1:51:36] heart brother bam says she looked back
[1:51:39] where her heart
[1:51:46] was
[1:51:50] oh but I think of
[1:51:53] another
[1:51:56] man I think of another
[1:52:03] Legacy think did did he ever
[1:52:07] realize did he know the
[1:52:10] imprint or the
[1:52:13] impact of his
[1:52:17] legacy and he's prophesied over and says
[1:52:20] because thou has chosen the Heart
[1:52:26] Way thou has walked in the path of your
[1:52:29] own choosing thou has picked the correct
[1:52:33] and precise I love that thou has has
[1:52:36] picked the correct and precise decision
[1:52:40] and
[1:52:44] it's what way the harder
[1:52:47] way because of this momentous decision a
[1:52:51] huge portion of heaven will await thee
[1:52:54] what a glorious decision thou has made
[1:52:57] oh brother bradam did you realize
[1:52:59] because you were going to be an Abraham
[1:53:01] she was going to be a Sarah and lot did
[1:53:04] you realize because you were going to be
[1:53:05] a lot she was going to be Lot's wife oh
[1:53:08] my brother my sister do we realize
[1:53:10] you'll never have a a Rebecca without an
[1:53:13] Isaac you'll never have a a bride a
[1:53:16] groom without a bride you'll never have
[1:53:18] a bride without a groom and I could
[1:53:20] never be anything if it wasn't for this
[1:53:22] word
[1:53:23] this word changed my life I say thank
[1:53:26] God for a prophet who stood for the word
[1:53:29] of God and didn't compromise for Sodom
[1:53:32] I'm here
[1:53:34] today married to an an Isaac because of
[1:53:37] an
[1:53:41] elaser I think of that did you ever
[1:53:44] realize it was that momentous decision
[1:53:46] this and itself will make come to pass
[1:53:48] play that for me the tremendous victory
[1:53:50] in the love divine go ahead and play
[1:53:51] that you in the back there m if you
[1:53:53] could have that just make sure the sound
[1:53:54] is on I just want to play this I got
[1:53:56] three minutes and I'm going to end it
[1:53:58] right
[1:54:00] here did he
[1:54:02] realize that great momentous decision
[1:54:05] the prophet of God says that great
[1:54:09] momentous decision that a huge portion
[1:54:12] of heaven will await thee what a
[1:54:15] glorious decision thou has made bring it
[1:54:18] over brother Mark and I heard something
[1:54:20] say would you like to see just beyond
[1:54:22] the curtain bring it up I said it would
[1:54:26] help me so
[1:54:28] much and I looked in just a moment
[1:54:33] I
[1:54:35] place I looked back and there I was
[1:54:37] laying on the
[1:54:40] bed and I said this is a strange
[1:54:44] thing now I would not want you to repeat
[1:54:47] this this is before my
[1:54:50] church are my sheep that I am
[1:54:54] pastoring whether it was I was in this
[1:54:56] body or out whether it was a
[1:54:58] translation it wasn't like any Vision I
[1:55:01] ever
[1:55:03] had I could look there and I could look
[1:55:05] here and when I hit that little place
[1:55:09] I've never seen so many people come
[1:55:13] running
[1:55:14] screaming oh our precious
[1:55:19] brother and I looked in young women
[1:55:23] maybe in their early 20s 18 to 20 they
[1:55:28] were throwing their arms around me and
[1:55:31] screaming our precious brother here come
[1:55:35] young
[1:55:36] man in the brilliant of Young
[1:55:40] Manhood and their eyes glistening and
[1:55:43] looking like stars on a darken night
[1:55:47] their teeth as white as
[1:55:49] Pearl and they were screaming in
[1:55:52] grabbing me and
[1:55:54] screaming oh our precious
[1:55:58] brother and I stopped and I looked and I
[1:56:02] was
[1:56:04] young I looked back at my old body
[1:56:06] laying there with my hands behind my
[1:56:10] head and I said I don't understand
[1:56:13] this and these young women throwing
[1:56:16] their arms around
[1:56:17] me now I do realize this is a mixed
[1:56:20] audience
[1:56:22] and I say this with the sweetness and
[1:56:24] with the melness of the
[1:56:27] spirit man cannot put your arm around
[1:56:30] women without uh a human
[1:56:34] sensation but it wasn't
[1:56:38] there there was no yesterday or
[1:56:42] tomorrow they didn't get tired they were
[1:56:46] I never seen such pretty women in all my
[1:56:50] life they had a hair way down to their
[1:56:53] waistline long skirts to their feet and
[1:56:57] they were just a hugging me it wasn't a
[1:56:59] hug like even my own sister sitting
[1:57:01] there would have hug me they were not
[1:57:04] kissing me and I was not kissing them it
[1:57:07] was something that I I have not got the
[1:57:12] the vocabulary I haven't got the words
[1:57:14] to say perfection wouldn't touch it
[1:57:18] suburb wouldn't even touch it nowhere it
[1:57:21] was something that I never you just have
[1:57:23] to be
[1:57:25] there and I looked this way and that way
[1:57:28] and they were coming by the thousands
[1:57:30] and
[1:57:31] stuff and I
[1:57:33] said I don't understand
[1:57:36] this I said by they and here come
[1:57:40] hope that was my first
[1:57:43] wife she run and never said my
[1:57:46] husband she said my precious
[1:57:50] brother and when she hugg
[1:57:53] me there was another woman standing
[1:57:56] there that hugged me and then hope
[1:57:57] hugged this
[1:57:59] woman and each one and I
[1:58:02] thought this has to be something
[1:58:05] different it can't be there's something
[1:58:08] I would I ever want to go back to that
[1:58:11] old carcass
[1:58:13] again I looked around there and I
[1:58:15] thought what is
[1:58:17] this and I looked real good and
[1:58:20] I I said I I can't understand this but
[1:58:23] hope seemed to be like uh oh a guest of
[1:58:29] honor she was no different but just like
[1:58:32] a guest of
[1:58:33] honor and I Heard a Voice then that
[1:58:36] spoke to me that was in the room said
[1:58:39] this is what you preach was the Holy
[1:58:41] Ghost Hallelujah this is perfect
[1:58:47] love and nothing can ere without it
[1:58:52] I am more determined than ever in my
[1:58:56] life that it takes perfect love to enter
[1:59:01] there there was no jealousy there was no
[1:59:04] tiredness there was no death sickness
[1:59:07] could never end there mortality could
[1:59:10] never make you old and the they could
[1:59:13] not cry it was just one Joy oh my
[1:59:17] precious bre and they took me up and set
[1:59:20] me up on a great big high place
[1:59:24] and I thought I am not dreaming I'm
[1:59:26] looking back at my my body laying down
[1:59:28] on the
[1:59:29] bed and they set me up there and I said
[1:59:32] oh I shouldn't set up here and here come
[1:59:35] women and man from both sides just in
[1:59:38] their Bloom of Youth
[1:59:40] screaming and one woman was standing
[1:59:43] there and she screamed oh my precious
[1:59:48] brother oh we are so happy to see you
[1:59:51] here
[1:59:54] I said I don't understand this and then
[1:59:57] that voice that was speaking from above
[1:59:59] me said you know it is written in the
[2:00:02] Bible that the prophets were gathered
[2:00:04] with their
[2:00:06] people and I said yes I remember that in
[2:00:10] the scriptures said well this is when

[2:00:17] said then they'll be real and I can feel

[2:01:24] not we'll go in according to your
[2:01:28] teaching I said oh I'm so

[2:03:30] place and I looked
[2:03:32] around I said are you awake honey she's
[2:03:35] still asleep and I thought oh
[2:03:39] god oh help me oh God never let me
[2:03:43] compromise with one word let me stay
[2:03:46] right straight on that word and preach
[2:03:48] it I don't care what comes or goes what
[2:03:51] any body does how many SS of Sons of
[2:03:55] Kish rise how many this that other let
[2:03:59] me Lord press to that
[2:04:03] place all fear of
[2:04:06] death I say this is my Bible before me
[2:04:09] this morning I've got a little boy there
[2:04:12] four years old to be raised I got a
[2:04:13] nine-year-old girl and a
[2:04:16] teenager that I'm thankful for that's
[2:04:19] turned the way of the Lord
[2:04:22] amen God let me live to bring them up in
[2:04:27] the admiration of
[2:04:28] God and above that the whole world seems
[2:04:32] to scream to
[2:04:35] me 90y old women and man and all kinds
[2:04:39] if you hadn't have went we wouldn't been
[2:04:43] here God let me press the battle yes but
[2:04:48] if it comes to dying I am no more it
[2:04:52] would be a joy it would be a
[2:04:56] pleasure to enter from this corruption
[2:04:59] and
[2:05:01] disgrace if I could make up
[2:05:03] the 100 billion miles
[2:05:07] high a square block and that's perfect
[2:05:10] love each step this way it
[2:05:13] Narrows until we get down to where we
[2:05:15] are
[2:05:16] now it would be just merely a shadow of
[2:05:20] corruption
[2:05:22] that little something that we can sense
[2:05:24] and feel that there's something
[2:05:27] somewhere we don't know what it is oh my
[2:05:31] precious
