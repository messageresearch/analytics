TRANSCRIPT
========================================
staff and concessions every everyone has made a sacrifice and spent their money and and given their time to come see the Lord move in your lives and so let's give a hand appreciation to them just a few announcements make sure to come down to the concessions area and check the lost and found there's a number of items I don't know how there's shoes down there but apparently some of you young men with big feet are walking around barefoot not sure why sweatshirts and bibles and all kinds of stuff please please check there because the logistics of sending it back it's impossible we will we'll just have to to donate it if if you don't come and claim it so um please clean up your dorm and throw all the trash away help your help your counselors with that check thoroughly for anything left behind in your dorm as well again whatever's left behind is going to be donated um if you have a shirt or a hoodie that you purchase before camp and never received it let someone at concessions know and they will get it to you we do have a couple that have still not been claimed unfortunately there's no hot food left today in concessions but concessions will be open for a couple hours after church be sure if you want to get something to get get there right away because we'll be in the process of packing everything up and and and heading back to Beaufort um there uh to to just wanted to say to our counselors who are here if there's any that have technical expertise will you see brother Matthew Watkins after service for a plan to assist with taking down the the AV Equipment and so forth um so once again I want to remind you see me after service if you'd like to get baptized we're going to try to have a baptismal service at 2 45 and we'll we'll announce that for sure via text if we're going to be doing that so far we had the one baptism that happened the first night I laid into the night um and I think that's it brother Matthew God bless you let's all stand to our feet you can all be seated take your seats God bless you Give the Lord a hand clap of Praise Hallelujah amen I just want to say a few things just being Sunday morning our last service that we have how many have enjoyed the presence of the Lord throughout this whole camp Camp Ground amen praise the Lord I tell you what I just really don't have any words I really don't I'm you say that as a cliche but you it don't really have any words um to express uh last night and how the spirit of the Lord moved in such a special way and throughout all of the services the night before that all the way from the beginning not as all I can do is raise my hands and say thank you Lord for being mindful of us here and visiting us Faithfully every single service we just were so blessed tremendously my brother John and brother Josh both how many have appreciated these brothers that have came and labored amen and the word for you thank you amen I so appreciate that well I hope you all had a good time at the Beaufort weight loss Camp I mean the Bethel Tabernacle camp or the calf building or thigh building camp see some of y'all going up and down that uh down that Chapel Hill man you get you're ready for you're ready to for church when you get up here not a not a tired bone in your body but uh we're so uh thankful for all of the brothers who have assisted and helped with everything we will be having Camp again Lord willing uh next year unless the Rapture takes place and if not we'll all be at one big youth meeting uh in the sky and I'm looking forward to that day I also just say I love and appreciate you know it's it's amazing uh how many it's such a such a um a needed necessary burden for brothers to have a heart for our youth and the generation that's living in the world that we're living in we support all of the youth camps and the brothers we send our kids to them and I think every single Camp ministers maybe to you in a different way or the Lord speaks to you I'm just thankful we got Brothers all across the states all across the world that have a heart and a burden for young people to minister to them because they're facing the greatest battle ever fall and let me just say his brother John Andy said we're right in that same battle with you I might be up on a stage and you might be down there but in reality I'm right down there in that seat right with you on Monday fighting the devil just like you are and we all need each other we all need one another and we need the different various Ministry gifts that God has given to the body to encourage us um there is uh I was asked by two or three people already where they where they can go to see the Camp videos we have the skip video we have different videos of people um go on the swing and going down the swing and screaming all the way up and all the way down and all the way up and all the way down that was my mom doing that she was the first girl on the swing and she was screaming the whole time and uh and so we have those videos just different videos that maybe we have our church website our YouTube and Facebook different platforms where you can go and see the archives of the services and the skits but also we have a Bethel Youth Camp is that what it's called Brother JD Facebook uh bethelyouthcamp.org also the website where we are posting where we'll be posting little videos you might see yourself um I hope you were smiling and happy um on those videos but you might see your cell phone there we got we took some special ones and we're going to be uploading those and and so you can find those online videos of kids dancing and singing in the spirit and having the joy of the Lord last night I just uh I couldn't believe just I took a video I almost wanted to play it today at the bonfire last night and then the night before that and last night there was young people and a brother brother Cade was singing uh he picked me up turned me around and all the young people just praise the Lord and I stepped back I thought you know most of these young people are 18 or 15 to 18 to 25 right at that they are right at that age where if you if you measure them to the rest of the world here they are at a bonfire and they're worshiping and praising and singing and jumping and dancing before the Lord and I thought you know they're the 0.00001 of the entire world of the same age group there are other kids who are in college they're at a bonfire they're partying and drinking but here we are worshiping the Lord drunk in the Holy Spirit Hallelujah and I thought what a victory these young people facing hell every day of their life and I just thought who in the world could ever criticize that who in the world could ever say a negative thing of that we got young people who have the joy of the Lord and want to worship God I jumped right in there with you and felt like a young person again how many appreciate brother Diggs Hallelujah [Applause] amen use brother Diggs in a special way at that bonfire service there for us and I just appreciate all the brothers if I start naming different names that will get in trouble to forget somebody but just so appreciate all the ministry that we've had this weekend and the we will be having Camp again Lord willing as we said next year and and the worship team as I just want to say a thank you to brother Tony who's wore multiple coats uh this weekend

hand [Applause] praise the Lord God bless you today I wanted to just step up for a few minutes before we end this wonderful wonderful weekend and just bid you farewell till next year and maybe I'll see you in between that all of my young people I certainly better see you amen Wednesday night amen but we hope to see if y'all want to show up Wednesday night at our church you can we won't be able to seat you but we you can still come but we're very happy and I just love how everything has went and I I have said you know I've had a couple people say you know you know are you preaching are you going to preach and I said man I would like to but the way we did me off okay so y'all need to you need to protest and uh and so I said um yeah you know I it's a it's a fact that um probably your age group has rapidly become my favorite people to preach to I said I would rather preach one Youth Camp than preach five sets of regular meetings because so I'm going to keep preaching yeah now I'm you want me to whack it like okay if if if all else fails whack it yeah and so uh so it has really become my my favorite group to preach to I appreciate your Zeal Your Enthusiasm your uh quite magical to me I just know it's this the hand of God has done it I'm sure you can hear I feel like I've preached I've done enough shouting and screaming and Hallelujah and wanted to blow through the roof and land in the lake a couple of times but my it's been so thrilling the word of God and I I think I'd like to give a round of applause to our two ministers brother Josh and brother John amen and all of our teams and we have a lot of them we have uh there's so much that goes on in the background that you don't have you don't know you don't have to worry about it it's sight unseen but things get done to make to make this Camp experience uh go good for you and the experience we want you to have is not an entertainment experience or a recreation experience but a god experience amen because you know it is God who drew you here and uh it is the Lord who's really the only one who can really do anything for you of Eternal value we can treat you nice and uh we can you know like you and you can like us but eternally it's going to take the Lord to do that for you because there you have to be reached in your soul and that's an area we can't reach I can patch you on the head I can rub your feet and make your body feel good I can I can you know tell you and give you a pep talk and make you feel really good psychologically but to reach the soul that takes him that takes him that takes the word and so we I just wanted to say how very glad I am to have you all I saw this the other night but I was in the back a little obscured I wanted to see it myself how many were here last year raise your hand goodness gracious okay put them down okay so now how many this is your first year wow praise the Lord so y'all last years y'all did a good job on selling it praise the Lord I appreciate that so uh this is our second annual I hope we never have to do another one I hope we're in the Rapture but if we're not the Lord willing we'll be right back here next year and we would love to have all of you again and um you know I want to we're going to to take up an offering in just in a minute and uh and I just wanted to take a few minutes to thank everybody that's made this possible and I can assure you I have been the least contributor it's been a wonderful time for me just to come and be among you and be an observer like you and just pull on the the word of God now I gotta want her to announcements and then I want to come to a couple other quick things and I gotta hurry because Anthony will be pushing on me but but I want to just make an announcement quickly on behalf of all the counselors in security detail there are there's a a pretty good amount um we're getting reports that there's sweaters and hoodies and other garments and even some tech stuff some tablets and things that they have found and so I'm I'm about to get your money I really don't need your items so you need to get your items because don't use that as your offering we're gonna we're gonna get your cash for the offering today so you need to get your items amen and they will be in the lost and found area but that really that's just to tell you they'll be at concessions now you need to know we cannot will not be mailing anything out if we find it and we can find somebody that wants it we'll give it to them it won't get mailed back to you so rummage through your things make sure you've got everything and make sure you take everything because we you know the camps they'll just discard it so we'll try to find a usage for it but what you need to know is you won't be able to get home and say hey can you package up my it's my favorite buddy can you send it to me and we'll say that is on a somebody that we found on the street and they are wearing your hoodie so make sure if you want it you go get it um just a little bit of word and I'm going to need your help and I'm gonna I'm gonna try to really encourage you to in to really go back and take a message back to your parents who probably paid your bill and if they didn't they signed off on you coming or all of the above however you got here this Camp is as far as we know the most expensive Youth Camp in the message I remember back in the day way back in the day there used to be this this television anyway it was a commercial and the the sign was a Curtis Mathis the most expensive television in the world and worth it and I used to go wow someday and then I thought wait a minute you're a Christian what do you want with the TV I don't want a TV but it just impressed me to think man that's bold to say now we are the most expensive but we're worth it you know um this this Camp um because of the facility that we chose we wanted a facility that really would just be over the top and we wanted you to be able to come and have fellowship and you know I want you to know that in my mind your fellowship one among another is half the value the other half to me is that you're coming for the spiritual feast and the food that you're going to get you're breaking natural bread together and spiritual bread together and I just think that is amazing and we thank the Lord for it this Camp is quite expensive for us to rent and we rent the entire thing and they tried to lift our price from last year and we said hey we are already have the highest price in our in our movement and we cannot raise our price and so you're going to have to hold the line raise it on everybody else but leave it the same for us and they did but I can tell you friends I'll just give you a number camps like this at least this Camp runs about ninety thousand dollars to get don't whack it what is it well I'm doing that it still says on okay don't touch okay don't hold it like that all right antenna gate or something so but this Camp runs and that's that's pretty conservative um some of our estimates uh put it up near 100 Grand a year that's with the facility that's with all these golf carts that you've almost got run over by that's with all the the campers that's with everything and so our registration helps to pay for the base costs of the camp but then all of the extraneous expenses and we and we certainly want to make sure that our ministers who have traveled here uh and labored we want to make sure that we know the Labor's worthy of is higher and we want to make sure we're able to give them a very nice offering and thank them for coming and so I just want you to know that we we take up offerings and that's just to help you help us to lose less money because we don't even break even we don't even break even it's not uncommon you might not hear that but if anybody anytime they run a camp I remember years back in the day and the Lima Family Camp they routinely lost ten thousand dollars a year so these are real numbers and you're adults and so I want to give you these real numbers and let you know that that your money is going and the offerings that we take here and the registration you pay I wish we could do it for free that is the absolute truth but we we need your help so go home and make sure your parents know it was money well spent will you do it wait half of you'll do it we do it amen amen now I I want to come to something just before I sit down yesterday I stood in the back and I I almost had no words for what I saw that skit that sister Deborah Jackson everything that you saw happen came out of her head everything the entire the concept the the lines the scripts everything it was a hundred percent from Sister Deborah amen and I I told her I said Deb that's that's got to be one of the best kids I've ever seen in my life and the whole concept I stood back there and one minute I was shouting next minute I was crying next minute I was shouting next minute I was crying I wanted to run I wanted to flip I didn't know what I wanted to do but it was thrilling to me and I appreciate all of those who participated in that amen and we for this this is our you weren't here the first year brother Larry were you no no sir no so but they we had them here this year and I am so appreciative of their contribution I'd like to give that whole Ahoskie assembly around the prize today amen and I would I would I would I would deeply thank publicly the LaFontaine Brothers but because they're lafontaines they get accolades all over the world already so we'll just say thanks for being here guys appreciate it amen amen so will you stand to your feet and we're going to brother Branham said no service was complete without without an offering so we're going to ask you one more time help us will you and uh we're we're hoping again and we always have post-production meetings to figure out what we could do better what we need to change and we're always open to your suggestions amen don't ever think you can't make a suggestion amen so don't forget now look for your stuff if you have left anything behind please get it and when you when you see sister Deborah out here in the yard make sure all 400 of you shake her hand and let her know how thrilling it was Sister Deborah is my goddaughter her and her sister my two goddaughters and so I love them both dearly and we're we're just so appreciative of of what they contribute amen we're going to sing bring brother Anthony back uh where'd he go oh he ran on me oh here he comes come brother Anthony I think that's all my announcements I needed to make amen praise the Lord Brother God bless you yeah let's do that let's let's pray over the offer let's bow our heads father we thank you very kindly Lord for this group of young men and young women we thank you for all that you have done Lord this weekend what a banner weekend it'll be a Hallmark Lord no doubt for many they'll go from here saying it was it was at that Bethel Youth Camp where I finally planted my I drove a steak down and from that hour as a prophet said from that hour from that time from that moment my life began to into an order of ascending and I've never stopped ascending and one of these days it's going to lift me right off the Earth father we commit them into your hands for the coming word we commit your servant into your hands for this offering that's being taken up may you bless it you know Lord you know right well it'll go straight to the expenses of the meeting which are large but we love doing it Lord and we want to do it if you tear your coming yet another year we plan to be back here again next year and I pray that everyone that's here could be here again and their testimony will be I'm further up the road brother Jason than I was a year ago I'm more I'm closer to God I'm I'm more rooted and more grounded in the truth and the love of God we love you for that Master I pray your blessing be upon the balance of our day in Jesus name God bless you friends we love you in the Lord Jesus and God bless you amen may be seated we're gonna get Caitlyn Brown to come and give us a song Hey man hey Caitlin come here [Music]

well last night or is that a bad question to ask at a church service we're supposed to be honest amen God bless you let's turn to Zachariah we'll go right to the word zachariah's at the end of the Old Testament just before Malachi we appreciate everything that's been said and done this weekend I think some have already may be clocked out because it's almost lunch time but do we have a little time for the word I feel pressured because of the time so let's just ask the Lord to help us today just to speak what's on his heart and not in my notes per se but what he would have to say I don't want to say too much it's time to go but we do want to let the Lord just end his last closing comments that would be appropriate heavenly father just as we've sang as we've prayed as we've been with one another and spoken throughout this weekend such a wonderful atmosphere and presence has been we just pray that you would cap off these meetings Lord and give us closing comments and lingering effects of these services father we don't know when we leave these grounds and we all drive out what will happen when we cross over that line and drive out maybe turn right and going down the highway we don't know Lord what will happen ahead but we commit that to you we do desire your personal presence Lord to speak to us one more time before we leave settle our hearts if there's any sick care that you would just cause a healing to come over them strengthen them we're so thankful for last night and the moving of your spirit and the healing for all of us Lord Lord let us have patience for one another whatever you're doing in someone's heart we want to be sensitive to that today but the spirit of Christ get in the word now and fill each one of us in Jesus Christ's name and everyone said Zechariah chapter 4 verse 6. then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord and to zerubbabel saying not by might let's read that part all out loud together not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts and it speaks in verse 7 about this great mountain and how it would become a plane and that The Headstone which is Christ would come down shouting for the group of young people Grace Grace that's what we've all heard double Grace are we here today you know you all we've had a long weekend but if we're going to squeeze things in you're going to have to help today amen can we do that don't worry I was up till 1 30 in the morning too amen so we didn't come here to sleep so we came here to to get in the spirit so that we can uh just hit the channel are you thankful for Grace moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this message this house his hands his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts had sent me unto you the verse 10 the first line is where we're taking our thought today for who hath despised the day of small things or other ver other versions of this same scripture would say despise not the days of Small Beginnings despise not the days of Small Beginnings can you turn to First Timothy chapter 4 verse 11. isn't his presence so wonderful he's just so wonderful to us First Timothy chapter 4 verse 11 and 12 and you sounded so good why don't we read these verses out loud together Paul speaking to brother Timothy that was a young man in the message these things command and teach let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the Believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith and impurity verse 12 says let no man despise thy youth and I want to take that out of Zechariah despise not the days of Small Beginnings and let no man despise thy youth we want to speak this morning on where are you going where are you going after we end these meetings and and even our future where are you going God bless you you can have your seats and the brothers could bring up our first slide yeah I see someone falling this morning I see them falling down through a place where it seems like there's no bottom to it it seems like a place and they catch themselves because they had been living before but now they're in another place called the regions of the Lost and they're falling and they cry out oh no I'm lost and they just begin to think about their life that they lived on earth because they have been raised in the message they actually were the son of a minister but now they've come to a place and it's very sad to say this almost a paradox that you could be in this kind of frame of mind falling through a dark place but they're actually laughing it's a hideous laugh of discomfort as they're falling falling into this regions of the Lost and they begin to think about when they were living and why that why didn't I respond when I had the chance why didn't I respond at the altar call see it wasn't funny then it wasn't a moment that they were just that they could reach back for we can't roll back the tape today we're speaking about where are we going because it's very important as a young person to make decisions why we're alive and this young man is falling he's falling into a place and why didn't I respond when I had to call I helped my father and so many prayer lines so many times of services and meetings and I was actually very close to him and helped him I saw miracles with my own eyes I actually saw blind eyes come open I saw deaf ears people that couldn't hear just come open in a moment I saw people that were crippled started walking again I saw people that were dumb start talking and and being able to speak again I was there I I saw healings I'm a personal Witness of healings and miracles even shoutings I mean so many meetings I was in how many services have we heard how many songs have we heard sung and as he'd just be falling and even people raised from the dead I remember them coming back to life again and he I was personally able to see the angel of the Lord it's pretty incredible this young man in this state and his life that he had lived and to see the angel of the Lord and he begins to think where did I fail after all of that after all of this where did I fail why didn't I respond appropriately in that season I mean you know today there's a lot of people that are always looking to put an excuse or put a blame on why they're in their place and but she was honest he said it it wasn't my father's fault it wasn't my mother's fault it wasn't my upbringing even though I had a very rough upbringing my first mother my mother she died when I was just very young my father had to raise me as a little baby with a bottles under his arms to keep them warm at night and I remember one time looking out in the clouds and seeing a cloud go by and crying out to my daddy is is Mommy up there did Jesus take my mommy and this is all flooding through his mind as he's falling and falling and he's into this place but I can't give excuse because of my upbringing I actually started smoking when I was a young man I was drinking I was gambling which was illegal there in Indiana and Ohio and Kentucky it was illegal it became so bad my father made me live and moved to my grandparents house but as he's falling now and going through this he's beginning to think of how he was raised and how his father had to travel so much in the ministry see his father had sacrificed his youth to minister to other young people and other families and other churches in the message and this young man but he didn't use that for an excuse that his father had taken the gospel to many others he actually it became very personal what is my excuse and you begin to think about how he would saw a lot in the message because he was very close to a lot of things in the message he had seen a lot of hypocrites he had seen a lot of liars seen a lot of fakes and things that had happened in fact some of those that were close to his father's Ministry it turned out to be homosexuals it's incredible how men and women can be so close to the real thing and be so lost it's amazing how men and women can be all around the moving of the spirit and right around where God's doing great things and yet be lost and be far away from God and have a profession and yet be so empty but I have no excuse why am I in this place why am I in this dilemma and we're going to hear in just a few minutes by God's Amazing Grace God brought this young man out of that place and saved his soul somebody say praise be to God thank you Jesus now if we would go to our next slide here and we begin to see Zechariah Chapter 4 I want you to just listen real closely and quickly in your heart as the Bible begins to speak about this Grace Grace that came in that time but it was also a prophecy of our time in verse 10 the prophet prophesied about who hath despised the day of small things who have despised the days of small things in other words don't despise the days of Small Beginnings I'm thinking of you today young people I'm thinking of you even as we go home from this camp and what God had started a good thing in our lives but the lingering effects and just excuse me for my voice is straining it was already gone before the prayer line last night be perfectly honest aren't you glad for the Holy Spirit but the lingering effects of these type of services should be a further consecrated life with Jesus Christ it should be something that lingers long after the last beat of the drums or the last song special or the last goodbye and the text from our friends and the testimonies begin to come in days after the meetings there the lingering effects should be something that sticks much closer than just the noise of the crowd and the voice of the minister it ought to be a daily love relationship with Jesus Christ I was listening to brother Branham as he prayed one of his last prayers with a group of young people and it was I spoke to Rebecca Smith Branham about this certain service come follow me and I called her when I was a young person and ask her and she described the setting and her friend Marilyn was also graduating and it was in a home and you can hear that and come follow me after the seals brother by Adam's closing the service and it's like he cried out Lord Jesus youth men and women for tomorrow if there is a tomorrow we must train them Lord we feel that burden to train them like there will be a tomorrow if there is not then today is the day now that was 1963. that was after the Angels came down and after brother Branham said publicly I remember what was said about and especially about the young people now he's praying with young people he's given them his last prayer and he's speaking about the youth and how that there was a burden on his heart to train them to speak a word that would would not just be for the moment but it would carry carry on into the days and months and can we say the years to follow that there would be another generation raise up that would say though I wasn't in that room though I never knew him as a as a man as a prophet but I know the Lord Jesus Christ I wonder how many people in this room today can raise your hand and say you're thankful for that type of a message old and young alike that would come to us and say despise not the days of Small Beginnings and when we look at the next slide and conceive First Timothy chapter 4. this is now Paul picking up the words in in the New Testament these things command and teach to let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the Believers he wasn't talking to the older generation he's talking to young people he's speaking to you today how many open up your Bible and read it like it was God speaking to you now how many do that I wow about a quarter of you how many open up your Bible and read it like it was God speaking to you I want to speak to you like that today let no man despise your youth but you be the example of the Believers in word and conversation that's your behavior in your charity or in the love of Christ in the message in the spirit in your faith and in purity you carry the torch young people you be the reason why God sent a prophet don't drop the ball don't drop the Baton and when you look at these words let no man despise it means they will condemn you they will seek to disdain you and to look down on you they will think little of you or nothing of you you're just nothing daily they look on you with disdain they think you're a horrible person I feel like shouting this out I know you're quiet this this morning it's almost this afternoon but there is a spirit today that thinks the young people are just horrible they're doing bad they're they're just slowly they're little and we've heard from two scriptures and I'll add a third one in Titus Chapter 2 verse 15 Paul speaking to Titus let no man despise thee they will but don't let it affect you when Paul said let no man despise your youth that doesn't mean when people despise you and disdain you and think you're too little and you're too young to do anything that you're supposed to stop them and you know text back and email back no no that's not what he's saying let no man despise your youth that we're supposed to get all militant our last service before we all go back home is like a Jihad of the young people of the message and that's not what he's saying Paul Was preparing the new generation for what would come that they will disdain you they will despise you because you are a youth because you are younger because you are littler I'm speaking to someone today and because you're just beginning in your Christian Life or because you're smaller not just physically but spiritually they will speak negative about you but I'm here today to speak to your hearts don't let their attitude affect you I'm speaking the message I'm speaking what Zechariah said I'm speaking what Paul said I mean speaking what William Branham said don't look down on yourself and Friends it really starts from ourselves and every age every age bracket is is a Afflicted with certain spirits that try to cause them to become non-effective and and we're living in a day where Satan is pushing down and trying to stop your voice I think it's amazing the very thing that we've been raised up for and trained to do when it comes to that time of you being manifested how quick you're squashed how so quick you're disdained and looked down on and that's exactly what Paul was saying don't let that happen to you just because you've just started the racer just been saved or received the Holy Spirit just because you are beginning don't be moved by the negative we live in a very depressing age in fact depression is a global pandemic for young people the anxieties and pressure of the day that we've been called to live in it's more than any other age do we all agree so don't let the despising of Satan when you're when it's your time to rise it's your time to be manifested that you allow spirits to come in to try to cancel what God's called you to do it's very real they call it a cancer culture that's in the world it's in politics it's in business that if someone's rising up you just speak negative about them you slander them and because we've been around longer and in an establishment you know all the startups and all the youth and the new generation just stop them it's if they're coming across different than the way you they just squash you cancel you they want to pull the plug on you today the holy spirit is saying that because that same spirit will creach right creep right into the message amongst carnal message believers and will sense to squash your life squash your testimony seek to cancel out what God's called you to be and I'm here today to encourage you as your brethren Christ let no one despise your youth [Applause] as we speak now and go a little bit further we've got to move along this we spoke about the regions of the lost I want you to remember they can't get out but you can they have no opportunity to roll back the tape and put their car in reverse and come back down look out Lodge we can't do Saturday night over again we can't sit here Saturday morning and see a skit of our peers and brothers and sisters that labor to bring across the message and that is that if three Hebrew children can do that then so can you that's what I heard that's the message I heard and Friends it it's gonna be the word that gets us in the rapture it's going to be the word that we receive as young people and feed on daily when we leave this Camp that's going to give you rapturing faith and my heart is stirred again today because I believe a true evidence of a true experience and an encounter with God will be manifested after the great weekend the real evidence of an experience with God is after the meetings if you want to really know whether the experience that you received was really real and truly from the Lord how do how does it cause your life to live when you go home and I know this is different I know we're not clapping I know we're not standing but these are the final words before we go out there friends and face our fire and face the rejection and face what all of us are going to have to go through as Believers there's got to be an experience that keeps us not just during the meetings and when we're with our friends and [Applause] God help us today to really not question our experience but really ask ourselves as we come into the last part of the message and the ministry that you would say the third pool or look at Jesus's Ministry and how he demonstrated his life at that season when she was rejected when he was crucified when brother Branham came to the end of his ministry in third pool and end of his life when ten thousand of his friends left and when he moved to Arizona and they didn't even want to have him come preach in their churches they had squashed him out they they had really canceled him we don't want you we don't want your message and families in the message were being raised up that had little boys and girls and they were riding their bicycles around on Sunday morning and they didn't have a home church and brother Brandon was so happy when brother Perry green opened up his church so that our children aren't riding their bicycles around on a Sunday in other words we're so happy that the word can meet them at this time of their life and they can receive strength and we can be together but brother Branham had communion and within weeks he's in a a tragic we would say accident but it was God saying this generation is ready the message is ready to make it without the prophet being alive it was a global declaration and nobody liked it no one in the message liked it no one agreed our Prophet our Prophet where do we go from here but God like pulled the plug and he said no it's time for there to be churches all over the world it's time for there to be youth groups and meetings and services all over the world let's take it to Africa let's take it to China let's take it to Europe [Applause] what we were speaking about earlier was actually brother branham's son brother Billy Paul Branham and I have a photo here on the screen and I just want to go through this just a little bit that maybe it'll affect someone as you see the next slide this photo was taken in 1946 and Billy Paul at this age would have been about 11 years old and the next slide you see he would have just fit right into a South Carolina youth camp brother by Adam was talking about that in Oregon in the next slide and he was talking about Billy Paul when he was 14 years old and you can read what's on the screen but before I sent him down to the Bible school he was in the common school and did not have a very good background all the children girls and boys smoking and carrying on you say what did Brother Branham do when he found out his teenage son was smoking you can see in the next slide he moved Billy Paul it's about a 13 or 14 hour drive from Jeffersonville from Indiana to Waxahachie you can see on the right hand side I'm sorry you can see North Carolina where brother Josh is from you can see South Carolina where we are in Tennessee where some of you are in Kentucky where some of you are from you can see different places out even to Arizona where some of you are from but watch where brother Branham moved his Sundown too when he realized his son was smoking he talks about it like this further in that message when my boy Billy about 14 years old before I sent him down to the Bible school and he was in the common school and did not have a very good background all the children girls and boys smoking and carrying on and one day I came into the house and sat down Billy was staying with his grandmother and while the presence of the Lord was near there was a vision I seen my boy with a cigarette in his hand and that like to killed me so after a while his bicycle stopped out front and he came in and said hello Dad and running through his arms around me and I took him in my hands and I said Billy when did you start this he said what Daddy he said I said smoking he said I don't I I said don't tell me you do smoke Billy and he started crying I couldn't keep from it brother Branham said I went on down to the bathroom and I sat down out there and I cried like a baby and I thought his mother and glory and last thing she said to me take care of Billy and here I've tried to put the example before him to see him do a thing like that it almost killed me so I took him out on a walk and I said son you're coming away from there right away right now I'm I'm gonna send you to Bible school no matter how Lonesome you get and I said I want you to stretch out your arms like this and he did he said what's the matter I said this is left and this is right and you cannot be going both ways at the same time you're in the shape of a cross and I said as long as you're going to going right you may think you're going wrong but you've got to come out right you can't go east and west at the same time you can't be doing right and wrong at the same time and he goes on to speak about that sometimes people are going wrong thinking they're doing right and it'll wind up wrong no matter it goes on to talk about that your duty to God how did Brother Branham deal with these things with his own family when his own son here I have a picture of the very that's amazing brother Brandon would preach so much against Bible schools and colleges and he sent his own son to one and he wanted Rebecca his daughter to go to Ashbury College in Kentucky I just think that's amazing you can see this very place I just wanted to make it more real is this okay today this is the actual place this is where brother Branham sent his teenage son trying to help him trying to realize that he's in a place this is his mother and father and little sister next slide and brother Branham goes on to say it like this a dose of Medicine almost killed my boy this is another message come let us reason together I just somebody say thank you Jesus amen I was in my room on Friday or Saturday and I was just asking the Lord what message I should listen to what message out of the whole message to prepare my heart just for the weekend and this was the very message that he put into my heart I started listening to it it was after Friday night because I I needed just confirmation that this morning was the way he wanted me to go and it came across this very quote and I thought Lord that's in my notes come let us reason come let us reason together let's talk about this I mean where are you going you say but we've had great meetings and I've seen Miracles and I've seen a people that were dead like this week dead and last night they came alive I mean I heard a testimony as I'm walking in here of a young man that his father had never seen him raising his hands and and yesterday he's racing his hands and [Applause] and you know there's a relationship that happens spiritually between the older generation and Young Generation when we all begin to surrender to the Lord that doesn't always have to be a Clash and the transition in the time of and I'm going to go to that and just after this but in the time of passing off the Baton is usually when it's dropped and the message is in a time of transition but it always doesn't have to be just hitting heads and like where are you coming from and if it is sometimes when we're with people like where are you coming from we just need to ask the Lord to help us because sometimes it's not always the way that you're looking at it is the right way let me give you an example how many know that we're at a youth camp at a youth camp the music is faster there can be drums on the platform there's a lot of noise but if we would have a seniors couples meeting weekend there probably wouldn't be drums on the platform they'll probably even be loud music the last scheduled event would be eight o'clock they're all they're shutting down good night everybody good night everybody they don't have a bonfire at 10 o'clock they're not up to one in the morning they have no struggle turning out the light at 1 30 saying with you please shut off the light they're already gone the lights are out and right and there's no 7 30 rise and shine it's we'll just get up and have coffee I'll see you at 10 o'clock you know I'm not speaking negatively I'm just letting you know that young people are different we think different the new generation's different and if we're not careful that can be a Clash it can be a breakage in a relationship it can cause a young man to want to run away it can cause a young lady to pant for Freedom so much that she wants to go she'll crawl out her window she'll literally crawl out on an upstairs window and go down and go out with her boyfriend or her friends we're young people I'm speaking to young people that's not a sin it's not wrong for a young lady to desire a young man or a young man to desire or have a thirst for a young lady that's not sinful and sex is not bad sex is not evil but there's a time that you wait until you're married that is the right time and fornication is not of God fornication if you look up the word in the scripture is actually purnia pornography and it's it's Satan by the World Wide Web has achieved his Global gospel and he has pulled in The Souls of men and women and he has sold them for nothing and he will walk them up and throw them into a corner after a midnight fling and after you know following your pleasure and and take your virginity and there's no remorse he'll just move right to the next person he'll put a shot in your alcohol and you thought it was a Coke and you're just having a good time in a simple little dance and a simple little party and a simple and it'll ruin your life and plague you all the way to the time that you're married and have grandchildren and have the Holy Ghost God help all of us and it was in that season of a brother that had a lot more opportunity and in the presence of God than than you and I ever had or will he was right next to his father he was he helped him in the prayer lines he he was at altar cause one time brother Branham got permission that Billy Paul would see the angel of the Lord and brother Branham had a pillow over Billy Paul's head how many know this is true and he said can I let him see the angel of the Lord and because he helps me in the meetings and he said now Billy I'm going to take this pillow off your head and when you look he's going to be standing right over in that corner about two or three years ago Billy Paul got into a habit got running around there and that's the reason I had to send him to Waxahachie to the school our public school with a bunch of little boys and things and all smoking cigarettes and things and Billy come up home one day and said how are you getting along Daddy and I seen a vision pop over him now I know that we're speaking at a youth meeting but we do have adults here and some fathers and mothers that will come later grandparents but let me say something if brother branham's family had these same issues going on and he was the prophet to the age I think all of us need to just recognize that Satan is no respecter of any person [Applause] you say well if brother Branham was a good father if brother Branham had a good mother media came along and and was brother branham's second wife after sister hope passed away but he'd say well if he was a good home if they would have went to a good church if he would have been in a good atmosphere I don't know how much better you can get than a prophet being your father then do you think one of our young people could not just be tempted but actually go there do you think that we're so spiritual have we become so in our in our minds uh made such a culture in the message of what church you go to or who's your pastor do you go to these certain type of meetings or who's the preachers have we made that such a culture that we would be so naive to think that someone that could be around the supernatural so close you know what it is today people don't want to admit it people don't want to admit that there's issues in their family they don't want to admit that our young men or our young lady or the even older ones parents aren't willing to say I am wrong they're not willing to say father and mother when we were married that wasn't our first time to be together so you shouldn't be talking about these things at youth meetings or especially the last service we're supposed to have a rah-rah and let's all leave on a high note we are going to leave on a high note we're going to leave with a type of service that is affecting you Tuesday and Thursday and two weeks from now you're gonna say oh God so they were smoking in things and and a vision popped up over Billy Paul next slide I said come here a minute I talked to you he said what is it Daddy he didn't say oh man he Oh Daddy I know Dad like I've been around I've been in the meetings so he got into a habit got to running around and things he lied to his father he said I'm not when he why are you smoking cigarettes I'm not I said don't lie to me Billy and he commenced to crying well he said I won't do it no more daddy and he went on out he kept on doing it and he he wasn't hiding it he can't hide it no no so I seen a vision and the Lord showed me that Billy had disobeyed me and had jumped through a window and was La going laughing Head Over Heels like that down through eternity turning over and over that's how we started the service he's going over and over and he's falling into this place and when I came out of the vision I was screaming boy we need some of that passion back into our our lives and in our families when one of our loved ones or one of someone that's been in our prayers and we see them going wayward it ought not to be well they're not part of our group well you know you know you always reap what your sowing the way the transgressor is hard and yep they're just reaping until it's your friend until it's your brother your sister come on friends I'm sometimes we can claim to be so spiritual and we fail to Face Reality where the rubber meets the road and when he came out of the vision when he came out of the vision of really where they were at he didn't say oh bless God you know he saved he's my son he goes to the Branham Tabernacle you know he'll be there when he came out of a vision he was screaming oh God oh God I wonder sometimes if we just catch a little glimpse of something that's going on that we just kind of change and go into a fast song and we kind of change the subject when really that was the very moment the still Small Voice was trying to reach down through all the noise of your life I wonder friends if we have substituted the still small voice of God with loud music or I don't really want to talk about it or they're part of our group so it's okay you know they're in our church so it's okay but if it's another church down the road it's like oh that's horrible that's so bad let's tell everybody shame on us that's not the spirit of Christ the spirit of Christ would be oh good where are those that sigh and cry boy this is a real young people's message today isn't it where are those that sigh and cry he's screaming this is a growing man and a minister he's screaming to the top of his voice so I told Billy and Billy that day he went fishing been hanging down on the river a lot and there was a man from India there to meet me see ministers and things went down into New Albany with my wife that's where Brother John Andy's was born as a New Albany he just went right down into this place and he was going to be with these ministers and she had to go down there and something to know we went down and I was sitting talking to the ministers and all at once something said to me get out of here right quick and I thought that was just my imagination I said well now Brethren were fixing to go to India we're fixing to you know have these meetings and so forth and something said get out of here and get to yourself oh that would be a good message for all of us today it's in the it's in the quietness when we're all alone that we can hear the still small voice of God and turn your cell phone off just turn your device off for a few minutes God wants to talk to you how many think it would be fantastic of all of us when we left these meetings we just fell in love with Jesus and if God would give us another year that we just come back just it was just such a wonderful year of in the presence of God how many would appreciate that oh yes get to yourself get to yourself so I got out of the car and and I said excuse me brother and just a minute I want to go around the corner and I went around and I looked and nobody was looking I said father what is it I said go to Billy Paul at once and I run back real quick and media was coming up the street my wife and I said hurry honey hurry something's wrong with Billy and we run and jumped in a car and it took out to Jeffersonville about five or six miles and I went into the yard my mother-in-law's standing in the yard screaming the top of a voice saying Billy's dying got him in the hospital I said what happened said well he came up there and he had a sore throat and he was afraid you were going to catch him with that sore throat and tell him he was still smoking cigarettes and he went down and got your good friend the best doctor there is in the nation one of the best Dr Sam Adair and gave him a shot of penicillin and he swelled up about that big in just about three minutes and he ran up there and they wrapped him in blankets and rushed him into the hospital and I run out real quick and here come the doctor down like that and took off his hat and said Bill I've killed your boy I said oh doc surely not and I run into the room and they had oxygen over him and everything and pumping and giving him adrenaline over his heart I thank God had another future planned for brother Billy I believe this very morn very day October here God allowed this testimony for some young person saying you don't have to go to this place [Applause] I'm giving you a warning I'm giving you a solemn warning we can be in great meetings we can be in prayer lines we can have the Holy Spirit moving all around us and have blind eyes come open right around be in cabins and have counselors spend thousands of dollars and have home movements and 90 to 100 000 spin we say that's incredible well God will do everything for just one of you to get the message God bless you some are having to leave but can I just have a few more minutes I think my sister Heidi Davis is here are you here sister Heidi is your daughter here where is Sister Davis she's right here this young lady sang this morning and she's tall and beautiful brother John was with her when she would just fit into my hand born premature in a hospital in Seattle and we came after a Saturday night service and we come on a Saturday Friday night service and come on Saturday and sister Davis is now she would fit right into my hand and all the wires and all the tubes and everything aren't you so happy God had a plan that looked Way Beyond that little baby in her hand God bless you today but here's Billy Paul now and he's in a place an adrenaline is over his heart and a heart going on down and down and I just could I be with him a moment so he just walked out of the room that was the doctor walked out of the room and I knelt down I put my hands on him there's something about contact if I would have had another message to preacher I probably would have spoke on the power of touch it is so incredible when Jesus touched when the woman touched the border of His Garment the power of touch friends we need to be together we need to encourage one another we need to get into the game I'm speaking spiritually he said dear God please hasn't my heart been broken enough in my days please Jesus oh God give the boy another chance Lord please I ask you with all my heart as your servant if you'll spare the life of my boy he's so good to me and helps me in the meeting he's so loyal to me I need him God please don't take him I ask you not and I looked and I saw a vision of him falling like that and turning over and over like it was a couple nights before that when I seen him in the vision and I've seen that we're coming to the climax I've seen two big arms come out and catch him two big arms come out and catch him like this [Applause] and started burying him right back up going right back up like that and I raised up and Billy turned around just as black as he could be and his lips swelled way out and his eyes turned red and turned back we ought to thank God for a predestinated seed today because Marilyn Monroe Marilyn Monroe came to this exact moment raised in foster homes in orphanages didn't know her daddy her mother's beating her head on an insane wall she's trying to be popular she became a sex symbol to the world and she's on all kinds of drugs and medications laying in a bed and and she's just going through the motions and she's married three times now she's divorced again this is the third time she's all alone and she's weary it's like is there more to life than this and her heart started being and she's reached for the phone and she's gone the world thinks she died of suicide a prophet saw her by vision reaching for the folk she's gone God she could walk through here today passed our brothers back there the security team and she comes walking down the aisle and we gave her a microphone for five minutes I think she would be like you don't want to go there you don't want to be there she had money she had all kinds of things that don't go there and here's a young man in the message that could have went the same way and they could have had a service and he could have had a tombstone in Jeffersonville Billy Paul Branham well I wish I had more time I really do I was raised in that same Tabernacle my best friend was the Deacon son my best friend was the pastors it would be nephew and and growing up this was the person we would go to his home we would go to his house I have all kinds of memories and but when he came into High School it became popular he became on the student council and it became out there in the Branham Tabernacle and he got his truck and he got all of this and but one day he just went to a place and took his own life I'll never forget it being in the Branham Tabernacle my they took buses and buses of all the friends all the people from the high school and they just packed out the place never forget it and going up to the same Cemetery where brother William Branham is buried and having his mother fall over the casket and say but you never said goodbye I'm so thankful that God had another story and God has another story for your life [Applause] it doesn't have to end like that and let my voice ring through this building through the internet and I hope in eternity every person's on the right side I hope unto Josh these Services aren't having to be played again in the regions of the lost and any person here didn't make it that's why we say things to the risk of being misunderstood and not to be popular but if it's the truth he said daddy where are you daddy standing right here honey boy we need to talk to one another better don't we I'm standing right here honey it's all over now I'm in let me tell you if it hadn't been for God a dose of medicine would have killed my boy let's just put

passed between one each member of a relay team I was going to show you and speak about this I was going to move along I'm receiving the Baton I was going to speak to you about passing the Baton and receiving the Baton I was going to speak about what it means and on this relay team and then now spiritually what it means that each succeeding generation receives the Holy Spirit and until that Rapture I was going to speak about every generation every succeeding generation I was going to speak about the Holy Spirit in the next slide it's for every generation I was going to show you this is the Olympic team and this is how they we talk about the responsibilities of the runners and how there's a way to pass it off there's a transition that happens and it's usually during the time of transition and Junctions that are the most critical and crucial is usually when it's dropped that's usually when people stumble that's usually at the turning and the age the Turning of a corner I'm in the next slide next slide brother Matt I'm even moving through I was going to speak about these things brother country Diggs this is one of his favorite quotes about drinking in and pushing out drinking in pushing out you remember that brother Cadre I remember you preaching on that where Pentecost failed and I wonder if there would be a warning where in the message people are failing I don't have to be another Camp I guess I was going to speak to you about receiving the Holy Ghost and these I was going to speak about Jonah and where are you going Jonah this could be for somebody give me 20 seconds or 30 on Jonah God called him to Nineveh and he went to Joppa and took a ship to tarshis can you all see on the screen how far it was yeah where are you going after this Camp I mean I got the holy I had to meet but you could be making the most horrible mistake you ever have in your whole life and God is trying to say where are you going look at this way out there to torch it somewhere where is he going and and God prepared a great fish and brought him back I was going to show you on the screen some of the things that is coming upon the Earth and how the world is preparing for a tribulation I was going to show you these images and then show you Armageddon in Book of Revelation that there's been promise to be these things happen and brother Branham talking about nuclear things and I was just reading in the last few weeks how they said just the um when a nuclear bomb goes off and it flares out and then the tsunami will kill Millions I was going to show you images like this and how the world is preparing for its destruction I mean where did they get even the producers to think of this next slide is in Seattle why did they even think of water going into cities like this it's because they're anointed for distraction I think it's October 30th is that the right date today tomorrow they call Halloween we're going to drive out of here after a whole weekend of Glorious meetings right back into hell before you get to the town you're going to see schools and bones and devils and people trying to act like something they're not it's all a cover and what used to be

like this thank God that we can apply the token Hallelujah thank God for ministers that will give us the the pertinent parts and just say it the way it is would somebody talk about music Somebody talk about relationships brother Branham did nobody wants to talk about it it seems today but brother Branham said it when he was a pastor he would take a Sunday with the young men and speak about sex and things and he said I take the next and speak to the young ladies to curb these things out that's what your Prophet said we don't want to talk about it we don't want to use the word from behind the pulpit but I'll tell you what friends if this new generation is going to make it there's got to be some men that have enough courage to just say it [Applause] I was going to speak about this and I had this for years on my office wall for years it was a constant daily reminder of our young men and young ladies at the crossroads of their life and how that our boys has got ten times the Temptation that we had and sisters do you realize that your daughters has ten times the Temptation you had when you as a girl it's true I know it's not easy being a counselor at a camp where people come from all different churches and different standards of dress and living and things God bless all of you counselors I wish I could have been out here to see your faces God bless you counselors you've been a real heroes he talks about pastors and brothers and blushing prophet he talked about my I wonder how many ministers would set talk like this about their prayer life and them being guilty we're guilty we're all guilty I wonder how many pastors would say that today how many ministers will be that real we've got to move along here and talk about the Holy Ghost I was going to put it in front of you but these are some of the images in the Rapture brother Brennan was talking about thus saith the Lord and California in leadership he talked about an earthquake that would come and speak about Hollywood and Los Angeles sliding into the ocean California you're doomed not only California but you the world you're doomed and here's a a quote out of the church age book The Last in seventh Aid
