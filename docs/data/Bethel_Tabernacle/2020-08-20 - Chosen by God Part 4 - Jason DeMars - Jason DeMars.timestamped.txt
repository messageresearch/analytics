[31:14] as it's written The Riches of your grace

[31:21] so it's so rich it's so overflowing it's
[31:25] so abundant
[31:26] to us Lord and we're so thankful
[31:30] for that Lord even when we when we sin
[31:34] Your Grace abounds not that we
[31:38] desire to walk in sin and live in sin
[31:41] Lord but it's the reality of the nature
[31:44] that lies within us
[31:46] there's there's still sin there and we
[31:49] do sin but it's your grace oh God

[32:23] we commit the service and the word of
[32:27] God into your hands we ask that your

[32:57] word
[32:59] just commit ourselves to your Jesus name
[33:01] amen
[33:02] God bless you you can be seated I'm
[33:06] going to start out with a brief missions
[33:09] report
[33:11] just a little update
[33:13] um
[33:16] so this is brother
[33:19] Omid with his family his wife sister
[33:22] sanes and their daughter
[33:25] Andia there he's the pastor in kaiseri
[33:29] turkey and he's the one we've had
[33:32] several prayer requests about in the
[33:34] past
[33:36] um just regarding his uh
[33:38] immigration situation
[33:40] just if you haven't heard I'll just give
[33:43] you a brief
[33:45] understanding of it brother Omid was uh
[33:49] in Iran was arrested and he he was tried
[33:54] and convicted of
[33:57] crimes against National Security in in
[34:00] their country basically he was a
[34:02] Christian and and converted from Islam
[34:06] so he was sentenced to five years before
[34:08] they arrested him he fled the country
[34:11] and then probably a year later his wife
[34:14] joined him in Turkey he's been in Turkey
[34:16] now for seven years
[34:18] and um
[34:21] they've gone through this Refugee
[34:23] process
[34:24] and it's now in the hands of the Turkish
[34:27] government it used to be in the hands of
[34:28] the U.N
[34:30] he was approved by the U.N and was set
[34:33] to come to the United States until our
[34:35] immigration program completely changed
[34:38] with the new Administration that came in
[34:41] and so he's been kind of stuck there
[34:43] ever since and as a result the Turkish
[34:47] government took over immigration cases
[34:50] thank you and they've been uh
[34:53] basically just denying the the refugee
[34:56] cases and so there are of course cases
[34:58] that people aren't really under
[35:00] persecution they're just fleeing for
[35:01] economic reasons but omitus genuinely
[35:04] was persecuted and if he were to return
[35:07] to Iran it would be long-term prison
[35:10] sentence and torture a very very
[35:13] difficult to uh circumstances for him if
[35:16] he were to be brought back there so they
[35:19] canceled his immigration process
[35:21] canceled his
[35:24] um all of his documents his
[35:25] identification Insurance everything so
[35:29] his wife has a heart condition and
[35:33] different things it was miraculous that
[35:36] their daughter was born and she was
[35:37] perfectly fine but no insurance for them
[35:41] so they're facing a lot of difficulties
[35:43] also always before them is are the
[35:46] police going to come just pick me up and
[35:48] put me on an airplane to go back to Iran
[35:50] by God's grace brother nehemiah's Church
[35:55] in Canada has been willing to help and
[35:59] sponsor him
[36:00] to to come to Canada they have a little
[36:04] bit less stringent immigration policies
[36:07] there so they're going to go through
[36:09] that process on the meantime he needs
[36:11] he's gotten an attorney uh in in Turkey
[36:14] as well that's helping them to try to
[36:17] get uh go to the court and get his
[36:20] identification and insurance restored
[36:23] but it's a huge time of stress he can't
[36:26] leave that City
[36:28] so that's also difficult a difficulty on
[36:31] my end because he's my translator
[36:33] so if I if I were to go to Turkey I
[36:35] basically would just be there with him
[36:37] in that City
[36:40] um
[36:40] for now so and I may do that this fall
[36:46] seeking the will of the Lord if you want
[36:47] to go to the next one
[36:50] this is Brother Petros he is Iranian but
[36:55] he lives in Hamburg Germany now he was
[36:59] just recently I believe it was in
[37:00] through the month of July the whole
[37:03] month he was in Turkey
[37:06] visiting several cities and churches
[37:08] there
[37:10] mostly he was just doing visiting people
[37:13] one-on-one because they were still they
[37:15] still did not have their serve the
[37:18] ability to do their open up their
[37:20] services again so he was just meeting
[37:22] people at coffee shops and restaurants
[37:24] and um
[37:26] at people's homes and uh event went very
[37:30] well but he's I think he's still on
[37:32] because he had to fly back to Germany
[37:35] he's still on quarantine now should be
[37:37] coming out in a couple days being able
[37:40] to come out of quarantine in Germany
[37:43] um from what it sounds like in Turkey
[37:44] they have all kinds of rules in place
[37:47] about wear a mask do this but nobody
[37:50] follows them and they're not really
[37:51] enforcing forcing them it's just I think
[37:54] it's mostly just so they can tell the
[37:55] International Community oh yeah we have
[37:57] mandatory masks oh yeah we we on our
[38:00] flights everybody has to wear a mask but
[38:03] the reality is no one's enforcing it but
[38:05] Germany is more strict and so he's had
[38:08] to stay in quarantine for quite a while
[38:10] and that's been pretty difficult on him
[38:14] um go to the next one
[38:17] this is brother megaly there with
[38:19] holding the microphone he's
[38:21] uh Pastor in Cairo Egypt and they they
[38:26] didn't have Services I think from March
[38:28] middle of March
[38:30] through just
[38:31] um
[38:32] just recently last week they had their
[38:34] first service last last Thursday so
[38:38] they're really excited to have that you
[38:40] can go to the next screen I think that
[38:42] show some of the people there
[38:45] um keep them in prayer we're continuing
[38:47] to work on getting the Supernatural
[38:49] series
[38:50] printed it's all translated now getting
[38:52] edited it'll all be printed there and I
[38:57] think
[38:57] go to the next one
[39:01] oh
[39:03] boy that not all the words came through
[39:06] go to the next one
[39:08] uh
[39:10] yeah
[39:12] back to that one with the David
[39:13] Livingstone just I wanted to give a few
[39:16] inspiring missionary quotes to you but I
[39:19] guess I I the Lord worked it out that I
[39:21] would just be giving you one
[39:24] so David Livingstone if you remember him
[39:26] he went into the heart of Africa and
[39:28] faced all kinds of difficulties and
[39:31] trials there but this was one of his
[39:33] quotes and I it was it's inspiring to me
[39:36] touched me sympathy is no substitute for
[39:40] action
[39:41] you know the great the Great Commission
[39:43] is not an option for us to consider but
[39:46] it's a command to be obeyed
[39:48] and sympathizing with the Great
[39:52] Commission is no substitute for taking
[39:55] action and being obedient to the Lord
[39:57] and sharing your faith with others
[40:01] so I think uh we're gonna go to the
[40:04] other
[40:06] um PowerPoint I'm wondering if it's
[40:08] going to be cut off so we may need to
[40:10] pull that up Just Right In
[40:11] PowerPoint but with that said we're
[40:14] going to turn in the scripture as he's
[40:16] pulling that up we're going to look at
[40:19] Jude 1 verse 4.
[40:21] great
[40:25] let's stand up as we read
[40:35] for there are certain men crept in
[40:37] unawares where before of old ordained to
[40:40] this condemnation
[40:41] ungodly men turning the grace of our God
[40:44] into lasciviousness and denying the only
[40:47] Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ and
[40:50] the next scripture is second Peter 3
[40:53] verse 9.
[40:54] the Lord is not slack concerning his
[40:57] promise as some men count slackness but
[41:00] is long-suffering to us word not willing
[41:02] that any should perish but all that all
[41:05] should come to repentance amen and if
[41:10] you just want to blank that screen out
[41:12] for me for the Joel you can be seated
[41:14] so just a reminder this is
[41:17] chosen by God as my subject and this is
[41:20] part four I'm sure everyone has perfect
[41:22] recall on part one two and three
[41:26] foreign
[41:28] not even I do so I'm sure you don't
[41:31] we'll spend some time reviewing a few
[41:34] things but uh in this particular one
[41:38] I want to speak
[41:40] about
[41:42] um
[41:43] something we would call Double
[41:44] predestination
[41:46] that's what we'll start out with and
[41:48] then we'll start then we'll look at
[41:52] eternal security
[41:53] and perseverance of the Saints so those
[42:00] two subjects are really closely tied
[42:01] together
[42:02] of course they all are dealing with
[42:04] predestination and election
[42:07] but
[42:08] um if you want to bring up that quote
[42:12] God will not
[42:14] take as anointed and you cannot
[42:16] impersonate that office
[42:18] God anoints he chooses who he Wills he
[42:21] condemns who he Wills it's God that does
[42:23] the justifying it's God that does the
[42:25] choosing and he raises it up go ahead go
[42:29] ahead and
[42:30] I'll blank that out again
[42:34] so when we're looking at these
[42:35] scriptures we see that God
[42:38] from all eternity elects some to
[42:42] Salvation
[42:43] and some to condemnation
[42:47] and this is a this is a teaching
[42:50] that
[42:52] the human flesh the human will the human
[42:55] reasoning doesn't appreciate
[42:58] doesn't enjoy it rubs up against our
[43:02] Notions of justice and fairness
[43:06] unfortunately our nose Notions of
[43:09] justice and fairness are perverted
[43:13] by our lack of understanding of
[43:16] scripture by by the very nature that we
[43:18] have within us that we're born with
[43:21] and so as that's why the Bible says we
[43:23] need to be transformed by the renewing
[43:25] of our mind
[43:27] you know we don't just come into this as
[43:29] as
[43:30] believers who are born again of the
[43:32] spirit and we just understand everything
[43:34] and we're okay with everything we have
[43:37] to go through a cleansing process and
[43:40] that's in our that starts in our mind
[43:42] our mind as our mind is renewed then our
[43:46] heart
[43:48] our heart follows suit
[43:51] you know our our emotions
[43:55] are reasoning our imagination our
[43:58] conscience those five inlets when we're
[44:01] born of the spirit of God he begins to
[44:04] take control from the soul
[44:06] and little by little our mind is
[44:09] transformed
[44:12] but God does choose from all eternity
[44:15] some to Salvation some to condemnation
[44:19] he has Mercy on some
[44:22] and the Bible says on some he hardens
[44:25] them
[44:26] but I want to think about this the work
[44:29] that God does in doing that is not the
[44:32] same for both
[44:34] I want to explain that
[44:36] God positively works
[44:40] Grace within the heart of the elect
[44:45] he called he calls them
[44:47] he justifies them
[44:50] he glorifies them you know that's God's
[44:54] positive will his action towards us to
[44:59] change us
[45:01] but then
[45:03] on the other side
[45:05] God actually serves Justice
[45:09] to us he he he's not unjust to us he
[45:14] simply gives Mercy to us but to those
[45:18] the those we would call The Condemned or
[45:20] the reprobate he simply leaves them
[45:24] to Justice
[45:26] he leaves them to his
[45:28] uh
[45:30] his just Wrath he gives them what they
[45:33] deserve
[45:37] for the non-elect he get he he leaves
[45:40] them to their fallen nature
[45:42] now you know people look at that and say
[45:44] well God hardened Pharaoh's heart God's
[45:48] now responsible for sin
[45:51] you'll you'll hear that said
[45:55] many times I heard it in philosophy
[45:57] classes theology classes people that do
[45:59] not believe in predestination want to
[46:02] prove that your point is wrong about
[46:03] predestination
[46:05] God hardens Pharaoh's heart therefore
[46:08] God is responsible for working evil
[46:11] inside of pharaoh not true
[46:15] he leaves them to Divine Justice they
[46:18] themselves already have a hard heart
[46:20] you're we're all born with a hard heart
[46:24] we don't have to work ourselves into a
[46:26] hard heart it's just there that's the
[46:29] nature we're born with that's what Adam
[46:32] passed on to all of us
[46:36] and so
[46:39] he leaves them just to Divine justice
[46:41] but I want to know I want you to notice
[46:44] Romans 1 18. through 32 speak of it I'm
[46:48] not going to go into detail just there's
[46:50] so many scriptures that I have to cover
[46:52] tonight but in verse 24 it says that God
[46:57] surrenders them to impurity
[47:00] he surrenders them to impurity why they
[47:04] already had impurity
[47:06] and so he's he sees they're continuing
[47:09] in impurity they don't they don't see my
[47:12] deity manifested in creation all around
[47:16] them they don't receive the Gospel
[47:17] they're rejecting it therefore God sees
[47:21] that and he surrenders them
[47:24] now up to that point in time perhaps God
[47:27] was had a restraining Grace upon them to
[47:30] prevent them from going any further
[47:33] but in that point in time it says God
[47:36] gives them over to the lusts of Their
[47:39] Own Heart in other words he surrenders
[47:41] them
[47:43] he says I take my hands off
[47:45] I'm giving you over to impurity
[47:49] through what the scripture says through
[47:51] the lusts of your own heart and through
[47:53] the desires of their hearts so what is
[47:57] God simply doing he's saying I take my
[47:59] hands off so Pharaoh's heart was already
[48:02] hardened God hardened his heart further
[48:04] how
[48:05] he stopped restraining pharaoh
[48:08] he just let him go and and the increase
[48:11] of his heart went continually to
[48:14] hardening and hardening and hardening
[48:16] the elector given Grace
[48:20] the reprobate are given Justice and
[48:23] they're left to live in their own sinful
[48:26] and hardened
[48:28] nature
[48:30] so that you know that's really God you
[48:32] know God is not under any obligation to
[48:36] give us Mercy
[48:38] he doesn't have to give Mercy to anyone
[48:41] no one has ever been the victim of
[48:44] Injustice with God
[48:47] no one has ever been
[48:49] God is
[48:50] perfectly just
[48:53] perfectly holy
[48:56] he's full of grace he's full of Mercy
[49:00] as the scripture says he's not willing
[49:04] that any should perish
[49:07] but I want you to notice what he says
[49:08] he's long-suffering to who
[49:11] it doesn't say to everyone
[49:14] Peter says he's long suffering to us
[49:16] word
[49:19] he's long-suffering to the elect
[49:22] he's not willing that any of the elect
[49:24] elect should perish but that all should
[49:27] come to repentance
[49:32] again God doesn't have God isn't
[49:35] obligated to anyone
[49:39] we we have never done anything that we
[49:42] need to God needs to repay us
[49:45] everything that we have belongs to God
[49:48] everything that is on this Earth belongs
[49:50] to him there's nothing that's outside of
[49:53] his control
[49:55] outside of what belongs there's nothing
[49:57] that doesn't belong to him already we
[49:59] can't get we can't give to God something
[50:02] that he didn't first give to us
[50:04] so he died he doesn't owe us anything
[50:08] we owe him everything
[50:13] and he's always perfectly just
[50:15] Ephesians if you want to pull up that um
[50:18] scripture Ephesians 1
[50:20] verse 13 and 14.
[50:24] in whom you also trusted
[50:27] after that you heard the word of Truth
[50:30] The Gospel of your salvation in whom
[50:32] also after that you believed you were
[50:35] sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise
[50:37] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[50:40] until the Redemption of the purchase
[50:42] possession unto the praise of his glory
[50:46] in the next scripture
[50:49] and grieve not the holy spirit of God
[50:51] whereby you are sealed until unto the
[50:54] day of redemption
[50:59] so the
[51:01] the receiving of the Holy Ghost
[51:05] the true genuine baptism of the Holy
[51:08] Ghost which brings the new birth
[51:11] is the down payment from God
[51:14] of our inheritance what is our
[51:16] inheritance
[51:17] a new body
[51:20] a new world
[51:21] ruling and reigning with Christ
[51:25] so
[51:27] do you think God can give a down payment
[51:32] and then change his mind
[51:36] the Bible says God never
[51:39] repents
[51:41] am I a man that I should repent or the
[51:44] son of man that I should lie
[51:47] God never repents God never changes his
[51:50] mind God
[51:52] Malachi 3 it says I am God and I change
[51:55] not
[51:58] so if God gives a down payment to to you
[52:01] and I he'll never change his mind and he
[52:05] will bring you to the Redemption of the
[52:08] purchase possession
[52:10] why will he bring you to that place of
[52:12] the Redemption of the purchased
[52:13] possession unto the praise of his glory
[52:18] God takes his glory very very seriously
[52:24] it's at the very center of everything
[52:26] that he does
[52:28] so you think that God is going to lose
[52:30] you somehow
[52:33] it's who he is
[52:37] it reflects upon him
[52:39] his life his his purpose if he loses you
[52:43] he's no longer omnipotent
[52:47] and we're sealed until that the day of
[52:50] redemption
[52:52] there's a there's there's a purchase
[52:54] price been paid and there's nothing
[52:56] going to stop God from doing it in you
[53:01] if you want to pull up that quote
[53:06] Jesus said all the father has given me
[53:09] will come to me and no man can come to
[53:11] me except the father draws him
[53:13] all that comes to me I'll give them
[53:15] eternal life and raise him up at the
[53:16] last day there's none of them lost I
[53:18] lose nothing because no man can can
[53:20] pluck them out of my father's hand who
[53:22] gave them to me next one
[53:25] oh my Saint John 5 24 he that heareth my
[53:29] words and believeth on him that sent me
[53:32] has eternal life and shall never come to
[53:34] the Judgment but has passed from Death
[53:36] To Life
[53:37] that's why this church believes in the
[53:39] security of the believer well you say
[53:43] now brother Branham I guess once in
[53:44] Grace always in grace that brings a lot
[53:46] of disgrace but when a man or woman is
[53:49] born of the spirit of God old things
[53:50] have passed away all things have become
[53:53] new next one
[53:56] do you mean to tell me that a God the
[53:58] infinite God would come down and give
[53:59] you eternal life knowing that he was
[54:01] going to lose you
[54:02] savior here knowing he's always going to
[54:04] lose you there what did he save you for
[54:06] why he's working against himself next
[54:08] one
[54:10] now the infinite God who could tell the
[54:12] end from the beginning and the Savior
[54:14] here this week annoying next year you're
[54:15] going to backslide and lose you
[54:18] next one
[54:21] okay black that out
[54:26] it's got It's God's
[54:29] purpose and plan to preserve you
[54:34] to the end
[54:35] and we'll see we'll see that we'll look
[54:37] at that more closely as we go forward
[54:40] that there's a it's not just as brother
[54:42] Jason said on
[54:44] Sunday God is not just pushing you
[54:46] through a pipe on one end saying oh nice
[54:49] job you overcame
[54:52] no that's that's not it and yet God has
[54:55] us God has promises for us and he also
[54:58] has conditions that are put in the
[55:01] scripture that need to be in our life
[55:04] so I mean it goes along with faith and
[55:07] works if you have genuine faith
[55:10] and genuine faith is not something you
[55:13] worked yourself into you're incapable of
[55:16] it genuine faith is a gift given by
[55:20] almighty God to you it's him giving a
[55:24] revelation which causes you to believe
[55:27] so when he does that by his grace
[55:31] do you think he's going to change his
[55:33] mind pull it away from you pull out the
[55:34] rug
[55:35] when he gives a genuine revelation of
[55:38] faith
[55:39] that stays there no matter what
[55:42] and that produces something in your life
[55:46] if you have something produced in your
[55:49] life
[55:50] which is his life the fruit of the
[55:52] spirit the character of Jesus Christ
[55:56] it's a evidence
[55:59] that you're born again that you that you
[56:01] have genuine faith
[56:03] salvation produces a life lived like
[56:07] Jesus Christ
[56:09] let's look at the scripture Psalm 97
[56:12] verse
[56:13] 10 ye that love the Lord
[56:16] hate evil he preserveth The Souls of his
[56:19] Saints he delivereth them out of the
[56:22] hand of the wicked
[56:25] I don't see any qualify qualifications
[56:28] there it says he does it
[56:31] he preserves our souls he delivers us
[56:34] out of the hand
[56:36] of the of the evil one
[56:38] it's his work it's his purpose next one
[56:40] Psalm Psalms 34 22 the Lord redeems The
[56:44] Souls of his servants and none of them
[56:46] that trust in him shall be desolate
[56:52] you're not gonna God is Not Gonna Leave
[56:54] You Alone
[56:56] he's not going to abandon you he'll it's
[57:00] his promise I'll be with you always even
[57:03] to the end of the world
[57:06] Hebrews 7 25
[57:09] wherefore he is able also to save them
[57:12] to the uttermost that come unto God by
[57:15] him seeing he ever liveth to make
[57:18] intercession for them
[57:22] to save them to the uttermost aren't you
[57:25] thankful that it says to the uttermost
[57:27] to the Very extreme all the way to the
[57:31] end
[57:32] he is able has nothing to do with you
[57:37] you're just the one he's doing it too
[57:40] and doing it for
[57:42] you you brothers and sisters you say I
[57:45] know this already this needs to be in
[57:48] your soul when you're at work
[57:49] when you're struggling when you're
[57:51] depressed whenever Satan has every gun
[57:54] aimed at you
[57:55] this can't be just something you heard
[57:57] one time this has to be the sustenance
[58:00] that keeps your soul
[58:03] this is God's promise
[58:06] don't let it just be a Doctrine over
[58:08] here that we believe in our church this
[58:10] is the lifeblood
[58:13] that's going to keep you
[58:15] that's that when every storm of Life am
[58:18] I really saved while I remember that I
[58:20] never chose it in the first place God
[58:22] came to me saved me gave me a spirit
[58:24] changed me so therefore it has nothing
[58:27] to do with what I'm seeing or
[58:29] experiencing or feeling it's all about
[58:31] what he's already done and what he's
[58:33] going to continue to do
[58:39] Romans 11 29.
[58:41] for the gifts and calling of God are
[58:43] without repentance
[58:46] has God called you to himself
[58:48] he's never going to change his mind
[58:51] he's never going to turn around from
[58:53] that
[58:54] Jude 1 24
[58:57] now unto him that is able to keep you
[58:59] from falling and to present you
[59:00] faultless before the presence of his
[59:03] glory with exceeding
[59:05] Joy
[59:07] he's able to keep you from falling
[59:11] is anything that you do able to
[59:14] overpower almighty God
[59:21] if you're born of the spirit of God
[59:23] his hand is on you
[59:25] he's given you Faith by a revelation
[59:29] no matter what happens
[59:32] he's going to keep you from falling
[59:34] you say I've seen people fall David in
[59:37] in the Old Testament they're under the
[59:38] Old Testament this is something the New
[59:41] Covenant is better and greater that's
[59:44] what the book of Hebrews says yes
[59:46] Abraham had his brother he was elect
[59:49] Abraham lied was dishonest that's not
[59:53] our that's not our example Abraham his
[59:57] life is an example to us of Faith but
[1:00:00] we're not to live like Abraham and lie
[1:00:02] or David and commit adultery and say
[1:00:05] well God's just going to keep me that's
[1:00:07] that's an evidence that your heart's not
[1:00:09] right in the first place
[1:00:14] God gives you a heart
[1:00:17] he gives you in the New Covenant it's a
[1:00:19] new heart
[1:00:21] there's something higher we're called to
[1:00:23] a higher life
[1:00:24] than Old Testament Saints
[1:00:27] you know what what did they say what do
[1:00:29] they say about
[1:00:31] John the Baptist there's no one
[1:00:34] no greater Prophet than him
[1:00:38] yet the one in the Kingdom of Heaven the
[1:00:41] least in the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:00:43] greater than John
[1:00:46] it's shocking to think about but the
[1:00:48] reality is the New Covenant is something
[1:00:51] that it it wasn't under the old it's new
[1:00:56] there's something you and I have the the
[1:00:57] New Birth by the baptism of the holy
[1:01:00] ghost that comes through the blood of
[1:01:01] Jesus Christ at Calvary they didn't have
[1:01:05] they never experienced we're called to
[1:01:07] something higher
[1:01:10] don't live such a life and say well
[1:01:11] Abraham was a liar so I can be a liar
[1:01:16] David was adulterer so I'm justified in
[1:01:19] what I'm doing hey you think it's funny
[1:01:21] because it's ridiculous but how many
[1:01:24] so-called preachers of this message have
[1:01:26] used the same nonsense reasoning to
[1:01:29] manipulate control people
[1:01:34] why am I telling this to you because you
[1:01:37] you can tell very quickly
[1:01:40] who is serving God and who is not
[1:01:42] serving God who is serving themselves
[1:01:45] using you to serve themselves
[1:01:49] the spirit of God does not lead people
[1:01:52] into an adultery
[1:01:54] doesn't lead people into lying you you
[1:01:56] might
[1:01:58] say something that's not true to someone
[1:02:01] you'll be convicted and you'll make it
[1:02:02] right and it'll bring a greater
[1:02:04] testimony just like brother Diggs was
[1:02:05] speaking about before brother Branham
[1:02:07] had his mistakes
[1:02:09] he told his wife to lie he lied
[1:02:13] what it what was it God convicted him he
[1:02:16] went back and told the man and
[1:02:17] apologized and it was a greater
[1:02:19] testimony I've personally experienced
[1:02:20] exactly the same thing
[1:02:23] but what but what is it the spirit of
[1:02:25] God works conviction that's him keeping
[1:02:30] you
[1:02:32] but you're not going to make excuses for
[1:02:34] it
[1:02:35] if you're making an excuse for your sin
[1:02:38] continuing to live in it damaging
[1:02:40] people's lives it shows you've got to
[1:02:43] repent you've got to get filled with the
[1:02:45] spirit of God
[1:02:48] he is able to keep pull that up again
[1:02:51] that script same scripture
[1:02:53] to him that is able to keep you from
[1:02:55] falling last one
[1:02:58] and to present you faultless before the
[1:03:02] presence of his glory
[1:03:04] what does it does it say that you're
[1:03:06] doing some of that
[1:03:08] he's doing it for you he keeps you from
[1:03:11] falling and he presents you faultless
[1:03:14] before his presence
[1:03:16] it's his work it's what he's doing is
[1:03:18] what he's accomplishing
[1:03:20] now this next scripture Hebrews 6
[1:03:25] um is one that is always brought to meet
[1:03:29] is there verse 4 there
[1:03:33] yeah
[1:03:36] so this one is always brought as a
[1:03:37] question especially overseas when you're
[1:03:40] preaching on predestination
[1:03:42] and eternal security and they bring this
[1:03:46] and
[1:03:47] want to want to show you see your
[1:03:49] doctrine of eternal security is
[1:03:52] incorrect these people that are Falling
[1:03:54] Away
[1:03:57] let's read it for it is impossible for
[1:03:59] those who were once enlightened
[1:04:01] and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and
[1:04:04] were made partakers of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:06] and have tasted the good word of God and
[1:04:09] the powers of the world to come
[1:04:11] if they shall fall away so there's that
[1:04:14] word Falling Away
[1:04:17] falling away to renew them again unto
[1:04:20] repentance
[1:04:24] seeing they crucify to themselves the
[1:04:26] son of God afresh
[1:04:28] and put him to an open shame next
[1:04:32] scriptures
[1:04:34] so if you just read those ones those
[1:04:37] scriptures seems like an open and shut
[1:04:39] case people can
[1:04:42] get enlightened
[1:04:43] receive the Holy Ghost and then they can
[1:04:47] fall away backslide and they'll never be
[1:04:49] able to be renewed to repentance again
[1:04:55] but let's look at seven through nine and
[1:04:57] I apologize it seems like uh
[1:05:00] these are getting cut outs a lot of the
[1:05:01] scriptures are getting cut off I don't
[1:05:03] know if while I taking a break between
[1:05:05] them you can switch over to the
[1:05:07] PowerPoint
[1:05:09] um
[1:05:09] but we're going to read seven through
[1:05:11] nine and then we'll take I'll have you
[1:05:12] shut it down there for a minute for the
[1:05:15] Earth which drinketh in the rain that
[1:05:16] cometh off to upon it and bringeth forth
[1:05:18] herbs meet for them by whom it is
[1:05:20] dressed receives blessing from God
[1:05:23] but that which Bears thorns and Briars
[1:05:25] is rejected and is Nyan de cursing whose
[1:05:27] end is to be burned but beloved we are
[1:05:29] persuaded better things of you and
[1:05:31] things that accompany salvation though
[1:05:34] we thus
[1:05:35] speak
[1:05:37] so now we have Paul writing and he's
[1:05:42] giving the bigger picture
[1:05:45] so first he says these people they're
[1:05:47] they're enlightened they've tasted the
[1:05:51] good word of God
[1:05:53] they made partakers of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:56] but then he wants to give a bigger
[1:05:59] picture
[1:06:00] and he begins to speak about two types
[1:06:03] of plants
[1:06:05] he speaks of
[1:06:07] herbs
[1:06:10] which are meat for them
[1:06:13] to whom it is dressed
[1:06:15] so the herbs receive water
[1:06:18] but also thorns and Briars receive water
[1:06:22] they both receive water but they bear
[1:06:24] different kinds of fruit
[1:06:28] one's purpose is to receive blessing
[1:06:30] from God the other's purpose their end
[1:06:34] is to be burned
[1:06:36] and he says but beloved we are persuaded
[1:06:39] of better things of you and things which
[1:06:42] accompany things which go along things
[1:06:45] which are produced by salvation
[1:06:48] even though we speak like this
[1:06:51] so what is what is Paul saying here back
[1:06:54] up these are people that were in the
[1:06:57] church they made their confession they
[1:06:59] were baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:07:00] Jesus Christ by all appearances they
[1:07:03] were walking with God they were living
[1:07:06] for him but Paul is trying to give a
[1:07:09] bigger picture and say there's two
[1:07:12] different kinds of seeds
[1:07:14] one seed is from God one seed is from
[1:07:18] the evil one
[1:07:20] now this is the parable this is the
[1:07:22] outworking of Jesus parable in Matthew
[1:07:25] 13.
[1:07:28] and so they both
[1:07:31] ex can experience the Holy Ghost can be
[1:07:34] Anointed with the Holy Ghost can taste
[1:07:37] the word of God can preach the word of
[1:07:38] God but one is the seed of God one is
[1:07:44] the seed of the evil one
[1:07:46] and how do you know the difference
[1:07:50] what fruit is produced
[1:07:52] what what kind of Life what kind of word
[1:07:56] comes forth from their life
[1:08:01] second Peter 2
[1:08:03] verse 20 through 22 I think we're
[1:08:09] in between bringing them up so if you
[1:08:10] want to turn there you're welcome to I'm
[1:08:12] going to read it
[1:08:14] for after half if after they have
[1:08:16] escaped the pollutions of the world
[1:08:18] through the knowledge of the Lord and
[1:08:19] Savior Jesus Christ they are again
[1:08:21] entangled therein and overcome the
[1:08:24] latter end is worse with them than the
[1:08:26] beginning
[1:08:27] for it had been better for them not to
[1:08:30] have known the way of righteousness than
[1:08:32] after they have known it to turn from
[1:08:34] the holy commandment delivered unto them
[1:08:36] but it has happened unto them according
[1:08:38] to the true proverb the dog has turned
[1:08:40] his own vomit again in the sow that was
[1:08:42] washed to her wallowing
[1:08:44] in the mire once again you see
[1:08:48] the the Apostle Peter explaining the big
[1:08:52] picture at the very end
[1:08:55] um and I'll just kind of Jump Ahead in
[1:08:59] first John
[1:09:01] 2 19
[1:09:03] it says they went out from us
[1:09:05] but they weren't out of us for if they
[1:09:08] had been of us they would no doubt have
[1:09:10] continued with us but they went out that
[1:09:13] they might be manifested that they were
[1:09:15] not all
[1:09:16] of us again John is acknowledging the
[1:09:20] fact there's people they come come to
[1:09:23] church they come and listen to the
[1:09:26] gospel they come and respond to the
[1:09:29] gospel they're baptized correctly
[1:09:32] and they seem to be living a Godly life
[1:09:37] but what happens the dog
[1:09:40] turns to his mom your nature it's your
[1:09:43] nature to do that so your nature will
[1:09:45] produce that they never had a nature
[1:09:48] change in the first place why are they
[1:09:50] walking away
[1:09:52] why are they leaving
[1:09:54] why are they
[1:09:57] it says after they escape the pollutions
[1:09:59] of the world what do they do they came
[1:10:01] they went through the process that
[1:10:03] everyone that's a Christian is supposed
[1:10:06] to do as a new believer
[1:10:08] they're attending Fellowship they're
[1:10:10] listening to the word of God
[1:10:12] but then what happens there the Bible
[1:10:14] says they're entangled
[1:10:15] again
[1:10:17] they're entangled therein again
[1:10:20] and they're overcome
[1:10:22] and their last and is worse than their
[1:10:24] their beginning
[1:10:26] so and it says they knew the way of
[1:10:28] righteousness
[1:10:29] they studied it they looked at it they
[1:10:32] knew it
[1:10:33] but then they turned from it
[1:10:36] why did they do it that was their nature
[1:10:41] they never they never really received
[1:10:44] the Holy Spirit John says they went out
[1:10:47] from us because they were not of us
[1:10:49] what is why does he say that
[1:10:52] you know any cult could use the same
[1:10:55] statement that John uses to prove their
[1:10:58] point what is he really trying to say in
[1:11:02] that is
[1:11:03] they they left they left the truth of
[1:11:06] God's word and the reality of Jesus
[1:11:09] Christ the only true way because
[1:11:13] they weren't elect
[1:11:15] they weren't predestinated unto this
[1:11:19] and it had to be manifested that they
[1:11:21] didn't have the same nature
[1:11:24] there Comes A manifesting Time
[1:11:26] when the true colors are shown Jesus
[1:11:29] goes through that through that Parable
[1:11:31] some leave me because they're the seed
[1:11:34] that fell by the wayside cares and
[1:11:36] Troubles of Life some by riches
[1:11:38] different circumstances in their life
[1:11:41] cause them to say I don't need the
[1:11:43] gospel anymore
[1:11:46] why outward experience it wasn't in a
[1:11:50] nature change in the Soul by the Holy
[1:11:52] Ghost it was simply an outward emotion
[1:11:56] that's why it's so important we have to
[1:11:59] move beyond the outward emotion
[1:12:02] and go beyond that and get in to that
[1:12:05] word that word in our heart to produce
[1:12:08] the life of Jesus Christ
[1:12:10] now there's no question that a true
[1:12:12] relationship with almighty God produces
[1:12:15] emotion
[1:12:18] it produces true reasoning it produces
[1:12:21] true imagination it produces
[1:12:24] something real
[1:12:26] inside and outside without a doubt but
[1:12:30] our Salvation isn't based on emotion
[1:12:32] it's deeper than that it's brother
[1:12:34] Branham says it's your heart in that
[1:12:37] word and that's Christ
[1:12:40] not emotions
[1:12:42] get the word in there first and then
[1:12:45] that will produce
[1:12:46] the other things we want every blessing
[1:12:48] from God we want the supernatural power
[1:12:50] of God we want his gifts we want healing
[1:12:53] we want shouting we want clapping we
[1:12:55] want rejoicing we want all of it but the
[1:12:58] real thing
[1:13:00] not a mimic because if it's just a mimic
[1:13:03] you're going to walk away
[1:13:05] you're going to leave
[1:13:07] be sure
[1:13:09] you have the real thing in your soul
[1:13:12] it will keep you
[1:13:14] it's like brother Branham those people
[1:13:16] ask brother Branham after he went
[1:13:17] through all that he did with his family
[1:13:20] and he's left alone and
[1:13:22] said did you keep your religion he said
[1:13:24] no
[1:13:25] no it kept me
[1:13:28] you know
[1:13:31] so let's look at this in a deeper way
[1:13:34] because if we just look and stare at
[1:13:36] these scriptures we could come to the
[1:13:37] place and say my maybe I really could
[1:13:40] lose my salvation
[1:13:42] but if we have to look at the big
[1:13:44] picture
[1:13:46] if you can lose your salvation
[1:13:49] true salvation I'm not saying a church
[1:13:51] membership
[1:13:53] Church attendance anybody can lose
[1:13:55] Church attendance I'm talking about
[1:13:57] genuine Holy Ghost salvation
[1:14:00] if you can lose that salvation then that
[1:14:03] salvation is contingent conditional upon
[1:14:07] you and me
[1:14:12] if we're just defiled and reconciled to
[1:14:14] God can we then turn around and become
[1:14:16] enemies again with God
[1:14:19] I want to remind you that doesn't say he
[1:14:22] loves me because I loved him
[1:14:26] I love him because he first loved me
[1:14:30] God made the approach to you and
[1:14:32] reconciled you
[1:14:34] do you think you're gonna all of a
[1:14:36] sudden do something that's going to
[1:14:38] cause God to become your enemy
[1:14:41] he didn't approach you because of what
[1:14:43] you did who or who you are he approached
[1:14:46] you because of his Sovereign choice
[1:14:48] his Sovereign purpose and whatever you
[1:14:51] do is not going to thwart that it's not
[1:14:52] going to change that he did the
[1:14:54] reconciling
[1:14:57] we didn't do the reconciling we didn't
[1:14:59] say oh please God be my friend again we
[1:15:02] were running while we were running from
[1:15:04] us he He Turned us around
[1:15:07] says no man can come to me unless the
[1:15:10] father draws him first you can't come to
[1:15:12] him no no one seeks after God
[1:15:16] it's God that does the seeking after man
[1:15:19] he's the one that came and got you
[1:15:21] he's the one that reconciled he's the
[1:15:23] one that started the process he's the
[1:15:26] one that will finish the process
[1:15:29] if salvation is conditional on our
[1:15:32] Behavior
[1:15:33] After experiencing it then it's no
[1:15:36] longer by grace and it's no longer a
[1:15:38] free gift
[1:15:40] It Is by works
[1:15:42] and is maintained by works
[1:15:46] salvation is a free gift to his elected
[1:15:50] and there's nothing that we could
[1:15:52] possibly do to change our position
[1:15:54] before God
[1:15:57] John 1 13 says we're not born of the
[1:16:01] will of the flesh or or of blood or of
[1:16:04] the will of man
[1:16:06] we are born of God
[1:16:11] we go back a little ways there brother
[1:16:14] Joe
[1:16:17] many are called but few are chosen
[1:16:20] many hear the call and even respond to
[1:16:23] it what was one of Jesus parables
[1:16:26] it was The Parables of the fish the
[1:16:29] different kinds of fish the net was
[1:16:30] thrown out it pulled in all kinds of
[1:16:33] fish some were good some weren't bad
[1:16:35] what was the net
[1:16:36] the Gospel of Jesus Christ the message
[1:16:39] of the hour
[1:16:40] it's thrown out it brings in all kinds
[1:16:43] of different fish
[1:16:44] but which ones did was the were the
[1:16:46] fishermen interested in the good fish
[1:16:49] so they're separated out the bad fish
[1:16:51] are thrown back the good fish are kept
[1:16:56] but there are those who for whatever
[1:16:58] reason listen to The Gospel hear respond
[1:17:02] to it and appear to live by it for a
[1:17:06] season
[1:17:09] but they bear
[1:17:10] thorns and Briars and they're made for
[1:17:13] the purpose of being burned
[1:17:15] they're not bearing good fruit
[1:17:20] Romans 5 10.
[1:17:23] for if when we were enemies we were
[1:17:26] reconciled to God by the death of his
[1:17:28] son much more being reconciled we shall
[1:17:31] be saved by his life we were enemies of
[1:17:35] God
[1:17:38] and we were reconciled not by our own
[1:17:41] will not by our own works we were
[1:17:44] reconciled by the death of his son
[1:17:48] that's what brought the reconciliation
[1:17:50] he did not us
[1:17:54] we're just partakers of it we were
[1:17:56] experienced we're the ones that
[1:17:58] experience of it but then it says much
[1:18:00] more being reconciled we shall be saved
[1:18:04] by his life
[1:18:07] so what does that mean to think about it
[1:18:10] we're saved by his life
[1:18:12] I thought we already were saved so we're
[1:18:14] it talks about reconciliation which
[1:18:17] reconciliation means making friend
[1:18:20] making two enemies into friends
[1:18:23] but then it speaks of Salvation so
[1:18:25] there's reconciliation and salvation in
[1:18:28] this sense it's looking at the
[1:18:30] experience that we have that we're going
[1:18:32] through and that we will ultimately
[1:18:34] experience complete salvation when we
[1:18:37] have a new body
[1:18:39] when this vile body is changed and
[1:18:41] likened unto his glorious body
[1:18:44] so what does that mean saved by his life
[1:18:47] well what is Jesus doing for us now
[1:18:52] he's the mediator of a better Covenant
[1:18:54] he's the high priest
[1:18:57] so how does God keep us
[1:19:01] through the ministry of the high priest
[1:19:05] you know what did Peter do
[1:19:09] at the very end there
[1:19:12] he betrayed Christ right
[1:19:15] Jesus said I have prayed for you that
[1:19:17] your faith would fail you not
[1:19:20] that's Christ the mediator
[1:19:23] standing in our place
[1:19:26] praying for us
[1:19:28] standing between us and God
[1:19:31] it's Christ that keeps us
[1:19:37] Hebrews 10
[1:19:40] through 14.
[1:19:42] by the which will we are Sanctified for
[1:19:44] the offering of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:19:47] once for all and every priest stands
[1:19:51] daily ministering and offering offering
[1:19:53] oftentimes the same sacrifices which can
[1:19:56] never take away sins but this man after
[1:19:59] he after he had offered one sacrifice
[1:20:01] for sins forever sat down on the right
[1:20:04] hand of God
[1:20:05] from henceforth expecting till his
[1:20:07] enemies be made his footstool for by one
[1:20:10] offering he's perfected forever them
[1:20:13] that are Sanctified so how long are we
[1:20:16] perfected for
[1:20:18] as long as we are good as long as we
[1:20:22] don't sin as long as we don't fall away
[1:20:26] how long are we perfected for
[1:20:28] ever
[1:20:32] forever what is forever is not eternally
[1:20:35] right we know that
[1:20:38] so it's just for a space of time what is
[1:20:42] that space of time we looked at it
[1:20:43] before
[1:20:45] grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:20:47] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[1:20:50] your Redemption
[1:20:52] so we're sealed
[1:20:54] and we're perfected Forever Until the
[1:20:57] time we have a new body and we're
[1:20:58] Immortal and completely sinless
[1:21:02] when we're when we're sinless in that
[1:21:04] Immortal body we don't need a high
[1:21:05] priest anymore
[1:21:07] we don't need a meat eater anymore he's
[1:21:09] accomplished exactly
[1:21:11] what he's need to accomplish then we
[1:21:14] with our King will return back to this
[1:21:16] earth to rule over it
[1:21:20] can we somehow be unperfected
[1:21:25] if it's God's decree God doesn't change
[1:21:27] his mind
[1:21:29] that Perfection stands and no nothing
[1:21:33] can change it
[1:21:36] as much as God ordained
[1:21:39] this to be
[1:21:41] next scripture
[1:21:43] he's also ordained a process for
[1:21:45] believers to go through
[1:21:48] Philippians 1 6 says being confident of
[1:21:51] this very thing
[1:21:53] that he which hath begun a good work in
[1:21:57] you will perform it until the day of
[1:22:00] Jesus Christ there's something that God
[1:22:04] has to perform
[1:22:06] in you he starts the good work in you
[1:22:09] and it has to be performed
[1:22:12] if there's no evidence of God performing
[1:22:15] something in your life
[1:22:17] then you've got to repent then you got
[1:22:19] to get filled with the Holy Ghost so
[1:22:21] that performance can be done and it
[1:22:23] isn't your performance it's something
[1:22:26] outside of your control outside of what
[1:22:28] you do it's someone that's omnipotent
[1:22:32] working in you a work that no one can
[1:22:37] thwart and no one can stop not even you
[1:22:41] there's one thing that we have brother
[1:22:44] Branham says in the Paradox message in
[1:22:47] 1965 he said we man always wants
[1:22:49] something into his salvation
[1:22:52] says you do have something into it the
[1:22:54] surrender of your will and your idea to
[1:22:57] the will and idea of almighty God it's
[1:23:00] surrender that's the part that we play
[1:23:02] it's saying I give myself to you Lord
[1:23:04] you work in me that which is needed
[1:23:08] and he will do it
[1:23:11] math uh next one
[1:23:15] um yeah
[1:23:18] you see God could not push us through a
[1:23:20] little pipe pull us out on the other end
[1:23:22] and then saying blessed is he that
[1:23:23] overcometh you had nothing to overcome
[1:23:25] he just pushed you through but you've
[1:23:27] got to make decisions for yourself I
[1:23:30] have to make decisions for myself in
[1:23:33] doing that we show our faith and
[1:23:35] respects to God
[1:23:37] amen
[1:23:39] he doesn't just push us through a pipe
[1:23:41] there is our involvement and it isn't
[1:23:43] our own works it's our surrender
[1:23:47] to him there's a continual surrender I
[1:23:50] don't know what world you're living and
[1:23:51] maybe you don't need to surrender every
[1:23:53] second but I've got to surrender myself
[1:23:57] every second
[1:23:59] every minute
[1:24:00] every hour Jesus the sinless perfect Son
[1:24:05] of God
[1:24:06] also had to surrender himself and say
[1:24:08] not my will
[1:24:09] that thy will be done
[1:24:12] the same the same goes for us to to
[1:24:16] Infinity
[1:24:17] next one
[1:24:21] he doesn't push us through a pipe but we
[1:24:23] are clay
[1:24:26] and he is the Potter
[1:24:28] and he does mold us and he does have
[1:24:30] power to mold us his brother Branham
[1:24:33] says this so if you ever want to pray
[1:24:34] for me it's not to have money not to
[1:24:36] have big homes or be popular but just
[1:24:38] pray that I can stay in the hands of
[1:24:40] Christ mold clay that he can mold me and
[1:24:43] use me in any way that he sees fit to do
[1:24:46] it I'll pray the same thing for you that
[1:24:48] you'll be the same way so no he doesn't
[1:24:51] push us through a pipe but yes he does
[1:24:54] mold the clay
[1:24:55] and I'm so grateful for that
[1:25:00] and our part is just submit submit to it
[1:25:03] we can we can resist
[1:25:06] we can we can block
[1:25:08] But ultimately
[1:25:10] God's going to have his way
[1:25:13] he'll do it the hard way or he'll do it
[1:25:15] the easy way
[1:25:19] regardless if he has his hand on his
[1:25:21] life on your life
[1:25:24] he has his way way of correcting of
[1:25:27] convicting
[1:25:28] and even even in those things where we
[1:25:31] do the wrong thing where we sin
[1:25:34] God has a purpose in that he's
[1:25:37] correcting us he's bringing those things
[1:25:39] out like brother Diggs was talking about
[1:25:41] God is bringing that little nature
[1:25:43] within us
[1:25:45] that's not right he's bringing that to
[1:25:47] the surface so that we can repent and
[1:25:50] make it right and get rid of that nasty
[1:25:52] thing that's in our life
[1:25:54] that's his Sovereign Grace he that began
[1:25:57] the work
[1:25:58] will be faithful to perform it until the
[1:26:00] day of Jesus Christ
[1:26:05] um is Matthew 15 verse 8 up there
[1:26:08] brother
[1:26:09] maybe that got missed
[1:26:13] I'll read it
[1:26:14] this people yeah go back go back to
[1:26:18] Matthew 7. but I'm going to read Matthew
[1:26:20] 15 verse 8 first
[1:26:23] this people draws nigh unto me with
[1:26:26] their mouth and honors me with their
[1:26:27] lips but their heart is far
[1:26:31] from me
[1:26:33] people
[1:26:35] are capable
[1:26:37] of on the outside
[1:26:39] with their lips honoring God
[1:26:43] speaking about God preaching about God
[1:26:46] it's something that's done
[1:26:49] people draw nears with their with their
[1:26:52] mouth honor honors god with their lips
[1:26:54] but they don't really honor God with
[1:26:56] their life
[1:26:58] their inward thoughts their inward life
[1:27:01] it's just a show
[1:27:03] Matthew 7 21-23
[1:27:06] not everyone that saith unto me Lord
[1:27:09] Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:27:10] heaven but he that doeth the will of My
[1:27:12] Father which is in heaven many will say
[1:27:15] to me in that day Lord Lord have we not
[1:27:16] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[1:27:19] have cast out devils and in thy name
[1:27:20] have done many wonderful works and then
[1:27:23] will I profess unto them I never knew
[1:27:25] you depart from me ye that work iniquity
[1:27:30] so these are people which are anointed
[1:27:32] with the spirit of God
[1:27:35] they have an anointing
[1:27:37] but they're not their heart is far from
[1:27:40] God
[1:27:41] why do I say that because they've
[1:27:43] refused to do the will of God
[1:27:47] they refuse to fought what's the will of
[1:27:49] God the word of God
[1:27:52] they have all outward signs of anointing
[1:27:54] and Supernatural power manifested and
[1:27:57] displayed in their life great Charisma
[1:28:00] is sent forth devils are cast out
[1:28:03] wonderful works are done healings are
[1:28:05] done
[1:28:06] but yet they are refusing
[1:28:09] to walk and live according to the word
[1:28:12] of God
[1:28:13] they want to follow their own way their
[1:28:16] own purpose
[1:28:19] who's the one
[1:28:21] that will enter the kingdom of heaven
[1:28:25] the one who has outward Prosperity
[1:28:28] outward
[1:28:29] manifestations no
[1:28:32] the one that does the will of My Father
[1:28:35] which is in heaven
[1:28:36] and I want to suggest to you that no one
[1:28:39] on earth is capable of doing the will of
[1:28:42] the Father in Heaven unless God
[1:28:46] calls you
[1:28:47] changes you and empowers you to do it
[1:28:51] we're all sold under sin there's no one
[1:28:54] that can do God's will on their own
[1:28:56] it's him giving you that new nature
[1:28:59] which agrees with him
[1:29:06] First Corinthians 10 verse 12.
[1:29:10] it is true
[1:29:12] Christians can backslide
[1:29:15] True Believers can backside black side
[1:29:18] True Believers can even have serious
[1:29:20] moral failures
[1:29:22] but one thing that we know
[1:29:25] they will stand correction
[1:29:29] they will repent they will make it right
[1:29:31] they won't try to hide it you know you
[1:29:34] see these false
[1:29:37] teachers on television and YouTube and
[1:29:40] they'll make little confessions about
[1:29:42] things but they just continue right on
[1:29:44] receiving a paycheck and
[1:29:46] quote unquote preaching
[1:29:49] they never repented
[1:29:51] they never really made things right
[1:29:53] they just did it because they were
[1:29:55] forced to do it
[1:29:57] there's no true repentance
[1:30:00] but each of us have to be in that
[1:30:02] position where uh if you think you stand
[1:30:06] don't be so proud of yourself
[1:30:08] don't get so lifted up and say hey I'm
[1:30:10] I'm standing I'm living as a Christian
[1:30:13] take heed
[1:30:15] watch out lest you fall this isn't
[1:30:18] saying Fall From Grace
[1:30:20] this is saying falling into sin
[1:30:24] but get falling into the Trap that the
[1:30:26] devil has
[1:30:28] take heed be humble
[1:30:31] Be watchful be mindful there's an enemy
[1:30:34] there's a devil that's trying to bring
[1:30:35] you into sin
[1:30:39] Luke 22 verse 31.
[1:30:42] I referred to this earlier and the Lord
[1:30:44] said Simon Simon behold Satan has
[1:30:47] desired to have you
[1:30:49] my just think about that transport
[1:30:52] yourself for a minute into the Heavenly
[1:30:54] places I think of job right away job
[1:30:58] Satan is having a conversation
[1:31:04] with with the Almighty
[1:31:08] I want I want I want Peter
[1:31:11] you know Peter was such a person that he
[1:31:15] was always the first to speak and he was
[1:31:17] so charismatic and just always in the
[1:31:21] front right
[1:31:23] that's danger that's danger zone
[1:31:27] that that's that's the place to be
[1:31:29] careful
[1:31:30] and what was it God had a purpose in
[1:31:33] letting saying go ahead Satan
[1:31:37] I'll humble this guy
[1:31:40] Satan didn't know he's playing right
[1:31:41] into God's hands
[1:31:43] God used that right there to bring Peter
[1:31:47] out of his big balloon head
[1:31:52] onto his knees in tears and crying
[1:31:55] before almighty God he knows how God
[1:31:57] knows how to do that Satan thought I
[1:31:59] want I want Peter because I want to use
[1:32:01] him as an antichrist
[1:32:04] God's oh you can try
[1:32:08] what did Christ say
[1:32:11] I have prayed for you that you Faith
[1:32:13] your faith will fail you not
[1:32:16] the mediator stood there said
[1:32:19] you can only go so far Satan
[1:32:21] you can't go any further than this
[1:32:23] is Faith is not going to fail him but
[1:32:25] this is going to be used to make a
[1:32:28] humble man
[1:32:31] Hebrews 12 14.
[1:32:36] follow peace with all man and Holiness
[1:32:38] without which no man shall see the Lord
[1:32:43] again conditions
[1:32:45] what will be within True Believers
[1:32:49] following peace
[1:32:51] and holiness
[1:32:53] God will create God is going to work
[1:32:55] that in our life
[1:32:57] that's produced within us Holiness set
[1:33:00] apart to him
[1:33:02] and will follow peace we all won't be
[1:33:04] arguing and fussing with everybody
[1:33:05] making fights
[1:33:07] we will be peacemakers
[1:33:10] that's part of the character of Christ
[1:33:13] Galatians 6 8
[1:33:16] for he that sows to his flesh shall of
[1:33:18] the flesh reap corruption but he that
[1:33:20] sows to the spirit shall of the spirit
[1:33:22] reap life Everlasting can be a
[1:33:26] born-again Christian
[1:33:28] genuine believer
[1:33:30] and yet what are you what are we sowing
[1:33:31] to because you'll reap what you sow
[1:33:35] if you sow after your flesh
[1:33:38] you're going to reap Hard Times
[1:33:40] difficulties trials
[1:33:43] and further and further problems
[1:33:46] until you repent
[1:33:49] make these things right with people and
[1:33:52] with God
[1:33:54] and then begin walking in the spirit
[1:33:58] and let's let's just be clear both of
[1:34:01] these things happen on a daily basis
[1:34:03] with us as believers
[1:34:06] in our marriage
[1:34:08] in our friendships sometimes we sin and
[1:34:12] we we walk after the Flesh and what does
[1:34:15] it produce problems
[1:34:17] then we then other times we're maybe two
[1:34:20] minutes later we're walking in the
[1:34:23] spirit
[1:34:24] and what is it doing it's bringing life
[1:34:26] it's bringing Joy it's bringing peace
[1:34:28] we're all doing that and you reap from
[1:34:31] both sides of that
[1:34:35] doesn't impact your salvation
[1:34:38] it doesn't change the fact that God has
[1:34:41] his hand on your life and he's working
[1:34:44] he's working through all those things in
[1:34:46] you
[1:34:49] even so
[1:34:51] faith if it have not works is dead being
[1:34:55] alone Faith produces works
[1:34:58] one John 1 verse 7 but if we walk in the
[1:35:01] light
[1:35:02] again conditional if
[1:35:08] 1 John 1 verse 7.
[1:35:14] next one
[1:35:15] should be
[1:35:16] no
[1:35:18] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:35:20] the light we have fellowship with one
[1:35:21] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:35:23] his son cleanses us from all sins we've
[1:35:25] got to walk in the light
[1:35:27] we've got to take this light
[1:35:29] and live it we've got it we've got to
[1:35:31] feed on it and live in it
[1:35:34] first John 2 verse 4 he that saith I
[1:35:38] know him and keeps not his Commandments
[1:35:40] is a liar and the truth is not in him
[1:35:43] First John 3 verse 14.
[1:35:47] we know that we have passed from Death
[1:35:49] unto life because we love the Brethren
[1:35:51] he that loves not his brother abides in
[1:35:55] death again all of these things are
[1:35:58] conditions we know
[1:36:00] we know
[1:36:03] that we pass from Death to life if we
[1:36:05] have love
[1:36:06] why because the new birth produces love
[1:36:08] in US
[1:36:11] for second Thessalonians 2 13.
[1:36:15] but we are bound to give thanks always
[1:36:17] to God for you Brethren beloved of the
[1:36:19] Lord because God has from the beginning
[1:36:21] chosen you to Salvation through
[1:36:23] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[1:36:26] of the truth
[1:36:29] so these These are the processes that
[1:36:31] God is taking us through sanctification
[1:36:34] and belief in the truth just continually
[1:36:37] being transformed by the word this is
[1:36:41] what must be produced by genuine
[1:36:43] salvation
[1:36:47] and we're going to skip ahead to Second
[1:36:50] our Philippians chapter 2
[1:36:52] verse 12 and 13 musicians if you want to
[1:36:56] come
[1:37:00] wherefore my beloved as you have always
[1:37:02] obeyed not as in my presence only
[1:37:07] but now much more in my absence work out
[1:37:10] your salvation own salvation with fear
[1:37:14] and trembling
[1:37:17] brother Tony come on up
[1:37:21] work it out work out your own salvation
[1:37:24] with fear and trembling carry to its
[1:37:25] ultimate conclusion
[1:37:29] carry your salvation to its ultimate
[1:37:32] conclusion why for it's God which works
[1:37:36] in you both to Will and to do of his
[1:37:38] good pleasure I think right there you
[1:37:41] have those two things put together God
[1:37:43] is not going to push you through a pipe
[1:37:45] we need to work out our own salvation
[1:37:48] with fear and trembling
[1:37:53] and then we have the other part the clay
[1:37:56] it's God working in you both to Will and
[1:37:59] to do of his good pleasure
[1:38:02] why do we
[1:38:04] work out our salvation
[1:38:06] because God is working in you
[1:38:10] both to Will and to do of his good
[1:38:12] pleasure God is working therefore our
[1:38:16] response is fear and trembling and doing
[1:38:21] giving our all
[1:38:23] to walk with Christ
[1:38:25] making it the very heartbeat of our life
[1:38:29] foreign
[1:38:30] let's pray
[1:38:32] [Music]
[1:38:33] Heavenly Father
[1:38:36] we just come to you Lord and we're so

[1:39:12] and that produces such a hunger and
[1:39:14] thirst for you
[1:39:16] such a passion Lord
[1:39:19] to walk in that this light that you've
[1:39:21] given to us

[1:39:26] another and that the blood of Jesus
