TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we commit ourselves into your hands may you bless both speaker and hearer we commit it to you in Jesus name amen amen amen God bless you friends turn around shake hands with somebody everybody everybody make sure nine people need to go Shake brother Larry's hand praise the Lord good to see you here tonight brother Larry praise the Lord man praise the Lord Proverbs chapter 29 I wasn't scheduled to preach tonight but I was happy when they said let us go to the house of the Lord amen and I um I was able to one of my the uh the morning Bible studies that I do and uh this was the first one I've done this year did did one last year the um the school up there Bao is that what it's called I think uh ra is that it's Bao up there in Washington state I mean in in Canada yeah and so uh they have different ministers come on and do morning devotion so the other morning Tuesday Morning in fact yesterday morning I actually took a version of this sermon tonight which wasn't a sermon it was just a little bible study 20 minutes long don't worry I'm going to preach longer than 20 minutes [Laughter] and uh as I was signing off the air I thought to myself I said my goodness that would I would love to figure out a way to preach that as a whole sermon well the Lord just opened up the windows of Heaven that's what we're going to do praise the Lord Proverbs chapter 29 and we're just going to read one verse and the reason we're only going to take one verse is because we're going to read it from multiple translations but we'll read this one and we'll let you be seated Proverbs chap 29 I want to speak to you tonight on a title be thou my vision amen praise the Lord sister Deborah I thought you was starting up with that for a second when I heard that Celtic song that she was singing I started to walk out and go okay and as soon as you're done with that one start on this one be thou my vision it's a very popular song Amen a servant I'm sorry verse 18 proverb 29: 18 where there is no vision the people perish you don't want to perish do you where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated amen praise the Lord go Ahad and put my title slide up brother Gideon amen it's interesting the various meanings that this word Vision has in the Old Testament and one of the correlations that you're going to see is it's attached in the Hebrew to the word revelation I could in fact is one of the translations says it pretty much exactly like that that where there is no Revelation the people perish because it is revelation that gives us Vision now you see that you see that right there our forward Vision 2019 this is one of those little quirky things today I was telling sister Debbie about that normally I go to a kind of a a recent PowerPoints I'll have three or four different designs in there and I'll just pick one duplicate it open it and then change all the insides of it change all the data so today when I was studying I thought for some reason for some weird reason I thought you know I'm gonna just go all the way back I I haven't done this in years I'm going to go back to my my larger repository and just see what strikes me and when I open it of course it opens up you know and all kinds of thumbnails and I saw that thumbnail and I thought yeah I think that that kind of a a rustic way um you know we're we're going to talk a little bit about Celtic uh the Christian Movement there under St Patrick and that kind of looked a little rugged amen and I thought and when I opened it I saw those words our forward vision and I'm preaching tonight on be thou my our vision be thou my vision now you'll notice in 2019 so one of the first things that I had to do was update it amen so we're not using that title nor am I using those notes but I did pick these verses th this was the verse this was the very verse I wanted to use I mean my mind was just blown for a few minutes and I said Lord you're surely in this now I'm going to let you go with it go through it with me from the new king New King James Version the nkjv where there is no Revelation the people cast off restraint I'm gonna tell you something friends that that right there when I when I read that version of it you know where there's no vision the people perish what it's saying is that people without a without a headship in Christ people without a revealed word you're just going to go any way of the world and I don't want to go any way of the world and I don't you want you to and I don't want here's what we don't want to have to do we don't want to have to figure it out I want it to be revealed I don't want to have to react and spend my whole Christian Life reacting and going to the drawing board I'd just rather already know what's going to happen I'd already I already already would rather know the answer I already want to know the re the uh the result of it so that I am not operating in a reactive way I'm actually in God's word we're able to be proactive you can proactively be victorious you can be victorious in a trial tonight you won't face till tomorrow amen are we dealing talking about the Realms of Eternity we're not talking about time now we're going into God's realm and so in fact is when I when I thought about it I thought you know I might invert that and call it our vision forward but I actually on purpose thought no I'm going to leave it just like that because you're going to want to have a vision and if you're going to have a vision it it needs to be a forward Vision because I don't know about you but I'm going forward we're in the new year and I don't plan to stay around much longer I certainly don't want to languish in the past I want to go forward forward forward onward and upward amen so it is our forward Vision first of all you need a vision without it you perish but you need a vision that will help you go forward amen now if you're failing and stumbling you're not really going forward you are moving along as brother uh stepen cof preached you know whether you have your ups and downs you're still on a journey headed to a destination but okay great I'm happy for my destination but I'd like to count for something while I'm here I'd like to accomplish something I don't just want to stumble across the Finish Line I'd like to go across Finish Line running that's why I used to run track and field I crossed the Finish Line sprinting see our forward Vision where there is no Revelation the people cast off restraint so you know if if you're having a hard time with Sanctified lifestyle you might want to visit your prayer life you might want to think about your church schedule you might want to think about more fellowship with the right people you might want to deduct some things out of your life not just pack up but brother brandham said unpack back see so we we need to make sure that we're not casting off restraint amen when here it is from the New Living Translation when people do not accept Divine guidance they run wild and how oh my goodness could I spend the rest of the service tonight testifying to that reading it that way when people do not except Divine guidance they run wild and I'm not talking about my guidance I'm talking about Divine guidance I mean I my guidance could hit and miss but Divine guidance is always perfect now it might not not always seem like the way to you but trust me it's perfect here's another one from Eugene Peterson's message translation if people can't see what God is doing they stumble over all over themselves but when they attend to what he reveals they are Most Blessed now this is exactly why every time those first four seals open under a lion and an ox and a man and a flying eagle the spirit of the living creature says come and see come and observe come and take notice come and come and pay attention because something is happening that that's not just hyperbole it's not just a story it's not just a parable this is happening in real time there's an antichrist and there's a Christ amen and you're being led by one or the other and if you can't see what God is doing you know you you need to think about again you need to figure out what it is that's hindering your vision of God's presence in your life God's blessing in your life God's plan for your life going forward it's all about a vision it's all about Revelation here it is from the Amplified version where there is no vision no of God the people perish that is a an amazing statement you agree now let me me do one quick thing here ready okay all right so where there is no vision where there is no Redemptive revelation of God the people perish friends you know the devil is just nasty he's hateful he's mean he's a murderer he's a liar the last thing he wants you doing when you wake up in the morning is having a hope for the world to come or to have a hope that you are a son and daughter of God or to have a hope that that the token is over your home or to have a hope that angels are en encamped around you that's the last thing he wants but you can rest assure they are he is and you are going in a Rapture and and so so you you need to have this re Revelation that you are redeemed that you have passed from Death un life that you can never come into the Judgment you need to have a revelation that there is now right now therefore no condemnation even possible to them who are in Christ as I've said before you are unindictable you cannot be charged the Lord won't even hear the case that's right it that that that that judgment has already been passed and he will not even hear the charge against you because God is only looking from the Eternal perspective thank God I'm standing here tonight as a man who says thank God that that's true amen amen and so if I'm going to be successful if I'm not if I'm not going to just fall down in discouragement and despair then I'm going to need to have a Redemptive revelation of God that I know he is and that I know he keeps his word and that I know he loves me and that he knows who I am so I think that we could have established tonight and I think you would agree with me me that vision is the key Revelation is the key come and see come and see come and see it keeps saying that the living creature keeps saying that come and see every Age come and see here's a new anointing come and see there's an eagle anointing which means there's a pale horse rider come and see you need to see this you can't you can hardly know God if you can't see him and I want to tell you something friends this is the age where you need to be able to see him you need to be able to see his movements you need to be able to keep time with the rhythm of the Holy Ghost you need to be able to move when the Holy Spirit is moving amen so vision is the key so that if vision is the key then I don't think that there is really anything that we could desire more from God than to be able to say say be thou my vision I'm happy if he's your vision but I need him to be mine I'm glad he was brother brandom's I'm glad he was Paul's I'm glad he was Moses's Vision but I need him to be my vision I need him to be my vision we sing the song it's actually a a poem be thou my vision is actually you know it's a traditional Christian Hymn of of Irish origin and it's actually based on a Middle Ages Irish poem I don't know if you knew that but it's actually based on a Middle Ages Irish poem that has been attributed to to this man if right right here to this man right here now you can't hardly find a picture that's not all Catholic up it's been Catholic but St D of for haale I have no idea if he's a saint uh brother brandham said you have to be living to be a saint which is the opposite of Rome they say you have to be dead and brother Bram says well Saint means Sanctified one so how are you a saint if you're not alive living a Sanctified life hello Saints see I do know this he he wrote a a wonderful uh poem Dinan for forgal from the he was sixth Century Irish poet and scholar and so you know they there they a little bit history is a little bit iffy and I don't want to say that I know it particularly because even historians say somewhere between the 6th and the 14th century uh this this poem was discovered and they think it was written maybe in the sixth or maybe in the eth some Scholars say the eth most that I could find go take take it back to this uh man here in the 6th Century but in 1905 the poem was translated into English by Mary burn and then it was versified by elanar Hull later in 1912 and it became the song that we sing commonly today however when you hear the song song sung uh it's it's really you know once once it got turned into a song it it really departed in a number of ways from the original poem and in fact is the original poem is is is sung to the tune of an Irish folk Melody that was first published in 1909 remember before a song just a poem was wasn't a song at all but in 1909 uh it was put into a song and sung to the tune of an Irish folk Melody called slain now not slain SL a i n but s l n e and fact is the hill of slain is what it is famous for and the the hill of slain is actually a very important complex it has some prehistoric history some early um um what we would call the Christian era history it has met medieval monuments that are there it's located in Ireland it's actually situated a little Northwest of the village of slain from who it's named and the village R I think the hill Rises 158 meters above sea level now the hill of slain is known the reason it's famous in Ireland is because of its association with St Patrick amen so we we find that St Patrick let me let me get my ducks in a row here okay you so it's Associated then with St Patrick H that's not not the one I want thank you all right and the reason that it is associated with St Patrick is because you remember that St Patrick was uh a young teenager about 16 most historians think he was around 16 he was a he was a child of of Roman parents who when Rome had had invaded the the British Isles and he was actually playing along the shore and Irish Raiders kidnapped him and a bunch of people they were slavers and he actually had Roman parents and he was hiding in the bushes but they discovered him and they took him captive and took him back to Ireland now actually in Patrick's Memoirs he actually held no um even at the time even even when he was taken captive and he he actually felt that it was justified by God to do it because he knew that he had been a sinful young man he knew that you know his his his his family and his nation and even the area where he lived that they had really not lived according to the laws of God and nature and so he actually felt like they deserved it he became a chrisan while he was in captivity in Ireland which was pretty amazing because it was filled with Druids and all kinds of mysticism and and uh devil worship and things like that but we find then that that while he was he was there he was working I think about seven years for uh like an indentured servant and and he actually as he became a Christian now he's just he's very young he gets captured at 16 and he's there for about seven years so during those formative years of his teen teens and his early 20s he actually records in his own writings that so great was his love and his relationship to the Lord that he would often pray a hundred times a day amen while he was 10 to the herds and then he would pray a hundred more times at night in fact as he he he records one time that he stayed on the mountain side in freezing weather with freezing rain and sleep uh so that just so that he could rise very early the next morning and be on the hill and so he could start praying immediately and he didn't have to Journey there and start praying he could just wake up and start praying amen this was the dedication of Patrick and actually he one night he had a dream that he he's he's somewhere in his early to mid 20s and he had a dream that he got on a ship out in the ocean and it took him home to Britain and sure enough the very next day guess what he was on a ship headed to Britain and he fled his captors and ran off and they they didn't manage to catch him until it was too late he was already on the boat and there was others with him who had made a big big dash for it and escaped on this ship and when they got back to to Britain it's like a three-day Voyage as best I could find but even when they got back to Britain they you know it wasn't the UK as we know it today but he had about a almost 25 to 30 days of walking through the Wilderness just trying to get back home he just they just made it to the island and and then he had you know 28 days I think is one number that I heard uh that he he finally got back to his family and and you know and they were starving and all the people who were with him started to taunt him and say Patrick we're going to die of starvation where's that God of yours and Patrick basically told them the same thing Joon of Arc told the French army God can't bless us if you're cussing and drinking and there's women following the camp you got to get rid of all these can't prostitutes you got to throw out all your alcohol you got to stop cursing and taking the lord's name in vain and the and the French army said okay uh Joan that's what we'll do and they did it and then she started winning battles Patrick told him the same thing I stand in this pull pit and tell you the same thing you want the power of God moving in your life you need to get rid of the world you need to push out brother Ram said push out the world and the Lord will come in and occupy that place is that what you want friends oh oh that's what I want so much I want to I want to I want to have a vision I want to have the power of the Risen Christ and so he began to tell them if you you're going to have to dedicate your heart you know I I I'm dedicated but you're going to need to be dedicated if you get dedicated God will preserve us and they did and he did and they came actually they they stumbled upon a herd of of abandoned swine that were themselves half starved so they were they were they really were too weak to even run away so the people were able to kill and eat and they were sustained and he got home to his parents and then and then he in but before actually I left this out before he got home to his parents the poor brother got captured again but the Lord came to him uh in the night and said Patrick told him in an audible voice said don't worry you'll only be captured for two two days and you'll be free and sure enough on the third day he managed to get his freedom and he made his way home and then he was there with his parents for a little season and then that voice of the Lord come back to him again and he started having dreams had like three or four dreams in a row three or four nights in a row and he kept seeing uh people from Ireland saying Patrick come back to us Patrick come back to us we need your help Patrick come back and over the cries of his parents I mean here's a young man that had just had just fled captivity for seven years and now he's going to go back but I'm going to tell you what he he he formed over 200 churches he baptized personally baptized a 100,000 people I mean this this man was serious about his relationship to God and on on on and so Christianity began to take over and you had this uh this this King uh it's it's pronounced almost like we would say the word Larry it's laori and and if you say it in Irish it sounds like they're saying I actually consulted a a a gallic or n or Celtic whatever that language that they speak in the old country and he said no it's it's pronounced Larry and I said well it sounds like Larry I have an Uncle Larry and and so so he he was the king of Tara and the reason that the the reason that the hill was so attached to St Patrick is because he got tired of of all these this Christian growth of Christianity now remember brother brandham said the Catholic Church claims St Patrick and brother Bram said he was no more Catholic than I am said he spoke in tongues and raised the dead and the power God moved in his life he was definitely not Catholic and so this kid King Larry the king of Tara he made a proclamation that no one on on the on Sunday this the coming Sunday could light a fire and so well he was talking to the wrong brother because when Patrick got a hold of that decree and the King had said whoever does it he was the king of Ireland said wasn't just teror he was actually the Ancient King of and he said whoever does it I'll put him to death Patrick went straight to that hill and he didn't just light a fire he built a bonfire and and you could see that fire look at look it into the into the distance you could see that fire for miles and miles away I'm going to tell you something friends this is a this this was a brother who you're kin to this man knew the Holy Ghost like you know the Holy Ghost this man will be in glory like you're in glory I can't wait to meet him I want to say Patrick oh tell me about the days when you defied the the king Lowry and you built your bonfire on the hill tell me about 200 churches and a 100,000 baptisms my so so brother brandham says it like this now because I'll read you that one in a second let me let me catch this note first so so we when we think about this poem The the hymn are really the the the poem expresses the desire to have God as your vision that was what that Saint whatever his name was Dian or whatever his name was that's what he was writing about and his inspiration was off of St Patrick and his courageous Hilltop bonfire and so and so that's why they they actually they the it they actually called it originally the poem was uh using that title of slain S L A and E referring to that hill so it expresses the desire to have God as the vision to have God in your wisdom to have God as your Delight to have God as your shelter there's a big one to have God as your treasure you're going to have to decide do you want riches or Treasures that's a big decision here in leoa Friends make your choice tonight you want you want riches or you want Treasures I'll take Treasures Hallelujah if I'm going to get riches it's going to be gold tried in the fire the song expresses the desire to have God as the ruler of your life the text of the poem is actually a prayer that asks for the presence of God in every aspect of the speaker's life in other words if you're going to get on your knees and pray the prayer of slain then you're going to be asking God to be present in every aspect of your life it asks that God be your meditation be your speech be your understanding amen the prayer goes on to ask God uh God's protection in battle as well as to preserve your dignity and to just downright be your Delight he is he is my delight amen whoever is praying this prayer slain is is seeking Refuge in God and it and it and actually has the audacity to ask God that they someday be raised up to live with the angels the prayer ends with a plea for God's love to be in their heart and their soul and above all for them to be granted a place in the Kingdom of Heaven where do you want to retire friends for me the Kingdom of Heaven is all I long for brother brandham says it this way one of my favorite quotes I started to play in the soundtrack tonight but I didn't I just want you to be able to read it in his Hebrews series Hebrews chapter 2 number two he says this God must have first place in your heart yes amen first first place in your life first place in almost everything who's reading with me so so you need to have two responses amen or uhuh he wants to be first place in almost everything uhuh in everything and everything that you do or what you are God must be first he doesn't want the second place he doesn't deserve the second place oh my is that ever true is that true friends Jesus Paid a terrible price to be first in your life come on teenagers come on young people he paid a horrible price that no one else was willing to pay on your behalf and you you couldn't pay it and and and if all the population of the Earth paid it it still wouldn't have done you any good the only one who could do it did it I want to start again God must have first place in your heart first place in your life first place in everything that you do or what you are God must be first am he doesn't want the second place he doesn't deserve the second place he deserves the best and the first and all that we got I hope that's your desire tonight I mean here you are you I don't know what you might have expected that you might hear on a Wednesday night but I hope that the word of God is challenging you deep down inside your heart to say my goodness I'm part of a great family of God and I got to count for something I didn't get here by accident somebody put me here some great being and he has a he has an exact mission that I'm on he has a life that he wants to live through me I I just say Lord I feel so privileged I feel so privileged you'd want me me yes you and you and you yes have a revelation have a Redemptive Revelation have a vision of God not just who he is but who you are not just who he is and who you are but him in you and what he's looking looking for you to accomplish in your life oh friends throw aside the world no wonder Paul would say lay aside the things that so easily beset you lay them aside so that you can run the race Paul says there's no there's no um no military person allows himself to be encumbered with the things of the world so that he may please his Commanding Officer says one translation the original poem in English listen close I started to put this up but I I didn't on purpose because I just want to read it and I want you just to take it in fact is be thou my vision oh lord of my heart none other is ought to me but the king of the heavens that's the poem that's the original poem don't think of the song in your head this is the original poem be thou my vision oh lord of my heart none other is ought but the king of the heavens and fact is when that sixth Century Saint wrote it in the actual poem he wrote seven Heavens so I don't know what kind of Dogma that came from but I know that Paul said I was caught up to the third heaven so we're not I'm not going to get into all of that but I I'm just gonna I'm just going to read it like that none other is ought but the king of the heavens listen to this now be thou my meditation by day and night may it be thou that I behold ever in my sleep be thou my speech be thou my understanding be thou with me be I with thee be thou my father be I thy son mayest thou be mine and may I be thine be thou my
