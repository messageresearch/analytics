So when we were uh so what does the world see when it sees you? Amen. I just um with a Sunday school lesson like that, you know, I can look back. I'm in the later stages of life, have grandkids and stuff and I can see where my children are at and I can I can beat myself up actually. You know, there so many so many instances where I think, you know, I could have done things differently. But the um problem is at that time I didn't. So I'm still looking at the grace of God today, you know, that says without him I can do nothing but with him I can do all things and I can believe in the token [Music] that can do things that I can't do. Amen. I love the Lord this morning. You love the Lord. Are you thankful for what he has done? Amen. Yes. We're fallen in a fallen condition. But you know that a sacrifice that he made, it overrules it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Total victory in Christ. Amen. Let's pray. Father, I love you this morning. And Lord, I can look at I can't point fingers at anybody else, Father. No one else is living in this vessel. No one else is living this life that I walk in these shoes. But I pray that you help me, Father. And as I ask that you help each and every one of us, Father, Lord, you've set a goal and a purpose before us. Help us to meet that, Lord. You made the way. You finished the work at Calvary. Father, you died for the sins of the world. Redeeming grace. &gt;&gt; Thank you &gt;&gt; for God's fallen grace. We love you this morning.

Give us a renewed strength and vigor to to walk before you so that the world will see something besides ourselves that they will see you. As we collect the tithes and offerings, Father, I pray that you bless the cheerful giver and Lord, I'm so thankful that you have a see your forgetfulness.

Let's give Sister Sarah a little welcome. [Applause] [Music] From strength to strength we sometimes go. Then again we're sinking low in the shadow of a ming looming high above our heads. We need not fear what lies ahead. For the word has clearly said that our faith would be sufficient to see the mountain disappear. Speak to the mountain. You'll not triumph over me. Be thou removed from here to yonder. Disappear into the sea. Speak to the mountain and speak with authority. [Music] And that mountain will move and you will claim victory. [Applause] [Music] In the midst of the battle, when the foe is gaining ground, just look up and see the mighty hand of God. He's reaching down. Oh, speak God's name and Satan trembles. Speak God's words and watch him flame. Once again, my God delivers. The mountain crumbles and your face. So speak to the mountain. You'll not triumph over me. Be thou removed from here to yonder. Disappear into the sea. Speak to your mountain and speak with authority. [Music] And that mountain must move. And you will claim it. Victory. Speak to the mountain. You'll not triumph over me.

[Music] We are almost [Music] I know that the cross brought heaven to us. But make no mistake, there's still more to come. When our flesh and our bones are no longer between. Where we are right now.

Let's sing this as we invite the minister to come. There's nothing worth more that could ever come close. Nothing can compare. It's our living home. [Music] Your presence, Lord, I've tasted and seen.

Say, "God bless you." Amen. Praise the Lord. Glad to see my grandson standing in the back back there. Welcome, brother Micah. Where you been all my life, bro? Amen. Praise God. Man, you love the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's good to be a Christian, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Sure was enjoying all that worship and I was listening um from the Sunday school on and uh just enjoying that class and then the to hear the worship get underway and uh I just was paying close attention to even the songs brother Ken was using and and I just thought it was such a ministry. I and the um the specials, you know, hearing Sister Sarah sing and you know, I I just love it when you know, you can just be right in the middle of something and just still sing out to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. And so sure was appreciating that, Sister Sarah. That song Brother Aaron sung. My I love that song. Told him I might have him come up at the end and sing it again. Not sure. We'll see how the anointing goes, but I sure loved it. Amen. Luke chapter 21. Amen. We want to continue today in our 10th installment. I I hope I tr I am going to make an attempt to finish this series. Amen. We'll see. Um give you the give you the give you the the Trump oneliner. We'll see. We'll see. I don't know. We'll see. Amen. I want to say, Mr. President, do you know anything? We'll see. Amen. Praise the Lord. Luke 21. Now, normally we would read this passage out of Matthew 24. And we probably will go there. It's in my notes to go there and and refer to it because it's what's most familiar. It's where brother Brandham would go into Matthew 24 over and over and over again. That's where, you know, many shall come in my name and many false Christs, many false prophets and deceive many. And um the reason I'm choosing Luke today on purpose is to just attach in your mind that that this is the continuation of of a dissertation he's having that you would be familiar with starting in Luke 17. As it was in the days of Lot, &gt;&gt; as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the son of man. A lot of times we read Luke 17 and30 and we read it in isolation like like as if it's just one little, you know, and I've even had it said to me, that's a that's a little bit of a thin case. You're just going to that you're picking out one verse, but I'm not. It's actually a whole medley of of things that he's saying and it's a continual flow of what Jesus is prophesying uh concerning what's going to happen in the ages, concerning what's going to happen at the beginning of the church, the middle of the church, and the end of the church. And he and so coming from Luke 17, we won't have to turn there because you're so familiar with it that as it was in the days of Noah, as it was in the days of Lot, so shall it be in the coming of the son of man. Right &gt;&gt; now, continuing on in his here's his here's the rest of his sermon notes. Luke 2:15. And some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts. He said, "As for these things which ye behold, the days will come in which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down." and referring to a coming prophecy when Titus would surround the city, besiege the city, all the Christians would escape and and the the temple they were so proud of would be thrown down. Not even a stone left. You see the whailing wall? That's because they re reerected that. See it? There was not one stone left. So, so he goes on, "And they asked him saying verse 7, master, when shall these things be? And what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?" So you're you remember when you read that from Matthew's gospel and I rather suppose it's why brother Brandham used Matthew is because Luke only presents it as two questions where Matthew sees the nuance and there's actually it's three questions and and brother Brandham says you've got to make sure you understand he's answering three questions. What will be the sign of thy coming? See what will when will these things be? What will be the sign of thy coming? comma and of the end of the world. And if you don't capture that, then it just it just sounds like Jesus is just saying everything about one event. He's actually teaching what's going to happen over 2,000 years. Only no one knew that. It's going to happen over seven contiguous ages. Only no one knew that. You see, even when John comes back with the book of Revelation, the mystery is sealed up. And no one understands that it the the church is going to go into the ground and it's going to go into darkness. It's going to be a thousand years of just darkness called the dark ages. And then he'll begin. Oh, so then the rapture comes after that. No, he's got to first come and start with justification. And that's going to run for hundreds of years. Hundreds. Yeah. And then hundreds after that, a sanctification's going to come on the scene. My goodness. When are we getting out of here? Well, after that, there's got to be a restoration of some power. The church is missing. Okay. then that power is going to take us home. No, that won't even be the full message. It'll there'll be a an end time gentile prophet who will come and bring the opening of the of the word. Okay, then we can go home. Well, that prophet thought that. &gt;&gt; People who followed him thought that. Here we are almost seven decades later. I'll be honest with you. I I I already expected that we would be several decades into into the millennium by now. Imagine that. Imagine if we were already several decades into the millennium thinking, "Oh my goodness, you remember back remember that day back in the day." But here we are still fighting the greatest battle ever fought, the one that spilled over out of heaven into the garden. It's still raging today. &gt;&gt; See? All right. So, so, so, so he says, and and then here in the seventh verse, he only breaks it into two questions. Luke doesn't quite catch the nuance of the third that it's three questions. At least if he caught it, he didn't write it as such. Verse eight, and he said, "Take heed that you be not deceived. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and the time draweth near. Go ye not therefore after them. But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified, for these things must first come to pass. But the end is not by and by. Then said he unto them, "Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom." So that's going to go on all down through the church ages. You're not going to really get any anything to notice beyond nation rising against nation until you get to the to the woes &gt;&gt; at the end time. And now it's not just nation rising against nation. It's global war. It's never happened in the earth. And then the first wo is going to lead into the second woe. And that's even going to be a larger 50 nations. &gt;&gt; 100 million uh armed soldiers committed to that war. How many I think 50 million civilians died in that war. So it's global. So it's it's you know he he's saying you you'll hear these things wars and rumors of wars. Nations rise against nations. You don't understand it now, but this is going to go on for 2,000 years. Uh but but but when you but remember what I said. When you see the days of Lot and Noah return simultaneously and you see that and Jesus would say in Matthew 24, when you see all these things, and brother Brandon would say all these other things, all these things, not just one sign. We don't cabbage down on one sign. It's all these things. See, then you know that it's at the door. Lift up your heads. Your redemption draweth nigh. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word today. And we're committing ourselves into your hands for service. Now, looking to you, the author and finisher of our faith. Commit it to you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you, friends. You can be seated. So, um, Brother Mark, let's have my uh PowerPoint. Amen. So, future events becoming clear in prophecy. And I'm just going to be very uh studious to stick with my notes. I because I have a great bit to say and I I have an order that I want to say it in. I feel that is under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. And don't we're not going to wear you out. So just hang on. Will you do it? Amen. Give me some undivided attention for a little bit. Amen. Try to not be Americans. I know you are, but try to try to try to not be too much of an American today. Poor thing. So Amen. So, brother Brandham would say here in questions and answers 1964. Now, this logos that was in him which was the spirit of God, the anointing through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sons to God which is anointed with this same logos. Isn't that a beautiful That's almost poetry. That same logos that was in him is in you. See? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, he he's going to begin to explain what now first he's in Jesus in his earthly ministry. But now he's going to exp he's going to start tackling the whole idea that Jesus said, "I go away, but I'm coming back and the world won't see me, but you'll see me because I'll be in you and you'll recognize my word moving in your midst. Although the world won't still won't, no more than they recognize me as I'm alive, they won't recognize me in you either." &gt;&gt; See, and they'll they'll say all manner of things Jesus warned them. They'll throw you in prison and kill you thinking they're doing God a service. Even Paul with all of his training uh started out like that. So it doesn't matter, you know, what kind of training you have, you you have to be inspirable to receive the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; All right? And God does that in his own timing. You would think, well, Paul got it because he had read the word. Paul had read the word since a child. See? And so, but he it still took the Holy Spirit to make it clear. This is why bibl Bible apologetics have never saved the world &gt;&gt; because you can explain the scriptures. But apologists argue with one another. So, this is why I love the reason this is why I love brother Brandham's sensible way of saying that God interprets his word by bringing it to pass. &gt;&gt; So, that puts an end to the argument. You cannot now you can still argue and people still argue that these signs do not follow the believer but yet they actually do &gt;&gt; and we're witnesses of it. But that still doesn't convince the gains. &gt;&gt; So do we go out and argue with them and and and and jostle with them and have a have a have a sword fight with them. There's no value in that because even if you could persuade them, someone else could dissuade them. They've got to have a revelation. So we preach the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul said that will convince the gainser. If they can be convinced, that's what will do it. And if that won't do it, then there's nothing else that's going to do it. So, we stick with that. All right. So, now he's he's going to go from the from the days of Jesus, the logos living in him, and now he's going to go to the day of Pentecost where the logos began to live in his church. All right. Now on the day of Pentecost, it come down that pillar of fire and broke apart like that. And tongues of fire set upon each of them, not their tongue tongues, but tongues of fire set upon each of them a elected selected group identified. Catch it. They're identified by this pillar of fire showing that God had separated himself into man. Isn't that beautiful? God the logos separated himself into man. God not in one person. He's in his church. Universal. That's the reason Jesus said, "The works that I do shall you do also." Doesn't that make so much sense? Now, I know the King James says greater, but the right translation there is more than this shall you do. God was bottled and confined in one man, Jesus Christ. Later on, brother Brandon's going to come back around back to this statement and say, you know, I used to always believe it was just simply more. But he said it it occurred to me in the woods there that he did something even Jesus didn't do in his earthly ministry that he went all the way back to Genesis power and said, "Let there be." And he said, "Just say where it is." He said, "Let him let him come out and run out that limb and look at that farmer." And it happened. So I so you you have to acknowledge that we have arrived at a place in prophecy where prophecy is becoming clear in a way that it had not happened even in the ministry of Jesus or the early church &gt;&gt; where it's actually not just more but it's actually greater. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; In in a in a sense greater in a sense it's all God doing it. &gt;&gt; All right. So So now but but remember the pillar of fire was he couldn't even he's in the woods and he doesn't even see the pillar of fire and that troubles him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he even says that on tape. He says he says I kept looking around. Normally I see that light. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he said, 'I And I started and Brother Brandham gets beside himself. He's feeling like he's going insane. And he said, I said, ' Where are you? Who are you? What do you want? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't think a man that had spent that many decades in the in that presence could have got so, you know, unscrewed like that. &gt;&gt; So, I'm here to tell you something, friends. Let me just say this that whatever is happening in the bride today and God working in your life, I promise you it'll be more than you understand or can comprehend. And you just have to say, Lord, be it unto me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It it won't make all sense to you to say nothing of it making sense to the world. You're only going to become more odd. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're going to become so odd, so weird, so you're just going to vanish. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the last thing they know of you, where'd he go? I don't know. Dude was crazy. I don't even know where. No wonder. No telling where he's at now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, wherever I'll be, uh, I will be. &gt;&gt; I won't just be gone. I will be. I will still be thinking. Therefore, I will still be being. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now I know so he says here God was bottled and confined in one man Jesus Christ. Now he's going on. All right. So he says but now he's bottled and confined in the whole church the whole universal church of the living God. Then watch the works of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; It among us proves the same Jesus that once lived in Palestine, the same spirit was upon him has come up through a body until it's come back to headship again, which he's coming soon to claim that body. So the whole process of Pentecost and then that seed going to the ground and a thousand years of dark ages and the restoration of it coming back through four stages back to where the fruit is ripe in the type in the top of the tree ripening. See ripening for the body change because you don't you just because you grow wheat you you le let's use corn for a second. You can you can grow corn and you can get it back to seed and you can pull the ear off and it's eatable. It's consumable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's not plantable. &gt;&gt; It's got to it's got to be dried out. You can't just pull that eatable corn and squeeze it and juice pop you in the eye and then go put that in the ground. That won't do anything. It'll you'll it it won't germinate because it hasn't had enough time to to dry out. Wheat's the same way. It's still green. It's got to lay in the presence of the sun. See, so that's why the church had to go into the ground. People who say that early church didn't have the invisible union with Christ, didn't have the token, didn't have the abstract deed, weren't the perfect church. Well, then how were they planted? &gt;&gt; Because they went into the ground. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they and if and if they hadn't been plantable, they were consumable and God was using them. But if they hadn't been plantable, there would have been no resurrection of the seed coming back. It would have never germinated. See? So the very fact that that they were planted in the ground shows that God had them plantable. &gt;&gt; See, now you're coming back to you're coming back to being plantable. Only the modern event made clear of prophecy in this day which is you is not that you're going to be planted and another age coming. You're going to get a body change. &gt;&gt; You're going into a glorified state because you have reached once again that mature state. They couldn't receive that because the the names were still had to be filled up. They had to go into the ground. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. I'm I'm ahead of myself, so I may repeat that in a little bit, but let me carry on. I promise the Lord I would just follow him today. So he says here, all right, 11:16, then watch the works of it because that identifies it. among us &gt;&gt; proves the same Jesus that once lived in Palestine. The same spirit was upon him has come up through the body until it's come back to headship again which he's coming soon to claim that body. Amen. The heads coming to the body. It's a spirit. Now, if you if you um if you go find these quotes, you're going to find that I'm taking some out and you'll see dot dot dot or or it'll be dot dot dot and it'll continue. That's just because I'm taking out extraneous stuff that that could break your thought. You can you I always say go back and hear the tape yourself, but but don't don't execute me because I'm doing that because I'm I'm just trying. Brother Brandon is actually running two thoughts at once and it gets a little confusing and I didn't want that to happen to you. So, I just got out the relevant points. I'm trying to teach today. Good. Everybody good? &gt;&gt; All right. So, amen. The head's coming to the body. It's in spirit form. which was upon the Son of Man, and has come now to anoint sons of man to bring back a ministry just exactly like he said it would be in order for the head and the rest of the body to connect together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, carry on. Just like the pyramid as Enoch built. And we find in that pyramid, they never did get the headstone on it. Why? The headstones yet to come. Those stones are laying in there so per um those stones are laying in there so perfect. And that top where the Koopa like in the top of it, when that stone comes, it'll be like a great diamond fitting right down in there just perfect with it. Now, this is events. These are modern events surrounding the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But remember, the rapture is not just a calendar event. The rapture is a people. &gt;&gt; The resurrection is not just an event on a calendar. Jesus said, "I am the resurrection." So the resurrection is manifestation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See? All right. You're thinking with me? &gt;&gt; Carry on. You just hold on. Keep We're going to keep going. So he says, um, like a diamond fitting right down in there, just perfect with it. Now, watch this. Here's why he the rapture couldn't come in the ages or even at the end of the first age or even at the days when the church in those first couple decades was running perfect under the teaching of the apostles and prophets. Now that stone would not fit down there on the bottom foundation talking about the capstone. &gt;&gt; Neither will it fit on the second foundation or the third foundation. It'll only fit on the top foundation when the entire building has become fitted to the stone, not the stone to the building, the building to the stone. When he has heuned his church and and and and that's what's happening. That's what's happening in your life today. God is hewing you, getting you to fit him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So he says um it'll only fit on the top foundation when the entire building has become fitted to the stone. And Jesus cannot come until the church, a body of believers and the ministry that he once left will have to be the same as it was then too. And then that brings them now he's going to go into Hebrews 11. them without us is not made perfect. Without us, they cannot be perfected without without us accomplishing our part. The the the dead in Christ that's been dead for hundreds of years cannot raise. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice what he says here. Uh Jesus cannot come into that church, a body of believers in the ministry that he once left. All right? So, now you've got to have a body of believers. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when can he come? When the last name on the roll is full. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that's not all. &gt;&gt; It's all it's the it's the believers all of them and that ministry working. Say, well, so we got to wait for the last believer to get this kind of ministry. I don't think so. I think that ministry is working right now and we're trying to find the last believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, but the only point I'm wanting to make is is they've got to come together. &gt;&gt; So, the body of believers and the ministry that he once left and as a conjunction that he once left will have to be the same then as it was then too. And then that brings them without us is not made perfect. Paul said Hebrews 11, without us they cannot be perfected. They must have this ministry. This is the end time believers. &gt;&gt; They must have this ministry to raise up the Lutheran Wesley's and all of them down through their ages. When that come when that part of the where the eagles gathered, just as the carcass is, the eagles will be gathered. You remember in in a previous installment, we showed you that Jesus starts talking like he's he's he's going to go somewhere nobody can reach him. and and and one of the disciples say where Lord and Jesus says whethersoever the carcass is the eagles will be gathered. So he's not leaving to go to Alpha Centuri. &gt;&gt; He's not leaving to go beyond our reach. He he the word of God is mighty even in thy mouth. He'd be not far from any of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand? He's gathered. We're gathered around the word. If you want to gather with him corporally, then gather around his corporal body, which is his word, not not ink on paper, but this word living these prophecies becoming flesh, so that you are the modern event made clear you are the word. And when that is happening in the last name, then can come Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To take a bride in a rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so it's when, so it's when this gospel that as we said to you that Jesus said, when the when the when the when the gospel of the son of man, when this gospel is preached into all the world, what gospel? Well, you're pretty hopeless if you're depending on 33,000 different versions of the gospel north of I heard the latest one I heard was maybe it's approaching 40,000 uh organizations and and associations and independent groups of of Christian uh are are flooding the airwaves. The internet is filled with them. Everybody's got an opinion. Oh, and I and I did so did my said my heart is so good. The other day I was sitting there and I I was uh watching something concerning history. And when I when I did, I went to the next one and I and I had been hearing all these voices and I I I'm sorry. I don't even have the tolerance. And I just go pass, go pass, go pass. And all of a sudden, I come and it's Brother Jason and he's got this new format and it looks so clean and so fresh and he's just right there. And I thought, "Oh my goodness, there's the word right there. I hope everybody is seeing this one." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm pushing likes. Yes. Amen. Oh, hallelujah. I want to tell you something, friends, that we have not believed cunningly devised tales. &gt;&gt; We are coming to the rapture of the church of Jesus Christ. And the word that we've held for all these decades, I know we thought we would be decades deep in the millennium. We're only not because there's still names to be filled and there's still a dynamic power to grow among us. &gt;&gt; Not just arrive, but to grow something that's already here. &gt;&gt; So, I'm not waiting for another revival or another message or another messenger. &gt;&gt; We're looking for the coming of the Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; It's hard to fathom that the coming of the Lord that the world has been waiting on for 2,000 years began in me and you. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, no, but that's a diff." No, it's not a It's the exact coming. &gt;&gt; Shout, voice, trumpet. &gt;&gt; Right? See, because everybody has an idea that the coming of Christ is like, you know, a great golden escalator drops down and an angel steps out on a cloud, blows a trumpet, an escalator drops down, Jesus comes down and takes everybody home to heaven. That's a fantasy, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to be You say, "Well, isn't the whole world going to see him?" They are, but they're not going to be happy. They're wailing because they see him. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so we realize that the rapture has the cycle of the rapture is already well underway. And when I say I thought we'd be three or four decades deep into the millennium, I'm just simply saying I thought the cycle would have long ago had us there. But I know this, I'm still in the cycle. &gt;&gt; I'm still moving in that direction. &gt;&gt; And I'm not moving there because I'm can do it under my own power. I'm so great. It's just that he he prophesied it and he prophesied that it would be in flesh and I'm it and you're it. &gt;&gt; And not because I was good but because I have believed the report &gt;&gt; and when it came my way it began to speak to me. &gt;&gt; See? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when the ministry of the son of man has gone into all the world is a is a is a is a a higher understanding. Jesus is saying when this gospel the gospel you say so you say well what do you base that on well what was he when he says this gospel was the gospel doctrine the new testament had even been written yet so is Jesus just saying and I don't even know maybe it's u maybe brother JD would know I don't even know if those words when this gospel is preached is in all four gospels so if it's not then is he just saying we only need the gospel that it appears in or one or two others that it appears in. And I don't need the rest of the gospel. I don't need the acts. I don't need any of the letters. So that's ridiculous. So what he's talking about is a manifestation of the word. What is he? The word made flesh. He's a human, but yet he's a god man. And the and the logos which came out of God which led Israel is living inside of him and living through him. When that repeats at the end time, when a people stand on the earth at the end time after seven ages have completed and that gospel of the word made flesh lives in people again, that's the gospel he's referring to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no question we're talking about the end of the world. That's what he says. When this gospel is preached, then the end will come. So that he's certainly talking about the end time. So that's that's when the end will come. Why? Why will why will that be true? Because there would be no reason for it to continue. &gt;&gt; All the names making up the gentile bride will have been redeemed. Hallelujah. Recovered from Satan. Hallelujah. Free from the law of sin and death. Hallelujah. there be no need for it to keep going on into another age. The tribulation can ensue. Moses and Elijah can uh go forward to get Benjamin. You remember Benjamin who was born while Joseph was away while Joseph was away getting a gentile bride. Benjamin was born. So while Christ has been away getting married to a gentile bride, you know, just like Joseph took Azenath there. It's so amazing because he pulled her out of a heathen a heathen priest family. She came from a family of priesthood and they worshiped the son god. Hallelujah. And he she's going to marry a man who's going to show her who the real god is. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Friends, I'm glad he took me out of out of cold formal heathen idolatry and has introduced me to the same pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah is right. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the first church age going into the ground, it it served God's plan and it must need to have happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, friends, do we really imagine that he would let them go into the ground if he wasn't absolutely certain that his word could bring them back again? Oh my. Oh my. And then and then as if that but wait, there's more. And then he's going to hinge it all. The whole plan he's going to let them go into the ground through seven ages. It doesn't matter because in Luther's day, Wesley's day and Isuza day and at the end time, he's going to have a people that the gospel returns and there's going to be a people who believe the report and become the prophecy. &gt;&gt; See, so actually your complete faith in the word of this day is what's going to carry it out. &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham would say, and I don't I didn't put these up on the slide. I only I finished with my slides, but let me just read you these two. I've read them before. I want to touch on them again. So, the the reason I'm reading them is is to make the point I just said. He let them go into the ground certain he could bring them back. &gt;&gt; See? Certain that it would that that and and he had no problem. He had no problem. He didn't take counsel with anybody. He never has to go back to the drawing board again. &gt;&gt; He had no hesitation at all to hinge the whole plan uh uh on his word perfecting your and my faith at the end time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I know you say, "How how does that help me, brother Jason?" Well, it helps me because I know that my faith ain't going to get it done, &gt;&gt; but I know I'm living because of his faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so your complete faith in the word of this day is what's going to carry that out. This is exactly why brother Brham could say could make this statement from uh 1963. What shall I do with Jesus called Christ? The dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone. Now you should be fully versed on the headstone. We just read the quotes. While the headstone is coming down to unite with the body, listen. But when that head, that's Christ and body, that's you, unites together, the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that. Even the dead that's been dead in Christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of his holiness and take a flight to the skies. The dynamics is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'm not I'm not trying to go back and recreate an Isuza revival. I'm not trying to go that was a great revival. I'm not going to be limited to that &gt;&gt; any more than I'd be limited to the Welsh revival preceding it by about a year or two. Neither would I be any more uh agreed to be limited there than the Armenian revival that struck Russia a decade prior to the Welsh revival. It's all it's all the open door set up at the end of the sixth age which was a a beginning of the revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ and the Armenians caught it in Russia &gt;&gt; in the late 1800s and and the zar that they had actually promoted it when his son came on. He crushed it and Nicholas completely crushed it. Completely uh nationalized all their churches and ended that revival and it jumped across the channel and landed and in in Welsh land and became and in Wales and became a Welsh revival and then lasted about a year and a half, two years, jumped over the pond landed in a at a zuna street and a little mission &gt;&gt; and shook the place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, and it's all that that wasn't any greater than Wesley's. It was just a further part. It restored some power they didn't have. It was a little gr a little greater by that sense. A little greater in that same sense than than Luther. See, which Luther was a a millennial leap from the dark ages. So you understand it's God continually building towards something. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says here, so so I'm not I'm not trying to recreate an Isuza or a Welsh or an Armenian revival, but I sure like what they found. &gt;&gt; I sure like having that in my recipe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What I'm looking for, Brother Brandham said, I he said, I'm not looking for another revival. I'm looking for the coming of the Lord. What brings the coming of the Lord, the opening of the seventh seal, the mystery of God revealed? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a word revival that is packed full of justification, sanctification, and the power of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, why would I avoid it? Why would I worry about it? &gt;&gt; It's all part of God's plan. It's all restoring back to bring the seed back to plantable stage again. Only this time, we don't get planted, we get raptured. &gt;&gt; Is this making sense to you friends? So this is why now brother Brandham he after he makes that statement the dynamics is the Holy Spirit that's uh November end of 1963 the headstone coming down to unite with the body when the head body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost raise her up dead in Christ for hundreds of years will raise then he comes on about a year and a half later he's now in the uh not quite a year and a half he's almost he's coming to the spring of February 1965 who is this Maze being eternal with him. Now, I've read this, but it's been way back in other ones, so I want to give you a fresh reading of it. You good? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I got lots of time. You good? &gt;&gt; So, I hope you appreciate me going methodically slow &gt;&gt; and I'm just taking it point by point by point because I don't want you to get lost in the shuffle. When I hear to just shout, we don't even know what we're shouting about. &gt;&gt; Right. where where our enthusiasm is based on the word of God and that I see myself in it. &gt;&gt; You talking about make me shout. I want to shout and run. &gt;&gt; But I have a duty to stand here and keep preaching. &gt;&gt; Who is this Melzdc? Now you remember I've taught you when you go back and listen to who is this Melzdc? Just remember that that only about the first quarter, maybe a third, you could argue a third, but not more than a third of it, a quarter to a third of it, he's identifying who MelzDC was, that he was pre, he was he was God, &gt;&gt; in a human being &gt;&gt; and discerning the secrets of the heart. He's only doing that to show that his ministry is a replication of that &gt;&gt; because it discerns the secrets of the heart. And he's doing that to show Pentecost. Somewhat of a misnomer because Pentecost is not a denomination. Brother Random would constantly say that it's an experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Although he used it, I'll use it. He used it. I get it. Uh but we understand the real Pentecost is the original. It's the jubilee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's what gave them the abstract title in the upper room. Brother Brandham said they had the title. They needed the abstract, which was the spirit falling upon them. And again, as we were showing last time, only the paradox of God could come down and divide himself and not diminish himself in doing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's paradoxical. How does he divide himself? But he doesn't become less. He doesn't become less at all. He becomes more. &gt;&gt; And that he divided himself. See, &gt;&gt; so he he's he's moving into his kingdom, which was always going to be the plan. That was always going to be the plan. That's why when God in the beginning and he created man in his image, he created his whole family. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram teaches that so clearly. He created his whole family. He's got his whole kingdom in his in his vision. Let us make man. You know, theologians argue over and they bring it down and they're trying to, you know, uh thread the eye of a needle. My goodness, you're missing the whole greater point. &gt;&gt; The whole thing is he's building a kingdom of kings and priests. He's got a civilization in his mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the whole fall is all going to serve and work according to his plan. He's going to bring it back anyway. He didn't He wasn't worried to let you be born in sin because he knew he could recover the seed in you. And if he recovers the seed in you, you go with the seed. So it's not the man that comes predestinated. It's the seed of God inside the man. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's the part that came from God and goes back to God and can't not can't not go back to God. &gt;&gt; So it says here and I I'm reading this quote to you again because I just want to get this one line. being eternal with him at the beginning. The eternal life that you had his thought of what you was only he wanted to he wanted me to stand in the pull pit say he wanted you to sit in the seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then we are serving his eternal purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I get it. We're just weak mortal humans. It didn't occur to us today when your feet hit the floor, oh my goodness, I got to get ready. I got to get kids ready. We got to get to church. We got to get breakfast. We got to get get out the rain. What are we going to do? Here comes an announcement. What? Do you understand that? The from the moment your feet hit the floor, you were walking in God's eternal purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the while, while I was studying and preparing, I was preparing for his eternal purpose. See, &gt;&gt; you need to think like that because if you think like that, then the little trivial trials of this life won't mean all that much to you. Paul said, "Someday it'll become so real. This life, it won't even be worth mentioning. We worth talking about. The things that we weep and grind and cry and roll and throw dirt in the air and and and and want to die and it won't Paul said it won't even be worth talking about." &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Said, "Someday on the other side you'll sit down under a tree. You'll think about stuff like that, you'll sit down under a tree and just laugh. I'm glad I get to laugh. I'm glad in all the pain, all the loss, and all the suffering, all the bewilderment, all the confusion, all the trials, one day I get to laugh. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad to know there's no devil that can stop it. &gt;&gt; And and when I'm laughing, it won't be long after that he won't be &gt;&gt; being eternal with him. I keep starting again at the beginning the eternal life that you had his thought of what you was only he wanted you he wanted me to stand in the pull pit he wanted you to sit in the seat then we are serving his eternal purpose now here's the line and the one that left home &gt;&gt; only come to the earth to serve his purpose I want you just to remember that the one that left home see he's tapping into an eternal purpose this is so beyond is your car running right, is the light bill paid, is the groceries, the refrigerator full of food, you know, do I got friends? Do who guess who said what about me? You know, the whole purpose is an eternal purpose that just flies right over the top of all that stuff. And I realized that the one that left home. I'm going to read it like this. And when I left home, &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; I only came here to the earth to serve his purpose. Brother Jason, who are you and why are you here? I'm an eternal being. &gt;&gt; If in case you didn't know, God bless you, Brother Jason Watkins. I'm an eternal being. &gt;&gt; I didn't start here. I'm not finishing here. I came from God. I'm going back to God. Why are you here? I'm only here to serve his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You going to keep preaching to us if that serves his purpose? &gt;&gt; Can I be your friend if that serves his purpose? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Will Will you have trials if that serves his purpose? &gt;&gt; Will he deliver you if it serves his purpose? Amen. &gt;&gt; What if he don't? Well, it'll serve his purpose. &gt;&gt; See, so I'm only here to serve his purpose. &gt;&gt; All right. Then after it's finished, it's brought back in a glorified state. It's matured and brought back again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is &gt;&gt; that beautiful? So last time, and I'm watching the clock. I'm coming up near the bottom of the hour if that clock is to be believed. Amen. Amen. Let me see. Oh, it's telling the truth. What's in church? It should be telling the truth. So, we finished last time with David's deep call to the deep, asking the Lord. And that that just meant so much to me to break it down like that. I had never read it like that with such a feeling in my heart that I that I could enter into David. David's my brother. And I was I was entering in to the desire, you know, he to to his great longing because remember David had come from a horrible failure. And he can't stay away from God. Isn't that a beautiful thing about being sons and daughters of God that you fail and then you repent? &gt;&gt; See, say, "Well, I'd rather not fail." Well, I don't think that that's going to be possible until you get a body change. But I'm glad I can repent. &gt;&gt; See? Yeah. uh you know the the the reunion is so wonderful to get to come back to God and and he's asking the Lord to create in him a clean heart and he's asking the Lord to renew a right spirit in him. David is he's asking he's asking God for a response. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These aren't idol prayers. &gt;&gt; These aren't you know that's why brother Brandham said the Christian doesn't say prayers &gt;&gt; sometimes and I know what they mean. and they're innocent. And people say, "Hey, say a prayer for me." I'm like, "We we don't say prayers. I'll be happy to pray for you." Oh, yeah. You know what I mean. Yeah. I knew what you mean. Uh but but we pray prayers. We don't just say prayers. They're not rehearsed. Believe it or not, people's u 90% of their church service is is a script. And the priest will say this, that, and the other. And we're supposed to reply, "Okay, here it comes. Okay, there it is. Okay, my part is. And blessed be thou also." you know, and and the whole thing. And could you imagine that that after you'd meet me at the back door and I'd hand you a script today. Okay, now when I say this, you say that. And what happens after this? We all get to go home. Say, "Well, don't you want a response?" I do. Just say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; When I preach the word, just say, "Amen. I don't need you to read anything. Just go amen." &gt;&gt; But he's calling for a response from God. He's calling for a response from the deep that that great being. Haven't we all been there, friends, &gt;&gt; where we're anguishing and you're you're calling to God. You're you're calling to that great deep. A deep is calling a deep to respond. There is a deep to respond. And the deep here is calling for it to respond. That great fountain that fills all space and all eternity. And you know there there are there are things in life that can happen to us and and you know sometimes even just the comforting word of a friend &gt;&gt; can bring comfort. &gt;&gt; But you also are aware and sometimes we're painfully aware that sometimes I need more than just the comfort of a friend. I I'm calling there's a deep that needs more than that. I'm calling to the fountain. I'm calling to the deep. I need a response. Oh Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I need him to tell me that everything's going to be okay. Sometimes I never I need him to tell me I'm not going to lose you. Don't worry. I'm not going to lose you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know what I'm doing. Just trust me. And that's all I need. I just need a response. &gt;&gt; Joy comes in the morning. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; It's like Ruth when I mean Ruth all all Ruth had was a promise from Boaz. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But that was enough. They Boaz had made her a promise. They had made a a covenant of love to each other. You can find that uh in the book of Ruth the third chapter. I might read that here in a minute. But but but Ruth comes now you know there in fact as I thought to myself that's exactly why brother Brandham said the vow marries you because that's that's what was happening. She went there and she uncovered his feet, which was a way of asking for asking that he would take her and marry her because she was a widow and she had no inheritance and but he was a near kinsman. But there was somebody nearer than him uh that had to be dealt with first and that represented the devil who had an inside track on you. See, and and but Jesus but you belonged to Jesus. So he came forth and he challenged the devil. you know, are are you able to take care of her? Are you able to bless her? Are you able to do for her like I want to do for her? No, I can't do that. I don't even want to do that. I hate her anyway. And I don't I don't want to do it. You can go ahead and have it. And Jesus said, "I'll take it." Hallelujah. And I was so glad on that morning he took me and he took you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, Zion had been made a promise. Brother Brandham says, "Zion is always the bride." Uh, give me, brother Mark, give me Isaiah 62. We should probably read this together. Verses 1 to4. Brother Bradom shows us that Zion in the Bible, Isaiah 62:1-4, Zion in the Bible is always the bride. Watch this. For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace. &gt;&gt; And for Jerusalem's sake, see, so it's his people as well. I will not rest until the righteousness thereof go as a brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth and the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name. Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of thy Lord. What a promise friends. And a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. Thou shalt no more be termed forsaken. Neither shall thy land be termed desolate, but thou shalt be called Heepsah, and thy land Bulah, for the Lord delightth in thee, and thy land shall be married. &gt;&gt; Oh, you can have this world. Give me Jesus. You can have this world. I'll take the next one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he gives Ruth these great promises. Now daughter, I will surely do everything that you have asked. However, there's one nearer to you, and I must go deal with him at the court, &gt;&gt; and I'll go confront him, and if he won't take you, I'll take you, and I'll redeem you and Naomi, and I'll I'll redeem the whole family, and you won't any longer be called forsaken, and your whole land will be called married. &gt;&gt; Say, why am I going to be married? Yeah, I'm going to be married to the son of God. The whole land is called married. &gt;&gt; Amen. now. And he measures her out, you know, six measures of barley. She goes back and uh and and so so now but now Ruth is back home. She She's home from church now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, she was rejoicing at church. She was laying there and he said, "Now slip out. Don't let anyone know you were here and and go and and I will surely keep this promise to you." and she left. And isn't it like that sometimes we come to the house of God, we get the we feel the most wonderful love. We feel the most wonderful assurance. He loves me. I'm a believer. It's going to be okay. And then you go home. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The trial's still there. &gt;&gt; And you're just hanging on a promise. &gt;&gt; They're apart now. It's dark. She's all alone. It was at that moment that Naomi stepped near with words that that were meant for us at the end time. They were said to Ruth. But you understand this why brother Brandham in the breach would go back to this story of Ruth and Boaz. Oh, because she's a gentile and he's he's a he's a he's royalty and he's going to bring her into the family of God and he's going to bring seed through her and then that child that she has from him, she will hand to Naomi and Naomi will bounce it on her. Look, I'm here to tell you something, friends. This gospel that you and I believe is going to go right to find Benjamin. It's going to go right to find those 144,000. Oh, I'm going to be at a marriage table. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Naomi steps forward. These are words that comforted her cuz all she had was a promise. &gt;&gt; But now she's home from church. Now it's dark. Now she's alone. Now the battles of the mind. And here comes Naomi. Hear it, friends, because these are words for you. Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall. For the man will not be in rest until he hath finished the thing this day. Oh, why are we still here today? Why aren't we millennium uh decades into the millennium? Because he's finishing the thing. And after the work of redemption, watch this now. After the work of redemption, so Boaz took Ruth and she was his wife and he and this Ruth 4. and he went into unto her and the Lord gave her conception and she bore a son. It's incredible that you don't read about a wedding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You read about they're in the they're in the they're down in the threshing floor. She's back home. He's at court. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the next thing you know, Ruth is giving her a word of comfort to tie her over. And the next thing you know, he finishes and seals the deal. And then he takes her and the next thing you know, she's got a child. and the next thing you know she's his wife and there's no wedding at all because it's a portrait of the end time. We are we are married but it's an invisible union and the world doesn't see it but heaven sees it because the Bible says the bride has made herself ready. The marriage of the lamb has come &gt;&gt; and this is where we are friends right there. Revelation 19. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him. For the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready, and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints. None of this wedding detail is mentioned in Ruth. It's all invisible. Doesn't even talk about it. And to her, and and he sth unto me, write, blessed are they which are called under the marriage supper of the Lamb. See, we're not going to the marriage supper to get married. We're married right here, right now. We're invisibly united, and we're taken to a wedding supper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed are they which are called under the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, these are the true sayings of God. And I, watch this now. And I fell at his feet to worship him. This is his tour guide. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's trying. It's like the third time he's tried to worship him and he keeps stopping him. He says, "No, no, no, no. Don't worship me. I'm just thy fellow servant. I'm one of the prophets. Worship God." Cuz any true prophet will redirect worship back to the one who deserves it. &gt;&gt; No true prophet will accept worship. He won't he won't he won't accept money, women, or popularity. He won't go for those st. He don't He won't He won't try to build universities and schools and colleges and the letters of 4 million and a hand never touches it. He's not worried about that thing. He's worried about getting the bride. He he's worried about sewing the seed of the word. &gt;&gt; So he says, so you can see we're at the end time now. These are the true sayings. I fell at his feet to worship him. He said unto me, see thou do it not. I am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony. Catch it now. That have the testimony of Jesus Christ. Worship God. &gt;&gt; You say, "Man, he's got the testimony of Jesus Christ." What a privileged man was the prophet of this hour. But hold on, wait, there's more. For the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy. So you are this prophecy fulfilled. That is the testimony of Jesus Christ. You're the living word of God, the ministry of the son of man, the word made flesh. Again, you are the modern event made clear in prophecy. the testimony of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; See the Lord as I as I just turned the last corner head for home. The Lord responded to David and he granted his request. Solomon had the same deep deep calling to the deep. &gt;&gt; And the Lord responded to him. And he I will say to you today that he will always respond to an honest humble heart. For the Bible says he loves a contrite spirit. You just recognize that the Lord that we preach today is a we we you say, "What version of the gospel do you preach today?" We we preach the version that's the truth. That the Lord is holiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That the Lord is righteousness. &gt;&gt; That the Lord is equity and fairness. He's the embodiment of it. He is he is he is not only indelibly holy, but he's empirically holy. It's provable. You can go back through history and you have empirical evidence. This is what he did. That's why brother Brandham said if you get in a spot, go back to where somebody had a similar thing and whatever they did to God to get them out, you do the same thing and him being Jesus Christ the same, he'll do the same for you and you'll have the same kind of victory. &gt;&gt; I I am empirical proof that he lives. He called me out of a world of sin and changed my whole nature. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; he's pure. He's honest. See the when you go back and you look at the original law, the law that God gave to Israel, it was written in stone. But stone couldn't bring forth life. Stone couldn't praise him. Stone couldn't worship him. stone could never give him the glory that he so deserved, so richly deserved. And so, 1600 years after the law, we found a new kind of heart beating in a manger of hay. You remember last time I told you the fact that he could be killed and went in the grave proved he was a man. But the fact that he that that body could raise itself back up under its own power proved he was more than a man. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; so this coming promise that we see, we we read it last time. We looked at Ezekiel's promise. We looked at David's promise. We looked at Isaiah's promise. All these very various promises. uh be- because he died because he lived and died and rose and lives today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because because he lives, then I'm receiving a new kind of spirit. I don't want my own spirit. I want his spirit. &gt;&gt; I'm receiving the living spirit of the living God to live behind living skin. And that's what makes me a prophecy fulfilled at the end time because it's how do you know it's a prophecy of God? Cuz I couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; I couldn't produce it. But yet it's being produced and I had no way to make it happen. And all the king's horses and all the king's men could never have put me back together. &gt;&gt; But there was another power. I've got another spirit. I'm here to tell you. Yeah. I've got a I'm still born in a body. Even catch this now. Even though my body is engineered, engineers are impressive people. Even though my body, your body was engineered by God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But because that it's born in sin and you have memory, conscience, affection, imagination, all these different problems in your body, then you have so many points of failure &gt;&gt; along the chain. There's engineers know that when they design something, they try to eliminate they they try to identify the weak points where there could be a failure here. We need to redesign that and eliminate. I'm here to tell you something, friend. Yeah, I was born uh I I was born by by the promise of God. I my body was engineered. But the problem is I'm in fallen flesh and I've got problems in memories and reasonings and affections and imaginations and memories and all these things. And those things can really cause you trouble. But I'm glad to know that because he lives, I can live. And I got a spirit in me that though I'm broken and though I've got weak points, I got somebody who can do something about it &gt;&gt; because I couldn't do anything about it, but I know someone who can. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; So this is why David could say, the psalmist could say, I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Marvelous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well. My soul knoweth it, but boy, my conscience and memory have a hard time believing I'm wonderfully made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't always feel so wonderfully made. &gt;&gt; But I know this. I gave my whole heart to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I still got problems. &gt;&gt; Come on. We still got problems, &gt;&gt; but you're in contact with somebody who can do something about it, friends. &gt;&gt; I love that. &gt;&gt; See, so so that's what happened there at that church. They they entered in literally entered into the fellowship of the mystery. And you know, we were we were showing you last time they just because they entered into the mystery, the world didn't know who they were, &gt;&gt; right? Jesus was a mystery revealed but yet still a mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and you say, "Yeah, what's because he blinded him." Well, hold on. Yeah. If you're talking about his elected Israel, yeah, he did blind him on purpose. Otherwise, Brother Random said, "Those real true Hebrews would have known him." See, they would have recognized him, but he blinded them for your sake &gt;&gt; so that he could get you. And that's why Paul says, "Don't rejoice against the against the the the the one that the vine that got planted. You're just a wild you're you're a wild plant. You got grafted into this thing. Don't rejoice against Israel because of their hour of blindness. For all Israel shall be saved." &gt;&gt; See, God's got this. Oh my goodness. What a plan. What a plan. Let them do what they want to do. They can have this meeting and this conference and this at the White House or at the Kremlin or at the Vatican. They can do whatever they want. Go on down. Uh car carry right on. Listen to the pipe piper. Go down the primrose path. Carry on. But I'm ascending. I'm going up. I'm not going over a cliff. I am a I am an unfolding mystery. I don't know what say what's it all going to mean. I don't even know what my day holds tomorrow. But I know this. He's holding. &gt;&gt; He's the one who called me. He's the one who redeems me. &gt;&gt; But the world is not not keen to see that. And and as far as the other ones, they close their own eyes. According to the prophet, even Jesus said, their eyes they have closed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lest they they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and and be converted and I should heal them. See, so once you close your eyes, he has no further obligation. Now, thank God, his love and mercy, I mean, if he was gracious to Paul for all those years, I'm glad he was gracious to me. I'm glad he didn't take my first no. He just kept coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm telling you something, friends. He's a He's a wonderful God. He's worthy worthy of all of our service. God bless you today. That's as far as we'll go. I don't know if there'll be a part 11. I've got more material, but let's stand to our feet. Amen. I just feel like that's enough for today. Praise the Lord. Your your appetite should be your hunger should be assuaged at this point until Wednesday. Amen. Praise the Lord. By then you come in here famished. I need some more food. Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother, I'm going to have you do it, buddy. Where you at? Where you at, big dog? I want you to do that song for me again. Almost home. &gt;&gt; Are you glad to be almost home? &gt;&gt; Hey, do we have words to that, brother Mark? If we don't type fast, brother. Amen. We probably know it anyway. Amen. Brother Kenny, you can help him sing it and you can get the congregation going. Amen. Praise the Lord. I love this song. Almost home, brothers. It won't be long. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Soon we'll be leaving. You love him. I love him with all my heart. Thank you for your kind and patient attention today. I think we went as far as we could. I think we went far enough. I think you really have grasped, you know, the the whole essence of of these two different series. Both of them were like, I don't know, 8 n 10 parts long each. And I dealt with all the past and showed us in prophecy where he the word had come to pass. And then I thought, you know, okay, we're not here to just be news reporters. Let's let's look forward. Let's see what's happening. Let's see what's going to come. You remember we read that um statement was it last time and I think the time before that Russian specialist he was himself uh one of the I think he was Ukrainian maybe or was he Bella Bellar Russian I can't remember and yeah I think he was but anyway he was saying how that this 80 years that we've had since the world war he said no that's a that's an anomaly it should have never went that long and he's talking about how that we we are now again at 1937. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, and it and and it was wasn't until I think uh 38 or 39 that they invaded Poland and and then because of the treaties, you know, then France has to say, "Okay, we're going to defend." And then they declare war on France, then England declares war on them, and then the next thing you know, then Italy's declaring, the US is sitting back till they get attacked. And then Japan's declaring war on us, we're declaring war on Germany and Japan. And I mean, the whole thing, you can't stop it. They think they're in control. They think all of their conferences and their UN's and their meetings and their summits are going to stop it. You can't stop the third woe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's coming. And once the bride leaves, the Bible says, "Behold, the third woe cometh quickly." See? Amen. But we're almost home. Amen. Let's try to sing along. Amen. Go ahead, my brother. Help us, brother Kenny. &gt;&gt; Are you disappointed? &gt;&gt; Are you desperate for help? [Music] You know what it's like to be tired and only a shell of yourself. Wow. Ain't that so true? &gt;&gt; You start to believe. &gt;&gt; Listen to these words now. &gt;&gt; You don't have what it takes. Oh my. How many times has he told us that? &gt;&gt; Cuz it's all you can do just to move, much less finish race. Can we be honest today? &gt;&gt; But don't forget, &gt;&gt; don't forget what lies upon. [Applause] Hallelujah. It won't be long. Soon your presence will be your God with all your strength. Sister of your hand. Keep keep pressing. Keep pressing. &gt;&gt; Beth tabernacle. Keep pressing. We're almost home. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh my. This road will be hard. You win in the end. Simply because of Jesus in us. It's not if. Oh my. Not if I take joy in the journey. Hallelujah. Then when it feels long. Oh, find strength in each step. Know in heaven. Christ cheering you on. They're cheering you on. Can you hear us? We are home.

I know that the cross has brought heaven to us, right? But make no mistakes, there's still more to come when our flesh and our no longer between where we are right now. Where we're meant to be. We always been lost whole again. These tears in this pain no longer resist the walking as fast as we can. This our second way almost home brother [Music] [Applause] will be our dream Run free. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] We are [Music] We are almost [Music] hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. We're almost home, friends. Let's bow our heads. Amen. Brother Kenny, you can take a song of your choosing. Bow your heads with me over the audience. Lord, what a grand day it's been to be in your presence. What a grand word that you've given us today. You fed your children well, Lord. We're grateful. Now, Father, take us under your care. Take us as we go out throughout the day, Lord. There's some, Lord, that we are in prayer for, we know are out of town and different ones and ministers from our team ministering away. Lord, I'm praying for your great grace upon all of our lives that you would be to us that sustaining portion that we need. Lord, we love you for the truth that's in your word today. And it gives us confidence to know that we can go forward and that you will be our stay. Commit our lives into your hands. Amen. Friends, I want to read to you real quick. I forgot to read it at the beginning. I got it from Sister Meredith. Amen. And I hope it'll come up here. Amen. It will in just in a minute. Wait for it to refresh. Oh, here we go. Um, Brother Jason, I have a testimony and prayer request. Kevin Renfro that we requested prayer for on Wednesday for his open heart surgery is doing well and recovering in the hospital. Thank you all for praying and continue to remember him as he recovers. Will you do it? And don't forget the uh lady that Sister Debbie and I prayed for, Tara. Her name is Tara. Be praying the Holy Spirit will heal her and reveal himself to her. She says, "Sister Meredith says, "I'm also asking the church to pray for my brother Michael. It has been about 2 months now since his heart valve replacement surgery. He's doing good, but has been discouraged that he's not making much progress as he feels he should. He has an appointment with his cardiologist on Thursday, which I think they are going to check to see if his heart function has improved. I'm asking that the church pray that the cardiologist tells him that he's making very good progress and that they see an improvement in his heart function. He really needs to hear a good report from them. Will you be remembering that today just before we leave the building under praise and worship? Will you remember that? Thank God for what he's done for uh Kevin Renfro and we're asking for her brother Michael. Amen. And all the different ones. What you gonna sing, Brother Kenny? &gt;&gt; I want to be ready.

When I hear him call my name, Lord, I want to be ready. God bless your saint. You can be dismissed. I I want to be ready to go. Lord, I want to be ready. Lord, I I want to be ready to go. Where can I be? [Music] Sure, when it all when it all will take place. [Music] But when it does, it does not matter if I'm walking in his grave. Lord, I'm going to be ready.
