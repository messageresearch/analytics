How many's happy to be in church? &gt;&gt; I'm always happy to be in church. &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles, let's just go right into the word. Let's turn to Deuteronomy chapter 30 and verse 15. I don't claim to be a a deep preacher. I just here to do my part. &gt;&gt; So if you we get done with this, you're like, "Man, that wasn't very deep." Blame him. It's his fault. Deuteronomy 30:15, it says, "See, I have set before thee this day life and good and death and evil. In that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his commandments, his statutes, his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply, and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land, whether thou goest to possess it. But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them, I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whether thou passest over Jordan, to go to possess it. I call heaven and earth, to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing. Therefore, choose life that both thou and thy seed may live. May God add a blessed to read. You have your seats. For a title, I want to speak on the results of a decision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Results of a decision. I couldn't quite reach that, so I had him take care of it for me. Thank you, buddy. You know, life is made up of a lot of a lot of decisions. Every day, every choice we make, it has a consequence. &gt;&gt; I'm go ahead and admit to you, I made a lot of stupid mistakes. &gt;&gt; That I pay for. &gt;&gt; Decision that you will you will you will make will determine the harvest that you'll reap. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever you sow, we're going to reap it. &gt;&gt; We have all been forced to make decisions. There's times where we all have to say yes or no. &gt;&gt; I'm one of those kind of people that I don't like to tell people no when they ask me to do stuff, but sometimes you have to say no. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm learning that where they people will wear you out. There's a time where we cannot be neutral. We can't be neutral no more. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't believe that we'll be able to leave this church tonight in the same condition &gt;&gt; you did when you came in. &gt;&gt; You ought to have come into church this evening. You like, man, we're having church. Brother Tony's leading the singing. And then I come out. Oh man, I just ruined your service. I'm sorry. You'll either leave better or worse. I want to leave better. Right? &gt;&gt; It don't matter where I'm s if I'm up here or back there. I want to leave better tonight. &gt;&gt; If the Holy Spirit shall come and do his work among us, &gt;&gt; thank the Lord. Then we are forced to say yes or no to him. &gt;&gt; We cannot remain the same. So you have a choice tonight. &gt;&gt; We all have choices. &gt;&gt; We choose what we want to eat. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we choose the wrong thing to eat &gt;&gt; and we pay for it. You choose what you want to wear to church tonight. You walk to your closet, open your closet door. &gt;&gt; I want to wear that tonight. Of course, I pull out what I wear and I show it to my wife. How's this? That'll work. &gt;&gt; But you we chose. You chose to came to church. Thank God you did. Shame on you that don't. &gt;&gt; You choose what you want to wear. You went to your closet. You chose it. You could choose whether you want to go to work tomorrow or not. Amen. &gt;&gt; You could choose whether or not you want to help us out at our camp. &gt;&gt; You That's a decision you have to live with. &gt;&gt; That was free. &gt;&gt; You sisters can choose to clean your house tomorrow or do your laundry. You have a choice. You get There's all kinds of choices that we have to make. You can choose where you want to go on vacation. There's all kinds of choices that you can make. There's decisions that we must make. good choices in our life. Like I said a few minutes ago, we have made a lot of bad choices. How many's with me? &gt;&gt; We got angels still here with us. &gt;&gt; You have a right to choose. Joshua says, "Therefore, fear the Lord &gt;&gt; and serve him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve you the Lord." And if it seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord, Joshua was demanding a decision. &gt;&gt; I need a decision. They had saw God's miracles, but some of the people still wavered. He said, &gt;&gt; "Choose you this day &gt;&gt; whom you're going to serve, whether the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, whose land you do well. But as for me in my house, &gt;&gt; we will serve the Lord." &gt;&gt; That's what brother B says. We're living in a day where there's much makebelieve. &gt;&gt; Right and wrong is trying to join themselves together. &gt;&gt; People trying to join the right and wrong together. It can never be done. One is the devil and the other one is God. The devil's wrong. God is right. &gt;&gt; It'll always be that way. The devil will lose and God will always win. &gt;&gt; So if you're on the wrong side, you're sure to lose. If you're on the right side, you're on God's side. You're sure to win because you can't lose. There's no way for us to lose. We're on the winning side. &gt;&gt; People says, "God's on my side." &gt;&gt; No, I'm on his side. &gt;&gt; I'm on his side. Was at one time we couldn't get to God. He was way up there. We couldn't get to him. But what he did, he came down and bridged the gap between earth and eternity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now when before we couldn't get to God, God came down in flesh and became one of us. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD HE DID. WALKED THIS EARTH, DIED A sinner for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did he for you? &gt;&gt; Man is now standing on the same side of God. If you are a gene seed of God, &gt;&gt; we are standing on his side. And they ain't no devil can take that from me. There ain't no devil can get in my way. SO WATCH OUT DEVIL. HERE WE COME. &gt;&gt; He's already lost. &gt;&gt; We have conquered every sickness, every disease, every devil. &gt;&gt; If you're on God's side, &gt;&gt; says, "So it'll be all right because we want to take sides with Jesus. And the only way you'll take sides with Jesus is taking sides on what he said. &gt;&gt; Believe his word. &gt;&gt; So, let's just take sides with him. &gt;&gt; What happened to the thief on the cross? &gt;&gt; He deserved to die. &gt;&gt; He was just hanging there. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, he looks over at Jesus with another thief making fun of him and says, "This man's done nothing. We deserve to die. remember me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Just in an instant, &gt;&gt; he chose it. Changed his destination. &gt;&gt; That's what our choices do tonight. They change our destination. &gt;&gt; We're given a choice, brother. I said, "Choice is a great thing. Your eternal destination is a choice. There'll be one time that if you turn God down many times, there'll be one last time you'll turn him down. There's a line between mercy and judgment. And it's a dangerous thing for a man or a woman, boy or girl, to step across that line for there's no return. When you step across that deadline, he called it. So tonight, it might be the time that many will make their decision where they will spend eternity. It's a dangerous thing to wait until the last hour &gt;&gt; because you might you might take on something you can never shake out of it. There's a time when you can be warned. Then if you step across that line of warning, then you're already marked on the other side. He calls it branded. &gt;&gt; Brother Matt robing off on me. I forgot to start my timer. But there is a choice we have to make. right or wrong to serve God or the devil. You can't choose both. &gt;&gt; You'll be like the children of Israel. Remember during Ahab's time where they halted between two opinions. You got to choose one side or the other. &gt;&gt; How many times we've come across he's come across this pull pit. You didn't have a choice to begin with. You're like, "Wait a minute. I have a choice." But you're saying I didn't. Your choice is based on one thing. You just got to recognize it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knew what your choice would be. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; Cuz God had chose you before the foundation of the world. So God had a choice. He chose you. &gt;&gt; That's all we got to do is recognize it. He chose his way because he chose us. That's why we chose his way because he chose us. That's the way the only decision we can make is because he chose you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That decision was already made. He knew what choice you would make before he even created this world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not one thing you could do about it, Brother Gideon. &gt;&gt; You didn't tell your dad you want to be born in that family, did you? You were just there. You had to be. &gt;&gt; I didn't have you to have a choice. That's the same way in the kingdom of God. You have a choice but you don't have a choice. &gt;&gt; Like what says think seriously because we will never be able to think anymore after this after this mortal life is over. &gt;&gt; Your thinking is now. You cannot choose after this. &gt;&gt; You must choose now. For this day of choosing make your choice. &gt;&gt; This is choosing time. You can't stand neutral any longer. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may leave before this message is over, but you can you can't go out that door the same person you come in. &gt;&gt; You'll cross that threshold tonight. Either a better person or a more evil person. Help us, Lord. You can't help it. It's up to you to make a decision. It's a choosing time. You know, people are always picking sides. &gt;&gt; You know, in sports, you always pick your favorite team. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm a I'm a fan of that team. But what we got, they got they call them bandwagon fans. You know what they bandwagon fans are? A team is winning, they're winning everything. A lot of people starts going for that team. They're called bandwagon fans. But when that team starts losing, they jump to the next team. &gt;&gt; It used to be the New England Patriots. Now it's the Kansas City Chiefs. So they just jump back and forth. They don't know what they're doing. &gt;&gt; Sounds like church. Sounds like we got a bunch of bandwagon Christians only around when time is good. When things are going well for you, there's no trials and tribulations. You're on the winning team. I don't know how these people who's not in Christians, how they even live, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Who they pray to when somebody gets sick or they need something, who they pray to? some co some some football coach, some football team, some Instagram, &gt;&gt; some phone who they pray to. &gt;&gt; They ain't none of these pe none of these people can meet your needs like our God can. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Bandwagon Christians. &gt;&gt; I'm not a bandwagon Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was chosen to this. &gt;&gt; That's right. I was chosen to this before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; There's always been two sides. &gt;&gt; Well, we just heard a little bit over the weekend. Lucifer in heaven says, "I'm going to be like God." So, he chose a side. He went to the north and says, "And took some of the angels with him." &gt;&gt; But what happened to what's what happened to him? His judgment was spoken. You will be cast down into hell. &gt;&gt; So, if you're on the devil's side, that's our end. Hell, hell's our end. But if you're on God's side, he has called you and ordained you for his own. Eternity has been given to you. That's what happens when you're on the right side. Every choice will lead to a result. And that result will tell you what what your heart's like. Adam and Eve had a choice. I know it's simple, but it's okay. The serpent begaled Eve and said, "Surely you won't die." But said, "It just depends on what you want to do. You're a free moral agent. You act on whatever your desire &gt;&gt; is to act upon." &gt;&gt; God has put before man. Just like in the Garden of Eden, the tree of life or the tree of death, you make your choice. I love this statement. Whatever your soul is charmed for, that's what you'll eat. &gt;&gt; So, what are you charmed for tonight? I looked at that word charmed. I said, "What does that word really mean? Charmed." It means charmed is being under a magic spell. Are you under the spell of the world, the devil? Are you Are you is that your charm? Is that what gets you going in the morning? I can't wait to get up and put my headphones on. Nobody knows what I'm listening to. Somebody knows. Are you under the spell of God? Do you find yourself feeding on God's word? You find yourselves getting under a spell once you read what God has done for you. You start getting all excited. You know what choice Adam and Eve chose? You know what their result was? Sin on the earth. God has made God has so made a way that man is placed into position where he's forced you to make a decision. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You can't just say, "I'm just going to sit here. I ain't going to make yes or no." God's going to force it. &gt;&gt; God's going to force a decision on you. God will force the issue to you. He must make some decision. And there's a time when you have to make a decision on school. You have to make a decision on who you'll marry. You have to make a decision on different things. Then he starts talking about Cain and Abel. The decision was forced upon man to make a decision. We know the story of Cain and Abel. What happened? Cain brought all his pretty little flowers to the altar. That's what he thought it was. It was beautiful. No doubt. He laid it up there and he thought this is what God wanted. But here come Abel. Abel dragging something to the altar. That old lamb crying and bleeding and hollering out and him dragging up there and picking up a throne on elder and grabbing a rock and beating his neck and blood squirting out everywhere. Nasty blood everywhere. Blood all over the altar. Blood all over Abel. But God loved his offering. He made the right choice. What did God do? The result of the right decision, a fire come down and consumed his sacrifice. Thank the Lord. His offering was accepted by God. The God sent fire out of heaven and consumed his sacrifice. And that's what happens today. If you're on God's side, that's what God wants you today. If you repent of being baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost, God wants to come down and just consume you. Moses had a choice. He had it all. He had the kingdom. He was going to be the next Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; But he did a lot of things that a lot of preachers couldn't do. Give up that money and popularity. But he did it. He had a choice. He could have stayed. Moses by choice. He was met by a pillar of fire. Jonah found himself in a well by decision that he made. I'm not going over there. I'm going to go this way. Oh, no you're not. Is his decision. Daniel, because he wasn't afraid to pray, God shut the mouth of the lions. What a decision. The Hebrew children had a choice. Were they going to bow or get thrown into the fire? What would you have done? &gt;&gt; What would you done if you was with Daniel with the Hebrew children that day? You're going to bow. I'm going to throw you this fire. What would you have done? What do you do today? &gt;&gt; What you do today is what you would have done back then. &gt;&gt; They made a stand. You can see through all through the Bible these people had choices. It come down to a showdown whether they're going to serve God or not. You can see the end. If we choose the disciples sides following God, we see what happens. We see what happens if we choose the side like Pharaoh, like the Pharisees did. We see how they ended up lost forever. What we do today is what we would have done back then. Bren says, "Identify yourself with a Bible character that you believe in. Were you believe the word was vindicated? What would you done in the days of Noah? Would you have picked up the hammer? What do you want me to hammer at Noah? Or would you been with the people laughing at him? Mercy, I'll hurry. You know, brother had a decision one time. Remember that story he talked about his daughter dying and the devil come and talking to him. He said that was the hardest, most treacherous time of my life when I raised up and looked at her. Satan was trying to tell him, "God don't love you. All the message you've preached, all this what you've done for him, he's going to let your daughter die." Reb says, "When I raised up and looked at her and I thought Satan had put it in my mind, &gt;&gt; now when he comes your own baby, he'll turn you down." And I said, "That's right. &gt;&gt; If he can't save my baby, then I can't." &gt;&gt; And he says, I stopped. Thank the Lord he did. I just didn't know what to do. And then I said this, "Lord, you gave her to me. You take her away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Even if you take me, I'll still love you. &gt;&gt; Result of a decision. &gt;&gt; Israel one time came to a showdown. A result of a decision who was given a choice of what God they were going to serve. Ahab. Ahab was an evil man. &gt;&gt; What happened to him? He just made a wrong choice in life. &gt;&gt; He made a wrong choice in life. He went against the teaching of God's word and married an unbeliever. &gt;&gt; Hardly ever see it work out. &gt;&gt; I'll stop there. Ahab. So he ended up marrying Jezebel. She was taught, she was raised growing up to hate God. Jehovah, everything he stood for. The way you're taught as a child is what you'll be when you're an adult. &gt;&gt; We know Jezebel, we know her in she fed to the dogs. &gt;&gt; The Bible says she was scattered out everywhere. No, not even recognizable. That was a result of her decision. &gt;&gt; Ba worship. That's who she worshiped. Her own father was named after him. Lbel was his name. He was named after his God. Thank God I'm named after my God tonight. I'm Mrs. Jesus Christ. That's who I serve. That's my choice. &gt;&gt; If you're a child of God, you'll have his name. &gt;&gt; When things couldn't possibly get any worse, &gt;&gt; God got fed up with it. &gt;&gt; He got fed up with He sent a man out of the wilderness. First time we ever heard of Elijah. He walks up to the up to the king Ahab says, "There'll be no rain or doodle." I call for it. Turn around. Walks back out. We need more preachers like that. &gt;&gt; Preachers that get up here with it's got a backbone. It's not wishy-washy. They ain't afraid to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Lord, let it be me. &gt;&gt; He just showed up on the scene with a warning from God. There'll be no rain or doodle. I call for it. It was right at him. Cuz Bale was a god of the weather. Oh, it'd be all right. We don't believe this. One year, two year, three year, no rain. &gt;&gt; They finally got they finally realized something happened. God got so tired of their sins, he said, "Okay. Okay, Elijah, it's time. They've got to make a decision." &gt;&gt; So, I want you to go back to Ahab and you be call showdown. First Kings 18:17. That's what he said. When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said, "Art thou he that troubleth Israel?" He said, "I haven't troubled Israel, but thou in thy father's house has, &gt;&gt; cuz you have forsaken the commandments of God, and follow Baal." &gt;&gt; Now therefore, send and gather to me all of Israel unto Mount Carmel. Get all the prophets of Baal, all 450 of them, and all the prophets of the grove, all 400 which eat at Jezebel's table. So Elijah told A had sent for all the people and bring them all up here. It's time. &gt;&gt; And Elijah came unto THE PEOPLE. HOW LONG HALT YE BETWEEN two opinions? &gt;&gt; Halt &gt;&gt; to hop about to limp. &gt;&gt; Don't know where they're going. &gt;&gt; Don't know what they're going to become lame and leap. And what are we going to do? And we don't know if that the message is right or the message is wrong. Was brother Brown a false prophet? Was he true? Should we listen to tapes or should we have preachers? Halt. Halt between two opinions. &gt;&gt; They couldn't make up their minds who they're going to serve. They serve Bale when it's convenient. Serve God when it's convenient. &gt;&gt; That's what we do sometimes. If things go wrong, we That's when we get ON OUR KNEES. OH, GOD HELP ME, LORD. WOW. There's too many fence sitters in Christianity. So Elijah came and said, "You cannot falter between two opinions anymore. You're double-minded. &gt;&gt; You're either going to serve one or you going to serve the other." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, Baal was a god of thunder. He was also the god of fertility. So Elijah says to these people, "Look, we've had a drought here for three and a half years. If Bale is God, why haven't you had any rain?" &gt;&gt; He's already started making fun of him. He ain't started yet. &gt;&gt; How long is it going to take you to see this that this is a judgment by Jehovah upon the land? Look, make a decision. It's either one or the other. &gt;&gt; There's only two choices. &gt;&gt; The devil is fighting you as hard as he can. &gt;&gt; It ain't only old people. &gt;&gt; We fight the devil. It's these young people. &gt;&gt; They're getting blasted from every side. &gt;&gt; It's tougher on them. It was when we were young, brother Steve. &gt;&gt; It's so easy right here. You know what I mean? Elijah said to the people, "I even I only remain a prophet of the Lord." But Baal's prophets are 450 men. Let them therefore give us two bulocks and let them choose one bullet for themselves and cut it into pieces and lay it on wood and put no fire under it. &gt;&gt; And I would do the same. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I like the way why he said why did he say that? Put no fire under the altar. I I I was trying to find it this afternoon. I could I read it somewhere that the prophet the pro the priests of Baal would get under the altar and they would light the fire under the altar. So Elijah says, "Uh-uh, no, you're not going under there. No fire for you." He says, "And call ye upon the name of your gods. Go ahead and call on your two so God. Go ahead and call on your three gods. Go ahead and call and I will call on the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the God that'll answer by fire, let him be God. &gt;&gt; And the people answered and said, "It's well spoken." And Elijah said to the prophets of Bale again, "Choose you one bak for yourself and dress it first, for ye are many, and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under it." Prophel thought this this is going to be easy. This is going to be good. This is going to be a sure thing. That's what they thought about people leave this message. This is a sure thing. There's gonna be a mass exodus. &gt;&gt; Were they? I don't recall seeing a mass exodus. &gt;&gt; Did you, brother Jason? Just one or two, three here, &gt;&gt; four there. &gt;&gt; Wasn't like not like they thought. &gt;&gt; And they took the bullet that was given them, addressed it, and called on the name of Bell from morning until noon. &gt;&gt; OH, BALE, HEAR US. There was no voice. And they leaped up on the altar. &gt;&gt; When was the last time you leaped on the altar? Praising the Lord. &gt;&gt; They they put most of us ashamed. &gt;&gt; They worship a God's not real. We worship a God. It's real. We just hear it like this. &gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. 805. How much long is he going to preach? &gt;&gt; Oops. And they cried aloud and cut themselves with knives &gt;&gt; till the BLOOD GUSHED OUT. &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD. MAYBE HE'S SLEEPING. HE MIGHT BE DOWN THERE IN DISNEY WORLD SOMEWHERE. HE MIGHT BE AT THE BEACH. You know, I can I can see the devil. He's probably down in hell having a good time. He probably had him a big large Little Caesar's pizza and a Dr. Pepper. He'd probably sitting there enjoying himself. I had that for lunch today. Sorry. He They were having a good old time. He knows this message was right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He know who Elijah was. He knew who God was. &gt;&gt; The devils believed this message and they tremble. &gt;&gt; He's just watching people leave. that they if they don't get their lives straight with God, they're lost going to hell. He just let laughing as the people's leaving the message. Oh, we're all free. They say, "We can cut our hair. We can put on our pants. We can put on our shorts. We can let our hair grow out, guys. &gt;&gt; They're free." Devil's laughing. And Elijah said unto the people, "Okay, I've had enough of this. Come near to me. Come near to me." And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down. He said, "I've got to repair this. I got to repair this word. I've got to take this take us back to the faith of our fathers." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Elijah picked up one stone. Faith is a substance. He picks up another stone, the hidden life with Christ. He picks up another glory. My redeemer liveth. He started building the altar back. He got down to the church ages. He got down to the seven seals. He got down. What house will you build me? He got down to the rapture &gt;&gt; and he built the altar. &gt;&gt; Now it's time to turn our hearts to back to the father. &gt;&gt; We need to make a right choice tonight. We need to start rebuilding our altar. We need to start rebuilding our altar back at home. &gt;&gt; Brother was said to turn our hearts back to the father. What would you have done that day? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What side would you have chosen? And Elijah took the 12 stones according to the number of tribes of the sons of Jacob unto the whom the word of the Lord came and said, Israel shall be thy name. And around those stones he built a trench. Amen. &gt;&gt; About the altar and he put wood on the altar. He cut the bulk in pieces and laid laid it on the wood. Filled four barrels with water. &gt;&gt; Poured it on the burnt sacrifice &gt;&gt; and the wood. Go do it again. Here they come a second time. Say, "Go do it again." Here they come a third time. 12 barrels of water. &gt;&gt; Wow. Filled the ditch. He wanted to show that there was no fire under that altar. If there's fire in his that water would have put it out. When fire did fall, it was going to be supernatural. &gt;&gt; And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice. Who knows? It could have been a Wednesday night. Amen. &gt;&gt; At 7:00, at the time of the evening of sacrifice, Elijah the prophet came near and said, "Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel." He didn't say Jacob. Jacob had a name change. of Israel. Let it be known this day THAT THOU ART GOD in Israel, that I am thy servant, that I have done all these things at thy word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What took the pro the prophets of Ba all day to try to get the fire to fall, but it wasn't for them. They weren't ordained for this Holy Ghost fire. All they could do is just feel it. They having all kinds of emotions, jumping around, screaming, &gt;&gt; speaking in their tongues, &gt;&gt; they had a feeling, but no fire. Hear me, oh Lord. Hear me. that these people may know that thou art Lord God and thou hast turned our heart back again. I can imagine him just praying this. He wasn't screaming it. Lord, we're just going to we're just going to show the people right now. He said, "Thou has turned our heart back." back and said, "No sooner than he ended that prayer, there was a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind and the fire fell and consumed that sacrifice." What was amazing, not only the sacrifice, it consumed the altar, the wood, the water. It was dry ground when they got done with it. The the fire of the Lord fell consumed the burnt sacrifice. It ate it up. It consumed it. It burned it up. It devoured it. Lord, I want the Holy Ghost to come and DEVOUR ME TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; EAT ALL OF ME, LORD. &gt;&gt; That sacrifice was consumed. That's the way our life was or is. We need to be so consumed by the fire of the Holy Ghost that there's no more me. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank the Lord. We're totally gone. Totally filled up with the God's power. Our lives are so in tune with God till the devil don't even know what to do with you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's a choice I want to make. &gt;&gt; And when the people saw it, they fell on their face. They said, "Hold on a minute. We've seen this before or heard it done before." &gt;&gt; Remember in Leviticus, we got time to go there. They fell on their faces and THEY SAID, "THE LORD GOD, HE IS GOD. &gt;&gt; THE LORD, HE IS the God." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; What's going to happen one day when the rapture takes place? &gt;&gt; The people been playing church &gt;&gt; is going to come in here and where's everybody at? &gt;&gt; What happened? It's Sunday 11:10. Tony's should be starting to lead the singing. Where's he at? Where's everybody at? Realize you've missed it. That's when you'll BE SCREAMING OUT. OH LORD, THIS MESSAGE WAS RIGHT. THE LORD, HE IS GOD. &gt;&gt; LORD, I say, Lord, let the fire fall on us tonight. &gt;&gt; Let it consume our very beings. That same pillar of fire at the beginning, the same pillar of of cloud in that burning bush, the same pillar of fire that led to Israel 40 years, the same one that fell on the day of Pentecost that filled 120 of them is the same one that's here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've been in meetings where the pillar of fire was seen. &gt;&gt; W people witnessed it. &gt;&gt; I've never seen them, but I sure have felt a thing. &gt;&gt; You talk about a reverence, a power. You could feel the power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's coming a showdown. &gt;&gt; We're gonna take a rapture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; While the defectors of the message and the denominations can't find you no more. We're going to be up there cuz we're already married. We're going to go up to the wedding supper of the lamb. Three and a half years. him coming through our wiping the tears from our eyes. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; You've made it. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE YOU'VE made it. Your choice. &gt;&gt; You've got it. YOU'VE MADE YOUR ETERNAL DESTINATION RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; WHY? Your decision that you have made. Hallelujah. I'm gonna stop right there. Let's all stand. Let's bow our heads. Musicians Tony come. Now, I think I said this before about straddling the fence where this man was straddling the fence and The angel kept trying to get him to come over on their side, on God's side. And the devil wasn't saying nothing. And God was saying, "Come on. Come on my side. Get get over here. Get off that fence." The devil wasn't saying nothing. He finally asked the devil, says, "Why aren't you trying to get me on your side?" The devil says, "The fence belongs to me. &gt;&gt; The fence is mine." &gt;&gt; So straddling a fence is not a neutral position. and you're sitting on the devil's property. Jesus says, "He that's not with me is against me." To get on the right side, please have eyes closed. To get on the right side, we've got to have that fire of the Holy Ghost on your soul. A fire that'll keep you from stay help you stay away from the world. But we got to choose tonight. Is it God or is it rock and roll? &gt;&gt; Is it God or some country love song? Is it God or world's fashion? Is it God or your video games? Is it God or your television? [Music] Is it God or your sports? Is it God or your sickness? Is it God or your defeat or the victory? You got to choose. It's either God or Satan. We all have a choice. You say, "But I have the Holy Ghost." Yeah. What are you doing with it? &gt;&gt; Do you get up in the morning and go for your cup of coffee and you don't pick up your Bible? A lot of our prayer time is just when we lay down at night and go to sleep. Lord, forgive me my sins. Lord, be with me tomorrow. Amen. That's all we got to give God. [Music] This is for every person. Myself included. I have my hand raised tonight. Lord, forgive me. Forgive me for the choices that I have made. I'm human. Lord, I still make some some bad mistakes, God, I have to pay for. But Lord, I thankful my choice has always been you. &gt;&gt; No matter what this flesh body throws at me, my choice is in you, God. &gt;&gt; I choose you. How many would raise your hands and say, "God, I choose you tonight, Lord, over everything that the devil gives us, he'll make it look beautiful. He'll make it make it look easy, but God, I choose you tonight. I want you, God. Lord, forgive me for not giving you a 100% of myself. Lord, you see your people tonight, God. Lord, we stand here tonight needy. We need you, Father, to come on the scene. Our hands is raised, Lord. Mine's up, too, Father. Both of them. My choice is you. Father, I placed this service in your hands. Lord, I feel like it was a mess, but Lord, you could take a mess and make a message out of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, may I be a blessing to somebody, Father. Lord, we thank you in Jesus name. [Music] [Music] until there's just no more to give. I want to love love till there's just no more love. I could never never out love the Lord. Just &gt;&gt; raise your hands. Tell him that &gt;&gt; I want to live the way he wants me to live. I want to give until there's just no one to give. I want to love love till there's just no more love. I can never never outlive you, Lord. Keep singing as we gather around. &gt;&gt; I want to live the way he wants me to live. I want to give until there's just no more to give. I want to love love till there's just no more love. I could never never outlaw the Lord. We have a testimony from Brother Bruce Paris. He said, "I have a testimony regarding a my cataract situation. Yesterday I had my second successful surgery done with a follow-up this afternoon and I'm so thankful for God's great mercy providing the skilled surgeon with the expertise to implant two toric lenses in my eyes returning my vision to 2020. Amen. Thank the Lord for that. We believe God can move on any request. Let's we want to remember brother Matt. He'll be ministering in Louisiana this weekend at brother Tim's meetings. We want to pray for him and the other brothers that are there that they'll have some outstanding services. We want to continue to pray for our camp coming up. How many's been praying for it already? &gt;&gt; Believe God's going to move. We had a we had a probably one of the best years last year we've had. &gt;&gt; Got a lot of pressure. Lord's got a lot of pressure on him this year. Make this even greater. How many has an unspoken request? Raise your hands. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, first we want to remember the meetings at Brother Tims this weekend. Father, may you be with Brother Matt and the other ministers that's there, Father. Lord, those meetings have been some great ones in the past. We've been there, Father. Lord, they they're expecting a move from you, Lord. You know who's going to be there, Father. I pray may you move upon the ministry upon the people. &gt;&gt; Father, may you help them, Father. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Lord, we're praying for our camp, Lord, that you'll just come and move in your special way that you always do, Father. Lord, we're expecting great things from this camp, Lord. Be with the the ministry that's coming, Father. Be with the kids that's coming, Lord. Be with the staff and the the leadership, Lord. Lord, that we can do your perfect divine will, Father. It's not this is not for us, God. It's for your young people, Father. for you to move for them. &gt;&gt; Father, in the hand that was raised, Lord, you see every need behind those hands. Father, may you move upon that heart. No matter what it is, God, we believe you can move. Father, again, we thank you for this service, Lord. We place this service into your hands, Lord. It's going down into your books, Father. Lord, we just thank you in Jesus name. Amen. Sing it one more time, brother Tony. [Music] There has never been a day like this day to me. There has never been a day like this day. I see. There has never been a light that shines so bright as this day, this glorious [Music] day. [Music] &gt;&gt; Anybody have any testimonies? &gt;&gt; I want to thank the Lord. Sister Debbie went to her third visit to the orthopedic doctor and three for three. They said, "Miss Watkins, we all your scans are great. You're great. You maybe got a pinched nerve and uh so nothing serious apparently and just some rest." And I'm thankful the Lord is already she's already beginning to recover. Amen. Amen. Just some some light um physical therapy, mostly walking and uh that's doing the trick. So just want to trust the Lord for the rest of it. Camp was looking pretty impossible for her really. Um so but at least um the Lord is coming on the scene now. So I'm glad for that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Um I met a man in Fairbanks, Alaska this last weekend and um he found our church I think it's about been about a year ago. He's was in Mento. It's like a village north I think of Fairbanks, whatever. But um he God was dealing with him. I think he grew up in the message. But um and then he just like I I believe like did a search on YouTube for a message church and came across this church. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And so he was like excited. He knows all you guys. He's like, "Oh, Steve." Yeah. And I'm like, "That's my husband." But um that's coming up on his year. So he's that God dealt with him. I think he said October 10th or something like that, but it was just it was random. Not random, but it was just really cool. And um he's streaming, so &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Anybody else? [Music] &gt;&gt; I wanted to thank the Lord for protecting me and um my my three dogs. I um a lot of you may not know or may know I'm I'm on heart medication. I have to take one pill at night and one pill in the morning. And the pill when I take it at night, I lay the next one out on a little box on my nightstand to take the next morning. And the next morning I got up and somehow I forgot to take it. I got busy through the day. By the time I realized it, it was 1:30 in the afternoon and I thought I can't take it now because it'll be too close to the next dose. And so I just left it laying on the box. Later on that evening when I got ready to take my medication, I couldn't find the pill that was on the box. And I had remembered inside the box I keep my watch and I had lifted the box to get my watch out because I was in a hurry to get to an appointment. We couldn't find the pill anywhere. And then I thought, did I just take it and not realize I took two pills? Did I drop it and the dogs got it? It would have been fatal if the dogs had gotten it. And it would have been very bad for me if I had taken a double dose like that. And I was so upset. And so we got in the bed and we prayed and asked the Lord to protect me and the dogs. And everything was fine. Everybody got up the next morning. The dogs were still alive. I was still alive. Everything was fine. And I still have not found that pill. And so the Lord just took care of it wherever it went. Amen. Thank the Lord. Anybody else? [Music] So, we need to remember we'll be loading up the U-Haul this Sunday immediately following service. All hands on deck, including you, Gideon. Even if you're not going to camp, this might be your chance to get a blessing. Please come and help. Just remember that I believe there's no service here next Wednesday, the following Sunday, and the Wednesday after camp. No service this Sunday. Yeah. Yeah. Don't forget.
