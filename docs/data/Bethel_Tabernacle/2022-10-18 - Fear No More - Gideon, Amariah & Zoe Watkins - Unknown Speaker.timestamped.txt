[0:00] [Music]
[0:10] every anxious thought that steals my
[0:15] breath
[0:16] it's a heavy weight
[0:19] upon my chest
[0:21] as a lie awake and wonder what the
[0:25] future will hold
[0:27] help me to remember that you're in
[0:31] control you're my courage when I were in
[0:36] the dead of all night you're my strength
[0:40] cause I'm not strong enough to win this
[0:43] fight you are greater than the battle
[0:47] raging in my mind I will trust you Lord
[0:52] I will fear no more I will lift my eyes
[0:58] I will lift my cares
[1:03] and I'll leave them there when the wind
[1:08] and waves are coming you shelter me even
[1:13] though I'm in the storm the storm is
[1:17] [Music]
[1:21] instead of night night
[1:34] [Music]
[2:00] [Music]
[2:16] you are greater than the battle raging
[2:20] in my mind I will trust you Lord I will
[2:26] fear no more
[2:29] girls
[2:41] [Applause]
