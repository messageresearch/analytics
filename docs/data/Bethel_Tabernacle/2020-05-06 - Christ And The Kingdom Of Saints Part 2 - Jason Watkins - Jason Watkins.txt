that was beautiful praise the name of the Lord you loving man everybody ready for the word tonight I wanted us look right into the camera out there to the audience and just say wow I miss all you guys man I walked out onto the platform and just looked out here and I'm glad for the brothers and who are here and brother Justin able to bring his family again before they head back and uh but my goodness I sure want to see everybody's smiling face some of some of the saints I haven't seen in weeks amen haven't talked to him at all so we sure are missing everybody Amen sister dad was telling me today she really miss and being here amen and she was would have been here tonight I think she's lined up to be here Sunday so we're - a piano player tonight but my goodness brother Matt brother John pulled it off wow that's awesome my Amen I was enjoying that from the back praise the name of the Lord amen Luke 17 we're going to go back to our text from Sunday amen and we're going to take apart to want to go take a little further announced Sunday that we would have this in a series and so I only have one prayer request that came in from brother Luther so if you have one you want to get it to me make sure you send it to me personally on on whatsapp that's what monitor I can't look at all the places even though I make a mad dash to try to do it every service but it's helpful if everything can come into one place and we catch all of our prayer requests amen Luke chapter 17 we're just going to read we read lengthy version of it Sunday were preaching continuing Christ in the kingdom of Saints we want to catch verses 6 through 10 and the Lord said if you had faith as a grain of mustard seed you might say unto this sycamore tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle will say unto him by and by when he has come from the field go and sit down to meet and will not rather say unto him make ready wherewith I may sup and gird thyself and serve me till I have eaten and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him I think not so likewise ye when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do let's pray father I thank you for your word now Lord I thank you for your fresh anointing that I feel upon me lord I thank you for every tidbit of of inspiration you've given me Lord I this burden is upon my heart and I've just pondered it all throughout the day Lord since early morning keeping my mind just reserved Lord to come minister now I pray you'll anoint it to the hearer your word of course has already anointed its speakers and hearers that need it Lord so we're committing ourselves to you and humbling ourselves before your presence we commit it now to you it's your service in Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you friends as you're seated christ and the kingdom of saints you know it the bible promises in the book of Revelation that the kingdom will be given to the Lord and His Christ and of course we have proven and shown you in teaching many times that's a reference to the Lord Jesus that's a reference to mr. and mrs. Jesus Christ that's a reference to the Lord Jesus Christ and his bride to our Lord and His Christ because we realized that Christ is it is a broad term that means the anointed word or when the word is made manifest that becomes Christ and so hence brother Branham could make a reference to Jeremiah and say Jeremiah was Christ because he was the anointed Word the Bible so much this this principle is so plain that when the anointing of God and the presence of God and the Word of God came into Moses that literally his his his countenance shone and they it was so bright they couldn't look at it and they had to veil his face and the Bible actually said Moses was God to the people and and brother Branham says when that word was inside him then he was the Living Word he was God to the people he said and then when he gave out that word then he went back to being Moses again now that's an amazing statement but we realized that during that day the the life of God could not remain inside of us like that it could come upon Moses it could come upon prophets it could come upon David it could move through them and speak through them it could it could have a an effective baptism upon John in his mother's womb but we realized that the first time the Holy Spirit came and remained on a vessel and didn't ever have to leave was on the Lord Jesus until Calvary's cross death burial resurrection ascension and then he sent back that life into his church his body his bride and now now that's why brother Branham would say she is him he would say things like that when a saint of God I quoted this Sunday how that would any believer takes not any promise of God and puts it upon your lips and speaks it with faith that's the exact same as deed he speak in all heavens and earth move under the power of those words and so we realize that that the Lord Jesus was building a kingdom we talked about it extensively on Sunday don't need to go back and cover all of that again but we covered in depth about God's great purpose from eternity and he was not you know I it's amazing that people imagine that Calvary is just you know sometimes I wonder the way they teach the purpose of God it's almost like God was just playing a dice game and just rolling the dice well let me go down and here's a good idea I can't seem to save the world I've been trying for four thousand years Oh Eureka I got it I'll go down and live as a man and I'll die a death and get hung on a cross and maybe somebody will believe finally you know God did not send Christ he did not come in Christ on an uncertain errand God knowing the end from the beginning purposed the death burial resurrection of Christ and purposed your life to be here so that you could receive that life and because his whole plan from Genesis and before Genesis is recorded God had a vision of a kingdom a kingdom of saints a kingdom a replication of himself a multiplication is a better word of himself God would not simply create a family here is the beauty of their of the opening of the seventh to restore back the original teaching of the early church it restores you to a truth that soul passes by denominational understanding of the Godhead that we find out that God didn't just create a family actually God became a family and that's why it is a legitimate I want to tell you tonight it is a legitimate statement it is not hyperbole it is not a parable it is not a metaphor to say I am a part of God I came from God I am identified as coming from him because I have the ability they're very unique ability to say amen to every word of God nothing that I did of myself to married it but I was simply came from the elected son Christ was the elected son and I came from Christ I am part of him and it's not wishful thinking in fact is if I was going to go based on what I thought I would never include myself in such a station but but I cannot deny that this screams a man inside my heart I can't stop it I can't make it come I can't make it leave when I read these words every fiber of my being says yes sir Amen Lord be it unto me Lord you can't bring yourself there you can't make yourself that grace grace God's grace hello my friends of course we've taught it many times before God gives a legitimate chance for every man to save himself God loves life takes no pleasure in the death of anything or anyone not even sinners not even people who reject him he doesn't take pleasure in the fact that they destroyed themselves he offers salvation to all but that's that's a different level than what we're talking about today we're talking about out we're talking about origin we're talking about genes we're talking about a seed gene of the Word of God I believe this word because what's in me and this word and the one who wrote this word is all the same substance it's all the same substance that's the beauty that is what the Seventh Seal opened to us it as I've said many times that was what was missing in the Trinitarian formula they they couldn't see husband and wife they simply saw three individual gods the oneness the Unitarian all they see is Jesus only they don't they don't include his body in their formula that the bride the kingdom of saints is part of the mystery of the Godhead hallelujah and we found out Sunday that God is bringing all of those whose origin was in him he is bringing you you say what is my life about what has it been about you know I say brother Jason I've got a pretty reckless past and I've got a history I'm not proud of I don't I don't I'm not even caring about that I'm here to tell you that from the day you breathe there God was bringing you to a vision a vision that he had of you in himself before the foundation of the world and it's a very lovely vision it is a state of perfection and you you've got to realize that your life here is being brought to his vision of you and we made that we made the inference last Sunday that you don't want to run afoul of that many people many of God's family his elect family his genes bring injury to themselves to repeat myself from Sunday run themselves up onto the rocks and get all cut to pieces uh you know they're you know because there God has a plan for them they run afoul of that and they they end up you know in the rocks and bust it up and so you want to as soon as you possibly can find the wherewithal don't wait when the Holy Spirit calls you listen up young people when the Holy Spirit calls you repent immediately go ahead and take the plunge and give your whole life to the Lord Jesus Christ I promise you you have a much more blessed life I don't care what the circumstances end up I'm talking about your life will pattern the vision God had of you amen so we found that that we closed off son to hell that Satan was trying had always tried to kill the holy child tried and he tried to get it he's trying to stop the seed he's trying to stop this kingdom from coming so he tries to kill Abel it didn't work God replaced him with Seth he comes along and you know he we seen the patterns in the scripture I don't want to just keep going through them all you know that we saw that Esau was determined to kill Jacob but God preserved him and wouldn't let it happen we see that Judas betrays Jesus and Satan thought he had him there but he didn't have him and he's been hunting him he tried to kill Moses and God protected Moses he tried to he did kill Jesus and that was by God's allowance Jesus said I lay my life down I pick it back up again said to Pilate you have no power except what my father gives you and the only power he's going to give you is whatever accomplishes his purposes so you just remember that friends if you believe that your intellect gene of God I don't care what's happening in your life understand that for whatever reason in God's discretion it's being allowed now it might be that God's teaching you a lesson because you're running afoul of the vision I don't know my my advice to you if you think that you're off of his perfect path you better stop drop and roll close you're on fire hey man come up here and I'll I'll throw a blanket over you and try to put it out and we'll get you get you born again of the Spirit of God and then you'll be burning from the inside hey man that was the advantage John had friends you know that's why a submarine can handle depth because pressure on the inside is greater than pressure on the outside otherwise pressure on the outside would crush the hull you get down and it's me it's many tons per per inch no they couldn't build a steel hull strong enough that I'd do it mater building out of titanium it wouldn't matter you go down deep enough and it'll crush it if there's no pressure inside pushing out the outside pressure will push in that's why when they tried to boil John and a vat of boiling oil they couldn't burn him on the outside cuz the fire he had on the inside was greater than what was on the outside yeah a man that that's a point I made in the very first sermon I ever preached I pulled that one up out of mothballs it wasn't in my notes and I was sitting here thinking about it ah but I want that fire on the inside now I want to take a practical turn tonight if you will indulge me to let me take about 3540 minutes here and just just just bring a practical side of this because this isn't all about a thorough high-altitude preaching you know we did a lot of that Sunday I'm opening up tonight with a lot of that but listen this stuff's got to get down where the rubber meets the road because if it's true we believe it's true and I think I proved it to you that you were called before the foundation of the world you came from God you're a part of God you're going back to God you have an Amen inside you then then that's not just here to give you you know dancing and and and and and and and and the liberties that that happiness would bring it means that there's gonna be a responsibility placed upon our lives it means that that that the enemy's going to fight you harder than most and it means that God is looking for something from you he didn't just remember as you've heard me say he didn't just say okay you're saved see in heaven you're here on a mission it's not an uncertain mission you mission here is no less is no more uncertain than Jesus was his mission was very certain and yours is no less certain than his was because he was fulfilling the headship part you understand of our Lord and His Christ that's you now you've got something to fulfill so when we when we look at the Bible the Bible isn't is an incredible book you know if we were not going there tonight but you get there you get the the Proverbs the Psalms and the Proverbs and we've taken such comfort from the Proverbs and from the Psalms and the Proverbs have such instruction day-to-day you know instructions and and I love the fact that you know the instructions are broad enough to where you know it's not just like you know what do you do if this exact situation happens no got God moving from Solomon you know gives sweeping principles so that you can go through life and whatever situation you find yourself in in the 21st century don't cop out and say well there's no scripture for this I promise you there's nothing you'll face that there's not a scripture for there's nothing you're going to face in this modern day before we get out of here that's not covered from the cradle to the grave this is your book of principles and guidance this is your lifeline this is your guidebook this is your reference manual this is your book of life it's your book of hell that your book of freedom your book of safety it's your book of power power over the devil power over the world power over sin and power over the flesh oh my I'm here to take something friends I don't I don't and it's not in that order with me the biggest enemy I got is not the world of not the devil and not sin in the world it's this old guy in the mirror that guy gives me more trouble hallelujah I thank God for the power of the of the Word of God that it can it can keep us clean and keep us free there's so many things that Solomon talks about in wisdom and and it and it goes to show you that the Bible is an application book see many people think that what's written in the Bible you know is is is in majority to do with getting people into heaven you know getting people right with God and saving their souls for all eternity of course that is that is that is at least probably half the Bible but you wouldn't call that the majority because equal to that equal to two getting people into heaven equal to getting people right with God equal to getting people born-again in their soul and it has to do not only with that but it has to do with with their course of life it is equally concerned with not just going to heaven but living on this earth that's an important point and that is a almost a a center part of the part of the hub that's a major spoke to this whole series that you understand that the Bible you know it's not just you know mostly to do with getting people born-again and getting them to heaven it certainly has its fair share of that it does have many things to do with that of course but but not above the other vital purpose of the Bible and that is concerned with living on earth and living well not just living but living well that's a challenge in this day because you got a world of such insanity you've got a world that's overrun that we have exceeded the days of Noah and the days of Noah God already destroyed the world that's how bad it was we're more than a half-century worse than that in the days of lot as soon as he left out of the city at rain fire and brimstone down and wiped everything out we're already more than a half century you are living in unparalleled unprecedented evil a time that Jesus identified uniquely as a time when Satan would be the god of the evil age that was never in any age until this age that he would be worshiped in church as Christ and and people wouldn't realize it but they're literally worshipping the devil this is the age and the only age when they for the second time would crucify the Word of God afresh and put him to an open shame so this is this is an epic moment in history and you know we we have our Bibles we have the word and we have not just a closed Bible because that's what it was that's what it testifies of itself that no man can understand it except that whom God opens it to and God promised that there would go down through many ages of the church and he would partially reveal it but he promised at the end time he would totally restore the full revelation you understand I'm here to tell you something friends that not only gives you life that not only gives you sanity that lets you live in robust sanity I'm here - I'm here to rejoice I live in robust sanity I don't just have a little bit of better knowledge than the world I'm sane I'm alive I have a great purpose I understand what's going on I understand what's called for from me I'm not in the dark I'm not groping the ages before were trying to find their way under partial light but God has brought not just the secret and the unlocking of the mysteries but he has brought us back the understanding how to live as kingdom saints we live as Kingdom Saints as Jesus said in his prayer when they asked him how do we pray one of his quotations in his prayer was on earth as it is in heaven so in other words here's my great prayer to God make this earth like the image of me there whatever I'm like there make me like that here help me to strive for that Lord what a target what is something to put out in front of you friends and so we realize that when we talk about Solomon's wisdom or the wisdom of Moses or the wisdom of Abraham or the wisdom of David or the wisdom of all the prophets you know that wisdom you know is the biblical term for this for this on earth as it is in heaven that's what wisdom is all about that's why when you read about wisdom in the Sun in in in proverbs it speaks of wisdom as a woman because at the end time that that's the whole the whole picture of Christ and his bride you understand that you're now the Living Word and so you are the dis the dispensers of wisdom to the world not because you're out here on the street corner screaming at everybody but your everyday walking around life when people see how you conduct yourself in this madness and you live in robust sanity then you're proving that there is a wisdom that exceeds the wisdom and knowledge of man because the wisdom of knowledge and man at his highest level can't fix the world he tries he can't get it fixed it's only getting worse everything he tries simply makes it worse because he's drawing his wisdom from the wrong source he thinks he's drawing wisdom in fact he's drawing knowledge from the 3 of 9 which of good and evil see so we want to draw on real wisdom we we understand that it's the Petersons called wisdom the art of living skillfully in whatever actual condition we find ourselves see has nothing to do with information don't ever think the message is information is not information it's not just doctrine not theology brother Branham wasn't the problem when brother Branham preached indictment and he was showing them here's how you have crucified the Word of God you have committed spiritual adultery you have adult Erised the word and you've changed its meaning to meant to agree with man what man wanted it to say man wanted a a less rigorous version on his flesh because he he was living in an unconverted state and it's just too hard when you're unconverted a Christian life here in misery because you're always fighting against this insatiable urge for sin but you don't want to go to hell or you're afraid that you're gonna miss the rapture or all kinds of things like that that and that's and a lot of people I've said this for years so a lot of people get just enough of God in their life to make them miserable they don't go all the way but they get just enough knowledge to be afraid not to live something and they can go 10 years 20 30 40 years and never really actually have passed from death unto life and it finally they finally collapse because I'm here to tell you you might could have got by with that in the 90s in the early 2000s but here in the 21st century there's just no doing it the world is just too wicked you can't hold up under it you'll have a nervous breakdown trying to be a Christian without the Holy Ghost see so it's so brother Branham was trying to get them to understand you've rejected the the seed of life the Word of Life this is a bleeding word has life in it and and it has a life that can come into your life and show you how to live like this life like his life so that so that the kingdom is the kingdom of Christ and His Saints see so so we find out then that it has nothing really to do with knowledge as such a college therefore college degree it's certainly no certification of wisdom I've said to you in past services that the Antichrist is actively as we speak on a daily basis every 24 hours he has a game plan and he is literally molding people into the image of the tribulation they are headed into tribulation is a time of crazy madness and mankind is taking that on even ahead of the tribulation the tribulation is a time of unparalleled trouble and mankind has never been so troubled he he acts troubled he conducts himself troubled the the slightest little thing can take even even the most sane looking citizen one second I guarantee you brother Kevin could come up here tonight and just tell you the story after story about somebody who they got called who just had totally lost it and maybe had seen them sometime before that and they seemed like a perfectly normal person and and you don't realize that the world is walking the streets with ticking time bombs people just on the edge oh my goodness friends they don't realize they're going over that edge I want to be part of that group that's headed up in an order of ascending every day I'm here to tell you I know it's happening because every day the world gets worse I get more joy and more happiness and more determination the worst the world gets the more determined I become how can that be explained except by the Holy Ghost the same way the Antichrist is molding people into the image of the tribulation they are headed into the Holy Ghost came to mo you into the kingdom you are headed for you believe that he's here to mold you let me read you something brother Branham said brother Cao brother who's on the board give me revelation fifteen three sorry to jump you keV I should have gave you a warning revelation 15 three this one quick verse wait till we get it up here I can read along alright brother branham takes this up at the church age book and he says in they sang and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the lamb saying great and marvellous are thy works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints brother Branham says do you see it now he's gonna ask you this is a question do you see it the lamb the high priest holding his blood as an atonement on the mercy seat for our sins and it's the Lord God Almighty see that is his present office that is what he's doing now pleading his blood for our sins aren't you glad aren't you glad for that but one day that lamb will become the Lion of the tribe of Judah he will come forth in power and glory to take his authority to reign his king now we're moving into the Millennium alright you got me right now he's interceding with his blood but one day he becomes lying the king of a millennial world alright so he says he will come forth in power alright to reign as king he is now watch this he is the coming king of this earth boy I doubt if the Kremlin or the Vatican or Washington likes that but he is the king of this earth he is the coming king of this earth of course that does not say he is not King now for he is our King see King of the Saints so you have a sovereign you have a king that you're you're you're a different citizen you have a different sovereign you understand we live here I'm not an American I'm a Christian I appreciate my land for what little bit of fragment is left of the old original idea which is fading fast but but but I appreciate that that I'm not going down with this world I am ascending up and when I come back we're gonna set up Christ and his kingdom of saints are gonna set up a Millennial Kingdom on this earth alright so he says right now is it is a spiritual Kingdom it is not of this world system even as we are not of this world that's why you can't be a Christian and act like the world that that point alone goes to show that people are living in nominal Christianity and they're not in they don't have any portion in this family of Saints because he's not even their King if he was their king they would be living according to his commandments so they they have him in name only I'm not being cruel I'm not calling names I'm not trying to put people down I'm trying to warn the world that that you think you're a Christian and you're fine you're not and you're not it's gonna be okay no it's not gonna be okay because the king is a real king and he has a real word and he has a real holy spirit and he wants to for real live inside you and then when he does that your life will look like his life it can no longer look like the world's life that is impossible so he says it is not of this world system even as we are not of this world that's the reason you ever wonder why here it is that's the reason we act different from the world our citizenship is in heaven I love this statement i'ma say it slow so you can absorb it we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth you understand we reflect why are we different what well what is this difference about us what is this difference that the world can see here's what it is we are reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth I don't reflect this current world I'm not a reflector of that it has an image I don't want to reflect that I have no interest in reflecting that I'm here I realize that the Bible doesn't just isn't just trying to get me to heaven the Bible is teaching me how to live here because his kingdom is going to be here so I where aware you think about it friends you're already like an advance party establishing in the world what the world is going to look like when everybody is full of his life hallelujah so he says we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth where Jesus is the king not will be but is that is why our women do not dress in men's clothing or cut their hair or use all those cosmetics and other things that the world likes so much that is why our men don't drink and smoke and carry on and sin here's why see people think it's legalism it's not bad at all it has nothing to do with legal anything I'm above the law I'm above the law I'm in Christ there is nothing of the wall that is relevant to me I am in Christ perfected in Christ he already lived his life in representation mine I get credit for the life he already lived I cannot be indicted I cannot be arrested I cannot be convicted I can't even be try can't even be I can't even be accused in the month in the courtroom of God I have diplomatic immunity because I'm not from here understand Satan cannot bring on accusation against me when he tries he doesn't even it's not even accepted in God's Court there is now therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus Paul's argument was look I'm not the one who died it was Christ see so it's not anything about a legalism it has nothing to do with that our Dominion is the dominion over sin and it is enforced through the power that is in the Spirit of Christ that indwells us that's why you've been if the world is listening tonight and you wonder why are all you people why do you women dress so old-fashioned why do your men dress old-fashioned why do you not do these things of the world why can't you be like all the nominal Christians because there's there's a Dominion that lives inside me and it's enforced through the power that is in the Spirit of Christ that indwells me every Kingdom on earth is going to be torn down but ours will remain now who's living in sanity and who's living in robust sanity I'm here to taste something friends you're part of a kingdom a kingdom of saints and it's in force it's it's a Dominion of the it's it's a power it's a Dominion that you have accepted into your life and it's it's taken you over see that that is what half this Bible is about half this Bible is about that about you living a successful Christian life under the Dominion of the power of God see so Jesus now you know he he makes that statement and and I and where we read give me our text again by the cab where we read out of Luke 17 6 through 10 and and I and I and I want to I want to take note of verse 7 Luke 17 7 but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle will say unto Him by and by now catch it when he has come from the field now that's where we're that's going to become us right now we're laboring were the 11th hour workers or that were the last shift we're the lab there's not another shift coming the 11th hour worker was it that was in Jesus parable we all come into the field one of these days we're gonna come in from the field friends so now then he then look down at verse 10 for the Kevin so likewise when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you so now I I'm I'm I'm I'm projecting to you tonight the the unique quality of this seventeenth chapter of Luke now you already know because we read on down on Sunday as it was in the days of lot as it was in the days of Noah as the Lightning cometh from the east and south into the West any of us here who are who have cut our teeth you know reading the message understand that Luke 17 is a monumental chapter for us because it in place after place after place it's speaking of the group of people who come to the end time guess what that's you that's me we're getting ready to come in from the field we're almost to the point where we've done all the things that have been commanded for the church to do oh what a thrilling thought that is friends our labor is almost over hallelujah so then then this ought to have a very direct impact we ought to look at these words in this description and in this description Jesus is talking about your service to the king now we've been sitting here for 3540 minutes rejoicing that weird part of the kingdom and that we have a king and we're part of his genes a man and we have a dominion over sin a man but remember what he's saying he shouldn't need these are kingdom principles that says chapters 17 16 back through there that that's why the the Pharisees Jesus is giving principle after principle saying look the kingdom of heaven now the kingdom of Earth is this this this but the kingdom of heaven is likened to the kingdom of heaven is like unto so the world has its normal sea and God calls it foolishness but Jesus said but now the kingdom of heaven is an altogether different thing and they're running simultaneously and we are reflecting the spirit of the land of our rebirth where Jesus is the king a man that's what makes us different and so when we look at these principles Jesus is telling us how to act telling us how to think he's saying look put yourself you realize that you're the servant you're the servant and you're you're not here to to say to God I'm hungry you know feed me what I want but that's what people say give me a word that I can that'll fit me instead of me fitting the word give me a word that's comfortable and and and and sing me a beautiful song that's what not sinners in the Old Testament wanted they wanted comfortable words they didn't like those prophets those prophets were they said all they're just angry old men are always bawling us out and and you know we want to hear a pleasant song and you know and we want comfortable words and the profit would come back time after time with a message of doom Elijah comes stomping out of the wilderness with one single message you're all gonna die you're all a bunch of filthy sinners and God's killing everybody and I'm the only one even left he wasn't mistaken thank God the Lord still had a representation in the earth but it wasn't gonna end well for those prophets of bale 450 of them wasn't going to end well for forum 400 of them I think and so we find that that he's saying you know you don't say to the king fit the word to me you know the Kings not saying to you hey you know sit down take it easy half a meal the King said Jesus said what a king's say that to his servant he said I don't think so said the king would say listen you're my servant gird yourself and get yourself ready to serve me I know you've been out there in the field in the hot Sun all day that's beside the point now you're in here to serve me at my table and I'm not even going to thank you for it because and not only that as if as if to add insult to injury he's going to say in fact when you when you show me your successful work in the field and you shall you successfully serve me my meal then you're gonna go and you're gonna write sentences I am an unprofitable servant 500 times on the chalkboard oh I had to do that one time I had to write sentences I forget what I'd done in class but you know I was stubborn and so I didn't do and so a hundred became two and I dug in more and two became four and I dug in more and four became eight we're talking to hundreds and by the time it was over I think I would the teacher of something like fourteen or fifteen hundred sentences and my I think my mom had to get involved and say that if we're not doing that will will making you you reduce it to half an and so the teacher compromised and I setup for two or three nights writing sentence oh mama day something friends that you don't want to resist Authority that's over yeah amen so he's saying your your your to here's your here's to be as a kingdom child this should be your attitude I'm just an unprofitable servant now that sounds that I mean the human you know the the agnostic are the atheist would go Wow why do you serve a god like that doesn't even appreciate you for the work you you've done listen friends you know what our answer to that can only be to say bud if I worked every day for a thousand years by the sweat of my brow I could never repay him for the debt of love I owe because when I've worked those thousand years then I've got all eternity ahead of me my vacation my retirement is out of this world brother Joe oh my and so you know we we think about these words that he says here your your to say III was verse 10 was when you shall have done all those things which are command you say now this is us this is the end time say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do and I began to look at that and I I found some wonderful commentary how that this word unprofitable that it that you know it has a I want to try to show you a different angle tonight that this word unprofitable has a rude word synonymous to this actual root word and it and it's the the synonym quino's and we and what it literally means is is empty it means empty now that's what a eunuch is a eunuch is a he's a Chamberlain to the to the court to the King's wife he doesn't at all try anything himself he's sterile first of all he has there's no passing of his seed to the King's wife he he only guards her provides her needs whatever she needs and the king has no fear to leave her in the presence of this eunuch or this Chamberlain and this is this is what you are as a servant of God you're empty you understand and and the commentator the commentator says you know unprofitable and this is this is actually why he started looking at the root meanings because he kept reading this word unprofitable unprofitable he says this being the inescapable truth I decided to turn a lemon into lemonade beautiful and he says it means empty as in the song that we sing when we we we have altar calls and we sing the song I grew up as a child hearing this played and sung at altar calls nothing in my arms I bring simply to thy cross I cling he goes on he says since it was certain and proven in the Bible that I had in my fallen condition no value to such a holy and high being I died to self completely that's the well what a way to look at being unprofitable that he's literally turning it around he's saying this isn't a disparaging thing this isn't a hard-nosed boss this is God saying no your your there's nothing of you profitable to me your only profit is if I can work through you your your to be empty you understand he says since it was certain that in this fallen condition I had no value to such a holy and high being I died to self completely as a pure servant I I took Paul's counsel and I died daily and thus managed to stay out of his way never trying to inject my ideas or actions however well-intentioned I presented myself each new day as an empty and clean vessel for him to work through by filling this unprofitable servant with all of himself God successfully did it all and deserved all the glory he says this is noteworthy by the Lord and Luke's Gospel started shouting I thought what a way to look at Luke 1710 the Lord is not being snarky and cruel and cutting he's simply trying to get you to understand what it means to be a servant you have no intrinsic value to him your best effort your best holiness is filthiness to him that's how high he is your best holiness friends that's why it's not about legalism God can't use your good works God God wants you to bring him your worst so that he can empty you out and fill you with all of himself and then you're truly a servant to God you're on you are unprofitable he's the only profitable life and so by dying daily I love how he ended it by filling this unprofitable servant with all of himself God successfully did it all and deserved all the glory here's a man who understood what it meant to die daily to see that that you with all of your wisdom and knowledge and creativity and zeal and spunk and fervor and all of these things you do nothing but get in God's way you just get in his way and what he needs you to do is just die completely realize that to say I'm empty nothing in my arms I bring I have no value to you Lord except you working through me I am willing to be a kingdom vessel how many are willing to be that a kingdom vessel you know when I must and when I look at this world come brother John a man will try to a song here before we go to prayer you know when I was I think I was telling you Sunday that that in school I ran track I was on the track team I was a distance runner and I did some some long jumping and some distance running and I ran relay races and I I ran distance races and I I remember whenever I would be running a race and I would have a certain pace because you've got to pace yourself in a distance run to make sure you can finish and you know I I had this thing that even my coach he didn't like it so good but it was it was how it worked for me and I and I would always when I would run these races I would just run at a speed that would keep me you know about mid-pack and it wasn't until I made that final turn on the track and weigh probably several football fields in length I could see the finish line and as soon as I come around that last cross-country corner and come back around and I would see that finish line I would turn on the Jets something about seeing the finish line boosted me to pour it on I would and and after you're running a long distance you know we were running three miles and and by the time here you're gonna sprint that last 200 meters maybe 300 meters you almost feel like you're running on air yeah that's hard to explain the I don't know if it's blood to your head or whatever you're overheated or whatever it is but it feels like you're in a dream and when you're sprinting at the end of a long run and I and I loved it I loved that euphoric feeling of seeing and I was always I was either always first or second across that line and the coach would always say where was some of that energy during the Midway and I said I was saving it for the Hinton he never liked it he never got used to it but I never changed it because I will taste some friends I see the finish line I can see it's a buzz Jason the craziness of the world I see a finish line you see man this I see I'm almost home hallelujah and it makes me want to run it makes me want to serve it makes me want to be all that God has seen of me in his vision of his mind that's my great desire friends amen I hope it's yours tonight that's enough for tonight we'll pick it up again on Sunday amen praise the Lord brother John sing something
