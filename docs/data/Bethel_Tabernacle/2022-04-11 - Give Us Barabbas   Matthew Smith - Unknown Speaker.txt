TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let's all stand and have a word of prayer dear lord we want to thank you for this opportunity to come and speak your word and ask that you would use me anoint my lips that i would be able to get out of the way and that you'd be able to speak through me and give the people something that they would be able to use in these in dark times that they would be hone their swords and and become more and more like you today than more than they were yesterday and that they would use these things to become more like you tomorrow to see your word for our day we ask these things in jesus name amen so i want to um while we're standing i want to turn to um matthew 27. and we're gonna turn to verse six uh actually let's see um let's go to verse 12. says um and when he was accused of the chief priests and elders he answered nothing then said pilate unto him hearst thou not uh not how many things they witness against thee and he answered i lost my place and he answered him to never a word in so much that the governor marveled greatly now at that feast the governor was want to release unto the people a prisoner whom they would and they had then a no a notable prisoner called barabbas therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto them whom will ye that i release unto you barabbas or jesus which is called christ for he knew that for envy they had delivered him when he was set down on the judgment seat his wife sent on him saying have thou nothing to do with that just man for i have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him and uh lord add his blessings to the reading of the word you all can be seated um so um i want to maybe i can pull it up on here um i have to i actually want to pull this scripture up oh is my tablet dead okay that's booting up so um i'll just pull it up on my phone um i want to go to um the same scripture which i'll come pardon me my machine died and so now i'm having to uh kind of go about this sideways um i want to go down to oops okay here we go so um one of the things that i found kind of interesting maybe you will too is the fact that that scripture it where it talks about who barabbas is and this is really interesting because i i wanted to look into that a little bit and as it turns out um and this is there's there's some debate as to um this because some of the early transcripts of the book of matthew have this and some of them don't um though the oldest ones that i could find kind of confirm this and then strong's confirms this and oddly enough one of the only modern translations that i could find that includes this is actually the niv of the book of matthew and if we read i want to read this matthew 27 starting at verse 15 and this is from the niv now it was the governor's custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd at that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was jesus barabbas so when the crowd had gathered pilate asked them which one do you want me to release to you jesus barabbas or jesus who is called the messiah for he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed jesus over to him so this strikes me because it strikes me that there's two jesus on trial here right that the crowd the religious world of the day had the option of two jesuses one of them obviously they crucified and the other one they chose because they chose barabbas which by the way the name barabbas means the son of god so these two men in appearance are very close they're very very close and to the religious world one of them looks a lot more appealing because he was in line with their preconceived notion of what the messiah would be right because barabbas and this is uh in in mark chapter 15 it says this very a lot more clearly but in the telling of the same story but barabbas was on trial for insurrection right insurrection or or trying to overthrow the government which to the jews that's what the messiah would do right he's going to overthrow the romans and this also makes sense because the romans didn't just crucify anybody crucifixion wasn't just something you they did willy-nilly it was specifically reserved for insurrectionists and people who were trying to overthrow the roman government it was a statement to is a public execution and they'd be left up there for days for all the people to see this is what happens if you stand up to the romans right and so this is why they're going to crucify him because he wasn't just a robber he wasn't even just a murderer he was someone who was challenging the roman government and that's what the jews saw as what the messiah would be because their view of the messiah was political right because i mean and this kind of makes sense because the entire history of the jewish church was that god dealt with them politically they had a law they had um you know the the levitical law organized them politically and how they would govern themselves whereas with jesus that wasn't the case right jesus's message was entirely non-political in fact jesus told people to give unto caesar what was caesar's right that wasn't just taxes right that was that was everything you do you know obey the rulers that are set over you because the kingdom of god is not political right but see the jews saw this as exactly what they were looking for it was he barabbas was the jesus that catered to their understanding of what the messiah would be yeah amen um let's see here um now um and we can see this again in the church today if you look at um all so much of the church nowadays is so invested in politics and campaigning against oh well we have to be active in our local elections because the school boards don't you see what they're doing in the schools and all these horrible things and oh you know we gotta we gotta stand up to those those democrats and and all the rhinos too you know like all those those republicans who are who are just gonna lay down and not stand up for the democrats we gotta get them out of the office in the primaries and they they you cannot turn on as brother jason demars talked about um previously it so struck me that the christian world is completely invested in creating the kingdom of god on earth through political elections and through political campaigning and through political parties and through current events and they're completely invested in current events and failing to recognize that the kingdom of god is not going to be made through an election right you know the jews the jews were so narrow-minded because they saw the kingdom of god as only extending to their borders right i mean say the jews were right and the messiah was there to to create their kingdom on earth well the kingdom on earth would be the size of israel and that's it christ didn't come to make a kingdom out of one little tiny strip of land in the middle east right the kingdom of god was global it was way beyond their borders and they completely failed to recognize it they completely missed it there was going to be an entire massive expansion to the kingdom of god that christ was came to save the whole world not just the jews right christ was the savior of the world but their vision of what the messiah was completely confined it completely bottlenecked the power of god into what fit with their denominational or preconceived notion of the message right or it's just to us and nobody else and more than that because it became so political it became carnal they had commodified it right i mean this is you you see this when when christ went to the temple when jesus went into the temple and kicked over the tables the money-making tables you know he does this twice one time it was had to do with um money lenders and money changers and the other time was people selling sacrifices right so you have you have jesus was completely not only was he against the financial systems that were robbing people but more importantly i think was that you had the people the fact that people were effectively selling atonement they were selling salvation oh you know it became so cheap and common that there was no longer a real repentance it was just go pay your dues at the church and you're good to go right so and they wanted they wanted a jesus that would conform to that right that would be okay with them doing making money off of the gospel or or you know the gospel of their day and they wanted a jesus that wasn't going to stand up to their institutions and and uh what they had put into place or what you know uh conformed to their delicate sensibilities they would not tolera they were willing to crucify the jesus that was that was bringing something that would create a relationship because that's what god was after from the beginning it was a it was about family it wasn't about about politics and so i see again today in again in the modern church you know brother jason demars made a statement that so struck me how the modern church would be clothed in newspapers right they're dressing themselves in the news in modern events in politics and i was thinking about that this morning and it's like adam and eve right adam and eve when they fall they're looking they make a man-made atonement a substitute atonement that's some little fig leaf covering well brother branham shows typed that as religion as man-made organized religion that their religion was just some cheap substitute for atonement that would appease their conscience but not actually a tone before god it wouldn't actually be doing anything but appeasing their conscience and nothing else well you know you have people today their their religion has become politics they're trying to appease their conscience it's it's both the appeasement of their conscience because oh i must be right before god because i'm saying something against them teaching some weird agenda in school right or i'm doing my political activism work and campaigning against whatever or you have the other group of people who are you know the jesus that conforms to their idea is the jesus that you know will marry the gays and you know let people live like any old devil they want and not actually stand up against it right you get both camps you get the group who will um you know their their jesus is the one who um you know again justifies all their political views you know in terms of well this candidate is is right because you know he's a god-fearing republican and this candidate is clearly of the devil because you know i don't know socialism but then you have the other side who will completely whitewash or you know completely paint over anything that's prickly anything that kicks anybody out of the plan of god because well it's not nice it's it's not politically comfy right it's you know everybody gets to go to heaven and you know the bible isn't the only way to get there and it's like well okay that's that's your version of barabbas right and the whole time regardless of which barabbas they're taking which angle on barabbas they're taking they're still going to crucify christ because the actual christ is the one that wants a relationship the actual christ is the one who's telling people to not worry about politics because that's satan's eden right that's give unto caesar what caesars because that's not we're not even involved in that who cares our kingdom isn't here right so what they're so what if they if they the schools are teaching something horrific it's a government-owned schools the gov it's a government-controlled and owned school give that school to caesar at caesars right maybe this is why you should homeschool your kids but anyways um the the just completely ignore that whole system entirely our kingdom the kingdom of god isn't defined by the news and politics it's defined by the relationship that we have with the god-made flesh it's the relationship that we have when we manifest the god made flesh though the real the real christ of our day is the one who is humble and small and isn't trying to make some big splash with you know again politics and and news coverage and isn't so consumed with the goings-on of this world because this world is entirely temporary you know i was one of the things i was thinking about recently um just a demonstration of just how completely consumed the world is by satan and his program you know you see this this sort of parallel where and brother brandon mentions this as well where you have god has six days of creation right which we know that six thousand years he takes six thousand years to build the garden of eden in the whole world and then you know satan comes in corrupts it and then now it's satan's turn to build satan's eden and he takes six thousand years right and we have six thousand years of history and we're living in the culmination of satan's eden that this is what satan has taken all this time to build and if god's culmination ends with something that's the perfect image of god a man who's the image of god then satan's eden would also end with an with a man who's the perfect image of satan right that i mean satan wants what god has he just has he's gonna he's gonna make himself the one on the throne instead of god well if this is the case what kind of people are gonna be at the end time right the the modern man has become completely an image of the perfect walking image of satan right completely self-involved and involved in building a kingdom here and one of the things that that so struck me is just the environment the culture everything is we have our media is you know old school television media radio media print media all that's going away and we've become invested in social media right everyone's got it in their pocket it's the amount of video i heard a statistic that youtube that to youtube has uploaded more video that if you had everybody on earth watching simultaneously you could not watch all the video that is uploaded to youtube every day right for 24 hours a day you just can't do it there's that much video being uploaded and everybody's personal lives are put on you on facebook or twitter or instagram or whatever there's you know just the complete documentation of everybody's lives um you know not to mention all the tracking that's on everybody's phones it's connected to all the apps everywhere you go everything you do your entire life is documented and so many times we have in the modern world in the modern satan's eden we have people who make do something stupid or or just have a bad moment and their life is forever ruined because that was the worst 10 seconds of their life was documented on video and uploaded to twitter and now the entire world remembers it and no matter what they do every job they apply for the person's going to google their name and that's the worst 10 seconds of their life will be what is displayed okay which so struck me that one of the major culminations of satan's eden is an environment a culture in which redemption is impossible you will never be redeemed in the eyes of the public because your worst ten seconds of your life will be is what is in the front of everybody's mind forever and this is this is the culminations of satan's eden whereas in the modern world right the true christ made flesh will will overlook those things we'll forgive will will say you know what maybe you did that but that's a you know god saves christ saves there's there's always a path back and because we're not invested in what the world sees and what's on social media and what's politically out there then who cares that you had something bad on social media it doesn't matter our our christ the christ of today is not so bothered with that right as long as there's repentance there's forgiveness there's redemption and um there you know but but how much how much of even even the modern christian world is invested in social media right where the the modern christian world has to have their facebook program and their their youtube program obviously i'm not against we stream on youtube and whatnot that's fine because we're just trying to you know spread our our uh our services to those who need it or you know record it for people who want to listen to it but you know what if google came down and dropped the band hammer on us and kicked us off on youtube or you know whoever facebook whatever and we got completely banned off the internet that's not going to change our message it's not going to change our revelation it's not going to change our relationship with christ because that's not our salvation right we're still going to have church but how much of the church world when they come in contact with the social media whatever you know the the various algorithms will completely bend the knee and cave because that's their entire foundation they don't have anything outside of what's here and now what's uh you know what the political system is doing they because you know after all if we lose our our foothold on twitter well then how are we going to campaign to get our you know candidate elected in the primaries right and so they're always going to chase because their kingdom is the kingdom of satan's eden their kingdom is the kingdom of um right here and now they're not building a kingdom that's going to last beyond right they're not gonna they're they're they're not building a kingdom that's going to last past the rapture or the tribulation right it's it's not going to go anywhere because it's say it's all built into satan's eden and when that when that eden is over there everything falls apart this is one thing that i just going back to that back to satan's eden you know if god's eden was ultimately pulled apart because satan got people he convinced man to eat of the tree of knowledge right that eating of a tree the tree of the midst of the garden would destroy god's eden right well satan has eden then there's a tree in the midst of that garden called the tree of life and ultimately satan's eden will be pulled apart by humans by people eating of the tree of life and and completely superseding and breaking out of the bounds and the confinements of satan's eden that we would not be subject to um the demands that the world would put upon us whether that be the trying to con perpetually corrupt your mind with fear and anxiety or or just temptations of the world that we would be completely uh completely transcend the world and become christ again become the tree of life so um i uh i really um it just so struck me that the modern how i could see that the the the story of of the world choosing barabbas choosing ultimately that entire story i think is a type of how people have ultimately have a choice of choosing the version of christ that will pet their notions they don't want to and we can we can throw it off on everybody outside these walls but ultimately if it comes down to well i don't want to give up that small thing because it's not that big of a deal even though you know that it probably isn't in line with what you should be doing it's not expedient it's not healthy are you choosing barabbas or are you choosing christ because anything that's going to pet your your you know it's going to be in line with what you want well again is it barabbas or is it christ so i'll leave you with that thank you for putting up with me let's stand and have a word of prayer lord we want to thank you for this opportunity to speak to the people and ask that you um be with them through the service and through the worship service anoint their hearts and open their hearts that we would be able to give the service to you father that you would have come and anoint our hearts to worship and seeing that you would fill the church and the and the people in their minds and keep their minds focused on you and the when the word would come that their hearts would be open and they would come expecting and that the word would anoint all the needs that they would have and they would bring healing and body and soul and spirit and anything that they would have need of that they would be able to come to you and that you would meet all their needs we ask these things in jesus name amen you
