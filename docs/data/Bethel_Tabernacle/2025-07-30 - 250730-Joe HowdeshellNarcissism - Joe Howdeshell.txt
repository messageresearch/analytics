Full of glory. Full of glory. Full of glory. It is joy unspeakable and full of glory. Oh that has never yet been told. I have found that hope so bright and clear. Living in the realm of grace. For the Savior's presence is so near. Hallelujah. His smiling face. It is joy unspeakable and full of glory full of glory full of glory. It is joy unspeakable and full of glory. All the half has never yet been told. I have found the joy no tongue can tell. How it weighs our glory roar. It is like a great overwhelming well springing up within my soul. It is joy unspeakable and full of glory full of glory full of glory. It is joy unspeakable and full of glory. Oh the has never yet been told. Just clap it now. [Music] Oh yes.

God bless you, brother, sister. Amen. and try this world is falling apart. We sang it a little while back. We'll try it again tonight. Do you got the words for that, Sarah? While living below, everywhere that I go, this world's full of trouble and pain. There's murder and crime. This is the end time when people are going insane. But I found a release. My heart is at peace. Since the word of the hour settled in with troubles untold, my anchor will hold to Jesus again and again. Oh, this world is falling apart. I'm so glad Jesus lives down in my heart. I'm carried away in the light of today. As the world gets so dismal and dark by the struggles and troubles outside, something is stirring inside of the bride. Hallelujah. As the world gets so dark and it all falls apart, I'm glad Jesus lives down in my heart. They're praying for peace, for violence to cease while holding a gun in their hand. There's moral decay, a great falling away in the shape this world's in. It won't stand. Let it crumble and fall. I'm not bothered at all. In the clft of the rock I can hide. When it all comes undone. I'm trusting in one who gives me his peace down inside. Oh, this world is falling apart. I'm so glad Jesus lives down in my heart. I'm carried away in the light of today. As the world gets so dismal and dark, while the struggles and troubles outside, something is stirring inside of the bride. As the world gets so dark and it all falls apart, I'm glad Jesus lives. Give me that second verse again. They're praying for peace, for the violence to cease while holding a gun in their hand. There's more of decay. The great falling away in the shape this world's in. It won't stand. Let it crumble and fall. I'm not bothered at all. In the cliff of the rock, I can't hide. When it all comes undone, I'm trusting in one who gives me his peace down inside. Oh, this world is falling apart. Oh yes, Lord. [Music] [Applause] [Music] As the world gets so dismal and dark from the struggles and troubles outside, something is stirring inside of the bride. As the world gets so dark and it all falls apart, I'm glad Jesus lives down in my heart. Oh, hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Something stirring inside of the bride. Amen. I can sense it here tonight. How about you? Hallelujah. Amen. [Music] Laying up, laying up my treasures in that home above. Trusting fully trusting in the Savior's love. Doing what I can for heaven's holy. I'm getting ready to leave this world. Getting ready to leave this world. Getting ready for the gates of pearl. Keeping my record bright. Watching both day and night. I'm getting ready to leave this world. Trusting in the riches of his saving grace. In each earthly trial I can trace. through that up in heaven. I will find a place. I'm getting ready to leave this world. Getting ready to leave this world. Getting ready for the gates of birth. Keeping my record right. Watching both day and night. I'm getting ready. I like this next verse. To prepare a mansion, Jesus said, "I'll go." If it were not true, I would have told you so. Just a little longer to linger here below. Hallelujah. I'm getting ready to leave this world. Getting ready to leave this world. Getting ready for the gates of pearls. Keeping my record bright. Watching both day and night. I'm getting ready to leave this world. [Music] Oh, hallelujah. [Applause] Amen. and brother Luther, if you'd come and take up the offering tonight. And Sister Emily, come on and prepare for your special. Hallelujah. Isn't God good, saints? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; Getting ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. Each day I'm getting ready just a little bit more every day. Wouldn't it be something to wake up in the morning in a different place than here? Amen. The faith has to climb to that point that at any moment, at any time. So, we do want to make ready. Amen. And he is more than willing, you know, the prophet said he was more willing to give you the Holy Ghost than you were to receive it. So, it's just that step of accepting what he's done for you and believing it. He'll take care of the rest. Amen. Let's pray. Father, I love you this evening. Lord, I just thank you, Father, for the revelation of who you are, what you're doing in this day and time. Lord, if I didn't have that, Father, I would be above all men most miserable. Lord, seeing what's going on out there in the world cosmos. Father, the song said, people are just going insane. Father, we pray that you help us and we thank you for the right mind, a mind of peace, a mind of righteousness, the mind of Christ. I pray that you grant that to each and everyone here and those that would listen, Father. And Lord, as we gather together, we come to see you. We may not see you physically, Father, but may we sense with faith your presence amongst us, Lord. how much you want to talk to us. How much you want to comfort us. How much you want to release all the cares of this life. Father, we look to you this evening. Break the bread of life to our hearts. Bless the man that would come. Help him to move aside, Lord. Many times a minister will come and speak things he doesn't even know why. But your spirit is taking those words and anointing your children and helping each and every one as we collect the tithes and offerings. Lord, I pray that you would bless the cheerful giver. Father, we thank you so much for the bounty that you give us. Help us to be diligent, Lord, and to be remembering why you gave it to us. We love and worship you, Father, in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] Amen. Good. Sister Emily, you can be seated. [Music] I know you're going through the fire. It's getting hard to stand the heat. [Music] Even harder is the wonder. [Music] Is God's hand still on me? [Music] It's lonely in the flames and it seems you won't make it one more day. [Music] But the potter knows the clay. How much pressure it can take. [Music] How many times around the wheel till there's submission to his will. He's planned a beautiful design, [Music] but it'll take some fire and time. [Music] It's going to be okay cuz the potter knows the clay. [Music] Friend, I just came through that fire [Music] not too long ago. Looking back, I can see why [Music] that my God was in control. But on the hardest day I cry, "Oh Lord, isn't it about time?" But the potter knows the claim. How much pressure it can take, how many times around the wheel till their submission to his will. He's planned a beautiful design, but it'll take some fire and time. It's going to be okay. Cuz the potter knows the clay. He's planned a beautiful design, but it'll take some fire and it's going to be okay [Music] cuz the potter knows the clay. [Music] It's going to be okay. Cuz the potter knows the clay. Oh, hallelujah. So grateful for that tonight. Let's all stand. You ready for the word tonight? Amen. And well, if you're the clay like that song said, then tonight I want you to just raise your hands and enter into this next song with me. Sing it like a prayer. It's called Here's My Heart, Lord. Amen. Here's my heart, Lord. Here's my heart, Lord. Here's my heart, Lord. Speak what is true. Speak what is true. Can we sing it again now? Here's my heart, Lord. Oh Jesus. Here's my heart, Lord.

I looked out there before I could even get it said. People were already doing it. Amen. Praise the Lord. We're very um No, no, I want this one. No, I want this one. I want pitch a fit. &gt;&gt; Brother Kenny, let me have that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So, we have um half of Brother Joe tonight. Amen. Sister Becky couldn't make it. So, Brother Joe, you're only going to get half credit, which means you have to come back and do this all over again. Amen. How many would like to have that? Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, uh I I was trying to force him into singing about nine or 10 songs. He said he's going to sing one now and one at the end and maybe lead some worship at the end. Amen. I'm looking forward to it. We haven't had Brother Joe here in a little while. We were looking back there and I was looking at the last note. That was January of 24th. So almost a year and a half ago. That is that is uh that should be unconstitutional. Amen. Praise the Lord. So we're happy to have you here tonight. God bless you. Amen. Happy to have all of you here. Maybe good to see you all the different ones. So we want Brother Joe to come take his liberty. John, I think you're going to have to give up that music box there. And uh we're going to let Brother Joe come and take his liberty. I want him to take his complete liberty tonight. Amen. Praise the Lord. Come on, buddy. Amen. Praise God. [Music] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. Y'all can be seated. All right. Praise the Lord. Yeah, Sister Becky wasn't able to make it. She um she wanted to, but we had the grandbaby and uh she's starting school Friday, so she had to get her back up to mama tomorrow and it's a whole lot of riding tonight and tomorrow, too. So, um she really wanted to be there, but let's see if I can if I can pull some music up here. Let's see. Good to see everybody. &gt;&gt; I see some new faces. I see some familiar faces. And I see some new ones. And I see some I've known for a long time. Brother David, surprised to see you here tonight. Amen. David Cross. Me and him grew up in the pretty much the same church. And then for uh Brother Holmes's and then we went to brother Kenneth up churches for a long time. Amen. Get my glasses out cuz I can't see nothing. Ain't none of y'all else got that kind of problem, do you? Tron G. Well, I thought that I had died and gone to heaven. Lord, I thought I stood outside the eastern gate and a man from within said, "Have you been born again? Is your name written in the book of life? [Music] Please search the book again. [Music] I thought my name was there. I went to church on Sunday, though I never knelt in prayer. Please search the book again. It's too late now, I know. Please search the book again [Music] before you make me go. [Music] Well, I told him all the good deeds I had done. [Music] Lord, I showed him all the trophies I had won. Oh, but then he said to me, "Son, have you been set free? Is your name written in the book of life? Oh, please search the book again." [Music] I thought my name was there. I went to church on Sunday, though I never held in prayer. Please search the book again. It's too late now. I know. They search the book again [Music] before you make me go. And then he turned and left me standing there. Oh, I knew it was too late now for prayer. And so, my sinner friend, if you will in your name must be in that book of life. Oh, please search the book again. I thought my name was there. I went to church on Sunday, though I never knelt in prayer. Please search the book again. It's too late now. I know. Please search the book again [Music] before you make me go. Amen. [Applause] I tell you, I sure don't want no disappointments there. Do you? Sadly, we know that it's got to be. There's going to be many on that day will say, "Lord, Lord, look at what all I did. Look at all the good things I've done. All the good deeds I've done it." Amen. Well, if you have your Bibles, we'll uh if you would stand with me and we'll read. We'll read in the book of Psalms 139. Certainly good to be here tonight. I I told brother Matt it's been a long time since I've seen him three whole days where he come up there to brother Yansies and we were able to go and be in service with them and just had a wonderful time and uh so I wanted to start tonight we're going to read in Psalms 139 and we'll start at verse 17. How precious are also are thy thoughts unto me, oh God. How great is the sum of them. If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand. When I awake, I am still with thee. Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, oh God. Depart from me, therefore, ye bloody men, for they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain. Do not I hate them, oh Lord, that hate thee, and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? I hate them with perfect hatred. I count them mine enemies. Well, I tell you what, he had a lot of enemies, didn't he? A lot of hatred going on. Maybe we'll look at it just a little bit differently when the service is over. Search me, oh God, and know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts. And see if there be any wicked way in me, &gt;&gt; and lead me in the way of everlasting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to look at verse 17. Let's read that one. How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, oh God. How great is the sum of them. In verse 23 it says, "Search me, oh God, and know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts." &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, as we come to you tonight, so thankful for another opportunity, privileged, Lord, to be gathered in the house of God with the precious purchased Lord of your blood. standing here, Lord, we feel so inadequate, but Father, we just come and do all that we can, Lord, for your kingdom. May it be a blessing, oh Father, for somebody. We pray, dear Father, most of all that your Holy Spirit would be here with us, Lord, and take our words, Lord, and put it together in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. You can be seated. So, I wanted to uh start off tonight. Um, I've got I preached this last Sunday morning. So, I know we have some folks listening in and you're going to get a another taste of what we had Sunday morning, but I just felt led to to speak on this. I was um as I started on this subject, it um I think it affects just about all of us. Uh especially in this age that we're living in. Um we we are definitely in a time Thank you, brother. We're definitely in a time of of image obsessed people. &gt;&gt; The name of this uh sermon is narcissism and the very nature of Satan. &gt;&gt; Narcissism, the very nature of Satan. Now, we hear that word a lot and I've heard it growing up coming up and and I always just thought it was somebody that was full of yourself or Thank you, brother. somebody that was just arrogant or maybe they had been spoiled and you know like the rich kid or whatever and and and so we we've all heard of that where he's a he's a self-centered guy. He's he's just full of himself or you know kind of like that but I never really knew what exactly narcissism was and I got to looking into it and and the word it comes from Greek mythology and I'm not going to get into fairy tales but that's where the word comes from. There was supposedly someone named narcissist and and he was in in uh he was cursed to fall in love with himself and he he sat and looked at himself in a pool until he died or something like that or anyway something to that to that degree. Um and and and so that's where they get the word narcissism from as the term of somebody who's just in love with themselves, in love with their own image and so focused on their own image. And um but you know, they actually call it a disorder. They say it's a narcissism uh personality disorder. Uh and and you can put labels on all kinds of things. They call psychopaths, they call uh sociopaths, they've got all kinds of different things. In psychology, I'd like for one psychologist to come up here and tell me they've ever cured anybody. &gt;&gt; They actually ask them on the street. They'll go out there and say, "Hey, you're a psychologist?" "Yeah." "How many people have you cured?" crickets. So, all you hear is crickets. They can't cure anybody. They might can mitigate the the effects of whatever they're going through with drugs or some kind of therapy or something like that. But when it comes down to it, what what they won't admit and they don't even realize it, they don't know it is that what they have diagnosed and it is the premier diagnosis of this day um is, you know, along with depression and loneliness is narcissism. &gt;&gt; And and so um with that being said, it's it's being diagnosed as a psychological disorder, but we know what it really is. It's absolutely a demon possession. It's absolutely. And they'll never admit that because they can't. They don't believe in demons. They don't believe in God or anything else. But we as the church of God realize and recognize what these things are. Now, I'm not up here to to uh enlighten you to the um to the the the the symptoms or the characteristics so that you can go around labeling somebody. Well, you're a narcissist, you're this, you're that. But it's so that we can because I don't have that. I'm not qualified to do that. But we can certainly look at at all of these characteristics and know that every single one of us has some of them from time to time. &gt;&gt; We're all born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come in the world speaking lies. Even as a little baby, as cute as they are, they're all about them. They're all about me. And if you don't give it to them, they're going to let you know. They're going to squall. They're going to cry. They're going to pitch a fit and do everything else because it's about them. Now, we know that's the nature that we're born into. Now, so I do believe it's a spirit and and and one thing that tells you that it's a spirit is because somebody with this personality or who lends themselves or has a tendency to this personality, it will always lead you in the opposite way that God wants you to go. &gt;&gt; All right? So, that is evidence right there. It's certainly of the devil. And we've all come in contact with somebody who has this uh characteristic. Um maybe you work with them, maybe you go to church with them, maybe you've sat under them as a pastor, maybe you've uh uh cult leaders are rife with it. There's a basically that's the that's the recipe to be a cult leader. You must be a narcissist. Amen. So most of them are that way. Um now we all we work with them. You might even have somebody in your family. Maybe you're married to one. Maybe you are one. You don't even realize it. Uh so here we go. Some of the characteristics are self-centered. This is what I got straight from Wikipedia. So y'all take it up with them. So self-centered, thinking only of themselves, ignoring others needs. Sense of entitlement. They they feel they're always right or better than other people and deserve more. Lack of empathy. Don't care about others feelings unless acting like they do will make them look better. manipulative or controlling. Use emotions to manipulate and are extremely jealous in relationships. A strong need of admiration and affirmation. They have to be the center of attention. Can't take negative feedback or criticism. Won't admit when they're wrong. They're easily wounded and often feel wronged by others. Quick to feel hurt or angry. Yeah, &gt;&gt; always the victim, always playing the victim, and it's always uh somebody else's fault. Uh and and and and here's the thing about it. If you ever come in contact with one, and you ever get an apology out of one, be looking for a unicorn somewhere or the Easter Bunny, because it it's not going to be a genuine apology. If it's an apology, it's a it's for a uh it's for a reason. like that would come up and I'd say, "Brother Steve, I I'm sorry I said what I did. I'm sorry I did that. Now wait for it. Three, two, one. But &gt;&gt; if you hadn't have done what you did, I wouldn't have said what I said." So, a lot of times these these apologies are are are just veiled attempts to actually get you told what they really want to do. They want to open up a dialogue. They want to open up this conversation with you because they're going to get the last word. always going to get the last word and and and and and so that that has always been uh one of the ways that they can get in and they'll never Oh my well here here we go. So the first instance in the Bible that we can uh read about uh was in Genesis chapter 4. &gt;&gt; Let's turn to Genesis chapter 4 and we'll look at what true narcissism really looks like. Narcissism manifested in the earth for the first time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Adam uh I'm sorry uh chapter 4, Genesis chapter 4. And Adam knew Eve as wife and she conceived of bear Cain and said, "I have gotten a man from the Lord. All life comes from God." Is that right? &gt;&gt; But he was not of God. &gt;&gt; And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord. And Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering. But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell. Now what does that mean? Now, in today's vernacular, in today's English that we would use, he's like, he got a really bad attitude. He He went from smiling, he went from expecting some great thing, he went from, "I'm going to get this reward to no, you're not." &gt;&gt; And he went from jolly to not jolly. He went from his eyes, he lost a smile, and then his eyes narrowed in wrath and anger. His jaw set, his teeth gritted. That's his countenance fell. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said unto Cain, "Why art thou wroth? And why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?" Wow. Mercy extended even unto this &gt;&gt; fellow mercy. If you do the right thing, &gt;&gt; you'll be accepted, too. &gt;&gt; And if thou doest not well, sin lith at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. And Cain talked with Abel, his brother, jealous, upset, &gt;&gt; mad because his sacrifice wasn't accepted. &gt;&gt; Why are you so great? &gt;&gt; Amen. And Abel, I'm sure he said, 'Well, don't you remember what mom and dad told us about the sin that happened and that after it it it it took place that God himself took a lamb and killed the lamb and clothed mom and dad and and the blood was running down their legs when they left the garden. And and I just believe that it that it had to be blood that it was blood that caused the sin and and it had to be blood that covered the sin. Cain didn't want to hear that. And all he could hear was the blood rushing in his ears because of his anger &gt;&gt; because he had been rejected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and slew him. Now, I want you to look at at the characteristics of this man that with his jealousy and with his anger and and and not being able to to recognize that he was wrong that when God came to him, I'm Elohim, almighty God, Elshadai, Jehovah, Gyra came down and talked to Cain &gt;&gt; and said, "Where is your brother? And he stands there flatfooted and lies right to God's face and says, "I know not." And then he even sasses God and says, "What? Am I his babysitter?" &gt;&gt; See, no accountability. &gt;&gt; Never ex never admitting when you're wrong. &gt;&gt; The very nature of Satan. No accountability at all. and lying right to God's face. &gt;&gt; I looked it up. It said if you ever miss a narcissist from your life, just remember all the things that they would do. Gaslight. They that that means they they turn something twisted around that they actually did and make it sound like you did it. &gt;&gt; Anybody ever had that happen to you before? I didn't say that. You said that. What? I didn't. And then they make you think you're the crazy one. Amen. &gt;&gt; And lying is right there with it. &gt;&gt; It says if you ever miss them, just remember all the good qualities lying and lying and lying &gt;&gt; because they'll all that they don't want to be held accountable for what they do. But they'll always deflect. If it if if something comes their way, they will deflect it every time and never e never accept it or never admit to wrongdoing unless it makes them look better. &gt;&gt; If it makes them look good and say, you know what, I really don't feel like I did anything wrong. But if it gets me where I want to go, if it gets me a little farther up the road, if it if it helps my image, if it makes me look a little bit better, I'll say I'm sorry. I'll say, you know what? I was wrong. I shouldn't have done that. See, that's kind of where they go. But now look, look at what happened. So when God tells him, "What hast thou done?" In verse 10, what has thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood crith unto me from the ground. And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hast opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand. When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto her strength. a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. Oh boy, he took away the very thing that he trusted so much in was the the labor of his hands, the work of his hands, the fruit that he could bring, the produce that he could bring. And God took that away from him. And what did Cain say? I'm so sorry. I should have never killed Abel. I'm sorry, God, that I lied to you. I'm sorry, God. I I if I would have just done what you told me to do, if I would have just done and and and and went back and realized and recognized that it's not the work of my hands that brings salvation, that it's not something I can do or or work my way into heaven, but it has to be a sacrifice. It has to be a blood sacrifice to pay that debt. Yes. &gt;&gt; But not one ounce of regret, &gt;&gt; not one apology, no remorse at all. &gt;&gt; And it's like what brother Matt said the other night at brother Yansy's. He said, "Many people, they're they're sick of what sin has done in their life, &gt;&gt; but they're not sick of the sin itself. &gt;&gt; They're just sad and and upset about, well, my life is in ruins. My life is attached. My wife is leaving me. my my boyfriend left whatever. You're you're upset at what the sin has caused but not at the sin itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That we could ever hate sin. That we could ever hate that thing. &gt;&gt; Hate what God hates and love what God loves. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I want you to look at what Cain said back to God. It wasn't remorse. It was remorse for himself. He was having a pity party. &gt;&gt; Oh, look at me. I look at what you look what's going to happen to me. I I This is what he said. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to condense it down to what really matters to to Cain. &gt;&gt; My I me I I me. &gt;&gt; Let's say it again. My I me I I me. Let's say it like that. And I'm going to read it to you. Like Cain was squalling to God when he got kicked out of the garden or got kicked out of not the garden but in the area that that they were in. And Cain said unto the Lord, I'm going to say it with sniffles. My punishment is greater than I can bear. No thought of what happened to Abel &gt;&gt; laying over there with his brains bashed in. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth, and from thy face shall I be hid, and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth. And it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me, me, me, I, my, me. &gt;&gt; That spirit is an absolute spirit of Satan is what that is. When it's all about you and what you can get, &gt;&gt; that'll destroy your family. &gt;&gt; It'll destroy your friendships. &gt;&gt; You can't have a relationship with anybody. Yes, we can forgive people. We can when they do us wrong, but to have still have a relationship with them. &gt;&gt; Relationship has to be built on trust. &gt;&gt; It has to be built on honesty. &gt;&gt; It has to be built on forgiveness. It has to be built on accountability. And it's not a one-way street. Yes, we are to forgive each other. Absolutely. Don't hold anything against you. But I'm not going to stick my hand in a hornet nest again if I've already done it one time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you stick your hand in a hornet nest and get stung and do it again, well, that's on you. &gt;&gt; And that's some of the relationships that we get back into. &gt;&gt; Thinking that things have changed, thinking that that things are going to be different. It it ain't going to be different just because they come to you with a sad story until you see the fruits of the change. &gt;&gt; And the only way that's going to happen is with an absolute deliverance from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean a I mean a deliverance from God. It has to come that way. And you're saying, "Boy, you're talking to me tonight." Well, praise God. I hope I'm talking to somebody. That's &gt;&gt; cuz if if if you can see yourself in any of this, I I implore you to repent. If there's anything in your life that you are self-centered, that is all about me. It's what I can get. You know what I was listening to this man one time and he was saying? He said, "I want somebody to give me the definition of greed." He said, "There's nothing wrong with making more money. There's nothing wrong with earning this. It's what we all should do." And he was on the radio. And I came up with this little poem and I said, "I tell you what the definition of greed is." I never told him this. I should have sent it to him. But the definition of greed is when your desire to acquire exceeds your need. Now, that's okay. You can have a little bit more than what you need. More than baloney sandwiches. I like to have some shrimp and grits every now and then and a nice home and have have your guests over. But if if your desire to acquire exceeds your need, uh here's the caveat. To the detriment of others &gt;&gt; and the thoughtlessness of others, &gt;&gt; then that indeed is greed. See, that is greed. But because if you're just thinking about me and not thinking of your brother, not thinking of your sister, not thinking about somebody else, then that's a spirit of Cain. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Now, here we go to Isaiah 14. Can we turn there? &gt;&gt; And I want you to see what Cain's daddy said. He didn't fall far from the tree. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 14 13. &gt;&gt; Let's just start with 12 so you kind of get this set the stage here. How art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning? How art thou cut down to the ground which d weaken the nations? For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit upon also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will be like the most high. I'm going to condense that for you. I I my I I I. &gt;&gt; Sounds familiar, don't it? A my I or I guess y'all say around here. I I I I my I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Do y'all need an interpreter? I'm sure we could find one somewhere. Now, Satan has always aspired to this greatness as we see here. &gt;&gt; But you know, Brother Bam, he said he made a statement. He said that the devil is pretty near harmless unless he's got somebody to work through. &gt;&gt; I refuse to be that person. &gt;&gt; Now, we know that when they were going to build the tower of Babel and reach under heaven, didn't he want to get up there? I will exalt myself above the stone. So, that was the devil inspiring them and and and they started in the plane of Shinar. We're going to go all the way up. Boy, they had an aspiration. But you know, God of course stopped put a stop to all that. And and and so Satan has always used man now because men are little creators. God has created man in his image to be a creator to and we create beautiful things in the earth. Now we can't create life. Only God can do that. But I mean there's artwork and there's music and there's there's glorious uh sculptures and architecture, brother Steve, and all kinds of things that that that that is in the world and and so man are little creators, little gods. &gt;&gt; And so Satan to get in that avenue has always tried to find and weasle his ma way in to the human race. And he did it in the Garden of Eden, of course, and he's been doing it ever since. now is going to culminate, we know, with that man of sin who will be revealed one day after the bride is gone. But he will be revealed and that will be Satan's Superman. It'll be Satan living in a human being. Is that right? &gt;&gt; He'll be standing in human flesh. &gt;&gt; It'll be Satan incarnated. &gt;&gt; Now, uh, and this man, he's going to be smart. He's going to be cunning. He's going to be diabolical. And he'll have an olive leaf in one hand while holding a dagger behind his back in the other. That's exactly what Satan Superman will be doing. Amen. And it's just it's just like his father, the devil. Now, we know that this age that that we're in is is absolute perfect bedding ground for this spirit because little by little with the with the fashion and the and the and I just heard an article the other day about how fashion magazines have have uh really uh really set the stage and and uh and they were the fashion and the models became more popular than rock stars. Some of them did. and and and so it it became a a self-absorbed generation. It it's self-absorbed. It's a it's image obsessed. Everybody's obsessed with their image. And and if you don't think that's a Jezebel spirit, just look at what Jezebel did when Joo came to see her. He thought she thought I can use my image and I can use my charm and my ws and I'll get out of this. But it didn't work. Amen. Now, this image of obsessed uh uh age that we live in, uh you can't get on Facebook or any of them is doing this right here and they got the phone and they're making the faces and they're doing the pouty lips and and uh that's the girls, not the guys. You better not be doing that stuff. And and the guys are they're like flexing and trying to wear the tight shirts and show the muscles off and and they want to get in the mirror and all that. It's absolutely image obsessed and you've got to be a 10 out of a 10. And if you ain't a 10 out of a 10, then you use Photoshop or you use whatever some kind of a little filter on there and and you and you poke it out here more and you bring it in here more and you do whatever you've got to do and and and so that's image obsessed. Watch that thing. &gt;&gt; Watch that thing in your life. Don't get caught up with that. &gt;&gt; The devil can use that in your life. He certainly can because then it's all about how I look and I just got to look a certain way. &gt;&gt; Now, this other thing that people do, this uh this this uh characteristic is they resist authority. They they don't want they don't want accountability. They sure don't want authority over telling them anything. Nobody's going to tell me. I heard this the other day that a pastor I had no way I'd call his name, but he said, "Ain't nobody going to correct me but God. Whoa. &gt;&gt; Run, run, Rudolph. Right. You better be running. &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to correct me but God. Oh my. If I ever get that way, brother. No accountability. Lie to be to avoid being seen in a bad light. Now, Proverbs 14:12. You can click on that if you want to. This is a very this is a very uh familiar scripture. Most of us can quote it. But it says that there is a way which seems right to a man, &gt;&gt; but the end thereof are the ways of death. &gt;&gt; And and and so it says in verse 16, "A wise man fearthth and departeth from evil, but the fool rageth and is confident." Right? Now, we we've been keeping up with this little thing that's been going on and and uh and so many of you have heard of Chip and Joanna Gains and they've got this whole network now. They started off taking houses and flipping them and and they would go in and take an old house and refurb it and and then fix it up and resell it and and so it became so popular the show did that she had her own line of products. Now they got their own network and and so they they decided they were going to have a show uh uh showcasing homesteaders and and so they picked a certain uh group of people that they decided I don't know how hard they had to look for them but they picked two gay men homesteaders. I've never heard those two those words in a sentence in my life. two gay men homesteaders and and I don't know how far they had to look to find them, but they found them. And and so they they showcased these people with children. They had went out and adopted them. I ain't no other way to get them for them. So they went out and adopted them. And and so now they've got this whole show with these guys and they're showing them getting out of bed, showing them getting into bed and all kinds of things. And these this uh man and woman Chip and Joanna have they have built their um their uh empire I would say really primarily on conservative people uh women homemakers that that have that have stayed home and and have tried to do and fix up their homes and and you know and so they really kind of have created a little firestorm of following them and people are like you know cancel culture cancel culture it's kind of funny they was hollering oh we hate cancel culture went the other way, but now they don't mind it when it's coming against them. But anyway, so now it's camp, we we got a camp, we got to do it with boycott, blah blah blah. So anyway, all that, but he so they asked the boy the the man, I'm sorry, Chip, um what uh what he thought about it. So instead of backing up and say, you know what, maybe we were a little unthoughtful. Maybe we hurt some people. Maybe we shouldn't have done that or what. No, they doubled down on it. They they didn't they didn't uh get the the memo from Bud Light about doubling down on the stupid idea, but they didn't but they doubled down on it and and and and and so they doubled down on it and he says, "Well, uh judge not lest you be judged." Oh boy, that'll shut him up, won't it? Not really. So then then he says, "Um, well, you know what? I don't ever even pick up I never feel really uh I don't feel like I need to read the Bible." Oh, big shocker there. And then he says, um, you know how I find God? I find God when I'm out working and sweating. Well, you know, let's just stop there for just a minute. You know, Brother Brandham said that's how he sees God when he's out in the wilderness and and the first time he ever saw God was in in nature and things like that. But &gt;&gt; but he didn't he didn't say and that's all you have to do is to know God is just go out in nature and things like that. I believe that you can see God. But you got to understand how they're trying to slant this. &gt;&gt; It's a way that seems right. I don't have to have your version of Christianity is what they're saying. I don't need a Bible written by a bunch of Jews 2,000 years ago to know God. That's what he's saying. I find God in my way. I find him the way that it makes me feel good. It makes me I get out there and I can do it this way and and and you know what? Well, it might give you some peace and it might give you some a little bit of solitude. I don't doubt that at all. Certainly it does. But to say that's all you have to do to find God, I absolutely will argue with him up one side and down another because there's a way that seems right to a man. &gt;&gt; The end there of his death as we saw in Cain. He thought that the way to God was sweating and working too, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; All I got to do is get out there and sweat and work and get these pretty flowers and get all this big produce and 40 pound watermelons and oh, God's going to receive my sacrifice. He's going to think this is beautiful. And you know what? Not a word. &gt;&gt; That pillar fire just moved right over there to Abel's sacrifice. &gt;&gt; I don't care how much work you do. When Jesus said, "Go ye in all the world and preach the gospel." Oh, but by the way, if you come up on any natives that are out there working and sweating, they'll be okay. Just bypass them. &gt;&gt; What lud what what kind of a mentality does that even take? &gt;&gt; All you got to do is just work and sweat to know God. James 4:6 through7 says, "But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. &gt;&gt; Now we know also in Isaiah 35:8 it says, "And a highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it, but it shall be for those the wayfairing men, though fools shall not heir therein." And in John 14 3-6 it says and if I go and Jesus speaking to the disciples and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself and that where I am there ye may be also and wheither I go ye know and the way you know. He's telling them you know where I'm going you know the way. And Thomas says unto him,"Lord, we don't know where you're going. And how and how can we know the way?" And I could just see Jesus smile at him. Jesus saith unto him, "I am the way. &gt;&gt; I'm the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me." Hallelujah. Aren't you glad for that? He is the way. No, it ain't it ain't about any way that you think you want to get out there. And that's what the world thinks. They don't want the the oldtime gospel. What they want is something that's hyped up or some kind of uh show that they want to put on some kind of production and think that God's in it. But let me tell you something. God is only going to meet you at Calvary. He's only going to meet that blood sacrifice and that's it. Nothing else. Not your works, not your trophies, not your music, nothing else. It's only going to be the blood and the blood alone. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know what man wants to do is so different from the King of glory in Philippians 2:18. I want to turn there right fast and I want to I was talking to a man the other day. I've got to I got to hurry here in just a moment. I was talking to a man the other day and he was asking me some questions and he was saying it like you know when people say these things to you and they say this and they say that and I caught it that he was really asking me these questions. He was acting like somebody else had been asking him, but it's kind of like, you know, it's like, yeah, I I got a friend and they got a problem. But here's what here's what it really was. So, Phil, I got to turn find Philippians here. Um, so Philippians 2 1-8. And it says, I don't have to read one through eight. Why don't we read uh verse three? Philippians 2:3. Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory, but in loneliness of mind. Let each esteem other than themselves. Boy, that's the mark that that's the mark of narcissism, ain't it? Absolutely not. That's the opposite of narcissism. When you esteem others better than themselves. I was talking to a brother the other day and and we were talking about this subject and he said, "Brother Joe," he said, he's a pastor and he said, "Brother Joe," he said, "I was just down praying the other morning and he said, "I was thinking about the brothers that go to my church." And he's like, he said, "God," he said, "Why did you call me to pastor these brothers?" He said, "They're much greater than I am. They they they love you, Lord, with all their heart, and I I feel so inadequate, and I I don't feel like I'm even worthy to be their pastor." and and and Lord, why the same thing I've said many times. And he said when I prayed that, Brother Joe, he said a bucket of the Holy Ghost came down upon me. And it was like God was speaking to him and saying, "That's exactly how I want you to feel. &gt;&gt; Don't ever feel like you're the big shot. Don't ever feel like you're the big cheese, but always make yourself little." Amen. Be the little one. God will lift you up every time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Verse five, let this mind be in you, which was which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation. And he was asking me, he said, he said, "How would a God," they asked me these questions, "How would a God allow little children to be murdered or women to be ravished?" And and how would a God allow these things? And and I just stopped there for a minute and I realized that he was asking me this question and he was asking me, you know, you get this question all the time about Christianity and why why do you believe in a God who would allow these things to take place? And I said, well, you know, they had a choice in the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; I said, you have a choice. God, it is not his will that any should perish &gt;&gt; that but that all would have eternal life. I said, "But God knows who will and who won't. But it your will of who you will choose. God has given each one of us free will. He's given you. He's given it to me. He knows who's going to take it, &gt;&gt; but he's still given it to you. We're not puppets. We're not running around and robots. We're not programmed." Amen. But we have free will to choose. And he told Adam and Eve, he put that in the Garden of Eden. That was a choice for them to make. He could have taken the tree away and there'd be no choice. And you know what? There wouldn't be any death. There wouldn't be any children ravaged. There wouldn't be any murders. There wouldn't be any wars. But God made us with a an opportunity to choose the right way or the wrong way. And I said, I said, if you God never forces any man to follow him. He's not going to force you to choose him. He's not going to force you. He will extend a hand to you. He'll send mercy to you, &gt;&gt; but he's not going to force you. And and and and just as Satan is pretty much helpless without somebody to work through, these people have rejected that way. This same self-will that everybody wants that they fuss at God. I don't have a choice. Yes, you do have a choice. Now, here is the repercussions of man's choice. Here are the murders. Here's all the things that are going on. It's the it's the repercussions of the choice that man has has has made. And and and and so he he told me another fellow told me this one time. He said, "Well, you know how?" He said, "I I just try to show the light of God in the world by doing good." I said, "You just answered your own question." I said, "Because you are showing the light of God. They are not." So now they are showing the darkness of Satan through them, but it's their choice, and your choice is is to serve God. So, when they come at you with these with all of these uh these uh questions and and little statements like that, just know they're trying to bait you. They really want to know. They really want to know because the devil has been tempting them. But just come at them with some truth. The reason why because man has chosen to go that way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, we all live in a sin- cursed world and we know that. And I said, "What? What? What kind of a God would stand up and say, oh, bow down or I'm going to slay you right now?" No, he didn't do that. But what he did do is he came down right here in Philippians. It says here, "But he made himself of no reputation." Verse 7, "and took upon him the form of a servant. Washed dirty stinking feet is what he did. He got down and washed stinking feet with manure on it." Brother Ram said that from the trail and the dust and the dirt. Think of it. the Lord of glory, the the the the the God of eternity, Elohim, the allsufficient one, the almighty God, who condescended down and became and and and in the form of a man and a servant and washed the stinking feet of his disciples. Amen. &gt;&gt; And being found in the fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even of the cross. The most humiliating way to die. It was a it was a pagan way to die. The, you know, the the Assyrians, I believe, or the uh the the the Persians invented it. I believe the Phoenetians invented that. The Romans adopted it. And it was a horrible way for a man to die. Amen. I'm so glad that we serve a God that humbled himself. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this. He says, "Oh, be conscious. Here is only one thing to be conscious of your littleness. If you want to get somewhere with God, make yourself real little." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then, make yourself the influence of another. He says, "So then make yourself little. Humble yourself before God. recognize. Don't get all puffed up and blow up. Search the scriptures and see if it's right. He says this on the same message. Always notice a big man humbles himself. The way up is down. Always make yourself little and God will bring you up. He that exalts himself shall be abased, but he that humbles himself shall be exalted. Oh my, I like that. Make yourself little. Always be little. Don't be the big shot. be the little fellow. See, God is the only one among us that's big. Anyhow, I'm going to read two more scriptures and then we'll close. But I want to read, go back to Psalms 139. And when you do that, I want you to go to Romans 7 and hold that place. I'm sorry, Romans 8. Romans 8, but go to Psalm 139 again. And I want you to look at this in a different light. I want you to look at who David's really hating. I was in prayer the other morning when I was reading this and and the Lord just spoke to me and I was like, "Lord, that's me. I'm David. I I I'm I'm experiencing exactly I read Psalm 139, how great he is and how much he knows my downsitting, my uprising, and all that. But then David comes down. He starts talking about all of his enemies. And let me tell you something. You and I have enemies. But I'm gonna tell you who your biggest enemy is. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna tell you in just a minute. I asked Brother Slay one time. He's a precious brother, pastor church, 88 years old, been preaching the gospel way longer than I've been alive. And I asked him, I said, "Brother Slay down in Panama City." I said, I said, "I know you've you've had some some people in your church that's caused trouble, ain't a ain't you?" He said, "Yeah." He said, "I I have." I was trying to get some advice from him when I started pastoring. I said, "What to look for and what to guard against." And I said, 'Boy, I was hoping he'd give me, "Well, I'm going to tell you about this brother one time that did this and this sister that come in and did this." But you know what he told me? He said, "Brother Joe, I'm going to tell you the person that's given me the most trouble my whole life has been the man that walks between these two elbows." I like that. That was the best I had ever heard. That was the best advice I could have ever gotten because let let me tell you something. It ain't always about your external enemies out there. That they're going to come. You're going to have trials. You're going to have problems. But your biggest enemy is you. &gt;&gt; Your biggest enemy is you. That's the old fella that gets up in the morning wants to be pampered. That's the old guy that gets his hurt and feelings hurt all the time. That's the old guy that's all about me me. But that's the true enemy that you've got. David when he's speaking here he says oh he says he says in verse 19 surely thou will slay the wicked let me tell you something when you become a new creation that old man is going to be dead &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; you have died un living under Christ you die to your old self oh I'm praying every day God slay that wicked man that's in me &gt;&gt; for they speak I'm speaking to myself speaks against thee wickedly and thine enemies as me take your name in vain. Do not I hate them? I hate that part of me that does that. Don't you? &gt;&gt; I want to be that man of God that can stand and overcome every battle that comes against me. But I've got an enemy that constantly wars against me day and night, night and day. &gt;&gt; I hate that enemy. Oh, I hate him. Verse 21. Oh Lord, that hate thee, and I'm am I not grieved with those that rise up against me. I hate that part of me that is always coming against God, coming against the right thing, not somebody else out there. That narcissistic spirit was somebody else's fault. That's why I ain't in church. Somebody said something wrong to me. Somebody had an attitude or preacher didn't shake my hand or or I don't like this or I don't like that. Me, me, me. Always about me. Let me tell you something right now. If you ever really get born again of the spirit of God, those little things won't bother you no more. You'll say, "If I'm the only one going there, I'm going to come to church on Wednesday night, whatever night it is, I'm going to be the one raising my hands. I'm going to be the one that's pulling on that preacher as hard as I can pull." &gt;&gt; Cuz it ain't me and Brother Steve. It ain't me and Brother David. Amen. It ain't me and Brother Micah. It's me and the Lord. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. I got enemies that go with me everywhere I go. They ride in the truck with me. They're in the bed with me. They're at the house with me. in the shower with they're wherever I'm at those enemies but I hate them and they hate God and that's the part I want to kill with everything that's in me. &gt;&gt; It hates God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hate them with a perfect hatred. I count them mine enemies. I'm going to prove to you in just a minute who your enemy is. &gt;&gt; Search me, oh God, &gt;&gt; and know what my enemies know. Know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts. Where is the battleground at between God and Satan? Brother Bram said they chose a battleground and that's your mind. &gt;&gt; That's your thoughts. That's when somebody says a little thing and you get huffed up about it. You say, "Oh, if that's the way they feel about I'm not going to talk to them." Oh, that's your thoughts. Slay that enemy. Slay that wicked enemy because it hates you and it hates God and it's going to drive you away from fellowship. It'll drive you away from this church. It'll put a wedge between you and your pastor. It'll put a wedge between you and your wife, between you and your husband, between you and your friends. &gt;&gt; Yes, it will. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's all about me. What they did to me, what so- and so said about me. We've got to slay that enemy. &gt;&gt; And see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way of everlasting. Hallelujah. Oh god, I just want to die. Man was asking me the other day, the same man. He said, "What about baptism? You believe in sprinkling?" I said, "Oh, I had a good opportunity." I said, "Let me tell you something. The Bible tells us in Romans, it says right there where I'm going to, why don't we just read that in Romans 7, let me just see if I can find that. Romans 8. Yeah, let's just read that in Romans 7. But I was talking to him about about being baptized. And Paul said that we are dead to sin &gt;&gt; and we're buried with him in baptism. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Buried with him in baptism. I'm trying to find it. My eyes are all watered up. We're dead to sin. re that uh we should bring forth maybe a sin six anyway. Anyway, but I said we're dead to sin. We're raised to walk in the newness of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and I said what is it? &gt;&gt; Romans 6. &gt;&gt; Romans 6. Amen. So we're we're yeah to raise therefore we're buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in the newness of life. And I said, "Why are we baptized to start with?" And he's like, "To wash away our sins." I said, "No, water don't do that. Water just gets you wet." I said, "What water is is you are fulfilling the covenant that God has made with you and you're obeying what God has said to do &gt;&gt; is to take on his life." And the only way that you can do that is through the baptism in his name. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Not father, son, holy ghost, not Harry, Christian, nobody else, but it's the name of Jesus Christ. And I said I said if you're buried I ain't never seen a dead man out there with a handful of dirt just sprinkled on him to lay out there for buzzards. No, they bury him all the way down. You don't see him. You don't see him anymore. That old man is gone. He's dead and buried. &gt;&gt; And what rises from then on. As Paul said, it's not I that live, but it's Christ that lives within me. Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's well that's the that's how I believe in baptism. He said he asked me if I believed in immersion or sprinkling. I said, "Oh my, I had a good chance to tell him now." But what it says here, you want to know who your enemy is? Verse 5, chapter 8, verse 5. For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Listen, because the carnal mind is enmity against God. It is the enemy of God. That's the wicked man. Amen. &gt;&gt; For it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me read verse 11. But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that rise raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you. Amen. It's going to make you alive. It's going to make you walk different. It's going to make you talk different. Jesus said, "The work, he that believeth in me, the works that I do shall you do also." A lot of folks think, "Well, I can just live any old way I want to live." God knows my heart. God knows I try to do all the the best I I can do. Let me tell you something. Try a little bit harder. You need to surrender everything in your mind, in your life that is an enemy to God. One by if it's just one little pebble at a time. Start speaking to that mountain. If you say to this mountain, as Jesus said, speak to this mountain, whatever that mountain might be in your life, it might be an old bad habit. It might be a big habit. It might be a new habit. It might be whatever kind of habit it might be. But start speaking to that mountain because that mountain's between you and God. But he said, "If you speak to this mountain and believe that it'll move and don't doubt in your heart, you shall have what you ask." Brother Brandham said, the original Bible, what it says in the original text, if you speak under this mountain and believe that it is being done, &gt;&gt; you shall have what you ask. A lot of times it may not be overnight. You say, "Well, I've prayed." Pray again. You You say, "Well, I prayed a month ago." Pray again. Keep praying. Don't stop praying. Don't stop praying. Just keep on praying, &gt;&gt; believing that God's going to take that thing from you. God's going to help you one battle at a time. One is Let me tell you something. When you pick up a sword, you can't swing it, but just this way. And then you come back swinging that way and just one enemy at a time. Just it might and every lick don't always kill the enemy. Sometimes he'll back up a little bit. Whoa, buddy. Then you come back at him again. Whatever it takes, but you just keep fighting with everything that's within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; May the musicians come up. &gt;&gt; You you you you say, "Well, brother Joe, what causes that narcissism?" They don't know. Psychologists don't know. I've read about it. It said, "Well, it's because they spoil children so much and give them everything they want and give them this false sense of exaltation that they're the greatest thing and they go through all their life thinking that they're the greatest thing." But then I read another one that said, "Oh, it's parents who neglect their children." I'm like, well, you can't get no farther apart than that. So, somebody's right and somebody's wrong. What it is, they have no idea. I tell you, it's the devil is who it is. It's Satan. And and I and I don't point fingers at nobody and say, "Well, he's this or she's that or whatever." You just point that finger back at you &gt;&gt; and say, "God, you help me." Now, if you're going through something like that in your life, the the only thing that you can do is ask God to deliver that person. If somebody else is in your life who's like that, just pray. Say, "God, I recognize what that is." Because the way the devil can hide, the only way he can stay there is when he's he's hidden. But once he's exposed and you recognize, is this a personality trait? What is this? Let me tell you something. If it's anything other than what the Bible tells us to be humble like Christ was, if it's anything other than humility, if it's anything other than a forgiving spirit, if it's anything other than a spirit that wants to reconcile, this is the gospel of reconciliation. It ain't the gospel of separation. It ain't the gospel of driving wedges and the gospel of cutting this and cutting that. It's the gospel of reconciliation to be reconciled to one another. That's the spirit that we should have. We don't always ain't there ain't no great preachers and this one and that one and we go, "No, we're we're following after Jesus Christ." What is this message? I heard Charles Stanley say this on the radio like the floored me. I was going down a road about wrecked. He said, "We have missed the message." He's a Baptist church up in uh Baptist preacher. Passed away recently, but he had a church up in Atlanta. Big name. Everybody heard of Charles Stanley. He said, "We've missed the message." I said, "What?" He said, "The message is Jesus Christ." That's what the message is. &gt;&gt; Message is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; This Bible, as much as I love it, it'll never do me any good sitting right there. It'll never do me no good. Those words on there are just ink &gt;&gt; and paper. But there's something so miraculous about it &gt;&gt; that if you read the same word now, it's got to be the right spirit. You've got to read it with the right heart, with the right attitude. And you read this word of God and you say, "Let me tell you, let me give you a little advice. Pray before you even open the Bible." You say, "Well, I've been a Christian a long time. Who cares?" Pray before you open the Bible and say, "God, speak to me." You don't have to start off with some great saliloquy or this great big flowing prayer. Jesus said not to do that stuff. He said, "Don't don't come up with," oh gracious God of eternity. Just speak to him with a honest heart. &gt;&gt; Speak to him. I don't care if it's five minutes in the morning. If it's a minute in the morning, put down that old stinking iPhone for a minute. put it down for a minute and just sit down at the table before you go out to work or before you go to school or wherever you're going to go and just sit down and say, "God, I I need your help today. &gt;&gt; I'm facing enemies, &gt;&gt; mostly in me, &gt;&gt; but the devil's he's on the war path all the time." &gt;&gt; Help me today, Lord. Let me read something in your word. And then open the Bible and read that scripture. Read a chapter. If you feel like reading it, something inspires you, keep on reading. And then when you get done, close the Bible and then pray again and say, "Oh God, thank you for the word I read. Now seal that word to my heart." You be surprised how how what a difference that'll make in your day. You'll be surprised what a change it'll make in your life. It's a little by little. The devil don't come in all of a sudden a lot of times, but it's the little foxes that spoil the vine. It's the little things, but we can do the same thing. It's a little by little. It's a little by little and before you know it, that one minute prayer becomes two minutes. And before you know it, that two minutes might become five minutes. And next thing you know, you might be finding yourself with your hands raised with tears running down your eyes, caught up in the spirit of God, praying, hallelujah, unto God, something inside of you else praying. Something else is now taking over. You're raising up into higher heights. You're going in the deeper depths. You're never going to get anywhere with God if you don't read your Bible and pray. And you say, "That's so simple, Brother Joe. mean you come all the way two hours to tell us that? Yes, I did. I I've come here two-hour drive to tell you to read your Bible and to pray and to seek God to to slay that enemy that's within you. Don't worry about your brother out there. God will take care of him. Amen. Slay that enemy that is within you. Amen. What is that song y'all playing? It sounds awful good. Search me, oh God. How hold on a minute. I love that.

Oh, I don't want to get there on that day, on that great day. You came to church, but did you ever pray? Did you ever consecrate your life? Did you ever say, "Lord, take everything in me that's not like you. I want to hate that thing in me that's against you with a with a hatred, Lord. Oh, search my heart, oh God. See if there be any wicked way found in me. Amen. Now, I got another song here. I'm going to try to play it. We'll try it in G. What What key was y'all in just then?

[Music] If you find anything that shouldn't be, take it out, Lord, and straighten me. I want to be right. I want to be saved. I want to be whole. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen, brother Matt. Thank you, Jesus. God's just looking for somebody that's going to believe him, &gt;&gt; somebody that's going to humble theirel, &gt;&gt; not be puffed up and prideful. It's kind of hard to find nowadays. Even in church, a lot of times that's exactly where the devil fights the hardest. hurt feelings and maybe somebody wants to get promoted into a position. They want to get ahead of God. Satan can use every bit of that &gt;&gt; in the house of God. But I just pray that we can all find find that thing in our life that is keeping us that keeps us from that place that we know that we need to be. find that little thing in there somewhere that's keeping us. We just get rid of that thing. You're always going to have that thing. It's always going to be a struggle, but we can just keep striving. Amen. Every day, pressing onward. Is that right? We've got to press the battle. That's what they told Brother Brandon when he went beyond the curtain of time. Press the battle. Just keep fighting. Amen, brother. Man, come on. God bless y'all. [Music] You appreciate the word of the Lord tonight. Why don't we give the Lord Jesus a hand clap of praise? [Applause] Amen. And renew arise spirit. Why don't we gather to the front as we sing in this? Cast me not away. Sing it. Oh, and cast me not away from thy presence, oh Lord. Raise your hands now. Take not thy holy spirit from me. [Music] Restore unto me. Oh, all the joy salvation. Oh, and renew arise spirit. Well, we want to sing it just before we pray for these needs. Let's sing that again. Cast me not away. Oh Lord, cast me down away from thy presence, oh Lord, [Music] and take not thy holy spirit from me, but restore Oh, [Music] all the joy of thy salvation. Oh, and renew arise spirit within me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you appreciate that? My goodness, brother Joe, that was so wonderful. You know, I love reminded me so much what brother Joe preached in the greatest battle ever fought. He read that quote out of there. Satan ain't a demon spirit's almost harmless unless he has somebody to work through, something to work in. And I say, Lord, don't let it be me. &gt;&gt; Amen. As brother Brandham said, clean out every channel. How many want to do that? &gt;&gt; And he said, what do you do? You take the word of the Lord, the sword of the spirit with a strong hand of faith. You know what I love about that sermon, greatest battle, is brother Brandon flips the entire script of a defensive Christian, you know, hiding from the devil, running from the devil. And he says, "No, that's not what we do. We charge the enemy and we knock him out." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says, "What do you do when a demon spirit comes? You got some spooky spirit," he said, trying to come around you. Don't cower. He said, "Whack him with the word of God." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "If he don't leave, whack him again. And if he don't leave, whack him again. &gt;&gt; And you keep whacking him until you get victory. How many want to be an a soldier? Say, "Lord, I'm not going to back down to the devil. I'm going to take the word and cut the devil's head off." Amen. Whack him again. Whack him until you're free. Amen. Thank you, brother Joe. That was so wonderful. Amen. My goodness. I think that uh there's none of that that that you know, all the traits and all the things as David said, "Lord, search me." If there's any part of that that I could and and friends I'll be honest I'll just say I'll be the first to say there was parts of that I could identify with little things here and there and you know and say boy that's you know can see that in me you know that like brother Brandham said the greatest enemy I have is me William Brandom that was the greatest enemy Martin Luther said I'm not I'm more afraid of the pope in me than any pope in Rome &gt;&gt; more afraid of what what the evil that lays within me than anybody else. Amen. That's my number one enemy. So, we just want to be free. Amen. We have the prayer request here. I just want to read those tonight. Continued prayer for brother David Gadman. Amen. An update from his son-in-law, Brother Harry Lancaster. Brother David Gadman got out of surgery a little before 5:00 p.m. The doctor said that the section of the colon that they removed was very diseased. He was very happy with the with how the two healthier sections reattached. And thankfully, Brother David does not need a um further surgery there, even temporarily. He will be in the hospital at least through Friday and possibly longer depending on how he recovers. Amen. Brother David's been a faithful servant for the Lord, an evangelist. He's blessed our church many times. So, we want to just remember him. Amen. Sister Lord there, the whole family. Sister Amy Demars writes in, "Please pray for brother uh Greg Schwarz from Minnesota." Some may remember him as he helped out the first year of camp. He had surgery today to remove a cancerous tumor in his mouth.

What was talking to him on the phone and and he told me about the surgery that he had and and uh I just had a feeling. And I was telling my wife, I said, "I just wonder, I had a feeling something was going on with him and I didn't know. Why don't we just bow our heads?"

Beautiful song. Amen. We're going to take just time for a testimony or two. You keep playing something for me. Anybody got something? Sister Sarah. Amen. I heard brother John. Let me give this mic back to Sister Sarah. Try that. Nope. Uh, I hope I can get through this without crying. I get a little emotional, but um, Monday morning I had gotten up and I was sitting on the couch and I was praying and um, it just seems like Satan's really been pouring it on us lately. It's just been one thing after another. And so I'm sitting on the couch and I was praying, pouring my heart out to the Lord and I said, "Lord, I can't take anymore. I really can't. I'm trying to be a brave soldier, but I'm I'm getting tired. And I looked out the window and there was a bald eagle sitting across the pond in the grass. It was just sitting there and it was looking right, it looked like it was looking right in the window. And I suspected it was because if I moved any at all, it would kind of its head a little to the side. I sat there and I watched it and it sat there in the grass for probably 10 minutes, maybe. I got several pictures, sent it to some people, and got ready to leave the house cuz I was running late for an appointment and I opened the door and I thought it'll be gone by the time I walk out. I went out there and I stood outside and it just stood there looking at me. Never flinched, never nothing. Just looked at me and I started crying. I felt like the Lord was saying, "I've got you. I see you." And it took its wings a couple of times and it flew across the pond. And as it flew across, another one come in behind it and it flew across the pond. And it almost screeched, a loud screech as it went over my head and went around into a tree. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it just meant so much to me. I just stood there and cried. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I know God sees me and I thank him for that because it just meant so much to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad the Lord can speak like that even in nature? Brother John, &gt;&gt; I want to thank the Lord for touching Elliot and he got a little a virus and the Lord's touched him and he's still on his way out, you know, a little fussy, but I really wanted to testify and thank God. You know, Brother Daryl was here. I forget how long it's been. A long time ago when I was talking about claiming your healing and at the time I was wearing glasses uh and I had just gotten really frustrated at work because I was working and trying to work and I had a stig a stigmatism and trying to work and I was in the shower and the glasses were clouding up. I was like I can't do this anymore. And I just took them and smashed them. I was like I can't do that. I can't wear glasses. And they had they had already told me um I had tried contacts. They flared my eyes up and she tried several different ones. Some of them wouldn't rotate. And that weekend I said I'm claiming my healing and I'm still claiming it and I expect to see it and I'm thanking God and I haven't forgotten and I'm not giving up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Memo. Pass that back to my memo. This uh this is from my neighbor. She told me to thank the church for praying for her last Wednesday night. Uh her name is Ruth. She had bronchitis. First time in her life. Very very very sick. And so I I was talking to her Thursday and she said, "You know, I really feel better today." I said, "We prayed for you last night." She said to tell the church, "Thank you." Amen. So, &gt;&gt; thank the Lord. &gt;&gt; I just had to tell y'all. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad for what the Lord's doing?
