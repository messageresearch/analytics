========================================

look into history and you will find that the truly great were those who served others history can never acclaim those for whom much was done but it will forever praise those who did much for others now let us apply that to ourselves even as the son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister we are to follow that example see him and he bows himself over the feet of the apostles washes their tired and dirty feet he said you don't know what i am doing but you will know hereafter you will see what i'm doing you ought to also do it he became a servant in order that god could elevate him to the hell the highest height and one day in the judgment of the saints we are going to hear him say well done good and faithful servant enter into the joy of the lord and this is what spoke to me it is it is hard to be a servant but those who spend and are spent for others will one day see be seated with him in his throne and it'll all be worth it then amen let us labor for the master brother branham always breaks out into song let us labor for the master from dawn till setting sun ah when all life is over all our work on earth is done when the role is called a beyond or i'll be there amen a diligent believer stays diligent in his passion for christ even when something that we may pray for doesn't happen right away or maybe we have something that the lord we need deliverance of uh you know remember abraham still diligent in his walk but had to wait 25 years for the promise to manifest amen how many can say that they've waited 25 years for something anybody amen it's it's a tough thing to be a servant waiting that but it's patience that's one of the that's one of the things that it's talked about in this verse amen for this for the sake of time i want to um just skip a little bit forward second peter um we'll go to verse we'll look at verse eight and i'm going to read a dif another another uh version you can pull it up if you want but the the christian standard bible for if these qualities are yours and are increasing they will keep you from being useless or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ and the person who lacks these things is blind and short-sighted and has forgotten the cleansing from his past sins amen i don't want to forget the cleansing from my past sins i don't want to forget what the lord's done for me and i want to be i want to be useful and i want to be fruitful in the knowledge that he's given us in this scripture in the message you know we've been given a grand privilege of being a part of the bride of jesus christ to know the mysteries that we do and i don't want to just be useful in our as second peter says useful or unfruitful in my knowledge i want to take it forth and do a diligent service for the lord amen says in the uh therefore brothers make every effort to confirm your calling and election because and this is what pastor was talking about because if you do these things you will never stumble it doesn't say if you wish these things could be done for you or if it says if you do these things you will never stumble i don't ever want to stumble i do stumble we all stumble but i don't want to amen so we need to actively be diligent in our service to the king amen i want to take a look at the verse 10 in the amplified bible it says therefore believers be all the more diligent to be to make certain and his uh about his calling and choosing you to be sure that your behavior reflects and confirms your relationship with god wow be sure that your your behavior reflects and confirms your relationship with god for by doing these things actively developing these these features these virtues actively developing them you will never stumble in your spiritual growth and will live a life that leads others away from sin while you mean that if i follow these and i diligently seek after them not only will it be good for me but it will be good for people around me wow amen what a responsibility that is in the scriptures amen we have a grand responsibility and it's an active process now i want to take a look at um what what the king james version calls the model the model servant uh in genesis 24 we look at um we look at we're back in abraham's time and abraham gave his servant an incredible task his the task that he gave him was to leave the land of canaan that they were that they were currently residing in and go into the land of his fathers of his lineage and to find a wife for his son isaac now a few things i noticed while reading this chapter that i just thought was beautiful that abraham i'm just going to paraphrase some things just for sake of time but abraham entrusts his servants with all his goods and position all his goods and possessions to give a gift for his future wife and it says that he took 10 camels in verse 10 of chapter 24 in genesis and he took 10 camels of his master and departed for all it says for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went into mesopotamia and unto the city of nehor abraham entrusts his servant with all those things the servant was trusted with the possessions of his master and started out on what was to look like a very strenuous journey i did some uh did some digging and found that the journey from where he was at to where he had to go was over 700 miles it says that it was around between five and nine hundred miles now if you were to walk they didn't have cars back in those days so they had to walk and use camels which camels were not very quick so they had to it would take them a minimum of 21 days so it took his servant it took eliezer we know that it we know that from earlier scriptures that this his name is eliezer it took him 21 days to get to this place to go and find a wife and he couldn't take isaac with him abraham says isaac can't leave this land he said i need you to go and find a bride and this is this is really a beautiful type that brother branham gets into but we're not we're not going to go there today but talk about laboring for your master earlier i mentioned i just want to interject something earlier i mentioned that we are friends of god and just as john 15 14 says but your friends if you read that whole scripture it says ye are my friends if you do whatsoever i command you so obedience is absolutely necessary in servanthood amen and not just obedience but ephesians 6 6 says to be obedience with singleness of heart as unto christ meaning he is not christ is not just a fraction of what we serve he's not just we don't just serve him sometimes or we he is holy who we serve amen the servant of abraham had but one task in mind and that was to do the will of his master he praised the prayer of his faith for his for his master's request in genesis 24 12-14 he says oh lord god my master uh or lord god of my master abraham i pray thee that will show me that you would show me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham and behold i stand here by the well of water the daughters of the men of the city came out to draw water and it came to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy picture i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thee camels drink also let the same be that she has anointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou has shewed kindness unto my master and before he's even done praying but it says that before he even had done speaking that behold rebecca came out just to go go forward in the story a little bit he asked rebecca who her family is he his prayer was answered and he asked rebecca who her family was and he finds out that it was exactly who he needed it to be and so he gave her a portion of his master's possessions and asked if he could go meet her family he was invited into the home of the family and offered food after his long journey but he refuses to sit down and eat because he had singleness of heart in mind his master's task amen he had singleness in his heart the singleness of his master's task a few things i noticed while reading this spurgeon writes the phrase my master is the refrain of this chapter the word master occurs 22 times eliezer did not aspire to any independence of abraham or of abraham's son his thoughts were of his master his words were in praise of his master his deeds on behalf of his master he was not his own but the bond servant of another and this is also our position we say that his name was eliezer his name was not spoken one time in the chapter there is not one thing spoken about the the servant in this chapter the servant was all in regards in singleness of heart to do and fulfill the master's task and many times we can say you know and i say we me and one finger at you three pointed back at me we can get so caught up in what we need from the lord but we need to get back to seeing what he needs from us as his servants especially as his saints now especially as we see the time so approaching let us let us labor for the master now while we still can amen peter says at the end of this chapter in second peter 1 12-14 it says therefore i will always be ready to remind you of these things even though you already know them and have been established in the truth which is present with you i think it right as long as i am in this earthly tent to inspire you by reminding you peter's saying this because he knows that who he's talking to knows that these things need to be done i'm speaking this to you i we know we know these truths we know we need to be diligent but as long as as long as we're here we need to be reminded that we have to be diligent not only to listen to these truths but to apply them as peter says oh so diligently in steady and earnest energetic effort as faithful as a servant and even more than a servant a slave once so captivated by sin like we were talking earlier one so captivated by sin and so diligent to serve unrighteousness and unholiness let us now be all the more diligent to serve holiness and righteousness and our master amen let's just stand to our feet god is faithful to the faithful amen let's just bow our hearts heavenly father lord we thank you for the reading of your word today lord jesus we thank you for the teaching father we pray that we can just take this and lord have singleness in our hearts to know that you are our master lord and that we just need to be diligent in service to you father put these things in remembrance in our hearts lord god and help us today lord as we go forward i pray for this service i pray over the ministry of your word i pray that it can just lord just speak to us and use your servant today father god to just minister to our hearts father be with the musicians and the song leader and the lord the congregation lord led us just to be able to glean from the word today father we dedicate our hearts and our lives to you today for the service of the
