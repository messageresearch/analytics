[1:49] [Music]
[2:20] good morning everyone god bless you
[2:22] let's stand and pray
[2:26] gracious father we come before you and
[2:28] we want to dedicate this time to you
[2:30] lord and
[2:31] ask that your holy spirit would come and
[2:33] move amongst us
[2:35] and speak to us this morning lord
[2:37] we ask that your name would be lifted up
[2:39] and be glorified help us to
[2:42] step out of the way and let your
[2:44] spirit have full
[2:46] control and access to our hearts we ask
[2:48] these things
[2:49] in jesus name amen
[2:52] let's
[2:53] continue on our subject from last month
[2:56] pride in his prisoners
[2:59] proverbs 16 5 is the scripture i want to
[3:02] open with everyone
[3:04] that is proud in heart is an abomination
[3:06] to the lord
[3:08] though hand joined in hand he shall not
[3:10] be unpunished amen can be seated
[3:17] if you're listening in brother brad the
[3:18] monitor is a little hot if you could
[3:20] turn it down just a bit
[3:24] so
[3:26] it's a
[3:27] there's a there's a certain amount of
[3:29] things in the bible that
[3:31] are an abomination
[3:32] to the lord it's it's something it
[3:35] speaks of something that he he detests
[3:38] he hates
[3:39] he despises and if you look
[3:42] all through scripture
[3:43] as we did the last time i spoke on it is
[3:46] you see over and over again that god
[3:49] treats the proud as an enemy
[3:52] and and
[3:53] you know we can we can look at this in
[3:55] in two ways right
[3:57] so on on the one hand all of us we're
[4:01] christians
[4:02] we're born again of the spirit of god
[4:05] and yet we can still
[4:08] battle against and struggle with
[4:10] pride
[4:11] so it's god is working a process i think
[4:14] i preached on humility quite a while ago
[4:16] and i talked about a thermometer
[4:19] and how
[4:20] as the thermometer goes up you know the
[4:22] mercury gets goes up in it and that's
[4:25] pride that's more of you that's self
[4:28] the level of self is being measured so
[4:31] the more self there is the more pride
[4:32] there is the less self there is the more
[4:35] humility more emptying out and the more
[4:37] humility there is
[4:39] and so when you
[4:40] when you look at
[4:42] this
[4:43] in the perspective of we're christians
[4:45] oh i'm a christian i've humbled myself
[4:47] to believe in god
[4:48] well that's good that's that's because
[4:50] there's people that don't even humble
[4:52] themselves to even believe in god i've
[4:55] humbled myself that i've repented i've
[4:56] humbled myself
[4:58] that i've
[5:00] turned away from my denominational
[5:02] thinking and i've accepted the message
[5:04] that's wonderful
[5:05] but we can still be in in our personal
[5:08] lives
[5:09] struggle with and be even captives to
[5:12] pride
[5:13] it doesn't mean that you're possessed by
[5:15] the devil
[5:16] it means the devil is oppressing you
[5:18] from the outside and bringing
[5:21] circumstances and conditions in your
[5:23] life that you're falling victim to
[5:26] the attacks of the enemy
[5:28] and giving way to self
[5:31] and so that's the process god is taking
[5:33] us through a process in our christian
[5:35] walk to humble us
[5:38] that's that's one key feature if you
[5:40] realize if god is working in your life
[5:43] he is going to work to humble you
[5:46] and if you don't see that he's working
[5:49] in your life to humble you it should
[5:51] cause a great deal of concern
[5:54] and and worry you know i'd say we're not
[5:57] supposed to worry there's only
[5:59] really for me one thing
[6:01] maybe two things i worry about and that
[6:03] i feel like that's okay
[6:05] one is am i in the middle of the god's
[6:08] will yeah
[6:10] that's that's my main concern am i doing
[6:12] the will of the lord or am i going on
[6:14] doing his will doing and trying to do
[6:16] him a service without it being his will
[6:18] and secondly the thing that i'm worried
[6:20] about is is i'm am i getting full
[6:23] of myself
[6:25] am i getting is my head puffing up that
[6:28] those are the things that make me worry
[6:30] that keep me awake at night
[6:32] i mean there's other things too but
[6:34] those are the main things that i feel
[6:35] like should keep me awake at night and
[6:38] that are okay
[6:39] to be very deeply
[6:42] sincerely concerned about
[6:44] and so
[6:46] don't don't grab these scriptures and
[6:48] just say well that's for the unbelievers
[6:49] because god resists the proud
[6:52] that's a scripture that i have further
[6:54] ahead but i'm just going to bring it
[6:55] right now and i'll go back
[6:58] this is from the west
[6:59] expanded translation james 4 6 moreover
[7:02] he gives greater grace for this reason
[7:05] he says
[7:06] god sets himself in battle array
[7:10] against the arrogant and haughty but
[7:12] gives grace to the humble and
[7:15] lowly
[7:18] so god sets himself in battle array you
[7:20] say i'm a christian god will never set
[7:22] himself in battle array against me
[7:24] are you sure
[7:27] are you sure
[7:28] god has two purposes if he's setting
[7:30] himself in battle array against
[7:32] someone who is
[7:34] condemned
[7:36] that's that's his wrath
[7:38] right
[7:39] when god sets himself in battle array
[7:41] against you christian who's full of
[7:43] pride
[7:44] it's in order to
[7:46] perfect you
[7:47] and grow you
[7:49] but i still don't want that
[7:52] i don't want god to be actively working
[7:55] against me but his working against me is
[7:57] really for me okay you understand what
[8:00] i'm saying
[8:01] i want to be
[8:02] blessable i want to be in a position and
[8:04] a condition
[8:05] where he can say i can flow through you
[8:07] i can work through you i can entrust you
[8:10] with more responsibility that's the
[8:13] position i want to be in i don't want to
[8:14] be in the position where god's saying
[8:16] look i'm going to i'm going to ruin your
[8:18] life
[8:20] i'm going to destroy your life but i am
[8:22] not going to let you continue with poor
[8:24] character and pride
[8:27] and he'll humble us
[8:29] he will take out his sword
[8:32] and he will humble us and it won't be
[8:34] fun and it won't be pretty but if you're
[8:36] a child of god
[8:38] he will accomplish it
[8:41] that's that's his love you think god's
[8:43] going to be defeated by your pride
[8:49] no
[8:50] no he's not
[8:54] but we should have a healthy
[8:57] understanding of how wicked and evil
[8:59] pride is
[9:02] we
[9:03] too often we pet it
[9:05] we baby it we turn it into our our
[9:08] favored friend
[9:11] and we encourage it
[9:13] and we do all the things that we should
[9:14] not do
[9:16] and someone speaks against us and what's
[9:18] the very first thing is we think of
[9:20] ourselves
[9:22] to me
[9:23] pride
[9:24] is the greatest
[9:26] vice
[9:27] that leads to every other sin
[9:29] pride made the devil the devil
[9:32] humility
[9:33] is the root and the foundation of all
[9:37] godliness
[9:39] and so
[9:40] you know if you get if you have a get a
[9:43] catch a revelation of those two things
[9:45] and then can honestly
[9:48] observe your own life you're you're
[9:50] going to go great places with god
[9:54] because
[9:56] we'll be challenged god will put
[9:58] circumstances that will challenge
[10:00] this
[10:02] i started studying it and god started
[10:04] putting lots of
[10:05] circumstances of challenging
[10:08] the pride that was still in me
[10:10] and
[10:11] he sufficiently humbled me over and over
[10:13] again
[10:14] and things that things that broke my
[10:16] heart but that's good
[10:20] that's good it needed to be broken so
[10:22] that god could build it the right way
[10:26] so
[10:28] let me go back
[10:32] brother branham in the sermon pride said
[10:34] oh
[10:35] pride's such a cursed thing
[10:38] so awful so evil is pride
[10:42] it's an astounding statement it is it
[10:44] that's exactly what made satan
[10:47] rebel in the beginning that's what
[10:49] exactly what will
[10:51] prevent us from our growth in christ
[10:57] um
[10:58] let me get this my eyes don't work as
[11:00] good as they used to for that in the
[11:02] back i'm going to read this one
[11:06] satan knows the will of god this is from
[11:08] god's power to transform 1965 satan
[11:11] knows the will of god yes
[11:13] but just refuses to do it
[11:17] sometimes we're in that condition
[11:20] we know what the right thing is
[11:22] but we enjoy
[11:23] the wrong thing so much
[11:26] that we continue doing the wrong thing
[11:29] and it god comes against us god strikes
[11:32] against us
[11:33] notice he had seen god vindicate abel's
[11:35] message now i want you to think
[11:37] use your thinking man's filter now
[11:39] for a minute abel's correct message that
[11:42] god vindicated to be the truth are you
[11:43] drawing now uh-huh
[11:45] abel's message had been received and
[11:47] cain saw it
[11:49] and knowed that god had vindicated that
[11:51] message right but he just couldn't do it
[11:53] his pride kept him from it
[11:55] that's right his pride kept him from
[11:57] doing it he's seen god vindicate the
[11:59] message so it seems to be now
[12:02] so hard for people to humble themselves
[12:04] to the word of god
[12:05] they just don't want to do it they'll
[12:07] humble themselves to the creed of the
[12:08] church sure
[12:10] but not to the word of god
[12:14] what a danger
[12:16] and don't don't shovel that on to
[12:18] denominational people
[12:20] because you see that well i don't hold
[12:22] to the creeds
[12:23] i'm not holding decreeds well we can
[12:25] turn the message into a creed
[12:30] we can we can turn it into a tradition
[12:32] we can turn it into something that
[12:34] that
[12:35] though it has life in it for us it
[12:38] doesn't because we have we have taken
[12:40] the power of god out of it
[12:43] and and so we want to keep going here
[12:47] and god doesn't call man to judgment
[12:50] without first warning him now we find
[12:52] out that our proud
[12:54] america is not going to escape the wrath
[12:57] of god
[12:58] as i spoke one day
[13:00] since i've been here i'm sure it was
[13:02] here of everything at the end
[13:05] you know i can't see nothing to build to
[13:08] you can't build the can't build the
[13:10] politics it's gone
[13:12] you can't build the social life because
[13:14] it's so demoralized
[13:15] there's nothing that you can build to
[13:17] here to to there
[13:19] and you can't put no hopes in nothing
[13:22] how about the church
[13:23] well you can't do nothing with the
[13:25] church it's so formal and gone
[13:27] there's nothing left
[13:29] they've done sold out their birthrights
[13:30] for a mess of pottage
[13:32] and they're just waiting judgment the
[13:34] holy spirit has crossed this nation
[13:35] showing his signs and wonders and they
[13:37] continually spurn his grace he
[13:40] vindicates himself and proves by his
[13:42] great of indication that he's the word
[13:45] of god manifested in this day and they
[13:47] still turn it down see there's nothing
[13:49] left now you just can't always do that
[13:52] to god see
[13:54] wow
[13:56] so
[13:57] you know
[13:58] to give a
[13:59] broader commentary on our world today is
[14:01] you look at
[14:02] you look at
[14:04] christian television let's put it that
[14:06] way
[14:07] you look at christian television
[14:09] how much time they spend talking about
[14:12] politics
[14:14] i i believe in speaking against evil
[14:18] 100 percent
[14:20] but
[14:21] it's all the time politics and this
[14:24] politician and
[14:26] trump this and biden this and it's
[14:28] it's what are they dressed what are they
[14:30] dressing themselves in
[14:32] what are they robbing themselves in well
[14:34] the prophet had a vision
[14:35] what are they what did they dress them
[14:37] themselves in newspapers
[14:39] current events
[14:40] politics
[14:42] that's what they that's the dress that
[14:43] they were dressed in it wasn't the word
[14:45] it was it was
[14:49] politics
[14:50] shameful
[14:51] and so many times we as message
[14:54] believers can get caught up because we
[14:56] appreciate our country
[14:58] we're thankful for our country and yet
[15:00] we don't understand the evil that it
[15:03] plays in the world okay you get so proud
[15:05] of yourselves i remember going back and
[15:07] forth with iranians about their country
[15:09] and my country and they said well
[15:11] your country is the second beast in
[15:14] revelation 13.
[15:16] so i'm not sure why you're so proud of
[15:18] it
[15:19] and i was humbled
[15:21] i wasn't proud of it anymore i was like
[15:24] that's
[15:24] correct and
[15:27] i have to be careful because i want to
[15:28] go down a whole
[15:30] tirade
[15:31] but my point being is the church has
[15:33] sold itself to politics
[15:36] and that's what they that's what they
[15:38] want to change and that's what they want
[15:39] to transform they don't they they sort
[15:41] of have an idea that they want to
[15:42] transform people's lives but the main
[15:45] focus
[15:46] is politics
[15:48] and it's shameful and it's it's shows
[15:50] why they're clothed in the prophet's
[15:52] vision with a newspaper
[15:55] in
[15:56] god revealing himself to his people says
[15:59] our heavenly father
[16:01] by your spirit look down through the
[16:02] stream of time oh you're here dear jesus
[16:05] you're so lovely and kind and we love
[16:07] you with all of our heart and our sister
[16:09] standing here has been bound by an
[16:11] oppression of satan
[16:13] foul spirits have tried to put pride
[16:15] upon her but thou art here to remove
[16:17] this curse of the enemy for you said
[16:20] the last words from your sacred lips as
[16:23] you were leaving the world you said
[16:25] these signs shall follow them that
[16:27] believe in my name they shall cast out
[16:29] devils
[16:30] help me dear god
[16:31] this duel of faith against the enemy
[16:35] so
[16:36] incredible
[16:37] incredible identifying what is behind
[16:40] pride
[16:41] so
[16:42] like i said at the very beginning
[16:44] i don't believe a born-again christian
[16:46] and i don't think we can scripturally
[16:47] prove that born-again christian would
[16:49] ever be possessed
[16:51] by an evil spirit of pride but for
[16:54] certain can be oppressed
[16:56] by an evil spirit of pride and even put
[16:59] put under chains in their christian walk
[17:02] by that spirit of pride
[17:04] you become a prisoner to it
[17:07] so we read that scripture god this is
[17:10] god's attitude this is god's heart
[17:12] against pride
[17:14] he sets himself in battle array and you
[17:16] can read all through if you do a search
[17:18] in your bible search about pride you can
[17:20] read through
[17:21] the whole old testament and over and
[17:23] over and over again it shows god makes
[17:26] himself an enemy against pride
[17:33] brother branham says and we would see
[17:35] jesus
[17:36] he come stomping up there with his chest
[17:38] out and throated out you're all from
[17:40] probably familiar with the story and
[17:41] even made fun of them and everything but
[17:43] when he did
[17:44] he found out it didn't go so good so he
[17:46] found out he was wrong he closed up his
[17:48] books and walked down with his shoulders
[17:50] down humbly walking down there was old
[17:52] sate sitting over in the corner punched
[17:54] the one next to him said if he would
[17:56] have went up the way he came down he
[17:58] he'd come down the way he went up so
[18:01] that's about right
[18:04] that's key
[18:05] we hear that story oh it's funny that's
[18:07] nice let's move on
[18:09] but i want i want to linger
[18:12] on that because it's it's a whole
[18:15] attitude it's a whole mindset
[18:18] that we have as christians
[18:20] what in the world why would you why
[18:22] would you come up to a pulpit thinking
[18:24] oh i'm so intelligent and i can get this
[18:26] across to the people it when we know
[18:28] scripturally speaking it's not
[18:30] intelligence that changes people's lives
[18:33] usually intelligence puts them further
[18:35] away from god
[18:37] not that we're against education not
[18:39] that we're against knowledge the bible
[18:41] spends a lot of time
[18:42] speaking about true
[18:44] understanding revealed
[18:46] truth
[18:47] coming to our minds and changing our
[18:50] lives but mere knowledge
[18:53] puffs up
[18:54] that's what scripture says but love
[18:56] edifies if if if the disposition of that
[18:59] man's heart was right from the beginning
[19:02] it would have been love and thinking
[19:04] this people needs to be fed how could i
[19:07] do that
[19:08] how am i sufficient for that
[19:11] the only hope i have is if i get
[19:14] this guy out of the way
[19:16] so
[19:17] that one can speak through me to the
[19:19] people and feed their hearts
[19:21] that's humility
[19:24] you know
[19:26] it's crazy what we think sometimes
[19:30] it's crazy how we get going in our minds
[19:32] and we get on a little tangent and
[19:35] my goodness then out you open your mouth
[19:37] and express it to somebody and you think
[19:42] what what's going on inside of me
[19:46] you know but
[19:47] thank the lord we have
[19:50] good people in our lives that we can
[19:51] talk to and
[19:53] hopefully they can
[19:54] metaphorically slap us upside the head
[19:59] metaphorically i said
[20:04] but we need each other as the body of
[20:07] christ in love
[20:08] say brother sister i was confused by
[20:11] what you said
[20:12] it's so
[20:13] it's so easy
[20:15] for a guy from minnesota to want to
[20:19] stuff stuff whatever has happened and
[20:21] not confronted anything
[20:23] not confront issues
[20:24] that's just our style for minnesota
[20:26] that's not the christian style
[20:28] it's not the christian culture if we're
[20:30] confused if we have a misunderstanding
[20:33] pick up the phone
[20:35] don't text pick up the phone
[20:39] texting usually continues the
[20:41] misunderstanding just talk to people
[20:43] invite them to your house say i was
[20:45] confused about this thing you said or
[20:47] you know how many times that usually
[20:49] draws people's hearts closer together
[20:51] well the devil's trying to prevent that
[20:53] in the first place
[20:54] so when you when something comes in your
[20:56] mind just pick up the phone and say hey
[20:58] you said this what were you meaning by
[21:00] that
[21:02] and then let them talk and then say then
[21:04] usually you say oh you were meaning
[21:06] something very different than what i
[21:07] thought
[21:09] but what what prevents us
[21:11] from doing that
[21:13] pride
[21:14] we think we know
[21:16] sometimes we do sometimes we have a
[21:18] spirit of discernment and we we do know
[21:21] but many times it's not that
[21:26] um man my eyes are bad i need to go get
[21:29] glasses amy
[21:31] i can't i can't see that back there
[21:33] and then if i go away from this i don't
[21:35] have a mic on so i'm just gonna
[21:37] turn this way and hopefully you can hear
[21:38] me
[21:39] oh i read that one
[21:42] likewise first peter five five likewise
[21:44] you younger submit yourselves unto the
[21:46] elder
[21:48] yay all of you be subject one to another
[21:51] yay all of you be subject to one another
[21:55] is there any exceptions to that
[21:58] and i'll ask for everybody in the in the
[22:00] body of christ what is it it's
[22:02] submitting to the leadership of the holy
[22:05] spirit it's submitting to the gifts that
[22:07] god places in the body
[22:09] that he works through
[22:12] and be clothed with humility
[22:17] to be clothed with means to become that
[22:20] you can be you can clothe yourself with
[22:23] pride
[22:24] or you can clothe yourself
[22:26] with humility
[22:28] you know this the
[22:30] i i forget which
[22:32] scripture it is but
[22:34] paul writes put on the put ye on the
[22:37] lord jesus christ and make no provision
[22:41] for the flesh in other words yours to
[22:43] become what you put on
[22:46] so be clothed with humility you're
[22:47] supposed to become
[22:49] humility
[22:51] four again
[22:53] quoting the same scripture as james for
[22:55] god resists the proud
[22:58] and gives grace to the humble
[23:01] second peter 2 3
[23:04] and through covetousness shall they
[23:06] with feigned words make merchandise of
[23:09] you whose judgment now
[23:11] of a long time lingers not and their
[23:13] damnation
[23:15] slumbers not amen
[23:19] so we see this
[23:22] pride sometimes come out
[23:25] even in the ministry
[23:27] even in in in preachers
[23:30] and that's what peter is talking about
[23:32] here and through covetousness shall they
[23:34] with feigned words feigned
[23:36] means fictitious
[23:38] words in other words lies
[23:42] what happens in our in our world today
[23:44] that
[23:46] preachers will do they'll
[23:48] they'll tell you
[23:49] lies
[23:51] a either to
[23:53] comfort you
[23:55] and control you
[23:56] or
[23:58] b
[23:59] they will try to use the preaching of
[24:02] the word
[24:03] to bring a manipulation upon people's
[24:06] lives
[24:07] or or
[24:09] you know you've seen it where preachers
[24:10] will just start calling people's names
[24:11] over the pulpit so and so did this and
[24:14] this this guy has got tv in his house
[24:16] and that guy's i've seen him over at
[24:18] such and such a place and they think
[24:20] that's the anointing of the lord they're
[24:21] just trying to control people
[24:25] through fictitious words
[24:27] what do they do they make merchandise of
[24:30] you what is merchandise it's a it is
[24:35] it's a product
[24:36] you're actually it's saying that
[24:38] the preacher is turning you into a
[24:40] product
[24:41] a commodity
[24:44] to use to trade what do you use a
[24:47] commodity for you sell it
[24:49] in order to gain
[24:51] a profit
[24:52] so what do what will preachers do in
[24:54] order to make sure they're still getting
[24:57] ties and offerings they're just using
[24:59] people as commodities
[25:01] their their purpose isn't to help them
[25:02] grow they help them increase in their
[25:05] faith but their purpose is to
[25:09] have a job
[25:12] and
[25:12] you know this you can take this in a in
[25:14] a in a big denominational sense but you
[25:17] can take this
[25:18] in the horrifying experiences people
[25:20] have had
[25:22] um around the message
[25:26] in
[25:28] preachers that were never called to do
[25:30] what they they were doing
[25:32] and they were just bringing
[25:34] damage to people's lives
[25:37] but the preaching of the word is not to
[25:39] control your behavior
[25:42] right
[25:43] it's not to speak in such a way to draw
[25:46] just the right crowd and the right
[25:48] people and to get sponsored and
[25:51] supported by them
[25:53] the purpose of preaching is to transform
[25:55] lives
[25:57] by the power of god from the inside out
[26:00] it's not to control from the outside
[26:02] it's to give you something that changes
[26:04] your life that causes you to grow
[26:07] that's the fruit that's supposed to
[26:08] follow ministry
[26:10] growth stability strengthening
[26:14] learning more how to follow the
[26:15] leadership of the holy spirit growing in
[26:17] a greater revelation of the word having
[26:20] a
[26:20] deep roots of foundation
[26:23] where the power of god is living
[26:25] continuously
[26:27] in your life that's the purpose of
[26:28] ministry that's the purpose of preaching
[26:30] it's not for money
[26:32] it's not for power it's not for fame
[26:35] i think sometimes even preachers in the
[26:37] message they start getting proud of
[26:39] themselves i've it's blown me away
[26:41] sometimes you know you come from a
[26:43] denominational background you go to a
[26:44] church that has twenty thousand people
[26:46] and then somebody's like there oh
[26:47] there's a real big message church it's
[26:49] got eight hundred in it
[26:51] that preacher's so proud of himself for
[26:52] what
[26:56] it's a tiny little church
[26:58] but in the message it's giant it's so
[27:00] huge
[27:03] let's
[27:04] let's not be ignorant of satan's devices
[27:06] because
[27:07] a person could get pro his church grows
[27:10] up to 60 people and all of a sudden he's
[27:11] full of pride
[27:12] it's ridiculous but that's what that's
[27:14] what that's what can happen and it can
[27:16] happen even in the members of the church
[27:18] about the church and again it's not
[27:21] about
[27:22] that it's not about a building it's not
[27:24] about a
[27:26] redoing our building it's about serving
[27:28] people
[27:30] and glorifying god
[27:33] as we serve people
[27:34] and help them to grow
[27:36] and you know all the
[27:38] cameras and
[27:40] speakers and buildings and all that
[27:43] stuff is a means
[27:44] to serve god's people and if it's not
[27:46] then just throw it all out
[27:49] there's it's it's pointless and and so
[27:52] our i know our desire as a ministry team
[27:54] is to see
[27:56] all of us grow in the lord
[27:58] and that's that's our only purpose is to
[28:00] make a people ready for the rapture
[28:03] so i'm going to close let's stand
[28:11] heavenly father we
[28:14] we desire to see you
[28:17] lord we we love seeing each other we
[28:19] love the fellowship lord but
[28:22] our
[28:23] our purpose at being here this morning
[28:25] is to
[28:26] see you and to be changed
[28:29] into that same image from glory to glory
[28:31] lord i pray that you would
[28:33] just manifest yourself through the
[28:36] through the music
[28:38] through the singing through the
[28:40] preaching of the word

[28:44] today
