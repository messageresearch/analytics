[6:08] Father, that will give us a light on the
[6:11] inside when there's darkness all around.
[6:13] Father, we ask you would be with us this
[6:15] morning. Anoint the words that we're
[6:16] going to read. anoint the the scripture
[6:18] that we're going to partake of that
[6:20] Father that Lord that we could read the
[6:22] text, we could read the letters, we
[6:24] could feed on the text, but Lord,
[6:27] without your spirit providing the
[6:28] context, Father, we would be truly lost.
[6:31] So Lord, we ask that you would come down
[6:34] and anoint our hearts, anoint our minds,
[6:36] anoint my lips, and allow me to step out
[6:38] of the way and allow you to speak
[6:40] through me. We ask these things in the
[6:41] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[6:44] want to turn um as a scripture
[6:48] um to Matthew's gospel
[6:52] um and we're going to look at chapter 18
[6:54] and verse 15.
[7:03] This is um I'm going to continue my
[7:05] thought um the series that I've been
[7:07] kind of taking called Why Are We Here?
[7:10] And um this is Matthew 18 and verse1 15
[7:15] says, "Moreover, if thy brother shall
[7:17] trespass against thee, go and tell him
[7:20] his fault
[7:22] between thee and him alone. If he shall
[7:25] hear thee, thou hast gained thy
[7:27] brother." But if he will not hear hear
[7:30] thee, then take with thee one or two
[7:33] more, that in the mouth of two or three
[7:35] witnesses every word may be established.
[7:38] And if he shall neglect to hear them,
[7:40] tell it unto the church. But if he
[7:43] neglects to hear the church, let him be
[7:45] unto thee as an heathen man and a
[7:48] publican. You all can be seated.
[7:52] So I want to um
[7:59] so one of the things that I'm you know
[8:00] last last week I talked about love and
[8:02] love being you know we're called to be
[8:04] love uh to love one another that you if
[8:06] you do not love the brethren then you
[8:08] basically haven't passed from death into
[8:09] unto life. That's the scripture from I
[8:12] believe um uh uh first John. And um we
[8:18] want to talk a little bit about what
[8:20] that means specifically because a lot of
[8:21] pe a lot of times people have this
[8:23] notion that love is something that um
[8:27] there is no uh love is kind of soft and
[8:31] passive and doesn't have any
[8:33] confrontation or backbone to it.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; Right? That love is just oh we don't
[8:36] want to hurt anybody's feelings. We
[8:38] don't want to rock the boat and and we
[8:39] don't want to you know if you love
[8:41] somebody that you can't say anything
[8:42] that might contradict the way they feel.
[8:46] And unfortunately or rather fortunately
[8:50] that's wrong. Love is very
[8:53] confrontational if it is if the truth is
[8:57] on the line. Right? You cannot if if
[9:00] somebody when truth is on the line love
[9:02] has to speak for the truth because you
[9:04] can't love somebody and not allow them
[9:05] to live in a lie.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; Okay? and everybody, you know, there's I
[9:09] I saw a a meme of it's just the
[9:13] scripture, you know, so this is how
[9:15] people read the scripture a lot of times
[9:16] and it's the scripture that says judge
[9:18] not lest you be judged and then the rest
[9:20] of the scripture is crossed out, right?
[9:23] It's like no, that's not how that works.
[9:25] You read the rest of the scripture too,
[9:26] right? There's a, you know, the, you
[9:29] know, it doesn't mean that um, you know,
[9:32] if you read that Jesus is saying, you
[9:34] know, don't be a hypocrite. Don't go
[9:35] trying to help your brother when you
[9:37] have massive, massive problems of your
[9:39] own. You need to,
[9:42] you know, get the beam out of your own
[9:43] eye. But that doesn't mean that you just
[9:45] let your brethren stumble into bear
[9:46] traps willy-nilly. When you see, you
[9:49] know, it's a kind of a a famous military
[9:52] proverb that when you see your enemy
[9:54] making a mistake, don't interrupt them.
[9:57] Right? Well, if you see your friends
[9:59] making a mistake and you don't interrupt
[10:01] them,
[10:02] &gt;&gt; you've treated them like an enemy.
[10:05] Amen.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; Right? You know, that doesn't mean that
[10:07] you just go blasting people for the for
[10:09] their, you know, places where you see
[10:12] them making a mistake. But that means
[10:13] you go to them privately and you pull
[10:17] them aside and say, "Hey, you know, out
[10:19] of love here, I love you. I don't want
[10:21] to see you make this mistake." You know,
[10:23] if me and Brother Luther are walking
[10:25] through the woods
[10:26] &gt;&gt; and he sees me just walking along my
[10:29] path and he sees a bear trap out in
[10:31] front of me that I'm going to step in
[10:33] &gt;&gt; and he just goes, "Oh, well, you know, I
[10:35] just I don't want to rock the boat. I
[10:37] don't want to, you know, do I don't want
[10:38] to judge. You know, he's choosing his
[10:40] own path in life and I just don't want
[10:42] to I don't want to judge him. I don't
[10:44] want to Yeah. Well, I'm not going to
[10:46] feel very loved when I step in that bear
[10:48] trap.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. when I when my legs broken and I'm
[10:51] looking at him going, "You knew this was
[10:52] going to happen and you said nothing.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; You didn't. That's not love,
[10:57] &gt;&gt; right? That is a that is a very
[10:59] complicated
[11:01] complex form of hatred that gives the
[11:04] hateful plausible deniability,
[11:07] right? It's, you know, love when when
[11:10] there's conflict,
[11:12] you know, you know, like people want to
[11:14] reread that scripture
[11:17] and they'll read it like this. You know,
[11:19] moreover, if that brother shall trespass
[11:21] against thee, say nothing, do nothing
[11:23] about it. Let it fester in your heart.
[11:26] Let it slowly build up bitterness. Let
[11:28] it constantly plague your mind that that
[11:30] brother did you wrong and that you never
[11:32] dealt with it and he he never apologized
[11:34] for it. And it's just going to sit there
[11:36] and rot. And every time he does
[11:37] something that could even possibly be
[11:39] interpreted as contrary, you're going to
[11:41] attribute that to his rotten nature that
[11:43] you know he has because he did you wrong
[11:45] and you never dealt with it.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Right? And that's what happens. Go to
[11:51] your brother. Sunlight is the best
[11:53] disinfectant.
[11:54] Right? Don't put things just don't just
[11:57] bury stuff. You know it talks about you
[11:59] know love covers matter. Right? You
[12:01] know, you know, love doesn't, you know,
[12:03] you know, in Proverbs it says that, you
[12:06] know, love, love hides things. Well,
[12:07] that's why you go to him in private.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; Go to him oneon-one. Don't make it a big
[12:12] public show. Don't go, you know, blast
[12:14] him in public over something. Go to him
[12:16] in in private and say, "Hey, you know,
[12:18] we're we're we're brothers and I need to
[12:20] talk to you." You know, and more often
[12:22] than not, and everybody knows this, but
[12:23] more often than not, you know, he didn't
[12:26] mean it. It was an accident. Nobody
[12:28] meant anything by it, you know. No, it
[12:30] was if you if you just talk about it,
[12:32] you'll see it'll expose the devil's just
[12:34] trying to drive a wedge in the unity of
[12:36] the church,
[12:37] &gt;&gt; right? He's trying to break up the the
[12:40] fellowship that the people have by co by
[12:43] by causing misunderstandings and hurt
[12:46] feelings.
[12:47] So, it's important that we do these
[12:49] things because if you don't, you're
[12:51] going to get disease. You're going to
[12:52] get spiritual disease running through
[12:54] the church. You're going to get
[12:55] spiritual rot.
[12:57] And the exact same thing and obviously
[13:00] we know this also
[13:03] um
[13:05] on on the flip side of this I I want to
[13:06] say this before I move on from this. Um
[13:10] uh
[13:12] on the other side of this if your
[13:14] brother comes to you and says hey you
[13:16] you did something that hurt my you know
[13:18] that I I took offense to you know you
[13:21] there's there's some conflict there.
[13:23] you're not also going to be the person
[13:24] who's going to, you know, stand your
[13:26] ground and well, brother, I think you're
[13:27] just being ridiculous and I'm going to,
[13:29] you know, blast you with all my
[13:30] scriptures that I have to justify my
[13:31] actions. Like, no, take what they said
[13:34] into account, have a discussion about
[13:35] it. Operate with some love and kindness.
[13:38] You know, having a a a proud spirit and
[13:41] being stiff necked and refusing to even
[13:43] consider taking correction from your
[13:46] brother is the sin of Cain,
[13:49] &gt;&gt; right? That's the path of Cain. Brother
[13:51] Brandham said that the reason why Cain
[13:53] hated Abel is because Cain Abel had a
[13:56] revelation of serpent seed
[13:58] which in that context really is saying
[14:00] something, isn't it?
[14:02] &gt;&gt; Right? When Cain goes to Abel and says,
[14:04] "Abel, why are you making a blood
[14:05] sacrifice?" And Abel says, "Well, Cain,
[14:07] uh, here's why.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; There's some stuff you don't know about
[14:10] mom and dad."
[14:12] You know, Cain didn't like that too
[14:14] much. And he sure wasn't going to let,
[14:16] you know, somebody say that about his
[14:17] mama, right? So that I mean that's where
[14:21] this goes. So, you know, you don't when
[14:23] when your brother comes to you, you
[14:25] don't. Now, that doesn't mean that you
[14:26] just, you know, people can just make
[14:27] railing accusations against you, have to
[14:29] roll over and die. You know, you still
[14:31] have to stand with the word, but that
[14:33] doesn't mean that you just get your
[14:34] hackles up anytime somebody said, you
[14:36] know, says that there was an offense
[14:38] there. You know, you you operate with
[14:40] love.
[14:42] And
[14:45] this whole this whole thing this whole
[14:48] my whole point is that this is causing
[14:51] people cause having disagreements and
[14:53] misunderstandings and and having
[14:55] conflict.
[14:58] All human beings if people who love each
[15:00] other especially the people who love
[15:02] each other the most are going to have
[15:03] conflicts. You're going to have you're
[15:06] going to butt heads. Human nature is
[15:07] just that way. You're not going to be
[15:09] eye to eye on every single point and but
[15:11] it requires you to be able to to have
[15:14] that conversation, have that discussion
[15:16] with actual genuine love in your heart
[15:18] and and putting the truth in the word of
[15:19] God as the ultimate priority in that
[15:22] conversation.
[15:24] You know, especially in marriages, we,
[15:26] you know, it's it's kind of it's the
[15:28] cliche that husbands and wives fight,
[15:30] right? Husbands and wives never
[15:32] understand each other. And it's mostly
[15:35] biological, right? human men will never
[15:39] understand women and the magic that is
[15:40] the female mind.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; And women are going to be absolutely
[15:45] befuddled by how men come to the
[15:48] conclusions that they come to.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; And that's that's fine. It's because God
[15:52] separated the feminine out of Adam,
[15:55] right? There's there's he doesn't have
[15:59] the same hardware and software that you
[16:01] have, sister. And sister, you know,
[16:04] brother, she's doesn't think like you.
[16:06] She's never going to and if she did
[16:08] start thinking with exactly like you,
[16:10] there would be a problem,
[16:12] &gt;&gt; right? That's probably something she
[16:14] should see the doctor about the I mean
[16:17] this is I don't want to get too bogged
[16:19] down in there, but you you look at the
[16:21] science of why women think the way that
[16:23] they do and there is a whole host of
[16:24] reasons why they do it and I promise you
[16:26] you wouldn't like it if they didn't
[16:28] think that way.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[16:31] So,
[16:33] &gt;&gt; but it requires
[16:35] it requires men to treat their wives
[16:37] like Christ treats the church.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; And when they when the wife comes to
[16:41] them and has something wants to talk to
[16:44] them, they don't just dismiss them as,
[16:47] you know,
[16:49] don't just handwave their problems away.
[16:52] Oh, you're being you're making a
[16:53] mountain out of a molehill. You're you
[16:55] know, I I this is this is a a great
[16:58] example of this. I want to turn just
[17:00] I'll just read because it's just to save
[17:02] the save some time. This is Esther the
[17:04] book of Esther chapter 5 and verse one.
[17:07] Now it came to pass on the third day
[17:08] that Esther put on her royal apparel and
[17:10] stood in the inner court of the king's
[17:12] house over against the king's house. And
[17:14] the king sat upon his royal throne in
[17:16] the royal house over against the gate of
[17:17] the house. And it was so when the king
[17:20] saw Esther the queen standing in the
[17:21] court that she obtained favor in his
[17:24] sight. And the king held out to Esther
[17:26] the golden scepter that was in his hand.
[17:27] So Esther drew near and touched the top
[17:29] of the scepter. Then said the king to
[17:31] her, what wilt thou Queen Esther, and
[17:33] what is thy request? It shall be even
[17:35] given thee to the half of the kingdom.
[17:38] And Esther answered, if it seem good
[17:41] unto the king, let the king and Hmon
[17:43] come this day unto the banquet that I
[17:45] have prepared for him. So everybody
[17:48] knows the story. Esther gets notified by
[17:51] Mori. Hey, there's been a plot against
[17:53] you and your entire people. They're
[17:55] going to kill us all. you need to go
[17:56] talk to the king and get this resolved.
[17:58] You're the only person who's gonna have
[18:00] his ear on this matter. And she tells
[18:02] Morai, "More, you don't understand. I
[18:04] don't think this guy even loves me
[18:05] anymore. He hasn't talked to me in a
[18:06] month, right? He's so caught up in his
[18:08] business and his whatever it is that
[18:09] he's doing. He He literally hasn't even
[18:11] talked to me in a month. I don't like if
[18:14] I walk in there, he's just going to kill
[18:15] me, right? To go to the king uninvited
[18:17] is to death sentence." And Mori is like,
[18:19] "Listen, God put you in the situation.
[18:21] You need to go talk to him." Like if God
[18:23] put you like God put you in the
[18:25] situation for a reason. God put made you
[18:26] wife of the king for a reason. And so
[18:29] she plucks up her courage and she puts
[18:31] on her royal robes and she goes to the
[18:33] king and she faces death, right? She
[18:37] walked walking through those doors
[18:39] uninvited. There was a large Persian man
[18:41] standing there with a big axe and if she
[18:44] did not get recognition from the king,
[18:46] she was going to die where she stood.
[18:48] And she walked in there and she faced
[18:50] down all of that. And when she had the
[18:52] ear of the king and he's like, Esther,
[18:54] my darling, my queen, I'm so sorry I
[18:56] haven't made time for you. I've been
[18:57] very caught up in my business. What can
[18:59] I do for you? Whatever you want up to
[19:00] the half of my kingdom. Whatever you
[19:03] want.
[19:04] Whatever I can do for you, I'll do it
[19:06] right now. And she's like, um, can we go
[19:08] to dinner?
[19:10] The thing that she wanted, she didn't
[19:12] even have the courage to say.
[19:14] She faced death and then when it came
[19:17] time to reveal herself emotionally to
[19:19] her husband, she chickenened out.
[19:21] and went, "Uh, I can't do it. I need to
[19:25] build some rapport with you again
[19:26] because I haven't talked to you in a
[19:27] month. We've they've just life has
[19:29] gotten crazy and we haven't had some
[19:30] time to build the emotional connection.
[19:32] So, I have to invite you to dinner a
[19:34] couple of times and sit down and have a
[19:36] conversation so that when I talk to you,
[19:38] I'm confident that you're not going to
[19:39] treat my problems like they're a joke."
[19:45] This is what husbands and wives do.
[19:48] Husbands get caught up in their in their
[19:50] in in what the things that they're
[19:52] doing. You've got a lot of things to do.
[19:53] You've got businesses to run. You've got
[19:56] how, you know, bills to pay and mouths
[19:57] to feed and all the stuff you and mowing
[19:59] the lawn and and and you know, my car is
[20:02] broken and I've got all this stuff to
[20:03] do. And you get caught up in all of your
[20:05] business that you don't take time to set
[20:09] some time aside for your wife and remind
[20:12] her that you guys are married, right?
[20:15] Make her remember that you still love
[20:17] her.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; Make her realize that because she has a
[20:22] biology that you don't have.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Her her system like her her brain
[20:30] recycles on a regular basis. And if you
[20:32] don't take that into account, men have
[20:34] this thing of like, "Oh, well, I told
[20:35] you once, you know, that I love you once
[20:36] when we got married, and if it changes,
[20:38] I'll tell you." No, man. You have to.
[20:42] That's a constant thing. Could you
[20:44] imagine if God gave you a a spiritual
[20:46] experience once and then never again?
[20:49] &gt;&gt; No. We come to church all the time
[20:51] looking for a fresh outpouring of the
[20:52] spirit. What do you think that is? It's
[20:54] the natural typing the spiritual. God
[20:57] made women this way because it's the
[21:00] pattern of how the church is to God.
[21:03] Right? It's the natural typing the
[21:05] spiritual. Husbands, that's what you
[21:07] signed up for when you got married. If
[21:09] you didn't like that, if that's too much
[21:10] for you, you shouldn't have got married.
[21:14] Right? I mean, that's just the reality.
[21:16] And so, you know, it's it's our job as
[21:19] men to recognize that your wife needs to
[21:22] have the emotional connection because
[21:23] what's going on? Here's what could have
[21:24] happened. If Hazardous is sitting there
[21:26] dealing with all of his big lofty
[21:28] ambitions and then Esther comes in there
[21:29] and is like, "Can we go to dinner?" And
[21:31] he's like, "Really? You bothered me over
[21:33] that?" Well, okay, fine. I'll put it on
[21:35] the schedule for next week. Whatever.
[21:36] We'll figure it out. And then you
[21:37] forget. And then, yeah, then she's going
[21:38] to die. You She's got something in her
[21:42] heart. Most of the time the wives have
[21:44] are carrying burdens in their heart that
[21:47] is going that is it's the fate of your
[21:49] marriage is at stake. They're carrying
[21:52] something that they need to feel secure
[21:54] to tell you the same way that we do with
[21:56] God all the time. We carry burdens that
[21:59] for whatever reason we we don't give to
[22:01] God, right? We carry burdens of, you
[22:04] know, whatever it is. And half the time
[22:06] we either we either think it's not
[22:07] important to God or we think that it's
[22:09] our own fault. So God's not responsible.
[22:11] So we're not going to bother God to tell
[22:12] God about it. We have all these
[22:14] different reasons why we won't go to God
[22:15] with our burdens.
[22:18] And so it never gets brought up. So I
[22:21] mean Esther's just doing the exact same
[22:23] thing, right? Esther's doing the same
[22:25] thing. She's going to a hazardous and
[22:26] she's trying to build a connection so
[22:28] she can feel safe that this massive
[22:30] thing that she's dealing with that if he
[22:32] doesn't deal with it, she's going to
[22:33] die,
[22:35] right?
[22:37] And but it takes her some time to build
[22:39] a connection with him again just to tell
[22:40] her what's tell him what's on her heart.
[22:43] So it you know it but it's on us as men
[22:47] to be Christ in this situation. When
[22:49] your wife comes to you with a problem,
[22:50] even if it seems insignificant, don't
[22:52] dismiss it. Hey, what's your what's your
[22:55] what's your problem? Because probably
[22:58] that's not the problem.
[23:00] probably there's something else going on
[23:01] that she's not telling you that you need
[23:03] to woo her, remind her that you're
[23:06] married so that she can deal with the
[23:08] actual problem. You know,
[23:12] if if Anyways, I feel like I'm repeating
[23:15] myself a lot here. Maybe someone needed
[23:17] to hear this.
[23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; Likewise, wives, if you've got a
[23:22] problem, don't sit there and let it
[23:24] fester.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Go to your husband. Even though the
[23:27] devil will sit there and tell you he's
[23:28] not going to take it seriously and he's
[23:30] going to dismiss you and he's not going
[23:31] to treat your problems like they're
[23:32] meaningful, go to him. Let him do his
[23:35] job.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; Go let do your part. Be Esther. Be
[23:41] Esther. Right.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; I I was just reading this is completely
[23:45] We're going off road here. This ain't in
[23:46] my notes. Um, there is a a story when
[23:49] David is running from Saul and he's got
[23:51] his men and he's looking he goes to a
[23:53] man named uh Nabal and he asks him for
[23:55] supplies and Nabal's like, "Ah, get out
[23:56] of here. You're a renegade. I don't want
[23:57] nothing to do with you." And then his
[23:59] wife recognized knowing who David is
[24:00] like, "My husband's going to get us all
[24:02] killed." And so she
[24:05] um packs up a bunch of dinner and goes
[24:08] to David. It's like, "I'm sorry. Don't
[24:09] listen to him. He's crazy. Take the
[24:12] food." And he smooths everything over.
[24:14] Well, when she gets back, Nabal hears
[24:17] what she did and he has a heart attack
[24:19] and dies over it. And then eventually
[24:24] Abigail, the the wife, ends up married
[24:26] to David. I tell you this story because
[24:29] to illustrate a point, sisters, inside
[24:33] of every man is a Nabal and a David,
[24:36] right? One of them is a scoundrel and
[24:38] one of them is very noble and loves you
[24:40] very much.
[24:42] If you appeal to the David in him, it
[24:44] will kill the Nabal. Okay? Appeal to the
[24:48] noble side of it. Treat him like he's
[24:50] David. If you treat him like he's Nabal
[24:52] all the time, then that's what he'll be,
[24:54] &gt;&gt; right? That's what he'll be. Appeal to
[24:57] the David even when because David really
[24:59] didn't have a right to do what he did.
[25:02] He just showed up and demanded food,
[25:05] &gt;&gt; right? I mean, that's kind of a kind of
[25:07] an arrogant way to approach things. But
[25:09] if you respond like Abigail, you'll get
[25:12] a noble side of him. You'll get a a
[25:15] caring cuz David I mean what David said
[25:17] about her at the end of it when she came
[25:19] came to him and he was David was blown
[25:21] away. He's like this woman is like
[25:22] nothing I've ever seen before. This
[25:24] woman is incredible. He I mean he he
[25:26] treated like he was just absolutely
[25:28] floored
[25:29] because of what she was willing to do.
[25:31] she was willing to be submissive in even
[25:35] when she didn't really necessarily have
[25:38] an obligation to. But that's that's kind
[25:40] of the calling here that sisters go to
[25:42] your husband even when it's when you're
[25:44] afraid that he's going to be dismissive.
[25:46] Even when you're afraid that he's going
[25:48] to be,
[25:49] you know, he's going to be nabal and and
[25:52] dismiss you and be like, I I'm gonna
[25:54] deal with your problems. You can deal
[25:55] with this yourself or, you know, just
[25:57] and he's just gonna treat your problems
[25:58] like they're nothing. No, go to appeal
[26:00] to his David side, right? Go treat him.
[26:04] Do it anyways. Don't just sit there and
[26:06] let it fester because it's going to hurt
[26:08] you. It's This is how gang green starts,
[26:11] right? I said earlier that the the
[26:13] saying sunlight's the best disinfectant.
[26:16] That's an old old military um uh first
[26:19] aid proverb that when you get shot and
[26:22] there's not access to good antibiotics
[26:24] and good back in the day, you know, back
[26:26] before antibiotics, you go leave the
[26:29] wound unbandaged out in the sun and let
[26:31] the sunlight blasted with the
[26:32] ultraviolet rays because it kills
[26:34] bacteria,
[26:35] right? the sun, you know, that's why
[26:36] they put UV lights in hospital uh
[26:39] ventilation systems because ultraviolet
[26:42] light, sunlight is lethal to infection
[26:46] and it's a, you know, go when don't just
[26:49] let things lay in your heart, don't let
[26:52] things when there's a problem in your
[26:54] marriage that one party seems to be
[26:55] oblivious of or if they aren't oblivious
[26:57] of it, um, aren't dealing with, you've
[27:01] got to go to your brother. Don't it
[27:03] don't like I said the things that are a
[27:05] part of the the the way the church
[27:07] operates and the unity of the church are
[27:08] just an extrapolation an expansion of
[27:10] the way the home operates right if you
[27:13] see problems in your home you see
[27:15] conflict in your home you somebody's got
[27:17] some hurt feelings do not lay let that
[27:20] lay there unressed
[27:23] &gt;&gt; don't do it this is how you get
[27:26] long-term problems
[27:28] &gt;&gt; you let go put some sunshine on it go
[27:33] be proactive
[27:34] and expose the devil trying to make an
[27:37] infection there. If you don't, you're
[27:40] going to have a problem in the long run
[27:42] that you can't just fix,
[27:44] &gt;&gt; right? So,
[27:47] man, I spent a lot more on that than I
[27:49] had intended.
[27:52] Um,
[27:57] I'll end with this. I got a couple more
[27:59] minutes here.
[28:01] You know, this extends
[28:05] wonder if I can bite this off in a few
[28:06] minutes.
[28:09] All right. So, when as a dad, as I'm
[28:14] this is a frequent experience of mine
[28:16] that my baby oftentimes wakes up exactly
[28:20] like her father, which is screaming and
[28:23] angry that they're awake.
[28:26] Not really. I don't wake up screaming,
[28:28] but I do wake I don't like waking up. I
[28:30] like to sleep anyways. But she wakes up
[28:32] angry and she's screaming and she's
[28:34] crying and I go in there. I pick her up
[28:36] and I'm trying to console her and do all
[28:37] the things that I know that I can do
[28:39] that usually makes her happy, but it
[28:41] doesn't work. And she's angry and she's
[28:44] screaming. She will not be pacified in
[28:46] any way, shape, or form. And it's
[28:48] because that baby needs something that
[28:52] I, as a dad, cannot give her.
[28:55] Mom can but dad cannot. Right?
[29:00] And
[29:02] it's because mom has some biology that
[29:06] dad does not have.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Right? She's built for it. I'm not.
[29:12] But this is why this is the natural
[29:15] typing the spiritual in the book of
[29:17] revelations when Christ is walking
[29:19] amongst the golden candlesticks and it
[29:21] talks about being girded about the paps
[29:24] with a gird golden girdle. Brother
[29:26] Brandham clearly taught that that is the
[29:28] that is an indication that it is God
[29:30] manifested in his bride at the end time
[29:33] that it shows a feminine form. There's a
[29:35] feminine aspect to Christ in the golden
[29:37] candlesticks. That's God operating
[29:38] through his bride. And because what
[29:42] happens is so many times it's not just
[29:44] husbands and wives that have problems.
[29:46] Sometimes it's kids. Children have hard
[29:49] hard questions. Children have difficult
[29:53] issues that they're dealing with. Even
[29:54] if they're small issues, small problems
[29:56] are big problems to small people. Okay?
[29:59] It might be something simple to you, but
[30:01] it's a big thing to them. Or maybe
[30:03] they're a little bit older. They're 10,
[30:04] 12, 13. And it's not a small question.
[30:07] It's something like, "Dad, I don't
[30:08] understand how there can be a God if
[30:10] children and innocent people can be
[30:12] tormented. If there's so much evil in
[30:14] the world, how can a loving God allow
[30:16] that to happen?"
[30:18] And kids as young as 10, 12, and 13 have
[30:21] those kinds of questions. And if you're
[30:22] not somebody that they are comfortable
[30:24] going to and being knowing that you're
[30:27] going to be Christ, God with skin on it,
[30:30] right? that you're going to have some
[30:32] flesh that the pillar of fire just
[30:34] doesn't have. To be the God with skin on
[30:36] it who can who can deal with their
[30:38] problems and be there for them when they
[30:41] have big questions like that of dad, I
[30:43] don't understand the message. I don't I
[30:45] I don't I don't believe this. I don't
[30:47] feel it in my heart. Dad, I don't have
[30:48] the desire to be a Christian. If you're
[30:51] not there, if you're not God with skin
[30:54] on it in that moment, you're failing to
[30:57] provide for your family. That's why God
[31:00] put you there. So that when those
[31:02] children have those kinds of problems,
[31:05] you're going to be there to deal with
[31:06] it. You're gonna have the biology that
[31:09] the pillar of fire doesn't have.
[31:15] There's some things that the pillar of
[31:16] fire can't do.
[31:19] Not without skin. Not without some
[31:22] badger skins around it.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; You know, exactly. There ain't no hands
[31:27] but your hands. There's no hands to hold
[31:29] that that hurting child except for your
[31:31] hands. That's why God put you there. And
[31:34] if we as parents can't be there for our
[31:36] kids when they get to that level, when
[31:38] they get hurt, when there is some
[31:41] emotional damage, listen, there is so
[31:43] many times kids get hurt badly,
[31:47] really badly, things that that you know,
[31:50] I don't even want to get into right now
[31:52] and are dealing with issues. Listen, I
[31:56] have seen with my own eyes kids as young
[31:59] as 12 being suicidal.
[32:02] And if you can't be God with skin on, if
[32:05] you can't be so loving that those kids
[32:07] that are hurting can come to you and
[32:09] know that mom and dad are going to love
[32:11] them and not just dismiss them, and
[32:13] they're probably not going to come to
[32:14] you with, "Hey, dad, I'm having suicidal
[32:17] ideiation. Can you fix that?" No.
[32:19] They're going to come at you sideways
[32:21] because they're trying to figure out if
[32:22] you're going to love them still.
[32:26] you know, they're going to approach
[32:27] their parents in a way that isn't going
[32:28] to be direct. So, it's on you to treat
[32:31] their small problems like their big
[32:33] problems because that's the only way
[32:34] you're going to open the door to their
[32:35] big problems.
[32:37] You've got to be God with skin on it.
[32:40] You've got to be the the you're the
[32:43] first version of God they're ever going
[32:44] to see. You're the first. If they can't
[32:47] come to you with any problem that they
[32:48] would go to God with, then what are you?
[32:51] Amen.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; They any problem that they can go to God
[32:55] with, they should be able to go to you
[32:56] with first. And then if you don't have
[32:58] the answer, cuz we're humans, too.
[33:00] Parents are humans, too. We're not going
[33:01] to have all the answers. When your kid
[33:03] comes to you with something that you
[33:04] ain't never even heard of before, but it
[33:06] is some What are you supposed to do? You
[33:09] show them how you would do it. You put
[33:11] your arm around them and you go on your
[33:12] knees and you pray together.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; You show them the way that they should
[33:16] go when you're when they're old enough
[33:18] to not have you around anymore.
[33:22] That's that's that's
[33:25] in morphe. That's God putting on a mask,
[33:30] &gt;&gt; you know. That's that's what it means to
[33:32] let God wear have the biology of the
[33:34] Holy Ghost,
[33:37] you know.
[33:39] And I know we feel inadequate. I know we
[33:41] feel like we're not cut out for this.
[33:45] And it's way more than what we can
[33:46] handle.
[33:49] But you know,
[33:51] God chose to build his tabernacle out of
[33:53] badger skins.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; They're not the little black and white
[33:57] badgers of England. That's not what was
[34:00] in the Middle East when they were making
[34:01] badger getting badger skins for the
[34:03] tabernacle. Talking about honey badgers.
[34:06] These things are it's like the African
[34:09] version of a wolverine.
[34:11] They're ferocious and they smell bad.
[34:15] They're brutal and they're nasty. They
[34:17] run lions off of carcasses.
[34:20] But that's what God chose to wrap his
[34:22] Holy Spirit in. That's what God chose to
[34:24] wrap around the holiest of holies. And
[34:26] we feel inadequate. We don't feel like
[34:28] what we're that we're supposed to we can
[34:30] do that. We look at our badger skin and
[34:32] say that's not God. You're right. But
[34:36] God's inside of it. And if you just
[34:39] don't get so caught up in that, you can
[34:41] be God for somebody. And it might not be
[34:43] your kids. Maybe it's somebody else's
[34:46] kids. Maybe it's,
[34:49] you know, maybe it's just some sinner
[34:50] that you met. I don't know. But that's
[34:52] what it means. That's what we're called
[34:54] to.
[34:56] Anyways, I got to I'm way over time.
[34:59] Let's stand and and have a word of
[35:00] prayer.
[35:08] Father, I come before you with
[35:12] dismissing these people. Lord, something
[35:15] that could have be said, these
[35:16] stammering lips and the foolishness of
[35:18] this preaching, Lord, that something
[35:20] could have been said that would
[35:21] encourage somebody, would give someone a
[35:24] a light to to guide them through the
[35:26] darkness.
[35:28] Father, that we could hold to your
[35:30] promise that you would be living through
[35:32] us when the time came. That when we
[35:35] would face our greatest trials, that you
[35:36] would be the everpresent help inside of
[35:38] us, living through us. We ask these
[35:41] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[35:42] Christ that you would be with us
[35:44] throughout this service and into the
[35:46] worship service that our hearts would be
[35:47] open. Be with us father in Jesus
[35:50] precious name. Amen.
