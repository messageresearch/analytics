[42:15] your control
[42:18] amen God says I give you all these so I
[42:23] put it under your
[42:26] control

[42:35] possession Gideon will know this one
[42:38] control of the
[42:39] ball in a basketball game when they have
[42:42] when one team has possession they say
[42:45] they got control of the ball so that
[42:48] ball is going to do whatever that player
[42:50] who has it if they're going to pass it

[43:07] our homes we need to apply the token we
[43:10] need to put the blood above our doors to
[43:13] keep the devil out what would happen
[43:15] down in Egypt if the father had put the
[43:17] blood over the doors when the death
[43:19] angel passed by the firstborn would
[43:24] die but the father put the blood over he
[43:27] applied the token he's claiming his
[43:30] children he's claiming his children
[43:33] that's what we need to do we need to
[43:34] claim our children you might not talk to
[43:37] them in three years but God is moving on
[43:39] a
[43:43] scene it's the act of having or taking
[43:46] into
[43:48] control you know I sit here this this
[43:50] afternoon sit thinking of this and I
[43:52] actually looked it up because you heard

[44:01] Spirit here under my
[44:05] control every Spirit he say you're a
[44:09] human being you're a spirit so I'm
[44:11] standing here I'm taking every Spirit

[44:32] forth for help because they know once
[44:35] that man says I'm bringing every Spirit
[44:38] under my control something's going to
[44:41] happen that's what we need to do we need
[44:43] to take every Spirit under our
[44:47] control what would happen if every
[44:49] Spirit was under your
[44:51] control brother I didn't say I didn't he
[44:54] says I take every Spirit under my
[44:56] control for the glory of William brandom
[44:59] if you see that ever all 107 times he
[45:02] says I'll take every Spirit under my
[45:04] control for the glory of
[45:10] God what would happen if we if we were
[45:12] to do
[45:13] that if we us to go in our homes if we
[45:16] would tell the devil I'll take every
[45:18] Spirit under my control and drive out
[45:21] every devil out of your
[45:25] house we don't want to make him feel
[45:29] welcome come on devil come on in sit

[46:06] to seow down and depressed you don't
[46:09] want to do
[46:10] nothing you'll come to church you'll
[46:13] leave soon the preacher says you're
[46:14] dismissed don't see
[46:17] people there's Deliverance for that
[46:21] bring that under your control possession
[46:24] the act of having or taken in control
[46:29] control or occupancy of property it's
[46:32] ownership you own
[46:35] it hallelujah it's your property it
[46:39] belongs to you it's a physiological
[46:42] state in which an individual's normal
[46:44] personality is replaced by
[46:48] another they use this definition for the
[46:51] possessed people out here but I'm using
[46:53] the same one where we how we possess
[46:56] we're blessed by
[46:58] God where it takes my normal personality
[47:01] and it's turned over to Jesus Christ
[47:04] where I ain't nothing but a walking
[47:05] talking
[47:07] Jesus that I have all things in control
[47:11] under my
[47:13] feet so every promise in this book
[47:16] belongs to you it's your possession you
[47:19] know when you go buy a
[47:21] car you got this list of stack of papers
[47:24] you got to sign and you'll sign every
[47:27] one of
[47:28] them and they say okay here's the keys
[47:31] the car is yours but you sit there in
[47:33] your
[47:34] chair look out the window man that's a
[47:37] beautiful
[47:39] car that's the nicest one I've ever
[47:42] had I bet it's got that new car
[47:47] smell the the guy at the store said it's
[47:51] yours get out of here you just look over
[47:54] and say hey bro look my car
[47:58] car but you're inside the building still
[48:00] looking at
[48:02] it hey bro there's my healing there's my
[48:06] joy there's my overcoming power there's
[48:09] my
[48:10] Deliverance but it's right outside the
[48:12] door we're afraid to get up and go get
[48:16] it it's your possession why don't you
[48:19] get up and go get
[48:24] [Music]
[48:25] it
[48:31] but until you get out of that chair and
[48:34] take those
[48:35] keys it's not yours just yet but you got
[48:39] to get the keys and get in it and start
[48:41] that thing up and you're
[48:44] like this is
[48:48] mine and you're driving down the road
[48:50] with your
[48:52] possession you don't take the keys and
[48:55] walk out the door and with the brother
[48:57] Matt
[48:59] here my car is
[49:01] yours he didn't sign the paper now if he
[49:05] wants to make the payment I'll let him
[49:06] drive
[49:09] it but it's still in my name it's my
[49:12] possession I claimed it so I got out
[49:15] there and got in it and drove off in it
[49:17] because it's mine healing stands in
[49:20] front of me I'm going to reach out and
[49:22] claim it because it's
[49:25] mine
[49:28] but it's so
[49:29] easy when you give somebody something
[49:33] it's easy to take it
[49:34] back like an Indian
[49:37] giver or you buy something and just take
[49:40] it back where you bought it we'll do it
[49:43] in a
[49:45] heartbeat even take back stuff we
[49:49] said but we're afraid to take back what
[49:51] the devil stoed from
[49:55] us I don't have to know what he stole
[49:58] from you you
[50:00] know so take it
[50:03] back just look at the Devil say get it
[50:05] back to me it's my
[50:08] property I believe it belongs to
[50:11] me you know open the scripture says in 1
[50:13] Samuel and it came to pass when David
[50:15] his men were come to zigg on the third
[50:17] day you know David was living in the
[50:19] land of the
[50:22] Philistines he got tired of King Saul
[50:24] chasing
[50:25] him
[50:27] so he went and said okay I'll make a
[50:28] deal with the
[50:31] Devils I'll fight for you if you let me
[50:33] live in one of your towns they said okay
[50:36] so we're getting ready to go fight
[50:37] Israel won't you come on and help us
[50:40] well David and his army got
[50:43] there and the leaders said what are
[50:45] these Hebrews doing here send them back
[50:48] home so what the Bible says took them
[50:50] three days to get back home so what it
[50:52] took them three days to get there and
[50:53] three days back so they were pretty
[50:55] tired they got back home
[50:57] you can imagine after a long trip
[50:59] brother Matt
[51:02] knows fly to New Zealand you get to New
[51:05] Zealand you sleep for three
[51:08] days you're so wore out at that weakest
[51:13] time is when you get sick you can get I
[51:17] I do when if if I go a few days without
[51:20] any rest or sleep I start getting you
[51:22] start feeling sick brother Andrew you
[51:24] start feeling you and my wife knows if I
[51:26] don't get no rest I got the man
[51:33] flu so in traveling they were already
[51:36] worn
[51:36] out it's at this point of tiredness
[51:39] sometimes you get like I said you get
[51:40] sick you at your weakest point when
[51:42] you're worn out it's at this point the
[51:45] devil likes to attack you he likes to
[51:48] get you at your weakest Point that's
[51:50] when he comes to you if God loved you
[51:53] you wouldn't be going through all these
[51:55] things
[51:58] if God really loved you you wouldn't be
[52:00] sick all the
[52:02] time that's what he did to Jesus where
[52:05] Jesus was baptized went up to the
[52:06] Wilderness to be tempted and after 40
[52:08] days the devil come to him caught him
[52:12] when he was weak if thou be the Son of
[52:15] God cast these make these Stones bread
[52:18] throw yourself off the temple if thou he
[52:20] he started so he started tempting Jesus
[52:22] at his weakest moment the devil started
[52:24] attacking that's what the devil likes to
[52:26] do to you he'll get you at your weakest
[52:28] moment when you're down and out trial
[52:32] after trial bombard you you're wondering
[52:34] God do you even love me you're just
[52:36] wonder what next could happen when you
[52:38] don't think anything else can happen you
[52:40] get hit by
[52:43] somebody that happened last
[52:46] weekend just when you don't when you
[52:48] think you can't go through one more
[52:51] thing here comes something
[52:54] else and the devil would like to use
[52:57] that to
[53:00] you he'll mess with your
[53:03] mind at that weakest Point that's what
[53:06] he did to
[53:08] David sometimes you feel like you can't
[53:11] go on that this was a state that David
[53:12] his army was in when they returned they
[53:14] found out the amalekites had invaded
[53:16] from the south and zigged and and burned
[53:19] it down and taking all the women
[53:22] captives that were
[53:24] therein and David and his men came the
[53:26] city and behold it was burned with
[53:28] fire their wives their sons their
[53:31] daughters were taking
[53:33] captives can you imagine how they felt
[53:36] fathers you go home and your wives and
[53:38] kids are
[53:41] gone and David and the people that were
[53:43] with him lifted up their voice and wept
[53:45] until they had no more power to
[53:49] weep can you imagine being
[53:53] there they cried so much they couldn't
[53:56] cry no
[53:58] more and David's two wives he already
[54:01] Tak C David was greatly distressed for
[54:03] the people spake a stone in
[54:06] him I couldn't imagine what they were
[54:08] going through and they started blaming
[54:11] David if you hadn't run from King Saul
[54:15] our wives would be protected over
[54:18] there they wouldn't dare to come over
[54:20] the land of Israel destroy our town but
[54:23] it's your fault you're the one that
[54:25] provoked the Malachi to come in here
[54:28] it's your fault
[54:29] David it's so easy to find the blame on
[54:34] somebody start blaming people for for
[54:36] stuff but because the soul of the people
[54:40] was greev every man for his sons and
[54:42] daughters that David but David
[54:47] encouraged
[54:49] himself you know David was so down how
[54:53] could things get
[54:55] worse that's the way it is just when
[54:58] things can't get any worse something
[55:00] else will happen you'll go through trial
[55:03] after trial but take courage God said he
[55:05] won't put no more on you than you can
[55:08] bear cuz that's what it says Thou have
[55:10] no temptation taken you but such is
[55:13] common to man but God is
[55:16] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[55:18] tempted above that ye are able and with
[55:21] the Temptation also make a way of Escape
[55:25] that you'll be able able to Bear
[55:28] it all hell might be breaking loose on
[55:31] you but God can trust

[59:01] come only from being filled with the
[59:04] Holy Spirit to
[59:06] overflowing that's playing the
[59:09] man I love this the word enthusiasm
[59:13] comes from the Greek roots in an Theos
[59:18] meaning in
[59:20] God so the more you get into God the
[59:24] more God's spirit gets into you the more
[59:26] impassion you
[59:29] become it won't
[59:31] be
[59:34] devil if you don't mind can you take
[59:38] your anxiety away from
[59:41] me devil if you don't
[59:45] mind can you take this heart condition
[59:47] away from
[59:49] me okay one more thing devil if you
[59:51] don't
[59:53] mind can you get rid of this lust can
[59:55] you get that lust away from

[1:00:04] from being filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:00:07] the read it again the more you get into
[1:00:08] God the more imp passion you become you
[1:00:11] will say devil take your heart problems

[1:00:26] outside your comfort
[1:00:30] zone physically
[1:00:34] spiritually you tell me the last time
[1:00:36] you were uncomfortable and I'll tell you
[1:00:38] the last time you
[1:00:40] grew growth only happens when we put
[1:00:43] ourselves into uncomfortable
[1:00:48] situations how about this example Jesus
[1:00:52] may have been Meek and
[1:00:53] Mild but he also had a wild out
[1:00:58] side he touched the
[1:01:00] leopards celebrated Samaritans stopped
[1:01:03] storms cast out demons ate with Sinners
[1:01:06] healed on the Sabbath turned funeral
[1:01:08] possessions into
[1:01:10] parades it's though coincidence that the
[1:01:12] final week of his
[1:01:14] life was called passion week because
[1:01:18] that's who Jesus
[1:01:22] [Music]
[1:01:24] was when you following the footsteps of
[1:01:27] Jesus his passion will refine you and
[1:01:31] Define
[1:01:34] you God don't doesn't just crucify our
[1:01:37] passions he resurrects them and uses
[1:01:40] them for his
[1:01:42] purpose what can you do today that'll
[1:01:45] make you feel uncomfortable and fully
[1:01:47] Alive play the
[1:01:53] man that was free
[1:01:56] David encouraged himself in the
[1:02:00] Lord took all patience and exercised
[1:02:03] faith on his God he encouraged himself
[1:02:06] in the power of God in the promises of
[1:02:10] God and his faithfulness in keeping them
[1:02:13] David encouraged himself in the
[1:02:19] Lord in the promises of God you know he
[1:02:22] probably got to
[1:02:24] thinking you know this this is this is
[1:02:27] rough I don't think I've ever been
[1:02:28] through anything like
[1:02:30] this he said you know what one day God

[1:02:47] given to me David starting encouraging
[1:02:51] himself you need encouraging start
[1:02:53] thinking about what God's done for you
[1:02:57] God you deliver me from this
[1:02:59] world God you saved my soul God you
[1:03:03] placed a predestinated seed inside of
[1:03:06] me God you fill me with the Holy

[1:03:15] has done for
[1:03:16] you brought you from a barroom stool to
[1:03:19] a church
[1:03:24] pew Hallelujah the tarum says David
[1:03:28] strengthened himself in the
[1:03:31] word of the Lord his God Christ the word
[1:03:37] of God in the power of His might so how
[1:03:41] do you encourage
[1:03:45] yourself it's
[1:03:48] simple get into this
[1:03:52] word get into this word
[1:03:56] start looking around at what belongs to
[1:03:59] you oh Lord by his stripes I'm Healed if
[1:04:03] I ask anything in his name he's going to
[1:04:05] do
[1:04:09] it promise after promise after
[1:04:13] promise what did David do after he
[1:04:16] encourag encouraged himself he went to
[1:04:19] prayer what do I do
[1:04:23] God verse eight David inquired the Lord
[1:04:26] saying shall I pursue after this
[1:04:30] troop to run
[1:04:32] after usually with hostile
[1:04:39] intent Lord should I go after this this
[1:04:41] army with hostile
[1:04:45] intent woo sometimes that's what we need
[1:04:48] to
[1:04:49] do the Devils took our possessions we
[1:04:51] need to get hostile with
[1:04:53] him we need to take the sword to go
[1:04:56] after
[1:04:57] him not running back this way but
[1:05:00] running right at him run after the
[1:05:04] devil get hostile with him Chase put the
[1:05:09] flight follow him persecute
[1:05:13] him persecute the devil he persecutes us
[1:05:17] enough turn the tables on him let's
[1:05:20] start persecuting the
[1:05:24] devil
[1:05:26] should I pursue them shall I overtake
[1:05:30] them and he answers says
[1:05:34] pursue for Thou shalt surely overtake
[1:05:39] them and without fail recover
[1:05:45] all what do you got
[1:05:48] lost what's been taken from you pursue
[1:05:51] the devil you will recover all amen
[1:05:57] so David went 600 men went down to the
[1:06:01] brook there were some that left behind
[1:06:03] it was too weak to
[1:06:07] go of course you know the story they
[1:06:09] found an Egyptian he said yeah they
[1:06:10] they're down
[1:06:13] here but David said can you bring me
[1:06:17] down to this company and swear unto me
[1:06:19] by God that neither wilt thou kill me
[1:06:21] nor deliver me into the hands of my
[1:06:23] master I will bring thee down to this
[1:06:25] company and when he had brought him down
[1:06:27] behold they were spread abroad upon the
[1:06:31] Earth they thought David and him was
[1:06:33] going to be gone for
[1:06:34] days no doubt they probably hung up on
[1:06:36] the mountain tops and looked and says
[1:06:38] they're gone off the war they're going
[1:06:41] to be gone for several days it's our
[1:06:43] time so they were just having a good old
[1:06:45] time good
[1:06:48] party they were spread abroad upon the
[1:06:51] Earth eating and drinking and dancing
[1:06:54] because of all the great spoil that they
[1:06:56] had taken from the the land of the
[1:06:59] Philistines from David and his
[1:07:02] men and David smoked them from Twilight
[1:07:07] even until the eding of the next
[1:07:13] day woo that's a long
[1:07:16] time sometimes it takes that
[1:07:19] long sometimes it'll take us that long
[1:07:22] to to to get back what's ours because we
[1:07:25] want want to destroy every devil in our
[1:07:30] way and there escaped not a man of them
[1:07:32] sa 400 young men which rode camels and
[1:07:35] fled and David recovered
[1:07:39] all that the amalekites had carried
[1:07:42] away and there was nothing lacking to
[1:07:46] them whatever they lost they got back so
[1:07:52] if you lost your joy you can get every
[1:07:54] bit of it back back not one of it is
[1:07:57] gone Hallelujah you got a Lost Child
[1:08:01] you're going to get it

[1:27:21] Lord amen praise the Lord thank you Amen
[1:27:26] Brother Brad for that wonderful sermon
[1:27:28] that was just awesome you know I love um
[1:27:31] I love that story means so much to me
[1:27:34] David and ziklag and the restoration and
[1:27:37] uh I love so much even Brother Brad
[1:27:39] brought so much out of that but I just
[1:27:42] love so much seeing how that if you
[1:27:44] follow that story when David gets his
[1:27:46] wife back all the men get their wi back
[1:27:48] their families their children but
[1:27:51] actually if you go further David also
[1:27:53] not not only did he get everything back
[1:27:56] and recover all that he lost but
[1:27:58] actually the Bible says that David
[1:28:01] recovered the spoils which spoils were
[1:28:04] loot it was just what they got they not
[1:28:07] only did they take the men took their
[1:28:09] wives and children but when David wiped
[1:28:11] them out he took their gold he took
[1:28:13] their Treasures he took their oxen he
[1:28:15] took and so when the devil take
[1:28:18] something from you not only do you get
[1:28:20] it back but you get that
[1:28:22] plus amen you might have lost this much
[1:28:25] joy but God gives you this much joy back
[1:28:28] I love um we brother Josh Bennett
[1:28:31] preached uh just a masterpiece when we
[1:28:33] were in Johnson City several months ago
[1:28:36] now and it and it's always stuck with me
[1:28:38] and my wife so much um the Lord just
[1:28:40] spoke to us so much in that service that
[1:28:43] I'll never forget he was talking about
[1:28:46] restoration and he brought out how that
[1:28:48] in the Bible that when a man stole an
[1:28:52] ox and he said when a man would if a man
[1:28:54] was to steal another man's Ox that God
[1:28:57] actually put a law in the Bible that
[1:28:59] when he returned that he wasn't just
[1:29:01] permitted just to give the ox back but
[1:29:04] he actually had to give him payment he
[1:29:06] had to compensate him for all the lost
[1:29:10] time in the field that he had all the
[1:29:12] lost time from work all the crops that
[1:29:14] he lost because he didn't have that Ox
[1:29:16] actually the man had to give not just
[1:29:18] the ox back and brother Josh said
[1:29:20] restoration when God gives is not just
[1:29:22] restoration it's rep
[1:29:24] restoration with
[1:29:27] compensation are you glad for that
[1:29:29] church God not not only did he restore
[1:29:31] the word back he wasn't just restored
[1:29:34] back what Luther had what Wesley had
[1:29:36] what all that was lost but in this age
[1:29:38] we not only get it all back but we get
[1:29:40] everything plus amen thankful for that
