here's my need i pray that you'd come and meet it this morning we want to just turn our eyes to him right now let's sing this together morning i see you in the sunrise every morning it's like a picture that you painted for me a story i could have had i could have had a really different story but you came down from heaven to restore me for and i worship you as long as i am breathing god you are faithful and true and nobody loves me you're breaking down my why don't you raise your hands [Music] and nobody loves me like god you are faithful and true nobody loves me again and nobody loves me like you love me jesus [Music] god you are faithful and true and nobody loves me like you do let's sing that verse now mountains you're breaking [Music] my mind [Music] i'm nobody loves me like you love [Applause] [Music] me as long as i am breathing god you are faithful and true nobody loves me like you amen morning noon and night nobody loves me like jesus amen we're happy to have you all here in the house of god today amen i hope you uh are comfortable in the new seating arrangement we had a need to put more chairs out we were a little crowded on the sundays and so came up with this idea in order to accommodate more chairs but also leave plenty of leg room for a little bit of distancing we want to carry on with that and so this was the one i come up with that got approved by the design committee chief so uh i appreciate her signing off on it and that's not sister debbie by the way it's second in command sister rachel so amen praise the lord we we're happy to have her help in these things she's got some great ideas for things that we want to do plan uh plan to do coming up amen good to have brother dawn sister mary still here with us brother don's going to be ministering for us wednesday and boy are you in for a treat i gotta i thought well if the lord don't change him i got a little taste of some of his material and ministers breakfast yesterday and it's gonna be really delicious amen now of course that's subject to change preach you don't get to decide that right brother don we have to we get our we get we don't get to decide what we say we don't get to decide what we think i've had the lord rebuke me openly for things he wouldn't rebuke you at all for and he would say to me no no you don't get to do that you see that laity mike can put move do get away with that but you're you're an officer you've been selected you've been reserved unto my service and you don't get to think your thoughts and speak your words and do your ideas so boy it in one way it's a little bit makes you a little anxious but in the second way it's a great piece once you learn to slip into that slipstream and just glide with it amen then you fear nothing really because you know that the never failing presence of jesus christ is with you amen as long as you're in in duty for him and you're nothing hindering uh in your life and you're on the word and you're operating by divine commission there's no power in hell that can stop you and so you take great confidence in that i have tremendous confidence in the word of god today to meet every need that you have and then some and say well and then some yeah because there's needs you don't yet know you need amen but the word has a way of pointing it out and preparing you for what you might face before you can get back to church again amen god bless you we're going to invite you to second timothy chapter four thanks to all the music and the wonderful singing and worship sure appreciated that got a number of prayer requests that were sent to me personally i want to take up um as we as we go to prayer second timothy chapter four and we're just going to catch two verses there in seven and eight let me give you these prayer requests i have a request to continue um we want to continue to pray for our brother joe carter he gave me an update this morning both doctors feel that my lung condition is still not in shape to do open heart surgery i have been put on two different medications to try to improve my lung condition at the end of the day my cardiologist believes that we have no choice but to do the bypass okay well there's a doctor that's higher than that cardiologist all right no problem if that's the lord's way no problem we don't fear the devil amen um lord willing this next six weeks of medicines will improve my lung condition so right now we have to put it off by six weeks stay oxygenated stay medicated we'll we'll be doing bi-weekly visits with doctors amen now we started agreeing with our brother joe for his complete deliverance and i don't intend to change nothing i believe we're going to continue to believe for everything amen sister chastity writes in for a couple good friends i would like to ask for the church to pray oh one is her sister uh cindy wood she is having a liver ultrasound on tuesday at 11 her labs came back very bad and they are worried about liver damage my she's only 31. also please pray for a friend named donna huff her liver also is failing she's now in hospice and only a few weeks to live i believe god can still perform miracles i think we'd say amen to that and her family needs prayers during this time um so also so brother anthony and sister amber are not here today and i was i told brother anthony i'd leave it up to him but i think he wants all of us to pray and uh sister amber seems to have uh the asymptomatic um positive covid test and she took three different ones they all came back positive she's asymptomatic completely he's not sick at all but um that then is going to cancel there it had a big anniversary trip planned and and now they're going to have to delay that and uh and so it throws a wrench in church schedule and so how many pray for sister amber the whole family amen we don't want to see that move any further than that and just arrest the devil on the spot amen amen the devil never comes along quietly so the lord don't even worry about it he just walks up and slams him and cuffs him and hauls him off amen so i want to see that done for our sister amen all right that's all the prayer requests i have we'll pray for these once we go to prayer also could we pray for the saints in india brother samson shetty who you all know has ministered here for us numerous times lovely brother and in fact as we actually sent some money out of our bethel tabernacle missions to through brother ernie they were trying to finish up their church and so we gave them a nice chunk of cash to try to get it finished they're very very close and so they're very grateful to you as an assembly there's other assemblies that donated as well and i wanted to be a part of that brother samson is a good friend so but he wrote to me and said and you might have seen it in the news there's a second and third wave hitting india and it's overwhelming their health care system thousands are dying daily uh throughout they're even i even seen they're trying to some unrest maybe unseat the prime minister because of it and so brother samson said please pray for him his family's church and all the saints pastors and churches throughout the entire country how many will do that this morning amen all right second timothy chapter four verses seven and eight paul says in verse seven i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith boy that's three big check check marks isn't it i'd like to check all three of those boxes amen amen i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness so it paid off fighting pays finishing your course pays all right keeping the faith pays henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to and not to me only but unto all unto them also that love his appearing i you know i i think today that one of the things that i can declare in perfect faith because perfect faith's a revelation that's not human faith you need human faith remember just the right mental human mental attitude toward aiding promise of god to bring it to pass now if human faith can accomplish that how much greater is god's perfect revelation of faith and you know i i am a christian by perfect faith perfect faith's not something we're waiting on you if you're born again you've already exercised it because you've passed from death to life and that was a revelation of jesus christ personally to you amen so you want to have um a perfect revelation and i have a perfect revelation and here's something else that i have a perfect revelation of when christ appeared in this day i loved it and i love it and i will keep on loving it i can't not love it it's part of me it's impossible to not love it i i often loathe me and sometimes you get under my skin but i love his appearing amen and it's my hope it's my belief that because of his appearing then i'll be okay and you'll be okay amen we're gonna be okay friends amen we're gonna get a victory and so today i want to speak on a true love for god i had to do something today i don't think i ever remember doing from the back office i was listening to the sunday school class and i had to intentionally cut it off because brother matt was starting to say some things that were getting a little too close to my material and i didn't i didn't want to so i just cut it off amen so amen i want i want you know this just shows me the mind of god working in perfect continuity in his word so let's pray and let's remember our needs here this morning master we thank you for the reading of your word lord there's a great blessing in reading your word there's a great blessing in even hearing it read father we've even lord i i've challenged the the youth group to join me in a bible reading club and many of them lord eagerly and enthusiastically have signed on and are ready now to take their mornings and evenings and spend that quiet hour one in the morning and one in the evening pull away from some of their uh other extraneous stuff just stuff that occupies us technology and stuff and they've decided i'm going to pull away and i'm going to find a quiet place for an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening and i'm just going to read my bible not trying to memorize it not trying to study it i'm just gonna read it father what a glorious crop you can grow from that kind of seed being planted in their hearts master how silly it would be for a farmer to expect a crop when he never planted any seed and yet people all the time they want the peace of god they want that peace that passes understanding they want to have faith for healing they want to have blessings on their finances they want to have this they want to have that they want this that and the other and and they want a crop and they've never sowed seed they've never planted any seed so lord if we want those characteristic attributes of god to if we want us to live under those benefits of of every redemptive blessing under those seven compound redemptive names if we want that active in our lives then we've got to sow the seed of the word in our heart then that grows the crop and it's nature it's not even something we have to force it to happen it just works that way so lord i appreciate their their enthusiasm and their zeal and many have even told me they haven't even yet got signed up but they're planning to do that and so even some of the even some of the adults lord and i just appreciate that we're in treacherous times and we need the love of god shining in our hearts we need to have that peace that passes all understanding flowing through us i pray lord that there will be a blessing upon reading your word as you promised and upon hearing your word and lord we we are asking prayer continued where we want to make a declaration that we are still standing by the promise for our brother joe lord we're adding these needs that sister chastity has put in this morning we're thinking of the brothers and sisters in india lord we're remembering our sister amber and the family there father we're standing on the promises of god to believe that every promise is yea and amen and can be appropriated with per with faith in the word of god nothing wavering master we commit now this service into your hand you see there's much on my mind in my heart but i i want to uh if you want to set any everything aside and just let me preach the main kernel that's perfectly fine with me lord i don't make these decisions that's up to you so i just commit myself to you surrendering get out of the way put all my life under the blood lord as far as i know i'm certainly no secret sinner and as far as i know my whole life is under your blood and if if there's anybody in here today that would have a hindrance in their life may they quickly commit it to the to the cleansing power in the blood of the lamb grant it lord we wouldn't want anything to hinder your word it's too vital it's too needed the the age is too treacherous the time is too perilous lord and we we dare not uh miss a movement of the holy spirit so i pray that your great blessing will be upon it today these are your people feed them lord as you so faithfully always do we commit it to you in jesus name amen god bless you as you're seated all right now i want you to turn with me if you will also this morning while you're seated to the fifth chapter of the book of revelation and re the book of revelation especially this uh this fifth chapter um and as you know as we've taught you many times you i realized that translators hundreds of years later separated the fourth and fifth chapter but they're actually they were a single event uh that john is recording and that becomes apparent when you read four verses one and two and then just jump down to five and read verse one and you'll see that it's just all one single event now i want to make this case we're going to catch uh revelation 5 1 and 2 for the brother matt and i i want you to to think about this for a moment let me make this statement so this sequence of events particularly here in chapter 5 and by extension chapter 4 and brother branham talks about and calls this time a setting of judgment now you have to be careful and not read well this is pr this is particularly true of the whole book of revelation but you got to really be careful in this fifth chapter to not lay the events out linearly as in the order that you read them because if you do that then then you're going to fall into the trap that some have fallen into saying well now that the seals are open which come in chapter 6 and 7 and then chapter 8 for the seventh seal you're going to say well it's obvious that mercy's over when the seals were opened you know 50 plus years ago but but you'd be wrong that's not that's not true see and so so you you have to place it correctly just as brother branham placed it so correctly i i so appreciated a statement brother jd made yesterday we were talking about you know the how that that god has established things you know in the word of god for our daily lives and you know people can sometimes argue over the most silly things and brother jd was telling me you know here some preachers i think abroad and overseas are trying to argue to say you know this whole idea about a woman not cutting her hair and there are you know they're just and you got some preachers saying man let's move on to perfection that's already that's already settled law that's already judicially noticed by god as established law that's what that's what i was telling you know my daughter my daughter my granddaughter and i were having a wonderful discussion on that and i said you know it's interesting honey people who women who who say oh i've left the message now uh i'm not under william branham's bondage i can cut my hair now which is what they all do they cut their hair and put on britches and i said you know sweetie isn't it amazing that that that that neither one of those are william branham doctrine they're not going to have to face william branham at the judgment bar the woman not putting on a garment that pertains to a man is a moses doctrine and and a woman not cutting her hair is a paul st paul doctrine and it's already established law and paul said as also saith the law so so you know the these things are not to be uh argued over it's already established it's already set let's move on to perfection don't argue with the word don't don't strain you know people uh you know they they they strain at a gnat and swallow a camel it's it's you know the devil will just run you in circles doing that you know holiness and and sanctified lives is as well established we're not here to debate it if people don't want to live it then fine see how that works out for you and so you know good luck with that is all i can say so at the day of judgment i mean what are they going to say to paul oh i didn't believe it because william branham taught it paul's going to say excuse me i authored those words william branham was a restoration prophet that simply brought you back to my teaching amen aren't you glad there's no more guesswork amen it's got judicial notice everything in the word of god has been judicial notice is when you know when the when the legislature passes a law and a governor or president signs it in but then the courts have to interpret it and once the courts have have made that interpretation that then that's judicial notice that means you can't argue it anymore it's already been settled in the courts and so so we find that that god you know comes here and in the book of revelation chapter 5 and he says i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and of course brother branham is going to give this book a title and he's going to call it a book of redemption see the book of redemption and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice this is not the mighty angel of revelation 10 that's christ this is a strong angel standing with john that john later three different times tried to worship and three different times he said hey don't do that i'm just a mortal prophet i'm not i'm not that kind of angel i'm not a heavenly creature i'm an earthly man like you i'm of your brethren just call me brother you know don't try to make more out of me than then god god has already made my life plenty i don't need you to make any more of it john and so so this strong angel is proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof now you know i i want you to think about my title about what is a a true love for god because we read paul's saying that that there's a crown of righteousness laid up for me now you could stand here all day long and be happy for paul but that wouldn't do you any good except he closed it out by saying oh by the way not just me but all of you who like me love his appearing so i'm in you're in aren't you happy to be in and so so we realized then that you know the the the brother branham would have a lot to say about this fifth chapter and i don't want to get bogged down into a bible study this morning but i i just want to make a few points as we move along so you you're gonna come in fact is we're so we're gonna talk about today you know about this true love of god because i you know i i've i've you've had so many people misunderstand first of all they misunderstand god's love and they also consequently misunderstand their own love for him and so i i've had people in my life stand there i remember on a job site one time and and the superintendent you know and he's part of some denominational church great big mega church and we're just standing there talking about the gospel and i mean i it was he was turning the air blue with language it was horrifying now even today it almost be common street language language but back in the in the late 80s like that it was terrible i couldn't believe the the guttural mouth that he had and then you know and then we start talking about the lord and about salvation about the end of the world and he just says oh i know i'm saved i was like okay okay i'm not sure i know but i'm glad you feel like you know and so you know i i and so i just said well you know it really has very little to do with feelings i said it's easy to identify you know what you believe a lot of times what you think as you know there is a way that seemeth right to a man and it ends up being death so really there needs to be some kind of an evidence if you say i'm a christian and brother branham i love his homespun way my goodness i love brother branham for that reason because he just he just uses nature and the simple things and keeps you in sometimes in ankle deep water he'd take those theologians who would love to get him out in deep water and use greek words and hebrew words on him and you know he'd have to have jack with him and kick him under the table and all that kind of stuff but brother branham would just stay around in the shallows he'd get around those doctors of divinity i need to start talking about nature start talking about a cow eating grass or fish you know said you know if they're not eating the fish won't be eating and he you know he starts talking about god and starts talking about an apple tree and how the sap goes down and you know what happens you you want to argue with it but you can't because you know what he's saying is true you'd be a to deny it nature all nature does indeed run in continuity and so you know brother branham would just would just have this homespun way of saying you know if i say i'm a christian then i'll have the life of christ if i said i had the life of of john dillinger wouldn't i carry guns and rob banks if i said i had the life of harry houdini and me wouldn't i be an escape artist and a magician and a performer well and yes oh yeah that's right you would that makes sense gee oh well if i say i have the spirit of christ won't i finish it for me you know won't i have that life of christ and and then you know and so you just try to very gently you know point that out and people you just then you get the deer in the headlights or they don't want to talk anymore or sometimes they go you know that's right tell me more and so you never know so you just you just scatter the seed and you just always be ready to give an account you don't have to be a deep theologian and just stay around in the simple love of god and try to get people to understand what the what it really means to love god amen i've had people say you know i i don't know about all these mysteries and seals i just love jesus and i just always say well which one well there is only one not according to paul paul said my fear is that you'll fall for another jesus who i haven't preached he'll be different than the one i'm preaching but he'll claim to be the same guy and you'll fall for it and it's just man-made organization and theory but it's not the living word that i'm preaching and and this is this was paul's fear and it's a valid fear because as you see today the overwhelming overwhelming staggeringly overwhelming majority of christianity in the world today is in love with the wrong one and they say i love jesus but they actually don't love this because this begins to tell them about their life and that's where they that's a full stop they don't want to have those things they don't want anybody messing with their life i'm here to tell you something friend when i got a revelation of jesus christ personally to me the first thing i realized is i didn't want to be me anymore i wanted to be him i mean if you say i've had a revelation of jesus christ personally and you still want to stay you no you ain't had a revelation of the person i've had because when i saw who he was i realized how bad and foul i was i said lord i don't want to be me i want to be you see and that's a real sign of real revelation so so we find out that you know brother branham's standing here when when brother branham was in the breach and i'm not going to read it i have some quotes here before me but trying to save some time and i'm coming to something so just please bear with me i some of what i'm saying is rudimentary and elementary to you but please just bear with me because i want to get to get to where my heart is so i just want to build you along the way as we go and make points as the lord leads me so we find then that that that as we come forward brother branham when he's reading the very passage that you just read with me that brother branham suddenly something comes over him and he begins to identify himself with that strong angel indirectly you see and he says oh maybe i'm just feeling it this way but then he cries out let him come see because that was an anointing on brother branham now and brother branham would say and then brother branham watch this brother brandon would even go on to say let him now come or forever hold his peace what where where huh oh it must be in the old testament no you understand now watch watch now that's not that's not different than if you go to zechariah and you look at chapters 3 and 4 and you find you remember i've preached on it where the high priest joshua the high priest is standing there and he's representing all of israel all of god's elected family because the high priest there's no need to have everybody there only the high priest would be necessary the high priest is on trial the devil is suing the devil is suing in god's court the enemy's standing there to resist the whole the whole thing is that israel is god's chosen people and the devil is suing and saying no no no let me tell you something the way they act there's no way they can be your people because what i see here is not what i see in your word lord and there's no way that you can let them be your people and you remember the story that god and that was true he had the video evidence he had dna he had everything forensics to prove that israel was indeed guilty of all that and god dismissed from his throne seated as in the book of daniel dismiss the charge based on one simple thing election amen and he rebukes the charges and rebukes the devil and says is not who do you think you're accusing here this is my people whom i have chosen you got there is don't you know satan there is now therefore no condemnation possible to them which are in christ they've passed from death into life they came out of me they're a part of me they're coming back to me and no mistake they make it no accusation you have will ever change that amen because they're a product of my love and they love me by a revelation they can't even fully explain to you they can't even fully explain all the time to themselves why they just keep holding on sometimes they get so discouraged and i watch them from my throne and they get so discouraged they fail they stumble they're almost ready to walk away and i just say to an angel run down there and drop them a little handful of purpose and encourage them and let them know to keep pressing keep pressing i'm gonna get them i'm gonna fix it don't worry hallelujah he's got this whole thing under his control there's there's no weapon formed against you that can prosper hope in the lord see amen i shall yet worship him in his tabernacle the devil can't stop that he ain't nobody i tell him all the time satan you ain't nobody you don't run nothing but your mouth you're in control of me i don't live my i'm not living but by your mercy i live by the mercies of christ if the lord allows you to put me in a trial then blessed be the name of the lord i'm not going to give the devil credit or credence or not signing a treaty with him i don't need a deal forget it get away i want nothing to do with you satan and so we find out that that brother now and then and then what happens to zechariah zechariah is watching that and you know what happened he got excited like you did when he saw that god dismissed all that charge and literally brought he said and the lord said bring forth clean garments and take these filthy garments in other words everything that's wrong in his life take it off and put on clean garments of mine of purity and when he done that then brother branham then then zechariah started jumping them down off from the side watching it take place writing it down and zechariah just like brother branham let him now come or forever hold his peace why did i say that zechariah did the same thing like put a fair miter on his head everybody's like do what uh put a fair miter on his head did i say that out loud and and the lord says the prophet spoke it let's do it and the next thing you know they bring a miter and set it on his head why because that's why brother brandon would say i don't call you church anymore i call you bright because you've been you've been anointed you've been positionally placed you've got a a a robe of cleanness and a crown of authority to speak the word don't let a devil hinder you don't give him quarter don't don't do anything wipe him out you say well you know he he's bigger than me look it's never had anything to do with the size of the dog in the fight it's the amount of fight in the dog i've seen i've seen house cats run big dogs down the street why because that cat was protecting a little toddler here comes a a dog looked like a pit bull after the little toddler and the cat attacked him and the dog ran oh tell you something friends don't fear the devil take faith take courage do like david brother branham said when david went after that lion and that bear he knew he couldn't he's a little skinny boy he's only got a slingshot he's only got a slingshot see but brother but brother brahm said david just prayed and said now lord my dad put me here to watch these sheep and that bear took one i'm going after it you better help me and and away he went and he went after the lion and when the lion turned he tore him to pieces i'll tell you something friends there there's there there is no nothing can hinder a man or a woman who will have faith in god's word and go forward confessing all things that all things are possible to them that believe this is what this is what the opening of the seals restored back to us the whole thing was not to make you a mystery not to make me a mystery preacher are you a mystery believer you know some dark it's not even a mystery once you're brought into it and then you see it it's not a mystery to you anymore but but it's only a mystery when you're on the outside looking in it looks mysterious looks cultish but it's not once you come in once you come in you realize it's the light of the shekinah glory shining all around you you realize that every devil is subject to you at that point see and and and you're you need that that god opened these seals because he knew that in this day and hour that you live in you're gonna need what's in those seals to be unlocked you're gonna face an age that is unprecedented and unparalleled you're gonna face the dual convergence of the days of noah and the days of lot simultaneously as brother diggs was preaching you're under a simultaneous two-front attack you're totally surrounded i remember i think he was the the guy who invented the rangers and i'm pretty sure our special force i can't remember he's one of the early guys and they and they they in a battle one time they said to him said chief said we're completely surrounded and he said good he said they won't get away from us this time just shoot any direction boys you hit somebody and so you know he he relished the idea of being surrounded now we got him right where we want them what yeah they won't get away now and so so so we find that god knew the hour that you would face you would need a complete restoration of the word of god amen you'd need to know how to walk in an age of complete darkness and a gross darkness on the people and such a blending of of light and darkness where it's simultaneously the darkest day ever and simultaneously the brightest time ever for god's family but the command was arise shine thy light is come so the light is above you you can't stay here living a carnal earthbound life and hope to have that light to guide you you got to come up out of this dark age come up into the realms of the holy spirit and then you'll see clearly if you don't have that friend you're finished you're finished you'll you'll never find your way through this groping darkness and that's why the world uh as the bible said loses its ability to the end time even to discern right and wrong and so you say well how does people come up with these laws these days because they're in that gross darkness say well why do i see that it's wrong because you've come into light see it's not complicated and so so we find that you know brother bradham is crying out you know let him come now or forever hold his peace and brother bradham goes on to describe what that's all about and he he began to he began to say to the people that nobody was worthy even to look at the book let alone to take it and break the seals he says then where's your pope and where does all these come in and your bishops and where's your worthiness we're nothing that's right see and so so we realized then that that no one can do it and the angel is calling for a kinsmen redeemer to appear and so so so we realize that this is a an epic moment this is not something to to just pass off lightly you know that this is why you should have a diet in the word of god this is why you should come to church this is why you should have fellowship with the saints this is why you come to the lord's table sure because you're a part of it i i remember i i remember our good friend brother eugene eugene brown in canada and he was teaching here the other day it's not in my notes but it's noteworthy i think i'll just repeat it that he was teaching on communion and coming to the lord's table and he says sometimes parents who have completely broken relationships with their children or their spouse or both and he said they come into my office for counseling and he said they try to start immediately talking about their problem he says let's stop he says first we gotta we gotta figure out where you are he says when's the last time you stood at the lord's table and took the bread and the wine with your family and washed the saints feet and he says the most peculiar look is that he says a father or a mother will look at him and go what does that have to do with the relationship with my children and he says it has everything to do with it he says if your relationship if you're never there at the lord's table and your relationship with god is that messed up and then you question why your relationship with your kids are messed up really you wonder why your relationship with your wife and children is messed up and you got that kind of a messed up relationship with god and you wonder why i'm asking the question amen see you wouldn't you might wouldn't think about that but that's and when he said i thought my goodness that is perfectly according to the scriptures this is what jesus had this is what adam lost was that relationship that fellowship with god and there are people who never come to the lord's table intentionally wait for it to be announced don't come to church why are you saying all this please move on i can't sorry there are people who never come i'm trying to lighten you up y'all are gonna lock up on me here and put you in the vapor lock i mean i have to tell you a joke and loosen you up a little bit there but but it's true there are people who never this is not in my notes friends there are people who never come to the lord's table never watch the saint there are people who never pay tithes and brother eugene taught on that and he said look at the relationship that abraham had with melchizedek he paid a tithe 10 of everything he owned and gave and i remember brother biscuits said years ago he said i mean he gave him 10 of his cattle 10 of his camels 10 of his sheep 10 of his oxen he says i don't even know what happened to those 10 of those animals where'd they go when melchizedek disappeared he'd take him home with him i don't know we'll find out but but he said that that that paying ties was indicative of his relationship it showed what he thought about his friendship with melchizedek the lord's table the lord's supper shows and then people wonder why they're they have these strains in their relationship with their friends and their spouse and their children and and and and they never seem to have victory in their life friends it's not rocket science it's the simple gospel see and so you know like we were saying earlier when we first started here about people arguing over silly nonsense of the word straining at a gnat to swallow a camel i got to move on please let me move on so the prophet now brother branham is going to go in and spend a lot of time and he's going to labor in the word of god to show you that the claiming of this book remember this is not to educate you with theology and make you mysterious i'm simply telling you why god had to people who don't want the seals they don't want a prophet they don't want a message then you have no chance because the god sent this message and opened these seals to do what restore back to the church everything that adam lost everything adam lost is restored in christ you say but that happened at calvary that's true and it went into the church and they had the jubilee and they had the abstract and they wrote a book of acts but then that church backslid fell away the disciples died off and they went into the dark ages and how we finally arrive at a church in the last day that they can't even go in the rapture and they can't get any better i mean think that through for a minute churches who preach the name of jesus and nobody in those systems can even get ready to go in a rapture under that amen under that in effect now i'm not don't don't misunderstand i'm not saying calvary got undone i'm saying in effect remember jesus said by your traditions you made the word of god no effect in that vein in effect the church of the last days back to pre-calvary they're back to pre-calvary in effect they might as well be they can't get they can't go in the rapture they can't improve see that's why god called a church out of a church said because they kicked christ out how are they going to give you eternal life if they kick out the giver of eternal life say oh we haven't kicked him out they they haven't kicked their their statues out they haven't kicked their crucifix out of their church they haven't kicked their stories of 2000 years ago but they have they have rejected this and put christ out how are they going to be born again therefore my brother my sister the path to back to have everything restored that adam lost and that calvary secured is to come back to the word so that it can be a bleeding word for you amen now how important is this message to you [Music] now how important is it see you sure you want to trivialize its teachings you're sure you want to just kind of weigh them as a good uh just an opinion and and i know brother branham said i shouldn't do that or do this but you know i i don't know i i kind of think that's just his opinion be careful be careful this was a man who spent 50 percent of his life in the presence of this kind of light tell me last time you did that come what was that so we find then that that it's amazing because now watch this here's here's an an amazing point once you go past revelation 5 with a closed book then you come to revelation 10 and now it's an open book and christ has stepped out of eternity claim it loose the seals broke them off himself what is it friends what's the opening of the seals the mighty god unveiled now now i can explain to you who is this melchizedek see before it was unclear it wasn't even clear what all that meant you know jesus is the son of god and he's one with the one with the father and the best we had was a oneness ideology until the seals are open and now where and it's an open door started at the end of philadelphia and moved into laodicea into the azusa revival but but it but that was just a very narrow view there the mighty god had to be unveiled because you've got to become like him god's not interested in you becoming like a denomination they're not going in the rapture i'm not saying individuals in it can't be called out of there to go into rapture that's still happening but i'm talking about god's not rapturing a system he's rapturing individuals who have who have believed the report and have accepted the life of christ in their life and are living and allowing the word to live through them if you're not allowing the word to live through you the token is not on display it doesn't it it negates what you believe see because in order to go you the token has to be on display and that's not going to happen if you haven't surrendered so why don't god just force me he's never going to do that you've got to surrender the bride hath made herself ready see so we humble ourselves and so we find then after you after you leave this area then you notice in in chapter 10 now it's an open book given to the prophet give it to the people tell them to eat it yeah go and ask for it here it is eat it you must prophesy see that that ministry the son of man's got to continue even after the office of the son of man leaves the ministry of the son of man was a different thing has to continue it's got to be restored that's what they had in the book of acts that's what we got to have in the omega the same thing they had in the alpha right amen so we find that that that book you're not going to see that anymore you're not going to read about that little book anymore because why that book has now been consumed and assimilated and it's now standing in a people amen so so all right let's think about our bibles for a moment so here comes here comes the angel of the lord to mary hail mary they are highly favored and you're going to bring forth a son now what is he doing he's quoting prophecy and you're going to call his name and he's going to be save his people he's a manual and you're going to call his name jesus and and and mary mary says well how's this even gonna work i'm i'm a virgin i know no man but now watch here's the point here's a point i want you to get what had been declared was already written you understand it was already in the bible god's not being redundant when he starts quoting the word already written to mary he's not just filling up the air with words or being redundant or speaking for no purpose but you have to understand that the written word is not designed to stay written word that written word has got to come into flesh and become a manifestation and so he's bringing the word to a human girl who's going to say amen to every word i don't know how it'll happen but you said it i believe it amen to the word of god and you know what happened without knowing a mortal man she conceived a child and had a baby why because the word became flesh amen so that you don't read about the book anymore why because the book has now been taken the book is now assimilated the book is now living behind the skin of god's bride in the earth and she and that's that's why she has thus saith the lord or she keeps still in other words it's the only thing she has to say she's not interested anymore in propagating man-made theory the only time you hear me preaching is thus saith the lord i'm not preaching baptist theology anymore if i don't have thus saith the lord to preach i won't preach you follow me so she has thus saith the lord or she keeps quiet see she knows what god wants done with his word and so as we unite then with this word then we are uniting with the lamb uh and that's the marriage the marriage remember is here because you're uniting with the lamb in his word and you go to the wedding supper amen so we find that it's not just becoming theologically more astute or more wise or whatever it's far more than that this is a living word so christ then uh that living logos that we are now being united to and and and it's and it's literally uh brother bradham would use a word that webster don't even like uh you know that that the the the bride is now impregnated she's she's pregnanted with the word of god she has his kentucky language he's pregnanted with the word of god what's it doing bringing forth the life of the son of god in her life see and so so you you find that that the trumpet has sounded you you read that in revelation 1 revelation 4. there's a couple other places throughout but you remember that john said i heard behind me something that sounded like a trumpet talking to me see and so this is a voice that sounded like a trumpet because what is coming into the church is the jubilee that's the trumpet it's the jubilee that's what christ his death his burial his resurrection his ascension sending his life back into the church and now the church has the jubilee israel waited for and rejected amen israel rejected it as a nation and so then so now the church uh the holy ghost filled church now they have the abstract they have the jubilee they have the title book it's all unsealed and opened but the bible was never sealed to paul you understand it got sealed because the church fell away and there was no and just like the cherubim who chased adam and eve out of the garden of eden unless they put forth their hand to the tree of life and and live forever in a fallen condition so god has got to seal up the word he can't allow that that jubilee token any longer it now becomes a dip it's proportionate to the light they have it comes all the way down to the end time to do what be open back and be restored back to bring a people back to the original and here we are and we're it you're it see and so so we find then that we've been united to it so you know they they asked jesus about the kingdom you know when he was on the on the mount before he went up he says now that's going to come the father has that in his plans don't worry about it here's what here's what you need to worry about go until you be endued with power from on high and then you're going to become a witness to me in jerusalem judea samaria another part of the earth so what you're going to find out is the kingdom is coming we are headed for a millennium but in the interim between now and then the kingdom of god is actually going to be in you you understand and the and so the millennium is just simply a completion of this whole process that's why the holy ghost is called an earnest see it's an earnest of your inheritance you've got a new body coming how do i know because i already got a new soul already got a new nature and it's going to give me a new body a new spirit a new mind it's going to make all things new see and so so we find out that that that the kingdom uh is working within us so now and we were talking about this uh yesterday brother jason and i and brother don because when you go back jesus in luke 4 9 give me 4 9 brother matt saint luke chapter 4 verse 9 and you're going to find here where jesus is going back to quote uh the scripture uh we'll get in a second here i just want to i just want you to stay with me and i'm trying to watch my time i should be able to finish up here just in a minute and he brought him to jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down from hence all right next for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee carry on and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against the stone jesus answering and said in him it is said thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god and when the devil had ended all temptation he departed from him for a season now all right now jesus go back jesus returned and the power of the spirit in the galilee and there went out of fame throughout all the region round about all right now so here in luke chapter 4 i started too late where he starts showing him the kingdoms of the world and he said i'll give you all of these kingdoms and brother branham said jesus already knew he would come inherit them anyway so what satan was trying to do was give him a shortcut listen you don't have to die you don't need to suffer come on everybody loves you you're young you want to live who wants to suffer see and so so how about i just give it all to you for free now that would have been a deal almost too hard to pass up but jesus knew and if this don't make you love him i don't know what else to say jesus knew that if he took that deal you would be born in sin and stay in sin forever and at the end of your life with no chance about to get out of it satan would claim you and and christ the bible says that right at the time when he was suffering the bible says he shall see his seed and be satisfied here to tell you something friends christ rejected that offer in order to save you they said to him come down off the cross and save yourself but he knew that if he saved himself he couldn't save you and so he gave up his life freely and was tortured to death for you because he knew the grave couldn't hold him so we find then that that he he comes into the temple and and he's handed the scroll and he reads from the prophet that how that his ministry is to preach the acceptable year of the lord give me 4 19 uh this time brother matt let's catch that 4 9 luke 4 19. and i'll go back to 18. uh the spirit of the lord is upon me they've handed him the scroll because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor it set me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the blind set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord so you're so you're finding then that that jesus in his ministry is he's he's referring now back to the old testament jubilee i've i've come to take them out of prison i've come to heal them i've come to repair them i've come to set them at liberty and so this was the jubilee now in the jubilee if you go back to the book of leviticus you'll find three things happen first there had to be an atonement they had to take the bullock or whatever animal and they slew the and then sprinkle the blood and without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sins right so the blood had to be on the mercy seat if it didn't have blood on it it's a judgment seat you understand why people try to approach christ today and they only make they only end up getting worse because they're trying to approach god's mercy but they don't have the bleeding word and it's just a judgment word today why why can you have access to christ because you you have the blood the blood is speaking for you how did i get it because you believe the word and the word is a living word hallelujah it has life in it see a denomination can't bleed for you only the word can bleed for you and so so he's so they they had to have that atonement they had to put the blood on the mercy seat then they blew a trumpet and the trumpet second thing the trumpet was a jubilee trumpet and the third thing was every man could then go back to his original possessions he had lost him through debt through bad management through this through family tragedy through however he lost them but and he had to you know become sell himself as an indentured servant he had to mortgage his land and and and but now now we find out that there's blood atonement then a trumpet sounds then a jew then then that's a jubilee then every man can return to his possessions now it's exactly like that at calvary first there had to be the sacrifice amen and then what what did that do what did john hear in the revelation of jesus christ the very first chapter i heard behind me a trumpet what is it doing sounding a jubilee now what does that mean every man in god's family by the baptism of the holy ghost now he can go back to his possessions what possessions everything adam lost is now restored back to you and i and that grants to you the power of the spoken word it allows you to finally finally be free of yourself and live the kind of life god built you and ordained you to live you're free from the grip of it nobody can force you into it anymore everything adam lost is restored back to the church see so this is why mysteries are so important this is why the opening of the seals this is why brother diggs was preaching the way he preached wednesday night a little bit out of the ordinary for a wednesday night a little bit out of ordinary for brother cadre but he's beginning to show you what do you do take you right to the book of revelation to show you do you realize what has happened do you realize that you have been set apart now for the master that you're now an elect lady you're now his chosen you're you're you're the rapture material you're all we're doing brother bradham said i'm not looking for another revival he said i'm only looking for the coming of the lord what is the bride doing she's been laying in the presence of the sun we've been trying to find that last seed you know whether jd is over in the middle east or whether brother barry is in africa or or whether brother ernie's in the pacific islands it doesn't matter we're trying to find that last seed my friends and the bride is growing and maturing and growing and maturing and finding that last seed we're headed home and nothing nothing whatever can stop it and so many times that people they they they just don't see the need for it and i just think that's sad you know if you let me just let me just let me just finish up some statements here i'll just say it like this you know if you go to go to matthew 13. and we won't go there today but if you go into matthew 13 you'll find all the seven church ages laid out perfectly but lonnie taught me that years ago showed it to me so clearly verse by verse and all seven ages are laid out right there in matthew 13. now it's it's amazing because in matthew 13 you remember jesus gives all kinds of parables you know kingdom of heaven is like an unto the kingdom of heaven is likened to a man you know so defeat had found a pearl of great price sold everything he had bought the field the kingdom is like an unto a seed which though the smallest seed remember he said it grew into a great tree which the fowls of the air remember that mustard seed brother bam showed that that was at the end time that tree the fowls were demons and it grew into the beast system remember it started out so so just a little seed and that's the that's the mistake sometimes we make we look at something and go that's kind of small that might be but what might it grow into if you keep feeding on it you see why i'm trying to get the senior youth to start reading their bible what am i doing trying to make them smarter no i told them don't even try to memorize it or study it just read it because what am i doing it's getting the seed down into their heart it's giving god something to come along in water amen and when god starts to water it'll start growing a crop isn't that beautiful that's why when they asked brother adam how do i overcome he said simple read your bible and pray see there's more power in that than you can realize and so if you if you and so one of the parables jesus tells is the parable of the sower remember and he says um a man had a field sowed seeds and while he slept his enemy came remember that sowed tares and when they came up his servants said oh lord do you want us to pull him up he said no no it's all right it's cool let them grow together at the uh our harvest we'll separate it all and we'll take the we'll gather first thing we'll do is gather up the weeds and we'll bind them all together see and we'll burn them and then we'll take the the wheat and we'll we'll do what we'll do with that and then we'll take it to the barn okay perfect plan and and uh and the whole all the people round around they were satisfied with that you know you get home from church that day you went to hear pastor jesus and somebody say oh you went to his rival yeah i was at his rival what'd he preach on oh he preached on farming and he's pretty good yeah said some good things something about you know garner and wheat and burning and i don't know and there's some enemy that did something and the master was pretty chill about it and so i don't know [Laughter] but not the disciples when the disciples got him in closed doors they said lord we know there's more to this gospel than that we know that this gospel isn't just some fuzzy feel good love your neighbor pay your taxes we know that there's more to the gospel than that now tell us the meaning behind that parable you know what it turns out it turns out the field was the world it turns out that the good seed were the children of the kingdom and the one that sowed the tares was the devil and it grew a crop of devil-filled controlled people and it turns out that that little harmless gathering i will wait to the end turns out that was the end of the world this wasn't just some farming story he's not adding a chapter to the almanac this is the end of the world he's qualifying what everybody's got a question what's life all about what's the meaning of life here it is in this parable from genesis to revelation everything that god has ever done and every human here's the reason for it the field was the world the sower of the good seed was son of man but he had an enemy and he sowed also and don't worry at the end time i'll send forth and we'll bind up the tares and everybody thinks oh that doesn't sound very harmful until you realize that it's the world council of churches and the beast system gathering all of the denominations together binding them together which has to happen before the rapture before the grain goes to the granary before it goes to the garner the binding you say what's happening right now you're witnessing the binding the whole world is being bound say are we not caught up in it no why because we came out of her my people turns out that that that that sending the grain to the to the barn is the rapture and then it turns out whoa then that means the burning is the tribulation period and billions with the b will perish in the tribulation all the tares that are being bound they're being bound after the grain is taken in they go to the burning amen and people say that's that's ominous that's horrible but you know people always want to say god's not fair because nobody even has a chance except his elected family well that's not true that's not true i mean you say well nobody can even see it except his elected family what depends on how you qualify seeing there there are there's going to be millions of people in heaven that weren't in the message you understand we're not talking about in the royal city that's the bride but outside there will be millions of people there who were saved from destruction they weren't born again they had to be judged in matthew 25 and were granted eternal life but but they are safe from destruction you say because remember friend god gives everybody a legit chance even people who might not be in his elect family get a legit chance he gave cain a legit chance king could never get abel's revelation but god still offered him a way to save his life see pharaoh in egypt during he wasn't elected like abraham abraham was elected but when abraham backslid and as in and is done in egypt even the pharaoh at that time honored god and recognized him and and gave him back his wife and gave him all kinds of gifts and treasures and send him packing the king of philistia the the philistine king uh in guerrer recognized when he abraham lied to him that's my sister i'm gonna take her and marry her when god said you're finished if you do because that's his wife lord this lying prophet of yours told me it was his sister said well it's his wife and you better give her back or you're done lord you know i'm a righteous man i know you're a righteous man that's why i'm saving your life see paul said they all saw god just in nature i mean if you think about it god gave mankind the lowest bar that he could possibly give him just recognize god in nature just understand that that a tree drops its apples because winter's coming and the sap goes down but in the spring it comes back understand death burial and resurrection and you'll understand a little bit about christ and instead instead of receiving that low bar they turn him into reptiles and birds and creatures and they worship the creator my the creation more than the creator and paul said he's going to be just in destroying them because the son went up in the heavens every day and declared his glory [Music] every day they saw it and they denied his very existence and and even if they did accept his existence they deny any control over their lives you see you see my friends so god is not unjust but but that doesn't change the fact that god has sent a word and god has a family and i'm here to tell you something you're looking at a man today who is so grateful to god that when he appeared i loved it that's the real love of god that when god appeared i loved him i loved his word paul says that you were created in him that you were that those that you were predestinated that them that it was all those that he loved those are the ones that he called and ends up justifying it's all about the love of god and then then you and i i'm closing uh how's brother diggs i'm getting ready to close fit infinite clothes all right i really am for real and and god says now love one another with a fervent love think about that jesus comes with jesus comes to him with a principle about the kingdom and he starts talking about we often call it the golden rule and he says you know however you want to be treated by people you treat them how you want them to treat you and he says and then just in this is summed up all the law and the prophets see so that that's a principle of god now in the millennium that's going to be restored everybody in the millennium will treat each other like they want to be treated you understand that because that's what the law and the prophets is all about and god god has brought us to say i don't need you to wait till the millennium you have access to that kind of love now you have access to that kind of faith now you have access to this everything that adam lost you have it now you don't have to wait for a body change already demons are subject to you already you're a king over the flesh the devil the world in sin already there's no weapon formed against you that can prosper jesus would say to you today why do you doubt why do you fear believe god all things are possible to them that believe there is there is nothing that can derail god's plan of redemption in your life because that plan included you before the foundation of the world that same redemptive blessing that same position that adam enjoyed that's restored to us let's stand musicians come on back amen brother matt bring your team and come back and let's sing a song or two before we go amen praise the lord i still got lots i want to cover but we'll we'll catch it next time amen i'm looking forward to everything that god has in the millennium but i want to know lord how can i serve you right now you've called me to a great and shining light and i want to be a light to the world you know it's interesting that jesus talks about the eye you know and and and a lot of times when people talk about the lights the eyes being lamps they are they almost invariably think of it as coming this way that my eyes the gate to my soul and so if i look at the right things that image will come in and lighten my soul okay that's a valid point but in the majority in fact it's pretty much an overwhelming majority in the bible that that's that's not exactly what the eyes as light is really about that actually your lights are something to shine out light comes within you and shines out and jesus said let your light so shine that others may see see and so it's a it's a lot more than just having it come this way and we don't look at the wrong things because i want light to be in my but when you've got the love of god which is the light of god then that's then your light your eyes become headlights for the world your your eyes become lights for your family for your children for your friends for your parents for your spouses you're shining a light let your light shine this is the main order when you find that that parable in the scripture almost in every case with exception of a couple one or two maybe that i could even find it's it's not this way it's this way and that's really the point jesus is trying to to bring out is that your light that you shine forth can guide others how are you going to project light from within that you don't have you can only give out what you have within you can only project what's in you and if all that's in you is the gom that's an old-fashioned hillbilly word the muck and gom of the world we old carburetor days brother mark we know what a gummed up carburetor meant you had to get some they call it gum out and you had to spray it in a thing get all you know from the from the byproducts of the fuel and that thing would get sticky and you'd be under there revving it spraying in there trying to get it freed up and and and and if the if the the an engine only needs uh fire fuel and air and that's what makes a combustion engine go and if you get if you got a problem it's in one of those three it's either in no fire no fuel or no air i'm here to tell you something friends sometimes the world we feed on so much of the world our fuel is contaminated we breathe the wrong kind of air we get all gummed up we get all cont oh come on let's let's admit it today and say lord i need to be cleaned out i need to have the holy spirit come into my life and just flow and blow out all the carbon and the and the gum of the world

everywhere hands up all over this building my both hands up lord we want the clean cleansing of the holy spirit in our lives give us that which comes out of this open word to clean our hearts and clean our minds that we might be a light to the world and a light to our loved ones and shine the way that leads home [Music] master the ultimate light the ultimate light the bible talks and shows us in the book of revelation that the the source of the light comes from your throne so lord i just say to people listen just follow the light back to this source it'll lead you home if you just follow that light back to its source deny the world close your ears to the siren song of laodicea just follow the light find it and follow it back to the source you'll be standing in front of god master help us today in this sermon i'd i didn't preach it like i wanted but that's all right i preached it like you wanted it of that i'm sure [Music] i commit these people into your hands both the visible audience and those streaming i pray lord that the words reach down and have an effect in people's lives lord i know it will if they'll just accept it don't struggle with it the word's not made to be
