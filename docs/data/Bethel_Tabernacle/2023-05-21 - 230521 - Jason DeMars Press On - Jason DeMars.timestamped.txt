[42:51] and let us run with patience the race
[42:53] that is set before us looking unto Jesus
[42:56] the author and finisher or perfector of
[42:59] our faith who for the joy that was set
[43:02] before him endured the cross despising
[43:04] the shame and is set down at the right

[44:13] walk with God
[44:16] it is a it is a race there is a prize
[44:19] there is a goal there's there's a Mark
[44:21] that we're going towards and there's a
[44:25] way to go about this and this is the
[44:27] pitfalls that the Christian world ends
[44:29] up in all the time is they try to go
[44:33] after God and pursue this race according
[44:37] to their own way of thinking and own way
[44:39] of doing things we're not to do that
[44:41] were to lean not to our own
[44:44] understanding but in all our ways
[44:46] acknowledge Him and he'll direct our
[44:49] paths
[44:50] you know and so we look at this whole
[44:53] whole picture of the Christian walk and
[44:56] it can't be based on our own thinking
[44:59] it isn't going through the seven
[45:01] sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church
[45:03] that we run the Christian race it isn't
[45:06] by attending church
[45:09] regularly that's that's fine much of the
[45:12] world does that it doesn't doesn't mean
[45:14] you're saved it doesn't mean you have
[45:16] the Holy Ghost it doesn't mean you're
[45:17] following the word
[45:18] in your life it just means you go to a
[45:20] building and you attend a place
[45:23] it isn't looking the part
[45:25] it doesn't look like you look the part
[45:27] it isn't trying to fit in with the
[45:30] people around you or just do what the
[45:32] other people are doing
[45:34] but what it is a completely different
[45:36] thing it is a race that we are running
[45:38] and we have to do it according to the
[45:40] way God calls us to do it what is what
[45:43] does he say looking unto Jesus not
[45:46] looking under the church
[45:49] not looking unto the fivefold ministry
[45:51] though we thank the Lord for that and
[45:53] Jesus puts himself on display through
[45:55] that but that's not what it says here it
[45:57] says looking unto Jesus
[45:59] looking unto the word men will fail men
[46:03] will make mistakes
[46:05] men will disappoint you even if they did
[46:07] nothing wrong they might disappoint you
[46:08] anyway because your expectations are
[46:11] wrong
[46:12] and so we're not to look to men to meet
[46:14] our needs or look to Jesus
[46:17] he's our example
[46:19] now each of us is to live as an example
[46:21] and to not put a stumbling block in
[46:23] front of other people but ultimately
[46:25] we're not look I'm not looking to
[46:27] Brother Brad maybe Brother Brad uh makes
[46:30] a mistake should I follow brother Brad's
[46:32] mistake
[46:33] no we just say God bless brother Brad we
[46:36] pray for Brother Brad and we keep moving
[46:39] forward
[46:40] put any name in there brother Jason
[46:42] brother Matt brother this brother Jason
[46:45] whoever you might look at though they
[46:47] might fail they might make a stick
[46:49] mistake but we're to look to Jesus
[46:52] the author and finisher of our faith
[46:56] who for the joy
[46:58] that was set before him
[47:01] endured the cross despising the shame
[47:04] and is set down at the right hand of the
[47:06] Throne of God the whole process there we
[47:08] have
[47:09] the Lord Jesus
[47:11] he was he was rejected right
[47:14] so we're to look to him what are we
[47:16] looking at him for
[47:18] just to look at him
[47:20] just look at it
[47:22] no
[47:23] it's not just look at it there's an
[47:25] example there's something we're supposed
[47:26] to see and then something that we're
[47:29] supposed to emulate
[47:30] something that we're supposed to walk
[47:32] according to
[47:33] he suffered he was rejected he didn't
[47:36] like it he despised it
[47:39] but he he was given a reward
[47:42] for his obedience
[47:45] you know sometimes as Christians we look
[47:48] at it and we say well we have to follow
[47:49] our duty
[47:51] we have to do our duty regardless true
[47:55] and yet God continuously through the
[47:58] scriptures points out to us and shows us
[48:00] that there is actually a reward
[48:03] for following his word
[48:06] and he uses it as a motivation for us
[48:10] for Godly living there is a reward seek
[48:14] after that right there's heaven really
[48:18] ultimately there's a new body and
[48:20] there's a new Heaven and a new Earth
[48:21] this is our ultimate reward
[48:24] and a position and a place of rulership
[48:27] in in that new kingdom New Kingdom
[48:29] that's set up and so this is what we
[48:33] should be living for this should be
[48:34] motivating us this should be driving us
[48:37] forward in our life
[48:40] amen but there is also a way to seek
[48:42] after that that is right and a way to
[48:45] seek after that that is wrong
[48:48] now let's go to Philippians
[48:52] chapter
[48:53] 3
[48:54] I sure hope brother Tony brings me that
[48:56] water soon
[49:01] Paul is speaking of his testimony and
[49:05] we're going to read these the verses
[49:07] that precede this later
[49:09] uh to to fill in the point but Paul is
[49:12] speaking of his testimony speaking about
[49:14] the fact that it is righteousness that
[49:16] comes by the Faith of Christ and not by
[49:19] the law not by obedience to the law
[49:22] and the that the purpose of this faith
[49:25] is that he would know Christ
[49:28] in the power of his resurrection and the
[49:32] fellowship of his sufferings
[49:34] being made conformable to his death
[49:38] so he's speaking of dying to himself and
[49:40] then Living the Life of Christ through
[49:43] his own flesh by knowing him
[49:48] that's that's the purpose of knowing him
[49:51] that that is our purpose as Christians
[49:53] right when Paul when Paul begins to tell
[49:57] his testimony what is he showing what is
[50:00] he valuing what is he looking at he's
[50:02] counting his past life
[50:04] his past Pursuits his past desires of
[50:07] the law and being a Pharisee and
[50:10] pursuing religious greatness I guess
[50:13] he lays that aside and says that's done
[50:17] I lay that aside thank you brother Tony
[50:20] I lay that aside so that I would know
[50:24] Christ
[50:25] and so in order for him to know Christ
[50:26] he has to lay aside everything from his
[50:30] past from his history and say that's
[50:33] done that's dead and I count it as
[50:36] refuse as dung
[50:41] he says I do that so I would win
[50:43] Christ
[50:45] and so he wants to
[50:47] let's read this verse not as though I
[50:49] had already attained either role already
[50:51] perfect but I follow after if that I may
[50:54] apprehend that for which also I am
[50:58] apprehended of Christ Jesus
[51:01] all right so he wants to arrive at a
[51:04] particular state
[51:06] he wants to because he wants to
[51:09] arrive at perfection
[51:12] spiritual maturity in Christ
[51:16] and he connects that to knowing him
[51:20] knowing him in the power
[51:24] of his resurrection
[51:26] and remember we preached this before it
[51:27] doesn't stop there we'd like it to stop
[51:29] there but it says and the fellowship of
[51:32] his sufferings
[51:34] so many times we'll actually really the
[51:37] reality is we will not truly know the
[51:41] power of his resurrection unless we
[51:43] experience The Fellowship of his
[51:44] sufferings because it is in the midst of
[51:47] the fellowship of his sufferings that
[51:49] his power is made manifest to us to
[51:52] deliver us and heal us and to set us
[51:54] free and to take take the Captivity of
[51:57] the devil away from us
[52:00] it's in those places of suffering that
[52:03] we know him in power
[52:04] and so Paul is wanting to attain
[52:06] something he's wanting to attain we'll
[52:08] just put it exactly how we would speak
[52:11] to it today he's wanting to attain the
[52:13] rapture
[52:14] he wants to attain a new body
[52:17] and he wants to be caught up to meet the
[52:19] Lord in the air that's what Paul that's
[52:21] what his aim that's what his goal is
[52:23] that's what he's moving towards and he
[52:25] connects that to being perfect
[52:28] so he connects that Rapture to being
[52:32] fully mature in Christ
[52:34] but he then he connects that full
[52:36] maturity in Christ
[52:38] not to his moral perfection
[52:41] he never relates it to moral perfection
[52:44] sinlessness no what is he connected to
[52:47] knowing him
[52:49] and this is key and this is critical to
[52:52] understand we want to go in a Rapture
[52:54] don't ever disconnect that from knowing
[52:58] him if you disconnect that from knowing
[53:00] him you're doing something Paul never
[53:02] did
[53:04] this is what this is what the Christian
[53:06] life is about it's not achieving moral
[53:08] perfection it's knowing him and out of
[53:11] knowing him what happens you die to
[53:14] yourself
[53:15] and the life of Christ is manifested
[53:17] through your life
[53:24] so that's that's Paul's desire
[53:26] not as though I had already attained so
[53:31] there in his humility saying I know I
[53:33] know I'm not where I ultimately have to
[53:36] be
[53:37] and again this isn't just Paul talking
[53:39] about himself this is applying to the
[53:41] whole body of Christ
[53:43] not are we still here
[53:46] have we been raptured yet well I know
[53:47] some people have that
[53:49] idea but we haven't been literally
[53:52] physically changed and literally
[53:55] physically caught up to meet the Lord in
[53:57] the air
[53:58] we haven't been yet so we can say with
[54:01] Paul not as though I'd already attained
[54:05] either we're already fully mature or
[54:08] completed but what am I doing I'm
[54:11] following after
[54:16] on pursuing a goal
[54:19] what is my what am I pursuing I want to
[54:21] know him
[54:23] I want to know him
[54:25] in a very specific way that leads to my
[54:29] attainment of perfection you're trying
[54:31] to attain
[54:33] Paul is trying to attain perfection
[54:35] that's what he's that's what he's moving
[54:38] forward towards
[54:39] and he that's directly connected he's
[54:41] also trying to attain the Rapture so his
[54:44] pursuit of perfection and his Pursuit Of
[54:46] The Rapture is actually one in the same
[54:49] all right
[54:50] and that word there
[54:54] um that I may apprehend
[54:57] speaks of
[54:58] laying hold of
[55:01] to take possession of we have the word
[55:03] comprehend means to take hold of an
[55:06] understanding that's not this word this
[55:09] is apprehend so I want to I'm going to
[55:11] take a hold
[55:12] of a prize right there's a prize for
[55:16] winning the race I'm going to take a
[55:18] hold of it
[55:19] which is interesting because as you look
[55:21] at this verse
[55:22] it says I'm also apprehended of Christ
[55:26] Jesus so think about it that way as
[55:29] Christ has taken laid hold of you
[55:32] what does that mean it's a parallel
[55:34] you're his prize the bride is his prize
[55:38] the bride is his reward right
[55:44] let's
[55:48] I was studying last night and I I didn't
[55:50] even make it out of three verses in two
[55:53] and a half hours of studying so and I
[55:55] just kept kept going and I probably have
[55:58] six sermons here but we'll try to
[56:01] try to get through at least three verses
[56:04] but within the three verses there are
[56:05] about 25 verses so
[56:08] so this is from the whis translation
[56:09] Philippians 3 10 and 11. in order that I
[56:12] might come to know him in an
[56:14] experiential way
[56:16] and to come to know him experientially
[56:19] the power of his resurrection and a
[56:23] joint participation in his sufferings
[56:25] being brought to the place where my life
[56:29] will radiate a likeness to his death oh
[56:32] my
[56:33] if by any means I might arrive at the
[56:36] goal namely the out Resurrection from
[56:40] among those who are dead everyone is
[56:43] going to be in the resurrection every
[56:44] single person that's ever lived will be
[56:46] raised from the dead Paul is giving us a
[56:49] separate thing here by saying this word
[56:51] out Resurrection
[56:53] from among those who are dead
[56:57] that's the rapture
[57:02] so Paul is connecting this in his
[57:04] thought
[57:05] his knowing Christ in power and
[57:08] suffering Perfection completion maturity
[57:11] and attaining the Rapture Rapture those
[57:14] things are connected if if this is the
[57:16] only thing you get out of this sermon I
[57:18] want you to understand that you're
[57:20] attaining to the Rapture you're growing
[57:22] into Perfection is directly connected to
[57:25] knowing Christ in power and suffering
[57:29] if that's all you get today I've been
[57:32] successful
[57:34] that's what I that's one of the main
[57:35] things that I want you to see
[57:38] so here we are given a picture of a race
[57:42] being run that's the picture that Paul
[57:45] is bringing
[57:46] if I can go back
[57:48] so he's talking about following after
[57:51] he's reaching forward for something he's
[57:54] trying to win something we'll look at
[57:56] look at it more detailed in the next
[57:58] couple verses but we're going to go to
[58:01] First Corinthians
[58:04] chapter 9.
[58:06] speaking of running a race know ye not
[58:08] that they which run in a race run all
[58:11] but one receives the prize so run that
[58:14] you may
[58:15] obtain
[58:17] that's that word to lay hold of to
[58:19] obtain it's the same exact word in
[58:23] Philippians chapter 3 to to apprehend
[58:26] so run that you apprehend that you lay
[58:29] hold of the prize
[58:31] in other words run in a way that you're
[58:33] going to achieve Victory live your
[58:36] Christian Life in a way that you're
[58:38] going to overcome don't live it in a way
[58:40] that you're you're weak you can't
[58:42] overcome you can't achieve Victory you
[58:44] know if the holy spirit is in you you
[58:47] will achieve Victory but you have to run
[58:50] in a way that you will achieve Victory
[58:52] and you have to confess and speak in a
[58:55] way that you will achieve Victory if you
[58:57] speak in a way that you're losing you
[58:59] are losing but if you speak in a way
[59:01] that I am victorious I am more than a
[59:04] conqueror
[59:05] well I'm beat down I'm laying on the
[59:07] ground I can't even move shut up devil
[59:10] what does that have to do with anything
[59:12] God's word is more true than your
[59:13] circumstances Hallelujah
[59:16] and every man that strives for the
[59:18] Mastery is temperate
[59:20] in all things
[59:22] so again here here's he's speaking of
[59:25] wrestling
[59:27] now he's using wrestling as an analogy
[59:29] he's temperate in all things in other
[59:32] words he lives in such a way so that
[59:35] he's not a big old
[59:37] flabby guy that can't move people he
[59:40] might be a massive dude but he's living
[59:43] in a way to keep that that way so that
[59:46] he can be strong when he's in the middle
[59:48] of wrestling so he can do what he needs
[59:50] to do
[59:51] now they do it to obtain a corruptable
[59:54] crown
[59:55] think about it Saints think about
[59:59] um
[1:00:00] think about LeBron James
[1:00:02] he's an old guy now
[1:00:05] and he's been he's been playing he's
[1:00:07] been playing professional basketball for
[1:00:09] I don't even know 15 16 18 years
[1:00:13] um
[1:00:14] well he spends millions of dollars on
[1:00:16] his body
[1:00:18] immediately after a game he doesn't just
[1:00:20] go and eat a bunch of tacos
[1:00:24] immediately after the game he does core
[1:00:26] work he gets in in an ice bath he makes
[1:00:30] sure that there's recovery taking place
[1:00:32] immediately in other words his whole
[1:00:34] life is dedicated from A to Z to being
[1:00:37] on a basketball court and earning 50
[1:00:40] million dollars a year that's his whole
[1:00:42] life is dedicated and he takes money and
[1:00:44] he dedicates it to that and he takes all
[1:00:47] of his time and dedicates it to that
[1:00:49] that is what I'm talking about this is
[1:00:52] how he's doing it to obtain a
[1:00:55] corruptable
[1:00:57] ring
[1:00:59] right
[1:01:00] yeah it's corruptable
[1:01:03] you might remember these guys in history
[1:01:05] basketball players in history just
[1:01:07] imagine if if this was thousands of
[1:01:11] years ago do you remember who won the
[1:01:13] Olympics in the year
[1:01:16] 2 BC
[1:01:20] do you remember who was born in zero BC
[1:01:25] well we we do know one person but he
[1:01:28] lived differently
[1:01:30] do you know who was born a little bit
[1:01:32] after that
[1:01:33] well we're still reading his these men's
[1:01:35] books
[1:01:37] why why what's happening here they're
[1:01:39] obtaining a corruptable crown that Fades
[1:01:42] away their memory will eventually be
[1:01:45] wiped off the Earth and it's meaningless
[1:01:47] ultimately meaningless but we're we're
[1:01:51] seeking to gain an Incorruptible ring
[1:01:55] one that will not pass away will not
[1:01:57] fade away and will be there for all
[1:02:00] eternity while though while LeBron James
[1:02:02] and Michael Jordan are completely
[1:02:04] forgotten you'll be standing on this
[1:02:07] Earth living and walking and breathing
[1:02:10] and rejoicing and having the time of
[1:02:13] your your life continuously
[1:02:16] that's an Incorruptible crown that we
[1:02:19] are seeking after
[1:02:24] therefore I therefore so run
[1:02:27] not as uncertainly not beating the air
[1:02:30] so fight-eyed not as one that beats the
[1:02:32] air so he's training
[1:02:35] he's running he's doing it very very
[1:02:38] purposefully
[1:02:39] specifically there's a there's a pro we
[1:02:42] go brother Travis and I are going to a
[1:02:44] trainer I don't know if he has a
[1:02:45] specific program but he sure is uh
[1:02:48] tearing us up
[1:02:50] but it's building strength
[1:02:52] and so there's there's a purpose there's
[1:02:54] a goal there's a plan and there is an
[1:02:57] execution of that plan what how about
[1:02:59] your Christian Life how about your walk
[1:03:01] with the Lord do you have a program do
[1:03:04] you have a plan do you have a trainer
[1:03:08] are are you dedicated to it are you
[1:03:10] waking up early are you spending your
[1:03:13] money on it your your efforts are you
[1:03:15] exerting yourself towards the towards an
[1:03:18] Incorruptible Crown wow how much more
[1:03:20] valuable than a body that's going to
[1:03:22] fade anyways
[1:03:28] but I keep under that literally means to
[1:03:31] beat until black and blue
[1:03:33] like a boxer
[1:03:35] a boxer trains to take hard punches
[1:03:38] right when you're a boxer you don't just
[1:03:41] say I'm a really good boxer and get in
[1:03:43] and somebody touches your jaw and you
[1:03:44] fall to the ground
[1:03:46] because you've never been hitting the
[1:03:47] job before you get hit all the time
[1:03:49] that's your training is to be beaten up
[1:03:53] and you train and you train and you
[1:03:55] train so that when someone punches you
[1:03:57] in the head you just go
[1:04:00] okay that happened let's let's keep
[1:04:01] going you've got to be able to take a
[1:04:03] punch that's this is a spiritual
[1:04:07] likeness we beat we have to beat
[1:04:10] our body now this is not speaking of
[1:04:13] Catholic monks
[1:04:15] flogging themselves fasting for a
[1:04:17] certain amount of days doing these
[1:04:19] things this is talking about this the
[1:04:22] the the the the the the the life of sin
[1:04:25] that wants to have dominion over us
[1:04:28] this is saying I beat that a sinful
[1:04:32] flesh I beat it into submission I bring
[1:04:36] it under into subjection it literally
[1:04:38] means I enslave my body is enslave the
[1:04:43] body and the desires of sin
[1:04:48] are you enslaving the bot are you making
[1:04:51] those sinful desires to become slaves to
[1:04:54] what you're trying to achieve in Christ
[1:04:56] to the goal that you're going after
[1:04:58] that's what we're supposed to be doing
[1:05:00] that's what Paul did that he didn't
[1:05:02] write this so he could just say man Paul
[1:05:04] was a great guy
[1:05:06] he was really cool
[1:05:10] he wrote this so that you would take
[1:05:12] this and say okay I need I need to apply
[1:05:14] this to my life I do need to enslave the
[1:05:18] body of this death this flesh
[1:05:21] to what
[1:05:22] to what
[1:05:24] to to Christ
[1:05:26] to the to the goal to the purpose of the
[1:05:29] race that I'm running
[1:05:31] at least that by any means when I should
[1:05:34] have preached to others I should be a
[1:05:38] Castaway
[1:05:40] in other words that I should be become
[1:05:42] disqualified
[1:05:45] I'm training so that I can finish the
[1:05:47] race as a winner I'm not training so
[1:05:50] that I'm all I'm disqualified from the
[1:05:52] race I'm training so I win
[1:05:56] I'm going to read it from I think I put
[1:05:58] it up here the weast also just to give
[1:06:00] some some
[1:06:04] a little bit different different layer
[1:06:06] of meaning do you not know that those
[1:06:08] who are running in a race are indeed all
[1:06:09] running but one receives the Victor's
[1:06:11] award
[1:06:12] be running in such a manner as the one
[1:06:15] who won the won the race in order that
[1:06:17] you may obtain the Victor's award
[1:06:19] everyone who participates in the
[1:06:21] athletic games exercises constant
[1:06:23] self-control in all things those to be
[1:06:27] sure in order that they may receive a
[1:06:28] perishable Victor's Garden Garland of
[1:06:31] wild olives leaves to be worn as a crown
[1:06:33] of victory
[1:06:35] but as for us a Victor's Garland which
[1:06:38] is imperishable as for myself therefore
[1:06:40] I so run in no uncertain manner I so
[1:06:43] swing my fists not as one who when
[1:06:45] fighting misses his opponent merely
[1:06:47] beating the air and not striking a
[1:06:49] straight blow which Finds Its Target
[1:06:51] Target but I beat my body black and blue
[1:06:54] and make it my abject slave lest somehow
[1:06:58] when I have preached to others I myself
[1:07:01] should be disqualified I find it
[1:07:03] fascinating there that he's he he is the
[1:07:07] eye that's speaking and he's talking
[1:07:09] about his body as the enemy as his flesh
[1:07:12] as the enemy and so his soul I think
[1:07:15] that's what he's saying his soul is in a
[1:07:18] war with his flesh and his soul is
[1:07:21] saying I'm I'm not just throwing wild
[1:07:23] punches I'm throwing them with Precision
[1:07:25] to beat against that area in my life
[1:07:29] that is weak be precise
[1:07:33] be precise with yourself if you have if
[1:07:35] you know you have an area of weakness
[1:07:37] start beating on it
[1:07:40] turn beat on it and beat on it until
[1:07:42] it's black and blue in other words be
[1:07:45] very specific with steps you take for
[1:07:48] yourself
[1:07:50] yeah yes yes we come and we come to the
[1:07:53] Altar and we pray and we ask for
[1:07:54] deliverance but this to me looks like a
[1:07:57] battle that we have to enter in on a
[1:08:00] daily basis we can get strength at the
[1:08:02] altar but we're probably going to have
[1:08:04] to learn to fight
[1:08:06] this this isn't just a spectator sport
[1:08:09] well
[1:08:10] I have a problem I'll go up to the
[1:08:12] Healer and he'll pray for me and I'll
[1:08:15] have no problems anymore in my life ever
[1:08:17] again
[1:08:18] is that how it works is that how the
[1:08:20] Christian Life Works that might that'll
[1:08:22] give us strength to the battle but it's
[1:08:24] a battle whether you want it or not you
[1:08:27] can come to the Altar and pray for no
[1:08:28] battle
[1:08:29] but it's the answer is no right
[1:08:32] right the answer is no I'm telling you
[1:08:34] right now
[1:08:35] if you you say I don't want to fight I'm
[1:08:37] tired I'm done
[1:08:38] the answer is no you're not you're not
[1:08:42] done
[1:08:43] you might be tired but just just you
[1:08:46] wait you haven't even learned about what
[1:08:48] tired is yet
[1:08:50] you're going to have to keep fighting
[1:08:51] and keep battling and you don't give up
[1:08:54] no matter what you see no matter what
[1:08:57] you feel you keep giving up Travis how
[1:08:59] many times uh when we're doing those
[1:09:01] workout routes you're like I'm doing it
[1:09:03] man
[1:09:04] the morning comes around I'm sleeping
[1:09:06] I'm sleeping in
[1:09:08] my my this hurts my that hurts and it
[1:09:11] does and I'm in so much pain how is it
[1:09:14] possible and a few minutes later we're
[1:09:16] going and we're pressing forward and you
[1:09:18] think how did I how am I even doing this
[1:09:20] and then you're more sore than you were
[1:09:22] before
[1:09:24] but what are we supposed to do we keep
[1:09:26] going
[1:09:29] every fiber in your muscles is burning
[1:09:34] and it hurts and you're sweating and
[1:09:36] you're you're you're drooping and and
[1:09:39] you feel like I can't go on what is what
[1:09:41] is it what are you supposed to do quit
[1:09:43] give up fall down
[1:09:45] keep one step in front of the other keep
[1:09:47] going keep fighting keep battling don't
[1:09:50] let the devil beat you are you kidding
[1:09:52] me
[1:09:54] he wants all he wants you to do is stop
[1:09:57] all he wants you to do is quit
[1:09:59] that's what he wants you to do
[1:10:07] the the word there
[1:10:10] in let me go back see if I go back there
[1:10:25] foreign
[1:10:30] myself to have apprehended
[1:10:33] but this one thing I do this one thing I
[1:10:37] do
[1:10:38] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:10:45] have you made mistakes
[1:10:49] yeah
[1:10:50] if you if you have if you say you
[1:10:51] haven't you're a liar that's a mistake
[1:10:54] in itself
[1:10:56] so I caught you
[1:11:01] we've all sinned
[1:11:03] and fallen short of the glory of God
[1:11:06] we've all we've all lived a life at some
[1:11:10] point in time that we're not very proud
[1:11:11] of at this moment
[1:11:14] and we can we can be limited by those
[1:11:17] things we could say I'm a horrible
[1:11:18] person I did this horrible thing yeah
[1:11:22] you did yep I did
[1:11:25] okay that's what the blood of Jesus
[1:11:27] Christ is for we forget those things
[1:11:30] that are behind but let's bring it even
[1:11:32] further because the devil wants us to
[1:11:34] focus on you made this mistake you made
[1:11:36] this mistake you're not even worthy yeah
[1:11:39] that's
[1:11:40] I've been saying that all along
[1:11:42] you're not worthy
[1:11:44] devil you you take the very thing that's
[1:11:47] true and try to make us feel bad about
[1:11:49] it
[1:11:51] when we should be rejoicing say yes I'm
[1:11:54] not worthy but the blood of Christ
[1:11:56] cleanses me from all sins that those
[1:11:59] things are thrown in the sea of God
[1:12:00] spots forgetfulness
[1:12:02] but I think even more let's think about
[1:12:04] the the other side is the Lord has done
[1:12:08] things in my life in the past
[1:12:11] that's good those are testimonies we
[1:12:13] thank the Lord for that but don't stop
[1:12:15] there
[1:12:16] don't say I had a testimony five years
[1:12:18] ago I don't need to walk with God
[1:12:20] anymore I don't need more testimonies I
[1:12:23] don't need more things to happen I had I
[1:12:25] had it from the past no forget that
[1:12:28] keep going forward there's there's more
[1:12:31] there's more to enter into there's more
[1:12:34] to press into
[1:12:40] in reaching forth unto those things
[1:12:44] which are before again what is what is
[1:12:48] before us
[1:12:49] what is Paul saying in the context
[1:12:52] the rapture
[1:12:53] and Perfection those two things so I'm
[1:12:56] reaching forth that's great the Lord did
[1:12:58] those things in my life thank you Jesus
[1:13:01] there's more for me to reach forward to
[1:13:03] there's more for me to go forward to how
[1:13:05] can we sit and say well it's enough to
[1:13:09] just have faith and be born again that's
[1:13:11] all I need I just believe in Calvary
[1:13:15] I don't need anything else
[1:13:18] that's not the attitude of a Christian
[1:13:21] the attitude of a Christian is thank you
[1:13:23] Lord for the new birth thank you for
[1:13:25] filling me with your Holy Spirit
[1:13:27] I know there's more for me I know
[1:13:29] there's more for me to reach unto that's
[1:13:32] Paul's purpose of heart
[1:13:38] let's look at
[1:13:40] pursuing looking backwards looking
[1:13:43] forwards and Luke 9 62 and Jesus said
[1:13:46] unto him no man having put his hand in
[1:13:48] the plow and looking back is fit for the
[1:13:52] kingdom of God
[1:13:56] we're not to look backwards we're to
[1:13:58] move forwards with God
[1:14:00] this is the response to someone who says
[1:14:02] let me go home and say bye to my family
[1:14:05] and
[1:14:06] take care of things at home before I
[1:14:07] serve you Lord
[1:14:10] no we drop everything and we serve him
[1:14:13] now
[1:14:17] we don't make excuses
[1:14:18] we don't say I don't have my life
[1:14:20] figured out I don't have this
[1:14:22] no that's not how salvation works I
[1:14:24] remember when I
[1:14:26] was was bad what the Lord was dealing
[1:14:28] with me
[1:14:29] trying to save me and
[1:14:32] I said to my friends well I'll get
[1:14:34] things I'll get my life straightened out
[1:14:35] and then I'll serve the Lord and they
[1:14:37] said what what's the purpose of the
[1:14:39] Gospel then
[1:14:41] we're not saved by getting our life
[1:14:43] figured out we give our life to Christ
[1:14:47] amen we put our faith in him and he
[1:14:49] figures our life out
[1:14:56] all right remember Lot's wife
[1:14:59] what good was it for her to look
[1:15:01] backwards
[1:15:02] she looked backwards and turned to a
[1:15:04] pillar of salt and her story was over
[1:15:06] and it's ended there and it's still
[1:15:08] being told of her story looking back at
[1:15:10] Sodom oh
[1:15:12] oh I'm longing for this thing or for
[1:15:15] that thing don't look back move forward
[1:15:18] with Christ
[1:15:24] Exodus 14. we're going to read 10
[1:15:27] through 16.
[1:15:28] and when Pharaoh junai the children of
[1:15:30] Israel lifted up their eyes and behold
[1:15:32] the Egyptians marched after them and
[1:15:35] they were sore afraid and the children
[1:15:37] of Israel Cried Out unto the Lord
[1:15:40] all right they have left Egypt they're
[1:15:43] marching forward God leads him as
[1:15:45] brother Branham said look to be like God
[1:15:47] was a poor General
[1:15:49] leads them directly to a sea
[1:15:54] and what's the response
[1:15:56] they've totally forgot everything that
[1:15:58] God had done
[1:16:00] and totally forgot everything that God
[1:16:03] had promised them
[1:16:04] and we're right there in the moment
[1:16:06] looking at their circumstances and
[1:16:07] saying we're afraid Lord what do we do
[1:16:12] and they said unto Moses oh
[1:16:15] it's the prophet's fault
[1:16:19] he looked at the prophet and say our
[1:16:21] circumstances are bad we can't
[1:16:23] understand what's going on around us
[1:16:25] you must be a false prophet
[1:16:28] said unto Moses because there are no
[1:16:30] graves in Egypt has thou taken us away
[1:16:31] to die in the wilderness wherefore hast
[1:16:34] thou dealt thus with us to carry us
[1:16:36] forth out of Egypt is this not the word
[1:16:39] that we told you in Egypt saying let us
[1:16:41] alone that we may serve the Egyptians
[1:16:43] for it been better for us to serve the
[1:16:45] Egyptians than that we should die in
[1:16:47] this Wilderness my goodness
[1:16:52] and Moses said unto the people fear ye
[1:16:54] not stand still and see the salvation of
[1:16:57] the Lord which he will show to to you
[1:16:59] today for the Egyptians whom you have
[1:17:01] seen today you shall see them again no
[1:17:04] more forever
[1:17:06] so the Lord brought this as a setup
[1:17:10] he tested them
[1:17:12] right
[1:17:13] he brought them as a test will you walk
[1:17:15] by what your eyes see
[1:17:18] or will you walk by The Promise
[1:17:20] and every one of you is going to face
[1:17:22] the same thing in your life and is
[1:17:24] facing it has faced it and will continue
[1:17:26] to face it as long as you're here
[1:17:29] will you walk according to what your
[1:17:31] eyes see
[1:17:33] or will you walk according to your faith
[1:17:36] in God's word
[1:17:37] in his promises and what he's spoken to
[1:17:39] you by the scriptures and by this
[1:17:41] message
[1:17:45] the Lord
[1:17:46] shall fight for you and you shall hold
[1:17:49] your peace the Lord will fight for you
[1:17:51] and you're going to shut up
[1:17:53] that's what he just said
[1:17:58] and the Lord said unto Moses that's
[1:17:59] Faith Moses was speaking Faith that's
[1:18:02] good
[1:18:04] and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore
[1:18:06] Christ thou unto me
[1:18:08] speak unto the children of Israel that
[1:18:10] they go forward God's saying I told you
[1:18:12] to walk forward
[1:18:14] but but but there's circumstances
[1:18:17] preventing me from walking forward yeah
[1:18:21] and
[1:18:23] was it was was there some problem we had
[1:18:26] in in Egypt that got solved that I God
[1:18:29] solved the problem did he do it yeah
[1:18:33] is he leading us here
[1:18:34] well the people got mad at Moses and
[1:18:37] said God must not have appeared to you
[1:18:40] God must have not spoken to you well
[1:18:42] didn't you forget how God Vindicated his
[1:18:44] ministry
[1:18:46] God have proven his ministry time and
[1:18:48] time again and now you're faced with
[1:18:50] circumstances that are rising against
[1:18:52] you and you think must be a false
[1:18:54] prophet
[1:18:57] it's fascinating isn't it yeah
[1:19:00] it's parallels to our day today
[1:19:05] and God says to Moses why are you crying
[1:19:07] unto me speak why cry speak tell them to
[1:19:12] go forward
[1:19:13] but but but but
[1:19:14] we don't have boats we can't swim we
[1:19:18] don't have a barge go forward go forward
[1:19:21] Saints
[1:19:22] you might be blocked if if you're in the
[1:19:24] path of Duty and God has called you to
[1:19:26] do something walk forward I've seen it
[1:19:28] time and time again on the missions
[1:19:31] field if God has told you to do
[1:19:32] something though all circumstances look
[1:19:34] horrible do what God has said to do
[1:19:38] God will open the way it's up to him
[1:19:40] it's up to us to follow clear
[1:19:42] instruction
[1:19:43] it's up to God to take care of
[1:19:46] everything else
[1:19:47] though the circumstance just be be sure
[1:19:50] of this thing God will such ordain your
[1:19:53] walk that he will make the circumstances
[1:19:55] impossible
[1:19:56] well gee and you'll say Lord I thought
[1:19:59] you spoke to me
[1:20:01] and I thought you told me to do this
[1:20:04] thing but surely I must have
[1:20:07] misunderstood because all these things
[1:20:10] are against me
[1:20:11] we do that have you done it some of you
[1:20:13] are smiling because you're doing it
[1:20:16] and I'm smiling because I've done it too
[1:20:20] sure but then something Rises up and
[1:20:21] says I God has told me to do this and
[1:20:25] I'm going to do it even if I'm all alone
[1:20:27] and even if I look crazy
[1:20:32] lift up thy rod
[1:20:34] and stretch out thy hand over the sea
[1:20:36] and divide it and the children of Israel
[1:20:38] shall go on dry ground through the midst
[1:20:42] of the sea God will open the door it's
[1:20:44] up to him to open the door
[1:20:46] sometimes you might have to speak to the
[1:20:48] door
[1:20:50] you might have to speak the promise of
[1:20:52] God
[1:20:53] speak what he told you
[1:20:55] speak it to the circumstance and keep
[1:20:57] walking
[1:21:01] and Moses said unto the people uh uh
[1:21:03] what did I do here
[1:21:13] I'm all out of order no I'm not over and
[1:21:16] Moses said other people fear you not
[1:21:17] stand still and see the salvation of the
[1:21:20] Lord which he will show to you this day
[1:21:21] for the Egyptians whom you have seen
[1:21:25] today you shall see them again no more
[1:21:27] forever I just read this what am I doing
[1:21:30] aha
[1:21:32] next one oh that's the end of it all
[1:21:35] right
[1:21:37] what just happened brother Mark help me
[1:21:43] so back to verse 13 is where I want to
[1:21:45] be brother Mark
[1:21:51] Philippians 3 13.
[1:21:59] so reaching forth
[1:22:02] speaks of straining forward extending
[1:22:05] forward with the hand and foot and the
[1:22:08] body bent forward like a runner running
[1:22:12] a race like you're straining to get
[1:22:14] through the Finish Line you're you're
[1:22:15] pushing yourself forward so that you can
[1:22:19] get put every effort into obtaining
[1:22:22] victory
[1:22:24] just think of that for a minute
[1:22:26] you're running in a race
[1:22:27] and man you're pushing forward you're so
[1:22:30] hard you keep going and you keep going
[1:22:32] and it seems like this race is going to
[1:22:34] take forever exhaustion is starting to
[1:22:36] set in weariness sets in your muscles
[1:22:39] are on fire in your mind thinking
[1:22:43] I I gotta stop I gotta stop I can't do
[1:22:45] this anymore I'm gonna get injured it's
[1:22:47] impossible but then you start to
[1:22:48] remember there's a prize
[1:22:50] that's ahead
[1:22:52] remember that there's there's something
[1:22:54] of value ahead
[1:22:57] and so you you look up and you remember
[1:22:59] you remember your your teammates are
[1:23:01] counting on you
[1:23:03] your coach has asked you to do something
[1:23:04] you've got to do it
[1:23:07] every fiber of your body wants to stop
[1:23:09] the pain it's like it's like a fire
[1:23:12] going through your muscles but you
[1:23:13] strain forward with everything that's in
[1:23:16] you and you refuse to give up
[1:23:18] that's the picture I believe that Paul
[1:23:21] is trying to paint
[1:23:22] for us here he he's saying put every
[1:23:25] effort every exertion every strength and
[1:23:28] when it feels like you're going to quit
[1:23:29] just keep Reaching Forward keep going
[1:23:44] there we go
[1:23:46] Philippians 3 14 I press toward the mark
[1:23:48] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[1:23:52] in Christ Jesus
[1:23:55] there we finally got to that press
[1:23:59] the word press there and in Greek is
[1:24:01] dyoko and it means to pursue or follow
[1:24:04] in haste to press forward to strive to
[1:24:07] to do something with an intense effort
[1:24:10] to achieve a goal to strive for a
[1:24:14] purpose
[1:24:16] that's the same word that we saw also we
[1:24:18] brought out also in verse 12. he says
[1:24:21] press forward to lay hold of that which
[1:24:24] Christ Jesus laid hold of us for
[1:24:27] and the word there where it says the
[1:24:29] Mark Press
[1:24:30] towards the mark
[1:24:33] it means a goal or a purpose
[1:24:37] all right and then where it says
[1:24:40] prize
[1:24:43] it's a gift received as a prize or a
[1:24:48] reward
[1:24:50] interesting interesting way of wording
[1:24:52] that a gift received as a prize or a
[1:24:57] reward so we're running in a race we're
[1:24:59] going towards a reward but it's actually
[1:25:02] a gift
[1:25:04] right for by grace are you saved through
[1:25:06] faith that not of yourselves it's the
[1:25:09] gift of God not of Works lest any man
[1:25:12] should boast so this is a gift
[1:25:14] but God has so ordained that to get this
[1:25:19] gift we have to run we have to fight we
[1:25:22] have to battle we have to overcome
[1:25:25] overcoming is is a gift
[1:25:28] right
[1:25:29] yes and no
[1:25:32] overcoming is a reward right overcoming
[1:25:36] means there's a battle that you faced
[1:25:38] and you achieved victory
[1:25:42] But ultimately it's a gift because
[1:25:44] you're predestined to be an overcomer
[1:25:47] it's both of those things
[1:25:49] but it isn't just a gift by itself that
[1:25:52] you sit back and just receive but it is
[1:25:55] a gift that requires struggle striving
[1:25:58] difficulty that struggling struggling in
[1:26:01] difficulty doesn't earn your salvation
[1:26:04] it proves your salvation
[1:26:07] it vindicates that you are saved
[1:26:12] were to strive or to press forward to
[1:26:15] pursue strive towards the goal for the
[1:26:20] reward
[1:26:23] wouldn't it be better if we thought of
[1:26:25] our Christian Life on a daily basis like
[1:26:27] this
[1:26:28] instead of becoming lazy Christians
[1:26:33] too many times we become lazy Christians
[1:26:35] we don't look at it as we're in a battle
[1:26:38] we're in a fight we're running a race it
[1:26:41] requires constant training when you're
[1:26:43] spending time with the Lord when you're
[1:26:44] feeding on the message when you're
[1:26:46] studying the Bible when you're reading
[1:26:48] Godly books that point you to the word
[1:26:51] what are you doing
[1:26:53] you're you're training yourself for the
[1:26:55] battle you will never have strength for
[1:26:58] the battle if you don't do that
[1:27:00] but it's when the battle comes where's
[1:27:03] my weapon I don't even my my grip is so
[1:27:06] weak I can't even hold the weapon
[1:27:09] you've got it's got to be trained
[1:27:11] constantly you're you're running a race
[1:27:14] you don't just show up to the Olympics
[1:27:16] after off the couch
[1:27:19] and this is this this Christian walk and
[1:27:22] the battle that we're facing against the
[1:27:24] enemy is the Olympics
[1:27:26] right and we have we're gonna We Are
[1:27:28] ordained to Victory
[1:27:30] but there's a process and don't lose
[1:27:32] track of what is the overarching
[1:27:36] what is the overarching way
[1:27:38] to achieve Victory and have the strength
[1:27:41] is knowing him
[1:27:43] you can't lose track of that so when
[1:27:46] you're reading you're studying you're
[1:27:48] praying you're listening to messages
[1:27:51] think of it that way it's knowing him
[1:27:54] I want to know him and then God brings
[1:27:56] these circumstances these trials these
[1:27:59] difficulties to challenge us
[1:28:01] and what is what is he trying to do he's
[1:28:03] trying he's trying to get us to know him
[1:28:06] more
[1:28:08] When
[1:28:10] God says I need it there needed to be a
[1:28:13] sinner
[1:28:15] so that I could express my attribute of
[1:28:17] Salvation well that's fantastic but you
[1:28:19] just do that in a vacuum
[1:28:21] what good is it it's not in a vacuum God
[1:28:24] is it wants to express himself to you
[1:28:27] as a savior
[1:28:29] he doesn't just want to express himself
[1:28:31] randomly out in the world as a savior he
[1:28:34] wants you as an individual to know him
[1:28:36] as a savior he wants you as an
[1:28:38] individual to know him as a Healer he
[1:28:40] wants you as an individual to know him
[1:28:44] as your strength so if you're going to
[1:28:46] know him as a strength everything is
[1:28:48] going to be easy for you right
[1:28:52] everything is going to be so simple in
[1:28:55] your life that you're going to have a
[1:28:57] silver spoon there
[1:28:58] and Everything You Touch turns to gold
[1:29:02] it's not what it is
[1:29:05] in order to know God as your strength it
[1:29:08] means that there needs to be something
[1:29:10] in your life that's producing weakness
[1:29:14] because his power is made perfect in
[1:29:16] your weakness when you when you're just
[1:29:19] strong and uh everything's fine and I'm
[1:29:21] good is God being known in in strength
[1:29:25] you are being known
[1:29:26] and strength
[1:29:28] God is known in strength when you are at
[1:29:31] the end of yours
[1:29:33] and we can go on with every attribute of
[1:29:35] God
[1:29:37] love and mercy
[1:29:39] and Justice and Holiness every one of
[1:29:43] his attributes is not to be in a vacuum
[1:29:45] it's meant to be expressed and known by
[1:29:48] you brother Steve personally
[1:29:50] individually in a way that no one else
[1:29:53] could you you could explain it to us try
[1:29:57] to explain it we say that's good
[1:29:59] Doctrine brother Steve
[1:30:01] it's not supposed to be just good
[1:30:03] Doctrine you're supposed to know that
[1:30:05] Doctrine because you've walked in it and
[1:30:08] you've experienced it and you've lived
[1:30:09] it and it's manifested through your life
[1:30:15] we should put our daily effort our
[1:30:18] strength our power our time our money
[1:30:21] the focus of our life is training
[1:30:24] yourself
[1:30:25] for this purpose the High Calling of God
[1:30:28] in Christ Jesus our lord it literally
[1:30:30] means the upward calling of God I think
[1:30:34] no I don't have it there
[1:30:37] literally the upward calling of God so
[1:30:39] it's speaking of the Rapture what is the
[1:30:41] upward calling we're to be caught up in
[1:30:43] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[1:30:45] yeah and so that is that is the prize
[1:30:48] that we're straining and striving for
[1:30:54] if you examine your life
[1:30:56] and look at your life
[1:30:58] would you say it's characterized by
[1:31:02] straining and striving and pursuing and
[1:31:06] putting all exertion and effort into
[1:31:09] obtaining this prize
[1:31:12] or do you think it's just going to be
[1:31:15] offered up to you on a silver platter
[1:31:18] without any effort
[1:31:20] or strength or anything put into it I
[1:31:23] think sometimes As Americans we think
[1:31:25] everything should be given to us
[1:31:28] without anything and certainly salvation
[1:31:31] is a gift
[1:31:33] that is without question
[1:31:35] but Salvation is manifested in a life
[1:31:38] and you don't unless there is a life
[1:31:41] manifesting salvation there is no
[1:31:43] salvation
[1:31:45] and so if you have that gift abiding in
[1:31:48] you of eternal life
[1:31:50] it's going to be expressed in this way
[1:31:52] Paul is not trying to make you know a
[1:31:55] certain level of super Christians and
[1:31:57] everybody else just does what they want
[1:31:58] to sits in the Pew and comes to church
[1:32:01] and does nothing this is for every
[1:32:03] Christian to live and to walk in is you
[1:32:06] need to exert yourself you need to put
[1:32:08] your strength into this you need to put
[1:32:11] your time into it it takes time
[1:32:13] you know you can't you're not going to
[1:32:15] get quick fixes with Dodd
[1:32:18] sometimes he'll give that to you but
[1:32:20] usually it's when you've spent a lot of
[1:32:23] time
[1:32:24] when you've given your heart and given
[1:32:26] your life to study brother Jason gives
[1:32:28] his life
[1:32:29] to study in the word of God
[1:32:31] and his life is exudes that
[1:32:35] what about you that's not just for your
[1:32:37] pastor to do
[1:32:38] right that's not just the pastor job
[1:32:39] we're not Baptists
[1:32:41] we're not Catholics we don't show up and
[1:32:44] stick our tongue out and brother Jason
[1:32:45] slaps a Eucharist on our tongue
[1:32:50] that's we don't believe in that we don't
[1:32:52] study to show thyself approved unto God
[1:32:55] isn't just for a specialized class of
[1:32:57] people every one of us should be
[1:33:00] studying should be feeding should be
[1:33:02] feasting
[1:33:03] should be praying should be dedicating
[1:33:05] our time and our efforts
[1:33:07] to God and if there's things that are
[1:33:10] preventing that throw them away
[1:33:14] re-prioritize your time you know how
[1:33:18] many of you as the New Year comes around
[1:33:20] you look at your schedule and the things
[1:33:22] you're committed to and you say I've
[1:33:24] I've got to fix this I've got to fix
[1:33:26] this so it's right prioritize do that we
[1:33:29] should be doing that every day
[1:33:33] reprioritize your time not so your
[1:33:35] business can be successful but so that
[1:33:37] the word can be successful in your life
[1:33:42] James 1 verse 12 blessed is the man that
[1:33:46] endures temptation
[1:33:48] my goodness happy literally means happy
[1:33:51] is the man the Divine favor
[1:33:55] the deity the favor of the deity rests
[1:33:59] on the man that endures temptation
[1:34:01] how many of you talk like that
[1:34:04] oh man you know you see somebody they
[1:34:06] got a lot of money and they got nice
[1:34:09] cars and they say oh they're blessed
[1:34:12] I'm going to say stop that
[1:34:16] knock it off
[1:34:18] because James says blessed is the man
[1:34:20] that endures temptation
[1:34:23] for when he has tried so it's speaking
[1:34:25] of a trial
[1:34:26] speaking of another place that call is
[1:34:28] Peter calls it a fiery trial
[1:34:32] blessed is the man that endures fiery
[1:34:35] trials
[1:34:37] can we talk like that
[1:34:39] can we make that our speech
[1:34:42] oh
[1:34:43] you guys are dumbfounded by this
[1:34:47] just I'm gonna I'm gonna break this down
[1:34:49] a little bit just think of it and put
[1:34:50] Flesh on it the person that's
[1:34:53] there and he's struggling under a heavy
[1:34:56] weight but he's striving and he's
[1:34:58] fighting to overcome the devil with all
[1:35:01] that is his being is he's got everything
[1:35:03] is set against him blessed is that man
[1:35:07] that's the person that's blessed
[1:35:09] not the guy that has everything that he
[1:35:12] wants and never needs feel sorry for him
[1:35:15] feel sorry for that guy we have so much
[1:35:18] in America even our poorest people have
[1:35:20] so much
[1:35:23] but nevertheless
[1:35:25] think differently it isn't necessarily
[1:35:28] the blessing of the Lord to have
[1:35:30] prosperity it can be
[1:35:32] it can be a curse
[1:35:34] can be a horrible thing
[1:35:36] can take you far away from God and Jesus
[1:35:39] says that's the norm is that riches take
[1:35:41] you far away from God
[1:35:44] blessed is the man that endures
[1:35:46] Temptation for when he is tried
[1:35:49] and I think it goes without saying and
[1:35:51] overcomes
[1:35:52] he shall receive the Crown of Life which
[1:35:56] is Promised the Lord has promised to
[1:35:58] those that love him
[1:36:00] can't we just receive a crown of life if
[1:36:03] the lord loves us why do we have to have
[1:36:05] the first part of the verse
[1:36:07] because the low the ones that the lord
[1:36:09] loves he tries them and chastens them
[1:36:13] and rebukes them why because we need to
[1:36:16] be more like Christ we are we're in a
[1:36:19] condition where our lives need to be
[1:36:21] conformed unto him and so we need
[1:36:23] chastening yeah
[1:36:25] yeah brother Brad you need chastening
[1:36:28] Brother JD you need chastening looking
[1:36:31] in the mirror
[1:36:32] we need chastening every one of us
[1:36:35] to be more like Christ
[1:36:37] and he does that because he loves us
[1:36:42] we have a high calling
[1:36:44] we have an upward calling
[1:36:46] that's coming we're waiting for the
[1:36:48] rapture
[1:36:51] we're going to be caught up together
[1:36:54] with the dead Saints
[1:36:56] in the clouds to meet the Lord in the
[1:36:58] air that's the Heavenly calling we have
[1:37:00] it's a glorified body
[1:37:02] and then ultimately on a fully renewed
[1:37:04] and restored Earth and Heaven
[1:37:09] every atom in this
[1:37:11] ER in this universe is going to be
[1:37:14] renewed
[1:37:15] by Christ he's going to even change
[1:37:18] change natural laws in order to bring
[1:37:21] restoration
[1:37:23] to this to this
[1:37:25] entire universe and we're a part of that
[1:37:31] but we need to run the race in a
[1:37:34] specific way
[1:37:36] to get there
[1:37:39] you can't do it the way you want to do
[1:37:42] it sorry
[1:37:43] you can't figure out figure this out
[1:37:45] with your own plan and with your own
[1:37:48] purpose you can't live your life the way
[1:37:51] you want to live
[1:37:52] you have to be a prisoner to Christ you
[1:37:56] have to live in the manner that he asks
[1:38:00] you to live
[1:38:01] not the way not not a little bit the way
[1:38:04] Jesus wants you to live and then a
[1:38:06] little bit the way
[1:38:07] I like to live no you you surrender all
[1:38:11] of it
[1:38:13] all of your pride all of the the way you
[1:38:16] want to address where you want to live
[1:38:17] what job you want to have
[1:38:19] uh what car you drive every aspect of
[1:38:23] your life must be surrendered to Christ
[1:38:25] otherwise you haven't surrendered to
[1:38:27] Christ
[1:38:31] take up your cross and follow me
[1:38:34] Jesus says that's the only option
[1:38:37] there's not another option take up your
[1:38:40] place of torture and death and follow me
[1:38:45] that's the walk that he's called us to
[1:38:47] and that's the race
[1:38:49] that we are running together we're
[1:38:52] trying to attain something and Paul uses
[1:38:55] this terminology purposefully I believe
[1:38:58] we know that going in the Rapture is not
[1:39:02] something that we achieve by our own
[1:39:04] works you understand that right you are
[1:39:07] not going to good yourself into the
[1:39:09] Rapture you never could you will never
[1:39:11] be good enough
[1:39:12] you'll never be good enough because the
[1:39:15] object is the Holiness of God and the
[1:39:17] Holiness of God is absolutely infinite
[1:39:20] yeah
[1:39:21] yeah it's so far beyond anything that
[1:39:23] you could ever achieve or or do
[1:39:26] it's unimaginable
[1:39:29] but God has so ordained that we run a
[1:39:32] race
[1:39:33] he didn't ordain that we'd be Spectators
[1:39:36] in the stands
[1:39:37] he he ordained that we be participants
[1:39:40] in the life
[1:39:42] and manifestation of Jesus Christ
[1:39:45] and if you're not get into it how do I
[1:39:48] get into it by one Spirit we're all
[1:39:50] baptized into one body
[1:39:52] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:39:55] I want to go back I think is next uh
[1:39:58] Philippians chapter 3
[1:40:03] verse 8.
[1:40:04] this is the start of Paul's testimony
[1:40:06] yea doubtless and I can't all things but
[1:40:09] lost for the Excellency of the knowledge
[1:40:12] of Christ Jesus my Lord
[1:40:14] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[1:40:17] things and do count them but done that I
[1:40:19] may win Christ
[1:40:21] and be found in him not having mine own
[1:40:23] righteousness see this is not our own
[1:40:26] achievement the achievement of our
[1:40:27] righteousness which is of the law but
[1:40:30] that which is through the Faith of
[1:40:32] Christ it doesn't even say your faith
[1:40:34] but it's the Faith of Christ the faith
[1:40:36] that belongs to Christ
[1:40:38] the righteousness of God which is by
[1:40:41] faith and we remember that righteousness
[1:40:43] is imputed to us through Christ in other
[1:40:45] words it's Christ's righteousness given
[1:40:48] to you as a gift and the means of
[1:40:50] obtaining it as faith
[1:40:52] and you can't have faith in yourself
[1:40:56] faith is a gift from God given to you no
[1:41:01] man can come to me unless my father
[1:41:02] except my father draws him first right
[1:41:04] but God has ordained that those who have
[1:41:07] faith would persevere in their walk with
[1:41:11] him that would run the race with
[1:41:13] patients that they would fight the
[1:41:15] battle they might they might lose
[1:41:17] battles but they're going to win the war
[1:41:19] as a whole
[1:41:21] sure
[1:41:22] you might you might fall
[1:41:25] over and over again but you get up and
[1:41:27] you keep fighting and you don't quit and
[1:41:29] you don't give up you keep enduring to
[1:41:32] the end
[1:41:35] and this is the purpose being found in
[1:41:37] him not having my own righteousness but
[1:41:40] then he and it goes on for what purpose
[1:41:42] Paul that I may know him so this is this
[1:41:47] is the the the the purpose that's going
[1:41:50] on this is Paul's purpose as a Christian
[1:41:54] that I may know him I didn't say it was
[1:41:56] the prize I said it was the purpose
[1:41:58] it was Paul's purpose I may know him and
[1:42:01] the power of his resurrection and the
[1:42:04] fellowship is of his suffering being
[1:42:06] made conformable unto his death
[1:42:11] so he counted all things as lost and
[1:42:14] done
[1:42:15] and he says he was found in him he
[1:42:17] received the Holy ghosts and this put
[1:42:19] him in Christ how do you get found in
[1:42:21] Christ you got to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:42:25] because of this he had the righteous he
[1:42:27] had musicians if he'd come
[1:42:30] I got I don't even 30 more pages
[1:42:33] probably of this
[1:42:37] so he counted all things as lost and is
[1:42:40] done he was found in Christ because of
[1:42:43] this he had the righteousness that was
[1:42:45] imputed to him by the Faith of Christ
[1:42:48] comes by faith
[1:42:50] the purpose of all this was knowing him
[1:42:53] and this is our race that's this is what
[1:42:56] our race this is your race knowing him
[1:42:59] fully
[1:43:00] by experiential knowledge not not merely
[1:43:03] doctrinal knowledge
[1:43:06] but experiential knowledge of the
[1:43:08] doctrine in your life
[1:43:10] laying hold completely of that
[1:43:13] revelation of Christ
[1:43:14] that he laid hold of us to receive
[1:43:18] the goal
[1:43:22] the purpose is knowing Christ
[1:43:25] the prize
[1:43:27] is the upward call
[1:43:29] the prize is the rapture the prize is a
[1:43:31] new new body on a new Earth
[1:43:36] the means of pursuing that goal I said
[1:43:38] this before on a repeated in closing the
[1:43:41] means of pursuing that goal is not
[1:43:43] achieving moral perfection through
[1:43:45] law-based righteousness the means of
[1:43:48] pursuing that goal is to know him both
[1:43:50] in the power of his resurrection and the
[1:43:53] fellowship of his sufferings
[1:43:56] being made conformable to his death or
[1:43:59] as we says that we would radiate
[1:44:03] the death
[1:44:04] of Christ think about that that our life
[1:44:06] would radiate his death his sufferings
[1:44:09] think about that we're supposed to
[1:44:11] radiate his life right but here Paul
[1:44:14] says we should radiate his death that we
[1:44:17] have died to ourselves that his life him
[1:44:20] being raised up his life would be
[1:44:22] manifested in and through us
[1:44:26] let's let's pray Heavenly Father
[1:44:29] we come before you now Lord and
[1:44:33] we ask this Lord that you would
[1:44:36] move in every heart and every every life
[1:44:39] get give each one this
[1:44:43] this Grit
[1:44:45] to run this race to press forward to
[1:44:48] press on
[1:44:50] give them that that determination
[1:44:54] in in their soul not just their spirit
[1:44:57] in their mind but Lord in their very
[1:44:59] depths of their soul they would have a
[1:45:01] determination
[1:45:02] to press on

[1:45:07] to to give all their efforts and
[1:45:09] exertions
