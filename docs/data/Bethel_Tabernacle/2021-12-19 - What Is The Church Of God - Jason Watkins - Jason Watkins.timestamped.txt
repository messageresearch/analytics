[32:05] forget that we'll be having our new
[32:06] year's eve service on december 29th
[32:10] i'm sorry
[32:11] december 31st we're moving the wednesday
[32:14] which is on the 29th to
[32:17] friday the 31st last day of the year and
[32:21] it's not a watch night service per se
[32:24] amen but i'm
[32:25] i'm watching for the coming of the lord
[32:27] every day every night all the time amen
[32:30] and and so i i live you know i look for
[32:33] him every morning
[32:34] and i live like he you know that he'll
[32:37] come as a thief the bible says when just
[32:39] at the hour that you don't expect him i
[32:41] remember years ago i think it was
[32:43] brother vale who kind of shocked an
[32:45] audience
[32:46] and i probably did it to get their
[32:48] attention he says now i know the bible
[32:50] says that that you know no man knoweth
[32:53] the day or the hour but i'm going to
[32:55] tell you that the lord did reveal to me
[32:57] the very hour he's coming and everybody
[32:59] was like what
[33:00] and he said the bible says in the hour
[33:02] you think not
[33:04] so
[33:05] we're going to be meeting
[33:07] and we'll be having the lord's supper
[33:10] communion and foot washing at last
[33:12] finally we didn't get to do that last
[33:13] time and so
[33:16] a little bit of a different way we'd
[33:18] like to have our whole entire ministry
[33:20] team give a few minutes of exhortation i
[33:23] intend to take part in that myself we're
[33:25] gonna start with uh i mentioned to you
[33:28] last time we would open with a couple
[33:30] songs and
[33:31] the uh go straight to communion i'm
[33:33] rethinking that a little bit uh feels
[33:36] like
[33:36] i got a voice inside me saying maybe i
[33:38] should preach my portion first which is
[33:41] going to be amended and brief
[33:43] but just uh you know there's as brother
[33:45] kenny was saying there's nothing more
[33:47] important than the ministry of the word
[33:49] because it's the ministry of the word
[33:51] you know that he sent his word and
[33:53] healed the people and so it's the the
[33:55] faith comes by hearing the
[33:57] amen and so so we we realize that the
[34:01] best way is
[34:03] how shall they hear except there be a
[34:04] preacher and how shall he preach unless
[34:06] he be sent
[34:07] so we want to do that and then we'll
[34:09] move into the that's the way i'm
[34:11] thinking now that's still subject to a
[34:13] final decision at the moment
[34:16] i don't always know exactly how the lord
[34:18] wants to do it sometimes till the very
[34:19] minute
[34:20] but uh that's okay and so uh but we're
[34:23] going to have that we want to have a
[34:24] little bit from all of the team and then
[34:26] we want to have the lord's supper and
[34:28] i'll still be aiming to get you out and
[34:31] get you home before
[34:32] the crazy people get on the roads and uh
[34:35] and we'll get you home at a safe decent
[34:38] hour so we're looking forward to that
[34:40] amen we're going to invite you
[34:44] excuse me to the book of first
[34:46] corinthians this morning and as we read
[34:49] our scripture and go to prayer
[34:51] we will
[34:53] take up our prayer requests
[34:56] for brother jack and sister chastity
[34:58] those were the only prayer requests that
[35:00] came in of course we had some wednesday
[35:03] and i'm sure that you are still
[35:05] continuing to pray for those
[35:07] all right
[35:09] first corinthians chapter one
[35:11] and we want to read verses one through
[35:14] nine
[35:15] and
[35:16] i i
[35:18] hope by the help of the lord
[35:20] to bring this thought it's it's a new
[35:23] thought
[35:24] that i finished up my series
[35:27] last wednesday
[35:28] [Music]
[35:30] me
[35:33] and i want to start this again today
[35:35] here a new um little thing i don't know
[35:39] it might be a two or three part i will
[35:41] see how far it goes today i think for
[35:43] sure to be two parts at least
[35:46] but i want to title it what is
[35:49] the church of god what is we say that
[35:52] that's a loose term and what is the
[35:55] church of god how many believe there is
[35:57] one
[35:59] there is now when you say there's a
[36:00] church of god then there's no way to
[36:03] attribute that to something man-made
[36:06] so right away you know that throws out
[36:08] any type of man-made organization that
[36:11] they made the church of god you don't
[36:14] have the church of god until you have
[36:16] the baptism of the holy spirit in the
[36:18] new testament and then you've got the
[36:21] church of god you you have that
[36:23] reference to israel in the wilderness
[36:24] they were called the called out church
[36:27] see in in egypt they were the people of
[36:29] god but once an exodus came then they
[36:32] were the called out church
[36:34] of the wilderness and so we're we want
[36:37] to look at at paul's meaning today what
[36:40] does it mean to be the church of god so
[36:43] what is
[36:44] the church of god verse 1 first
[36:47] corinthians chapter 1 verse 1.
[36:51] paul called to be an apostle of jesus
[36:53] christ through the will of god and so
[36:56] so so thinnest our brother
[36:59] unto the church of god there it is under
[37:02] the church of god which is at corinth to
[37:05] them that are sanctified in christ jesus
[37:07] and now there's your first marker
[37:10] that's the first id right there of what
[37:13] makes up the church of god them that are
[37:16] sanctified in christ jesus here's your
[37:17] second marker
[37:19] called to be saints
[37:21] not called to be church members
[37:23] called to be saints all right all right
[37:26] with all that in every place call upon
[37:30] the name of jesus christ our lord both
[37:32] theirs and ours so their christian life
[37:36] is a proactive
[37:38] life it's not a just a passive life it's
[37:41] not just a lip service it's a proactive
[37:45] life that seeks to extend in the world
[37:50] from god down into the church through
[37:53] and out of the church into the world you
[37:55] follow that
[37:56] all right
[37:57] i thank my god always on your behalf
[38:01] verse 4 for the grace of god which is
[38:04] given you
[38:05] by jesus christ
[38:07] here's to here's some purpose that in
[38:09] everything ye are enriched by him in all
[38:13] utterance and in all knowledge even as
[38:17] the testimony of christ was confirmed in
[38:20] you verse 7 so that ye come behind in no
[38:24] gift
[38:25] waiting for the coming of our lord jesus
[38:28] christ
[38:29] who shall also confirm you unto the end
[38:32] aren't you glad for that
[38:33] that you may be blameless in the day of
[38:37] our lord jesus christ so you know
[38:40] something friends i've said to you
[38:41] repeatedly that i know sometimes you you
[38:44] you battle your weaknesses you're
[38:46] wearied with your weaknesses and you
[38:48] have all of these weaknesses don't worry
[38:50] you won't have after a while
[38:52] i know we all have our ups and downs
[38:54] we're like elijah man of like passions
[38:57] prophet said that mean he had his ups
[38:58] and downs you know there's no none good
[39:01] no not one it's only christ
[39:04] see there's only one elected son and
[39:06] that's christ i was in him
[39:09] therefore i'm elected with him see it's
[39:12] not the man that comes predestinated
[39:14] it's the gene of god that's inside him
[39:16] all right this is all for his glory it
[39:19] says not to make us anything we're the
[39:21] servants of the lord happy
[39:24] and rejoicing that we've been called to
[39:26] this wonderful privilege
[39:28] a privilege it is indeed
[39:31] who shall also confirm you unto the end
[39:33] that you may be blameless in the day of
[39:35] our lord jesus christ god is

[41:09] they're no doubt streaming and listening
[41:12] and rejoicing with us and their hearts
[41:14] are ready our hearts are ready now lord
[41:16] all of our attention and our minds we
[41:19] dismiss all the thoughts of yesterday
[41:21] and the cares of tomorrow and we're here
[41:23] for just a little short time to focus on
[41:26] what you want to say to us i commit
[41:28] myself into your hands to that end in
[41:31] jesus christ's name amen god bless you
[41:34] friends you can be seated
[41:38] amen
[41:40] praise the lord and
[41:43] and so also another visitor here god
[41:45] bless you young man happy to have you
[41:47] here today and to different ones of you
[41:48] we've got a number of folks who are out
[41:51] of town and we want to be uh praying for
[41:54] them the lord will give them a blessed
[41:57] wonderful time guide them back home to
[41:59] us safely amen
[42:01] you know it's a wonderful thing to be
[42:04] the church of the living god it's not it
[42:06] doesn't i mean i i want you to grasp
[42:09] today
[42:10] on how rare that is and how rare you are
[42:14] to be able to believe for many have
[42:16] desired a lot of times uh people
[42:20] have have expended entire life their
[42:23] entire life i mean if you go back and
[42:25] look at the clearest example that we see
[42:28] in the days of our lord when he was here
[42:30] in his earthly pilgrimage that he
[42:32] confronted a religious society that had
[42:35] since the days those men since the days
[42:38] of their childhood had been reared and
[42:41] trained in the law of moses and the word
[42:43] of god and had dedicated their lives to
[42:46] the degree
[42:47] that you literally couldn't touch their
[42:49] life with an accusation they were men
[42:51] who had to just walk constantly
[42:53] flawlessly because the slightest little
[42:56] deviation would disqualify them from
[42:58] their service and even could even end up
[43:01] in their death thank you brother kenny
[43:03] could even end up in their death hey i
[43:05] may want you to come back at the end and
[43:06] sing that song again i loved that that
[43:10] was just boy that's that set me right i
[43:12] was telling sister debbie i had such i
[43:14] was out of sorts all morning i couldn't
[43:16] figure out why i was up early and slept
[43:18] good and and all i mean just everything
[43:21] that that should have made it a smooth
[43:24] morning was in play but i just was out
[43:27] of sorts and so uh that song just kind
[43:30] of fixed me amen i'm so thankful to the
[43:33] lord but uh we and i and i had a really
[43:35] nice time here brother matt came with me
[43:38] and we were preaching to the church
[43:39] there in new zealand we had i actually
[43:41] got to preach it here on a zoom call
[43:42] from live so i'm my voice is a little
[43:45] bit wrung out from that sermon
[43:48] and i was using some of this material
[43:51] that in this series not nothing i'm
[43:53] going to cover today but a different
[43:55] same mountain different side of it and i
[43:57] was preaching it to them and i was
[43:59] telling them now i haven't preached this
[44:00] anywhere and i'm not even preaching to
[44:02] my own church you're not going to get it
[44:03] today either but you might get it in a
[44:05] couple more
[44:06] services we'll see but this is the
[44:08] portion i didn't cover with them this is
[44:10] what the lord has led me uh today for
[44:13] bethel tabernacle so
[44:16] thinking about what it means to be
[44:19] the church of god paul
[44:22] called to be an apostle of jesus christ
[44:25] through the will of god
[44:27] unto the church of god which is at
[44:30] corinth you know this opportunity that
[44:33] we have to be children of god should not
[44:37] be a small thing in our minds it
[44:40] shouldn't be something that we just take
[44:41] for granted because you know as i was
[44:44] saying here these men in the o in in
[44:47] jesus day had dedicated their whole
[44:49] lives by the thousands of them had
[44:52] dedicated their lives and and yet jesus
[44:56] let them know that all of their life and
[44:58] all of their ministry and all of their
[45:00] faithfulness uh to that actually uh that
[45:04] that he said you're everyone dead
[45:06] you can't even hear the true word when
[45:09] it comes that i'm standing here you have
[45:12] no problem i can reach in my pocket and
[45:15] i can pull out a penny and i could hold
[45:18] it right here and ask you whose image
[45:20] and superscription is this you have no
[45:22] problem saying that's caesar you can see
[45:25] the image of caesar and here's the image
[45:27] of god and you don't recognize it
[45:30] what a contrast caesar i know god i
[45:33] don't know and and jesus was saying why
[45:36] is it that you can't understand my words
[45:39] my word has no place in you and he began
[45:42] identifying these men by the thousands
[45:44] who had dedicated their lives to a
[45:47] certain standard and it was all vanity
[45:50] because because inside down in their
[45:54] hearts they were like uh
[45:56] jesus attributed them like a graveyard
[45:59] like graves that housed dead people and
[46:02] and there was no markers to make it
[46:04] obvious that you were walking across the
[46:07] dead
[46:08] because there was no tombstones and he
[46:10] likened them to that he was saying
[46:13] people think
[46:14] that you're officers of the kingdom of
[46:17] heaven they think that you have access
[46:19] to god and they move among you hearing
[46:22] your words but you teach for doctrine
[46:25] the commandments of men and you refuse
[46:28] the living word when it comes you're
[46:30] you're like graves that men walk over
[46:33] and don't
[46:35] know that they're walking over dead
[46:37] bones
[46:38] see and then you get another group who's
[46:40] standing off and you know they're
[46:42] offended by that he's letting one group
[46:44] have it and here comes another
[46:45] denomination and they they
[46:48] they see him going after this
[46:49] denomination and they speak up for their
[46:51] denomination they said you know are are
[46:53] we are we the same also and you know and
[46:56] jesus turns to them and he's got a word
[46:58] for them too he says you know you know
[47:00] it's it's amazing that that that had you
[47:03] that if you actually were blind because
[47:06] i just said to this group you're blind
[47:08] and now you're saying to me are we blind
[47:10] too
[47:10] he says well actually if you were blind
[47:14] then you would have a little bit of an
[47:15] excuse you could actually have a leg to
[47:18] stand on at your at your trial when you
[47:20] come up before god to say well i was
[47:22] blind i didn't know he said however
[47:24] since you have so much audacity as to
[47:27] claim you see
[47:29] then god's going to hold you accountable
[47:31] and you're going to be judged as liars
[47:34] so so so this is why the bible says of
[47:37] the last day church
[47:38] whatever you do whatever you do don't be
[47:41] lukewarm
[47:43] you'd be better to just be a cold sinner
[47:46] and come to god and ask for mercy and
[47:49] say lord i'm sorry and i'm i'm no good
[47:52] and i'm i'm not worth anything but i'm
[47:54] asking for your mercy because the bible
[47:57] says god is oftentimes merciful
[47:59] and who can say david said who could say
[48:02] maybe he would have mercy even when it
[48:04] looked like he wouldn't have mercy i'm
[48:06] here to tell you there has been many
[48:07] times down through the era of mankind
[48:10] where it looked like no way is god going
[48:12] to be merciful until he was and and
[48:15] people who were so undeserving of it
[48:17] they were they were deserving only of
[48:20] slaughter and god had mercy
[48:23] but but so if you're going to come
[48:25] you're going to be a
[48:26] if you're going to be a christian be a
[48:29] real one be one on fire be one who the
[48:32] holy spirit has a direct access to so
[48:36] that you can serve your purpose of why
[48:38] he's put you here and saved you
[48:43] don't be a half-baked one
[48:47] see so
[48:48] brother branham makes a statement in the
[48:51] exposition of the seven church ages to
[48:53] the pergament age
[48:55] he has a concern
[48:58] and his concern is this that he says i
[49:00] wonder
[49:01] if we are sufficiently impressed with
[49:04] the word in our midst
[49:08] that's a sobering question it's a
[49:10] sobering statement
[49:11] i wonder he says he's asking a question
[49:14] within himself and it becomes a
[49:16] questioning statement to us as believers
[49:19] today i wonder i i would like for you as
[49:22] as you sit here today and patiently hear
[49:26] somebody preach the gospel i want you to
[49:28] go in your mind and in your heart for
[49:30] just to take a moment i don't need
[49:31] anyone to raise their hand or stand up
[49:33] and make a declaration but i maybe it
[49:36] would be good if when we're trying to
[49:38] consider what is the true church then
[49:40] that begs the question am i a member of
[49:42] it
[49:43] because i'm not just here to try to give
[49:46] you a definition of the church what i'm
[49:48] trying to get you to go to to i want you
[49:50] to go to this place in your mind and in
[49:52] your heart am i that church and am i in
[49:55] position that
[49:57] and am i serving the reason that i'm
[50:00] part of the church
[50:03] see
[50:04] as we were showing last time how that
[50:08] you you've been called to the priesthood
[50:10] remember you're a royal priesthood
[50:13] chosen called to that see so we've been
[50:16] called now not just under a partial
[50:19] service there were some priests that
[50:21] only had a partial ministry but the high
[50:23] priest
[50:24] he was fully qualified
[50:26] for the entire temple service and so in
[50:29] fact as he went further than anybody he
[50:32] went all the way into the shekinah into
[50:34] the presence and we're called under the
[50:36] order of melchizedek which means you're
[50:39] called under the royal order of a high
[50:41] priest which means you're supposed to
[50:43] have full access and your whole life
[50:46] should be a constant uh a constant tool
[50:50] in the hands of god to bring worship to
[50:53] bring atonement to bring satisfaction to
[50:56] make god pleased
[50:59] see
[51:00] and so we were saying to you
[51:03] we're invited
[51:05] to
[51:05] be a partaker in the entire
[51:09] worship service
[51:11] in the old testament the entire the
[51:14] entire temple service
[51:16] you're a temple
[51:18] now you're the temple
[51:20] and you're you're called by the holy
[51:22] spirit to you're not you're not called
[51:24] by the holy spirit to just be in the
[51:26] church queue
[51:28] to just be a name on a book
[51:30] to just be have a uh
[51:32] uh you know a a lip service i'm a
[51:35] christian
[51:36] you'd be surprised how many million say
[51:38] that you know you look in jesus day how
[51:40] many said we have moses and we believe
[51:42] jehovah and jesus said then why are you
[51:44] dead
[51:47] if that's true why don't you receive me
[51:49] moses wrote of me
[51:51] abraham saw me
[51:54] here i am
[51:55] moses told you a prophet would come like
[51:57] him a man full of the spirit of god
[52:00] haven't i proved it if you don't believe
[52:01] my words believe the works they testify
[52:04] to you
[52:05] but you can't believe it because the
[52:07] bible has said that that that their eyes
[52:10] they have closed
[52:12] their eyes it wasn't that god closed
[52:14] them mankind who didn't want to be
[52:17] responsible to god closed their eyes and
[52:20] therefore god gave them over to their
[52:22] blind to their own blindness when you do
[52:24] that that's what he'll do he offers
[52:26] every man a legitimate chance brother jd
[52:29] was covering that in our saturday men's
[52:31] bible study breakfast that that every
[52:33] man gets a legitimate chance it's it's
[52:36] not a facetious thing it's a completely
[52:39] legit chance
[52:40] but but you know uh it's what he does
[52:43] with that choice now that's different
[52:45] from his elected family who didn't
[52:46] choose him at all he chose them they
[52:48] were elected before the foundation of
[52:49] the world but i'm just the point is that
[52:51] god gives everybody a chance save
[52:54] yourself from this untoward generation
[52:58] and their eyes they have closed he said
[53:00] lest at any time seeing with their eyes
[53:02] and hearing with their ears they believe
[53:04] and then be healed be converted and i
[53:06] have to heal them
[53:08] see
[53:09] and so so we realize that
[53:11] god set the pattern
[53:14] in genesis
[53:17] that he had one
[53:18] provided
[53:20] way
[53:21] abel found it
[53:22] cain refused it
[53:25] abel discovered it
[53:27] and he lined his sacrifice up with that
[53:30] revelation
[53:31] he followed god's way of redemption cain
[53:34] saw it just as clear but but to cain it
[53:37] never became a living reality and even
[53:40] god in his mercy
[53:43] to to a seed of the serpent
[53:47] literally says listen you know he's
[53:49] basically saying you're never going to
[53:51] get the revelation your brother has but
[53:54] but nonetheless if you'll just honor him
[53:58] and honor his lifestyle and try to
[54:00] emulate the way he does it and bring me
[54:04] a sacrifice like he did then i'll find a
[54:06] place for you cain i'll i'll save you
[54:08] and i'll help you i don't want anybody i
[54:11] take no pleasure in the death of even
[54:13] sinners
[54:15] but you must conquer him cain
[54:18] send lieth at the door
[54:20] sin is crouching he's waiting to spring
[54:23] he's you know we're waiting your
[54:24] decision cain
[54:26] see the only listen cain the only
[54:29] decision to be made god is saying to him
[54:32] the only decision to be made here is
[54:33] yours because you already know mine
[54:38] but be careful because sin is crouching
[54:40] sin is waiting to spring and if you if
[54:43] you refuse see that you refuse not him
[54:46] that speaketh but if you do refuse sin
[54:48] will take a leap and he'll have you and
[54:50] you'll never get free
[54:53] so
[54:54] so so see that you refuse not him
[54:57] when he speaks amen don't provoke him
[55:00] that way as as as the old testament
[55:02] saints warned and paul picks up that
[55:04] same warning when the gospel comes to
[55:06] you realize how how blessed how blessed
[55:10] it is that god would call you from a
[55:12] life of sin because you couldn't save
[55:15] yourself you were born dying there was
[55:17] no way you could save yourself and if he
[55:19] didn't have mercy on you there's nothing
[55:21] you could do no amount of righteousness
[55:23] would ever earn you that you've got to
[55:25] come god's provided way
[55:28] and so today don't sit here and and be
[55:31] insufficiently impressed with what god
[55:34] has done to you and for you and is
[55:37] trying to do through you and he sent a
[55:39] message to us
[55:42] and he's demonstrated it with power and
[55:44] demonstration of the holy spirit there
[55:46] should be no doubt in your mind
[55:50] what the message can do
[55:52] in a fallen human
[55:54] if given the chance
[55:56] there's enough
[55:58] godly saints just in this little church
[56:00] alone to say nothing of them of the tens
[56:03] of thousands and millions around the
[56:05] world
[56:06] there's enough evidence to that you
[56:08] should be able to know today
[56:10] say what they want but there's no way to
[56:13] to doubt the vindication of this message
[56:15] it's too supernatural it's been proven
[56:17] too many times and and and and at least
[56:21] the last but not least is what it does
[56:24] to the lives of men and women and how it
[56:26] sets us up in the image of god and
[56:29] causes us to love the word all over the
[56:32] word
[56:33] and to be able to say and willing to say
[56:35] amen to every word even the parts that
[56:38] skin us even the parts that pinch us and
[56:40] even the parts we know we don't get
[56:42] exactly right but in our heart we always
[56:44] want to get it right
[56:47] see
[56:49] that's that's the true word so he says i
[56:51] wonder if we are sufficiently impressed
[56:53] and i i have such a burden on my heart
[56:56] as this year ends we don't know how many
[56:58] more years we'll have
[57:00] we don't know
[57:01] it's not given to us to know
[57:04] we know that there's a finite number
[57:08] we know that it can't just keep going on
[57:12] we do know the ages have ended we do
[57:14] know the last message has come we do
[57:16] know the sign of the son of man
[57:17] melchizedek has already been
[57:18] demonstrated to the world and that was
[57:20] the last thing the gentiles would see
[57:22] before the
[57:24] before they're taken from the earth in a
[57:26] rapture and the anointing of the eagle
[57:29] lives flies east picks up moses and
[57:31] elijah and goes to the 144 000.
[57:34] brother brahm said then then then the
[57:36] church would be left in its cold formal
[57:38] creeds and denomination deadness and
[57:40] said they'll just have they'll they'll
[57:42] get a fair trial everybody will they'll
[57:44] get a fair trial but i i don't want i'd
[57:47] rather i'm afraid i'll lose at my trial
[57:50] because i don't have enough good works
[57:52] and i got too many problems i'd rather
[57:54] just be counted in christ and that way
[57:56] when i get here he'll say have a seat on
[57:59] the throne because you gave your life to
[58:01] christ and identified you in the death
[58:03] burial and resurrection of christ
[58:06] your sins came before you and they were
[58:08] met in christ you're already innocent
[58:09] get on the throne
[58:11] but some men sins follow them and they
[58:13] have to give an account for it there
[58:14] because they didn't give it to christ
[58:16] see
[58:18] and so it when
[58:20] christ cannot be the
[58:22] uh a propitiation for everybody he he
[58:26] his his life was a propitiation for the
[58:28] whole world he died for the sins of the
[58:30] whole world but if you won't let him be
[58:34] amen
[58:36] uh uh remember a pardon is only a pardon
[58:40] if it be received as a pardon see
[58:43] so
[58:44] when he says here i wonder i want you to
[58:47] answer it within your heart today
[58:49] having me having sit here and i've i've
[58:51] taken my first 15 minutes just showing
[58:54] you uh what god has done in our in our
[58:57] in this hour and what god is moving and
[58:59] i want i want to add have you asked your
[59:01] own self in your own deepest heart are
[59:03] you sufficiently impressed with the word
[59:06] in our midst and what it came to do are
[59:08] you are you say well how would i know
[59:10] what's the measuring standard how will i
[59:12] know if i'm sufficiently i'm impressed
[59:14] but how will i know if i'm sufficiently
[59:16] impressed if you're allowing it to
[59:18] operate in your life
[59:22] because then you're when you allow it to
[59:24] operate in your life you're basically
[59:26] you're basically saying
[59:28] once i met christ the word i decided i
[59:30] didn't want to be me anymore i wanted to
[59:31] be him
[59:33] see
[59:33] but if you still want to be you
[59:36] and you just want to have him as a buddy
[59:38] you just want him on your social media
[59:40] feed and that's really all he is to you
[59:42] just a god of convenience like a vending
[59:44] machine you get in trouble you say a
[59:46] quick prayer you drop 50 cent in the
[59:48] machine get a pack of crackers
[59:50] you know or or or are you you write a
[59:53] letter to santa claus some believer in
[59:55] your family say hey can y'all pray for
[59:56] me
[59:58] see what's the matter with your prayers
[1:00:02] see
[1:00:04] see so are are you sufficiently
[1:00:06] impressed with the word in our midst
[1:00:10] unto the church of god
[1:00:13] which is at
[1:00:14] corinth
[1:00:16] to them that are sanctified in christ
[1:00:18] jesus i don't know how far i'll get
[1:00:19] today but i'm going to stop it at a
[1:00:20] decent time so just bear with me it's a
[1:00:23] little bit of a teaching
[1:00:25] called to be saints not called to just
[1:00:27] be church members called to be saints
[1:00:30] so that all in every place that call
[1:00:33] upon the name of jesus christ our lord
[1:00:35] that my life is to accomplish that that
[1:00:38] that that in every place that all in
[1:00:41] every place call upon the name of jesus
[1:00:44] christ our lord this word church of
[1:00:46] course is a familiar greek word to us
[1:00:48] it's ecclesia
[1:00:50] it means the called out and now
[1:00:53] i want to point out some things that uh
[1:00:55] some observations i made studying this i
[1:00:58] found
[1:00:59] first of all
[1:01:00] that that that that this is the only
[1:01:03] church here at corinth
[1:01:05] of all of his other letters when he
[1:01:07] wrote to galatian
[1:01:09] you know when he wrote to the hebrews
[1:01:11] when he wrote to the romans when he when
[1:01:13] he he wrote to the church at
[1:01:15] thessalonica all the various places in
[1:01:18] his letters his pastoral letters to
[1:01:19] timothy and to titus his letter to
[1:01:21] philemon and all these different uh
[1:01:24] letters that paul wrote that only to the
[1:01:26] church
[1:01:27] at corinth did he
[1:01:30] use this term addressing them as the
[1:01:33] church of god
[1:01:34] see it's the it's the only church that
[1:01:37] paul directly greeted using the phrase
[1:01:41] the church of god now there are a few
[1:01:43] times a few other times two or three to
[1:01:45] be exact
[1:01:47] where the term is used in a broader
[1:01:48] sense he's preaching in acts 20. take
[1:01:51] heed there for unto yourselves into all
[1:01:53] the flock this is in ephesus over he
[1:01:55] remember he got off the boat and the
[1:01:56] leaders met him the last time they were
[1:01:58] going to see him he said you won't see
[1:01:59] my face again and in this sermon he says
[1:02:02] you know he's he's giving them um you
[1:02:05] know uh preaching to them admonishing
[1:02:07] them take heed therefore unto yourselves
[1:02:09] into all the flock over which the holy
[1:02:12] ghost hath made you overseers to feed
[1:02:14] the church of god
[1:02:16] which he hath purchased with his own
[1:02:18] blood so it's just a general sense uh
[1:02:20] god has made you overseers over the
[1:02:23] church of god
[1:02:24] in his pastoral letter to timothy first
[1:02:26] timothy 3 5 for if if a man know not how
[1:02:30] to rule his own house how shall he take
[1:02:32] care of the church of god
[1:02:35] and so and then and then in galatians he
[1:02:38] says in galatians 1 13 for ye have heard
[1:02:40] of my conversation in times past in the
[1:02:44] jews religion how that beyond measure i
[1:02:47] persecuted the church of god and wasted
[1:02:49] it so there's a few times where he he
[1:02:52] uses it generally speaking and it caught
[1:02:54] my attention in galatians 1 and 13 where
[1:02:57] he says in times past in the jews
[1:03:00] religion and i thought wow think about
[1:03:03] that he was a a pharisee of the
[1:03:06] pharisees he was the super jew
[1:03:09] he was like the ultimate jew
[1:03:11] and now
[1:03:13] he he's trying to he's trying to
[1:03:14] demonstrate in his language a clear cut
[1:03:18] line from his former spirituality he's
[1:03:22] basically saying i'm nothing like i used
[1:03:25] to be
[1:03:27] in my former spirituality among the jews
[1:03:30] even i am a hebrew but and i and i
[1:03:33] worship god according to the religion of
[1:03:35] the jews i was like the chief jew but
[1:03:38] i'm here to tell you that now that i'm a
[1:03:40] christian
[1:03:41] my spiritual life is nothing at all like
[1:03:45] it was before i am a completely unique
[1:03:50] individual
[1:03:51] i worship at a whole new level
[1:03:57] i mean 21st century that would have been
[1:04:00] politically incorrect that would have
[1:04:02] been offensive he'd have got canceled
[1:04:03] for saying that
[1:04:05] that's anti-semitic you know we're all
[1:04:07] the same no we're not
[1:04:10] no we're not god loves everybody but i'm
[1:04:12] here to tell you god has a family that
[1:04:15] come out of his loins and they and and
[1:04:17] and they didn't even choose god they
[1:04:19] didn't even make a choice god jesus said
[1:04:21] you haven't chosen me i've chosen you
[1:04:24] see
[1:04:26] and
[1:04:27] christians believers and unbelievers are
[1:04:29] not the same they're not related they're
[1:04:31] not third cousins fifth cousins tenth
[1:04:33] cousins 14 times removed
[1:04:36] you're either an unbeliever or you're a
[1:04:37] believer there's no halfway if you're a
[1:04:40] half christian you're a hundred percent
[1:04:41] an unbeliever
[1:04:43] see you're a hundred percent unconverted
[1:04:46] all right so he's in times past in the
[1:04:50] jews religion so he's he's making this
[1:04:52] clear-cut line
[1:04:54] from his former faith
[1:04:56] now you know maybe
[1:04:58] maybe the church at corinth
[1:05:01] needed a constant reminder of who
[1:05:04] exactly they were that's my much my
[1:05:07] thinking on it when i when i have and
[1:05:09] i've been for weeks examining this
[1:05:11] question who is the church what is it
[1:05:13] what's its purpose what's its function
[1:05:15] what is its characteristics what is it
[1:05:17] accomplishing how do you get in it how
[1:05:19] do you know you're in it and but then i
[1:05:21] was always you know this question that
[1:05:24] was always in my mind why corinth it's
[1:05:26] the only church see in some of the other
[1:05:28] ones it's to the saints which be add or
[1:05:31] to them that are called be at but but
[1:05:34] only to corinth does he say to the
[1:05:37] church of god
[1:05:39] and and i and i concluded that
[1:05:41] you know there was something about
[1:05:43] corinth maybe they had the same problem
[1:05:46] that brother branham is referring to in
[1:05:48] the pergameon church age i wonder if we
[1:05:51] are sufficiently impressed with the word
[1:05:53] in our midst and i have to and i i feel
[1:05:56] the need under the unction of the holy
[1:05:57] spirit to remind us
[1:06:01] why we're here what's our purpose what's
[1:06:03] it all about
[1:06:07] and so he's coming now to corinth
[1:06:10] and he's saying you're the church of god
[1:06:12] i need to remind you corinth
[1:06:15] the church at corinthia i need to remind
[1:06:18] you i feel the need i don't i don't i
[1:06:21] didn't start any of my other letters i
[1:06:23] didn't address galatia like this
[1:06:25] i didn't i didn't agree addressed the
[1:06:27] hebrews or the romans like this i didn't
[1:06:30] write to thessalonica like this i'm only
[1:06:32] coming to you and i'm gonna do it twice
[1:06:34] in my first letter and i'm gonna do it
[1:06:36] again in my second letter first and
[1:06:37] second corinthians to the church of god
[1:06:41] you need to be reminded corinthia
[1:06:44] of exactly who you are see
[1:06:48] now that makes a little bit of sense
[1:06:50] knowing their characteristics we know
[1:06:52] a little bit about corinthian i'll get
[1:06:54] to that in a minute
[1:06:56] so the church of god we we showed you
[1:06:58] what it means uh to be the church
[1:07:03] uh ecclesia i wanted to make a point on
[1:07:05] that where did i go oh yeah so all right
[1:07:08] so we did we made that point so now it's
[1:07:11] the church it's not just a church but
[1:07:14] it's the church of god and this is theos
[1:07:16] in the in the greek it's a masculine
[1:07:19] noun meaning god
[1:07:21] now
[1:07:22] we know that brother jason we know that
[1:07:24] we know who god is we know why it would
[1:07:25] be called the church of god but you need
[1:07:27] to understand the
[1:07:29] the aim of the holy spirit
[1:07:32] behind using the language that they did
[1:07:34] because there's not one word in here
[1:07:35] that's an accident
[1:07:38] every word every jot and tittle every
[1:07:40] iota every punctuation everything
[1:07:43] heavens and earth will pass away but not
[1:07:44] one word will ever fail see
[1:07:47] and so every word is purposely
[1:07:49] inserted by god as he moved on holy men
[1:07:52] of old
[1:07:54] and and the reason i make a point of
[1:07:56] this theos as being a masculine noun
[1:07:59] meaning god
[1:08:00] is because originally remember in the
[1:08:03] greek world of ridge which was the
[1:08:04] heathen world right
[1:08:06] only israel had a concept of the true
[1:08:09] and living god the rest of the world
[1:08:10] were heathens all right
[1:08:13] but we find then that
[1:08:15] that
[1:08:16] that originally this word theos
[1:08:19] was actually used by the heathens
[1:08:23] it was actually used by the heathens to
[1:08:25] describe their gods
[1:08:27] and they had all kinds of different
[1:08:29] ideas of gods and demons and angels and
[1:08:32] multiple various polytheistic beliefs
[1:08:36] but but when we're when we come down and
[1:08:38] the once the new testament church
[1:08:41] came into being
[1:08:43] then then the apostles took their
[1:08:46] authority to rest
[1:08:48] that word from the world and say uh-uh
[1:08:52] that's not what that word should be
[1:08:54] applied to because there are no other
[1:08:57] gods but the true god
[1:08:59] and so we realize that in that in times
[1:09:02] past it had been used by the heathen but
[1:09:04] in the new testament it became known as
[1:09:08] the name of the true god
[1:09:11] i know you heathens you've got an idea
[1:09:13] of gods and demons and angels paul stood
[1:09:15] at mars hill and said you've got a tomb
[1:09:18] you're so you're so hedonistic you build
[1:09:21] a tomb to the unknown god just so you
[1:09:23] don't accidentally leave one out
[1:09:26] how ridiculous that is he says however
[1:09:29] i'm gonna i'm gonna use it for my text
[1:09:31] today and i'm gonna tell you i'm met the
[1:09:33] unknown god he's unknown to you but i
[1:09:36] know him and i want to tell you about
[1:09:37] him
[1:09:38] i met him on the road to damascus a
[1:09:40] great light knocked me off the saddle
[1:09:42] and then today i am his apostle
[1:09:46] see
[1:09:47] so so now
[1:09:49] when it when when paul is saying
[1:09:52] i'm writing to the church of god you
[1:09:55] need to understand how much emphasis how
[1:09:57] much purpose
[1:09:59] was behind that how much uh uh
[1:10:02] narrowly defining ideology that paul was
[1:10:06] saying i'm not just i'm not using the
[1:10:08] church of god in a loose term that
[1:10:11] everybody can claim and everybody can
[1:10:12] misunderstand and anybody can put it on
[1:10:14] their church no no no no no i'm telling
[1:10:17] you that there is an exact church of god
[1:10:22] amen
[1:10:23] it's very narrowly defined
[1:10:26] see
[1:10:27] it's the only provided way
[1:10:30] that god has
[1:10:33] and so
[1:10:35] so
[1:10:36] you know a first takeaway
[1:10:41] from paul using this term
[1:10:44] to me a first takeaway is that paul
[1:10:46] needs to remind the believers at corinth
[1:10:50] that their lives
[1:10:52] were to be a guiding example
[1:10:55] to everyone else around him
[1:10:58] that's contained that's his usage of the
[1:11:01] word
[1:11:01] that you need to understand corinth i'm
[1:11:03] calling you they must have had a problem
[1:11:05] in this
[1:11:06] there must have been a deficit he don't
[1:11:08] have to do that to any other church
[1:11:11] he he but he comes and we find out that
[1:11:14] he's he's making a clear
[1:11:16] distinction to say listen you're the
[1:11:19] church of
[1:11:21] god
[1:11:23] not not an idea of god not a half true
[1:11:27] understanding not an almost
[1:11:28] understanding but there is an exact
[1:11:31] understanding and you're called to that
[1:11:34] purpose and i need to remind you corinth
[1:11:36] i need to remind you that your lives
[1:11:40] your lifestyle and the light you're
[1:11:42] supposed to be a light
[1:11:44] to the world and you're therefore your
[1:11:47] life should be a guiding example to
[1:11:50] everyone around you what it means to
[1:11:53] really be
[1:11:55] the church of god
[1:11:59] to guide others
[1:12:01] from the
[1:12:02] heathenism and the
[1:12:04] misunderstanding of who they thought god
[1:12:07] was to make clear who the true god was
[1:12:10] what he was like
[1:12:11] his true nature his true characteristics
[1:12:16] and what he expected when they heard
[1:12:20] what he expected of humanity
[1:12:22] when they heard of the sufferings of
[1:12:24] christ
[1:12:26] this was the this was the responsibility
[1:12:29] of the believers
[1:12:31] that when people heard of the sufferings
[1:12:34] of christ that that that the people had
[1:12:37] an example to look at to say
[1:12:40] so the sufferings of christ came to
[1:12:43] bring me from heathenism to you people
[1:12:46] yes exactly it's to take you from
[1:12:49] unbelief and and make you like christ
[1:12:52] we're only like we are because his life
[1:12:54] lives in us we were as no good as you
[1:12:57] were at one time and we're still have no
[1:13:00] worthiness in our own self but but
[1:13:02] christ our we're trying to tell you it's
[1:13:04] not just a teaching what we're here to
[1:13:06] demonstrate to you is that his literal
[1:13:08] life will come down and live inside you
[1:13:11] so it won't just be theology it won't
[1:13:14] just be something human this is going to
[1:13:16] be not natural
[1:13:18] this is going to be supernatural
[1:13:23] see
[1:13:25] to make it clear
[1:13:28] that should be considered friends i
[1:13:30] think that should be considered in our
[1:13:32] lesson today
[1:13:34] one of the first and
[1:13:36] perhaps foremost things we need to
[1:13:38] remind ourselves of today especially
[1:13:41] today
[1:13:43] especially today
[1:13:45] because we are here
[1:13:47] and we are filled
[1:13:50] with his spirit how many believe you're
[1:13:51] the church of god
[1:13:53] that you're filled with his spirit six
[1:13:56] of you
[1:13:57] how many believe you're the church of
[1:13:59] god filled with his spirit half of you
[1:14:02] how many believe
[1:14:04] i mean if you if half of you don't
[1:14:06] believe you're that i need to change my
[1:14:08] text and go to john 3 16 and preach a
[1:14:10] preach a sinner's sermon
[1:14:13] how many believe that you're the church
[1:14:14] of god filled with his spirit and how
[1:14:16] many are happy to be
[1:14:18] say i'm happy to have his life inside me
[1:14:21] it to me i wasn't living until his life
[1:14:23] came inside me
[1:14:25] see
[1:14:26] so then
[1:14:27] so then we're here
[1:14:29] we're filled with his spirit
[1:14:32] to set the record straight
[1:14:34] from the false narrative
[1:14:36] that the world is fed on today and
[1:14:38] especially today i was so appreciating
[1:14:42] brother matt's uh final installment in
[1:14:45] that thought i suppose it's his final
[1:14:47] installment uh you know there were so
[1:14:49] many good points to be made but to me
[1:14:51] the the real the real i mean the target
[1:14:54] where because you you realize that that
[1:14:57] what is happening is is satan is just
[1:15:01] playing
[1:15:02] he's just playing the world and it
[1:15:04] doesn't matter which side of the
[1:15:05] political law you stand on you you've
[1:15:07] got you've got a nation rising up and
[1:15:11] even people who were formally in their
[1:15:13] in their leftist wokest wokism socialism
[1:15:16] communism and and and trying to take
[1:15:18] care of all that you've got some of them
[1:15:20] going i don't want anything to do with
[1:15:22] that this is ruining my kids
[1:15:24] teenagers are committing suicide people
[1:15:26] are dying in record numbers this is a
[1:15:29] bad way to go everybody's going to run
[1:15:30] to the church and you know what's going
[1:15:32] to happen they're going to run right
[1:15:34] into the arms of mama
[1:15:37] it literally to defeat communism puts
[1:15:40] romanism in the driver's seat
[1:15:44] and brother and said that when he meets
[1:15:45] west then rome's in the driver's seat
[1:15:47] and she has been for a while now see
[1:15:50] ever since the retreat of communism
[1:15:52] under glasnost and perestroika and the
[1:15:55] berlin wall comes down ever since that
[1:15:57] time rome has been maneuvering to take
[1:15:59] the world to take the world and build an
[1:16:01] image to the beast with the under the
[1:16:03] under the authority of america because
[1:16:05] she's in revelation 13 right
[1:16:07] listen friends don't be asleep at the
[1:16:09] switch
[1:16:10] this is what's happening around us and
[1:16:12] your life is here to be a shining light
[1:16:14] to say don't go that way don't go that
[1:16:15] way hey hey hey everybody don't go that
[1:16:18] that denominationalism will lead you to
[1:16:20] the mark of the beast what yes i can
[1:16:23] prove it by the bible
[1:16:25] don't go that way come to the real come
[1:16:27] and be the real church of god
[1:16:30] see
[1:16:32] we've got to set the record straight
[1:16:35] on this false narrative i told brother
[1:16:37] matt i said
[1:16:38] that is so important especially that's
[1:16:40] why i've been emphasizing to the senior
[1:16:42] youth particularly everybody but
[1:16:44] particularly the senior youth because
[1:16:46] that that message of life that gospel of
[1:16:48] laodicea that gospel of this evil age
[1:16:51] that that literally
[1:16:53] is is what they're hearing in the
[1:16:55] schools they're hearing it uh at work
[1:16:57] they're they're hearing it they see it
[1:16:59] on their social media feeds it's it's
[1:17:01] being put in their face in all kinds of
[1:17:03] forms of entertainment
[1:17:05] and there has to be somebody to stand up
[1:17:07] and set the record straight
[1:17:09] and say that's not christianity and
[1:17:11] that's going to be doomed to a devil's
[1:17:13] hell but there is a way to escape it
[1:17:17] see
[1:17:19] so we've got to set the record straight
[1:17:21] from the from the false narrative about
[1:17:24] what god is
[1:17:26] set the record straight on the false
[1:17:28] narrative of what it means to be
[1:17:31] a rapture-ready church
[1:17:33] not in word only but in the power and
[1:17:37] demonstration of the holy ghost see
[1:17:43] there are millions of people today
[1:17:46] the overwhelming majority overwhelming
[1:17:50] above and beyond running away majority
[1:17:55] millions times millions times tens of
[1:17:57] times hundreds of
[1:17:59] millions of people
[1:18:01] who take the name of christian
[1:18:05] but are coming up short of redemption
[1:18:09] now the bible said it would be that way
[1:18:10] it's not a surprise that's not a
[1:18:12] conspiracy that's just the way the bible
[1:18:13] said it would be that at the end time it
[1:18:15] would be so close between the the true
[1:18:18] and the untrue
[1:18:19] that they look so much so similar
[1:18:22] that it would even deceive god's elected
[1:18:24] family if that were possible thank god
[1:18:26] it's not
[1:18:27] see
[1:18:28] and so
[1:18:29] people who do that their only chance to
[1:18:31] gain access to heaven if they can gain
[1:18:33] it at all will be via a tribulation
[1:18:36] period and then they'll come to trial at
[1:18:38] the great white throne of judgment in
[1:18:40] the book of revelation that's not a
[1:18:41] place i want to be unless i'm seated on
[1:18:43] the throne with christ
[1:18:46] so what is
[1:18:48] the true church
[1:18:50] not the denomination of course they
[1:18:53] you have a denomination called the
[1:18:55] church of god but
[1:18:57] not not referring to the people they're
[1:18:58] fine people
[1:18:59] i know quite a few of them lovely people
[1:19:01] i wish they would come out of that
[1:19:03] system before it's too late so we're not
[1:19:05] talking about the denomination who who
[1:19:07] took the who took the name of the church
[1:19:10] of god as a title and actually don't
[1:19:11] they don't even realize they created an
[1:19:13] imagery of blasphemy
[1:19:15] because it now just becomes a
[1:19:17] blasphemous name see
[1:19:19] because it doesn't accept the living
[1:19:21] word and so again now again
[1:19:25] i'm coming back full circle so it's
[1:19:27] interesting and notable to me
[1:19:31] that paul only opens his greeting this
[1:19:34] way
[1:19:35] to the saints at corinth
[1:19:38] perhaps he
[1:19:40] he didn't feel he could use
[1:19:42] a more specific title
[1:19:44] um you know such as in his other letters
[1:19:47] where he would say unto the saints or
[1:19:48] unto the chosen or unto this and he
[1:19:51] didn't feel he could do that in neither
[1:19:52] first corinthians nor second corinthians
[1:19:54] this this this this this broader term of
[1:19:58] course uh is is is is necessary because
[1:20:01] corinth
[1:20:02] you know corinth
[1:20:04] above above all other churches was such
[1:20:07] a mixed multitude
[1:20:10] amen such a mixed multitude corinth is
[1:20:12] well known in christian history to be a
[1:20:16] troubled and conflicted
[1:20:18] group of people
[1:20:20] very conflicted too many too many there
[1:20:24] uh had a troubling relationship with the
[1:20:27] truth too many there were living lives
[1:20:29] of secret sinners and and to make
[1:20:31] matters worse the church was turning a
[1:20:33] blind eye to it
[1:20:35] and paul paul actually
[1:20:37] you know
[1:20:38] this is examples where he comes in he
[1:20:40] says take my spirit there with you and
[1:20:42] take such a one out from under the blood
[1:20:44] and paul wasn't he wasn't joking this is
[1:20:46] spiritual warfare
[1:20:48] and and we find that that that you know
[1:20:51] they're they're there now it's
[1:20:53] interesting let me show you because
[1:20:55] there there are some churches you know
[1:20:57] you know if you take if you take the
[1:21:00] book of ephesians
[1:21:01] and and and you you can just go through
[1:21:03] the book of ephesians philippians and
[1:21:05] colossians and you see of course that
[1:21:08] that ephesians is is is the whole
[1:21:11] program of god for the church for the
[1:21:13] woman remember the church is a woman and
[1:21:16] it's the whole program of god you know
[1:21:18] you you she was cho he opens up how that
[1:21:21] she was called she was chosen she's
[1:21:23] quickened in chapter three she's made up
[1:21:25] of jews and gentiles in chapter four you
[1:21:28] know
[1:21:28] there's a there's a five-fold ministry
[1:21:30] in chapter in chapter five he tells them
[1:21:33] how to walk in chapter six he tells them
[1:21:36] how to fight
[1:21:37] amen
[1:21:38] you jump philippians and go to
[1:21:40] colossians and that's the program of the
[1:21:42] man
[1:21:43] the who you know the the whole program
[1:21:45] of the man in 115 where it says uh who
[1:21:49] is speaking of christ who is the image
[1:21:51] of the invisible god the firstborn of
[1:21:52] every creature so the whole program of
[1:21:55] the man all is subject to him and he's
[1:21:58] the head of the body
[1:21:59] see and so you've got the woman the
[1:22:01] church in ephesians and then you've got
[1:22:04] the man in colossians and in between
[1:22:06] that you've got the book of philippians
[1:22:08] which is the marriage because the book
[1:22:10] of philippians is the only church paul
[1:22:12] never had to set him in order he never
[1:22:14] had to correct them for anything
[1:22:17] because they were an invisible union
[1:22:20] hallelujah let this mind he said to the
[1:22:22] philippians which was in christ be in
[1:22:25] you
[1:22:26] see that's under the invisible union
[1:22:28] between woman and man is the marriage
[1:22:32] and there were there were his other
[1:22:34] churches that like philippians that he
[1:22:36] never absolutely ever had to correct and
[1:22:39] and and but it's very it's very evident
[1:22:41] that paul loved corinthian
[1:22:44] he loved the corinthians
[1:22:46] he loved that church
[1:22:49] with a very great and a very
[1:22:51] tender affection
[1:22:54] he felt particularly close to them
[1:22:57] see above other ones he felt
[1:22:59] particularly close to he pastored for a
[1:23:02] little while in ephesus
[1:23:04] but the corinthian people you know it's
[1:23:06] it's as if he felt like in in the way he
[1:23:09] describes it it's as if at times he felt
[1:23:11] like a foster parent to them
[1:23:14] second corinthians 6 13 he says i speak
[1:23:16] unto you as i speak as unto my children
[1:23:21] see
[1:23:22] but the corinthian believers seem to
[1:23:24] have you know gotten more of their
[1:23:27] fair share
[1:23:28] of corrective ministry from the apostle
[1:23:32] he spent a whole lot of time correcting
[1:23:34] them you know so what is the church of
[1:23:37] god what is the church of god well
[1:23:39] it's a
[1:23:40] it's a body of gathering people
[1:23:44] that's one of the things that it is it's
[1:23:46] far more than that you know whether we
[1:23:48] can gather or not we're part of a
[1:23:50] mystical body
[1:23:51] whether we're in four walls or not we're
[1:23:53] part of supposed to be part of a
[1:23:54] mystical body well if you didn't have a
[1:23:56] church to go to at all you and if you
[1:23:58] were like daniel who spent your whole
[1:24:00] life with no bible studies no church
[1:24:02] meetings no worship services you had no
[1:24:04] other believers around you to worship
[1:24:06] with and yet every day you went to god
[1:24:08] in prayer three times a day and you kept
[1:24:10] yourself pure for 60 years
[1:24:13] daniel stayed true didn't even have a
[1:24:15] church to go to
[1:24:16] see
[1:24:18] and so and even his his his fellowship
[1:24:20] with the other three hebrews because
[1:24:23] they were
[1:24:24] they were officers in the kingdom and
[1:24:25] they had their duties to do and he
[1:24:27] rarely ever got to see them there's
[1:24:29] there's really no interplay a little bit
[1:24:31] between them but not not a whole lot for
[1:24:33] 60 years brother ram said he had no one
[1:24:37] so it is
[1:24:39] it is a a gathered group of like-minded
[1:24:42] followers of the lord it is a group
[1:24:46] who are who are anointed what does it
[1:24:48] mean to be the church of god it means
[1:24:50] that you're part of a group who have
[1:24:52] been anointed by god you've been united
[1:24:56] as brother branham said mystically
[1:24:58] supernaturally united to the spirit of
[1:25:01] god by a very supernatural rebirth
[1:25:06] i'm here to tell you the the real new
[1:25:07] birth is a mystery that no one can
[1:25:10] unlock you you can't give it yourself to
[1:25:12] yourself you can't give it to anyone god
[1:25:15] rich in mercy has to offer it to you and
[1:25:17] when he does oh take it right away
[1:25:21] come into this body you have to be born
[1:25:23] until you cannot join it amen
[1:25:27] the the idea of joining a church is
[1:25:29] ridiculous it was never that way in the
[1:25:32] in the in the early days as brother
[1:25:34] branham said i was i was i'm a branham
[1:25:36] he said no one ever asked me to join the
[1:25:38] branham family he said i was born of
[1:25:39] branham
[1:25:41] i i'm i'm a watkins i no one never asked
[1:25:43] me to join it i was born into it by the
[1:25:45] time i got here i already was it
[1:25:48] amen so
[1:25:50] so you know it's don't and don't don't
[1:25:53] give don't give your parents you young
[1:25:54] people say well i didn't ask to be
[1:25:56] brought here
[1:25:58] you might get the answer brother eddie
[1:26:00] gave me yeah and if you had it i would
[1:26:01] have said no
[1:26:04] i think he got that from somewhere else
[1:26:07] i don't think he meant it genuinely
[1:26:11] but i but i'm born into the family of
[1:26:14] god
[1:26:16] now it's certainly not evidenced by
[1:26:18] sensation but neither is it absent from
[1:26:20] deep emotion in the heart
[1:26:22] it's not evidence by sensation that we
[1:26:24] don't chase sensationalism
[1:26:26] but it certainly it certainly is not
[1:26:30] absent from deep felt emotion that runs
[1:26:34] deep in your heart and will and and can
[1:26:37] move you and affect your life and effect
[1:26:40] change in your life and you can be going
[1:26:42] a certain direction friends you can be
[1:26:44] involved in a certain thing and suddenly
[1:26:47] sometime here comes god and the holy
[1:26:49] spirit comes down and you begin to feel
[1:26:51] the atmosphere change and the next thing
[1:26:53] you know your hands are up the presence
[1:26:55] of god is there and the lord is saying
[1:26:57] you listen son listen daughter you need
[1:26:59] to you know you need to get rid of that
[1:27:02] you know i'm not pleased with that and
[1:27:04] you're sitting there take and something
[1:27:06] that you obviously like doing because
[1:27:07] you wouldn't have been doing it
[1:27:08] otherwise no one forced you to do it and
[1:27:10] there you are with tears running down
[1:27:11] your face saying yes lord oh stop i'll
[1:27:14] give it up i'll do anything for you lord
[1:27:16] i'll do anything for you
[1:27:18] see
[1:27:20] it's it's something that's real it's not
[1:27:22] something you imagine the presence of
[1:27:24] god is not an imaginary friend it's a
[1:27:27] real living entity it's a real being
[1:27:30] he's he he's a he's he's god he's the
[1:27:33] creator who comes down to do what bring
[1:27:36] you into a body of fellowship a mystical
[1:27:39] union between you and god
[1:27:42] and it affects your life and changes
[1:27:44] your life for the purpose of you
[1:27:46] becoming the church of god so that then
[1:27:48] he can come down into you through you
[1:27:50] out of you and affect all of the
[1:27:52] heathenisms and misunderstandings and
[1:27:53] misinterpreted theologies around you
[1:27:57] and he does it not because not because
[1:27:59] all y'all like me get up in a pulpit and
[1:28:02] shout and scream and spit and wave your
[1:28:03] hands and turn red and get exhausted but
[1:28:06] because your life that you live
[1:28:08] out in the community
[1:28:11] so it is the
[1:28:13] it is
[1:28:14] hey laodicea
[1:28:16] laodicea who hates to hear this
[1:28:18] i hope i don't have any layered sins
[1:28:19] here today
[1:28:21] so it matters where you go
[1:28:23] or don't
[1:28:24] it matters what you do or don't it
[1:28:26] matters how you dress or don't it
[1:28:28] matters what you say or don't it matters
[1:28:31] what kind of friends you have or not
[1:28:33] it matters about your priorities your
[1:28:36] schedule it matters your life was given
[1:28:39] to you by the life giver and he expects
[1:28:42] it to be in his usage and that makes us
[1:28:45] the church of god
[1:28:47] otherwise we're not the church of god
[1:28:50] we're just a
[1:28:52] creation of our of our own imagination
[1:28:54] we're fooling ourselves
[1:28:59] they have all kinds of
[1:29:01] ways and tools and
[1:29:03] things that that that the
[1:29:06] the misunder
[1:29:07] the the the people go about with their
[1:29:10] misunderstanding
[1:29:11] and in man-made religion around the
[1:29:13] world as i said the overwhelming far
[1:29:15] above and beyond running away
[1:29:17] population of christianity has an idea
[1:29:20] an idea
[1:29:21] of what it means to be the church of god
[1:29:24] and think themselves to be
[1:29:26] and and that's that's why god like he
[1:29:29] took israel
[1:29:30] and dropped them right in the middle
[1:29:32] east
[1:29:34] right down in a place where all around
[1:29:36] them is nothing but canaanites and
[1:29:38] heathens
[1:29:39] and he set them there to be a light to
[1:29:41] send out rays of truth in all directions
[1:29:44] so that people who thought they had an
[1:29:46] understanding of theos or whatever the
[1:29:48] hebrew term is they thought they had an
[1:29:50] understanding of god and they had a
[1:29:52] misunderstanding
[1:29:54] they thought he was a statue or the sun
[1:29:56] or the wind or an animal or a
[1:29:58] four-footed creature or a reptile
[1:30:00] because because dishon dishonest people
[1:30:03] dishonest religious leaders had told
[1:30:04] them that
[1:30:06] and so jesus comes on the scene to show
[1:30:08] what god was really like
[1:30:12] this is what you say how how i would
[1:30:14] love to live a life that is completely
[1:30:16] pleasing to god wonderful you've got a
[1:30:19] model you've got four gospels that you
[1:30:21] can read and all kinds of epistles from
[1:30:23] the apostles telling you how he lived
[1:30:26] how he reacted how he acted how he
[1:30:29] thought
[1:30:30] what he said and it gives us a life but
[1:30:33] but more than anything else jesus didn't
[1:30:35] say i'm come you know so that you can
[1:30:38] have imitation
[1:30:41] i've come so that you can have life
[1:30:44] so that as i am in the father and the
[1:30:47] father in me so i will be in you and you
[1:30:51] will be in me
[1:30:52] that's what christianity is that makes
[1:30:57] the church of god see
[1:31:00] so i'm by no means you know they've got
[1:31:02] all of their satellite stuff i'm happy
[1:31:04] to use it myself they've got all of
[1:31:06] their tools we use it ourselves they've
[1:31:07] got printing printouts and flyers and
[1:31:10] you know and and and you know what's the
[1:31:12] one the the salesman the used car guy
[1:31:14] brother and tell the story uh where will
[1:31:16] you spend eternity i mean those things
[1:31:18] are all useful the sinner's prayer
[1:31:21] it's attractive i mean i i mean i'm not
[1:31:24] i'm by no means opposed to that that
[1:31:26] track called the sinner's prayer it's a
[1:31:27] very fine thing and no doubt it's useful
[1:31:29] for outreach no doubt it is you know or
[1:31:32] even reading the sinner's prayer out
[1:31:34] loud they want you to do that and that's
[1:31:36] a fine thing
[1:31:38] i'm not opposed to that i'm for
[1:31:39] something like that but the spiritual
[1:31:41] new birth is far more than just reading
[1:31:44] a sinner's prayer it's far more than a
[1:31:46] dry-eyed confession it's far more than
[1:31:48] reciting something written
[1:31:50] it's far more than signing your name or
[1:31:52] having a uh you know some kind of name
[1:31:55] that i'm the church of this or the
[1:31:56] church of that this thing is a
[1:31:58] life-giving power
[1:32:00] this thing is not in word only but in
[1:32:03] power and demonstration of the holy
[1:32:05] spirit the devils are subject to you
[1:32:07] that the holy ghost goes with you that
[1:32:09] your word spoken means something in the
[1:32:12] world
[1:32:13] and god will honor it and the devil will
[1:32:14] run from it
[1:32:18] that's why we're here that's what our
[1:32:20] lives are about
[1:32:22] we've got to be able to debunk the
[1:32:24] misunderstanding
[1:32:26] and the confusion the church of god
[1:32:29] is a fellowship of saints in the earth
[1:32:32] who share a common purpose to be
[1:32:35] representatives of god's kingdom how
[1:32:37] many want to be representatives of god's
[1:32:40] kingdom say i'm not here by the jason
[1:32:43] just to be a a half-baked christian why
[1:32:46] would i even put this in my schedule
[1:32:48] there's other things i could be doing
[1:32:49] and if you're not going to be a
[1:32:51] christian you're crazy you're nuts to
[1:32:52] come here if you made up your mind but
[1:32:55] i'm here to tell you
[1:32:56] why am i here brother jason why are you
[1:32:58] here because i don't want that
[1:33:00] shallowness
[1:33:02] i want to be part of a kingdom i want to
[1:33:04] be part of something real i want to be
[1:33:06] part of something eternal
[1:33:10] that has no ending
[1:33:14] it's a brotherhood
[1:33:17] it's a biota it's a body gathering of
[1:33:20] people it's a brotherhood of love
[1:33:24] it's a brotherhood of faith designed to
[1:33:27] enrich our lives
[1:33:29] i'm going to close here in a minute i
[1:33:30] can see i'm not going to get anywhere
[1:33:31] near done but i'm just going to pick one
[1:33:33] of these lines and stop
[1:33:36] it's a family
[1:33:39] the church of god
[1:33:41] is a family
[1:33:45] with compassion and care
[1:33:47] one for another
[1:33:49] i need you
[1:33:51] you need me

[1:34:15] you know it's incredible
[1:34:16] the harmony and i i can say this
[1:34:19] authoritatively because i've been in
[1:34:21] church my entire life
[1:34:23] and in this ranks of this message my
[1:34:24] entire life and i've been in churches
[1:34:26] all over and i've visited

[1:34:40] and i'm here to tell you and i'm not
[1:34:41] just saying this to make you feel good
[1:34:42] or to pat myself on the back because
[1:34:45] it's certainly not based on me if it is
[1:34:46] we'd have been a train wreck a long time
[1:34:48] ago
[1:34:48] i mean that quite sincerely that's not
[1:34:50] false humility i you don't realize how
[1:34:53] painfully aware of my shortcomings i
[1:34:55] constantly stay in
[1:34:57] i'm god keeps me humble
[1:35:01] oh but i'm here to tell you the harmony
[1:35:03] and the cooperation
[1:35:05] that we have among all of our bethel
[1:35:08] family is so rare

[1:35:12] undervalue what the beautiful thing that
[1:35:16] we have here it's so rare if not unique

[1:35:48] among all of this ministry team that god
