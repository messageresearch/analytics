maybe there's some that's a little bit nervous at that thought be in the presence of almighty God to see you Lord I think you've allowed us to see you in this in this day and time which we live we see you through a glass Darkly Lord we we can only see in part but we see our eyes are not closed as to what's going on as to to when you're coming Lord we believe we're in that period right now so to a great a great degree you have opened our eyes Lord how thankful we are for that Lord I'm very thankful this evening that you've allowed us to gather in this room together to go to church together this evening tonight Lord this is a special opportunity this is a a moment in time which we do not take for granted so Lord we offer it back to you we ask that you'd speak to us as you desire pray that you'd lift up the downcast you'd instruct those that need guidance Lord we need you now more than I think we ever have so Lord I I I ask you that you would just have the freedom to move among our hearts and Minds bring them both subject to the word of God I pray and give these moments into your hands to do it as you please in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray pray amen and amen God bless you isn't it wonderful to be in church tonight amen thank you musicians thank you uh what beautiful singing I wouldn't mind if you're standing Let's uh turn to the book of Ephesians and I want to read a passage of scripture there Ephesians chapter 5 just wanted to say a uh special thank you to brother Jason for allowing us to come and speak and to be here uh it's a real honor and a privilege and uh looking forward just to being a church together and I hope you are too uh I think it's normal that we'd be to church together on Sundays uh but it's just fun to get together on Wednesdays just breaks up the whole craziness of a week I think it's a lot of fun so uh always enjoys Wednesday night services and um um just trust that you're looking forward to hearing from him this evening Ephesians the fth chapter and I want to read in verse 14 Ephesians 5 and verse4 wherefor he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the days are evil may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated thank you for standing with me it's so good to see each and every one of you uh it's um it's just good to be here and I I wanted to say a special thank you as well uh Sister Sarah and I my my lovely wife um I wanted to say a special thank you to everybody that that made the Youth Camp possible it was fantastic it was a great Camp really enjoyed it uh surely lives were touched and just all that uh gave gave of their time and their love and their effort thank you very much uh I just really enjoyed it I know Sister Sarah and I we both just walked away uh refreshed and um uh just being with everybody so just wanted to say a special thank you to all of you and uh I bring you greetings from Christian Fellowship Tabernacle uh and all the uh all the saints there I think there's a few listening in tonight and um thrilled to be able to go to church with some amazing people uh there in Christiansburg Virginia so excited to them excited that they're listening in and uh good to be here amen you know I was um I was just thinking on the way here this evening uh about just uh what what we do here and to the world this is a very foolish thing uh a bunch of people getting together you have a man standing in spitting for an hour and they drive by in the normal business of life this seems like a very foolish thing and to too uh it is kind of foolish what we do and it's through the foolishness of preaching that the Lord would choose to save those that believe amen and that's the key is that we gather together because we believe and so I ask you this evening if you just pull on the word of God um and uh uh and if you have a need you have something that you want the Lord to speak to just pull on the pull on the presence of the Lord because I believe he's here you believe he's here tonight he promised he would be so we have no other we have no other alternative than to believe that he's here so I believe if he is here he can speak to you directly I absolutely believe that so let's just press into the Lord tonight uh I believe in uh I believe in in in the message of the hour I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ I believe in uh I believe the Lord sent a messenger in this last last day and that message is Christ in me the hope of glory you believe that uh I believe that the message of the hour many times we can over complicate things and to a large degree um when the seventh angel shall begin to sound the mystery should be finished and Christ is the mystery of God revealed and so his coming and who he is in me and who I am in him is is to me that's the message of the hour and I I press fully into the light that Christ has shown to us as Paul says here I I press fully into that and I I um I I believe that and I think I I believe that the next thing to happen is the change of our bodies I really believe that uh and I I believe that until the change of our bodies occurs we are in a period of maturing there's a difference between a growth period And there's a difference between a a period of maturing the stock grows but then ultimately the fruit comes on to the vine and it matures so the fruit matures we're in a maturing season and I I believe that God wants to mature us and I'm so thankful because I believe that God is still working on me when I receive the the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's when my life began and so I believe that he he intends that I would change and that I would grow I believe that the Lord uh intends for there to be progress yeah and progress is an interesting thing I was reading on progress recently and just studying a little bit and it's we would often times we'd think of progress as being a a steady incline when in actuality progress can be a a a bunch of squiggly lines up and down progress doesn't seem like progress all the time even though we are progressing so you may be in a period of decline or seemingly you may be in a period of decline when in actuality you're playing out the course of what progress looks like in your life and it's an amazing thought if if you really take a you look at a forest a forest the whole thing could be burned toi Smither and it's progressing it's just clearing out the the bad stuff and growing and it's the whole thing is burned um we have a local Forest we we we hike in every once in a while and uh there's there's Woods there and they they all burned um and you look at it today and that was years ago and you look at it today and it's beautiful and it's bursting with life so what progress may look what what you think progress may look like often times it's very different than that uh uh assumption progress is simply the the definition of it is forward or onward movement toward a destination so progress is just I'm just I'm moving toward my destination and I believe that we're all moving toward a very expected end a a specific Des ination and along the way as I progress I want to progress well you can choose how you progress to a large degree you have a lot of input and and and uh uh say in how well you progress uh the Lord doesn't um he he doesn't have a an army of robots he has an army of of individuals with the ability to think and to do and to side amen that's that's what free will is the Lord doesn't Force anybody through the uh through the Riven Veil he for ordained and and and called you to stand at Jordan's River but he pushes no one across by your own free will you step across the Riven Veil into the holy of holies you you you chose that uh uh to step fully into Christ amen so he called you to that but you made the decision to cross that Veil and I I believe that he uh along life's road we have choices that's why brother Brandon preached in the time of decision he he he he preached that we have a choice to make it's a it's a it's a a very U um uh important concept for us to understand in 1956 and making a way he says we grow we mature he says we find better things we talk of better things we wear better clothes we drive better automobiles we are progressing but God cannot progress in that way because he was always perfect to begin with so thanks be to God we can change but thanks be to God he doesn't so he doesn't change but you can and I praise God for that every moment of my life because I don't know about you but I don't I'm not perfect as of yet he is my perfection but I'm not perfect as of yet so as I progress I want to progress well and if that means I need to learn how to make better decisions how to uh communicate one to another better how to align myself to the scripture then bring it on because I want to progress well because one thing is for sure progress you will you will change change is inevitable it's the only constant of course you're going to change I have more gray hair than than the last time I was here and you do not so I don't know what's going on but I have a lot of gray hair and the last time I was here I don't think that I had that much right so I am changing like it or or not I want to choose to change and progress and mature well now in In this passage of scripture now I I believe that the Lord wants us to grow um you you you wouldn't want your child to remain a a spoiled child you train them in the way that they should go and thanks be to God he trains us and and and nurtures us and and comes alongside us that's what the the the holy spirit is is one that comes alongside and helps us to grow and mature and then Ephesians chapter 1 in verse uh I believe it's 17 he says and the spirit of wisdom and revelation will work in our midst according to our knowledge of him so we grow in Grace and in knowledge but the spirit of wisdom and of Revelation Works in that midst in in our midst to allow us to grow and progress well and that's why Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God so as our knowledge of him grows the spirit of wisdom and of Revelation the holy spirit in our midst allows and guides us leads us helps us make those decisions am what an interesting thing what an amazing thing brother Brandon believed in evolution if you ever uh brother Jason actually when a long time ago um in the early 2000s you were in Hickory and you preached on Evolution I was a very very young man at the time and I listened to that and it was the first time I had really understood that concept and I got it and I thought brother Brandon believed in evolution and and obviously we don't believe in evolution um uh we believe in creation and evolution after creation uh but brother Mana believed in that process of change he said you look at a little tadpole and you look at how they're in the in the water and then they grow up and then all of a sudden they become some other thing because they morph they change they grow so we all progress we all grow and uh we do so by the leading of the Holy Spirit you know what I find amazing is that families grow I was looking around at the camp and I am one of the old people when I was a camper I looked around and said those people are old and I was that guy this camp and I'm thinking I'm the one with gray hair I'm the I'm the guy I brought children from my church to this Camp I'm thinking whoa I was not ready for that I had my own little moment uh just apart from everybody families and and churches evolve a church is a living organizm it changes it grows it it contracts it expands it it changes it's nurtured by the leading of the Holy Spirit um your family grows and you you can choose uh to tr to allow your family to grow well you train up in in a child in the way that it goes you you your your family uh your kids all of a sudden are just old and they're moved out uh um you get one you get it figured out when they're young and I'm speaking from my parents perspective to me uh when I was a young child they they thought they had me figured out in I grew up and then I caused different kinds of headaches uh naturally so everybody grows and I think it's this amazing Concept in Philippians chapter 1 being confident of this this very thing that he which began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ we all progress and we progress every moment here in uh Ephesians chapter 5 the Apostle Paul he says um that you redeem the time and he uses this phrase and as to my knowledge he only uses this phrase one other time and that's in uh uh the book to the people at coloss um when he says walk in wisdom to them that are without Redeeming the time so he uses this phrase redeem the time but the the Greek phrase time um means it it implies an opportunity so redeem the time it it it it it looks at time as being a moment being an opportunity so redeem the opportunity that you have because you don't have the the the the past you don't have the future you have the present so you have the present moment to decide and to do well and to act and to be God placed You In This Moment he handcrafted this moment and gave it to you this Wednesday night you may look at this as just a normal Wednesday night in your life you may not be feeling well you've got work things all yada yada y you've got all the different things that you're thinking about but this moment was specifically crafted by almighty God for you and it's considered an opportunity what an amazing thing what an amazing concept time is an amazing thing now according to archaeologists and all the research back in the Babylonian and in in in Egyptian time they began to measure time probably 5,000 years ago we think of time and we think just take time for granted you may have not taken the time and thought about time I have and the the Egyptians and the Babylonians began to think about time and how it was created but it was actually far beyond that even in job it says our time on Earth is brief so the the concept of time is has always been uh present for for humans we've always thought of things in terms of of time Joseph uh um even job lived far beyond Joseph and before Moses way back and um when you talk about time you also have to talk about space because the two are relative to to one another am and when the Apostle Paul is saying redeem the time redeem the moment brother bam said this in 1961 in the true Easter seal he says now we just happened to think just watch this just a minute now Einstein proved by scientific that if two objects was coming at each other like two cars coming down from across the road if they were coming fast enough then they'd really have to be going fast like a billion miles per second but they could pass right through one another and never disturb a thing speed would do it pass right through one another without disturbing anything he says now if you'll notice I was standing here not long ago at Mount poar in California and I was noticing that there's a telescope 120 million years of light space and how many miles would be broke down but yet Heaven is so many billions and billions of light years beyond that he says till it's not even a thought of how would we get there it's the travel it'll be like the mind it's so fast it'll be faster I I if you could think of Heaven that's how quick you'd be there Jesus after he was resurrected came right through the walls right through the doors and stood and eat boiled fish and honeycomb Hallelujah he said speed no matter sooner than life has gone out of this body we're in the presence of God Yonder now interestingly brother brandom talks about Einstein because Einstein went so far God had to stop him Einstein uh understood the the the concept of time as it relates to space Einstein thought well naturally if you're going at the speed of light something zooms by you at the speed of light it just goes by you you can barely even see it it's going by at such speed and it's a a measure of time it's going by you in 186,000 ft per second so it's a measure of time and space Einstein said but time is is relative because if you're traveling with the speed of light everything else around it is going by really really fast so it's relative the the perception of time is relative to where you are fascinating isn't it and brother bam says Einstein uh um uh understood all of this and thus the theory of relativity you're relative to where you are so time is just a a um a perception of where you are but we have this idea of what we view time as we came here at 7:00 most of us came here at 7:00 we should have been here at 6:30 though right I can say that because I wasn't in here and I didn't know who got here at 6:30 or 7 and then I can leave tonight so we should be here at 6:30 can I get an amen uh and then uh you know we've got work tomorrow 9:00 we we go we think in terms of time we measure our lives and we look at all these things as as a measure of time now interestingly this the brother bam at the end of this quote he says this we only know as feet and inches and yards and miles and so forth we're in this Earthbound system but when we leave here brother oh my what a Time Hallelujah he says we're in this Earthbound system now the scientific def definition of time if you go and you look at it and what time is time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from past through the present to the Future that's the scientific definition of time it is the indefinite continued progress of events irreversible succession you can't have time back I don't know if you knew that or not but time doesn't you can't stop it you can't buy it it's in short supply you have a set period of time it is irreversible and it is irrevocable so he it's it's irreversible succession from past through the present to the Future that sounds familiar because in Hebrews chapter 138 it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it says in Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth in Revelations 22 I am the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end so the very scientific definition of time relates to who God is almost precisely an amazing thought now the that being said God created time and placed us within it am now the scripture very clearly says in Colossians 1 for in him all things were created things in heaven and in Earth visible and invisible whether Thrones or powers or rulers or authorities all things have been created through him and for him he is before all things and in him all things hold together so he created everything and it was created through him and for him so that would mean that time as we would understand it the succession of events in an irreversible order past present and future was a construct that God himself crafted now the amazing thing is that you and I are finite yeah we we are not uh in our flesh we are not Eternal we are finite meaning that the only context that we have to relate to who God is in is in terms of the beginning and the ending we can't grasp eternity if you try to think about eternity your mind stops because it's finite in other words God crafted this construct called time and then he places you and me within the context of it we can't relate to Eternity we don't have no idea what it means what it is the breadth of it the depth of it we don't understand but we know the beginning and we know the end we know that it's 9:00 and we know that the service is going to end 8:45 and 9:00 we know that the service is going to end at some point we think in terms of time so the only context that we have to relate to the world and to an expected end is the beginning so the only the only context that we have of of Life as we know it is within the context of time a construct that was directly and precisely crafted by almighty God from the beginning to the ending because he is the Alpha and the Omega all things were created through him and for him what an amazing thing now eternity the scientific def definition of Eternity or Eternal is this the continuing forever or indefinitely having no beginning and no end in time lasting forever and existing at all times Eternal can also mean always true or valid am so we understand it from the definition that that eternity always is it's always true it's always valid it never had a beginning and it never had an ending so it it's important and I want you to grasp this that God created the construct of time and then he placed Mankind in it time is is Relentless it's irrevocable it's irreversible you never get this precise moment back again amen think about that for a second and we just take Wednesday night for granted and this moment was so precisely crafted by God he placed you here and every single one of us in this room for some reason he had uh me here and you there and you there and you and we think that you know just I just came to church brother Steve no this was specially crafted by almighty God for a very specific purpose because all thing he makes all things beautiful in his time so within that context that you and I relate to he makes everything beautiful he works to the to the good pleasure of his will within that context what an amazing thing now God himself is eternal so he exists apart from the constraint of time right God God is the beginning and he is the ending but he never had a beginning and he never had an ending but he crafted the beginning and the ending So within the context he has preeminence he is omniscient and omnipresent brother brandham said you can't be omnipresent without being omniscient so the very fact that he is omnipresent is because he knew all things that's what forn knowledge is he and that's why How Free Will and forn knowledge work together a lot of people get confused about that God just knew what decision you would make he's orchestrated all things to the working of his good pleasure that he gives you the Free Will in the moment to make the decision amen what an amazing thing amen now here's the other thing that I want you to understand at the same time Satan was created and placed within the same construct that you and I are in amen Satan is a is's a created being right he he had a beginning therefore he has an ending he in in even in Genesis chapter 2 thus the heavens and the Earth were finished and the host of them brother brandham says in 1962 and why I'm against organized religion he says this and there's no scripture that says there's an eternal hell because Eternal never did begin and neither does it never end so the Bible hell was created for the devil and his angels so it is an etal Eternal there was a time when it wasn't and there'll be a time when it's not again they may be punished in there through fire and Brinston and pits and fire and eons of time but it finally will end because hell is not Eternal and if there was an eternal hell you'd have eternal life and to live in eternal hell and and if if it was eternal it always was and you you always was in Hell you'll always be in Hell see so there's no such a thing he says so you see eternal is never had a beginning never had an ending there's only one form of eternal life and that is God and it comes from the Greek word Zoey which means God's own life and when we Are Born Again by the spirit of God we become Eternal with God because we have part of his life which makes us Sons and Daughters to God Satan exists within the same context that you do now there's a faster Dimension right hell is just a a different dimension there's it's relative to where you are and the dimension that you have there's there's a three brother random explained the Realms that exist and you exist within the the Earth realm and Satan exists in a different realm so he's traveling with a different perception of time it's relative to where he is where he is but you are in this context and he is in that context but he's restrained by the same construct that you are that a flesh born person is is and within that construct brother bam said that Satan absolutely does have power but he only has power within that construct because his only Power is death so his only Power is with death that means that he's confined to the same constraint that a flesh born person is confined by that's why in the Millennium he he was he was bound and it was a chain of circumstance there's literally nothing for him to do it it there there is a a a confine that he is under and it's the same that we're under as individuals as as flesh born individuals in all of this world this is Satan zeden and he's confined to that construct of time he had a beginning he will have an end now God exists apart from that context but Satan is bound by that that's why God created time is because it has a beginning and it has an end but he is eternal so at some point Satan exists within that construct of time but he absolutely has an ending because he had a beginning so Satan is only confined Satan is confined by time and One Sweet Day time will come to an end so I ask you what have we to fear what have we to trust I'm leaning on the Everlasting Arms do you understand how small Satan is he's confined to time and one day time is going to be over but the beautiful thing about it is is that those who are in Christ Jesus have the very Life of Christ in them and if you are in Christ then you were in him in the beginning you are a thought at the beginning a thought is a um a word is a thought expressed you've heard this before you know where I'm going a thought a word is a thought expressed so if you are in the mind of God then that means that you are the word made manifest you're the very life of God that's the very life of God in you because it's the same Word Flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone so Paul comes along and said I was crucified with Christ nevertheless I live I Christ lives through me and we look at all these different things um even in in the uh uh in John in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us Galatians 2:20 I have been crucified with Christ John 5:25 verely verely I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death the only the only Power that Satan has unto life so you've been passed from Death unto life and then he says in 1 John chapter 5 he says and this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son amen God gave to you eternal life and do you understand that eternity exists outside of the constraint of time amen amen so do you understand that your adversary has an end but you do not your adversary's time is allotted to him amen he exists within that constraint but you as a born again Holy Ghost filled believer do not you exist outside of that confine although the only context that we have is within it but thanks be to God he hath opened our eyes to be able to see what God has done in this last day and what he's done is he's given his very life Zoe to you and you are a part of him flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone meaning that you have eternal life in you right now it's deity in flesh so you exists outside of that context even though you are constrained by it amen what an amazing thing so I can't stop the aging process there's a lot of chemicals there's a lot of things that says you can but they won't stop it time is irreversible and it is irrevocable it is Relentless it goes your children will grow up amen they will leave the home eventually some will some may not you will get old rest assured that you will change you can't stop it it's Relentless change happens progress happens there's nothing you can do about that because you're confined to that restraint but praise be to God that's not the end of my story that's not the end of your story we exist without that constraint in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and it took a message of the hour to reveal that to you to say I'm am heavenbound I'm not confined by this world or the Enemy Within it I live outside of this constraint so therefore when you talk about overcoming you talk about um uh uh healing when you talk about resisting the devil and he will flee think about it within that context of the devil only has so much time he only has so much time and I believe that it's very near to the point where we're going to leave this world and at that point will just go faster and our perception of reality will be totally different because it's relative to time and Satan's perception is different so he doesn't know he he can't stop it because he's constrained by it a construct directly crafted by God to to allow his end amen he lifted you outside of that constraint and he left Satan within it because it had a beginning and it has an end and he is the Alpha and the Omega isn't that mindblowing and you think about that do you understand how small Satan is and we think about it in terms of you know um brother Steve you don't know what I'm dealing with I I don't and I I I even think of this um you think about anxiety you think about depression you think about that's just rampant uh uh nowadays y um suicide those those spirits and those things uh depression is absolutely a spirit yes um you can be depressed it's absolutely a spirit anxiety is absolutely a a spirit and I I believe that when we when you look at it with this perspective you can say with confidence Satan get thee behind me you shall not Prevail that's right when you look at it with a perception of I I not confined by the same constraints that you are there's a greater power that's within me it's greater than in within me than he that's within the world then your decision making changes when I became a uh when I was filled with the Holy Spirit everything changed I think differently you look at the world differently you think of time differently you you everything changes because behold all things that are in Christ are made new and so my decision making uh it it just changed when you're filled with the baptism of the holy spirit amen but I want you to understand when you look at at life and you look at the circumstances and you look at the moment that God has given you when you look at it with the perception of I have all eternity behind me all eternity is is here with me it's it's Christ in you the hope of glory a great mystery that would be revealed to to the to the Gentiles to you amen so it's Christ in me the hope of Glory that means if you bring it down into every moment and you look at it as Paul encourages you to do as an opportunity then within that opportunity within that moment you can confidently say Satan get the behind me and if you can't confidently do that then you can confidently boldly run to the throne of grace yes amen you can absolutely receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit as I'm speaking to you you can have it right now you don't have to wait because you have time you have a moment that is specifically crafted by God you don't have the future because it is not here yet the past is the past you have right now but you're not guaranteed tomorrow you don't know when he will the day or the hour when we when he comes we know the season that he will come and it is now yeah so if you are if you doubt whether or not you have the Holy Ghost you can receive it right now at this moment in time because God crafted this moment in time and gave it to you he didn't give it to someone in the past he gave it to you every single one of you this evening he gives you this moment and you can decide what you do with it so why would you wait what what does hinder thee run to it I say I say seize the moment time is a gift of God and it's given to you so make the right decision progress well change well don't lose the opportunity make the decision you don't have to wait till a Saturday night service to have a a prayer line experience you can have it right now it's not about you waiting until Sunday or waiting till the opportune moment it's not guaranteed you've got right now make the decision praise God Amen God left Satan within the constraints of time I I believe in in large part he crafted time so that Satan would have an end so that you would have the confidence he will not he will not overcome me he has a he has an expected end we have an expected end he has an expected end and our expected end is a beginning our expected end is is that he would come and he would change us and that he would mold us and craft us and and shape us into the likeness of Jesus Christ he would do that continually and over and over every moment and every moment if the Lord should carry you change and you grow and you mature in the Lord Jesus Christ and brother Brandon would say it was the old lady who said I'm not thank God I'm not what I used to be I'm not what I I'm not what I ought to be I'm not what I want to be but thank God I'm not what I used to be he who began a good work in you will finish it so if you've made your decision and you're sitting here tonight maybe you've been filled with the Holy Spirit for 30 years and you're sitting here tonight and you're saying I just I feel so empty or I I don't know what it is or maybe you're struggling with anxiety maybe you're struggling with with depression a great deal of us are right Satan might tries to make you feel like you're isolated and you're the only one dealing with it everyone's got anxiety to whatever degree it varies you may be dealing with it to the point where um uh medicine may be needed the Lord allows that all these different things but you you may be at a point in your life you're saying I I don't know what to do brother Steve you've got this moment and you've got all eternity right here with us this evening we believe that or we don't you've got all eternity right here because he said I'll be with you where two or three are gathered in my name I believe he's here that means he's right here in this room and he's given us this moment to respond to him he created time a construct the only context that we have to relate to the world around us I know that Sunday was and I know that Sunday is coming so we're constrained by it to a large degree but in the same right the Holy Spirit and by his grace lifts us outside of that constraint although we're we're EarthBound but One Sweet Day will be changed and our perception of time will change because it'll be relative to something else and then we'll be changed in a moment of a twinkling of an eye and then we'll move into this whole new new phase of of existence that's apart from the constraint of time but thanks be to God that Satan will be left within it I want you to understand how small Satan is I want you to understand how important every single moment is God's given you this time you know he's given you every single moment with your children he's given you every single moment with your spouse and those are important those are not to be said well you know I don't have time with this or I don't want to deal with this or you know um this is of no importance God's given you every single moment with your family with your friends with your work co-workers all the things that you do in your career the Lord is extremely invested in what you do with your with your work you ever thought about that sometimes the scripture says whatever your hand finds to do do it with all thy might as unto the Lord so the Lord wants to be involved in that so that you would do well so that you would Prosper this is not Prosperity Gospel it's just the reality of the grace and mercy of almighty God he wants to be there in every single moment that you have amen so here's the thing in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 he said he hath made everything beautiful in his time and also he hath set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end he's he's planted eternity he's made everything beautiful in his time he's given a sense of Divine Purpose in your heart he's allowed you to understand there's something greater than just this amen he he's divinely given you that understanding that's a gift of the Holy Spirit you think outside of that that context you're think you're looking at by the grace of of almighty God in the message of the hour you can see the the the the how everything plays out how how um uh the Rapture happens God turns to the Jews uh we go to the wedding supper we go into a millennial Reign all these different things you can look at all these different things from the beginning to the end with that perception and with that understanding by the grace of God that's why zerubabel the only thing he could say when the pyramid uh came down when the cap came down on top of the pyramid the only thing that he could say to it was Grace Grace unto it that's why brother random said Shalom to the bride peace be unto you because you've got this understanding and this awareness of where you stand he's placed that Divine Purpose in you and then Paul comes right along in Ephesians chapter 5 and he says in four verse 14 wherefore saith he awake thou that sleepest don't waste the moments awake thou that sleepest and he says and Christ shall give thee light arise from the dead see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise you know what that means it's as you walk a tight RPP somebody walks a tight rope they have to walk it very circumspectly very carefully because if you say hey Bob yes naturally he's going to fall off the tight rope so the idea and this what it says in scripture is very very clear walk carefully you know how you do that you do that moment by moment worry and anxiety is something that may or may not happen depression is worrying about something in the past right depression is is is um is is down because of something that has happened or something that that occurred anxiety is worry or or or or anxiety and worry is is something that hasn't even happened it's imagination so that's an Avenue of Satan to play with your imagination right because that's an Avenue of the spirit realm so naturally he's going to get in your head and begin to make you think all of these different things and imagine all these different things that's how anxiety works now it is an evil spirit but it works and plays at your mind about something that may or may not have happened tomorrow my business is going to go kaput I think there's going to be people who are going to need your services tomorrow so if one customer calls today and says I I don't want you to ever come back then there's probably going to be somebody else who needs that the next day but anxiety and worry a very tool of the devil to get you to bring that moment and totally shapes and perverts the moment that God gave you Satan is a perverter So within the constraint of time his power is perversion that's what death is is a per perversion of Life brother brandom taught all about this so he says it's a perversion of life so Satan's only power is to pervert that which God intended for his glory so anxiety and worry is is is imagining something that may or may not happen and existing in in something that you don't even have which is the future so why would you want to exist in in in in something that may or may not have happened and I realize that some people can be very sick you can be to the point where you're debilitated uh uh laying on on a on a on a couch without any hope uh for for the future depressed and anxious and that's the enemy perverting a moment in time for you but God does not intend for that perversion to last that's why he says be of good cheer because in me I I have overcome the world so be of good cheer in the world naturally you're going to have tribulation the customers are going to call and they will not like you but be of good cheer because I've overcome the world in me you have peace he's given you that moment and you have the ability the choice the choice to to to allow the Holy Spirit to take over that moment amen that's why he says I I I have hid Thy word in my heart that I might not sit against thee all these scriptures come into light I I will I uh he he will keep in perfect peace who my mind is stayed on theee that's not psychology that's just scripture he whose mind who has stayed on thee Satan wants to play with that and pervert every single moment that God has given you he'll put fear into your mind right now you say brother Steve I want to respond to the Holy Spirit whatever that may look like for you right amen I don't know you may you may run around you may just sit at your seat I don't know it may look very different for each one of you but he may put fear in your mind and say I don't want to respond that's Satan perverting a moment that the holy spirit is trying to deal with you don't let Satan you have the you have the confidence with the understanding that you have to say Satan get thee behind me you shall not Prevail I want to stop right there I want to stop right there I think about um just driving down the road and sister s and I were driving and um listening to some music and I was just thinking about all of the events that have led me to this point in time and you may think that you don't amount I don't I don't know I just feel this on my heart you may think that you don't amount to anything you may think that you don't have a lot of value you think well brother Steve I'm just you know I just I don't feel like I'm contributing anything I don't feel like I'm of any value I you know I'm dealing with this or I've got this problem and this problem you think about all the events that have happened to lead you to this moment amen and there is one thing for for sure he who has begun a good work in you will finish it until the very end so if he brought you this far he'll bring you the rest of the way you have enough confidence in him to believe that if he brought you this far he'll bring you the rest of the way you're tired tonight you don't feel well that's fine you'll feel better you'll feel better One Sweet Day you'll feel very good but you'll probably feel better in the next couple days and you can you can let Satan get you down which is what has nothing better to do what else is he going to do so naturally he's going to try to pull you down and pervert the moment which is right now so I encourage you and I I I implore you as Paul said redeem the time knowing what we know knowing where we are going having the message of the hour firmly in our grasp and understanding what we we understand I'm not saying you have to understand all the Mysteries but the knowledge that you do have the spirit of wisdom and of revelation will work according to it and he will work and perform to his good pleasure in your life so if he brought you this far he will bring you the rest of the way do you have confidence in that would you bow your heads with me musicians won't you come I just want to pray with you Heavenly Father Lord I Thank you for this moment I thank you for this Moment In Time Lord um I I I it's a natural tendency for individuals to think about the past and Lord that's something memory is something that is with us it's it's a it's an actual it's an actuality it's it's not something that we can um do without memory is there but Lord I I pray that within this moment we could forget those things which are behind us and press towards the mark of the High Calling of Christ I don't believe that it's going to be very long before we come home I I I just I don't want it to be Lord I want to be home my my my goal my my objective my vision is to walk through the Gates of Glory is for a body change is Lord for my perception of of time and space to change to go fast as the prophet said it's speed Lord One Sweet Day I'll change but until then may I press on well may I change well may I may I make that decision Lord not to not to wait or or or to to push you aside and allow Satan to pervert every moment that you have given to me Lord may I just open my heart and my mind in subjection to the word of God and say Lord have thine own way Lord I just want to I just want to make the decision in this hour Lord that would be pleasing to you Lord may I come boldly before the throne of grace Lord I I pray that you'd search every heart every mind Lord many are the afflictions of the righteous and our righteousness is not in ourselves it is in you Lord I pray that you'd lift our countenances lift lift our understanding set our affections on those things which are above Lord may we just all together in this room whoever is listening Lord may we together allow our affections to be re uh to Rise Above This World and the things that are constrained by time to to you which are not Lord I pray that you would allow us to have victory in the present moment amen Lord give us the courage to reach out and say Lord here am I send me Lord give us the courage to run boldly to the throne of grace let this moment not pass anyone [Music] by Lord I pray that you just deal with each heart we thank you for this moment song Oh I surer all let's just stand and sing this together I Surrender [Music] to be my blessed savior surrend sing it now I [Music] Surrender Just In This Moment now surrender all [Music] all to the [Music] my surrender sing it now oh All to Jesus I surrender to sing that with your heart now really if you're going to sing it I will ever love and Trust in his [Music] presence sing it now oh I surrender [Music] all I surrender all all all to thee my bless savior I [Music] Surrender just keep playing that for me softly brother Andrew just quietly my goodness prise God told you we're going to go into the word didn't I you feel benefited tonight my I I was that's some of the fastest notes I've ever written in my life the brother came out I was thinking about the Roman Candle brother brand said it just blows out five stars and those five blow out five and I had so many candles bursting around me oh wow do I feel so benefited in the word tonight did you ever imagine that the present is so vital and so critical you see why the devil is always trying to distract you yes that's really his only tool is is is distraction and try to get you pulled off of God's program my goodness I love that brother Stephen I I think more about Redeeming the time I I really realize tonight [Music] that no wonder brother brandom said to make you an overcomer that's not him just pushing you through pipe you know putting you in a mold and then opening up and saying oh what a great Overcomer he said no this is something you got to do you learn tonight that you have control you have more control than the devil wants to make wants to ever let you believe I I love the fact that Satan is bound by time which means he will end but I will not oh I'm an eternal being having a Time experience when when when it runs out I will be but he will not have not I told you all this time he ain't nobody come on he ain't nobody he's a he's a creature trapped in time I really his only purpose here he's a he he's he's ordained of God to drive me to to Perfection wow to drive me could I say it like this to drive us back to Perfection I started in God I'm going back to God yes oh my goodness my goodness you know something [Music] friends I was thinking about this you know brother brandham talked about Abraham and how that Abraham was a Sojourner and he was looking for something now we're getting ready to go to prayer I'm not going to bring you all up tonight because we've had so much sickness we're going to stay right where we are and I'll take a look and see if I have any prayer requests I didn't see any uh but I might have some I haven't noticed yet but we'll pray in a minute but before we [Music] do Abraham was looking for a real tangible City and brother brandham said he knew it was somewhere cuz he had already met its king he had met its king the king of Salem amen and so he knew that was an eternal being that I met so there must be an eternal City and brother brandham said he went everywhere looking for it and brother brandham said right where he built his altar he said that City he was looking for that real one not not a metaphor a real City he said it was just above him it was just above him so you know you need healing tonight well guess what I got a body that's just above me that's that's a per that that if if this Tabernacle be dissolved I have one already waiting and that's why brother brandham said Divine Healing is just a little deposit little Earnest of the Resurrection see no wonder that the Bible says all the good things come down from Above So you need healing in your body tonight just know this that it's just you can say Lord send down a little deposit of my resurrection power i' I need it now I know I'm going to get it someday and it's going to change me but I need a little bit of it tonight you need a little piece that passes understanding it's just above you to say Lord let it come down on me tonight oh friends don't don't lose sight of what of what you have access to by prayer and by faith that you believe that God is and that all good things come down from him say Lord let it come down on on me tonight could you have it that way could you imagine that's why that to keep you from getting peace you got a whole treasury of it up there to keep of instead of you operating on what you heard tonight he fills up th tonight you got your brain filled with the word of God but normally what say does is to try to keep you from coming to get to have that and he fills up your mind with news and entertainment and and and every kind of no wonder the world is under anxiety and stress and depression friends I'm going to here to tell you you don't have to have that you don't have to have that you don't have to put up with sickness you don't have to put up with anxiety it's a plague brother Ram called it a plague that's an actually a prophetic term he said it's a plague it's on the whole age I'm so glad tonight I can just reach up and know that there's a a father just above me and I've got a a a a perfect world already waiting and when this one is done I can go back there but the beauty of it is is I have access to everything I have need of now do you want to believe it that way tonight do you want to do you want to just really let your mind grasp what you heard tonight and and say Lord my goodness I have right now this is the most valuable moment in my life right now cuz the past is the past and tomorrow is not even guaranteed right now today is the day of salvation you need the Holy Ghost you need more of the Holy Ghost it it can be brought down to you you need healing it can be brought down to you you need peace you know you got some kind of a need let it be brought down to you tonight take take possession of it thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee yeah that's

just pray for the whole church I want to see some of it look like they might Escape it and now are starting to Fever up and different things like that but I know the Lord has it all and his perfect control you know I you should never doubt it again the devil ain't nobody amen amen he is he's trapped here I'm not he has power but I have power over his power it's what Jesus said I've given you power over all the power of the enemy amen so it's ours tonight friends for the taking amen join with that person near you let's go to the Lord in prayer father tonight we have one request that comes
