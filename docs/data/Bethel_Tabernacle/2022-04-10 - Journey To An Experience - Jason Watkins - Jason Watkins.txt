i'll cast my spell on amen praise the lord amen so we're looking forward to what god is doing and appreciate all of the updates that have been coming through and the different things that you've been being made aware of and just to just we want to keep that before you constantly what the lord is doing amen and so i'm happy today to be here it's a beautiful day and man i thought oh man winter was going to make one last stab at it yesterday i walked outside and i saw my goodness you know we we do have um people say do you have any winter there at all say we do but it's usually gone by noon and so so so we uh we were caught off guard a little bit yesterday but i'm happy for the sunshine today the beautiful weather we've got a number of families traveling today and one or two prayer requests regarding that i'll get to those just in a few minutes but i just want to be praying for a number of families away traveling some a couple on vacation and one had to go to a family funeral and then brother jd is preaching up in where i just was up at brother paul lafontaine's and so we want to be praying the lord would amen you got her amen praise the lord that the lord would bless brother jason demars mightily amen i i so enjoyed myself at those services i've had a tremendously busy year this year almost felt like but joseph felt like the old days back when i was evangelizing my goodness i've been going like crazy amen but i've been home just enough to prevent a native uprising so amen so i don't want to have riots here so hey man besides you don't have to worry this is my favorite pulpit to preach in the planet earth and that's always true and whenever i'm away i want to be back amen so you just you just bear that in mind we've still got some services we're going to be ministering later on we're going to be out with brother dale uh in his dedication meetings in may and then i've got a couple other requests that i'm praying about so amen but amen we got a full team here of ministry my wonderful god has gifted us and uh we had uh actually brother caleb was in the saddle for wednesday and we had to pull the plug and we didn't get a whole lot as usual i learned what me and brother eddie used to learn uh me and jonathan when we were painting that around here you don't you hear this terrible forecast you don't pay much attention to it because a lot of times it doesn't pan out at all but i apologize you know that we we have no choice when you know we get such a dire warning and they were saying you know hail and tornadoes and flooding and there's no way the stakes are too high can't risk the lives of people driving and so we had to cancel our wednesday night and i think we probably could have had it but we couldn't take that chance i just wanted to make that clear amen sister dab bring them in bring them in amen oh bring them in oh bring them in speed it up oh bring them in of sin oh bring them in bring them in bring [Music] check them out get to

got her amen praise the lord amen got her bradley hey look over there pat paul you hear that laugh you're going to hear that a lot oh let's pray father wow lord how we love you for this little precious bundle this gift of god it's the heritage of the lord may you constantly remind us of that children are the heritage of the lord they belong to you lord they're on loan to us and we're given a commission and a charge to raise them in the admonition of god lord to raise them in the way that they should go and when they're older it won't depart we have tremendous faith in that lord we look to you we can't save them we know that try as we might there's no greater love lord that uh than a parent for their child but love is great as that it it still it falls short of being able to give eternal life to their offspring we must look to you for that lord we commit her into your hands our little sister lana grace campbell lord watch over her life keep her in strength and help may she be a blessing in the home a blessing in this assembly we dedicate her to you lord we give her back to you who gave her to us now father we committed to you that your hand to be upon her always in jesus christ's name amen see not one whimper amen god bless you sister joy amen brother caleb god bless you amen praise the lord give him a hand this morning [Applause] amen let's stand back to our feet and we want to go to prayer before we um read our actually before i read the text because it's a lengthy reading and we'll read and then let you be seated but um give us a court of only believe sister debra amen um sister elizabeth johnson was actually sister from over near atlanta away she's in a car accident yesterday uh she's mostly okay but it's banged up from i understand she was struck from behind and so we wanted to pray and ask the lord for mercy for our sister and brother george and sister andrea as i mentioned their their brother-in-law sister andrea's sister's husband passed away they found him deceased i think on saturday friday or saturday and so they immediately went up for the funeral and just just praying the grace of god flow through them to that family want to be remembering that whole family brother mark also asked for prayer this morning i said i have a prayer request this morning i've hurt my back and sitting and standing both are painful the only relief i get is when i lay flat and even that is temporary amen a lot of working men can relate to that i know i can and so uh he also is requesting continue prayer for his um i'm getting a notice from a streamer there's no volume coming through on the stream so someone can see to that amen brother rodney is saying they're not getting much volume amen um brother mark has requested prayer for his brother josh after running tests they found out that he has congestive heart failure there's fluid on his heart and they have to go in and drain it because his heart isn't pumping the way it should they said there is really nothing that can be done amen for that but we know something we know someone a man who can take that case and amen and turn it around um got to request from sister phyllis concerning her daughter anna who we all know and love and she was admitted into the hospital with kidney stones they they put a stint and then in and center back home temporarily till they can get her back this week for laser surgery to try to reduce the size of the stones she's in a tremendous amount of pain and nausea so we're praying for a good outcome on all of that brother donnie wrote to me this morning and asked special prayer for his daughter erica she um she starts another treatment her chemotherapy tomorrow you remember we were praying and and the lord she became cancer free and we had great victory uh but the devil just doesn't go away easily and he's tried to make a re-emergence and so she's had to go back in for some treatment and you know friends i'd i just say you know in my heart i don't know maybe it seems like the lord's given me a special burden for it and uh i i i just want to say that we should just all agree this shall not stand amen and i believe that we should speak against it i believe friends that there's power and prayer i believe when the saints of god bind together and it's not just something passive i think that you got a need today i don't know what it might be you might have a need not on my list today speak against that thing speak against the devil speak it out into the atmosphere that's what jesus did he actually spoke out and it went into the spirit world and he called a young girl's life back to her and and and i i believe that there's there's power when we are claiming the promise of god whatever you do don't take the devil's attack sitting down amen whatever you do claim brother branham said take your token and and bring it it's a it's a badge of authority to say back off satan amen i think it should be a claim in our homes and our churches and our families i think we ought to speak freedom and speak deliverance and speak every need that we have amen and claim it in the name of the lord jesus christ it's not it's not charismatic name it claim it it's taking the promise of god brother branham said if you take any promise of god and put it on your lips and say it brother branham said that's the same as deity speaking now how many want to make a claim amen let's pray father in the name of the lord jesus we're bringing these needs before you today and we're believing lord for our sister elizabeth that you'll recover her quickly we're believing lord that brother george and sister andrea will have a a a a a wonderful outcome father they'll be able to go and spread the love and the grace of god to a hurting family lord i pray father that you will meet the need for our dear brother mark lord and his brother josh lord and we we still stand firm without backing up one inch lord that the prayer we've been praying for brother joe i will not back away from that we are claiming complete victory lord we speak it out into the atmosphere in the name of jesus christ may these brothers be made completely whole for your glory lord for our own sister anna who we love lord to this day father and we're asking your mercy for her life oh god use this in a way to demonstrate your love to her lord father we're praying father for sister erica and there's brother donning sister carol lord oh father what a what a pressure must be upon their hearts if i think if it was my own child lord we're claiming in the name of the lord jesus christ that our sister should be made free of this once and for all lord we condemn the work of the enemy he is our enemy and he is your enemy and we claim victory in all of these needs today lord and we commit it to you now in the name of jesus christ our lord and the whole church said amen praise the name of the lord god bless you we're going to invite you amen just now um we're going to go to in our scriptures to galatians chapter 4 and we're going to read a couple of the in beginning verses from verse 1 and we will then let you be seated and we will carry on uh reading amen praise the lord now from galatians chapter 4 we begin with verse 1. now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but as under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ may the lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated and we'll carry on reading from verse 8. verse 8 how be it then when you knew not god you did service unto them which by nature are no gods but now after that ye have known god or rather are known of god how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements wherein to you desire again to be in bondage ye observe days and months and times and years i'm afraid of you lest i have bestowed upon you labor in vain brethren i beseech you be as i am for i am as ye are ye have not injured me at all you know how through infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospel unto you at the first and my temptation which was in my flesh he despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of god even as christ jesus where is then the blessedness you speak of for i bear you record that if it had been possible you would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me am i therefore become your enemy because i tell you the truth they zealously affect you but not well yea they would exclude you that you might affect them but it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing and not only when i am present with you now watch verse 19 and 20 my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you i desire to be present with you now and to change my voice for i stand in doubt of you tell me ye that desire to be under the law do you not hear the law for it is written that adam had two sons the one by a bondwoman and the other by a free woman but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he of the free woman was by promise which things are an allegory see it's a it's a bible imagery it's a type for these are the two covenants the one from mount sinai which gendereth to bondage which is hagar for this hagar in mount sinai in arabia and answereth to jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children but jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all amen may the lord bless that reading you know it's interesting that paul would have to come to this argument with the church there of the galatians because paul had established them clearly apart from the law he had established them on the grace of god and what god had done for all humanity in his death burial and resurrection at calvary that day on calvary set us free from the bondage of the law and we find that a lot of times human beings tend to for a number of reasons but the outcome's never good you know either they either they they don't want to press through to what it it requires to really feel the freedom in the holy spirit or you know they have some complex that was sown in their life and they have a hard time getting over it and they they seem to where they they only find their worth uh in some kind of keeping of a legal code and some kind of legalistic approach and i can i can tell you that that paul said you know if you're going to take that path then for you at least calvary was in vain and christ died in vain because you're not even reaping the benefit now he didn't die in vain because there are some people who have believed the report and it is to those people who have believed the report that the arm of the lord is revealed and brother branham picks that up in the sixth seal about how that that that the that when the word is revealed and when you believe that word then the arm of the lord is revealed to you and if you if you just think that through you realize that a couple of things number one that god has been active in your life because you couldn't come to that revelation on your own god had to bring you to that revelation everything that you will ever have with eternal value is the grace of almighty god and god so loving the world that he would actually go to unimaginable links to save mankind god loves life and so we we find then that additionally if you think about how that the arm of the lord is revealed to you that god that that that now you have a responsibility because the arm of the lord came to you he god helped you he has revealed life to you you couldn't save yourself and so the only one who could save you saw your need looked beyond your fault saw your need looked beyond your mistakes sawned a seed and said i this is my child and regardless of what they've come through they're failures it doesn't matter i'm not going to lose them we rejoice in that today but now there's also the aspect if you if you continue to think it through and brother branham didn't go this direction in the sixth seal but in other places where he makes this case that you know we at the end at the end of an arm an arm is attached to a body and the end of an arm is a hand and it is the hand that performs the will through the arm comes from the mind and brother brandon would would say to us many times god has no hands but yours amen so when the arm of the lord is revealed to you you become the hand of god to the world you become those who you become one who brings mercy and says here i have mercy for you will you accept it and if they do you have you have been a a partaker you have been a participant in their eternal life you'll even have a a crown and you're a jewel in your crown for every time you've accomplished that people lose sight of that sometimes sometimes people keep it fixed firmly in their mind they're constantly witnessing you know i think about the the the chronicles of my dad and mom in their in their young years of witnessing the message and uh you know brother eddie and sister gene stand and and are responsible for entire churches coming into the message entire assemblies now just think exponentially how many of those went out and won somebody and preached the gospel i'm here to tell you there's going to be a lot of jewels in the crown of brother eddie and sister gene sister gene stills does it to this day i caught her the other day uh here she is you know i always get this wrong mom are you 81 81 years old and i called her up and i said hey what you doing she said oh i'm i'm i'm showing the films to my neighbors and i said wait wait what what films what said the film's deep called deep 20th century private i said who are you showing to she said my neighbors heard her and her son come down my mom sit in her living room with a church service showing the films and at 81 years old she's still finding somebody she's still trying to add gems and jewels to her crown i think that should be the vision of all of us see and so it was it was that gift as brother branham said to tim as brothers brother paul said to timothy it came through his mother lois and before that his grandmother eunice and and and we find that that ministering gift came upon me and i stand here in a pulpit today this is god's doing this is the hand of the lord and you know whenever we see god moving in our lives like this we ought to take notice and there ought to be some gratitude think of where you would be if you weren't here while i was talking to myself and and i was on the phone just the other day and brother chad lam and i we were just rejoicing over the grace of god and i saw i said my goodness brother chad well i've thought so many times what would what would i do if i didn't have this message what would i what would i tell my family how would i how would i have given hope to my children what would i say to my church i'd have no way to give them the assurance but but here's the reality i am a believer and a message did come and i did believe it and i do preach it and you have received it so let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come and the bride has made herself ready brother branham says in in the message who is this melchizedek and i i deliberated with myself this morning whether to put these on powerpoints but i didn't have enough and i just want to read a couple of quotes to you and uh one is lengthy but i'll just make actually just referring to it because it's familiar but brother branham says here and who is this melchizedek he says when abraham met him he was melchizedek and this tremendous statement that the prophet makes he unfolds here now this is in the bible imagery of melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end every son of abraham every son of of of the faith will absolutely do the same thing but i want you to watch how we have to come brother anthony can i get a water please yeah uh how how that we have to i want you to watch how we have to come so brother branham goes on from there i'm not preaching on it today uh but but but what i am taking a title is journey to an experience because that's really what your life has been about in fact is you know israel israel had such such epic failures and god comes to them after many years and they've wandered in the desert and 40 years they went around the mountain around and around and around again and they took 40 years on a journey that should have taken less than a week and and they were still found and until finally god comes on the scene and finally says all right we're we're just moving on and and god took them across the jordan under joshua and you all know the story since your days of childhood in sunday school but but the point comes to where god comes to them and he's kind of going to give uh almost a a summation you know here's what's been happening i kind of want to bring you up to speed that you know you you see it as oh there was a great episode in egypt and you remember those stories well and the darkness and the flies and the frogs and the fleas thank you sir the frogs and the fleas and and you remember pharaoh's resistance and you remember the death of all the firstborn and and then how we came out with the mighty hand and here we've been and you remember the waters of marabou you remember the smiting of the rock you remember the fire that bur the mountain that burned with fire you remember the tablets of stone and and and you're you're you're seeing all of this as history and this was our lives and this this was our uh these were our trials and these were our testings and we had successes and failures and a lot more failures than we wanted to talk about and god just comes down and he sums it up and he said i sent you on a journey that's really all that was happening and you know you never really caught that you just you you lived as if i was making it up on the fly you you had your problems and you cried out and you murmured and you complained you you were unaware that you were just on a journey you were just on a journey i was i was leading you somewhere for your good and everything was was to take it in that direction and and and you really you missed out on so much and people today miss out on just that simple concept say oh i'm i'm here i was born i had a life i've got past i've got memories i've had this i had a job had a career i had a person in my life i had this i had that or you've spent a tremendous amount of your time saying i got to get a job or i got to get a person or i got to have this i got to have that you're just on a journey you're just it's this is just a little whistle stop as i've said before you're just passing through as i as i made the comment to you last sunday i said yeah we have trials but you you'd face your trials with a lot more endurance if you would just change the word trial to training because that's really what it is that's exactly what it is you say well but i you know i i did something wrong and i reaped what i sowed and it was a terrible consequence and so god being god uses that for a teachable moment just like a parent would we have what we call teachable moments i used to invent them if i if my boys were too good and they were never in trouble i would just say man something's wrong with this picture i'm going to have to create a scenario and create me a teachable moment now i wasn't planning to drop the lower the boom on them i just wanted some more training and so i'd create a scenario and almost almost impossible for them to to pass and and in their failure then i could come sweeping in like the hero and fix it and do it for them and say now boys sit down let me show you why this happened because i i you hear my son's laughing and they're they're saying it didn't wasn't actually that good the way you're telling it amen don't ask them they don't know anything and so so but i but you know i i saw that as a responsibility i was a proactive parent i i saw that i have a responsibility there's more to being a parent than just keeping them safe and fed and warm and protected i'm growing them to something i'm trying to i'm trying to produce something i have a commission that that they're the heritage of god and i'm i'm here trying to mold them and i and i would say you know when when sometimes there'd be resistance i'd say listen son you you've got to realize dad is not the obstacle of your manhood don't i'm not ever going to let satan i would say to parents everywhere don't let satan paint you that way that you're the obstacle to their manhood i became their advocate i said i want you to move into manhood you need to move into manhood but but with that comes responsibility it's not life's not fair and it's certainly not free and you you need there's things that you can do on your way to becoming a better man and i would say someday i got a like a little boat i got to take you and set you on the sea of life and give you a little shove and i gotta have you ready so you know give me some grace here i gotta have you ready i'm not doing these things because i'm i'm it's not punishment because i'm some evil person i it's punishment because it's it's it's a corrective measure because i i see what this will come to down the road if i don't fix it now and in spite of best efforts you still being a human still mess up st i didn't always get it right and there were times when i had to sit down and sit down to a young man and here i am the older adult and have to look him in the eye and go dad was wrong and i'm sorry see but but you know that then that genders respect that that causes that you always want to have it to where you're you're trying to create a desire in that child you don't want to force them god doesn't want to force you god wants you to love him and be and he wants you to feel his love amen my and so so so this whole idea that paul is bringing to to the church in galatia at galatia he's saying listen i i like like my children i'm laboring till i see christ formed in you this is my whole desire say brother jason why why do you keep keep this up why are you pressing you know for this with with such an urgency and i and i've been speaking on it a lot you know this whole year we started with a lengthy series and you know what is the church of god and i've got a lot of feedback from that series it was lengthy and and then we we went there to approaching perfection and then i had a whole bunch of stuff in between scattered throughout and and why do i have such an urgency and all i can tell you is it's the same spirit on me that was on saint paul when he said my little children because that's what i feel like i when i look out mr debbie and i feel that way it might seem upside down to you but that's how we feel it's like you're our children like you're our family and some of you are senior to me but paul said my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you hallelujah a perfect example of growth after the new birth after the holy ghost you're going to grow in the grace of god amen god has a throne that the bible teaches us is established in mercy and that can never change this throne that is established in mercy means that he does everything he can and works tirelessly morning noon and night to keep you from going to hell god doesn't take pleasure in death not even of a sinner the bible teaches us that he doesn't take pleasure even in the death of a sinner he sets barricades in your path to keep you from going there hell wasn't even built for humans it's an overcrowded prison because it wasn't built for humans it was built for the devil and his angels and mankind was never supposed to go there now the cruelty of sin and and the choice that mankind made in genesis and don't now don't get uppity and blame adam and eve because the world today is still making the same choice and i just say well look when when god was in control of everything it was a perfect world are you ready to give him control again of your whole life well no okay okay then if you're not don't blame adam and eve because you're still making the same choice it's before us all we have to make that choice we are born in sin and you know and and so god sets barricades and brother branham says if you go to hell you'll send yourself there because god will try every way he can to block you off from it and you just keep stepping over the barricades and so therefore brother branham would correlate uh we we a lot of times we talk about blasphemy of the holy ghost and i i just want to say uh a little bit about it i've i've hit at it in bits and pieces in in the last couple sermons but i really want to conclusively walk you through this today and i've spent a lot of time thinking about this and brother branham would correlate blasphemy of the holy ghost and a lot of times you'll hear him describe it as crossing the line between judgment and mercy from which there's no coming back because as paul taught the church in hebrews and romans and different places that that once you cross that line there's no more sacrifice for your sin and the only way you could ever be saved is if jesus came back and did it all over again and he's not going to do that see so so it leaves you in the wind and and and and so when we talk about crossing the line of judgment and mercy and brother branham said when you do that you blaspheme the holy ghost or will you cross the line between judgment and mercy you actually will never desire god again which is helpful if you're sitting here today and you still got a desire it proves you haven't crossed the line or otherwise you would never desire it again you couldn't make yourself desire it see even if you were aware as brother branham matt was you know reading to us yesterday in our men's bible study breakfast and uh brother travis did the lesson for us and i i'm so glad we have him as a sunday school teacher be glad we have brother travis teaching your children out here in the class i said travis that's that's the greatest sermon on overcoming that's the greatest sermon i've ever heard in the entire world all my life and uh and i meant it quite sincerely and as you i think you young people did he go that way again brother rome uh yeah so brother owen got got a double barrel shotgun of it he was at the men's he was at the men's uh bible study where all your other teenage guys at the men's it's the men's breakfast you say i want i'm a man i want you to think of me out as a man i'd like to i'd like to i'd love to love to think of you as a man like to see you sitting at a men's breakfast bible study amen so enough of that amen amen so but but it was it was so wonderful on on the practical steps that it takes to be an overcomer you remember as i said to you recently and i i paraphrased the quote where brother branham said there's some things god is just not going to do because he's waiting for you to do it see there's some things that you you see people come to the altar and get get the new birth in a real and living fire-breathing way and god just takes habits out of their life and and cleans them up and the whole desire for drinking and smoking or drugs or whatever that whatever their vice was or all of their vices suddenly it's gone and they're they're at a loss to explain how it's gone and where it went it's just gone see but then there's also those things that you remember you're still in a broken body of sin and flesh and you're born with different weaknesses and different propensities and and satan knows how we're building and the callings and gifts on our lives and he satan has a tailored plan he has a file with your name on it and he spends a lot of time when you were just a baby no bigger than sister lana who we dedicated today he's already started compiling her file i'm glad jesus has a file over also hallelujah her name is on a book of life and the enemy's never gonna the enemy's foul is going to be disregarded hallelujah and we're going to fight his plan in prayer hallelujah we're going to preach the the unsearchable riches of christ and we're going to live an example before our children amen and we we find that god loves life and you know this would explain when you when you think about blasphemy of the holy ghost tonight i'm not going to take the passages to read it today it would slow me down too much but you can find it in matthew and and you can find it in luke and you can find it in in mark and where jesus talks about how that to speak a word against the son of man can be forgiven you in fact is in matthew he says all manner of sin and blasphemy all manner of it will be forgiven you however when the holy ghost comes and this is a paraphrase because i'm i'm mashing all three passages up when the when the era of the holy ghost because that was the christian era christ was on the scene he was he was alive those three and a half years that was the christian era the era we're in now is the era of the holy ghost we're in the holy ghost era that same jesus is living in his church the very same one not another jesus but the very same jesus is now living in his church in a many membered multi multiple-membered body around the world this was always god's plan this is what brother brown said in melchizedek we see this imagery we see what what god is bringing every sun in melchizedek you know hundreds of years before calvary before the holy ghost that you're seeing in melchizedek what every son of god is going to come to what was melchizedek he was the word made flesh it's a human being formed by the word of god see and so so we find that's why brother branham would say we don't see him no more because he becomes jesus christ same person not a different person only the same god in a different form and and and so now so now when we when we come forward this this would explain why some people can actually appear to blaspheme the holy spirit and yet not actually do it and later come to saving grace and you've seen that happen see and then while others at the same time uh we we find that others with almost with almost no effort at all cross that line early and have no forgiveness in this life for the life to come brother branham talks about a prayer line we're in a meeting and he says it was so sad to him he said here was an altar this was in his previous meeting he's now in a meeting given testimony and he's trying to tell the people don't wait don't wait come now while the spirit is calling he said i was just in a meeting and he said it was so so hard to see young people up around the altar crying they were crying real tears trying to repent and he said but i could look down in there by that gift and know it was already too late they had already sent away their day of grace he said well i thought they would never desire it again you can still get caught up in an emotional moment you could still come under i mean uh you know when we talk about we talk about how that you know jacob and esau and we find that he saw sought repentance with with tears bitter tears but he found it not see because you can't just go you say well isn't salvation a free gift well sure it is of course but you can't steal it see it has to be offered to you it is free but you can't just take it it's got to be offered and that's why god is only ever obligated to offer it to a person one time and then he's just if he never offers it to him again he's still just because he did and they rejected it and it might not even be the full word it might just be something of his divine nature it's his divine character in nature and you you just reject that and and and believe some darwinian nonsense and at that point god thank god his throne is established in mercy and he told moses i reserve mercy for thousands and and and and and maybe he will keep coming again and again i'm glad he did for me how many are glad he didn't give up after one time oh my and even even even after coming to him we still have our ups and downs and our failures and we hit on and off again we get out of balance and we have to find our way coming back to him through prayer see and and and so but he's he's not obligated to do it he's just if he never does it again and and so you know everyone is given a legitimate chance by this loving god you know to we said this here in a bit in peace a sermon or two ago we made a reference to brother branham's terrible dilemma as a child terrible thing to put a child through that catholic dogma brother branham said i was raised and thought that here was what he was taught his parents got taught this and they innocently passed it on to little william that god he said i thought god hated me but jesus loved me what a trauma to put a child's mind through that this all-powerful god hates him but jesus is a loving savior who's trying to help him and you know the devil's always trying to make it confusing like that i'm glad that the the mighty god has been unveiled and i'm glad we're not in confusion on who jesus is amen i'm glad we're not in confusion on god's plan before the foundation of the world and so so what you find then is that you know that that that that god gives every man an opportunity he even gave cain an opportunity even knowing that cain couldn't take it and it wasn't necessarily an opportunity to receive abel's revelation cain wasn't predestinated to that but he still told him if you'll just do as your brother does if you'll just respect his life in your life show respects to him in your life i'll find a way i'll find a place for you i'll save you and even even jesus offers judas a pause judas hold on betrayeth thou the son of man with a kiss you sure think son think you sure that's what you want to do see and and so so we find then that that that sometimes in our in our minds you know we can we can we can think of you know esau uh jacob have i loved he saw have i hated that's an absolute truth but yeah you have to understand that that that god that doesn't mean god ever stops loving all life that doesn't mean that god ever diminishes don't ever have god diminishing don't ever think that somehow his justice diminishes his love or that his love sets aside his justice because if he loses either one he's subtracted you understand so he's perfectly loving and perfectly just in all things see and so so with so then to think of god as someone who hates you but that jesus loves you the truth is that god tries to save everybody that is willing to be saved but you can it is a fact of humanity that you can keep rejecting the holy ghost to the point where you cross the line between judgment and mercy or as sometimes we might we might use a different term and say he's blasphemed the holy ghost and and they're technically different but ultimately you're you're doomed for almost the same reason amen because with that final rejecting of what we would say one time too many you cut yourself off from the holy spirit the only one who can lead you to repentance see this is a critical failure because you can't come on your own and the the end in the end it becomes a fatal decision for you to reject him one time too many and you've rejected the holy ghost whether you're speaking against the working of the holy ghost say oh if somebody speaks against the holy ghost they're doomed well they might be jesus said you're in danger of eternal damnation you're at least you're in danger of it you better be careful but but i've heard people reject the message only later to receive it i've known people who received it then left it then came back to it see so this this is god's mind i'm glad god's in control i'm glad god looks at the heart it's not you and me deciding i remember one time a a deacon in a church i went to he was talking to a peach farmer he was talking about how you know they've got bad ones and and he says the bad ones are all on the ground they didn't have enough to hold on and nature you know evicted them from the tree and he says he says well he says if that's the case he says why why do you wait why do you let it encumber and use up all the use up all the nutrients why why don't you just go ahead and climb up in the tree and take away all the bad ones and he says oh you can't do that he says why not he said because you can't tell which is which he said you might pull a good one off thinking because it looks like a bad one and you say oh this thing is so bad it's hopeless it's got to be and i'm just going to pull it off and toss it on the ground and that was actually gonna turn around and become healthy and then he says you you can't he says oh well then why don't you just take it and tape it back he said it won't it won't take hold you can't do that once you cut it from its life source so you know there here's our life source and i don't ever want to find myself making the decision to cut you off from the life source i just want to keep trusting god and keep believing and keep pressing the battle and keep preaching because i've seen a lot of rejection only later to come back in repentance and become some of the finest character people you would ever want to be around every one of us in here have that testimony how we ran from god every one of us had that testimony some of us almost atheist and god rich had mercy in a moment came down with his word and changed your whole heart and life but there is the truth that you can go too far and in the end it becomes a fatal decision you'll never have forgiveness in this life or the world to come see with the holy ghost say well cross the line of judgment mercy how how does that how does that why does it work like that because with the holy ghost finished calling you you would never desire god again not in any meaningful way you know mankind tries to comprehend god in his mind and you know however you imagine him whatever model you draw of him in your mind don't ever as i said last time don't ever have god say oh somebody blasphemes the holy ghost okay fine they blast from the holy ghost they cross the line i know that happens i know it happens it happens a lot more than you think it does and and they they literally become a living soul in prison now but in whatever way you imagine that for being fulfilled please don't have god sitting in a corner pouting angry spiteful and vengeful and since you hurt his feelings he's gonna burn you in a lake of fire because that's not the god of this book the god of this book loves life he loves all life he doesn't want anyone to die he says why will you die why will you not come to me and live he's not going to force himself on you because he's not interested in the kingdom of slaves he wants a kingdom of children who have been nurtured by him and love him and have learned to love him and grow to love him and let me tell you something friends that's why i constantly say our future is bright paul says it's never even entered your mind your imagination can't even comprehend the life brother branham says where we're going to live we're going to life oh my the world's not ending only the order of the world is changing the world can't end and somebody says the world's about to end no it's never going to end it's an eternal attribute of god but it is about to be renovated with a brand new government where jesus is going to be king say what's going to happen to all the sinners they're going to destroy themselves god's not going to destroy people in the tribulation they're going to be the victims of their own circumstance god's just simply going to pull out all the stops he's going to take a bride off the earth and all the blood is gone and then when you reject mercy and you reject the bleeding word then there's nothing left for you but the impending judgment which was already there the day you were born and god knowing it has tried forever to save you and if you end up in a tribulation you took yourself there that's why i've said it when you read the the great white throne judgment whether you read it from the book of revelation or whether you read it from matthew's gospel it's it's very loud on what you don't hear and what you don't hear that is deafeningly loud is anyone crying foul no one is carrying signs saying no justice no one is marching saying we want justice this ain't fair you don't find anyone saying that to him and i suppose there must be something about coming into his presence and when their life and the very thoughts of their heart are played back as brother bram said on god's big tv screen in the sky i think there is just a knowing at that moment you did it to yourself and i think that air you see what you see is everybody resigned to their fate and they just go off in silence there's no one kicking and screaming because they know at that point there's a knowing it wasn't it wasn't my parents fault it wasn't my preacher's fault it wasn't a deacon's fault it wasn't a boss's fault it wasn't something that happened to me here or something that happened to me there god rich in mercy chased me and i rejected him and rejected him and rejected him and wanted nothing to do with him if you if you rejected the spirit of god and the nature of god and the characteristics of god and you rejected the idea of having a life of righteousness and holiness in the spirit of the holy ghost why would you even want to go to heaven because it's going to be nothing but that amen so you wanted a life of revelry and darkness and sin well there's a place for that too and and and and and brother branham so god doesn't send any man to hell the man sends himself there man kind you know dooms himself you know he he that he dooms himself by rejecting this god of love and mercy say well business isn't the wrath and judgment sure yeah sure absolutely god god can and does pour out wrath pours out sometimes very uh even even even severe judgments but you know something friends truth is that that's largely people reaping what they sow and i mean i mean that that you know the laws of of nature and nature's god being just harvest must come and so quite naturally if you the the worst seed you sow the worst harvest you're going to reap that's just the laws of nature and god's nature see and so so we find then that that it it's not an injustice on god's part remember he could never diminish or subtract uh or be less god's constant nature and god's constant characteristic is mercy his constant characteristic is love his constant characteristic is kindness but his ju but it's but never at the cost of his justice his justice is never sacrificed for his love because then then you've diminished him so whether he's a loving somebody you think doesn't deserve it or somebody that or or or you've got a lot of judgment on you you don't know why i'm just here to tell you that everything god does is just all of his words are true and all of his ways are just i mean you know he he god god says to us to be angry and sin not so even in his anger and wrath he never sins see he's not a man that he should lies not a man that he should be petty you know moses talks about that in the book of of numbers 23 god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent has nothing to repent for see he moves by his never changing never failing word he's never a man that's arrogant and unforgiving that's not god his whole being is about life and he loves life he's a kind heavenly father he he was that fountain that brother bradham describes back before the aeons back before the heavens and the earth when god was alone he said back in the eternities he was that great fountain of love and out of that fountain poured and overflowed and ran down and he said in that overflow ran down his grace and his mercy and his kindness and his whole throne is built on top of that see all good things the bible teaches teaches us come down all good things come down from the father of lights see so humanity dooms itself by blaspheming the holy spirit and leaving himself without remedy proverbs 29 1 he that often re he that being often reproved hardeneth his neck shall suddenly be destroyed and that without remedy god is tenderhearted and he's full of mercy he as i said he's known to keep mercy for thousands he's kind he's kind and he has great affection for for his family for you and i friends and you you should rejoice in that rejoice in what god has done in our day because that when when we when we come back here to paul saying my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you and as i as i said to you this is a perfect example showing holy ghost development after your new birth brother branham makes this statement here's another quote i want to read in the unveiling of god now brother branham is in a discussion he's just given a testimony about speaking to a man who's challenging him on the baptism of the holy ghost it's a baptist preacher brother says a fine man and he's his whole premise is you know you're all you have to do is believe and and the moment you believe you're you're sealed in and brother branham brother branham is trying to say you know trying to show the man that you know then then then why does the bible talk about people who believed but then afterward we're filled with the holy ghost see and of course the man didn't want to talk and the man says hey no harm done brother m says no no no harm done at all sir god bless you you know you're welcome to believe that brother branham refers to peter and he says peter said that it was for everyone god would call for would receive the same apostolic blessing your privilege today to receive the same apostolic blessing the very same one peter received in that wonderful news he says now now watch now the natural veil god the word veiled in human flesh because brother branham has has talked about melchizedek and he's talked about moses and he he's got a he's got it talking about where moses failed god and they had to put a veil over his face and and we find that brother branham says now the natural veil god the word veiled in human flesh what was it god was veiled in moses amen god was in moses now watch because now i've went from melchizedek and now we're looking at moses he says now god was in moses veiled and the presence of god was in him he was so perfect with that word in him like that till he had to veil his face and it was a vindicated prophet that unfolded the word he's talking about how the word came in moses and then moses gave it out now as soon as the word went out of him he could take the veil off because his skin didn't shine anymore because the presence of god had went out of him see but it was showing the day when the holy ghost would come as a permanent resident inside you and then now you would be the word and that's why you know a lot of times young people say you know i wish my parents wouldn't say do this and don't do this but but but all you got to do is look back in the bible and brother branham says and it was vindicated prophet that unfolded the word this word inside of moses and then he started saying thou shalt thou shalt not thou shalt thou shalt not because that's what the word does the word comes to show you what you should do to receive life and what you shouldn't do to avoid death and that's the mercy of god that's not meant to be a legal code or a law that's god trying to help you trying to save you see sometimes i'm not sure we realize the potential of just how much of god's visible presence would be seen if if the veil of our flesh was a thin veneer if we could really get the veil of our flesh thinned out by dying out and be much less of you showing i wonder how much more of god's light could go through us to the world see just as it was with melchizedek this is the model for god's family going forward this is exactly what the holy ghost was given for and i'm not talking about when i say the holy ghost is given we're not talking about a mythic some mythical thing it's not a one-off it's not a it's not merely you know a a moment where you receive power for service and that's it now it is a moment of a new birth but it's not but it's not a pointless new birth see it's not an event without further purpose can i say it that way the new birth is in a moment but just like your body change will be in a moment in the twinkling of an eye you're not you don't gradually you know slowly become born three years later five years later again six years later nine years later again i'm born again you're born again the holy ghost comes upon your life brings a seed gene of god to life annihilates an old nature and you're a new creation in christ but it's not a one-off god's not just saying now you're a son of god see you on the other side you're it's a purpose-driven new birth and god has a great purpose in your life and it's and what is that purpose there's it's there's no greater purpose in the world it's to veil god you've literally become united with the creator of all things you've become the arm of the lord to the world jesus reproduced this on mount transfiguration and this would actually be the goal of every child of god to reach and so i come back again with my question how much of him could be seen if we would make this fallen flesh a thin veneer and get yourself out of the way through prayer and through dedication see and i i think as we grow in our in our spiritual written richness um this certainly should be the effect it's it's certainly a good indicator uh when we see that effect in our lives now and and hey it works in the opposite also because peter in ii peter speaking about people who are born again who had the same experience he had warned that if you don't grow in your spiritual maturity and you don't make your fallen flesh a thin veneer and you haven't added to faith virtue and virtue and you haven't developed and haven't haven't moved up in into spiritual maturity then you get like you get like a person you're not going to be unborn again because that you can't never go back from that because and that's what paul says because there's no way to to bring christ again you can't lose it because then he could never recover you see and so so but what peter did say is that you get blind and you can't see very far and you forget that you were delivered of those things and you live a life of carnality because the world has infected your mind and you've allowed that to take place yes you're a son of god yes you believe the word of god absolutely you want that but you seem to want to have one foot in the world and one foot in the word and that's a miserable life i'm here to tell you that's not what god designed for you when he gave you the baptism of the holy ghost he's desiring that it be the arm of the lord and you're the hand attached to the arm and you're the image of melchizedek you're what moses was showing you're what mount transfiguration was all about see and so this is the this is the example that we that we walk by see say how do i get there brother jason you you get there first of all by realizing you're on a journey to get there and that god the same one who saved you has been loving you for a long time and came and and and found you i mean if you if you look at jacob jacob's one of my favorite people in the bible to study and one certainly in my top three or four and brother brahm would say now he said for jacob i mean for abraham and isaac i mean you can kind of get it but for jacob boy you're going to really have to believe in the grace of god and yet he was in the lineage of christ he said you're really going to have to lean hard into love and mercy and god's sovereign will you know he he jacob he comes to that that final trial and i'm just going to cut to the chase he comes to that final trial and he he's in a time of darkness he's in a time of desperation and desperation is often a very dark time and jacob has ran now he met god he made a vow to god and now he's been 20 years you know just just meandering through life not realizing god sees a dark night waiting for him and god knows he'll catch him and god brings him to this to this darkness and there's where he wrestled with the angel of the lord and brother brown talks about that extensively how he had to wrestle it out can't we friends can't we relate to that that that time i just had to wrestle it out that time i just had to get a hold of god and i said i'm tired of trying i'm tired of running i'm tired and i've said i've said many times that by the time jacob got to that dark night jacob was so done with being jacob i got to that point i was so done with being me i didn't want to be me anymore i met somebody like chris that was christ and i said i want to be like him hallelujah how can anyone meet christ and want to be themselves i don't i don't want to be me anymore once i met him i wanted to be him i wanted me to die out i wanted that dark night i wanted to survive it and that's what jacob did jacob outlasted that darkness oh i love that line and that song sister emily cobb's song that you know about outlasting this darkness and i just thought every time i hear her sing that line on our on our archive i i just put up my hands and i say i outlasted the darkness and i'm going to outlast this world i'm going to outlast satan's eden i'm not going down i'm going up hallelujah i'm going to outlast this darkness it's not going to get me how many want to have that claim today and say i'm marching to zion and nothing is going to stop me hallelujah [Applause] he became a prince he became israel he became a prince and we find that that he says here he brother branham talks about in the reproach for the word see once jacob came to that position he could never fall back from it say how is that even possible turns out that everything that happened to him when he was jacob all that stuff we read and go wow that guy everything that that that happened to him when he was jacob god was using to build him into israel you say but man some of those things some of those things in my life are pretty dismal failures i i wish i would have avoided them i'm sure god wished you would avoid them too but i'm here to tell you god still uses them god god doesn't leave anything god uses moments as teachable moments and brother ram said you can go off into his permissive will it's okay he'll bring you back and the road is a long road to ho you might not like the journey back but on the journey you are amen how many have been thankful for the journey and i've went off but he brought me back and i got the stripes to prove it and every one of them i say thank god amen brother branham starts talking about in reproach for the word now this is familiar to you i don't really have to read it all and i'm getting ready to close i i know i'm a little bit of overtime you okay let me just have another 15 minutes brother brown says i was preaching not long ago and a little boy out on the ship you know the story an old captain was dying he was sick and he said is there a bible on board and they caught a little boy that had a bible and coming and he come and read isaiah 53 5 he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for iniquities and he said he said let let let me tell you captain he said how my mother used to read it because it wasn't really having much effect on the captain here he was reading him the scripture in isaiah 53 but it wasn't having its desired effect and he said captain let me read it to you the way mama used to read it to me he says how that my mother used to read it said here's the way she wrote it he was wounded for willy pruitt's iniquity he was chastised for willy pruitt and all these things that he done was for willy pruitt because that was his name he put his own name there and the old captain said i like that could you read my name in it and he said i'll try and he says he was wounded for john quartz transgressions he was bruised for john quartz iniquity and with his stripes john quartz was healed and he said i see it and the lord healed him see and brother branham says read your name in it he was wounded for william branham's transgressions he was bruised for william branham's iniquity he did that for me he did that for you read your name into it oh keep keep keep growing you know i i i that's what jacob had to do jacob had to keep growing he had to keep going he he it's like it's like he did jacob it's like you did me it's like he did you can you find the courage to put your name in there and and i had to come to that day just like you did moses just like you did abraham just like you did for jason watkins he was wounded for jason watkins he was bruised can you put your name in that in that verse today can you can you find the courage just like john quartz did that even in my failures my repentance grows me that is a mind-blowing truth that even in my failures my repentance grows me this is such a beautiful plan of god no wonder he could say i'll not lose a one they're in my father's hand no one can pluck them out i will chastise them with many stripes but i will bring them back to the fold hallelujah oh that's the love of god friends that's what god even even you know i i read i read somewhere where we talk about you know my life here my life there my life this my life that and finally i came to know the lord well you understand that even in that darkness even in that time god that's what i found out i went a long time until i find out i was being followed and i turned around and somebody was following me and somebody started speaking to me and in my life of sin i kept hearing a voice adam adam where art thou had him i kept hearing a voice jacob jacob where art thou jacob i kept hearing a voice jason jason where are you son where are you son and finally one day i surrendered and i found out he was always following me he always had a plan for me i was never outside of his care oh my i was in a dark night just like jacob because i was born in darkness i was born in a body of sin i live in a world spiritually dark but oh for that morning for that morning i'm telling you i will outlast this darkness i will be eternal now i have to outlast it because this darkness is not eternal and i am eternal and so i will outlast the darkness hallelujah the bible imagery of melchizedek the bible imagery of moses they both show that i veil a great light you might have a hard time believing that for you your life might be in a place where you just say i would love it but there's no way i can get there impossible i'm sorry preacher it's impossible but yet there it is in jacob and i would just say to you today it was impossible for him too there it was in jacob and even when jacob was walking in his own will he still on that great morning he still became israel a prince say how is that possible because the bible says jacob have i loved he loved him even when he was jacob he loved me even when i was in darkness jacob have i loved there was never a time god didn't love him that's how he out that's how he outlasts darkness that's how when the sun rose that next morning jacob was gone and a prince israel a shyster to a prince overnight because he wrestled it out with the angel oh my the nighttime of this world is everywhere friends but morning is breaking the bible says to us arise shine thy light is come let's stand let's stand arise shine thy light is come brother branham closing in his message on who is this melchizedek he said you become from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted i love this line but when this life is finished here my on that morning friends brother branham says when that spirit lives in you it brings your whole body subject to that spirit and when the bible says don't do this that body quickly turns to that there's no question see now i i remember recently covering this to say the evidence one evidence of the holy ghost is that it brings your body subject to the word to every word amen but now let's just be real for a moment [Music] because there's times when my body isn't subject to the word and you have the same problem don't we so you know what we do we obey another part of the word because i failed at this part of the word i go over here and find me another word that says if we repent and commit it and confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive say but but i failed over here yeah but you met it over here and the beauty say well then i'm 50 50 no no you're 100 you know why because the obedience of this one means that the offense of this one never occurred it's as though you never did it in the first place hallelujah friends that's what the blood of the lamb is for that's what the holy ghost is given for that's the ability it has in our life and that's why i love it when brother branham he says when this life is finished when this life is finished here friends you say oh my that word that i obeyed that's how powerful the blood of christ is repentance of your failure is so powerful it literally takes the offense and makes it as if it never happened in the first place when this life is finished i'll be free [Music] the devil will never get me i love telling him that you will never get me you'll never get me i've already passed from death and to life i can never come into the judgment i've already survived the long night i woke up one morning and i was a prince hallelujah friends that's the love of god that's the god whose throne is established in mercy is that the god you serve today is that the god who's real to you listen teenager that's the kind of god who's following you that's the kind of god who's talking to you that's the kind of god who's wooing you and calling your name saying you're mine i won't lose you surrender now or surrender tomorrow but you're gonna surrender oh i just advise you today surrender right now surrender right now and let the love of god just wash over you bow your heads with me all over the building father may the love of god wash over our whole mind right now may you be pleased lord to make this word a living reality to these people you've made it so real to me lord god i i i'm now an extension of the arm of the lord the arm of the lord has been revealed to me you helped me you commissioned me now you have no hands but mine no feet but mine no lips but mine now my commission is going to all the world baptize them preach the gospel to every creature demonstrate the holy spirit to a dark world because your demonstration is a demonstration of shining light help us today lord may may we have our minds adjusted to understand that you're not a tyrant you've never been even in crossing the line of judgment mercy even in the tribulation even the lake of fire mankind does that to himself you don't send anyone there you're trying to save everybody you're loving you're kind you're filled with mercy you reach out again and again and again you will never lose your family you offer every man an opportunity the opportunity is offered today friends with every head bowed if you stand there today you've never you know you say preacher i i believe what god has done in this day i'm not that's not in question i know god sent us a prophet i know jesus was real i know what that day on calvary meant i know the holy ghost is the truth but you know that you've never made that surrender you're still in that dark night struggling you're still on your journey you're on a journey you've got a destination in the mind of god why don't you just surrender today and say lord i can't save myself but if you have me and you'll save me then i'll just slip up my hands oh i'm gonna tell you every sinner and every saint needs to just raise up both hands and make that if you've already surrendered at some time just raise up and say lord i surrender more i surrender more i surrender again and again and again i want the veil of my flesh to be so thin that the light of the gospel shines through me may you grant it today lord we've been long and ministering but the thought was so heavy on my
