========================================

[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen first john chapter four if you have your bible and then we'll go to what we read last sunday we just want to continue this on part two of the antichrist spirit at work beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world you are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you can be seated this morning we took a lot of time last sunday and we'll just get straight to it to lay a foundation we ended on some quotations of god's prophet speaking about the antichrist spirit how that is it is a religious spirit we took a lot of time to show you that it is more of the interest of the devil and his schemes and his plans and he is more interested in corrupting true faith than trying to get you to reject faith altogether it's interesting because the scripture that we read here and i'm just going to cover some of this as as review that we just for a minute here we talked about the antichrist spirit that the bible says as we read in first john this is that spirit of antichrist so we know that it's a spirit we know that the he says whereby you should try the spirits discern the spirits see if they be of god or not and i believe more than ever before in the day and age that we live in we should be discerning spirits and discerning spirits sometimes you don't uh to discern us the spirit of something you don't look at necessarily what you see with your two eyes or here with your two ears but we're prayerful and we approach things with great prayer and soberness of mind and every decision that we make in life should be approached understanding that we live in a multi-dimensional world where everything has a spirit everything has a spirit and something may look harmless completely to you maybe from the outside it looks completely harmless but everything carries with it a spirit of something and it doesn't matter in what category we're speaking of everything carries spirits that's why we look at certain things and we say well you know even even for you know for ourselves we that's what the apostle paul is speaking of here when he says try the spirits see if they be of god or not so he says here in first john 3 4 3 this is that spirit of antichrist where if you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world so john says you've heard of that spirit you've heard it mentioned it's been preached it's been taught and you are expecting its arrival but wake up it's already here and this is in effect what he's saying here that what you've heard of that's coming is already here and it's already at work in other words that spirit is not going to we think of the antichrist and we think oh it's going to be a person you know in the in the in the after in the tribulation period they're going to crown a you know a uh there's going to be a person who disease deceives the entire world and and and that's true well that has a connotation in the context that's true we have to also understand that the spirit that will in that person will as christ was god incarnate and that man will become satan incarnate but yet that spirit as the holy spirit influences god's people today the antichrist spirit influences the children of the devil and the bible calls them the children of disobedience what we what we took time last sunday showing you is that the antichrist spirit is a religious spirit it's a church spirit it's exactly what satan his ambition was in the beginning was to have a church i'm going to show you something very interesting that'll help your mind when you think of the antichrist when you think of that word antichrist what is the first thing and i want someone to say it if you want to speak out go ahead and say it what's the first thing that you think of when you think of what does antichrist mean against christ now that i would think that's the first that is the first and those of you online probably thought the same exact thing that's the first thing you think of when you think of antichrist but let's look at a little bit closer here and look here in first john 4 in your bible again he says verse 3 in every spirit uh that confesseth not let me make sure i'm in right yes that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god he says and this is that spirit of antichrist where a view of heard should come and even now is already in the world that word antichrist is strong's number 500 this is the greek lexicon and it's a transliterated word called anti-christos so it's transliterated but it's root the word anti when he speaks of anti the root of that word is strong's number 473 which gives it a completely different meaning in your mind and actually when the bible speaks of the antichrist spirit it doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't necessarily only mean a spirit against christ but it actually means instead of christ now think about this just for a moment that antichrist spirit that we speak of we could say what does antichrist mean it means to be against christ well not necessarily what it actually a more proper understanding of what it means when we say antichrist is instead of christ or let me go a little bit clearer in place of christ this is actually strong's 473 it means for instead of or in place of something now that brings on an entire other meaning that when what is the antichrist spirit at work in the world and in churches and in religion today it's not a spirit that's against christ it's a spirit that's instead of christ or in place of christ you could think of the pope what is he instead of that that pope is instead of christ it's a mediator between christ and man but this spirit speaking of is a religious spirit it means to be instead of christ or in place of or a religious system that would replace true faith turn uh if you could actually if you could turn that power point on here just for a moment i want to just read some of these uh quotes let me make sure that's where i want to go now listen to what brother branham says here and i think i got the clicker on now good this is why we are not a denomination now here is your shocking point you say well you ain't hitting me now brother brandon before this quote spends a lot of time to speak about the antichrist spirit or the mother harlot spoken of in the book of revelations and maybe we'll just take a time just time just to read that in revelations chapter 17. if you have your bible you can turn there i'd like you to turn if you have revelation 17 brother mark if you want you could take that down and put it up or brother matthew uh if you wanted to revelation 17 verse 1. and this is a lot of review for a lot of people but i believe it's good to go back and touch on some of these things that that we we believe revelations chapter 17 and you'll find this in revelations the 17th and the 18th chapter where it speaks about a great mystery babylon the mother of harlots you'll read those words in revelation 17 and 18 and that mother harlot uh is identified also as the mother of abominations and she is the direct enemy in opposition to christ and we know exactly who it is because all of us would say who is that great that's that it speaks about that sitteth off the many waters it's the catholic church we're not going to take time to to teach on that this morning as i believe that's rudimentary for all of us but we want to just draw out some of these things that we um that we already know so it identifies her this great mother harlot and it speaks about her uh as part of a system and look at revelations chapter 17 and uh we'll just begin reading with verse one and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come come hither i will show unto thee the judgment of the great that sitteth upon many waters with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so what was her fornication when we speak about that now brother branham said her fornication was in that she labeled herself as the seed of christ that she called herself the seed of god but her life or her or what she actually was was hypocritical that she didn't stand the word test and so because of that not just her doctrine but that was fornication and the inhabitants of the earth had been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit of the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy having seven head heads and ten horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was the name written mystery babylon now why is it a mystery what is a mystery something previous previously hidden what's a revealed mystery something previously hidden now made known so it was a mystery but it's not a mystery anymore sometimes we look at these things in revelations and our mind just goes what does this mean and what is these symbols well if you go and pick up your church age book a lot of this becomes so crystal clear and a lot of the reason let me just say this and i don't mean this uh in any way as a strike or a uh a chastisement i mean it is an admonishment a lot of the reason why believers believers message believers get uncomfortable when you start talking about these things they're not uncomfortable in the sense that they don't want to hear it but they feel lost what does this mean they don't get it that's that's that's due to the fact that message believers are unlearned or they haven't spent time reading the church age book or the message of the hour that's really what it boils down to is the reason why you don't understand these things is because you we're not doing our diligent thing that we should as sons and daughters of god and we're not studying these things because if you open your church age book this would just be elementary to you and for some it is thankfully but i encourage you if some of these things that we read and you you don't connect the dots and i know you don't get them they don't always i have to go back and look at things uh myself to refresh myself but these things should be knowledge they should be easily knowledgeable to our young people to our old people to all of us so he says the name was written mystery babylon the great mother of harlots and the abominations of the earth and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus and when i saw her i wondered with great admiration and here is the mind which hath wisdom verse nine the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth verse 15 and he said unto me the waters which thou sawest uh and he said to me the waters which i saw where the horse sitteth and peoples of multitudes and nations and tongues and the woman which the sauce is the great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth so now we know clearly we're clearly taught that what it's speaking of is the roman catholic church and and how that system would deceive the rest of the world so we can identify who the mother harlot is but now let's go a little bit further because she's a mother so a mother how does someone become a mother you have children and the bible speaks of her daughters and the kings of the earth so not just churches but the entire world with whom verse 7 let's look at verse 2 again what we just quoted there so that vatican the great that great city which is who it's speaking of uh is a religious system as we said it's religious it's church it's not something out disconnected way off into voodoo or witchcraft but that spirit is a religious spirit it loves to worship god it's mass producing music you can find on youtube under the under the genre christian that system that great harlot and her daughters is producing christian music and christian churches so what does that mean brother matt now you know why first john 4 says try the spirits see whether they be of god or not let me just stop here and say this to our young people and to all of us don't just listen to any music that's under the genre of christian music what if that music you're listening to is part of the antichrist system and you're being influenced i'm being influenced by listening to it that's why we try the spirits amen we don't just gobble anything down what did brother adams teach us to do give it the word test amen can i hear a hearty amen didn't lose you did that give it the word test don't just gobble it down don't just take it in we don't just we don't just take any any this isn't a free-for-all and a free and grab-and-go we don't believe in grab-and-go uh spiritual food we don't just grab it and go you know like they have sandwiches at the airport you just grab it and go you don't even look you just pay for it go get on the plane you got something to eat that's not how we treat our spiritual appetite because our spiritual well-being is important to us so we we try the spirits we see whether they be of god or not this system is producing christianity the system is producing church entity it's producing under the auspices and under the title of christianity so it's the vatican that great mother harlot that deceives the world and those many waters refer to the nations of the world the worldwide church religious system of false religion that whether they realize it or not is controlled by one city but it covers the entire earth that roman catholic system catholicism touches all of the entire earth look at verse 2 of revelation 17 with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so religious fornication is what the term that god uses listen to this very closely because it's gonna light bulbs gonna uh your you should have a moment here where you go aha so religious fornication is the term god uses for any anybody any system any person that claims to be a christian but in reality is not in reality you're not sold unto christ but you're giving yourself to other things so that woman that it speaks of verse 3 if we could read that so he carried me way away in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy now remember the sermon brother branham preached blasphemous names if i trust as your message believer you've heard that blasphemous names and brother branham says what made them names of blasphemy is that they called themselves it's what they labeled themselves and brother adam says that they said we're the church of god so god said okay well then i'll judge you as your confession as what you confess they'd have been better off to say you know not not you you don't receive judgment when you don't claim to be something that you're not but when you attach yourself to the name of christ then brother bannon said then god judges you as what you say that you are. and so that woman uh this speaking here that scarlet beast the bible says she sits upon a colored scarlet colored beast that scarlet beast speaks of the power of you of the uniting power of governments and churches and world systems that will eventually that will eventually be under the rule of one person one satanic person when he's when he's the satan incarnate in a false prophet but that's then this is now and now we don't have it in a flesh and blood body of the false prophet now we have it in a spiritual realm and it trickles down into the entire world in the entire church world and christian so-called christian system that spirit that is already at work remember what does the antichrist mean not necessarily against christ though he is against christ but it's instead of christ or in place of or replacing anything that replaces true apostolic faith and replaces it with anything else is an antichrist spirit let's say that again anything that replaces an apostolic experience or apostolic faith which was the true church in the beginning and replaces it with believing confessing sinners prayers shaking the preachers hands putting your names on a book is an antichrist spirit anything that would replace the apostolic experience by the baptism of the holy ghost in a believer as making that believer born again if you call it anything else as an antichrist spirit so i'll go further than that even a doctrine that would say you just have to believe the message is an antichrist spirit you just believe the word for your day that's if if it's said in a context of you just mentally agree with a prophet and a message that's an antichrist spirit because anything that replaces the new birth as being the as being an apostolic experience by the baptism of the holy ghost where a person is regenerated and changed from their old carnal nature to the new nature that comes through christ is an antichrist spirit amen he says here and the woman was arrayed in purple verse four the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication so we know who this is we know that who's speaking at verse five and upon her forehead was the name written mystery babylon the great the mother the mother so she has daughters it's not just the roman catholic church but it's all the denominational denominations or so to stop there and say it's all the denominations who are her daughters he says the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth so who is mit why does it say mystery because it was hidden before you didn't realize who it was but now we do and it's a organized religion it's an organized false system in a false religion and verse 6 and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and the blood of the martyrs of jesus and when i saw her i wondered with great admiration now let's get to our quotes if we could brother mark before we run out of time here as i'm not the song leader today so i gotta i got to be real good about my time let's look at these this is this is why we are not a denomination in 1958 now here is your shocking point you say well you ain't hitting me now this is brother random saying you're talking about the roman catholic church and you're talking about catholicism brother matt we're not catholics here are we we're not in we're not affected by catholicism are we not well you ain't hitting me brother brandon but let me just ask you something let's go right back now to the fifth verse and upon her head was written mystery babylon the great mother of abominations the mother of harlots and the abominations of of the earth what was she and she was a mother what mother she had begotten something please pay close attention a mother of sons of harlots what is a harlot same thing as a immoral woman what made her immoral her doctrine it's what she believes she was pretending to be a christian church but was giving out a man-made dogma and here she says that she had if she was the first organization then seems like there's some organizations come out of her she was the mother of harlots is that right a mother of harlots could it be a mother now of boys could it be a mother of it had to be a mother of women and if they were women they were churches so out of that system comes churches daughters what was the first organism now you see why the title of that message is why we are not a denomination what was the first organization catholic church what was the second organization luther what was the third organization's wiggly what he and brother anne's just listing here the beginning of denominational churches would it come on down to calvin and they're coming to angelico now remember it's not the people we're not against the people let me just say this here for a moment we don't identify people we identify spirits john 1 john 4 said he didn't say try the people to see whether they be of god or not and that's the reason we get into so much trouble when so much schism comes in the body is that we don't discern the spirit we discern the people and that could be your brother or your sister you say let me let me let me just give you the most extreme example i don't know whether the pope himself will go to hell i don't know that because the pope's a man he'll stand before a judge a righteous judge and he'll be tried but i don't wish for the pope himself to go to hell because i'm not trying the man the bit that that literal man from another country who don't even know i'm trying the spirit do you follow me we don't wish that anybody would go to hell we don't wish that anybody would be lost we don't look at people at other denominational churches and say they're just a bunch of harlots i've heard that said and i think my goodness have you missed the message completely brother branham never spoke against the people against the people it was against the spirits that they were under amen amen when it come down to calvin they're coming to angelico because these were good people these were good christian people but the system that they were under was a false religious system angelican come on down to methodist the methodist what did the methodist produce just little isms i moved way down to another paragraph so if you go back and read this you'll see i skipped that just little isms running out like that keep running on down each one of them little starters back there come right on down and what did every one of them do and it finally winded up in pentecost now speaking of azusa street pentecost here and what did pentecost do the same thing their mammy did they went right back and organized and what did it become a denomination walk into the first day listen walk into one the first thing what's your doctrine boy they comb you with a fine-toothed comb see to find out what you are what you believe if you don't just tally right up with them brother you're excommunicated right now and that's right and for those of you that think this doesn't exist let me just let me just tell you it does in denominational churches we tried to have just a little small exam we tried to have a little scouts boy scouts uh christian scouts group called trail life i think it was and we wanted to be part of the organization to have a little scouts group for our boys and you know and so we came all the way down to signing up signing the papers uh our pastor was going to sign them but then it came to the document statement of faith and before you could get accepted into the group this is a christian organization we believe and god the father god the son god that god has been revealed in three persons the trinity and unless you agree and sign your name to that you can't be part of that group that's not just in a scouts group that's on every level we we take it for granted you don't realize that spirit as we spoke last sunday that trinity spirit that binds the tares together the baptist may not agree with the methodists and the methodists may not agree with the baptist but there's a unifying spirit called the trinity that binds the tares together and if you don't just tally right up with him brother you're excommunicated right there and that's right and don't think just because you say you're pentecostal that you're secured brother there'll be just as many pentecostals off the road as there is on the road and let me give you let me let me give you brother matt's interpretation and don't just think because you say you're a message believer that you're secured brother there'll be just as many message believers professed off the road as there is on the road now all these organizations if they had just left the pentecostal blessing go and not organize just keep it a brotherhood let the holy spirit do the segregation the holy spirit segregates ananias and sapphira come in one time said so and so and the holy spirit said why did you lie but we say now that's brother jonas don't you say nothing bad about him now he's the biggest payer we got in church i know he got the holy ghost i heard him speak in tongues i've seen him shout in the spirit that don't have no more than pouring peas on a dry dry cowhide see not a thing to do with it god does the same now we're going to close but i use that last example because it's amazing when we think of denominationalism and antichrist spirit then look what brother branham points to how to identify denominationalism when we have when we brother adam says when we don't let the holy ghost do the separating and then we try to do the separating well he's got it and she don't he does because of this and because of that we let the holy ghost do the separating the excommunicating we don't do that ourselves preach the word and the word will do the separating amen let's stand to our feet we're out of time sorry brother tony cut into just a couple minutes there let's just pray lord we thank you for this morning's teaching it's rich it's filled lord with so much that we could say forgive us lord for going over time this morning we pray that it would be a blessing lord to those who hear it may god you just now anoint our worship music lord
