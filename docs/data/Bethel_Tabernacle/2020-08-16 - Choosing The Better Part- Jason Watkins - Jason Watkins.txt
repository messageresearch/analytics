greetings to you all in the love the announcement for prayer we want to pray over it again uh for brother that brother george sent in urgent prayer request for our on emma cox she was taken to er by ambulance this morning having trouble breathing so we want to take that to the lord in prayer and believing that he will do more than we can think or ask amen praise the lord want to um also just uh announce again i during the sunday school class for those of you who were streaming to hear that we announced a little bit of an acceleration in our teaching on the entire book of revelation going to accelerate it just a little bit here in the live service because a 25 minute window it's difficult to get down into the nuts and bolts of it and then you barely move at all you barely even finish a verse and we've got you know 22 chapters to go through so uh during the podcast which we are uh finally or have underway amen we got our uh that was the finished edited version brother jason so we got our edited version back from uh for our introduction video on our podcast and we should be starting uh and part of the thing that i'm going to do along with several other different podcasts choosing the better part sat at jesus feet and heard his word but martha was encumbered about much serving and came to him and said lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone bid her therefore that she helped me and jesus answered and said unto her mark today may lord i just be completely surrendered to you at this hour and so i have felt your very intervening hand for this sermon today lord i've felt lord even almost a a complete interruption of my of my own plans for ministry today and so i know i know that i have your direction i'm not sure how panic that's even a slight uh interruption of our ability to breathe is very frightening so lord move for our sister right now i pray lord this church binding together that you will lay your hand upon her lord and we commit it to you in jesus name god bless you friends you can be seated hmm did brother brad pray for his his uh father-in-law uh let let's just pray again brother brad is just saying he has a prayer request his father-in-law brother tommy has coveted and his vitals are dropping and it doesn't look good for him the family is asking us to keep him in prayer amen oh so it's brother uh sister melissa's following brother jesse's dad okay and so was there prayer we're gonna pray again amen all right we'll pray for it okay all right it's from brother brad um yeah it was two two brother brad from sister melissa amen let's pray master lord we're thinking right now and joining in with our sister melissa for her father-in-law lord i pray right now you have mercy on him master lay your hand upon him right there lord and uh you know where martha lived of course was bethany there's other places in the scripture that that tell us that you can read in john chapter 11 in various places you'll find bethany was a notable city it's a few miles east of jerusalem actually and jesus actually in fact is jesus stayed in bethany uh during the final week of his life and so there's a sharp contrast in this story today uh between these two sisters martha and mary and we find that mary sat and listened to jesus while martha made preparations for meal and you know when she comes to the lord she's got a request in mind and you know she's saying can you can you please tell her that she needs to help me and you know jesus gives a gives a doubling gives a repeat of her name martha martha and this is whenever
