[33:50] Jesus Christ Tabernacle that's your
[33:52] sister Church in
[33:53] Colombia we're having a a a family camp
[33:57] with youth and family and you know it's
[33:59] this coming June June 6 through the 9th
[34:03] you know and the registration deadline
[34:05] is May the
[34:07] 9th everybody got
[34:09] it June 6 through the 9th deadline May
[34:15] 9th and if you don't have the website
[34:18] it's www. JCT
[34:22] camp.com
[34:24] amen now that the preliminaries out of
[34:26] the way let's just pray and we'll get
[34:29] right into the word of God how many got
[34:32] a need
[34:33] tonight amen I got
[34:36] plenty I got a God who can answer every
[34:39] one of
[34:40] them Lord Jesus father we love you
[34:43] tonight and we thank you for all things
[34:46] Lord God we know that you're more than
[34:48] able Lord to touch every need in this
[34:51] place Lord Lord to meet every desire in
[34:55] this place Lord Lord we ask that you
[34:57] will just shift us right now Lord shift
[35:01] us to desire what you have for us and
[35:05] not what we would will for ourselves
[35:07] Lord but what you would will for us
[35:10] because the word of God says in that
[35:13] most crucial moment that crucial Time of
[35:15] Your Life Lord you said not my will be
[35:17] done but thine will and if you can do it
[35:20] as God being God and there's no one
[35:23] greater than you and Lord you didn't
[35:25] know any sin but you were carrying the
[35:27] weight of the world on your shoulders
[35:28] Lord and in that moment the flesh
[35:30] wanting to bow out and bow down lord you
[35:33] said not my will but thy will be done
[35:36] and Lord pray event there may be someone
[35:38] in here tonight whose flesh or
[35:41] situations of Life Family Life or
[35:44] whatever it may be is trying to get them
[35:46] to bow out but Lord if we could just say
[35:49] not my will but thy will be done Lord

[40:16] this you know if when we look at uh
[40:19] Abraham you know we know the prophet
[40:22] talked about Abraham and he said there
[40:23] was nothing special about Abraham you

[40:29] God he wasn't looked upon to be somebody
[40:32] great or had great statue or come from a
[40:34] powerful Rich family none of
[40:37] that the thing of God calling Abraham he
[40:40] had to you know why because he was
[40:43] elected Hallelujah see election

[41:50] look it's all about God's grace all
[41:54] right Hallelujah and what I love about
[41:57] the Covenant of God you can be born into
[42:01] something that you don't even believe
[42:03] right now
[42:05] wow Hallelujah imagine that Hallelujah
[42:09] most of us we're born into a family
[42:12] Hallelujah and the moment you're born
[42:15] into it you don't really know who your
[42:17] mother and father
[42:19] is you're just born into a family and as
[42:23] you grow and and you get to know the
[42:25] touch of a mother Hallelujah there's
[42:27] something inside of you that connects to
[42:30] what that Covenant right W Hallelujah
[42:34] the Covenant there between a mother and
[42:36] a child Hallelujah there's something in
[42:39] her in an unseen real that just connects
[42:43] with that
[42:44] child without her even trying motherhood
[42:48] just comes out there's a there's a a
[42:52] there's a fragrance Hallelujah there's a
[42:54] certain responsibility that just comes
[42:57] out of her because it's a
[43:01] covenant and that child is born into
[43:04] that Hallelujah now I'mma hit some
[43:06] things I want y'all to catch them
[43:07] Hallelujah that child brother Virgil
[43:10] being born into that that child doesn't
[43:12] have to in that moment of being born
[43:15] reach back look back at Mama and say
[43:17] mama love
[43:20] [Laughter]
[43:22] me the mother just automatically does
[43:26] it it's a part of the
[43:29] birth it's a part of being born in that
[43:32] family that love just comes out
[43:36] Hallelujah that child doesn't say in
[43:39] that moment of mommy mommy I messed
[43:41] myself no Hallelujah mommy is looking
[43:44] for that child to make boo boos all
[43:47] right just so she can have the
[43:48] opportunity to clean it
[43:53] up that's if you a real mother
[43:57] notice I ain't got to the fathers
[44:00] yet Hallelujah but that's a part of the
[44:03] Covenant Hallelujah and you as a child
[44:07] you're born into that I see why God
[44:09] wanted me to Freestyle tonight go ahead
[44:11] Hallelujah cuz you know I was coming
[44:14] down the road and it never fails I'm
[44:15] trying to figure out which way I'm going
[44:17] go and what I'm going do Hallelujah and
[44:19] God just kept born into a covenant born
[44:22] into a covant born into a covenant say
[44:23] yeah yeah God I know that I know that
[44:24] but give me some more give me some more
[44:28] give me some more where's the rest of it

[44:35] in you it's born in you Hallelujah and
[44:38] if you pull it'll come out of me

[44:43] connection it's a covenant hallelujah oh
[44:46] my in church you take the birth of that
[44:49] child Hallelujah and and and the
[44:51] connection between that mother and that
[44:54] child in that moment Hallelujah no
[44:56] matter no matter how the child looks no
[44:59] matter how the child smell there's
[45:02] something about the Covenant between
[45:04] that child and that mother that mother
[45:07] automatically becomes a
[45:10] protector W Hallelujah she becomes a
[45:14] provider she becomes a shield a banner
[45:18] Hallelujah and and she conducts if she
[45:21] breastfeeds she conducts her body a
[45:23] certain way that it brings forth
[45:25] strength
[45:27] W all of that is given into the child
[45:31] when it's born it's a part of the
[45:34] Covenant and nobody can change it
[45:37] Hallelujah she's built like that and
[45:40] even Hallelujah uh fathers we ain't
[45:43] going to leave you out Hallelujah you
[45:44] know even that father he Taps into some
[45:48] of the same Covenant it's not a
[45:50] different Covenant Hallelujah in that
[45:52] moment of the birth you can see that
[45:54] father he's been waiting on the child
[45:57] all that time now he looks at that child
[46:00] and he sees himself on Hallelujah he
[46:03] looks at that child and he sees his seed
[46:06] his life Hallelujah everything that he
[46:08] is now is there reflected before him why
[46:12] because the life that germatize the seed
[46:15] comes from the father Hallelujah and now
[46:18] Church Hallelujah is given unto that
[46:20] child whether he likes it or she likes
[46:23] it or
[46:24] not and I know some of you girls might
[46:27] not like it but you look just like your
[46:35] father
[46:38] hallelujah it's your fault I look like
[46:42] this the
[46:44] attributes comes from the father they
[46:46] just willingly ooze out Hallelujah
[46:49] whether you like it or not certain
[46:51] habits Hallelujah certain
[46:53] characteristics things that comes out it
[46:56] comes from the father Hallelujah only
[46:58] thing we don't want sisters from you to
[47:01] get your father we don't want you to get
[47:04] their
[47:08] voice but when it comes to the spiritual
[47:12] realm we want the same voice as the
[47:15] father hallelujah it's a part of the
[47:17] Covenant Hallelujah we want to speak as
[47:20] our father speaks we're born into it
[47:24] hallelujah oh my I hope you catching me
[47:27] and just like the mother the Covenant it
[47:31] applies with the Father the father he
[47:34] learns how to care he learns how to
[47:36] protect he learns how to provide he does
[47:39] all the things and I know some of you
[47:40] still say no he don't
[47:43] either Hallelujah he does some of the
[47:45] same things that the mother would do why
[47:48] because it's under the same Covenant
[47:50] you're born into
[47:52] it Hallelujah now we look at the things
[47:55] of God we go back to God and his
[47:57] children I ain't gonna be long y'all
[47:59] know I'm about to close you go to God
[48:01] and his children man was born under a
[48:04] covenant he was born into a covenant
[48:07] Hallelujah but church we have to reflect
[48:10] we have to go back and look at the
[48:13] Covenant I think sometimes we lose track
[48:16] of what rights we really have because of
[48:19] the birth hallelujah or the family of
[48:23] God we're born into Hallelujah there are
[48:25] certain things that just comes along
[48:28] with it that you don't earn that you
[48:31] didn't work for Hallelujah not no
[48:34] certain stat is is because you're born
[48:36] into
[48:37] it Hallelujah you can't work yourself
[48:41] into it Hallelujah and you can't work
[48:43] yourself out of it Hallelujah right now
[48:47] we got children our own children that
[48:50] may have made mistakes and done things
[48:52] that they shouldn't have done but
[48:54] they're still a part of the family
[48:57] amen
[48:59] hallelujah no matter what my child may
[49:01] do Hallelujah once a digs always a
[49:07] digs some of y'all ain't catch that one
[49:11] I'm not talking about me Hallelujah I'm
[49:13] talking about be born into the family of
[49:15] God hallelujah once a child of God
[49:18] always a child of
[49:21] God and the enemy can't stop that he go
[49:25] accuse and say oh they did this say oh
[49:27] they they did that they did that and God
[49:28] said I don't see
[49:31] it why cuz there's Mercy in the
[49:37] Covenant but you look Church man was
[49:40] born into something whether he lik it or
[49:43] not Hallelujah when man when Adam was
[49:45] first created Hallelujah God gave him
[49:48] dominion over everything told him be
[49:50] fruitful and multiply but the part of
[49:53] the Covenant God say all right now the
[49:55] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil don't
[49:58] touch it see he put them under a
[50:00] covenant Hallelujah he said don't touch
[50:03] it or you should surely die that's what
[50:05] God told him and one thing about God God
[50:08] is always going to hold up his end of
[50:12] the
[50:14] Covenant God is all oh my I feel like I
[50:17] feel like I got to say this Hallelujah
[50:19] the Covenant is not a
[50:23] bargaining God is Not bargaining with us
[50:26] hallelujah it's a commandment Hallelujah
[50:30] and he he will uphold his
[50:33] side you know why because he knows you
[50:37] can't uphold your
[50:42] side oh my what an
[50:46] agreement what a if I could say we are
[50:49] under a spiritual contract with
[50:52] God hallelujah let me read something to
[50:55] you right quick
[50:57] this is in the message
[50:59] uh The God Who is rich in Mercy isn't
[51:05] he by eight of you isn't he the God so
[51:09] rich in
[51:10] Mercy Church if the microscope was put
[51:13] Upon Our Lives today Hallelujah and and
[51:16] and and in that moment God say I'mma
[51:18] reward you for the life you live today
[51:20] how many of us will be rewarded for
[51:25] good
[51:27] right now this day if if if God put us
[51:30] under microscope and he said Hallelujah
[51:32] you reap what you sow hallelujah
[51:35] hallelujah how many of us will be
[51:37] reaping heaven
[51:41] today that's how special this Covenant
[51:43] is with God even when we don't deserve
[51:47] it
[51:47] Hallelujah God continues to show us his
[51:52] grace even when we are not worthy his
[51:56] word Hallelujah makes us
[51:59] worthy cuz he told Abraham Hallelujah I
[52:03] will establish in
[52:05] you God's going to do
[52:08] it Abraham made plenty of mistakes
[52:10] Hallelujah probably probably probably
[52:12] said some things he should have said but
[52:14] God stayed
[52:16] firm w we have a God who stays
[52:21] firm and I don't know about you but
[52:23] sometimes I go through the Bible and I
[52:25] look and I see what different ones did
[52:26] did and I said God you gave him Mercy
[52:28] for
[52:30] that oh Lord I Thank You for Your
[52:33] Grace Hallelujah Lord I Thank You for
[52:36] Your Grace a lie ain't nothing for God
[52:39] to forgive cuz he did it already
[52:42] Hallelujah adultery ain't nothing for
[52:44] God to forgive cuz he did it already
[52:47] Hallelujah a cheater a murderer a skunk
[52:50] God already forgave it so you are not to
[52:53] be depressed you are not to be in your
[52:55] stage of mourning you are to be
[52:57] rejoicing cuz there's a covenant that
[52:59] your sins cannot
[53:03] change Hallelujah there's a covenant
[53:06] Hallelujah that puts the devil exactly
[53:10] where he's supposed to
[53:11] be now I'm not making room for a
[53:15] laxidasical
[53:16] life or somebody who's just out there
[53:19] floating and I don't feel like serving
[53:21] you when they should be in church they
[53:23] at home watching me on their
[53:25] television
[53:27] yeah where the camera at I'm talking to
[53:32] you you had ample time to get
[53:36] here but there's something H Hallelujah
[53:39] about knowing you're in a covenant with
[53:41] God you want to be in his presence you
[53:45] think about the one that you know has
[53:47] forgiven you when you want to see him as
[53:50] much as you
[53:53] can when you Hallelujah when you want to
[53:55] hear his voice as much as you can when
[53:58] you want to feel his touch as much as
[54:00] you
[54:03] can what are you saying brother that's
[54:05] how I feel about church whenever I got
[54:08] the opportunity to be there by God's
[54:09] grace I want to be
[54:12] there not because things have become
[54:14] convenient
[54:15] Hallelujah church I want you to I want
[54:18] you to understand something the time we
[54:21] in the Bible says
[54:23] hallelujah there's a way there's a
[54:25] straighten narrow way and then there's a
[54:28] Broadway the Broadway is getting easier
[54:31] and easier to
[54:33] take Hallelujah and you could be on that
[54:36] broad path and not even realizing
[54:38] because there's so much convenience in
[54:39] the
[54:41] world
[54:42] hallelujah hallelujah let me tell you
[54:45] something if you a person Hallelujah who
[54:48] maybe maybe at one point you know you
[54:50] was you was involved in church you you
[54:52] know he being used and then you got a
[54:54] job or whatever the case is and you're
[54:56] not there as much you better be
[54:59] careful cuz that's the enemy slowly
[55:01] stripping you pulling you away from
[55:04] Hallelujah your
[55:07] inheritance one thing about inheritance
[55:10] is yours but you got to fight for it
[55:13] because it's a part of the Covenant
[55:14] Hallelujah but look Church in this
[55:16] message he says he says many many of you
[55:19] can fellowship with me on this
[55:22] thought when you was a little boy or
[55:25] little girl you would walk around and
[55:27] there would be certain things that would
[55:29] just where it wouldn't bother the other
[55:32] kids it seemed like there was something
[55:35] in you that cried out there was a god
[55:39] somewhere yet you were a sinner
[55:41] Hallelujah while you was a sinner there
[55:44] was something in you craving more of God
[55:48] what was it it was what he put in you it
[55:50] was the Covenant Hallelujah that said no
[55:53] matter how great Sin is Sin will not be
[55:56] able to stop you from connecting to
[56:03] me you know what I like to say yeah I I
[56:06] don't know the name of that dance but
[56:08] you know that dance where they where
[56:10] they dance is old old school dance I
[56:12] ain't talking about the stuff that y'all
[56:13] kids now
[56:14] days you know I ain't talking about none
[56:16] of that it's a old school dance where
[56:19] the husband and wife are dancing and and
[56:21] It
[56:25] Go you put a rose in her
[56:29] mouth and you
[56:35] dip can you imagine you're God's special
[56:38] lady Hallelujah with a rose in your
[56:41] mouth and he let you Dance with the
[56:43] Devil
[56:49] firsto God let us each and every one of
[56:53] us Dance with the Devil first
[56:59] amen I know you think about not me born
[57:03] in the message you born in sin You Dance
[57:06] with the Devil
[57:10] first he he serenad you he danced with
[57:15] you he even dipped some of
[57:19] us and some of you ain't got over that
[57:22] dip
[57:24] yet still can remember the
[57:29] time oh my but look church I like that
[57:32] y'all know I'm a man of drama so I like
[57:34] to dramatize Hallelujah you know for
[57:37] those of you people who say I ain't
[57:38] never heard brother brandom say that and
[57:39] you never
[57:42] will you never will Hallelujah but let
[57:45] me tell you something we under the same
[57:47] Covenant hallelujah hallelujah it's is
[57:50] still the same inspiration given by the
[57:53] same God hallelujah W Hallelujah
[57:56] sometimes Church the prophet will not be
[57:58] here to cosign what's being said you
[58:01] have to believe it by
[58:03] faith Hallelujah although we do search
[58:07] through the message to look for that
[58:08] inspiration but you know Hallelujah We
[58:11] Dance with the Devil he he
[58:13] s we had the road we oh we dipping in
[58:16] everything but the thing that Satan
[58:19] didn't realize God was watching the
[58:21] whole dance Hallelujah and he was nearby
[58:25] Hallelujah and God saw his lady dancing
[58:28] with another man W Hallelujah and the
[58:31] Bible says God is jealous over you
[58:33] Hallelujah and God looked at his elected
[58:35] lady in the arms of another man and God
[58:38] came forward and say excuse me can I cut
[58:43] in Hallelujah now I don't know about
[58:46] y'all Hallelujah but it's up to the
[58:48] woman to say yes Hallelujah the man in
[58:52] that moment has no control it's her body
[58:54] it's her life and I I don't know about
[58:56] you Hallelujah although I was wrapped in
[58:58] the devil's arms when God came and said
[59:01] excuse me can I cut in it was just
[59:03] something about the way he said
[59:07] it there was something inside that just
[59:10] connected to that voice although this
[59:13] was our first time meeting there was
[59:15] something inside of me that said I want

[1:00:04] listen he said there be certain things
[1:00:07] that would bother you and other kids it
[1:00:10] seemed like there was something in you
[1:00:12] that cried out there was God somewhere
[1:00:16] yet you were at Center I love that
[1:00:18] Hallelujah why because it deals with the
[1:00:20] Covenant H there was something in you
[1:00:23] crying out even though you were in sin
[1:00:27] what was it it was the memory from the
[1:00:30] Covenant of being a
[1:00:36] god let's understand something
[1:00:38] Hallelujah Adam Hallelujah was born
[1:00:41] under Covenant Hallelujah not in
[1:00:45] sin Adam wasn't born in sin Adam was
[1:00:48] born with the likeness and image of God
[1:00:52] with the character of God the nature of
[1:00:54] God hallelujah so when sin came in it
[1:00:57] left Adam with a remembrance of what it
[1:00:59] was like to control the
[1:01:06] world that's why we crave Supernatural
[1:01:12] things how many want to go to
[1:01:15] heaven that's not coming from your
[1:01:18] flesh that's coming from the Covenant
[1:01:21] you was born into Hallelujah that's that
[1:01:24] inward man Hallelujah that will were
[1:01:26] born in the image of likeness of God
[1:01:28] craving what he once
[1:01:32] had and Adam Hallelujah born Hallelujah
[1:01:36] with the nature and likeness of God When
[1:01:39] sin came in he left Hallelujah remember
[1:01:43] catch this he left the Garden of
[1:01:45] Eden with a
[1:01:48] remembrance of what was in his
[1:01:53] contract cuz you know a covenant is a
[1:01:55] contract
[1:01:57] hallelujah hallelujah and Adam left out
[1:02:00] of the garden
[1:02:02] remembering was in his contract
[1:02:06] Hallelujah I'm going give you a little
[1:02:07] one onone in in real estate real quick
[1:02:10] Hallelujah you know when you take a
[1:02:12] contract you may have a seller and a

[1:02:26] that client
[1:02:28] hall hallelujah and what he does he
[1:02:31] doesn't share any unwillful information

[1:02:40] possible or getting the best contract
[1:02:44] possible for their buyer or seller
[1:02:47] Hallelujah so let's just say for is you

[1:03:21] Mayberry Hallelujah but you take
[1:03:23] Hallelujah you take a a a price 350 all
[1:03:26] right and let's just say the seller he
[1:03:30] he wants to get a full 350 so he puts it
[1:03:32] out there he said I want 350 but then
[1:03:34] there's a buyer who sees the house and
[1:03:36] just falls in love he says I got to have
[1:03:40] this house Hallelujah now real Faith
[1:03:42] Hallelujah I'm going tell you what real
[1:03:44] faith is you got somebody in your church
[1:03:47] right now who wanted a house that wasn't
[1:03:49] theirs but they wouldn't set in the
[1:03:50] driveway and start praying about it
[1:03:54] got
[1:03:56] Hallelujah we in a driveway and say Lord
[1:03:59] I want this house I want this house I
[1:04:01] want the prop they didn't know
[1:04:02] everything that came with the house they
[1:04:04] just looked at the house and say I want
[1:04:06] the house Hallelujah the house was
[1:04:09] somebody was already staying in the
[1:04:10] house the house is already bought and
[1:04:12] sold and it was supposed to be passed
[1:04:15] down the family but faith can stop all
[1:04:20] that some of y'all looking like I wonder
[1:04:23] who it
[1:04:24] is I I ain't going to put that business
[1:04:27] out but if you close to the family you
[1:04:29] know who I'm talking about Hallelujah
[1:04:31] see these are un un unheard of
[1:04:34] testimonies that are here in our church
[1:04:37] but we don't even know about
[1:04:39] it cuz we should be connecting on a
[1:04:41] supernatural level because no doubt
[1:04:44] there somebody here right now trying to
[1:04:46] buy a house so you need this testimony
[1:04:48] or maybe getting a house built or they
[1:04:50] didn't told you your credit ain't right
[1:04:52] or whatever Hallelujah she went sat in
[1:04:54] the driveway
[1:04:58] Lord Lord Jesus father God

[1:05:06] home she was crazy enough to do it
[1:05:09] again oh
[1:05:13] Jes and again and again and
[1:05:18] again till she got the
[1:05:22] house oh Lord they got the house I
[1:05:24] should say hallelujah
[1:05:26] but Church you think about it it's a
[1:05:27] deal that has to be set on both ends so
[1:05:31] this person the seller he might
[1:05:32] everybody all right the seller might say
[1:05:34] I want 350 and the buyer say well I
[1:05:36] ain't got 350 but uh let's negotiate now
[1:05:39] one thing you don't want to do you don't
[1:05:41] want to test that person's
[1:05:45] Integrity they looking for a deal and
[1:05:47] you come to the table with foolish
[1:05:50] thoughts ah well maybe I'll offer them a
[1:05:54] hundred
[1:05:58] 350,000 to 100 don't disrespect me like
[1:06:02] that and sometimes we disrespect God

[1:06:08] you the
[1:06:09] world if you would only believe I can
[1:06:13] give you the world if you would just

[1:06:21] got to give this 100 to SC and G or
[1:06:24] Dominion

[1:06:28] hundreds of thousands that God wants to

[1:13:19] read let me finish reading real quick
[1:13:21] Hallelujah listen he says
[1:13:26] God some you were Sinners you remember
[1:13:29] that certainly now what was that that
[1:13:33] was that little form of life in you
[1:13:39] then when I was in the world there was
[1:13:42] something already in
[1:13:44] [Applause]
[1:13:45] me that my sins couldn't stop from
[1:13:48] coming
[1:13:51] alive and I'm going give I'm going to
[1:13:53] give you a little a little anchor
[1:13:54] Hallelujah
[1:13:56] it was my sins that brought me to that
[1:14:02] place it was my raggedy tired life that
[1:14:06] brought me to a place where I would
[1:14:08] scream out for
[1:14:09] more brought me to a place where I was
[1:14:12] sick of who I was what was it it was the
[1:14:15] real life coming out of
[1:14:19] me dis you know why we here as
[1:14:21] Christians because we were dissatisfied
[1:14:24] with the world
[1:14:27] so it was who you were in the world that
[1:14:30] made you reach out for something
[1:14:38] greater you know what
[1:14:41] Rachel it wasn't even us reaching
[1:14:45] out it was Christ in you saying okay now
[1:14:50] it's time for me to come alive in
[1:14:53] you Hallelujah
[1:14:55] cuz he said no one seeks after God God
[1:14:58] seeks after you so Church think about
[1:15:00] this church God is so rich in mercy God
[1:15:03] brings the contract to you and say hey
[1:15:06] remember what I
[1:15:11] said God brings the contract to you and
[1:15:14] say hey turn to Genesis Hallelujah turn
[1:15:17] to Genesis 126 Hallelujah this is who
[1:15:20] you are God brings the contract to you
[1:15:23] flips the pages and begin to show you
[1:15:25] all of your
[1:15:29] Authority I can do all things through
[1:15:31] Christ that strengthens
[1:15:33] me it's a part of the
[1:15:37] contract but what I love about it some
[1:15:40] of you may be thinking well you say my
[1:15:41] case is special yeah it's
[1:15:43] special it's
[1:15:45] special but thisen what I challenge you
[1:15:47] to do the prophet
[1:15:50] says he says the way
[1:15:53] God if he ever move one way he has to
[1:15:57] continue to do
[1:16:00] it you know what that
[1:16:03] mean that mean he can't white something
[1:16:06] out you know we make a mistake we go get
[1:16:08] to White out like it was never D we
[1:16:09] write something else over it God can't
[1:16:11] do
[1:16:14] that once he said it he's obligated to
[1:16:19] it I give you a prime
[1:16:22] example God took a
[1:16:25] a lady who call herself the
[1:16:28] shite gave her a child a child she
[1:16:31] wasn't even crying out for but she did
[1:16:34] something special for a prophet and then
[1:16:35] God God gave her her desire without her
[1:16:38] even asking for it Hallelujah that's who
[1:16:41] he is hallelujah God will bless you with
[1:16:43] things Hallelujah he know that you
[1:16:45] desire for Hallelujah before you can
[1:16:48] even ask for it because he knew that he
[1:16:51] knows that will encourage you Hallelujah
[1:16:53] and that was something he did Hallelujah
[1:16:55] he gave this woman a child in her old
[1:16:57] age or whatever the case may be
[1:16:59] Hallelujah when she was Barren and

[1:25:05] we're under a ratified Covenant it's
[1:25:08] written in stone it's written on the
[1:25:11] blood that can't be
[1:25:13] changed Church how many of us
[1:25:16] Believers filled with the Holy Ghost so
[1:25:20] I want to demonstrate and show you
[1:25:21] something we Believers F the Holy Ghost
[1:25:25] we're born into a covenant with God so
[1:25:28] when it comes to the word of God and you
[1:25:31] come to God say Lord this is your
[1:25:34] promise this is what you said you know
[1:25:37] what it does to
[1:25:40] God In
[1:25:43] Handcuffs he can't get out of it he
[1:25:46] can't wiggle out of it he can't work his
[1:25:48] way out of it church and the more God
[1:25:51] try to squeeze the tighter it get
[1:25:54] Hallelujah see Jacob realized that he
[1:25:57] was under a covenant and Jacob said you
[1:26:00] know what I'm I'm not going to leave
[1:26:01] until you bless
[1:26:03] me where did that come from how you go
[1:26:05] through a trial looking for blessings
[1:26:07] out of a
[1:26:10] fight some of y'all don't want to fight
[1:26:13] you got to fight Hallelujah let me
[1:26:16] finish reading this and I'mma quit by
[1:26:17] the grace of
[1:26:18] God he said and when after a while you
[1:26:21] heard the gospel somebody say Amen
[1:26:24] maybe you went to church amen you picked
[1:26:28] out this and that and went to
[1:26:30] denomination to denomination but one day
[1:26:33] you being a part of
[1:26:35] God you me us one day being a part of
[1:26:40] God we had to connect with something
[1:26:45] real Hallelujah see but one day you
[1:26:48] being
[1:26:49] a to be a part of the
[1:26:53] word because you were a part of a
[1:26:56] certain contract you had to connect with
[1:26:58] what was in the contract and the
[1:27:01] contract from God is perfection so you
[1:27:03] had to connect with a word that could
[1:27:05] bring you back to
[1:27:08] Perfection that's why we're not
[1:27:10] followers of Billy Graham that's why
[1:27:11] we're not followers of or Roberts or
[1:27:14] anybody else or goo genius or TD Jak or
[1:27:17] whoever else you want to name out
[1:27:18] Hallelujah we are under a contract
[1:27:20] Hallelujah that's yearning for
[1:27:23] perfection amen amen
[1:27:25] amen hallelujah and when you heard the
[1:27:29] word hallelujah you knew where you come
[1:27:38] from I don't think anybody here is old
[1:27:41] enough I know your folks were your folks
[1:27:44] was in the meetings right were you ever
[1:27:47] on baby brother Jason was there
[1:27:50] Hallelujah think about it Hallelujah
[1:27:54] most of us never was in a
[1:27:59] service so God spoke a word in our life
[1:28:04] that we wasn't even able to
[1:28:06] believe until a certain
[1:28:11] time he told Abraham he said hey you're
[1:28:15] going to have a child knowing Abraham
[1:28:17] didn't even believe it
[1:28:19] yet Sarah didn't believe it Abraham
[1:28:22] didn't believe it but that didn't stop
[1:28:23] the Covenant that didn't stop the
[1:28:26] promise God made God has spoken into our
[1:28:29] lives and we will come unto Rapture
[1:28:35] status we will fulfill thus say the
[1:28:39] Lord why because that is who we are
[1:28:43] Hallelujah we are a part of a word for
[1:28:47] our
[1:28:50] day he said when you heard the word you
[1:28:53] knew where you come from you know what
[1:28:57] was truth hallelujah that's why we're
[1:28:59] not arguing with who a prophet is and he
[1:29:02] made mistakes and all these things
[1:29:04] Hallelujah why because you heard
[1:29:10] truth truth is not meant to be proven
[1:29:14] truth is meant to
[1:29:16] [Applause]
[1:29:19] believed
[1:29:21] Hallelujah he said you know
[1:29:24] what was truth you were always deceived
[1:29:27] was in you and this is the part I like
[1:29:31] H you know when you reading the
[1:29:33] contract there has to be something in
[1:29:36] you that
[1:29:38] agrees he says he says the word seen the
[1:29:44] word that was in you so when you read
[1:29:47] the message Hallelujah you're reading
[1:29:49] the word hallelujah and you're seeing
[1:29:52] what's in you
[1:29:55] I'm going to say that again when you
[1:29:56] read the message of the hour which is
[1:29:58] the reveal word cuz remember the prophet
[1:30:01] of God said this message made my Bible a
[1:30:03] new book Hallelujah so when you read the
[1:30:06] message hallu and the Bible which I won
[1:30:10] Hallelujah that's why we don't use them
[1:30:11] as two entities it's one Hallelujah cuz
[1:30:14] the prophet got his inspiration where
[1:30:16] from the
[1:30:17] [Applause]
[1:30:19] Bible Hallelujah he says hallelujah it
[1:30:21] was the word seeing the word
[1:30:25] amen
[1:30:27] hallelujah that's why we read the
[1:30:29] message Hallelujah and we see serpent SE
[1:30:31] what is the church we're seeing the
[1:30:33] revealing of who we
[1:30:36] are when we see the Mighty God unveiled
[1:30:39] we see the revealing of who we are when
[1:30:42] we heard the Thunders and the seals open
[1:30:44] what was it we were hearing the
[1:30:46] revealing of who we
[1:30:51] are that's why there's a people on the
[1:30:54] Earth Hallelujah that can testify and
[1:30:58] they know under the contract that the
[1:31:00] seven seal is
[1:31:03] open Hallelujah you say well he didn't
[1:31:05] give an explanation this ain't about
[1:31:09] explanations it's about a revealing
[1:31:12] hallelujah it's about a covenant of
[1:31:13] warranty that God has given you and like
[1:31:16] I love to say it's so simple hallelujah
[1:31:19] it's so simple amen well we don't know
[1:31:22] what it is I beg your part

[1:31:32] squirrels I don't believe that's a part
[1:31:34] of my journey I'm not a hunter I eat
[1:31:37] your squirrels
[1:31:39] but I'm not one to pull out the gun
[1:31:42] let's say let's go bang bang let's go
[1:31:43] hunting so I don't think I'll ever have
[1:31:45] a need for
[1:31:47] squirrels but I may have a need of
[1:31:50] another kind of creation H but that
[1:31:53] ability and power is already in my
[1:31:56] Covenant as I need hallelujah it's the
[1:31:59] word seeing the word hallelujah listen

[1:53:21] her
[1:53:26] is it
[1:53:30] good there you
[1:53:33] go so a couple of weeks ago I put in a
[1:53:36] prayer request for my trip to Alabama
[1:53:39] because I'm already a nervous flyer and
[1:53:42] for some reason like I don't normally
[1:53:43] feel the need to put in prayer requests
[1:53:45] for flights and stuff but I kept feeling
[1:53:47] like I should for that flight and I was
[1:53:49] like really nervous about it so I was
[1:53:50] like all right I'm going to go ahead and
[1:53:51] put in a prayer request
[1:53:53] and I'm glad I
[1:53:54] did because what ended up happening is
[1:53:57] my first flight landed half was supposed
[1:54:00] to land a half hour before my next
[1:54:02] flight took off and the Atlant airport
[1:54:04] is huge and that time window is small
[1:54:06] yeah and I was scared I wasn't going to
[1:54:07] make it well my first flight ended up
[1:54:10] getting delayed by an hour so I
[1:54:12] completely missed my second flight and
[1:54:15] the next flight was going to be 8 a.m.
[1:54:16] the next day oh wow so like I'm in the
[1:54:19] Atlanta airport by myself kind of
[1:54:21] freaked out like what am I going to do
[1:54:22] you know I needed another flight and I
[1:54:24] was debating like do I have Jeremiah
[1:54:26] come get me from the Atlanta airport do
[1:54:28] I just wait it
[1:54:29] out so me and another girl who also got
[1:54:33] left were trying to figure out if we can
[1:54:35] get on another flight but they had
[1:54:36] standbys for all of them besides two
[1:54:39] there was one at 11: and there was one
[1:54:41] at 7
[1:54:42] p.m. she got on the 7 p.m. one but
[1:54:46] because he was ahead of me in line I got
[1:54:47] put on the 11 p.m. so that's a 5 hour
[1:54:50] layover I'm already really disappointed
[1:54:52] apped cuz I took off work to come to
[1:54:54] this trip so I was just walked around
[1:54:56] the airport and I was praying about it I
[1:54:59] decided to go get some food and I had a
[1:55:00] feeling that told me pull out your phone
[1:55:02] and check and I checked and there was a
[1:55:03] spot open on the 700 p.m. flight so I
[1:55:06] clicked it and I got on the flight and I
[1:55:08] got there the same day praise the
[1:55:16] Lord the microphone came my way I guess
[1:55:19] I'll give this little testimony um I had
[1:55:21] shared a little bit at the men's prayer
[1:55:23] meeting just brother Diggs mentioned you
[1:55:26] know you get in the funk and you know
[1:55:29] the wowy wowy woo and sometimes it's for
[1:55:31] no apparent reason I just um was that
[1:55:35] way for a little bit of time and and uh
[1:55:39] you know then just had an epiphany that
[1:55:42] you know the devil puts this upon you
[1:55:44] just to rob you of the greatest weapon
[1:55:48] you have at your disposal to make you
[1:55:50] feel blue and low MH and so you won't
[1:55:54] pray and I took that and I knew there
[1:55:57] were people that were out on the
[1:55:59] battlefields that need a prayer and I
[1:56:02] went into fervent prayer my wife and I
[1:56:04] for those needs and the wowy wowy woo
[1:56:08] left me Hallelujah so Saints there's
[1:56:11] there's power in intercessory prayer one
[1:56:14] for another so please take up that that
[1:56:18] sword take up that greatest weapon you
[1:56:21] have and use it yes
[1:56:27] Hallelujah Mr
[1:56:29] [Applause]
[1:56:31] Melissa a couple of weeks ago I put a
[1:56:34] prayer request in for the baby of um B
[1:56:36] baby brother of my um one of my students
[1:56:38] and he came home and all his well so I
[1:56:40] just want to thank God for
[1:56:43] [Applause]
[1:56:46] that I um asked for prayer for Susie for
[1:56:51] the your sister so she got a clean bill
[1:56:54] of health praise the Lord sister
[1:56:57] Phillips
[1:56:58] hallelujah
[1:57:01] amen anybody else amen anybody else over
[1:57:06] here to I was just gonna say go ahead s
[1:57:08] that it seemed like somebody was
[1:57:10] listening to our conversation last night
[1:57:13] and by the service the Holy Spirit
[1:57:17] was all the way to Rachel all the way
[1:57:19] over yeah all the way
[1:57:23] to Rachel man yeah I've been actually
[1:57:26] meaning to give this testimony for a
[1:57:27] while but I was sick and couldn't do it
[1:57:29] so um several well about two months ago
[1:57:32] Zoe's cat figuro went missing she's had
[1:57:36] that CAT since she was very little and
[1:57:39] she was brokenhearted over it he's
[1:57:42] always come back he kind of does his own
[1:57:44] thing but he always comes back at night
[1:57:45] and eats and he just disappeared we
[1:57:48] couldn't find him and probably three
[1:57:51] weeks went by we contacted the animal
[1:57:54] shelter uh sent pictures they hadn't
[1:57:58] hadn't had them turned in we put signs
[1:58:00] all over the neighborhood three or four
[1:58:02] weeks went by and absolutely nothing and
[1:58:04] she was just so upset about it and it
[1:58:06] meant a lot to her so it was really
[1:58:08] Weighing on me and I just kept praying
[1:58:11] and I was in my kitchen one night and I
[1:58:13] was listening to brother brandom I don't
[1:58:15] even remember what I was listening to
[1:58:17] but he was talking about how people will
[1:58:19] come to the prayer line and pray for
[1:58:21] something because they go home and they
[1:58:23] get worse they give up and they lose
[1:58:25] their healing and if they would have
[1:58:27] only stuck with it a little bit longer
[1:58:29] it was almost there and so I said okay
[1:58:33] Lord I'm going to keep praying and I
[1:58:34] don't care if I have to pray for 10
[1:58:37] years I'm going to pray all the time
[1:58:39] that you give him back I know that you
[1:58:41] will I'm just going to keep on doing it
[1:58:42] so the next morning I woke up and I was
[1:58:45] sitting in my chair reading a devotional
[1:58:46] and it said the same thing that the
[1:58:49] hardest part people lose what they're
[1:58:52] praying for so many times because they
[1:58:55] don't hold on for that last 30 minutes
[1:58:58] and so I said okay Lord I'm going to be
[1:58:59] like that woman in the Bible with the
[1:59:01] unjust judge I'm just going to keep
[1:59:02] asking you and so I prayed again and I
[1:59:05] thought I'm just going to open Facebook
[1:59:07] and see if maybe animal shelters posted
[1:59:10] something so I open it and the first
[1:59:12] picture is a picture of figuro and took
[1:59:15] my my breath away I was like oh my
[1:59:17] goodness this is him I know it's him
[1:59:19] he's very distinct so I went and I woke
[1:59:22] up mad and I was like I think this is
[1:59:25] figuro he said that's absolutely figuro
[1:59:27] so we kept trying to call the animal
[1:59:29] shelter they weren't open yet and
[1:59:32] finally we got through to somebody and
[1:59:35] they had found somebody had found him
[1:59:37] all the way over by the Food Lion by
[1:59:40] Outback goodness way far away like I I
[1:59:43] can't imagine how he got there but the
[1:59:46] people loved him wanted to keep him but
[1:59:48] took him to the animal shelter to make
[1:59:49] sure he was caught up on his shots and
[1:59:51] he was healthy and they recognized him
[1:59:53] from one of the pictures and the people
[1:59:55] kept him for us and we went and got him
[1:59:58] and he's still here so it was a long
[2:00:00] time I don't know how he got there but
[2:00:02] we wanted to give God the glory for that
[2:00:05] [Applause]
[2:00:09] amen praise the Lord God still Moves In
[2:00:12] Those ways you want it sister maredith
[2:00:14] we give you the last
[2:00:20] word so this is a financial
[2:00:26] testimony back in January I had to have
[2:00:30] a test done and you know being in
[2:00:32] healthcare I knew that it wasn't cheap
[2:00:37] but I didn't know exactly how expensive
[2:00:39] it was and um the lady sent off one test
[2:00:46] that saw me and um I got the bill a
[2:00:50] little later it's about $300 for this
[2:00:53] one test and I was like it was right
[2:00:57] after Christmas I was like we
[2:01:00] don't I I we didn't have the money to
[2:01:02] pay for it at the time and so I very
[2:01:05] politely sent the lady that did it um
[2:01:10] because she didn't know how much it cost
[2:01:12] either and I sent her a message and I
[2:01:14] said um I just want to make you aware
[2:01:18] Just for future reference that this is
[2:01:21] how much such and such such cost so you
[2:01:23] can know for your self-pay patience and
[2:01:26] she's like her ma got back with me and
[2:01:29] she said Miss Miss L we're going to look
[2:01:32] into it for you and see if we can get it
[2:01:34] taken care of so I got another phone
[2:01:37] call from her later and she said we're
[2:01:40] still looking into it we'll get back
[2:01:42] with you well the last phone call I got
[2:01:44] from
[2:01:45] her she said they took care of it so
