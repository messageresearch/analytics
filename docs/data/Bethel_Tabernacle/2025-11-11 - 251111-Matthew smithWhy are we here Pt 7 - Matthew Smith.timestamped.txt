[4:45] No one knew how alone
[4:48] [music and singing]
[4:48] I was feeling
[4:52] and the emptiness I tried so hard to
[4:57] hide.
[4:59] [music] Though I laughed and said my
[5:02] life was fine without you.
[5:07] I was covering [music]
[5:08] up the secret tears I cried.
[5:12] Oh, this
[5:17] of your mercy [music]
[5:21] and the love you showed on a hill called
[5:25] Calvary.
[5:26] There you died. There you died and
[5:31] purchased my redemption.

[6:40] and your ear
[6:42] is open [music]
[6:43] every time I pray. [singing]
[6:47] No one else has ever [music] cared for
[6:51] me like you, Lord.
[6:55] Other friends could never [music] be as
[6:58] close to me. I'm not afraid. I'm not
[7:03] afraid [music]
[7:03] to face the problems of [singing]
[7:06] tomorrow,

[7:12] I'll ever [singing] need.
[7:16] I'm amazed. Oh, could [music] you raise
[7:19] your hands and tell him with your eyes
[7:21] closed? Tell Jesus, I'm amazed
[7:26] [singing and music]
[7:27] that you care.

[7:47] washed. [singing and music]
[7:50] Give the Lord a great big hand clap of
[7:52] praise. [applause]
[7:56] Crossing the calm seas with Jesus.
[8:01] The disciples were getting concerned.
[8:07] See no [singing] hope in [music] the
[8:09] distance.
[8:12] They were frightened and nowhere to run.
[8:17] M
[8:18] how [music and singing] dare that we
[8:20] perish were helpless and were helpless
[8:24] and were so afraid.
[8:28] But Jesus arose [music and singing]
[8:30] when they called him
[8:33] and [music] said to them, "Where is your
[8:36] faith?
[8:37] Because [music] you prayed [singing]
[8:41] all night. Oh, you [music] held on with
[8:45] all your might. Child, your cross

[9:22] Sing it now. The storm of your life had
[9:26] begun.
[9:29] Oh, see [music and singing] no hope in
[9:31] the distance.
[9:34] You're frightened [music] and nowhere to
[9:36] run. By now, your vessel is failing and
[9:42] you're [music] thinking and you're
[9:44] thinking that you'll surely drown.
[9:48] You cried out for [music] help from the
[9:51] master. Play it now. Oh, and you know
[9:55] you can't give [music] up now [singing]
[9:58] cuz you pray [music]

[10:43] The disciples [music] were getting
[10:46] concerned.
[10:48] Oh, see no hope in the distance.
[10:53] They were frightened [music]
[10:54] and nowhere to run. [singing] Oh my.
[11:00] Sorry. We're helpless. Oh, we're
[11:03] helpless [music] and we're so afraid.
[11:06] Jesus. But Jesus [music] arose when they
[11:10] called him. And he said [music] to them,
[11:14] "Where is your faith?
[11:17] Cuz you prayed [music and singing]
[11:19] all night. Oh, you held on with all your
[11:24] might. Child, your cross
[11:29] [music] have awoken.
[11:31] The master,
[11:34] [singing]
[11:36] he knows [music]
[11:38] [singing] your voice. So lift your
[11:41] hands. Lift them up. Lift those hands.
[11:44] [music] Oh child, [singing]
[11:46] your cross
[11:48] have awoken. [music]
[11:51] The master.
[11:53] crossing that bridge.
[11:56] You're up there [music] worried that
[11:58] he's fast asleep. The winds are [music]
[12:01] so deadly. The waters so deep. But try
[12:06] to [music] be patient cuz soon he'll
[12:08] bring peace. Just one word from his
[12:12] voice. It all must see
[12:15] [music]
[12:19] cuz you prayed [singing]
[12:22] all [music] night. Oh, you held on with
[12:26] all your might. Child, your cross
[12:31] have awoken. [music]

[12:41] your voice.

[12:44] It's time to rejoice,
[12:47] child. Your cries
[12:50] have awoken
[12:53] [music] the master.
[12:57] Give the Lord a hand anyways. Amen. We
[12:59] need brother John Lichek [music]
[13:02] [applause] to rescue us out of that one.
[13:03] But that's all right. Are you glad that
[13:05] he knows your voice?
[13:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know you already did it, but
[13:08] turn around and shake somebody's hand
[13:10] again. Tell them, "God bless you again."
[13:12] I think it's hot enough in here now. We
[13:14] can turn that heat down. It's getting
[13:15] hot, brothers.
[13:17] [clears throat]
[13:18] Amen. You can be seated. You can be
[13:20] seated. Take your seats.
[13:24] I want to sing that song, Amazing Grace.
[13:27] Where would I be? I think it's that key.
[13:31] Maybe not. That might be too high.
[13:36] Where would I be? [music]
[13:40] [snorts] You only know.

[17:37] Amen. Brother Luther, could you come
[17:39] now? Let's all stand back [music] to our
[17:40] feet. Amen. We didn't have any specials
[17:43] tonight, so we're just uh going to keep
[17:45] singing, but we want to just take up the
[17:47] tithes and offerings tonight. Do you
[17:50] love the Lord Jesus? Amen. We won't do
[17:52] this at this time, but any unspoken
[17:53] request, we'll take now. You just have a
[17:56] need you just want to lift up. Hold that
[17:57] hand up before the Lord. Maybe something
[17:59] upon your heart you want the Lord to
[18:01] just remember. Brother Luther, come and
[18:03] take up these things.
[18:05] God bless you.
[18:08] He's actually sweating.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; Sister Melissa is not feeling well this
[18:13] evening. She was having the room was
[18:16] spinning and had a headache [music] all
[18:18] day, sore throat. So, we want to
[18:19] remember her this evening. Um,
[18:23] she was napping when on the couch when I
[18:25] got home and she's usually not doing
[18:26] that. [music] So, we just want to
[18:27] remember her this evening also.
[18:31] Father, we just want to thank you for a
[18:33] place that we can come and set [music]
[18:35] aside, Father, to a sanctuary for you to
[18:39] come and meet with us and us [music] to
[18:41] just set aside things of this world.
[18:45] Present ourselves to you this evening,
[18:47] [music] Father, that we could worship
[18:49] you in spirit and in truth and you would
[18:51] be pleased and you would speak to our
[18:53] hearts and strengthen us this evening,
[18:56] Lord, for the minister breaking the
[18:58] bread of life to us. I pray for him. I
[19:01] pray that you help him. I am expecting
[19:03] and looking for good things, Father.
[19:06] And Lord, as we collect the tithes and
[19:08] offerings, I pray that you have blessed
[19:10] the cheerful giver. We thank you for the
[19:11] bounty that you give us, Lord. There are
[19:14] so many people in this world that are
[19:16] going without tonight. But Father, we're
[19:19] not going without because you've blessed
[19:21] us and you've watched over us. So I just
[19:24] pray for [music] the service, the
[19:25] remaining part, the word that gets
[19:27] broken. Remember sister Melissa this
[19:29] evening, Father, and those requests upon
[19:31] the hearts, Father.
[19:34] Lord, we know that you can move and as
[19:35] the song said, we know that you're here
[19:38] when we call. We thank you for that,
[19:40] Father. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[19:46] Amen. We have brother Matthew Matthew
[19:48] Smith going to be preaching for us
[19:50] tonight. We're just going to sing just
[19:52] for a few more minutes and then then
[19:53] invite our brother to come. Did you come
[19:55] with an expectation you hear from the
[19:57] Lord? Amen. I hope you didn't come just
[19:59] want to see a person and see each other,
[20:02] but we come to see the Lord. How many
[20:04] How many come to see the Lord? Amen. 80%
[20:07] [music] of you. What about the rest of
[20:09] you? 20%. Y'all come to see the Lord
[20:11] Jesus tonight. Let's just worship him.
[20:13] He's worthy. Blessed be

[23:51] We're going to change it up. I'm
[23:53] rejoicing night and day as I walk this
[23:57] [music] pilgrim way for need the words.
[24:01] I need to know them.
[24:07] [music]
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, the secret all is this that the
[24:13] comforter abides. There it is. Oh, he
[24:17] abides. Oh, he abides.
[24:22] He abides. [music]
[24:25] Halleluah. He abides with me.
[24:32] I'm rejoicing [music]
[24:33] night and day as I walk this pilgrim
[24:37] way. For the [music] comforter abides
[24:42] with me.
[24:45] There's [music] no searching for the
[24:47] things of [singing] the world. They've
[24:50] taken wings. Long ago I gave them up
[24:54] [music] and [singing] instantly
[24:58] all my [music] night was turned to day.
[25:02] All my burdens rolled away. For the
[25:05] [music]
[25:06] comforter abides with me. Oh, he abides.
[25:12] He [music] abides.
[25:15] Yes, he does. [music]
[25:19] Halleluah. He abides with me. [music]
[25:25] I'm rejoiceing night and day as I
[25:29] [music] walk the narrow way. For the
[25:33] comforter abides with me. [music]
[25:39] He is with me everywhere
[25:42] and he knows my every [music] care. I'm
[25:46] as happy as a bird and just as free.
[25:50] Here's why. For the spirit has [music]
[25:54] control. Jesus satisfies my soul. For
[25:59] the comforter [music] abides.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; [music]
[26:06] &gt;&gt; might
[26:19] [music]
[26:25] [music]
[26:28] give me that first verse. Once
[26:32] once my heart was full [music] of sin.
[26:35] Once I had no peace within till [music]
[26:39] I heard how Jesus died upon the tree.
[26:46] Then I fell [music]
[26:47] down at his feet and there came a peace
[26:51] so sweet. Now the comforter abides. Sing
[26:56] it church. Oh, [music]
[26:59] he abides.
[27:02] [music]
[27:03] He abides.
[27:04] Hallelujah.
[27:06] Hallelu. [music]
[27:08] He abides with me.
[27:13] I'm rejoicing night [music] and day as I
[27:17] walk the narrow way for the comforter
[27:22] abides
[27:24] with me.
[27:26] Give the Lord a hand clap of praise.
[27:28] [music] He's worthy. Thank you, Jesus.
[27:31] Amen. We're going to turn our hearts now
[27:33] to the word. Are you hungry? Did you
[27:35] come with a hunger in your heart to hear
[27:36] from the Lord? We want our brother
[27:38] Matthew to um just take his liberty.
[27:40] Want to sing that song, Sister Deb? He
[27:42] is our peace that has broken down every
[27:44] wall. [clears throat]
[27:46] Want our brother to take his liberty?
[27:48] You know, Brother Brandham said that we,
[27:50] you operate the gift that God puts in a
[27:53] man's life. How many knows that the
[27:54] prophet taught us that? And so what you
[27:57] get out of the service won't be the
[27:59] fault of the preacher. It also won't be
[28:01] to the credit of the preacher if you get
[28:03] something out of it. It'll be all to the
[28:06] glory of God. How many want to say,
[28:07] "Lord, I want to do my part to pull on
[28:11] the gift of God." Just take brother
[28:13] Matthew right out of his notes. Uh you
[28:15] know, if you need to do if he the Lord
[28:17] needs to do that, he can just come and
[28:18] speak to your heart. [music] Amen.
[28:20] tonight. He is our peace
[28:25] that has broken down every [singing]
[28:30] wall.
[28:33] He is our peace. [music] He is our
[28:38] peace.
[28:41] He is He is our peace.
[28:47] Sing that again now. He is our peace
[28:53] [music]
[28:55] that has broken down
[28:58] every wall.
[29:01] [singing]
[29:02] He is our peace. He [music]
[29:04] is our
[29:08] peace. He is He is Okay, let's sing this
[29:14] [music] with our hands raised. Cast all
[29:16] your cares.
[29:18] So cast [music] all your cares on him
[29:25] for he cares [music] for you.
[29:32] [music] He is our peace.
[29:39] He is
[29:41] our peace.
[29:46] can all your cares
[29:50] on [music] him
[29:53] for he car for you.
[30:00] He [music]
[30:01] is our peace.
[30:08] He is our peace.
[30:14] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[30:17] the Lord this evening. Um,
[30:21] want to
[30:23] maybe turn directly to the Lord in
[30:26] prayer this evening
[30:29] before we read our text. You know,
[30:30] brother Brandham said that we don't have
[30:32] a right to go to the word until we go to
[30:34] the author of the word first. that we
[30:36] can read some text, we can read the
[30:39] word, but without the Lord to provide a
[30:41] divine inspiration and provide a context
[30:42] for what it is that we read, we'd
[30:45] honestly end up in a worse state than
[30:46] where we started.
[30:48] So, we want to turn our hearts to the
[30:50] Lord in prayer.
[30:53] Father, we come before you humbly this
[30:55] evening, Lord. That Father, I would
[31:00] never even dare to stand up here behind
[31:02] this holy desk with some
[31:05] if I thought that it was just something
[31:06] that I'd come up with, some
[31:09] some conjuration of my mind, Lord, that
[31:12] I' I'd crafted or invented,
[31:17] Father. Lord, I would only ever
[31:21] dare to say something if I knew that it
[31:24] was you, Father, that was bringing
[31:27] inspiration that it was your word that I
[31:29] was holding to that I was holding up a
[31:31] standard of your word. That Father, you
[31:34] can speak to the people, speak, edify
[31:37] their hearts, edify their souls. that
[31:39] Lord in this dark and dreadful day with
[31:41] the enemy all around that Father we'd
[31:43] [music] have to cling to your hand to
[31:45] your unchanging and steadfast hand and
[31:48] to your word that cannot change Father
[31:50] for you cannot lie that when you speak
[31:53] Father that it is assurityity that
[31:56] though heavens and earth pass away
[31:58] Father that your word will never fail.
[32:01] So we turn to the word, Father, this
[32:03] evening and ask that you would give us
[32:06] give you would provide the
[32:07] interpretation that Father, you
[32:08] interpret your own word.
[32:11] Father, that you would be pleased to
[32:13] move amongst us this evening and that I
[32:15] could step out of the way that Father
[32:16] I'd have some sort of emotion or feeling
[32:18] or or nerves or whatever it may be that
[32:22] Father that I could step aside. I could
[32:24] get out of the way that Lord you would
[32:27] you would take over. That Father you
[32:28] would speak.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, I'm not a preacher. I never
[32:33] was, never claimed to be. But, Father,
[32:35] you can preach. So, Father, I just want
[32:38] to be a microphone. I just want to be a
[32:41] an an empty vessel, Lord, for [music]
[32:42] your spirit to move through. That
[32:44] Father, your people can pull. Truly,
[32:46] Lord, it is the people who operate that
[32:48] gift. And I am nothing.
[32:51] So, Father, we ask that you would be
[32:53] mindful of your people this evening. be
[32:56] with us in Jesus precious and
[32:59] allsufficient name of the Lord Jesus
[33:01] Christ. Amen.
[33:04] I want to turn this evening
[33:07] for a text and um I apologize if you
[33:12] guys end up hearing some repeats from my
[33:14] Sunday school that I am going to repeat
[33:17] some of it. Um, and uh, for those of you
[33:21] who aren't gonna hear this as a repeat,
[33:24] why aren't you at Sunday school?
[33:28] Um,
[33:30] so you'll so you you all get it one way
[33:32] or the other. Um, so we want to turn to
[33:35] St. John chapter 1 and verse one. Um,
[33:39] I'm sure this is a very very
[33:41] familiar scripture to everybody.
[33:45] Um, in fact, most of what I'm going to
[33:48] say most if not all of what I want to
[33:49] say tonight, what I have in my notes is
[33:51] not particularly
[33:53] it's not a big deep mystery. It's not
[33:55] anything crazy. You're not going to have
[33:57] your minds blown more than likely. Um
[34:00] but
[34:01] um you know when you get a hold of of
[34:04] the concepts of the word you realize
[34:06] just how all-encompassing they are and
[34:08] you can when the Lord does has a simple
[34:10] foundational concept you'll be able to
[34:12] see it run through the entire Bible and
[34:15] everything all of nature all the Bible
[34:17] all of it will will be uh reflecting
[34:20] that. So I want to turn John chapter St.
[34:24] John chapter 1 and verse one. In the
[34:26] beginning was the word, and the word was
[34:28] with God, and the word was God. The same
[34:30] was in the beginning with God. All
[34:32] things were made by him, and without him
[34:34] was not anything made that was made. In
[34:37] him was life, and the life was the light
[34:41] of men. And the light shineth in
[34:43] darkness, and the darkness comprehended
[34:45] it not.
[34:47] The Lord have added the blessing to the
[34:49] word. You all can be seated. I'm sure
[34:51] we're done with the instruments. We
[34:53] thank the Lord for our musicians.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Um,
[34:59] did you guys in the sound booth, I know
[35:01] I sent y'all that WhatsApp very late.
[35:04] Did you all get that video? I don't know
[35:05] if you can pull it from the WhatsApp. If
[35:07] you will send me the sound booth email,
[35:10] I can try to email it to you. Do you got
[35:12] it? No. But you have the link. Sorry.
[35:16] I'm I I'm I'm failing my sound booth
[35:20] crew. I've uh committed cardinal sins um
[35:24] and not and not uh not given them enough
[35:27] heads up. Um I think I also probably
[35:29] missed a title as well. Um so my my
[35:32] title my title uh for this evening is um
[35:37] I don't know what part it would be
[35:38] anymore. Um but I title my Sunday school
[35:41] the kind of series I've been doing is
[35:42] why are we here? And I guess um we can
[35:46] just make this the next part. I guess
[35:48] it's part eight, I think. Um, and for
[35:52] though, like I said, for those of you
[35:54] who haven't heard the Sunday school, um,
[35:56] the where I got that title is, you know,
[35:59] we we noticed that, you know, we
[36:01] obviously we're all here both on the
[36:03] earth, but in sort of like maybe some
[36:05] grand cosmic sense of like why are we
[36:06] here? Why are why is humanity on the
[36:08] earth? What's the point of all this? But
[36:10] also, why are we these people in this
[36:12] building right now?
[36:14] Um, and really if you get into it and
[36:17] really understand the answer to that
[36:19] question, you realize that
[36:22] um, the answer is the same for both of
[36:24] those questions. Why we are on the earth
[36:25] and why we are in this building is kind
[36:27] of the same answer. Um, and it's that
[36:31] God wanted a family, right? God, the the
[36:35] creator of heavens of earth, um, was
[36:37] alone before creation and he needed to
[36:40] express himself. He needed he had all
[36:42] these things inside of him that needed
[36:43] to come out. And so he expressed himself
[36:45] in the form of a family.
[36:47] And you know, brother Brandham and for
[36:50] the sake of not rehashing, you know,
[36:52] seven, eight parts of a Sunday school,
[36:54] um I will make some references and not
[36:56] uh on some of this stuff and not
[36:57] necessarily give you citations, but I've
[36:59] read it all in my Sunday schools. Um if
[37:01] you don't believe me um we have
[37:04] recordings
[37:05] but you know brother Brandham said and
[37:07] when I um at in I believe was Christ the
[37:11] mystery of God revealed he said that the
[37:13] the point the purpose of the of the
[37:16] entire Bible was the expression was a
[37:20] three-fold purpose for the entire Bible
[37:22] and it all boils down to God having a
[37:24] family that God having a bride and a and
[37:26] children and that he could be made full
[37:28] like he have a fullness in his family.
[37:31] It's why he has a made a garden of Eden
[37:33] and put his children in it that he could
[37:34] be a father and that he could come down
[37:37] in the cool of evening and have unity
[37:38] with his family. And so because of that,
[37:43] because if that's the whole point of the
[37:46] Bible, right, that that that family and
[37:48] the uni and the united family is the
[37:50] whole point of the Bible, it's really
[37:53] really behooves us to pay very close
[37:55] attention to how we organize our
[37:57] families, the structure of our families,
[37:59] how we conduct ourselves within the
[38:01] family, how husbands treat their wives,
[38:02] how wives treat their husbands, how
[38:04] parents treat children, and how children
[38:06] treat parents. These are all core
[38:08] fundamental concepts that are not a side
[38:11] note to the message.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; They are kind of the whole message,
[38:17] &gt;&gt; right? They're right through the middle
[38:18] of the whole thing. You can't separate
[38:20] one from the other, right?
[38:23] Um,
[38:25] okay. Yeah, that looks like the video.
[38:27] Um, you all can hang off and I'll give
[38:30] you a thumbs up when we're ready for
[38:31] that. Thank you. Um, so anyways, um, I
[38:36] want to there's three concepts that I'm
[38:37] going to deal with tonight. Um, Lord
[38:40] willing. And it's I'm not really
[38:42] necessarily I'll make reference to these
[38:44] and I I'm going to say it off on the
[38:46] three bullet points right on the front
[38:47] end so that y'all can have them in your
[38:49] mind. So as I go through my material,
[38:51] you can refer back to them in your mind
[38:53] and you'll kind of have these concepts.
[38:56] Uh, these are my my themes that are
[38:58] going to be kind of recurring hopefully.
[39:01] The first is that the natural types the
[39:03] spiritual which is the same as saying
[39:05] the spiritual determines the natural.
[39:06] The hand determines the shape of the
[39:09] shadow. Right? If I hold my hand up to
[39:10] the light, it casts a shadow. My hand
[39:12] determines the shape of the shadow. The
[39:14] shadow does not determine the shape of
[39:16] my hand. Right? The natural is a shadow
[39:20] of what's the natural world. Everything
[39:21] you see around you, your life and
[39:23] lifestyle and the world that you live in
[39:25] is a shadow of what's going on in a
[39:27] spiritual realm. Okay? and and what's
[39:30] going on in the spiritual realm is
[39:31] absolutely determining what we are is
[39:34] around us. Now
[39:36] the second is the purpose of the entire
[39:39] Bible and the plan of redemption is for
[39:41] God to have a united family. Therefore
[39:43] the family and the family structure is
[39:44] not coincidental to the plan of
[39:46] redemption. It is the core of it. Okay.
[39:49] Thirdly, the spoken word is the original
[39:51] seed and the serpent's seed is the
[39:53] devil's alternative. The two are always
[39:57] found close together. Okay. The devil's
[40:00] alternative, the devil is trying to
[40:04] poison you.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Okay. The devil is not go he's he's
[40:08] trying to to give you his toxic
[40:11] alternative. Now, he's always going to
[40:13] be close, very, very close to God's
[40:17] provided way, right? He's always going
[40:19] to be very close to that. Listen, if
[40:21] you're an assassin and you're trying to
[40:24] poison someone, you're not going to try
[40:26] to hide the cyanide in a, you know,
[40:28] rotten Snickers bar that's been run over
[40:30] in the street.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; No one's That's not tempting to anybody,
[40:34] right? No one's going to go for that.
[40:37] You go No, you put it in a in a steak
[40:39] dinner, right? You you make the
[40:41] delicious steak dinner and it's got the
[40:43] the the grilled vegetables and the
[40:44] mashed potatoes and the steak and and
[40:48] you know and it's and it's all put
[40:49] together and it smells so delicious and
[40:51] it's very nourishing and it's part of a
[40:52] well- balanced diet and there's all the
[40:54] vitamins and the vegetables and the
[40:56] minerals and the and the fats and the
[40:58] proteins and it's a well- balanced diet
[41:00] and it's very nourishing to the body.
[41:05] will kill you
[41:08] dead to doornail,
[41:09] &gt;&gt; right? Because there's no matter how
[41:12] good it may be, that tiny 1%. You
[41:15] haven't realized how small of amount of
[41:17] cyanide it takes to kill someone, it's a
[41:20] very, very small amount. Okay? We're
[41:22] talking like less than 1% of the volume
[41:26] of the dinner is poison
[41:29] and it will kill you. Okay? Satan's
[41:33] alternative is going to smell delicious.
[41:35] It's going to look delicious. It's going
[41:37] to feed parts of your of your spirit.
[41:40] It's going to feed a hunger that you
[41:42] might not even know you had,
[41:44] &gt;&gt; right? It's going to sound just like the
[41:47] real deal. And it will kill you.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[41:53] So
[41:55] I want to, you know, move on here and
[41:58] and and just uh notice that um referring
[42:04] back to my text in the beginning uh was
[42:07] the word and the word was with God and
[42:10] the word was God. Now this is the text
[42:12] that brother Ram took for spoken word's
[42:13] original seed. Um and that word right
[42:17] the word word means it's a Greek word
[42:20] actually that would translate to the
[42:22] Greek as logos. We are all familiar with
[42:23] this, I hope. Um, and the logos, right?
[42:27] It it in in if you were back in the day
[42:30] and you were familiar with the Greeks
[42:31] and you were back when this was, you
[42:32] know, pinned and you understood the
[42:34] Greek, you recognize that the that the
[42:36] word logos refers to what the Greeks
[42:40] refer to as the divine word of creation,
[42:43] right? That when you speak the logos, it
[42:46] makes reality come into being.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Okay? So that's why brother Brandham
[42:51] took that that brother Brandham caught
[42:52] that and said wait a minute when it says
[42:54] logos here it's refer like that's why
[42:58] John's using that Greek word right it's
[42:59] referring to something that the Greeks
[43:01] would under a concept the Greeks would
[43:02] have understood that when God speaks he
[43:04] speaks with logos speaks with a divine
[43:06] word of creation incidentally this is
[43:09] why God cannot lie right we know that
[43:12] God you know would swear by himself why
[43:15] because God cannot lie why cannot can
[43:17] God not lie
[43:19] Right. It's not because you know if or
[43:22] you know and I I not I feel like you
[43:25] know I've always heard this scripture
[43:26] growing up as a kid and I always thought
[43:28] was like you know you know God would
[43:30] have um you know some some if you took
[43:32] some object right like the label on this
[43:34] bottle is white and God would be unable
[43:38] to say it was any other color right it's
[43:40] not that God can't say some fact that he
[43:43] knows is not factually accurate. That's
[43:46] I don't think that's what that scripture
[43:47] means necessarily, right? I don't think
[43:50] it is true that God can say something
[43:52] factually inaccurate.
[43:54] I don't think God can lie in that sense
[43:55] either. But I think the deeper meaning
[43:57] there is that when because God speaks
[43:59] with creative power, if God said this
[44:01] label is black,
[44:03] &gt;&gt; it'll be black,
[44:06] &gt;&gt; right? He can't lie because when he says
[44:08] it, it happens.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; No matter what the situation is,
[44:12] &gt;&gt; reality just conforms to what he says.
[44:14] He couldn't lie if he wanted to,
[44:17] &gt;&gt; right? He just it just happens. So, you
[44:21] know, the this So, when God's Oh, thank
[44:25] you, brother. I have a water, but I
[44:27] appreciate it. Um or is that that one's
[44:30] for you?
[44:34] Um I guess he gets thirsty, too. Um,
[44:38] so, uh, anyhow, so when God speaks, it's
[44:43] notable that brother Brandon would type
[44:44] that spoken word as a seed. If you know
[44:46] what a seed is, a seed is a little
[44:49] mechanism, right? There's inside of that
[44:52] little package. It's a little little
[44:54] envelope that has DNA inside of it. DNA
[44:57] is literally written instructions on how
[45:00] to build whatever it is that that seed
[45:02] is going to make, right? Whatever life
[45:03] form is going to come out of that seed,
[45:04] there is written instructions on how to
[45:06] do it in the form of DNA.
[45:09] It's actually genuinely probably the
[45:13] absolute best
[45:16] um actual evidence of an intelligent
[45:19] creator because how in the world does a
[45:21] written language just spontaneously
[45:23] become out of nothing? It doesn't
[45:25] happen. It is it is it is the spoken
[45:28] word in physical condensated form.
[45:32] Right? It is intelligence written in
[45:35] reality
[45:36] &gt;&gt; and
[45:38] inside. So that little genetic package
[45:40] &gt;&gt; and it's got some little mechanisms in
[45:42] there so that when those little
[45:44] mechanisms detect that this seed has
[45:46] come into the correct environment that
[45:48] the life form can come forth it just
[45:51] activates. It starts opening that little
[45:53] word the little seed up all the
[45:55] instructions and then it just becomes
[45:57] and unfolds and it becomes a life. Okay.
[46:00] Amen.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; If I could get that video up now,
[46:03] please. Um, now in humans, right, we
[46:07] have
[46:09] right there's a male side and a female
[46:11] side and those two things come together.
[46:13] Just hold because it's very short and
[46:15] and I want to give some preamble first.
[46:16] So the um when the when the the the
[46:22] we all all know there's you know many
[46:24] many male seed and there's one female
[46:26] seed and they're all you know
[46:27] traditionally we've all kind of been
[46:28] taught that it's a it's a race, right?
[46:29] Right? It's just whichever one gets
[46:30] there first.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; It's not exactly accurate. Um it's more
[46:35] accurate to say that the female chooses
[46:37] the male one and then releases chemicals
[46:40] that repel all the wrong ones.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Right? That's how that works. And it's
[46:46] actually because there's and it's based
[46:48] off of genetic compatibility that the
[46:50] DNA the genetics inside the deep there's
[46:53] something deep down inside that little
[46:55] female
[46:56] that recognizes something inside that.
[46:58] There's a deep calling to a deep here.
[47:00] There's something genetic over there and
[47:02] something genetic over here. There's a
[47:03] seed here and a seed there. And those
[47:05] two things have to be compatible. And if
[47:07] this one doesn't agree with this one,
[47:09] well, it's not going to be accepted. And
[47:10] it's not right. And so, and so they're
[47:13] never going to connect and they're never
[47:14] going to make life.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; And so that se so the female it it
[47:18] accepts the male and it allows them to
[47:20] come in contact. When it does, when that
[47:22] male comes in contact with the female,
[47:24] the the the on the cellular level,
[47:28] the female hardens, it calcifies. It
[47:32] hardens and it seals itself. Right? This
[47:35] is why
[47:36] &gt;&gt; this is the type, the natural typing is
[47:38] spiritual.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; When you receive the new birth and your
[47:41] heartens to the devil,
[47:44] &gt;&gt; right? It seals you into the day of your
[47:46] redemption,
[47:47] &gt;&gt; right? You're you you received a seed
[47:49] from God and now there's life coming
[47:52] forth and it and it it locks out any all
[47:55] because listen there's 40,000 different
[47:58] compet competitors for the true seed of
[48:00] God,
[48:01] &gt;&gt; right? There's 40,000 different options,
[48:04] but only the true predestinated one is
[48:06] going to react to a true predestinated
[48:09] &gt;&gt; the true predestinated bride. And so and
[48:11] when you come in contact with that, it
[48:13] you it hardens and it seals it out. Now
[48:15] the other thing that happens, brother
[48:17] Brandham says this over and over and
[48:18] over again in the message talks about
[48:20] when light strikes the seed or or the
[48:23] seed comes together and then the light a
[48:24] light flashes over it. He says this in
[48:27] like the 50s and 60s.
[48:30] This is a this is a video and I think
[48:32] I've played this before some years ago.
[48:34] I think maybe brother Jason has played
[48:35] something similar like this very I think
[48:37] in the 90s they actually got video of
[48:39] it. This is, if you go ahead and play
[48:41] the video,
[48:44] this is from obviously 2016.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; That's video. That's a literal visible
[48:58] to the eyeball light that flashes. It
[49:02] It's It's a reaction with a with zinc
[49:04] and it makes a flash that's actually
[49:06] slowed down so you can see it. If it's
[49:08] run in real time, it's like as fast as a
[49:10] flash bulb on a camera. It pops like
[49:13] it's fireworks,
[49:14] &gt;&gt; okay? God celebrates every baby with
[49:17] fireworks,
[49:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[49:20] &gt;&gt; It and it's it it's like, you know, and
[49:22] so, huh, man, oh, if there's anybody
[49:27] anybody on this earth who thinks that
[49:29] God doesn't care about you, let me tell
[49:31] you, God celebrates every single person
[49:35] with fireworks. I don't care how
[49:37] wretched and miserable you think your
[49:39] life has become and what kind of train
[49:41] wreck you've made that has become of
[49:42] your life. God doesn't think you're a
[49:45] train wreck. God thinks you're worth
[49:46] more than 10,000 worlds. God thinks
[49:48] you're so valuable that the most
[49:51] valuable thing he could think of would
[49:53] be his own blood. And yet that's worth
[49:55] less than you because he paid it for
[49:57] you. You don't listen. If I go to the
[50:00] grocery store and get a a gallon of milk
[50:02] and I hand the, you know, seems like
[50:04] it's like $12 now. Um, if I give the
[50:07] cashier some money, what's worth more to
[50:10] me, the money or the milk? Well, I was
[50:12] willing to part with the milk with the
[50:14] money,
[50:14] &gt;&gt; right? Well, if God's willing to part
[50:16] with his own blood, what's worth more to
[50:20] him?
[50:21] &gt;&gt; What's worth more, the you or the blood?
[50:24] Well, obviously, it's the one that he
[50:26] chose. It's the one that he that he that
[50:28] he refused to part with.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; And so when this when this moment of
[50:36] conception happens and this hardening of
[50:39] the heart happens, you know, this is
[50:41] also, you know, again, it goes both ways
[50:44] because if if you accept Satan's
[50:46] alternative,
[50:47] &gt;&gt; the serpent seed, there's 40,000
[50:50] alternatives. There's there's the
[50:52] devil's gonna have a a million one ways
[50:55] to distract you from the real deal. And
[50:58] if the you know when the Bible talks
[51:00] about brother Jason made this comment
[51:02] the other day and it man it so struck
[51:04] me. You know the Bible talks about God
[51:06] hardening Pharaoh's heart but don't
[51:09] forget that Pharaoh hardened his own
[51:11] heart first
[51:12] &gt;&gt; right? He Pharaoh hardened his own heart
[51:15] first. Why? Because there was something
[51:16] inside of Pharaoh that rec the deep
[51:20] inside of Pharaoh recognized it deep
[51:21] inside of the devil.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; There was a genetic compatibility there.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; And he accepted the false seed. He
[51:29] accepted Satan's lie and it hardened his
[51:32] heart.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; He accepted it and it locked out Moses's
[51:36] message to him.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; And that's what happens. He was he there
[51:41] was something, you know, listen. That's
[51:44] why brother Brandham said people
[51:46] wondering is you know if have I you know
[51:48] gone across the line and he brother
[51:49] Brandham said if there's a desire in
[51:51] your heart there's still a chance
[51:53] &gt;&gt; right there's this desire in your heart
[51:54] to seek after the Lord that's that's
[51:57] that genetic compatibility still
[51:59] reaching for the word
[52:01] &gt;&gt; there's always a chance if there's a
[52:03] desire in your heart you hang on to that
[52:05] and you you you listen to it and you
[52:07] don't just disregard that.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Okay, that's the Lord calling you.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:15] And so,
[52:18] you know, we at the end of the day, all
[52:21] of this comes down to, you know, this is
[52:22] just a very natural type, but it's but
[52:25] it's typing the spiritual side of this,
[52:27] right? That it's the it's not about, you
[52:30] know, little as beautiful as the miracle
[52:33] of life is, but it's about people and
[52:36] what we do and and how we we live our
[52:38] lives. And
[52:40] you know, you you look at at Adam in the
[52:43] garden, you know, where where your heart
[52:45] is, right? That that longing in your
[52:47] heart, that genetic compatibility in
[52:48] your heart is going to is going to
[52:49] determine what you do, right? The
[52:52] spiritual is going to determine the
[52:53] natural. Your your body, your life, and
[52:55] your lifestyle is going to follow what's
[52:57] going on on the inside.
[53:00] And you know, when you look at Adam in
[53:01] the garden and and he sins and God is
[53:04] calling Adam, Adam, where are you? He he
[53:06] Adam or God is not asking Adam what bush
[53:11] he's hiding behind.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; God knows what where you're hiding,
[53:15] &gt;&gt; right? God's not ignorant of where
[53:17] you're at. You know, when you're when
[53:19] you're just some sinner and you're lost
[53:21] and you feel like you your life is in
[53:23] shambles, God knows right where you're
[53:25] at,
[53:27] &gt;&gt; right? You hear the hear the Lord
[53:29] calling, "Hey son, hey daughter, where
[53:32] are you?" He know Yeah. He knows where
[53:35] you're at. It's not a He knows what's
[53:37] going on in your life.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; He's asking you, "Hey, where's your
[53:41] heart?"
[53:43] That's what happened. Adam's heart left
[53:45] the garden. Adam hadn't left, but his
[53:48] heart did. That's why God is looking
[53:50] because he's looking going around the
[53:52] garden. Adam, your heart's not anywhere
[53:53] in here. I could go all over the garden
[53:56] and Adam's heart is anywhere anywhere in
[53:57] the in the garden. So that's what he's
[54:00] asking because God knew that the natural
[54:02] is going to follow the spiritual because
[54:04] Adam's heart left. Adam was going to
[54:07] leave.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it, right? And if
[54:11] your wherever your heart is, whatever
[54:13] has hold of your heart is what's going
[54:15] to have hold of you.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; No matter what kind of like how hard you
[54:19] strain and give yourself a hernia trying
[54:21] to do something different, whatever has
[54:22] your heart is going to have you,
[54:24] &gt;&gt; right? You're going to be you're going
[54:25] to be bound to it. So,
[54:28] you know, the same thing happened with
[54:29] Lot's wife.
[54:31] Lot's wife left Sodom, but Sodom never
[54:34] left her, right? She got out of she got
[54:38] out of Sodom and and what? She couldn't
[54:40] She just couldn't bear to leave it. Had
[54:41] to look over her shoulder, right?
[54:43] Because there was something back there
[54:45] calling for her heart. And you know, and
[54:48] so she never left. She didn't leave the
[54:50] destruction. And so, and you know, I
[54:56] I I really appreciate it and I'll and
[54:58] I'll, you know, Brother Matt um made
[55:00] this statement recently about children
[55:03] of Israel leaving Egypt and how so many
[55:06] people left Egypt and they, you know,
[55:09] and and you know, this is a beautiful
[55:10] type. There's a work of justification.
[55:12] There's a work of sanctification under
[55:14] the law. And then there's a the new
[55:16] birth and going into the promised land,
[55:17] right? Where the brand uses this type a
[55:18] lot. And so many people, many many many
[55:22] people will leave Egypt, right? They'll
[55:25] leave Egypt and they're happy that the
[55:28] Lord saved them from slavery and bondage
[55:30] under whatever addiction that they were
[55:32] fighting or they you know have some
[55:34] whatever shambles that their life was
[55:36] and the Lord saves them from that and
[55:39] you know then they go into some work of
[55:40] sanctification and and that's you know
[55:42] the and that's the law right you know
[55:44] Moses children of Israel received the
[55:46] law and that kind of gives them some
[55:48] instructions on how to live right and so
[55:49] they do some sanctifica you know and
[55:50] they just kind of mill around in these
[55:52] varying degrees of sanctification for 40
[55:55] And they never really give God their
[55:58] heart,
[55:59] &gt;&gt; right? Because,
[56:02] you know, they left Egypt, but Egypt
[56:05] never left them. They were always
[56:07] wondering what could have been if they
[56:10] would have just hung on to the the
[56:11] onions and garlics and, you know, was
[56:14] Pharaoh that bad really, you know, and
[56:18] it's and you know, me, you know, people
[56:20] Christians do this. They'll they'll they
[56:23] recognize that where they're at with
[56:25] with with
[56:27] Pharaoh is so miserable. They have some
[56:29] addiction in their life. They have some
[56:31] miserable calamity in their life. They
[56:33] have, you know, everyone's so many
[56:36] people will leave the message right up
[56:38] until their dad gets cancer and now
[56:41] suddenly they know who to call, right?
[56:43] And it's not a, you know, that's look,
[56:45] the Lord knows how to get rid, you know,
[56:46] get a hold of you. You know, the Lord
[56:48] knows how to set your barns on fire.
[56:50] Don't don't get me wrong. And that can
[56:51] be good, but you know, it's people so
[56:54] many times people don't want the Lord
[56:56] until they really need the Lord,
[56:59] &gt;&gt; right? And then and so the Lord will
[57:01] deliver them from, you know, and then
[57:03] and they the problem is they're really
[57:05] not sad that they sinned. They're not
[57:09] sad that they were in Egypt. They're
[57:11] just sort of sad of the consequences.
[57:13] They just wish Pharaoh wasn't such a
[57:14] jerk, right? They really liked living in
[57:18] Egypt, actually. They really liked the
[57:20] lifestyle they had there. It's just,
[57:21] man, Pharaoh was so mean, you know, and
[57:25] it's, you know, I really like the I
[57:27] really like my lifestyle, but man, the
[57:29] hangover on Monday is rough, right? I
[57:32] really like my lifestyle, but you know,
[57:36] uh, you know what? You know, you know,
[57:39] it's breaking you down. And so, you you
[57:41] leave, you you get justified. you, you
[57:43] know, you kind of come to church and you
[57:44] clean yourself up and you get some you
[57:46] get some law. You get a list of dos and
[57:48] don'ts from the church, right? You get a
[57:50] law. You get a law that says, "Thou
[57:52] shalt not smoke and thou shalt not drink
[57:54] and thou shalt not watch pornography.
[57:57] Thou shalt not cuss and thou shalt not
[57:59] cut your hair and wear pants if you're a
[58:02] lady." And we all and you know this is
[58:04] it's a list of dos and don'ts and it's a
[58:06] lot of thou shalt nots and thou shalts
[58:09] and
[58:11] you know you can sit there and you can
[58:14] mill around in that for 40 years and you
[58:17] will have never left Egypt actually
[58:20] because Egypt never left your heart.
[58:22] You're always just looking over your
[58:24] shoulder going, "Man, I just I liked my
[58:27] lifestyle. I just wish the hangover
[58:30] wasn't so rough."
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[58:33] And
[58:35] you know that's legalism. It's it's dos
[58:39] and don'ts. It's
[58:42] it's just the problem, you know, because
[58:44] the problem with legalism is that it's
[58:46] it's actually, you know, we have this
[58:47] idea that it's hyperrestrictive, right?
[58:50] Like it's it's you know, thou do you
[58:52] wicked person, thou shalt not, and I'm
[58:54] going to be all up in all of your
[58:56] business and and every little aspect of
[58:58] your life is going to be controlled and
[58:59] and and a lot of times it does turn into
[59:01] that, right? You can get like very
[59:03] legalistic type people who every little
[59:06] thing, every every time your shoes are
[59:07] untied, it's a condemnation. And you
[59:11] know, um
[59:14] [sighs and gasps] the reality is um
[59:17] Pharisees
[59:19] are lawyers.
[59:21] Lawyers
[59:22] know how to break the law.
[59:25] Okay? Or rather, lawyers know how to
[59:27] manipulate the law. Right?
[59:29] &gt;&gt; And so what happens is, you know,
[59:31] Pharisees, Pharisees are like the
[59:33] champion of legalism, right? No, you
[59:35] know, you think of a real legalist, you
[59:37] think of a Pharisee. And so Pharisees
[59:39] are the kind of people who are like, you
[59:40] know, on on Sabbath. And I and I did
[59:42] some research on this because it blew my
[59:43] mind when I heard this. You know, the
[59:45] Pharisees are the kind of people who are
[59:46] like, you know, on the Sabbath, you
[59:47] know, you shall do no work on the
[59:49] Sabbath day. And that includes I
[59:51] listened to a rabbi this today actually
[59:54] do some talking about this and the rabbi
[59:56] said that biblically they're allow so
[59:58] hang on let me back up. So on the
[1:00:00] Sabbath day uh a lot of Jews if they
[1:00:03] leave their home are
[1:00:06] under their law are prohibited to even
[1:00:08] carry car keys or push a baby in a
[1:00:11] stroller
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; because that's work. That's the level of
[1:00:16] thou shalt not work on the Sabbath day.
[1:00:18] That's the level that they take it to,
[1:00:20] right? Like that's kind of oppressive,
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; right? You can't even can't even push
[1:00:25] your baby in a stroller. Like that's
[1:00:27] work. I don't think it's work, right?
[1:00:29] You got an easy job if you think that's
[1:00:30] work.
[1:00:32] Um
[1:00:33] and
[1:00:35] and so, you know, that's the level they
[1:00:37] would take it to. Can't even carry
[1:00:38] something in your pocket. You keep, you
[1:00:40] know, your car keys can't you wallet in
[1:00:41] your pocket is is too heavy and to be,
[1:00:44] you know, and now it's considered work.
[1:00:46] And this rabbi, he was talking about
[1:00:47] this. He goes, "Yeah." So, actually,
[1:00:48] biblically, that's not prohibited, but
[1:00:51] rabbitically under under the law of the
[1:00:53] rabbis it is, right? So, they've taken
[1:00:56] the the, you know, the law of the Bible
[1:00:58] and gone way over here with it, right?
[1:01:00] Way more extreme. And so, here they are
[1:01:03] hyper extreme with what they can do.
[1:01:06] And then the whole reason is because
[1:01:08] there's this there's this concept, if I
[1:01:10] have it in my notes, because there's
[1:01:11] it's a Jewish word. Where'd it go?
[1:01:13] Where'd it go?
[1:01:16] Uh
[1:01:23] um I believe it's pronounced the Arav.
[1:01:26] It's E R UV if anyone wants to look this
[1:01:29] up if you don't believe me. So what they
[1:01:31] you see this in big cities like New York
[1:01:34] where there's large Jewish populations
[1:01:35] and they'll have their Jewish community
[1:01:37] and what they will do is they will take
[1:01:40] some fishing line and they will connect
[1:01:43] fishing line all around like a whole
[1:01:45] city block all the way this huge section
[1:01:49] of the city that goes out of their
[1:01:50] house. is way outside the house, the big
[1:01:52] old section of the city. And because the
[1:01:54] way it's connected and it connects back
[1:01:56] to their house legally speaking,
[1:02:00] everything inside that fishing line is
[1:02:02] part of their house.
[1:02:05] No joke, no lie. That's what it means.
[1:02:07] And so that means they can do all the
[1:02:09] stuff that they're prohibited from doing
[1:02:10] on the Sabbath day inside the fishing
[1:02:12] string.
[1:02:15] Like fool, God, what? No, that's not how
[1:02:18] that works. You didn't find a loophole,
[1:02:21] right? You didn't fool God with a
[1:02:23] fishing line because you think you found
[1:02:25] some loophole because God's judging your
[1:02:27] heart and your heart is saying, "I don't
[1:02:30] really want to follow the law, but I
[1:02:31] feel like I kind of got to. So, I'm
[1:02:32] going to I'm going to go find some edge
[1:02:34] case and just push it to its absolute
[1:02:36] limit so that I can just do whatever I
[1:02:38] want anyways." That's what legalism
[1:02:41] does. And you'll find this half the time
[1:02:43] when someone's hyper legalistic,
[1:02:46] you start looking long enough and you'll
[1:02:48] find some they'll have some fishing line
[1:02:50] around some big stuff,
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; right? Like this is wild what people
[1:02:54] will do and then and then have all kinds
[1:02:56] of justifications for it, right? I have
[1:02:59] all kinds of reasons why their
[1:03:00] particular quote that they've like, you
[1:03:03] know, taken a a a razor blade and carved
[1:03:06] out all the context out of this quote
[1:03:08] and presented that or some scripture or
[1:03:11] whatever. And it's like, guys, I really
[1:03:14] feel like you're you're kind of missing
[1:03:16] the spirit of what's going on here,
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; you know? Like, look, we say in the
[1:03:21] message all the time that the that the
[1:03:23] the the holiness standard, the Christian
[1:03:25] experience is not a list of dos and
[1:03:27] don'ts. We say that all the time. Okay.
[1:03:29] Now,
[1:03:31] it's not a list of dos and don'ts.
[1:03:32] That's true. That's accurate 100%.
[1:03:35] But that doesn't mean that it's there
[1:03:38] aren't dos and don'ts,
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:42] Similarly to a marriage, right? Remember
[1:03:44] this whole thing is a pattern of a
[1:03:46] family. The relationship with Christ in
[1:03:47] the church is the same as a husband and
[1:03:49] a wife. And if me and my wife who I love
[1:03:53] very very much on our wedding day got
[1:03:56] the lawyers together to put together a
[1:03:58] you know our legal obligations to the
[1:04:00] marriage and you know these are my you
[1:04:02] know salary obligations and I'm going to
[1:04:04] pay for so many vacations a year and
[1:04:06] give her so much shopping money and and
[1:04:08] you know there's all the you know breach
[1:04:09] of contract clauses and then you know
[1:04:11] she's going to clean the house and the
[1:04:14] kids take care of the kids and cook me
[1:04:17] hot dinner as soon as I get home and all
[1:04:18] these different things.
[1:04:20] and we're putting this into some sort of
[1:04:21] legal contract. I really feel like maybe
[1:04:23] we oughtn't get married because there's
[1:04:25] no heart there. You're you're
[1:04:27] condensing. And the problem is if you
[1:04:30] try to condense all the infinite ways
[1:04:33] y'all are going to get on each other's
[1:04:34] nerves into a legal document, I
[1:04:37] guarantee you there's going to be a
[1:04:38] whole lot of stuff not on that list. I
[1:04:41] guarantee there's going to be a lot of
[1:04:43] stuff not on the list of dos and don'ts.
[1:04:44] And when you get a legalist and they
[1:04:46] find something not on the list, boy
[1:04:48] howdy, they're going to swing for the
[1:04:49] fences,
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; right? You have And so if you try to
[1:04:54] condense a marriage down to a a formal
[1:04:56] contract, the minute you get a an edge
[1:04:59] case that can't that there's no guidance
[1:05:01] on, man, you're really going to stick it
[1:05:03] to that other person,
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; right? Because there ain't nothing on
[1:05:06] the list. I can do what I want now.
[1:05:08] Well, hang on. If I love my wife, I
[1:05:12] don't need a list. I don't need to be
[1:05:15] told these things because I care about
[1:05:16] her and I might get some stuff wrong. I
[1:05:18] might even have to apologize for some
[1:05:21] stuff, which I do on a regular basis.
[1:05:23] However, I'm motivated to do that. I'm
[1:05:27] motivated to apologize. I don't need a
[1:05:30] list because everyone's going to do
[1:05:32] things wrong. The the the the law,
[1:05:33] you'll never never actually live up to
[1:05:35] the law. And you know, and like you you
[1:05:40] I'll give you here's a kind of a crazy
[1:05:41] example, a ludicrous illustration,
[1:05:43] right? If if you have if you're just
[1:05:46] breaking a marriage down to a list of
[1:05:48] thou shalt not
[1:05:50] and you know and and thou shalt not
[1:05:52] commit adultery and then you have say
[1:05:54] you have imagine some woman being like
[1:05:56] well thou shalt not commit adultery but
[1:05:58] there's this other man that is very
[1:06:00] handsome and he buys me dinner and we go
[1:06:02] on long walks to the beach and he buys
[1:06:04] me flowers and tells me how beautiful I
[1:06:05] am but we've never technically committed
[1:06:09] adultery.
[1:06:11] Okay.
[1:06:13] technically, but that seems really
[1:06:16] adulterous,
[1:06:17] right?
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; It seems really wrong is obviously you
[1:06:20] your heart's checked out of your
[1:06:22] marriage. Your heart, your husband
[1:06:24] doesn't have your heart. This other man
[1:06:25] does and then
[1:06:29] you tell go fly a kite. You won't have
[1:06:31] anything to do with him, right?
[1:06:34] And so, you know, this is what happens
[1:06:37] when you get young people who are like,
[1:06:40] "Well, you know, I don't cut my hair. I
[1:06:43] burn it off with a curling iron."
[1:06:45] Well, that just shows you that you don't
[1:06:49] have the Holy Ghost, teenager.
[1:06:52] You know, well, you know, I have this
[1:06:55] reason why I can put makeup on my face.
[1:06:58] Well, okay. Go ask look at what brother
[1:07:00] Brandham said about having putting
[1:07:02] makeup on your face and tell me if you
[1:07:04] got the Holy Ghost and you can try to
[1:07:05] wiggle around that all you want to
[1:07:07] sister but um you know I think maybe
[1:07:10] you're just trying to wrap some string
[1:07:11] around that
[1:07:13] you know hey young man you know brother
[1:07:16] Brandham had a lot of really
[1:07:18] uncomfortable things to say about the
[1:07:20] way you cut your hair and you can sit
[1:07:22] there and say well you know brother
[1:07:23] Bandom used the Beatles as an example
[1:07:24] and their hair was you know 3/4 of an
[1:07:26] inch above their eyebrows and mine is a
[1:07:28] full inch and that makes me different.
[1:07:30] Really? Are you sure?
[1:07:34] Or are you just trying to wrap some
[1:07:36] string around it?
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Are you just trying to wrap some string
[1:07:41] around it? Maybe you should just lay the
[1:07:43] string down and admit that you have a
[1:07:45] problem.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Maybe you should lay the string down and
[1:07:48] say, "Lord, I you I have not given you
[1:07:51] my heart."
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; You know, I maybe that's what's going on
[1:07:55] here. Because you can think that you
[1:07:58] have the Holy Ghost a lot. And and the
[1:08:00] problem is, you know,
[1:08:06] I I'm going to I'm going to read some
[1:08:08] quotes here just because I feel like
[1:08:10] maybe someone might not believe me.
[1:08:14] This is from Perseverance.
[1:08:16] It says, "We believe God by faith
[1:08:18] because God said so." Then what is it?
[1:08:21] Abraham was justified by Paul by faith,
[1:08:24] but by James by works. Abraham was
[1:08:27] talking what God saw and James was
[1:08:29] talking about what man saw. Show me your
[1:08:32] faith
[1:08:34] by your works.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Then if you don't have works with your
[1:08:39] faith, it shows you haven't got faith.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; You're just talking from your mouth. But
[1:08:45] if you really got faith, you believe it
[1:08:48] and you act like it. Right?
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; This is from presuming. But you say,
[1:08:54] "Well, I dance in the spirit. I spoke
[1:08:55] with tongues. I might have done uh I
[1:08:58] might have done these things." That's
[1:08:59] fine. Yes, sir. That's all right. But if
[1:09:01] that life hasn't straightened up, if you
[1:09:04] men still smoke cigarettes, tell jokes,
[1:09:06] take sociable drinks, lie, cheat, not
[1:09:09] honest with your neighbor,
[1:09:11] you know, you you you men who are out
[1:09:15] there doing work in the in the world, if
[1:09:18] you are lying to your customers,
[1:09:21] you might want to go find an author. If
[1:09:24] you are if you are doing if you are not
[1:09:27] a 100% clear with the and and upfront
[1:09:29] and honest in your business dealings,
[1:09:32] you might need to go find an author.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Not even honest with your family.
[1:09:39] If you if you have one standard that
[1:09:41] you're living, dads, fathers, husbands,
[1:09:45] if you have one standard that you live
[1:09:47] in front of your family and a different
[1:09:48] standard that you live when they're not
[1:09:50] around,
[1:09:52] uh you might need to go find an altar.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; You might have a problem. You might just
[1:09:58] be putting on a front. Go listen to the
[1:10:01] message Pride. Brother Brandham says
[1:10:02] that a Pharisee is an actor. That's what
[1:10:05] he is. And if you're putting on a show
[1:10:08] for somebody that your Christian
[1:10:10] experience is one way in public and a
[1:10:12] different way in private, maybe you're a
[1:10:15] Pharisee and you need to stop cut the
[1:10:16] string out of your life.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Lay that stuff down and be genuine.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Go let get the let the Lord deal with
[1:10:24] your heart because something's wrong.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; He says, uh, honest with your neighbor,
[1:10:30] not even honest with your family. See,
[1:10:32] and claim to have the Holy Ghost. Don't
[1:10:35] you testify that no more, brother.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Right? Because that's what he's talking
[1:10:40] about. People claiming to have the Holy
[1:10:42] Ghost and they ain't got the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:44] [snorts] Claim to have the Holy Ghost,
[1:10:45] but
[1:10:47] uh maybe you don't. And if you claim to
[1:10:49] have the Holy Ghost and you don't, God
[1:10:51] will judge you as if you do. There won't
[1:10:54] be grace for that for the things. You
[1:10:56] know, you see what I'm saying? You claim
[1:10:57] to be something you're not. And God will
[1:10:59] judge you based off of your testimony.
[1:11:03] This is also from presuming. Um, and you
[1:11:06] women that hasn't the common decency to
[1:11:08] let your hair grow out like God told you
[1:11:10] to. In case anybody was wondering about
[1:11:12] a curling iron, he just said grow your
[1:11:14] hair out. Didn't say anything about
[1:11:15] scissors. That's right. The Bible says
[1:11:17] that a woman that will bob her hair
[1:11:20] dishonors her head and that dishonors
[1:11:22] her husband. And you that will wear
[1:11:24] these little old garments like the rest
[1:11:25] of the world wears. The Bible says that
[1:11:28] he a woman that will put on a garment
[1:11:30] that pertains to a man is an
[1:11:31] abomination, filthy in the sight of God.
[1:11:33] And then you claim to have the Holy
[1:11:35] Ghost.
[1:11:36] You're presuming you've got it, but when
[1:11:39] you get it, it cleans you up. That's
[1:11:41] right. It makes you different. You that
[1:11:44] claim you have the Holy Ghost and you
[1:11:46] that's got long hair. Now, now notice
[1:11:48] you that claim Now he's So, he's just
[1:11:50] talked to the woman who got short hair
[1:11:52] and makeup and all these other things.
[1:11:53] Now, he's talking to this the woman
[1:11:55] that's got long hair. You that claim you
[1:11:57] have the Holy Ghost. and you that's got
[1:12:00] long hair and wear your dresses neat and
[1:12:03] everything like that and you'll stay
[1:12:06] home on Wednesday night to watch a
[1:12:07] program, a television program instead of
[1:12:10] going to church to prayer meeting.
[1:12:13] You're presuming you got the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:16] For when the Holy Ghost is there, the
[1:12:18] love of God is so constrained in you
[1:12:21] that you just can't stay away from those
[1:12:24] people. you that has to be forced to
[1:12:28] prayer and he just kind of trails off
[1:12:30] dot dot dot you know you that's got to
[1:12:34] be forced to pray I don't know about you
[1:12:38] know and so I would just as a bullet
[1:12:41] point in my notes
[1:12:43] you are not saved by your works this is
[1:12:45] obvious like in case you were didn't
[1:12:48] catch this is not me this is not the
[1:12:50] brother brand I'm speaking this is me
[1:12:52] you are not saved by your works and your
[1:12:54] works are not the evidence that you
[1:12:56] positively do have the new birth.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; However, a life of sin and ungodliness,
[1:13:02] a lack of dedication and sincerity is a
[1:13:04] pretty good indication that you do not
[1:13:06] have the new birth.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Okay? Evidence that you do and evidence
[1:13:10] that you do not are not the same thing.
[1:13:14] Okay? A Pharisee can put on a show only
[1:13:17] God knows his heart. But you're not
[1:13:20] going to convince me or Brother Brandham
[1:13:23] that you can just go live any old kind
[1:13:25] of way and be like, "Well, I believe in
[1:13:27] my heart and my faith will save me."
[1:13:30] Your repentance
[1:13:32] may if you repent and repent, be
[1:13:36] baptized, and accept the new birth, then
[1:13:38] yes. But if you're just out there living
[1:13:40] any old kind of way and you're just
[1:13:42] disregarding the standards of holiness,
[1:13:44] well, man, I don't know that you've got
[1:13:46] you've passed from death unto life
[1:13:47] because if you love God, you'll keep his
[1:13:49] commandments,
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; It shows if you're out here finding edge
[1:13:54] cases, if you're out here running for
[1:13:57] just searching for loopholes so you can
[1:13:59] cram whatever you want into your
[1:14:01] lifestyle, I don't know that you really
[1:14:04] h have a love for God in your heart. The
[1:14:08] same way that if I'm out here looking
[1:14:10] for any excuse to go flirt with another
[1:14:12] woman, I don't have a good marriage,
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; right? Clearly, this is the natural
[1:14:19] typing, the spiritual. If you're dead,
[1:14:21] not dedicated to your heavenly husband,
[1:14:24] you don't I'm sorry. I you should really
[1:14:29] question whether or not you have the
[1:14:30] Holy Ghost, you know, and I know that
[1:14:33] that seems harsh, but look, that's
[1:14:37] I would rather say something harsh
[1:14:40] that is accurate and true and be sure in
[1:14:44] what I know and what I believe than to
[1:14:46] go blundering blindly into a bear trap.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Right? It's not.
[1:14:54] Love is kind and love is patient and
[1:14:57] loves a lot of things, but love is not
[1:15:00] so
[1:15:02] soft that it can't have confrontation
[1:15:04] with somebody when that person is going
[1:15:06] down a really bad path.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Okay. If you see little Johnny playing
[1:15:11] in the street and there's a car coming
[1:15:12] and you just go, "Oh, well, you know, I
[1:15:14] don't want to like bother him and you
[1:15:16] know, he's he's living his life and I
[1:15:18] don't want to be seen as some sort of
[1:15:19] fanatic.
[1:15:21] Well,
[1:15:22] you can try to rearrange that as that
[1:15:25] you having love for little Johnny. But
[1:15:27] when little Johnny is splattered over
[1:15:28] the front bumper of that pickup truck,
[1:15:32] uh you didn't love him.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; You condemned him.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; YOU YOU LET HIM DIE CUZ YOU WERE SO
[1:15:41] CHICKENENED. You didn't want to have a
[1:15:43] difficult conversation.
[1:15:45] That's not love to say nothing when
[1:15:47] people are in danger
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; because you don't want to be seen as
[1:15:51] judgmental or or a you know a legalist.
[1:15:55] [sighs]
[1:15:56] It's not listen
[1:15:59] you you
[1:16:01] being so soft that we that we can't or
[1:16:04] or rather being so un uh so so committed
[1:16:09] to niceness that we can't that we
[1:16:12] sacrifice the truth.
[1:16:15] That's not kindness.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; It's not love.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; That's that's that's that's hatred.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; That's actually sophisticated hatred.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; It's a very sophisticated form of hatred
[1:16:28] that gives the hateful plausible
[1:16:30] deniability against their own
[1:16:31] conscience.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; It lets you hate people actually behave
[1:16:36] hatefully towards them and not actually
[1:16:39] let your conscience bother you about it.
[1:16:42] That's the truth.
[1:16:44] And so, you know,
[1:16:46] when somebody says something harsh to
[1:16:49] you and it's said in love, you should
[1:16:51] probably listen,
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; right? That's the most loving thing
[1:16:56] someone can do. Actually, it's one of
[1:16:58] the most loving things because man, it's
[1:17:00] not pleasant to have to be the person to
[1:17:03] say some hard truth. It's really
[1:17:05] difficult actually. Nobody likes it.
[1:17:15] This is from
[1:17:18] This is from God of This Evil Age. And
[1:17:20] Brother Brandham, I don't have the time
[1:17:22] to really read this whole thing. I'd be
[1:17:24] reading half the sermon if I did. But um
[1:17:27] Brother Brandham is kind of going down
[1:17:28] this list. He's he's kind of
[1:17:30] illustrating this point of the the world
[1:17:32] and how the world is being being duped
[1:17:35] and and conned and and and seduced by
[1:17:40] the god of this evil age and how they
[1:17:43] they they they love what he does, right?
[1:17:47] Satan tells them all the things that
[1:17:49] that kind of tickle their ear and and
[1:17:50] and and gives pleasure to their heart,
[1:17:54] right? that they he excuse me gives them
[1:17:57] the justification for all the things
[1:17:58] they want to do. Right?
[1:18:01] So he says
[1:18:04] she can wear shorts, wear paint and
[1:18:05] still belong to his religious group,
[1:18:07] meaning Satan's religious group, which
[1:18:09] is absolutely contrary to the word of
[1:18:11] God. He says it's all right.
[1:18:14] God said not to do it, but he does. And
[1:18:18] she believes him and she loves him for
[1:18:20] it.
[1:18:23] She hates God. Her own actions prove she
[1:18:26] does. She says she loves him, but she
[1:18:28] loves Satan.
[1:18:30] She worships the God of fashion, the God
[1:18:32] of the world, the Hollywood goddesses.
[1:18:35] She loves him, but she hates the true
[1:18:38] word of God, which is the only true word
[1:18:40] there is.
[1:18:42] Skipping down, he says, "Oh, look at him
[1:18:45] today. God is a good God. You're in his
[1:18:48] holy church. Why? You can't die, right?
[1:18:59] You can't die. Do whatever you want.
[1:19:03] If you're one of gods, he'll get you. He
[1:19:06] will. You will regret what you did, but
[1:19:10] he will get you.
[1:19:12] But that's the that's the God of this
[1:19:14] evil age whispering in your ear, "Oh,
[1:19:16] why? You can't die."
[1:19:18] But God said you would and that settles
[1:19:21] it. See him today?
[1:19:23] Oh, just belong to a church. It ain't
[1:19:27] what you do or this, that, or the other.
[1:19:30] Just come to church and be a good
[1:19:31] member. Cutting your hair, that's
[1:19:33] nonsense. And wearing shorts and putting
[1:19:36] on paint and going to dances and a
[1:19:39] little beer once in a while won't hurt
[1:19:41] you as long as you don't indulge in it.
[1:19:44] You know, Dad, it's been a long day at
[1:19:46] work. You know, you unwind a little.
[1:19:51] Careful.
[1:19:53] You watch it. That ain't going to stay
[1:19:55] that way. That's the god of this evil
[1:19:57] age trying to trying to feed you a line,
[1:20:00] right? Indulge in it. Frankly, I wish
[1:20:03] you children would take it so that they
[1:20:06] could learn whether they like it or not.
[1:20:08] Oh, doesn't that sound so logical? Isn't
[1:20:11] that so reasonable?
[1:20:13] There he is. The god of this age, this
[1:20:15] evil age. God is a good God.
[1:20:19] God is a good God. I've heard that so
[1:20:22] much till I get sick. God is also a God
[1:20:26] of justice. He ain't an oldie grandpa
[1:20:29] that can be pushed around and his
[1:20:31] grandkids don't have any sin. He's a God
[1:20:34] of justice and holiness. He proved it in
[1:20:37] the Garden of Eden by his first
[1:20:39] children. You cross that line of one of
[1:20:42] his words and you're dead.
[1:20:45] Same thing applies today. Okay.
[1:20:49] And so now we're coming down to the
[1:20:52] point where,
[1:20:54] you know, it's not about a list of dos
[1:20:57] and don'ts because a list of dos and
[1:20:59] don'ts ain't going to cut it. It's about
[1:21:02] whether or not God has your heart.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; It's about whether or not you're really
[1:21:07] dedicated. Because the fact of the
[1:21:08] matter is you nor I nor brother Jason or
[1:21:11] brother Matt or even brother Brandham
[1:21:13] was ever going to have a shot at
[1:21:15] actually being perfect
[1:21:19] on this side. Right? As long as you are
[1:21:23] shackled to this flesh, you're going to
[1:21:26] have problems. You're going to have to
[1:21:28] have new mercies every single morning.
[1:21:31] You're not going to get it right all the
[1:21:33] time. You're not. But, you know, if my
[1:21:36] wife does something maybe, you know, or
[1:21:38] or you know, me and my wife have a
[1:21:40] disagreement and one of us kind of, you
[1:21:43] know, just gets a little bit too um
[1:21:44] aggressive in our advocation for our
[1:21:46] perspective.
[1:21:48] Um
[1:21:51] [laughter]
[1:21:52] I don't know that I could. Um
[1:21:55] you know, and and you know, we we get a
[1:21:57] little too heated in the moment.
[1:22:00] We have each other's heart. And even
[1:22:03] though there may be hurt feelings,
[1:22:05] there's always going to be an I'm so
[1:22:07] sorry, honey. I didn't mean that. Please
[1:22:10] forgive me. I didn't mean to do that.
[1:22:13] And there's going to be a reconciliation
[1:22:14] there because there's a heartto-heart
[1:22:17] connection. There's a deep calling to a
[1:22:19] deep there, right? There's a there's a
[1:22:23] you know th these sorts of things.
[1:22:25] You're never going to be 100% right in
[1:22:27] everything. But if God has your heart,
[1:22:31] then he knows it was an accident. He
[1:22:34] knows it was a mistake. He knows it
[1:22:36] wasn't just you
[1:22:39] looking for an excuse,
[1:22:42] right? And so the moment that a marriage
[1:22:46] gets to the point where someone's
[1:22:47] looking for an excuse, boy, call the
[1:22:50] pastor because you need some counseling,
[1:22:53] right? You got a problem. Because if you
[1:22:56] don't get that under control, you're
[1:22:57] going to end up in family court,
[1:23:00] right? That's where that goes. When when
[1:23:01] one person in the marriage starts
[1:23:03] looking for excuses.
[1:23:05] And so
[1:23:07] you know what the the fact of the matter
[1:23:09] is in a marriage because ultimately all
[1:23:12] of this we can we can
[1:23:15] we can have a lot of discussion about
[1:23:17] deep dark things and and and mysteries
[1:23:19] and the spoken word and all these
[1:23:21] different things. But until we can
[1:23:23] really condense it down to the family
[1:23:24] and the way our family functions we have
[1:23:27] a lot of education and not a lot of
[1:23:29] practical experience.
[1:23:31] And
[1:23:34] you know, in a marriage,
[1:23:37] um,
[1:23:38] men and women are different. I don't
[1:23:40] know if anybody has figured that out.
[1:23:42] Men and women are very, very different,
[1:23:43] and we're called to different things.
[1:23:44] The Bible actually treats us very
[1:23:46] differently. Okay. Um, you know, here's
[1:23:50] a great illustration of this. Um, you
[1:23:52] know, in Proverbs 31, I'm sure
[1:23:54] everyone's familiar with Proverbs 31.
[1:23:55] It's the it's the chapter in Proverbs
[1:23:57] that deals with you know this is the
[1:23:59] ideal woman basically right this is the
[1:24:02] ideal this is God's standard for women
[1:24:03] and how women are to conduct themselves
[1:24:05] as wives and as mothers it's very great
[1:24:07] many many men have preached very many
[1:24:09] wonderful sermons out of Proverbs 31
[1:24:13] and um the equivalent for men is the
[1:24:17] other 30 chapters
[1:24:22] go read proverbs every chapter like from
[1:24:25] Proverbs 1 to Proverbs 30 is like, "My
[1:24:27] son, do this." It's it's 30 chapters of
[1:24:33] God trying to get men in line and one
[1:24:36] chapter for women.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Women have one chapter to live UP TO.
[1:24:41] MEN HAVE 30. The other way to look at
[1:24:44] this is this is, you know, book of
[1:24:46] Proverbs written for young men. It's
[1:24:48] it's it's a great book to read to kids
[1:24:50] because especially young men, you know,
[1:24:51] teenage boys. Hey, this is what you got.
[1:24:53] you know, this is how to pattern your
[1:24:55] life. It's written, it was intentionally
[1:24:57] written for young men as an educational
[1:24:59] tool.
[1:25:01] Notice how it's arranged. It's the last
[1:25:04] chapter that talks about what your life,
[1:25:06] your wife is supposed to be like. You
[1:25:08] don't even get to ask the question of
[1:25:11] what the woman's standard is until you
[1:25:14] get through the first 30 dealing with
[1:25:15] the man. the man. You husbands, you
[1:25:19] don't get to point your finger at your
[1:25:21] wife until you've gone through the first
[1:25:23] 30 chapters of Proverbs.
[1:25:26] Okay, that's the reality here. You bear
[1:25:30] way more responsibility than she does.
[1:25:33] Every
[1:25:37] her headship is on your shoulders.
[1:25:41] You are responsible for her. That means
[1:25:44] you bear way more burden here. It you've
[1:25:48] got th You got to live up to 30
[1:25:51] chapters,
[1:25:54] right? That's what you've got. You It's
[1:25:57] 30 to1. That's the ratio for one thing
[1:26:00] she's got to live up to. You've got 30.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Sisters, have some grace.
[1:26:07] have a little bit of of of understanding
[1:26:10] that, you know, this is why. Okay, I
[1:26:13] let's let's I'm gonna Oh boy, I'm gonna
[1:26:17] get rocks thrown at me now. Um, but we
[1:26:20] we got to do it. Um,
[1:26:23] let's turn to First Peter 3 and one.
[1:26:28] First Peter 3,
[1:26:32] chapter 3. Let me pull it up here.
[1:26:39] Do we have it on the screen?
[1:26:57] There we go.
[1:27:04] 1 Peter 3 and1 likewise you wives be in
[1:27:07] subjection to your own husbands that if
[1:27:09] any obey your own husbands um that if
[1:27:13] any obey not the word they also may be
[1:27:15] without the word be one by the
[1:27:17] conversation of the wives
[1:27:20] while they behold your chasteed
[1:27:22] conversation coupled with fear whose
[1:27:24] adorning let it not be that of outward
[1:27:27] adorning of platting of hair and of
[1:27:29] wearing of gold or of putting on of
[1:27:31] apparel, but let it be the hidden man of
[1:27:33] the heart, and that which is not
[1:27:35] corruptible, even the ornament of a meek
[1:27:37] and quiet spirit, which is the sight of
[1:27:39] God great price. For after this manner
[1:27:41] in the old time, the holy women also who
[1:27:44] trusted in God, adorned themselves,
[1:27:46] being in subjection unto their own
[1:27:48] husbands, even as Sarah obeyed Abraham,
[1:27:51] calling him Lord, whose daughters ye
[1:27:54] are, as long as you do well, and are not
[1:27:57] afraid with any amazement.
[1:28:00] Okay, let's turn to Ephesians chapter 5.
[1:28:06] All
[1:28:22] right. Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 22.
[1:28:26] Wives, submit yourselves unto your own
[1:28:28] husbands as unto the Lord. For the
[1:28:30] husband is the head of the wife, even as
[1:28:32] Christ is the head of the church, and he
[1:28:35] is the savior of the body. Therefore, as
[1:28:37] the church is subject unto Christ, so
[1:28:38] let the wives be to their own husbands
[1:28:41] in everything.
[1:28:43] Okay? And Genesis 3 and 16.
[1:28:54] And it says, "Unto the woman he said, I
[1:28:56] will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[1:28:58] and thy conception. in sorrow. Thou
[1:29:01] shalt bring forth children, and thy
[1:29:03] desire shall be unto thy husband, and he
[1:29:05] shall rule over thee. Now, I better have
[1:29:09] something real good to say
[1:29:11] because the fact of the matter is,
[1:29:15] you know, you read verses like this, you
[1:29:16] read scriptures like this, and a lot of
[1:29:19] sisters get their hackles up, right? You
[1:29:22] get you get you're like, "Okay, what
[1:29:23] this is?" And a lot of it has to do with
[1:29:25] just like sort of like the modern
[1:29:27] culture that we have this very feminist
[1:29:28] culture of like well you know if a woman
[1:29:30] is subject to a man that's like
[1:29:32] oppressive and that's like um not very
[1:29:35] feminist and you know this is the 21st
[1:29:39] century and you know women can vote now
[1:29:42] and you know
[1:29:46] look that's not what God intended. God
[1:29:50] never intended for any of his daughters
[1:29:52] to be strong, independent women who
[1:29:54] didn't need a man. Okay? That's not what
[1:29:56] he intended for anybody, right? God made
[1:29:59] the woman to be the helpmate of the man.
[1:30:02] And the problem is, you know, a lot of
[1:30:04] people get kind of on edge when you say
[1:30:07] things like this. A lot of women get
[1:30:10] very like, "Oh, I don't like that." they
[1:30:12] feel some kind of way, you know, whether
[1:30:13] or whether it's whether it's, you know,
[1:30:15] man, no man's going to rule over me and,
[1:30:17] you know, besides, my husband is this,
[1:30:19] that, or the other, and I just don't
[1:30:20] think he's very competent and I I, you
[1:30:22] know, I don't trust him. And most of the
[1:30:24] time it's it's it's most of the time
[1:30:26] it's I don't trust him actually.
[1:30:29] Um, or maybe it's, you know, um, maybe I
[1:30:32] wish I he would take charge in our
[1:30:35] relationship a little bit more, but he
[1:30:37] just won't, and he's just a little soft.
[1:30:40] Look,
[1:30:42] the fact of the matter is anytime a
[1:30:44] sister is having a negative reaction to
[1:30:45] the idea of her husband ruling over her,
[1:30:47] it's a big indication that there's a big
[1:30:49] problem in your marriage, it's a big old
[1:30:51] red flag because if the natural type is
[1:30:55] the spiritual, right? The natural, we
[1:30:56] all say this natural type is spiritual.
[1:30:59] And if this is supposed to be pattern
[1:31:00] after Christ and the bride, at what
[1:31:02] point at what point does a Christian
[1:31:05] say, well, you know, I think that, you
[1:31:07] know, God can be my savior and God can
[1:31:09] be my provider and my protector, but I
[1:31:11] don't think he should be my Lord.
[1:31:13] You know, I don't think I want to give
[1:31:14] God all of me. I don't want to give God
[1:31:18] total surrender.
[1:31:20] Well, man, I don't know that you're a
[1:31:22] Christian if that's your attitude,
[1:31:24] right? Well, sister, if that's your
[1:31:27] attitude that you're not willing to give
[1:31:29] your husband total surrender,
[1:31:32] have a problem. Something's going on
[1:31:34] there. Right now, granted, the problem
[1:31:37] in the marriage might be him. Right? He
[1:31:40] might be the problem.
[1:31:43] However,
[1:31:45] if your reaction
[1:31:47] is to go, "Well, it's definitely him."
[1:31:49] Uh, no, it's not. Right? And brothers,
[1:31:53] if your reaction to this is be like, h
[1:31:55] the women these days, ain't none of them
[1:31:57] want to be submissive. You're the
[1:31:59] problem. As a matter of fact, you both
[1:32:02] might be the problem actually. And
[1:32:05] usually in a marriage, you know who the
[1:32:07] problem is by whoever's pointing fingers
[1:32:08] at the other person actually. That in
[1:32:12] reality,
[1:32:14] [snorts] you're both right about each
[1:32:15] other.
[1:32:17] And the reality is it's not 50/50. No
[1:32:21] marriage ever is unless you're dividing
[1:32:23] assets in family court, right? That's
[1:32:26] the only time a marriage is 50/50 or you
[1:32:28] know that's where that that's where that
[1:32:31] ends. If a marriage is strong, it's 100.
[1:32:35] Both parties are 100% committed.
[1:32:39] Now the commitment that you have is a
[1:32:42] little bit different, right? Because the
[1:32:44] man is supposed to be head of the of the
[1:32:46] wife and it says Christ was head of the
[1:32:48] church. Well, what was Christ? Christ
[1:32:50] was 100% sacrificial. He was he was
[1:32:54] self-sacrificing.
[1:32:56] He laid his life down for his for his
[1:32:59] his bride. And you have the husband has
[1:33:03] to be 100% self-sacrificing. And if he's
[1:33:06] not, he's holding something back and
[1:33:08] like, well, I mean, I don't want to give
[1:33:10] 100%. If I sacrifice 100%, she's just
[1:33:12] going to take advantage of me. Well,
[1:33:15] okay, then that's just some prenup
[1:33:17] thinking, right? That's just like then
[1:33:21] you don't trust her. You have a problem.
[1:33:24] Go get counseling or something. I don't
[1:33:26] know. Go talk to each other. How about
[1:33:28] that? Start there. Right? If you want to
[1:33:31] look, if if the devil's going to break
[1:33:33] you, he'll break your communication
[1:33:34] first. Right? And that's honestly that's
[1:33:37] one of the big problems with marriages
[1:33:38] is because people don't communicate. Men
[1:33:41] think very differently than women. And
[1:33:42] when a woman says something, the man
[1:33:44] hears something very different than what
[1:33:45] she meant, right? and then he says
[1:33:48] something and she hears something very
[1:33:50] different than what he meant. Here's a
[1:33:52] great example. Um maybe some of you have
[1:33:54] experienced this. You're out and about
[1:33:56] and you're riding around in the car and
[1:33:58] then your wife says, "Hey, I'm hungry."
[1:34:02] And he says, "Okay, where'd you like to
[1:34:04] eat?" And she's like, "I don't know. You
[1:34:06] pick." He says,
[1:34:08] "Taco Bell." And she says, "No, not
[1:34:11] there." And he says, "All [snorts]
[1:34:14] right, well, when you figure it out, let
[1:34:15] me know and we'll go wherever you want.
[1:34:17] And then kind of drive in silence for a
[1:34:20] few minutes and then she kind of gets a
[1:34:23] tear running down her eye and she looks
[1:34:24] at him and goes, "Why did you marry ME
[1:34:27] IF YOU DON'T LOVE ME?"
[1:34:30] NOW,
[1:34:32] if this has never happened to you and
[1:34:34] you don't know what just happened,
[1:34:36] you're probably the man.
[1:34:40] And what actually happened is both of
[1:34:43] these people were in the same
[1:34:44] conversation and they heard entirely
[1:34:47] different things.
[1:34:49] Okay? Because what he heard his what his
[1:34:52] perception of the conversation was went
[1:34:55] something like she said, "Honey, I'm
[1:34:57] hungry." And he said, "My darling, my
[1:34:59] sweet, my everything, whatever you want
[1:35:02] unto the half of my kingdom, I will give
[1:35:04] you. I will lay my life down to give you
[1:35:07] whatever your heart desires.
[1:35:10] And she heard her conversation was,
[1:35:14] "Hey, I have a problem.
[1:35:17] Will you please help me fix it?" And he
[1:35:19] looked at her and said, "Fix it
[1:35:21] yourself."
[1:35:23] Right?
[1:35:26] That's
[1:35:27] what happens. And it's like because
[1:35:30] she's going, "Hey, I need you to help me
[1:35:31] solve this problem." And and what she
[1:35:34] actually wanted actually most of the
[1:35:35] time is she wanted you to ask her where
[1:35:37] she likes to eat when she's not hungry
[1:35:39] so that when she says, "Hey, I'm
[1:35:40] hungry." You can go, "Oh, I got you,
[1:35:42] boo. I know where we're going."
[1:35:45] Right? That's what's actually supposed
[1:35:49] um and if you do that, if you just
[1:35:52] because because she's trying to figure
[1:35:53] out if your heart is with her, she's
[1:35:56] giving you an opportunity to be a hero,
[1:35:58] dude. Right? She's giving you an
[1:36:00] opportunity to read her mind and you did
[1:36:02] that by asking questions like yesterday,
[1:36:05] right? Don't but but men don't think
[1:36:09] that way. This is like I heard somebody
[1:36:12] say one time that this is the this is
[1:36:13] the level of thinking that comes from
[1:36:15] the gender that thinks shaving off their
[1:36:17] eyebrows and drawing on new ones is a
[1:36:19] perfectly reasonable solution to already
[1:36:20] having eyebrows.
[1:36:23] You know, men don't think this way and
[1:36:26] women apparently do, but you know, it it
[1:36:31] doesn't make them women bad and it
[1:36:32] doesn't make men bad, you know. And the
[1:36:35] perception is that the women think that
[1:36:37] men are really dumb. Like, did you not
[1:36:40] get this? All you had to do was ask me
[1:36:42] what I wanted to eat like yesterday and
[1:36:45] you'd have known the answer. All you had
[1:36:46] to do was like care about me at all,
[1:36:48] man.
[1:36:50] Right? That's why she's going LIKE, "WHY
[1:36:52] DON'T YOU LOVE ME?" Because you because
[1:36:54] in her mind, you didn't do the stuff
[1:36:55] that you would need to do in order to
[1:36:56] prove that you loved her. You didn't
[1:36:58] show any interest in her because if you
[1:37:00] had, you'd have known that she doesn't
[1:37:02] like Taco Bell. She likes Del Taco.
[1:37:07] And you know, sister, because he thinks
[1:37:11] like problem solution,
[1:37:14] [snorts] and he's very uninterested in
[1:37:16] what he eats for lunch, right? Like it
[1:37:19] doesn't matter. It could have been Taco
[1:37:21] Bell. It could have been Wendy's. It
[1:37:22] could have been anything. It could have
[1:37:23] been like the the sketchy taco stand.
[1:37:25] It's really great, but man, it gives you
[1:37:26] indigestion, but it doesn't like he
[1:37:29] doesn't care. And so, when you come to
[1:37:31] him with a problem, he's going to think
[1:37:32] of a solution, and he's not seeing it as
[1:37:36] an opportunity to prove that he's a
[1:37:38] hero. He's at least the way you're
[1:37:40] thinking. And so, you're going to talk
[1:37:42] right past each other.
[1:37:44] And that doesn't make one or the other
[1:37:48] bad. It just means that you need to have
[1:37:50] a decent conversation and have some love
[1:37:52] one for the other. And when one gets
[1:37:54] their feelings hurt, the other one says,
[1:37:56] "Honey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like
[1:37:57] that." And the other one goes, "I
[1:37:58] forgive you. I understand."
[1:38:00] And if you're not able to do that, you
[1:38:02] really got to fix that. Because what
[1:38:04] happens is here's what happens. When the
[1:38:07] wife, notice, and I read this this
[1:38:09] scripture in Genesis, right, where God
[1:38:11] says to the woman, "Your desire shall be
[1:38:13] under your husband, and he shall rule
[1:38:15] over you." You know what that means? It
[1:38:18] means that there is a God like spoken
[1:38:21] word link between headship and a woman's
[1:38:25] desire.
[1:38:27] Wowzers.
[1:38:29] She's never going to be able to submit
[1:38:31] to a man that she doesn't have a heart
[1:38:33] connection with. It's not going to
[1:38:34] happen. Hey husbands, you've got a real
[1:38:38] big job. And that job is to is to prove
[1:38:40] to your wife that you love her like
[1:38:42] every day. Every single day, right? You
[1:38:46] can't just let that go. You don't just
[1:38:48] get to be like, "Well, I told you I
[1:38:49] loved you once at the altar, and if it
[1:38:51] changes, I'll notify you."
[1:38:53] That's not how that's going to work.
[1:38:56] You've got to prove this on the regular
[1:38:58] cuz she forgets. She's got a totally
[1:39:00] different neurological package than you.
[1:39:02] And that's absolutely how that works,
[1:39:05] right? And man, I could go into the
[1:39:07] science on that, but we'd be here for a
[1:39:09] long time.
[1:39:10] Look, she's wired different than you
[1:39:13] are. You're wired different than she is.
[1:39:15] This is why this is why it can get
[1:39:19] really really dangerous
[1:39:22] for women.
[1:39:26] Okay, look.
[1:39:29] I saw a picture one time of a stop sign
[1:39:32] that had a tree growing out of the top
[1:39:33] of it, right? It's a pipe stop sign with
[1:39:36] a sign bolted inside of it. It's got
[1:39:37] like concrete poured under it and
[1:39:38] there's like a thing and like how in the
[1:39:40] world did this seed, this little seed of
[1:39:42] God
[1:39:44] was poured under concrete and it found
[1:39:46] the stop sign and even though it was a
[1:39:48] sign that said stop it, the seed didn't
[1:39:49] stop and it just blew out the top and
[1:39:51] there's a whole sapling growing out the
[1:39:52] top of a stop sign. When God spoke this
[1:39:55] that your desire should be under your
[1:39:56] husband and he shall rule over you,
[1:39:58] that's a spoken word of God that's going
[1:40:00] to come out somewhere. And in this
[1:40:03] modern day, we can pour concrete on top
[1:40:05] of that. We can put a big sign that says
[1:40:07] stop on top of that. It's not going to
[1:40:08] stop. It's going to come out somewhere.
[1:40:13] And if you don't do this in a godly
[1:40:15] fashion, if you don't find a way to have
[1:40:17] a heart-to-heart connection with your
[1:40:19] spouse and so that the wife can submit
[1:40:22] to her husband in a godly fashion that
[1:40:24] he can be a headship to her in a godly
[1:40:27] fashion as a gentleman, as kind and
[1:40:30] caring as Christ would and being
[1:40:32] sacrificial and doing all of these
[1:40:34] things. and that so that she can be
[1:40:36] totally submissive to him in in a godly
[1:40:38] fashion. If you don't do this, it'll
[1:40:41] come out somewhere else and it'll come
[1:40:42] out to twisted and it'll come out
[1:40:44] perverted and it'll come out as a Satan
[1:40:46] uh serpent seed alternative. That's
[1:40:48] where it'll come out and
[1:40:53] we know this like I'll give you a great
[1:40:55] example of this and I wower it got laid
[1:40:59] on me. I should have set a timer. Um,
[1:41:03] then I preached right through it. Um,
[1:41:06] the the Okay, so who here?
[1:41:12] Okay, I'm not going to ask for a show of
[1:41:14] hands. I'm going to assume that all of
[1:41:16] you have seen Beauty and the Beast or at
[1:41:18] least familiar with the concept.
[1:41:22] Beauty and the Beast was written by a
[1:41:24] feminist woman as a Disney princess to
[1:41:26] be a feminist icon to little girls.
[1:41:30] And Beauty and the Beast is a story of a
[1:41:33] pretty young girl whose father, her
[1:41:36] headship, is basically completely
[1:41:38] irrelevant. She basically disregards
[1:41:40] him. Like, I mean, she loves him. And
[1:41:42] there's like a whole side plot with
[1:41:43] that, but she's
[1:41:46] he has absolutely no impact on her
[1:41:48] romantic life.
[1:41:51] And she's an intellectual. She's very
[1:41:52] smart, and she's bookish. And she ends
[1:41:55] up getting kidnapped, captured against
[1:41:59] her will by a
[1:42:02] beast who walks on two feet.
[1:42:06] And you know the kind of beast who walks
[1:42:08] on two feet and kidnaps women.
[1:42:11] and she is kidnapped by this beast and
[1:42:14] she can't stand him and he's very
[1:42:17] clearly not a good person until one day
[1:42:22] he shows her an act of kindness and and
[1:42:24] they have like this little connection
[1:42:26] and then he shows her he has an actual
[1:42:28] great library in his house in this
[1:42:30] castle that she's been imprisoned in and
[1:42:33] then suddenly there's just something
[1:42:35] there that wasn't there before and woo
[1:42:38] and it's strange and a bit alarming why
[1:42:40] is it strange and alarming is because
[1:42:42] her head she knows in her conscience
[1:42:43] this is really really wrong but all the
[1:42:45] psychological buttons have been pushed
[1:42:48] and now she's folded like a lawn chair
[1:42:51] right that's what happens and so
[1:42:56] you know she ends up
[1:43:00] she
[1:43:02] by the end of this movie this predator
[1:43:06] who walks on two feet who has kidnapped
[1:43:10] her and won her heart apparently
[1:43:16] that everybody in the town knows is
[1:43:18] dangerous and she's going, "Oh no, he's
[1:43:20] not dangerous. He's just misunderstood
[1:43:23] because he wouldn't hurt me. He loves
[1:43:25] me."
[1:43:28] And you realize that this feminist icon,
[1:43:33] this icon for little girls is the story
[1:43:37] of Eve and the Serpent.
[1:43:40] It's a beast who walks on two feet and
[1:43:42] he wins her heart by imparting to her
[1:43:45] vast knowledge in the form of books. And
[1:43:48] by the end of it, she's going, "Oh, he's
[1:43:50] just misunderstood
[1:43:52] all of the all of the instru Oh, and by
[1:43:54] the way, this she only got here because
[1:43:56] she rejected the headship of her
[1:43:57] heavenly father."
[1:44:01] And this is a little cartoon that we
[1:44:03] show to little girls. And then we wonder
[1:44:09] like 90 whatever it was the 90s I don't
[1:44:11] remember exactly when it came out
[1:44:14] and this is the message that we give to
[1:44:15] little girls and then in like 15 years
[1:44:18] ago when I was a teenage boy like 15 you
[1:44:21] have half the women in the country
[1:44:23] including a lot of women in the message
[1:44:24] I might add having a genuine informed
[1:44:28] opinion on whether or not they're team
[1:44:30] Edward or team Jacob.
[1:44:34] Uhhuh.
[1:44:36] Okay, for those of you who aren't
[1:44:37] picking up what I'm putting down, a lot
[1:44:40] of women are getting having an opinion
[1:44:43] on whether or not they are you want to
[1:44:44] be romantically involved with a werewolf
[1:44:46] or a vampire.
[1:44:48] What in the world? There's clearly
[1:44:51] something twisted happening here. And
[1:44:54] it's only gotten worse from there. You
[1:44:56] go through all like
[1:45:01] I married to a former librarian's
[1:45:03] assistant. I have the inside track on
[1:45:05] these things.
[1:45:07] Modern romance literature, you know how
[1:45:09] how prolific this stuff is and like the
[1:45:12] number of modern romance novels involve
[1:45:14] a kidnapping,
[1:45:17] involve a man forcefully imposing
[1:45:20] dominion over the woman.
[1:45:23] And they're all written by feminists who
[1:45:25] would, if you would have said something
[1:45:27] like the husband is to be head of the
[1:45:28] wife, would burn you at the stake.
[1:45:32] But yet in all of their romantic
[1:45:34] literature that they just want this this
[1:45:37] you know stud mcunkley to sweep them off
[1:45:40] their feet, he's kidnapping them.
[1:45:43] What
[1:45:45] what's happened here? There's a seed of
[1:45:47] God that God said that your headship
[1:45:49] will rule over you. That your desire is
[1:45:51] going to be linked to rulership. And if
[1:45:53] you squash that, if you don't actually
[1:45:56] do this in a godly fashion, you're going
[1:45:59] to end up with something perverted.
[1:46:01] You're going to end up with a beast who
[1:46:04] walks on two feet and is a kidnapper and
[1:46:06] a predator. Someone who will ruin your
[1:46:09] life. And at the end of it, you're
[1:46:10] going, "Oh, he's just misunderstood."
[1:46:14] This is what happens. Dads with little
[1:46:16] girls,
[1:46:18] that's mean, by the way. You, oh man,
[1:46:21] that this one terrifies me. if you're
[1:46:24] not living up to the standard of Christ
[1:46:27] and you're being God in the flesh to
[1:46:29] that little girl that she can grow up
[1:46:32] and say and have a real genuine
[1:46:34] understanding of what a godly headship
[1:46:36] is supposed to be.
[1:46:39] That you are jealous over that little
[1:46:41] girl with a godly jealousy. That you're
[1:46:44] not just going to be disinterested in
[1:46:46] the boys she hangs out with.
[1:46:49] that you're not going to just be
[1:46:51] uninvolved when her heart is being wooed
[1:46:54] by some some man.
[1:46:58] If you're if if if that's not
[1:47:03] if that's if you're just going to
[1:47:04] abdicate that responsibility and just be
[1:47:06] like, "Oh, well, you know, if they're
[1:47:08] one of gods, God will get them." Yeah,
[1:47:11] God will. But boy, what kind of scars
[1:47:14] are they going to come back with? If
[1:47:17] you're a dad of a little girl and you're
[1:47:20] not from the day she is born fighting
[1:47:23] with tooth and nail to win her heart,
[1:47:26] you can because the fact of the matter
[1:47:27] is you can build you can build the
[1:47:29] garden of Eden around your children. You
[1:47:31] can build the garden of Eden around
[1:47:33] them. You can have tapes playing
[1:47:34] non-stop godly music. Do family altar
[1:47:37] night and day, you know, do devotions,
[1:47:41] uh, uh, take him to church, you know,
[1:47:43] Sunday and Wednesday and stream someone
[1:47:45] else on Friday. You can do everything
[1:47:47] that you can could possibly think of and
[1:47:50] and and have the spirit of God in your
[1:47:52] home. If you do not win their heart,
[1:47:55] they will leave just like Adam did. You
[1:47:58] didn't get their heart and their heart
[1:48:00] leaves your home.
[1:48:02] What was the point? All your piety does
[1:48:04] is serve to put a flaming sword between
[1:48:06] you and your children.
[1:48:09] That's not to say none of those things
[1:48:11] are good. You should do it 100%. Do your
[1:48:13] family altar. Do your devotions. Bring
[1:48:15] your children to church. Do all of the
[1:48:16] above. But make sure above everything
[1:48:19] else you get their heart. If you don't
[1:48:23] if you don't get that little girl's
[1:48:25] heart, I guarantee you. I promise you. I
[1:48:29] guarantee you by the word OF GOD, I
[1:48:31] PROMISE you there will be the devil's
[1:48:34] alternative waiting in the wings for
[1:48:36] her. If dad isn't there to win that
[1:48:39] little girl's heart and make sure she
[1:48:42] knows that there's a man who loves her
[1:48:44] and can give her be God in the flesh for
[1:48:47] her,
[1:48:49] some disciple of Andrew Tate will do it
[1:48:52] for you.
[1:48:56] And he's not going to be a gentleman
[1:48:58] about it.
[1:49:00] He's going to be a pervert pervert about
[1:49:02] it. And he's going to take what he wants
[1:49:03] from her and he will dump her on the
[1:49:05] curb. And you will be responsible
[1:49:08] because you didn't do your job.
[1:49:13] And dads of little boys, you have a
[1:49:16] responsibility to be a leader, to show
[1:49:20] that little boy what a gentleman does,
[1:49:22] to show that little boy how a gentleman
[1:49:25] behaves.
[1:49:26] to be a an example of what a leader is
[1:49:30] and not shy away from the fact that
[1:49:32] you're going to be in charge. Don't
[1:49:34] teach your little boys that you just got
[1:49:36] to cave over. And oh man, you know, we
[1:49:39] say, you know, like the whole happy
[1:49:40] wife, happy life thing, and it's true to
[1:49:42] a large part, but man, if that becomes a
[1:49:45] doctrine and you just get rolled over by
[1:49:47] your wife at every turn,
[1:49:50] and that's the example you give to your
[1:49:51] little boys, you're not a leader. You're
[1:49:54] just a follower. You're following.
[1:49:57] You've got the you've got the the the
[1:49:59] type completely upside down. Christ
[1:50:01] doesn't follow the church.
[1:50:04] The church follows Christ. If you're not
[1:50:06] being the leader, if you don't if you in
[1:50:07] your home cannot have any authority and
[1:50:10] your wife just tells you what to do and
[1:50:12] she's the boss,
[1:50:14] how spineless are you?
[1:50:18] And that's not to say that, you know,
[1:50:20] and granted it takes it takes the wife
[1:50:21] to submit. I get that. But if you're not
[1:50:23] even going to try, if you're just going
[1:50:26] to roll over because you don't want to
[1:50:27] have a difficult conversation, you don't
[1:50:29] want to have a confrontation. And that's
[1:50:31] the pattern you give to your young men.
[1:50:33] Don't be surprised when Andrew Tate
[1:50:35] teaches them how to be a man for you.
[1:50:37] And they're he's not going to do it the
[1:50:39] way you want him to. They're not going
[1:50:41] to come out the way you want them to be.
[1:50:46] Because at the end of the day,
[1:50:49] I'm sorry I've kept you on way too late.
[1:50:55] At the end of the day,
[1:50:58] um, can I let's get the musicians and
[1:51:00] we'll we'll button this up.
[1:51:04] At the end of the day, when it when
[1:51:07] everything's said and done, this has
[1:51:09] never been about
[1:51:12] the the specifics of what you do.
[1:51:15] Your Christian walk has never been about
[1:51:17] the specifics of what you do or don't do
[1:51:20] or the particular measuring line that
[1:51:23] you live up to.
[1:51:26] It's about where your heart lies.
[1:51:30] You can be a good dad or you can be a
[1:51:32] bad dad or you can be all kinds of
[1:51:33] things. You can have massive failures. I
[1:51:35] know I have. I've had cataclysmic
[1:51:37] failures as a husband in my marriage.
[1:51:41] But I will always pick up. I will always
[1:51:45] get back up and keep fighting. I will
[1:51:48] always fight with my tooth and nail to
[1:51:51] win that little pretty little red head's
[1:51:54] heart every single morning, every single
[1:51:57] day because that's what matters because
[1:51:59] there's a heart connection there. And
[1:52:01] every single time and you know you you
[1:52:04] know I we can't see I can't see your
[1:52:06] heart. God knows your heart. God can
[1:52:09] judge your heart. I can't.
[1:52:12] But the Lord knows when you're being
[1:52:14] honest with him. The Lord knows when
[1:52:17] you're just trying to run some string
[1:52:19] around your life and and cram something
[1:52:21] in there that doesn't belong. The Lord
[1:52:24] knows.
[1:52:29] And you know,
[1:52:32] at the end of the day, it's between you
[1:52:34] and God. At the end of the day, it's a
[1:52:38] it's a romance. The Bible's a romance.
[1:52:41] It's what it is. It's it's the it's it's
[1:52:45] a it's a it's a
[1:52:49] it's God's love letter to his to his
[1:52:51] wife.
[1:52:53] And he's trying to win your heart.
[1:52:58] So, let him do it. Don't be resistant to
[1:53:01] that.
[1:53:03] You know, I I the Bible calls it the
[1:53:06] foolishness of preaching. I feel that a
[1:53:09] lot. Sometimes I feel very foolish. Most
[1:53:12] of the time, every pretty much every
[1:53:13] time I feel very foolish
[1:53:17] and I'm sorry if I've offended anybody,
[1:53:19] if I've said something that
[1:53:21] bothered someone, I don't mean to be
[1:53:23] bothered. I don't mean to hurt anybody.
[1:53:26] If I ever said anything that hurt
[1:53:27] anybody, I'd never meant it to be
[1:53:29] hurtful.
[1:53:31] You know, there's a lot of places I'd
[1:53:33] much rather be than behind a pullpit. I
[1:53:37] never set out to be a preacher. Um, I
[1:53:41] honestly would rather be shot at most of
[1:53:43] the time than get behind a pull pit. Um,
[1:53:47] but it turns out the Lord can do things
[1:53:48] to you that are a whole lot worse than
[1:53:50] getting shot at.
[1:53:53] And
[1:53:56] you know, if I've said anything that
[1:53:59] pricked your heart, that made you
[1:54:00] consider, Lord, that I'm not in the
[1:54:02] right place, that I'm I'm following a
[1:54:04] pattern that's not accurate, that I'm
[1:54:07] off the mark,
[1:54:09] that wasn't me. I don't I'm nobody, you
[1:54:13] know? I I know the I know the
[1:54:15] ridiculousness of me giving anybody
[1:54:17] advice.
[1:54:18] I'm not a good person. I was never a
[1:54:21] good person.
[1:54:23] Most of the most of everything I've
[1:54:25] learned I've learned through making a
[1:54:27] train wreck. I I don't know I don't know
[1:54:30] what any advice to give anybody. All I
[1:54:32] know is that the word says things. The
[1:54:34] Bible says things and I can present to
[1:54:37] you what I see in the in the message and
[1:54:39] I can present to you what I see in the
[1:54:40] word and I can present to you what the
[1:54:42] Lord has put on my heart. And if that
[1:54:44] touches something in your heart, you can
[1:54:46] rest assured that wasn't me. I didn't do
[1:54:50] it. The Lord did. If this is if it if
[1:54:54] something that was said that addresses
[1:54:55] something that you've been dealing with,
[1:54:57] the Lord did that. I didn't say that.
[1:54:59] [music]
[1:55:00] You know, I I could never
[1:55:03] There's too many of you. I can't I can't
[1:55:05] I can't follow all of you around all
[1:55:07] day. I don't know what you guys are
[1:55:08] going what's going on in your lives.
[1:55:10] I've got my own life. I hardly know
[1:55:11] what's going on in that.
[1:55:15] So, you know, I say all this to say
[1:55:18] that,
[1:55:20] you know, this in this day and age,
[1:55:21] there's
[1:55:26] it's way way way too late in the game to
[1:55:29] be trying to just get by.
[1:55:34] It's way too late in the age where time
[1:55:37] is way too close to be unsure
[1:55:42] to be
[1:55:44] unconcerned
[1:55:46] about the relationship between you and
[1:55:48] God.
[1:55:51] you know, the
[1:55:55] the Lord the Lord,
[1:55:59] you know, that this that quote where
[1:56:01] that I read, you know, show me your your
[1:56:03] you know, James James says you're you're
[1:56:04] justified by your works and Paul said
[1:56:06] you're justified by your faith, right?
[1:56:07] And brother Ram said that the faith is
[1:56:08] what God sees and and and your works are
[1:56:10] what man sees.
[1:56:12] You know,
[1:56:15] if there's that that little pull in your
[1:56:18] heart
[1:56:19] and whatever it is, and you know,
[1:56:22] Look,
[1:56:24] I said this once before,
[1:56:27] not every single thing, not absolutely
[1:56:30] everything that you're going to need in
[1:56:31] life is going to is going to just be
[1:56:33] revealed to you as soon as you get the
[1:56:34] Holy Ghost, right? Sometimes you're just
[1:56:37] going to have to learn stuff. Sometimes
[1:56:38] it's going to come over the pulpit.
[1:56:40] Sometimes it's going to come through
[1:56:40] experience. Sometimes it's going to come
[1:56:42] from study.
[1:56:46] But
[1:56:48] the Lord
[1:56:50] wants your heart. Cuz if he has your
[1:56:53] heart, he's got the whole ball game,
[1:56:55] right? Me and my wife, we can have
[1:56:57] disagreements. We can have fights. We
[1:56:59] can we can butt heads. If any of you
[1:57:01] guys knew us when we were younger, you
[1:57:03] know, we buted heads like crazy. The
[1:57:07] amount of people that were like, "Wow,
[1:57:09] those te people should stay away from
[1:57:11] each other cuz they are really, really
[1:57:12] toxic." [music]
[1:57:16] And yet we're married.
[1:57:18] We love each other. And I wouldn't have
[1:57:20] it any other way. We don't We fight
[1:57:22] sometimes, but we don't fight like we
[1:57:24] used to.
[1:57:27] Fight. We're better at it now. Um
[1:57:31] but the fact of the matter is that girl
[1:57:34] had my heart and she had mine or I had
[1:57:37] hers and she had mine. And no matter how
[1:57:39] much we would butt heads, no matter how
[1:57:41] difficult things were,
[1:57:43] having each other's hearts the whole
[1:57:45] ball game. That's it. They they what's
[1:57:47] what's left?
[1:57:50] You'll get through anything.
[1:57:52] And the Lord wants your heart. He wants
[1:57:57] that dedication.
[1:57:59] Friend, if you know, brother Brandham
[1:58:01] said, if you those that need to be
[1:58:02] forced to pray, man, that so struck me
[1:58:05] that line, those who need to be forced
[1:58:06] to pray. Friend, when was the last time
[1:58:09] you prayed? When was the last time you
[1:58:11] woke up in the morning and said, "Lord,
[1:58:13] I'm going to spend some time just
[1:58:14] praying." When was the last time? How
[1:58:18] often do we do that?
[1:58:21] Let the Let the Lord build a
[1:58:24] relationship with you.
[1:58:26] Let the Lord get your heart. Because if
[1:58:29] he has your heart, man, it doesn't it's
[1:58:31] not about having a legal system. My wife
[1:58:34] doesn't have to put a gun to my head to
[1:58:36] make me love her. She's got everything.
[1:58:40] She's got my everything. She's got way
[1:58:42] more than I could ever give her.
[1:58:47] So, I guess, you know, I'll close. I'
[1:58:49] I've said enough. It's 9:00.
[1:58:54] If I could just say that,
[1:58:58] be really, really sure.
[1:59:01] Be really careful. Examine your life and
[1:59:03] make make absolutely certain you're not
[1:59:06] just trying to wrap string around stuff
[1:59:08] and just make loopholes for things.
[1:59:11] Be really dedicated. What you do matters
[1:59:13] to God because it's an indication of
[1:59:16] where your heart lies. Those little
[1:59:18] things, those little foxes that we just
[1:59:20] let in and say, "Oh, it ain't no big
[1:59:21] deal." They're a big deal.
[1:59:24] Little foxes turn into big foxes.
[1:59:28] You know that little that little thing,
[1:59:31] Dad. That little thing that you hide
[1:59:33] from your kids,
[1:59:36] they'll find it one day. They'll find it
[1:59:38] one day. No, you that bottle that you
[1:59:43] want to unwind with on the way home from
[1:59:45] work, they'll find the bottle. You
[1:59:47] thought you hid it in your truck. They
[1:59:48] didn't. You didn't. They'll find it.
[1:59:51] The devil will make sure your kids find
[1:59:53] all of your faults. And when he does,
[1:59:57] every problem that you have, your kids
[1:59:59] will find it. And the devil will do that
[2:00:01] so that he has a justification for why
[2:00:04] they don't need to listen to you.
[2:00:08] Young people, your parents are going to
[2:00:10] fail you. They're going to
[2:00:12] catastrophically fail you. They're going
[2:00:14] to do it and half the time they won't
[2:00:15] even realize because they didn't know.
[2:00:19] That is not a reason to give up on God.
[2:00:22] That is the reason you don't. They are
[2:00:25] the first representation of God that you
[2:00:27] will see. That's true. They're not God.
[2:00:30] They're going to fail. Don't let their
[2:00:33] failures
[2:00:35] be the reason that something that comes
[2:00:37] between you and God.
[2:00:40] God's trying to win your heart. Don't
[2:00:42] let the things of this world come
[2:00:43] between you and that.
[2:00:56] I'm done. Let's Let's stand. Kind of end
[2:00:59] my service with a word of prayer.
[2:01:02] Father Lord, we come before you this
[2:01:05] evening. I've said my heart. I've spoken
[2:01:08] the burden that you've put on my heart.
[2:01:10] I trust that it was not just a waste of
[2:01:13] time.
[2:01:14] Lord, though I may feel foolish
[2:01:16] sometimes, I I move forward and I say
[2:01:19] what's on my heart because Father,
[2:01:21] you're
[2:01:25] you told me to go and so I went.
[2:01:29] So, Father, if something was said this
[2:01:31] evening that would help somebody, I ask
[2:01:33] that you would go with that word, help
[2:01:35] it to grow,
[2:01:37] be with the people.
[2:01:41] as we dis turn to the prayer service
[2:01:44] this evening, Father, that those words
[2:01:47] that were said that would be of of help,
[2:01:49] Lord, that they would take root, that
[2:01:51] people would not be forgetful, that as
[2:01:53] they would face the world, as they would
[2:01:54] exit this evening, return to their jobs
[2:01:57] and their lives tomorrow, Lord,
[2:01:59] something would go with them. Give them
[2:02:00] encouragement.
[2:02:03] We ask these things in your holy and
[2:02:05] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:02:06] Amen. Let's all gather and we'll
[2:02:10] take up the uh
[2:02:25] Oh, well, didn't read the text. I'm
[2:02:26] sorry, brother Jason.

[2:02:43] from brother Luther. This is for uh
[2:02:46] requesting prayer for sister Melissa.

[2:02:50] and a sore throat.

[2:04:34] the joy [singing] of thy salvation
[2:04:40] [music]
[2:04:42] and renew our spirit
[2:04:46] within
[2:04:47] me.
[2:04:52] Father, Lord, we come before you this

[2:04:56] binding together, Lord, in faith, coming

[2:05:40] our dear sister is healed right now. We
[2:05:43] we thank you for this, Lord. We claim
[2:05:45] it. We ask that you would be with the
[2:05:47] people, Father, this evening that those
[2:05:50] who would have a need upon their heart,
[2:05:52] Lord, as they would go, they would
[2:05:53] uplift a hand to you right now, Lord,
[2:05:55] that you would be able to meet them
[2:05:56] here. That Father, no matter what it may
[2:05:58] be, whatever whatever they would have
[2:06:01] need, oh Father, that you would meet
[2:06:02] them here this evening, that Father,

[2:06:25] That though, Father, that you have our
[2:06:27] heart, Lord, but more but above that,
[2:06:29] Lord, we could have yours. We would have
[2:06:32] your heart living inside of us. That
[2:06:34] your spirit would guide us and direct us
[2:06:36] in all that we would do. that Father
[2:06:38] that as we would face the day, face the
[2:06:41] weak, face this evil age, Lord, that

[2:06:45] there would be a raid against us, Lord.
[2:06:47] But by Father, by your word for this
[2:06:50] day, we could overcome,
[2:06:52] Lord, you would be with us as we would
[2:06:54] depart
[2:06:55] as we the people would go forward
