[0:01] is that we hear the word holiness and we
[0:03] have a reaction right
[0:05] and
[0:07] uh
[0:09] we have to make sure that that reaction
[0:11] is scriptural and many and that's that's
[0:15] in any in any teaching in anything
[0:18] that's what we have to do uh I think
[0:20] there's certain topics that you can look
[0:22] at and say maybe more so for others but
[0:25] it's across the board for anybody you
[0:27] you may have a bad church experience you
[0:30] may have had uh super
[0:33] uh righteous so-called
[0:37] uh people, not really, [clears throat]
[0:38] but that's how we would term it, that
[0:41] are breathing down your throat and
[0:43] constantly trying to force you into
[0:46] their mold and their shape of what they
[0:48] think is the most important things. If
[0:52] you follow these outward things, then
[0:54] you are achieving holiness.
[0:58] And I I think it's it's key from the
[1:01] scripture that we just read that we need
[1:03] to follow we need to pursue
[1:06] holiness. Without that, no one will see
[1:08] the Lord. But without a right
[1:10] understanding of holiness and what that
[1:12] means,
[1:14] how can we pursue it?
[1:15] Amen.
[1:17] 1st Chronicles 16 verse 29.
[1:26] Give unto the Lord the glory due unto
[1:29] his name.
[1:31] Bring an offering and come before him.
[1:34] Worship the Lord in the beauty of
[1:37] holiness.
[1:39] A lot of uh different translations bring
[1:42] that word beauty and instead of saying
[1:44] beauty, they say splendor. It's an
[1:47] interesting word. If you look up the um
[1:50] history of this word in ancient Hebrew,
[1:53] it's it's very strange. I don't want to
[1:56] get into that. But let's just say that
[1:58] this word splendor or beauty means a
[2:02] whole lot more than what we look at it
[2:04] at just first glance.
[2:06] It speaks of brightness. It speaks of
[2:08] brilliance. It speaks of supremacy.
[2:13] Um, I'll leave it at that. This this
[2:16] holiness, if we don't understand
[2:18] holiness
[2:20] with this added to it, we're mistaken.
[2:23] There's a brightness, there's a
[2:25] brilliance, there's a supremacy, there's
[2:28] a beauty, there's an awesomeness to
[2:31] holiness.
[2:32] Amen.
[2:34] 1 Peter 1 15 and 16.
[2:40] But as he which hath called you is holy,
[2:43] so be ye holy in all manner of
[2:46] conversation, because it is written, be
[2:48] ye holy, for I am holy. And we can all
[2:52] recall in Isaiah chapter 6
[2:56] where the cherubims cover their face and
[3:00] cover their feet and they with two more
[3:03] wings they fly. And what is their what
[3:06] is their song that they sing? Holy,
[3:09] holy, holy is the Lord Almighty.
[3:14] The whole earth is full of his glory.
[3:17] Three times holy. It's speaking of he's
[3:20] infinitely holy. So what does holy mean?
[3:24] It simply means to be set apart.
[3:28] Another way you could say to be
[3:30] different. When you talk about for us
[3:33] sanct the the act of making us holy is
[3:36] to be cleansed and set apart for
[3:38] service.
[3:39] But the word holiness is a is a word
[3:43] simply you're set apart for God. But
[3:46] really it it's way more than that. So
[3:49] much more than that. It's that's such a
[3:51] simple statement. Set apart. God is set
[3:54] apart, so you be set apart. What does
[3:56] that look like?
[3:58] I found a couple quotes from writers
[4:02] that I thought express this idea. Well,
[4:05] JC Riyle writes, "Holiness
[4:08] is the habit of being of one mind with
[4:10] God according as we find his mind
[4:13] described in scripture. It's the habit
[4:15] of agreeing in God's judgment, hating
[4:17] what he hates, loving what he loves, and
[4:20] measuring everything in this world by
[4:23] the standard of his word. All right. CS
[4:27] Lewis writes this. If we let him, for we
[4:30] can prevent him if we choose, he will
[4:32] make the feeblest and filthy of us into
[4:35] a dazzling, radiant, immortal creature,
[4:38] pulsating all through with such energy
[4:41] and joy and wisdom and love as we cannot
[4:44] now imagine, a bright stainless mirror
[4:46] which reflects back to God perfectly,
[4:49] though of course on a smaller scale his
[4:51] own boundless power and delight and
[4:55] goodness. So when God is we see see that
[4:58] God is holy, we're not speaking of
[5:01] something that should make us go, "Oh
[5:04] man, that's boring." You know, holiness
[5:06] is boring. No, holiness, that word holy
[5:12] should strike such an awe in your heart.
[5:15] It's understanding that God is other.
[5:17] He's different than this world. But then
[5:20] don't stop there because he says, "You
[5:23] be the same." Amen.
[5:25] He made you in his image and likeness.
[5:28] That's such a he wants us to express
[5:31] him. Those things become such trit words
[5:35] sometimes. What does that actually mean?
[5:38] Well, we want to have the life of Christ
[5:39] in us. What does that mean? You are
[5:42] going God is shaping you and forming you
[5:46] into a being of splendor.
[5:49] Amen. You yourself are being shaped and
[5:53] he is bringing us to this purpose. And
[5:55] in many ways, you already are
[5:58] that.
[5:59] You're already reflecting that. There is
[6:01] a sinful nature that we're biting
[6:03] fighting against, probably biting
[6:05] against, too.
[6:07] One that we're fighting against and
[6:08] battling against. But in I inside of
[6:12] that, beyond that, there is a being of
[6:17] light and energy and power and wisdom
[6:21] and love that's seeking to break forth
[6:24] from you
[6:26] that is so incredible that if we
[6:29] actually saw ourselves, we might be
[6:32] tempted to fall down and worship.
[6:36] Think about that for a minute. the the
[6:38] incredible glory that he's called us to
[6:42] and what kind of person you're going to
[6:44] be. A person that speaks and everything
[6:47] stops.
[6:50] Why? Because of your connection with
[6:51] him. Before the foundation of the world,
[6:55] he's chosen you. You're a part of his
[6:57] life, a part of his being. something
[7:01] inside of you that down deep down the
[7:04] inside of the inside on the soul. It's
[7:07] there and the new birth comes, the Holy
[7:09] Spirit comes and that life begins to be
[7:11] unleashed and something's going to be
[7:13] born. It's like a It's like a a
[7:15] caterpillar. You look at it, it's it's
[7:18] not beautiful. It It's something that we
[7:21] maybe look at in disdain, but we carry
[7:23] in our minds. That's going to go into a
[7:26] cocoon.
[7:27] Amen. and it's going to come forth as
[7:29] something grand and beautiful that can
[7:31] just lift itself on the wind.
[7:35] And that's what God is doing in us.
[7:38] Ultimately, we're not going to get there
[7:40] until we have that new body, right? But
[7:44] we're at the same time, we're already
[7:46] there by the new birth. You can identify
[7:49] you've heard from your theophony, right?
[7:52] Before the foundation of the world,
[7:53] there's a there's a body that you have
[7:56] that's eternal in the heavens.
[7:59] 2 Corinthians chapter 5, we have a
[8:02] building from God, a housetop not made
[8:04] with hands, eternal in the heavens.
[8:08] And it's a body that's incredibly
[8:11] glorious. And it is radiating the
[8:14] brilliance of God through it.
[8:18] Say, I don't feel that. I don't think
[8:19] that. I don't care what you feel. We're
[8:21] talking about what the word says. That's
[8:24] what God is shaping you into because
[8:26] that's what he created you to be.
[8:28] A perfect reflection. What is a
[8:32] reflection? God looking in the mirror.
[8:34] When he looks in the mirror, that
[8:36] reflection is you.
[8:37] Amen.
[8:38] That is what that is what he's made you
[8:40] to be. So when you think about a holy
[8:42] life, don't just think about, man, I got
[8:44] a lot of rules to follow. I shouldn't
[8:47] have a TV. I shouldn't watch this. I
[8:49] shouldn't do this. I shouldn't do this.
[8:51] It's not a negative that we're trying to
[8:54] express.
[8:55] It's a positive that God is trying to
[8:58] manifest through us. And let that
[9:01] positive life
[9:03] dictate and direct how you live. That's
[9:06] what between what J uh CS Lewis is
[9:09] saying and what JC Riyle is saying,
[9:12] you'll get the picture. This is not a
[9:14] drudgery.
[9:15] To be holy is not a drudgery.
[9:18] Amen.
[9:20] It it's it's not a list of rules.
[9:23] It's who you who he makes you to be.
[9:27] I want to be careful and make that
[9:28] distinction. It's not merely who you are
[9:30] because we can look at that and see our
[9:32] own sinfulness, our own weakness, but
[9:35] it's who he has designed us to be. We
[9:38] fell. That's what redemption was for.
[9:40] That's why Christ came and shed his
[9:42] blood to restore us back to the original
[9:44] purpose God had in making us. to make us
[9:47] beings of light and splendor and glory
[9:49] and power.
[9:55] Go God has called us to live a holy
[9:57] life.
[9:59] This kind of life, like I said, it's not
[10:01] a negative, it's a positive.
[10:04] It's not drudgery. It's not continual
[10:08] sorrow. It's joy in the midst of trials
[10:11] and troubles and pain. I don't know who
[10:14] I was speaking to, [snorts] brother
[10:16] Brad, I think it was, yesterday about
[10:18] joy. Joy is is is like something that
[10:22] you can't really grab your grab a hold
[10:25] of. It's something that God brings into
[10:28] your life. [snorts] It's not happiness
[10:31] because you can have joy when there's
[10:33] tears coming out of your eyes.
[10:35] Amen.
[10:36] When you're feeling great pain and
[10:39] you're suffering and dealing with with
[10:41] heartache, you can feel joy. What is it?
[10:45] I don't know what it is. [snorts] It's
[10:48] the presence of God.
[10:50] It's his love. It's something that
[10:52] sweeps over you that you say, "I want to
[10:55] live in this eternally. I don't ever
[10:57] want to leave this thing."
[10:58] Amen.
[10:59] And God says, "But you can only have it
[11:02] in part now. You're going to have it in
[11:04] fullness when you come over here with
[11:07] me. But I'm giving you a foretaste.
[11:10] We've all had that experience where you
[11:12] see something or you experience
[11:13] something or you're in a place in nature
[11:16] and joy comes over you. You I I don't
[11:20] maybe you haven't, but I've had it where
[11:22] I've been so sorrowful and in pain and
[11:25] suffering over something that I'm going
[11:26] through and the joy of the Lord sweeps
[11:29] over and tears come and thankfulness and
[11:31] gratefulness
[11:32] come over me. That's joy.
[11:36] That and holiness is much like that.
[11:39] Holiness is not a mere feeling. It's not
[11:42] based on how you feel, but it's him
[11:45] sweeping over you and using you and
[11:48] moving through you and shaping his life
[11:51] in you. It's it's you and yet it's other
[11:55] than you.
[11:56] It's different. It's distinct from you.
[12:03] This isn't a life that says,
[12:06] you know, the the the the the new age
[12:09] movement is out there trying to mimic
[12:12] with false teaching what the Bible
[12:14] teaches about who we are.
[12:17] You're gods. You're you just have to
[12:20] recognize that spark of life of who you
[12:22] are. But what is it? It's all pride.
[12:25] It's self- pride. There's no room for
[12:28] that. A person who is truly holy is
[12:32] humble.
[12:34] He recognizes that this is not of
[12:36] himself. This is from God to us as a
[12:41] great gift.
[12:44] So real and real recognition of the
[12:48] power of who we are in him would lead us
[12:53] to a life of self-examination
[12:55] before God's throne. wouldn't leave us
[12:58] to justify ourselves. Well, I'm th I'm
[13:00] this, so I can live any way I want. You
[13:02] can, but you better be careful because
[13:05] the any way you want will express what
[13:08] life source you're coming from.
[13:09] Amen.
[13:13] The life that he places in us is a life
[13:16] that is so earnestly and continually
[13:20] desiring and and and and
[13:24] like a a mother giving birth, seeking
[13:28] that kind of life to be birthed in us on
[13:31] a daily basis.
[13:35] A life that follows hard after the word
[13:38] to be cleansed from all worldliness from
[13:41] all ungodliness
[13:43] anything contrary to the message that
[13:45] would be the heart's desire
[13:48] of this holy person.
[13:52] Matthew 16:24
[13:58] Then said Jesus unto his disciples, "If
[14:00] any man will come after me, let him deny
[14:04] himself and take up his cross and follow
[14:07] me." You can get this verse and you
[14:11] could say, "What a hard pill to swallow.
[14:14] What a bitter root to chew on. Take up
[14:18] your cross.
[14:19] deny myself, follow me. But for a
[14:23] believer who is participating in the
[14:27] life of Jesus,
[14:30] this isn't a bitter root.
[14:32] It's not a hard pill to swallow. Is it
[14:35] difficult? Is it all life consuming?
[14:38] Absolutely. But it's not a hard pill to
[14:40] swallow. It's our great delight. It's
[14:43] our joy. It's our passion. That's the
[14:46] root of holiness. We're we've forsaken
[14:48] everything to follow Jesus. We have seen
[14:51] a person,
[14:54] not a set of rules, not a set of facts.
[14:58] We have met a person and he's sh
[15:02] displayed himself to us and revealed
[15:05] himself to us personally and that we
[15:08] desire to give everything of ourselves
[15:10] to him. everything that we have need of.
[15:13] And he is infinitely worthy of our
[15:16] worship and submission. So we with
[15:19] delight forsake all to follow him. We're
[15:24] set apart from this world unto Jesus.
[15:28] A person,
[15:30] not a set of rules, not a lifestyle to
[15:32] live, not the message doctrine. We're
[15:36] set aside to live for a person. Amen.
[15:41] We're not pursuing holiness as an end in
[15:44] itself. We are pursuing a person that
[15:48] loves us beyond all measure. That has
[15:51] called us to forsake all and that he
[15:54] himself has forsaken all himself in
[15:57] order to win us
[16:00] in order to save us. And so this is
[16:03] beyond
[16:06] so far beyond holiness is not a set of
[16:08] rules.
[16:10] It's not well if I if my dress my if my
[16:13] skirt is so long well let's debate about
[16:16] it. How long long should your skirt be?
[16:18] That's not what this is.
[16:22] This is a life of holiness. This is
[16:24] being set apart to a person and he leads
[16:27] and he guides and he teaches
[16:31] and he show he shows you and he convicts
[16:33] you.
[16:35] Are we are we so dull that we're seeking
[16:39] after living a life of rules and not
[16:42] offending people. That's what our desire
[16:45] and our greatest passion is. Not
[16:47] offending people. Come on, get saved.
[16:51] Get saved. Meet Jesus.
[16:55] It's not about following a set of rules.
[16:58] It's about living your life
[17:01] the for the mo the loveliest,
[17:04] most awesome, incredible person in the
[17:07] world. Psalm 63.
[17:11] Look at David.
[17:15] This is not a life of drudgery to a set
[17:17] of rules.
[17:20] Oh God, thou art my God. Early will I
[17:24] seek thee.
[17:26] This is this is what's birthed in a
[17:28] believer
[17:30] that's [snorts] seeking after holiness.
[17:32] Amen.
[17:33] Early will I seek thee. My soul thirsts
[17:37] for thee. My flesh longs for thee. In a
[17:40] dry and thirsty land where no water is.
[17:44] One pursuit.
[17:47] One desire. Not six, not two, not three.
[17:52] When you're looking for water, you're
[17:54] not worried about if the mortgage is
[17:55] going to be paid. You're not worried
[17:58] about anything besides one thing, and
[18:01] that's I'm seeking for water. If I don't
[18:04] get water, I'm dead.
[18:07] Okay? This is David's heart towards God.
[18:12] God, I'm looking for you. My longing is
[18:16] for you. My one great passion is for
[18:18] you.
[18:19] For what? Verse two. To see thy power
[18:23] and thy glory. So as I have seen thee in
[18:26] the sanctuary, a living God.
[18:29] A true and living God. Not a statue, not
[18:32] an idol, not a mental conception, but
[18:34] he's looking for a living, manifested
[18:36] God.
[18:39] Verse three, because
[18:41] thy loving kindness is better than life.
[18:45] my lips shall praise thee. So this is
[18:50] the reason for his pursuit.
[18:53] That is the reason for David's pursuit
[18:55] is because God's love and kindness is
[19:00] better than this human life.
[19:05] All the things that we have in it, the
[19:07] good times, the bad times, the
[19:08] suffering, the thing that everybody's
[19:10] trying to avoid is dying, right? They're
[19:13] try they're trying to stay alive.
[19:15] They're pursuing staying alive.
[19:18] A and David says, you know what? God's
[19:21] love is better than that.
[19:23] Amen. Amen.
[19:25] And he says, my lips shall praise thee.
[19:28] Verse four, thus will I bless thee while
[19:31] I live.
[19:33] I will lift up my hands in thy name.
[19:36] This is seeking a life of holiness,
[19:39] right?
[19:41] This this is this is a heart set on fire
[19:44] and passion for God. That's what seeking
[19:48] a life of holiness is. My soul shall be
[19:52] satisfied
[19:54] as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth
[19:57] shall praise thee with joyful lips.
[20:01] Amen.
[20:03] So if you're if you're if you're having
[20:05] a if you're you're eating a diet that's
[20:09] low in fat, your soul won't be
[20:11] satisfied.
[20:13] Your flesh won't be satisfied. So we
[20:15] want to be as Christians, we want to be
[20:17] eating marrow and fatness, something
[20:20] that has sustains and strengthens life.
[20:24] Amen.
[20:30] Joyful lips.
[20:32] Amen. Joy.
[20:36] Think about what I mentioned before
[20:37] about joy. The importance of that.
[20:41] Seeking after joy.
[20:44] Seeking after joy is what? Seeking after
[20:46] God.
[20:47] You can't create joy in yourself. God
[20:51] does that
[20:52] inside of you.
[20:55] When I remember thee upon my bed and
[20:57] meditate on thee in the night watches
[21:01] my because thou has been my help.
[21:03] Therefore in the shadow of thy wings in
[21:05] your presence
[21:07] will I rejoice. My soul follows hard
[21:11] after thee. Thy right hand upholdeth the
[21:15] me. So he says early will I seek thee.
[21:18] And then he says in my on my bed and in
[21:22] the night watches will I meditate. This
[21:24] is someone who is continuously all day
[21:28] seeking after God.
[21:29] Amen.
[21:34] You know, we we can claim I don't smoke.
[21:39] I don't drink. I don't curse. I I I I I
[21:44] don't wear makeup, sisters. I don't cut
[21:46] my hair. Uh you can go on and on over
[21:50] the list of things that you don't do. A
[21:53] and those things can then become matters
[21:56] of pride,
[21:59] self-ride,
[22:00] self-justification. I don't do this, I
[22:03] don't do that, therefore I'm okay. This
[22:06] is not the kind of life of holiness that
[22:09] God's calling us to. Again, that's the
[22:11] ne that's looking at the negative.
[22:13] Looking at the negative that we're
[22:15] avoiding is pride. The purpose of God is
[22:19] not for us to avoid things.
[22:22] Amen.
[22:24] He's not coming and saying, "Hey, I want
[22:26] you guys to be miserable.
[22:28] I want you to have a horrible life
[22:30] because you have to avoid everything."
[22:32] No, he's asking us and telling us, "Find
[22:38] your joy in me. Recognize who I am and
[22:42] recognize that I'm trying to make you
[22:44] like me." And there's a transforming
[22:46] power. And of course, God has a
[22:48] standard. God has a law. God has God has
[22:54] many things in the New Testament that he
[22:55] tells you if you do this, you're not
[22:57] going to the kingdom of God.
[23:00] But again, this is not to be pursued
[23:04] like the Jews pursued the law. Too many
[23:08] times this happens in Christian circles
[23:11] because we know the standard then the
[23:14] standard then becomes a law and it
[23:17] becomes follow this do this do this do
[23:21] this and I'm okay with everybody but are
[23:24] you okay with God?
[23:26] That's what's most important.
[23:28] Why are we looking at are we okay with
[23:29] everybody? Just go find a movement where
[23:32] you can be everything's okay if that's
[23:34] your attitude. We're we're looking and
[23:37] seeking after God.
[23:38] Amen.
[23:39] That's the purpose. And and the the
[23:41] things that are written are written by
[23:44] by Paul and the apostles to to
[23:47] demonstrate this is the kind of life
[23:50] that Christ lives through his people.
[23:52] Yeah.
[23:53] This is the kind of holiness that comes
[23:56] into a person from God and is manifested
[23:59] in their life. So therefore, you could
[24:01] see if this is happening and this is
[24:03] happening and this is happening, it
[24:05] shows that Christ is not in you.
[24:08] Amen.
[24:08] Right? That's that's the vision that God
[24:12] has for his people in this day. It's not
[24:15] a list and set of rules. The standard
[24:17] has been restored by the word.
[24:20] We know the standard. I'm not up here
[24:22] telling you we don't need a standard.
[24:24] What I'm telling you is if you don't
[24:27] pursue it right,
[24:29] you're not experiencing God's salvation.
[24:33] God's salvation is his spirit coming and
[24:37] living in you. You'll find quotes.
[24:39] Brother Brandham says, "None of us are
[24:41] holy. It's the Holy Spirit living inside
[24:45] of us
[24:46] and changing us and making us into that
[24:50] that that that son or daughter that God
[24:53] had in his mind before the very
[24:55] foundation of the world. Amen. All
[24:57] right, I'm out of time. Let's stand and
[24:59] pray.
[25:03] Gracious Father, we come to you now,
[25:05] Lord, and our desire is to enter into
[25:08] the vision that you had of us before the
[25:11] foundation of the world,
[25:14] Lord, that we would be holy even as you
[25:17] are holy, and that we would see what
[25:19] that the beauty and grandeur and majesty
[25:24] of what holiness really is. and that you
[25:26] are seeking to place those same uh uh
[25:31] titles and attributes upon us and in us
[25:35] and through our lives. Help us to enter
[25:37] into that vision, Lord, of the word. Let
[25:41] us lay aside the things that are trying
[25:44] to beset us and and and pull us aside.
[25:48] Let us not look to the negative
[25:52] and see I'm not doing this. I'm not
[25:55] doing that. But let us look to you and
[25:58] say, Lord, bring bring your life in me
[26:01] more and more that I would be an
[26:03] expression of of your holiness.
[26:07] Lord, we will commit ourselves, we
[26:08] commit the service, commit each one into
[26:10] your hands. Use us for your glory. We
[26:12] ask in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you.
