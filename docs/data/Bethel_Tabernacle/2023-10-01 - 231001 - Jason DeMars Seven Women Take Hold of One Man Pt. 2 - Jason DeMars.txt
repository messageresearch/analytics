with you [Music] Hallelujah [Music] praise the Lord God is good amen wanna be thankful to be back with you again long time traveling and on the road it feels good to be home with the with the home folk now it took a little while to get there from my Minnesota Roots but it feels like home now so praise the Lord I'm going to bring up the PowerPoint I want to continue on the subject from a long time ago I guess I'm sure you have perfect memory of everything I preached about two months ago seven women take hold of one man speak on that subject continue on and since it was so long ago I'll probably repeat a fair portion of that but if you bring that PowerPoint up as we do we're going to read Isaiah chapter 4. and every time I I've spoken on this in different places there's always been the devil hates this word the devil hates homes that are in order the devil hates homes that are passing that order onto their the children he hates it he's he's battling against it in the western world there's been and a multi-faceted Onslaught against the roles of men and women marriage child bearing and the vision that we raise our children with every direction this this fight in this battle has come and so we we should expect that when we go into the word of God and point these things out that the enemy would hate that and would attack it and would move against it I think as we've come further on now in this day we realize how deceptive it is how can you arrive at this place where they don't know what a man or a woman is let alone what their roles are how did we get this far well it was a deception that started and there was a prophet that God sent to point out this deception and the world said what nonsense what an old crank what an old fogy but the it's it's the reality that brother Branham brought us a truth and unfortunately um when we hear it because of the culture that we live and are surrounded in and the entertainment that we're around and the educational system and all of these things that are surrounding us when we hear it we go oof well brother branham's you know we can soften that a little bit and so I don't believe that we should soften it I think we should go in and find out why he said it scripturally place it and see see why it's so important that he would bring out these things I'm not here in my mind I'm not here to preach against anybody or if you feel like I'm poking at you I'm not poking you I love the Lord I would I would rather die than to go against his will I spent all last night and this morning trying to run away from this subject somehow and find another way I'll do it another time I'll do it another thing and I just I know that this is what the Lord wants me to preach about and I'll leave it at that place so I'm going to read the scripture so you can sit down and then I'll talk to you some more Isaiah chapter 4. and verse 1 and 2. and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel gracious Heavenly Father we come before you Lord and we're so thankful for your word Lord we're so thankful for a Vindicated interpretation of that word in this day Lord and that you've pointed out so clearly a prophetically in the message that if we have eyes to see and ears to hear we can receive it and be on our guard against the attacks of the enemy we understand the attacks of the enemy are coming from every direction and we should under we should realize where it's coming from and block those places where the enemy is attacking but even even greater than that I believe that as Overcomers will go on the offensive we're not here simply to be pounded to death and to sort of kind of win the battle but we're here to pound back at the enemy and to show that he's a liar and he's a deceiver and that he's come to destroy and to kill you Lord I pray that your Holy Spirit would take control of me okay to take control of every heart take control of the spiritual atmosphere surrounding this this building Lord may your presence come Lord in me the spirit of Revelation be operating at every heart we commit ourselves and we give ourselves to you we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you can be seated there's a there is an evil spirit working in this age actually there's uh Millions numerous Satan has a has an army that he is commanding and operating through and he works through government he works through culture civilization education he works through uh newspapers online media social media and he is the driving force behind the viewpoints that are put forward in politics in this day whether it be a Godless Democrat Party or a Godless Republican Party both of them are playing into the hands of the devil and the enemy and we can't look to politics per se for our salvation or for the Redemption of our society the Republicans aren't going to fix our society Donald Trump is not going to repair our homes and the the educational system or anything really for that matter other than maybe the economy when we can't look to that and we can't expect that to be the case we as Christians have to take a hold of the word of God because it's a sword and we have to cut our way through the enemy's lies and I'm I'm here to express to you don't think that there's innocent forms of entertainment everything has a message everything has a presentation everything is trying to put a picture in your mind you say oh it's Disney it's no big deal it's this little thing they have an agenda and it it's not this agenda whether it be whether it's Disney or fox or whatever yeah they're all the same thing and they're all controlled by the same evil spirit and just a few different families frankly and they have a message and it isn't a message that comes from Malachi 4. and so when when we look at any kind of media we should understand this basic fact this basic reality is that there is a there is a message being proclaimed to you be on guard and search it by the word all these I don't want to get off on a tangent let's go back let's go back and look what brother Branham says in uh the invasion of the United States I read this message from 1954 what an incredible prophetic statement is being made here you know we read brother Brandon we think he's just preaching look at what he is saying it is incredible go back and re listen to this or read this message the invasion of the United States because he's telling you exactly what's happening right now you know the United States has more divorce divorce cases than all the rest of the world more divorces think of it that horrible the motherhood has been broken mothers don't stay home no more with their children like they used to they got to have a job here the other day a certain grocery man in this city was talking to me about it these women working in this public plants young married women with a bunch of little kids they got babysitters taking care of their babies they work in the public places said there was two of them standing there when they got laid off at their Public Works said don't worry we'll make it anyhow oh such an hour listen to what brother Branham says now after he says this makes that statement oh such an hour of prostitution at hand the devil has done told them that they're the boss of the house they'll make their own money they'll do what they wish to and you get it out of them if you can there's only one thing can get it out of them that's the altar before Jesus Christ an old-fashioned tear stream religion that'll break their hearts and tear them to pieces and make them what they ought to be that's right they may think I'm just an old fogy but the day when you're dying my brother sister you realize that I told you the truth that's right my goodness so as we see what brother Brandon is speaking this isn't an isolated thing you look this and you can search it up and over and over again he speaks about this and it's what what uh it's so critical for us to understand this in this hour because this is the place this is a place of the onslaught you see as Christians so many times we we know we read this and we know okay that's the truth but understand is what can replace a mother in the home what can replace that what what a man can't do it no he can't do that what can replace the value of a mother in the home you know I my mother has passed on to her reward and there isn't hardly a day goes by that I don't think about her and thank God for her you know she she was a extremely intelligent woman she could have done anything and she and my dad said she could have done anything she wanted to and then all of the kids respond she did exactly what she wanted to she was a mom she raised her kids she took care of her husband I'm a blessed man because of that and I'm still I'm still a blessed man I have a wife at home taking care of my children and we look at that and say oh well she didn't have her career she didn't have this what where is this thinking coming from you you you you you automatically think that why is it because that's what you've been preached at in society for the last 75 years 80 years this is the direction that the world has pushed us but I I want to say is this type of thinking who where where what source is it where is it coming from what's the purpose I understand there's exceptions to everything and there's problems we don't live in a perfect world and think things happen but we shouldn't make everything an exception see when you make everything an exception then that's where you're literally not believing God's word anymore and so let's look and see how God created man and woman in the beginning and we can understand the role and purpose that God has for them and young men as I'm preaching this is don't think I'm just well the ladies can just listen uh it doesn't matter to me you are the guardian in the home of this it's not up to your wife to set things in order you must set in an order you must make sure that these things are happening it's on you it's not on your wife you you have to lead you have to guard you have to keep the Lord God took the man Genesis 2 15 and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it interesting we look at this and I personally have always read this verse and simply said oh he's it's uh this is his responsibility Over the Garden of Eden yeah sort of but that's not the whole picture what's in the Garden of Eden his wife to be his family right what else is in the Garden of Eden a devil you know you think my goodness he's in Paradise why does what does he need to work and and guard God made man to work even in a place of perfection where God had provided everything in the Garden of Eden the fruit was there the vegetables were there the herbs were there presumably man would have to do nothing initially to eat because God had provided it there but yet God says even to this man in Paradise work why because idleness leads to all kinds of evils all sorts of evils the worst perversions happen in people that are too idle look at America today look at what the aristocracy in England devolved to every man had a uh his prostitute and maybe male lovers female lovers all kinds of things why because they had no work to do yeah they weren't employing themselves and God never made a man to be lazy he made him to work that's this very word to dress means to a service a work performed and they're vanished they're vanished the PowerPoint a work performed or made for another out of obligation requirement or gratitude see God had placed over man a stewardship and he was to work in this stewardship he was to be the manager of God's creation he was to be the leader he was to be head the headship of man is not a result of the Fall the headship is a part of the original design God designed it in the very beginning to be this way and he was also to keep it the word keep means to guard a close watching of something for guarding or protecting Shepherds constructed Corrals of Briars at night to protect the flock from predators a guard to keep watch over or guard in the sense of preserving so there we see the purpose of the Lord in creating the man he made him to be a guardian to be a preserver to be a protector that's your purpose man that's your purpose young man what are you supposed to do you're supposed to learn how to work and provide for a family and how to guard and protect and preserve that's why you're a young man growing to serve the Lord is that what you're supposed to do well I don't I'm supposed to play video games no you're not supposed to play video games that that's done more for the deadening of manhood than anything I can imagine get outside and work God has designed us to work in any any kind of unoccupied time that's many times that's how the devil operates in people they have no purpose they have no vision you have a vision it's to learn how to work you have you have a purpose it's learn how to protect and provide for a family and to guard them and this is not just physical guarding this is spiritual guarding you need to have vision God is placed in us as men we need to have vision and see the big picture and give the warning give say this is going to lead to this thing we have to stop that we have to change that we have to be under correction all right Genesis 2 24 there therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh amen the true Oneness is between a husband and wife you know we have our cute sayings that we say well we're not losing a daughter but we're gaining a son-in-law no you are giving a DOT your daughter to another man you're giving the daughter to a man and the God is creating a new family through them and that's where the priority lies is on that new family they shall be one flesh not your whole family and people use that as a way of manipulation and control no let them be a family let them grow on their own all right and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him and help meet for him so when God created man the very first job he gave him to do was to work and to guard from the attacks of the enemy physical and spiritual when he made the woman what did he do he he pointed out here that it was not good for the man to be alone the very first thing in the perfect Paradise that was not good was man being alone it's not right for man to be alone so he made a help meet for him help speaks of Aid or assisting meat speaks of as before him or one like him in other words a helper who is like him so when God designed created a woman created her to be a helper to help the man to do what the man is called to do and he made them one one purpose one envision all right First Timothy 2 12-14 but I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence for Adam was first form then Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression that's where I see in Scripture that God's design before the fall was for man to be had to lead and for Eve to submit right and Adam's purpose was to guard and to work and provide to provide and her purpose was to be the helper right and so this is bigger than the picture of well we shouldn't believe in women preachers there's a whole whole thing that goes into this there's headship and creation and God's purpose for Christ and the bride you don't have the bride preaching to Christ you have pride Christ bringing the word to the bride vindicating that word and being the head being the leader you don't have the bride leading Christ Christ is the head he leads the bride first Peter 3 7 likewise your husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered we shouldn't be offended at the word of God the Bible says a woman is a weaker vessel that's the truth and husbands have to give honor unto her unto her because she's the weak of weaker vessel and because your heirs together of the grace of life all right proverbs 31 virtuous woman we're not going to read the scripture we did it the last time we went over this but it speaks of the attributes of the virtuous woman it says she's trustworthy she seeks wool and flax she willingly works with her hands she plans and provides a variety of foods for her family she Rises early in the morning to prepare a meal for the family she works along with her husband to expand household business where she considers a field and buys it plants a Vineyard she inspects the things her household is producing and will do what it takes to make sure that it's quality she works on providing clothing for a family she has a heart to provide for the poor she doesn't fear various seasons of life because she makes provision for them she prospers from hard work and so does her family her husband is honored because of her she not only supplies for the needs of her family she makes additional materials and sells them she's a strong and honorable woman she's wise and kind she's not idle or lazy and her focus is not on outward Beauty and charm but on the character produced by the fear of the Lord you look at that and you see and understand there's you see the scriptural balance in this there's a vision together for the household for the husband and wife there's not one career over here and one career over here but there's a vision to gather that you're working towards now we look at this world look at what brother Branham says as we spoke about at the start I want to start putting the details on this in the Rapture he says my my hall education and wisdom this world has turned the church into a bunch of ragweeds it's education and the educational system science and civilization is of the devil it's the devil's civilization the Bible said so amen so we can look at that and we can see that but do we see how because it's great to see okay education science and civilization is all of the devil but how is the devil working because it's one thing to say it and then it's one thing to live your life battling against the enemy if you don't know what the enemy is doing how will you fight against him how you battle against him you're just blind you're not seeing the reality of what's creeping in and again Satan never works by just showing new well everybody our goal is to have you all all you men dressing like women and all of you women dressing like men that's our that's our goal because we want to destroy everything in this Society and and if they came at the beginning just imagine 1910 somebody announces that to everybody they say okay here's a place for you to live in the crazy house that's but that's exactly what happened they slowly took us to this direction that was Satan's Satan's purpose and so now remember that the devil is still preaching his Gospel of feminism he's still preaching his what he's he's trying to pull your minds off of the vision that God has for your life and you can get sidetracked on every direction when you miss God's Simple Plan God's simple purpose this isn't complicated I should I should be able to take five minutes and just say and you'd be like oh yeah that's exactly right let's move on with our lives but because the talons of the enemy have sunk so deep in everything that we do we have to labor on this and point out this and show believe me I'd like to come and just encourage you and have everybody walking out oh I'm just rejoicing and happy Oh I love it when brother Jason preaches every time I always feel so light on light-hearted the Lord has not made me that way he's not ordained me that way he's not sent me that way and so you just pray for me God love God God loves us and because he loves us he sends correction so cultures change but the word of God does not change so we went through this before I'm just going to do it as briefly as I can but there there's been a progression away from living the way God designed us to live on this Earth to the place we're out today we're living in a world that's not of God it started out that there were farming societies divided into landowners and lower class up until the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s and 1800s husband and wife roles were clear obvious Undisputed then came that Industrial Revolution and the birth of the middle class rolls start out clear but to begin to get muddier and as the time of reproduct mass re mass production comes you see the start of the breakdown of society the breakdown of the home in the early 1900s up until even now that we're in the last 10 12 years the digital Revolution blurring the alliance to the point where none of it matters what are the rules what are we supposed to do what can what does god require of us what is God looking at for us well you can't really look to society to tell you that you'd have no idea what it is you can't look to conservative Society you can't look to Liberal Society you have to look straight to the word looking at these different things I'm not going to go over that but directly connected to this uh devolving this this downward spiral of family is connected at the very same time this process where the modesty of the woman is attacked and destroyed you come at the message from the angle that my we're so different than the world this is hard this is strange this is weird but the problem is as you're doing what God's people have always done yeah through all the ages that you're living in a world where it's literally Satan's Eden and women it's no problem what kind of old crazy person they just want to control you to tell you not to cut your hair to tell you not to wear makeup to tell you to wear a dress or a skirt instead of pants this is this is crazy what kind of Fanatics are they you're the Fanatics you're the crazy people undressing yourselves you've destroyed Society by this wickedness the first wave of feminism was the promotion of equal contract and property rights for women and the opposition to chattel marriage and ownership of married women and their children by their husbands however by the end of the 19th century activism focused primarily on gaining political power particularly the right of women's suffrage the second wave came was the women's liberation challenging the cultural and legal validity of patriarchy and the social and sexual hierarchies used to control and limit the legal and physical independence of women in society that's a whole mouthful and then the third wave is the freedom of sexual bodily expression fighting sexual harassment continued expression of women's rights by dismantling any gender roles whatsoever and we see the results today we see the results of this it's easy to see what the results are and you have men dressed up quote unquote sexily like women in schools grooming children and it's the enshrining of the rights of pedophiles that's what the next step is and it's it's a whole perversion you say well that's a lot different than women's rights I'm talking about the progression I'm talking about Satan's progress that he's made he was marching towards this right how did he start marching towards it get rid of modesty women can vote women don't need men here's the truth is men need women and women need men any other kind of idea is is a total lie women need the strength of men men need the Beauty and the dignifying effect of a woman in their life we need each other but as you as you look at this progression it's obvious to us but then we have to understand is how far has this impacted we we talk about this this scripture I'll just bring quickly it's the dangers look at this how how God looks at this First Corinthians 6 9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind and so Paul is saying effeminate men will not go to heaven is essentially what he's saying unless they repent and turn away from that wickedness because it is wickedness it's a perversion and God God hates it and as we as we as we look we see that our culture has become feminized it's come become feminized to the point where a real man is spoken of uh oh you know in horrible terms you can you can say anything you want about a real man but never never say a word about any woman because a woman transgenders perverts they're all enshrined as the ones that we protect and fight for and it's got everything opposite everything perverted man are are self-centered idiot and many times they are self-centered idiots it's true but that's what Society has pigeonholed them into and they have to be led by wise and Powerful women deadening of Manliness comes from the video game addiction and the proliferation of estrogens and food water and clothing he says Sciences of the devil science has developed these things and put them in our food food women work and lead the family the man works too but remains disconnected and unaware and then all masculinity is identified as toxic but the real thing that's toxic is the attack on true masculinity amen men respond to all of this as it's hopeless for me I will check out I'll just pay attention to the football and the hockey and the basketball game and the baseball game and the beers or else they become more like women because this this way at least I can get a little respect around here it's crazy brother Branham speaks about this perversion in the food supply he says do you read this here this month's reader digest that men and women of this day little girls from 20 or 25 years old is in menopause that you go through the change of life in the middle age of life according to science between 20 and 25 used to be around 30 or 35 in my age in my mother's age a woman never struck menopause till she was 40 or 45 what is it it's through science and the food the hybrids that's perverted the whole human body till we've become a bunch a mass of corruption well if the physical being is being corrupted isn't the brain cell in that physical being right and then in thirsty says but the way they are on the street today haircut like a man wearing men's clothes and then men turn around wearing women's clothes and a haircut like a woman see it's a perversion the whole thing your food is perverted your life is perverted your thirst perverted your desire is perverted it's a day of perversion amen my goodness brother Brandon saying this in 1965 how we would love to go back and live in a society like 1965 but he's speaking to the seed that's been planted we're watching the fruit that's about to be harvested and sent to the fire estrogen is everywhere used to not be this way now you go out into the Farmland all you see is practically soy everywhere it's in every snack every baby formula almost every baby formula vegetable oils and every snack it's in meat and dairy production it's in tap water bottled water BPA and Plastics phthalates and lotion makeup laundry Products plastic wrap birth control pills are in the water supply and testosterone is suppressed when there's excess estrogen so if if that's being consumed what's happening to the men and then when it's suppressed from Young ages the development leads to the feminization of boys what what hour are we living in look at this what's being pushed and now even even gender treatments to absolutely go and suppress hormone development and body development what a what a corruption what a deceit so over the past 50 years in studies human sperm counts appear to have fallen by more than 50 percent around the globe it's increased risk of breast cancer cervical cancer cause weight gain fibroids in the uterus fatigue enlarged breasts and Men high blood pressure blood clots look at your look at your food one second and you'll see how much soy is in everything Health Products say oh I want a nice healthy protein bar don't don't look at the wrapper if you want to have your bubble burst so when we look at all of these things that have taken place and put it forward we realize that this is Satan's design yeah this is his purpose this is what this is what he wanted to accomplish in this day and and it's maybe easy for us to see the end results but we can't miss the direction that he wants to take believers Satan has a purpose he has a plan he wants to destroy he wants to give us the wrong Vision the wrong viewpoint we've corrupted biblical norms and even within our own families I as a father have to wrestle with this I have to look at this and say this is this is my authority this is my job to do this I don't leave this to the school system I don't leave this to another another another person it's our job as parents as Mom and Dad as a dad to make sure our children are being prepared for life well we sent him to school to do that oh my goodness I hope you don't education science civilization it's all of the devil so are we sending them to be trained by the devil Tom I'm I'm not trying to tell you what to do I'm trying to preach the word and help you understand how to make choices I don't care about controlling anybody's life I got enough problems to figure out on my own but I do have to preach the word and point you to Christ and so when we look at this we have to be careful we have to be wise and what we're doing it's it's your it's your it's our job to train our children and prepare them to get married to raise families to train our sons the right way to train our daughters the right way it's our duty as fathers we can't say well that's my wife's job maybe it is but you should be there you you have to be involved you have to be there number one is we teach our children we teach our family the word of God no preacher no Sunday school can replace a father that sits down and one-on-one or in a small group with their little family teaches them about the Bible we can't be derelict in our duty young men that are just married or getting ready to get married remember that that's your duty not your wife's duty to lead the family it's your duty spiritually physically financially all of these things you don't abdicate that to somebody else the world would have us do all kinds of those things in our current culture the father's authority over his children and specifically over his daughters is little more than a joke to be made about bygone times way and back in the day it it truly is yeah yeah it's a it's a it's a it's a thing that they look at and say it's just that's just fanatical that's crazy but the Bible makes it clear that both the Sun but also a daughter is under her father's Authority until that Authority is transferred to her husband or the father dies you know we read these things we we look at it in the Bible I hope you read it in the Bible many people don't aren't doing that they listen to this they listen to that sermon but they're not studying their Bibles but the Book of Numbers clearly shows what shows us this if a woman also this is numbers 33 and 4 if women also vow a vow unto the Lord and bind herself by a bond being in her father's house in her Youth and her father hear her vow and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every Bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand verse five through seven but if her father disallow her in that day then he heareth not any of her vows or other bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand and the Lord shall forgive her because her father disallow her and if she had it all and husband when she vowed or uttered outright of her lit out of her lips where would she bound her soul and her husband heard it she held his and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it then her vows shall stand and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand he said it has to do with vows it's nothing nothing applicable to us but the big picture is from the scripture we understand the father's Authority you know we look at these things and we say well you know getting asking uh it's a polite thing to ask the fathers you know young man should ask the father's permission to speak to his daughter it's a polite thing it's not just a polite thing it's the way it must be done I promise you anyone tries to come and talk to my daughters without talking to me is going to get a phone call and be told to back up and it should be the same for every father it's your duty it's not going to be your wife it's not going to be the pastor it's not going to be another person that enforces what God's word says about it it has to be you you have to lead your family you can't abdicate that to another person a man's children are under his authority that means they're under his protection they're under his guidance they're under his provision especially a man with daughters you have to be on the watch you have to be on the lookout and if you have if you have sons teach your young men teach your sons guys don't you ever dare try to talk to a girl and go around a young man's uh uh the father's back shame on you if you do this is God's word it's not just well it's a cultural thing it's a it's God's word young man go to that father and speak to him directly like a man if if you're gonna if you're gonna be approaching a girl it means you're a man and you're ready to provide for family if you're not then sit down and learn how to do it God bless you I hope you love me still but again our culture says our children should make their own choices garbage nonsense our children have to eventually make their own choices but they're in their home when they're in my home I'm teaching them how to make the right choices and I'm making sure that the right choices are made that's my duty but it's not just a negative thing oh you're controlling they're also my daughters are under my protection they're under my provision they're under my guidance that's not a bad thing that's not a manipulative thing it shouldn't be if if that's how you're leading with manipulation shame on you that's that's the wrong thing we lead with love we lead as a servant but we lead with truth amen all right the next thing I want to speak about is again when I first came to the message and I read what the church ages book sad about brother branham's seven visions and one of them was the the horrible thing that women got the right to vote I'll be I'll be totally honest with you I was like what in the world are you talking about why because we've come so far as a society that we think okay how could how could anyone say this and why would they say that it's very offensive to say it well Jason Demars why are you saying it right now it's very offensive because we've gotten so far out of order that we hear a prophet speak and we think what in the world is he talking about must have been a different way of thinking or approaching it back way back in the day our culture is different now yeah it is different now it's it's corrupt it's destroyed and this is the place think about this Saints 1933 this prophetic word comes forth of what is spoken speaking about what happened what was happening and what was going to happen in the future it's brother Branham over and over again says this is a woman's Nation it's a woman's world the perversion of character the perversion of women and he connects all of those things together look at what we're living in look where we're living under this it's this is this word is fulfilled amen the fifth Vision had to do with the moral problem of our age centering mostly around women God showed me that women began to be out of their place with the granting of the vote listen to that God showed me it's a word from God this is where women got out of their place was when the vote was granted to them then so the vote is granted then they cut off their hair which signify that they were no longer under the authority of a man but insisted on either equal rights or in most cases more than equal rights she adopted men's clothing and went into a state of undress until the last picture I saw was a woman naked except for a little fig leaf type apron with with this Vision I saw the terrible perversion and moral plight of the whole world Amen can you say Amen it's just one of you that said amen so now I want to read to you something written by believe it or not a democratic senator from California in 1911. so this is JB Sanford chairman of democratic caucus suffrage is not a right when he says suffrage it means voting suffrage is not a right it is a privilege that may or may not be granted politics is no place for women consequently the privilege should not be granted to her the mother's influence is needed in the home now I want you to read what he says I this is incredible and I believe this is the heart of the matter and that's that this is the place where the problem came in she can do little good by getting the streets and neglecting her children let her teach her daughters that modesty patience and gentleness are the charms of a woman letter teach her sons that an honest conscience is Every Man's first political law that no Splendor can rob him nor Force justify the surrender of the simplest right of a free and independent citizen the mothers of this country can say shape the Destinies of the nation by keeping in their places and attending to those duties that God Almighty intended for them the kindly gentle influence of the mother in the home and the dignified influence of the teacher in the school will far outweigh all the influence of all the Manish female politicians on Earth the courageous chivalrous and manly men and the womanly women the real mothers and homebuilders of the country are opposed to this innovation in American political life there was a bill the Sanford bill before the last legislature which proposed to leave the equal suffrage question to women to decide first before the men should vote on it this bill was defeated by the suffragettes because they knew that the women would vote down the amendment by a vote of ten to one the men are able to run the government and take care of the women do women have to vote in order to receive the protection of man why men have gone to war endured every privation and death itself in defense of of women to man woman is the dearest creature on earth and there's no extreme to which he would not go for his mother or sister now I want you to understand that's not the world we live in anymore but as Christians what's being said here it reverberates with my soul and I believe it should be reverberate with every Christian soul to man woman is the dearest creature on earth and there is no extreme to which he would not go for his mother or sister by keeping woman in her exalted position Listen by keeping woman in her exalted position man can be induced to do more for her than he could by having her mix up in Affairs that will cause him to lose respect and regard for her woman does not have to vote to secure her rights man will go to any extreme to protect and Elevate her now as long as woman is woman and keeps her place she will get more protection and more consideration than man gets when she abdicates her throne she throws down the scepter of her power and loses her influence woman suffrage has been proven a failure in states that have tried it it is wrong California should profit by the mistakes of other states not One reform has equal suffrage effective uneffected on the contrary statistics go to show that in most equal suffrage States Colorado particularly that divorces have greatly increased since the adoption of the equal suffrage amendment showing that it has been a home Destroyer crime has also increased due to lack of mothers in the home woman is woman she cannot unsex herself or change her sphere let her be content with her lot and perform those High duties intended for her by by the great creator and she will accomplish far more in governmental Affairs that she could ever accomplish by mixing up in the dirty pool of politics keep the home pure and all will be well with the Republic let not the sanctity of the home be invaded by every little politician that may be running up and down the highway for office let the manly man and the womanly women defeat this amendment and keep the woman where she belongs in order that she may retain the respect of all mankind my goodness I thought it was so wonderful when I read that and so prophetic to our times we have lost all of this in our in our country and in our society and it's it's by the woman because when the woman gets out of her place then the man by Nature will get out of his place as well and you you look at this and you say my goodness that Demars is the oldest folk the youngest old Fogie I've ever listened to in my life this is the word of God Saints the truth is the truth whether it feels good or not and I wanna I wanna reiterate that true biblical Womanhood as the man wrote is an exalted position it's not an inferior position it's just the place and the position that God has designed for ladies to be in and it's a glorious thing how thankful those of us that grew up in homes where the mother stayed at home how thankful and how grateful as the scripture says in their the family the husband Rises up and calls her blessed and and and what uh what a tremendous thing I hold my mother in the highest honor to me to me I think uh I was asked well can't uh woman be a doctor can't she do this or do this and I said well it's not a question of can they do it of course they can do it women are extremely intelligent very capable in many spheres the question is should to me as I see what scripture is teaching us and is proclaiming over us is it gets real quiet when you start to talk about this but as we look at the scripture what does it tell what does it say that the vision for Womanhood should be what is our what does our world tell it tell us the vision is go to school dedicate education get a career and live your life right but does Scripture say that is that what scripture points us to is however I was raised however you were raised whatever position you are in I'm not trying to speak against any person right now I'm looking out at people that I love and that are precious to me I know you probably could be thinking oh he he's a uh I'm not I'm not what I'm trying to do is point you to the word I've made many mistakes as a dad but what I'm trying to do is align myself up with God's word and if I can speak something that helps young people or any of us to go on the right direction on the right path because this is as I said over and over again it's a direct attack from the enemy on God's people and things have gotten out of order things have gone the wrong direction why it's because of a lack of understanding I don't speak here as angry you idiot a bunch of idiots I speak here with compassion with love saying let's look at it by the word maybe you're older and maybe you think well I I uh I could have had a career I could have done this and look at this and look at this situation but instead I stayed at home and oh you're reading your hands about that Goodness Me you did exactly what God called you to do and don't feel don't feel bad or feel something less about it as the man said it's an exalted position amen true Womanhood is a beautiful reflection of the bride of Christ true manhood is a beautiful reflection of Christ God wants order in the home I'm going to skip ahead I covered this before Colossians 3 18-19 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the Lord husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them it speaks of the bitterness be not bitter against them it speaks of harshness or in other words your leadership shouldn't be dictatorial your leadership should be from Love and service with the vision of what God has for you to be there to be a protector and a provider and wives would of course when a husband is in that order would just rejoice in submitting to his leadership so husbands your obedience to Christ is to love your wife and be not bitter against her and why wife your obedience to the Lord is to submit your own selves to your husbands right so when we look at this this this is not something that you watch on Disney this is not something you learn about in public school this is not the direct this is not the vision that the culture gives for women for men for families but it is the vision that God himself has put forward to us now we look at Titus Chapter 2 and there's another scripture we'll look at next and and we see these things and I I believe it's it's absolutely critical we can't just leave this off and say well that was nice for another day but no it's for today Titus 2 3-5 the aged women likewise that they be in behaviors become with Holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teacher of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed my so Paul is writing to Titus a pastor of a local church and saying let this be done in the church let these things be taught so what is it this is not just well this is a that's nice Paul but well we don't really need that now no this is Paul putting forth the apostolic vision for the local church four Believers amen amen and so older women teach the younger women to do these things to be a housekeeper it doesn't say older women teach the younger women to go get education and have a career I'm just pointing out what the scripture doesn't say what I'm showing you what it does say be sober love your husband love your children be discreet chased keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that's God's vision for sisters do you like it doesn't matter if you like it or not it's God's word if you love God you'll submit your heart to the word and you'll say Amen to the word first Timothy 5 14. he says I will therefore now this is giving direction to Timothy a pastor of a local church the Christ's Vision through the Apostle Paul to the local church Timothy this is what I want you to make sure that happens make sure that the younger women marry their children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully this is the vision that one that the that God put forth to young people young people young ladies what is God saying to me what should I do what's the vision for my life get married bear children guide the house what what did it not say what Vision did it not give get a career provide for your own self you might not like me but that's this this is the vision that the that the Lord wanted to put forward to before his people guide the house it means to to rule a household manage the family Affairs under the authority of her husband that's the purpose of the wife as a helper get married bear children guide the house that's what you should do in America and Europe women have been told for the last 70 years that the path of life is to go to college get a degree and have a career and what has it done it's led to the destruction of Western society as we know it that's an absolute fact oh that's a separate issue that has nothing to do with it brother Branham said woman began to get out of her place when she started to vote it led to immodesty and it led to her being the boss seeking to be the boss of everything the Bible says that the path of life for a woman is to get married and raise Godly children and be a homemaker that's God's Vision should be our vision as well is it the truth anything that we encounter in this world anything that's told spoken to us we have to filter it through God's word that's our every one of our duty is it the truth is it biblical I don't believe that any of our sisters should be ignorant a bunch of ignorant ignorama says no have no education don't know anything but again what is education according to the Bible see in our society in our culture we think okay to go to kindergarten and then they have to do this and they don't have to do anything unless it's God's word right and the Bible certainly doesn't tell you to be an ignorant person it tells us to grow in knowledge grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ so we look at all our society high school and University and all of these things is we have to do this I know for me when I was raised is my sister went to call it graduated high school went to college four-year College my brother did the same well what was I going to do same thing just assumed upon me now you come to this place you're the dad and you're trying to search everything out by the Bible what's biblical what's the scripture say what does God want for me to teach and direct my children towards and again the first thing what does the bible tell us it says it tells us to train up your child in the way they should go and when they're old they'll not depart from it that's parents Duty it's not another person's Duty we are to do that we are to take responsibility for that and we're to make sure that that is what's happening and we as parents we give the vision of life to our children we give the direction of life to our children and we should make sure it's biblical not according to the culture not according to what this one says Science Education and civilization are all of the devil brother Branham tells us that so it's wise of us to search these things out don't just follow the patterns of the world I'm not suggesting anybody become Amish I'm not suggesting any become ignorant but in education and going to school and going to University is not the same thing in our world what what do 99 of universities do it's a simply a place for communist propaganda to be poured down their throats and in their minds and what are 99 of public schools exactly the same thing teaching and spreading perversion and lies and deception and evolution and all these different things you say well what are you telling me to do brother Jason I'm not actually telling you anything of what to do I'm just pointing you to the word you must search it out for yourself and you must know how to lead your individual children and your family what I'm pointing out is just because the the world says it doesn't mean we have to swallow it down musicians if you'd come teach your children the word of the Lord and to love to read and to learn how to educate themselves my mom was probably one of the smartest people I've ever met and she was the only person in the family that didn't have a college degree why because she read because she educated herself fathers teach your sons to work hard direct them help them find their bent help them find some type of work mothers teach your daughters how to keep a home as I said before young men learn how to work and provide for a family that's your job as growing up prepare yourself for that finish with this in the power of transformation brother Branham says and don't let the devil spray you with education and poison and stuff like that you have to be modern you have to be this amen you don't have to be nothing but Sons and Daughters of God and if you're born to the word you do amen let's stand and pray [Music] with the fire I love you your spirit [Music] and make me more like you break me Lord and bless them broken cases of my life [Music] so hard by

your have have for us see that vision you have for us Lord take your word Lord and bring bring healing bring restoration bring light and life help us to not line our thinking align your word up with our thinking but our line our hearts with your word Lord that's our desire it's not to be sprayed with the poison of this this world system but Lord to be true Sons and Daughters of God led by your
