as we invite our brother uh been here throughout the week we had some wonderful fellowship with him today uh brother Jason Brother Brad myself will on man I tell you it's not hard to realize you're around someone who really loves the Lord when you get around somebody like that it really shows and I I've always appreciated the Deep sincerity amen of our brother Don amen shows in his life in his

believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord [Music] I blessed be the name of the Lord would you bow with me please Heavenly Father we love our national anthem and truly it is our national anthem because we our citizenship is not here but it's it's you your kingdom your headship we are your subjects to do your bidding that you may be exalted in all things Lord As we sing think of the man in the scripture Lord I do believe help my unbel Lord we know this is a cleansing time as I wait on you so many times I feel like you're still cleansing me of so many little things in my life thank you that your mercies are new every morning that every single day we want pure faith in a pure word that knows nothing can Shake us nothing can sway us nothing can turn our heads even for a second from absolute confidence in you and your word that cannot fail speak to us tonight father please have your way say what you want to say do what you want to do commit the service now into your hands in Jesus name amen thanks you may be seated you may be seated too because it takes me minute thank okay um it's a clumsy time isn't it e e e e e e e and so we have to be very careful as humans what we say and how we say it because I have found over the years that words have definitions so when it comes to concrete things like Pulpit or chair no question car no question but when it comes to things of the spirit and the soul and things specifically pertaining to the things of the Lord I found some very troubling things that words are defined by experience and sometimes those experiences are not good experiences and sometimes those experiences altar so we have been many times brother Jason when you're talking to someone with every good intent in your heart to help to encourage to build and yet what I said because of the person's experiences all of the words that I said went through a filter and totally perverted everything and now I'm going to give you some examples personally from my own experience I spiritually grew up in a very my first church very troubled experience with nickel hon Spirit there and after 11 years I had to leave because I spiritually died and I didn't leave the church to run from Jesus I ran to find him again the church went from a group of about 350 people to about 10 and as they all go by on their way to the bars I said can we talk the word let's just get into the word and when I would mention the word the word they would shudder I mean visibly shutter because the word those words became a hammer and an assault and and killed them can you imagine that so here I want to do something and take them into a place of safety and growth and here they are filtering that through their own experiences and coming up with something that they can't stand so even I'm thinking if your youth camps you got to be careful on these things you don't know what's being received and how they're receiving it here's another word um been around some people had personal experiences where my Ministries there is called Grace Ministries and I the grace of the Lord is the most precious thing in my life and you been around certain people that make you feel it's like it's a dirty word like you're a compromiser that you have no backbone no stand because they are so steeped in legalism themselves that they can't stand it so here you see something very dangerous and that what God intends and what God sends is not necessarily how it is received in man and because the enemy is there and you will find that in the person's past in their own guilt or in things that maybe they haven't repented of there will be things that will alter what you say and misinterpret what you say and come back and shatter you with it um have a another example the word love Jason and I both know a young man and you mention the word love to him and he will come right out and say don't talk to me don't use that word because when I hear that word the only only thing that comes into my mind and into my heart is a defense mechanism to repulse that's repulsive to me because it means manipulation and power One Direction so can you imagine the word love being altered by the enemy that way so it becomes an offensive word so do you see what I'm saying what has the enemy done and the ministry team here you guys you have to be aware of this and spend so much time in prayer that God can fix this now another word is the word spiritual and you go to the young people even here doesn't make any any difference let's talk about spiritual things and watch them roll their eyes and they'll they'll say well you don't know what I'm facing you don't know what it's like out there you don't know what I've been through and so what is intended to help Satan has put a block in those words and misinterpreted the meaning of those words on so that they're perverted of course the last one now is just the word message okay Jason mention that to 20 people in a group out at church cat and see how many answers you get what what does the me what does the word message mean to you um sadly it depends on experiences okay so with a mess like this in the human condition and in the human Spirit now I'm thinking Body Spirit and soul because brother Brenham defines our human Spirit as our reasoning conscience memory affections and uh memory and brother Brams made it very clear that those all are have been filled by Satan so the word of God after the fall was not meant to become and being interpreted by my spirit okay and sadly enough when you preach the word and when you give the word I don't care if you're just testifying to a friend it will go to their spirit before it goes to their soul but God intends it to go to the soul the Eternal part of him to the Eternal part of you and there it's not interpreted there it only can say yes or no to it you with me so going to be very transparent again with myself and uh with all of this experience these words I was living in South Dakota and we had friends in Minnesota where I now live and uh they were I had left church when I left church I never left the message I didn't understand it but I knew it was true and God held me there and so I got my family together and every almost every night we would read scripture together and we'd pray together and we'd no matter if we were out in the woods camping on weekends or Wednesday nights we always stopped and had listen to a message and read scripture and prayed together so that never left me but I had some deep wounds because I was called everything in the book you can imagine after leaving church and so this family who lived in Minnesota said we're having a church camp and uh you have to come and I said no I don't and he'd called me up again and said yeah this is going to be a great church camp you got to come and I said no no no I don't I don't want to and uh after another month he said you're coming I said no I'm not he said you have to come he said uh my H my son has been Lo mowing lawns all summer to pay for your expenses at this Camp so he's paid for you so you got to come and I said thank you very little and begrudgingly I went and I drove into this camp with my family and when I saw a whole group of people sisters in their skirts and their long hair their message men I had a panic attack and it was all I could do I locked the doors I threw the car into reverse and I wanted to step on the gas and just squeal tires running as fast as I could away from that because what should have meant life and freedom in the spirit and growth and the love of the Lord meant everything the opposite and God had to heal me so if any of you are out there and need healing where his words can take effect in you to mean something and bring life instead of death if you can do it for me you can do it for anybody and that's I believe a promise that he's working on for all of us because I still think there's things in each one of us I know he's speaking but I don't know if we're hearing correctly how many things in my life am I filtering through my mind and my own reasoning where he's trying to speak and my mind is so busy that I'm not hearing correctly because the word is life yes Jesus said that my words that I speak unto you they are spirit and their life and if that if something am I hearing a word but nothing's happening in me and I feel dead and I feel like just going through the motions and being a church member I'm dead that are in a rock and don't know it God won't let a son or daughter stay that way CU he'll come after you so brings me to my text tonight if you have your electronic devices because it's probably easier Zephaniah chapter 3 it's been on my heart for a long time so we're going to use that for a text and one other one would just stand with me for just to honor the word now Zephaniah is a minor prophet and he was in the time of Josiah the good King but Israel had been a mess and was a mess well I've been a mess too but here in the midst of messes God brings restoration and love and healing and it's very interesting here how this healing will come so let's start at verse eight therefore wait ye upon me sayith the Lord until the day that I rise to the prey for my determination is to gather the Nations that I might assemble the kingdoms to pour out upon them my indignation what did they do they polluted his kids he loves his kids and he loves you and he doesn't like the world that's polluting our kids so is to pour out my indignation even my Fierce anger for all the Earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy the Lord God is jealous over you he loves you and he wants you in love to be in a love relationship and love him and that jealousy is fierce so verse nine would you read it out loud with me for then I will turn to the people a pure language isn't that interesting yes okay and with this language what's going to happen that they may call upon the name of the Lord to serve him with one consent yes it is and it's going to be it has to be something that happens to us before we're taken out of here because she we're going to be in one Accord and one consent okay so then we go over to verse 14- 16 sing Oh Daughter of Zion shout o Israel be glad and rejoice with all the heart oh daughter of Jerusalem the Lord hath taken away thy judgments he ha cast out thine enemy the king of Israel even the Lord Lord is in the midst of thee Thou shalt not see evil anymore and in that day it shall be said to Jerusalem fear thou not and to Zion let not thine hands be slack the Lord thy God in the midst of the mighty he will save he will rejoice over thee with joy and he will rest in his love he will Joy over with singing that's our God and isn't it interesting that the road to that is through a pure tongue a pure language that he will restore and that's what I was talking about no longer will we hear him according to my thinking or my mind or my reasoning but I will hear what he has to say and what he says is going to have all the power of himself in it to change it Hebrews 12 now Hebrews 12 is constantly going back and comparing what is going on in the spiritual realm with what went on in the children going leaving Israel and going through the Wilderness so he says you're not called to that mountain like Mount siani thank the Lord but we start in verse 20 to what we are called but you are come to Mount Zion we read about that in Zephaniah didn't we and to the city of the Living God and the Heavenly Jerusalem and to a new able company of angels and to a general assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven question what natural thing is there name one natural thing that we're called to Natural Church natural Pastor natural assembly nothing it's all spiritual Heavenly Jerusalem City of the Living God Church of the firstborn written in where to the god that judge of all and to the spirit look at this the spirits of just men made perfect there's that thing again spirits of just men but God worked on them to cleanse them to Jesus the mediator of a New Covenant and to the blood of sprink that speaks better things than that of Abel see that you refuse not him that speaks for one is speaking and one is speaking in this day and there's coming a time when we will not hear him according to our own thinking and pervert everything but we will hear him what he said and it'll go down deep into our souls and it will have such a lasting effect and such a powerful effect that will change us out of here thank you you may be seated interesting isn't it the journey that he has us on and what he's working with us on now brother Brandon preaches a message it's an early message but it's a wonderful message in it's 1954 God perfecting his church in there he draws a picture he's been talking to uh some people in his church and there was um spiritualist medium in that area and they they were asking questions about this how what Spirits working there in this he draws a picture okay and if I had a Blackboard oldfashioned days I would draw it out but he draws a whole Panorama of um spiritual Dimensions okay because even Jesus talking to the Pharisees and says I am from above you are from beneath so brother Brenham lays this out and in the middle there's this horizontal stripe that goes through here and he says see that this is where Mortals live we right here in between these two dimensions of the lower and the upper and in this Dimension he says it's he calls it a dark mass of gayy yeah you familiar with that brother Jason and he says in this dark mass of gity he says is where Mortals live and that's where we're all at and he says there's not very many but every once in a while you'll see a little light shine it and that's these people that are in the midst of darkness and that's us in this world okay he says but now watch he says it's a here's where mortal lives and he says it's a whole conglomeration of Blackness and darkness and in there is little lights placed now and then you feel outnumbered it's because you are and that's Christians Born Again of light okay born again you are the light that's set on a hill a candle that's set in a room that gives light to all the room that's where the Christian is among Darkness now he says now watch what he says here the wicked or the unbelievers influent from beneath and he says there's a trinity of hell so here's in this mid area where we're all living He says we're all influenced from some other places okay and so you got to be careful and you got to watch your children we're all being influenced right yeah from something somewhere and he said now watch The Wicked or the unbelievers influence from beneath and there's a trinity of hell and there's a trinity of heaven and they're influenced by evil Powers he says the first thing when you start down below that he says is the region of the unsaved and that's the first realm under that and those unsaved for some reason the spirits that in him he says you connect with them because your spirit connects with the spirits interesting isn't it so the spirits are there and they're in reaching up and influencing the in this realm the people and he says the next um let me just read it the first thing when you start down the first thing you find is a realm here that's got the unsaved in it that's right that's where Jesus went and preached to the souls that were in in prison and repented not at the longsuffering of the days of Noah the next is demons and the next is Hell itself the world is influenced by these demon powers through this Trinity and Christians are influenced by a spirit too the Holy Spirit first is the holy spirit above for Christians so above this layer that we're all living in is the whole Holy Spirit the next is Angels Above that and the next finally is God so here we are in the middle of all of these Supernatural forces but we're pretty dull to them aren't we I mean stop and think about it you go through the day you we need to be more aware of these things because when a thought comes to your mind is coming from some Dimension okay and what's you in allow into that Dimension from that Dimension is going to alter how you see the word or another person or what is being preached even why watch that it'll bring judgment and as much as you intend and spend time in prayer and you and me and all the others in the ministry team you can cry and pray and cry and pray and others will go out and watch the enemy work in minds and turn it against what you had in in mind sounds a little fatalistic and I don't mean to because there's a God's bringing a way out of this but sometimes the way out is to see what's there to confront it yeah okay now yeah so with that here we are he makes a strange statement though and I want to read this again he talks about the Christian is among the darkness you're supposed to shine he says the wicked or the unbeliever is influence from beneath okay the world is influenced by these demon powers through the Trinity and Christians are influenced by a spirit too the Holy Spirit now wait a minute what in the world is going on and how do I fight tell me in all honesty if you haven't felt an influence From Hell from demons right or wrong are you human are you in skin then you have but that's not what he says here he says Christians are influenced by the holy spirit it's the unbelievers and the wicked influenced from below so what is going on so here is where the Prophet did so many wonderful things or God did through his prophet in this day yeah you know we have so much to be thankful for because Let's do let's start with the most basic thing baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus how many of us have gone through years and years you got to be re-baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus do you ever explain why do you ever tell people why that's necessary do you ever tell them what is there for them it was so much more than a correction because when he baptized you into a name what is what did brother brandham says what's in your name why do you have to pray about naming your children why is it important why did he change people's names because your name is your character and your nature now think of that so people that are baptized in the name of Trinity father son Holy Ghost they have nothing and Devils travel in that name but here comes the god in this say say I got to get to my children I got to get to them I have to bring them something that they've never had before and the first thing let's show what the scripture said they have to be baptized in the name of Jesus why I want them immersed in my nature in my attributes not just a name correction so when someone is baptized into that and they said do you want the nature of Jesus do you want the attributes do you want the character of Jesus there's no other way you can get it except baptized in that precious name because that precious name carries with it everything so there's these things now that's just one of them and you can go on and on and on and we are so rich we are so blessed with so many things that he has done but one of the things is from this message but I had this with me last year what he [Applause] preached so message knoweth it not and for years and years and years I had it and two years ago the Lord said pick it up and I says I don't need to I know it he says pick it up read it I said yeah I know know it not you are you know blind naked miserable and don't know it it's a Domin Lord I'm out of denominations I don't need this pick it up yes Lord and it became new paragraph by paragraph all new so listen to the spirit even if you think you know everything you don't and even when you think you know everything he'll open more up to you and he just keeps opening up and he just keeps opening up so here is this thing in here and brother brandham is talking about people and he's talking about people that are religious but they're going by their own Human Experience they're interpreting the word through through what they think he uses an example of two women one woman is a a worldly woman she doesn't know anything about the Bible neither does she care about anything about the Bible she doesn't care about what anybody thinks she goes out and she lives with men who cares the other one is a Miss Methodist and she's a lady and she goes to church and she's fine but she still wears her shorts and and goes out and Waters the LA and goes bathing and to the swimming pool and this and that he says it's just amazing because what she is doing is an example of what's going on in the world and he says this her own thinking her own attitude about the word and she's not really hearing God she's hearing God through her filters thinking man's filter and because of listen to this it throws the whole world into Insanity I want you to think about that because this is what I was talking about in the beginning when words are interpreted by my spirit my reasoning my conscience my imaginations my affections my memories okay now I want let me stop there one quick because I was waiting I didn't understand the memory part which of you don't have bad memories which of you don't have things that you would love that you never come to your memory again now brother brandham says you have to go to these messages start out with greatest battle ever fought and then you go to things that are uh thinking men's filter and then you go to this message three of them tie them all together listen to them in that order and watch what the prophet is saying he says Satan has plugged up every one of these and they need to be purified and plugged and unplugged so that each one of these becomes a Channel of the holy spirit so my reasoning no longer becomes my reasoning it's his okay my I is not my conscience it's his conscience so what about my memory I'll show you as long as you're meming bad things here and it causes bad influences and thoughts about other people because of those bad memories it's yours because if you had his memory you would say where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy in the morning star sang together yeah there's where your memory by the Holy Ghost would take you so do you see the cleansing do you see where the still there's things in us that need to be cleansed out in the our mind and we're still hearing the word up here and brother Bram talks about these two women and he said listen it throws the whole world into Insanity the whole thing is insane and it's so gradual gradually kept until the people don't even know it now is she a prostitute not by her husband not by her own body but before God she has an evil spirit and she's a prostitute he says because she thinks because she thinks did you hear what I said because she thinks you interpret the word of God by what you said what did I start out with what do people do with the word the word what they do with the word Grace what they do with the word love what they do with the word spiritual it's interpreted by their experiences right so are they hearing and can they hear the the voice of God and what he really is trying to get across to them until that's cleaned out wow so here she is and this kind of thing that is going on in her and she is just an example of what is going on the in the world and he says that's why the world is going insane think of that it's her Insanity now here he gives you help be the prophet the Holy Spirit comes through the prophet and says I'm going to help you out because I'm going to identify things for you that you don't have to be that way anymore you can rise above it and you can have all of those channels become channels of the Holy Spirit every single one of them your affections the affections of the Holy Spirit nothing else your memories where you are in Christ okay so he talks about the Body Soul and Spirit you I'm sure you're all familiar familiar with this but he talks about the outside is the Flesh and he says that's the evil one okay and I'm sure you're familiar with this but he says the spirit in is inside that that's your five things okay he says that's of a worldly nature well does that reflect God then so here's what he says the it's a that spirit is of worldly nature because it's not given from God but it's permitted by him okay so your soul the last man is the soul there's only one sense when it comes to the word of God and that's say Amen or not to the word of God we know that so here is brother brandom here is 1937 here he's going through through the pain and Agony of losing his wife and losing his daughter and losing his father all at the same time and he goes through all of that and he talks about what Satan was doing in his head and he said but what did it do it the Holy Spirit was working from the outside to that first man what is he saying he's saying you know what I was controlled by my reasoning because I listened to the voice of my mother-in-law don't go to those people you're not going to take my daughter there well maybe I shouldn't well maybe reasoning what did he say is going to throw the whole world into Insanity that yeah right okay so brother what God is saying you know prophet you're my man but in 1937 God would not let him continue on in his ministry until he quit that and he passed that and he said no you have to come to a point where you're controlled by only soul and nothing of the spirit unless that spirit is cleansed out and become absolute channels of the Holy Ghost right so why do you think you're different why do I think I'm different I'm not he's the first one to come to maturity so something has to happen now so what he has done in favor for me he has identified what is the real me so gonna ask you guys questions you're Chris I never met you God bless you okay do you have an old nature do you have an old man we all do sure does that guy drive you crazy so is mine and don't you okay Micah don't you think he's supposed to be dead right I thought I buried him about a million times now haven't you and why does he keep resurrecting here's what brother Brenham has done for each one of us in this message when he defines the spirit and he says that's not part of God it's not from him it's a worldly nature he just gave it to you because something needs to be worked out in me that's not the real you thank God mhm so if you go look through the quotes and if I look up the words Soul okay and I have lots of quotes on them but the real you is that true right brother Jason right brother Jason he he just I never know of any place where he looks at the human spirit and says that's you no way okay so he says I need you to change your identification to what the real you is you now okay brother Andrew have you've had trouble in your life because you're a human being cuz you're in skin and your old man drives you crazy let me ask you this has have you ever had any trouble saying Amen to the word of God never why because there's a soul inside and that Soul can only do one thing Hallelujah Chris you've had a lot of trouble in your life right but some hard down deep in the anchor of your soul it has always said yes to that right that's the real you and that is a now why is the trouble go to Romans chapter 6 and I just here is where so much needs to take place even in us here we know this these are so common to us Romans 6 okay what do we know verse three know you not that so many US of were baptized were um as we're baptized into Jesus Christ we're baptized into his death what did Brother Bram teach us when Jesus died you were there didn't you die what died read verse five have we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall all be in the likeness of his res Resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him right right now you all have confessed tonight unbelief you all say my old man's driving me crazy no he isn't you all said he's alive and well he's Mak he drives me crazy you just denied the word of God do you see what's happening you were using this you were using the very thing that the word of God was not sent to it was sent to your soul that says amen and because it went to my brain it went to my brain says oh I'm having trouble therefore no what is true is that word of God in Romans is that true or not true true is that more true than you are true is that more true than your experience is true then who's the liar than Rel liing then that shows us that we're so much there's things in our bodies things in our minds things in us that's going on that are still like these people were with the word just different we're still having problems the word is being interpretated by somebody else's control love is being interpret interpreted as uh manipulation for personal gain right that's not love that's not the word but we let our experience so what's the difference between them doing that and us doing this because if my old man is dead because the Bible said it's dead then it's dead period so what's going on greatest battle ever fought it's not you it's not your old man because he's crucified but the old man this enemy comes into your mind and raises these things up and said oh that's me and as long as you can believe that enemy of what he's saying that's you he's got you and you've got to get him beyond the point because say he doesn't have me because that's not me because my old man is dead because it Jesus it was crucified in my Jesus and because of him I am set free from that because there you have to go to verse 11 read it out loud with me what does it say likewise reckon ye also why do you have to reckon if it's dead because there's a mental gymnastics and mental game and mental spiritual warfare going on saying it's not dead when it is you have to reckon it dead you go back to the enemy and you every morning when you wake up that old man's dead he comes and speak to you no that's not me my old man is dead so Satan give leave me alone because in my soul rejoices in God my savior amen so here what is just happening there Zephaniah chapter 3 I am going to restore to you a pure word that you can all be in harmony with each other and with me because you're going to get my thoughts isn't that beautiful isn't that a wonderful thing to hang on to okay now what time did I come up here am I over time you not can I read some quotes because oh this is so exciting okay I was going to read some more do you do you understand what I was getting brother brandham came dig out this message your true identification is given to you by your God saying that isn't you go read every quote you can on the the soul the real you the real you is that Eternal part that a part of God that's the real you the one that says amen and I can have all kinds of troubles down here and all kinds of things that drive me crazy and situations drive me crazy and people drive me crazy sometimes but it's mostly it's just the enemy and you got to learn to fight what you're supposed to fight because if you're fighting the wrong thing you're missing you're not going to win and that's what Satan would love to do for each one of us you're fighting the wrong thing oh Don's fighting the wrong battle and I'm out here his real enemy and he's not even fighting me true scary isn't it he's a deceiver okay so with all of this are you with me so far what we're wanting what we've seen so far is the mystery of words words words were sent by God to do something to help to edify to build me up into him okay to make me him to have that power of him in me and if I'm just going and listening to sermons and I go out and I even forget what he what was spoken and oh he sure was longwinded today and oh my goodness you know and oh I'm sorry but I get pretty hard even with my people at home I walk out of church if I would see people talking about the word after church I would die and go to heaven do you know what I've been done I've been very mean you leave here and you leave a church and you go out and say now let's get on with what we really like what's at the game who's playing what oh really I would love to see people get as excited about Jesus and my heart cries and my heart breaks because I see him much more excited about music and sports and everything else more than Jesus so what's going on brother Jason there's Warfare upon Warfare upon Warfare upon Warfare but we're not going to stay that way because we're Overcomers okay here's brother Bram again and he makes some very very strange strange statements on why he believes the word and in here he's going to open us something there's a channel for us waiting to enter into that brings us out of this realm because this realm is death this realm is a dark mass of gity mostly we surrounded by death true yeah but one of the words I mentioned that people have a hard time is the word spiritual how many times oh you think you're so spiritual you heard that before yeah if they only knew what God was trying to help them with this realm I've identified some things through scripture but this realm this Physical Realm is for assaults and trials and pain his realm look at all the men of God come on just go through the Bible just do a mental inventory real quick think of any man in this realm that wasn't assaulted and by everything and everybody okay and wasn't going through pain and wasn't going through trial his realm where the Lord's trying to bring us up to his realm the realm in the spirit the realm in the Holy Ghost is for Revelation and love and identification okay and all through the messages especially 63 on you hear the call of the Holy Spirit come up higher come up higher how many times do you hear this brother brandham tell the story of the mama Eagle calling for her baby and do you notice what he said about that Mama Eagle he doesn't go down and pick her up no she says I'm up here you come you come up here yeah because number one this is where you belong and I don't belong down there but you belong up here I can't come and get you but you can come to me and this is where the spirit keeps calling calling calling calling and it's the things of this life and your own reasonings that bring you down and keep you in this realm and he doesn't want you to stay here right someday you're going to face it and all the things that you love about this realm have to disappear you want out of here okay I want speak to you on an unusual subject but sometimes you find God in unusual things he does things in unusual ways not the usual way it's the unusual way unusual times unusual sensus he's unusual okay I want to speak on the subject why it why it had to be Shepherds this is 1964 the end of the year um then he goes on as I said last week in Phoenix it's proven that there are subjects of this Earth people passing through this building television proves that it's another dimension our naturalizing our five senses cannot pick it up it isn't that television manufactures anything it's only channels you cannot make a move of your finger or batch your eye but it's proven to be recorded forever okay I might be standing in Australia or television screen here not only that but the man can speak move his finger bat his eye even the color of the clothing that he's wearing will be be projected here on the wall and he in Africa Australia around the world there's a cycle of ether waves I cannot explain it but I know it's there I don't know anyone who could really explain it so television can pull this in and make it a reality by some instruments that they could reflect it on the wall and that same thing was there when Adam was here television when here was when Elijah sat on Mount Caramel it was here when Martin Luther the young priest throw the communion on the floor called it kosher and he said the just shall live by faith it was there then we are just fine now finding it it's also in our presence tonight as God angel supernatural being that's unseen to the Natural sense of light but someday it'll be a listen to that please someday it'll be a reality wow just as television is now and just as common now here it is odd now that's why I believe the word isn't that odd I mean can you believe it Jason would you ever get up before the people and said I television is why I believe the word but he did so what is he telling us what is going on what in the world is he seeing that he sees this is because when he sees the word he sees something that I hate to use this word but I don't know of another word a portal into an whole another dimension and a whole another realm that is there and when I the word is supposed to be that way that it opens me up to God and to angels and opens me up to Heavenly things going on in Heavenly places instead of just something that I memorize and is ink on a paper and I take it home and it has no effect on me see the difference because it's those kinds of effects that make people say don't talk to me about the word don't talk to me about love oh you think you're so spiritual because they're Minds have interpreted those words through their own experiences and corrupted the meaning of all of them so God has to come with a prophecy and said I'm going to return to you my language a pure language and I'm going to give you a word that you can hear not through your thinking but from me from me so we see that it's not television itself but the scientific medium that proves that there is an internal Dimension that is forever recorded and can listen to this can be tapped into here's where we're going 1951 message at Thy word now and here his written word bring forth of its kind if you'll just in his written word he says bring there's Blank Spot bring forth of its kind if you'll just receive it in your heart and believe it you might read the word and be such listen to this be such a scholar there we go here if there's anything that's going to destroy the world the word that's it your own thinking in might be a SC scholar till you know the ins and outs of the word but that will never do no no it will do no good until it becomes quickened to you and if you only knew one word and it's quickened then that's what you need just one word quickened now I want to give an illustration he says so that the children children can understand let's take him speaking 2,000 years ago so imagine right now Jesus maybe Sermon on the Mount whatever let's take him illustration so the children can understand let him speaking 2,000 years ago them words are floating in the air okay and if I would raise up this Bible and they would hit against the side of this Bible and I would turn around and if you can tune down some kind of an instrument that would pick up his words that he spoke literally you could hear it coming through the television set or something or 2,000 years ago when he was there it would be just like it is here now what's he trying to get me to see let's go on the word is a living present tense word so same as in Genesis it is God purposed it's God's power to accomplish that for which it was set okay this is from the message Fellowship 1955 then I think that whenever this Soul leaves the body we can go into another house not made with hands we go into the presence of God and their Tabernacle with him in the presence of the Lord Jesus I'm in all om he's all omnipresent and if he then if he is we are then when we go into a new Tabernacle over here wherever two or more are gathered and I'll be in the midst he's bound to be here this afternoon just as sure as there's a heaven and an earth Jesus is present now but what if he's in an unseen condition we can't see him but there's something about the Christian soul that when a man realizes he's in the presence of God is standing in the presence of something that he can't see we know there's a radio going through here now there's television going through here our eyes can't pick it up because it's another world and so the angels of God go around this room watching this place and the angels of God are encamped around those that fear Him Jesus is all present all the time watching over us I know that to be the truth I think of when Elijah down here in Dothan when the gesi went out and looked over and oh there's a whole Syrian Army look at them they've done got the city compassed about and we're surrounded and he said God open this boy's eyes right and he saw angels of fire when the Christian Believers can believe that present now right now sitting here sitting here in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in Christ Jesus fellowshipping around the word of God the holy spirit is here taking the word of God by Vision listen to this moving it out into every heart like that as the word is going forth and every believer is receiving it this is where the Holy Spirit has to take us where we here not only what he says but what he means and the me thought behind the words so we don't have to interpret according to my experience and pervert everything 1963 flashing red light of his coming I remember if there was a microphone sitting right here where this is and I was brought casting down to the world and the people around the world would hear my voice before it even got across this Pulpit to you that's electronics and you know that voice Never Dies it'll never die science in 20 years if they can pro pro progress as they have now they'll pick it up the literal voice of Jesus Christ when he was on Earth in 20 years from now because it's like dropping a pebble on a pond the little waves may may finally fade out of your sight but science claims they'll go back to One bank across the ocean to another and back and forth they will never die and neither does the word that you speak it'll meet you on the day of judgment and will condemn you or save you and you'll never be able to get away from any of it and we are conscious it's coming right through this room right now now is pictures of people if you don't believe it turn on your television and there's voices of people yet your senses won't pick them up now they've got a sending station and a magnetic pole and a tube and a crystal that picks up those voices and reproduces them and now the only thing the Bible is is this the word of Jesus Christ that he spoke they are listen to me they're literally a lie just like any other word in this world tonight listen if your heart has been cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ and becomes a receiving set from the sending set he's the same yesterday today and forever listen he does the same thing he did cuz his words can't die they're living forever more listen please you don't have to wait 20 years you can receive it right now do you know what he's saying listen God spoke you know you know it sound waves right Satan came in there with Eve and broke put a little slice in there and disrupted the whole life of it something had to come along in this day Zephaniah 3 something had to be restored the word had to be restored spoken word is the Original Seed it had to come a point where somebody would receive it the way it was meant not through a man's thinking not through somebody's interpretation of what it meant but what God meant and that happened again this day and brother bre is saying if my heart is blood if my heart is cleansed by the blood of Jesus right now I can get into that realm with my God by the Holy Ghost and I can literally get into that hear those that actual voice of God when you get into the actual voice of God the very voice of God in the beginning and Genesis Let There Be was in those sound waves huh what was it those sound waves that when those sound waves carried the life of God those sound waves carried the power of God those sound waves carried the nature of God and all of a sudden because of what was in those sound waves universes than Earth than whales that's the power that's there and that's that creative power of God that says do I'm not going to leave you like you are because I saw you before the foundation of the world and you're going to enter into that voice and you're going to become me and that's where it is and that's how we have to get in there to enter apart from our thinking if brother random had to be moved to the first man so the soul was in control so do I and so do you and if using my thinking and I'm a human using his thinking is throwing the whole world into insanity and is making that religious woman a prostitute in the eyes of God tell me my thinking isn't doing the same W tell me there doesn't doesn't have to be some kind of cleansing with this and now he's telling me now I don't have to wait till 20 years this is 1963 now I don't have to wait now there's something inside of me God has made a way that I can go by the spirit of God and I can put on those tapes I can go into my Bible and he transports me up yeah into that place where the holy spirit is speaking and all of a sudden the power of God comes in me oh there's changing power real oh I don't have to be the sinner anymore oh I don't have to be down in this realm anymore oh I don't have to feel this pain and this hurt of Trials no he's transported me up where there's glory and Revelation and identification that says you're my son yeah you forgot you had spiritual Amnesia and you forgot who you were but now you weren't meant to be there you were meant to be up here with me you belong up flying you belong up in these Realms you belong here and let all of a sudden you can hear my voice and all the power that it is and that's transforming power this is what a change huh do you want to live forever in words that have no meaning or no power behind them do you want to live in words that are perverted that lost all of their meaning that what God Said send them to because of people's experiences and Minds something has to transport us above all this into the wonderful power of God last quote 1965 Paradox message he says Lord me let me be only conscious of one thing your presence here with us he says Lord Jesus you are a paradox thou are a par Paradox when God was made flesh I pray heavenly father that you will manifest yourself this afternoon proving to us here today not only proving to us there is I suppose 90% or more of the people that believe every word but that we might see you again there's a difference there I believe every word and seeing him because there's a connection there's a place in the spirit you travel to right and let know that that word that you spoke is still traveling around the world and around and around the world just like a record let us move into that record today let us move in so he's telling you I can do this okay I'm not putting something AB above you that you can't go into the spirit of God is making us a way to do things we've never done before and what these things are necessary to us right let me start again I'm sorry and let know that this word that you spake that's still traveling around and around the world just like a record let us move into that record today Lord let us move and not hear it just like it was coming secondly from a man's mouth what's that telling me I have to go beyond the prophet I have to go past the man past the vehicle he's using and something in my soul is reaching up into the very heart and soul of God past the vessels okay yeah okay now brother Brenham warned the people okay unveiling of God there was a time when it was death to go through that Veil now it's death not to and most people are still caught in the veil that reveals him but we have to go beyond that let them hear not like it was secondly from a man's mouth but let that mouth and that person and that people become your word they have tapped in to the voice and those sound waves that God God spoke before the foundation of the world that carries all of the power of God and all the nature of God and all the character of God and that creative power that spoke worlds into existence is now speaking sons of God into manifestation let's pray Lord here we are and you've laid things out so beautifully for us and we need a cleansing from our human spirit and our minds and our own thinking and we need you so that we can hear you Lord not through our thinking or what we want or what we agree with or what we like but hear and be corrected and hear things with power that we've never experienced before because your word will not return unto you void it will accomplish that for which you sent it Lord we offer ourselves up to you help us Lord thank you for giving us an identification of who we really are we're Sons not we will be we are but you've given us the power to live as Sons to shine forth in this world as [Music] Sons to express you to the world as Sons oh God let there not be anything in us that would project anybody around around us that we love this realm more than your realm that we are more happy with things down here than we are happy with things above oh God forgive [Music] us oh have mercy on us Lord let it be that you and you alone are the joy and rejoicing of our heart we don't need entertainment we don't need the things that the world needs because you've raid us up and made us to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus there's no Greater Joy No Greater thrill no greater desire than that oh bring us to a place where we can hear you and where your word will be totally heavy it's effect on us father is our prayer we ask it in Jesus name [Music] Amen Let Your [Music] Word in manger of my heart let it live in me let it stop live inside this house of clay and it every day let your word be born in the manger of my heart oh let your your word be born in the m danger of my heart let it live in me let it St live inside this house of clay and mold it every day let your word be born in the manger of my heart aren't you glad for a cleansing power am my that was so much to chew on Brother Don I'm going to May I've already purposed in my mind I've got markers where I want to go back and hear exactly how you made some of those those points again right there near the end in summing up if as as he was saying if if there's an ability for the God of this evil age and I'm just putting it in my words to take a woman who was not actually insane but actually make her act insane brother Ram said they take their clothes off that's like Legion that's insanity and get out and you know in her little clothing and she she she's actually now not a prostitute but actually now she is a prostitute and then and then if that same thing can take the world of sensible normal people with intelligence at an all-time high and actually make them just insane to where sensible people do things near the end time and it's happening around us now that are just insane the world has gone complet completely insane and and if that is something that can attack their Spirits because they have no cleansing agent then then don't we need our Spirits cleaned by the washing of the W the word constantly have our mind washed clean by the washing of the water of the word to clean our minds constantly that you're going to need that friends as long as you live in this [Music] flesh you know long as you live in this flesh I'm glad that the real me has already passed from Death To Life wasn't that wonderful you know I I preached many years ago brother Don many years ago I think it was might have been the third or fourth or fifth sermon I preached just a young man and I preached a sermon no it was probably more than that but I hadn't been preaching very long and I preached a sermon called the Great Soundwave and I was thinking about it as you were talking about that creative power of God and brother brandom actually talking about the sound waves of Jesus you know that you know and I and I remember brother Jason taking and I went into the scientific realm of it and how the many things they use sound waves in and you know they they can they can take sound and they can come along a reservoir and here you have this Great Wall holding back all of this water tons and tons and metric tons and tons and millions of tons of metric tons of pressure and water and the wall can look ever so fine and it doesn't look like it has any problems with it at all but they actually go along that thing ever so often and they've got like a sonar that fires sound waves into it and it bounces back off the backside and comes back through and they get a reading and they can see a flaw inside that doesn't show on the outside and I just I thought this I'm glad that a great sound wave came from on high that I might think I'm fine but it can go inside of me and come back and go now there's a flaw there you need to deal with oh my and then we went into the medical field and how they can use sound waves to heal you know bust up all kinds of stones and things Amen brother Andrew you're familiar with that amen and uh my sound is a great thing I'm glad I Heard a Voice I'm glad I heard I had a whole Litany of examples but I just remember uh how what a blessing and that brought that back to my memory tonight you know brother brandom made this quote and I thought about this quote you didn't quote it but I thought about it as you were preaching [Music] because something's got to bring us to that point friends something's got to get us to Zephaniah 3 what a beautiful foundational scripture to start that kind of a sermon on and if you go back and you read that again in Zephaniah the words were so beautiful how that he's going to turn the people back to Pure language that they may all call upon the name of of the Lord to serve him with one consent so brother brandham said it like this Christ is a mystery God revealed why do you hunger Church why do you thirst now I'm glad he didn't just ask us a question he gave us the answer it's the father trying to reveal his hidden secret to you now watch here's the now that's what's happening that's what's up but now let's talk about the problem here's the rub but you let so many things get that out of you now here's things that trouble our here we're getting to what troubles our spirit troubles our mind you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of the world you let some Pastor you let somebody else get get that out of you when you know way down in your heart you're thirsting hungry I can so identify with that watch it's God trying to reveal it to you see and he says it like this the Revelation the last day is here and so to me when I read that quote he points to the solution of this terrible conundrum that there's so many things in the world we have a thirst and a hunger for God but so many things interfere with that and he says God is sending a solution in the last day to fix this problem and it's a revelation of the word in the last days I'm going to tell you something Friends when the on that morning all those problems will have been solved Hallelujah I'll be past all of that amen it won't be nothing taking that out of me anymore nothing hindering me anymore come on and gather you few brothers that are here amen leave the Machinery running back there and come on up here guys in the booth if you can maybe you might need to leave one one guy back there in case something would catch on fire but amen and and I know you
