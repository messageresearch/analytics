[0:00] to be in the house of the Lord. Uh if we
[0:01] could just stand and open up with a word
[0:04] of prayer.
[0:08] Heavenly Father, we just come before
[0:10] you, Lord. Now, we thank you for this
[0:11] day. Father, we are always so grateful
[0:14] to be able to come into the house of the
[0:15] Lord and be able to learn of you, Lord
[0:18] Jesus. Father, we just Lord, remember
[0:21] that Father and all things, Lord, we can
[0:23] learn of you, Lord, for
[0:26] Father, we have many burdens upon our
[0:28] heart, Lord, but you can of all those
[0:29] things, Lord, just a moment in your
[0:31] presence, Father. May you just come and
[0:33] saturate us today, Lord, from this
[0:35] Sunday school lesson to the Lord,
[0:38] ministry of music, to the ministry of
[0:39] the word. May you speak to our hearts,
[0:42] Lord Jesus. We just lay aside all those
[0:45] weights, Father, the besetting things
[0:46] that Lord may be hindrances to us,
[0:49] Father. Lord, may none of us be a
[0:51] hindrance to the service today, Lord.
[0:53] Help us just to be able to, Lord, just
[0:55] find your mind for the word. Lord, may
[0:57] you just help move me out of the way,
[0:59] Father. You, Lord, see the thought that
[1:01] you laid upon my heart. May you just
[1:02] open it up to your people. Lord, just
[1:04] this teaching, this Lord, this lesson,
[1:07] Father, may it just speak to the hearts
[1:09] of these believers this morning, Father.
[1:12] May you open up our hearts and our minds
[1:14] to receive from you. May you quiet our
[1:18] spirit, Lord. May you just forgive us of
[1:20] our shortcomings and our sins, Lord, and
[1:22] our failures. We want to remember and
[1:25] thank you for all that you are doing in
[1:28] our lives, Lord Jesus, currently. We
[1:30] love you and we ask it all in Jesus
[1:31] name. Amen. God bless you. Go ahead and
[1:35] turn in your Bibles to Luke chapter 10.
[1:41] We're going to read just four verses of
[1:43] scripture.
[1:51] Luke chapter 10 and verse 38
[1:57] over here.
[1:59] Luke 10 and 38. It says, "Now it came to
[2:03] pass as they went that he entered into a
[2:06] certain village, and a certain woman
[2:10] named Martha received him into her
[2:12] house. And she had a sister called Mary,
[2:15] which also sat at Jesus's feet, and
[2:18] heard his word.
[2:20] But ma Martha was cumbered about much
[2:23] serving, and came to him, and said,
[2:25] Lord, dust thou not care that my sister
[2:28] hath left me to serve alone? Bid her
[2:32] therefore that she help me? And Jesus
[2:34] answered and said unto her, Martha,
[2:36] Martha, thou art careful and troubled
[2:41] about many things, but one thing is
[2:44] needful, and Mary hath chosen that good
[2:47] part, which shall not be taken away from
[2:50] her. I bless you as you take your seats
[2:52] this morning. Just have a really simple
[2:55] thought, a simple lesson if that's all
[2:57] right. I was reading this story in the
[2:59] gospels and it just some things just
[3:01] were opening up in my heart and I just
[3:03] want to break it down and grab a few
[3:04] things from it this morning as the Lord
[3:05] was dealing with me on it. So there in
[3:07] this in this story, Jesus visits this
[3:10] place and he begins to teach in this
[3:12] home. And here's Martha, you know, one
[3:14] of the sisters of Lazarus, and she's
[3:17] doing what she normally would be doing,
[3:19] right? She's just busy working, tending
[3:22] to the needs of the house. But Mary, her
[3:24] sister, in this instance, she recognized
[3:26] that there was an opportunity. So she
[3:29] laid aside everything that she was doing
[3:32] and she was just sitting at the feet of
[3:34] Jesus, you know, just hungry to hear the
[3:36] word. And Martha, she became so
[3:40] flustered and frustrated at the
[3:43] situation. And she was actually she was
[3:45] upset that that Mary wasn't helping her
[3:48] and and even angry that she was the only
[3:50] one that was doing any of the work. And
[3:52] she became so troubled at that that she
[3:55] actually says to Jesus, "Lord, don't you
[3:56] care that my sister has left me here to
[3:59] do all the work, you know, tell her to
[4:01] tell her to help me." And Jesus just
[4:03] replies so simply, just a gentle rebuke.
[4:06] The Lord's good at that. Gently rebuking
[4:09] us. Amen. And he just said, "Martha,
[4:10] thou art careful and troubled about many
[4:13] things, but one thing is needful, and
[4:16] Mary hath chosen the good part, which
[4:19] shall not be taken away from us." And I
[4:20] thought about how
[4:22] uh often we can any of us can suffer
[4:25] from Martha's condition. You know, we
[4:28] get so busy going and doing that we miss
[4:31] the most important thing and that's just
[4:32] being in the presence of the Lord. Mary
[4:35] in this instance, you know, like I was
[4:37] saying, she was able to slow down and
[4:39] and put tasks aside and and just
[4:42] saturate herself in the presence of the
[4:44] Lord. Something that sticks out to me is
[4:46] is, you know, Mary, she wasn't so
[4:49] concerned
[4:51] with Martha and what she was doing, but
[4:54] on the other side, Martha was
[4:56] overwhelmingly concerned with Mary's
[4:59] condition. You know, I know I'm just
[5:00] going to take some simple things from
[5:02] this. Um, and yet Jesus discerned in
[5:06] that that Martha was the one that was
[5:08] troubled. Right? So, I want to get into
[5:10] this in a little in a few minutes, but
[5:12] but my desire and our desire should be
[5:14] to be in Mary's condition. Amen. And and
[5:16] there's a balance in this. You know, we
[5:18] don't we don't want to be so overly
[5:20] concerned with someone's else someone
[5:23] else's condition and someone else's
[5:25] position. And yet, we're not even in the
[5:27] place that we need to be in.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. The the Lord Jesus himself, the
[5:32] king of the world, was in her house.
[5:35] Yet, she wasn't even in the same room as
[5:37] him. and her sister was. And you know, I
[5:40] I was telling Joy extrapolating a lot
[5:43] from this, but it's just how the Lord
[5:44] dealt with me. Um, you know, and I'm not
[5:47] saying don't be concerned with other
[5:49] people's spiritual walks. You know, I
[5:51] believe we ought to pray for our
[5:53] brothers and our sisters and and um you
[5:56] know, especially if you if you recognize
[5:57] that there's clear struggles in their
[5:59] life, you know, we ought to pray for
[6:01] them. We ought to bear each other's
[6:02] burdens. We ought to lift them up in
[6:04] prayer. We ought to go to that brother,
[6:05] that sister, help them out in any way we
[6:08] can.
[6:10] Um, but we ought to be more concerned
[6:12] with our own spiritual walk. Amen.
[6:14] Before we go pointing fingers at our
[6:16] brother, our sister. Um, you know, how's
[6:19] that saying go? It says, you know, one
[6:21] finger pointed out is three fingers
[6:23] pointed in, right? So, you know, not my
[6:26] brother, not my sister, but me, oh Lord,
[6:28] that's that's just standing in the need
[6:30] of prayer. It's important not invaluable
[6:34] time examining anyone else's spiritual
[6:37] condition when we need to be focused on
[6:42] what the Lord has for us. Amen. Because
[6:45] it's not going to cause any growth in
[6:47] your life when you're focused on someone
[6:49] else's condition and someone else's
[6:50] position. Now, there's again there's a
[6:52] balance in that. You know, fathers and
[6:54] mothers, we we are concerned with our
[6:57] wives and our our our children and our
[6:59] and our husbands and and I get that. But
[7:01] you know in a in the spiritual side of
[7:04] things when it comes to the individual
[7:06] affair with the Lord Jesus Christ we are
[7:08] to be more concerned with us than than
[7:11] them. Amen.
[7:13] &gt;&gt; Because it is an individual affair. Um,
[7:16] one of the most uh valuable lessons, you
[7:18] know, in the story is just a simple fact
[7:21] that you can grow that we grow and we
[7:25] can grow and learn the most when we're
[7:28] just sitting at the feet of Jesus
[7:30] spending time in his presence, you know,
[7:32] when you're just closing off your mind
[7:35] to the world. Um, you know, being in a
[7:38] condition like Martha was in, it can
[7:41] really cause cause you to be blinded to
[7:44] spiritual matters because when your
[7:46] focus is so natural and so earthly, you
[7:50] know, you're not even able to to to
[7:53] see what the Lord wants you to see,
[7:55] you're you're closed off to spiritual
[7:57] matters. And we live in a time where
[7:59] where we're so busy all the time and
[8:00] it's go go go. But as believers, it's
[8:03] it's just vital that we set us we set
[8:05] aside time in our day and set aside time
[8:08] in our week where we can shut the world
[8:10] down
[8:12] &gt;&gt; and and the world around us. And it not
[8:14] not just church. Amen. It's not just it
[8:16] can't it can't be just something playing
[8:19] in the background either. It's got to be
[8:21] a communion with the Lord because it'll
[8:24] be those times that the Lord can
[8:26] actually minister to you. You know, you
[8:28] can actually go to church and still be
[8:31] in Martha's condition.
[8:33] &gt;&gt; You can actually be listening to a
[8:35] message and still be in Martha's
[8:37] condition. You can actually be reading
[8:39] your Bible. You can actually be doing
[8:42] the things that that you need to be
[8:44] doing and still be in Martha's condition
[8:46] because there is a there is an
[8:49] atmosphere that you create around
[8:51] yourself. And when you don't separate
[8:53] yourself from the world for a moment
[8:55] because we are in this world, but we're
[8:57] not of this world, we have to create an
[8:59] atmosphere around us so that the Lord
[9:01] can actually be in our presence. Amen.
[9:04] And that we can be in his and that's
[9:06] where we're going to do the most growing
[9:08] and do the most learning. Amen. Um
[9:12] you know,
[9:14] you're off in another place. Even if
[9:16] you're present, even if you're there,
[9:19] you're not present. Amen. And there's a
[9:21] difference. Um,
[9:23] you know, Mary and Martha were in the
[9:26] same house, yet they were a million
[9:29] miles away from each other in in just
[9:31] this in this simple story. Um,
[9:37] you can keep a wall up to the Lord to be
[9:41] able to come in and take away your
[9:43] troubles and minister to your needs. You
[9:45] know, when he when he told Martha that
[9:48] that Mary had chosen the better way, he
[9:51] wasn't saying that Mary was somehow
[9:55] superior because she had done that.
[9:59] He was offering her the answer to her
[10:02] problem. I know that's simple, but the
[10:04] Lord isn't the author of confusion. He
[10:06] works in simple ways to fix complex
[10:08] problems. Amen. And many times he
[10:10] already has a solution to whatever
[10:13] problem that you're facing or whatever
[10:14] question you have. Um but somehow as
[10:17] humans we just make it more complex
[10:19] sometimes than it needs to be. You know,
[10:21] the Lord works in in simple ways. Amen.
[10:23] If you have a question in your heart, he
[10:26] has the answer. If you have a need, he
[10:27] has a solution. You step into his
[10:29] presence and you let down your guard.
[10:32] And you know, I'm sure Mary had to fight
[10:35] against some of her own self so that she
[10:37] could sit there, you know, and and
[10:39] listen to the Lord. You know, you have
[10:41] to fight against yourself because we
[10:42] have a nature and our nature just tends
[10:46] to to be busy and it tends to be
[10:49] thinking about other things and it tends
[10:51] so it's an active process and I've said
[10:53] that here before. It's an active process
[10:55] that it takes for you to be here and to
[10:58] be present here or to be in fellowship
[11:01] with the Lord. It's an active process to
[11:03] set aside your thoughts, to lay aside
[11:05] those things, and to let the Lord come
[11:07] and minister to you, you know, and and
[11:10] Mary, she was just as as human as
[11:12] Martha, she probably had as just as many
[11:14] problems as as she did, but she wasn't
[11:16] the one pointing fingers in this story.
[11:19] Um, you know, when we we we go to start
[11:22] pointing fingers at other people, but we
[11:24] ought to put the microscope on our own
[11:26] lives first. Amen.
[11:28] something that can also happen um when
[11:32] we're trying so hard to do something or
[11:35] to attain something by our own works.
[11:39] Even if in those things our intention is
[11:41] to please the Lord, we can often miss
[11:43] the mark alto together. Amen. Because
[11:47] you know you you could you could read
[11:49] the Bible from cover to cover but the
[11:52] Lord has to give you the revelation of
[11:53] Jesus. The Lord has to reveal these
[11:55] things to you. So, it takes more than
[11:58] just words on a page. It takes it to
[12:00] become a reality in your life. You have
[12:02] to let the Lord
[12:04] open it up to you. Um
[12:07] Martha, you know, even though I was,
[12:09] like I was saying, she had the right
[12:10] intention and was trying to do a service
[12:12] for the Lord, right intentions can
[12:14] sometimes lead us astray. You know, I
[12:17] don't know how that saying goes.
[12:20] Paved road to intentions of a paved road
[12:22] or lead you to hell or something like
[12:24] that. I'm not sure how that goes.
[12:26] um right intentions can lead us astray
[12:28] oftent times because in our heart we
[12:30] think we're doing what's right. But the
[12:31] Lord didn't need her to do that. He
[12:33] needed her to do something else. So we
[12:34] have to be able to discern what the Lord
[12:36] has for us right now. Um you know and
[12:40] and uh another thing I wanted to look at
[12:41] from this from this story, you know,
[12:45] Mary, I'm sure had a little bit of
[12:47] discernment to know that her sister
[12:50] wasn't exactly happy with what she was
[12:52] doing, right? used to read between the
[12:54] lines. You know, when we live with
[12:56] someone, we're around that person all
[12:57] the time. You can pick up on things, you
[13:00] know, maybe other people wouldn't
[13:01] exactly pick up on. You catch your
[13:03] feelings um in matters before they
[13:06] express it. You catch how they feel
[13:07] about it. You know, you you see it in
[13:09] their reactions. You see it in their
[13:10] face. So, you you know their facial
[13:12] expressions. You know, when they're
[13:13] upset, you can just read that person.
[13:16] But one thing, you know, that you notice
[13:17] that that didn't hinder her decision to
[13:20] stay in her position. Amen. at the feet
[13:22] of the Lord and continue to do what
[13:25] she's doing. And just pulling something
[13:26] out of that, I thought this this meant a
[13:28] lot to me because how often times do
[13:31] people base what they do on how others
[13:34] are responding, right? Really think
[13:36] about that for a minute because pressure
[13:37] is a real thing, right? Even in even in
[13:40] church, we can't let another person's
[13:42] reactions or their feelings be the
[13:45] driving force in our decisions, right?
[13:47] Because if you're not careful, that
[13:49] person's feelings or that person's
[13:51] reaction,
[13:53] you know, their hindrances in this case,
[13:55] they can influence your actions. And by
[13:58] that pressure, it can actually have a
[14:01] serious negative effect in your life and
[14:03] become your hindrance. Their hindrance
[14:05] now has become your hindrance because
[14:07] you have let the effect of whatever
[14:09] emotion they're feeling come upon you.
[14:12] You know, that's that's pressure. You
[14:13] know, it's just a it's pressure. And to
[14:16] unpack that, we can't let um other act
[14:20] other people's actions, it it can't be
[14:21] the driving force in any decisions that
[14:24] you make. Amen. You know, and there's
[14:27] there's a discomfort in that sometimes
[14:28] when you're in a situation where it's
[14:30] uncomfortable, but
[14:33] the gospel isn't here to please
[14:35] everybody, you know. It's it's it's here
[14:37] to wash you clean. It's here to get you
[14:39] right in right standing with the Lord.
[14:41] It's here to it's here to change you,
[14:43] right? So sometimes there's going to be
[14:45] uncomfortable situations. You're going
[14:47] to find yourself where you have to say
[14:49] or do something to rid yourself of a
[14:51] situation and you may be able to read
[14:54] that that person is uncomfortable. But
[14:56] that's okay. You know, I'm here to have
[14:59] the Lord change me. I'm not here because
[15:01] you you're feeling a certain type of
[15:03] way. Amen.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Martha, you know, she was under this
[15:07] certain type of pressure and that she
[15:10] had to do something, that she had to be
[15:11] something. And Jesus caught that in her
[15:13] spirit and said, "Martha, thou art
[15:15] careful and troubled about many things.
[15:18] Her sister's thought didn't become her
[15:20] own thought." So, she didn't let that
[15:21] negatively influence her. And and you
[15:25] know, um
[15:28] something here that the people that are
[15:30] closest to us, they are most times the
[15:33] most and of course this is just natural,
[15:35] they're the most influential in your
[15:37] life. And that can be positive or it can
[15:41] be negative. Amen. So you have to uh I
[15:44] thought that was just an important point
[15:45] because when when the Lord is trying to
[15:47] deal with you individually, the the
[15:50] enemy always has a way about bringing
[15:54] something negative to discourage you,
[15:57] right? Or to to try to distract you from
[15:59] whatever it is that the Lord's dealing
[16:01] dealing with you in your life or to get
[16:03] you focused on on something else. You
[16:07] know, if there's if there's something
[16:09] spiritually po positive happening in
[16:12] your life, you rest assured that the the
[16:14] devil has an active plan to hinder it.
[16:18] Amen. And um I'm just I'm glad that
[16:22] there's a there's a way to to fight
[16:24] against that. Amen. To stay close to the
[16:26] presence of the Lord, to allow him to
[16:30] continue to change us. And just
[16:32] recognize, I know this is just simple
[16:33] thought this morning, but just to be
[16:35] able to recognize that when you're in
[16:38] the house of the Lord or when you're you
[16:40] have an opportunity to be in his
[16:42] presence, don't let things negatively
[16:45] influence you. Don't let pure pressure
[16:48] influence you. Just let the Lord deal
[16:51] with you in whatever way he's going to
[16:53] deal with you because God is he's Matt
[16:57] talk about that. God is a God of
[16:59] variety. He might deal with you
[17:00] differently than he deals with you. He
[17:02] might deal with you differently. He's He
[17:04] got a hold of my life and he's going to
[17:06] get a hold of your life, but he might do
[17:07] that in a different way. And you know,
[17:10] just let the Lord be who he is. Amen.
[17:13] And recognize that wherever you're at,
[17:17] whatever you're doing, the enemy is
[17:19] always going to try to try to distract
[17:21] you from it. But just fight through that
[17:24] and just let the Lord just continue to
[17:27] to change it. Amen. Let's just pray.
[17:29] Heavenly Father, we just thank you for
[17:30] this day. We thank you for your word.
[17:32] Lord, we just ask that you could just
[17:34] come and Lord speak to us through the
[17:36] ministering of your word. Lord, help us
[17:38] today just to Father overcome ourselves
[17:41] and and and just hear from you. Lord, we
[17:43] love you and we ask it in Jesus name.
[17:45] Amen.
