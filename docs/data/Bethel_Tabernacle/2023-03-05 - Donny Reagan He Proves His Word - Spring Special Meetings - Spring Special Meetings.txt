for the ungodly don't we appreciate him today this is power is together Heavenly Father for many of us we've been singing about this love and talking about it for decades of Our Lives and it's still so moves us when we think about it it wants you to know how much we love you today it's not a Marvel that I could love you and how could you love me and I know when you look at me you look at these people you're today it's not so much our all Humanity that you love but it's that part of yourself Lord Jesus we thank you dear God I pray today that you would help us that we would be able to walk out of this building today after these meetings hopefully something's been said that'll help each of us to be better better equipped better people better Christians we know there's not much time left for the last seed to be illuminated I'm reminded of the words of your Prophet as you set it down in Tampa in 1964 and he said we wonder why things aren't moving along and he said maybe it's like this there's a little girl or a little boy that was born over in Seattle Washington that book holds their name the church WIll slug along play along have meetings and so forth until that child is old enough to receive it that's how much you love one of yours father you can't take the 99 and leave one you've got to take all your seed home Lord if there's one here today that's not ready one that's maybe saved and just not filled with the Holy Ghost would you get your children ready Lord so we can leave this place ask your father in the name of Jesus take your word and speak to us give us ears to hear Hearts to receive we ask you father in Jesus name amen amen thank you Lord praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus Mark chapter 5. verse 22. I want to say it's been such a privilege for Carol and myself and our two oldest granddaughters I think Courtney got to come down and be with us on this trip and we've certainly enjoyed being here an opportunity I always enjoy being my brother brother Jason don't get to see him that much anymore we're all so busy everybody's got so much going on but counted a great privilege to be able to be with the saints of God I know of no higher honor than to be able to speak to the Queen of Heaven it's a great privilege to be able to do that I'd like to ask you if you'd be remembering our daughter Erica she'll be going down Wednesday to Nashville and then we'll be taking another one of these treatments that they're giving or and it's a very serious thing that they do it's called ludothera they bring it out on a cart in a lead case because it's so radioactive after she takes it she remains radioactive for 30 days her daughters can't be around her for several several days because it could affect them being girls she certainly needs prayer and we're believing the Lord we serve almighty God no one amen so if you would I know you have so much to pray about as well during this day but if you just remember her we certainly would appreciate it and I know you have I know it's not something that you just start doing Mark chapter 5 verse 22. and behold there come us one of the rulers of the synagogue Jarius by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet and besought him greatly saying my little daughter well that's the point of this how pretty thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed then she shall live and Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him may the Lord bless his word you may be seated keep your Bible there if you would and read with me in verse 38. he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and seeth of tomal and them that wept and wailed greatly and when he was come in he saith unto them why make ye this ado and weep the damsel is not dead but sleepeth I want to ask you if you would have been in that scenario what would you have thought about this statement and this man who made this statement so say it was your daughter or your niece or somebody in the church family somebody that you knew one of your friends and you walk in and there the child is dead it's evident there's no breath there's no respiration there's no heart rate there's absolutely nothing at all and Ian walks this guy which has a very strange reputation among the people he's thought of to be very very odd individual and he says hey don't y'all cry everything's good it's okay she is not dead well you're saying everything that you know about deaths testifies that she is dead there's nothing about life looking at her the damn soul is not dead but sleepeth now he's using two two streams of language he's using his Divine language but he also is using the Earthly language and this is where it can become tricky sometimes and they left him to scorn but when he had put them all out he'd taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were with him and interest into where the damsel was lying he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her talise Kuma which is being interpreted damsel I say unto thee arise and straightway the damsel arose and walked so she was at the age of 12 years and they were astonished was great astonishment now I'd like to speak to you this morning on just a simple salt he proves his word now he had said to jerice that if you will believe you'll see God do something in your home now that was the word of God And yet when he got to the house and it seemed that what he had said there's no way for it to come to pass but the word had already been spoken so now he must act on that word and prove his word now there's a certain element of the word as we've looked at in the two prior services that Believers will not fulfill there are certain scriptures I have no desire whatsoever to fulfill Believers about Infidel scriptures about infidels make when lukewarm people people that Liars that don't pertain to me at all you understand there are scriptures that say there's going to come a great falling away I have no desire whatsoever to fulfill that scripture but yet there are scriptures that are written about us now there are certain scriptures that we cannot fulfill and we never will fulfill because they do not pertain to us then on the other side of that there are scriptures that unbelievers make Believers infidels agnostics they can never fulfill because they are written about us so what I want to do myself is find that which is written about me and let God fulfill that portion in my life and those scriptures no doubt that you will fulfill maybe there's Brothers my goodness in the ministry I I feel just absolutely so small and so little trying to even preach in front of them because they're great Servants of God that God is used but yet I know at the same time I can't take their place and they can't take mine so God will use me in a certain way that maybe he wouldn't use them and vice versa and once we see that there's really no room for jealousy and all that sort of thing so we just be what God has made each of us and then we all coalesce together and we work to accomplish exactly what God wants when we do that we root out you know all this jealousy whether it's among preachers and musicians or singers or whatever more and we know that God allocates his gifts and he allocates them in sizes according to that which pleases him so after all if I give you a dollar if I give you five I give you twenty I give you a hundred and I give my wife a thousand you notice how I worded that right and so if I do that and you know it's actually was fine to give so you're going to tell me I'm unjust because I give her a thousand I'll give you 50 cents well you know that's just the way that it works because it was mine to give uh we we bought clothes for our granddaughters for years and years now because we got three sets of twin granddaughters someone ever go to Ross and we go to TJ Maxx and it'll always be you know it was little girls dresses and little girls shoes and little girls this and there was a lady one time at the TJ Maxx at home and she said sir don't you ever get anything don't you ever get anything because she just kept noticing Carol was buying these little dresses and then Carol would find her something and I said ma'am we made this agreement you know 40 some years ago be 48 no this July whenever we got married and we we made this agreement that everything or 50 will be everything is going to be 50 50 between me and Carol my wife that is I get 50 cents she gets fifty dollars 50 50. ah some of you sisters really like that statement foreign sister Debbie said amen [Applause] so you see God is the one who has all these gifts and he's the one who gives them out but each one of us should desire to be able to find what the Lord wants us to be is that right and when we do that then we're able to receive what Paul said that they compare themselves among themselves are not wise so the worst thing we can do is to be able to compare even our walk even our element of Faith you know what I'm saying there's certain people it just seem like they are so gifted in faith they just have such ability and they can just look at the promise of God it makes no difference what it is and others she might they struggle with faith and Satan will try to take that and say oh you're not as good a Christian well maybe you've got a strong point in another Avenue that that person that has the strong faith they don't have you understand you look at it that God puts all this into the body by measures and then this is why it's evident that we need one another there is no preacher that is complete and has the total understanding of everything in this word we need each other and we actually complement each other is that right so God knows exactly what we're doing and want to be able to make the body of God work effectually as Paul says in Ephesians that each one each joint would Supply and bring forth the effectual working of the body now we know of course that the Lord Jesus when he was here that he had the entire ocean for he was the fullness of the godhead bodily I might have a little dropper full and you might have three and brother Jason might have five and you know all the rest of you have your little portion but the Lord Jesus was the fullness of the godhead bodily so he would be able to cover aspects by which none of us would ever do but what I also know about that if the Lord Jesus would have healed everybody in Jerusalem Judea and Samaria and the areas of Galilee that would have been no sick fault for his disciples to heal so I wonder how many that the Lord Jesus walked by in the in the Capernaum synagogue and other places I wonder the man that laid their whenever the Bible tells us in the book of Acts that the apostles walked through there and they saw this man laying there he'd been laying there for a long time I personally believe myself that the Lord Jesus left that man there for his boys to take care of later now think of it no doubt the Lord Jesus walked by many of those people but he wanted a work left behind for the ministry that was going to continue on whenever he was gone he does the same thing today so here we find that God is now going to prove his word I love the way brother Branham deals with this and it makes it kind of sad in one way for the unbelievers but he said improving his word in paragraph 108 he proves his word in every age by the most unusual way but he always does it in the same way see it's what he does in the days of Noah when he's fixing to deliver the remnant he sent them Noah the prophet he sent Noah a sign so God used Noah and part of his family to prove his word but yet he used the unbelievers to prove the other side of that word that he was going to send a flood he never actually sent the waters to drown Noah but he said sent the waters to save Noah so what God did was God gave Manoa the perimeter of the size the specks and all that sort of thing to build a boat now can you imagine this man is building a boat and we have no no record no history that Noah ever built a boat before as a matter of fact his occupation was a farmer this took a lot of face if you don't mind me saying it this way to step on a boat built by a farmer that was not a carpenter but yet God believed that Noah could build this boat now I want you to also notice that God never gave Noah any uh remedies any type of layout any types of plans to build a trailer for this boat and the reason was God was going to bring the water to the boat and Noah wouldn't have to take the boat to the water now you see we know according to what brother Brown said that there was other boats that were being built in that day so no doubt some of them saw Noah and they said well you know what if he can build a boat we're professional boat Builders so we'll build one just in case this old man's got something from God so when these other Boats were built they become actually a Temptation for people not to go to the one God ordained you see that's where we had to be so careful and I find it amazing brother Jason her brother Ram says him about God provide a place of worship that God actually allows these other gates to be there and he said we'll find out in a little while while they are there that God allows those Gates those plates of worship to be put there as a temptation to you oh I know that staggers people but you see God if there's only one boat in the land where do you figure most people would have went when it started raining but when it first started raining can you imagine some of them people that never seen rain before never heard it before but it starts dripping and coming down and what do some of them do well they head over there because that guy's a boat builder they head over here this guy's an architect they head over there and by doing all of that it actually hindered them in the Final Phase of the third pull from coming to the only boat that was God blessed and God ordained there are churches churches Brides brides churches churches Brides brides but there's one that's gonna calm that house most mechanics and Dynamics certainly your little small community you're your little town no doubt you past churches to come to this one today did you not and no doubt you might have even passed some message churches along the way and Satan has done this for countless of years because he knows that it confuses the mind of the unlearned so if God is going to do something Satan will impersonate it but God never ordained not one of those other boats and when the flood came every one of them sang so if I was you I'd try to find God's boat for the hour now folks are jumping out of this message boat right and left well if that's what they wish to do that's up to them but this is the only one that's ordained by God according to Malachi 4. so for me and my house we're staying in the boat well praise the Lord what about it for me and my house I'm staying in this boat now we know that God then has this pattern that he starts and he will allocate a certain portion of his word and he doesn't always make it known of course when he speaks the prophetic utterance from The Prophet's mouth that he will associate this man this woman with that word but God will sow the seed and then the time will roll around and there'll be somebody that will raise up that has an anointing that actually moves on the word and I know you know this because you got great preachers here but in the beginning God divided the logos he separated the logos from the anointing now listen to me carefully that the anointing was separated you know Jesus said a man that will obey in my words and will keep my words he said I am the father will make ourselves known to him now that's not two gods and it's not an old man and a young man but it's actually the Father which is the spirit and the son which is the word so he said we will come to him now you notice what God did that God separated the word from the anointing if not then Satan would have been able to have the Bible and he would have access to all the power of God if the anointing and the word were all United in page four so God had the word written have the word spoken and then God separated the anointing and the anointing of the age would come on the word for the age and that's what makes it live and quickens it to the believer is that right so if not then every devil out of hell all that had to do is get themselves a Bible go to a Bible bookstore order one on Amazon and they would have everything they would need themselves so demons would be able to use the word of God so God separated the logos the word from the anointing and then in every age God would bring the anointing for that age and line it up with the word of that age and the Believers have that age become the word made manifest well I'm too smart but that makes a lot of sense to me in every age it's been exactly the same story and here we are in the Life stage and we know that God has certain scriptures that are ordained to be fulfilled and Moses could not fulfill them that's your spot in this hour that we're living so God always uses humans to fulfill his word now well again the prophet when he brings this he goes down through different dispensations and this next one that he refers to is Joshua and Caleb now we know that these two men were great great men anointed under the ministry of Moses but yet God never allowed Moses to take them over but he's going to have Joshua yahshua which is Jehovah Savior and we know that Caleb was his side buddy as brother Adam called him now those of you that are familiar with the history of Caleb I actually love it because he was not actually a Hebrew but Caleb was the son of jafani which was a kennesite now the kennesites were of the tribal lineage of of not from the Jews not from the Hebrews at all but the genocides come from the opposite side over there which supposedly were unbelievers and infidels but yet God called this man Caleb I mean notice what the name Caleb means nobody oh my goodness dog dog aha so Caleb being a dog Gentile but once you notice that they did not make a special tribe for the converts of the Gentiles that would Embrace Judaism but the Bible tells us that God gave him Caleb an inheritance among the tribe of Judah not that he was born in the tribe of Judah well that's a good tribe to put a gentile into because Judah is praise and Buddy if anybody's going to praise the lord it's going to be us former Gentile dogs because we realize we're not deserving of his mercy and his grace now what's amazing is also that Ruth the moabitus merge into this same tribe and Rahab also merged into this same tribe so and he'll hear it it shouldn't be amazing to you then that out of that same tribe would come to lineage the human lineage of the Lord Jesus himself now you know the Lord Jesus would have never been allowed to even enter into the temple of God in the New Testament Jesus never preached in the temple he would have never been a allowed to go into there because he was not of what they thought was the right lineage Jesus only preached in synagogues never in the temple isn't that amazing here is God himself but they would have never allowed God himself into their Temple because he didn't match up to their idea oh my goodness but yet God chose Joshua and Caleb to fulfill a certain part of his word notice he said where Joshua had led them there now Jordan gets real low you can wait across almost anywhere around unless you hit a hole of water where it's pretty deep where all the little forwards and things right there all the banks where Jericho was at you can make way to cross him isn't much over ankle deep now notice this ankle deep just drive across it in a jeep drive across it walk across it but he led them there in the time of April when the flooded country was flooded for almost a mile isn't it amazing how God will pick the route for his children to Journey now God if he would have synchronized this in the certain time with nature they could have pretty much just walked across it I've been there at the Jordan not long ago myself and it's not that deep of a place still yet to this day but yet God synchronized it so they would not go according to nature but actually contrary to it that God supernaturally would have to intervene and make nature comply to him and said allowing his children to comply to Nature watch what he said Oh Glory I love this he says God said so call the people together testify it for them he said the third day you're passing over Jordan see how God lets things happen just to make people just to pull out his little crowd what did they do they Sanctified themselves and they got ready oh my think of what a time it must have been when they looked at Joshua and said and you're the pastor of this church well I'll tell you one thing you sure don't know too much about whether you sure don't do much about leading God's people it's the very worst time of the year the River Jordan is a mile why when they would come down through there in the floods and the waddies so it all empty down and the melting of the snow from Mount Hermon and it would empty out and all this and you're looking out there and it's a mile wide and you chose you say you're a man of God you say you're a man that's called of God to leave these people boy where do you get your weather from where are you getting your report it looks like to me we've got a poor excuse for a leader sometimes God will leave his leaders in ways that's absolutely contrary to their own human perception God will lead them to preach things and do things and even take the church in a direction that they are battling within themselves to even do it but they feel the impulse of the Holy Ghost and they're afraid to disobey that you know God don't always make it known to the leaders but yet they feel that leading of the Holy Spirit and they will look back and say man I'll tell you I'll sweating bullets on that move I will sweat and bonus but it turned out to be the spirit of God why will God do that because he wants every leader to know it's him leading the way it ain't me it ain't him it ain't these other brothers God wants men that can be led all the Holy Ghost notice he said no matter how close you are to George no matter what your circumstances is if you could only hold that promise of God in your heart God will prove it that it's so in the midst of unbelief he will still prove that it is so I only know exactly do that and of course Caleb being this Gentile dog the Kendall's eye or the son of jafani when he come down when they start in the north part of the country and then they started driving the land out they were moving North toward Eastward and Westward and whenever they did they drove out the Giants but by the time they come back and they say the Book of Joshua is written in about a 27 year span some of the time they come around from the doors and come back down into the valley and he's fixing to receive his inheritance guess what happened the Giants that they drove out had moved back in now here they've got to take that mountain again our Acadia has added 40 years to his age he's added all kinds of scars all types of battles and now he's got to come but he said I'm just as able today as I was 40 years ago when God's Prophet came in this mountain and what was Caleb's identity well I'm about ready to go on Social Security I got my AARP card I guess I'll just kind of slow down and I'll let you young guys take it oh I can hear it down through there my goodness it said May camp and the whities and then sat down I can hear this sound going on people saying what in the world oh don't worry about it it's Uncle Caleb he's just over a sharpening his sword you'll imagine he had a sword about that long 40 years prior to that and when he come back down it's about this wrong but but it was sharp why because God was going to prove his word through Caleb I wonder are there any calebs here today that'll say Lord God prove your words to me [Applause] oh my if you won't get weak now in faith notice God proved his word to job as we looked at it last night God told the devil for the trial ever began I got a man that will love me I've got a man that will serve his fight of everything that you do it took only about a year they say the Book of Job covers a span of about a year it took a lot of Trials it took a lot of tests but the word of God was proved exactly by Joe how many wants to be that kind of believer today foreign oh God likes to prove himself be God how many wants a testimony and serving the lord let's dissect that word t e s t i m o n y test I'm only and groanie and complaining isn't it amazing we want a tremendous testimony but we don't really want tests praise the Lord oh would it be nice if God would have just emailed you some tremendous testimony God would have watched aptitude and there you go and there it is just laid it out oh he said why order God that is that is great I mean that is great and God said how many wants to testimony oh my all y'all's hands went up hey man what's the test either Judges chapter 16 verse 2. and was told to the gays out saying Samson has come hither and they can pass him in and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city and were quite all the Naz saying in the morning when it is gay we shall kill him and Samson lay till midnight and arose at mad hiding took the doors of the Gate of the city and the two posts and went away with them bar and all and put them upon his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the hill that is before Hebron carried them up to the top of the hill that is before Hebron which is 20 miles away I don't mind telling you I'm not sure I'm man enough to pack a door that size 20 miles laughs much less doors like this I don't think you know it or not but these Gates and the ancient times were called the gates of hell don't you understand what God was doing God was not only going to do a great thing through Samson but Samson was prophesying of one day a mighty conqueror would come to the Earth and he would take the Gates of Hell Hallelujah he would take the gates of hell and rip them up oh aren't you glad we're sitting here today serving a mighty conquer who took the gates of hell and when he raised up he said I am he that was dead but I Am Alive forevermore Hallelujah and I have got the key of death and hell and the grave I want to let you know the day the devil don't even have the keys to his own house amen the Lord Jesus has conquered him and he's still doing it now if he can find somebody in vessel Tabernacle that he can use to prove his word foreign hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus some Bible scholars say that the city Gates and the posts of Gaza which he tore down computed to be listen this between 10 to 20 000. pounds they'll get a Hercules symbol now in your mind don't look this brother back here and say wow man that must be a big guy I know it's a liberty old guy about four foot that's what the prophet said Samson was about four foot little curly-headed shrimp little mama's boy oh my goodness but God had a word to prove Oh Glory to God God had a word to prove the angel of the Lord of Manoa and his wife whenever the Lord began to say about him don't you drink no wine don't you do this don't you that's speaking to his wife because I'm going to bring forth a son that was a word from God well he said if I only have that word let me tell you one thing every one of you predestinated seeds sitting here today on a spoken word from God God thought of you God spoke you as a matter of fact the prophet of God said God called your name in his first things before the foundation of the world there ain't enough devils in Hell there ain't enough tribulation there ain't enough sorrow to stop you from serving God because you are the spoken word thank you so Samson takes off of this 10 to 20 000 I mean give or take a thousand what difference does it make that make her when you're talking about this kind of weight 20 miles and Hebron is an elevation of 3 200 feet higher than where he was so he's carrying it uphill all the way foreign Christians are downhill Christians [Music] but this is real Christianity uphill all the way [Laughter] but I'm crying higher I'm going higher with the gates of Gaza I'm on my way oh look out devil I say look out Devil by the grace of God and the power of God I'm on my way these Gates were 10 feet tall 10 feet wide this was the chief City of the godzites though don't pick a little village somewhere tackle the whole thing one man against thousands I mean I know they are it still wasn't fair I mean against them Oh Glory to God if you and I could only see who we are today and you look around on those who are saying oh Lord I'm outnumbered no you're not there's more with us than there are with them Hallelujah the odds are definitely against hell the odds are definite against the devil your destiny has already been determined you are going to make it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] laughs not assist an identification of Christ the prophet said a prophet he was but he was more than a prophet he was a prophet plus talking about Jesus he said they had many prophets all prophets died at the Gate of death but this man took the keys death Hell In The Grave like Samson did the gates of Gotham he took it out and he took the sting out of death itself and swallowed up in Victory now listen to this and watch him break now from him to you makes his Believers more than conquerors it's already conquered there's nothing left to do but walk straight in with the Victor song and our hearts he is the triumphant one and this great one was more than a prophet [Applause] oh he loves to prove his word remember in first Samuel chapter 17 verse 4. Little David and I want out a champion ooh there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of gas and the word Goliath means splendor well that's what Satan must have put in front of your past this strong enemy and you're just a little weakling sort of a guy if he can switch You by strategy to make you think you are powerless and the prophet said Satan has won one only one he has one weapon that is to make you doubt your weapon you don't have power it's not that he has power to be able to do this and that and the other gives you no it is simply manipulation if he can get you we know what propaganda is it's being used around the world why do you think that Putin has been so used in the nuclear word and then we use the nuclear word and then this one what is a lot of it it's nothing but brandishing their sower I've got news for Mr Putin he may have every intention of blowing us off the map but it's not him that's in control of our destiny I've got news for Russia I've got news for all the rest of the world or Brother Don if you've got a bomb shelter I sure do what brother what material did you use is it titanium is it concrete it's feathers I said it's feathers I'm under the feathers all glory to God of my heavenly Papa and he's watching over me I am afraid of Putin I ain't afraid of Russia I ain't even afraid of gas Hallelujah Russia has built themself a super stealth bomber faster more invisible than our f-35s our f-22s and they named it the messenger the messenger they've got their missiles with Warheads on them that can travel a Hypersonic speeds we don't even have one yet as a matter of fact the last one we tried a couple of months ago fizzled out in the water brother John don't that scare you not in the least I know some of y'all think I'm crazy I'm gonna go ahead and confirm it for you today I am I'm absolutely out of my mind and I am so glad that I'm out of my mind I just wish some of you would join me and get out of yours amen no tell it what the Lord could do right here for us this morning if we lay aside our fear lay aside all the scare of the world and say Lord God you're still the almighty you're still the all-powerful [Applause] ah so here comes the champion boom boom boom boom you imagine I'm classic good Lord have you ever seen such a tall boss and a man in your life six cubits and a span which would equal equal nine feet and nine inches tall nine feet and nine inches that's taller than your ceiling laughs and he had a helmet of brass upon his head it was hard mother called a male and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass so his helmet weighed 30 pounds so can you imagine a helmet weighing 30 pounds well as puny as I am I just notice in verse six and he had Graves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass the 20 shoulders it's only wore the bronze helmet and a coat of scale armor weighing 5 000 shekels that would have been 125 pounds just for that and he has a long spear which had a bronze Shadow which had a 15 pound iron tip and all his armor would have weighed in the neighborhood of 200 pounds that's more my way imagine this old boy getting up of the morning he said he's probably so cantankerous it's going to contrary he couldn't get along the devil putting all that stuff on that hot weather down there hotter in South Carolina Lord have mercy you imagine he felt like a cooked lobster inside that thing sometime that old hot metal and that sunshine on top of it that certainly didn't add to his attitude didn't it I'm afraid that's the way we are sometimes they're so affected by the things around us you know why we spend too much time on Facebook we spend too much time on Instagram I think we'll be better off if we kept our face in his book well Hallelujah instead of Facebook I'm keeping a bunch of Gossip going all the time let's feed on the unfailing body word of the son of man so our bodies can be ready to be changed foreign the spear the staff of his spear was like a Weaver's beam and his spearhead weighed 600 shekels of iron I love the way brother random describes this a great big giant like that walking with a Weaver's needle which is claimed to be around 20 feet he could stand from right here just pick you all off like flies you could hear me close to him well you think the devil don't like to do that to you when you go to the doctor and you get a little pain and that doctor will pull a scan up and say oh my goodness sir I hate to tell you but you've got a tumor you've got this that now then Satan wants you to look at that instead of look at your promise oh yeah get your eyes on that pain Jaws on this and that and the other when doctors themselves will tell you Erica's doctor told her over and over again keep the right attitude keep the right attitude the prophet of God by saying this years and years ago before the the psychologists of this day ever broke into it saying that whenever people say they've got cancer he said for a great percentage of them right then they're already dead but he said if you believe God and if you had cancer you wouldn't be in too bad of a shape if you'd believe his word can you imagine a doctor telling you that why because the words that you feed on the articles that you read oh everybody's got Dr Google on their computer anymore or on their phone anymore we ought to consult Dr God instead of Dr Google [Applause] all right he had a 20-foot spear in his hand a man like that could stand there and pick up a dozen men and throws him light he stood there and cried into the armies of Israel Samuel goes on to say and said unto them why are you come out to set your battle in a ray am not eye Philistine and you Servants of Saul choose you a man let him come down and fight me a non-armored Goliath would wait in the proximity of 760 pounds that's a good sized cow [Laughter] you imagine a man standing there 760 pounds add in the weight of his armor that would have made him around 885 pounds with his shield and his Spirit which is not tilted up in the 125 that would put him right at a thousand and you little tiny shrimp you're gonna go out there and meet that man he had made that challenge day after day after day but one day that challenge fell across the ears of the wrong guy I guess depends on how you look at it he's either the wrong guy or the right guy sometimes the right guy is the wrong guy sometimes the wrong guy is the right guy ain't that right this little guy heard it he said what what you mean to tell me that I'm watching a little holy little all wired up you know just glory to God hallelujah took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones I stood in this Valley of elah a couple years ago quite an awesome feeling too just being there you look over to your right which is where the people God were over to your left in a hard place where these folks were right down in the valley was to try a creek bed parts of it was about this deep I got down the bottom of some of the other Saints walking around through there what's he looking for of course five smooth stones I know that I was going to preach us I brought one of them with me too it always has more emphasis when you pull that rock out from the valley of Elo laughs I saw what an honor what an honor to stand down here and walk and then I thought well glory to God here's another little David down here with the other little David was don't you want to have that kind of reputation where you can say glory to God I am a giant slayer I am a Cancer conqueror I am a pornography conqueror I am a lost conqueror I am a layer to see and Conquer look I'm devil here we come in the name of Jesus because God will fulfill his word in our lives [Applause] so he chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had even in a script and his slang was in his hand and he drew near to the philistine David was willing only to fight with the weapons that he knew glory to God she ever notice I'm sure you have that whenever David got called before Saul and Dr Saul of course wanted to give him adulterous to Grant a pH Digger green all that sort of thing and Davidson I ain't never used such thing but once you notice what David done David began to testify of previous victories that God had done for him why because testifying about it now I know it may seem strange to you but the prophet said whenever you take all of his word he said take that word and start saying it over and over and over again until you believe it wow you mean sometimes we don't let's just be honest and face the facts sometimes we'll start quoting the word and we really don't believe it yet but the key is for you to be able to hear yourself say it and you say it I am healed I am healed I am healed I am delivered I am an overcomer I am going to put this devil under my feet why there's something about you hearing yourself quote God's word [Applause] I've got an app on my phone where I can take affirmations of God's scriptures and record them in my own voice Donnie you're more than a conqueror Donnie you're going in the Rapture the Millennium is for me heaven is mine and then I can play them over and over again it's good to hear the preacher say it but there's a lot of power when you hear yourself say it so here comes this guy boom boom sweating worse than I am if you can imagine that this guy feels like he's toasting a microwave man he's burning a peace War out he's contagious he's mad he didn't get his coffee he didn't get his toast and jelly for breakfast that morning and here he comes I say you gotta begin you mean I got out of bed I bet he may look at you the same way sometimes but he'll look at you different when you take his sword and remove his hit oh Hallelujah and the Philistine came on and Drew near unto David and the man that bear the she who went before him and the Philistine looked about and saw David he disdained him look at the meaning of the word to despise holding contempt to be despicable to be vile and worthless isn't that what he tries to do to us [Applause] for he was but of use and ready which means he was cute oh boy this really adds to the thing of the of a great a giant killer don't it I mean he ain't got no scars yet he comes out that this ready which was red kind of a complexion of red looking complexion and it must have been an odd Israel I could begin with and now Yuri come out there there are no scars all over him nothing anywhere but he couldn't even hard to stand still Glory did God let me at him let me ask him somebody tell me somebody put me in that direction his brother sent you ought to be ashamed of yourself David you're just being a little smart at it no he was anointed he couldn't help it it wasn't David that wanted to do this they oh Lord God brother Jason David walked right into the anointing it was a giant slaying anointing David couldn't help it you have walked into the anointing of this hour we can't do it on her own but we can't turn back we've walked right into our anointing [Applause] oh Lord [Applause] never remember David a teenager what's verse 43 and the Philistine said unto David am I a dog David could have said you said it [Applause] that thou comest to me with staves and a Philistine curse David by his gods and the Philistines say to David come to me and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air to the beasts of the field then said David to the Philistine thou cometh to me with a sword and with a spear with a shield but I am come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel you see David was not a trinitarian he didn't come in the name of Gods I come to thee in the name of this human [Applause] that's him which is the ineffable the ineffable it's so great you can't even pronounce it it's so Majestic he didn't mention his sign he didn't mention any Stones amen what do you mention the name the name the Shem the Shem I come to you in the ineffable name because in that ineffable name is everything I need at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess every disease every sickness ever trauma it can be subject to the name of Jesus Christ what goliath expected from his arms and his equipment they've been expected more so from the ineffable name it was so great he couldn't even pronounce it but he said all I know is there's such power in it all I've got to do is offer utter the synonym you know they consider the name of God so sacred you look on many Jewish websites even to this very day and they will put G leave out the Z of the O and put d g d because they think it's too great to pronounce it and David said I don't come to you with a lot of Education I don't come to you with a lot of experience but I come to you in the name in the name of the god of the armies of Israel you said as a matter of fact it's a great I can't even express it well you know this must have just added to the lunacy of what goliath saw this poor little kid they went over to the insane place and they picked up this guy and now he's so great he came to tell me the name of his God let me look at him he's just a little old sunburned looking guy but maybe freckles all over his face ain't never been in a battle in his life oh well that's yet to be seen in it he didn't know about the lion he didn't know about the bear laughs notice what David said this day with the Lord capital L capital O capital r capital D will the Lord deliver them I'm sure you've looked at it before but it did it quite amazing whenever the spies go down the land of Jericho and they go to Talking to Rahab the Harlot and Ray had the heart it begins to mention the secret name of God and she said we know we know that the Lord not capital L little o little r Little D that was a word used among the ammonites the amorites the hypnites all the jebusites but how did she know this name which only Abraham and his seat knew Barb will deliver them to my hand and I will smite thee now you imagine by now it's about 110 in the shade and this guy feels like a cooked onion and a microwave and he's all day one day I am getting sick and tired of your mouth I'm fixing to wipe you out okay you hear me little boy little brat you're dead meat David said don't interrupt my sermon you I will take your hat from you and I will give the carcass of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air Lord have mercy how can a teenager make such a challenge how can a teenager say such a word so now he's moved Beyond Goliath himself is it just a matter of fact just to let you know I'm gonna kill the whole bunch of you [Applause] that's about the way you feel when the anointing gets on you that's the way I feel right now ask me how I feel about 30 minutes from now [Music] don't you understand it'll be this an even greater that'll come over us one day the prophet called it a sweep he said you'll look and you'll see your loved ones and you know it won't be long and a sweep will come over you a sweep in that peculiar work to use for the body change but you see it's not peculiar to the bride because the Lord Jesus used that same Parable and won The Parables of the gospels whenever he said that the one of the bride and all of them speaking about Redemption of course in Luke 16 and whenever they dropped the coins and they lost this and that and how did that bride find those coins sweeping only the sweat will be swept away only the sweepers will be swept away why we're used to sweeping we're used to having our lives cleaned out by anointed mans of God are we we're Houston we get little dust in this corner a little something lost in that corner and God anoints these men and they drag out the room or they go to sweeping everything out of us and we so well glory to God the Rapture is the final phase of me being Swift and one of these days I'm going to be swept out of this world in a moment in the twinkling of an eye [Applause] notice what David's going to do this I'll feed you all to the fowls of the air to the wild beast of the Earth no the Earth may know there is a God in Israel not that all the world may know I'm his great psalmist I'm this great person I'm this great preacher I'm this great lovely no he knew his purpose his purpose was to manifest the name of God his purpose was to fulfill God's word for that honor do you understand your purpose brother sister and all disassembly shall know that the Lord save us not with the sword in the spear for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands and it came to pass when the Philistine arose and came and Drew not to meet David that David realized he'd made a terrible mistake and took off running the other way and David hasted and ran toward the Army Lord have mercy you see the longer you take and the slower you look the bigger them circumstances become sometimes you're better offices look out devil look out devil God I command the end of this thing to your hair look out devil here I come but we think oh goodness let me get my range finder scope out here now good Lord according to that of the ballistics and the wind there ain't no way in the world that swings I'll ever take that guy down but he had stepped into an anointing he couldn't understand why that word was hanging in the valley of elah and it had David's name wrote all over it you imagine his brother said good Lord look at them my balls look at them eyelashes that guy didn't need a ceiling fan all they knew just bad his eyes his own personal built-in ceiling fan let's say Lord have mercy how in the world would you ever bring a man down like that and David look and say good God Almighty a Target that big how could you ever miss it hallelujah hallelujah I'm tired of this rockness the devil how is it you can't overcome it so David hasted and ran toward the army to meet the philistine all right Philistine here we come David put it in his bag I got a stone and slang it and smote the Philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk have you ever seen a Hypersonic Rock before I want you to notice how he fell and he fell upon his face God made him bow wow according to the power of this rock thing at a thousand miles faster than you can even imagine already tell you in a minute how fast it's going according to that velocity your brother said hunt know how it is according to when you're rifle hunting and you take that bullet according to the speed that comes out of the muscle and whenever it hits that animal it will just ah they don't go forwards the velocity knocks them back but God must have orchestrated where he tripped that big guy when the mains goes down or just kind of gotten away he said you ain't falling backwards you're bowing before my servant Hallelujah don't you fall backwards devil but I will devil [Applause] the prophet said he picked up these five songs well this great big boasting Infidel walking out there and cursed him in the name of his Idol cursed David while I said I'll take you on the end of my spear like a Weaver's needle longer than one of them middle tent poles but I've been preaching under a tent take it into this spear little old boy weighed about a hundred and 10 pounds meeting a man full body weight is about a thousand and the odd still is against Goliath yes your friends it's just all the way you perceive it it's the way we are looking at these things this is how Satan steals so much of our Victory he knows how to present it [Applause] kind of a scrawny drawed in little fella maybe didn't get too much to eat back on the back side of the desert so here he comes kind of ready kind of cute little fella coming out through there was an emotional sword of the God because he'd be back there alone with God get to plan his his harp and to go to shouting around and he's just really all caught up you know I know emotional people can be like that he just gets all caught up you know just kind of hyper like yeah you just go to church and just couldn't sit still all I can say is it's a good thing David wasn't here this morning because the Deacon Brothers had died escorted him out here about 50 times you imagine David sitting here with the baptism of the Holy Ghost can you imagine David said you're this morning saved by the blood of the Lord Jesus and forgiven David will scream at her service he'd shout every service he'd Marsh around the walls of Jericho there ain't even know Jericho he'd say Lord have mercy you mean you all got that Living God living in you you've got that in your soul all I had was the law but I loved him so much [Music] [Applause] laughs oh Goliath was covered all over the steel up and down like one little spot and here it comes across to meet him a little bitty fella like that Goliath standing there with a spear ready to pick him up and hang him on a tree somewhere Here Come Little David just a bouncing in the spirit didn't have to drag him in all right how many is happy to be here today calm down now you're getting too wild calm down aren't you happy to be here yeah yeah yeah all right let's everybody get in the spirit let's Worship the Lord I feel so sorry for our song leader sometimes oh but you imagine David here he goes he's bouncing just bouncing he ain't going to a carnival he ain't going to dinner he's fixing to mate to meet a thousand pound Giant glory to God sometimes I'll tell your friends I think when the devil lays a big trap in a big snare for us we ought to discover the liver out of him just take off running at him and just saying boo boo boo boo [Applause] all right understand we just kind of Hunker there oh no no please please be merciful be merciful shame on us here come little David bouncer in the spirit knows how brother man says this he got so blessed himself preaching this what a Holy Roller of course that's message folks ain't called Holy Rollers no more we're called holy setters oh Jesus help me get out of this way Hallelujah Hallelujah most of us our response to the word anymore is this we're nodders I wonder what old Fritz would have done if brother Branham his dog you remember telling about his dog how did he Chase conks he said he hated the skunk but brother random would say seeking boy seek him Warner Brothers would have looked at Fritz and said [Applause] and First Look Back is that all you've got for me I'm going to get all messed up I'm going to stink like a polecat and that's all you've got that's the way us preachers feel sometimes you'd not believe the devil so we fight to bring you the word you're not believe the Devils we fight when we get done with the word and that's all you give us come on come on give old friends a little more than an odd give old friends a little more than a silly grin is there anybody left that can say Amen preacher preach it Pastor Jason preaching brother Jason preach it brother man preach and go ahead man of God I'm with you I'm with you let's take this whole Army [Applause] [Applause] brother man says here come little David to bounce from the spirit haha oh what a Holy Roller victory already well I had stepped into the anointing he placed the name of the Lord God of Israel before him I want you to listen to his friends all devils in hell you see David look me on somebody Jason it was more than just Goliath he knew what he was doing all the devils in hell this is a man not even born again this is the man not even filled with the Holy Ghost what about those of you today that are born of the spirit of God when the prophet said the weakest Christian praise and he causes them Devils to tremble don't you know why they don't want you to pray don't you know why they don't want you to believe who you are in Christ Jesus they strip you and I all the devil's in Hell couldn't wait across that little David just sitting there with his finger upon his nose nodding his head Little David just dancing in the spirit wow dancing before the Giant's dead Brother Don the doctors give me a bad reports they told me I better get my funeral ready better teleportation what I want him to say I take the other report I start looking online for a trip to Cancun Maybe don't make your plans to die make your plans to fight make your plans to live but we take the doctor's report is the absolute right here is your absolute the word of God [Applause] ah notice the prophet said what is it he had five stones five fingers wrapped this little string around Jesus here he comes oh brother look out Goliath you gotta fall when you set that loose the Holy Ghost got to hold to that little Stone and pick up a speed of about a thousand miles per second boy wouldn't Russia like to have that equation how to figure that one out when the Air Force in the U.S army like to figure out how in the world but they don't have access to holy ghost power but you do you do Oh Glory to God what brother Donnie what rock am I going to use the scriptures quotes of the message of the hour and it may be seem like so little when it leaves your mouth the key is the Holy Ghost takes it and flies it out that A Thousand Miles a second enslaves that devil so imagine here he goes something has always done David did not upgrade to a Hypersonic swing it's the same one he's always used with it for his same one he didn't need Hypersonic apparently with a bear in the lion but he did with this Johnny's got this 24 sphere so God says I'll keep you safe boy so the spirit of God oh only one spot right here everybody else was covered and the spirit of God you imagine David he was Fearless you imagine this recent thing now is that a northwest wind or is out of Southwest now you brothers that shoot a bow you know that you shoot that thing in at a certain thing and you heard a tree stand and you're 20 feet high oh my I had to come 25 feet high which means the angle that the the stir that the arrow will drop is just a little bit different and there's a West Wind moving at about 12 miles an hour oh my oh I'll have to allow for it David didn't have to allow he just took and said glory to God here it comes here it comes get ready for the shouting music because we're fixing to have a time oh you imagine Davis might send away don't you better calculate this what I'm calculating is my God is Almighty oh brother Donnie I'm calculating for the chemo I'm calculating for this and that and the other let's calculate that our God is a mighty God he ain't never been defeated he ain't never lost a child he has never lost a battle and he ain't gonna start now because he's got some children that need Deliverance they need healing they need peace [Applause] first Samuel 17 50 so David prevailed over the Philistine with a singing with a stone and smoke the Philistine and slowing but there was no sword in the hand of David therefore David ran stood upon the philistine oh how I'm waiting for the day when I can be able to send mother Jason I thought WhatsApp or a text or email maybe all three of them say brother Jason Erica as well Hallelujah Hallelujah but I'm going to go ahead and say today by his stripes she is already healed by his stripes you are already healed before you ever see the victory we can go ahead and rejoice and say praise God he is my healer [Applause] don't you understand why sometimes God will let people go to doctors you remember the miracle of Donnie Morton Donnie Morton was the little guy that had this crippling disease and his daddy was really really poor and he had to save his money to come and see brother Branham and he finds him in this certain city and he meets brother ran him out on the street and brother bam tells him little little brother he said now you won't believe it because you've had your little boy to all these different famous doctors but there's an old country doctor that'll perform a surgery on your boy but brother Brown they say it's impossible I know it'll seem like it's impossible but he said he'll perform that surgery and your boy will walk again isn't it amazing what did Brother Branham if the Lord had been a lead brother brought him to pray for him right there on the street and the Miracle have been performed ah but you see Readers Digest would have never published that [Applause] so God used his prophet and took the Dead the devil's own sword books education science [Laughter] the doctors have told brother Ron Spencer if and when you are healed it will be the one of the most Vindicated Miracles that's ever been known in history because they've got all these scans they've got all this proof he shouldn't even be alive today he shouldn't even be living you see sometimes God wants to take the devil's own sword and cut his own head off with it real faith is not scared to go back to the doctor and say let the doctor tell you you will that's right you can look at a scan well it was there but this one says it ain't time no more but your face looked at it when it said it was there and said it ain't there no more Oh Glory to God your body's just waiting waiting to catch up with your faith therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine oh I love this just climb right up on them cigarettes take your foot and just squish it [Applause] climb right up on that addiction and say go to hell go back to hell where you come from and dance right on that Affliction dance right on that addiction [Applause] he drew out the sheath thereof and slew him that's already done killed him I'm sorry you had never noticed this but so the Bible says in verse 50 he slew him then it says in verse 51 he slew him again I saw the way I like to do devils Islam and then you swim and then you swim and you saw him [Laughter] and cut off his head there with him when the Philistines Saul their Champion was dead they fled what was it God prove him his word Sister Janet does he prove his word when our sister had cancer years ago and the Lord wanted somebody that could testify that the Lord God could heal cancer how many years been healed by the Lord in his Mercy how many has come through great tests and trials and you thought you'd never make it and somehow the Lord God brought you through everybody's Grace what was it you walked into that anointing Hallelujah of the hour and God anointed you for that trial I can't be brother Jason brother Jason can't be we want to find our place and be God's allocated so much of his word for each one of us that's not only in fulfillment of the glorious but dealing with those things which we really don't like to deal with God wants a preacher that can be laughed at ridiculed and made fun of how many preachers you see standing in line for that now if God said I don't want to preacher that'll empty out the hospitals boy most all the misfit Lord let it be me it's me God it's me but God says I want a preacher that can be ridiculed and run down and criticized and hated rejected talked about you don't see my hand going up do you God knew that so he pulled mine up somebody [Music] God Needed Somebody that he could prove that the Lions couldn't meet him so he got to Daniel he needed three somebody's that he could prove his power was greater than a burning furnace wow they wasn't even sure God would bring them out were they they said we're not even sure if the Lord will do it or not but this one thing we know we will not bow to you that's one thing we know for sure you see sometimes we enter into the battle like David where we already see it this is done this is finished other times we enter into the battle like Shadrach meshacking a minute ago and we say Lord I'm not sure how this is going to go but this is one thing I do know I ain't giving up on you I ain't turning my back on you God has all these examples written in the word to show us that our life is so multi-layered our life as Christians our victories are one in so many Avenues why did God leave all these things in the Bible for our admonition and for examples for us to see there's times God reveals it to you when you're right here all hell is going to be in front of you you say I ain't got to worry in the world and there's other times God says follow me stay with me I'll lead you he don't show you the end but somehow you believe it's going to be good because you remember the scripture in the book of Jeremiah that said I know the thoughts that I think towards you and they are good and not evil Hallelujah Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus I pray you'd speak to every son or daughter today Lord maybe they're somewhere weary in the battle we're not sure they can make it another day their strength seems to be subsiding by the hour but Lord God made the god of David the god of Daniel Hallelujah the great Lord God Adonai may you come with strings many times father we Face things and we wasn't sure if we'd be able to make it or not but somehow you and your grace reached down and brought us through we thank you for the stories like David we love them we've all been serving you most of us probably long enough to know all of our battles don't come that way there's times it's more like some of these other ones in the scripture 25 years of Abraham waiting on the promise of God waiting waiting waiting but he walked under an anointing when he was 75 years old when you said I make my Covenant with thee you never even asked him if he wanted it you just told him well that's the way you've done us before the world began or if we could catch a glimpse and the prophet said that our names are engraved and the palms of your hands Hallelujah and he said when you spoke your word Christ the logos into existence you spoke us into existence too because we are part of that original word oh Jesus would you pass this word today strengthen ever Deborah strengthen ever it Lazarus sisters as they're seeing their brother and his body there deteriorating and you showed up four days late strength and ever gerias when the little girl is dead strengthen every one of these people Lord may we be like the sorrow Phoenician woman whenever she come to you and you were so rude many of us if you treated us that way we'd turn away and never come back the disciples even besought you sent her a wish in our modern terms she is aggravating us you told a look woman I'm not even sent to you oh my we would have got our feelings hurt with and never come back we'd have found us another church but she had a need and her need was bigger than her feelings I wish we could learn that today then you finally said look I'm not sent to your race of people you're a bunch of dogs we know Lord this two words used there for the word dog one means a big dog and one means a little dog you use the word big dog I'm not sent to you because you're a big dog but she answered you back and said that's right Lord I'm a little dog the prophet of God said she had such face even you couldn't run her off Lord God many people in this message they leave because the preacher runs them all for the Deacon says something to their kids or this that and the other help us to have the kind of Faith thought this woman had that if Jesus himself meets Us in the way and said out of my way and we say you ain't leaving till you bless me maybe grab a hold of you because you're the same one that Jacob grabbed a hold of that day I ain't letting go till you change me I'm tired of being a deceiver I'm tired of being a trickster I'm tired of being half in and half out I ain't letting go till you change me Hallelujah he walked in there fully capable on his strength to walk in but he walked out a limping Prince glory to God and he called the name of that place pineal for there he said I have met God face to face no wonder this man later could make an altar and call the name of that altar hell hell he Israel he Israel How could a man be so emboldened who called an altar merged after his name with God's name but after he met God it gave him the right to worship the way he had never worshiped before so it said hell God hello he God God to God of Israel no longer just the god of Abraham and the god of Isaac but my God we've preached for years that you was brother Branham Scott you was Elijah's God you were Moses God but I believe the folks that leave this world in the Rapture aren't just going to preach of the god of Moses or the god of Elijah but they're going to say he's my God he's a my healer he's my resurrection he's my body changer he's my God too oh Jesus we bless your name father We Worship You Lord would you lay hands on each other for just a moment we're going to offer prayer I don't want you praying for yourself and how about I want you to pray for that person standing by you Hallelujah Lord we sense your anointing we sense faith Oh Glory to God father maybe some of them have tried and tried and they can't lay aside this besetting sin or that whatever it is in the name of Jesus May today be the place that they can drive down a stake maybe it's not so much a person on this assembly somebody that'll stream the service father we come before you now in the name the inevitable name the name that's above all names and it's not only your name but it's our name Hallelujah for we have taken on your name mistress Jesus

the name of Jesus May healing pass through this way today I rebuke the contention of Satan that would try to divide this assembly in the name of Jesus Satan we've got your number and you are a liar

friends oh my what an atmosphere of the word that's that's when you see the Holy Spirit come in behind the word I just was so struck by the whole idea of just moving into a complete worship even before you see the miracle I mean think about it think about it how insulting that would be to God if you waited to thank him after the miracle what an insult what a slap to his face when he's already promised you it's already done it's already done already do you believe that so to say we thank him now I'm just going to thank him now whatever is your need whatever it is you put it for him right

sacrifice you're the one that could provide the atonement the only one you were the only one who could live the perceptive side of the word on our behalf because everything it had to be precept upon

is that you bring a a rock to a sword fight and the man's got a 20-foot spear and a sword and all this armor and you're just a little believer [Laughter] but you got a Hypersonic Holy Ghost I can catch that hold of that rock or I love that point A lot of times we pray we have to try to have faith and we say it doesn't feel like a whole lot don't worry the holy spirit will grab it he'll take it right to the Target and and you know whether he slayed him putting a missile deep in his brain or whether he slayed him by I just say all of the above say what is it going to take to put the devil out
