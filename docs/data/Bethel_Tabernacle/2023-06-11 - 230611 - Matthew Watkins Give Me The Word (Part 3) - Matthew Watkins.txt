testimony I went Friday just as an update went to a follow-up visit after two weeks to The Specialist and she said on every measurable metric I'm improving amen she was very happy and all of the different things she was seeing are all seemed to be gone the the virus is gone and uh just healing up the effects of it amen I'm thankful to God and she took back some of the medication I'm I'm putting in my eye cutting a lot of it cut in half and some of it even more she said another week or so I can fade off of most of it she doesn't even want to see me again for almost five or six weeks amen so I'm thanking the Lord this morning amen praise God it's not easy and um she asked me she asked me if I was preaching so so I had to kind of tell her I wasn't and she continued to ask me not to do that and I don't know if she got tipped off or if she went online but I think she knows that I get a little excited so you said you have to you're going to have to just tough it out because and I thought well you don't have any idea you're not a preacher it's tougher than you think and so um but she said it can actually cause it to come back again but I'm just I'm saying that's not part of the program by his stripes I am already healed amen so I'm thanking the lord for that I'm looking forward to getting back in the Pulpit on the first of July I'm gonna have to stay on the sidelines through the rest of this month I'm glad we have a wonderful team of ministry here amen praise the Lord you appreciate the team God has assembled and give you I've been enjoying it quite a bit amen I want to think I've told Brother Matt to maybe mention it but just as a reminder sister Jean is not here again today I went by and took her some ice packs and prayed for her a second time and she's really really suffering and my mom is not a complainer she just not she'll just suck it up and tough it out and um but um you keep saying she said I'm like you Jason I thought I don't know if Debbie would agree I'm probably a whiner but but my mom is not and but she is really for two weeks been on a lot of of hip pain right here and uh she took steroid shots and steroid pills had an x-ray Katie come and took a Friday for an x-ray they're waiting for results but pray for sister Gene will you do that amen and uh she's really in a lot of Agony and I'm just believing the Lord is going to touch her again you ready for the word of God hey man let's sing that again the more that I Surrender the more that I surrender all the lighter come on the more that I release my cares the more he takes control

than I found myself the more he lives every day [Music] happy to be in the house of the Lord amen amen Ezekiel chapter 2 if you have your Bible you will just while you're turning just got a couple announcements to make this morning did we have prayer yet for memo or no no it wasn't was it announced or said okay so we're going to have special prayer for my grandmother who's still suffering with her back and so we've had prayer for her Wednesday but we're like that woman we talked about we're going to keep knocking and then say Lord would you touch her amen we believe that he will we just want to make a couple announcements uh one uh is concerning Youth Camp and this isn't this is just uh to uh just a brief announcement there'll be more announcements coming from Brother Jason to Mars and and myself just as we get closer and closer but just a couple things I just want to keep it on your mind Amen to the church those that are here I know that we have a lot of people out today traveling and so we want to make sure this just gets said to the whole church but Youth Camp is coming up as we know registration is opening on October 19th and so October I'm sorry June forgive me the word corrects the air amen correct the air and make sure if anybody if I say anything right now just please correct me uh June chapter uh June June chapter and verse I need to get to my thought but I need to make these announcements too uh June 19th we have registration opening and so we want to just put that as a reminder because our young people this is your opportunity as our youth group here to register uh to get online and register and so there's some that have want to register don't have the funds today uh and don't have the funds by the 19th and so we want to just make make you aware that if that's your case and you need to register but you won't have the the funds by the 19th then just let us know that come to us and let us know that you can't some already have and we will hold your place and give you an extension on that if you need a little bit more time we can't do that very far and take that too far but we do we would do we do want to make sure all of our young people have the opportunity to register and to go and so if you don't and Camp gets full as we said the last two years we can't let you in we can't give you a spot there's only so many beds so if you miss your opportunity this is Mercy so don't spurn Mercy there's only judgment after you spurn Mercy this is warning before judgment so make sure you get registered also we need a as we've told you before there's a work crew that is necessary very much necessary of 40 people is that right 45 people to work in the kitchen and and your the fee for that is 99 I believe I should have had my notes here for that but the fee for that covers your lodging covers your Mills also but as our church we're reaching out to other churches other believers to make that known that we do need a work crew we have to have it actually it's not a it's a requirement for uh Carolina point for the camp so if it's on your heart to help this year and you think that you could come and serve in that capacity brother Jason will be making more announcements specifically we'll send something out to the church on exactly what the requirements are and what we need but I just want to make a plea for that today that we really do need our church before other churches to step up and uh and and help it's a it's a it's a it's a great help it's a labor of love and sacrifice to the young people but we do need those roles filled and so we'll announce more um more of that so I would say quite simply if you have a desire to come and help and many over the last two years have came to us and said I'd like to help it with youth camp well now's your opportunity now's your chance to do that we have spots for you to fulfill and so if you're wanting to do that the registration deadline for that is uh August 1st I believe is what we've said and so uh those are my announcements I don't have anything else here you love the Lord Jesus amen we just wanted to put that before you to make sure you're aware of that we're coming up on that date June 11th today so just uh just a few days away uh from that Ezekiel chapter two if you have your Bible we'll just begin reading here we want to just continue on with our thought that we took last Sunday give me the word and this will be part three and he said unto me son of man stand upon thy feet and I will speak unto thee and the spirit entered me when he spoke unto me and set me upon my feet that I heard him that spake unto me and he said unto me son of man I send thee to children of Israel to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me they and their fathers have turned grassed against me even unto this very day for they are impudent children and stiff-hearted I do send thee unto them and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the Lord God and they whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for their rebellious house yet shalt know that there hath been a prophet among them and now son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words though Briars and Thorns be with thee and thou doest dwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house do you think this is a good description of the world we live in today we dwell amongst scorpions he says Thorns be with thee yet I'm going to give you a thus saith the Lord not something from you not your own figuring it out I'm going to give you a sure word of Prophecy I'm going to give you I'm going to put my words inside of you not your own words Ezekiel this is going to be the word from the Lord thou shall speak verse 7 Thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are most rebellious but thou son of man hear what I say unto thee be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat now this is an important verse here we're going to draw a text from open thy mouth and eat that I give thee and when I looked Behold a hand was sent unto me and lo a roll of a book was therein and he spread it before me and it was written within and without and there was written there Lamentations and mourning and whoa Revelations if you have your Bible chapter 5 just before you're seated we just want to cover yet one more scripture here and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne of book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I went much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and then one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and behold and lo in the midst of the throne and of the the four beasts and in the midst of the Elder stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the the right hand of him that set upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and four twenty Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials of full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book isn't it awesome when the Lord changes the song and the tempo changes and the atmosphere changes and there's there's the atmosphere of gloom and despair and doom but let me just preach here for a minute while you're standing we're not under the Rhythm and tempo of gloom and doom and despair this is the tempo of Onward Christian Soldiers the lamb hath prevailed Hallelujah and he says they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the Sills thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by the blood of out of every by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation Lord we give you thanks this morning we Rejoice Lord for we've got something to Rejoice about we've got something Lord that you've revealed unto us Lord in this end time day of Darkness Lord day of Gloom day of Despair but Lord to the bride arise Shine for thy light has come we give you thanks this morning Lord we pray God that you would come Lord as you've been so faithful to do as we stand here Lord God in great need of you this morning Lord as we've said many times every Mo every time Lord I come to this spot Lord where I've read my scripture and I'm about to minister what you've laid Upon My Heart Lord I can't help father but just before you Lord to stand here and say who am I Lord God that I would be here behind this desk Lord speaking to your people father but all of us Lord truly feel that way who are we lord to be called your children what Grace this is Lord we humble ourselves now to you Lord to what you're wanting to do we yield our vessel may God you just come and take your word break it Lord to your children we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you could be I knew maybe three weeks ago maybe two two and a half weeks ago that I would preach this sermon today the Lord just in a special way uh told me that and so I know that the Lord has something very specific and the Lord didn't want me to preach it last Sunday he wanted me to preach it today so you just believe that God can use a vessel God can use a man and God's timing is always just right on time and so the Lord Lord I just have great confidence in that that what we're going to speak up today I'm just going to relax amen and yield my vessel and to say exactly what the Holy Spirit wants me to say and I don't want to say anything that he wouldn't want me to say I just want to be obedient to him this morning Ezekiel uh turn keep your Bible open there in Revelations 5 but I'm just going to reference Ezekiel just here for a minute because it's such a parallel to what we read here in Revelations 5 the ending there of chapter two when we're reading about this nation that he's going to speak to and now this is the Book of Ezekiel uh this is years as we said last Sunday this is years after the ten tribes of Israel have went off into captivity into Assyria and now uh 100 years later those tent tribes had ignored the warnings from God's prophets and they had ignored the warning of Amos and God then when they ignored Amos he sends Hosea and and now these same men that were warning them and pleading with them and and and and and now it's it's incredible to think now the only thing left is just two little tribes and these two little tribes had watched had witnessed prophets come ministers Ministry come preach the word of God and they had watched that God's warnings that came through prophets had been spurned and spurned and now judgment was passed and now the ten tribes are taken off into captivity and I and now here's the last two tribes of Israel this is God's family as we said when he's speaking and he's saying this is a rebellious house this is a rebellious people don't don't be afraid of them don't be don't be don't as he tells Jeremiah in another place don't look at their faces you remember that scripture in Jeremiah when Jeremiah's given a scroll and and God tells Jeremiah eat that scroll it'll be sweet in your mouth it'll be bitter in your belly and but God says Jeremiah but I'm gonna I'm going to put something inside of you and don't be dismayed by their facial expressions don't be dismayed by their reactions to the word that I'm giving them and so he says but preach the word you you can't look at circumstances you can't look at the result of what you're preaching is it taking effect is it not taking effect even brother Branham got into this place to where it gave him such a complex because he felt like what he was preaching was just being preached and said amen to but no one ever changed and I come to your churches and you're still the same your women dress the same you're you're still acting the same and I preach and he says they just won't hear me Lord and God brother random commits that in standing in the Gap and says I got just a complex that they wouldn't hear what I had to say and so here you see God admonishing encouraging Ezekiel with the same exact encouragement Ezekiel though they spurn it you've still got to preach it though they reject it you've still got to tell it the though though your family rejects you you've still got to stand though no one goes before you I'm going to put my words my words Ezekiel and sometimes when you stand for the word you stand alone as we preached this here last Sunday and and brother Brandon tells this in in the and and we're just going to go through just a few quotes here just this morning uh bear with me is we just go through some of these and I'll skip if you want to display that I'll skip there's some of these that we're going to cover uh this morning that you got that PowerPoint no if you could display that click diverse uh to slide seven if you could and then I'll control it as as we said standing sometimes for the word you stand alone we're preaching to you this morning don't give me the word and you know that comes at a cost let me just say this the the true word always comes with the cost there's always a price the word of God is free it's a free gift given but when you receive that word there's always a sacrifice there's always a a giving of something you'll never receive what the Lord is trying to give you until you're willing to say Lord no matter what it cost me I want what you want to give me Lord and God really only knows the one who really knows the heart that that's more than just an in verbal confession but it's something that a True Believer wants and so sometimes when you stand as Ezekiel learns for the word you stand alone sometimes you've got to believe what you believe though no one else believes it though no one else accepts it yet when God reveals it to you it's a personal conviction that isn't swayed by your friends it's not swayed by your family it's not swayed by pressure it's not swayed by what's popular when God really convicts you and it it's no longer what my family believes it's no longer what my church practices it's no longer my religious conviction because of what my preacher teaches come on somebody it's it it when it when it when you take the book and when it becomes your your message when when you take the word and it becomes your word and it's not just Mom and Dad in my church and and that's what my dad believed that's what my church believes and that's the practice listen friends we don't have a practice we don't we don't we don't follow the word because of a practice or a discipline or uh you know some type of creed we don't have any Creed here so sometimes you gotta stand alone in fact that's exactly how God wants you to stand in fact that's exactly what the Lord is wanting us to do in in in this age that we live in is to stand alone this is what brother Brandon says here in leadership in 1965. God don't deal with organizations he don't deal with groups he deals with individuals that's right always not in groups individuals one person one person the last days he said I stand at the door knocking If any man not a group not any group If any man will hear my voice and I'll and hear me I'll come in to him and sup see if any man can hear so why do you hang on to some group so uh this is this is not working here Bob I'm not really sure why if you can just control it so why do you hang on hang on to some group when they're all together wrong the Bible said so Revelation 17 it'll all be collected in one group so there's a Harmony as we said Sunday there's a Harmony I wish this worked because I would blink it right now so you can't read ahead there's a Harmony and there's a Unity there's a spirit of of of of of Harmony that's that's at play and the undercurrents of the world and whether even let me just say this here and I won't go to an appear that there's United and it appears that the nation and world is more divided than they've ever been just know that some of those things that Satan puts as as contrast or as polarizing topics he's using those very things that separate people to prepare them for a world order that will unify them all right and so he says he doesn't deal in individuals he deals in groups so there's a Harmony there's a Unity that the world is coming under and the church is involved because he has their pulpits and the the the the education system is involved because he has their minds and the political system is involved and unified because he controls who's in politics so all the world he controls Hollywood that's his headquarters in fact and so he's got a music he's got a he's got a message he's got an atmosphere and he's working towards a Harmony or a Unity now brother Madam says but out of there will come notice it'll all be collected in one group display that please but out of there will come individuals that's right with God not the group right the individual right the individual in the group now we find out then we fuss and go on about we belong to this and we belong to that and that don't mean one thing to God it's you as an individual listen to me young people it's you as an individual you've got to stand on your own feet you're the one that has to make the testimony each one of you has to do that to answer to God for the Revelation now I just want you to catch what the holy spirit is is saying this morning because I don't have some great big boom here so don't wait for it don't wait for the grand finale this is the grand finale just catch on right now you've got to stand on your own feet you're the one that has to make the testimony each one of you has to do that to answer to God for the Revelation look at Jesus that we know oh he says look at Jesus all that we know he was manifested word of God we believe that the Bible said it was well watch notice when he done the Messiah sign so brother Adam says every year the individual stands on their own God doesn't deal with the group God's not looking for a Unity God yes we believe in Brotherhood yes we believe in real Unity yes we believe in in the end thank you brother John yes we believe that that we should be in harmony that family should operate in harmony that families should operate in unity but there's got to be something listen there's got to be something that unites us if there's going to be a uniting time and sign then there's got to be something that we can unite around and it's and it can't be our opinions because that leads to denominationalism it can be our theories because that leads to one-man Ministries and as we said last Sunday there was a one-man Ministry and that was Jesus Christ revealed through a Vindicated son of man prophet and outside of that there is no other one-man Ministry oh I just feel to preach this morning I'm getting ahead of myself there is no one one there is listen to me friends there is no one Pulpit to rule them all there is no one Ministry to correct them all God has not ordained the finefold ministry to correct all the rest of the gifts in the body God has put Ministry and Ministry over local churches and local visions and Sovereign bodies I'm going to keep preaching and Sovereign bodies listen we're part of a global bride that the many member Body of Christ that's all that's not just in America it's all over the entire world or part of a group of brothers who believe like we believe we're part of the family of God but God is not looking for a group Revival he wants a Revival in the heart of each individual and there's not one organization we don't have a headquarters I'm thankful for gifts of God I'm thankful for men who are gifted that I glean from and teachers that I gleaned from and and Men of God but let me just say this they're not perfect and I'm not perfect there's only one thing that's perfect and that's the revealed word so he's so so let me get to my thought here this morning so they they ignored the voices of God they ignored the voice of God that was revealed through a prophet now Ezekiel comes to them and watched I think it's so incredible they had watched over and over you can blink that display they had watched over and over prophets coming warning coming and then judgment comes and they're taken into captivity and yet you look at historically when ezekiel's coming to minister here yet Judah here's Benjamin here's the last two tribes and they're more backslidden then the tin tribes who were just taken away I was just reading just the history of this throughout the the uh uh wasn't Josephus but another historian here about just the condition of of God's people and it's incredible because they were actually worse and I thought to myself about how how can you watch your brothers and your sisters to see the the visible evidence of God's warning and then judgment come to pass and somehow you ignore it they they watched what ignoring a prophet's message brings and so now here's Ezekiel the voice of warning the voice of impending judgment and so was it what what is it listen what is it about human nature that we can watch the word of God be fulfilled to the letter and yet stubbornness to let go of things that the word is calling us out on yet we hold on to those things what is it in the nature of people what is it the nature of even God's family and and we can't just put this out out here outside thank you brother but what is it in the nature of people that we could hear the word of God and I'm identifying myself here this morning this isn't this is Brother Matt preaching at brother Matt that we can know the word of God then the instruction of the word of God the voice of God we can watch what happens around us but if we're not careful we get Bewitched as we spoke of Balaam we get lackadaisical we get out of tune with the harmony and the of the word and we get in tune with the gospel of Hollywood and we can hear and watch the signs all around us we can see this The Voice we can hear the voice of the Sun and yet they be just become more stubborn and and they ignored the warnings from Isaiah they in fact they got harder the more this is what's incredible it's the more Isaiah preached the harder they got now that's what the that's what the preaching of the true gospel will do it'll either soften your heart or Harden your heart and it all depends on how you receive it so they actually got harder the more the more Isaiah preached this is actually the the what you could read this in the book of Isaiah where the the children of Israel said we're fed up with Isaiah we're fed up we don't want to hear it anymore don't prophesy us don't don't the prophets don't Prof they say to their prophets don't prophesy into their seers don't see what a condition to get into prophesying this lies tell us deceits that they ignored the prophet Micah they ignored the Prophet Jeremiah the the habakkuk is another Prophet that comes right before Ezekiel and he gives them the same warning the same the same thing but here God comes to Ezekiel and look at Ezekiel chapter 2 chapter one if you could just quickly Ezekiel 1 just quickly if you could turn there Ezekiel chapter one notice this and he says here no let's go to let's go to chapter two let's go to our our text and he said unto me son of man now this is amazing that he calls him this he says unto him son of man prophesy you you have that in ezekiel's drought the vision of the dry bones later in the end of the of the book and Ezekiel the Lord is saying son of man prophesy and he says say unto the bones can they live and and he and he says any and he uses this phrase you know now I I could stand correction but I think I'm correct on this that the Bible never there's no other place that a prophet's called son of man except Jesus in the New Testament but Ezekiel there's something different about the ministry of this man Ezekiel as we know he was the last this is some of the last words that they're going to hear so he was the prophet called son of man and and so you here's here's something powerful about him he was a prophet and he was also a priest I'm not sure where the connection I'm not making a connection of that today but he shows the Bible calls him the son of man now listen to what brother Branham begins to say here and we're just going to take just a little a little turn here and then we'll come back to our scripture so can you bear with me and just keep your attention here this morning because I don't I I didn't feel fully prepared to preach what I'm about to go through myself but the Lord just just made me so we're going to you all right listen to my brother random says if you could put that PowerPoint look at Jesus all that we knowed he was this is the identify the identified Christ of all ages let me pull it up here to make sure I follow along uh with you look at Jesus oh that we knowed he was the manifested word of God we believe that the Bible said it was well watch when he'd done his Messiah sign the Pharisees that had a little bit of light now listen to this they was good people lived a good Christian Life or and he corrects it or a religious life had a little a little light about them they had organized and a priesthood they had a little light but down on the bottom of their heart they had no Eternal representation in glory so you can have a little bit of religious light but have no Eternal representation now remember remember God's family is made up of of of of of of many different classifications of people we don't have time to teach on that this morning but remember that there's an elected group there's a predestinated group that was predestinated with the seed of God the germ of God the life of God before the foundation of the world remember brother Baron I'm in the church age book he says you didn't he says you didn't become seed and you didn't because you didn't become seed when you were came to an altar and you repent now this is powerful principle that we don't want to gloss over you didn't become seed because you came up to an altar and you repented of all your sins and you gave your heart to the Lord and he says no he says you didn't become seed you didn't you weren't he says you didn't become seed by a new birth you were seed and so therefore you were Reborn and so God has a family with the germ of Life inside of them and so you when you come to them when the message of the hour the truth of the light of the Gospel strikes that seed then brother Branham said the light flashes the word is the light that flashes across that seat and it will come to life and you don't have to beg it you don't have to but you don't have to plead you don't have to pressure it it's the seed of God if you get it in the right atmosphere it will groom and so they had no Eternal representation in glory so when they seen that Supernatural done they said this man is Beelzebub a devil and what happened that put what light they had out amen that put what that little light that they had out what brother Matt I'm gonna make this so simple because they failed to recognize this is what brother random say and when they seen the supernatural they called it blzibub when it was Jehovah Jireh and he says they put what little light they had they put it out but listen to this but here was a little ill-famed woman a prostitute down in her heart well she had a representation of one of God's thoughts amen there she was waited in sin I want to want you to make sure you catch this here she was waited in sin yet in her heart in other words what she was externally was not who she was internally what everybody else seen on the outside was not actually who she was yet to the Pharisee what everybody's seen as a religious person was actually not who they were [Applause] and he says down on her heart she had a representation of one of God's thought there she was weighted in sin but when she seen that happen so when she's seen the sign of the son of man in Jesus when she seen that happen she said sir I believe you're a prophet I know when the Messiah cometh he'll tell us these things what did he do it cleansed her life what a powerful thing that the word recognizing do you realize when you reject the word of God it pollutes and destroys your life but when you accept the word of God it cleans your life [Applause] he was her Redeemer to her because he could lift her up from where she had come from in other words his gospel and his word connect all he could do is hard in the hearts of the Pharisee but to the believer it lifted them up out of where they were and I say today the message of the hour I didn't darken my heart it didn't give me bondage it had the power to lift me up out of who I was and where I was Glory but they said Son of David notice when blind Bartimaeus run out and recognize him David meant King remember son of man son of David Son of God which was Lord this Jew God this is the trial 1964. now we've changed messages so listen but they said Son of David when blind Bartimaeus ran out and recognized him David meant King remember son of man son of David Son of God remember brother random teaches us this I'm just going to pull some notes that I don't have that I don't have on the on the overhead but are on the on the slides but I will have them I will just go through them just for a moment just give me just bear with me just a moment I had to pull it up on my screen so remember brother Branham says that and he says now remember and he says these two words this is God is a provided way in 1962. and he says now remember these two words before I leave you the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ is two different things Christ is now appearing in the fullness when now Christ is now appearing in the fullness of the Papa's power his coming will be afterwards his appearing before his coming now brother random says this he says but they said Son of David remember brother man taught us this that he comes in three son of David Son of God Son of Man now that's not the that this is that we could we could uh re we could show you that in in so many places in the message but I just want to paraphrase some of this because I've got too much that what we could get to today but he says he comes and see remember son of man son of David Son of God which was Lord this Jew got what he asked for because he approached him in the name of son of David the king he wasn't savior listen but he was King now but when the Greek woman the seraphination approached him in the name of son of David he never even as much raised his head he never even as much raised his head she had no claims on him in the name of son of David he wasn't son of David to that Seraph Phoenician woman but when she said Lord then he turned around he was the Lord see Lord he was Lord no son of David to her now why wasn't he recognized the son of man the son of man was the spiritual Revelation now listen to what brother Venom says this now why wasn't he recognized the son of man the son of man was the spiritual Revelation a prophet son of man means Prophet now if you turn over in your Bible to Ezekiel the second chapter and the first verse you'll find out that Ezekiel was the prophet listen Alice lays this out Ezekiel was the prophet the word of God for that day Ezekiel was the prophet the word of God for that day and Jehovah himself called him the son of man Jehovah called him a man the son of man the same as Jesus revealed himself as son of man now where does I I just want to just to turn here just for a minute and I know I keep saying that shape of the matter you're gonna you keep making a lot of turns we're gonna get back don't worry [Applause] that the the Rapture as we as we've taught this here before and so we won't take a lot of time to lay a lot of groundwork but we know that the Rapture of the church is it happens brother random says in three stages and you remember brother random says that all three of those stages the shout the voice and the trumpet brother random says Christ does all three as he's descending now we read that in Revelations 5 turn to Revelation 7 if you can just quickly Revelations chapter 7. I'm sorry chapter 10 chapter 10. and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow is upon his head and his face and his face was as it were the son and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open now this is the same book that you see in Revelations 5 right but in Revelations five it's a closed book now he's got a little book and it's open in his hand or are you with me here this morning this is simple just write that write down where the rubber meets the road for a believer yeah amen and he said his and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to ride and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me fill up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw upon the sea and and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and move on down to verse let's just keep reading it verse six and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that their the than the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared unto his servants the prophets so he says and the voice which I heard from Heaven spoken to me again and said go and take the little notebook so something there's a there's something that takes place from verse 7 and verse 8 right there's a transaction there's a transfer of something that that John is seeing here which is a type of the Bride there's a transaction that here he comes in verse 7 and he says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished and so now that same voice which he heard speaks and says now go and take the book in other words it can't just remain as a sounding Shout but that shout has to now become a voice the same way that God's mind and God's word says to Ezekiel I'll put my words into your mouth and when you say what I say you're the voice of God now this is what son of man meant it meant that it was a Ministry that hadn't that had the voice of God as John as he says here in the voice which heard from Seven sake said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth now listen to what brother Branham says here and this is this is uh 1963 Souls that are in prison and he says but remember all this time Noah was in the ark the bride is sealed in with Christ the last member has been redeemed The Sixth Seal has produced itself you can just you can blank that for a minute the seventh seal brings him back to Earth let's say that again the seventh seal brings him back to Earth the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat down and claimed what he owned what he redeemed is that right it's always been the third pull three is perfection the ministry come to its Perfection when it reproduced Christ again in natural amongst human beings as was predicted as it was in the days of lot oh thank people could go right on preaching thinking they're getting saved believing listen what brother Brandon says here believing they're doing right believing their organizations are growing not even a ray of Hope and if that Vision was that and it's been so hard against women we've come to that hour the door is closed gone already the book is in his hand think of it so brother Brandon begins to say things you'll find this in Souls that are in prison even this in the seventh seal and it's almost time to bring in a correlation and say is this what's taking place is Mercy over are we preaching now to souls that are in prison right now but notice what he points this is the seventh seal in 1963. there was some reason that God led the seven voices be thunder because it must come see we find that Christ the lamb took the book in his hand and he opened the seventh seal but you see it's a hidden Mystery no one knows it it's right along with what he said no one would know his coming they also would not know about this seven Thunder mystery now I'm not preaching on the seven Thunder mystery so don't get scared and fall asleep he says that what no one would know about this seven Thunder mystery so you see this is what I'm going to under I got underline my my notes Here you see it's connected together that much we have an understanding of it today because the rest of it is all unfolded but this is not unfolded but sitting in my room and I heard this and I heard it rather but I've seen it unfold to this seven Thunders now he says that's as far as we can go right there that's as far as we can go right there so you see even even the even as brother branham's beginning to lay this out and you've got to follow the message all the way through and not just stop here at what he says in the seventh seal but as brother Brandon begins to lay this out that the coming of the Lord would come in stages that it wasn't as the church as the nominal church as the religious world thinks today that he'll come down and that the Rapture of the church the coming of the Lord the second coming would be when Christ comes down in a a great the sky opens up and a red carpet rolls down and then Jesus walks out and and all and everybody sees him and falls down and worships him they even let me go further and say it's not it's not people just disappearing that's not all that it is it's not the Rapture is not just I want to get your minds here this morning the Rapture is not just a moment in an instant that's been called that that's been waiting and then it happens and then it's over but the Rapture is a accumulation or a condensing or a or a cycle that takes place and so the coming of the Lord is brother Brandon would say he would come as Son of God he'd come as son of David he would come as son of man so there had to be the coming or the appearing of the Lord that that that would come to as brother Madam says take to to to prepare the people there had to be a word that silenced the voices of opinions of what he was and of who he was and of who he's going to be as we know today as we've said here before there's hundreds of denominations and hun thousands of denominations and thousands of ideas if you just sit down and ask yourself the simple question why do some Churches why why are there why are there so many thousands of churches with ideas about not just Christ but about his church about his body about how they conduct Church how they operate church we have so many different flavors in the world today and you say why are there so many interpretations yet they have one book hello there's one book and yet out of that one book there could come a thought on baptism that varies from one Church to the next to the next to the next to the next there's there's a thought on predestination that comes from one Church to One Church to the church to the next Church there's thoughts on how how how women should dress from one Church to the next Church to the next Church to the next Church there's thoughts on on on you can name any category here today not just biblical Doctrine not just that they differ on Election not that they just differ on the coming of the Lord and the Rapture the Millennium the tribulation but in every category through one book there's a thousand thousands of voices with different opinions so what did God have to do God would have to sin The Voice a loud voice why was it allowed voices when a lion roared because it wasn't just going to be the another opinion of man wow it wasn't just going to be a well I think or I I think this is what it means wasn't even just going to be a teaching it was going to be a loud voice yes as when a lion roarth so what happens when a line Roars all the other voices fall silent hello somebody all the other voices fall silent and so brother random says here continue on our slides if you could and I know I'm laying a lot of this in here and so just give me some time just here for a moment bear with me I know you believe the message so I take great comfort in what I'm reading even if you you wouldn't misunderstand something that I'm saying this morning we got we got Believers here so Ezekiel was the prophet he was the word of God for that day and Jehovah himself called him the son of man Jehovah called him a man now notice the promise of the word listen in the Bold the promised word of that hour being made manifest same God God of ezekiel's time God of Jesus time son of man now listen to what brother Adam says here he was the son of man because he had come to reveal himself to Israel as a prophet and they rejected it and that was the prophecy that they should receive him in the name of the son of man a prophet because it was according to the word Deuteronomy 18 15 the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like it unto me and when he come he identified himself in his ministry as a man not a son of God son of man God is a spirit he revealed himself as a son of man what he claimed to be and they was blind and they was blinded and they couldn't see it Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom now he points this to Revelation I'm sorry to to Luke 17 Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom when the son of man is being revealed in the days of Sodom was the son that was God revealed in human flesh which was one time brother Adam says called Melchizedek the father Melchizedek at that time had no father no mother no beginning of days no wonder in her life ever who he was he remained the same Jesus had father and mother but this man had neither father nor mother and he appeared to Abraham I lost my place sorry he appeared to Abraham in the form of Son of Man he says he imported it and he appeared in the Abraham in the form of Son of Man Elohim Jehovah now brother Adam says this is what Luke 17 this is what Luke 17 is referring to in the days of the coming of the son of man what was that son of man Ministry it was the ministry of Jesus in a prophet revealed through human flesh now that now now you say for the math that's all that's that's good that's wonderful we believe that we say we say Amen to that uh uh we we believe now listen to what brother Brandon says here in Legacy in church change I'm going to skip down to the very bottom and he says now I said a moment ago that the false Vine come into full fruition in this age her fruit would mature and ripen that's correct this evil spirited Church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into a tree where in launch the fowls of the air at her head will be the Antichrist the mystery of iniquity all this is true and if this is true then it must also be true that that bright church WIll mature and her ripeness shall be an identification with her Lord by means of the word and her head will come to her is the mystery of godliness which indeed is Christ and as the false church with all kind of diabolical power made up of political force physical force and demons of Darkness come against this True Vine the True Vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts of power that Jesus did do you believe that as a Believer today so who was the son of man Ministry coming to not just a prophet but that son of man the Christ son of man Jesus revealed in flesh would have to transfer to John the bride she would have to eat the book she would have to prophesy again what does it mean by the man it means that not everything that we not everything that we see that we place in the power of God is not coming just for one man it's coming for a mini-membered body and so much that brother Branham said that she would do the very acts of power that Jesus did as she nears her headstone becoming like him through the word Jesus will come that the bride and groom may be forever United as one [Applause] man you say brother Matt where are you going this morning now I just want to stop here just for a moment and I'm going to take another term I've read all the things that I've read today and all this is what the Lord put up put put on my heart to say and I've read all the things that are that are that are uh how could I say this that our crucial they are Paramount to the believer to recognize that the message of the hour was not doctrines it wasn't books it wasn't tapes it was in stories it was Christ returning right brother random breaches the message who do you say this is and his entire thought is even the premise of the entire trial brother Brandon calls the blind prosecutor and he calls the the the different witnesses to the stand and you can go down to the very end of that sermon and brother random takes this entire message in the trial and we we we won't we we'll just read one more quote from it listen to this here and he says Mr prosecutor I want you to know and he says I want you to know that I could call thousands of witnesses here this afternoon I want you to know that these things that he said that he did we are witnesses that he keeps his word there's a genuine Holy Ghost meeting there is a genuine power of God there's a genuine promise that they shall recover when they lay hands on the sick I want you to know that I want you to know he said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man Revelations 10 promised the whole mystery how are you going to reveal the Mysteries see what Luther left off see what Wesley left off see what Pentecost left off and reveal the secret of the heart to make it the same God through every age which is nothing but God's word being made manifest back to the son of man again look at what I've got underlined here we don't look for now scars we don't look for nail scars we look for the word made manifest I'm preaching you on give me the word notice God promised these things and he does it justice he said I could say more but we'll leave the subject it's getting late we don't look for now scars we look for the word you say for the man did Brother Bear them not believe in the nail scarred Jesus did he not believe that in the physical Corporal return absolutely he did that's he says well of course we believe that's what Believers believe but to to fail to recognize that Jesus is his word and his word came down and was restored is to miss the return of Christ let me see this further he's not coming corporally physically to Rapture and to put snatch out of church to a people that hasn't recognized him in his word [Applause] that what was it that's why brother Brandon points to what is that pillar what is that that cloud that appeared in Arizona that's our Lord up there what was that it was the headship as brother and we just read it as she nears her headship comes to her she becomes into that that word the prophet of God says the Church of God it's becoming the bride all the time by believing the word of God [Applause] by believing the word of God how am I becoming the bride brother man how am I becoming what I'm hearing preached by believing the word of God by hearing the word of God can you say Amen but by hearing the word of God but let me give you the scripture how shall they hear unless there be a preacher how shall they hear unless there be a preacher is that what the word of God says how shall they hear and so so there's got to be a Ministry the the the the the the same chapter says for Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God how how do we become the bride by how are we becoming the bride how are we coming into his very image by coming to a church by by calling herself a Believer by by saying that we believe the message Faith cometh by hearing [Applause] now hearing is not just what you do listen to me hearing is not just what you're doing right now through your ears because let me say this you can be deaf and be able to read the word of God and you're still hearing the word of God and you can have full perfect hearing and be deaf to the word of God and not hear it at all so how do we become the word brother man by hearing Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God so what brings rapturing Faith hearing the word of God why do we cover even some of these things that we've covered here just in the last 15 minutes about the ministry of the son of man that it was that it's essential it is Paramount it's essential that you see that this message that you believe is not just something that you lay upon a shelf it's not something that you just come and confess and profess that you're a Believer but you've got to eat it you've got to consume it it's got to become you the bride has become the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word of God he says there in our quote that we read in in in in in the ladies in church age as she nears her headstone becoming like him through the word how do we become like him through the word and it's so amazing to me I'm just going to going to going to say this it's so amazing to me how when you preach these things and you display those things and I want to be very very careful how we say this because I believe we're all believers here but it's so amazing how people the nature of a Believer can sort of tune out and I'm I'm giving you the word I'm not just giving you the word I'm giving you your word I'm giving you your message I'm giving you your message I'm giving you the recognizing Christ this is Christ and yet these are some of the things I just wrote some notes here even just leading up to knowing I was going to be preaching this morning and some some of these things here I got a question for you today and I'm going to get very practical how many of you have a cell phone this morning I want you to take that cell phone out right now you have permission to do it brother Luther sit stay seated don't get don't get upset take that cell phone out and hold it up hold it up high I want everybody to see it how many of

recognize something how many of you have a have any Social account maybe to name your Social account you got be real or you got truth me uh whatever Donald Trump's uh Tick Tock to Twitter platform is truth social but now I want you to raise your hand how many of you have your own personal copy of the church age book that you study and you read now that's okay how many of you have your own if we were to go into your screen time because Apple and Google and Android has a very powerful feature called screen time and you can go in there and you could look and see what apps you have open and how long and how many hours you spend I'd invite all of us to do that and I promise to say how many have the table out I would sure hope every believer in this room would raise their hand and say I have the table app on my phone at least my generation should be raising their hand to say that I have the table up but go into your screen time how often is that table ah being used but how often is your screen time screen time period for Instagram and Tick Tock and Snapchat and be real and Facebook and and any other any other name or app that you want to name this morning friends I'm using this just to show you to let you recognize do you realize this is your message and if you're not eating this and you're eating Facebook and Instagram and you're eating all screen time from every other kind of hearing every kind of voice how will you receive faith faith comes by hearing I know this is so so so simple and so practical but I couldn't get away from it the Lord just just burned me burned me up with just something so simple here for Sunday morning if I say nothing else and I just say this then I'll know I've delivered my thought how many of you I'll go back to it how many of us have our own personal copy of the church age book that our faces in this have we de-emphasized not deified but have we de-emphasized the voice of God's prophet to the Bride of Jesus Christ let me go further and just tell you exactly the way the Lord spoke to me in a day an hour where there's a perversion of the of of of of of of a doctrine that would say shut up and push play in the face of that here's what I say push play here's what I say listen to God's voice here's what I say if there was ever a time to push play oh my brother it's right now it's not a time to stop preaching but it's not also a time to stop pushing play it's not a time to stop hearing God's voice oh I should have got a louder a man than that this morning how do you expect to defeat the enemy in your life how do we expect to defeat the onslaught of the devil on our minds in mind Warfare in an age of anxiety and stress and depression and fear how do we expect to be exempt from the spirits that have been released and permeated upon this generation if we're not using the sword that God gave us to fight the devil with I just want to remind you this is your sword you say brother Matt you're not holding up your Bible That's because I can hold up both of them and say this is your sword and it's a perversion to try to separate these two amen it's a perversion from the devil to try to get you to separate the two you can't separate the word from the word it's the word that you've been you know it may not be your word but not to say it's my word it may not be your weapon but it's my weapon this morning it's your rapture it's your faith it's your body change do we recognize this how do you expect to defeat the enemy if you're not receiving the word I come to this sermon today and I say give me the word but what does that mean brother man what does that mean give me the word how do we expect if we're not investing our time reading and hearing yeah the word and I say more than reading and hearing fellowshipping with the word do you know you can fellowship with the word do you know that I've learned in my life I can read the word and hear the word and leave never having fellowshipped with the word I can take it all in I can assimilate it I can study it and completely Miss Fellowship with the word I want I want to fellowship with him you'll find let me just say this if you would invest if we would invest more time reading and hearing and more than that fellowshipping with the word of the hour I'm not just talking about a devotion I'm not just talking about in the morning with coffee that's wonderful and I want to make it clear I'm not de-emphasizing that you have to have a regimen you have to be disciplined you should have a a study a portion of your day that's spent with the Lord you should be on your knees in the morning there should be a discipline that but but let me just say this beyond the discipline there's got to be a fellowship with the word [Applause] there's got to be a fellowship where you hear the voice behind The Voice and I would be willing to say that if you would start fellow stop looking to stop looking to every other kind of Avenue for your answers that plague your mind and start fellowshipping with the word and watch what happens to your life young people you battle Depression start fellowshipping with the word sisters you battle suicidal spirits and that's real in this generation start fellowshipping with the word Brothers you battle of temper and you battle anger start fellowshipping with the word tip of the map will that fix my problem let me say this just reading it won't just hearing it physically won't but fellowshipping with it will say four-time fellowshipping with the word of God that was sent you'd find Victory where there has been years of defeat [Applause] and I don't know about you but I want victory in my life I want to stop going down the same roads in the sale how many are with me here this morning to say I want Victory I want something to fight the devil with you've got it here this morning I say make yours make you Avail yourself of what God sent to you in this generation you got to hear the word you've got a fellowship with the word how many times have you I'll just go and say this how many times have you turned on a tape of God's prophet and when you got done you were depressed how many times have you read your Bible and studied the word of God and left filling sad how many times have you got off of your knees in communion with the Holy Spirit and you felt anxiety when you said amen how many times have you have you listened to the word of God and you fellowship with the word I'm not just talking about background music I'm talking about when you're really tuned in with the Holy Spirit you remember the man who needs to be studying this message you do who needs to be studying this message you do and if you don't if you're not reading it if you're not feeding it how will you prophesy again John if you don't take it and consume it and eat it how will you become how are you near The Headstone and operate the very works of Jesus how many times have you turned on a tape how many times have you have You Have you listened to the word of God and you left feeling discouraged and anxious and stressed how about how many times have you have you got down on your knees in prayer and you got up afraid are fearful are gripping fear but yet how many times have you tuned in subconsciously to Facebook Instagram Snapchat be real Tick Tock YouTube because a lot of y'all said oh yeah I'm I'm free I didn't have to raise my hand any of those social accounts [Music] and everybody went uh how many times have you tuned into that and felt fearful anxious don't you realize that the thing that you're trying to defeat your feeding do we realize as Believers we can become just like the rest of the world anxious fearful stressed worried troubled depressed suicidal you say brother Matt real Believers real Believers can get to that place but I promised you it never comes as the result of fellowshipping with the word [Applause] it never comes as the result of fellowshipping with the Lord and having your lives and Harmony in tune with the Holy Spirit it always comes from in putting and feeding on the very thing you're wanting victory and I want to get over it and I want I want over my depression then I say stop feeding your depression and start feeding the word of God start putting the word of God in your mouth confessing what the word says sharing what the prophet of God says it's time and I want to make this I just want to keep coming back to it to make sure I don't finish and feel like I didn't say what the Lord told me to say if there was ever a time to push play now and I'm not going to allow the devil to take a person who's taken that totally in perversion and and gone the wrong way with it God help them God delivered them from that evil demon spirit but I'm not going to allow that scarecrow to keep me out of my inheritance because when I listen to God's Prophet I'm hearing my inheritance this is how I fight my battles this is how I get victory in my life this is how I I free myself of anxiety and stress when I'm worried I turn to the word when I'm fearful I turn to the only thing that's absolute in my life I turn to the only thing that's sure that's unchanging I turn to the word Ezekiel 33 verse 11 say unto them as I live saith the Lord God Ezekiel 33 verse 11. say unto them as I say I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live Ezekiel 33 verse 11. and he says say to them eyes I live saith the Lord God I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live if God wants the wicked to live how much more does he want his children and his family to live [Music] turn you turn you from your evil ways and this is the question so powerful I want to I want it just to sink in your hearts each individual here for why will you die oh House of Israel for why will you die you don't have to there's a solution to your problem You Don't Have To Die In Your wilderness you don't have to die in your anxiety you don't have to die in that condition You Don't Have To Die For What so then why would you as God tells you Ezekiel to say to the house of Israel I've given you everything that you need you have the answer it's already here the answer that you need that you're searching so desperately for to fix your problem I've got to fix my home how am I going to get to it and you contemplate a I've got this situation with my children I got this situation with an unsaved loved and I got this problem in my family this this thing's out of order and I got to bring it to order what am I gonna if we're not careful the devil will just pile on it and pile on and pile on let me just give you some good news the answer is right here I want to tell you this morning you don't need to look past the word for your answer [Music] the answer is right here but you say brother Matt what do I've got to do what do I have to do you have if you don't eat it John if it just stays the book that's open in the hands of the angel you'll never prophesy again if you don't consume it if you don't eat it if you don't if it's not your daily bread and your daily portion if you're not hearing the voice of God's prophet as I could say that to Israel God sent you a prophet and it wasn't his words it was the words from the Throne of God given to the words of the mouth of a prophet but you've got to not just hear it you've got to obey it you've got to heat it you've got to consume it you've got to say Lord I want to become it you've got to surrender to it how many hands would go up and say I want to surrender to it I want to believe it not just believe it I want to obey it I want to I want to read it and I want to understand I want to consume I want it to become if there was ever a time and I'm just going to keep going back to this if there was ever a Time to be in the message of the hour to have your Bible opened and to have the message of the hour to say here's here Lord here's this problem in the world that I see today and I know and I believe that the answer has already been given if there was ever a time to not just be coming to church hearing a preacher preach the word that's wonderful that's good there's a time for Fellowship there's a time to come to the house of God and hear the word of God but if there was ever a time where the were the Bride of Jesus Christ needs to say give me the word Lord it's now and you say man you believe it this morning if there was ever a Time to be able to discern the truth from the LIE and that's a voice that Satan speaks to you he gives you the voice of Lies but God gives you the Voice of Truth and if there was ever a time to use the voice of Truth God gave you to silence the LIE of the devil it's right now my brother and my sister if there was ever a time where a people needs to have spiritual discernment and be equipped to do spiritual warfare it's right now can I get an amen this morning if there was ever a time to put on the whole armor of God to take you as Ephesians 6 says put on the whole armor of God you've got to put it on you can't just look at it you can't just confess it you can't just mentally think and I'm trying to use as many words as I can to get you to understand how how practical I am today if there was ever a time to not just imagine it but to consume it and take it to yourself [Music] I challenge you this morning look at your screen time on your phone look at how much time you're sent you're spending do it for your children you do it for your children say brother Matt why why because this is if there was ever a Time that we need to make sure we are putting the word of God that he sent and putting it in our mouth and consuming it it's red and we put everything else we meaning me and you are guilty this morning in our lives I don't care who you are from the front to the back door all of us have been guilty at times in our life at not at putting the wrong things in our mouth not the thing that God intended for you a stamp buy your heads with me every head bowed Every Act close Lord we're living in a an hour father that when we look around father even not just to hear in in this nation but all nations of the Earth we are seeing the Fulfillment of what you spoke Lord we're seeing the Fulfillment Lord of a generation of people to where the Bible says that and your Prophet said it further and said that the world would go completely insane the Bible says they would grope in the Darkness that they would call light Darkness they would call Darkness light or living in a world Lord where there's confusion father in a world where people are looking for answers as the as your word said that that knowledge in the Book of Daniel knowledge would increase they would ever be ever learning but never able to come into the knowledge of the truth musicians could you come never able to come to the knowledge of the truth we live in those times Lord we look around us and we see it's evident we see it's evident Lord that your words being fulfilled on a daily basis Lord a world that's more addicted more depressed more anxious more fearful truly Lord we're living in the days of Sodom surely Lord we're living in the days of the Fulfillment of everything that was spoken about the end time this is it Lord we've got the words of Ezekiel that I Echo today and I say it Lord to me I raise my hands and say it to myself why will you die why will you child you don't have to you've got something you've got the answer that you need it's laying in the word they've got the answer that you need it's on your phone already it's on your computer it's on your laptop it's not far from you in fact it's closer to you than it's ever been before [Music] will you not read it will you not hear it or were you will you continue to consume everything that's causing that depression everything that's causing that doubt everything that's causing that fear [Music] oh why will you die is there no bomb and Gilead this morning [Music] Lord help us help us one and all Lord very sobering but I believe Lord you're right on time this morning I don't know why Lord you've had me speak what I've spoke today but I Trust You Lord today Lord It's a time just for a moment let us evaluate as the word says let a man examine himself let us make our call in an election sure I pray God I invite every person here under the sound of my voice those that are here gathered those that will stream this later those that are alive listening in but we take just a moment in evaluate say what am I fitting on what I come to church and I hear the word of God being preached but really am I really consuming the word am I really on a daily basis come on be honest friends let's be honest with each other [Music] are we hearing or are we content that we've heard and everything the Lord wants to say he's already spoken and I'm a Believer in that that's enough no the Lord the holy spirit is still wanting to speak he's still wanting to fellowship and I just want to raise a hand and say Lord let me always make myself available to you when you want to Fellowship Lord then I just want to fellowship with you I want to open every door Lord in my heart and let you come in I don't just want to hear it Lord with my ears I want to hear it in my heart I want that word to Echo [Music] when I'm in a moment of Temptation let that word Echo out from my heart oh God when I'm in a moment in a fearful situation and I don't have the answer and I don't know what to do let me remember I just gotta look to the rock of my salvation as David said when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to a rock that is higher than I and you've given us that sure word that rock of our Salvation you've given it to us Lord when I'm in a moment Lord and I feel like oh everything's collapsing let me say give me the word oh God let me look to the word hurts the word Lord that changes word Lord that sets free the word that gives faith the word that changes men's hearts and leads them to repentance it's not an emotion it's not just a not just a a disciplined academic study it's not that Lord you didn't send it for that you sent it as a lord so that you can commune with us man to man Lord I pray God that we would have that relationship like Moses as the Bible says that he spoke as a man speaks to his friend let me have that kind of relationship with you Lord where I could say father your friend and I'm your friend and I just want to talk to you I just want to fellowship with you Lord I've got so much I want to say how much more do you have to say to me Lord tune me God I pray tune our hearts tune our ears Lord listen when you want to speak open our eyes

that's inside of me would you come with your word would you drive back any Spirit of depression in my family how many could raise the hand and say Lord I want you to come father and would you clean out every every Spirit anything Lord that I've ingested anything that I fed on the wrong thing and now it's fed something inside of me but God I believe that your word can set us free this morning I want to say Lord would you come and clean me of any anxiety of any fear that maybe is laying there uncovered I pray oh God you'd come with a light of your word would you come and deliver your children I pray God there's there's father there's freedom in the name of Jesus there's Freedom From Fear there is freedom from depression there's freedom from suicidal Devils there's freedom from lives of of

come with a cleansing there's that little woman your Prophet said that representation and when she recognize that word it cleaned her life bring that word Lord God that cleans us this morning bring us
