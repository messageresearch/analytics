[0:00] Wednesday night
[0:02] um on the gene of God that's part two
[0:04] and uh
[0:07] turn it on then it'll work hopefully
[0:10] yes it will
[0:12] so we're going to be looking at the
[0:14] nature of man's life its source as well
[0:17] as immortality and the injection of
[0:19] death and destruction we want to relate
[0:22] all that back to election
[0:24] and the genetics of the human race from
[0:26] the Garden of Eden all the way to the
[0:28] New Jerusalem we won't do that today all
[0:30] that today in Sunday School
[0:33] but that's our purpose in this topic
[0:36] and First John 3 7-9 we want to read
[0:39] little children
[0:41] let no man deceive you he that doeth
[0:44] righteousness is righteous even as he is
[0:46] righteous he that committeth sin is of
[0:49] the devil for the devil's sins from the
[0:51] beginning for this purpose the Son of
[0:53] God was manifested that he might destroy
[0:56] the works of the devil
[0:58] whosoever is born of God doth not commit
[1:00] sin for his seed remadeth in him and he
[1:03] cannot sin because he is born of God
[1:07] may the Lord have the blessing to the
[1:08] reading of his word you can be seated
[1:13] and so this is look this scripture is
[1:16] looking at the the the fruit
[1:19] of the life that is behind the seed
[1:24] so if John is saying if you're
[1:28] living a righteous life then that
[1:31] manifests that you're born of God if
[1:34] you're if you're committing sin
[1:36] that means it's manifesting here from
[1:38] the Devil
[1:40] and you could say well we all sin and
[1:42] and fall short of the glory of God
[1:43] absolutely that is correct but we're
[1:46] looking at the end fruit result of
[1:49] confrontation with the manifested word
[1:52] for your day
[1:54] right sin is unbelief
[1:57] smoking cigarettes is not sin
[2:00] brother Branham always says that and
[2:01] people get so offended
[2:03] wearing pants on a woman cutting your
[2:06] hair all that is not sin it's simply the
[2:09] attributes of sin the Holy Spirit comes
[2:13] to
[2:14] condemn the world why do they why does
[2:16] he condemn the world because they smoke
[2:17] and drink no the holy spirit will come
[2:20] and condemn the world because they don't
[2:22] believe in Jesus Christ
[2:25] in other words they don't have faith
[2:27] that's what the condemnation is that's
[2:29] what the unforgivable sin is Abiding and
[2:32] unbelief and so he that commits sin he
[2:35] that unbelieves is of the devil
[2:38] whoever is born of God does not commit
[2:40] sin whoever's born of God believes
[2:41] doesn't mean that we don't
[2:44] commit sins doesn't mean we don't do
[2:47] things that we need to repent of
[2:49] scripture is very clear that until we
[2:51] get a new body and our immortality we're
[2:55] going to have sin that we need to make
[2:58] right that we need to repent of that's
[2:59] not the issue that this verse is
[3:01] speaking of this verse is telling us
[3:04] you you don't believe you don't
[3:06] disbelieve the word
[3:08] when you're born of God when you come
[3:10] out you're birthed out from God when the
[3:14] word comes to you you believe it you
[3:15] receive it
[3:20] that's the end result that's what God
[3:22] created us to be but there's a whole lot
[3:26] on the in between
[3:28] Genesis 2 16 and 17 says and the Lord
[3:30] God commanded the man saying of every
[3:33] tree of the garden now may is freely eat
[3:35] but of the tree of the knowledge of Good
[3:36] and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in
[3:38] the day that thou eatest thereof Thou
[3:39] shalt surely die that's the condemnation
[3:42] that that is the Judgment of God if you
[3:46] eat of this tree
[3:49] you'll die and if we see the
[3:50] confrontation of Eve and the serpent
[3:52] what is her Original Sin
[3:56] while we said we are many times we say
[3:58] it's sex well in in a way the reality is
[4:02] it started with unbelief
[4:04] she heard the word twisted and she
[4:06] accepted the word twisted
[4:09] her faith connected with the wrong word
[4:12] and because of that through the whole
[4:14] human race into sin brought forth in in
[4:17] her mind first it was conceived in her
[4:20] sin was conceived in her mind then it
[4:22] was conceived in her womb
[4:25] right and so so that's the judgment
[4:28] Adam was created and Eve was created
[4:30] immortal
[4:32] they were only subject to death if they
[4:35] ate of the tree of the knowledge of Good
[4:38] and Evil
[4:40] and God does not say the punishment for
[4:42] sin is eternal conscious torment in a
[4:44] burning Hill it says it's death
[4:47] death means ceasing to exist
[4:50] all right
[4:53] so they ate of the tree of the knowledge
[4:54] of Good and Evil this resulted in
[4:56] inherited death inherited sin nature for
[4:58] the human race Romans 5 12. I'm going
[5:01] quick if you're here on Wednesday night
[5:02] you know why I'm going quick because
[5:03] this is all review wherefore as by one
[5:06] man's sin entered into the world and
[5:07] death by sin and so death passed upon
[5:10] all men for that all have sinned
[5:14] so this is we get the same punishment as
[5:17] Adam because he was the head of the
[5:18] human race so we receive what he
[5:20] receives thank God
[5:23] he was replaced there was a second man
[5:26] the Lord From Heaven and we in him we
[5:30] receive life
[5:35] and we went over these words the two
[5:37] words we talked about ion and Ionia and
[5:39] we're going to look at every time we
[5:41] looked every time ion was used we're not
[5:43] going to look at every time again we're
[5:45] going to look at a few just to
[5:46] demonstrate if you see the definition
[5:48] there ion sometimes it's translated
[5:51] Eternal sometimes age sometimes World
[5:54] sometimes a Messianic period
[5:58] translated many different ways
[6:03] you see the heading there is the word
[6:05] Eternal the same as Immortal well
[6:07] in English yes but looking at the Greek
[6:11] when we when we look at the Greek we
[6:13] can't take ion and make it be eternal
[6:16] across the board here's what we would do
[6:19] here Colossians 1 26 even the mystery
[6:21] which has been hid from eternity and
[6:24] from Generations but now is made
[6:26] manifest to this two of saints again it
[6:28] doesn't make sense
[6:29] hid from ages that's
[6:32] that's correct
[6:35] second Timothy 4 10 for Demas has
[6:37] forsaken me having loved this present
[6:39] eternity
[6:41] again this is this the word ion is used
[6:44] in conjunction with a word that
[6:46] signifies time present tense
[6:49] so this present age or this present
[6:52] world
[6:55] First Corinthians 2 7 but we speak the
[6:58] wisdom of God in a mystery even the
[7:01] hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[7:05] eternity unto our Glory
[7:07] again doesn't make sense there's no
[7:09] before eternity The Eternity has no
[7:12] beginning and no ending but this word
[7:13] ion is used in conjunction again with
[7:17] beef the term before connection to time
[7:19] it's speaking of an age or a period of
[7:22] time
[7:25] here's another word that's translated as
[7:27] Eternal ionios closely connected the
[7:29] other one and you see in the Thayer
[7:31] definition this is why I say
[7:33] we have to know our Bible and know the
[7:35] revelation of this message otherwise if
[7:37] you look at the these definitions you'll
[7:41] take it as an absolute the definitions
[7:43] are not the absolute the Bible is
[7:47] and so the Bible will if we study it
[7:50] closely will help us Define itself
[7:54] but usually with the hard-headedness of
[7:57] man it takes God sending a message to
[8:01] correct us
[8:02] but by the Holy Spirit we can compare
[8:04] Genesis to Revelation and that message
[8:06] that we can come to the right Revelation
[8:09] and understanding so here he says
[8:10] without beginning and at end Without End
[8:13] never to cease so the common ways that
[8:16] we use eternal once again
[8:18] failure from the dictionary
[8:21] Romans 16 25 now to him that is a power
[8:24] to establish you according to my gospel
[8:26] and the preaching of Jesus Christ
[8:28] according to the revelation of the
[8:30] mystery which was Kept Secret since
[8:32] eternity began
[8:35] doesn't work since the world began or
[8:37] since the ages began
[8:41] even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the
[8:43] cities about them enlightened manner
[8:44] giving themselves over to fornication
[8:46] going after string strange flesh are set
[8:49] forth for an example suffering the
[8:51] Vengeance of Eternal fire
[8:54] how long did this eternal last
[8:59] foreign
[9:00] it was very quick
[9:02] it it destroyed everything it burnt up
[9:06] and it was done
[9:07] very quickly
[9:09] so that's not a very long eternity right
[9:11] there
[9:13] but the fire is what's Eternal because
[9:16] it's coming from an eternal God
[9:18] but we're not looking at a a verse
[9:22] that's speaking of
[9:24] torment never-ending torment
[9:27] the time period was quick the source of
[9:31] the fire is eternal
[9:35] so we looked at this before we mentioned
[9:37] this the two words in the Greek that are
[9:39] translated as Eternal Everlasting or
[9:41] forever are words that have a varied
[9:43] meaning depending on the context it is
[9:46] used in
[9:48] if used in conjunction with God or life
[9:50] it speaks of the quality of the Almighty
[9:53] which is that he never had a beginning
[9:54] and never had an ending but if it's used
[9:57] in conjunction with punishment or a
[9:58] dispensation it's meaning varies
[10:01] depending on that it speaks of a period
[10:04] of time
[10:06] so again it's you have to see the the
[10:08] context and then the larger context as
[10:10] we looked at before it says the the
[10:14] the the wicked will go into Everlasting
[10:18] or eternal
[10:19] punishment
[10:21] right so we can't just take that verse
[10:24] isolated against the rest of scripture
[10:28] and then come up with a conclusion that
[10:31] makes us reinterpret the whole Bible
[10:34] so in other words you're you have to
[10:36] look at it systematically from Genesis
[10:39] to Revelation to see if what what is
[10:42] this subject first we look in other
[10:43] words first we look at the sentence that
[10:46] it's used in next we look at the book
[10:48] that it's used in after that we looked
[10:50] at it in the realm of what is this
[10:52] Doctrine from Genesis to revelation
[10:56] and how is it developed and how does how
[10:58] is God unfolding it through that
[11:00] otherwise we'll come to a we can come to
[11:04] all kinds of conclusions and people do
[11:06] come to all kinds of conclusions
[11:07] but if we take this General principle
[11:10] and look at it
[11:11] look at its context we can come to a
[11:16] correct revelation
[11:19] so let's look at the verses that are
[11:21] supposedly telling us that there's an
[11:24] eternal hell
[11:28] again our English definition of Eternal
[11:30] that brother Branham gave us shows that
[11:33] hell itself cannot be an unceasing
[11:36] torment
[11:43] Mark 9 43 and 44 and If thy hand offend
[11:47] thee cut it off
[11:49] it is better for thee to enter into life
[11:51] maimed
[11:53] than having uh two hands to go into hell
[11:56] into the fire that never shall be
[11:59] quenched where their worm dieth not and
[12:02] the fire is not quenched oh
[12:09] now we're in trouble
[12:11] remember though the worm and fire don't
[12:14] die
[12:15] never said anything about the person
[12:18] that said into it
[12:20] so again we we have to we have to watch
[12:22] that well why would it make any sense if
[12:24] we're saying that the if the person's
[12:25] cast in there and the worm doesn't die
[12:27] and the fire does not quench what does
[12:29] it mean well first of all
[12:33] what does it mean a worm
[12:35] so when people are sent into hell
[12:37] they're going to be covered with fire
[12:38] and worms
[12:40] you know we have to again this is this
[12:43] is actually a quote of the Old Testament
[12:46] if you're not familiar with it let's
[12:48] look at it Isaiah 66.
[12:51] and they shall go forth and look upon
[12:54] the carcasses of the men that have
[12:56] transgressed against me for their worms
[12:58] shall not die neither shall their fire
[13:01] be quenched and they shall be in a
[13:02] horrible abhoring unto all flesh so it's
[13:06] speaking of the time of God's judgment
[13:10] at the at the end of the tribulation
[13:11] period if you look at Isaiah 66 God is
[13:15] judging the people for what they've done
[13:18] against his word
[13:20] and so the bigger picture is people are
[13:24] alive still going out and looking at
[13:27] what's happening
[13:30] so they've looked and see what's
[13:31] happened as an aft this is like the
[13:33] aftermath of Armageddon you could say
[13:36] and the judgments that fall
[13:38] so now the the aftermath is there's
[13:40] going to be bodies laying around
[13:43] Jerusalem dead burning with worms eating
[13:47] them up that's what your eternity is
[13:48] going to be like
[13:49] in the new Heaven and new earth there's
[13:51] going to be bodies laying around that
[13:53] are getting eaten by worms and on fire
[13:56] how does it make sense
[13:58] it doesn't make sense
[14:00] the worm dies not the Fire doesn't die
[14:02] same thing as Eternal fire
[14:04] how long did the Eternal fire burn long
[14:07] enough to destroy what was necessary
[14:09] this is the context of scripture
[14:14] Matthew 10 28.
[14:16] and fear not them which kill the body
[14:18] but are not able to kill the soul but
[14:21] rather fear him which is able to destroy
[14:23] both
[14:24] soul and Body in hell
[14:29] so if if to kill is to deprive the body
[14:31] of life
[14:33] then hell would seem to be the
[14:34] Declaration of both physical and
[14:36] spiritual life in other words the
[14:39] ultimate purpose of hell is the
[14:42] extinction of being
[14:43] if hell is death and hell are cast into
[14:46] the Lake of Fire this is the second
[14:48] death
[14:49] what is death
[14:52] what is death here
[14:55] when our family passes away we
[14:57] understand the spiritual aspect of it
[14:59] but for us as far as we're concerned
[15:01] death is a cessation of life in this
[15:04] Dimension let's just put it that way
[15:07] they don't live here in this Dimension
[15:09] anymore
[15:09] life has ceased so if there's a second
[15:12] death
[15:13] that is killing the soul
[15:16] so are are we suggesting that God is
[15:19] eternally killing the soul
[15:22] that doesn't make sense at all there's
[15:24] no logic to that killing the soul means
[15:27] the soul is going to go out of existence
[15:32] and God is able to do that we can kill a
[15:35] body only God can kill a soul
[15:41] and another another point is some people
[15:43] they don't understand Soul Spirit body
[15:47] the man has three different parts right
[15:51] well to them they say soul means the
[15:53] whole person the whole being and in some
[15:55] cases it can mean it but in this case
[15:57] why are we separating soul and Body in
[16:00] other words God is God in this verse
[16:03] there's a separation between the in
[16:05] inanimate part the spiritual part of man
[16:08] and the physical part of man so we can
[16:11] kill the physical part only God can kill
[16:13] the spiritual part right so that's
[16:15] what's going to happen that that's what
[16:17] hell does that's the ultimate thing that
[16:19] the Lake of Fire will do is deprive your
[16:22] soul of life
[16:24] brother Branham says
[16:27] he'll die he'll go into a lake of fire
[16:29] and brimstone which burns where burning
[16:31] is going on forever and ever and maybe
[16:33] for a hundred million years his soul may
[16:35] be tormented in a lake of fire and
[16:37] brimstone you say will it just be like
[16:39] regular Brimstone I believe it'll be a
[16:41] million times worse than that I believe
[16:44] you couldn't describe it by fire by a
[16:45] literal fire the only reason it's put by
[16:47] fire that fire is the most consuming
[16:49] thing that we have we we had it
[16:52] absolutely consumes and destroys
[16:54] everything fire does
[16:58] so you see it's perfectly expression
[17:01] that's the reason why fire is used is
[17:04] because it destroys everything so when
[17:07] you see fire it means it's taking
[17:09] something out of existence
[17:13] First Corinthians 1 18 for the preaching
[17:15] of the Cross is to them that perish
[17:17] foolishness but to un unto us which are
[17:21] saved it is the power of God
[17:23] so you see that there's people that are
[17:25] perishing and we're on we were on that
[17:27] road too but someone saved us
[17:31] the power of God comes and saves us out
[17:33] of perishing
[17:37] second Corinthians 2 15 for we are unto
[17:39] God a sweet saver of Christ in them that
[17:42] are saved and in them that perish
[17:46] so here we have again saved and
[17:49] perishing
[17:50] second Thessalonians 2 10 and with all
[17:52] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[17:54] them that perish because they receive
[17:56] not the love of the truth that they
[17:58] might be saved once again same picture
[18:01] some are saved and some are some perish
[18:08] for the wages of sin Romans 6 23 the
[18:11] wages of sin is eternal conscious
[18:14] punishment
[18:15] in hell oh
[18:18] for the wages of sin is death
[18:21] but the gift of God is eternal life
[18:23] through Jesus Christ Our Lord
[18:26] eternal life is a gift
[18:29] it's not what we deserve
[18:31] though we're predestinated to it and we
[18:33] understand the picture behind it
[18:35] that if you have eternal life you always
[18:37] had eternal life but you are in God as
[18:39] one of his thoughts or one of his
[18:41] attributes and then your birth forth
[18:43] but it's not what we deserve we deserve
[18:46] to perish
[18:48] Matthew 7 13 enter ye in at the Straight
[18:51] Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is
[18:53] the way that leads to destruction and
[18:55] many there be which go in there at so we
[18:57] have
[18:59] perishing death and destruction so if
[19:02] hell is eternal
[19:03] then those that perish never perish
[19:06] those who are destroyed are never
[19:08] destroyed and those that die never die
[19:10] how does it mix how does it make any
[19:12] sense at all
[19:19] Revelation 2014 we referred to it before
[19:22] in death in hell were cast into the Lake
[19:24] of Fire
[19:25] this is the second death
[19:29] it's very clear
[19:30] death is a cessation of life
[19:34] they're cast into the Lake of Fire as
[19:35] brother Brandon said they may burn for
[19:38] millions and billions of years I believe
[19:39] that just as we Christians we get a
[19:42] reward based on our works
[19:45] unbelievers will get a reward based on
[19:47] their works
[19:48] if you're Hitler or you're the devil or
[19:51] you're
[19:53] well I won't say any contemporary names
[19:55] but
[19:57] if you're some corrupt politician that's
[19:59] responsible for Millions
[20:01] and millions of death
[20:04] you will receive a just reward you will
[20:08] burn for the time that God has allotted
[20:11] for you and someone that hasn't done
[20:13] that is not going to burn that as long
[20:16] you see what I'm saying it's a judgment
[20:18] of reward
[20:23] so first death
[20:26] physical life is done second death
[20:28] spiritual life
[20:30] is destroyed
[20:32] it's annihilated it goes out of
[20:34] existence
[20:38] Revelation 20 verse 10. and the devil
[20:43] let me get forward here and the devil
[20:45] that deceived them cast was cast into
[20:47] the lake of fired Brimstone where the
[20:50] Beast and the false prophet are and
[20:51] shall be tormented day and night forever
[20:54] and ever again after studying ion
[20:58] it's just it's doubled up the word ion
[21:01] it means a long period of time
[21:08] and again the Beast is not an individual
[21:12] it's an actual it's it's an Empire
[21:16] right it's the it's the political
[21:18] portion of Rome
[21:21] so you know here we have a picture
[21:23] there's I guess there's a spirit behind
[21:25] every Empire lots of spirits behind
[21:28] every Empire
[21:29] and so though all those Beast spirits
[21:32] that are connected to Rome are
[21:35] sent in to this place
[21:38] for
[21:40] the judgment is eternal right
[21:42] the punishment is eternal it means it's
[21:45] not going to change
[21:47] the torment is not eternal it comes to
[21:50] an end
[21:53] Malachi 4 1 for behold the day cometh
[21:55] that shall burn as an oven and all the
[21:56] proud ye and all that do wickedly shall
[21:58] be stubble in the day that cometh shall
[22:00] burn them up saith the Lord of hosts
[22:02] that it shall leave them neither root
[22:04] nor
[22:06] Branch you say well that's the the day
[22:08] of the Lord that's right at the end of
[22:10] the tribulation period or it's the
[22:11] tribulation period that's going to do
[22:13] that but the picture is the wicked are
[22:15] going there's nothing going to be
[22:17] nothing left of the wicked
[22:19] right and so yes Conte in based on the
[22:23] context is this is speaking of the day
[22:25] of the Lord and that's when they're
[22:27] going to be destroyed and the righteous
[22:29] will walk out on the ashes of the wicked
[22:31] yes and you could probably see how
[22:33] that's connected to Isaiah 66 that we
[22:36] looked at
[22:37] previously where they'll will go out and
[22:39] see
[22:41] where the fire is not quenched and where
[22:44] the worm is not destroyed see that's
[22:47] that's connected there but this is
[22:49] bringing us to the ultimate end of the
[22:52] wicked which is nothing's left to them
[22:57] brother Brandon says I don't believe the
[22:59] Bible teaches an eternal burning hell it
[23:01] doesn't because if hell is eternal and
[23:03] people that go there will be punished
[23:05] eternally the only one the way they
[23:07] could be eternally punished they'd have
[23:09] to have eternal life there's only one
[23:11] form of eternal life and that's in God
[23:13] see so they have to come to Annihilation
[23:15] that is their physical part becomes
[23:17] annihilated
[23:18] and then their spiritual part becomes
[23:20] annihilated that's completely consumed
[23:22] there's no more to it neither root nor
[23:24] Branch the Bible calls it they're
[23:26] completely
[23:27] done away
[23:32] and if this is Exodus 21 let's look at a
[23:35] principle here God's principle 23-25 and
[23:39] if any Mischief follow then thou shall
[23:41] give Life For Life eye for eye tooth for
[23:44] tooth hand for hand foot for foot
[23:45] burning for burning wound for wound
[23:48] stripe for stripe
[23:50] now this this is a point that I remember
[23:53] when
[23:55] I first got saved spending so much time
[23:57] reading Jonathan Edwards and and the
[24:01] logic behind his understanding and he
[24:04] goes into great detail to demonstrate
[24:06] why man deserves Eternal punishment
[24:09] not just Eternal punishment eternal
[24:11] torment
[24:14] because they say well God has is is an
[24:18] infinite God he's infinitely holy you
[24:21] have offended an infinite God so your
[24:23] punishment therefore should be infinite
[24:28] it's an interesting logic but it isn't
[24:30] based on scripture it's based on
[24:32] philosophy I love Jonathan Edwards I'm
[24:34] not here to put anything down on him it
[24:37] was the age that he was living in
[24:40] that that that man's Spirit age and it
[24:43] wasn't these things weren't to be
[24:45] restored then but the point being that
[24:47] I'm trying to bring out as many say that
[24:49] today still say that today and use that
[24:51] same logic today but really does it fit
[24:54] is a crime committed in time worthy of
[24:58] Eternal conscious punishment you've
[25:00] committed a crime yes it's horrible yes
[25:03] it's a bad thing
[25:04] but is God going to punish you for all
[25:07] is that the character of God to punish
[25:09] for all eternity or is it the character
[25:12] of God to reward you according to your
[25:14] works
[25:15] if you're if you're not covered by the
[25:17] blood he's going to judge you and judge
[25:20] you fairly
[25:23] God would be meeting out a punishment
[25:24] that was not in line with his own
[25:27] Divine Justice eye for an eye and a
[25:31] tooth for a tooth and for hand he
[25:32] promised in the beginning death
[25:34] he did not promise to Adam when he came
[25:37] to Adam he didn't say the day you eat of
[25:39] this tree you're going to be punished in
[25:41] hell for all of eternity didn't say that
[25:44] why because there was a place for
[25:45] Redemption right
[25:47] for Adam
[25:49] but the punishment is death
[25:52] and its Ultimate Death
[25:59] Ezekiel 18 4 behold All Souls are mine
[26:02] as the soul of the father so also the
[26:04] soul of the son is mine the soul that
[26:07] sinneth
[26:09] it shall die
[26:12] so again just cut recovering the things
[26:16] we covered on Wednesday and tonight and
[26:19] close our tonight
[26:22] I I did have two coffees but started on
[26:25] my third maybe I needed that this
[26:28] morning
[26:31] immortality is not the default of every
[26:33] human being Now understand we we look at
[26:36] this in the big picture and you say well
[26:37] yeah for some people it is well just a
[26:40] minute just a minute what about the
[26:43] blood of Christ what about God working
[26:45] out his plan in time what we are worthy
[26:47] of is death and punishment for that sin
[26:49] we understand predestination we
[26:51] understand election that's God
[26:54] overriding this whole process we
[26:55] understand even further back than just
[26:58] the election and understand where our
[26:59] life source is but don't get it out of
[27:02] out of cater and think well I just this
[27:04] is what I deserve no
[27:07] you're promised death
[27:11] and you're deserving of the Lake of Fire
[27:15] that's not the default of every human
[27:17] being eternal life is a gift
[27:20] given and revealed through Jesus Christ
[27:22] only
[27:24] don't get it don't get predestination
[27:26] and election and eternal life crossed up
[27:28] in that way
[27:30] I'm not saying you're given eternal life
[27:33] the minute you're saved that's that's
[27:35] it's connected but it's separate
[27:41] hell is described using Darkness fire
[27:43] and destruction perishing death
[27:46] all of that is a picture of annihilation
[27:49] none of that is a picture of
[27:52] Eternal conscious torment
[27:54] people will be tormented but fire
[27:56] destroys completely not partially
[27:59] judgment is eternal fire is eternal but
[28:02] conscious torment is not
[28:06] those who are cast into hell will
[28:08] eventually be annihilated because they
[28:09] don't
[28:10] ultimately possess eternal life
[28:14] and God's judgment upon sin calls for
[28:16] death both physical and spiritual death
[28:20] so we're going to tie the rest of it
[28:23] together we're going to look into the
[28:24] rest of it as we go forward
