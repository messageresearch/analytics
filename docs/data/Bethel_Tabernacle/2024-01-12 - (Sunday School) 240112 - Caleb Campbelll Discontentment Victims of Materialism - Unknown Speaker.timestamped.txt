[6:48] our hearts and minds are just Lord
[6:50] directed towards you this morning we
[6:52] commit it to you in the name of Jesus
[6:54] Christ amen God bless you let's turn
[6:57] into our Bibles into the book of
[7:00] Philippians we're going to go to
[7:02] Philippians and 1 Timothy this
[7:15] morning good to be in the house of the
[7:19] Lord amen Philippians chapter 4 and
[7:22] we're going to catch two verses
[7:25] 11 uh three verses 11 12 and 13 and it
[7:30] says not that I speak of in respect of
[7:34] want for I have learned in whatsoever
[7:37] State I am in therewith to be content I
[7:42] know both how to be abased and I know
[7:44] how to abound everywhere and in all
[7:46] things I am instructed both to be full
[7:49] and to be hungry both to abound and to
[7:51] suffer need amen and then let's turn
[7:54] into our Bibles to 1 Timothy chapter 6
[8:00] and then we're going to catch verses 6
[8:02] through
[8:04] 8 it says but godliness with contentment
[8:09] is great gain for we brought nothing
[8:12] into this world and it is certain that
[8:14] we can carry nothing out and having food
[8:18] having food and rainment let us be
[8:20] therewith content God bless you as you
[8:22] take your seats this morning uh my topic
[8:25] this morning is discontentment and then
[8:28] a little subtitle I have have is uh
[8:30] victims of
[8:32] materialism we're going to get into a
[8:34] few quotes this morning from the church
[8:36] age book um brother de brother brandom
[8:38] deals with the the effects that the
[8:42] spirit of the last day has on the world
[8:45] and the influence that it can have on us
[8:48] as Believers amen we're we're a part of
[8:50] this world we live in this world you
[8:52] know the Bible says that we're you know
[8:54] uh here and you know sometimes we have
[8:56] to be a part of the influence of the
[8:58] world and sometimes
[9:00] being a part of the world you know we're
[9:02] supposed to be separate but we're still
[9:03] under the influence of the age that
[9:05] we're living in and he uses this phrase
[9:09] that grabbed my attention when I was
[9:10] studying for this brother bom says he
[9:12] calls it he says that man is a victim of
[9:17] materialism and he says so the
[9:19] definition of materialism is a tendency
[9:21] to consider material possessions and
[9:25] physical comfort as more important than
[9:27] spiritual values so you know we live in
[9:30] a society at least you know here in
[9:32] America where material possessions can
[9:35] be seen as a source of happiness and you
[9:38] know even as Believers I believe we can
[9:40] fall victim to the effects of that
[9:43] Spirit if we're not careful um the
[9:45] second chapter of the church age book
[9:47] you know in the patmas vision brother
[9:49] bandom deals with the importance of
[9:51] being in the spirit and he quotes out of
[9:54] the book of re Revelation where John
[9:56] says that he was in the spirit on the
[10:00] Lord's day and heard behind him a great
[10:03] voice as of a trumpet Revelation 1 ver
[10:05] 20 and brother Brenham says on that if
[10:08] there's anything good that will come to
[10:10] me it has to be revealed by the spirit
[10:15] confirmed by the word and made manifest
[10:19] by the results it Bears amen so some of
[10:23] the most incredible Revelations uh are
[10:27] written in that final book of the Bible
[10:29] by someone who was what he was in the
[10:32] spirit of the Lord and I want to focus
[10:35] on this this morning is what the devil
[10:37] does is he tries to keep Believers out
[10:40] of the spirit amen and I believe a big
[10:43] portion of it is associated with this
[10:45] topic this morning the spirit of
[10:47] materialism and I want to go through
[10:49] through some quotes and make some
[10:50] comments here on the church age book as
[10:52] we go brother Venom says in the sman
[10:54] church age um he says here is what you
[10:57] have to believe again in the love and
[10:58] the goodness and the wisdom of God he
[11:01] says this too is needful remember he
[11:04] admonished the scripture take no thought
[11:06] for tomorrow what you shall eat or what
[11:09] you shall put on your father knoweth the
[11:12] things you have need of he who clothes
[11:15] the Lily and feeds the sparrow shall do
[11:18] much more for you and he says these
[11:21] physical things are not the true basic
[11:24] necessities of your life for a man's
[11:27] life consisteth not not of the things he
[11:30] possesses but rather seek ye first the
[11:33] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[11:36] all the material possessions he brother
[11:38] bom says will be added unto you the
[11:39] people of God he says are not materially
[11:43] minded they are christm minded I want to
[11:47] be christm minded this morning they do
[11:49] not seek the treasures that are below
[11:52] they seek those above so he says a man's
[11:55] life consisteth not of the things he
[11:57] possesses and I love how he put that the
[11:59] people people of God were not supposed
[12:01] to be materially minded they're supposed
[12:04] to be christm minded and that's what it
[12:07] takes to overcome a spirit of
[12:10] discontentment to be christm minded and
[12:13] that is I had I had a a thought this was
[12:16] several months ago and about something
[12:19] in our Christian walk and it our
[12:21] Christian walk is an active process to
[12:24] be christm minded is an active process
[12:27] that we have to take part in it's not
[12:30] you just go to church and you read your
[12:31] Bible those are part of that active
[12:33] process but you have to pursue God you
[12:36] have to pursue these things in the word
[12:38] you have to pursue being christm minded
[12:41] otherwise the influence of this day will
[12:44] overtake you amen we have to we have to
[12:48] allow Christ to be at the center of
[12:50] every thought in every motive and in
[12:52] every objective in our life so
[12:55] contentment this morning is part of our
[12:57] main main subject is the state you know
[13:00] in definition a definition is the state
[13:02] of being satisfied and not Desiring more
[13:06] than what we already have I want to read
[13:09] that again being it is a state of being
[13:12] satisfied and not Desiring more than
[13:15] what we already have such a vital part
[13:18] of our Christian walk can lay in such a
[13:21] simple comment of what Paul said content
[13:25] in whatever state that I am in because I
[13:28] believe that we all can fall into this
[13:30] pattern of Desiring more materially
[13:34] Desiring these things but God says and
[13:37] through through Paul in here he says you
[13:39] have to learn to be content learning is
[13:43] an active process that we're constantly
[13:45] striving for amen I read this devotional
[13:49] the other day I shared it with a with a
[13:50] few Brothers uh and I thought it was
[13:52] worth sharing today from this excerp it
[13:55] says in the newspaper I read about a
[13:57] prominent Builder of upscale homes who
[14:00] said that one of his keys to success is
[14:04] always having a fabulously decorated
[14:07] model home to show his customers he says
[14:10] that he wants them to walk away feeling
[14:13] terribly disatisfied with what they
[14:17] already have those feelings of
[14:21] dissatisfaction come straight from the
[14:23] enemy he says when Satan came to Eve in
[14:26] the Garden of Eden and I thought this
[14:28] was an incredible point he when he came
[14:30] to even the Garden of Eden he did not
[14:32] remind her of all the wonderful things
[14:34] God provided he didn't remind her that
[14:36] he would come down in the cool of the
[14:37] evening he didn't remind her that that
[14:40] everything she had need of was right
[14:41] there he brought up the one thing he had
[14:45] her focus on the one restriction in her
[14:47] life and that is what Satan does in our
[14:49] lives he'll get us to focus on the one
[14:52] thing that you don't have materially
[14:54] speaking he'll get us to focus on
[14:55] everything except being christm minded
[14:59] and the typical Behavior this is typical
[15:01] behavior of of Satan's Behavior he says
[15:03] in this um in this devotion he focuses
[15:07] on the things that we don't have instead
[15:09] of reminding us of all God has given us
[15:13] to enjoy and I I believe there's just
[15:15] such a simple lesson in that there's
[15:17] always something that appears nicer than
[15:19] what you have it doesn't matter what you
[15:21] have you know there is always going to
[15:24] be something that either is nicer or
[15:26] that appears nicer and our eyes because
[15:29] of the society that we live in can be
[15:31] drawn to those things amen and if you've
[15:35] got just if you got the latest and the
[15:38] greatest right now just wait a few
[15:40] months or wait a year you're there's
[15:42] going to be something greater if you've
[15:43] got the latest technology you I'm in the
[15:45] Hearing Care industry and every year
[15:48] there comes out with this groundbreaking
[15:50] technology where you're going to you're
[15:52] going to hear better than you've ever
[15:54] heard and there's there's there's new
[15:55] angles to this and there's this greater
[15:58] and and a lot of times it is it is
[16:00] greater but you just wait a few more
[16:01] months and then it's going to be
[16:02] something greater that's the age that
[16:04] we're living in you know and um that
[16:08] devotion was speaking of Eve and and how
[16:11] the serpent came to her and of course in
[16:14] your life the enemy is always going to
[16:17] try to keep you focusing on what you may
[16:20] not have or something that somebody else
[16:23] has or all of these material things and
[16:25] I I think what he often does because he
[16:28] knows he can't get us the way that he
[16:30] got Eve he can't get us to disbelieve
[16:33] God's word he'll tempt us with desires
[16:36] of the flesh that will completely
[16:38] distract us from being christm minded
[16:42] and living in the place that we're
[16:43] supposed to be living in amen we're
[16:45] supposed to be living in Victorious
[16:46] lives we're supposed to be we're
[16:48] supposed to be striving but if you're
[16:50] focused on something that is material if
[16:53] you're focused on on these worldly
[16:54] possessions then you you Cann all you
[16:57] you can't serve God in mmon you can't
[16:59] serve two at the same time you know and
[17:04] and cars and houses and and clothes and
[17:07] money and this and that I'm not I'm not
[17:09] speaking against those things you know
[17:11] we live in the world you know we're we
[17:13] have to have those things and material
[17:15] possessions they're a blessing from the
[17:18] Lord amen and I believe we ought to be
[17:20] thankful for the blessings that God has
[17:22] given us and I'm not even saying you
[17:24] know that every desire that you have for
[17:27] nicer things is altogether wrong but
[17:29] where does it fall on your priority list
[17:32] amen I want to say that again where does
[17:34] it fall on your priority list am man is
[17:37] it causing you to always strive for
[17:39] something bigger and something better
[17:41] and the the next nicest thing and the
[17:43] nicest the newest you know the desire
[17:47] you have I is it causing you to be
[17:50] dissatisfied with what God has blessed
[17:53] you with right now I know that's
[17:56] something is some real simple but you
[17:58] know one of the biggest one of the
[18:00] biggest downfalls that can happen when
[18:02] you fall into this this lack of
[18:05] contentment in your life by always
[18:08] striving for that next thing the nice
[18:10] car the the the the better paying
[18:12] position or this and that is that you're
[18:15] missing out on one of the biggest
[18:18] blessings that God can give us and that
[18:21] is just simply enjoying the present
[18:25] enjoying the moment that God has given
[18:27] that's why he says he he brother random
[18:29] picks that in that in the church age
[18:31] book he picks that quote up take no
[18:32] thought for tomorrow God knows God knew
[18:35] he created everything right so he knew
[18:38] that we were going to have this
[18:41] inundation of all of this stuff so he
[18:44] says don't think about that I'm going to
[18:46] take care of that I am your provider I
[18:48] am Jehovah Gyra think about the here and
[18:50] now I've blessed you with a family I've
[18:52] blessed you with a job I've blessed you
[18:54] with these things be thankful in the
[18:56] moment that you have right now and a
[18:59] lack of contentment will take away those
[19:01] things it'll take away your ability to
[19:05] just live A Satisfied life in Christ I
[19:07] want to live a satisfied life in Christ
[19:09] I want to be content in everything that
[19:11] he's given me and and I know we all fall
[19:14] I've fallen victim to this we all fall
[19:15] victim to this because brother Benham
[19:17] says that man is victim to a spirit of
[19:21] materialism and we can be influenced by
[19:23] that but what are we going to do with it
[19:25] amen what are we when the Lord uh
[19:27] discerns that in our our hearts what are
[19:29] you going to do with it
[19:31] amen
[19:35] um he said I you can have a desire for
[19:39] something nicer but check whether or not
[19:41] is causing you disa dissatisfaction what
[19:44] you currently have uh a few Sunday
[19:46] schools ago uh I did a little a little
[19:48] series on on perspective and angles and
[19:51] we talked on a few
[19:52] lessons and and I believe if we start to
[19:56] fall into a trap of being being
[19:58] dissatisfied with what we have or you
[20:01] know always thinking of your wants and
[20:03] even your needs just simply you know
[20:06] just simple some of the simple stuff
[20:08] that we have to do just take a moment
[20:10] and start listing out the things that
[20:12] God has given you start being thankful
[20:14] for for for what he has just start
[20:16] making a list because the list can go on
[20:19] and on and on and on Amen and I believe
[20:21] that if you just start thanking him for
[20:23] what you do have you can gain A Renewed
[20:26] perspective amen A New Perspective on
[20:29] what it is that you're you're going
[20:30] through what what he's blessed you with
[20:33] amen all these things just some
[20:34] scriptures to go with that this morning
[20:36] first Thessalonians 5 Rejoice always
[20:39] pray without ceasing give thanks in all
[20:42] circumstances for this is the will of
[20:44] God in Christ Jesus for you amen Psalms
[20:47] 952 let us come into His presence with
[20:50] Thanksgiving let us Make a Joyful Noise
[20:52] to him with songs of
[20:54] praise brother Benham says further on in
[20:57] the same quote in that church AG book he
[20:59] says it is absolutely true the majority
[21:02] of Christians are not wealthy rather
[21:04] they are on the Poor Side it was so in
[21:07] Jesus's day it was true in Paul's day
[21:09] and it it it should be true today oh it
[21:11] is not too true today for the Leo Dean
[21:14] age is one of vast wealth where often
[21:17] the criteria of spirituality is an
[21:20] abundance of Earthly Goods my how rich
[21:23] the church is in Goods but how poor in
[21:27] spirit bless blessed are blessed be you
[21:30] poor for yours is the kingdom of God he
[21:32] says the kingdom of God is Not meat and
[21:34] drink it is not
[21:35] Material it is within us a rich man is
[21:39] rich in God not in worldly things amen
[21:43] and he says a little bit further down he
[21:45] says now this is nothing against rich
[21:47] people because God can save a rich man
[21:49] some of go some of God's children are
[21:51] rich but money can be such a snare and I
[21:55] wanted to focus on this point that he
[21:57] makes because it's important he says
[21:59] money can be such a snare not only to
[22:01] those who have it but also to those who
[22:04] don't have it amen I want to say that
[22:07] again it can be a snare whether you have
[22:10] money or you don't have money because if
[22:13] even if you don't you can find yourself
[22:16] always thinking about it thinking about
[22:18] wanting it thinking about wanting that
[22:20] nice thing thinking about wanting and so
[22:22] then you're you fall into the same
[22:24] category because now you're in your mind
[22:27] you are serving Mammon amen right way
[22:30] back there in the first uh the first age
[22:32] brother bam this is finishing that quote
[22:34] he says James cried out to those who
[22:36] were putting stock in wealthy people
[22:38] have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus
[22:40] Christ with respect of persons he's
[22:42] quoting James the poor that were trying
[22:43] to butter up the rich in order to get
[22:45] help rather than trusting in God don't
[22:48] do it says James don't do it money is in
[22:51] everything money isn't the answer and
[22:53] today it is not the answer either we
[22:56] have more wealth than we have ever had
[22:58] and yet less is being accomplished
[23:01] spiritually it is not with money that
[23:04] God works he moves by his spirit and
[23:07] that moving of the spirit comes only to
[23:09] a consecrated life in the word amen
[23:13] that's what I want that's my desire I I
[23:15] want a moving of the spirit in my life I
[23:17] want a life more consecrated to the word
[23:21] I think this is the last part of the
[23:22] quote I want to this really powerful
[23:24] part here he says I want to give a
[23:25] warning right here it says concerning
[23:27] the last days that that because of
[23:29] abounding iniquity the love of many will
[23:32] wax cold and the leodan or last age of
[23:35] self-love and love for material things
[23:38] will take the place of the true love of
[23:42] God we need to guard against the power
[23:45] of sin in these days so many are getting
[23:49] so hard because they haven't realized
[23:52] now notice this they haven't realized
[23:54] the effect of this last day Spirit it is
[23:58] time to draw nigh to God and let him
[23:59] fill him fill our lives with his love or
[24:02] we will F feel the coldness of the last
[24:05] day church and reject the truth of God
[24:07] which alone is able to help us he's
[24:10] saying that we need to guard
[24:13] ourselves against the power of sin and
[24:15] realize just how strong the effect of
[24:19] that last spirit that last day spirit is
[24:21] and recognize that even even as Born
[24:24] Again Believers amen we can be
[24:27] influenced by by that spirit because we
[24:29] live in this world Amen so that is why a
[24:33] consecrated life to Christ is so
[24:35] important amen so that that Spirit the
[24:39] right Spirit can influence us amen we're
[24:41] supposed to get brother John John got in
[24:44] the spirit of the Lord and then it was
[24:46] when those Revelations came when you get
[24:48] in the spirit of the Lord every
[24:49] everybody who's been a Christian longer
[24:51] than an hour knows that when you get in
[24:52] the presence of the Lord that is where
[24:54] you want to stay amen you want to stay
[24:56] in that place forever because you know
[24:58] that your troubles fall away all all the
[25:01] this this this sin in your life and all
[25:03] all of the sickness everything just it
[25:05] doesn't matter because you're in the
[25:07] presence of God Amen but if you if
[25:10] you're constantly inundated with things
[25:13] and material and all of this then you're
[25:16] never able to enter into that
[25:18] atmosphere um just uh for background I
[25:21] wanted to read uh Revelation 3: 14-1 17
[25:26] and un the angel of the Church of the
[25:28] leod Deans write these things saith the
[25:30] amen the fearful the faithful and true
[25:33] witness the beginning of the creation of
[25:36] God I Know Thy works that thou art
[25:37] neither cold nor hot I would th work
[25:40] cold or hot so then because Thou Art
[25:42] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[25:44] SPO thee out of my mouth because thou
[25:46] sayest I am rich and increased with
[25:49] goods and have need of nothing and
[25:51] knowest not that thou are wretched
[25:53] miserable poor blind and naked in this
[25:57] last day he said it would cause people
[26:00] to have such a love for those things
[26:03] that it would take the place brother ROM
[26:05] said it would take the place of the love
[26:07] of God for them in their hearts and and
[26:09] he's brother benam is urgently he's
[26:11] warning us saying that there will be an
[26:14] effect there is an effect we're living
[26:16] in probably the we are in the worst part
[26:19] of that we're we're in the the final
[26:21] moment so the effect of that spirit is
[26:24] stronger now than it ever has been and I
[26:26] I believe now more than ever
[26:28] if we don't keep our guard up then we
[26:31] can be influenced by that spirit and
[26:34] allow it to cause serious handicap
[26:37] spiritual handicap in our lives you know
[26:40] when when when you allow that stuff to
[26:43] happen you become spiritually uh
[26:46] disabled to do the things that God wants
[26:48] us to do to live in the spirit to to to
[26:51] to walk in in the ways of the Lord amen
[26:54] and there was another devotional that
[26:55] that I was quoting earlier um this is
[26:58] the the latter part of that it said most
[27:00] people are driven by discontent and
[27:05] unaware of that fact but if we really if
[27:09] we analyzed our motives we would realize
[27:12] that they generally come from a focus on
[27:15] whatever is missing in our lives the
[27:18] void we want to fill the problems we
[27:20] want to fix the glass that is half empty
[27:23] and we rarely recognize the things that
[27:26] are going well in our lives or make
[27:28] strides to do so no we aim for the
[27:33] unfinished items on a NeverEnding to-do
[27:37] list of trying to make our lives
[27:40] complete in the process we keep our
[27:43] gifts and successes in the back of our
[27:46] minds and miss out on the Gratitude and
[27:51] the
[27:52] satisfaction we could have that struck
[27:55] me when I read it because it points out
[27:56] something that we all do sometimes
[27:58] without even fully realizing it we have
[28:00] this in our in in everybody's Minds we
[28:02] have this constant this to-do list and
[28:05] it's a NeverEnding to-do list to try to
[28:07] make your life complete but your life is
[28:10] already complete in Christ amen and
[28:12] we're supposed to be living in a state
[28:14] of content therefore with whatever you
[28:17] have
[28:18] amen um and that's just it that that
[28:22] whole point of never being content it's
[28:24] the opposite of what Jesus taught us the
[28:26] word uh just have have a few minutes
[28:28] here left the word covet covetousness is
[28:32] basically encompassing that whole idea
[28:34] covetousness is having a Perpetual
[28:36] desire for what we don't have and what
[28:39] it leads to is discontentment because
[28:43] it's causing a person to live in a
[28:45] constant
[28:47] dissatisfaction of what they currently
[28:49] have or what state that they're
[28:51] currently in and I don't know about you
[28:54] saints of God but I I don't want to live
[28:56] in that place amen I want I I I I want
[28:59] to stand you know up here knowing that
[29:01] you know I do stand up here knowing that
[29:03] I have been influenced by this and I
[29:05] believe we all have If we're honest with
[29:06] ourselves but I don't want to stay in
[29:08] that place and when I get into a place
[29:11] like that because I think we live in a
[29:13] place where where're everywhere we look
[29:16] we're inundated with that we're
[29:18] everything is about what you have and
[29:20] where you're going in life and you know
[29:22] I had this this uh patient come in and
[29:25] he's you know he's toward the end of his
[29:26] life he's in his 90s and he was talking
[29:29] about how all the things that he has he
[29:30] has accomplished in his life and he was
[29:32] a surgeon and you know he basically said
[29:34] that you know what you do in life you
[29:37] know working wise basically is what
[29:40] caused him to be what he was you know if
[29:42] if he didn't do that then he would have
[29:44] he would have nothing and so his purpose
[29:46] was in that it was in something that he
[29:48] did rather than in what Christ did and I
[29:50] just thought how empty that is how empty
[29:52] of a life that is and and it's and it is
[29:54] important what you do you're supposed to
[29:56] enjoy what you're doing I'm glad I'm
[29:57] thankful that I do enjoy what I do but
[29:59] that isn't where my my purpose lies my
[30:02] purpose lies in Christ
[30:04] amen now I love how uh simple brother
[30:07] bam makes always makes things you know
[30:09] the answer he gives is a scripture where
[30:11] he quotes James chapter 4 you know it's
[30:14] is it it's time to draw nigh to God and
[30:17] let him fill us with his with his love
[30:19] amen what's the answer Caleb what's the
[30:21] answer draw nigh to God and He will draw
[30:24] nigh to you that's a Biblical promise
[30:26] amen Ecclesiastes 5:10 says he that
[30:29] loveth silver shall not be satisfied
[30:32] with silver nor he that loveth abundance
[30:34] with increase this is also vanity and
[30:37] the Amplified reads it like this he says
[30:39] he who loves money will not be satisfied
[30:41] with money nor he who loves abundance
[30:43] with his gain this too is Vanity and
[30:48] Solomon writes that from a place of
[30:50] experience amen he he was a man who one
[30:54] of the wealthiest men in the world had
[30:56] all the wisdom you know outside brother
[30:58] that outside of Christ was the wisest
[30:59] man ever to walk the earth in riches and
[31:01] in wisdom and he came to the
[31:03] understanding that if you place your
[31:05] satisfaction in money or things or
[31:08] people you will never be satisfied amen
[31:11] amen a few a few verses later in the
[31:15] same um book Ecclesiastes 5:19 if you
[31:18] want to bring it up every man also to
[31:20] whom God hath given riches and wealth
[31:22] and hath given power to eat thereof and
[31:24] to take his portion and to rejoice in
[31:27] his labor this is the gift of God for he
[31:30] shall not much remember the days of his
[31:32] life because God anth him in the joy of
[31:35] his heart and I wanted to read that from
[31:36] the NLT as well because I I like the way
[31:39] that words it and it is a good thing to
[31:41] receive wealth from God and the good
[31:44] health to enjoy it to enjoy your work
[31:46] and accept your lot in life this is
[31:48] indeed a gift from God God keeps such
[31:51] people so busy enjoying life that they
[31:53] take no time to brood over the past so
[31:57] anything that you do possess it truly is
[32:00] a gift from God Amen and having a
[32:02] Content attitude is something that
[32:06] allows us to enjoy the benefits of what
[32:08] God has given us amen and and the Bible
[32:11] you know here says that those things can
[32:14] be a tremendous blessing but what's your
[32:16] attitude towards it amen Proverbs 15
[32:20] just a few closing comments Proverbs
[32:22] 15:16 says better is little with the
[32:24] fear of the Lord than great treasure and
[32:27] trouble therewith
[32:28] amen Psalms 107: 8-9 says oh that men
[32:32] would praise the Lord for his goodness
[32:34] and for his wonderful Works to the
[32:36] children of men for he satisfieth the
[32:39] longing soul and filth the hungry soul
[32:43] with goodness amen that's the kind of
[32:45] satisfaction that I want in my life amen
[32:47] my uh my daughter got this really cool
[32:50] toy from my mom this Christmas it plays
[32:51] little Bible songs and has little
[32:53] prayers on it and stuff it's just this
[32:55] little thing you can carry around and
[32:56] one of the prayers said says thank you
[32:59] Lord for not keeping tabs and I'm just
[33:03] so glad that he doesn't keep tabs in our
[33:05] life amen I I've failed so many times in
[33:07] this category and I believe if we're
[33:09] honest with oursel all of us have but he
[33:12] he doesn't keep tabs and he doesn't
[33:16] write me off for those things he doesn't
[33:19] tally your failures amen what he does is
[33:21] he sends conviction amen and to get us
[33:24] back on track amen glory to God let's
[33:27] pray
[33:29] Heavenly Heavenly Father we thank you
[33:31] for this day we love you Lord I just
[33:33] pray over the Lord the remainder of
[33:35] service I pray that you could just
[33:37] father fill this place with a spirit of
[33:38] worship father we love you and we just
[33:41] commit these things to you in Jesus name
[33:43] amen amen
