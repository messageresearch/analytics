quick announcements before we turn to uh Saint John 1 1. and you can find your place there I just want to uh got a number of prayer requests and and a really really amazing testimony that came in we'll get to that just in a little bit I want to just by way of reminder remind you that this Friday we'll be having a special youth Gathering amen and some different Believers from the Spanish church and brother Blues assembly and brother Maurice will be here amen and we're going to have a nice time in here and then we'll have a little bit of Fellowship out in the fellowship hall we've got a nice project hope you young people have completed your homework amen praise the Lord we'll have a nice discussion on some material that I sent to him amen and then reminder to the brothers the next morning Saturday morning at nine we'll have our our Bible study breakfast Amen brother Maurice is going to actually stay over for that for the blues some different brothers from that assembly brother Samuel and some different brothers from there be joining us so we're looking forward to that amen and um just wanted to make those quick announcements all right praise the Lord we're going to look right here this more this evening in John Chapter One I Want by the help of the Lord to continue with building or sorry rebuilding Eden amen I hope you enjoyed Sunday my goodness I enjoyed it wow I enjoyed delivering that and so I was able to figure out what I think I can get to tonight we'll the Lord willing unless the Rapture comes we will be trying to go into part three on Sunday but I I have this very one wonderful part here that's really close to my heart it really dealt with me as I was ministering it amen so I should be able to get through it got all my crying out today so I shouldn't be able just to preach amen praise the Lord Saint John chapter one just like we did last time on last Sunday we just won a single verse last Sunday remember we read Genesis one and two and we're going to take today John 1 and 1. in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God that is a beautiful passage in the Bible amen let's pray father we thank you for this Gathering of saints tonight Lord we thank you for all of the singing and the specials Lord and just shortly Lord just a little thought on my heart tonight to bridge uh the two Sunday Services Lord and I I pray for your blessing now upon speaker and upon hearer Lord we continue to remember our numerous families that are traveling away may you be with them Father keep them safe join them back to us at your appointed hour amen we commit ourselves into your hands for this word tonight now Lord we committed all to you in Jesus name amen God bless friends you can be seated I was um today went actually went in two days early my follow-up appointment to have my eye looked at it again was actually Friday but when I got up this morning it seemed rather worse and so I went and the report was mixed certain parts of it have improved other parts of it have worsened and she said it's just like that that shingles in the eye is extremely hard to treat hard to get rid of completely and it's hard to treat because that that in one way the thing they used to go after the virus is a totally different thing than what they do to go after what the virus does to your eye the pressure and the swelling and the irritation and so in treating one it helps the other and if they don't do that then the other one has a problem and so she said it's a real balancing act so um amen she dilated my eye I was in quite a bit of discomfort so while that discomfort has gone these lights here are really tough tough so amen praise the Lord if I'm looking away constantly you'll know what it is I'm not worried about it the devil's still a liar straight up that's it he's a liar nothing more to say he's a liar man amen so he he don't run nothing but his mouth anyway so amen he certainly don't run God's kingdom he don't run God's family he don't run me amen praise the Lord and so I want then to carry on tonight if you'll remember just to recap the very last point we were making Sunday so that I can try to make the bridge here for this coming Sunday but we finished up where we were showing you how that it was the devil's Unholy spirit that had caused the church to go into error but brother Branham was showing us that now he starts coming back now to seed time uh from Eden and here it is again so brother Branham was showing us that that God is restoring Eden condition now that's a beautiful thought friends because it's not just that he's rebuilding the Earth he's rebuilding this Earth Amen brother Branham showed us in oh my and who is this Melchizedek and future home in Harvest Time numerous messages how that he redeems his family the exact same way he redeems the Earth brother M teaches that constantly especially late in his ministry uses those three same justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit and so he talks about you know it was the the god the Earth God it's water baptism in the time of Noah and it got the blood put on it in the days of Jesus at Calvary and then it's going to get a Holy Ghost Fire I'm glad for that and he said that's the same way you come through the water through the blood and then the fire and you've got to have a holy ghost baptism because here here's his situation you know you're you're going to want to be native to that new world you're not going to want to feel like a foreigner I'm tired of feeling like a foreigner I want to feel home Hallelujah I want to feel like this is the what the world is supposed to be brother Branham said this is a neurotic age and he makes an interesting statement how he says that seemingly we are we live in a world and brother Branham says it in the church age book that we seem unfitted for I think every believer relates to that and say man what a way to say it I that's exactly that hits the nail on the head I I'm living here but I I feel unfitted the world wasn't supposed to be a neurotic the world wasn't supposed to be full of sin my what it was supposed to be full of disease and full of devils and and the lid is torn from hell and we realize brother Brandon said demon powers are streaming they're in the atmospheres said they're they're constantly in the atmospheres to accuse the Brethren see so we realize that that the opening of the seventh seal finds that Satan has lost his position in heaven to accuse the brothers you can put that title slide up brother that'll be just fine that that he lost his his ability to accuse us Before the Throne of God you don't see him in Revelation 5. you see everybody else you see John representing the bride you see the strong Angel representing the messenger of the age you see the one seated on the throne you see the Four and Twenty Elders you get the sea of glass the Angels the four living creatures the seven spirits of God but one thing that's missing is the accuser Hallelujah because well that day on Calvary put his ability to accuse you to God at it's done it's finished God will not hear it brother Brandon said God can't see your mistakes he only sees your representation he sees Christ but we realize that brother Branham said that since the lid was torn from hell you know coming right around the turn of the 20th century just preceding the woes uh star fell from heaven given the keys to the bottomless pit unlisted and that was so that sin could come to the surface hell could come to the service and brother Branham because the woes would have to start in right there to sweep man from the earth I'm not trying to get on that tonight I'm just trying to give you the background but we realized that now demon powers you know they're they're streaming and brother Benham said they're through the heavens and atmospheres uh to accuse the Brethren see they can't get in the I thought I thought about this they can't get in the courtroom but they can stand outside and demonstrate and then carry signs and shout and scream and run them down but the judges are hearing the case Hallelujah so so we realized then that you know finally the bride goes up Satan comes down that's it and then woe into the Earth woe unto you for Satan has come down and he has but a little time he's very angry and the world is going to plunge into a tribulation period now this so brother Brandon is saying that God has what is he doing he had a threefold plan first to make himself fully revealed in Christ and then to in the New Testament era through the baptism of the Holy Ghost that he would gain preeminence he would regain preeminence what he lost when Adam fell and he would regain preeminence over the church his bride and then the last thing would be is that he would restore the kingdom now that's me and you back to its rightly position he's rebuilding Eden he's rebuilding in Eden in Eden before the fall Adam had no sin I'm headed back to no sin Adam had no weakness I'm headed back to no weakness the Earth had no diseases the Earth is headed back to no diseases Hallelujah there weren't political Powers there wasn't civilization there was not a satanic Eden it was a Christ Eden and we're headed back to that and so the prophet says he sent us this message to do what to bring that Eden back to take us out of this chaos and that's where we we're we're wrapping up on on Sunday and so we we found out that you remember the promise that it doesn't matter what Satan does to me I know as job knew that in my flesh I self shall see him and and I and I was I ended on that point to say because you're like me there's times where we say man I maybe I don't know how I guess I he can get brother so and so restored and get sister so and so restored but boy how's he going to get this old boy restored but how's he gonna do it God moved upon the face of the waters what has happened the message has moved across you and it's speaking to the chaos you just believe that friends I don't don't give the devil any Credence I don't care how many successes or failures you might have had this week don't give the devil any Credence God has got everything in perfect control and perfect timing in Perfect Harmony and as I've said to you so many times he's doing more in you than you're aware of he's moving in the earth more than the world thinks he is [Music] they see him as an impersonal being uninterested in the Affairs of of life that's simply not true in fact is nothing really could be further from the truth than that he's intimately involved he's controlling all the situation so brother Branham comes now so here we come to the word becoming flesh in the beginning what's the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now tonight I hope to on my bridge change the subtitle as you're going to see here this is where we were Sunday hope and Assurance in perilous times now for my bridge sermon to connect last Sunday to this coming Sunday I want to change it to a tree to be desired all right so now we find that brother Branham speaks of this great Fountain I'm gonna I've got a number of quotes that I put up here on purpose and then I've got some quotes that I didn't put up here on purpose because I just want to change into a different uh gear as it were and try to pull you in as we as I get to the Finish Line tonight so so we'll read it first we'll catch the ones that I've posted but brother Branham talks about that that great fountain in eternity from which flowed all good things and how that God that great Fountain of seven colored Fountain and it was love and it was peace and it was Harmony and and he and he talks about I don't want to I don't want to get ahead of the quote you'll read it for you you read it with me as we go but how that all good things flowed down from that and that God this great spirit that filled all time space and Eternity now we're going back further than Genesis 1. last weekend we were at Genesis one two so now that I'm going further into my thought we got to go further back all right so in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God back in that eternity where he said that great God he desired he desired to share his existence with other people he desired to share his eternal life with Humanity oh my friends and the world takes such a such a Cavalier nonchalant attitude toward God they it's almost like God show me what you can offer and I'll think about it and get back to you my goodness here's the God of all universe who who spawned everything that there is and this great being when you're nothing but a little pepper Speck on a little dot of a planet amidst amidst billions of galaxies and God is coming that God is coming offer himself to you what's there to think about see he desired to share his existence brother Brandon picks it up here in life 1957. he says and how that in the world we know that there is a I love this contrast now watch this there is a real true Spirit of Love there is a real true Spirit of loyalty there is a real true Spirit of honesty how many knows that we know it we see it well that is God the very Fountain so I know that the world is dishonest but there's a real honesty I know the world is not loyal but there is a loyal I know the world is full of of what they call love but there is a real true Spirit of love let's get let's let's Close Our Eyes now don't you do that he won't be able to read let's close our eyes to our imaginations Okay do that in other words he's saying he wants you to use your imagination for just a few moments and go way back into the for there was anything I love that I love that Kentucky way of saying it let's go back too far there was anything that the great Fountain of all eternity was that Spirit of love joy that Spirit of honesty that spirit of trueness in this Perfection and then out of the existence of the father with the logos he's talking about the pillar of fire which was the son which was a theophany which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth in a Celestial body now see so brother Brennan explains it two ways before he did that before he did that then he was brother Bradham says he's he was he's like the wind he was just that great spirit now he's not exactly like the wind but that's the closest analogy of human language brother Branham could put it in human terms see and he said he's like the wind but now once that once this happens then brother Brandon would later say now he's not like the wind he's a being he lives in a house because why he doesn't go backwards he went forwards in expression now he's a Son of God not a an alternate separate God he's that great spirit condensed into that Pillar of Fire that now moves and in that form that's what he created everything in that's the form that spoke the world into existence that's why our text says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word and it was God and then later on it shows how that the word became flesh and dwelt among us all right so he says and then out of the existence of the father when the logos which was the son which was theophany which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth in a Celestial body that's the logos the word spoke out of them great Fountains of life and went forth and there was the theophany which was God made into word then that theophany was made flesh and the person of Christ Jesus and then all the fullness of the trinity dwelt in him both Father Son and Holy Spirit all in that isn't that a beautiful way I love how a prophet can just make that so clear watch resurrection of Lazarus now let's just picture that as a as a being a white Halo coming out of that out of that space that was the Son of God the logos and there it was in space moving around like a little child playing before the door of its parent and he drawed in his mind what should be so now you know it's almost like a language that it's like a little child so it is separate from God brother Branham is only using human language so that you can understand there was a before this then there was a this then there was an after this see so the the the analogy what happened to my screen okay uh come come on down okay let me let me see if I can take it from there okay yeah we're back out all right so he says that was the son of God all right um white Halo that the Son of God the logo I said there it was in space moving around like a little child playing before the door of its parent and he and he drawed in his mind you ever seen a kid do that a kid will sit down and draw and a lot of times there it might not be what they'll be able to do later but it they're just getting started and so so now Prophet is using this human analogy so that you can understand he he was drawing his ideas he was drawing you he was drawing me he was drunk he was all alone in this great expense but he didn't want to be alone brother Ben called him and it took a prophet to say it the lonely God see so he says and I can hear I can hear him look around and say there was nothing nowhere no just vastness of space the father covered all the space and then this God become vitalized that's a neat word by the lies down to the logos that made those doctors of divinity lose their false teeth down to the logos he became bottleized down to the logos I can hear him say let there be light and an atom bursted see so we find then that that when we talk about the Big Bang there's a big bang just like there's a Evolution it's just science muddles muddies the water and gets it wrong but there was an evolution and there was a big bang an Adam God spoke and an atom bursted see Yonder and the son come into existence did he she began to whirl millions of years rolled by you with me we lost it again amen never had that happen all right millions of years rolled by and after a while a piece flew off of it a star and he stood out there and watched it and it went all down he stopped it over here after it fell a few million years phew off when another one he let it fall near a certain place and he stopped it what's he doing brother Adam says in one place he's building he's writing his first Bible remember he started drawing and now he's writing his first Bible here he says he's got in his mind now that someday there will be an earth there will be mankind on Earth this is when there was nothing oh my see all right so then he comes now now he's going to come we're gonna we're gonna make a a giant leap to where you've got the Earth and as we were saying last Sunday it was Darkness covered the face of the deep and chaos and God spoke and said let there be light let the water separate from the land let the dry land appear and brother Branham and and God goes through the days of creation uh bringing until he gets all the way up to he starts evoluting with the lower with the lower uh you know mineral Kingdom and then he evolutes up to a Botanical Kingdom and then he evolutes up to a a an animal kingdom and then he evolutes the animal kingdom all the way up till he finally brother Branham said he finally got a masterpiece a being in his own image a man in his own image and this was God's perfect Masterpiece now brother Brandon would show because you he that even has to be qualified because he was a masterpiece in the sense that he reached the highest evolution see that's where brother Branham said Evolution there is an evolution it doesn't change species but God kept evoluting all the way up you know a tadpole didn't turn into a horse which turned into a gorilla which turned into me insulting to think that that's insulting to God insulting to me as a human being made in the image of God and so so we realized that that that no animals there's nowhere in the animal kingdom that animals worship or prey only humans do that see because they were building the image of God and so we come but then we but then when you realize that while Adam and his creation form was God's perfect Masterpiece but yet was actually more complete after the fall than before because you say my he was at a lower stated truth that's all true in his in his in his uh physical form he was in a lower state but now he understands what a redeemer is now he understands what a Healer is he never had that understanding before he never had a concept of being sick or being separated always peace forever every day and now he can he can see a bloody skin that those bloody skins for a message see Abel caught the revelation of that message all right now so brother Branham comes to Adam now watch we're going to pick up the seam with Adam and Eve he's already put him to sleep he's already brought Eve out and brother Branham comes in the Masterpiece and he says it like this now first he had a masterpiece of himself but now he's seen that the Masterpiece was lonesome like he was so he divided he's going to bring Eve forward he divided the Masterpiece by striking it on the side and brought forth the help made and now to make the two one he put them like any great sculptor in a place that's beautiful a sculptor he says a sculptor wouldn't make a masterpiece and then take it and set it in an alley that makes sense doesn't it he wouldn't take it and set it in an alley somewhere or hide it behind buildings as our Lord told us a man doesn't light a candle and put it under a bushel he placed it up here on the earth and put it in the most beautiful place there was in the Garden of Eden see all right see he placed his Masterpiece the two being one in the Garden of Eden how it must have pleased him that he saw his Masterpiece was well he after that we find out that he rested he was so well pleased with his work and now we see them as a masterpiece family in the Garden of Eden how beautiful it was that's what he's bringing us back to a masterpiece family in a beautiful garden my and it so pleased him till he took rest but why oh watch but while he was resting and trusting in his Masterpiece he made him a amateur God made him a God over the Earth God didn't Brothers God didn't create the Earth for himself to rule he rules the heavens he created the Earth for man to rule he placed his masterpiece the two being one in the Garden of Eden um let's see we're at 53 yeah but while he was resting and trusting to his masterpiece his enemy come in and found this Great Masterpiece see now you're going back to that ancient war where Lucifer tried to uh you know have a coup and take over uh the kingdom of Michael and tried to establish himself in a hostile takeover and he was quickly just dispensed and thrown out of heaven so he says his enemy uh come in and found this great masterpiece and he by deceit he crawls under the garden walls and then he marred this beautiful Masterpiece he marred so that it fell the Masterpiece was broke now I love this but the great Sculptor when he seen the fall of his family the masterpiece he wasn't willing just to leave it lay their face down and ruin he went to work immediately to build it up again he wasn't willing that it should perish lay there like that all the time because he's God and he will not be defeated so he went to work immediately and began to build again unto his own image a man he ended up with Christ but I'm glad in your life and in my life when he sees us laying face down and the enemy knocks us off our feet he's not willing to see you just lay there in ruin it doesn't matter how ruined he's not willing to leave you in that condition he's always going to immediately begin to build you back Thank God now that's the end of my presentation so we come then to this this this lie this false concept how did it get broken You Know The Enemy come in and he slipped under the Garden Wall and he deceived Eve and I I Really Wanna bring an angle tonight that perhaps you haven't heard or in a while maybe and even if you have it's it'll be it'll do you good as a refresher you know Eve gets a lot of bad press and she you know she gets really uh hammered on a lot because of what she did and thanks to Eve you know and and the and and we hear a lot of of you know uh I don't even want to DARE go down that path but you know I'm here to tell you something that that God loved Eve just as much as he loved Adam and when she fell he didn't love her any less now his law would have required something just like you his law would require him to to take you out but that's why Christ came Hallelujah when Esther came before a hazarus without it without a legal standing that the law was she had to die but a hazardous loved her and extended the Royal scepter and that scepter was Christ and it stood between her in judgment Hallelujah see so now watch you're going to watch a beautiful love story he says in 1955 in the message job he says I see I love that word he says Yonder I see and I think you know we were talking about it here recently what is it a prophet sees I'm so glad to be a follower of a prophet Yonder I see Adam and Eve now I want you to listen to the how a prophet words this Yonder I see Adam and Eve that first little sweethearts isn't that adorable that first little sweethearts there in the Garden of Eden I see Adam back there and when he put his arms around his little sweetheart to walk out with her for God had condemned them and he started out with his arms around his darling and Adam was not deceived he didn't have to walk out he didn't have to walk out I hope you see Christ at his bride he didn't have to go to Calvary he didn't have to but he wanted to he walked out because he loved his wife he walked out with both eyes wide open no matter no matter I love this line no matter if she had to go to torment he'd go with her oh my goodness oh I want I thought I'm gonna have to resist going down getting on one knee and singing to my wife oh my God when God now watch this when God saw that when God saw what Adam was willing to do he didn't have to do it he could have just said you broke the word of God and God would have his law would have destroyed her and he would have gave adam another wife and and she would have been burnt with the serpent see because that's God's Wrath God's law was broken but Adam portraying Christ you had no chance you would have went to hell with the Devil you were just as guilty in this life as the devil was when he tried to take over Heaven you were also in defiance of God but God rich in Mercy Christ loving you he didn't have to go to Calvary but he did then he says if she had to go to torment he'd go with her and when God looked down and seen that love of a human being it was so great that he couldn't stand at himself that's right he said I'll come and go too oh Hallelujah God said this is a portrait rolling on my heartstrings this is my plan in Redemption and Someday I'm gonna do the same thing Hallelujah there was a Divine message in those bloody sheepskins those bloody lands lambskins there was a message that God was giving to them someday I'll join you in the earth someday I'll be born of a woman just like you I'll grow and I'll become a man and I don't worry my dear I'll please God in everything and you get credit for my life I'll please God for the both of us I won't just go with you to judgment in fact he doesn't just go with us to judgment he goes instead of us to judgment Satan deceived Eve and to think to think something good and a tree to be desired to make one wise is the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil she was told not to eat it it's told not to touch it she even testified that God said don't even don't look at it don't touch it don't have nothing to do with it stand away from it Satan deceived her into thinking that it was something good and that it was a tree to be desired to make one wise and here's here's something that brother Branham points out over and over and over I could have just read all the quotes tonight till closing time how many times he said what I just put one of them I just brought one quote but he starts saying it in the 50s and runs all the way into the 60s and he's saying it over and over and over again we're going to realize here that that when Satan deceived her into into thinking it was something good she didn't believe she was doing something wrong you understand it wasn't like us like James said when a man is in is enticed of his own sin and led away when lust you know he lust and he's enticed and of his own sin and then he gets LED away and then when that ends its death with Eve that's not what was happening this isn't even some lustful passion Eve actually believed that you know she she was doing something good that that that that she didn't believe she was doing something wrong she thought she was right she was deceived but she thought she was right brother Brandon starts saying it here God making his promise remember how he took Adam and Eve before the world was before sin came into the world look at Adam what a beautiful type Adam and Eve was a type of Christ in his church now remember now watch this is real tricky you're going to have to really pay attention because I have to explain it to you now remember Eve did not sin now we're about to read you know uh First Timothy 2 and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression brother Brown's not denying that I'm gonna just hold on eat remember Eve did not sin Adam sinned that's right not Eve Adam's sin see not Eve she was the one who did the ACT but Adam done the sinning the woman was deceived see so now when you read first Timothy 2 14 and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression that's true but remember Paul had even previous to that had already taught the Romans in 5 12 and 14 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world all right and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned verse 14 nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression see so so we realized that Eve certainly committed a transgression of God's word but it wasn't Eve that broke the world that's what a prophet is saying it wasn't Eve that broke the world Eve got tricked into she thought it was something good she didn't think it was something bad it was Adam's sin that collapsed nature and plunged all us all into sin and death when Adam felt brother Branham said when Adam fell everything under him fell all nature all creation all animals Eve also found everybody everything and when Adam did that see because Adam wasn't merely a Son of God the Bible says he was the son of God he was the first Adam that's why Christ come as the second Adam because it's going to have to be somebody who's the son of God but now born of a woman come into the world born of a woman he's the only begotten of the father see but he had no sin there was no sex act to get him here it was God returning the order back to the spoken word and using Christ he was going to redeem me and you the same way and redeem his whole earth the same way why because he's God and he will not be defeated it doesn't matter how Wicked This World gets it doesn't matter how weak I might feel God is not going to be defeated see so it wasn't he she did transgress the word of God but she's not the one who broke the world brother Adam goes on the Bible says she was deceived she thought she was right and brother Brandon makes that statement again and again and again and again year after year after year after year she thought she was right but Adam note it was wrong see and now look when Adam saw Eve had sinned and had done wrong Adam walked right out not deceived but with both eyes open but he loved Eve see he so loved Eve that he took her place in death with her and walked out with her see brother Adam said that's Christ in the church the church was guilty but Christ took our place he comes now to show us the father he says now now he's he's telling you a story you still got your imagination station working show us the father and it's sad as it'll satisfy us but then when I see and here's a prophet back with his prophetic eyes he's seeing something again but then when I see when poor little Eve see they they make all kinds of claims that brother Branham hated women and he was terrible and he was misogynistic and he was all this kind of stuff I wish they would publish this kind of stuff on the website he says but when I see when poor little Eve looked over in the face of Adam and knowed that she was the cause of the fall of the human race she threw her arms around him and Adam was not deceived the Bible said he walked out with both eyes open Eve was deceived he said so he walked out he seen that he wasn't deceived so he wasn't deceived and knew he wasn't deceived so his wife was turned and he put his arms around her oh friends that's what happened to me one day that's what happened to me when I knew that I was guilty I threw my arms around him at Calvary and he threw his arms right back around me again Hallelujah Eve never thought she was wrong she and brother Ben said she didn't want to do something wrong it wasn't like that it wasn't like that she wasn't caught in some passion emotion and committed adultery against her husband she loved Adam she loved Adam they were sweethearts she was so convinced that it was a good thing she was so convinced even after the fact she was so convinced that it was a good thing she revealed it to Adam right away without any feeling of Shame up to that point she immediately went and showed it to Adam and said look look what I look what I've discovered she had no shame she wasn't embarrassed she didn't come weeping and crying you understand are you in Eve's mind now for a minute you're you're in her heart with me this is where a prophet has taken us to because it this is exposing me I I don't want to be a sinner I want to be holy I I tried to do my best and I know I failed and I know I have but I don't want to I want to be holy and I want to put my arms around the only one who can save me thank God he put his arms around you he put his arms around me she's so convinced she comes immediately to tell him about it no shame not not at that not at that point see Satan brother says and uses different terms one time he says 95 other times he talks about one percent you know one word Satan gave her 99 pure gospel and deceived her 99 pure gospel say wow if it's that tight how in the world am I ever going to know I mean if it's if it's 99 pure gospel here's the only thing you got to look for here's the only thing you got to look for does it change the word what the devil's trying to get you to believe you see with Eve all it was was one three letter word but it changed what God told her not to do to doing so it wasn't it wasn't though it was only one little three-letter word though it was only one percent wrong but that one percent is all it took and all she would have had to have done was said wait a minute wait a minute he told me not to you're telling me to you see it's just like the Trinity the Trinity's only the the the Trinity Doctrine is just a one percent wording error that's really all it is it's one Greek word different that lists three that lists Father Son and Holy Ghost as three persons see rather than three offices he and brother Brown said he didn't he is a trinity he does operate in a trinity brother Branham taught the Trinity he absolutely taught the Trinity he just didn't teach the Catholic version of the trinity but he taught the Bible version of the Trinity that he was God above god with God in the same God see and so Father Son and Holy Ghost Darwin in evolution is only one percent wording error oh he's absolutely correct except for one thing he thinks the species crossed over and they don't the Bible said every seed brings forth of its own kind so as soon as I don't care if it's one percent or a half a percent if it changes what God tells you to do in his word and it tells you to do something different leave it alone he says in Fellowship all right he keeps saying this and I can see them going I can see Eve all right here you go turn your own turn on your imagination again I can see Eve see her lay her little head over on Adam's shoulder saying Adam it's all my fault I was the one who did it but Adam so loved his wife you see friends once Adam partook of it then all nature under him fell you see that see then then they not not just she was naked that didn't strike her after the ACT she comes back with a good idea she thought she'd done the right thing she's happy to to tell him but once Adam partookaba partook of it then nature collapsed and immediately Adam and Eve both knew they were naked and they hid themselves you see the difference see so Satan you see the the the thing of it is Satan can only pervert God's way now I want to come to one more point and I'll feel successful that I've bridged last Sunday to this coming Sunday brother random says in the Ephesian Church age in the church age book if he's in church age he starts talking about the tree of knowledge and the tree of of you know of Good and Evil tree of knowledge of Good and Evil versus the Tree of Life and he says a man could not directly come and partake of that tree of life in the midst of the garden that Eternal term that eternal life of the tree had to become flesh first see now remember Moses is just using the term trees in one sense Eve partook of a tree and she had an illicit affair with us with an animal with a serpent but Moses calls it eating the fruit of a tree and so now you've got Christ see this is why they are put out of the Garden of Eden because the he says lest they put forth their hand and take of the tree of life and live forever in other words that catch catch a revelation of Christ because a revelation of Christ is your new birth and if they would catch a revelation of Christ before Calvary then they're going to receive eternal life in a fallen condition and the whole plan is blown to pieces you see you understand this is God's grand scheme this is his great drama this is his plan all along Satan didn't come in one day and Sucker Punch God this was all on the drawing board ages before Satan was even created God had already slew the land before the foundation of the world he already knew what was going to go forward he already knows about you you think I won't be there when he already knows you will be Hallelujah said I can't make it but he already knows you're gonna make it Hallelujah see you've got to remember that Jesus was the son brother but I'm taught that so clear our brothers on our Thursday night men's prayer meeting we're going through the spoken words original seat and brother Branham is making that point how that evil that Christ was the son that she would have had see but she couldn't wait she ran ahead of God's plan but it served God's purpose because Redemption had to play out see so there had to be a false to the so the Tree of Life so then today you realize that Satan now this is a big Point there's a big point Satan can't create he can only pervert he can only take what God is doing and make a copy of it to deceive people by he can't get it perfect he can impersonate all kinds of gifts he can he can appear in all kinds of forms but brother Branham said that when it comes to that life he can't he doesn't have the power to produce the life he can't he can't create he can't give life and so what does he do now catch it I hope I I hope I'm able to to put this in your in your heart tonight he comes to Eve and he offers her this way of gaining knowledge that God had forbid her to go forward in she would have come to that brother Branham says that she would have come to that see but he's he's saying now oh here's a great revelation and she wasn't supposed to touch it right then but he says no you can have it now remember he came to Jesus and put him up and said all you got to do is Fall Down and Worship me you can have it now but Jesus knew he knew not to run ahead of the program he knew he had to go to Calvary it's like brother uh brother Daryl was saying he's in the garden and he's saying God you can father you can do anything but yet there there had to be a sacrifice in order in order to save man that's what brother Daryl that point was so heavy he said it remember he read that where brother Brandon is saying he's sitting around the campfire with his disciples he's out on the boat fishing with the disciples they're they're humans they're men they're friends they're buddies they're they're they're laughing they're talking about the scripture you know one minute they're feeding animals one next minute they're feeding themselves I mean he was a man he got dust on his feet and sweat on his brow he hadn't he you know he had to bathe and change clothes and and he had real life and as he's sitting in brother around says as he's sitting around the campfire looking at these Brethren who he loved he loved them and he knew if I don't do this they can't make it they can't make it if I'm not willing to do this then this has to come to an end but God loving his family and here comes the serpent now remember he's only going to pervert something real and the Bible says when Eve saw that the tree was good and and to be desired to make one wise she took of it so Satan managed to make the false tree the desired tree that's our subtitle tonight a tree to be desired but we find that the tree of life is actually the tree to be desired and Satan got her to think of his knowledge as what needs to be desired that's that's not desirable the tree of life is what is to be desired today the tree of knowledge broke the world and plunged all of God's family into sin but the tree of life brings me back Hallelujah the tree of life brings the world back with it it's a tree to be desired finally brother Branham says in the future home I made this point as I got started see you were made listen to this now this right here will put vitamins in your soul this will give you the devil's answer before he has the question see you were made for an eternal purpose because there's a reason for it now you're made for an eternal reason there's a there's a method to it that's not just a floating statement that's not just poetic license you were made for an eternal purpose because you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you that's back to John 1 1. that great eternal spirit thought about himself as a family and expressed himself in the logos and you were in that spirit and you got expressed into the logos and you're here today an expression of an expression you're the continuation of that same Creation in John 1 and 1. you're literally the continuation of the expression of God so you have an eternal purpose because you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you watch it and he made a earth to take you out of and to make you a human being now here we go sin come along and perverted his way you come in here you come anyhow but you was lost with the world so he come and redeemed you the express attribute and also redeems this Earth by the same way then his purpose rolls on see oh Hallelujah Prophet says oh that does me so much good think of just what lays ahead his purpose rolls On and On You Came From God as an expression but you can't be born lost but then Jesus came and died for you then you accept his life and you become a new creation and then he redeems you all back at the end when it's all over and redeems us back to glory and then the purpose rolls on and rolls on and rolls on and we realize this life was just an interruption to a life I already had oh my God and this is the Beauty and the love of God this is why Calvary is so important this is why that book being claimed was so important that book had my name and your name in it Hallelujah this is why the devil can't stop us because he cannot stop the word of God I have partaken of it listen friends I'm here to tell you I'm a witness I have partaken of the tree of life and I didn't fall no I did the opposite I've been redeemed back to God it didn't bring me death it brought me life he's rebuilding Eden Satan in the serpent preached to Eve about the tree of knowledge it took everything from her it took everything she cared about everything she loved Satan preached through a serpent and she fell for it and it took everything from her that she loved tonight spirit of God not Satan it's not Satan preaching through a serpent to persuade you to death it's a minister of the Gospel with the spirit of God preaching to you about a tree of life it's me trying to persuade you there's no death there's no death here friends this is the beauty of it I I want to tell you something today this is the beauty of what we're believing you're not coming into this building and hearing Satan through a serpent deceive you you're hearing you're hearing the spirit of God not Satan hearing the spirit of God not through a serpent through a preacher through a gospel preacher and what am I doing I'm not taking it a death I'm taking it a life Hallelujah God has already sacrificed his life on your behalf this is exactly why when the death angel comes in this age he has to pass your homes why because the token is applied the Holy Ghost is there that's what happened in the first Exodus he said you'll have a land you've got to put the blood over the over the post in the door and you understand that the blood had a voice that spoke and when the death angel came to the door of an Israelite and he saw that blood a voice spoke to him and said there's already been a death here move on and he moves on I'm here to tell you the death angel is going through the land tonight but when he comes to my house when it comes to your house he sees the blood and he has to just keep on walking he's not going to get God's family we're leaving Egypt Hallelujah this is the bridge friend this is what I'm trying to get you to understand God is rebuilding Eden and you're part of it and the devil finds that he is powerless powerless you know what he could do and what he couldn't do he could and did deceive Eve he couldn't and didn't deceive Adam he he once he became convinced he pulled her right in but what he couldn't do was he couldn't stop Adam from walking out with her oh my and when God saw that love that human love between a man and a woman and those first little sweethearts God said oh that touches my heart someday I'm going to do the same thing Someday I'm gonna walk out with you I'm going to take the sting of death I'm going to take it into my body I'm going to go down to Hell and rip the keys out of Satan's hand and I'm gonna come back out of the grave and I'm going to have freedom for all my family oh my goodness friends that's where we are tonight Hallelujah to believe that stand with me amen God bless you my let the death angel pass God's bride's safe and last in the token he gave that we could be saved oh Hallelujah and glory to God the blood's been applied God's spirit abides let the death angel pass you believe that tonight amen by your heads with me over the building amen let's sing that brother Kenny can we sing that amen you know that song sister Ruth let the death angel pass just play something softly first and then we'll get to that amen bow your heads with me everywhere Lord we thank you for your word tonight I thank you for helping me Lord it was all day back and forth back and forth trying to figure out how to explain this concept how to make it so the people could catch it and I'm so glad I had the assistance of an eagle Prophet to help me put it into wording that Eagles can understand Lord we're Believers tonight we're Believers my goodness we're believers I'm so happy to be a believer I've never been more happy of anything in my life I am a believer of your word and when I hear tonight how it all started and how it went and how you recovered it and how you saved us and your plans for redeeming and it's already underway and I've already experienced it I'm not here tonight just preaching an imaginary Tale [Music] this isn't some epic fiction some epic drama fiction man-made creation this is real there was a a great being who filled all time space and Eternity he thought of me he thought of us he thought of a world he thought of himself as a father he thought of himself as a king of a great Kingdom [Music] he moves into a form almost like a little boy moving around drawing pictures he's starting he's coming forward millions of years he's creating universes the universe with galaxies after Galaxy after Galaxy after Galaxy star after star billions and billions and billions of them with all of their great scientific achievement there and they're just about maxed out now Lord they're at the end technology and science can't go too much further Lord we already have the last technological feat that a prophet saw before the world was destroyed he saw driverless cars that's being implemented every day Lord it grows a little more and a little more and a little more he didn't see colonies on Mars and colonies on the moon he didn't see any of that he said I saw driverless cars and then after that I saw the world blown to pieces we know Lord that the Earth with its maxed out science [Music] it can't even chart it can't it's it they they know that there's more galaxies and stars that they can see that they can't even count or get their mind around to say nothing of the what they can't see beyond the beyond the Beyond of the Beyond and every time they get a a new lens a new advancement they shine it on a dark spot in space and after no time they see whole new galaxies again going further and further and further and further and further it's endless and this is the great God that great Fountain who built it all and wants to share he wants to share this being wants to share his eternal life with people I pray tonight Lord God that you'll let us see the value in that tree of life let us move away from that one percent of error Satan tries to fill our whole lives with that one percent changes our lives changes our our activities change our schedules away from your word it always goes away from your word help us tonight Lord God to adjust our hearts and Minds to the word of God 100 to the Tree of Life [Music] may it be in young people may it be in the Mary the single the Elder Lord may you granted to us tonight we're almost home we're almost home Hallelujah Jesus break our hearts stir our hearts and Minds Lord God to be fervent and serving you it's wrapping up quickly that great being moved himself into a form and from there he spawned it all made a garden made it perfect had a family Satan Marta you knew he would you let it happen it served your purpose you began building back a man and you got to Jesus the Keystone of it all the Keystone between the old and the new the thing that joins all the families of God we're all now enjoined through the blood of Christ you took down the middle wall of partition you've joined man back to God through Christ we thank you for that Lord God tonight I pray that you'll move on the hearts of people to dedicate their lives and be zealous for you Lord we see this world falling apart I'm glad to know I'm glad I'm so glad to know when I read the the madness and the headlines and the world falling apart and it's so sad and it's so tragic and it's getting so much worse it's almost it's almost intolerable even to hear it I'm glad to know that you're gonna bring it all back you're gonna bring it all back you're not gonna lose one not even one Hallelujah thine they were the father has given them to you now they are yours you took the book you loosed the seal you claim for your bride

brother's lock on our permanent list and as you all know brother Joe had a had a shocking thing where he went and had some tests run and they he had massive blockages everywhere they actually gave him almost like emergency medication said you could have a stroke any minute and he had uh blockages in two different areas of his body I think one around his heart one and More in his neck and they were worried about heart attacks they're worried about strokes and they just pumped the Brother full of all kinds of meds but we've been praying for him and brother Joe went to MUSC today said at my appointment with the neurologist at MUSC because they had to look at all those veins leading to his brain they did a split screen with my chart and showed me the layers of my vertebral arteries and told me that she can see absolutely no blockage whatsoever and then to the arteries going up my neck I am completely clear she does not understand it she can't explain it to me she read the dictation of the doctor that was on that night along with the CAT scan done and found the blockages she does she said he said she sees tiny spots and other low in other different places areas but she said that she would uh she would not be at all concerned about it because if she looked she said if I looked I could find that in just about every person my age man or woman so he just has the natural things that they would see for a man's age see and he says but as to any blockages in the vertebral arteries she sees nothing at all told me to feel free and follow up with the vascular doctor if I did not feel comfortable with her decision this woman is the top expert she's done 160 of these procedures and and and and these other doctors send these terrible cases to her and she told Joe she said this is the first time in 160 surgeries they've sent me a patient and I'm deciding you don't need surgery foreign you can go see him if you want to uh she said that decision be totally up to me I told her no I trust you 100 I have no reason not to trust uh you uh that I simply believe I was healed so I was I told I was told not to worry about a stroke or even refilling any medicines they were given to me the night of the incident the case is closed today thank the Lord oh God so they've got Specialists that can see them in CAT scans that can see them and now the chief specialist looks again and
