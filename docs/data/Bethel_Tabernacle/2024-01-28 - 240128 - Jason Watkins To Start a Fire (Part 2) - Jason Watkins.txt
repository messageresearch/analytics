I live for you alone every breath that I take every moment I'm way Lord have your way in me Lord I give you my heart I give you my soul I leave for you alone every breath that I take every moment I

praise all that I adore is in [Applause] [Music] you Lord I give you my heart I give you my soul I live for you alone every breath that I take every moment [Music] IW Lord have your way in me sounds like a prayer amen had a good Sunday school lesson always thinking always looking towards the Lord looking under Jesus the author and finisher of of our faith every moment of every day amen I really enjoy that I just there's times you get away from it but there's times he knows your thoughts and what you're thinking brother brandom used to talk about his wife and she'd be ironing clothes and she'd be praying as she was doing that amen we want to the holy spirit's going to make you do something amen so the main thing is get the Holy Spirit cuz he's the only one that can please God Amen I have a couple of requests of prayer I had a a man that I worked with at Buford County over a year ago uh his name was Bruce he came to um the wedding and everything his wife went in for a surgery on a she had a growth on her back and he just wanted us to pray for her her name is Patty so that um it would be benign and there was nothing and then he text me to a l later he has a friend of his in Wisconsin that was actually going through the exact same thing so we want to remember them to this morning the man in Wisconson his name is Keith Bruce Noak his wife's name is Patty um just a little update on my son so he texts me this morning and just says that um the way he put I raised my hand about some issues at work and they let me go that's what all this that I got there's so much more that goes behind the scenes and you know in his eyes he told me the truth because that's that's just the way that he sees it um you know we just want to pray for him you know as a dad you just I just want so much to help him but the thing is he just doesn't want to help himself and it's a decision I mean you know when I came to the Lord I just made a decision and I was not in a message church I was raised a Catholic was out in the world in the Marine Corps um and I went to a church four weeks in a row and I made a decision and I really didn't know what I was doing and you said well what are you talking about but that decision brought me to where I I am I think I drank one more time didn't get drunk because it wasn't having effect but I just knew at that moment it was called the Eagle's Nest it was a charismatic church and all he did was ask you if you want to we had our heads bowed if you want to give your heart to the Lord but I it was like the Lord was sitting at ceiling height to me and uh I raised my hand of course then everybody sitting up says you that raised your hand come up front I know who I raised my hand to I was the first one with up front not to but I knew what I had done and he honored that to the point to where I grew up like a calf in a stall for the first two or three years and then after that troubles came but the decision if it's a true and honest sincere decision in the heart God will honor it and you won't know what's going on while you're serving God all your life and everything it's because he honored it and he he's the one that sought you out I'm sorry I'm getting worried but praise the Lord we're here to collect the tithes and offerings if you have a request upon your heart this morning you know he sees that he sees that we are so captivated in this carnal body but he sees that where two or three are gathered do you do you see him in his Corporal body no but he's here let's pray father I love you this morning we come to you father as thirsting in our hearts because you put something in there to thirst after you and we just pray that you would meet that thirst in each and every heart this morning Lord we remember Patty Noak and my friend's friend Keith that had growths removed Lord Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray that they would both be benign Lord for my son and the request upon the hearts here I've committed him to you father I won't take him back he's in your hands and that's where I stand by faith father I love him with all my heart and I just pray that you would have your way bring him to that place father of total surrender to you as we collect the tithes and offerings I pray that you would bless the cheerful Giver father bless your people Lord Lord we thank you that we have an anchor

song from Brother John man to give us a song let's give him a hand [Applause] amen [Music] [Music] [Music] God bless you Amen brother Jason had requested this song a couple weeks ago and I had listened to it and promptly forgot about it until I was praying before bed last night and came to my mind oh Lord help me so might be a little a little rough from a distance he' been watching me and I guess somehow he knew that in my heart I long to be like he in time the closer we became the more it seemed I grew I'd fall he'd pick me up and I'd try again again he loves me even when I do the things I should [Music] do and when I fall to do the things I [Music] should I heard it say that love is blind and I've come to know it's true he forgets the bad and remembers all the [Music] good in my father's eyes there's no wrong I've Done In My Father's Eyes I am the perfect son he must see what I can see and it makes me want to try to be like the son that's in my father's [Music] eyes and when this life is over my last trial I've gone through will be worth it all to hear him say Well [Music] done maybe then I'll understand just what he sees in me but I'm sure I'll find he was blinded by a son in My Father's Eyes oh there's no wrong of done in My Father's Eyes I am the perfect [Music] son he must see someone I can see and it makes me want to try to be like the sun that's in My Father's Eyes must see someone I can't see and it makes me want to try to be like the sun that's in My Father's [Music] [Applause] Eyes [Music] ready for the word amen I learn how to [Music] lean and depend on Jesus he's my [Music] friend he my God I learn how to [Music] lean and depend on Jesus I found out that if I trust him he will provide I learn how to lean and depend on Jesus I learn how to

chapter 12 man greet you in the name of the Lord happy to have you here in the house of God Amen thanks for remembering me buddy that was excellent amen and praise the Lord I wasn't going to send a hit squad I knew you'd get to it eventually amen you love the Lord I want to make just a quick announcement that uh next Sunday brother George Smith will be with us so looking forward to that haven't had brother George through in a long time amen I honestly not sure it was me I think it was the draw to come see my mom and greet her that's probably what did it but amen he's gonna come through talk to him he was in Arizona the other day and so we got it planned out for next weekend I'm looking forward to that amen praise the Lord weeks ago we had brother Joe last weekend the week prior we were preached on to start a fire we're preaching part two of that today to start a fire part two we're going to read this opening text we'll let you be seated and then we have another followup text Luke 12: 49 through 53 amen amen all right I am come to send fire on the earth and what will I if it be already kindled but I have a baptism to be baptized with and how am I straightened till it be accomplished suppose ye that I am come to give peace on Earth I tell you nay but rather division for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided three against two and two against three the father shall be divided against the Son and the son against the father the mother against the daughter-in-law and the daughter against the mother and the Mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law I think I read that correctly amen let's pray Lord when we read your words in this passage it can feel at times Lord uncomfortable to us to read it because it's not how we like to think of the Gospel but Lord we can't deny that this is what you said and so what you said is not in question it's in your Bible Lord but we want to understand it so I pray for your help today today that we can understand now you made a promise Lord that when he the Holy Ghost come that he would lead us and guide us and so father we are relying upon that promise today and I pray you'll be my helper Lord as we try to go through this material in a studious way I don't want to skip any o over any of it I hope to get to all of it but Lord I just I'll need your help for that so we commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated we're going to invite you now to Acts chapter 2 we'll just take a reading a very familiar reading to us in Acts chapter 2 and we'll begin at verse one and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all filled with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind I don't think this was a figment of Luke's imagination amen I think they actually heard something it was sounded like a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting now a storm could rage outside and a tornado could touch down near you and people say it sounds like a locomotive so there could come a a a rushing Mighty Wind that could sound quite ominous and actually the wind of it fill all the house where you're sitting amen amen but that's not likely to bring this next verse to pass catch it and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of theml now I read to you a very ominous reading from Luke 40 uh Luke 12 about a fire coming into the Earth and um I hope today to be able to connect that fire to this fire amen amen all right and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and here's the result and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues if a tornado fills your house full of wind you might wish you had the Holy Ghost you probably really call on the Lord and call on the holy ghost at that moment but these people were filled with it amen and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance amen now watch this this goes to show you that you getting the Holy Ghost is not a selfish thing to hoard but it's actually comes with the purpose to make you an an ambassador amen you understand that so so there's a great ripple effect or collateral effect of you getting the Holy Ghost I will promise you as a man who raised children and have now feel like I half raised my grandkids to my that was just my doing amen um it's not their parents needed it but I I bued in a lot of times but I enjoyed it I don't regret it no apologies no apologies Matt no apologies sorry amen don't apologize for that one second not going to apologize to Jonathan not going to apologize for that at all amen whenever they didn't do the right job I'll let them know the and if I didn't sister Debbie did so I spent half my time raising them calming her down amen but I promise you that the Holy Ghost in you is what you're going to need if you want to it to have a collateral effect on your children now maybe you don't want that but I hope you do amen a lot of times people don't want the Holy Ghost in their home because it disrupts things Jesus said that see the reason it the reason it starts a fire what we might call destruction is because people resist the truth so as I said to you last time it's not on God it's on you if you're resisting the Holy Ghost and the fire of God comes in and burns up you know uh burns up you know you built as as the Bible says you built on a lot of wood hay and stubble and the Holy Ghost comes in and burns it all up and you got nothing left well you should still thank God because that's what needed to happen the idea of the Fire and Fire is not fun the idea of the fire is to purge yeah Amen to cleanse Amen to transform the fire of the Holy Ghost is a transformative fire that when it comes down inside you will change everything am it will change everything now watch this verse five there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded astonished they stupified because that every man heard them speak in his own languag amen and they were all amazed and marveled saying to one another behold are not all these which speak galileans and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born I've experienced that I heard a man speak to me and ask me a question in in Arabic and I understood it flawlessly in English amen I don't speak a word of Arabic and I understood his question so much that I started to try to answer it without waiting on the translator to tell me what the question was and the translator interrupted me and said hey I haven't even told you what he said and that was at that moment I realized the Holy Spirit was so present I heard him in my own language you say did you hear English it's hard to explain I don't I don't know if I heard English like in this ear but I heard English on an inside ear that's as close as I can come to telling you my I'm only telling you that to tell you this is real amen this isn't hyperbole this isn't a parable this happened amen and I want more of it that's what I want friends that's what I want in my life I want it in your life I want every detail of what I read here in in the book of Acts that happened to them in the upper room if we are restored back to them then we ought to have every detail amen now look what it did verse 4 42 this was this proved that it was of God and all I'm sorry and they continued this is after they believed and were baptized in verse 41 they gladly received his word baptized verse 42 they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in Breaking of bread and prayers so they became real Christians yes now they were already devout people you understand they all already lived a very religious holy Sanctified life the unwise Virgin live a Sanctified holy life but they're not yet born again they they have the Holy Ghost they've had an experience of the Holy Ghost on their flesh and on their spirit and they have believed un Christ to a to a Saving Grace save from destruction but they clearly are not born again because in Matthew 25 we see them being judged amen and that's certainly not the bride who's Seated on the throne Hallelujah but yet and I'm I'm not saying these devout men are unwise virgin I'm only using that as an example to show you that these were devout men also yet they were not born again of the spirit of God and when they were born again of the spirit of God they didn't become more devout what they did was keep saying Amen to every word amen no wonder that's the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost not that it makes you devout brother brandham said sanctification which is a work of the Holy Ghost will make you stop lying and start going to church it'll clean your life up that's what the UN unwise virgin has happened the king called them righteous people Revelation Book of Revelation calls them saints Saints means Sanctified amen so the point that I want to make again again is that this fire changes you from not just being devout but it actually causes you to say to continue to not only say Amen to the word they asked Peter what must we do he told them okay let's do it and then after that they kept believing and they kept believing and they kept praying and they started breaking bread and they stayed in The Fellowship of the Saints I'm here to tell you this fire that Jesus talked about that seems ominous is is the most wonderful thing that if you ever accept it it'll come down in your life and make you a child of God like he envisioned you to be amen long before you were ever born that's right I don't want to recap too much I don't have time I have so much to get to today but but and that so that that's enough on that what one of the things that that we concluded last time was that when we came to Ruth which was a type of the Bride we found that when Boaz enumerated her life she couldn't understand why why would you take notice of me I'm a I'm not even of this nation I'm a I'm of the of a heathen nation of the moabites that came by an incestual uh Affair between lot and his daughters and and I and I and we we have a semblance of Jehovah but by no means I mean just because you're say well let's like people would say all brother say are you're a Christian they say I'm an American well just because America started on Christian Foundation that doesn't mean because you're an American you're a Christian far from it so just because they might have had some understanding of of the god of Moses that didn't make they were anything outside of of of Israel was a heathen Nation amen understand so it's just like you no matter what the gene of God might be in you you were born in sin you were born as an alien you were born and and we showed you in the in the in the letter uh that sister Rebecca Smith published in only believe magazine how brother brandham explained we're all bastard children that we're all born illegitimately this is this is this is the beauty of adoption in the Holy Ghost because you're born as an illegitimate child and you're adopted into the family of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother brandham taught made legitimate amen see so so in in that respect it's it's not always in every respect the spirit of adoption is not exactly like we would talk about adopting a a baby but in that regard it's very similar and so so we realize he brother Brenham puts it there in his own and do not fear sister your new birth or anybody's New Birth uh uh corrects it all I just say thank God thank God thank God corrects it all and we we finished up by showing you that under the order of MDC that in the spirit of adoption which is the Holy Ghost it brings you under the order of MDC who had no beginning of days or ending of life therefore it didn't matter how you were born or how you die or whatever was in the middle you're in the order of MDC nothing of this Fallen life counts against me so it's a powerful image that he he in fact is when she asked him why would you be mindful of me and we we finished by pointing out that the only things he named were her good things and he didn't talk about her bad things say well how do we know she had them because we're all born in sin and there's none good no not one I could read it today there's none good no not Ruth there's none good no no not Abraham Abraham lied and cheated and coni but when Paul told his story it was perfect why because he is he never staggered at the promise I'm here to tell you something friends it should not Shock you that when I say to you that you have believed the word of this hour and you have said amen and the Holy Ghost has acknowledged that by giving sealing you in it doesn't matter whatever you have done it's all eliminated and nothing you ever do will count against you you are now perfect in Christ amen amen amen so it's a powerful image it conveys this fire a transformative power the sacrif of Christ was designed to do nothing less so he's only regarding once I'm in Christ that he's only regarding the remaining good in you is there good in me after I'm born again there's this one good I'm like Mary be it unto me according to Thy word amen see so it's it's and we we we we were showing you how that the Rapture like Ruth was gleaning the Rapture is the final gleaning it's uh it's gleaning of 2,000 years and taking God's choice family out of the church a bride called out of the church in the resurrection he gives you this final calling and I'm so glad because when that final oh my when that final calling comes and I'm standing on the other side in a glorified condition there won't be any part of me that I hated any part of me that I was ashamed of any part of me that failed any part of me that's dirty any part of me that there's none of that it's all gone I'm completely transformed I he's only taken the good in me that come from a gene that was actually come from him amen turns me into the real me that had the real me that had really been the real me all along long it connects what it does friends in that final calling it it finishes the process of the new birth because it finally changes your body I'm glad the new birth isn't going to leave me in this one I'm glad I don't have to face a Thousand-Year Millennium in this one you say well what if he restored your health and restored your youth I'd still know that this body had failed him and I want to be in a body that's never failed him Hallelujah it it literally I want to be flawlessly connected from my origin and our and my destination connected back to God that Fountain back in eternity I don't just want to say I am right here today the best I can do is preach and say it is spiritually that and you're New Birth has connected your origin to your destiny and put you back across the chasm and we Rejoice over that but but but this is partial realization I'm coming to perfect realization see so I can I can say that there is now therefore no condemnation possible for me and that's right now that's not coming that's right now but I but you know friends that's it I I that I'm still here are struggling along and I just want to be Beyond The Struggle Hallelujah so I say whatever that fire has to do in my life let it change [Applause] me I don't have it on my PowerPoint I I missed it and I probably it's good because I just want to read through it let me c give you this from Life 1957 brother Mark go ahead and get my PowerPoint ready you can put up thep title slide let me catch this one I'll Advance one frame to there brother Brandon now just listen he says in the message life is that a beautiful title or what the great now I just want you you're gonna this is poetry friends you're just going to almost want to close your eyes and just Envision this as a prophet don't go to sleep on me though brother J J said I could close my eyes Mom I fell asleep the great Fountain of all eternity was that Spirit of love joy that Spirit of honesty that Spirit of tress in this Perfection and then out of the existence of the father went the logos which was the son which was a theophany which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth in a Celestial body that's the logos the word spoke out of them great fountain mountains of life and went forth and there was the theophany which was God made into word then that theophany was made flesh in the person Jes Christ Jesus and then all the fullness of the trinity dwelt in him both Father Son and Holy Spirit all in that not easy to understand amen and that's now watch now that's Christ all right now watch watch he how as he goes on and that's the very way we go Plum back to the original beginning of God there we are born again not of Flesh born again not of blood Born Again by the spirit and in that eternal spirit of love and honesty comes down to make its place in us and then when we die from this life we go into the body which if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved we have a theophany to go into a Celestial a body Celestial amen then at the coming of the Lord Jesus this body is picked up from the Earth again he's talking about if you go by the way of the Grave this body is picked up from the Earth again and made in a glorified state to live in his presence forever you understand why at at funerals I'm I'm always reminding the family I reminded my family when we put brother Eddie and buried his Temple and I said now this is not brother Eddie this is just the temple he lived in where only sto in it that's all we're doing we're not burying brother Eddie he's alive and well we're only storing the temple he lived in when he comes back on Resurrection morning he'll come right back here and pick this body up and it'll be changed in a moment Hallelujah friend you haven't lost your loved ones oh I'm here to tell you they're more alive than you will ever be alive in this world so he says in so if this which if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved we have a theophany to go to a body Celestial then at the coming of the Lord Jesus his body is picked up from the Earth again and made in a glorified state to live in his presence forever then all the perversion all the things oh listen to this then all the perversion all the things that was in the perversion all goes out of existence faith f flesh goes to its punishment hell opens up her mouth and swallows it all swallows in all the evil and the perversion and God and his beloved Church his bride takes their stand for the eternities to roll on that's the great hope of the Christian church as David screamed out oh thy loving kindness is better to me than life so I'll ask you the question today in light of what you just heard is Walking In The Fire worth it I just say yes whatever the fire has to burn and consume now however hot however trial whatever division it might cause and I the whole world say my family might leave me the whole world might leave you but Christ won't leave you I'm here to tell you take your stand with the Lord Jesus and on that day he'll stand with you it's worth it is it worth it Church Revelation and and I I I probably should read it but I won't because it would just take too much [Music] time so let me just let me just give you a break down you can study it when you go back home cuz Revelation chapter 1 let me say it like this Revelation chap 1 is the early church before the hybrid hybridization started in in Chapter 2 by the that's why chapter 2 starts at 853 not ad33 because brother said that first couple of decades church was perfect amen so brother and I've got a quote for you here brother brandham take and he starts from Revelation 21 and he says now from right here and he goes on to show how from that point you're dealing with a a hybrid church it's already starting to lose its first love but prior to chapter 2 you have the complete revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ so the unsealing today the unsealing of the seventh seal today restores us back to the Revelation One Church it absolutely does does you go home today you read the first five verses because that's all about the deity of Jesus Christ that this mysterious God who was a fountain and then he was a theophany and then he was a flesh and then he ascended and you know and then then this whole this whole Trinity of God what's the balance I I I've said this before I say it again I don't see how any trinitarian can read Revelation 1 1:5 and stay a trinitarian because it's so so clearly that that that that God who fills all time space and Eternity is Jesus Christ unmistakably Jesus Christ in those first five verses now that's the Revelation the deity of Jesus Christ that then when you come to verse six we find that it says and this same one that I just got through telling you about hath now made us now it switches to his church it hath made us Kings and Priests unto God Amen understand all right so so when we when we think about re being restored to the Revelation One Church you'll look down from verse 6 to 18 and we are made first of all in verse six we're made priest unto God uh who had been who had been so clearly identified ases Jesus Christ in all of his glory and it's described in those previous five taken as a whole then now just pay close attention to me because I'm I'm going to you know really make some statements and you're going to want to keep up taken as a whole Revelation 1 veres 1-8 show this glorious church as I've said prior to the fall all right let me let me let me prove that to you you because by the time you get to chapter two you've got what brother brandham calls an ad mixture of true and false now you can read it when you go into chapter two he commends the true church but he's also got a problem with the ni Deeds of the nickan and he comes back and commends the church and then he says but you've left your first love and then he comes back he says but you've had patience and have not denied my name but you got the issue so you understand that that's why the the the the church ages when brother Brandon begins with the Ephesian Church ages he's he's starting from the moment when when instead of Christ being able to come and get a bride she's already starting to backslide and that and and instead of instead of getting her turned around he warns her don't keep going because if you do I'll remove your Candlestick well she did and he did and it went on to the second one and it was worse amen and after the second messenger Irene IUS they don't even understand Revelation 1 1:5 clearly anymore they've lost the meaning of the godhead irenius was the last one time he's gone the church don't even have a clear understanding and if you can't understand the relationship between Christ and the father you'll never understand the relationship between you and the father cuz you're only a continuation of what he was you see why that had to be restored in this last day and so so so you you'll find then that it's already come and AD mixture brother brandham says in a resume of the ages look where he starts Revelation 2:1 describes the Lord Jesus as in the midst of his church and holding the messengers in his right hand because this bride has fallen because the church corporate is now an ad mixture of true and false amen not got to read that so you don't think I made that up all right you with me all right now let me darken that perect perfect so just as there was an unmistakable bride age or a bride time uh a time of the full word on the front end of the Ephesian Church age so now in the restoration there is a restoration on the on the latter End of the leoan Age back to the full bride time amen so it's a bright age to start with and a bright age to end with what does a bright age entail it means the ministry of the son of man which is that same Jesus living in his church undefiled and and and unobstructed he's he's the full word and that brings the Jubilee and that brings the token and that brings the abstract title deed see so you can see that in your mind I'm sure no that's why he's the Alpha and the Omega and brother brandham says you don't say a whole lot about the middle because he's in the middle he's walking in the midst of the seven lampstands but not everything in the middle is purely him anymore it's a hybridization as we read all right it's a hybridization an ad mixture it's not purely him but he comes back to purely him when do you have je when do you have Jesus as purely him when a Doctrine is revealed no amen when a people have received it eaten it and become it amen see and and so that's why you know brother Bram even makes some illustrations that I I can feel myself trying to get sidetracked and I'm not going to do that I'm going to keep moving so so we find out then that that it turns the original full token this is why brother Brandon would say the ages only had a dip because the token is proportionate to the level of word you have always amen all right so it's not that it wasn't the Holy Ghost it's just that their word their misunderstanding of the word blocked part of their uh uh part of the allotment or ra I think more perfectly I could say Christ was HD Ed from being his full self because you can't diminish him I don't want to give the language that a dip meant he was something diminished he was still who he was but brother brand you remember brother brandham said that the church had him Bound for two almost 2,000 years that he couldn't work in the church but in the opening of the seals it loosed him he's now Unbound because why he's got a people who say Amen once again to every word and that entitles them to the Token obedience to the word entitles you to the Token amen you with me amen all right so this is so this then we find that just as Israel is restored under the trumpets to their rightful land the Omega bride is restored to her position in the word of full Authority Under the seal she seated together in Heavenly places with God in Christ we are made brother brandham emphasizes that we are made Kings and Priests to God because we're extending he is now able to extend his word through our lives amen now you remember when I started the great advantage of this fire don't Lament The Fire amen because it makes you available to be for that fire fire to have a ripple effect for that fire to have a a collateral effect on people you love amen and I'm here to tell you parents and grandparents sometimes have to pray you know broken hearted tears because they see the fire of God burning up their children and they have to keep praying Lord pour it on and that's not easy see your child or grandchild suffering but you know that he knows what he's doing you can trust him M daddies grandparents you can trust him Hallelujah see so so we find then that it's it we're made Kings and Priests because he's now able to extend his word through our lives that's what he was that's what he was always after in Genesis 1 128 be fruitful and multiply and replenish the plan was always what it is brother brandham didn't make that up that's what it was in Genesis but sin and the fall interrupted his program brother brandham said but you come anyway but you were lost and so he sent Christ in the form of a human being to die for you and redeems his family back to him and then the eternities roll on my never to be broken again in that wonderful as this bride is predestinated not to fall so we go forth in power and demonstration from now into the ceaseless ages and from there all the way into the future outpouring of the Hidden Mana which is a Eternal revelation of Jesus Christ oh my friends what lays in front of us I said it before I say it a thousand times again our future is bright so so the current stage the current stage of this ministry today brother Jason what's it all about what is the message all about is it just God sent a prophet it's much more than that what is the current stage of this ministry it is it is Christ moving through his family uh who who are literally an expression of that original Fountain I don't know if you can grasp this today but you are a continued expression of that fountain in eternity that we read about in life from 19 57 from that time in that Fountain you existed you were an attribute in that in that great Fountain and he said out of there poured forth love and poured forth mercy and poured forth healing and poured forth Grace and I'll say this and it poured forth family yeah amen see and so we find that that it's it's Christ moving through his family an expression of that original found Mountain she's part of the continuation of creation she's now taking her place and this is a strong statement you buckled in she's taking her place now in the new birth as part of God's godhead amen let's see 1965 God's provided place of worship in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily where we we by say we in there our sons and daughters to God in God's godhead yes as Sons and Daughters we're in the family if you're in there so you know if if you're going to use a trinitarian 2+ 2 equals 4 then then he's not three he's like a couple of million but that's not how you think of him amen see it's not it's not thought of linearly like that it and the reason they think of it linearly like that is because they don't understand brother bram's explanation on expression it's just him continuing to express himself in a further part he explained it so good there in life how that Jesus how that the fountain went to uh the logos and the logos went to a body and the body went into his church and the church fell away and now it's restored back and now that's picking back up again we're headed for a new world I'm here to tell you you're not going to go down in the destruction of the fire that's going to destroy this world not you and not any of your loved ones that you've claimed in faith under the token I'm here to tell you I don't know how it'll happen but God cannot break his word he cannot break his promise Hallelujah see and so so we find then that that we are part of his godhead to participate in Recon ilation for the sins of the people and we're partners with Christ to finish redemption's claims to seek and to find that's our mission to seek and to find the last name that's on the book that through the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know through the baptism of the Holy Ghost according to John 20 you're even invested with power to to to uh forgive give and remit sin amen that's blasphemy I I'm only reading John 20 22 to 20 uh 22 to 23 that Jesus said he said he breathed on them and and and and potential the Holy Ghost he didn't come to the upper room he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost now whosoever sins you remit they are remitted amen now we know it that the Catholic took the mental understanding and put a a black robed man who needed converting himself in a booth and another unconverted and they they tell each other their faults and failures and somehow they're going to heaven well that's ridiculous because the man comes out with the same sin he went in only now all he's got to do is say the rosary so many times or a few good deeds and that's all he needs to worry about he's he's he has failed before he started started before he went into the booth he's already failed because the only way to get a new birth excuse me is saying Amen to every word somebody brother Luther in my bag uh the back of my black black bag is throat loses bring me one hurry run jump flip you back yet excuse me so devil ain't gonna it ain't going to work devil you're wasting your time if I have to just talk the rest of this sermon I'm going to so we find then that that the the Alpha and Omega of Revelation 118 he's the Alpha and the Omega he is moving in the Earth again today you believe it you got something for me yeah don't throw it bring it up here I'll miss Mom could one hand grab it but I'll miss oh I don't know if that's the one I want no that's oh man I'll want five of them if I eat that that's a worther now I'll wait on the good one I'll just go man bring me another one amen be nice fuel for preaching but we'd be here all day if I start eating wors so we find that he's walking again in the midst of his true church that's the ministry of the son of man and so we find that in Revelation 113 that he's operating through an obedient bride now that you we're not reading one we're not reading it right now but that's that's when you go home and read it that's what you're going to find in verse 13 that this Alpha and Omega is working he's alive working through an obedient bride who has GED about the paths with a golden girdle brother brandham said notice that that's an image of the Son of God in the form of his bride amen see so so so I'm I'm saying all this to make these points so then the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ that we see on display in verses 14 and 15 is now abiding verse 14 and 15 thank you sir he's now oh wow I can preach a while now he's now abiding may not need it he's now abiding uh in a voice of many Waters amen he's now that's verse 14 and 15 he's now he's a voice of many Waters it's this same Jesus Christ and he's got seven stars in his right hand to give Authority to the to the voice of the ministers oh Hallelujah there's my authority today friends I got a prophet a star in his right hand I don't have to guess at it I don't have to wonder can I get you home I already know I can if you'll just accept it see that's what say oh well I'm a king but but remember that your kingship is is only legitimized in your priesthood amen don't just go God's not going to invest a kingly Authority in you if you don't have any character so you say well how do I become a priest by surrendering your life and let Let Him Live his through you that's that's a priesthood that's where brother bradam said and I don't have it here he talks about how that you know if you something this simple now here's a real simple one you can't even stumble it'll do us all good to be reminded of it he said if something happens and somebody does you some way in the church and does you wrong and hurts your feelings and you go sit over in a corner and pout he said you're no priest because you're to bring forth spiritual Praises unto God you you should be more bulletproof than that you should not wear your feeling on your sleeve like that we're all in this thing together y'all we all have our ups and downs but we cover for one another we love one another Hallelujah see so so it's your priesthood are you willing to live your life so that your life in action in real time is a living a life of Living Sacrifice the the Christian Life brother brandham said is a life of self crucifixion and living for others you're certainly not living for others if you're if you're trying to get all you can and be all that you want to be and it's harming others around you including those you say you love the most right and yet your your refusal to be a real priest is hindering them you're not a priest at all you're selfish see so so again I will say that your Authority as kings is is legitimized by your priesthood see you can't get you can't get the that turned around because then you you run off trying to do something for God and you yourself need converted that was Calvin's problem he was you know they said to brother bradam you know Calvin you know why do you say you know brother brandham knew very much and and they said well Calvin did this and Calvin did that and historically you can't deny it and brother brandham said yeah said see Calvin needed converting himself I'd never I read his history have the courage to say that but a prophet knew that that life was a life that that operated in justification and sanctification but had never been born again of the Holy Spirit you see why Calvin couldn't be the messenger see so Luther had false Doctrine but he was born again Wesley didn't have all the correct teaching he taught a trinity doctrine of which is three unclean spirits like frogs the doctrine that I'm glad Wesley was in the sixth age but because if if brother Brandon would have been preaching that in the seventh age the Bible tells us in Revelation 16 that that Trinity Doctrine will lead people to Armageddon I ain't wanting to go there and so I'm not that the Trinity Doctrine will lead you to the mark of the beast that's right that's why my personal belief and this is just brother Jason I think that the unwise Virgin are are Oneness at least I don't I don't see how they could at least if they are Trinity trinitarian now the misunderstanding I think somehow in the in the tribulation God will get it to them and they'll they'll come clear to not they'll they'll it'll somehow to be exposed and because the Bible tells me that everyone shall worship the Beast whose name is not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb see so even the unwise Virgin have their names in The Book of Life but it's not that's not the what brother brandham called The Bride book you'll read you'll see it here in a minute amen see so so then we find that as I said as I said verse 14 and 15 have the voice of many Waters Christ working through his church verse 16 where you'll find when you go read it at home verse 16 brings back the razor sharp two-edged s sword in the mouth of the church that's how she's the final voice to the final age do you know why we're the final voice to the final age because under our Prophet who only taught what Paul taught amen and Paul describes his ministry and you can fairly conclude that Paul was the final voice to all the ages that his teaching could not be countermanded by anybody and everybody that came after him had to build on his foundation and he said be careful because no other Foundation can be laid than what I and on the Judgment Day God will judge the World by what I preached I'm glad a prophet said I only preach what Paul preached and millions and here we are today we're ready to join the millions and say we know that and we are resting on that Paul's teaching couldn't be countermanded even by God because he had gotten it from God and God can't change his mind about his word hallelujah oh my friends you see why that this that at the end of Leo sea there's a complete restoration now with that restoration ought to come that same fire amen don't forget that because I'm coming to that again I'm going to circle back to that so verse 16 of Revelation 1 I've told you that we're restored back to the Revelation One Church verse 16 brings back the razor her sharp two-edged sword in the mouth of his church who's the final voice to the final Age and and she is as it describes of Christ shining in its strength ready for a Rapture I don't know what the devil has badgered you with all week long but I'm here to tell you when God looks at you his word and his Bible about you is you're shining in your strength Hallelujah and the devil cannot stop that and that's why he hates it so bad amen so the time then of course we've also come to the time of the fullness of all the sevens so you have SE various sets of seven brother Brenham discusses it uh this is this is all for the completion of redemption the unfolding time uh of the seventh seal is for the Redemption of the Gentiles the seventh trumpet is to redeem Israel and then the pouring out of seven vials in its fullness which happens under the seventh seal uh because the seventh seal even when we're gone the seventh seal is still unwinding it unwinds all the way through the tribulation and it unwinds all the way through the Millennium because the millennium's still in time see and so the seventh seal everything ends up when the seventh seal is done we find that it's ready for a new heavens and a new Earth so when we're gone the seventh seal continues to unfold in judgments upon the unbelieving world through the seven vials so brother brandham says this oops see uh yeah that's what I want and now as we study this we are comparing it now the first three books of the Bible of Revelation which we have pretty thoroughly cover combed that in the church ages now catch this statement because it it augments what I just said the seven Church ages now there is seven Church ages Seven Seals seven trumpets and vials and unclean spirits like frogs this is all Revelation 16 and all this goes together amen so you understand that that as I've explained it to you before you know when when when he's in Europe and the sixth trumpet is now sounding and 200 million demon special Chargers are being released to go after the Jews to chase them back into the Homeland back across this side of the pond he's in a tree speaking to a small boy saying don't ever drink or smoke or defile your body cuz I got a work for you to do when you get older and he's working both sides at the same time oh you're part of something so unimaginable to the world and here you are friends and this is Elementary to us oh I feel so privileged today I never wanted to say Amen to the word more than I do right now Hallelujah see so when you know even even before that if you go back under the fifth trumpet before the sixth trumpet back before World War I and a star falls from heaven under the fifth trumpet and you find that it's brother brandom identifies that as Lucifer how are are fallen from the heaven Lucifer's son of the morning and he's given keys to the bottomless pit keys he hadn't had in his hand in 2,000 years and he's given a temporary power to open the the lid of hell and brother brandham says the lids been torn from hell and demon powers are streaming into the Earth because now he's got to bring on the first and second and third woe the world's never had to experience that she's never had global war she's had wars and rumors of wars and Nations shall rise against Nations but the end is not yet but when the woes begin and how are they going to begin because Satan comes down and takes the lid and demon powers and now everybody's ready for a global war you say oh my goodness what is God going to do about it right at that time in the turn of the 20th century right while that is happening it's already happened under the fifth trumpet and back across the pond in in in Los Angeles he's coming to ausa street because when the enemy comes in like a flood he'll raise up a standard I'm here to tell you no matter what happens to this world and it'll rock out there in the Judgment I'll be safe under the wings of Jehovah we'll be gathered around the throne Hallelujah don't think he hasn't got a plan don't think he already knows what's going to happen and all y say Lord bring the fire on whatever it takes I want what happened in that upper room I want it to permeate my life [Applause] life you understand you with me see so these these events conclude the the these seals and trumpets and vials and woes and they they literally conclude the age of man living in a fallen condition they they the seals and the trumpets and the vials are to to to to bring about Everlasting righteousness to seal the vision and prophecy to anoint the most holy and to usher in the millennial reign of Mr and Mrs Jesus Christ amen so I just want you to know today he's got it all in control amen this king and queen rain together in the Earth from a palacial grounds of a restored brother brandham called it a restored Garden of Eden now this all being true friends then we can identify ourselves in time I can place it with history I can overlay the fifth and sixth trumpet and I can point you to the turn of the 20th century prior to World War I I can point you to the the beating of War drums again in World War II we can see that the seventh seal was the unveiling of all the seals cuz they're wrapped up in Scrolls brother B say it's not like a book like this so the the the Christ had to do that because the church fell away remember where we read and instead of Jesus being able to come and get a bride he he must now sit down in the eternities intercede for ignorance for 2,000 years seal up the word in Seven Seals and then it can't it can't be unlocked into till the end time amen and so he takes the first seals like he's got seven it's seven Scrolls imagine seven pieces of paper stacked seven High one all right you've got you've got all this stacked here and so you you take the first one and you roll it up in a scroll and you put a tie and you seal it you lay it on the second one and you roll it up again and then you tie and seal that one then you lay it on the third one and roll it up again so the first one is rolled inside the second one and the second one's rolled inside the third one MH you follow me and that's the way he does it fourth fifth seal it up six seal it up seven seal it up so people who say the seventh seal is not open if it's not open none of them are because you can't get to any of them until you open the outer ones Hallelujah say what is it a a a a a big Treasure Trove of Doctrine no it's the unveiling of Christ the unveiling of the word like he was in Revelation one when the church was a a voice of many Waters when the church was full of power and believing when the church had the fire of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah see so it places Us in time it it it identifies ourselves in time it places Us in Prophecy it declares with authority that the time of the final voice to the final age has arrived and we go forward in this age and I want to tell you something what that fire of the Holy Ghost is sent to do you say oh it's going to make me the final voice to the final age what does that even mean I can tell you this it's not a cliche I can tell you what the final voice to the final age is in an age when the lid is torn from hell in an age where Satan's eating is here in an age where he's reached his Zenith and he's the God of this evil age a final voice of authority means that I can come in any situation and take every devil under my control for the glory of God come into our home speak to our children speak to our neighbors no matter what it is you have the authority of the word of God that's what the fire does that's what the Holy Ghost is given forl that's why you're a king you say well how do I how do I activate be a priest you won't have to activate it it activates itself but you got to be a priest just like just like Brother Brad was quoting and brother Caleb had quoted there are certain things God won't do you've got to be willing to be a priest and when you're a priest then the heaven comes behind you and now your word is a king Oh Glory to God what is your need today this isn't a charismatic meeting where I just nothing name it claim it nothing do it what what is your need today I find that my need is not a bigger house and a better car but I want to be an overcomer I want to be an overcomer I want to see this flesh put under the control of the holy spirit this is what the Holy Ghost is given for this is why he came to start a fire not a nefarious reason not an evil reason just like the SI the six trumpet demon powers released brings about a holocaust and brother Bram could actually call that the tender hand of Jehovah my wife and I talking about it this morning he literally allowed a demon Spirit to go down and deceive King Ahab because they're having a conference how can we trick him how can we bring Elijah words to pass because Elijah said he's got to be killed and he's got to die this a certain exact kind of death so what's the best way to do it you say I mean couldn't God just like already have the best idea yeah but it's just like Jesus standing there said the Harvest is ripe the labors are few pray to the Lord of the Harvest that he sent forth labors and brother M said he himself was the lord of the Harvest and he's saying to them I want to do this but I want you to be involved I want you to prayed to me I want you to ask me I want my family's involvement Hallelujah that's the Old Testament order there's nothing like a family all working together and pulling together and loving together and worshiping together Hallelujah friends that's what that's the kind of home the Holy Ghost can get behind amen amen amen yes sir so so we we we find that you know the the Lord's an evil spirit from from the Lord went to torment Saul Now brother BR said God don't put sickness on his children the devil does that so an evil spirit from the Lord just simply means like he did to to King Ahab he he permitted he authorized an evil spirit to go and torment Saul say why because Saul was in the way he was rejecting the word he would not accept David David had already been anointed king and Saul wouldn't have it and got mad and tried to kill him so God punished him was he lost no he was saved why because he was a Son of God and he took a weapon and it took his life but Isaiah I me but Samuel said tomorrow you'll be with me in Paradise amen see amen so we find that we can now identify ourselves in time I got to pause with this last set of quotes we can identify ourselves in time we can place ourselves in Prophecy we can declare with authority that this is the time of the final voice to the final age we can go forward taking every Spirit of this Dark Age under our control through the Holy Ghost brother brandham says it like this the Mighty God unveiled before us 1964 but now as ever the skin Veil is what catches the traditions amen they just can't believe that that is god making them people act like that see it's because here's why God is veiled in his church in skin skin on it 64 the Mighty God look at the title who's God he's going to unveil himself well when he did who was it his church you you're you're part of the Mighty God unveiled that the world thinks you're cult because they can't see it see so because God has veiled in his church in skin skin on it that's right he is hid from the unbeliever and revealed to the believer yes sir amen whoa thank you I don't know what happened there oh no devil a playing there Matt bring me back there's always an override button hey man you once you bring it back brother Mark uh uh go go back one let me make sure we had that one more one more keep it going don't read keep it going brother Mark keep going we'll go looking for 1964 right there um go back one more to the one we read there's the one we read all right he is hid from the unbeliever and revealed to the believer yes sir next same quote one one slide now when their tradition veil of traditions of the elders and the word is broke through oh of course today then comes in plain view we see him look at it with me deity again veiled in human flesh I love how he says that Hebrews 1 says so see he's he's he's loing back to the final voice of all the ages go home read Hebrews one you'll find that that's what he's saying now let's go to 65 and this is where we're finishing notice now then you are a son of God I want to give you this and we'll send you home or send you to the fellowship hall notice now then you are a son of God in the house of God you are a part of God's economy you love that Romans 81 there then there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus for they are dead to the world alive in him and living in his present in this present day making the word that God has used them or foreordained them placing their name there it is in this bride book that's see that's a different section of the Book of Life Next and when the Waters comes upon that seed that's in the heart raises it up to the bride of Christ oh my just perfect as it can be in every age it's been that way the Lutheran under justification the feet raised it like that Wesley under sanctification the Pentecostals under the arms the works and deeds and so forth had to be calvinist he corrects himself or had to be Armenian had to be legalist but now we come to the Head the Capstone Grace Grace the Capstone cried next The Headstone crying what Grace Grace pass from death and Creed into a Living Word of the Living God God's only provided plan for his age his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit off something to make it alive and seated now in Heavenly places in present tense already alive and subject to every promise in the word finally then what does that do looks like we might have one more what does that do you being a part of God's Gene a part of the word other men a part of God's word seated together manifested the entire body of Christ because there's I love that there's no leaven among you see what he's talking about brother Brown no leaven among you just the word only seated in Heavenly places not suggesting we don't have struggles and faults and failures but you have believed the report you have received the word of this hour and the word of this hour was not Doctrine or teaching it was a person and it's changed your life that's how I know it's not Doctrine it's changed your life legalism forces you to live a certain way I'm not forced at all to live this way I actually force myself to live this way cuz I love it and I don't want to live any other way no thanks oh you can go do whatever you want I already am I already am doing everything I want I love him he first loved me something came into my life and made that change friends what was it the fire that fell on Pentacles no l among on you just the word only seated in Heavenly places in the door where he puts his name Christ Jesus next got two more and then then we're done no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you couldn't do it in Luther's age couldn't do it in Wesley's age couldn't do it in Pentecostal age but in the day when the Sun of man will be manifested revealed brought back the church together with the entire deity of God amongst his people showing the same visible signs lastly manifesting himself like he did at the beginning when he manifested on Earth in the form of a prophet God Oh Glory promised by Malachi 4 promised by the rest of the scriptures when you where you worship at the House of God seated in present tense amen that's it brother martin seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus present tense not not I'm going there someday now I'm here now now there is therefore no condemnation amen we now we are called the sons of God see so now I am entitled to the same fire that fell in the upper room in every detail of scripture I have the right to say to the Lord Lord I want to come to verse 42 like they came to verse 42 and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and the fellowship and the breaking of bread I say
