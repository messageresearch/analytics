[2:56] [Music]
[3:08] so
[3:10] [Music]
[4:07] you can stand and we'll pray
[4:10] amen i'm going to be doing something a
[4:12] little different today
[4:13] brother jason and i
[4:15] talked about doing a regular missions
[4:18] update
[4:19] but kind of weaving it into some
[4:21] teaching about missions as well so
[4:23] i'm going to start that and we'll
[4:24] probably lord willing do it the first
[4:27] month of every quarter
[4:28] so let's pray
[4:30] father we come before you now and we're
[4:32] so thankful for your goodness
[4:35] lord
[4:36] for the blessing that you've placed upon
[4:38] us father
[4:39] we're so thankful for that regardless of
[4:41] the circumstances that we
[4:44] face in life the difficulties we know
[4:46] that your
[4:47] goodness goes with us your blessing goes
[4:50] with us lord
[4:51] because whatever we whatever we go
[4:52] through we're not subject to
[4:55] fate or to what the devil has programmed
[4:59] for us but we're we're only subject to
[5:01] what you have planned for us
[5:03] and what you have purpose for us lord
[5:05] and we ask for your for your wisdom
[5:08] to have your mind
[5:10] in everything lord i pray that your holy
[5:13] spirit would come lord and that you
[5:14] would be magnified and glorified
[5:17] in this missions report and teaching
[5:19] father we commit ourselves to you for
[5:21] your glory we ask in jesus name amen
[5:24] amen you can go ahead and be seated
[5:31] all right so
[5:32] it's been a while
[5:34] since i've done
[5:35] a missions report
[5:36] and i think my i never gave a report
[5:39] about my trip
[5:41] uh in september and i can barely
[5:43] remember it now
[5:45] covet erased some of my
[5:47] memory near-term memories
[5:49] for some reason but
[5:51] um
[5:52] i'm gonna do my best to give
[5:54] a slightly less detailed report than i
[5:57] would have if i'd given it in september
[5:59] so
[6:00] um
[6:01] when i was there before i spent a day
[6:04] with brother megaly emphasizing the
[6:07] importance of translation translating
[6:10] brother branham's sermons
[6:12] we've been working for several years now
[6:14] on
[6:15] the
[6:16] supernatural series and we're at book
[6:18] four
[6:19] and trying to light a fire under him oh
[6:21] it's all translated it just needs to be
[6:23] edited and then printed so we just
[6:26] uh book four
[6:28] has been sent to the printer and should
[6:31] be delivered to brother megaly i believe
[6:34] this week
[6:36] for distribution and he's been he's been
[6:38] faithfully doing that
[6:40] uh distributing all the first three
[6:42] books to people that he knows in the
[6:44] assemblies of god church and
[6:47] friends that he's encountered
[6:49] over time
[6:50] but we really wanted to get them going
[6:52] on translating
[6:54] brother branham's messages so
[6:58] we've
[6:59] we started i think since september uh he
[7:02] brother megaly has done it with his
[7:05] son
[7:06] george's help who's
[7:08] expert in english
[7:11] so they did the token christ is the
[7:13] mystery of god revealed
[7:15] and this day is this scripture fulfilled
[7:17] i think we're we're basically planning
[7:19] to
[7:20] you know translate probably
[7:23] 10 sermons and then try to get that in
[7:25] into one book
[7:27] for distribution so then kind of do it
[7:29] like that so we're continually getting
[7:31] you know a good amount of things printed
[7:34] at the same time try to get them in kind
[7:36] of hard cover to be more durable and
[7:39] last
[7:40] for a longer period of time
[7:42] amen so um
[7:45] it was early september that i went to
[7:48] egypt
[7:49] and
[7:50] it was
[7:52] a trip that was delayed by a day because
[7:54] i got the wrong covet test
[7:57] so um
[7:58] instead of being there for the first day
[8:00] of the meetings which there was a
[8:02] service at i think seven o'clock i got
[8:04] there a little bit after two a.m
[8:07] on that on that day so i left a day late
[8:10] but i was there for the days that we
[8:11] were have i was gonna have brother
[8:12] megaly take that first service anyways
[8:14] so
[8:15] i guess i just wasn't there to be to
[8:17] witness it uh be there with them but i
[8:19] got got in at 2 a.m and then we had two
[8:21] services on wednesday
[8:23] and two services on thursday and then we
[8:25] went back and then i went back to
[8:27] cairo to a hotel near the airport where
[8:30] that's where i met with brother megaly
[8:31] to talk about translations a lot
[8:34] so
[8:36] this is brother george so brother megaly
[8:39] is the pastor i'm working with there
[8:41] this is his son george his son george is
[8:44] in a school that everything is in
[8:46] english
[8:48] so
[8:49] first few times he translated for me a
[8:51] few years back i think he's probably 16
[8:53] years old
[8:54] and it was a little rough so every time
[8:56] i go i'm a little bit nervous about
[8:57] having him translate i was just blown
[9:00] away this time
[9:02] there's a brother who's
[9:03] his what he does for a living
[9:05] is translation
[9:07] he's a pentecostal
[9:09] uh evangelist
[9:11] and
[9:12] he actually
[9:14] we let brother the the pentecostal
[9:16] evangelist translated for me then we
[9:19] just kind of rotated it then brother
[9:20] george translated for me eventually that
[9:22] pentecostal evangelist just sat down and
[9:24] said i'm not
[9:26] translating for you anymore
[9:28] george is
[9:29] extreme
[9:31] extremely gifted at translating just let
[9:34] from now on just have him translate
[9:36] everything for you
[9:38] so i was blessed by that
[9:40] i think he probably has a future once
[9:41] he's done with school
[9:43] in translating the message
[9:45] so pray for brother george i think
[9:49] you know even in egypt the devil tries
[9:52] to work in the minds of young people
[9:54] so there's a lot of ups and downs for
[9:56] brother george but all in all the lord's
[9:58] really working in his life just can keep
[10:00] him in prayer
[10:03] and i think we had about a hundred
[10:05] people that came to the meetings
[10:08] this time
[10:09] and
[10:10] the lord really moved we um
[10:13] the people are super hungry they love
[10:16] teaching
[10:17] and so they're really rejoicing i think
[10:18] i if i remember correctly i spent
[10:21] uh three of the services speaking about
[10:24] predestination
[10:26] and
[10:28] there was one
[10:29] assemblies of god
[10:33] he had he was very proud of having his
[10:34] masters of divinity
[10:37] and he was a minister there in
[10:38] assemblies of god church and literally
[10:41] stood up in the middle of the service
[10:43] and started
[10:44] asking me questions and so at first i
[10:47] just listened to him
[10:49] and i said it's just a common question
[10:51] it's going to be answered by the sermon
[10:52] have us have your seat well he that made
[10:54] him angry so he started yelling at me
[10:58] and i just
[10:59] proceeded to preach over the top of him
[11:02] so then
[11:03] you know because i told him i was going
[11:04] to be answered he didn't think it was
[11:06] answered so the end of the service the
[11:07] holy spirit was just moving sweetly upon
[11:10] the people i was getting ready to turn
[11:12] it over to brother megaly to lead in
[11:14] worship and this guy gets up and starts
[11:16] yelling i'm literally
[11:18] making a invitation and
[11:21] you know having the people bow their
[11:22] heads the man stands up and starts
[11:24] yelling
[11:26] at me
[11:27] and so i just ignored him i continued to
[11:29] do what i do and then i bowed my head
[11:31] because i was in the middle of going to
[11:32] prayer so i bowed my head and began to
[11:34] pray he's still talking eventually
[11:36] he gets
[11:38] gets i get probably a minute into the
[11:39] prayer and eventually realizes
[11:42] i'm an idiot
[11:44] i'm yelling at this man and he's praying
[11:46] what am i doing so then he stops
[11:50] but then i just closed the service
[11:51] because it destroyed the spirit that was
[11:54] there and the man just needed to get out
[11:56] well anyways
[11:58] in egypt
[11:59] you can face a lot of troubles from
[12:01] people
[12:03] like that
[12:04] with immigration and many ministers have
[12:07] foreign ministers going into egypt have
[12:09] faced problems because
[12:11] something was preached that they didn't
[12:13] agree with or they didn't like
[12:15] and they go to immigration and you'll
[12:17] never wind up being back there so i was
[12:21] the lord's in control i can't i can't
[12:24] say that i was all that concerned
[12:26] um the lord the lord's in control if he
[12:28] doesn't want me to go to egypt again i'm
[12:30] really okay with that
[12:31] i serve at his pleasure
[12:34] if he wants me to go to wherever he
[12:35] wants me to go that's where i want to go
[12:37] otherwise i'll stay home
[12:39] i prefer that but that being said i was
[12:42] concerned that this was gonna call it
[12:44] short though
[12:46] i had peace in my heart about it brother
[12:47] megaly was very upset he came up to my
[12:50] room at the conference hall and talked
[12:52] for two or three hours about how upset
[12:54] he was and what we should do about it
[12:56] and i just said don't worry about it the
[12:57] lord's gonna take care of it
[13:00] god has a purpose in all of it it's
[13:01] frustrating that the man did that but
[13:03] he's like well can we have a question
[13:05] and answer session the next day i said
[13:07] why not
[13:08] let's do that after the service is over
[13:10] and we dismiss but let everybody know if
[13:12] you want to stay for questions and
[13:13] answers you're welcome to
[13:15] so
[13:16] i i continued to preach on
[13:18] predestination
[13:19] at the end of the service
[13:21] he he asked his question
[13:24] and
[13:26] surprisingly he was completely satisfied
[13:29] with the answer and then
[13:32] then i then i just made the statement
[13:34] just to teach and say
[13:36] you know
[13:38] i want to i want to ask a question of
[13:40] everyone
[13:41] is standing up and shaking your hand
[13:44] with an angry face is that how we show
[13:46] the love of christ to people
[13:49] just curious
[13:51] and the man immediately said
[13:53] forgive me
[13:54] forgive me
[13:55] i apologize i acted wrong i should not
[13:58] have done that
[13:59] so i was so thankful the lord worked
[14:01] that out but not only
[14:02] he not only worked that worked it out
[14:04] the man at the end said this was the
[14:06] best
[14:09] conference i've ever been to
[14:11] i can't wait to come back we want to
[14:12] come to your services this is what he
[14:14] told brother megaly so that's the man in
[14:16] the yellow there
[14:18] um
[14:19] so so thankful that the lord took that
[14:22] and turned that completely around
[14:26] a minister brother malek is on the right
[14:30] brother malik
[14:31] has i guess he's on your left excuse me
[14:34] he's uh has
[14:36] albinism
[14:38] but he's a he's a wonderful wonderful
[14:39] brother he had not come to any of the
[14:42] meetings for
[14:44] since the first meeting uh things
[14:47] things went awry between him and another
[14:49] minister and brother megaly
[14:51] and brother megali
[14:54] has always invited him to everything
[14:56] and this time he decided to come and
[14:58] he was just rejoicing
[15:00] and come to find out he's he he might
[15:02] have departed because he felt felt um
[15:06] he was deceived by another minister
[15:08] regarding brother megaly
[15:09] and coming back
[15:11] realizing that he's still
[15:13] following the message and and rejoicing
[15:15] in the word so thankful for that the
[15:17] other one next to me is the translator
[15:20] the pentecostal evangelist i was talking
[15:22] about brother
[15:23] ahmad
[15:25] good brother still in process of
[15:28] deciding whether he believes the message
[15:29] or not has great respect for brother
[15:31] branham as most pentecostals do
[15:34] but
[15:35] not totally sure about the teachings of
[15:37] the message so we pray for brother ahmad
[15:42] there eating
[15:43] eating our lunch at one of the during
[15:45] the conference
[15:48] and so this
[15:50] man the one
[15:52] closer to the screen his brother ahmad
[15:53] the one behind him i i didn't
[15:55] catch his name but
[15:57] for the last three or four services
[16:00] that we've had there meetings that we've
[16:02] had there when we've had the prayer line
[16:04] his wife has come forward asking for
[16:06] prayer for her husband
[16:10] she was
[16:12] he was always trying to stop her from
[16:13] going to the services
[16:15] and from what i could understand was
[16:18] not
[16:19] not treating her right and she was very
[16:21] burdened for him
[16:23] and for for the children
[16:25] and so every time she would come and
[16:26] pray this was the first time he actually
[16:28] came reluctantly came i think he came
[16:30] because there was a swimming pool and
[16:33] free food
[16:34] but
[16:36] he was in all the meetings
[16:38] and after the last service
[16:40] he came up to have me pray for him and
[16:43] he gave his heart to the lord
[16:45] so so so thankful for that sister she
[16:48] was so burdened and we've been praying
[16:49] for so long for her husband and god
[16:52] answers theirs
[16:56] so it's brother megaly on your left
[16:59] brother george on the right and then i
[17:01] think that's brother megaly's
[17:03] nephew who helps out with the audio
[17:06] visual
[17:07] there
[17:08] next to brother megaly
[17:10] this is a family
[17:12] that has been coming to church there for
[17:14] quite a while she
[17:16] she and her husband are always
[17:18] witnessing they um
[17:19] the book i wrote called foundations we
[17:22] had that translated and printed there
[17:24] and they
[17:25] people use it as an outreach tool they
[17:28] said they've been giving it out to
[17:29] everybody they possibly could
[17:31] on the streets witnessing to them about
[17:33] the message
[17:36] all right this is the
[17:38] mostly the whole group there
[17:42] that was it was at the last meetings not
[17:44] all of them attend brother megaly's
[17:45] church
[17:46] some of them were visitors people that
[17:48] he invited for outreach
[17:52] sitting out with brother megaly and late
[17:54] at night and
[17:56] eating sunflower seeds and having
[17:57] fellowship with all the people
[18:01] it's kind of the surrounding area around
[18:03] the conference
[18:04] this is in the
[18:05] it's inside of the nile delta that's why
[18:07] you see a little bit of grass there
[18:10] and palm trees
[18:14] a nice boat there for some reason have
[18:16] no idea why there's a boat in
[18:20] the now i guess it's in the nile delta
[18:21] so they must take it to the nile
[18:25] and there's crossing the nile to get
[18:27] back into cairo
[18:31] amen so
[18:34] brother branham
[18:36] speaking about
[18:38] the gospel
[18:39] and
[18:40] how the how the the god's purpose
[18:43] and god's plan for missions is not just
[18:46] in word only amen he said preach the
[18:49] gospel and the gospel is manifesting
[18:51] demonstrating the power of the holy
[18:53] spirit paul said the gospel come to us
[18:54] not through word only
[18:56] but through the manifestation and
[18:57] demonstrations of the holy spirit paul
[19:00] said i'd never come to you with great
[19:01] words of wisdom by some doctor of so
[19:03] forth but i come to you in power
[19:05] and demonstration of the holy spirit
[19:07] that your faith would not be in the
[19:08] wisdom or knowledge of the men of this
[19:10] world
[19:11] but in the power of the resurrection of
[19:13] jesus christ
[19:14] because he lives the same yesterday
[19:16] today and forever god help us to believe
[19:19] the same thing
[19:20] and god vindicate the same thing as he
[19:23] has been doing
[19:24] amen
[19:27] mark 16
[19:28] 15-18 again these are very familiar
[19:31] verses but it's foundational for
[19:33] missions and he said unto them go ye
[19:35] into all the world and preach the gospel
[19:37] to every creature
[19:39] amen he didn't just leave it at that as
[19:42] just words being spoken but it's
[19:44] something supernatural he that believeth
[19:46] and is baptized shall be saved but he
[19:47] that believeth not shall be damned and
[19:49] these signs
[19:51] shall follow them that believe the signs
[19:54] follow the word
[19:55] when the word is preached the
[19:56] supernatural follows
[19:58] in my name shall they cast out devils
[20:00] they shall speak with new tongues they
[20:01] shall take up serpents and if they drink
[20:04] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[20:06] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[20:08] they shall recover
[20:11] paul in first thessalonians 1 5 for our
[20:13] gospel came not unto you
[20:15] in word only but also in power
[20:18] and in the holy ghost and in much
[20:20] assurance as you know what manner of men
[20:23] we were
[20:24] among you for your sake so it not only
[20:27] it comes in power
[20:29] and the holy ghost and assurance god is
[20:31] in other words god is proving to their
[20:33] hearts that this is the absolute truth
[20:36] but then it's
[20:37] not only that
[20:39] he points to their lives the kind of
[20:42] men that they were so part of god
[20:45] proving his word amongst the people is
[20:47] the character of the people that are
[20:49] proclaiming it
[20:51] no paul never claimed to be perfect but
[20:53] he did claim to have a clear conscience
[20:56] right and he did claim and show show
[20:59] forth godly character and that's what
[21:01] needs to be in every uh
[21:04] every missionary
[21:05] you're representing what you're speaking
[21:07] about
[21:08] you're not just speaking about a product
[21:10] that you haven't tried yourself
[21:12] you're speaking about something that has
[21:15] changed your life
[21:16] and that that life needs to matter be
[21:18] manifested
[21:20] in front of the people
[21:24] first corinthians two two through five
[21:26] if i determine not to know anything
[21:28] among you saved jesus christ in him
[21:31] crucified and i was with you
[21:34] in weakness
[21:35] and in fear and in much trembling
[21:38] oh
[21:39] that doesn't sound like a very good
[21:41] message minister i was there in power
[21:44] and i was there in strength and i i
[21:46] had great charisma that's not what paul
[21:48] says
[21:50] i was with you in weakness
[21:53] perhaps he was
[21:54] a little sick you know had that eye
[21:57] problem
[21:59] and in fear and in much trembling my
[22:02] paul where's your faith
[22:06] where's your faith it's an action
[22:08] it's an action through many hardships
[22:10] trials difficulties paul kept going
[22:14] and my speech and my preaching was not
[22:16] with enticing words
[22:18] of man's wisdom
[22:20] but in demonstration of the spirit
[22:22] and of power the reality is if you
[22:25] look at the true gospel
[22:28] of jesus christ it's obviously
[22:30] contrary to human reasoning
[22:33] you're going to say that your god came
[22:34] and was crucified it's part of the
[22:36] reasons why the why the muslims preach
[22:39] and say that
[22:41] that christ was not crucified
[22:44] because they think it's such a shameful
[22:45] thing and it is a shameful thing
[22:47] so that's not the words of man's wisdom
[22:50] only reason why someone would believe
[22:52] such a crazy plot
[22:54] is
[22:55] the spirit of god comes
[22:58] and vindicates it and changes the
[23:00] person's heart
[23:03] it isn't enough that the spirit of god
[23:04] would just vindicate it because man
[23:06] would explain it away as magic or
[23:07] something
[23:09] that's not enough it takes the spirit
[23:11] working in the hearts of the people if
[23:13] you remember in the book of acts it said
[23:15] it said over and over again that the
[23:17] lord opened the people's hearts
[23:19] to hear what was being preached it takes
[23:22] god opening hearts
[23:25] amen
[23:27] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[23:29] of power that your faith should not
[23:31] stand in the wisdom of men but in the
[23:33] power of god amen
[23:37] matthew 28 19 i just look at that first
[23:39] part go ye
[23:41] therefore go means to traverse
[23:44] or to travel
[23:46] so
[23:47] get out of jerusalem
[23:49] go go into the samaria and and go into
[23:53] the coasts of the gentiles
[23:55] and
[23:56] teach all nations
[23:59] teach them to observe a part of the word
[24:02] no teach them to observe all things
[24:05] the full counsel isn't that what paul
[24:07] said i've not shunned to declare unto
[24:09] you the full counsel of god
[24:12] amen so
[24:14] that's our duty that's our duty as every
[24:17] christian is duty bound
[24:19] to to be a part
[24:21] of sending the gospel
[24:24] out to the nations
[24:27] so let's look at
[24:29] i'm gonna
[24:30] i'm coming close on time i'm just going
[24:32] to skip some of these and do this the
[24:34] next time
[24:41] brother branham
[24:42] and the sermon convinced and concerned
[24:44] he says i think we should be concerned i
[24:47] think we ought to support brother jose
[24:49] and any other missionary with all we've
[24:51] got
[24:52] the first thing we have to do is be
[24:53] convinced that jesus is coming
[24:56] this is his program we ought to be
[24:58] concerned about our brother whether he's
[25:00] black yellow brown or white we ought to
[25:02] be concerned about those people over
[25:04] there and if we cannot go
[25:06] we ought to dig down and do everything
[25:08] we can to support
[25:11] that god is those that god is called to
[25:13] go let us bow our heads
[25:15] and he begins to
[25:17] sing the songs millions now in sin shame
[25:19] are dying listen to their sad and bitter
[25:21] cry
[25:22] haste and brother hasten to their rescue
[25:24] quickly answer master
[25:26] here am i if you can't go
[25:29] send someone
[25:32] but it goes beyond just that it also
[25:34] goes
[25:35] into what paul talks about second
[25:37] corinthians 1 8-11 for we would not
[25:39] brethren have you ignorant of our
[25:40] trouble which came to us in asia
[25:43] that we were pressed out of measure
[25:44] above strength in so much that we
[25:46] despaired even of life
[25:48] but we had the sentence of death in
[25:50] ourselves that we should not trust in
[25:51] ourselves but in god which raises the
[25:54] dead who delivered us from so great at
[25:56] death and doth deliver in whom we trust
[25:59] that he will yet deliver us
[26:01] the next part here is what i'm
[26:02] emphasizing you also helping
[26:05] to gather by prayer for us that for the
[26:08] gift bestowed upon us by the means of
[26:11] many persons thanks may be given by many
[26:14] on our
[26:15] behalf
[26:17] the believer
[26:19] should support missions but more than
[26:21] that
[26:22] it should be on his heart to pray
[26:24] for missions
[26:27] ephesians 6 18-19 praying always with
[26:30] all prayer and supplication in the
[26:31] spirit and watching therein too
[26:33] with all perseverance and supplication
[26:36] for all saints
[26:37] and for me that utterance may be given
[26:40] unto me that i may open my mouth
[26:42] boldly to make known the mystery of
[26:46] the gospel
[26:47] amen
[26:49] those are the things that we need to be
[26:51] praying
[26:52] for missions in
[26:55] i just want to finish with a mission
[26:58] need
[26:59] that we have right now
[27:03] brother megaly currently is renting a
[27:07] church building i'm i'm going to say
[27:08] there's probably
[27:10] a dozen churches that rent
[27:13] this facility and it's spread out
[27:14] throughout the week so because of that
[27:16] they can't meet on sunday they meet on a
[27:19] thursday
[27:21] the church would really like to purchase
[27:24] a building
[27:25] it's a big project
[27:27] it's expensive it might take a long time
[27:30] to to to raise the funds but i'd really
[27:32] like to be able to
[27:33] help them purchase a building so they
[27:36] had could have their own place to
[27:37] worship this is a little new for me
[27:39] because i'm i'm used to working in
[27:41] turkey where it's just people are coming
[27:44] and going coming and going and you would
[27:45] never really want to buy
[27:47] a building per se because you'd be stuck
[27:49] people refugees might be moved from that
[27:51] city to another city
[27:53] so you just always stuck with renting
[27:55] but these people here are in egypt
[27:56] permanently
[27:59] and they live in the cairo area and i'd
[28:01] really like to be able to help them
[28:03] purchase a building as you see on there
[28:05] it's it's about 700 000 egyptian pounds
[28:09] to buy a building which translates into
[28:11] about 44 000
[28:13] in today's current exchange rate
[28:16] like i said it may take a long time to
[28:17] do it but i'd like to work towards
[28:19] saving that and being able to
[28:22] help them
[28:23] get their own church building and have a
[28:25] place to worship where they can meet on
[28:27] a regular basis wednesday nights sundays
[28:31] as they'd like to do so amen let's stand
[28:40] gracious father we come before you now
[28:42] lord and we just want to lift up and
[28:45] pray for
[28:46] those
[28:47] missionaries which are traveling in the
[28:49] world today lord
[28:51] i'm thinking of specifically brother
[28:55] luis orego and his family
[28:58] down in south america
[29:00] lord they've been gone a long time and i
[29:02] think they have
[29:03] a bit of time to go yet still lord i
[29:05] pray that you'd keep your hand of
[29:07] grace and protection upon them lord i
[29:10] pray you bless brother luis's ministry
[29:13] lord use him to bring many souls to the
[29:15] kingdom and
[29:16] to heal broken hearts and
[29:19] to deliver those who are in darkness
[29:21] father
[29:24] lord just go before each one of us lord
[29:26] move upon our hearts lead us
[29:28] guide us and direct us
[29:30] lord and what you'd have us to do in the
[29:32] direction you'd have us to go we want
[29:34] your glory and all things father we
[29:36] commit the service the worship to you
[29:39] lord i ask that you'd anoint each one of
[29:41] us today lord to accomplish the purpose
[29:44] you have through each one of us we ask
[29:47] these things in the name of our lord
[29:48] jesus christ
[29:49] amen
[29:51] god bless you
