lord happy to be here happy to have all of you here praise the lord we're going to invite you right to the scripture to matthew's gospel the 13th chapter matthew 13. amen praise the lord enjoyed the sunday school lesson uh that brother jd was that part 10 was that the final on that uh yeah okay still got some more on that huh okay we talked about maybe 10 would be it and so you got some more okay the real reason i'm saying that is because that the lesson has been so profound to me i have invited brother jason to take a couple of wednesdays in a row and take all of the parts condense it into two parts because i want the whole church and my fear is that not enough people heard it amen i appreciate all of those who attend the sunday school class and who if you're not attending or streaming and i do get reports that people even are driving to church streaming that's why it's important that we have our audio link working because uh it guarantees a better stream but i thought that it's um it's so relevant so time sensitive what brother jason has been speaking on concerning love that i think it's where we ought to be living i think it's crucial that we be living right there right now i think that we are facing challenges in the world today and you know something friends i appreciate gifts and i appreciate prophecies and dreams and and the lord certainly works in those ways he visits with angels he he does all kinds of things but i i love it when god can show me something in his word because there i have perfect faith if an angel appeared to me and told me something i'd still have to check it by the word amen if i had a vision if i had a dream i'd still have to check it by the word so i'd rather just cut to the chase and lord give me the word amen because there is where my faith is perfect you know the difference between human faith and perfect faith is human faith you have to exercise and try and make it work and work on it and and you have to involve some effort perfect faith isn't has anything to do with you it's god sovereignly coming down and enlightening it to your heart and i have a perfect faith in this book years ago when the lord saved me he gave me a perfect faith in this book and so i i have when i when i can see something in the word there's not enough devils in hell to take me away from it amen praise the lord so i i've asked brother jason to do that you can't do that a lot of times to preachers but teachers you can i've done that in the past i've i remember back in the day when brother lonnie was alive i would periodically call him say bililani i want you to come and teach us on a certain subject i've had other preachers other teachers do the same thing it's a little hard for a preacher to do that but teachers have a special gift that they can take a subject and i just think that that that is so relevant so timely and so powerful that i i just want it even if you've heard if you heard every one of his parts if you were to say i was here uh for every one of them then you're going to really enjoy when he recaps it again at the lord's leading brother jason i'll just leave that in your hands amen but i sure would like to have that praise the lord enjoyed all of that singing wow that song says to meredith goodness that's so i would be hard-pressed to describe how that blessed me amen and brother god bless you i so enjoyed your family what a beautiful family singing god bless you welcome you here today i don't recognize you do i do i haven't met you before what's your name brother simmons pray praise the lord brother that's maybe where i remember because you look familiar to me but um amen i enjoyed that that is wonderful amen i love to see families you know praying together singing together in church together amen there's something so divinely beautiful about that praise the lord all right matthew chapter 13 we want to just read these first nine verses and we'll let you be seated amen uh okay i might have to cater corner that a little bit so everybody can see it a little better um that looks like a deep subject don't it amen we're going to talk about the circle of life actually i'm going to preach today on living between two realities amen matthew chapter 13 verse 1. the same day went jesus out of the house and sat by the seaside and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore and he spake many things unto them in parables saying behold a sower went forth to sow and when he sowed some seeds fell by the wayside the fowls came and devoured them up some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and forthwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth and when the sun was up they were scorched they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked them but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some a hundred fold some sixty-fold and some thirty-fold who hath ears to hear let him hear amen we want to go to prayer this morning and we're gonna ask the lord's blessing upon speaker and hearer the word is already blessed but we need his anointing today amen so um you pray for me i'm a little bit uh was iffy whether i would be able to carry today brother jd was ready in the bullpen to take it uh i a couple of years ago i fell on the ice injured both shoulders got through that they were healed up nicely and a couple of months ago i re-aggravated the left shoulder well through various therapies and everything you know whenever pain starts moving that's generally a sign of healing and so uh it moved all right and it's moved up into my neck and so i'm having a lot of cramping like charlie horse in your neck if you can imagine that and it's been quite excruciating doc meredith has taken good care of me so don't worry i'm fine i've got some meds for it we're trusting the lord to get me through it amen so if i seem to be moving a little slow today that's on purpose amen um also we want to pray for brother blue sister sarah passed away early this morning so she of course sister sarah wonderful christian she's been in declining health for years we were praying she's been in the hospital over in charleston and she went home to be with the lord so asleep to us but awake to god but you know that's still a terrible loss so let's pray for brother blue for the children for the whole assembly um and that the lord will just bring the comfort that he promised he promised amen he's good at keeping his promises amen let's pray father we thank you this morning for your word thank you for these divinely revealed truths that come to us in this hour we're have great confidence in your word lord and i know that it is accomplishing even more than we can think or ask certainly more than we're aware of and so it is with that confidence that i approach the word today to give us a time where we can look into a fold of your word things you've inspired my heart i pray now lord that you will anoint the speaker and the hearer today we know your word is already anointed i pray lord that you'll be with me father and let your anointing be upon me once that happens it there's there's no pain at all can break through that so i'm looking for that father and i'm committing it to you now lord a sadness in our heart to think of brother blue lord our dear friend and the assembly there and the whole family and you and your sovereign divine wisdom have elected lord to carry sister sarah on home to her reward now it's a happy day for her but going to be sad for us and for the family so i pray master that you'll be a great comfort you promised you would and we know you keep your promises so i'm committing it now into your hands and may you bless us the remainder of this day in jesus name amen god bless you you can be seated amen praise the lord i think i'll start here now let me kind of caddy corner this if i can and that way everybody can get a fairly decent view of it amen y'all should be you see that good brother don good enough amen joy good enough okay praise the lord looks like a very simple concept but we're going to be uh speaking today on living between two realities now this of course is john 1. if you put that up brother josh john 1 and 1 up on the screen and just be ready to go back to matthew because we're really going to use the you're going to get a workout today brother josh praise the lord amen so jo uh saint john chapter 1 verse 1 of course in the beginning we realized that this is the beginning before the beginning in genesis amen genesis starts out with you know god creating the heavens and the earth but this beginning predates that in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god so this is the logos this is the form that god took as the pillar of fire and that was brother branham called that the first son of god now not a son like we would necessarily think in the english term because i have sons who are separate from me as a separate person this is not the the logos was not a separate person from god in that sense that in this case sonship is more of a title that he's now taking this is why brother branham would say there's no such thing as an eternal son because a son is a son comes from something so uh so god simply moves from that self-existing spirit that no man hath seen or can see he dwelt in in in light and this was before angels this was before stars this was before planets this was before there was anything brother branham even uses an astonishing um way to describe it he says that this was a time when god was not even exactly god now he wasn't denying that god was that eternal elohim that he was that great divine fountain back in eternities all he's simply meaning was that there was nothing to worship this being and so god in english means object of worship since there was nothing to worship him that english word god doesn't apply to to this until he creates angels and angels start worshiping now it's important that you realize that in this office the word he was the word the logos this is the first son of god because now brother branham says it like this he says i can see that little light starting to form something that could be seen interestingly enough at the time he did that there's no one to see it so if a tree falls in a forest and there's no one there to hear it does it actually make a sound all right we're not gonna get too deep into that today but at the time when he he's actually can be seen there's not yet anything to see and so he starts creating angels and they start worshiping him now he's he's moving into a manifestation now he's being worshiped so now he he was always that same being but now he's god see and so then when he then he moves that form into that pillar of fire and because he went from here to there and and so now there's an expression so that takes a designation son all right not like this father and this son this is a different human that was the same person only taking a different form he condescended you got it that's that's rudimentary to us and so we realized that it was in that form that he created heavens and earth according to john 1 according to ephesians the third chapter every there's not anything that was made that was not made by the word amen amen and the bible says in ephesians 3 all things were made by jesus christ see and yet genesis 1 1 says in the beginning god created so either the bible is lying the bible is the writers were confused or it's all the same person take your choice but for me i'm i'm i don't i don't have enough faith to believe if you believe he was three two or three different people then you got more faith than me because i can't read that in the scriptures amen so we realize that why did i draw it as a circle because a circle represents eternity so god never had a time that he started don't blow fuses trying to comprehend that he never had a time that he started and so to god there's no forwards or backwards in time to us it's linear to him it's not you understand even the uh brother jd what was that fancy word you used about god using language that we can understand what he said amen anthropomorphic amen that's what you get when you go to college you get all these words and so because god has to use those words because how are you going to describe a being like this you know even even solomon was bewildered how to build a temple he said who am i how am i going to build a temple that's going to house god when heaven is his throne and the earth is just a footstool i mean how you know who am i to think that god could be you know dwell in a house and so we realized that and i'm not trying to teach on the godhead today i'm trying to set a foundation for you to to give you to understand so this is why this is the realm god lives in all right now we find that that's why a child of god who is born again of the holy ghost can never backslide amen amen meaning lose your new birth now you very well could make a mistake thank god good news don't don't pass out good news the blood of jesus christ is already atoning for the mistake before you make it you understand it's already atoning it's already speaking brother brother branham said he doesn't even he doesn't even in one place he said he doesn't see you he sees your sacrifice he doesn't even hear your voice he hears when you are repenting this is what brother branham taught us when you're repenting from a broken heart by the holy ghost that's christ interceding using your voice and god hears the voice of christ that beautiful see when you when it's really coming from your heart and brother branham said you know the the blood speaks for me how can he condemn me when the blood is perpetually speaking for me so we know that we can make mistakes yes you can your prayer life can get slack your church attendance can get slack your fellowship can get slack you can get cold little carnal there's no more miserable a person than a christian carnal around the edges that's a horrible life don't live there friends it's not fun and so we're meant to be eagles we're meant to be soaring we're meant to be overcomers that's the promise why would you why would you not take advantage of the promise live above it amen and and you and and peter said that you can actually get to the point where you never fall brother branham used his words to describe it he said you go so far into christ satan can't find you wouldn't that be amazing so we realized that the reason that that uh that a born-again child of god can never fall out of that is because in your soul when you're born again of the spirit of god when that gene of god has come to life that is the new birth amen amen the gene of god come to life then then that soul has already passed from death to life it can never enter into the judgment it can never be indicted you can never be accused no god will not accept an accusation against a born-again child it doesn't matter how much video replay satan has it's all dismissed no there is now therefore no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus why because your soul is already in heavenly places with christ jesus brother branham said you're already on the other side of the chasm worshiping sitting with christ hallelujah see and what we're doing now is is that so now you're already living between two realities when you're born again you're living in two worlds because this guy is still here amen and now that that inner that inner life of christ is on the inside but it's already in that realm you've already got a gateway opened hallelujah that's why you can come boldly into the throne room of god the gateway is open to you you understand so so we find that that here there's no forwards there's no backwards there's no yesterday there's no tomorrow it's all right now so you can't backslide because in here there is no back so you can't backslide there is no back you're already in eternity amen so we realize then that what are we what is the what is the holy ghost the holy ghost is the spirit of adoption growing you perfecting you bringing you to a body change so that this guy matches all three layers of you sync up and live in this realm right now you're forced to live in two realities you're living between two worlds see you can be influenced by either one all right now brother branham did an interesting thing when he drew this he drew a little loop he called it a loop a little loop down he said his wife called it a hickey so you know it in my mind i wasn't there to see it but i imagine just a little loop i'm gonna i'm gonna kind of draw it up maybe a little different than what he described only because i want to emphasize a point he didn't emphasize until later he later he emphasized it but not at the time when he made the drawing so what i'm going to do is i'm going to draw your life like this brother branham said that what we have is a little drop down or a little loop down and what happens is and i drew it in red because this is the time of redemption when god's family comes out of this realm and drops down and lives in this realm and you're in time and you're born in sin and you and the but the blood of jesus christ is there for you a gene of god is already inside you amen all right you're still with me so this is the time of our lives now you you've got that all right now let let me let me make a couple of points all right 2020 presidential election is in here thank god it's not in here now bear in mind and here's the point i want to make that brother branham didn't make till later notice that the timelines are running together so you've got two realities that are still running this is still in operation just because the just because satan didn't sucker-punch god in genesis you understand eternity's still in business sister blue has already left this line and went to this line god amen amen sister seal has left this one she went to this one hallelujah this is why we say she's asleep to us because her body's buried down here but she's awake to god because her soul is there and she's already got a word body wow i'm not supposed to get excited today so we find that that you know all the chaos is down here all the burning cities are down here coveted 19 is down here don't worry it's not up here hallelujah so there's no election chaos in that circle there's no racial injustice up here that's all down here amen there's no women treated like doormats there's no child abuse there's no poverty there's no viruses there's no sickness there's no funerals hallelujah up here that's all down here in this little loop of time this round this realm has registries of life they keep them birth records they do census and count the people and and they have they build cemeteries and put people's names who used to live this this realm is filled with registry of former citizens and current citizens i'm here to tell you this realm also has a citizen registry and what you want to rejoice in today because you see the word for your hour which came from this realm it's not a creation of this realm this is where the reformers had to deal with but this but the message we have is what paul had and that came paul said i didn't get it from men i got it from this realm amen and because you see that that is an identification with you that this is your origin not this i'm here to tell you no matter how bad your life has been here or might be tomorrow here it don't matter because you got a life here coming your future is bright your future is secure i'm living between two realities right now but but well i'm going to tell you something friends what you want to do as a christian is lose this one and start living according to this one amen now all right watch let me carry on all right brother um josh let's go to we've already read down to verse 9 let's pick up to verse 10. we read verse 9 in john 1 i'm sorry i'm sorry josh in matthew 13 and we read one through nine so let's pick up matthew 13 verse verse 10 and verse 9 was who hath ears to hear let him hear all right verse 10 and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in parables so there's a reason for it amen god didn't jesus wasn't doing it there's nothing in the word that is redundant or pointless every word even every punctuation every iota every jot every tittle is important and for a reason see that's why brother branham said you should be able to see jesus christ in every verse and every line see and and i and i get sometimes people struggle with that because they read heinous acts of of of of stories in the bible and they read terrible things of genocide and and horrible acts of perversion and idolatry and say my goodness how is how is jesus in those verses because he never did any of those things that's right he didn't but you did and he took your guilt and gave you his innocence no matter what you read in here you should be able to read jesus christ in every line next time you read some heinous sin and you know in your mind that you are guilty of that just say thank god for jesus christ because i'm not guilty of that anymore he took that sin amen he took it literally brother branham god traded the innocent for the guilty gave up jesus to get you amen amen can you absorb that gave up the innocent jesus to get you and brother branham said and we're not just talking about metaphorically brother it was so valid a swap that he died for it and god even let it happen and left him at calvary and brother branham said god judged him a sinner who knew no sin who had never committed a sin but he became sin for you and i and brother brown says god judged him as a sinner and sent him to hell you know why so you you you you you you you you and me would never have to go there see how could a hell could hold you but it couldn't hold him the grave couldn't hold him so he says and he answered verse 11 he answered and said unto them here's why why do i speak in parables because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the circle amen amen all right it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them in the alternate reality it's not given to them so there's the first principle jesus speaks to everybody that claims the name of jesus remember in the church ages because the false church said they called themselves ecclesia and so because they claimed the name of jesus then he spoke to them and gave and and and they and now the requirements of that church were upon them and so they they didn't do theirselves a very good service by making that claim so the first point we want to make is that he speaks to everybody who claims the name of jesus but he speaks in parables to the non-elect amen amen he he gives a legitimate non-facetious totally legit opportunity for every man to save himself from destruction he's not an unjust god he provides a way jesus died at calvary for the sins of the whole world amen and anybody whosoever will can believe that i i you know people who argue against against election by they wouldn't argue against it if they understood its origin i mean it's not it's not a lottery it's not bias or prejudice this young man is my son by origin none of you other ones are that's not unfair to you it just is it just is it's not a question of fairness and so you know if if i said you know if i've got you know enough money to give my son the inheritance of my kingdom and because all of y'all love me too then i'm going to give all of y'all a place over there and give all y'all some millions in a mansion also he'll still be he'll still be royal family you understand so god's god doesn't want anybody to die he pleads with humanity why will you die why would you not come to me that you may have life so you're going to find out that people make choices and it's not god's fault and it's not my fault and it's not your fault all right the the bottom line is he speaks to all who claim his name but to non-elect he speaks in parables but to the elect he gives us understanding um hey josh can you get luke 10 21 real fast amen luke 10 21 in that hour jesus rejoiced in the spirit and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight all right so that's the nature of jesus all through the ages you'll find him operating that way he operated that way all the way back to the book of genesis he speaks things on in an unclear way because you got a seat belt on because not everybody is supposed to catch it now i'm not out of the bible i'm only telling you they asked him why do you do that and he gave him the answer because to you it's given to them it's not given see all right now watch so so then matthew back to matthew 13. all right matthew 13 all right i think verse 14 for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath i think that was verse 12 brother josh my my apologies now to verse 13. therefore speak i to them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of esias which saith hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes read it with me they have closed all right so now here comes his answer lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them so if they can hear from their heart and understand then conversion is there you understand so that's why brother branham said what is the new birth it's a revelation of jesus christ personally to you all right so whenever the heart can hear and understand the conversion is there and healing is there so with understanding comes all the blessings of the word of god so therefore god hid it from some for the purpose that they're not all going to receive it amen all right now watch all right matthew we read there in in uh verse 14 because of the prophecy of isaiah isis isaiah of course isaiah had laid out that when christ came isaiah prophesied this 700 years before it happened he prophesied that when christ come israel would be too blind to receive him so why is jesus speaking in parables he's helping bring to pass isaiah's words you got me in other words he's on the he's used he's his life is working out of the same playbook that was written in the circle amen there's a book of life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world that took place in the circle not in the loop down amen the loop down only was a manifestation of what had already been planned in the circle all right in the eternities and so we find then that he's that isaiah speaks under inspiration of god that when the messiah comes on on the scene israel will be too blind to catch it now all you have to do is go in your mind to revelation 3 17 josh revelation 3 17. all right you're going to see the exact same principle all right revelation 3 17 this is our age amen this is the age of the church of the last day because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked now if you think isaiah's feat was amazing that he could write something 700 years before it happened imagine this is written 2 000 years before it happened and yet we look around the world and we look at man-made church systems and we we read revelation 3 17 and go yep boy he hit that one on the money see because god has already spoken the condition of the end time and so he he already has spoken that the end time church would be blind and miserable and naked and wretched and that they would put him out amen and they did and they are amen so we find that that now now romans if you i'm not going to do it today but if you want to go home for a good follow-up study to today's lesson go home and read the 10th and the 11th chapter of the book of romans because you're going to find that paul separates the elected from the blinded from the self-damned three categories of people romans 10 deals with the self-damned who closed their own eyes out of rebellion if you if you go and you and you look at some of those principles in romans 10 you're going to find constantly that paul talks about what happened to those jews back there under moses they were rebellious and they didn't want to believe the word of god and when jesus came on the scene and we find that paul is trying to show how that the true israel's not lost he's trying to get it across to the gentile churches to say you're elect he's taught them you're electing christ before the foundation of the world but don't discount true israel because they're elected also but they were and he deals with this in romans 11 they were blinded so you could come in but we find them in the fifth seal that all through the seven church ages all seven contiguous and continuous ages that they were given white robes not because of the testimony of jesus christ they weren't they didn't have that but they were given white robes for the testimony they held amen so paul in romans 10 deals with those jesus met them and i think in john chapter 8 when they challenged him on their genealogy and they had i mean you think you think you can do a dna swab today and get a genealogy these guys had family records that went all the way back to abraham and could prove and when they said we were abraham's children jesus didn't even argue that in fact as he agreed he said i know you're abraham's children but you tried to kill me and abraham didn't do that so i get that your your lineage is back there and now paul is in romans 10 explaining to the church listen you got to face the facts that not only you know there's israelites that just did not want to follow god just like there's christians today the bible says not all israel's israel he would say in another place just like not all christians are christians what determines what determines a true israelite what determines it with 144 000 it's those who believe the word of their hour what determines it for a real christian those who believe the word of their hour why how does that work because that's how they get a new birth and it's evidence when you have passed from death into life by the word of your hour you're already living in in this realm yes but in that realm also amen and so so paul separates very clearly this is done paul does this on purpose to clear god of any impropriety or double dealing or injustice you cannot when you go read romans 10 and 11 there's no way to come away blaming god impossible not if you read the bible because he talks about how that they made these choices of their own volition they that god didn't force them to do it it wasn't a setup it wasn't a sting it wasn't entrapment god gave them a legitimate chance they wouldn't take it they didn't want it all right we're going to show you some more of that in the modern day all right so so this is the principle so what is paul talking about in the old testament you're seeing the principle you're seeing the old testament version of strong delusion we have a new testament application of that that was prophesied that when people make a choice remember paul said the talking about the ancient people that when they knew god they actually knew him they actually knew who he was and they knew what was the truth they on purpose chose not to worship him as god remember that made of him four-footed creatures and winged creatures and reptiles and birds they did that god didn't trick him into doing that they wanted to do that they didn't want i say it all time people don't want a real they'd rather have a denomination because a denomination is just a you know a guideline of how you live and what we do and when we come to church and what we do but but a christianity is a living experience and people don't want a living god because then they're responsible that's why they built idols because they didn't want to acknowledge that god was real and alive because when you acknowledge as soon as you acknowledge that then you you acknowledge an obligation to that god and that's what they didn't want to do they didn't want to have that they wanted to be able to make their own choices see and so we find then that you see it all the way back the spirit of adultery i'm sorry the spirit of idolatry uh self-determination uh oh that was on operated in israel even back through the old testament you see it all the way back to cain you see it all the way back to cain now i'll just give you a fair warning today there's some i looked across my notes to the finish and i realized some of the things i'm going to say might be a repeating from a previous sermon but i'm anointed of the holy spirit to repeat them again and expand on them so that i'll be all right all right so so we find that it goes all the way back to cain now i want you to look at the situation real close today with cain so cain didn't care that he had killed his brother even when he's confronted by god he doesn't care he doesn't even try to repent for it in fact as he tries to lie his way out of it you understand so he he didn't care at all and and so if you'll notice what cain cared about is he he complained that that my burden is greater than i can bear because i've chose to live my own life without you telling me what to do but if somebody meets me they'll kill me and i'm not gonna get i'm not gonna i'm getting the sword into the stick so gee if if i'm gonna choose my own way the least you could do is keep me from getting killed so that i can enjoy my life without your interference that i've chosen and so god said fine so god put a mark on him and said to the earth anybody that sees that mark and kills him then you'll be under my judgment so cain you understand cain didn't care he he he only worried that he wouldn't get to enjoy the life he had chosen which was free of god's oversight and limitations and the world is exactly the same today and so god is justified he's only giving them what they chose in every age you cannot impugn god's justice or righteousness that israel tried to say that they tried to accuse him of inequity and he wakes a prophet up and says take this down and go tell them i said it said go and say to them thus saith the lord you say i'm unfair you say i'm unequal i'm telling you you're the ones who are unequal you're the don't think i don't see you in your secret places sinning from the desires of your heart say well but good grief they didn't even have the holy ghost it's unfair david didn't have the holy ghost but david said i've hid his word in my heart i keep it before i tied it to my bed i don't want to sin against him it worried david that he did sin against him and he's always repenting see so there's no excuse there david said i love the law of god see david never saw it as limitations david saw god's word as protection and mercy and judgment he never saw it as god limiting him in his life amen now let's bring up my powerpoint brother josh and i don't let's see is this my little thingy down here no that's not it oh here we go all right so i want to i want to show you brother brandon bring this right into the modern day you good all right amen as soon as you're up then i'll turn it on here if you don't get it i'll just read it yeah all right if you if you get it and you catch up to oh you think you got it kev okay awesome you guys are amazing all right living between two realities let me power up here all right a voice from another world now watch so brother branham says here uh in the falling apart of the world this is 1962 prior to the seals america what do you want what's your opinion america you've been crying for a messiah i know that this is taped you've been crying for a messiah what do you want see well you got what you wanted you wanted a politician you got it this is right after kennedy was elected see and and he says you got it now what are you going to do with it going to skin you that's exactly what it's going to do going to send you to your grave you wanted it you got your desire what are you going to do with it it's on your hands now modern ahab and jezebel see he called he called that jezebel system that was behind kennedy catholicism see we were talking uh i was in a minister's chat just yesterday seemed like somebody here in the church but um we we were talking about the the makeup of the supreme court of the united states it's almost entirely catholic like there's maybe one or two jews and the others are all catholic and that that if you go back a hundred years just a hundred years that's unheard of in american history they had back back in the day they had what they called the catholic seat they always wanted to have at least one catholic one on you know from from the from about the mid-1800s and so but that's all it ever was it was almost just like a little pat on the head okay we'll give you guys one seat at the table it is unheard of historically for this country that now catholics dominate our supreme court and now set in the white house and hold a majority in our congress in both chambers that's not an accident don't think that's happenstance that's not an accident that's god listen i was i was saying to you earlier that jesus was helping the prophecy remember i told you some weeks ago maybe in a sunday school class i don't remember that when god puts prophecy it's not just god by his foreknowledge he looks down the chain of time sees what's going to happen and has somebody write it in a book so that when it comes to pass it makes god look good that's not it god determines in his mind what history is going to be before its history and then he manipulates they politicians think they're in control kings monarchs prime ministers presidents they think they're in control they're not in control the circle is in control the kingdom of heaven is in control you need to remember that don't worry about what's happening in this world the eternal realms of heaven are in control i'm not subject as brother abraham says we're not we don't live by the mercies of lucifer we live by the mercies of jesus christ you need to put the devil in his place and just let him know i don't live by your mercies i'm not subject to you i'm i'm connected to almighty god watch so he says what you're going to do with it it's on your hands now modern ahab and jezebel the very thing that you run here for freedom you pulled yourself right back into it again but that's what you wanted you wanted some flat top ricky modern elvis of the day you got it you wanted a smart educated politician with a genius brain you got it how did you do it you don't want god's messiah the anointed word the word made manifest the word bringing itself forward you don't want that god sent it to you but the church don't want that they want their creed they want a genius that can fix creeds to where everything bounced to it you'll get it uh-huh it's on its road you got a lot of children to it but there's going to be a grandpa raise up one of these days of pharaoh who doesn't know joseph say something friends we were remarking i was remarking in a minister's chat two two big headlines that have hit one came out of israel and israel one of their leading voices in israel they were asking him about the vaccine coming and said are you going to force israelis to take the vaccine he said well we're not it's not exactly like we're going to force you to take it and i'm not here for khan i'm not pro or con the vaccine that's not my sermon today i'm just saying this is this is modern events made clear in prophecy and he says it's not like we're going to force you to do it but we we may make it so that where you can't buy sell or trade unless you have it amen amen and then the very same day or maybe the next morning this is even a bigger headline francis the pope of rome has now entered into a consortium into a deal into a into a group effort with big wall street businesses big blue chip companies they've got plans for 2021 and doesn't the bible say that rome will rule through commerce and through trade and through craft listen friends i'm here to tell you that's not the devil gaining ground that's god moving his puppet hallelujah god is moving his puppet i'm here to tell you that same god is perfecting you that same god is keeping your mind clear and keeping the insanity out of your homes oh we ought to rejoice and praise god for that i'm glad he's in control of these things watch he goes on and that's what you wanted see that's what paul dealt with in in romans 10. look this is what israeli don't thank god some evil ogre for condemning them that's what they wanted when jesus confronted them in john 8 and he said you're trying to kill me you're of your father the devil that's what they wanted they even conspired when they couldn't deny his miracles they couldn't deny him and and they said so who's authority he said who's authority to preach do do do cast out devils and we think you do it by beelzebub and jesus with his sense of humor says that's interesting okay so if i cast out satan by beelzebub exactly who is it your sons cast him out by because his sons their sons weren't casting out any devils so the whole thing was like uh who was that excuse me you want to tell me that miracle they just did what was that i can't hear you and when they say oh by whose authorities do you do it he said well i'll i'll answer that if you answer me john's ministry was he of god or no simple question you'd think anybody could just go well it's a or b a curtain one or two it's a simple question it's pretty straightforward he's not ambiguous he's not double speaking this is just a simple question john was a well-known ministry is it of god or no yes or no and they have to huddle come here boys okay here's a problem if we say no we're probably gonna get killed because all the people think he was but if we say yes he was of god then he's gonna ask us then why didn't you believe what he said about me so they come back with a great answer we don't know we can't tell he said fine neither tell iu by what authority i cast out devils go on with your bad self go on that's what you wanted that's what a prophet is here doing go ahead america it's what you wanted you didn't want god you didn't want god man flesh you didn't want a prophet you didn't want to you didn't want to observe the life of god's family and pattern yourself after that you wanted a man with a genius brain somebody who could fix up your politics and make everybody else follow you you got it go ahead you know you know why cities are burning because of that amen because of that and that's what you wanted that's what the church you can see the very way they're doing yes sir the very way revelation 17 explains it of the old and her daughters exactly and it'll all go back home to mama and it's on its road right now to make one universal church you're going to get just exactly denominations what you want hear me it'll come to pass and i may be gone by that time but those who won't accept that when the evening light begins to fall and go out they look around they they see they're forced into something by their denomination and their denomination has took it to save their faces which they'll all do it they'll all do it now he comes after the seals watch this he comes here um in in november 1963 he's on the same subject the world is again falling apart and so does the word of god you can't take a church and bring it to life on some tradition you might bring members by the millions but you'll never bring down the power of god until we get back to the original word back to the foundational word back to the blood back to jesus christ back to old-fashioned prayer meetings back to god so what do you want bethel tabernacle do you want to grow this church into the millions or would you rather have the power of god hallelujah i make my choice today let the world hear it i choose the word i choose god i'm not interested in numbers i'm interested in the holy spirit i want to see it anoint marriages and anoint homes and anoint teenagers and anoint the old and raise up the dead and heal the sick and i want to see the power of god keep my mind sane in an insane world make your choice because you can but anyhow he says we may be so far gone now that the hours far past but anyhow the gospel must be preached we're not to judge that see we just keep preaching it till he comes god knew what they had need of so he gave them what they had need of so again we find what they had we have done the same thing russia and all the rest of them wants theirs and the different scientists wants to make themselves a great name enoch each nation wants to get its brainy man we want ours we want the educational system in it we want a denominationalism that's just exactly what we got that's what you did that's what you wanted that's what god gave you now what are you going to do with it after you got it ask yourself a question say i i i want to have a certain education okay god gave to you now what are you doing with it i want to have a certain career okay god bless you in it now what are you doing with it i wanted to have a certain stature okay god gave it to you gives you the desire of your heart now what are you doing with it come on friends come on you know what you don't owe me an answer i'm i'm god's emissary today i'm asking you on behalf of him what are you doing with it hey man what are you what are your plans what do you plan to do with it see i can tell you this you got two choices plan your life according to the third exodus when we get out of here or plan your life to stay here after we get out of here those are your two choices we're talking he says uh we're talking about russia for another minute the russians are calling for a man who can conquer space they're training them as fast they can they're scientists what if they get one what if they get their messiah what we gonna do and mercy on us if they get it remember germany got such a messiah not long ago not not very long ago a hitler and we we know what it done to them amen now what about the church what kind of messiah is the church looking for today what kind of church do we want what kind of don't read ahead of me what kind of church do we want here in bethel tabernacle do we want a church that's formal and fancy and powerless and cold proper but cold i don't want that kind of church i don't want to be that kind of christian i don't want that among you i don't want that among me and the only way to escape that is to give our whole hearts and minds unreservedly to the word of this hour and so that the holy spirit can anoint that word in you that's the only way it's it's it's it's it's what it's the magical force it's an anointing that comes down upon the word to make it live see it moves between us and it'll anoint good or bad it'll anoint the dark side or it'll anoint the sight of light it anoints everything and you've got to decide what what am i feeding on what am i putting in my soul for the word the anointing to fall on come on friends this ain't rocket science how to be an overcomer feed on the word of god feed on god feed on fellowship feed on church feed on prayer you know here's an interesting question that i don't want anyone to answer me but i just want you to answer it within yourself this is on behalf of the lord who told me to ask you this question when is the last time you actually sat down and played an entire tape and listened to it i'm not talking about laying under a car turning a wrench listening to it in the background i'm talking about sit down and listen to it or even or even driving alone in your car when it's just you what's playing young people on your radio what's playing now i i i i know i might lock you up with this but i'm under obligation lord wanted me to ask you that how many tapes do you listen to do you realize that the voice on those tapes is the seed that the anointing can fall on to make it live in your life and give you overcoming power do you realize that that voice on that tape is what can give you peace in a time of trouble and when you feel cold and you feel depressed and you feel lonely and you feel this and you feel that i would give you advice you call me up i'll give you the same advice brother jason i feel depressed i feel cold i feel alone i feel lonely i feel at the end of myself i don't know what to do i'm so depressed i'm so this i'm so oppressed you know what i would say to you go on a quiet place and turn on a tape i want to tell you something friends there is something about even the voice of that prophet that is just yes there is another reality and i'm a part of it yes that voice i lord i'll and before you know it your hands will be up in the air tears will be coming down your face and you'll be saying lord i love your life i love your world i love your word i love your presence come into my life forgive me for this forgive me for that take this out of my life take that out of my life it's the closest thing to magic it's the true form of magic come on friends god why do you it's what god sent you to get you ready for a body change amen all right your majesty i said it all right let me move on what kind of messiah is the church looking for you the church has cried the loudest so what are we hollering about a messiah what are we hollering revival in our time back to this that and the other what are they looking for to do it what more do you want what does the church want anyhow sometimes i've had to look in my and the man in the mirror when he was just got too bellyaching when the man in the mirror gets on my nerves too hard i finally look at him in the mirror and hold this up and go what do you want what more can he do get over yourself come on friends have you ever considered the problem might be within you and it might not be your spouse's fault or your preacher's fault or your parents fault or the or or the president's fault it might be within you i'm here to tell you there's a power that can come down into your life and clean out your heart and clean out your mind hallelujah oh my i'm out of time let me try to finish revive okay what are we looking for what what what more do you want what does the church want anyhow we've already got it god gave it to us it's his promise for this hour we look in the bible we see it everywhere through the bible anointed ones come on and and made the word live again right in the hour for that hour and we've got the messiah this is him the word in the beginning was the word it it blows my mind that people try to assert that william branham led people to himself that is the dumbest thing if you ever knew anything about message here's what he led you to his entire ministry it is a flat bald-faced lie with malice they intend to deceive by that he always led people to the word he never led people to himself the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word remains god hebrews 13 8 the same yesterday today and forever we know what is supposed to take place in this day we're wanting a messiah and god gave us the messiah his promised word for this day it's just waiting here you go it's just waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and make it live again yes sir it's a real messiah it's the words of god which jesus said both heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away but the church sits spiritually dead gone the hours past them they're in a slump they hardly know what to do one running this way and one that way and ever hear every promise that god made in the bible every one of them is laying there just as good as they ever was can you believe that can you believe that every promise no matter how many thousands of years old it might be it's just as good today as it was when it was written amen every one of them as good as they ever was it's the hour what makes the church like this we're in the age of laodicea when she has to come this way this is the hour for it amen that's what god knew would happen in this life i'm gonna tell you something friends i i find myself living in a completely different realm i'm living in another reality i hear i'm i hear the sound of a different voice i hear the sound of a different i'm not i'm not following the pied piper of laodicea leading the rats to slaughter i'm following the voice of a screaming eagle hallelujah how many here today have heard that voice and say that's the voice i want to lead my life by that's the voice i want i'm going to stop because i feel i can i don't i don't want to press on i'll save it i don't want you to lose that reality friends we are living in between two realities and you're going to be here until you're not amen and the beautiful this was only to accomplish redemption this was only to get god's family so that he could send them in through sin and then bring them back see it's in red it's in redemption everything else in life just remember whatever trouble you're in down here could you please remember that this one is still in full steam this one is still running it's just above you it has everything you need all you have to do is reach up why don't you just reach up your hand into that realm and say lord let me raise up my antennas and connect into that realm i need some peace that passes understanding i need a revival in my soul i need my children anointed i need my family and i need my house anointed the beautiful part can i give you a beautiful part friends when this thing is over you notice i do it right there on purpose because when it's all over we're only going up from there hallelujah stand up to your feet you anointed people you people of the eternal realm raise up those eagle wings to god and say i i'm connecting lord i'm connecting to a to another reality i hear a different voice from the world i long for that word i long for that god in my life not a man-made thing i want god in my life as the musicians come bow your heads with me father oh father we love you

put you on the rocks and sink your ship drown you beneath the depths don't listen to it if you have been stop listening to it raise your up raise your antennas up into that realm just above you and say lord let me connect to your frequency today let me hear the voice that comes from above let me hear that eternal voice let me hear the promise of your word being brought to pass in my life i want to live lord i while i'm here i'm i'm stuck between these two realms but i'm trying to get home you've sent me a homing beacon you've sent me the holy ghost you've sent me a gene you've sent me the word [Music] and i intend to follow it lord i want to say today master i'm aware that the world in mass has chosen their own way the world in an overwhelming majority has rejected you put you out of

married or single male or female maybe today you'd be here today and you'd say but jason the truth is i've heard about this my whole life for many years but i've never really i've never really experienced what it means to live in the realm of eternity and i want i want the desires of my whole heart changed i want my whole life and mind changed now to the word all heads bowed even my head bowed nobody looking around if you just want to raise up a hand to god and say lord remember me a sinner today have mercy on my life maybe you'd be here today and you'd say brother jason i i've been a believer of this truth for years and i'm a believer of it today and i'm not a fake i really believe it i believe it for real i know it's true but i'm also aware that my life ain't anywhere where it needs to be and i haven't felt the anointing of the holy spirit like he promised in a long time and i want the lord to remember me maybe you'd raise up a hand today god sees it friends god sees it maybe you're here today you say brother jason i'm a firm believer living in the eternal realms but i always want more of god now how about you raise up that hand and say i want more of god lord i want more of you in my life that should cover everybody today i did it that way on purpose so that nobody could say you left me out i didn't leave anybody out i gave you an opportunity today to know him for the first time or to know him in a renewed way or to know him in a greater way so i'm gonna pray for you now with all your heads still bowed master whatever hands went up thou knowest lord even if hands didn't go up no doubt hearts reached up to you sometimes people can get so caught lord in the complexes of life they hardly can get a hand up but yet their heart can cry out maybe someone is calling out to you right now saying lord here i am under the pile of all this flesh and i'm calling for help i'm sorry for my life i'm sorry that i've i've been an underachiever in your kingdom but i'm crying out to you from underneath all this flesh help me lift me up above the shadows lord bring renewal bring revival into my heart bring revival into my home bring revival into our church grant it lord let there be a great awakening a fresh surge of the holy spirit we're desiring that lord we're desiring that as a church we had communion a wednesday ago we had a special speaker for our weekend it was the desire of my heart that everybody would would come and hear the minister not everybody did i'm hoping maybe they heard it by an archive or went on and was live streaming i don't know lord they're without excuse because technology sure was there to provide a way but lord i did it in my heart as a purpose because i want to see i don't want to wait till next year to get a revival and a fresh purpose i want to see lord this cove sickness has taken something from us as a church and i want to see revival break back into the hearts lord we can't make that happen the
