[Applause] [Music] Lord [Music] surrender to the king [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] man you may be seated amen sister Chastity created a Christmas presentation that we would like to play for you at this time amen so foreign [Music] about a baby he wasn't just any baby this one's so so good look at this one in the beginning God made everything he made humans sound like Chris it will get there God would visit humans every day and they talked to each other face to face wait really no point to some invisible being in the sky yeah did you know we were made to be his friend oh what happened the first man and woman sin and we were separated from having that relationship with God that's why Jesus had to come God sent a baby to fix this paper the book explains for the first man and his wife then there was no death or sickness God had to warned them the penalty for disobeying would be death but instead of Killing Them instantly God required an animal sacrifice this was a symbol but it didn't take really take away the people's sins it just said they were very sorry foreign guys just kill them God loves her so much he didn't want to do that he also couldn't break his law the man and woman had children grandchildren and great-grandchildren despite their best intentions they continued to sin they did they were now born with the desires of sin God sent special men called prophets who did many miracles to teach his chosen people how to please him but because of sin the people always failed what kinds of Miracles God sent a great flood but saved one family with an ark he said please and separated a sea for his people to walk foreign God told the prophet that he would send a savior from the whole world his first would be another great miracle and God would be the father so God got married no he he made the baby just like he had made a grown man before first god Set an angel to tell a girl named Mary that she would have God's son the angel said With God all things are possible but Mary was engaged and Joseph doubted she had met an angel I'll talk to an angel have you no but that would be awesome God doesn't just use angels he said there was just a dream I already went to her cousin Elizabeth's house Elizabeth was very old she had never had children before God gave her a baby um but it did not move like he was supposed to when Mary told Elizabeth she was having Jesus Elizabeth's baby finally kicked when Mary returned home she and Joseph were made then they had to go on a long journey the ruler said everyone had to go home to be counted when they finally reached Bethlehem the city was crowded I'm sorry this is all I have you can sleep in my savings for as long as you need the only place that had room for them was a stable where they kept the animals even though it didn't look like much something special would happen God's son would be born right there wait a minute God made everything instead of his son being born in a castle it was more in a stable yep because God made became human for everyone not just the rich foreign what was that Angels announced Jesus was born they told Shepherds in a field that the savior Christ the lord was a newborn baby God doesn't mean money or Jewels but he will always have worshipers [Music] I still don't get it God had a son what does that have to do with Adam and Eve and all this in it as God said Jesus was special he never sinned later he died for everyone's sins and rose from the dead because Jesus came we became we can be friends with gargan we're better than friends we can ask Jesus into our hearts we've become God's family just like Jesus wow I didn't know that it meant for Jesus to be God's son yeah and the best part is that we are God's children too if your parents love you and give you nice gifts then God has even better gifts for his kids thank you so much can you can you teach me how to ask Jesus in my heart no we can't sure I wonder tonight in this building on this Christmas time in commemoration of nearly 2 000 years ago when God gave the first Christmas gift I wanted to know if you'd like to look on inside that package and see Center that there isn't somebody in there who loves you somebody who died for you somebody gave their life for you would you be willing tonight to take the swaden's cloth off of him that dirty cloth that they call him fanatic Holy Roller wrap yourself in it and take the way with the Lord's this past few if you're in the building tonight like to be remembered in prayer would you just raise your hand say on this Christmas night I want to receive the Christmas gift of God lord I'll take the way I'll never see you set with 30 feet either I'll never stand I'll join up with them I'll come right in the kingdom of God oh I'll be one of them that's despised abide with me Lord come go home with me tonight I'll wash away all the dirt from your name you wash away my sins Lord [Music] let me live the life not the way I'm doing now dirty yours I I'm dirtying you every day putting more upon you go tonight Lord and with my tears of repentance to receive you as my savior amen we appreciate our sister for putting that together for us amen let's give her a handyman this morning amen amen let's get your sister say right hand man [Applause] Jason was preaching last Sunday he was talking about bringing petitions before the king foreign [Music] [Music] one day in his courts did forever change my calls one moment in his presence [Music] and I've never been the same one night with the King changes everything [Music] one night with the King changes everything [Music] one day in his courts will forever change your heart one moment in his presence [Music] and you'll never meet the same one night with the King it changes everything [Music] from the desert to the king it had been my destiny to be chosen for such a time as this I didn't know that all my dreams could become realities then I saw his face his love captured me cause one night with the King how it changes everything [Music] one day in his courts [Music] will forever change your colors foreign just one moment and his presence oh one moment in his presence and you'll never be the same one night age with the King changes one day in his courts really changes one night with the King changes everything hey man we're gonna have brother Ken come and give us a song man let's give him a hand hey man put a can [Applause] praise the Lord this song is uh it is a Christmas song but it's also a song that means very much to me for a couple reasons one is of course that it's a warning that in the day and age we live in um we as the bride should be seeking out the oil for our lamps and we shouldn't be sleeping during this time and sometimes in the world that we live and it's so easy to get comfortable and lulled to sleep and we don't want our fire to be dampened came up for prayer a couple weeks ago when brother Matt was here and ministering and just realized have been realizing that my oil was getting low [Music] and uh but I got a refilling the other reason why is uh this song my father-in-law sang it here years ago and yeah so it's very special to us [Music] [Music] a whole Little Town of Bethlehem looks like another silent night foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] go back to the hand you will go down in history as a city with no room for its king while you were sleeping [Music] while you were sleeping [Music] a little town of Jerusalem looks like another silent night [Music] I found gave his only son the way the truth in life had come but there was no room for him and the world he came to say [Music] Jerusalem what you have missed While You Were Sleeping the savior of the world is dying on your cross today Jerusalem you will go down in history as a city with no room for its king while you were sleeping while you were sleeping [Music] United States of America looks like another silent night [Music] as we're sung to sleep by philosophies the save the trees and kill the children foreign sky [Music] [Music] for the bridegroom has returned and has carried his bride away in the night in the night while you were sleeping [Music] while you were sleeping [Music] thank you foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] while you were sleeping [Music] oh message people of Malachi 4. just like another silent night My Father's Promise of a bride is here before our very eyes but once again the veil is blinding to you who message people but will you miss while you are sleeping with the prophet long to see you look at and campuses who message people you will go down in history as a bride with no room for her King will you will event [Music] will you be sleeping [Music] [Applause] we have time for one more special sister Amber and family they want us to give us a song this morning amen so let's get in my hand amen hey hey babe Amber you're not in trouble with brother Jason no more when peace like a river attendeth my way s like

here in the house of God and got one prayer request we're going to take up for sister Amy King and Brother David wrote to me that I got a little bit of an update from him we were praying last night and he says it they've figured out it's a viral lung infection and an infection where she had the hip replacement but they have her stabilized and he's Thanking us for our prayers last night and so we want to continue I told him we'd keep praying for her this morning so we'll catch that as we read our text amen I want to thank everybody that made yesterday possible my what a wonderful time sister Debbie and I pulled away with smiling faces and smiling hearts it just does US good to see all of our children some of you are older than us not many but but uh but you're all like our kids amen we talk about that all the time it's say that's a little weird it is to us too but it's how we feel it's hard to hard to put into language but but we just appreciate it done our heart all the camaraderie and working together and and so many people had a hand in making all that possible um I just was thrilled with it all and I thought it all just went off wonderfully I could my kept eating and fellowship and I could have kept hearing singing and we could uh you know if I didn't have to work today I would have stayed around the campfire even longer but I appreciate everybody who pitched in and wanted to thank all the sisters for helping pitch in for all that cleanup and and I you know I rolled up my sleeves and jumped right in there and got all those men out of your way so amen so no need to thank me I I just moved the biggest obstacle amen want to remind everybody that um we will be have we will have a regular service this coming Wednesday actually brother Caleb Campbell is in the slot got a thought burning on his heart I love it when a man of God has his Fox his tail on fire and he wants to a man run run through the enemy's field and burn up all of his crops amen praise the lord we will be in service here Wednesday and then of course Sunday December 25 um seems like in my mind Caleb where you at wave at me did we talk about moving the Wednesday to Tuesday I don't remember I can't remember if we've done that I'll check with my people of my people get with your people we might end up sending out an announcement I can't remember what we did last year uh countless sister Debbie for that but we'll figure that out but anyway we will have a midweek service and then Sunday morning don't forget the uh there's there's there's no Sunday School classes the regular service will start at 10 A.M and we're going to kind of expedite things and I know it's a big family day and but I just think there's no better place to come than the house of God uh you know it only comes around once every seven years so come on to the house of God bring your family and let's really appreciate the reason for the season I I'm so grateful you know to brother Branham that I was listening to that um that quote there at the end uh sister Chastity by the way that quote at the end that that really got me amen I was falling apart back there in the office and you know I was just brother Brandon you know just living it out for me and I had both my hands up saying Lord have mercy on me but I I appreciated brother branham's language you know I was I was thinking yesterday as we were singing those songs and we're talking about Christmas morning Chris the night before Christmas and all this stuff and of course we know we know that December the 25th is certainly not the birthday of the Lamb of God by no means uh but but I'm glad that a prophet taught us a balance and that we know what the real reason is and that so even when we say that you know we're we're not like the Heathen we're not like the world you know we we have a proper understanding when we talk about Christmas and I'm just grateful for a prophet who could put all of that in perspective put it in Balance say it the right way put the right mindset in in our minds amen praise the Lord we'll try to get this in one position Brother Brad amen so I just wanted to say that and thank everybody and then um plan for the end of the year on Saturday the 31st but we don't want to give you too many announcements at once we've already announced it but we'll remind you this coming weekend amen let's turn into Revelation chapter 10 this morning amen and we're going to just uh want to make sure we remember to pray for Sister Amy and brother Doug and sister Chastity um who are driving um up to Virginia today they had to leave out early today and so God bless you young man happy to have you here with us this morning happy to have any other visitors my goodness I am my eyes deceiving do I have an Army Ranger in the house today praise the Lord Brother Noah good to see you man praise God you look look fine and fit as I would expect amen happy to have you here today praise the Lord God bless you all the other different ones amen and there's probably if there's visitors and I'm missing you just excuse me because I do that all the time amen praise the Lord Revelation chapter 10 super familiar to us you pray for me will you please um I I have you know I don't want to say a lot on my plate as if to alarm you that I'm going to do like I did last week and preach a really long time that was an anomaly I don't normally do that but and so I don't it's not that but I I have a very large thought that I'm trying to get my mind fully around because I don't want to leave off anything and I'm continuing today this will be part three on Modern events of 2022 made clear in Prophecy this will be part three and maybe today we'll finish it we don't don't know for sure but even if I get to the end of my notes I don't know for sure just up to the Lord amen Revelation chapter 10. and verse 1 and I was gonna um well we'll just we'll just read these seven first seven verses that's very familiar to us excuse me and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the son and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea in his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and right them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets now the way that a mystery of God gets finished is it materializes it goes from it goes from a prophecy that was given to a prophet who spoke it a chronicler who wrote it in a book but then when it's finished it's actually behind skin that's how you know prophecy is fulfilled God doesn't need us brother random said so many times God does not need anybody to interpret his word it interprets itself we're coming up on a season of the birth of the savior of the whole world theologians argued for seven centuries over what Isaiah meant a virgin shall conceive they all had their idea and when he came and fulfilled it that the manifestation was the interpretation so God interpreted it and because as so often is the case because that man-made religion the interpretation they had didn't men didn't match the manifestation God did they didn't see it and they rejected it that's the danger of today all right Revelation chapter 22. I just want to read um um just a quick couple of verses in Revelation chapter 22. verses 16 and 17. I Jesus have sent mine Angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and The Offspring of David and the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely amen praise the Lord father we thank you for the reading of your word today and we're asking special Graces on the hearer the speaker and the hearer Lord in this present audience and those streaming across the internet Lord father we and those who may hear it at a later time on an archive and we're asking special special Graces for Sister Amy King we're asking that you would lay your hand upon her and touch your lord rebuke this infectious evil spirit trying to harm our sister we hold her up in prayer Lord we offer prayer for brother Doug and sister Chastity and the children that you'd be with them on the road keep them safe Lord at every hour those families traveling brother JD and his family traveling different ones perhaps others perhaps Lord we're asking for your mercy upon them as well in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated foreign so if you will just bear with me and be patient um I I want to go through this methodically and I'm I'm not seeking so much to lay a foundation other than to make a couple of comments that I think can bring you up to speed rapidly on where my mind and my heart is on this title modern events of 2022 made clear in Prophecy that's the only way to make sense of the day and hour that we live in is to understand it in the light of Prophecy now I I want to make this statement and this is kind of a qualifying statement that will help you get on board quickly my title is not a prepared news story about headlines that's not the modern events I'm here to report on today there's there's lots we could do you understand uh that's fine to do that did that to a degree and by a certain measure and he would talk about certain events showing up and but but if you'll notice that when a prophet did that it was it was only ever to correlate it with prophecy he would say here's an event this is what it said would happen you're watching it happen so when a prophet is preaching this sermon originally he was letting the people and this is a big point he was letting the people understand prophecy is popping around you right now you're actually living in the vision of God so so this is important especially for our youth because when you're young you just life is just forever and you're young and you don't have hardly a care and you don't even have enough training in life yet to have a care and uh Mom and Dad have taken care of you for so long and you're just now starting to get get your feet wet in the real world and learn that life ain't always Fair amen Parents Ought To Say Amen so their kids hear them and and so so we find that that this that this is an important point for you to understand that that that this these are not just stories there's not a book of philosophy this is a book that Chronicles the history and the acts of God in history and it foretells and forecasts or prophesies his actions all through history all the way down to the end time now we believe we're here and I'm here to tell you there are there are prophetic statements in this book that correlate directly to the to today when your feet hit the floor you were living prophecy now I'm going to make that clear because you know it's uh it's what we're when we say modern events of 2022 it we're we're trying to emphasize today modern spiritual events what does God doing what do we see in the natural world whether you want to talk about politics or education science or or uh you know uh the the the theological debates that go on the social issues um economic issues uh brother Matt was talking about some of that today and in fact as he was he was actually what if you caught that brother Matt was demonstrating in his in his adult class to adult Sunday school class that events you know in the natural have their greatest importance and the spiritual what you see happening this is why that a prophet would always say the natural types the spiritual not the other way around because the anatype is the is the positive the type is only a shadow you say well what I see happening in the headlines don't look much like a shadow it looks pretty real and tangible listen the Earth you walk on is real intangible but it's a shadow compared to the reality it's going to be my so I think you're you're starting to flow with me I can feel it now so so the events I'm reporting on today couldn't be more modern because they're happening right now say it again the events I'm reporting on today I want your mindset to be that the events I'm reporting on today could not be more modern because they're happening in real time uh a knowledge of what life is actually not the shallow pursuit of stuff mind you is that is that there is a kingdom that is coming that in in a certain way is already here that the kingdom of God which is coming is already operating within you you say the kingdom of God is coming to the Earth you are Earth so it's the the part of the earth that's your body the Holy Spirit living inside you it's already here see so brother Brandon would make the statement that the that that the church that the bride of Christ is the blood of God by the spirit that's a Whoa man that is an astonishing statement the audacity that some people would say who does this guy think he is the the church is the blood of God by the spirit now this is deductive reasoning done right when a prophet does it it comes out correct because his his he's deducing that that the new birth comes by the spirit of God living inside you that's the new birth amen and so when the spirit is in you God's life is in you amen and and therefore and since life is in the blood then the prophet says if the life of God is in me and life is in the blood and I'm born again of the spirit then by the spirit I am the blood of God so there's a kingdom that's setting up and it's it's actually upon us already and when it comes to its full fruition I don't normally do this I was talking to Sister Debbie about it today I said I'm going to feel awkward to take this off but I got my work cut out for me today brother Howard Carroll used to say two things you can't do in a coat one is fight and the other is work and since preaching is both [Laughter] so there's a kingdom that's setting in I want to say that it's setting in upon us already and it's a kingdom as it's coming that it's on a trajectory to literally trivialize every man-made pursuit in history and you say brother Jason that's pretty incredible because there's been some pretty impressive things happen in history and I want to say to you that the only ones that count are the ones that worked in God's will to further his purposes his purpose in Redemption any only the only history that has any relevance eternally speaking I'm not saying history didn't have an impact when Columbus sailed the blue in 1492 there's lots of impact on that I'm not talking about there's not been history that has impact I'm talking about the only thing that has Eternal value is when God was working out his Plan of Redemption and therefore the kingdom that's coming is literally going to trivialize every bit of the history of mankind covering 6 000 years and so you know I mean listen God doesn't even Chronicle the daily lives here's how much God thinks about history outside of that which is servicing his will because lots of men have done lots of things had nothing to do with the will of God they ran on their own tyrants ran on their own they're paying for it today Creek Kings and monarchs did that and they're paying for it today Pharaoh is paying for that and and and the Bible says the Bible actually prophesied his descent into the pit and how that he came down and just sunk down into the pit and all the other people in the cells because that's what hell is it's a place where you're bound over for trial and you don't you can't bail out you don't bail pay bail and get out of this one you're either your bail is denied by the judge and you're bound over for trial and how they said to him finally you've come to pharaoh take your place in the wall with all of us hell is a very real place but God doesn't even Chronicle the daily lives of his own family in the Earthly journey I mean look we know David killed a lion but we have no idea what he did the day before I know he killed a bear but I don't know what he ate for lunch the next day John says that even all the acts of Jesus while he was here on Earth are not even written down what God did write down what God did record was himself working out his own will through people that's what this book is about it's God working out his will through people and and I'm here to tell you the elements that refer to today I'd like to be those people that's why I'm a Believer that's why I'm a Christian I want to be the people that are fulfilling his prophecy see for those who say preacher this whole Jesus thing this whole Christianity thing this whole Bible thing man it just isn't for me no worries I got a place for you to park no no problem no worries say oh you know brother Jason as a preacher should you really be saying no worries well Prophet did he tells about in the message is your life worthy of the Gospel a woman came to him there in Grants Pass and Catholic girl all arrogant and said hey I want to talk to you brother I said cigarette in her hand he said what do you want to say he said I got a question about this religion of yours and she just you know this religion of yours he said what is it you want to ask she said by what Authority do you do this I said in the name of Jesus Christ by a Divine call and she went ahead smart enough and I said just a minute she's and she interrupted him said if I had to associate with that bunch of ignorance up there she said I wouldn't even want to be a Christian I said and and and and and say that them people will rule Earth someday said I hope I'm not here brother M said I said don't worry you won't be he said you you don't if that's all you've got to worry you don't have to worry about that she said Oh all that carrying on and screaming and and brother Brandon said aren't you a Catholic yeah what does that have to do with it said well the Virgin Mary screamed and shouted on the day of Pentecost she said that's nonsense and he said let me turn right to my Bible she said we don't read the Bible the church tells us what he says he says the church is one thing but this is God's word and he said and he read her the account of the of the in the book of Acts that how the Holy Spirit fell and they shout and screamed and spoke in tongues and Mary was among them see and he says Mary was with them up there in that upper room and received the baptism of the Holy Ghost like the rest of them did and you call her the mother of God and call that and call this a bunch of backwash and a bunch of trash I said don't worry you won't be there you don't have much to worry about if that's all you got to worry about you better worry about your own sinful Soul girl and he said and I let her go the gospel is only for believers the gospel is only for believers but for any who who don't want it then here here's where you can park human philosophy science and education that can be your religion cosmologists the people who study the cosmos they made I read a statement here said and and they're they're trying to you know trying to quantify and qualify what life is and they're they're going about it in a way that left me scratching my head they're trying to get people to you know be responsible and feel grateful that you're alive and here's how they go about it all right the cosmologist even with all their depressing talk about the eventual heat death of the cosmos because that's what they say eventually we're gonna you know the sun's gonna burn out it's going to run out of hydrogen going to go into a vacuum and everything and we're all going to die a horrible death but don't worry it's billions of years from now and it might be fine for us but what about the people billions of years from now see he said even with all their depressing talk about the eventual heat death of the cosmos they offer some comfort you all ready here's some comfort if you don't want the gospel here's you some comfort mission of the original vastness of deep time in which it is physically possible for life to even exist so we inhabit or are chosen to inhabit an astounding privileged privileged instant in the lifespan of the universe don't you feel lucky you know we began with a consideration of the 80s old question about the true meaning of life and knowledge of what life is actually is and why it's so important why is it so important that the Bible teaches that we should value it that we should seek it and that we should choose it choose life the Bible says Deuteronomy 30 19 I call I call this is God I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live how many want to live how many want your Offspring to live then choose life if you have a a choice then it means you could choose otherwise you say nobody would do that almost everybody is doing that so we've we'll find out this morning as we go along that the cherry on the top of your life something actually even better if you can imagine something actually better than your biological Life by itself is if it is crowned by The Loving kindness of God the proper understanding of life uh how it came to be the purpose of it all at least as far as eternity is concerned because that's the real question how what is so important about it as far as eternity is concerned this is one of the most viable Revelations you can actually achieve because in this Revelation you actually be able to see yourself and your position in the economy of God what could be more important than that to share in the existence of God himself in a kingdom that will never pass away you somebody tell me what's more important than that to share in the existence of God think about that to to literally share in the existence of God himself and live in a kingdom of his making that will never pass away and a kingdom not only will it not ever pass away it'll never stop increasing our future is bright friends I say it all the time our future is bright my I certainly think that's a a fate much better than some Cosmic ending don't you where we're told that somehow we should be grateful that we have some privileged instant of existence you know he he he redeemed me in an instant down on my knees but as far as my life is concerned it'll never end my my life in his kingdom will never end I thought about the other day I was thinking about thoughts and I I just wrote this on on my notes thinking in the new heavens and the new Earth I'm not talking about thinking about them I'm talking about when you're there and you're they're thinking I thought about this seeing things in perspective realizing what was working all along and that God was never troubled and why was I so worried I love these kind of thoughts thoughts on the other side and my mind like it was always going to come to this when I see you on the other side by the giddy I was so enjoying that song you sang this morning and I thought we're going to sit around the throne we're going to sit around the Great on a sit by the tree of life and and we're going to say man why were we ever worried about wow it was always going to come to this you know if we can stop laughing and rolling around on the ground the trials of life that you know as well as me aren't worth mentioning once you're there Paul said it won't even be worth mentioning and you know what you know one of the things that I'm going to realize on the other side every trial I ever had in every up and every down and every in and every out and every failure and every success was to get me here that's a thought on the other side when I'm looking back in the used to be Chris I'm going to realize everything that ever happened oh I'm gonna laugh at the Devil then everything that ever happened listen friend as I said you in a sermon or two the other other week that Abram all of Abraham's ups and downs placed him in that tent door it was all of Moses's ups and downs it was his failures that brought him to a burning bush oh my this is why this is why even blasphemy that Paul committed could not disqualify him blasphemy see because the bottom line is that there is nothing that could separate Paul from the love of God that was in Christ not when he became a Christian but before the foundation of the world see at first Thessalonians 5 explains why that is because we're Children of the day we're not of the night we've preached on that First Corinthians 2 14 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned y'all know I started late so everybody just sit tight for a little while how about it went into vapor lock and looked at that clock but I remember I started late amen we were we were rejoicing with the Smith family amen so y'all keep let's keep it going so but the natural man First Corinthians 2 14 the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for their foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they're spiritually discerned so we found out in in part two when we preached on this part two that this Revelation that God would bring to us about his kingdom which is an event happening as we live and breathe you're living in Kingdom time brother Branham declared that in the seventh seal he said the kingdom of of God is coming as it has been it's already when that angel descended let me tell you something friend the kingdom clock was moving Hallelujah oh my you're an event on the way to an event he's coming back for those 144 thousand he's got to Exodus you out of here first Hallelujah we found out that the revelation of this kingdom is what would restore Shalom to the bride it's what would give her peace it's what it this Covenant angel that has descended Among Us that's the one who come to give us peace to realize that God's got it in control and I'm not up here today to Chronicle your history all I can tell you is God's got it all in control and he's all always been in control he's never not been in control and so let us say shalom bride it's gonna be okay so you don't know what's happening it doesn't matter it's going to be okay do I am I controlling this uh up here is this little guy working or no okay it might work for me it won't let's see you're right as usual Matt all right bubs you ready for me brother Branham comes in the message let's start with our first uh slide here the faith of Abraham 1959 April 1959 brother Brandon said whosoever is born of the spirit of God is God's and your come in by the promise through the Covenant God made to Abraham now I I I hope that you really absorb what's being said here that you you come in through the through the Covenant God made to Abraham his promise that he would send Christ and if you're in Christ you're part of that Covenant so now this is why a covenant angel you're going to find out here in a few minutes this is why this Covenant Angel is Among Us now it's not just the it's it it's the same God that dwelt above Israel and the same God that walked the shores of Galilee it's the same being the same person that came down in an upper room but I'm here to tell you now he's come into this age and there's some unique things about this age and about what he's up to and one of the things he's up to is finally at last at long last he's here to fulfill his Covenant he's here to finish it you have come in because of that covenant not how good you are how bad you are how smart you are how handsome you are you're in because of a covenant God made to a man almost 4 000 years ago more than actually now that I think about it so he goes on next slide and the promises you say now here's what you say I'm not worthy neither was Abraham neither was Abraham nobody's Worthy I'm gonna give y'all something fun to do you ready we're going to say nobody's worthy ready one two three nobody's Worthy amen so anybody on their high horse just say to yourself nobody's Worthy see nobody's worthy because there's where the Devil beats us up but I I came not worthy I've never been Worthy it's not about me you're gonna find that out watch you say I'm not worthy neither was Abraham nobody's worthy it ain't how worthy you are it's what God promised you everybody next slide everybody's always looking at their self why you can't look at yourself and get anywhere see next slide you're finished to begin with next oh go back go forward that shouldn't go there we go you're a failure to start with I'm glad to hear three or four people I finished to begin with your failure to start with next UPS there's nothing you can do to begin with there's nothing nothing to you there's not ain't nothing to you to begin with next it's what God Made You Is What You Are shalom Shalom this is a covenant Angel this what the Covenant angel came to a to ensure in your heart you're going to need rapturing Faith so he sends a rapturing word smears it heavy with Rapture and Grace and hands it to you like a piece of butter toast and says eat this because you're going to need to have faith I don't have any faith in me that's great have faith in him the Covenant angel this is a kingdom coming into play I'm here to tell you God's thought of everything by the time I get done you're not going to find any way to kick yourself out or disqualify yourself see so it's it's it's what God Made You is what you are so so not not to me in me it's what God made you not to you but in you it's a gene representation inside of me that I was never good enough to get and I could never be bad enough to lose it's a representation before the world was ever built [Music] see so he he's saying to stay right there dubs he's saying that you were those things to start with see you say wow I mean goodness this Prophet is insulting me you're finished to begin with you're a failure to start with didn't you love it how many wanted to come to church today to hear your pastor look you in the eye and say you're nothing to begin with you're finished to start with you're a failure to start with see say all that that Prophet you know he he's insulting me is he are you sure what he's saying is is that you were those things to start with you were those things in your past a prophet is saying to you a prophet is saying to you a prophet is saying to you you're not those things anymore you're not those things anymore my yeah I started that way I was a stinker for sure but you're not that way anymore why because you received a covenant promise Hallelujah Prophet is declaring that you're not what you used to be you know I'm not so sure the world is convinced of that about me and I'm not sure even I always feel convinced but a prophet isn't declaring what the world thinks or what you think or what I think he's not declaring about all your shortcomings and your failures it's not about your feelings it's what God thinks about you see the devil is good he's a master at Psychology you can't take him on in those Realms of intellectualism that's why you need a revelation that's why I start out by saying there's nothing to to have greater than revelation of what life actually is see because the devil will place a thought in your head he might be trying to do it right now and and he because because listen he's got the video replay of all your weaknesses and all your stumblings and he he's actually might be right now trying to make you think that it's your thought I'm not worthy I can't make it uh how I mean as I thought to myself Lord this is so amazing but I thought to myself how can an all-knowing God lie to himself about me [Music] and and that's a thought from the enemy who might be trying to get you to think it's your thought how can God nobody in here knows what I'm guilty of how can God lie to himself about me God is not lying about me he's not looking at me he's looking at Christ crediting it to me [Applause] Hallelujah next slide dubs under the old Covenant let me keep up with myself here under the old Covenant I love this story what if a little mule would be borne out in the past you like that Kentucky word born out in the pasture some night and when that little mule was born he'd turn around in his Mammy would look at him and his ears would be flopped down you know what a flop-eared mule is being a farmer that mule is no good he's cross-eyed see you just go break his neck and kill him he's worthless he'll he'll eat food you can't you don't even need to feed him see a farmer knows that next slide his knees his knees knocked together his tail sticks straight up in the air he's the horriblest thing a harmless looking sight you ever seen that little fella could look around to his Mommy and say well I won't be able to live no circles as soon as the master comes out here he'll knock me in the head because I ain't worth nothing next that's just about like every one of us but his mother well instructed in the word of God she'd say wait a minute honey no no you are born under a Birthright when the man of the house comes out he will go to the pasture and hunt the most perfect lamb he's got next the high priest will never see you he will see the lamb he won't examine you he will examine the lamb because you're born under a Birthright the lamb has to die for you now you look at Jesus and find fault in any fault in him don't look at yourself look at him don't look at who you are don't look at who you are don't look at who you are don't look at who you are look at who he is next then you'll be getting close to Divine Healing sturge your sacrifice over if you can find any fault in that well that's different then you have a right to disbelieve but there's no fault in him God don't look at you he looked at your sacrifice shalom these These are the principles and the realities and the covenants that the Covenant angel that that same Angel made the Covenant to Abraham and he's here today to enforce it I'm here to tell you the devil can't get you because a covenant Angel is present you have a token over your home you have a token over your family and it has jurisdiction because of Covenant Angel has descended in our day I love this next line next up there was a perfect one died for us fall tree ones boy word kept kicking that back to me dictionary.com faltery fall tree what in the world you ain't faulty no faltery there was a perfect one died for us faltery ones see faulty is just for those with few faults but I have so many I'd needed an extra letter in there I know that's not the King's English but I'll stick with Kentucky English on this one why because Scholars could never next next Noah wow that little mule uh uh that's not right oh yeah we here you're right you're right Noah we who are disfigured and immoral and ugly and I love this next word because there's nothing outside of it and everything but he you fought tree ones now you fall tree ones see he took the perfect one and looked him over this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased he was the sacrifice God accepted him so ours is finished next line all we have to do is walk in Grace what do I have to do brother Jason walk in Grace hearing receiving and acting what are you doing I'm acting on the word I'm what are you doing I'm walking in Grace you know you're probably not very worthy you're not wrong but I'm walking in Praise so you think you're going to get into heaven yeah me and all these other faltery ones we're all getting in because we heard we recognize we received and we're willing to act upon the word of God hallelujah next slide well that little mule could just kick up them them little heels and knock them little knock knees together and knicker and go all over the field because he's free he don't have to die you notice he's still got his knock knees I'm not saying you look much better than you did two minutes ago I'm simply saying it don't matter you might you might still have your knock knees you might still have your weaknesses you might steal until you get out of this flesh someday we're gonna have to battle our memory we have to battle our weaknesses we have to battle our our like passions like Elijah but I'm here to tell you it doesn't matter because he wasn't looking at you he was looking at your sacrifice this is a modern event make clear in 2022 a lamb died for him he's perfectly safe don't have to fear about dying the land died for him you don't have to fear about what you are it's what he was he was the one who died for you next then you find fault in him then I'll tell you why you can't be healed see because people find fault in the word they argue against and wonder why they can't get their prayers answered they try to reason God's word and they won't just obey it and then they wonder why I don't have any power with God stop reasoning the believe on him whom God hath sent believe what God has said in this day a covenant angel came down to confirm that Prophet was a real one and he was a true one and the message is accurate and and signs and wonders Will Follow That faith and the power of God will get behind that Faith Amen Brother John Hallelujah I'm here to tell you it'll it'll reach out into the Ethereal and take an impossible situation and rearrange the whole thing and leave everybody astonishing it'll send brother Jack to work on a house of an attorney who just happens to know through a friend connected to the woman trying to come after brother Jack if immorally over over money that she she knows good and well brother Jack is completely innocent and everybody in the county knows brother Jack and this high priced highfalutin lawyer you know what he told he told his buddy he said you tell her she might as well Fold It Up forget it and go home ain't nobody gonna come after Jack guest everybody around here knows the testimony of Jack guess hey man that's God defending his family that's Decades of following the ways of the word that's Decades of testifying what God has done that's Decades of believing in a covenant Hallelujah see then you find fault in him I'll tell you why you can't get healed but when you find no fault in your sacrifice God has accepted that sacrifice and when he accept the sacrifice he accepts your confession in that sacrifice and you become a part of it a part of what the Covenant the Covenant that he made with Abraham see my but you know Pastor Jason I I really do have many flaws and I I really do make many mistakes but there's no fault in him God don't look at you he looked at your sacrifice there was a perfect one died for us faltery ones is the next slide blank Noah no okay that's fine I thought I had a blank one in there oh you're right go to go to the next one I feel religious now because I know I didn't have a chance to begin with but I didn't look at myself I looked at the sacrifice that was offered for me it was perfect and God already accepted it so then I'm I'm all right now when I see what he did what he is it isn't me it's him it isn't you it's him friends if you don't get nothing else out of this service today hear the Covenant Angel saying to you it ain't you it's him it ain't you it's him it ain't you it's him the Covenant ain't based on you it wasn't based on Abraham it's based on God it's based on God's purpose in Redemption said I have chosen you Abraham and I'm not telling you if you will this and I will that he said I'm here's here to tell you I've already done it you're going to be the father of Nations now watch last last one here before we hit a blank slide and and you'll never receive the holy ghost in the fullness you'll never walk in the spirit of God until you totally separate your things from unbelief get away from the world come out of the world see this Grace isn't disgrace this isn't just name it claim it this isn't just you know just believe easy believism this is actually something that comes inside of you you say well now okay now we're back to my ups and downs and failures again no I'm talking about God has already taken care of all of that but it but if you want to know if it's really taken care of if you really want to know if the Covenant Angel has assured it to you if you do you have so on personally you have it if you know that inside your heart you love God and you love his word and you hate sin and you don't want failure you might have it but you don't want it because why something changed me I'm not trying to be a name it Christian I'm trying to be a real one I think I have a I think I have a blank one now right Noah yeah go to that and just hold right there see the inherent weakness and all of us faultry ones is to believe God's word and God's decision regarding ourselves come on that's it let's just look each other in the iron just admit that that's really the problem I'm a faltery one and I'm I'm more of a fault I'm far more of a faltery one by not believing what I've just heard and read I'm far more faltery not believing that than I am committing some transgression I'm way more faultry by not believing the Covenant that God isn't it that it's not even upon me I I Repent we first John says this um Noah take it down can you go to scripture and then we'll put it back up all right take it down and go to scripture first John 1 7 to 10. everybody's still good first John 1 7-10 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus his son cleanseth us from all sin if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in US but here's the beautiful part if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness how many have you ever experienced that I have experienced that more times than I'd like to admit I probably better raise up both hands I have experienced that friends he is faithful and just if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us see so the the idea is to get you off your high horse and stop saying you're holier than thou stop saying you're perfect see because you know you know what's just as you know it's just as bad as as a self-righteous person saying I'm perfect the polar opposite to say I just can't believe God's word about me one is as bad as the other and so he's using contrast to try to get you to say look you're don't say you don't have sin but understand we have an advocate and if you'll confess he's faithful and just to forgive us first John chapter 2 go right on into the second chapter there no Noah verse one and two my little children these things right I unto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world chapter 3 verse 8 and 9 he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil that's why the Covenant Angels here if he can just get you to believe it see whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God so I might commit a transgression of which I have an advocate that I can confess it and he's faithful and just to forgive me but I have a representation a gene of God done inside me that predates my Earthly existence predates my failures it predates everything it predates Lucifer it predates everything Hallelujah see this is why I was saying the other night true repentance is the key to life I have some other statements I want to read you from different messages but I'm only going to put one of them up a final last quote let's refer to you this when God doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him January July 24 1963 he says if no repentance then judgment is sure to come see Hezekiah repented see Nineveh repented Ahab never repented Nebuchadnezzar never repented the people in Noah's time never repent and the judgments swept right on see now but he first warns everybody everybody gets a warning now seeing the time is at hand now I didn't put these up on purpose because I wanted to read them slow and I want to read them for effect and I want you to absorb see now seeing the time is at hand let everyone that feels that there is a warning repent quickly before the wrath of God strikes I was showing my wife a news article brother Donnie put in The Minister's chat early this morning that scientists are now all in all in a massive agreement all have concluded that the West Coast that a that a major major natural destruction is imminent and they said even San Francisco alone and I haven't even read the whole article yet I only got down to the about the first paragraph and they're talking about Northern Cal and they said what is awaiting San Francisco alone is an event many times the magnitude of many nuclear bombs and a prophet said Los Angeles you're doomed God is going to sink Hollywood and put her beneath the ocean and it'll come all the way back a chunk of land 1500 miles long and 350 miles in all the way back to the Salton Sea will break off sink and slide Beneath the Sea in the tribulation period and now you know science is not just saying they were saying back in the 60s not a matter of if but when but now this newest latest article is on Yahoo News they were they're saying No this this you don't realize this this is happening soon so if you hear that see but but watch he says so so he comes to this let me let me let me give you this I'm trying to I'm trying to move quickly oh brother Dao y'all remember old brother Dao past 90 when brother Brown led him to the Lord he comes to brother random one day and he's just troubled he's a fall tree one and he's having a hard time believing some of the hard things you're having a hard time believing because we're faltery and we we know our own weaknesses know thyself I wish I didn't speaking to brother Dao brother thou come to him with this question he says brother Branham you know do I I just need to be sure and he says now I said in this case I'm giving it a soul examination see and God for the soul only has one instrument that's right that's his word that's his word and Jesus said in Saint John 5 24 he that heareth my word now that here doesn't doesn't mean just to listen out of noise that here means to receive it hearing receiving acting hearing recognizing acting on the word of God here means to receive it who can receive my word amen he that hears it don't stand still and say oh nonsense them things there's nothing to it I don't believe that it's he that hears my word uh-huh that's the word of Jesus which he is the word there you are he's talking to an old man in his 90s he says if you can hear my word and Believe on him that sent me he's passed from Death to life and shall not even come into the Judgment but has already passed from it amen I said How's your heart beaten right now that old man said I believe it I have heard it I have received it I said then according to the Head specialist the chief operator the chief doctor of eternal life says you've passed from Death to life and shall never come into the condemnation Psalms 14 Noah still good I'm moving along as quickly as I can Psalms 14 1 we're going to think about these philosophers the fool hath said in his heart there is no God they are corrupt they have done abominable work there is none that doeth good the Lord looked down from heaven upon the Children of Men to see if there was any that did understand and seek God they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread and call not upon the Lord they were there were they in great fear for God is in the generation of the righteous you have shamed the counsel of the poor because the Lord is his Refuge oh David says all that salvation of Israel would come out of Zion when the Lord bringeth the Captivity of his people Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be glad now this is part of the Kingdom prophecy this is you remember on the Mount of Olives when Jesus is about to ascend and they go up there and they say Lord will you now restore Israel okay okay we've really kind of messed it up we didn't realize you had to die okay we get it and I wrote to him as we understand you met us in the room you rebuke Thomas okay we've been by the seaside we know it's you okay okay okay okay okay we get it we got it now are you gonna restore Israel and Jesus says it's not even for you to know yeah don't even ask me that question said that that don't you worry David's prayer is going to come to pass see but first you're going to go into Jerusalem and Terry and wait to be endued with power because I got something for you to do see in other words Jesus is saying to them you're going to be a part of this prophecy you're going to help facilitate it how many want to help facilitate the word of God see the intent of Psalms 14. writes one uh commentator is to counter the Temptation so this is a real Temptation in humanity all right David writes Psalms 14 and and one commentator writes about how that this is to counter the Temptation that humankind and boy is this ever true that humankind you know can manage the world in ways better than Jehovah can mankind has thought that for Millennia and he's done nothing but but genocide and War and famine and pestilence and killing and cheating and stabbing and and all kinds of horrible things that human humans do to humans but he can run it better than God see so because the alternative as far as the ungodly are concerned here's what the ungodly want to do they they have it in their mind to reorder life now we've spent a little bit of time talking about what life is actually see and that that Revelation as I said is the greatest Revelation you could have because it shows you who you are and your position your place in the prophecy to bring God's kingdom to pass so you're here working with the Covenant angel you got me but man in his Fallen state is always wanting to reorder life see and David what David is guaranteeing that hey life will not be so easily reorganized as you think it will because God's purposes are not going to be undone and so you're kicking against the prince you're trying to reorder everything outside of the will of God it's not going to work stop drop and roll because you can't reorder God's purposes see God's will endures and so David says oh that the salvation of the Israel were come out of Zion when the Lord bringeth back the Captivity of his people Jacob here's the kingdom Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be glad so David yearn for the establishment of the Lord's Kingdom and that wasn't unusual the son of David had the same feeling and you can find it in Matthew 6 10 where he's in a prayer they're saying Lord teach us how to pray and one of the first things that he wants that that's a desire of his heart and he wants to project it into their hearts is to pray thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven Jesus yearned for it too thy will be done in earth bring the Earth like the vision of Heaven Hallelujah thy kingdom come this is what we yearn for isn't it friends he taught us to pray there's nothing wrong with praying that thy kingdom come that's why revelation 22 20 he which testifyeth these things saith surely I come quickly John's response and our response is even so what he said even so come quickly Lord Jesus Hallelujah even so even so what come quickly Hallelujah Jesus and John and we say I say with David I say with Jesus I say with John even so come even so come Hallelujah the kingdom coming listen now I'm going to make my turn for home the kingdom coming is associated with restoration to perfection you're coming back to Genesis that's what everything has been about this long trajectory of Redemption all the way back it circles back around on itself and brings the last day bride back to where the fall to set the kingdom in its rightly positioned that fell by sin in the garden to bring the kingdom to restore the kingdom that's you and me to its rightly positioned see and so watch what he says so so so so so now in order to do that listen to this statement in order to do that in order to bring restoration back to Perfection this would require the total complete annihilation of anything against them he could never get Genesis back until he first come as a covenant angel in this day and dismissed every weakness and failure and doubt and anything that's against you is completely struck off by your faith in the bleeding word that's why the Covenant Angel descended in Revelation 10. he's coming to to make Redemption claims it's amazing he says in in Romans 11 26 and 27 and so all Israel shall be saved that is it is written there shall come out of Zion that deliver and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is Catch it this is my Covenant unto them when I shall take away you reading that with me when I shall take away their sins you're in the hour where he's removing all claims of the enemy dismissing all charges canceling all evidence you're completely exonerated your whole entire record is expunged in the courtroom of heaven and can never be brought to bear against you again that's what this Covenant Angel come to establish the Kingdom Israel political longed for his kingdom too but in the very end you know the problem that you know what the problem political Israel had is their view of the kingdom and how it was going to be ordered was different than when Jesus come to order because when he came he told them that that unless they actually came by the water and the spirit they could never enter into his kingdom he told them they had to be born again now that was a problem for them because if that were to happen then that would undermine their lofty position among the people you understand because because they love their power and they loved their seat of authority they loved wearing long robes and praying long prayers in public and being called Rabbi they were so opposed to his system that they crucified him they even introduced false Witnesses into his trial I'm here to tell you that spirit is still alive today it's still alive today they're still crucifying the word with false Witnesses that was political Israel that was denominational Judaism you see why we flee denominationalism you see why the mark of the beast says it leads you to the mark of the beast the The Book of Revelation says it leads you to the mark of the beast see that was political Israel that was denominational Judah they Judaism they hated him organized religion always does see but spiritual Israel she's loved him for two thousand years how many spiritual Israelites we got in here today she's loved him for two thousand years I'm gonna tell you something friends Paul promised a great reward for those who love his appearing and when he appeared I fell in love oh my I look around and organize religion I say nothing doing that ain't for me I want the real thing I don't want dehydrated Christianity Just Add Water no sir I want the real thing Hallelujah and now all the 144 000 are filling the pool do you understand that they're calling for his return and we're calling for his return come Lord Jesus Hallelujah bring on your kingdom because the kingdom as I've said is associated with restoration to Perfection and this would require the total knowledge of anything against its family I find myself longing for that more than streets of gold I find myself wanting Purity perfect Flawless purity and everything I do and everything I think and everything I say every purpose I have I want streets of gold are fine I'll love them when I get there see my reflection in perfect gold but I'm here to tell you something friends I want a purity of life I want a purity of mine that's how I know that I've loved his appearing because that's what his appearing came to do was to give you that Zephaniah look at this Kingdom prophecy chapter 3 verses 14 to 16 see this is the this is the kingdom restored sing O Daughter of Zion now Zion in the Bible is always the bride you know that yeah Prophet Thomas that's always the bride sing Old Daughter of Zion shout o Israel be glad and rejoice with all the heart oh daughter of Jerusalem the Lord hath taken away thy judgments he hath cast out thine enemy the king of Israel even the Lord is in the midst of thee Thou shalt not see evil any more his coming was always about establishing a kingdom of saints in the earth that's what the Book of Genesis was all about that's what the Garden of Eden was all about see and that's what he but but you know what happened sin entered and man fell so the kingdom returns for the purpose of establishing the Millennium but first it must deal with sin it's got to deal that's why when the seventh seal opened and the prophet says the kingdom is coming as it had been the the sin question what's being settled forever a bride was being re recreated back to her virgin condition that's what I'm trying to get you to understand today you're under the Covenant this is a modern event made clear in Prophecy you're being recreated back to your virgin condition he says here in the future home 16 minutes I'll stop 16 minutes I'll stop future home listen now see you were made for an eternal purpose did you know that I don't care what you feel like I don't care what's happened to you I'm talking about what you're made for and he's restoring what you were made for you were made for an eternal purpose because you was in the manifestation of an act you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you expressed you and he made an earth to take you out of and to make you a human being not easy not simple well he says sin come along and perverted his way you come anyhow see nature just kept working parents kept procreating you come anyhow see you come anyhow but you was lost with the world so he come and redeemed you the express attribute and also redeems this Earth by the same way then his purpose rolls on all see friends sin marred his picture but not his plan sin I've been marred plenty of times but his plan is still rolling and I'm still a part of it nothing could stop him from redeeming me I wish today you could just raise up your hands and let the devil hear it there's nothing that could stop him from redeeming me there was nothing that could stop him from redeeming me nothing at all when you look in the Book of Micah we're not going to turn to it Noah but you can go home and read it in chapter 7 18 to 20. there's that's actually the passage that contains the idea of a sea of forgetfulness that's the root that's the root Old Testament shadow where brother Brandon would talk about a sea of God's forgetfulness a sea of God's forgetfulness and he goes he goes I'm gonna I'm gonna cut to the chase here so he said I I I have other quotes but I'm not not going to read I'm going to try to read get down to that very last one uh that we're going to read and then we're going to let you go so he starts talking about the Sea of God's forgetfulness and about the Zoe life that's in you and it's a part you he kept saying it you're part of God we become a part of God things that are to be saying on the same thing see just like Adam and Eve worked and lived and eaten enjoyed in the Garden of Eden before sin came in we're on our road right back there again see the first Adam through sin taking us out the second Adam through righteous brings us back in again justifies us brings us back in he says in Investments now uh watch this let me see if that's the one I have um yes it is Noah let's go back and I'm going to read these somewhere and this is where we're going to stop watch um I got one before that yeah notice notice when this your sins are confessed and your sins are dropped into the bleach of the blood of the son of God it remits sin so much that it puts it in the sea of God's forgetfulness and can never be remembered in his sight anymore then what that does that does that make a man a Son of God what does it make a man a Son of God God never remembers you to be a sinner man God never remembers you to be a sinner you're a son you're a daughter there's no more remembrance of sin at all everybody say at all next one Noah last slide there's no more remembrance of it at all God puts it in the sea of forgetfulness the bleach the sea of forgetfulness is Christ's blood that was shed for you and therefore then you and God are Father and Son by Jesus Christ's Grace not by anything you've done but by his grace you are Sons and Daughters of God and a partaker of His blessings and of his power and of his life his life is in you for you are a son of God so all of my sins that's it does that's it all of my sins are cast into the sea of God's forgetfulness it's amazing I was telling you I think Wednesday that most theologians think that it's not that God forgets it because God can't lose anything that's their reasoning says but what it what it is is God just chooses not to for not to remember but when you go back and read Mike Micah you don't find it that way when you come and read a prophet that's not how you find it when we read our scriptures in in Zephaniah when we read it these other places you find that he's taking away all the evil all the sin it's gone it's not put in a in a in a locked box it's gone the only one that can annihilate anything is the creator he can uncreate it Hallelujah one of these days going to uncreate the devil I'm so glad see so all my sins are cast in The Sea of God's forgetfulness now it's not a place you can go visit if you could I'll post a sign there no fishing but it's not a place you can go visit there's no GPS coordinate theologians don't believe that God forgets my sin see they just believe he chooses not to remember it but if that was the case then my sin would still exist and eventually somebody's got to pay for it but he doesn't just put it in a locked box somewhere I'm here to tell you something friends the Sea of God's forgetfulness is a sea of non-existence you just believe it that way the Sea of God forgives not a GPS location not a place you can go visit it's a sea of God's forget it's for God's forgiveness it's a sea of non-existence everything that's in it doesn't exist oh my Hallelujah I'm here to tell you there there might be Multiverse they talk about Multiverse all the time if there's a Multiverse it has had it's had many versions of my life that don't exist anymore Hallelujah I don't know what all is out there but I know if it exists it's got versions of my life that don't exist anymore why because they're all now in the sea of non-existent glory to God all right now I have a better understanding now I have a better understanding or at least a greater appreciation for a prophet saying one day when our flesh changes that word and he will become what we had never dreamed possible I'm part of that word I'm part of he I'm in that he in that word just like the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ it's Christ and his bride he where when our flesh changes that word and he will become what we never dreamed possible the king and queen will be what we never dreamed possible you listen friends I'll stand there on that day and I'll realize I was talking to you earlier about thoughts on the other side I'm going to realize that what I have become on the other side is something I never dreamed possible that's where you are today friends that is modern events make of 2022 made clear in Prophecy it's happening now it's all around you it's working on your life can I say to you today let it let this mind which was in Christ be in you don't leave here today
