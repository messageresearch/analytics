This is my [Music] offering. In every moment I withhold nothing. I'm learning to trust you. Even when I can't see it. And even in suffering, I have to believe it. If you say it's wrong, then I'll say no. If you say release, I'm letting go. If you're in it with me, I'll begin. When you say to jump, I'm diving in. If you say be still, then I will wait. If you say to trust, I will oy. I don't want to follow my own way. I'm done chasing feelings. Spirit lead [Music] me. I felt like a burden. But once I could grasp it, you took me further, further than I was asking. And simply to see you. It's worth it all. My life is an altar. Let your fire fall. If you say it's wrong, then I'll say no. If you say release, I'm letting go. If you're in it with me, I'll begin. When you say to jump, I'm diving in. If you say be still, then I will wait. If you say I trust I will oy. Teach me how to follow in your way. I'm done chasing feelings. Spirit lead [Music] me. When all hope is gone and your word is all I've got, I have to believe you still bring water from the rocks to satisfy my thirst. To love me at my worst. And even when I don't remember, you remind me of my worth. I don't trust my ways. I'm trading in my thoughts. I lay down everything. Cuz you're all that I want. I landed on my knees.

You're the only truth life away. I'm done chasing feelings. Spirit, lead me. [Music] Spirit lead me. [Music] [Music] [Music] God bless y'all. [Music] I have wrestled in the darkness of this holy pilgrim land, raising strong and mighty fortresses that I long command. But these castles I've constructed by the strength of my own hands are just temporary kingdom on foundation made of sand in the middle of the battle. I believe I finally found. I'll never know the thrill of victory until I'm willing to let down all my weapons of defense and ugly strategies of war. So I'm laying down my arms and running helplessly to yours. I surrender all my silent hopes and dreams. Oh, the price to follow cost me everything. I surrender all my human soul desires. Sacrifice requires that all my kingdoms fall. I surrender [Music] all. If the source of my ambition is the treasure I obtain. If I measure my successes on a scale of every game, the focus of my vision is the status I obtain. My accomplishments are worthless and my efforts are in vain. So I lay aside these trophies to pursue a higher crown. Should you choose to use slide fight willingly lay down, I surrender all the trials. Glor is only by your grace. I relinquish all the glory. I surrender all the praise. I surrender all my silent hopes and dreams and hold the price to follow. Cost me everything. I surrender all. My human soul desires. Sacrifice requires that all my kingdoms fall. I surrender all. Everything I am, all I've done, and all I've known, it now belongs to you. Just like my is not my own. Just as Abraham laid Isaac on a sacrificial fire. All I have is all that you require. I [Applause] surrender all. [Music] I surrender all my silent hopes and dreams. Although the price to follow cost me everything. I surrender all my human soul desire to sacrifice require. Let all my kingdoms fall. Let all my kingdoms fall. I surrender [Music] [Applause] [Music] all. Brother Ray, if you come on, brother.

It was all CDs, right, Brother Mark? Amen. And and it was a bunch of bad stuff in that book. And I didn't know what to do. I needed to get rid of it. It was tough cuz I knew there was thousands of dollars invested in all those CDs and everything else. And I went into my church and they had one of those glass cases and I looked and it never listened to it before and it was uh Lenal or it was Louis Bleven and the Y brothers in cassette. So I grabbed it, Brother Lo, and I listened to it until I wore it out. I brought it to Georgia from British Columbia and I tell you anointed songwriting. Amen. And I appreciate it, brother Lenol, and all that he's done for the bride of Christ. Amen.

Peace. Oh, I love that peace. Don't you? Oh, grace and favor. And right now is the moment. Today is the day I've been changed. I've been changed. I have waited for this moment to come. And I won't let it pass me by. So I say I won't go back. I can't go back to the way it used to be. Before your presence came. Oh, it changed me. I won't go. I won't go back. I can't go back to the way it used to be before your presence came and changed me. Oh my [Music] shame. Oh, my sins forgiven. Oh, if there's no more chains or no more fear. Oh, my past.

And thank you, Lord, for your presence that changes us. Amen. Amen. [Music] Amen. Amen. Amen. This song was actually inspired um through uh a situation, circumstances that were beyond my control. Amen. but that Satan took advantage of to try to throw me off, tried to attack me spiritually, tried to he just put me in a place that I I I did didn't want to be in. And um it's funny, you know, when you get saved, you think all of that is behind you, but the battle continues, doesn't it? And then a lot of times, nobody really wants to admit that those battles exist. And uh man, they existed for me. And I have an amazing family, an amazing wife. Amen. Goodness gracious. I don't even know. Sometimes when I turn, look in the passenger seat of the car, I'm just glad she's still there. Amen. But uh you can go through some real hard times, insane times. It feels like it feels like you're going crazy. Amen. And uh situations, circumstances beyond your control. And then it started to affect my spiritual life, my spiritual walk, and my faith. not shaken but just wanted to know where it went at times, you know. Anyway, so I was in church, little church, and uh this brother got up to minister and I expected nothing. And God came through that brother and he took a subject called the inner man. And man, it changed me, you know. And in that moment, I was free. I knew I was free. It didn't matter anymore. Amen. So, I can say tonight, if you're dealing with that, and guess what? Every one of us deals with those kind of things and and those situations. You can come to church, you can smile, right, brother Tim? You can say, "Everything's good." You can sing, "All is well, Brother Leno, but when you go home, it's pretty dark." But God, the great deliverer, Jehovah Gyra, Amen. And he can come on the scene and deliver you anytime, any place, anywhere. Amen. Do you believe that? Amen. Amen. It just takes trusting in him. Amen. Excuses. There's one for everything that's wrong with me. And Satan tries to tell me I've got time. You [Music] see confusion. Lord, let the false desires fade [Music] away. Here's my heart. Please make it a sweet dwelling [Music] place. Oh, I want to make things right. Let this be the night I am set [Music] free. And Lord, I come to you. fall down on my knees and I ask of you to make my life an image of all that's true. And Lord, I run to you. [Music] Father, I can hear you calling for your son. Perform a work in me never to be undone. Oh Lord, I [Music] come forgiven. It's in your grace this inner man's been found. And all the chains of this world now lay on the ground, justified through the power of your blood. I've been set free. My sins are gone, no longer in your memory. Oh, you came and made things right. Gave me back my sight. I am set free. Oh yes, I'm free. I'm free indeed. And Lord, I come to you. bow down at your feet. And I ask of you to make my life an image of all that's true. Oh, and Lord, I run to you. Father, I can hear you calling for your son. perform a work in me never to be undone. Oh Lord, I come. Oh Lord, I [Music] come. Oh Lord, I come. [Music] God bless [Applause] you. Amen. Let's stand really quick. We're going to take a quick quick intermission. Go out, stretch your feet, shake a little bit, use the restroom, and get back soon as possible. I'm not going to put a time on it, but we're just going to give you a few minutes to rest and kind of stretch a bit, and then we'll start right back singing. Okay. [Music] It's already [Music] done. It's already done. The victory is won. The battle is over. It's already [Applause] [Music] done. It's already [Music] done. It's already done. The victory is won. The battle is over.

[Music] For anyone who's ever seen the mountains of their sin just disappear. [Music] For anyone who's ever felt the hand of heaven reach down through their fears and dry their tears. For any life once empty that now finds itself alive and full of songs, victory songs. Then you'll understand the reason for the way the saints of God may carry on. [Music] So if I shout, no I'm shouting from a heart that's been washed clean. And if I run, no, I'm running. From a past that's been redeemed to the world, it might look crazy. But there's just no telling what you're going to do. In that moment, Jesus gets a hold of you. Oh, praise God. for anyone who knows the hope that keeps them moving on through troubled [Music] days. For anyone who knows they've got a future and a hope beyond the grave. Every life's a different story. How he led us out of darkness into light. victory light. There's no way to keep us silent. Every vers another chance to testify to testify. So if I shall know I'm shouting from a heart that's been washed clean and my ride know I'm running from a past that's been redeemed to the world. It might look crazy, but there's just no telling what you're going to do. In that moment, Jesus, get a hold of you. Carry on now, my brother. Carry on now, my [Music] sisters. Carry on now, my brothers. Carry on now, my sisters. Oh, carry on now, my brothers. Carry on now, my sisters. Carry on now, my brothers. Carry on now, my sisters. Just like the Holy Spirit's got a hold of you. So in my shell, no I'm shouting from a heart that's been washed clean. And in my run, no I'm running from a life to the world. It might look crazy, but there's just no telling what you're going to do. In that moment, Jesus gets a hold of you. Carry on now, my brothers. Carry on now, my sister. Oh, carry on now, my brothers.

There's just no telling what you're going to do. And that moment when Jesus gets a hold of you. Oh. So if I shout, go I'm shouting. From a heart that's been washed clean. And if I run, go, I'm running. From a past that's been redeemed to the world, it might look crazy. But there's just no telling what you're going to do. In that moment, Jesus gets a hold of you. When he gets a hold of you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] From his glory he came down. God in flesh and bone set aside his royal crown for a lonely dusty road. That doesn't sound like I love you. Then hear what Calary has to say. The cross must have whispered and the spear must have shouted. The crown of thorns revealed what must be said. And though I love you wasn't spoken through the lips of the Savior. He said, "I love you with three nails instead." Every stripe upon his back was mercy in disguise, tears of sorrow pouring out. Was redemption in his eyes? [Music] that doesn't sound like I love you. Then hear what Calary has to say. The cross must have whispered and the spear must have shouted. The crown of thorns revealed what must be said. Though I love you wasn't spoken from the lips of the Savior. And he said, "I love you with three nails instead." Have you ever felt unelained? Have you ever felt abandoned by the sin that bears your name? The cross must have whispered. And the spear must have shouted. The crown of thorns reveal what must be said. Though I love you as spoken from the lips of the Savior. He said, "I love you with three nails instead." I love you was spoken through the lips of the Savior. He said, "I love you with three nails instead." [Music] Three nails instead. [Applause] Amen. That's Hey, y'all ain't supposed to laugh that much. [Music] Praise be to God. My my my what singing. Glorious singing tonight. And I tell you, I was telling a brother out there, I said, "We're just so blessed to have." See, the devil could have had all of you wonderful singers. But I'm glad that we got you. Amen. Hallelujah. Oh my. Get this pick here. I'll give you pink pick back to you, brother. Just a minute. Which one we do? B flat [Music] first. And B flat. Let's try that. How many of you glad you're a trophy of grace? Brother Lenn, I hate you ain't going to get to sing tonight, brother. I sure was. Looking forward to that. How's it start off? All right. I always got to ask her how it starts off cuz I never remember it. We're We're professionals in case you didn't know that. I never was a good man. It was much the other [Music] way. And I know how it feels to want to give up on some days. And I might hold the record for the most mistakes made. [Music] But to a man called Jesus, I'm a trophy of [Music] grace. And no, I don't deserve all this love that comes my way. And anyone who really knows me can't believe I'm okay. And you may never find my name in some old hall of fame. But he's got a place to put me cuz I'm his trophy of grace. Now it's just in our [Music] nature to wander outside the lines till pain and [Music] disappointments make their way into our lives. [Applause] But unmmerited favor. It conquers all our sin and shame. And we become God's treasures. And Satan's prize is torn away. And no, I don't [Music] deserve all this love that comes my way. And anyone who really knows me can't believe I'm okay. And you may never find my name in some old hall of [Music] fame. But he's got a place to put me. I'm his trophy of grace. [Music] [Applause] They ask us to do too. So I want to read this to you. The second song we're going to sing is what's the name of it? Still God. He's still God. Amen. We're going to sing this one in E. E. That's right. That's just before F. Now, brother got up here a little bit ago and he said D# sharp one. Somebody said E flat. I still don't know which one it is. It's either D# sharp or E flat one. But brother Brandham said this. He was speaking about this song we're going to sing. The second verse says that he was watching all the while. Brother Brandham said when he sent the disciples across the sea, they got in the storm. He said all hopes was gone. But you know what? He was still watching them. The Bible said he climbed up the mountain and he was standing up there watching them, seeing what they that they was in trouble. I'm so glad that grace is still in existence. If it wasn't, we'd all be gone. Amen. Now I got to find the song. Let's go back. Where's it at? Right there. You help me out. She's my navigator. There it is. [Music] Well, I thought that it would happen to anyone but me. I never dreamed that I would carry this heavy burden on my knees. I never thought that I'd be standing just where I stand today. I've never known this kind of heartbreak. I've never felt this kind of pain. But you're still gone. When my eyes have cried a million tears, you're still gone. When my last hope has disappeared, you're still gone and I know you'll make a way somehow. You're still God and you're holding me right [Music] now. My heart can't find the answer for the reason for this trial. Lord, I know your ways are perfect and you've been watching all the while to me. You've proven faithful time and time again. And I'm learning, Lord, to trust you. Even when I don't understand, cuz you're still gone. When my eyes have cried a million [Music] tears, you're still gone. When my last to hope has disappeared, you're still gone and I know you'll make the way somehow. You're still God and you're holding me right [Music] now. You're still gone. When my eyes have cried a million tears, you're still gone. When my last hope has [Music] disappeared, you're still gone and I know you'll make a way somehow. You're still gone and you're holding me right now. [Music] [Applause] [Music] I walk by the tomb of Buddha. Looked inside and saw his bones. I traveled on to see Mohamad still wrapped up in his grave clothes. Then I journey to a garden where old Joseph left him lay precious lamb. God's own begotten was no longer in that grave. If you knew him like I know him, you would know that he's alive. And if you felt him like I feel him resurrection deep inside you know he's living and death has [Music] died. Now, if you're wondering through the darkness, come and step into the light. Nail scarred hands reach out to help you and pull you safe from death to life. Friend, I do have stood where you stand. Could I trust in things unseen? But just one step in his direction. Been in love. He ran to me. If you knew him like I know him, you would know that he's alive. If you felt him like I feel him resurrect deep inside you know he's living and death is done. Oh if you knew him like I know him. You would know that he's alive if you felt him like I feel him for resurrection deep inside. You know he's living and death has died. You know he's living and death has died. [Music] [Applause] I hope The song is a blessing because brother Jason special requested it for me to learn it. So I hope it blesses your hearts like it has mine. [Music] [Music] Moses stood on the [Music] mountain waiting for you to pass by. You put your hands over his face so in your presence he wouldn't die. And all of Israel saw the glory in a shine down through the [Music] age. Now you've called me to boldly seek your face. Show me your face. Lord, show me your face and then gird up my lens that I may stand in this holy [Music] [Applause] place. Show me your face. Lord, your power and your grace. Your power and grace. I will make it to the end. If I can just see your face. David knew there was something more than the ark of your presence in a manger. Messiah was born among king and peasants. And all of Israel saw the glory that is shine down through the age. [Music] Now you've called us to boldly seek your face. Show me your face, Lord. Show me your face. [Music] and up my legs that I might stand in this holy place. Show me your face, Lord. Your power and your grace, your power and grace. I will make it to the [Music] end if I can just see your face. Oh, I know I will make it to the end if I can just see your face. [Music] [Applause] Lord. Amen. Amen. And I sure am enjoying all of this anointed singing. And I certainly agree that the enemy would have liked to have had every one of these singers. I'm glad the Lord preserved. Amen. When there was all those in the Bible that had bowed the knee to Baal, there was a a chosen few that had not done that. You feel like that chosen few tonight. Amen. We're happy to have you all out here tonight. We're gonna get ready to change and let brother Tim take it from here on and then we've got some fellowship going. The night's still young. I mean, if we would have only started about 44 minutes ago if this would have been a regular service. So, Amen. We should still have plenty in the tank. Amen. Praise the Lord. When Brother Joe got up here and I saw him put that capo on the end of that guitar, man, that brought back some memories. Amen. That's actually a hood ornament off a 58 Cadillac if y'all didn't know it. And uh they they told him that um he was going to sing too. I said there should have been a zero behind that. Him and Sister Becky ain't been here in so long. Amen. So we're happy to have all the singers. Amen. Wes got out of his third song. I'm not sure how Lenal got out of his. I don't know how that pulled that off, but we've always there's always tomorrow. Amen. Praise the Lord. I just love the Lord and I love the testimonies that have come. You know, I I think we all tonight probably relate to some of the comments Brother Wesley was making. And you know, sometimes things can come in and challenge our faith. Amen. Doesn't mean that I mean, you know, you didn't you didn't go get your faith, so somebody can't come in and take it from you. That's something that's born inside of you, and nothing can take it. But boy, the devil can sure challenge it. You know, Brother Brandham said that that every one of us that Satan's got a punch coming and you got to be ready for it. Amen. And so I sure have had mine. Jesus had his. I'm sure many of us have had many times where the enemy come in like a flood, but the Lord preserved. Amen. I'm so glad tonight. I feel like so much like brother Brandham tonight. I was standing back here thinking I don't look anything like him. I don't sound like him. I sure don't preach like him. But I feel like tonight I'm exactly like him because I've never take an offering up in my life until [Music] tonight. I can honestly say like brother Brandham, I've never took up an offering. I don't ever remember taking up an offering. We've taken plenty of offerings in here, but it wasn't me taking them up. So, I'm going to ask Brother Luther to come on up here and bring the uh basket. Brother Brandham taught us that no service is complete without taking up an offering. Amen. Praise the Lord. So this will be your opportunity. Amen. To give as unto the Lord. Now you've already gave coming out tonight. So I'm happy with just that. And and praise the Lord. So we're Oh, is it up here, Brother Luther? Oh, okay. Is that the large one? Is that it'll work. It'll work. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's bow our heads just for a moment of prayer. Lord, how we're grateful to you for this evening, Lord. these wonderful songs and fellowship and testimonies. And Lord, we are looking now for the continuation. Now, we have one more part tonight, Lord, and then we have a fellowship planned and then we're right back tomorrow. We we have teaching and preaching, Lord, and more singing. And this has just been a whole weekend dedicated to you, Lord, moving among your people. We're trusting, Father, that you have been delighted to be among us tonight as we have to be here with you and each other. Now, masters, we take up this special love offering it, Lord, it'll it'll certainly go. We'd like to help all of these singers, especially the ones who have come from distance, Lord. And if we can't do nothing but put gas in their car, not one of them asked for it, but Lord, we'd like to help them out. We're sure grateful for them coming. and we ask for your blessing upon this offering as we take it up in your name in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord. We're gonna have brother Tim come around. Brother Tony's going to lead us in a song as we transition to Brother Tim. You still you still good to go? Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Tim is going to sing and testify and and preach. And he said, "Wait a minute." He said, "I thought I was preaching tomorrow." I said, "Well, you know, you know what I mean, sing, testify." I said, "Just do that. just just do that Timberette thing. And he said, "Okay, I got it." I said, "If you just do that Timberette thing." I said, "What I see anytime I'm watching you online, then we'll be plenty happy." Amen. Brother Anthony, lead us in a song. Come on, brother Tim. Amen. Transition over here. I have a maker. He formed my heart before even time began. My life was in his day. He knows my name. [Music] He knows my every thought. He sees me that falls and he hears me when I call. I have a father. [Music] He calls me his [Music] own. He'll never leave me. No matter where I go. He knows. He knows my thoughts. He sees me when I call and he hears me when I call. You may be seated. Praise the Lord. I asked brother Jason, can I get out of them, too? So now I can't play in all these chords these guys play in. I'm G, C, and D and that's it. They playing F sharp, minor, this, that, and the other. I don't know where they going. But do you love him? Let's try. We didn't try this today, but I told you how I am. Give me Genny, I'm going to sing one of your songs if that's okay with you. We've all been touched by songs we've heard. There's none had me on my face like do you know grace it's marvelous and amazing. Heard it said many different ways. Capstone's going to come forth crying [Music] grace. Oh, but have you heard rapture and [Music] grace? I'm not talking about an alter call. I'm talking of leaving this place. Only the chosen Lord's going to [Applause] take. No one's going to make it. That rapture and grace. Can you believe all the people talking saying they know the Lord? They all say he's coming soon. They believe the word. Won't it be a great disappointment? See that horrid look on their face when they realize they missed that prophet with a message of grace. Oh, but have you heard of rapture and grace? I'm not talking about an alter call. I'm talking of leaving this place. Only the chosen the Lord's going to take. No one's going to make it without rapture and grace. Oh, but have [Music] [Applause] you rapture and grace? I'm not talking about just an article. I'm talking of leaving this place. Only the chosen Lord's going to [Applause] take. No one's going to make it. Out of rapture and grace. No one's going to make it. Out of rapture and grace. [Music] [Applause] [Music] I believe that. Do you believe that? Oh, he's wonderful. Ain't he? I've got songs laid out here, but I don't never go by what's on this thing here. So, we'll just, uh, give you a couple of songs and then we'll we'll let you go eat. How about that? So, uh, but it's good to be here, man. You guys can and y'all forgive me for saying guys and gals, I'm in the South. I know they're brothers and sisters, but I'm just My wife told me the other day, she said,"Tim, you say guys and gals." She said, 'Th that's your brothers and sisters. I said, 'I know it is.' I said, 'But I'm Southern. These guys and gals can play and sing, man. Brother Man, you are so You can do it, too. I I don't even want to sing behind you, man. Man, Brother Wes is just He's got away with the anointing. And Tony, he's watching in and Jesus is going to get you, boy. He was supposed to be here with me and I was supposed to be backing him up, but he uh couldn't get him to come. It's hard to get him out of Anderson. So, but I'm here and you just have to put up with me for a couple hours and maybe an hour in the morning. Then I'll I'll go back to South Carolina. Well, I'm still in South Carolina, ain't it? I'm used to being at Happy Valley, so I still call it Happy Valley. Give me Jesus. Out on the waters, storms raging high. The waters around them were troubled that night. fear feel their hearts for they thought they would die. They failed to remember that the master was nigh and he spoke the words and the winds all stood still. Even the waters they obeyed his will. calm their storms like he will yours and mine. If I just remember that he lives deep inside. So why should you worry? Why should you fear? Very same Jesus said he stays always near. He lives in my heart and he hears me when I cry. I'll call on his name till the storm passes [Music] by. We read in the Bible where he walked with them. brought light to the darkness when the way seemed so dim. How great it would be to have his footsteps in mind just to walk with the master all the time. And when trials come and this seems so nigh, I'll call on the master. He'll be there right on time. And when sickness comes and my body heals in pain, all that I've got to do is call his name. Oh, why should you worry? Oh, why should you fear? When the very same Jesus said he sings so near, he lives in my heart and he hears me when I cry. I'll call on his name when the storm passes by. Oh, we read in the Bible how he walked with them. He brought light to the darkness when the way seemed so dim. How great it would be to have his footsteps in mind all the time. And when trials come and this seems so nice, call on the master. I know he'll get there right on time. When sickness comes and your body is in pain, all you got to do is call his name. So why should you worry? Why should church you fear? The very same Jesus said his days always near. He lives in my heart and he hears me when I cry. I'll call on his name till the storm passes by. I'm going to call on his [Music] name. Let's just call on his name. [Applause] I'm going to call on his name till the storm passes [Music] [Applause] by. Oh my. Why is it so hard to do that? Why is it so hard to call upon his name? As brother Wes said, every demon, every spirit is fighting you. He can't stand it cuz you're here. He can't stand it cuz you're sitting here. He hates it. But every one of you overcome. Every one of you, if you didn't overcome but one quarter of an inch, you overcame. People wants to overcome in boundaries and japs and leaps. It doesn't happen that way. Every now and then that's that. It does. He tells Moses, he said, "You'll take the land. You're going to get it." But brother Jason, he said, "You'll get it little by little." You know what the word little by little means? hardly even notice. They took the land and didn't even realize they was taking it. You're going to make a rapture and you don't even realize you're going to do it. Sure, we say, "Glory to God, I'm ready for the rapture. I'm going to make it. God called me. I'm elected. I'm chosen. I'm predestinated." But yet, there's still something inside of you still questions it. It's called humanity. But yet God said, "You're going to make it if you stay with my word. If you stay with this end time word, if you stay with this message, there ain't nothing out there. Where where are they going to? There's nothing out there. My why in the world would you leave this to go out there and hear nothing. [Music] Let's give him a hand clap of praise. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. I want to say I thank my two good friends here, Brother Lee, Sister Ly. They came down this morning to be in service with us. They go to church there. They live in Simpsonville. We They've been at church what, a little over a year now, brother? Something like that. And man, they are good people. And I I appreciate them being down here in service with us today. My son was supposed to been down here and uh his wife got very sick last night, so she's been in the bed two days. So, he's stuck with me. Let's try C. Yes. She was a virgin bride to be. And one night as she lay quietly, the spirit of the Lord overshadowed her. Said, "You'll conceive a child that sin cannot defile." She said, "Be it unto me according to thy word." And she kept these things and pondered them deep within her heart. She believed in God. When he said, "There's something new about to start." Oh, if that word can be born in [Music] Mary, well, it certainly can be born in you and me. Now we're that virgin bride to be saved through the blood of Calary. And in this time of darkness, we have [Music] come. We've received the vindicated word that we all have heard. And I can see it being born in you and me. Cuz we've kept these things and pondered them deep within our hearts. We stayed with the words. Ever one time feel desires to depart. Oh yes, that word can be born in Mary and it certainly can be born in you and me. Now I'm that virgin bride to be. I'm saved through the blood of Calvary. And in this time of darkness, we have come. We've received a vindicated word. Oh, the bride all has heard. And now being born in you and me. We kept these things and ponder them deep in our hearts. We've stayed with that [Applause] [Music] word. Never one time felt desires to depart. Oh yes, the word can be born in Mary. I can see it being born in you and me. Oh yes, that word can be born in Mary. I see it being born in you and [Music] [Applause] me. Oh my. Aren't you glad that it's being born? And you are producing something that the world can't produce. The church world can't produce. Can I go a step further? There'll be a lot of message churches never produce it. If you think you just you're going to be bride because you believe Brother Brandham was a prophet. Nuh-uh. The devil knows he was a prophet cuz he met him many times. Amen. Amen. He knew when he met him, he was up against something different than all these other guys. It's the same with the body of Christ. He knows when he's met a part of the bride. There's something different about her. She don't talk the way the other people talk. She don't live the way the other people live. She don't act like the world. There's something different about her. And when he meets you, he knows he's met something greater than what he is. Why? Cuz Jesus Christ, the son of God, greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. Hallelujah. That's where we're at today. That's where we stand today. We've got we've just seen a great prophecy produced. And that's not all of it. There's a couple of more phases of that. But if that came to pass, there's not a doubt, Brother Jason, the rest of it will come to pass. Glory to God. I say, come on, Lord Jesus. Even so, Lord come. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Ain't he wonderful? Oh, brother Jason, there's something about this message. There's something about the voice. As I told my church Sunday, Wednesday, there's something about the voice. When that prophet speaks, something happens. I had a brother to tell me the other day, came visit my church from Georgia. It's been several times. He said, "Brother Tim," he said, "I'll lay in the bed at night and I'll listen to Brother Brown. I'm just sat there." He says, and I hear his voice going over and over. He said, "I have a 12-year-old son." He's in the other room in his bed. He said, "If I go a night and I don't play the tape," he said, "my 12 year old boy will say, "Daddy, will you play that that Brother Brandham tape there? Just something about his voice." 12 years old. Why? There's something in it. Jesus came to earth and had a voice. Well, Jason, you should never ask me to sing and testify and sing and preach cuz I don't want to sing no more. I told my church, I said, "When Jesus came to earth, I've been preaching on the kingdom with you, Sister Lily. Brother Lee, I'm not going to preach it again because y'all done heard months of it. But but Jesus said, "The kingdom's in you." And Jesus tried to teach his disciples and his people where the kingdom was. In Matthew 6, he said, "This is when you pray. I want you to pray, Our Father, which are in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven." Jesus comes down to the earth and Jesus walks on the earth. And if you watch Jesus, Jesus don't go forth working with his hands. He don't go forth doing this, that, and the other. But what does he do? He begins to use his voice. Amen. And he goes and here's a sick person. And he uses his voice. We find him out on the sea. They're all scared. The boat's rocking this way. Brother Jason, up and down. The the disciples are scared to death. They're so frightened. They run down there and Jesus has got his head laid up on a pillow. He's probably got one of those my pillows. Jesus, do you care that we perish? What was Jesus saying? If you go back to the scriptures, you'll find Jesus was teaching them and preaching, trying to get them to understand this is what I want y'all to do. Great. How many knows when Jesus died and resurre rose and resurrected? Jesus didn't raise with the keys to the kingdom. He rose the keys to death, hell, and the grave. He didn't have the keys to raise with them. He had done gave them to Peter. St. John 6. He done gave them to Peter. Now he's trying to teach the men and and even the women of that day that was following him. This is what I want you to do. I want you to bring what was there down upon the earth. I'm come now. I'm here now. I'm God in flesh. St. John 1:14. I am I am God himself. In him dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily. But I want you to do what was there. So I'm here showing you what to do. That's the problem. Why don't we see that today? Amen. The bride is a different folk. And Jesus said, "I'm teaching you this." And they go to the bottom of the boat and they go get him. And he comes up there. Brother Jason, the Bible says, the Bible says that Jesus puts one foot up on the bow. Peace. And he looks at the disciples. He says, 'Oh, ye a little faith. Didn't say they didn't have no faith. It said had little [Music] faith. Brother Jason, he could have looked at them and he could have said, "Guys, what you've seen me be doing, this is what I want you to be." Why? Because he said, "My will on earth as it is in heaven." Why? Cuz now the kingdom has now made its way down through the earth. So now where is the kingdom? It's within you. Yes, sir. You have the ability to speak. You have the ability cuz you are the voice for the final age. The west where why ain't the people preaching it? Why ain't they teaching their church this? This is a going to be a part of how you get out of here with your voice. You're not going to work your way out of here. You've got to speak. [Music] I'll shut [Music] up. Sometimes I fall to my knees and pray. [Music] Come Jesus come. Let the day be the day. [Music] Sometimes I feel like I'm going to [Music] break, but I'm holding on to a hope that won't fade. Oh, hallelujah. Come Jesus, come. We've been waiting so [Music] long for the day he return to heal every hurt and write every wrong. We need you right [Music] now. Come and turn this around. Deep down I know world isn't home. Come Jesus come. Come Jesus come. Well, there will be no wars and there's going to be no change when Jesus come. Lord, let the day be the [Music] day he'll come for the weak. And the strong just the same. And all that [Music] believe in the power of his name. Oh, come Jesus come. We've been waiting so long for the day he return to heal every hurt, write every wrong. We need you right [Music] now. Come and turn this around. [Music] Deep down we know world isn't home. Would you come Jesus [Music] come? Come Jesus come. We're one day he'll [Music] come and we'll stand face to face. Come and lay it all down cuz it could be today. Well, the time is right now. Oh, there's no need to wait for your past will be washed. by the rivers of grace. Oh, come Jesus, come. We've been waiting so [Music] long for the day he returned. Heal every hurt, write every wrong. We need you right [Music] now. Come and turn this around. Deep down we know the world isn't home. Come Jesus, come home. Come Jesus, come. Oh, I love this verse. One day he's going to come and we going to stand face to face. Come and lay it all down. church. It could be today. Well, the time is right [Music] now. No need to wait. Your past will be washed. Aren't you glad? Oh, yes it will. By the rivers of his grace. [Music] Oh, come Jesus, come. We've been waiting so [Music] long for the day you return. Heal every hurt. Ride every [Music] wrong. We need you right now. Won't you come turn it around? Deep down we know the world isn't home. Come Jesus [Music] come. Come Jesus come. Would you come Jesus come? [Music] Come Jesus, come. [Music] [Applause] That's what I want. I want him. I know he's here. I believe he's here. I believe the word's been revealed. But I believe, Brother Jason, he's coming. He's coming to get a bride. He's coming in a physical to get a bride. We'll meet him in the air. You know what's so great though, Brother said right there when he comes, that little funny feeling comes over you. He says, and he comes, he said in the grave, he said, "God will allow you for a moment of time to see your loved ones." You ever read that? Yes, sir. Brother said God will only give you a little space there to see cuz you'll wonder who made it. See, you're going you're in the transition. You're in the transition. He said when you get there, he said when you see him, brother said God don't want your mind nowhere but on him. Hallelujah. I love him. Don't you? Is that enough? [Music] You're not a God created by human hands. You're not a God dependent on any mortal man. You're not a God in need of anything that we can give by your plan. That's just the way it is. You're not a God created by human hands. You're not a God dependent on any mortal man. You're not a God in need of anything that we can give by your plan. Sing it with me. That's just the way it is. Oh, you are God alone from before time began. You are on your throne. You are God alone. And right now in the good times and bad you are on your throne. You are God alone. Listen now. You're the only God whose power a none can contend. You're the only God whose name and praise will never end. You're the only God who's worthy of anything that we can give by your plan. And that's just the way it is. [Music] Oh, you are God alone from before time begin. You are on your throne. You are alone.

He was going to get on an airplane and he goes to the the airport and he has one certain plane that he charters every time he flies. So he charters the plane. He goes gets on his plane. He does his flight. He stays where he was flying from Dallas. He gets off the next week. He's got to fly it back. The plane's already chartered. So he calls them, says everything's ready to go. And they said, "Oh, Mr. Brown, sir, we're sorry." Said, "The flight that you the plane that you always charter, we made a mistake. That plane's done been chartered out. You can't get it." He didn't get mad. I'd got mad if you used to if you used that's just the way humanity is, brother Wes. And he gets mad. He just says, "Well, could you get me another flight? Get me and my crew home." So he goes gets him another flight, goes back home. During the flight of the ch plane he normally charters, his name was Payne. I can't think of his last name that chartered the plane him and his colleagues during the flight that he was supposed to be on. It goes down, kills everybody on the plane. So he goes home Jesus for me ready. He goes home. He's sitting at his piano and God gives him these words. [Music] Where would I be? You only know. I'm glad you see. Through eyes of love, I was a hopeless case, an empty place if not for grace. Hallelujah. Where would I be? You only know. I'm glad you see through eyes of love. I was a hopeless case. I was an empty place. If not for grace, I love the verse to it. I said, I thank you for the things I cannot see. You've been a shelter in the storms of life, a shield surrounding me. And I thank you for the mercy you provided. And I know you could have walked away, but you stayed a thousand times. Amazing grace. How sweet the sound. I was once lost. Oh, but now I'm found, church. I was a hopeless case. I was an empty place if not for grace. [Music] Precious Lord, lead me on. Take my hand. Just lead me on. I was a holist. I was an empty place if not for grace. [Music] Aren't you grateful for grace tonight when you didn't know? You know, we worship him, brother Jason, as he comes. We worship him. We praise him. God's been so good to us and we just worship him for all he's done. But do we ever wonder, brother, do we worship for what we don't know he's done? When that car should have hit you and it didn't. When you get sleepy and you run off the road and all of a sudden you shake yourself and you get back up and everything, that's not you. That's him. When you're coming to a red a green light and you you looking both ways to see and all of a sudden a car just flies by and you just happen to get stopped. It's his grace. None of us should be here.
