visited Minister now so I gotta kind of earn back the home front is what I feel like Anyway probably not true but sort of what I feel like I've been gone so much and it's been a crazy six months and just thankful to be back at least for a few days anyway and uh we'll be back a little bit longer than that but Just Praise the Lord for his goodness in 2022 and praise the Lord for his goodness that will continue in 2023. amen just like every other year this year is going to have some trials and tribulations and and some tremendous blessings as well and the main the main thing comes down to how we approach it in our attitude towards it and so uh we understand these are things our promised to us in the scriptures very clearly and so give thanks amen and everything give thanks just let that be in your heart I know that's easy to say over the pulpit and to preach about but to have our hearts changed and set in that direction where trials difficulties come and we say thank you Lord I'm so blessed I'm so blessed amen I want to speak on knowing him his life part two I did this in Sunday school before and and just want to continue on the same subject um we'll take prayer requests of course at the end of service and if I don't go too long maybe a testimony or two so uh or opening scriptures in John chapter 17. and it's verse 3. very familiar verse to us all this is Jesus in his prayer of intercession before going to Calvary and in his prayer he says in this his life eternal that they might Know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou ascent amen let's pray Heavenly Father we come before you now Lord and oh we're so thankful that we know you we're so thankful that you've come to us and and you revealed yourself to us and made yourself known in such a supernatural way in our lives Lord and in such a real way on a daily basis father I pray that you'd take the words spoken tonight Lord and write them on our hearts Lord just help us all to rest in your presence Lord and just relax our hearts and minds and receive a blessing and encouragement from from you Lord and a challenge from you as well we we asked Lord that you'd help us to get out of the way understand there's many things going on and all of our lives and and things that were are on our mind but Lord let us just take a a few minutes here to lay those aside Lord we want you to come Lord and take these lips and speak into your people's lives I just submit and surrender myself to you Lord use use me use each one of us as you see fit tonight we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you can be seated in the least expanded translation this verse he says and this is life eternal life namely that they might they might be having an experiential knowledge of you the only genuine God and of him you sent on a mission Jesus Christ and I just want to take a moment to emphasize on that portion having an experiential knowledge of you I I find that whole phrasing fascinating because it's not uh it's not looking at a past tense or just a moment but it's a ha it's having that's a process right having and so if you're going to have the knowledge knowing of God it's an experiential it's something that you experience in your own personal life him changing you him transforming you him living in your life and it's not just a momentary thing it's not at the camp meeting it's not at the Revival it's not at the tremendous uh services that we have but it's on a on a daily basis through the grind through the difficulties through the trials that you get in experiential knowledge of him and it's not enough to have it past tense in a moment I I know I knew him no I know him I I am knowing him I think I think I think of myself sometimes you can come to a place where you feel like you know the message has been revealed and you study and you see things and you feel like oh my the Lord's really helped me to know so many different things and you don't say that in Pride but just in thankfulness oh I'm getting to the hook then you come to reach a point many times in your life and say Lord what's happening I don't understand what is taking place circumstances in life leave me feeling like I'm in in darkness and confusion and you say Lord I'm extending my hand Lord where are you I can't find you oh that's the that's the humbling down that the Lord does you I'm extending my hand where are you and he says I'm holding you I'm holding you oh you're holding me yes you are that's what the word says you can know a lot about God but you can know God very little that's an important distinction to make knowing facts about God from the Bible absolutely encourage everyone to know your Bible from Genesis to Revelation backwards and forwards every part of it you should feed on it you should fill your mind with it continually and you should remember as you're reading it that's Limited we are limited and knowing this book on a human level is limited but God is unlimited and so we know him by we understand this this is message 101 you know him by spiritual revelation not by figuring out who God is we want to bring up that PowerPoint Brother Brad not not by and go to the next screen he said well you just don't know your Bible I said well that may be so but I know the author real well I said that's it you know it doesn't say to know his book but to know him his life see Satan knows his word but to know him the author of the word see brother Brandon is not telling you don't know your Bible and he's not even really telling you he doesn't know the Bible the other fella was telling brother Branham he didn't know his Bible it's not a fact he did know the Bible and brother Branham never encouraged he's not using this quote to encourage ignorance of your Bible what is he what is he saying though get it in the right order you you can know a lot of facts about your Bible and be so twisted up in theology that you don't know anything about God or let's bring it to this you can be so twisted up in message Doctrine from this group and this group and this group and never have come to know God personally know the author first know him by Supernatural Revelation something that's on the inside of the inside it's it's it's it's it's not I miss this portion and I don't want to miss miss it it's not just knowing him at a special meeting or when you feel really good about things everybody get that out of your mind wonderful to have a great service wonderful to shout and dance in the service I want to do it more and more and more and more and more but what about when you're feeling is so low what if what about when you're at home and the kids are driving you crazy and the spouse is driving you crazy and you're driving yourself crazy what about then do we know him do we slip aside and say Lord give me strength in this moment because you can you can be the greatest dancer and Runner around the church but without knowing him personally in your soul it means nothing it's a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol it's a continual Fellowship of knowing god more and more and deeper and deeper and it's a burning passion that follows you every day every morning and it continues birthing itself out of you and it's up and down and there's lots of up and downs and there's lots of times where the passion is lower and the passion is higher but there's passion there's passion in your whole mind and your whole heart is on the Lord continuously you you might be struggling you might be suffering but you're thinking about God God where are you at in this where am I at in this that's where your heart is it's not about you got it all figured out on every in every circumstance and every place God has so fixed our life that we have to trust in him that he does things that causes us to say what what is happening why is this happening and we have to trust him we have to say Lord I believe who you are I believe in what you're doing believe your word is true that's why faith is the key it's not knowledge knowledge only goes so far knowledge can take you real far and then the next thing you know you're what what happens to your knowledge when it's that is challenged when God doesn't act according to your theology in your own human life when God does things that disappoint you what are you preaching about this guy because I'm I've been there and we've all been there God will do things and you'll be disappointed in what you think God was supposed to be doing and you'll be upset and you'll be frustrated and be mad let's just be real with each other that's why knowledge will only take you so far you've got to have a submissive heart you've got to come to that place when all your knowledge runs out and you say I have no idea what's happening right now and I don't know why it's happening you say Lord I bow my head and I bow my knees and say I trust you it's easy to trust the Lord at the Youth Camp it's fun it's wonderful it's great that's only once a year it's easy to trust God at the special meetings a couple times a year if you're if you're blessed and fortunate to be able to be at them you got to trust God every day you've got to trust him in those moments where you have no idea what's happening or why it's happening why did God create us why did he make us why are we here God created man and his purpose was for us to know him and as a result worship him that's a very simplified view every denomination would agree with that goes even further than that God by his very nature had attributes within himself one are attributes of who he is as a person secondarily he has attributes which are his elected seed it's what we call him his predestinated seed and he wanted to express both of these attributes he wanted to express the attributes of who he is to the attributes of who he's becoming foreign so the attributes of who he is he's a father he's a savior he's a Healer he's he's just etc etc etc we go down that list I've preached about that before he wants us to know him not just as a fact of lists but in our personal daily life he wants his attributes to come to know his attributes of who he is so his elected seed need to come forth to manifestation who he is needs to come forth to manifestation who he is needs coming forth to a manifestation cannot do so unless you and I come forth to see him manifested so we seeing him manifested fulfills what God wanted to fulfill in his heart for all eternity you you yourself are eternal the thought that he has about you didn't change he didn't come in time and say okay I'm looking out and see I'll choose that one and over this one over here and that one over here you were his life you were in him you were a part of him he saw you every detail I'm gonna get ahead of myself I'm gonna stop there and he wants us to know him by experience by revelation of the word and then by experience in our life it's not enough to know that God had Doctrine perfectly we know have to know the god of the godhead Doctrine personally right he's made it clear he revealed the truth of the godhead in this day so we know him positively and according to scripture wonderful you could have that perfectly lined up from Genesis to revelation great start fantastic I never discourage you from having to from having correct doctrine of God but don't stay right in that position get to know that God on a personal level foundational level on a daily basis remember it's having experiential knowledge of him it's a process it's continual it's daily and that's where he wants us that's where worship that's why there's only one provided place of worship right because it's his attributes worshiping him his him in the manifestation of his attributes you can follow me that's that's complicated on so many levels but as message Believers I think you got it we his attributes must see him in his attributes of who he is just righteous etc etc and not just in a book got to see it in the book it's all based on that book but it's got to come and we've got to see it day by day in our life and then from that worship Him when things look contrary to that we worship him anyways in our mind we think how is this consistent with God's attributes you say God you are true though every man is a liar I trust you and I believe you I know you see then from the beginning I'm confused by this thing that's happening that's all right that's all right let's keep walking let's keep going forward and that's the that's the whole scripture I just I just brought to you the whole Plan of Redemption the whole Plan of Salvation and God's whole purpose for us in our lives let's make it clear Philippians 3 verse 10. do we have somebody back there who is pulling up a scripture AWOL Brother Brad Philippians 3 10 old school get out your Bible the three of you that have it if you don't have a Bible get your phone and pull up Philippians 3 10. we're going to spend some time on this all right that I may know him and the power of his resurrection wonderful that's not the whole verse I kind of wish it was because the other part is is difficult and Paul and Paul you know I wish you would have for listening Paul I wish you would have left this part last part off but we would have a major problem if we did if God could have made a better world for his attributes to live in he would have right in order for God to express himself and to express the nature of his attributes there needed to be evil to bring out the very best from himself and to bring the very best out from us his their needed to be evil exist God will never be able to express the fullness of his nature without evil existing and combating against him you will never be able to express the fullness of the nature that God made you to be without troubles and trials and Evil coming into your life Adam knew God in power even in the garden he could speak and it would just come he could adjust nature just by his spoken word but it wasn't enough God had to bring a test it wasn't random there was there wasn't just a random thing that he put the true trees in the midst of the garden I know those aren't literal trees but you know what I'm saying it wasn't random that God made a serpent that could walk on two feet that could communicate that could reason and that could put a seed inside of Eve God made it thus God made an angel that could fall in Pride and he did fall in Pride and he rebelled against God and everything that God is then that angel took on a form that was possible to take on through the serpent brought forth Cain brought forth sin and evil into the world through the human race God made Adam Eve in such a way she could be deceived he made Adam so that he would take her back and throw the whole world into sin God did that purposefully he ordained that that would be that way because that is the best world for him to express himself in and through if he could have made it bad if it would have been better to stay Eden the whole time we'd still we'd be in Eden but it wasn't God's purpose for us to be in Eden he put a test there and he puts a test in all of our lives and that's his purpose in order to bring out all that he is and all that you are it would never happen in Eden couldn't happen in Eden so this idea that that of Pros the Prosperity Gospel and you just you just give and God is a vending machine you put money in and you know put a dollar in a hundred dollars comes out and so on and so forth sometimes God will do that many times God says thank you that's in your account in heaven you'll see it later and it's multiplying sometimes you give and give and give and then you get kicked in the teeth it's true God's purpose is for those things because he's going to bring out of you the very very best fragrant beautiful odor to express him Adam knew him in power he could speak to Creation it would obey him he was innocent he wasn't mature he was still in a position of being in innocence he he wasn't perfect sinless yes but not mature and so he took the testing and trial and and and and and all that went with it to produce it was a God God wanted it to produce maturity knowing and ordaining that he would fall because he had a greater maturity that needed to be produced all right again I want to emphasize God this is the very best world God could make to express himself through you say oh there's so much sin how can you say that all the evil and terrible things that go on okay all right we'll go down that road for a second of philosophy because let's let's call that what it is it's philosophy it's using using human logic to try to disprove what the word of God clearly tells us right philosophy says how could God be good if evil exists how could there be evil according to what you've said if God doesn't exist because if there is something that's bad there has to be a lawgiver that defines what is good and bad God created you and I in such a way that we are constantly judging between good and evil the the the the biggest atheist and the filthiest sinner is judging between good and evil it's usually perverted understanding what good and evil is but nevertheless they're judging between good and evil they've got it usually flipped around but they're still they're judging you for being evil because you say they're evil is perverted say they're a bunch of perverts homosexuals and uh gender bending idiots it's evil it's flat out it's it's flat out evil and now I said that I am evil and I should be canceled you know this is what this is the this is the world it but it shows within themselves their excuse inexcusable as the Bible says o man thou that judges for you that judge or you condemned yourself you're doing the very same things you're claiming others to do so he placed that conscience between good and evil so that we would judge according to that therefore there's a lawgiver there's a God that created everything so we're still back in the place that there's good and there's evil well how can God do that who are you that replies against God that's Paul's answer shall the thing for him say to him that formed it why have you made me thus hath not the Potter power over the clay to make one of the same lump one vessel into honor and one unto dishonor yes God has the right to do that and he has done it and he is he says behold I create good and I create evil God is not responsible for evil he's not personally responsible for evil the devil is and we are yet he he made it this world in such a way that there would be evil there he did that on purpose because that is the best way to manifest himself and manifest his life in you and through you I don't want you to lose that point it's so important when we're looking at all of this it's not it's not about having an easy perfect life I'm blessed I am blessed but the question is when you're down when this when when when the troubles are there when you can't pay your bills on time when you can't do what you want to do because you're struggling are you blessed then to still are you you believe that you are I believe that I am contrary to all sight and vision and what my life is telling me whatever it might be I believe that I am blessed because God's word said so and not only that I feel that in my heart I'm not just saying that I feel that in my heart genuinely God knows the ones that are his second Timothy 2 19 I'm going to read that quickly nevertheless the foundation of God's stand is sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his he knows he knows who belongs to him I think that's even better than knowing him the greatest thing in All My Life Is Knowing him but even the better best thing in my life is him knowing me because many people know about God and they can be confused and think that they have a personal relationship and know God but as a whole completely different thing to say brother Chris God knows me how can you say that well let me tell you let me walk you through my life let me tell you my testimony let me tell you what happened yesterday and the day before and what's happening today he knows me that's the best that's the greatest thing he knows them that are his and the worst words you can imagine depart from me you that work iniquity I never knew you they knew plenty about him because they were casting out devils in his name I knew a lot about him but they didn't know him and he says I didn't know you oh sure he knew the fact that they exist but he didn't know them personally and intimately and didn't call he didn't call them mm-hmm so back to the scripture I didn't get to this point that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of I never even finished reading the the verse did I and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death so if we just know him in the power of his resurrection we don't know him in fullness what if you just know the power you don't know the fullness Adam knew God in power but he did not know the fullness you have to join him in the fellow that's my God that's why I was making that point about evil to know God in fullness you want to go who wants to know God in fullness who believes that the message restores it back to us our capability to know him in fullness I believe that with all my heart then you need the fellowship of his sufferings and being made conformable unto his death there's where you'll know him in fullness Jesus was made perfect by the things that he suffered didn't say Jesus was made perfect by the power that dwelt within him says he was made perfect by the things that he suffered he needed the power I'm not saying we don't need to know him in the power if we don't we don't we only know part of it that's part of it but we need the other part to complete it to be made perfect to be made brought to full maturity by the things that we suffer and when we do that we're made conformable to his death then his life is that power is manifested in fullness through us and so again we we know God he's revealed himself to us you've seen his hand in your life but the best part of that is him knowing you Psalm 139 spoke about it last time but there's just so much there Psalm 139 and verse 1. we got it okay great oh Lord thou has searched me and known me thou knowest my down sitting and mine uprising now understandeth my thought afar off so David is not trying to make a fancy speech about God's omniscience omnipotence and omnipresence right David knows that we know that God is omnipotent we know he's omniscient we know he's omnipresent this isn't a theological phraseology that's being brought forth this is a man who is speaking of what he has had revealed in his personal life he's not bringing out a fact a list of gods who God is he's saying this is who I know oh Lord you have searched me and known me this is something that's precious you know you know when I sit down you know when I stand up you understand my thought afar off I think what this means is God isn't afar off I think what it means is youth understand my thoughts long long long long long long before I ever have them thou compassest my path the word compasses literally means to winnow you Widow my path what does that mean it means god is is sifting out every step that you take your whole he's he's another way you would say it in a simple way is he's planning it you plan my path um and my line down and are acquainted with all my ways think about that God knows all your he knows your idiosyncrasies he knows you're good the good about you the bad about you he knows the nature that you have he knows every single intimate detail he knows you better than you know yourself then you think you know yourself every detail for there is not a word in my tongue but O Lord thou knowest it all together that's both encouraging and it challenging at the same time look at this thou Hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me so he's planned your way and to be beset behind him before it means somebody says in front of you and somebody's behind you and it's God God is in front of you and he's behind you he's planned the way he's winnowed it he's furrowed things he's he's prepared everything just right he's put Hedges of thorns there for you to run into and and for pain to come and difficulties at trials he's put all of those things everything everything that you've gone through every path that you've gone you can't say well I got off the beaten path there I I really uh went the wrong direction well what do you did maybe was wrong but God planned your way don't don't think that you can over you're going to overpower God's plan you're not going to now that doesn't mean that many times we do things that are sinful that are wrong and we have to repent and yet it was it was planned that way come on this is David speaking what did David do things that we don't even want to talk about in front of our children the Bible is open and plain about it adultery and murder and these different things and it's terrible and God ordained that to be that way God didn't commit the evil and he didn't force David to do it David wanted to do it that's not it but God ordained that for David's life so it would be in the Bible so that we would see it and know it and be warned by it and not only that Solomon came and the whole line all the way to Jesus and so God worked intimately in that terrible mistake that was made and laid thine hand upon me so maybe it's great he plans it he sets us behind him before and then he puts his hand right upon us you believe that that's your life don't take this as a great theological point is this your life such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high I cannot attain unto it look at look at this statement it's I mean I I guess you look at it and one say why is it confusing to think that God or difficult to understand God's ordained my path he's there in front of me behind me has his hand upon me because David lived in a life full of mess-ups and mistakes and he knew his own heart his own weakness and that's why it just you know this this this verse is uh you know if you put it in modern kids talk it's the the mind-blown Emoji how is it this is incredible how is it possible I can't hope to figure this all out in my lifetime it'll take all of eternity wither shall I go from thy spirit or wither shall I flee from thy presence now why would you want to do that there's times in our lives where we get to the place where we're doing that no no no no no no no not any of you guys but me me I do you guys are strong I'm I'm a little weak sometimes we all get to that place where we feel like what am I what am I doing I'm just done I'm just gonna run if I send what's even more incredible as we go forward you'll see this if I stand up into heaven you're there we knew that if I make my bed in hell behold you are there to me when I see this as how much God's presence is a attached to his predestinated seed wherever you go he's going with you yeah I love this next part if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea oh Jonah even there shall thy hand be near me be around me it says actually lead him so here you have a man saying I am going to run from God he says takes off and starts running and God's going okay you're running but I'm leading you there I was already leading you there and more than that is my right hand is holding you the right hand is the hand of blessing and mercy so his right hand is whole so Jonah says I am not going to those Wicked Sinners I'm going the other way and God's has him right in his hand he's there in the boat he's the he's there in the storm he's there in the water he makes a fish God was there the whole time Jonah did Sin mm-hmm Jonah suffered because of his sin and God ordained that Jonah would run from him and God ordained that there would be a protection for Jonah even at the same time while his wrath was bubbling forth towards him that doesn't make sense preacher it doesn't need to make sense who are you that's replying against God it doesn't have to make sense it is a fact it is scripture it is this is David's experience running from God running running away and realizing while he's running he's just on a treadmill in God's hand and God's carrying for carrying him forward this should be the greatest thing that you're hearing this is so phenomenal this is so encouraging to me to know all my ups and downs and my my failures and my failings that God ordained it to be for a purpose even there shall I when I'm running I mean don't don't divorce that from the context if I take where where will I run where will I run to your hand will lead me there and your right hand will hold me I'm not encouraging you to sin I am not encouraging you to run away from God it hurts it hurts sometimes he leads us to those hurts for an eternal purpose that we will understand better by and by if I say surely the darkness shall cover me I mean sometimes we think crazy thoughts don't we even the night shall be light about me have you ever been in that in a dark place in your life and you think I don't have any faith I don't have anything I'm I'm I'm done I'm a goner and and the Lord says even the night is light about me about me about me isn't that beautiful yay the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shines as the day the darkness and the light are both the light to thee for thou Hast possessed my Reigns you've created my kidneys is what that means literally kidneys was another way of speaking about the innermost thoughts feelings Hearts feelings and intents of the Mind so not only he he doesn't only know them but he created the very nature that produces those thoughts those feelings etc etc so God formed us he formed the very nature that you are in this very flesh the good things and the bad things and the and by all of it is there to express something very specific in and through your life you have covered me in my mother's womb so that's speaking speaking of I don't know all the terminology anymore but all the the the gooey stuff that's in the in the womb and the the bags of waters I think that's the word for God has covered you he's taken such care that he's he's covered you in the in your mother's womb don't don't take that well he does that for everybody this is for me God covered me when I was still in my mother's womb God was covering me and he was CR he was creating my kidneys literally and figuratively he was there I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made that's for every single person here and God doesn't make any mistakes he made you exactly the way you are and he did it with reverence God himself had reverence for what he was doing in your mother's womb he revered what he was doing in in your mother's womb marvelous this is David hey David just calm down a little bit about yourself marvelous it's the truth because it's for all of us marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well all right God didn't come to build your self-esteem he came to build himself up in and through you but if you want to feel good about yourself reads Psalm 1 139 and understand that it's written about you so no matter what you think you look like in the mirror or what is you think might be lacking God has made you individually marvelous reverently and it's and it's marvelous in his sight does your soul know that right well well the devil is totally against godliness and the devil is totally against us looking at the right level right Satan wants you to be thinking about well I feel really down about myself self myself is self self self self self self and self self self why your eyes are on yourself but not according to God's word according to the worldly standards according to what the devil says to you instead of looking in the mirror of God's word that says God formed me and shaped my very nature from my mother's womb I'm reverently and wonderfully made and I'm marvelous that's what God's word says young ladies when the devil's telling you something different God's word says you're marvelous and you're fearfully and wonderfully made and David says my substance verse 15. was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the Earth from the very beginning that God made it made brought together a sperm and an egg to make an embryo that started growing and that whole process God was there shaping every aspect of it now you say that was just nature it'll do it okay that might be true for most of the world but for the predestinated seed God I believe that this is not this is speaking about the seed of God you say nature does that maybe but I I believe in the seed of God that God is there overseeing the whole process and he's watching over that and there's an angel there right there and God is God is there by his presence watching over every aspect and making sure everything happens perfectly exactly the way he wants to bring it to pass Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect it means not fully formed and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them God has taken such care about every aspect about you that he has literally written every one of every one of your members every part of your body Soul and Spirit is written down in a book before the foundation of the world before you were ever created for all of eternity this was written in a book every single detail and he doesn't just set in an order but he comes and makes sure that every detail is taken care of perfectly in you so his predestinated scene are going to turn out with precision the way he wants them to turn out how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o God how how great is the somehow vast is the sum of them okay how how many three thousand how many thoughts does God have about you don't lose track of this you guys how many thoughts does God have about you and your life what meticulous planning has God paid for your life for every detail well I made a wrong turn here I don't believe you did I don't believe you did believe God has you and he's meticulously written out your plan if you weren't supposed to be here tonight listening to me hopefully keep you awake for a few more minutes you wouldn't be here and there's nothing you could do to change that absolutely nothing you can do how many thoughts does he have how vast is the sum of them next verse if I should count them they're more in number than the sand when I awake I am still with thee I mean just fathom that our sand here out at Hunting Island just grabbing it in your hand and start counting and you'll just say this is impossible in in less than one second you'll throw it aside and say it's impossible that's how many thoughts God has about you so do you think that God loves you you think that he cares about you you think that he's taken in is involved intimately in your life does he know does he know you do you know that he knows you we always say do you know that you know that you know him but do you know that he knows you because that's vastly more important because him knowing you is everything Romans 8. verse 28 will start and I think after I've studied this looking at Psalm 139 and then going to Romans 8 I think if you understand these sort of as a two pieces of a puzzle going together it's pretty incredible to see it and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose again this is not merely things just work together for good it is God is working in all things to make them for your good again this goes this will go to the question what is good what is actually good right because if you think that everything going smoothly the mortgage is always paid on time every bill is paid on time um you never get sick you never have struggles you never have trials if you think that's good then that's not what we're talking about and that's not what the word of God is talking about it's that God is taking all things and he's working them for your good so the all things contain things that are evil right so God is taking the things I mean this is this is the story of Joseph what you meant for evil God meant for good and to save lives and so what people meet what the people and the devil means for evil God harnesses that in your life and he turns that around for your Eternal good see that's our problem many times as we're so focused on the things of this life God is trying to prepare a people for a Rapture for a body change to live in eternity right the word is coming to to put us into a new body that will never die and never get sick the body we're in now is going to have all it's going to get sick it's decaying it's in the by the time you reach a certain age you're just in the process of dying right that you're getting older your your your hair is getting gray etc etc that's that's just that's what happens that's what this life is but there's a body that he's preparing that he's sending vitamins for right and I I believe the word is that vitamin but I also believe the trials and difficulties that we Face are also the vitamins if we take them if we take them right if we have the right attitude we can let those vitamins spill out onto the floor that God's sending and then he's going to send more vitamins and he's going to say I'm waiting for you to take him I'm waiting for you to say Thank you Lord thank you you're working in and through this trial and this difficulty it hurts it's not fun deliver me from it you have promises in your word and I'm taking them as more real than what I'm going through here that's how God wants you to take his vitamins now that body is growing and getting stronger and being made ready for us to step into it and God is going to have it ready there's not going to be one of those theophanes and those bodies that God is preparing that is not going to be ready he will be sure to do it because it's his work it's what he's promised to do he's the shepherd so God is working in the things that we might call evil to turn them out for our Eternal good to them who are called called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren so he's gonna he's going he's going to conform us he's four new this word speaks of four ordained for ordaining he's four ordained so he's seen it beforehand and ordained it and he also predestined so he sees it beforehand and then he sets our destiny based on what he's seen beforehand so what is your destiny to be conformed to the image of the firstborn son that's both in your character and nature but also in a body change you'll have a body like unto his glorious body right moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called so here he's going through the process he's pre he's set your destiny beforehand well here's the process he called he calls you who called you the preacher yourself no God called you he presented the gospel before you he opened your heart he filled you with the Holy Ghost them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God before us who can be against us lots of things lots of things are against us thousands of things are against us it seems like day by day but who can effectively be against us to turn God away from us not no one it's impossible he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things if God so ordained that he would send his son and he sacrificed his son gave him up so that he would suffer a terrible death ordained him to that death if God did that is he not going to do everything that is necessary to bring us and get us to where we need to be yes he will that freely give us all things doesn't mean you're going to be rich it means that he'll he will be all that you need who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect tons of demons Satan himself lots of people are doing that but who can do it effectively because it's God that justifies no one could do it effectively who is he that condemns I mean everybody some people in the church are condemning me for preaching this sermon but who can do it effectively no one because it's Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who's even at the right hand of God who also makes intercession for us now I want to ask you a question what point does Paul lay it on you in in these verses it's up to you to get make it there he's laying it all on God through Christ all of it who shall separate us from the love of Christ now let's understand that in the context let's think about Psalm 139 how God plans your path besets you behind and before lays your hand up lays his hand on you even when you're running away from him you're simply in his hand and he's ordaining that for a purpose don't run away from him or unto him and but remember you're in his hand nothing can separate us from the love right you can't separate God has predetermined before the foundation of the world that he's going to love you are you going to change that is someone else going to change that there's no possibility right so who will separate us from the love of Christ all right so now Paul's going to go into some evils shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword we read these words and they really uh disconnect feel like in a way we disconnect ourselves from these things people in the old days went through those things we don't really face that so let's just uh I'm not saying we need to update anything but for our understanding is shall losing your house separate you from the love of Christ so losing your job and losing everything that you have separate you from the love of Christ I mean let's get real famine what's nakedness get some clothes on man I think it means inadequate clothes for the weather thank the Lord we're in South Carolina if you're in when you go back to Minnesota all clothes are inadequate it seems like at least that's what it felt like to me forgot what it was like to go outside and it just hurts those things are not going to separate us I mean Peril sword somebody comes and shoots you is that going to separate you from somebody comes through those doors and kills every one of us is that going to separate us is that going to be saying oh that's a sign that that God didn't love them nonsense it has nothing to do with it oh he couldn't pay his bills on time what a failure God doesn't love him well maybe he is a failure but don't mean God it doesn't change God's love it it absolutely does not we have to get our eyes off of these things and we think of well it's a great blessing sometimes a lot of money is a big curse and so don't we don't don't think that just because somebody's got good in this life they're so blessed well I'd like some of their blessing but you know that's not what means God's love in your life sometimes God brings you through very hard difficult times and the bills can't get paid on time and and um you can't go grocery shopping when you want to and and these different things that you know you feel like you need to do and yet you you can't do them and and God this is God's purpose in your life to try your faith it doesn't mean he doesn't love you it means he does love you and so that this this is so critical because in our day are we we have to be closer over there Enoch was closer over there than he was here so God said just come over here Enoch and so we need to be getting to this condition where our eyes and our heart are fixed in such a way on where God's love is and where our Treasures are so that we can God can just say well you're just closer over here just step on over and so God's working that in our hearts he's going to work it in our hearts and sometimes that means he takes things away and sometimes that means he he he he allows us to be sick and not yield it instantly and and then you know it's it's he allows those things because he wants our eyes to be on eternity and he wants us to be thinking more about sending things on vitamins ahead to that body than on building the Here and Now and being comfortable and things being easy and good in the here and now we all want things to be easy and good they're not going to be they're not going to be until we're over there God has not ordained it to be easy and real smooth now he's ordained that we go through trials through much tribulation we must enter the kingdom as it is written oh Paul why are you quoting this psalm for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter that doesn't I want to be blessed Lord I don't want to be accounted as a sheep for the slaughter this is the blessing this is the blessing and you're we're our eyes are so tied unto this life that we miss these things for thy sake we are every arrow of the devil every flaming Dart of the devil is pointed against us and coming against us and God has ordained that for your life thanks preacher thanks so much I feel great you will after in a minute were killed we're like sheep for the slaughter nay why are these two verses together can you imagine a human being writing this this is God through a messenger speaking truth to us let's not miss this we need to be ready for a body change and we're not going to do it be ready until we see what a real conqueror is you're telling me that someone that goes through tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness Peril and sword is this a conqueror I'm telling you that in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us it isn't you that God is relying on to be a conqueror it's through him that loved you and a conqueror is vastly different than a tyrant of this world sometimes the greatest conqueror in ages past was burned at a stake and God says that's my Overcomer that's my conqueror what how is it possible you're looking at just this life this body will die or it will get changed one or the other and this this life is temporary I mean think about think about what percentage of your life right now is it of Eternity what percentage calculate that for me y'all I need a good calculation Micah you could do it for me you know what it is it's zero percent 50 years of Eternity is zero percent because eternity is infinite it doesn't end there's no ending so your life right now is very short and very small if you finish this life with faith in Christ in your heart you are a conqueror because you've just lost zero percent of your life You're Now set free from a body of sin and death You're Now set free you're now entered the Ring of conquerors the champions the Overcomers there's there's there's no greater one that God looks to it's not the person that is a great conqueror in this life Genghis Khan is a big compared to you guys in God's eyes one of the greatest conquerors in history and God says he's in hell he's he's the fire is eating eating him up and uh polycarp he was burnt for zero percent of his life isn't that beautiful you really think about that this life is a vapor yes and regardless of the trials that you go through when you get over there the first thing that you're going to think is why did I ever worry that's what the prophet told us why did I ever worry we're killed all the day long okay no nope that's what Paul is saying no for the for thy sake we're killed all that no in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us look now because of the because of what he said and because of what he's written four because of these things verse 38 I am persuaded that neither death nor life and our angels or principalities nor powers I mean an angel remember this an angel in just a few moments killed 385 000 member military so we're talking very powerful beings that in an instant can kill hundreds of thousands of people they cannot separate you from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord nor angels nor principalities and our powers and our things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord you believe that nothing can separate you so when we're saying nothing can separate you we hear that quoted but remember the context of the verse it's circumstances and situations and sufferings of this life the very things the devil tries to put in your life to make you doubt make you disbelieve God says that's not going to separate you from my love when are we going to take that when we're going through it and say this won't separate me from the love of God Christ Jesus my Lord can we do that can we take that and be that be the Conqueror you're going to be so let's just take it now that'll change a lot of things if we take it now but God allows God God I love I love I think it was brother brother Dale when he said he was going into the surgery this is a predestinated trial for me and it just just was like a it locked me instantly I said my that's good I'm going to use that forever so this is a predestinated trial for me to overcome in what if you die brother this is a predestinated trial that I have done the ultimate overcoming in again you know we will have a funeral for you and we'll be sad and it'll break our heart and we'll you know cry about it the rest of our lives probably and yet knowing knowing you're rejoicing right and we should be rejoicing with you let's let's have eyes on eternity amen musicians if you'd come I'm just going to read a little bit of a quote as you come it's a very lengthy one brother Brad if you want to bring it up it kind of is a summary of everything that's been said it's from the church ages book Sumerian Church age how how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches as people suffer that is what they asked in Malachi 1 1-3 the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you saith the Lord yet you say wherein hast thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the Lord yet I loved Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountains in his Heritage waste for the dragons of the Wilderness you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because God has chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job this is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled as job said he put strength in US you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered Hebrews 5 8-9 though you were a son he had learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation to all them that obey him in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul wow I just lost it all so I'll look up there uh uh he left has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection why did he want this James 1 2 and 4 my brother encountered all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect an entire wanting nothing why does he stand by the reason is in Romans 8 17-18 and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and set down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to set with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that is what Peter said is it strange that God wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we all have we are all tried and chastened his sons not one but goes through that church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of God Hebrews 12 6 and 8 for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom you receiveth but if you be without chastisement whereof all our partakers then are you bastards and not Sons now this special condition in Smyrna must be applied to every age there is no age free from it there's no True Believer free from it this is of god this is the will of God it is needful we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be christ-like in doing it love suffereth long and is kind Matthew 5 11 and 12 blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you and how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass I love that conducting myself with joy that's a challenge Trials come they're meant to tear you down make you feel weak make you feel depressed that's what the devil has sent them to accomplish but God intends them for good if we'll take them with joy then they'll accomplish the things that they're supposed to accomplish in our lives amen let's stand and pray Heavenly Father we're so thankful we're so thankful for your word Lord I pray that you'd encourage your people by it Lord that you would take it and it be a strengthening to them Lord may it be brought to their remembrance Lord as they go
