but we'll put it back there amen you can obey the Lord as you leave God bless you Exodus chapter 7 this evening amen looking forward to the ministering this thought tonight and I've had it in my notes for a little while just playing a waiting game with the Lord seeing when he wanted to light it up amen praise the Lord glad to be home and uh amen just um had a really nice time amen praise the Lord say more about that maybe at the end when uh we give testimonies I seem to be going in and out brother Brad so do I need to make a switch or okay all right Exodus chapter 7 and um we'll just read three verses and we'll let you be seated however um brother Caleb you just keep that uh scripture up we'll continue reading after we're seated Exodus 7 chapter chapter 7 verse one and the Lord said unto Moses see I have made thee a God to pharaoh and Aaron thy brother shall be thy Prophet Thou shalt speak speak all that I command thee and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh that he send the children of Israel out of his land and I will harden Pharaoh's heart and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt amen let's pray father we thank you for your word this evening and I ask now that you will give us that unction of the spirit Lord for I have much enjoyed preparing this little Wednesday night thought and Lord It's just meant a lot to me and I'm sure that your children will enjoy it Lord as a meal prepared by the king himself now let may you anoint speaker and hearer we commit it to you Lord in jesus' name amen God bless you friends you can be seeded I have a um a few prayer requests tonight that we will get to in a little while so if you're streaming and you have a prayer request you'd like to send in um send it I actually last Wednesday I didn't have uh WhatsApp running and uh but you can I do have it running tonight so you can send it by that send it directly to me amen or by text is just fine also amen want to in fact is when I think about the streaming audience I I think I I should probably greet all of our friends who were formerly bethl Tabernacle Phoenix that was a thing and it was a thing I didn't even know it existed and U somebody told me said you know there's a bethl Tabernacle in Phoenix and I said don't play what are you talking about and sure enough we had uh Saints out there meeting and Gathering and you all know them well and fact is um sister Nicole Jackson will be here with us this weekend and um brother Mike Alderson and his family amen him and sister Jennifer and their children and uh her parents amen um brother Dale and sister Darlene brother John sister Nicole all of that gang that was out there we got to see them while I was they're ministering they go to brother Aaron uh mcgary's now there in Phoenix and so we're I could see they're happy and that made me happy amen so uh just in a conversation talking with them I realized they either figure out a way to stream live or they figure out how to get every single archive because uh you know Sister Darlene she's uh just as adorable as you could imagine as you would know and we're hoping they will come here and visit but she was telling sister Debbie she was saying saying where is stepen Emily and she said oh it was so good to see sister Jean come in and she and we realized you know she was asking about this one and about that one and she pretty much knows everything about us so amen we should all probably turn around wave at the camera but uh we want to greet them in the name of the Lord tonight we had a really wonderful time there with them had a marriage banquet kind of a Sweetheart's banquet on this Saturday night and uh I got to thinking man it's time we have one of those here again amen praise the Lord and uh we got we got uh old married folk that that need some adjustments we got young married folks that uh could probably use some inspiration and we got those who are almost about to get married and are desperate for some instructions so amen we're happy in the Lord Amen brother Caleb's given me the the pump sign back there you knowen he's he's ready amen praise the Lord so so we're looking forward that we might um have some thoughts along that line coming up here pretty soon I want to continue reading in Exodus chapter 7 and uh let's let's read verse three again and then we'll carry on down from there let me get to where I need to be all right so Exodus 7 and3 and I will harden Pharaoh's heart and mult multiply Now Catch what he's going to multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt I'm speaking to you tonight on a title why does God perform the supernatural why does God perform the supernatural verse four but pharoh shall not hearken unto you that I may lay my hand upon on Egypt and bring forth my armies and my people the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by great judgments so you know Moses you're uh you're going to be so equipped that you're going to be a God and in fact is so strong is going to be the body Ministry at the time of The Exodus that Aaron will be your prophet and so so we realize then that that you say my goodness there's nothing going to stop these these guys I mean this is God and a prophet in the form of a prophet and his brother who's going to end up being in the priesthood you'd think there's no power on Earth that can stop this my goodness when he walks in there the hammer drops the Israel's goingon to they're going to chase Israel out of there and nothing could be further from the truth and in fact is as strong as that dynamic duo were we're not talking about Batman and Robin as strong as that duo were God actually had a greater purpose than just empowering his church he actually was going to get great glory to himself and bring Israel out he doesn't just want him to go out he actually wants to bring them out under judgments see because so so ful had been those ancient Egyptians so you know uh so evil and so wicked and and you don't get by with things like that God talk Amores Not Yet full and that was going to be a judgment on a certain different kind of class but just understand this that God keeps a book of remembrance and he has WR memory when it comes to remembering sin and who's deserving of a thumping amen ironically he has an incredibly short memory once things go under the blood of the lamb and in fact is it goes completely out of existence and even God himself the one and only can't remember it anymore so we read on here but Pharaoh shall not hearken see verse five and the Egyptians shall know that I I am the Lord when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from among them I to me and this is just completely brother Jason there's no quote anywhere even indicating a third cousin to this but I just wonder being a a history Especial student of history of the ancient world particularly you know I wonder if if God took special exception you know to the fact that these Egyptians claimed to have built Enoch's pyramid and I know that they didn't build them They Came Upon them after the flood those things were built uh by an anad deluvian people and Enoch built the greatest one of all of them and for Egypt to you know uh to to usurp that that thing to say we are the greatest culture because look what we did and all they did was stumble upon Enoch's work left behind amen and I wonder sometimes if God took exception to that and and maybe this is exactly why he would even say concerning Pharaoh for this reason have I raised thee up now again that's just brother Jason speculating as a history student so uh you don't have to put that one in your bag at all I mean it it is it is uh I it I am absolutely convinced to my satisfaction historically speaking and I've looked at the evidence in depth they absolutely Came Upon those pyramids they did not build them amen I know egyptologist is that what they're called JD that's what they want to claim but it's not true the actual history and the findings that archaeologists have found already refute that claim see so but you know when you tell a lie long enough the same way after a while it becomes accepted as the truth verse six and Moses and Aaron did as the Lord um let me read five again and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from among them verse six and Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them so did they so the fact that he still won't let him go is not because somebody failed Moses and Aaron did exactly what God told him to do listen friends you're nearing a Third Exodus and I and I know that the devil sometimes looks like he's winning and it looks like we're losing you're not losing and it has not about oh well if if I had just been stronger if I hadn't had this weakness forget that nonsense you're perfectly in the plan of God say but I got mistakes you think God don't know how to deal with that you he's your heavenly father friends I knew my children made mistakes I didn't set them at the curb I disciplined them and trained them and used them for teachable moments who who was the original daddy who is the original Papa see so everything here is just a shadow of that verse verse six again and Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them so did they and Moses was four score years old and Aaron Four score and three years old when the people spoke unto pharaoh and the Lord spoke unto Moses un unto Aaron saying when Pharaoh shall speak unto you saying show a miracle for you then Thou shalt say unto Aaron take thy rod and cast it before pharaoh and it shall become a serpent and Moses and Aaron went in unto pharaoh and they did so as the Lord commanded so Aaron is now manifesting the word of the prophet amen Aaron is now demonstrating Aaron's demonstration is a final voice after Moses has already said it I'm here to tell you something friends at that Exodus at the second Exodus and at this Exodus God is engaging this family God is engaging you why does God uh perform the supernatural because he's a supernatural being and he's got a supernatural plan and you're a supernatural f family and we go out of here by a Rapture it's going to be a supernatural event you're not going to be able to put yourself in it but neither can you keep yourself out of it Hallelujah and Aaron cast his Rod before pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent okay that's going to for sure do it now no okay no no more need to do anything after that well they'll surely get to go verse 11 everybody get packed up we're leaving then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers huh wait what now the M now the M magicians of Egypt they also did in like manner with their enchantments for they cast down every man his right and they became serpents what do we do now MAA thought the message was the greatest thing out there and now it just looks like everybody can make a claim and it even looks like people can now do things that look like maybe the message isn't the thing that it's supposed to be but just to understand this understand this Aaron's Rod swallowed up their rods and he hardened Pharaoh's heart that he hearkened not unto them as the Lord had said amen so why does God perform the supernatural why would he perform the supernatural God does not always do Supernatural signs and and he does not want us to demand them or depend on them a at least not not demanding and depending in the way that we might think we need the supernatural God is constantly doing the supernatural that you're alive and a believer in an impossible age is Supernatural you're already a walking conundrum to the devil the harder he makes it the more you love God the rougher it gets the harder you push Hallelujah poor old guy can't win for losing I've often said devil could actually win if he wasn't always losing but God does not want us to demand miracles signs or the supernatural or wonders he doesn't want us to depend on them as the world would consider them he expects us to trust him based on what he has already done not something he needs to do I've got faith in him for what he's already done if he never does another thing for me I will leave this world as a Believer see we are to have faith in what he's already done faith in what he has already revealed in his word Matthew 164 says a wicked and an adulterous grab that one for me brother brother Caleb Matthew 16:4 a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and their shall Now Catch who's seeking them amen amen so we don't want to be sitting here tonight trying to put God over a barrel to give us something Supernatural see we're we're to believe that he's what he's already done we're to believe what he's already revealed we are to be at peace we are to be in cont contentment in whatever situation we find ourselves in Because He Lives I Can Face tomorrow before I get there I already know I can and I don't even know what it holds but I already know I can because of what he's already been see a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of of the prophet Jonah and he left them and departed he just left you want a sign I'm not doing it bye is he actually leaving yeah he's there he goes over the hill I thought he was going to no he just said no and he left the Lord wants us and he warns us to be careful in Matthew 24:24 he warns us to be be careful of false signs and false Wonders that will deceive the world and actually would be so deadly that they would deceive us if that were possible friends don't don't underestimate the devil I'm here I I've already given you a number of things and you've already roared out amens and we've rejoiced around but understand and this ain't a game life is happening and we're being perfected in real time and we don't have all the answers but I but I know who does and I just know this I just want him in control Hallelujah he he warns us to be careful Matthew 24:24 for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall shall they shall show great signs and wonders so it's not just smoking mirrors are tricks they're actually signs and wonders they're going to demonstrate some things in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect so so as as happy as we are tonight and we're rejoicing sister Chassidy God bless you oh my goodness I didn't notice y'all sitting here praise the Lord interrupt my whole sermon praise the Lord amen wow I seen a sister paying Keen attention and saidh she she's familiar all right where was I let me get my thoughts back in gear here praise the Lord sis I'm thrilled to see you amen so here's my point that yes we are his chosen people but these are dangerous times yes we do have the word but you got to be careful let me tell you something young people teenagers and and the older ones in here could could give you a a a quick lesson just by telling you the history of their life this is serious I mean the you know even the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence under this day and the violent have to take it by force if you want a blessing go take it if you need something for God to do go get it I promise you the devil was going to resist you but greater is he that is in you and your only concern the only thing you have to worry about is is your life worthy of the Gospel that's it after that it will be the Lord that gives the devil the beat down on your behalf if your life is worthy of the Gospel but even when the Lord does that to him it might not look like what you thought amen I think tonight that the greatest sign of the Supernatural is found in John chap 3 veres 14-1 17 and as Moses John 3 14-1 17 and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have Everlast but have eternal life so so already you already know that who doesn't believe in him's got a big problem amen can did you read that that whosoever believeth in him should not perish so apparently whoever's not believing in him have a problem they will not perish but have eternal life I'm here to tell you if you have made a decision to not follow the lord Jesus you got a big problem and it's not one you can solve and it's not one you can escape and there's no turning back and there's not going to be any type of of reprieve you have one way to to eternal life and that's through Jesus Christ through the Willing Acceptance from your heart to say Lord I don't want to be me anymore I want to be you and I want you to come come and live in my life that is the only hope of Salvation otherwise you're doomed to a tribulation whatever happens to you at the Judgment bar that's up to God you'll get a fair trial but for sure you are doomed to a tribulation I promise you don't want to be there am that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life verse 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish it's a double warning but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved so ultimately friends tonight the greatest sign that God has given us that God has ever given the world is his son that's the greatest supernatural act the Earth will ever know of is that he gave his only begotten son Jesus Christ who died and rose again for our justification we find out you're talking about supernatural power you're talking about a miracle if we believe in him we have eternal life that ain't a small thing he must not have been a small person I mean imagine just believing in a person and that's what he was a human believing in a human gives you eternal life this was more than a man this was quite a man and more than a man as brother brandham said he was the god man oh what a privilege oh what a supernatural that God would reveal this person to you no wonder brother Brandon would say what is the new birth you say well brother Brandon what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you it's that just that language alone means it ain't happening to everybody otherwise where's the privilege that he does it to say you're privileged you're right you're right I am before the foundation of the world I was chosen in Christ amen hallelujah say what are you going to do about it try to get everybody I can to believe like I do Hallelujah but if we believe in him we have eternal life and then we have the promise in Ephesians chapter 1 the very first chapter of Ephesians we have the promise that the that the Holy Ghost who is the guarantee he's actually a guarantee of our inheritance if you believe on Christ then you're you're and you repent and you believe on him and you're baptized in the Holy Ghost then you have a guarantee Ephesians 1 13 and 14 in whom you also trusted why am I you know tonight as I was putting this sermon together I was thinking about all these scriptures I'm going to go to and I almost did a PowerPoint but I didn't want to do it because it's Wednesday and so I just told the I didn't know who would be Manning it's brother Caleb tonight getting a workout but I said just be ready cuz I want to cover a bunch of scriptures and as I was putting that together this afternoon I was thinking yes sir I'm just going to Chuck this thing full of scriptures because I was so impressed with Brother JD on Sunday in that thought my goodness I was blown away by that and just scripture after scripture after scripture after scripture after scripture and he built a whole case and by the time he got done I was a Believer Hallelujah I said who could out that it was so biblical one two I mean the devil's just taking punch after punch after punch after punch oh I tell you something brother Jason I was so thrilled I told sister Debbie honey you got to get this archive I I I I thought to my that statement you made about God does not pour out his wrath upon his children don't ever let the devil tell you that Jesus Christ took the wrath of God he might pour out loving correction on you but the wrath of God was taken in Christ on my behalf oh that just shuts the devil down verse 13 in whom we all in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise so being sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise is receiving is attached to the receiving of the truth for your hour I don't just mean mentally but in your heart heart to heart with God which is the earnest we made you we we told you that that this Holy Ghost is our guarantee and this is what Paul is saying which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory now to me I am just I'm just uh I'm just laid uh you know back in the day when when brother Eddie and I we were traveling we were on the road doing a lot of painting and we were on the interstate a lot i' had been on by the time I was 18 I had been on at that time it's probably not true now I'm quite sure because there's been more interstates built but there in the late 70s and early 80s by the time I was 18 I had been on every every us interstate in the United States at least once I'd been multiple times all the way to the West Coast I'd been all 48 lower states by the time I was 18 we traveled a lot and one of the things we did to pass time on the road was we had the the CB Radio and and you could hear all the truckers talking and and you had a you had a lead trucker and then you had the guys in the rear and these guys up here were watching out for cops ahead these guys were watching out for sneaky cops sneaking up behind and the guy in the middle they said he's in the rocking chair cuz he's just he just rocking he's got lemonade he ain't got worry about nothing he's got a bird dog up front he's got a rear guard in the back nobody can sneak up on him nobody can surprise him I'm here to tell you that if I've got an inheritance that's in Earnest until my until the Redemption of the purchased possession there's nowhere in the middle for the devil to get me from the time I'm sealed to the time I'm gone Hallelujah there's no chance for him I'm just in the rocking chair hallelujah oh my to the until until the Redemption of the purchased possession under the praise of his glory one of the greatest meetings that brother brandham ever had was held in India 300,000 people and you say well what about Durban Durban was a tremendous meeting 30,000 coming to the Lord in one alter call 25,000 notable Miracles stood on their feet in one single prayer there eyewitnesses to that I've heard their eyewitness testimony we're not just talking about what William brandham said I've heard the eyewitness testimonies of people who were there I talked personally to George zad Cliff before he passed away I interviewed him over the phone and ask him about the certainty of his book I said it your book seems incredible pass myself off as maybe I'm not a full believer you know sir what you wrote what you wrote in a prophet visit South Africa seems in incredible I'm sorry I don't mean to impune your integrity but it what you're saying just seems almost impossible and that old man about come through the phone on me I'll tell you young man every bit of it was true I was there I saw it you know I've I've heard uh brother Bosworth on tape recording talking about that meeting and saying he never imagined 25,000 people could be healed with one prayer he'd never thought to try that he thought you just had to pray for people one at a time and he said brother brandham just prayed one prayer and he said we watch 25,000 people notable Miracles we're not talking about somebody got a sniffly nose and the de being raised I'm telling you something friends that was quite a meeting and yet India and and I know there's there's all this nonsense about oh well there was never a 300,000 people I went to the very spot where the meeting was held I went into the church and stood in the pull pit when I was in India I talked to the man who's the pastor whose grandfather was the was one of the team leaders as an organizer of that meeting and and I and he he said absolutely there were 300,000 people here he said it was my family has known that for years and he said I said well sir I'm looking at all these buildings and you say it was right here and he and that's what people don't realize they say oh where's 300,000 people going to gather but he said sir and when William Brandon was here none of these buildings were here they were all this was all open field and I said Glory Hallelujah I want to tell you something friends you've come too late to tell this old boy it ain't real i' done been around the Seven Seas I already proved this thing I've already went I've seen God do it I've not only heard what he did but I've seen him do it in my own Ministry so so we find that that that that when he was there he he he talked about and a lot of times if you if you hear him you know discussing India and you hear him discussing Durban meetings and you almost hear language that sounds like well which one's India and the reason for that is if you've ever been to Durban it's almost a completely I I would say conservatively it's three4 East Indian culture and uh I was it was there not in India where I saw the the festivals and I saw where brother bradam said they put those hooks in their body and pulled chariots I saw that I witnessed it and where they walked on fire I actually was standing right there and watching it happen and so so a lot of times you can get the language a little bit confused uh as to what was happening where but but but we realize that when brother brandham one of the things that he encountered is that he was told you know by the leaders of both of those meetings to say uh you know brother brandham we've had dead theology for Generations what we need is a living God we've had theology if all you've done is come over here William brandham to bring us more dead theology I'm here to tell you our Bible schools are turning them out like crazy it's just all dead theology there's no real power of God we need to see a living God and you know the story I'm not here to to to go down that rabbit Trail tonight but you know when when you think about the that Indian culture that East Indian culture and how steeped they are in heathenism when I was there and they they have 33 million different gods that they worship and burn incense to 33 million Madness this is madness amen and I I walked through their shrines and it just endless caverns and under it's like an underground and every every dark cave likee Corridor you go down there's there's incense burning here and incense burning there and painted images here and sculpted images here and and people prostrating and and you know you've got you've got cows and they're starving and they won't sacrifice the cows because they're holy and some of them are so so religious that when they when they walk when they walk from point A to point B they walk like this Shing possible insects out of their path lest it be some distant relative who's reincarnated that's that's I mean that's that's that's torture can you imagine having to be steeped in that kind of of of idolatry and and I'm here to tell you something friends when you go into a place like that you've got to be able to demonstrate the supernatural why does God perform the supernatural a lot of times it's to confirm the message and the messenger that he sent amen we've seen it happen I I I've seen all kinds of Miracles I could stand here tonight and tell you from Decades of traveling around the world and seeing incredible Miracles but we find that you you've got to have the reality ities of the Living God and brother Brandon facing the challenge you know of of dead theology but but now remember remember brother brandham teaches us that when God performs the supernatural he has a reason to do it he said God doesn't entertain us this isn't baram and Bailey he's not a a circus performer he's not as I've said to you many times he's not Santa Claus you don't give him your wish list you don't he's not a vending machine you get in trouble you're not very spiritual you don't ever think about God you got your whole life and all your priorities wrapped up in leoa and the devil gets almost all of your time and God can't even get you into the house of God until you're in trouble and then you're looking for 75 cent to go to a to go to the god Vending machine and drop three quarters and Lord give me some Deliverance I'm here to tell you I'm here to defend him tonight he's not that kind of a God he deserves more out of you and I than that he gave his life he deserves everything you have you have no chance if he didn't love you he's not here to entertain us he has very specific reasons for demonstrations of his super Supernatural power and signs and wonders are in his personal presence as he said to as we read in our in Exodus he he said I'm doing it for this reason I'm going to do signs and wonders he's I'm then I'm going to harden his heart so that then I can I can actually bring judgments upon him and be just be justified in it because he I won't force him to reject it but he will see and in and then you say no God hardened his heart that's not scriptural God hardens your heart after you reject him God never even sends a man to judgment without first giving him a fair trial Paul Paul Paul clears that up in the New Testament that when the ancient people made a choice when they knew God they chose not to worship him as God but made of him winged creatures and forf footed and therefore God turned them over to a repeate mind see to to believe the lie and be damned by it and if all you hear is that part that God calls them to believe a lie so they'd be damned by it then the critic says see God God did that God didn't do it they did it over here see so so God God gives everybody a legitimate opportunity even starting with Cain see so don't don't confuse don't make the scriptures jam into each other like that you can't turn the got into something like that he's not he's not uh there's no Injustice in him in Mark 16 we find that sometimes God performs the supernatural in order to confirm the truth of his message and his Messengers I've made that statement to you already I'd like to read the scripture Mark 161 19 to20 so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following am and I'm a witness today brother Jason is a witness today brother Brad is a witness today any men who have taken this gospel especially overseas in America it's hard uh it's not that God can't do it but God just won't when he feels that resistant arrogant American Spirit he's not here to entertain us and I promise you he ain't got nothing to prove to you you can serve him or you'll perish you can give your heart to him or you're finished those are your options you're born with a death sentence and he loved you enough to die for you if you don't accept it it ain't on him so we find that but but when there are people who believe then God does do and I'm a witness that God does the supernatural I've seen Devils cast off I've seen blinded eyes open I've seen the lame walk I know it's real there's no p no power of the enemy that can withstand God's family when they're praying in faith and believing God's word I'm a eyewitness to that around the world so why does God do and perform the supernatural it's many often often times it's to demonstrate his love and his compassion for those who are suffering John 11:4 give me that one right quick brother Caleb we'll read that I'm just going to try to not spend much time on it here John 11 and4 then said Jesus unto them yeah thank you when Jesus heard that he said this sickness is not un death but for the glory of God that the son might be glorified now you're familiar with that story because you know his friend Lazarus had died he said I'm going to go wake him but the whole the whole point was that God is going to receive some Glory say well you know M seemed like a sad case and even even you find that Jesus comes along and Jesus says Where have you laid him and and they said Lord show and the place where we laid him and the Bible says shortest verse in the Bible Jesus wept and I'll taste me friends I read some commentary some years ago that I kind of lean into a little bit I don't I you know I know that Jesus was a man but he already knows he's about to be raised from the dead so then what's the point why would he be crying and they said oh see how the see how he loved him now that was the humanistic oh poor Jesus of Nazareth see how he loved him he did love him but he wasn't there to leave him in a grave he already knew he's going to be raised up already said it see and he says to Martha you know if if you had been here my son my brother not died and he said You Know Thy son shall live again yay Lord in the resurrection and Jesus Jesus immediately makes her stop looking forward he he didn't say in the resurrection he'll raise he said I am the resurrection so the resurrection is just not a calendar event he said I am the Resurrection this is the model of his bride have authority because the resurrection is already in you it's already started in your soul your Soul's already in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so why is he crying and I read one commentator said one time because of all the unbelief around him I thought that makes a lot of sense to me after all he had done everything he had said and after it so showed so many miracles and yet they still the Bible even says that in another place that yet he did so many things yet still they did not believe him and to think I'm G to tell you something you want to talk about breaking his heart disbelieve his word when you ought to believe it when you're his child you're his son you're his daughter and if anybody ought to take the word of God it ought to be us and sometimes we let the devil string us out with this trial and that trial and this up and down and this problem and this and that and the other and and you lose confidence in God you me me tell you the opposite of that brother Brandon now look at the opposite of it in case you doubt this side of it let me show the the the contrast brother Bram says you believe his word and that makes him love you and you get what you ask for see so so we find that that he doesn't he doesn't always show his compassion in the way we expect but could I say to you it's still him hello I I know that he doesn't always show his compassion like like you had it written down on your prayer he might not be showing you his love like the prayer requests you sent in he might actually be showing you his love by doing the opposite almost like wow did you read that to God upside down no he heard it read and he's answering it in the way he knows best so I just want to say to you tonight that's a I know that's a short direct way to say it but that's how I I felt inspired to say it when I read John 11 that story in John 11:4 I realized that he doesn't always show his compassion in the way we expect but it's still him it's still him so why does God perform the supernatural sometimes to fulfill his promises and his prophecies Luke 24 brother Caleb back to Luke 24 44-49 so wh watch this now Luke uh 2444 to 49 and he said unto them these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the law and in I'm sorry and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures he's got Copus and his companions on the road to EMAs you're familiar with this and he said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooved Christ to suffer see they didn't understand why' he suffer why' he die they're all downcast and he walks out among them and says you know why is it that you walk and you're sad and they said are were you a stranger you haven't heard the things that have happened and he said what things well of Jesus of Nazareth a mighty man approved of God and we thought it had been he that should save Israel and now he's dead and this the third day and some crazy women said they saw him we don't know what to do and you know what Jesus could have just repeated his same line if he'd have wanted to he could have said yeah like I said what things well all of these yeah what things well death and terrible yeah exactly what things sometimes we have to get that through our head I know things go wrong and things get upside down the world gets crazy your home gets crazy your life gets crazy your family gets crazy you say oh all these things and I say what things say well this that and the other I say again what things Jesus Lives he's got a plan he's in control yeah but this and that what things there aren't anything things except this this is the only thing that matters Hallelujah and you've got the choice to live in that level of Victory the devil don't want you to live in that level of Victory he wants you to live roll around in the dust and throw dust in the air and and woe is me and I'm here to tell you somebody above you is in control Hallelujah and said un them thus it is written or that's fine go ahead the next one and that repentance and remission of sins you see guys this is why it had to happen so that remission of sin should be preached I know you didn't understand it but it had to be preached in his name among all nations it had to begin in Jerusalem I know you think it's all wrong but you're all wrong it's all right see and so verse 48 and ye are witnesses of these things and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but carry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high so Jesus now has made them a promise he's cleared up a a lot of their Miss understanding and prophecy and on the Mount of Olives they're they're asking him a question you know uh you know Lord will you now will you now restore Israel I mean when when the prophet even you know they they had that wrong they thought okay now you're gonna okay you died we got it well we we didn't see that one coming and then you Rose we heard you Rose and then we were all depressed and then you opened us the scriptures and then you opened our understanding and then you opened our eyes and we saw it was you and then you disappeared and then you met us in a room and you met us by the seashore and and and okay we think we're figured this out now okay now we're on the Mount of Olives all right woo okay we got it Lord I'm sorry we doubted you now are you gonna restore Israel they still weren't getting it they still thought they had the Rapture all figured out and they were a million miles off all they get told is to go in and and expect to be filled and and I mean goodness goodness when when he fulfilled this prophecy it's not like they expected it's it when John's life didn't happen like they expected and and in fact is and in fact is that even the the promise of the Holy Ghost coming upon them didn't come like they expected brother brandham talks about that they're in the upper room and they're saying Peter you think we got it now you know I think maybe we got it boys I think we can just go ahead we've been up here three and a half days now you know and uh and and and if that crowd kind of lost the argument they resurfaced at day seven and and then day eight okay we are really done here it's been eight days and they still got two more days of waiting to go you see friends sometimes God does the super natural because we need a little bit of guidance we're so desperate for it but then sometimes he won't on purpose because he's wanting the the greater Supernatural and that is for you just to believe his word take him at his word and believe him and confess what he said see so you know the the the Lord is simply not going to let you figure things out in advance you've got to face a situation even when you don't understand it and either you have faith or you don't pretty cut and dry either you have faith or you don't have it you know even the uh as I said even the promise of the spirit coming upon them would be would be different than what they thought you know and when they're on the Mount of Olives it's different than what they thought they as I said I kind of interrupted myself they thought his Kingdom for Israel is going to be restored at that point and actually there's not anything they could have said that would have been more opposite of the truth will you now restore Israel no but boy really no I mean 2,000 years are going to have to transpire seven contiguous Church ages are going to have to go forth seven there's going to be seven spirits of God there's going to be four living creatures there's going to be the falling away and the restoration of the brid tree am I going to restore Israel yeah but not like you think oh my goodness can we learn a lesson tonight friends oh Hallelujah so so you know I mean our parents and our grandparents thought that they had the Rapture uh figured out when brother Brandon was here and even even brother Brenham I can say this now you don't have to throw something at me I'm not committing a terrible transgression we can say it now because of the history but but even brother brandham says things that seem to propose it would be different from what he thought in many ways and and ultimately but now ultimately it it would be everything he thought cuz it always is when a prophet says those things it is what he thought only sometime times it's not in the way we think the way we think is not maybe what God meant see and that those times come where you just have to say I've overturned every stone and all I know is that I know God is real and I know I believe him and I know I'm never leaving him and I know I'm going forward and that's all I know that's all I know see this is clear in the message today we can we can can make these kinds of statement as the as the fourth generation from the prophet now Rises into adulthood my own children sister uh uh my my my grandchildren my children's children my grandchildren sister Jean's great-grandchildren and we see them already growing into adulthood why does God perform the supernatural sometimes it's to draw people to repentance and to draw them to faith in him as he did in Acts 2 we won't turn to it brother Caleb cuz I'm running out of time but we're familiar with the story anyway we we read there in Acts 2 and 37 where the the Bible says they were pricked in their hearts sometimes God has to just plain old hurt your feelings sometimes he has to make you mad I I was testifying in Arizona and we were talking about a situation and somebody was talking about you know um the the subject of indiffer indifference to the word of God came up because that's the the sad ands by the wayside and it just lays on the ground the people they don't really care it's just it's doesn't mean anything to them and then the fouls of the air come and pick it up and that's the demons that come you said in a church service like this one here and the gospel went forth and okay fine it's really great for y'all okay great have had it but to you it means nothing it's not even that you're rejecting it you just are indifferent you're just okay I'm just a good old person whatever you know and and here and here we are talking about the words of eternal life and your opportunity is right in your hands to receive eternal life and you're just going to let it like water run through your fingers and whole well and that's indifference and I said that's that's the saddest part I I I was witnessing to a sister one time who his mother was very angry she's trying to witness the message meage to her which when we say that witnessing the message we're just witnessing the gospel that's what the message is nothing just the gospel and it's just the gospel returned back to its pure form like it was in the original that's all it is it's not another gospel it's the original one and so so she's witnessing the gospel the message to her mother and her mother is a you know real staunch denominational and thinks she already knows it all but her life proves it doesn't and that's why the daughter is trying to witness to her mom you need to think about I mean if you really say you had the spirit of God would you do that would you live like that would you dress like that would you go there would you say things like that isn't the spirit of God holy fair question people don't like that but it's a fair question see brother Brandon would say sisters you get out here and he here's a gentleman gave him the courtesy of calling him sisters said you get out here and he's in decent clothes out here mowing your grass and say you got the Holy Ghost and he said Just remember sister he's a holy spirit not a filthy Spirit you can't claim to have the Holy Spirit when you dress immorally that that that is that that becomes almost an oxymoron I guess that's not even possible see that's why the Bible says without Holiness no man shall see God period end of story Case Closed see so so even even the foolish virgin who don't get the message yet find Acceptance in God cuz they were righteous and they lived as Saints Sanctified ones the Bible calls them that calls them righteous and calls them saints so so we find that you know when it comes down to it that that that they're they're pricked in their heart and they say to Peter and the rest of the Apostles what must we do and Peter Peter doesn't tell him to go join a Bible College he just says repent he doesn't tell them to go do Penance and crawl on glass and whip yourself he just says repent amen repent stop thinking like the world start thinking like the word see and and so so the this this was to bring them Christ and the remission of sins so so why does God sometimes perform the supernatural sometimes it's to draw people to repentance and faith in him see so so he gave them the demonstration those people saw them coming out of the upper room and they heard every man speak in his own language see and so and so sometimes he you know here let me let me go let me come full circle tonight for I close I'll come back to my text in Exodus 7 because sometimes God performs the supernatural to reveal his power and His glory glory to his people I said this at the beginning and to the world and we're looking for a short quick powerful demonstration we're looking for the fresh for the fresh dynamics of this church to be a refilling of the Holy Ghost we're looking for that we're promised that and I'm I'm hanging on to that promise but I'm also not unaware that a lot of it's happening now I already see it happening in my life it's it listen friends you you say oh but my if you just knew my problems and if you knew my weakness if you knew my failures could could I if you knew my past life I'm in no shape listen friends it should be noted in this first Exodus and it's also true in the second Exodus I time to break it down tonight but it's certainly true in the first and the second and the third Exodus that that that God you know involves his family God involves his family in this Supernatural he's got Moses I'll make you a God and Aaron's going to be like your Prophet I'm going to put you in the model of like of like me and my Prophet you'll be God and he'll be the prophet oh friends you think that this bride is hopeless since a prophet went home nothing doing the ministry of the son of man is still here and stronger than it's ever been and more capable because now it's got an elect lady has risen in maturity and is ready to take her stand on the word of God Amen in the first Exodus it should be noted that when by the time you come to Exodus 7 where we read and God is saying you'll be like a God and Aaron will be like your Prophet you you need to realize that this was after Moses had come to the end of himself and finally stopped running this was the time when he came to the end of his own abilities it was then that God found him wandering in a Wilderness like he found you like he found me wandering in a Wilderness tired of being who we were uh feeling like our life was a failure we wasted all those years but the the truth of the matter was Moses hadn't wasted one of them brother bradam said God needed him to be there 40 years and then he needed him to be in the desert 40 years and then he's going to use him 40 years don't think the devil has anything on you I don't care what you ever failed or gave into God has always been in control and he's ready now to sweep it all into the sea of forget one us and start this world over with a millennial Reign and a righteous King on the throne and it's his family you're talking about a supernatural Miracle he's going to demonstrate the supernatural one last [Applause] time Exodus 7 is after he returned to Egypt and begin to work for the Lord among the people Exodus 7 is after things didn't go as they thought Exodus 7 is after it seemed to have gotten worse Moses cried to God because of the situation but it was all always all under God's control and his plan was not actually being hindered at all whose perspective yours or theirs or God's well which one should count amen which one should you live by yours are his live by yours and I'll see you in my office tomorrow because you're going to need counseling I'll see you the next day you'll need it again I'll see the next day because you'll to need it again and you're going to wear me out needing counseling if you keep looking at your life through your own lens I'm here to tell you look through the lens of almighty God he has already done so much miraculous oh let me tell you something friends no matter what we see happening before Exodus 7 during Exodus 7 and after Exodus 7 Israel's Exodus from Egypt was always going to happen Pharaoh was always going to cave in eventually and let God's people go but God is determined to work through his family as he did in the example of Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh so just raise a volunteering hand and say me I'll I'll volunteer Lord hallelujah these Tri Tri s and these seeming setbacks I want to say to you today friends they they not only are being endured by you but they need to be they must be endured but our vision should never be dim because I will tell you we are going out of here and there's not enough pharaohs and all of his soldiers there's not enough devils and all of his demons Satan is not powerful enough to keep me from going out of here [Applause] am and I'll say this tonight before I before I turn it back and call the musicians let me just make this last statement we're all rejoicing and looking forward to the Rapture say yes sir brother Jason I'm getting out of here but you know something the truth of the matter is we're human beings we're struggling along we're trying to please the Lord the devil's fighting us you

he helps me because he loves me when he's going to perform the supernatural for you and your life and meet your need he don't ask for anybody's permission neither does he accept anybody's resistance he just walks right past it you know they the old saying is it's it's easier to ask for forgiveness than it is for permission yeah he don't do that either he just moves like he wants to move I'm glad to know that he's my father brother Travis writes in prayer requests for Marcus Humphrey the man who God miraculously healed from cancer last year he has not been able to digest food well and has slowly lost his strength over the last several months they are now giving him only a week or so to live doctors don't have any answers or remedies that's the man that was in stage four with probably days to live and they took another CAT scan after prayer and he was clean as a whistle you know it's obvious that the devil has it in for this guy and the Lord's already saved his life one time that's a perfect example if he passes away that's a perfect example brother Brandon was saying said you know what's the greatest Miracle is your salvation he said say oh heal somebody of cancer he said he could heal you of cancer this year and you die of cancer next year that here we have no continuing City just because God heals your body of something don't mean you won't get sick again so the greatest miracle that God can do is the Salvation of your soul so we're going to pray for this man again but we're going to pray that the Lord will reveal himself to him he's already a wonderful Christian man but I think that brother Travis has really spoken to him you know about the systems of religion today and tried to get him to see a clearer picture in the in the message of the hour so let's be praying for that Amen Brother Richard noise requests prayer um oh my um Brother Richard having some mental battles there poor brother devil fighting him like that feels like he's being overwhelmed amen praise the Lord you going to pray for our brother tonight amen that I don't know if that was from last week or not but it's laying up here on my desk sister Melissa um okay this is my sister Debbie okay so sister Debbie went out she wants us to pray for her she's dealing with some stomach issues you know Sister Debbie that would have to be pretty severe to get her to walk out of

only found out today that sister Amber's brother passed away I guess Saturday and they were down in Florida actually they were just coming back today arriving back from they stopped in Jacksonville I think to or St Augustine to see brother Tony's parents and so uh we just want to pray I told sister Amber you know to please express our deepest uh heartfelt sympathy and condolences to her family Lord knows all about that um he wasn't very old but it was all in the Lord's hands plenty of people were praying Lord decided to take him on that's in God's prerogative we don't question those things but we certainly can ask the Lord to comfort their family will you do that with me and join with me tonight in that amen amen join with somebody standing near you and let's take these to the Lord father we bring before you sister Amber's Family and this time of a sad loss Lord Death comes to us all Lord only there will be a small group that'll be alive and remain at the coming of the Lord and

Resurrection Lord and I pray that you'll bring great comfort uh to the sister Amber's Family at this time Lord you see the request that brother Travis has turned in for Marcus Humphrey Lord uh you you
