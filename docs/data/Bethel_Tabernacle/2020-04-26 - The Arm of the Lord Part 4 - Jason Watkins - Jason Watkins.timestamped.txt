[21:58] love and he's a man
[22:00] amen if you don't have that confidence
[22:04] and you're in the right place to gain it
[22:06] today can you say Amen we have missions
[22:10] report this morning
[22:12] amen sigh ran over a little bit but we
[22:16] got a little bit of a late start and
[22:17] brother John has a special maybe we'll
[22:20] bring the minister out on that son today
[22:23] a man come on brother Jason how are we
[22:38] looking on that Power Point brothers all
[22:40] right wonderful so gonna start a trip
[22:46] report or not a trip report but a
[22:48] missions report and want to just give
[22:52] you a little update about what's going
[22:54] on in Egypt and also in Turkey of course
[22:59] everything has changed with what was
[23:03] going on in the world today and so of
[23:07] course missions work has changed as well
[23:10] so we've been we've been meeting with
[23:13] the brothers and keeping in contact with
[23:15] them and they've been they've had to
[23:18] cancel services and they're using
[23:19] Facebook and and so forth to continue
[23:22] their services using zoom to have Bible
[23:25] studies and meet meet with believers in
[23:27] the church and so there there's a
[23:30] consistent process that we have going in
[23:33] that the brothers in in Turkey and Egypt
[23:35] have going to do that do this as well
[23:37] and I've been a part of some of those
[23:40] Bible studies as well and so we're just
[23:43] continuing on by God's grace and just a
[23:48] little Egypt update they but they've
[23:49] been shut down since March 19th haven't
[23:52] been able to have a service since then
[23:53] and just like us they kind of don't
[23:56] really know when they can start up again
[23:58] brother megali he's been having Facebook
[24:02] services with for the church and he pray
[24:06] for him he's right now suffering with
[24:09] some chronic pain in his neck and lower
[24:12] back
[24:14] here's a picture of him and a few of the
[24:17] brothers in the in the church there in
[24:19] Cairo and we just recently printed book
[24:24] two of Supernatural so that's been
[24:27] printed and once once all this ends
[24:30] it'll be distributed so that would be
[24:32] God willing very soon
[24:35] kind of the same idea with missions
[24:37] traveling for missions I would like to
[24:40] make a plan because that's in my nature
[24:42] to plan ahead but there's no way to make
[24:45] a plan so we're just waiting on when
[24:48] things are open of course there's
[24:50] flights you can take a flight to Turkey
[24:52] or Egypt but you would get there and
[24:55] pretty much sit in a hotel or in
[24:56] someone's home and not be able to do
[24:59] much of anything so flights some flights
[25:02] are open but it's not a matter of that
[25:05] it's a matter of the public being open
[25:07] up up up again and so we're just kind of
[25:09] waiting on that book six of supernatural
[25:13] has been translated so the work there of
[25:16] translating is done we're going through
[25:18] edits on book three four five and six
[25:22] will kind of go through those
[25:24] step-by-step as we prepare them for
[25:26] printing and I recently found a service
[25:29] that you can use that will translate
[25:33] YouTube videos into many many different
[25:38] languages and so I've started doing that
[25:40] so the they make they make a transcript
[25:43] of the English then they they'll
[25:45] translate it to Arabic and then my
[25:47] Arabic translator can go in and review
[25:49] the Arabic translation and change it as
[25:51] needed so the videos that I'm doing I'm
[25:54] doing are gonna be made made into Arabic
[25:58] and brother Omid is translating those
[26:03] videos also into Farsi but that was with
[26:06] that it would be a voiceover for them so
[26:09] turkey update for the last several years
[26:12] brother Nehemiah's home Church in the
[26:14] Toronto area has been sponsoring the
[26:17] printing and shipping of the message and
[26:19] they're continuing to do that so they're
[26:21] printing it in in Toronto and they're
[26:24] actually ship mailing it over to Turkey
[26:27] to the different
[26:27] Edge's and believers there they've also
[26:30] recently purchased had printed a
[26:33] thousand Bibles for us to have there and
[26:36] distribute so we're really really
[26:38] excited for that because the persian old
[26:41] version which would be similar to our
[26:43] King James Version is actually going out
[26:46] of print there so we've had to go and
[26:50] contact the printer and say can we print
[26:53] them and they've given us the okay to do
[26:55] that so we're now able to print as we
[26:58] have needed but of course you have to
[27:00] print in bulk and that church there in
[27:02] Milton Ontario has been a great blessing
[27:04] to be able to do that print those and
[27:08] provide for the shipping as well so now
[27:11] this is from a picture from a recent
[27:14] trip brother Shahin who's the pastor in
[27:17] Denizli has traveled to eskisehir we
[27:20] used to have a church in escucha here
[27:23] now we have a small group of believers
[27:25] there that that are meeting together and
[27:28] watching the services from Deniz Lee and
[27:30] brother shine recently started traveling
[27:32] to visit them and with with shutdown's
[27:36] that's kind of put a wrench in that but
[27:39] we'll get it started again once things
[27:40] open up and this is brother Petros on a
[27:44] recent trip that he took to Turkey in
[27:48] February and meeting with the different
[27:51] ones and and and meeting some in some
[27:54] new areas to see about getting new
[27:57] churches going brother Petros is doing a
[27:58] fantastic job we're gonna be working on
[28:02] a plan to start distributing those
[28:05] Bibles in those books in Turkey we want
[28:08] to do some form of outreach once once
[28:10] this starts opening up whether that be
[28:12] in Istanbul or where we would do that
[28:16] we're not sure but we're just starting
[28:19] the process of making a plan to get that
[28:21] outreach going and we also need to go
[28:23] back and start reprinting the
[28:26] supernatural series in Farsi we have
[28:30] recently printed book six but we got to
[28:33] go back has they've already distributed
[28:34] all of the book one two three four and
[28:38] five so we'll be printing that again

[28:41] um please pray for brother brother
[28:44] Petros in Germany he's he's living in

[42:32] streaming we're trusting that signals
[42:35] coming through loud and clear appreciate
[42:37] all the work of the teams and their
[42:40] efforts a man even if we fail I promise
[42:44] you we get an A for effort because I'm a
[42:47] person a witness of the rigorous hours
[42:50] that all of our brothers are putting in
[42:53] to try to make it they're trying to make
[42:56] it perfect there's no other way to
[42:58] describe it we know we can't get it
[43:00] perfect but that's our goal so you pray
[43:03] for us as we continue to endeavor amen
[43:06] we're and we're not just throwing money
[43:07] at it I don't do that these brothers
[43:10] have legitimate answers to questions
[43:13] that I ask and whenever we can come up
[43:15] with a solution we're investing in it so
[43:18] it's part of the ministry it's part of
[43:20] the word amen and so we're happy to be
[43:23] able to do that first Peter chapter four
[43:25] today want to give you just a quick
[43:27] update on brother Charles so I spoke to
[43:31] the nurse's station this morning and he
[43:35] had his fever was down to 99 which was
[43:39] nearly normal I spiked a little bit
[43:43] again this morning button but but it
[43:46] leveled off and it's they the nurses
[43:49] words to me was he's daily making small
[43:53] improvements they're not they were
[43:57] having to manually turn him because of
[44:00] the pneumonia she said he's actually
[44:01] turning himself now so his he's getting
[44:04] more clear his comprehension of things I
[44:07] think he even spoke to apparently
[44:09] somebody here from the church gave him a
[44:11] call so god bless you for that I've
[44:12] tried to do that unsuccessfully trying
[44:15] to get a meeting to I'm trying to get it
[44:17] arranged where I can go in under my
[44:19] chaplaincy badge
[44:20] and to his bedside that's not been
[44:22] worked out yet so we're still working on
[44:24] that they are testing him again kovat to
[44:28] make sure to kind of confirm the first
[44:30] test that they did which was negative so
[44:33] we're just continuing to pray for our
[44:35] brother he is still very sick and he's
[44:38] not a young man
[44:39] so things that are pulmonary like that I
[44:43] mean they can you can go off a cliff he
[44:45] really fast and bought him out really
[44:48] quickly and so we're just wanting to
[44:51] continue to pray for him amen we had
[44:55] some other prayer requests that came in
[44:57] brother Kenny you got to those and so
[44:59] we're happy to have all of you on line
[45:01] with us today amen so brother Matt is
[45:05] sending out a an announcement to all
[45:07] booth personnel we're going to have a
[45:09] short meeting with you at 2:00 p.m. via
[45:13] zoom via virtual there are some members
[45:16] of the team that will be there in person
[45:18] I appreciate that and so that's going to
[45:20] start right at 2 o'clock so if you can
[45:22] attend physically that's wonderful if
[45:26] not make sure you get ready virtually I
[45:29] assume it's zoom I don't remember if
[45:31] Matt told me that or not it is very good
[45:33] so brother Matt will be sending out the
[45:35] invitation for that amen we're just
[45:38] needing to try to catch everybody up on
[45:42] where we are based on what we've learned
[45:46] based on trial and error based on
[45:49] experimentation and so we want to we
[45:52] want to outline where we are where we
[45:54] feel that we are and where we want to be
[45:57] and plotting a solution to get from here
[46:00] to there so and then there's some other
[46:03] things on my heart as well so we're just
[46:05] looking for that amen first Peter
[46:08] chapter 4 I will inform you also that
[46:12] we're continuing to monitor the civil
[46:17] authorities for when we can assemble
[46:20] again as a whole Church it's not now but
[46:24] we can see it coming there's light
[46:27] seemingly at the end of the tunnel so
[46:29] we'll keep you updated on that as we
[46:32] gather what they're going to allow
[46:35] remember that we are cooperating fully
[46:38] to preserve our testimony in the
[46:41] community we want to make sure that we
[46:43] because they're not trying to stop us
[46:45] you know from from gathering at all
[46:47] they're not trying to get us to not
[46:50] preach the gospel they're not trying to
[46:52] get us to compromise our beliefs this is
[46:55] not that if this were that we would be
[46:58] saying absolutely no way that's never
[47:01] going to happen but this is not that so
[47:04] that's not a battle that we need to
[47:06] worry about or fight because that's not
[47:08] what this is this is just steps of
[47:12] prudence and wisdom and that's why we
[47:15] are more than willing more than willing
[47:17] to not only comply but to but to help a
[47:22] man a man I want to be I like being part
[47:25] of the answer I like being part of the
[47:27] solution not part of the problem that's
[47:30] that's anathema to me if I think I'm
[47:33] part of the problem wow man I'll take my
[47:35] own self to the woodshed I cannot
[47:37] tolerate wrong within me I can't it's
[47:40] just maybe it's maybe it's I don't know
[47:43] if it's if it's if it's OCD or PTSD or
[47:47] whatever it is but I cannot abide if I
[47:50] know I'm wrong in something I have to
[47:52] fix it stop drop and roll a man if
[47:55] you're on fire stop drop and roll now if
[47:58] your own spiritual fire run amen so I
[48:03] want to be part of the solution and so
[48:07] amen all right first Peter chapter four
[48:11] we've been reading this I wanted to read
[48:14] it today I'm continuing on in the arm of
[48:16] the Lord part four I believe in hope and
[48:18] trust by the grace of God this should be
[48:20] the final installment amen if we can get
[48:23] there amen for as much then verse one
[48:25] first Peter chapter four verse one for
[48:28] as much then as Christ hath suffered for
[48:31] us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise
[48:34] with the same mind for he that hath
[48:37] suffered in the flesh hath ceased from
[48:40] sin that he no longer should live the
[48:43] rest of his time in the flesh to the
[48:45] lusts
[48:46] of men but to the will of God for the
[48:49] time past of our life may suffice us to
[48:51] have wrought the will of the Gentiles
[48:53] when we walked in lasciviousness lusts
[48:55] excesses of wine revellings banqueting
[48:58] x' and abominable idolatries Paul
[49:01] doesn't pull any punches there does he
[49:03] does he a man wherein they think it's
[49:07] strange that you run not with them to
[49:09] the same excessive riot
[49:11] speaking evil of you who shall give
[49:14] account to him that is ready to judge
[49:18] the quick and the dead for for this
[49:21] cause was the gospel preached also to
[49:24] them that are dead that they might be
[49:27] judged according to men in the flesh but
[49:29] live according to the God to God in the
[49:33] spirit but the end of all things is at
[49:36] hand be therefore sober and watch unto
[49:39] prayer amen father we thank you for your
[49:43] word today now I'm ending on you Lord
[49:46] we're depending on you we sing it I pray
[49:48] it I believe it I claim it Lord I'm
[49:51] asking in the name of the Lord Jesus
[49:52] Christ that you remember continue to
[49:55] remember all of our sick and afflicted
[49:56] Lord those who have been shut in father
[49:59] those who Lord are trusting in you Lord
[50:03] we're looking for the arm of the Lord to
[50:05] reach out to us today I commit the
[50:08] service and the sermon myself as a
[50:10] vessel into your hands in Jesus name
[50:12] Amen god bless you as you are seated
[50:23] now I want to bring a specific notice in
[50:28] our reading from verses four through six
[50:32] and I'm going to read them for you from
[50:35] the New Living Translation if you have
[50:38] that mat you can put that up if we don't
[50:41] no worries I'm just going to read these
[50:42] three verses from the NLT Paul says of
[50:47] course your former friends are surprised
[50:51] when you no longer plunge into the flood
[50:54] of wild and destructive things they do
[50:56] so they slander you but remember that
[51:01] they will have to face God who stands
[51:04] ready to judge everyone both the living
[51:06] and the dead that is why the good news
[51:10] was preached to those who are now dead
[51:13] so although they were destined to die
[51:16] like all people they now live forever
[51:19] with God in the spirit that's going to
[51:22] become important as we go along you know
[51:27] I see today such an ironic contrast in
[51:31] preaching about being the hand at the
[51:35] end of the arm of the Lord as we have
[51:37] been ministering on you know it's it's
[51:40] it's ironic to me because that you know
[51:44] we've been shut in we've been you know
[51:47] self quarantined you know staying trying
[51:50] to stay out of the public and only
[51:52] moving out for items of necessity when
[51:57] it necessitated when the need
[51:59] necessitated that we go out so so
[52:03] because that we have been bottled up and
[52:06] closed in and been at home and and you
[52:10] know we're I find it ironic to be
[52:13] preaching on and to say you know we're
[52:16] the hand at the end of the arm over the
[52:18] Lord because that that to me that that
[52:22] says that we should be active and we
[52:25] should be on the move and we should be
[52:28] making tracks and making hay while the
[52:30] Sun is up as my dad always used to say
[52:33] and you know it to me it feel you know
[52:38] we're in the Lord's army how many army
[52:39] members we got here today but you know
[52:42] it seems and it feels to me like I've
[52:45] just been sitting around the barracks
[52:46] and I don't know how I'm best better to
[52:49] describe it you know I go out twice a
[52:52] week and I I blow a bugle you know I and
[52:56] raise a flag and you know on Wednesdays
[52:59] and Sundays you know but but but you
[53:02] know it's got to be done
[53:04] so so I just say let's be found faithful
[53:08] and do what we can
[53:10] the point of the matter is yeah i'm
[53:14] really mainly just sitting around the
[53:15] barracks i'm i come here twice a week to
[53:18] blow a bugle and raise a flag and then
[53:20] but but if that's what I can do then
[53:24] then let me do it with zeal and and let
[53:27] me do it with purpose I like a life to
[53:30] be driven by purpose I don't like
[53:32] idleness and so it's it wars against my
[53:36] mind and so you know brother branham
[53:39] tells a story I heard him telling it
[53:41] this morning and about the lady you
[53:46] remember the Irish lady coming in on a
[53:48] ship to New York Harbor half an hour out
[53:50] she comes in till they come into a
[53:52] raging storm
[53:53] they are the captain is sending out SOS
[53:56] you know it's terrible there the hull
[53:58] could breach and and the captain you
[54:01] know brother Branham says before when
[54:02] the ban you know I've been playing there
[54:04] their boogie-woogie and all of this and
[54:06] everybody partying reveling and dancing
[54:08] suddenly now they want to change the
[54:10] music to near my God to thee and the
[54:12] captain is going around and saying
[54:14] everybody needs to pray just pray in
[54:16] your own way and they come up upon this
[54:18] little sister and she's walking the deck
[54:20] just praising God hallelujah glory to
[54:22] God and and the captain says my good
[54:25] lady did did not we say that everybody
[54:28] should pray and she said I'm prayed up a
[54:30] man I don't need to pray my whole life
[54:33] is prayer my man my whole walking
[54:36] talking moving I don't do anything
[54:38] without praying I'm mind lips and my
[54:41] heart is constantly talking to the Lord
[54:44] he says but listen how did you know you
[54:46] hear what I said that in 30 minutes time
[54:49] we're either gonna be in New York Harbor
[54:52] I'll anchor down with the gang gangplank
[54:55] disembarking in 30 minutes or we're
[54:58] gonna be at the bottom of the ocean and
[55:00] she said well sir she said I got one
[55:03] daughter in glory and I'm coming to New
[55:05] York to visit one daughter in New York
[55:07] so in 30 minutes time I'll be with one
[55:10] of them it doesn't matter to me I
[55:11] thought about you know I thought about I
[55:13] thought about that within my own self
[55:15] you know I could we any of us could be
[55:17] driving on I can be driving along headed
[55:19] to my one of my children's house maybe
[55:21] gonna visit my grandchildren you know
[55:23] what on my way there I mean they're
[55:25] gonna see my children and my
[55:27] grandchildren or drive and see my mom or
[55:30] and if that doesn't work then I'm gonna
[55:33] be visiting my dad and two brothers so
[55:35] it doesn't matter to me my life is in
[55:37] his hands and I want it to be like that
[55:42] I want to live you know like he's coming
[55:49] in the morning how should we live here
[55:51] like he's coming in the morning we plan
[55:54] our lives as if it won't be for another
[55:57] century see so brother BAM said if
[56:00] you've got potatoes to plant get them
[56:02] planted if you want to make investments
[56:04] make them and whatever you know you're
[56:07] going to get an education get it you're
[56:09] gonna get a different job get it you're
[56:11] gonna get married get married plan like
[56:14] he's not coming for another century but
[56:17] live your life like he's coming in the
[56:20] morning
[56:20] amen it means something friends I I hope
[56:24] that you have garnered the real burden
[56:27] of my heart and preaching this scripture
[56:30] from who hath believed our report you
[56:33] know because the arm of the Lord has
[56:36] been extended into the world and I have
[56:38] proven to you through three previous
[56:39] installments that the arm of the Lord is
[56:42] Christ and you are the hand on the end
[56:45] of that arm that he was the vine the
[56:48] father was the farmer the gardener and
[56:50] you are the branches that bring forth
[56:52] the fruit that's why brother Brandon
[56:54] would say he
[56:55] got no hands but yours no lips but yours
[56:58] no feet but yours see that body of the
[57:02] Lord Jesus Christ lays on the altar as a
[57:04] memorial and is not picked up
[57:06] corporately until he is ready to return
[57:09] and so now does does that mean he
[57:12] doesn't have an active body no he has an
[57:14] active body you're it I remember years
[57:18] ago brother Bisco told a story heard it
[57:20] probably 30 years ago and he he was
[57:22] telling about how he was in a meeting
[57:24] you know up and up in an Indian village
[57:26] and he was competing with the Catholic
[57:28] priest for the attention of the people
[57:29] and you know the Catholic priest got up
[57:31] and gave the virtues of the church and
[57:33] trying to serve the communion to those
[57:35] to those Native Americans our native
[57:38] Canadians and and and you know he's he's
[57:41] holding up you know this this bread that
[57:44] somebody you know the whole argument is
[57:47] ensuing that this is not the body of the
[57:49] Lord and the Catholic priest is saying
[57:50] but we have you know we have the
[57:53] authority to turn this into the body of
[57:55] the Lord and so he he holds it up
[57:57] brother hit brother mystical sitting
[57:58] behind him and the Catholic priest holds
[58:00] it up and he says behold the body of
[58:02] Christ and brother head said he couldn't
[58:04] take it he rose to his feet raised up
[58:06] his hands and he says that is not the
[58:08] body of Christ I am the body of Christ
[58:12] you are the body of Christ listen
[58:15] friends that's what we're here for
[58:17] that's the purpose of our life so we
[58:25] need to stay brother branham emphasizes
[58:27] over and over in telling that story we
[58:30] need to stay prayed up we need to stay
[58:33] in the veil your whole life should be in
[58:37] the veil you know it I am convinced that
[58:40] I'm going to find three categories of
[58:43] people when we come back to church and
[58:46] and maybe you say you shouldn't be
[58:48] convinced you should have faith well
[58:49] okay I'll I'll go ahead and have faith
[58:52] in a testimony that everybody's going to
[58:54] come back here more spiritual having
[58:57] missed all of these church services but
[58:59] my fear if I judge it based on Man and
[59:02] history and everything that we see I'm
[59:04] probably going to find people who are
[59:07] pretty much
[59:07] the same and I'm going to find people
[59:09] who are worse off than when we took a
[59:11] break but let me say to you today that's
[59:14] not I'm not coming here we're not
[59:15] holding these services to have you stay
[59:17] the same or certainly not to have you
[59:19] worse I want to see us rising I want to
[59:23] see us advancing I want to for me I want
[59:26] to for you
[59:29] it's a sad world that we live in let me
[59:37] build my case today give you a little
[59:40] dose of reality not that you're not
[59:43] aware of it but you know Peter said I
[59:45] stir you up by way of remembrance so
[59:50] that we we don't you know we're not the
[59:52] image of the you know the somebody with
[59:56] their head stuck in the sand we have to
[59:59] stay prayed up if we're the handout on
[1:00:02] the end of the arm and the arm is the
[1:00:05] mediator between God and man and I'm the
[1:00:09] and gods at one end and Christ is in the
[1:00:12] middle and I'm at the other end amen
[1:00:14] hell I love that image and so because
[1:00:17] it's it's not it's not as much
[1:00:19] indicating three persons as it's
[1:00:21] indicating stages I can a God expressing
[1:00:26] himself do you understand
[1:00:27] Christ was the beginning of the creation
[1:00:30] of God and you are the continuation of
[1:00:34] that same creation that's one of the
[1:00:39] beautiful things that the message brings
[1:00:40] out in the Godhead that's what the
[1:00:42] Trinitarians miss that's what the
[1:00:43] oneness miss that's what two lords and
[1:00:46] two souls miss they miss that it's an
[1:00:48] expression a continuation of one God
[1:00:52] expressing himself in his family that's
[1:00:55] the beautiful part of it that's why
[1:00:57] there would be an invisible union of the
[1:00:59] heavenly bridegroom in the earthly bride
[1:01:01] because it's it's husband and wife it
[1:01:03] always has been husband and wife it's
[1:01:05] mates
[1:01:06] it's eternal mates that's what the
[1:01:09] Godhead is about eternal mates
[1:01:12] hallelujah and so we want to be the hand
[1:01:15] at the end of the arm that reaches out
[1:01:18] to the world
[1:01:19] and we need to be that we need to be
[1:01:22] that because because we need to be that
[1:01:25] because it's a very sad world that we
[1:01:30] live in let me build my case such as
[1:01:34] such a sad state and condition that
[1:01:39] mankind finds himself in this dress
[1:01:43] rehearsal pandemic that we speak about
[1:01:46] and literally and we've said this before
[1:01:48] just my way of remembrance it's
[1:01:50] literally brought the mightiest nation
[1:01:52] to the brink it's brought the whole
[1:01:55] world to the brink of economic collapse
[1:01:58] they've had to they've had to enact
[1:02:00] emergency measures just to stay afloat
[1:02:03] and they don't yet know what more they
[1:02:07] will have to do the the World Health
[1:02:10] Organization is announcing get it the
[1:02:14] worst is yet to come now and they're
[1:02:18] saying we haven't seen the worst
[1:02:20] globally yet that's one of their fresh
[1:02:22] announcements it seems that only a few
[1:02:26] months ago you're aware of it I don't
[1:02:29] have to convince you of this it the the
[1:02:34] the liberal left out like this fact but
[1:02:37] it's true it seems that only a few
[1:02:39] months ago the soaring economy had wall
[1:02:43] street literally drunk with wealth and
[1:02:45] success but we find that and we all are
[1:02:49] aware of it God consciousness was in
[1:02:52] sharp decline and that's Israel was the
[1:02:55] same way it doesn't mean that Americans
[1:02:59] are all dirty rats
[1:03:00] it's mankind with his sinful nature
[1:03:03] Israel God said when you're in trouble
[1:03:04] you call him me as soon as I bless you
[1:03:07] you get fat and you forget me see so we
[1:03:13] found that they were literally soaring
[1:03:16] with and drunk with wealth and drunk
[1:03:18] with success but yet God consciousness
[1:03:21] was in sharp decline true spirituality
[1:03:23] and the fear of the Lord all across the
[1:03:27] nation and across the world in such
[1:03:30] sharp decline
[1:03:31] I think that it's not unfair of me to

[1:11:24] contrast they have just months ago they
[1:11:28] were living in a false position a fake
[1:11:33] position wasn't real my position could
[1:11:38] and and their false position led them to
[1:11:41] become a three or four week liquor store
[1:11:43] from a couple of few times a month to a
[1:11:45] three or four a week just to cope it
[1:11:49] shows their position was sinking sand it

[1:11:56] shows my position is solid rock
[1:11:59] hallelujah oh my my position is real
[1:12:04] friends I'm not given the spirit of fear

[1:12:17] there's a real life and there's a fake
[1:12:19] life you know brother Brandon talks
[1:12:24] about those those young women he caught
[1:12:27] in the hallway there you know sing
[1:12:31] Whoopi this is life drinking
[1:12:33] scandalously dressed married women one
[1:12:37] of them a Sunday school teacher and
[1:12:40] brother branham grabbed him forced him
[1:12:42] down to try to pray try to pray for him
[1:12:44] and and and the and he stood back in the
[1:12:48] shadows not wanting not wanting to get
[1:12:49] involved until they said the wrong thing
[1:12:52] and then a prophet couldn't keep still
[1:12:54] and he was sitting there thinking how
[1:12:56] shameful how horrible this is and then
[1:12:58] one of them happened to say it's almost
[1:12:59] like Goliath was fine until until what
[1:13:02] he said got hurt by the wrong man and
[1:13:04] brother branham is standing there as a
[1:13:06] prophet Elijah and one of them gives out
[1:13:08] up will be this is this his life and
[1:13:11] brother Ram said that's it I couldn't
[1:13:12] take it he said I stepped out of the
[1:13:14] shadow I said just a minute sister
[1:13:15] that's a lie said this isn't life this
[1:13:18] is death it's fake life it's fake life
[1:13:24] see it's what the devil has tried to get
[1:13:28] you to say that this is life they had
[1:13:31] believed you know what they had believed
[1:13:33] I thought about the term fake news we
[1:13:35] hear it a lot now Trump didn't invent
[1:13:36] that fake news has been a reality those
[1:13:39] girls were believing the fake news of
[1:13:42] Hollywood in the 1950s brother Brown who
[1:13:47] used their own slogans life starts after
[1:13:50] the Sun Goes Down he said I saw that on
[1:13:51] a magazine sitting on an airplane life
[1:13:53] starts when the Sun Goes Down he said
[1:13:55] life don't start with the Sun Goes Down
[1:13:57] sinning starts when the Sun Goes Down
[1:13:59] that's a time when devils go on the
[1:14:01] loose Paul said you're not of the
[1:14:03] children of the darkness you're children
[1:14:05] of the light you're not like them you're
[1:14:08] not going to be destroyed with them you
[1:14:10] have a different ending than them you
[1:14:11] have a different purpose than them you
[1:14:14] have a different reason for living than
[1:14:16] them
[1:14:17] see so it was all was all fake news it
[1:14:22] was all fake life Hollywood is a fake
[1:14:25] life of course it is
[1:14:29] you know crime-fighting superheroes
[1:14:32] romance heroes main character heroes in
[1:14:35] some epic adventure you know life being
[1:14:38] lived in the imagination of people's
[1:14:41] fantasies seeing that wanting to be that
[1:14:45] person modelling themselves you said all
[1:14:48] the time people adopt haircuts they
[1:14:51] adopt clothing styles they adopt you
[1:14:54] know they start looking like the image
[1:14:56] of what they're enamoured by oh you
[1:14:59] can't hide now see this is this you know
[1:15:02] that's true we've seen it we've seen it
[1:15:07] in ourselves amen
[1:15:11] life is being lived in this day and time
[1:15:14] it's being lived in the imagination of
[1:15:17] people's fantasies listen friends all
[1:15:19] professional sports we tell my Hollywood
[1:15:21] is all fake life professional sports you
[1:15:25] know for almost all humans it's fake
[1:15:28] life even fantasy leagues that they
[1:15:34] create you know to satisfy a craving for
[1:15:36] that to be their life some people are
[1:15:40] like fantasy what I mean there's
[1:15:42] professional sports casters won't have
[1:15:44] anything to do with it like no we don't
[1:15:45] do fantasy stuff we do real life they
[1:15:49] see the the idiocy of it people and I'm
[1:15:52] not here I'm not here to condemn it I'm
[1:15:54] just saying okay fine I've never done it
[1:15:55] I've never understood if you're in it
[1:15:57] fine whatever not preaching against that
[1:15:59] you understand not preaching I've
[1:16:01] cheered my favorite team plenty ass I'm
[1:16:04] not here preaching about that getting it
[1:16:06] clear you know that that's not my point
[1:16:08] but do you realize that that you take
[1:16:10] the NFL do you realize that all those
[1:16:12] all the boys that start playing football
[1:16:14] at pal's level that aren't that less
[1:16:17] than 1% of every boy that ever puts on a
[1:16:21] helmet and carries a football less than
[1:16:24] 1% including the ones who go through
[1:16:27] high school when championships go to
[1:16:28] college
[1:16:29] less than 1% make it to the pro leagues
[1:16:33] less than 1% see so it supports my
[1:16:39] statement all professional sports at
[1:16:41] every level for almost all humans is
[1:16:43] fake life you're never going to be that
[1:16:46] but yet the devil will get you so
[1:16:48] enamored that you will burn up your
[1:16:50] useful valuable time to serve God and
[1:16:54] you're chasing something that's fake
[1:16:58] it'll never be realized you're trying to
[1:17:00] be a Hollywood star you come on

[1:17:11] something live for eternal purposes
[1:17:14] you're the hand on the end of the arm
[1:17:18] that is attached to Almighty God say
[1:17:26] well but isn't it true that 1% I could
[1:17:30] be I could be that one ok what if you
[1:17:33] did what do they have the 1% what do
[1:17:36] they have if they make it what do they
[1:17:39] want what does the 1% have if they make
[1:17:43] it the Bible says I saw the dead both
[1:17:47] small and great stand before God the
[1:17:51] books were opened and another book was
[1:17:53] opened which is the book of life I'm
[1:17:56] here to tell you that book of life is
[1:17:57] all that matters even if you happen to
[1:18:01] be the 1% what are you God at the end of
[1:18:03] it all oh my my friends that's why
[1:18:08] brother Brandon would say you're not
[1:18:10] even living until you're born again
[1:18:13] every day you wake up in an unconverted
[1:18:16] state you're just one day closer to your
[1:18:18] death sentence that you were born with
[1:18:23] no one can commute that sentence except
[1:18:26] the giver of life himself only the great
[1:18:31] judge can do away with all of your
[1:18:34] former life and make you stand perfect
[1:18:36] in the sight of God and gain eternal
[1:18:38] life and be freed from the bondage of
[1:18:40] sin that you're born into
[1:18:42] hallelujah you're not even you're not
[1:18:45] even living all the people chasing
[1:18:49] Hollywood and all of Hollywood being
[1:18:51] chased and all the professional sports
[1:18:54] being chased and even the 1% anybody I'm
[1:18:58] including any and every and all globally
[1:19:00] who have not been born again they're
[1:19:03] there they're only being turned into the
[1:19:05] very image of the tribulation they're
[1:19:08] headed for I said that knew weeks ago
[1:19:10] it's still true today that's what you
[1:19:13] see happening to the world anybody I
[1:19:15] don't care how big their yacht is
[1:19:17] they're being transformed into the image
[1:19:19] of the tribulation they're headed I
[1:19:21] don't care how big their contract is I
[1:19:23] don't care how how much how many how
[1:19:25] many how much of a presence they have in
[1:19:27] the world be whatever they want a king a
[1:19:29] dictator they're being transformed into
[1:19:34] the very image of the tribulation
[1:19:35] they're headed into the tribulation
[1:19:37] they're headed into a such a perversion
[1:19:39] of life it's going to so unfairly
[1:19:42] penalize mankind he will be the victim
[1:19:47] of his own demise it is not as said it
[1:19:51] is not a you know an evil god that's
[1:19:55] going to do that God is simply allowing
[1:19:58] man to destroy himself God has spent
[1:20:01] 6,000 years trying every way to save
[1:20:05] every person he possibly could who would
[1:20:08] accept his pardon yes friends brother
[1:20:18] branham talks about that dimension of
[1:20:20] Hell he calls it a nightmare that you
[1:20:28] can't wake up from
[1:20:32] that's pretty real
[1:20:34] that gives real thoughtful description
[1:20:40] hell is not a metaphor hell is not a
[1:20:44] parable as the Seventh day Adventist
[1:20:46] think I think it's seventh-day Adventist
[1:20:48] thing it's just a metaphor I know that
[1:20:51] Jehovah's Witness don't believe you know
[1:20:53] they they certainly sell believe it is I
[1:20:55] think it's unfair to say its seventh day
[1:20:57] I think it was Jehovah's Witness I'm
[1:20:58] confusing and they even when they go to
[1:21:02] Jesus telling the story of the rich
[1:21:05] young ruler in hell he lifted up his
[1:21:07] eyes they say that's just a parable it's
[1:21:09] hyperbole he's dead there's not a
[1:21:11] literal place like that which I don't
[1:21:13] believe that because Jesus says there
[1:21:15] was a man see so so so but but but the
[1:21:22] point is he said don't ever let anyone
[1:21:25] tell you there's not a real devil don't
[1:21:29] let anyone tell you that hell's not a
[1:21:31] real place because if they can convince
[1:21:34] you of that then they can convince you
[1:21:36] that God's not real in Heaven's not a
[1:21:38] real place and I think I would be of all
[1:21:41] men most miserable having tasted of this
[1:21:44] seven-course meal may it be like
[1:21:46] inviting me to a big banquet and walking
[1:21:48] me in and letting me look at it in my
[1:21:50] and slobbering with oh my goodness the
[1:21:53] it's so glorious and they tapped me say
[1:21:54] sorry you don't actually get to eat it
[1:21:56] you have to leave now we just wanted you
[1:21:58] to see it
[1:21:59] I decided herethen ever seen it I'd
[1:22:02] rather never seen it don't tell me about
[1:22:04] it now Paul said I'd be above all men
[1:22:06] most miserable because Paul had already
[1:22:08] been caught up to a third heaven Paul
[1:22:09] had already seen and heard things said
[1:22:11] if I don't get to go there I'd rather
[1:22:12] never heard it Oh
[1:22:14] friends I am I in one since I'm so glad
[1:22:17] that I heard about it but it makes me
[1:22:20] shiver to think what if I what if I
[1:22:22] didn't have it oh but then I fall back
[1:22:25] and I say wait a minute
[1:22:27] there was a family in the mind of God
[1:22:29] before the foundation of the world and I
[1:22:31] am the happy finder that I was part of
[1:22:34] that family hallelujah
[1:22:38] it's a nightmare brother branham said
[1:22:41] you can't wake up from people who find
[1:22:45] themselves suddenly in that dimension
[1:22:49] people who have and people who do in
[1:22:54] this very real dimension place and
[1:22:59] another dimension just as real as this
[1:23:02] one they're going to find they're going
[1:23:07] to realize that they were living a fake
[1:23:11] life all along in the earth one day
[1:23:21] saying farewell words to their family
[1:23:24] being put under a medically-induced
[1:23:27] condition so that you can be intubated
[1:23:30] the next time they wake up they're in a
[1:23:34] nightmare they can't wake up from
[1:23:36] say you're judging I'm not judging I'm
[1:23:38] as if I just play the law of averages
[1:23:40] alone if I just play the law of human
[1:23:43] averages I'm gonna be right most of the
[1:23:45] time I my trust and my hope is that
[1:23:49] nobody in the right mind would come to
[1:23:52] that position and not make their heart
[1:23:53] right the problem is so many don't have
[1:23:56] the right mind because they've allowed
[1:23:59] Satan to corrupt and poison their mind
[1:24:01] with fake life fake news about what life
[1:24:07] is fake news from Hollywood fake news
[1:24:10] from the from the entertainment industry
[1:24:13] fake news from the recreation and sports
[1:24:15] teams fake news from the politician and
[1:24:18] the worst of all fake news from the
[1:24:20] pulpits that are supposed to tell us the
[1:24:22] truth and because pulpits that do tell
[1:24:27] them the truth are held in derision and
[1:24:29] condemned as fanatic it's always been
[1:24:32] that way it will always be that way why
[1:24:37] are you preaching on today because I
[1:24:39] gotta try to convince anyone I can I
[1:24:41] already know I can't convince them all
[1:24:44] but I hope I convincing you today I hope
[1:24:46] I'm convincing you today I hope we're
[1:24:48] all being convinced so I don't want fake
[1:24:51] life I want real life
[1:24:53] hallelujah people who find themselves
[1:24:58] sudden that dimension are going to
[1:25:01] realize they were living fake life he
[1:25:04] already had them asleep and walking
[1:25:07] around in a dream of life slowly they
[1:25:12] didn't realize that day by day every day
[1:25:15] that they spurned God every day that
[1:25:18] they didn't do what was necessary to
[1:25:20] save themselves as Peter said save
[1:25:23] yourselves from this untoward generation
[1:25:25] and every day they didn't do that they
[1:25:27] walked around in their dream life slowly
[1:25:30] descending into a state of complete
[1:25:32] madness we see it on the streets today
[1:25:34] until as the Bible says of the rich
[1:25:37] young ruler in hell he lifted up his
[1:25:41] eyes it's interesting because the first
[1:25:48] time that that term was even used in the
[1:25:53] Bible give me Genesis 13 10 brothers
[1:25:57] brother Joe brother Matt somebody
[1:25:59] Genesis 13 10 the first time that term
[1:26:05] is used Genesis 13 10 is lot lifting up
[1:26:09] his eyes to Sodom Abraham had come to
[1:26:13] him and says you know you pick you
[1:26:15] choose and whatever you choose I'll go
[1:26:17] the other way and lot here it is first
[1:26:19] time in the Bible this term is used and
[1:26:22] lot lifted up his eyes now this is just
[1:26:26] like the rich young ruler he lifted up
[1:26:29] his eyes and he saw Abraham in hell he
[1:26:34] lifted up his eyes and lot lifted up his
[1:26:37] eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan
[1:26:40] pay attention now watch this that it was
[1:26:43] well watered everywhere before the Lord
[1:26:46] destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the
[1:26:49] Garden of Eden like the land of Egypt as
[1:26:51] thou comest and Azure so now I want you
[1:26:56] to catch something here what look like
[1:27:01] what would it look like to lot at that
[1:27:05] time
[1:27:06] was not how it would end it only looked
[1:27:12] like that at the moment little did he
[1:27:16] know God had a calendar and God had a
[1:27:21] tenth and God had a calculator and God
[1:27:24] had been keeping a record of the sins of
[1:27:27] Sodom and Gomorrah and what what
[1:27:30] exacerbated what is the real Grindr of
[1:27:33] it is that God had blessed them with
[1:27:37] abundance and beauty and fern fertile
[1:27:40] and rainin and the land was fertile in
[1:27:43] the it was beautiful like Egypt andhe's
[1:27:46] or it was gorgeous and the people
[1:27:48] instead of being thankful to God got fat
[1:27:51] and became decadent and became perverted
[1:27:54] and God was keeping a record I was
[1:27:59] keeping a record and it was it was being
[1:28:03] amplified by powers of magnitude because
[1:28:05] they they had been given so much that it
[1:28:09] made their sin that much more egregious
[1:28:12] and he lifted up his eyes like they are
[1:28:17] doing today to what look like success
[1:28:21] but it but they didn't realize that
[1:28:23] prophecy was going to come to pass and
[1:28:26] it wasn't going to take all that long
[1:28:27] and everything that he thought he was
[1:28:30] seeing was was a mirage it was just a
[1:28:32] fake it way it looked real at the time
[1:28:34] and you can even put your finger on
[1:28:36] things today I know you could I'm not
[1:28:38] I'm not dumb I know that we could put
[1:28:40] our things on things in the world ago
[1:28:41] well this ain't bad this ain't bad this
[1:28:43] is good and this is good and you got to
[1:28:44] give credit this Shore they were good
[1:28:46] they had beauty it was true it was real
[1:28:49] but it wasn't gonna last because their
[1:28:52] sin was going to undo it and God was
[1:28:55] going to destroy it what a faithful
[1:28:57] decision what made when he lifted up his
[1:29:01] eyes and looked to the world's beauty
[1:29:07] what it looked like was not how it would
[1:29:10] end
[1:29:10] that's a principle we need to learn well
[1:29:12] and think about it think about a young
[1:29:15] person think about a teenager not here
[1:29:18] too
[1:29:19] so you but I'm here to tell you that you
[1:29:21] are your your largely unaware your your
[1:29:24] eyesight of life it just isn't keen
[1:29:27] enough yet to discern the mirages of
[1:29:31] life yet many times even even your
[1:29:35] elders many times even your elders have
[1:29:38] a hard time not learning the lessons
[1:29:39] that life has taught them I've failed to
[1:29:43] learn lessons even and I'm I'm 57 soon
[1:29:47] be 57 years old been reading God's Word
[1:29:49] since a boy hearing its story since a
[1:29:51] boy believing it since a child and even
[1:29:53] today I still stumble and make the same
[1:29:55] mistakes twice so think about a young
[1:30:00] person think about a teenager let me
[1:30:02] give you the best advice I could ever
[1:30:04] give you if you never hear brother Jason
[1:30:05] again you'll go away with the best
[1:30:07] advice I could ever give you make this
[1:30:09] your road map make this your guide make
[1:30:13] this what you live your life because
[1:30:15] this isn't fake and this isn't passing
[1:30:18] away what it looks like now is what
[1:30:21] it'll look like in a hundred years
[1:30:24] hallelujah
[1:30:25] oh my from this false dream of life to
[1:30:30] Lucifer's nightmare that you don't wake
[1:30:32] up from until Judgment Day
[1:30:35] you're bound over for trial people you
[1:30:39] know you get asked as a preacher people
[1:30:41] finding your preacher your chaplain they
[1:30:43] see this they start asking questions
[1:30:45] you know what about Hell what about
[1:30:46] heaven what about God what about the
[1:30:47] devil what about this what about that
[1:30:49] you know I think we need to have a ready
[1:30:54] answer so I study we need to have a
[1:30:58] studied answer the world needs an answer
[1:31:02] that makes sense and we've got the
[1:31:04] answers that make sense
[1:31:06] hell is certainly a real place people
[1:31:08] really go there God doesn't send them
[1:31:10] there they go there in spite of his
[1:31:13] efforts to keep him from going there he
[1:31:16] didn't build hell for men for men hell
[1:31:18] hath enlarged itself because it isn't
[1:31:20] overcrowded prison and had to receive
[1:31:22] people and it was never built for that
[1:31:24] it was built for the devil and his
[1:31:26] angels and so you know from from this
[1:31:30] false dream say well well is it a
[1:31:32] burning flow
[1:31:32] no not yet it's not a literal lake of
[1:31:34] fire what is it you're bound over for
[1:31:36] trial just like if you got convicted of
[1:31:40] a if you got arrested tomorrow and you'd
[1:31:43] be bound over for trial unless you could
[1:31:45] bail out er
[1:31:45] our RoR or somebody put up a lot of
[1:31:48] money to let you get out and then you
[1:31:50] still have to hang around and show up in
[1:31:52] court
[1:31:52] in other words but if you can you're
[1:31:54] bound over and I'm here to tell you you
[1:31:56] go to the devil's prison house what we
[1:31:58] call Hell nobody's paying your bail
[1:32:01] there's there's no such thing as praying
[1:32:04] you out of purgatory I'm here to tell
[1:32:08] you I don't care how much mama cries at
[1:32:10] your funeral you're not getting bailed
[1:32:12] out you're bound over for trial it's a
[1:32:18] false dream today this life that it's
[1:32:21] Lucifer's nightmare from a false dream
[1:32:24] of life to a nightmare you can't wake up
[1:32:29] from
[1:32:30] you're bound over for trial until the
[1:32:33] day of judgment let's say you this
[1:32:38] morning courtroom have I made my case
[1:32:40] have I made my case I started out saying
[1:32:43] this is a sad world and I'm gonna prove
[1:32:46] it today oh I'm here to tell you about
[1:32:48] another world that's not sad I'm here to
[1:32:52] tell you that even in this life you can
[1:32:54] have joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:32:57] that even your life here in Satan's
[1:33:00] dreamworld
[1:33:01] you can be alive you can be born again
[1:33:03] and be living and have a different
[1:33:05] master hallelujah and I love it now
[1:33:11] let's carry on brother Joe and in verses
[1:33:14] 14 and 15 Genesis 13 14 15 now watching
[1:33:17] come to Abram law has already lifted up
[1:33:21] his eyes verse 14 and the Lord said unto
[1:33:23] Abram after that lot was separated from
[1:33:27] him lift up now thine eyes second time
[1:33:30] second time in history you find this
[1:33:33] statement lift up now thine eyes and
[1:33:35] look from the place where thou art
[1:33:38] northward and southward and eastward and
[1:33:42] westward for all the land which
[1:33:45] seest to thee will I give it and to thy
[1:33:49] seed forever I wanted to emphasize to
[1:33:58] you first Peter four four through six
[1:34:02] again so let me read it again for you
[1:34:05] from the New Living Translation don't
[1:34:07] bother putting it up for the brother Joe
[1:34:09] unless you have NLT but we read in 1st
[1:34:12] Peter 4 verses 4 through 6 now listen
[1:34:16] you used to run with these wild
[1:34:20] revellings and parties and drinks
[1:34:23] lasciviousness that's and and and all
[1:34:26] kinds of sinful decadence but Paul says
[1:34:30] but you don't run that way no more but
[1:34:33] here here you when you get born again
[1:34:36] you create a new paradigm because now
[1:34:40] the people that used to be your friends
[1:34:43] suddenly think you're weird
[1:34:45] they even criticize you I've had it
[1:34:48] happen I doubt if there's anybody in
[1:34:49] there who hasn't had that happen
[1:34:51] especially if you lived a life of sin
[1:34:53] and ran with the wrong people and now
[1:34:55] you're serving God they don't understand
[1:34:56] you anymore
[1:34:59] Paul says of course your former friends
[1:35:02] are surprised when you no longer plunge
[1:35:04] now let me let me set this up right
[1:35:06] because you're about to see a contrast
[1:35:08] between verse 4 and verses 5 and 6 ok so
[1:35:15] there's gonna be a contrast now watch of
[1:35:18] course your former friends think about
[1:35:20] Joe are surprised when you no longer
[1:35:23] plunge into the flood of wild and
[1:35:26] destructive things they do so they
[1:35:28] slander you you got that one but
[1:35:31] remember now watch the contrast but
[1:35:34] remember that they will have to face God
[1:35:37] who stands ready to judge everyone both
[1:35:40] the living and the dead that is why the
[1:35:42] good news was preached to those who are
[1:35:45] now dead so although then this is those
[1:35:47] who used to be dead who are now alive so
[1:35:50] although they were destined to die like
[1:35:52] all people you were destined to die just
[1:35:54] like them now they live forever with God
[1:35:59] in the spirit so in verse in verses five
[1:36:04] and six in contrast to verse four Peter
[1:36:08] is encouraging his readers with this
[1:36:11] fact that rather than facing judgment
[1:36:14] for their sins
[1:36:15] we all got him hey man we've all had
[1:36:19] them we all got them but Peters trying
[1:36:22] to encourage his readers that rather
[1:36:25] than facing judgment for your sins that
[1:36:28] like everybody else that those who had
[1:36:31] heard and believed the gospel of Jesus
[1:36:34] Christ faced a different future I'm here
[1:36:37] to tell you you facing a different
[1:36:40] future you had a sure future you're in
[1:36:43] Satan's dream of fake life you were
[1:36:46] headed to Satan's nightmare I bound over
[1:36:48] for trial no way to get out of it but
[1:36:50] now you have a different future
[1:36:53] hallelujah oh my friends in heaven
[1:36:57] that's where I'll have real life I'll
[1:36:59] never lust after fake life again this
[1:37:01] body will be changed in a moment thank
[1:37:04] God thank God thank God oh thank god let
[1:37:09] us come awake let me say to today let us
[1:37:11] come awake from Lucifer's dream the god
