[1:50] if i recognize him
[1:54] all right christopher that's not fair
[1:57] well i tell you who it is it's my
[1:58] grandmother it's my grandmother that's
[2:01] as far back as i remember i would have
[2:03] been about that was my daddy's mom
[2:06] i would have been about two and a half
[2:08] three years old or something like that i
[2:10] remember going to grandma's house one
[2:11] day and she had a good cook stove and we
[2:14] all lived on the same street we lived on
[2:16] west 15th street in north carolina
[2:19] grandma lived a couple houses below us i
[2:21] was in her house one day and she had a
[2:24] wood cook stove most people did
[2:26] and i remember what are you doing
[2:29] she was putting something in the stove
[2:32] and she was making cookies
[2:34] i know we got a lot of cookie making
[2:36] grandmas in here
[2:38] now i was not a cookie making grandma
[2:41] i confess that you can ask my boys i was
[2:44] not
[2:45] but i when i went to the store i bought
[2:47] them the best cookies that store had the
[2:49] us
[2:50] that was mine well anyway that was my
[2:52] grandmother
[2:55] the next thing i remember back in my
[2:57] youth
[2:59] i was exactly three and a half years old
[3:01] i have documents for that that's how i
[3:03] know how that was
[3:05] i went to grandma's house
[3:08] and it something was strange to you
[3:11] gotta think three and a half year old
[3:13] thought something was strange it was
[3:15] different
[3:17] all the furniture had been moved out of
[3:18] the room
[3:20] and then set up some folding chairs
[3:24] and i looked and over on one side of the
[3:26] wall was a casket
[3:28] someone lifted me up
[3:31] literally my grandmother hefner
[3:33] in the casket that was my first
[3:35] experience with
[3:38] you come into the world you're gonna die
[3:39] if you don't go in the rapture
[3:44] that was 1944
[3:46] the war was still going on during that
[3:48] time world war ii
[3:50] now america we didn't have fighting over
[3:52] here but our voice was fighting in the
[3:54] other country
[3:56] and it was a scary time for a child i
[3:58] think about them little kids in ukraine
[4:01] they're never going to get over this
[4:03] because you just don't get over it
[4:04] because we didn't have words that i was
[4:06] terrified
[4:08] because we had blackout curtains
[4:11] during the war you had blackout curtains
[4:13] i remember seeing my dad and put up a
[4:14] blackout curtain dead what weren't you
[4:16] doing that for
[4:18] you had to close all your all your
[4:20] windows no car lights no street lights
[4:23] everything pitch black
[4:25] because we were under threats of wartime
[4:28] and the cold war after that
[4:30] and if if a plane flew over with bombs
[4:33] you didn't want to be a target for them
[4:35] that's why we had blackout birds
[4:39] then as a child you know you hear talk
[4:41] as a child i never hear him talk about a
[4:43] jew
[4:45] oh what's a jesus i never heard that
[4:47] name before that's the first time i've
[4:49] ever heard the name of a jew
[4:51] and
[4:52] so anyway have any of y'all ever saw a
[4:54] flying saucer
[4:57] are you going to see one now
[5:00] 1947
[5:02] the same time israel was becoming a
[5:05] nation and the angel of the lord was
[5:07] appearing to brother brown
[5:09] an airline pilot saw
[5:12] something in the sky
[5:13] and he called it a flying saucer now we
[5:16] know it's not they know now it's ufos
[5:19] unidentified flying objects we know it's
[5:21] investigating angels so i'm six years
[5:25] old and i go outside
[5:29] where's that flying saucer i don't i
[5:31] didn't see the flying saucer
[5:33] but there was a great fear on me because
[5:35] i was a child you hear talk about war
[5:38] and
[5:38] every little sound i would hear in the
[5:40] night it was a plane going to drop a
[5:42] bomb on us
[5:44] i remember one night in particular
[5:46] we lived in a two-story house on old
[5:48] house and mama slept with the little
[5:50] ones then the bigger one slept in
[5:53] another bed and you had to go clean
[5:56] around the other side of the house to go
[5:57] to bed daddy's bed he had a half bed
[6:00] between bed
[6:02] i woke up one night terrified
[6:04] i was just
[6:05] i was about four or five years old and i
[6:07] was trembling i was so scared
[6:11] well if because i guess i heard noises
[6:13] and i thought was gonna be bombed or
[6:14] something
[6:15] i don't know if i can just get the daddy
[6:18] and get in bed every day
[6:20] we all know how protective daddy's hard
[6:22] well i couldn't get better mama other
[6:24] kids was in there
[6:26] well if i'm just getting better daddy
[6:28] i'll be okay
[6:29] so i get up in the dark pitch black
[6:31] spooky house and
[6:33] walked all the way around today's room
[6:37] if i'm just getting better with daddy
[6:39] off i'll be okay
[6:41] there was daddy in the bed sound asleep
[6:44] so was my little brother in the bed
[6:48] i couldn't get in bed with daddy he only
[6:49] had a twin
[6:51] so i stood there just shaking shaking
[6:54] and daddy woke up
[6:56] i don't know why but daddy woke up and
[6:58] asked me what i wanted to drink water
[7:01] so he put me back to the
[7:03] bedroom where i slept and he went out on
[7:06] the porch because our our water was out
[7:08] on the back porch uh we called it a
[7:10] spigot i don't know what you'll call it
[7:12] today but we got water out of it
[7:14] so anyway that that was that was really
[7:17] a scary time
[7:20] my mom and dad didn't go to church
[7:22] they weren't christians
[7:24] they were good people mom and dad were
[7:26] good upright citizens worked hard took
[7:28] care of those kids but they weren't
[7:30] christians
[7:32] but my ain't that that was the picture
[7:34] of my mom and dad when they were young
[7:36] they weren't christians
[7:38] but my aunt now did and she lived right
[7:41] up the street from us
[7:43] and she was daddy's sister
[7:45] and around about a block on 13th street
[7:49] was a methodist church
[7:51] and she would combine because we walked
[7:53] everywhere she would come by on sunday
[7:55] morning and take me and my little
[7:57] brother
[7:59] to to sunday school that impacted us i
[8:02] still have the certificate where i got
[8:04] from that sunday school
[8:06] 1947.
[8:08] and
[8:09] ain't now still to this day has a
[8:12] special place in my heart
[8:13] for taking me to sunday school
[8:16] and then
[8:18] 1948 come back
[8:21] and in 1948 before they come out with
[8:24] the polio vaccine every summer
[8:27] parents were terrified for their
[8:29] children
[8:30] adults too but mainly children
[8:33] and my mama had a younger brother me and
[8:35] him were the same age we were seven
[8:37] years old
[8:38] he took polio
[8:41] now we were children couldn't go nowhere
[8:43] you couldn't leave your house you
[8:44] couldn't leave the yard adults not
[8:46] children
[8:48] and he died with polio within a matter
[8:50] of days and so did his little playmate
[8:53] that was the same age they both died
[8:55] with polio
[8:57] i'm thankful for the
[8:59] that we're not troubled with that a lot
[9:01] anymore
[9:04] then
[9:04] a little bit longer i was in the third
[9:07] grade and just got in the third grade
[9:09] and we moved out to the country in a
[9:11] place called potty woods
[9:14] now y'all are not going yeah
[9:17] we lived in a chicken house
[9:19] it was mentally ill
[9:26] they told us it was a little we moved
[9:28] from a two-story house it was a little
[9:30] four-room house they said it used to be
[9:32] a chicken house and they made it we
[9:34] lived in it so
[9:37] we lived there when i was in the third
[9:39] grade we moved there when i was in third
[9:41] grade and then in the fourth grade
[9:43] they you know how schools have events i
[9:46] guess they still
[9:48] they did back when i was a kid you know
[9:50] you'd have special events
[9:52] um that wouldn't have a lot of
[9:54] musical events um they would come
[9:57] through and hold
[9:58] whole things and then they would have
[10:00] talent contests
[10:02] so i was in the fourth grade so
[10:05] they knew my son
[10:06] so they wanted different ones more than
[10:08] me to enter the shower contest so
[10:12] well okay but i didn't have a way we was
[10:14] out in the country on the dirt road but
[10:16] the neighbors were going and the
[10:18] neighbors invited me to ride with them
[10:20] now i'm walking up to their house i'm 10
[10:22] years old i'm walking up to their house
[10:25] on the dirt road
[10:27] and i'm praying
[10:28] now where did i learn to pray
[10:31] not for my mom and dad they weren't
[10:33] christians
[10:35] and i prayed a prayer
[10:37] i don't know why i prayed it but i
[10:38] prayed it i said lord if you just let me
[10:40] win this contest i promise i'll go to
[10:42] church
[10:43] well
[10:47] i won that contest
[10:50] did i go to church no
[10:54] i didn't have a church to go to we were
[10:56] out in the country we didn't have a car
[10:58] then
[10:59] and there was no church available so no
[11:03] but you know god expects us even as
[11:05] children
[11:06] to keep our word now where did i learn
[11:08] to pray
[11:10] and ask god i'll go back i got that from
[11:12] my nail taking me to sunday school it's
[11:15] very important to take children with
[11:17] something school it marked me for life
[11:19] wow
[11:20] you got a pastor today because of that
[11:23] and
[11:24] grandson because that folks some great
[11:26] grandsons one day hopefully i know
[11:29] you're right started off real good
[11:31] [Music]
[11:35] anyway
[11:38] we moved back into town we moved a lot
[11:40] we moved back into town
[11:42] and when we moved back into town my
[11:45] mother and daddy both worked in cotton
[11:47] mills we had a lot of factories back
[11:49] there
[11:50] and that is you could two three minutes
[11:52] you could be at daddy's work well there
[11:54] were men at daddy's work
[11:56] from the baptist church and they were
[11:59] wanting to hold a prayer meeting in our
[12:01] home
[12:02] and so um
[12:04] they were i guess trying to get members
[12:06] for the baptist church and they were
[12:08] going around that when they said a
[12:09] prayer meeting it wasn't getting down
[12:11] and praying
[12:12] it was little many church services that
[12:15] was what it was
[12:17] so anyway during that time
[12:20] that was going on
[12:22] i was 11 years old
[12:24] and i was playing with one of my friends
[12:26] in the neighborhood one day named katie
[12:29] and then her were playing and her family
[12:32] had an old gentleman to come visit
[12:35] i don't remember his name i just
[12:37] remember he come out talking to me and k
[12:40] and he taught us how to play patty cake
[12:43] probably a lot of you girls know how to
[12:45] play that we didn't know how but we sure
[12:47] wore it out after he taught us
[12:52] well he taught us something else
[12:54] that i've never forgotten stuck with me
[12:56] all my life
[12:58] he taught us about a drunk
[13:01] a man named tom gray back then you could
[13:04] write a song
[13:05] about people and call their name
[13:08] nowadays you probably get lawsuits but
[13:10] his name was tom gray
[13:12] and he was a bad drunk
[13:16] matthew
[13:18] he was a bad drunk
[13:25] that's beautiful really
[13:28] so now
[13:31] here's the story he told about concrete
[13:36] tom gray lay down on the bar room floor
[13:39] having drank so much he couldn't drink
[13:41] anymore
[13:42] and he fell asleep with the trouble
[13:44] grown
[13:45] to dream that he rode on the hillbound
[13:48] train
[13:49] the engine with blood was red and down
[13:51] and dismal lit
[13:53] the brimstone mount an elk for fuel was
[13:56] shoveling bones
[13:57] and the furnace roared with a thousand
[13:59] grounds
[14:00] the boiler was filled with lag or deer
[14:03] and the devil himself was the engineer
[14:05] the passengers made such a motley crew
[14:08] church members also gentle and few
[14:11] richmond and broadhoff and bakers and
[14:13] rags handsome young ladies
[14:15] and weather dope hats yellow and black
[14:18] men red and white
[14:19] chained off together a horrible sight
[14:22] faster and faster the engine flew wilder
[14:24] and wider the country grew louder and
[14:27] louder the thunder clash brighter and
[14:29] brighter the lightning flashed hotter
[14:31] and hotter the air became too close were
[14:33] burned
[14:34] from each quivering frame
[14:36] and in the distance was hurting to cry
[14:38] oh ho crook the devil we're here in hell
[14:41] oh how passengers shriek with pain
[14:43] begged the devil to stop the train but
[14:45] he scampered about him he danced with
[14:47] glee and laughed and joked in their
[14:49] agony
[14:50] my faithful friends you have done my
[14:52] work and the devil can never a painful
[14:54] shirt you voted the weak you brought the
[14:57] poor and the hungry brother have
[14:59] turned from your door you've gathered up
[15:01] gold brick haters rust and given free
[15:05] bent to your hellish lust you've drank
[15:07] and rotted and murdered in light and
[15:09] mocked at god
[15:10] in your health on christ
[15:12] get faithful fair
[15:14] so i'll carry you through for it's only
[15:16] right that you get your due
[15:18] for every labor is worth his hair so i'm
[15:21] glad you say in my lake of fire
[15:24] where my pharynx will torment you
[15:26] forever
[15:27] all in vain
[15:29] you will cry for a savior
[15:32] then tom wilker
[15:34] with an awful cry
[15:36] his clothes soaking wet his hair
[15:38] standing high and he prayed as he never
[15:41] prayed before
[15:42] to be safe from heaven the devil's power
[15:45] his crying and praying
[15:47] was not in vain
[15:49] for he never more rude on that hillbound
[15:52] train
[16:02] about that same time those men where my
[16:04] daddy worked
[16:06] they wanted to hold a prayer meeting our
[16:07] home and they did
[16:09] but i was out playing probably right
[16:11] doing this
[16:13] and they held a prayer meeting in their
[16:15] home
[16:17] i was
[16:18] 11 years old
[16:20] and my mom and daddy both give their
[16:22] lives to the lord
[16:23] they both got saved that's
[16:26] looking back that's where we started
[16:29] and here we come then jason and
[16:32] jonathan and matthew christopher all of
[16:34] y'all
[16:35] jonathan gideon all y'all that's where
[16:37] you started with my mom and dad
[16:40] for my nail too
[16:42] mom and daddy both got saved did they
[16:44] get the real goods yes they did mom and
[16:46] daddy really changed it really changed
[16:49] their life
[16:50] so we started going to church

[17:00] went to
[17:02] and because and we had you know little
[17:04] ones we couldn't walk it's a good two

[17:09] church bus
[17:11] and they were serving we went there
[17:12] service we did not miss a service we
[17:14] loved church
[17:15] so they'd send the church bus after us

[20:23] pentecostal church revival
[20:27] now we knew better
[20:29] but we didn't then mom and daddy were
[20:30] brand new christians
[20:33] the visiting preacher was a woman it was
[20:35] a woman preacher she was pretty good
[20:41] so we went and and they said there was a
[20:44] man there come in with crutches and live
[20:46] without
[20:48] but we've never heard nothing like that
[20:50] before
[20:51] so we went back again
[20:55] and i don't remember if we went two
[20:56] times or three times but the last night
[20:58] we were there
[21:01] they had a service and they had of some
[21:03] sort of an altar called but remember
[21:05] exactly what it was
[21:08] and now i'm 11 years old this time
[21:12] and there's a great desire and need to
[21:14] go to the answer
[21:16] never had that before
[21:18] didn't know what to do about it but i
[21:20] had just a deep desire go to the altar
[21:23] go to the altar
[21:25] so i turned to my friend janie
[21:28] the preacher's daughter i was sitting by
[21:30] her and her mother the preacher's wife
[21:33] and i told jamie i said jenny i feel
[21:36] like i need to go to the doctor
[21:38] i never knew nothing about more than the
[21:41] auditor mom and daddy got saved in the
[21:43] house so and i wasn't even naked but
[21:46] anyway
[21:48] she said we'll go on it
[21:49] no no no no
[21:52] no i'm about to look her about myself
[21:54] and so her mother said come on we'll go
[21:56] with you
[21:57] so they got in they took me up to the
[21:59] altar okay we get to the altar
[22:02] now what
[22:05] really
[22:06] julia had never been before now
[22:09] so we got up there and we got down
[22:14] and down
[22:20] so
[22:21] now this is something we don't do but
[22:22] these are pentacles and they were they
[22:24] were the real people
[22:26] so i just followed their instructions
[22:29] his mother her mother here jamie here
[22:34] just say hallelujah
[22:36] so they started saying i never heard
[22:39] that word before
[22:40] that was greek to me i never heard the
[22:43] word hallelujah before in my life
[22:46] so they started saying hallelujah
[22:49] hallelujah
[22:51] okay
[22:52] i started saying it hallelujah
[22:56] hallelujah
[22:58] then something happened
[23:02] all of a sudden from out of nowhere i
[23:04] jumped up and screamed hallelujah and
[23:06] run around the pulpit
[23:12] she gave me the strongest look but
[23:14] i guess it was strange
[23:16] i didn't do that
[23:18] that was a supernatural experience
[23:22] god led me to go to that altar
[23:26] it was a force i didn't feel it all i
[23:28] knew was
[23:30] and i screamed
[23:31] and i run around and i it was a warm
[23:33] preacher
[23:49] i knew it was not a good move
[23:52] we were
[23:54] kind of isolated i'm a teenager
[23:57] i'm about 14 15 years old
[24:00] and you don't isolate a teenager
[24:03] and you don't take them more i went to
[24:05] the library two or three times a week i
[24:07] had no library to go to we didn't have a
[24:09] car we didn't have a phone we didn't
[24:10] have to we had nothing
[24:13] and
[24:14] we also didn't have church
[24:16] because the church bus didn't come out
[24:18] that far
[24:20] so here we were and you know
[24:23] you must go to church
[24:27] you will spiritually die you will wither
[24:29] away
[24:31] i saw my mama
[24:33] get in that condition not my daddy
[24:35] so much as my mama because daddy was
[24:37] gone at work
[24:39] a long time along during the day he
[24:42] wasn't home that much during the day
[24:44] he was at work and fellowshipping with
[24:46] his baptist friends but me and mama
[24:51] and it was just not it was just not good
[24:54] and i didn't understand my mama and my
[24:56] mama didn't understand now on up till
[24:58] then men momma had a very good
[25:00] relationship
[25:02] but once we moved to the country and got
[25:04] out of church
[25:06] and things were bad
[25:08] i didn't understand a moment she didn't
[25:09] understand me
[25:11] and i actually
[25:14] wanted to run away from home
[25:17] i didn't get the nerve up that's a good
[25:19] thing i didn't sometimes it's gonna be a
[25:21] little chicken
[25:24] run away from moments if somebody come
[25:27] to me come on let's run away from home
[25:28] we went
[25:30] i hated
[25:32] i literally hated my whole life
[25:35] and i become convinced my mama hated me
[25:39] now i know better now and
[25:41] later i knew better but you know
[25:44] teenagers
[25:45] it could be a problem i got very
[25:47] depressed
[25:49] very discouraged very bitter
[25:53] and then
[25:54] mama was out of work daddy had surgery
[25:57] and he was out of work pretty bad
[26:00] so when i was 16 and a half i went job
[26:02] hunting and i found a job in a factory
[26:07] i was away from home that was good so i
[26:10] enjoyed i enjoyed my job because it got
[26:13] me away from home and daddy got us a car
[26:15] and then uh daddy taught me how to drive
[26:18] a car
[26:19] and then mama went back to work and she
[26:21] got off from work at 10 o'clock at night
[26:24] so what i would do when i come home from
[26:27] work i would get in the car while it was
[26:29] still daylight
[26:30] and drive into town
[26:32] and me and my cousin would hang out
[26:34] shirley jean was my cousin
[26:37] and then hazel come along daddy's sister
[26:39] which i knew hazel we were friends as
[26:41] children
[26:43] and uh so we all started hanging out
[26:45] together until 12 o'clock at night and
[26:47] then i'd have to
[26:49] i'd have to go pick up mama from work
[26:51] and then mama go home and that was every
[26:53] day through the week because i wouldn't
[26:55] drive let them come to roads and dark by
[26:57] myself so
[26:59] anyway
[27:00] we just hang out and do that well during
[27:02] that time my future husband
[27:05] had been in north africa in the navy and
[27:07] he he come home he was getting ready to
[27:09] get out
[27:10] and so he started riding around with us
[27:13] and you all know the rest so
[27:15] anyway
[27:17] so in 1958
[27:20] we got married
[27:22] and uh
[27:23] two years later we had our first child
[27:26] lisa
[27:28] and then
[27:30] eddie come from a divorced family
[27:33] and uh
[27:34] it was not good because
[27:37] well it just wasn't good he come from a
[27:39] divorced family when he was very small
[27:42] and he always
[27:43] looked out for his mother
[27:46] he uh he went to work when he was 12
[27:49] years old
[27:50] and then when time he was 16 17 he was
[27:54] working two jobs to help help his mama
[27:57] and his baby sister hazel
[27:59] and then he went into the navy and he
[28:01] was sending her home money from the navy
[28:06] he watched out after his mother
[28:08] then in 1961
[28:11] at 50 years old she had a heart attack
[28:13] and she died
[28:16] and when she died
[28:19] he had always all his life you well you
[28:22] couldn't find a harder worker
[28:24] than my husband was from time he was a
[28:26] little boy
[28:27] he was still trying to work on up to the
[28:29] lord took him
[28:32] he lost his weight
[28:34] he started rifting
[28:37] he didn't leave home but he wasn't there
[28:39] for us
[28:41] and it made
[28:42] it made it hard
[28:44] and then we moved into this little
[28:46] furnished apartment
[28:48] and it was
[28:50] really not good
[28:53] because
[28:54] lisa was just i was pregnant with my
[28:57] second child and lisa was
[29:00] maybe 15 months old something like that
[29:04] and he would he would go and leave home
[29:07] and
[29:09] do his thing all day long
[29:11] every day and being hurt there by
[29:13] ourselves
[29:14] no tv
[29:16] no books no nothing
[29:19] i cried she cried i cried we both cried
[29:26] and it was very gloomy well
[29:29] i got very suicidal
[29:32] i was suicidal
[29:34] i had to get out i couldn't take it no
[29:36] more
[29:38] i just had to get out of the situation i
[29:40] didn't know no way out
[29:43] so then five months later
[29:46] eddie's brother-in-law died
[29:48] 31 years old
[29:50] and when he died his name was bob keener
[29:54] and when he died he left a wife with
[29:57] four young boys
[29:59] and it was suggested to us
[30:02] because we didn't have any certain
[30:03] dwelling place because eddie still was
[30:06] drifting loss
[30:08] we would stay with lena and the boys
[30:11] temporarily i was seven months pregnant
[30:15] we would just stay with her temporarily
[30:19] you know
[30:20] and then and then
[30:22] help her when she first lost her husband
[30:25] she worked also
[30:27] so we did that
[30:28] and um
[30:31] that was rough too because she was gone
[30:34] all day eddie was gone all day still
[30:36] drifting
[30:38] and here i am pregnant with a toddler
[30:41] and four little boys and
[30:43] it was just it was just not it was just
[30:46] bad for me
[30:48] and i'm sure it wasn't easy for lena
[30:52] so what happened then
[30:54] leona like she was the oldest sister of
[30:57] the family and she took the place of a
[31:00] mama and she talked to him and he
[31:02] listened to her
[31:04] eddie you've got to get to work you've
[31:06] got to get a place for your family to
[31:08] live
[31:10] and he did
[31:11] so when the baby was born when he was
[31:14] two weeks old
[31:16] we moved into an apartment
[31:18] with lena's health
[31:21] and she was a wonderful sister-in-law
[31:24] wonderful person
[31:27] somebody had to work somebody had to
[31:29] have money coming in
[31:31] i had felt trapped now i'm not trapped
[31:33] anymore i'll get a job
[31:36] i had a
[31:37] a five-week-old baby
[31:40] a 17-month old toddler and eddie come
[31:43] down with double pneumonia for two weeks
[31:45] he was been faced
[31:47] so me and my sister-in-law eddie's
[31:51] brother's wife we went job hunt we found
[31:53] a job
[31:54] but it was quite an ordeal just to get
[31:57] to it it was in several different towns
[31:59] we had to go through and we had to take
[32:00] the babies to my family and my sister
[32:03] took care of them
[32:04] we didn't get off 12 o'clock at night
[32:06] so that was hard
[32:08] and and we've done it for a while and
[32:11] then jane it would just become
[32:12] impossible for her to do it
[32:14] so we had to move closer in because when
[32:17] she left for work she could just pick me
[32:19] up so that's what we did we we rented an
[32:22] old house in newton the town i was
[32:25] raised in
[32:29] during the time
[32:30] when we were moving into the house spent
[32:33] two nights at my mom and daddy's house
[32:36] it was an old farmhouse and upstairs mom
[32:40] and dad slept upstairs
[32:42] and they had an extra bed up there so me
[32:46] and lisa and timmy his name was timmy
[32:48] timothy
[32:50] and um we slept and so now i'm working
[32:53] till 12 o'clock at night i'm exhausted
[32:55] i'm tired and sleepy a baby here a baby
[32:57] here
[32:59] well i couldn't go to sleep i'd roll
[33:01] over on
[33:02] so it was a restless night
[33:05] well the next night eddie stayed there
[33:07] and mama had a brand new auction couch
[33:10] just brand new
[33:11] her first one ever and
[33:14] um
[33:15] during the night so in order to get some
[33:17] sleep
[33:19] i left the little baby down in the chair
[33:21] because he was small enough he could fit
[33:23] in the chair and eddie could watch him
[33:26] and i'd have lisa and i could i might
[33:28] get a little sleep
[33:29] and i must have went sound asleep
[33:31] because in the night my daddy started
[33:33] hollering at me jing jing go see about
[33:35] that baby what's wrong with that baby i
[33:37] didn't even hear that baby i was so
[33:40] gone
[33:41] so i staggered down the steps and i
[33:43] guess for some reason mama followed me
[33:47] and when we got down there
[33:49] um
[33:51] eddie smoked
[33:53] and he
[33:54] dropped a cigarette
[33:56] and it caught on his couch on fire and
[33:58] he was laying in the fire
[34:00] now that baby timothy means guardian
[34:03] angels and from god
[34:04] save all of our lives that night wow me
[34:07] and mama liked to not got eddie up
[34:09] because he was so out we drug him off
[34:12] the couch and
[34:14] thrown him outside
[34:16] and
[34:17] well anyway we didn't spend another
[34:19] night at mom once i was here
[34:23] [Laughter]
[34:25] my daddy
[34:28] crazy house i'm getting out of here so
[34:31] okay but wind's moving in his other
[34:33] house
[34:35] so we were working we were like ships
[34:38] passing in the money
[34:40] because i worked till midnight we were
[34:43] too late
[34:45] we didn't see that
[34:47] where he had been drifting we had also
[34:49] drifted
[34:52] um
[34:54] i don't if if we hadn't got saved i
[34:56] doubt we'd stay together over time we'd
[34:59] probably been a typical divorce like a
[35:02] lot of them are
[35:03] thank god we got saved but anyway
[35:08] we moved into this old house
[35:10] and one night um
[35:13] on this side there are some rooms over
[35:16] here but on this side there was living
[35:18] room
[35:19] bedroom kitchen living room bedroom
[35:21] kitchen
[35:23] and so we went to go to bed that night
[35:25] tired and more out put the babies to bed
[35:28] and eddie turned over towards the
[35:30] kitchen
[35:32] i went to turn over towards him
[35:35] and i happened to look and there was
[35:38] the door from the living room to the
[35:40] bedroom
[35:42] there was a light on the door
[35:45] it was an old house
[35:48] the house was dark
[35:51] there was a strange light on the door
[35:54] now you don't heard me tell you how much
[35:57] of a scaredy cat i was
[35:59] but when you're tired and sleep you're
[36:01] probably more out you
[36:03] you just gotta go to sleep
[36:05] so i saw that light and i asked eddie i
[36:07] said what's that like he said i don't
[36:09] know and he tried to think i said no
[36:12] no
[36:13] we didn't know what it was it was
[36:14] unusual light
[36:16] he said it's a street light not in the
[36:18] street like three light lights a whole
[36:20] room and it wasn't doing that it was
[36:22] solid
[36:25] being so tired and sleepy i just turned
[36:27] over going back to sleep with him when i
[36:31] did i heard that light leave the door
[36:34] i was not a christian
[36:37] i described it like that and then i'll
[36:39] describe it like that now
[36:41] i don't
[36:43] don't make a lot of sense i don't know
[36:45] another way to describe it
[36:47] it was like an angel
[36:49] left that door and flew away
[36:52] right across
[36:53] the foot of our bed
[36:55] and slammed into the baby crib and shook
[36:57] the whole house
[37:00] i'm trying to turn and look at it i can
[37:02] hear it flying
[37:04] wow i can't move
[37:07] i can't speak
[37:08] i don't need to see what's going on
[37:11] scare the cat that i was i wanted to see
[37:13] it something was after me i wanted to
[37:15] see what it was
[37:19] after it
[37:20] sounded like he hit the crib shook the
[37:22] whole house
[37:24] i was able to move i was able to speak
[37:27] and the light was gone
[37:30] there was a present in the house
[37:34] not a good president a full woman
[37:37] it's hard to explain that presence
[37:40] but it was not a good presence
[37:44] they are two after that
[37:46] we both worked
[37:48] i worked on 12 o'clock i don't remember
[37:52] what time his hours were like i said we
[37:54] were drifting ships in the night
[38:00] but this particular night
[38:03] the factories everywhere was taking
[38:05] inventories they do that off and when
[38:07] they take inventory
[38:08] you don't work
[38:10] so i wasn't working
[38:12] he wasn't working because our factories
[38:14] were taking inventory
[38:17] so we sat on the couch that night and
[38:20] for the first time in a long time we
[38:23] were connected
[38:25] it felt good to be there together
[38:28] and every little bit whatever was
[38:30] watching on tv every little bit i'd go
[38:32] check on the babies make sure this house
[38:34] was cold
[38:36] old house
[38:37] make sure they're covered up not kick
[38:39] their covers off they were fine both of
[38:41] them were fine
[38:43] the tv went off back then about 11 11 30
[38:47] 12 o'clock i forget it didn't play all
[38:49] night like it does now we got ready to
[38:51] go to bed
[38:53] and uh went to bed uh
[38:55] checked on the babies and
[38:59] at least lisa
[38:59] would have been uh 20 months solid
[39:02] bleaches and something like that
[39:05] she was at the point of death
[39:07] that quick
[39:09] so we didn't have a car we didn't have a
[39:11] phone
[39:13] so eddie took off running to my sister's
[39:15] house and borrowed her car
[39:17] and he was back just
[39:19] it scared us
[39:20] it scared us
[39:23] she was right at the point of death
[39:25] within a matter of minutes
[39:27] he grabbed her up and he took her to the
[39:29] hospital
[39:31] and
[39:32] of course i couldn't go jimmy couldn't
[39:34] go

[41:17] my sister sent the baby back to me
[41:20] eddie's sister lina the oldest sister

[41:28] and let me and eddie go home and get get
[41:30] some couple hours sleep we we were sleep
[41:33] deprived tired or more out
[41:35] so here they come
[41:38] and it was an old hospital it was not
[41:40] like it is today
[41:42] doctors didn't stay there like they do
[41:44] today
[41:45] so um we got there and my my sister said
[41:49] word i need to have the baby checked
[41:51] because he was creepy too
[41:53] this is what it did we took him into the
[41:55] er
[41:56] and had him checked out to make sure
[41:58] he's okay
[42:00] because his sister's in the hospital and
[42:02] so
[42:03] they said it was fine
[42:05] and that if i still worried about him
[42:08] bring him to the office in the morning
[42:11] okay that's what we'll do so then the
[42:13] plan was lena had to go to work in
[42:15] another town at seven o'clock the next
[42:18] morning
[42:19] we had her car
[42:21] we had the plan was we would be back to
[42:24] the hospital in time for her to get in
[42:25] her car and go to her job she had four
[42:27] boys to support
[42:30] so we went home
[42:32] got him something to eat
[42:35] got got the baby ready for bed and he
[42:37] had just really learned how to smile
[42:39] real cute
[42:43] and he was sound asleep
[42:45] and i said i wish he'd wake up give me
[42:47] that smile and he did
[42:49] he woke up and looked at me and smiled
[42:51] and you know right back to sleep
[42:53] so then we put him in the bed and um
[42:56] eddie crawled in the bed the front of
[42:58] the bed our bed was against the wall and
[43:00] the baby's crib was gosh that baby crib
[43:02] was that close to us at the foot of the
[43:04] bed
[43:05] and so i went to get in the bed behind
[43:07] him and when i did a stop
[43:10] okay what's wrong
[43:13] i don't know
[43:14] i'm worried
[43:17] he said what you worried about i
[43:19] don't know i'm just just worried
[43:21] maybe i shouldn't have left lisa
[43:24] he said well if you haven't been phyllis
[43:26] you'd worry about timmy well that's true
[43:28] i couldn't beat both of them
[43:30] so i crawled up in the bed and as soon
[43:31] as my head hit that bed i was gone
[43:36] well the next morning
[43:38] we overslept
[43:41] eddie jumped straight up
[43:44] jimmy bumper slept gene timmy's dead
[43:48] and i went to the crib and he was
[43:51] about the time i was saying i'm worried
[43:54] the angel of the lord was taken
[43:56] that's what that lock was on the door
[44:00] that turned our lives around
[44:03] he was
[44:05] guardian angel sent from brother brown
[44:07] said he's a minor savior he saved us
[44:10] twice he saved us from a fire and he
[44:14] saved our soul from a burning
[44:16] fire
[44:18] well
[44:19] i was so uh
[44:23] distraught
[44:24] they they give me a pill that put me to
[44:26] sleep and i don't i can't take stuff
[44:28] like that even today but i didn't know
[44:32] so they put me to sleep because i to
[44:34] calm me down
[44:37] and uh when i woke up they tried to give
[44:39] me another one this is no hope you're
[44:41] not going to get a second one in on me
[44:44] i got those pictures
[44:45] my mama had a baby sister named doris my
[44:48] indoors
[44:50] this was the house we lived in they they
[44:52] brought the
[44:54] the deceased to your house back then
[44:57] and my endorse took those pictures or i
[44:59] wouldn't have them
[45:01] i wouldn't have them
[45:02] and the one where he was smiling i and
[45:05] lisa in the hospital i took them the
[45:07] week before i wouldn't have had any
[45:09] pictures i took them the week before
[45:12] so anyway then
[45:14] the baptist preacher preacher keller a
[45:16] wonderful man wonderful family
[45:20] he come in he held the funeral
[45:24] and when he come in i lost it
[45:27] i want to go to heaven
[45:31] let me tell you kids
[45:32] we have a transgressor's heart
[45:37] don't think it's not
[45:40] it's very hard
[45:42] so i told the lord i'd go to church
[45:45] why wasn't i in church
[45:48] i had confessed to be a christian as a
[45:50] little girl
[45:51] what was going on well
[45:54] anyway
[45:55] we started a church
[45:57] badminton east first street baptist
[45:59] church
[46:02] whenever service
[46:04] eddie worked at night so he couldn't go
[46:06] through the week but we we went every
[46:08] service
[46:10] loved church and and one got saved he
[46:13] got safety
[46:14] turned our whole lives around
[46:17] the morning god saved and the lord
[46:18] started dealing with me about things
[46:20] that puzzled me
[46:22] i was a typical american girl
[46:25] i was just turned 21 years old
[46:29] uh
[46:30] that's my picture with my daddy and the
[46:32] picture with my mama that was in
[46:34] december i turned 21
[46:37] in december
[46:40] so anyway he began dealing with me about
[46:43] wearing a pants
[46:46] i thought that's all because they wore
[46:48] pants
[46:49] he began dealing with me
[46:51] wearing makeup and i thought
[46:54] they weren't they got
[46:56] it puzzled me
[46:58] but i was still trying to do it so i
[47:00] okay i know what it is it's not my pants
[47:02] it's my shorts i got rid of all the
[47:04] shorts i still have my pants
[47:08] said that patient one time i said hey i
[47:10] don't wear pants no more the lord took
[47:12] them from me she said well you've got
[47:13] them on right now
[47:15] you know the lord knows how to cheat you
[47:18] might not want that was eddie's sister
[47:20] so
[47:21] and uh but anyway then um
[47:25] i only wore lipstick
[47:27] i don't want eye shadow okay that's what
[47:29] it is it says eye shadow i couldn't wear
[47:31] an eye shadow
[47:33] it still didn't leave me
[47:38] was a couple people in the church
[47:41] if i can express this right
[47:43] that i considered to be special
[47:47] i was never special
[47:49] but i sure wanted to be there was miss
[47:52] lighty she was the piano player she'd
[47:55] sit there and play and cry
[47:57] my heart would burst in first
[48:00] there was a young girl and her husband
[48:02] would get up behind the pulpit and sing
[48:05] and she would start crying and go clean
[48:08] down to the floor
[48:10] my heart would burst
[48:13] then i knew this girl from school and
[48:16] i seen her do that and i thought
[48:19] i don't get so bad there are special
[48:21] people in the world that seem like are
[48:24] higher than i just need more but what is
[48:27] the my oh god
[48:28] oh
[48:30] but i'm not special
[48:32] you got to be special
[48:35] about that time the lord was going
[48:36] through our family my sister jewell got
[48:38] saved at that time and she got saved in
[48:40] her kitchen you don't have to go to the
[48:42] altar i went to the altar
[48:44] because i wanted to be a christian and i
[48:48] thought you had to go to the altar
[48:50] to be a christian because every every
[48:52] service they had an altar call
[48:55] and so i
[48:57] i couldn't get the nerve up to go
[48:59] so finally i got the nerve up to go and
[49:01] i run to that altar and got down and
[49:03] some of the women come and prayed with
[49:05] me
[49:06] and
[49:07] i didn't pray
[49:10] i didn't pray because i didn't know what
[49:11] to pray i didn't know what to say i just
[49:14] let them pray
[49:15] and then when they stood up and stood me
[49:18] up
[49:21] i saw
[49:23] that's why caleb's
[49:26] when i saw caleb campbell give his life
[49:28] to the lord that brought back a lot of
[49:30] memories
[49:31] he saw
[49:32] he saw i did too i think i outright him
[49:37] but all them years of that deep ache
[49:40] they grieved
[49:42] that total
[49:45] despair
[49:47] in one second it was
[49:49] wow
[49:50] and in his place was a tender hallelujah
[49:53] delicate
[49:55] peaceful feeling i've never had in my
[49:58] life
[49:59] i really got saved because i really you
[50:02] know i know a lot of people
[50:05] they start out
[50:08] when you go
[50:10] we have a transgressors hard
[50:12] when i went i'm in business i wanted to
[50:15] be a christian period i've never never
[50:17] desired anything different i know some
[50:20] people have you know their struggles i
[50:22] never didn't have that struggle thanks
[50:24] to god but
[50:26] i come
[50:28] a lot of people have come a lot harder
[50:31] but no one has come in more depth of
[50:34] grief and sorrow and discouragement and
[50:36] suicidal than i did
[50:39] and god delivered me
[50:41] but i wanted more i didn't know there
[50:43] was more
[50:45] my sister margaret
[50:47] the oldest of our sisters bless her
[50:49] heart she's in glory
[50:53] she also gave her life to the lord at
[50:55] the same time in margaret jewel all
[50:57] around the same time
[50:59] and
[51:00] she felt like me she she wanted more but
[51:03] she didn't know she said mama i always
[51:06] said if i was going to be a christian i
[51:07] wanted to be in a special that's one
[51:09] word i could think special
[51:11] well her neighbor a little message
[51:13] church probably 40 people
[51:16] more or less moved into our team
[51:19] about a year or so before
[51:22] and
[51:24] her neighbor went to it
[51:26] and she invited margaret to go with her
[51:29] to church
[51:30] and margaret went
[51:32] she went to the altar again
[51:35] when she come back
[51:37] she glowed
[51:39] she absolutely blew
[51:42] she would come to her house and she said
[51:44] i know when i die i'm going to heaven
[51:46] well now i'm a christian now but i told
[51:48] eddie i said
[51:50] i don't know when i die i'm going to
[51:52] heaven i couldn't say that like she
[51:54] could
[51:56] so she invited me to go
[51:58] i finally was able to go with her
[52:00] unbeknownst to me
[52:03] my 15 year old sister connie had already
[52:05] went a couple times i didn't know that
[52:09] so that particular night i know the
[52:11] first time i walked into a message
[52:13] church now

[52:18] but they were out of pentecost so
[52:21] still a lot of things haven't been put
[52:22] in order you're talking 1962.
[52:26] and so
[52:28] uh anyway um
[52:31] trying to think where i was at so
[52:34] when i walked into that church
[52:39] you could have knocked me with a failure
[52:41] i was astounded
[52:43] everybody in that church was special
[52:46] they were all worshipping god
[52:48] oh
[52:49] oh god
[52:51] that's what i don't know that and so the
[52:54] preacher because that's kind of what he
[52:56] did within uh we were sitting up towards
[53:02] and the preacher come out there after
[53:04] preaching and laid hands on connie

[1:02:52] a great blessing to me amen if you
[1:02:54] enjoyed it let sister gene see your hand

[1:03:19] predestination amen
[1:03:22] amen praise the lord i know how that
[1:03:24] feels must get annoyed at trying to stop
[1:03:31] [Applause]
[1:03:33] it's all good
[1:03:35] amen so uh she's the clean mother of the
[1:03:38] church so we're happy
[1:03:40] happy to have this gene with us and it's
[1:03:42] special for me let's all stand back to
[1:03:44] our feet
[1:03:45] you know i
[1:03:47] i it's amazing when you think about how
[1:03:51] the hand of god
[1:03:53] leads lives and generations hope i mean
[1:03:56] now here we are today
[1:03:58] and
[1:03:59] you know probably a
[1:04:02] a good quarter of this church well
[1:04:04] there's
[1:04:05] i don't know it's probably not that many
[1:04:06] but at least there's uh 15 or so of us i
[1:04:10] think
[1:04:10] um
[1:04:12] something like that i think when we get
[1:04:14] together we're like 15 strong or
[1:04:16] something like that something that that
[1:04:17] number
[1:04:18] and that's all because of the stories
[1:04:22] that we have
[1:04:23] just now god dealing with a little girl
[1:04:26] who
[1:04:27] even though she didn't go to church i
[1:04:28] mean that should speak about the gene of
[1:04:30] god
[1:04:31] that begins to cry out even from a child
[1:04:33] because here she is going up a dirt road
[1:04:35] 10 year old girl praying to wedding
[1:04:37] singing contest and she wanted
[1:04:39] hey man sister jane actually used to
[1:04:41] sing on the radio
[1:04:43] which is a little girl she sunk so good
[1:04:45] they had her singing she was part of the
[1:04:47] the church service they would have live
[1:04:49] broadcast she'd go there and help the
[1:04:50] preacher by singing amen so
[1:04:53] we're
[1:04:54] loving hearing that amen and i i'm i'm
[1:04:57] looking forward to the day
[1:04:59] when all of you all
[1:05:01] are able to hear a young 20 year old
[1:05:05] sister gene again
[1:05:07] amen and so she still sings to me
[1:05:10] so beautiful but i remember how she
[1:05:13] sounded also as a young woman
[1:05:15] and closest sound of running water you
[1:05:17] ever want to hear just a beautiful
[1:05:19] soprano voice and uh sung at brother
[1:05:21] brown's tabernacle for years
[1:05:24] with his daughter rebecca and sister

[1:08:05] teenager
[1:08:06] no that was the brick church no it was
[1:08:09] there on main street it was an old cafe
[1:08:12] okay and i don't have a picture of it
[1:08:14] okay so i never went to the church no

[1:08:21] and as a little tiny baby okay praise
[1:08:24] the lord so y'all heard what y'all heard
[1:08:27] was why they they called me the holy
[1:08:29] ghost baby because
[1:08:31] i was like john the baptist
[1:08:35] amen praise the lord i was the reason i
[1:08:36] was asking is because it was in a it was
[1:08:39] another church that when we came back to
[1:08:42] north carolina from living in
[1:08:44] jeffersonville
[1:08:46] for seven years and it was in that
[1:08:48] little church
[1:08:49] where i was healed of this terrible back
[1:08:53] injury i'd actually broke the base of my
[1:08:55] spine and couldn't hardly stand up
[1:08:57] straight or walk straight and i was
[1:08:58] probably 14 maybe some 15
[1:09:02] 14.
[1:09:04] yeah i looked right right right under my
[1:09:06] legs and uh i ended up cracking the
[1:09:09] vertebrae in my spine and so
[1:09:11] uh i was went up for prayer and i had
[1:09:14] the same exact experience preachers
[1:09:17] gathered in front of me
[1:09:18] and someone stepped up behind me and put
[1:09:20] a hand on the small of my back
[1:09:23] and after service and i was healed
[1:09:25] instantly immediately right then and
[1:09:27] there and i asked my mom
[1:09:28] later i said hey who walked up behind me
[1:09:32] i said no i mean coming up to pray for
[1:09:34] me who came up and stood by and put
[1:09:35] their hand on my back she said there was
[1:09:37] no one
[1:09:38] a hand in my back and that was amen
