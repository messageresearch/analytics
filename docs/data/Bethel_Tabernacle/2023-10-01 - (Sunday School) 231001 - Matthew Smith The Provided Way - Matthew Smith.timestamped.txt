[0:01] oh gracious father Lord we want to come
[0:03] before you this morning Father and
[0:06] invite you into this little Sunday
[0:08] school Lord that I can maybe bring
[0:11] something that not of of anything that I
[0:13] would have come up with or I would have
[0:15] thought of but Lord that you would
[0:17] Inspire my heart and my mind and that I
[0:19] could say something that at the behest
[0:22] of your spirit Lord that would help the
[0:25] people to overcome in this evil day Lord
[0:28] we ask these things in your home holy
[0:30] and precious name of the Lord Jesus
[0:31] Christ
[0:33] amen let's um turn if you would
[0:37] to
[0:39] um uh we're going to go to St John
[0:42] chapter
[0:44] 8 and
[0:54] 31 says um St John 8:31 it says and then
[0:59] Jesus Jesus said to those
[1:01] Jews which believed on
[1:05] him uh if you continue in my word then
[1:07] you are my disciples indeed and you
[1:09] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[1:11] make you free they answered him we are
[1:13] Abraham's seed and were never in bondage
[1:17] to any man how sayest thou ye shall ye
[1:20] shall be made
[1:22] free and Jesus answered them verily
[1:24] verily I say unto you whomsoever
[1:25] committeth sin is a servant of sin and
[1:28] the servant abideth not in the house
[1:29] house forever but the son abideth
[1:32] forever I want to skip down to uh verse
[1:36] 47 and it says uh he that is of God
[1:40] heareth God's word ye therefore hear
[1:43] them not because you're not of
[1:45] God um I also want to well I'll I'll
[1:49] pick up this next scripture in a minute
[1:51] um you can be seated um so there's a a
[1:57] previous Sunday schools that I've um
[2:00] taken there I've talked about you know
[2:02] the truth and how that the the that the
[2:05] uh you know I think it was the last
[2:07] Sunday school that I did um there was a
[2:11] I talked about how the truth of uh that
[2:14] the truth is is there's you can
[2:16] determine the truth by by repetition and
[2:19] and that which uh replicates itself
[2:22] there's truth in that right like you
[2:23] know you have a true seed if it's if
[2:25] it's a proper seed and not a hybrid seed
[2:27] then it's going to reproduce itself
[2:30] um you know we talked about um how you
[2:33] know in the scientific Community the
[2:35] replication of results is how they
[2:36] determine the truth and that that that
[2:38] it it's so striking that the at the end
[2:41] time that the that the call of the end
[2:43] time messenger would be to call people's
[2:44] hearts back to the original to show the
[2:48] power of God to replicate what was
[2:50] originally there to begin
[2:52] with and that there would be that there
[2:54] would be a a truth there you know um you
[2:58] know brother Jason has been using this
[2:59] you know saying how there's just it's
[3:02] it's an original not necessarily
[3:03] old-fashioned right it's the Original
[3:05] Seed not necessarily oldfashioned seed
[3:07] I've always thought it was interesting
[3:08] that you know people say well they don't
[3:09] make them like they used to well it's
[3:11] because things that are very old are
[3:13] built very well they stick around for a
[3:16] long time and um you know so people can
[3:18] call it oldfashioned but at the end of
[3:20] the day it's stuck around because
[3:23] there's something truth there's
[3:24] something true about it right there's
[3:27] something something solid there that
[3:29] doesn't just going to isn't just going
[3:30] to go away uh with with any kind of
[3:34] pressure um and I also talked about how
[3:37] that you know in the in the past you
[3:40] know people in the modern day are so
[3:43] kind of obsessed at least especially in
[3:44] the United States obsessed with freedom
[3:46] and liberty and well this these are my
[3:48] rights and you know don't really have
[3:50] any any desire to attach responsibility
[3:54] to that and to live right but to have
[3:56] rights you know they're you know have a
[3:59] lot of Rights but live very wrong and
[4:03] um you know so it's this and so you know
[4:07] I I recently heard of a politician I
[4:10] don't you know nothing particularly
[4:11] against the guy I'm sure he's a great
[4:13] guy as much as a politician can be um
[4:16] but he uh he said that you know he's
[4:20] we're looking for America's 1776 moment
[4:23] right this is we're going to return back
[4:25] to the original founding fathers and
[4:27] what they believed and I'm like well
[4:29] that's great sentiment and all I wish
[4:31] people would but at the end of the day
[4:34] to return back to that is ultimately
[4:37] going to get a repetition of what they
[4:40] got right we are here now because
[4:42] ultimately we're the product of what
[4:44] they did back then um you so you're not
[4:47] going to go anywhere you're just going
[4:49] to be having the same problem given
[4:50] enough time you know and if every seed
[4:54] brings forth of when every seed does
[4:55] bring forth of its own kind it's
[4:57] oftentimes bringing forth more than what
[5:00] went into the ground right so if that
[5:04] seed went into the ground at the
[5:06] founding of America and now we're seeing
[5:08] the fruit of it now if we return back to
[5:10] the seed when the next cycle round will
[5:13] be so much worse than it is now it's not
[5:15] going to get any better right so there's
[5:17] no there's no real there's no real um
[5:20] foundation in in returning to you know
[5:22] some sort of political Revival and so
[5:25] ultimately the the only real truth the
[5:27] only real you know move
[5:31] forward is to move towards sort of what
[5:35] what you know we as as in time Believers
[5:38] would see as a return to our founding
[5:41] fathers right to return to something
[5:43] that's a little bit more eternal and
[5:45] something that's not going to change and
[5:48] is ultimately going to return itself
[5:50] back to its original on of its own
[5:53] accord and and that it's going to be
[5:55] something that isn't is is more uh is
[5:58] greater than just a nation or greater
[6:00] than just a a a political system or
[6:02] something like
[6:05] that
[6:07] um and you know there was uh you know
[6:11] people you know have this idea of the
[6:13] the Declaration of Independence right
[6:15] that there would be you know that that
[6:17] we hold these truth to be self-evident
[6:19] that all men are created equal and that
[6:20] we have inali inalienable rights well
[6:24] there's a
[6:26] uh I I read this quote
[6:30] this from the church age book where
[6:32] brother brandom said um says what the
[6:35] church had at Pentecost is her
[6:37] inalienable right originally she had the
[6:40] pure word of God she had the power of
[6:42] the spirit manifested in diverse signs
[6:44] and wonders and Gifts of the Holy
[6:47] Ghost and then um skipping down a little
[6:50] it says that original church was not
[6:52] organized by men it was led by the Holy
[6:54] Ghost it wasn't very big it was hated
[6:56] and despised it was oppressed it was
[6:58] persecuted under death but it was true
[7:00] to God it stayed with the original word
[7:02] pattern and so you know they they have
[7:06] these inali you know brother brand
[7:08] calling that the power of God is the
[7:10] church's inalienable
[7:12] right and it so struck me um that the
[7:15] that the term
[7:17] inalienable is uh um I think this is
[7:21] from Websters I can't remember if I
[7:22] pulled this from Websters or Oxford but
[7:24] either way it works it says incapable of
[7:26] being alienated surrendered or
[7:29] transferred so when you have an
[7:31] inalienable right to something it's not
[7:34] something that you yourself can even
[7:36] give up nobody gave it to you God gave
[7:38] it to you and it's really not yours to
[7:41] give away right so when you have the so
[7:45] when the church has the
[7:47] power um what the church had at
[7:50] Pentecost is her inalienable right right
[7:53] which is she had the pure word of God
[7:55] she had the power of the spirit
[7:56] manifested in diverse signs and Gifts of
[7:59] the Holy Holy Ghost so here here She has
[8:01] the the holy ghost manifested in her
[8:03] midst that's not something that she
[8:04] herself can really give up as long as
[8:07] she's under that pure word of God right
[8:09] it's just going to be there it's it's
[8:11] not going to be something that um you
[8:14] know once that Holy Ghost takes takes
[8:16] root it's not coming
[8:18] out
[8:23] um so he says
[8:26] um I want to I want to come down to this
[8:30] this other quote here where he talks
[8:31] about uh this is from um sir we would
[8:35] see
[8:37] Jesus um well let me let let me let me
[8:40] lay a little more Foundation before I
[8:42] get into that so there's a there's a uh
[8:44] you know we have this this understanding
[8:46] that here we are in the end time with a
[8:47] restoration of back to what the original
[8:49] church had that we should be seeing
[8:52] signs and wonders and and miracles we
[8:54] should be seeing the the work of the
[8:56] spirit moving in our midst we should be
[8:58] seeing we should be be able to move
[8:59] forward on these things and not be not
[9:03] be scared to you know lay claims to the
[9:07] to the uh the the the promises and the
[9:12] word of
[9:13] God um and so we we we we love that we
[9:19] are we are we rejoice in
[9:22] that but that kind of comes with the
[9:26] caveat of that if you
[9:30] want a a real Church lifestyle or the
[9:34] the the church power and the the the
[9:36] manifestation and the move of the spirit
[9:38] like the first church you have to have
[9:39] the first church lifestyle which isn't
[9:42] really what people want to do there's a
[9:46] famous quote um of Thomas aquinus as
[9:49] he's standing at the gates to the
[9:51] Vatican as there are wagon loads of
[9:55] treasure rolling into the Vatican from
[9:57] all over the world and the pope turns to
[10:00] Thomas aquinus and says you know gone
[10:02] are the days where the church can say
[10:04] Silver and Gold Have I None andinus
[10:07] turns to and says correct and gone to
[10:09] are the days where the church can say
[10:10] rise up and
[10:12] walk right this is this is you know you
[10:17] can you can
[10:19] have you know the only there's only one
[10:22] way to really gain that Supernatural
[10:24] power and that's to fall in line with
[10:27] the word of God Amen you know in in the
[10:30] in the order that has been laid out um I
[10:33] want to this is where I want to turn to
[10:34] Ephesians 6
[10:38] um me
[10:41] get Ephesians you don't have to turn I'm
[10:44] I'm just going to read it um so this is
[10:46] Ephesians 610 it says finally my
[10:48] brethren be strong in the Lord and in
[10:50] the power of His might put on the whole
[10:53] armor of God that you may be able to
[10:54] stand against the Ws of the devil for we
[10:57] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[10:58] against against principalities against
[11:00] Powers against the rulers of Darkness of
[11:02] this world against spiritual wickedness
[11:03] in high places wherefore take unto you
[11:06] the whole armor of God that you may be
[11:08] able to withstand in the evil day having
[11:11] done all to
[11:13] stand um and and then he goes into the
[11:16] whole armor of God there well you know
[11:18] there's a there's a requirement there
[11:20] here he is you know if you want to
[11:21] withstand if you want to have the power
[11:23] of God um if you want to be strong in
[11:26] the Lord and in the power of His might
[11:29] well there's a process and that process
[11:31] is that you have to equip yourself you
[11:33] have to you have to live your life in a
[11:35] certain kind of way you have to you have
[11:37] to you know as a soldier would you have
[11:40] to prepare your
[11:42] lifestyle to be in accordance with that
[11:45] right you know if we're you know we got
[11:47] the air base out here the Marine Corp
[11:49] air station
[11:51] if I walk up in there in my bright
[11:54] orange electrician t-shirt and my dirty
[11:56] jeans and walk up in there and like hey
[11:59] let me let me jump behind the wheel one
[12:00] of your fighter
[12:03] planes that's not going to go right
[12:05] they're going to be like well no you're
[12:09] not a pilot and you're probably not a
[12:11] marine so what are you doing here and
[12:14] you know and so there's there's a whole
[12:16] process that you've got to go through
[12:17] before you ever get behind the wheel of
[12:21] a fighter plane right there's going to
[12:23] and it's and it's not like I mean you
[12:25] got to go through you got to go through
[12:27] boot camp and it's not you know and when
[12:29] with boot camp they're really picky
[12:30] about how this process goes right you
[12:33] know it's like well I want to be a
[12:34] marine so I'm just going to show up at
[12:35] Paris Island one day I'm like hey I want
[12:37] to be a marine now no it's not how that
[12:40] works you know you got a whole you got a
[12:42] whole process to go through you got to
[12:43] go through testing to make sure they
[12:44] even want you and then and then even
[12:47] after all that they don't it's not like
[12:49] again you don't just show up there you
[12:51] go to a place that's not Paris Island
[12:54] and then you get on a bus with everybody
[12:55] else and then they drive the bus onto
[12:57] Paris Island you might be from buurt but
[12:59] you got to go to the bus and then go
[13:02] onto Paris Island because that's the
[13:04] provided way that the Marine Corps has
[13:05] given you as part of the process and
[13:09] they you know those di they've got it
[13:10] down to an art when those guys step off
[13:12] the bus you know you it's they they're
[13:15] they're very particular about everything
[13:17] that happens from that moment forward
[13:19] right you know you there's everything is
[13:21] going to be exact you know the first
[13:23] thing that comes off you standing on the
[13:25] yellow Footprints right you got to know
[13:27] how to stand up straight and how to how
[13:29] to stand and how to talk how to speak to
[13:31] the to the DI and how to behave yourself
[13:34] how to how to walk how to talk you know
[13:36] everything that you do the the clothes
[13:38] that you wear become Marine Corps
[13:40] clothes the the the food that you eat is
[13:42] Marine Corps food the you know the
[13:45] haircut that you have is a Marine Corps
[13:46] haircut you know everything's Marine
[13:49] Corp because they're building you into
[13:51] something very particular that isn't
[13:53] just any old thing right because before
[13:56] they give you the power of the Marine
[13:58] Corps
[13:59] they're going to make sure that you have
[14:01] a Marine Corps lifestyle that you're
[14:03] following Marine Corps orders and you're
[14:05] living your life in accordance with
[14:07] that so why do we think that this is
[14:10] going to be somehow be any different
[14:12] when it comes to the power of God when
[14:14] you're in the Lord's army there's going
[14:16] to be you you better learn how to walk
[14:18] and talk and and speak like Christ you
[14:23] know you got to you got to the the the
[14:25] the spiritual food that you're feeding
[14:27] on it better be
[14:29] Christ's food you know there there's
[14:31] everything that you do has to be in
[14:33] accordance with that
[14:35] otherwise how can God trust you with
[14:37] this you know it's it's here's a quote
[14:39] from
[14:41] um uh if I can find
[14:47] it you know it says um this is this is
[14:51] from uh the exposition of seven Church
[14:53] ages or from Ephesian Church
[14:57] age um
[15:00] and he says this is one line I thought
[15:02] this is there's just so much power in
[15:03] this one line it says Holiness wasn't a
[15:05] phrase with them or a figure of speech
[15:07] it was a way of life amen right that
[15:10] this was their lifestyle they had a if
[15:12] they wanted holy the power of the Holy
[15:14] Spirit they had to have a holy
[15:17] lifestyle and this this is from
[15:20] um uh you must be born again he says uh
[15:24] someone not long ago I believe I quoted
[15:26] here before uh it says U when the world
[15:29] uh it says why in the world don't you
[15:30] leave them women and men alone to me
[15:33] said why there uh the people believe you
[15:35] to be a prophet he said how can I teach
[15:38] them
[15:39] algebra um he's speaking about the
[15:42] person's asking him why don't you teach
[15:44] people how to you know see visions and
[15:45] do Miracles and all these things he says
[15:47] how can I teach them algebra when they
[15:48] don't know their ABCs see how can you
[15:50] take a child of kindergarten and give
[15:51] him a college education today teach him
[15:54] square root measure how can you do it
[15:56] when he don't know what ABC means you
[15:58] know what ABC means always believe
[16:00] Christ that's
[16:01] right going down a little further he
[16:03] says if you can't believe Earthly things
[16:05] that I tell you how can you believe
[16:06] Heavenly things how are you going to
[16:08] believe spiritual things that enter into
[16:10] the spirit and knowing and seeing
[16:11] visions and things like that to set a
[16:13] school in order like that when they
[16:15] don't even believe Earthly things can't
[16:18] even believe to wear clothes right can't
[16:21] even believe to quit their smoking and
[16:23] quit their lying lay their temper aside
[16:25] and all them things do all these things
[16:28] or quit lusting how can you teach people
[16:30] to enter into the spirit when they got
[16:32] all those things still hanging on them
[16:34] oh my you know so here we see this is
[16:38] there's a process there's a provided way
[16:42] that the lord has laid
[16:44] out
[16:46] that you know there's no other path to
[16:49] to you know Deliverance outside of that
[16:52] right you know if if you know people
[16:54] have these things that are that are um
[16:57] you know you you want to the Devil Comes
[16:59] against us so many times and so many
[17:01] times we want to stand up and and hold
[17:04] the territory that we believe that the
[17:06] Lord has given us amen but because you
[17:09] know it wasn't necessarily the devil
[17:11] that did this this was you know your own
[17:14] it was you not feeding on the word on a
[17:17] regular basis it was you not you know
[17:19] how are you supposed to stand against
[17:20] the devil when he comes against you with
[17:21] some Temptation when you haven't picked
[17:23] up a Bible and who knows when right how
[17:25] can you how are you gon to have the
[17:27] strength
[17:29] to overcome anything if you haven't
[17:32] developed any kind of overcoming power
[17:34] through a lifestyle that is conducive to
[17:36] that
[17:38] sure
[17:39] but if we do conform to
[17:43] that then we can have an advocate with
[17:45] the father then we can say then we have
[17:47] authority right I heard a a a guy I work
[17:51] with he was in the Army and he was an MP
[17:55] right out of basic training and he was
[17:57] stationed in Germany and we came up
[18:00] because they were talking about um some
[18:02] of the guys are going to some like
[18:03] October Fest thing and he was talking
[18:04] about how he was a MP during October
[18:06] Fest in Germany and around the base they
[18:09] would get the MPS to help with the local
[18:11] policing because you had all the
[18:12] American army guys and who getting rowdy
[18:15] and so the local police would get the
[18:17] the MPS at the base to help them do the
[18:18] do the law enforcement so at the end of
[18:20] the day they're going in there shutting
[18:22] everything down and kicking everybody
[18:23] out and so he's like it was my job to
[18:25] jump up on the tables and walk down the
[18:27] tables yelling at people get out and
[18:28] kicking their drinks
[18:30] over and you know you got everybody from
[18:34] this you know major American facility
[18:36] and you know he's you got guys of all
[18:38] kinds of rank he's like I'm a specialist
[18:40] I'm fresh out of basic training and I'm
[18:42] telling officers and sergeant majors to
[18:44] get out and you know and and putting
[18:46] cuffs on them and they're screaming at
[18:48] you going ah I'm this that and the other
[18:50] years you can't I'm I'm I'm Colonel so
[18:53] and so and don't you know who I am and
[18:54] he's like well but in that moment you
[18:57] got to recognize their rank does not
[18:59] supersede your Authority is because I
[19:02] might be some nobody I'm just fresh out
[19:04] of basic training but I've got a two-
[19:06] Star General behind me who said no
[19:09] you're going to shut this thing down
[19:10] because that's what the law says to do
[19:12] we're gonna like you have so much more
[19:14] enforcement power they can say whatever
[19:17] they
[19:18] want but at the end of the day you have
[19:20] the authority here amen because you're
[19:22] not operating on your own authority that
[19:24] fresh basic training guy he's got no
[19:26] Authority he's got nothing
[19:29] but he he's acting on somebody else's
[19:31] Authority and and that's what we got to
[19:33] recognize when we are falling into the
[19:36] order of God's word and we're wearing
[19:38] the uniform right we're wearing the
[19:40] uniform we've T we put on the word as
[19:43] our uniform and we're stepping out
[19:46] behind that and we're living a life in
[19:47] accordance with that well now you have
[19:50] authority that supersedes your own
[19:52] authority right now you have authority
[19:54] that isn't just your Authority your
[19:56] Authority isn't going to go very far
[19:59] right you know what's the what's that um
[20:02] in the you know why does why are we
[20:05] commanded to pray in the name of the
[20:07] Lord Jesus Christ because you're not
[20:09] doing it in your own name you're doing
[20:11] it somebody else's name right you know
[20:14] you it's you know it's the it's it's
[20:17] Christ's name on the check you know if
[20:21] that's that's what we got to understand
[20:22] it's not us doing it it's some it's a
[20:25] it's a higher power that has that is
[20:27] backing you up
[20:28] up and so there's
[20:32] a just in the last couple minutes that
[20:35] we have
[20:39] here you know and so we can step forward
[20:43] knowing that with a security knowing
[20:46] that that we have a uh that we have um
[20:51] enforcement power here this is from
[20:54] um the rest restoration of the Bride
[20:57] tree
[21:00] this is I I this I read this quote some
[21:03] time ago and it really struck me um just
[21:05] want to read it again it
[21:07] says he says to restore means to return
[21:10] to the former owner to to bring back to
[21:14] the former estate of condition and we
[21:17] can enforce a claim to be restored now
[21:20] that's what the Webster says the the
[21:22] word restore means to bring back to the
[21:24] former owner or to bring back to a
[21:26] former state of condition um and if a
[21:31] claim is made on something to make that
[21:33] restoration you can enforce it to make
[21:35] it come back to its original place right
[21:38] if you have and you know the analogy
[21:41] that's oftentimes used is the pawn shop
[21:43] right there's something in the pawn shop
[21:44] you go in you pay the money you get it
[21:46] back right it's restored back to
[21:48] you um it says uh to restore means to
[21:51] bring back or to restore a claim can be
[21:54] enforced now to bring anything back to
[21:56] its rightful owner where it belongs
[21:58] belongs um therefore some way it went
[22:02] away from its rightful owner and can
[22:04] wander around anywhere but to restore it
[22:07] is to bring it uh bring it back to uh
[22:11] who really owns it or to bring it back
[22:14] to its natural estate where it was at
[22:16] the first time bring it back to its
[22:19] natural
[22:21] condition and in order to do this we
[22:23] have a right to enforce if there is a
[22:26] law to enforce this rightful condition
[22:28] of restoration to restore right so if
[22:33] say for instance totally
[22:36] random uh example somebody steals an air
[22:40] conditioning unit and you know cuts the
[22:44] copper lines with a bolt cutter and
[22:45] takes it off to a pawn shop and you
[22:47] happen to know that that's your air
[22:49] conditioner sitting in that pawn Shop's
[22:51] yard and you have a police report saying
[22:54] that somebody stole your air
[22:55] conditioning unit you can walk into the
[22:57] p shop with the law enforcement and say
[23:00] Hey you bought stolen goods that doesn't
[23:02] belong to you I get it back right they
[23:06] have to restore your stolen property cuz
[23:09] it wasn't they bought it from someone
[23:10] but it wasn't that person's thing in the
[23:12] first place it's their responsibility to
[23:14] ensure that person obtained it legally
[23:17] before they buy it so you know so many
[23:21] times you know we have things
[23:24] that are stolen from us you know at the
[23:27] found of the world we have so much there
[23:30] was there was so there was a particular
[23:32] way of life of eternal life of Eternal
[23:35] Liberty of Eternal salvation of not of
[23:38] of freedom from the devil and from sin
[23:41] that was our original possession it
[23:44] belongs to us from day one amen from in
[23:48] the
[23:49] beginning and for the devil to come in
[23:52] and steal that from us means that we
[23:55] have a right to all those things you
[23:57] know we have have a right to not be sick
[24:00] we have a right to not be plagued in our
[24:03] minds and in our hearts with uh you know
[24:06] anything contrary to the word of God
[24:08] right you know the Lord commands us to
[24:09] be joyful the Lord commands us to be
[24:11] happy the Lord does not command us to be
[24:13] be
[24:14] depressed you know that is the work of
[24:16] Satan and so we are not subject to that
[24:18] but the only way that we can enforce
[24:21] that is if we come in the line of order
[24:23] of the word with the authority of the
[24:25] word to back it up because if you just
[24:26] walk into the pawn shop and say hey give
[24:28] me my stuff back he's going to say
[24:30] where's your police report right where's
[24:33] your law enforcement to back you up
[24:35] because I'm not just going to give up
[24:37] you know this property until you can
[24:38] show that there's some Authority there
[24:41] right so many times people don't live a
[24:44] Holiness lifestyle people don't live a
[24:46] holy way and then they want to go
[24:49] confront the devil and then the devil
[24:50] says you know I know Jesus and I know
[24:54] Paul and I know William Brandon but who
[24:56] are you exactly right you don't have any
[24:59] Authority here because you're not
[25:01] there's no you're not F living a
[25:04] lifestyle that the authority is going to
[25:06] associate itself with
[25:10] amen and uh we are out of time so we're
[25:15] gonna we're GNA stand and we'll have a
[25:17] word of prayer and we'll turn you over
[25:19] to the worship
[25:22] leader oh gracious father Lord we thank
[25:25] you for this opportunity to
[25:29] think on your word Lord and think on
[25:30] these good things father we ask that you
[25:33] would just maybe anoint these things to
[25:36] our hearts that we could have them in
[25:37] our heads and and hear them and think
[25:39] that they're you know nice things to
[25:41] think on but Lord if you don't really
[25:43] make it a revelation to us if you don't
[25:45] drop it down to our hearts then
[25:47] ultimately was a it would be for nothing
[25:50] so Lord I ask that you would you would
[25:52] give us the revelation of of these
[25:54] promises that you have let us take hold
[25:56] of it father
[25:58] let us let us take hold of it Lord that
[26:00] we could really put our our weight
[26:02] behind it and and and and not be scared
[26:05] to face the devil on on his own ground
[26:08] Lord we ask these things in your holy
[26:10] and precious name of the Lord Jesus
[26:11] Christ
[26:12] amen
