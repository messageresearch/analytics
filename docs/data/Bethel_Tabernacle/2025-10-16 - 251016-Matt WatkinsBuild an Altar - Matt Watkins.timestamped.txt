[2:10] Father, Lord, we come before you this
[2:12] morning, Lord of people ready for
[2:15] worship, ready to have your spirit move

[2:35] be open to the word, that we would hear

[12:33] [Applause]
[12:40] [Music]
[13:03] So I have two questions.
[13:12] passed away. She like a sudden thing.
[13:15] She was only like 50 years old. So, I
[13:18] want to remember him and his family and
[13:21] um brother Gary Hall is in the
[13:23] Philippines. He's having stomach
[13:24] troubles. I don't know um the ins and
[13:27] outs of it. We want to pray for that.
[13:29] Also, if you have a request upon your
[13:31] heart this morning, I know that Sunday
[13:33] school I got I got both hands up. I
[13:36] mean, you know, you don't want to be a
[13:38] breeding ground for the wrong thoughts
[13:40] and then they produce fruit that you're
[13:43] ashamed of. Amen. Let's pray.
[13:47] Father, we love you this morning. It's
[13:49] just so good to be in the house of the
[13:51] Lord. And Lord, we didn't come for one
[13:54] another. Though we do appreciate one
[13:56] another, but we all came to see you,
[13:58] Father. And that part that you have in
[14:01] each one of us, Father, may it come
[14:03] together as a pillar of fire and worship
[14:06] of spirit and truth unto you. For you
[14:08] are worthy of all worship, glory, and
[14:10] praise. Father, pray that you would just
[14:12] bless those that are streaming, those
[14:14] that couldn't be here. Father, we want
[14:15] to remember these requests,
[14:23] spouses, lost loved ones, and we can
[14:26] remember, Father, the
[14:29] the period of sorrow and grief. And
[14:34] Father, that just overwhelms.
[14:37] We pray for this family. We pray for
[14:39] Gary Freeman. Father,
[14:42] I pray that you would comfort his heart
[14:45] most of all that you'd reveal yourself
[14:47] to him in a special way. Give him
[14:49] strength and comfort in this time. Lord,
[14:52] for Gary Hall having stomach troubles.
[14:54] Father, none of us likes to feel sick.
[14:58] None of us likes to feel under the
[14:59] weather regardless of what it is. We
[15:02] pray for him this morning, Father, that
[15:05] you may receive all the glory and honor.
[15:07] Touch his body, Father.
[15:10] Look upon our hearts this morning, Lord.
[15:13] Those that are not feeling well, those
[15:15] that are sick, battling different
[15:16] things. Father,
[15:18] there is nothing that can stand before
[15:20] you, Lord. Nothing that can stand before
[15:23] your purpose.
[15:25] We love you this morning. We praise you.
[15:27] We just pray that you would
[15:29] be pleased with our worship. Help us,
[15:32] Father, clean our hearts out that we may
[15:34] leave here better than when we came in.
[15:36] Lord, as we collect the tithes and
[15:39] offerings, I pray that you would bless
[15:40] the cheerful giver. Father,
[15:43] Lord, I thank you for your
[15:45] your consistent care for your children.
[15:49] We need you each and every day. In Jesus
[15:51] name we pray. Amen.

[31:18] 18. Amen. We'll go straight to the word
[31:21] this morning. Sorry for the delay there.
[31:23] I was trying to get something just ready
[31:25] there just for this morning. Wanted to
[31:28] make sure I had that done before we came
[31:30] out. So you excuse me, Brother Matthew,
[31:32] for holding you there. But um you love
[31:35] the Lord Jesus.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So good to be back in the house of
[31:40] the Lord and uh thankful that God has um
[31:43] kept us through another year of camp and
[31:46] uh we had a wonderful time and I really
[31:49] believe the Lord changed many lives, did
[31:51] many things, many testimonies that we
[31:53] even have uh coming in through various
[31:56] ways uh group chats and emails. And so I
[31:59] want to share just some things upon my
[32:01] heart this morning. Um, we want to be
[32:03] praying first off for my dad, our pastor
[32:05] who um, just yesterday started feeling a
[32:08] little bit under the weather. Gave me a
[32:09] little warning that um, just depending
[32:12] on how he went through the night if I
[32:14] would be uh, having to take the service
[32:15] this morning. And then this morning
[32:17] about uh, 7:30 or so, he um, he let me
[32:22] know that he wasn't feeling uh, very
[32:24] good. He's uh, just has a really
[32:26] scratchy throat, a lot of pain in his
[32:28] throat, and then a fever feeling like
[32:30] was coming upon him. So, um, you just
[32:33] want to keep him in prayer. Remember him
[32:35] this morning that the Lord just gives
[32:37] him a speedy recovery for whatever that
[32:39] is. I know there's a lot of people
[32:41] traveling also. Uh, we have quite a few
[32:43] families out this morning that are
[32:44] traveling. And, uh, and also some who
[32:47] are, uh, not well. And so, we know this
[32:49] is that time of year where sickness can
[32:52] go through. And, um, I tell you what,
[32:54] it's a miracle we didn't all come back
[32:56] from a a place with 500 and something
[32:58] people. And uh it's a miracle we don't
[33:00] have many uh more that we do uh sick and
[33:03] out. So I believe the Lord just spared
[33:05] us. I'm thankful for that. Amen. And and
[33:08] we just we're thankful for health,
[33:09] aren't we?
[33:10] &gt;&gt; You know you how you appreciate health,
[33:12] get sick.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; And uh when you get sick, you you you
[33:15] realize how much you take for granted
[33:17] health. I think God sometimes does that.
[33:20] Get lets us allows things to come upon
[33:22] us uh to contrast to make us thankful.
[33:25] Amen. when when there are times of um of
[33:28] of health. And so we're thankful for
[33:30] that.
[33:32] Second Kings chapter 18, I just want to
[33:35] um want to read just a portion of
[33:37] scripture here, then I'll have you be
[33:38] seated. Today, I want to just uh just
[33:42] share some things upon my heart. You um
[33:44] allow me to do that today. I don't
[33:46] really have a a full sermon. I don't
[33:48] really want to preach a full sermon. I
[33:50] want to also reflect on some of the
[33:53] things at camp and um just take a
[33:56] moment. We we are we actually don't ever
[33:58] really get this opportunity. Camp sort
[34:00] of comes it goes and then we last year
[34:03] we met at uh Urban Brew and with um all
[34:06] of the people and helpers at camp and
[34:07] was able to thank them personally. So I
[34:09] get that opportunity today, amen, to do
[34:12] that. And so I want to take a minute to
[34:14] do that and just to recognize some
[34:15] people. Amen. And reflect on what the
[34:18] Lord, not just what he did, but what
[34:20] he's doing. Aren't you glad that the
[34:22] Lord is actively working in our life?
[34:25] It's not just what he's what he's what
[34:27] he's done yesterday, but what he's
[34:28] actively doing. Amen. I believe I just
[34:30] want to say, Lord, I want to be a part
[34:32] of it. I want to be a part of what he's
[34:34] doing in this day. Second King First
[34:36] Kings chapter 18,
[34:38] let me just read a vers a portion of
[34:41] scripture. I want to just give this a
[34:42] title. Build an altar. That's what our
[34:45] title is going to be today. Build an
[34:48] altar. Let me make sure I have my text
[34:51] correct here. First Kings chapter 18.
[35:01] We'll we'll get to this scripture here
[35:02] in just a moment. I just want to um
[35:04] cover it here. Second Kings chapter 18.
[35:06] We'll read of just a portion and then
[35:08] have you be seated. First Kings. I'm
[35:10] Second Kings is First Kings is where I'm
[35:12] wrong. That's why I'm confused. Thank
[35:13] you, brother Andrew. Because I'm in
[35:15] First Kings and I'm thinking this is not
[35:17] lining up where it was supposed to be.
[35:19] Thank you, Lord.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; And Brother Andrew.
[35:25] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Say,
[35:27] "Praise the Lord."
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is familiar to us, real
[35:32] familiar with Elijah on Mount Carmel.
[35:34] Let's just begin reading at verse 27.
[35:36] And it came to pass at noon that Elijah
[35:39] mocked them and said, "Cry aloud, for he
[35:43] is a god.
[35:45] Either he is talking or he is pursuing,
[35:49] or he is in the journey, for her
[35:51] adventure he sleepeth must be awakened."
[35:56] And they cried aloud and cut themselves
[35:58] after their manner with knives and
[35:59] lancet till the blood gushed out upon
[36:01] them. And it came to pass when midday
[36:04] was passed and they prophesied until the
[36:06] time of the offering of the evening
[36:08] sacrifice that there was neither voice
[36:10] nor any to answer nor any that regarded.
[36:15] And Elijah said unto all the people,
[36:17] "Come near unto me." And all the people
[36:20] came near unto him. And this is where I
[36:22] want to draw our emphasis right here.
[36:25] And he repaired the altar of the Lord
[36:28] that was broken down. and he repaired
[36:31] the altar of the Lord that was broken
[36:34] down. You just want to bow your heads
[36:36] with me. Jesus, we thank you, Lord, that
[36:38] you're in control of all things,
[36:41] Lord. And I believe that you're mindful
[36:45] of us,
[36:46] &gt;&gt; of our own insufficiencies, Lord, and
[36:48] our needs. For there are many, Lord. No
[36:51] doubt, God, there would be a hand that
[36:53] could go up here this morning if I was
[36:55] to ask for anybody that needs a touch
[36:58] from the Lord. Maybe a touch in their
[37:00] body. Would you come and do that, Lord
[37:03] Jesus? Maybe a touch in their family, in
[37:06] their children, in their marriage, Lord,
[37:10] in relationships and their finances,
[37:13] God. Our
[37:15] needs would be many, Lord.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful, Lord, that you
[37:19] care about all of them. And there is no
[37:22] need too small. There is no need too
[37:26] great. For that's Lord the kind of
[37:29] father that we have. One who supplies
[37:32] all of our needs. I pray God that you
[37:34] would just touch my dad this morning as
[37:36] he's suffering at home. Our pastor Lord
[37:39] go to him Father even now on the wings
[37:41] of this prayer Lord and may you touch
[37:43] his body. Restore his strength Father.
[37:46] Restore Lord God his health. I pray for
[37:49] any of those Lord that would be sick
[37:50] this morning
[37:52] suffering. And I pray God that you would
[37:54] just bring healing Lord God to their
[37:56] bodies Lord. All of those traveling in
[37:58] the way. Bring them back here Lord. Keep
[38:00] them safe Lord on their journey. We ask
[38:03] it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You can
[38:06] be seated. Want to take just a moment
[38:09] here at
[38:11] to speak about this text that we just
[38:14] read
[38:16] with Elijah saying
[38:19] to all the people come near unto me. And
[38:21] the Bible says, "And he repaired the
[38:24] altar of the Lord that was broken down."
[38:27] You know, we just came off what we could
[38:29] call quite a mountain. As Elijah, the
[38:32] Bible says, this was the Mount Carmel
[38:34] showdown. Mount Carmel is a
[38:37] representation, you could say, of
[38:39] revival, a time that's really high,
[38:42] really good. You know, feeling like
[38:44] you're in the clouds soaring and you
[38:46] just are on top of the world. How many
[38:48] ever felt that way? Amen. Spiritually
[38:51] speaking, we can have highs. We could
[38:53] also
[38:56] we don't victorious because we're not
[38:59] really in and of ourselves. We don't we
[39:02] don't have any victory of anything that
[39:04] we can do. And so we know that in the in
[39:07] the our life or our journey with God, we
[39:10] can have those moments of high times.
[39:12] And then we would call that the the
[39:14] Mount Carmel experience where Elijah was
[39:17] on the mountain and and there's a great
[39:20] showing of of God's vindication of his
[39:22] ministry with prophets of Baal, you
[39:25] know, coming down to their uh you know
[39:27] the you know uh their altar and the
[39:29] Bible says cutting themselves and
[39:31] jumping up and down and shouting and and
[39:34] then here's Elijah there saying where is
[39:36] you know where is your God? You know,
[39:38] maybe he sleeps, maybe he adventures,
[39:41] maybe it's almost like Elijah's mocking
[39:43] them. And that's exactly what he's
[39:44] doing. He's rubbing it in that their
[39:46] gods are false gods that can't speak,
[39:49] can't help, can't touch, can't heal. But
[39:52] God said, Elijah says, "But let the God
[39:54] that answers by fire, let him vindicate
[39:58] what is right and what is wrong." And I
[40:01] I think that literally and spiritually,
[40:03] we came off very much Bethl Youth Camp.
[40:07] Uh we saw young people surrender their
[40:10] lives to the Lord Jesus for the first
[40:12] time. We ought to thank God for that.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; We seen some from our family here in our
[40:17] own church, others who came from miles
[40:20] and miles away and parents who were uh
[40:23] praying. I always never it always just
[40:27] grabs my heart because I'm a parent also
[40:29] and and I've had my children going to
[40:32] meetings or to camps and all of the
[40:34] times when I know that they're on their
[40:35] journey and they're going there to be in
[40:37] meetings and be in the presence of the
[40:39] Lord. I'm not so much concerned about
[40:42] Lord let them have a good time and let
[40:44] them you know eat lots of good food and
[40:46] let them meet lots of new friends and
[40:47] lots that's I don't know that's never
[40:49] what I'm thinking. And I know that'll
[40:50] happen anyway, but I'm always saying,
[40:52] Lord, get a hold of them. Get a hold of
[40:55] their heart, Lord. Speak to them. You
[40:57] know, let the ministry, I pray for the
[40:59] ministry that'll be in that that'll be
[41:01] ministering. Lord, uh, use them, anoint
[41:04] their vessel to speak something that
[41:06] will get a hold of them, you know,
[41:08] because many times all we can do as
[41:11] parents is just sew the seed.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; And that's all God asks us to do is sew
[41:15] the seed. And it's amazing because so
[41:17] many times you'll hear you you'll watch
[41:20] somebody that's blessed by the Lord and
[41:23] and and and and you've said it, you've
[41:25] told them as parents, the preacher is
[41:27] just saying what you've been saying for
[41:28] years now, but somehow through a
[41:31] different vessel, from a different
[41:32] approach, it takes a something grabs a
[41:34] hold of them
[41:35] &gt;&gt; and then God begins to change their
[41:37] heart. And so that's God's uh that's
[41:41] God's process is for you to sew the
[41:43] seed, continue to sew the seed
[41:46] regardless of what you see or you don't
[41:49] see. Because many times what you don't
[41:51] see is the effect of what you're sewing.
[41:54] And that brings discouragement to say is
[41:56] it doing any good? You know, does it
[41:58] even do any good to gather them around
[42:00] and talk about the Lord? Pray with them.
[42:02] I just see nothing ever changes. But let
[42:04] me just give you a word of encouragement
[42:06] today. Just keep planting the seed of
[42:09] the word of God. And when the season is
[42:11] right, it might not be you. It might be
[42:14] someone else,
[42:15] &gt;&gt; but that seed will germatize
[42:18] &gt;&gt; and come to life.
[42:21] And I think we've seen that at our camp.
[42:23] We've seen we've seen tears fall. We've
[42:26] seen young people shout and some
[42:27] rejoice. Some dance in the spirit. Some
[42:30] speak in tongues. We saw the what I
[42:32] would call the fire of God or what
[42:34] brother Brandham would call the
[42:36] blessings of God. That's what he called
[42:38] the gifts that would fall in the church
[42:40] and shouting and dancing. Those are just
[42:42] the blessings. Aren't you glad we got
[42:44] them though?
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Uh but I believe more than just an
[42:48] external experience. I truly believe
[42:50] with all of my heart that hearts
[42:53] surrendered to the Lord Jesus this past
[42:56] weekend.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that the real test
[43:01] isn't necessarily what happens when we
[43:05] could we could our sermon today our our
[43:08] inspiration is build an altar. And it
[43:11] struck me so much because in our reading
[43:14] here, if you'll notice, God never put
[43:17] the pressure or the responsibility
[43:21] upon Elijah to manufacture the fire.
[43:25] Amen.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; In fact, Elijah wasn't going to bring
[43:29] any of the fire. All God needed Elijah
[43:32] to do was to prepare the altar.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; And then he would be the one that sent
[43:38] the fire.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; And so, it isn't our job. It was never
[43:42] our job. It's never our job as parents,
[43:44] as church, as pastors, as leaders, as
[43:46] parents. It's never your job to
[43:49] manufacture the fire or to send the
[43:52] experience. All God asks us to do is to
[43:55] repair the broken altar, prepare the
[43:58] wood, and then expect a blessing to come
[44:01] from God
[44:02] &gt;&gt; to bring the fire. And so all God needed
[44:06] Elijah to do was repair the altar.
[44:12] Because the test, the real test isn't
[44:14] what happens
[44:16] when the fire falls. But can I say it to
[44:18] you this way? It's what happens when we
[44:21] go home. Amen.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Because non- youth camp,
[44:25] non-meouragement,
[44:27] that's really where character or can I
[44:30] say it this way, that's really the fire
[44:34] that proves whether you got something
[44:36] real or just an emotional workup. Amen.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Because you can have shouting at camp.
[44:42] You can have rejoicing at camp. But if
[44:45] that doesn't turn into a life that's
[44:47] surrendered to God, come on church.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Then what good was the fire that fell?
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; The fire in Elijah's day was not to be a
[44:58] burning fire that it was a supernatural
[45:01] experience. I mean, he pours buckets of
[45:03] water in that ditch and then God comes
[45:06] down with supernatural fire and doesn't
[45:08] just consume the sacrifice, but the
[45:11] Bible says he licks up all of the water
[45:14] that was in the trenches.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Now, that was a supernatural experience.
[45:18] But can I just say, what good would the
[45:22] fire have been as supernatural as it was
[45:25] if the people did not turn their hearts
[45:28] back to God?
[45:30] Amen.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; You see, the purpose was repairing the
[45:33] altar. Can you preach with me this
[45:35] morning?
[45:36] &gt;&gt; The purpose was to repair the altar.
[45:40] Because if we don't keep if we want to
[45:42] keep the fire burning, we have to
[45:44] understand something that's so simple,
[45:47] but I believe is so profound. And that
[45:50] is our job was never to send the fire.
[45:52] Our job is just to maintain the fire
[45:56] upon the altar that God sends.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; I think it's amazing because in
[46:04] scripture you can read about this.
[46:06] Before God ever sent revival, before God
[46:09] ever sent any kind of supernatural
[46:11] experience, revival, revelation, before
[46:14] God ever spoke peace uh uh uh to to to
[46:17] the earth, again, man first had to build
[46:21] an altar. You think of Abraham. The
[46:23] Bible says in Genesis 12:7, "The Lord
[46:26] appeared unto Abram and he built an
[46:28] altar unto the Lord." That's Genesis
[46:31] 12:7. Genesis 13:18. Then Abram removed
[46:36] his tent and built an altar unto the
[46:39] Lord. So every place, every chapter,
[46:44] every stop that Abraham made in his
[46:47] journey, the first thing he did before
[46:49] beginning that part of his journey or
[46:52] that phase was he first built an altar.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Before he built a house, before the
[47:00] house of the Lord was built, there first
[47:02] was an altar. Amen.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Before he pitched a tent, the Bible says
[47:08] he made an altar. You see, that's how
[47:11] important our altar is.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; God doesn't want religion or just hype
[47:18] or just good works or just good deeds or
[47:21] external uh Christianity. What he wants
[47:24] is an altar upon the heart that burns
[47:27] with the passion of God. Amen.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Isaac uh the Bible says in Genesis 26:25
[47:33] that he built an altar there and called
[47:37] the upon the name of the Lord. So he
[47:39] didn't start over. He just rebuilt the
[47:41] Bible says he rebuilt the wells. He
[47:43] redug the wells. He rebuilt the altar.
[47:46] Genesis 35:1 Jacob, you know this very
[47:49] well. The Bible says unto that God said
[47:52] unto Jacob, "Go up to Bethl and dwell
[47:55] therein." And the Bible says this, "And
[47:58] make an altar unto God."
[48:02] &gt;&gt; So God told Jacob, "Go back to Bethl."
[48:05] Which Bethl means what? Come on, Bethl.
[48:10] What does Bethl mean?
[48:15] &gt;&gt; The house of God.
[48:18] So before you can have the house of God,
[48:22] God says first build an altar.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; So, it was a call back to his first
[48:31] love, to his original flame. You know
[48:34] what's so powerful about that story
[48:36] about Jacob? If you ever go read that in
[48:38] Genesis, the Bible says Jacob has a
[48:40] dream. You remember the story? How many
[48:42] remember that he has a dream? A ladders
[48:44] going from heaven to earth and angels
[48:46] ascending and the Bible says descending.
[48:48] And the scripture says, "And God stood
[48:50] above it all." And so Jacob sees this
[48:52] supernatural experience, a ladder that
[48:54] goes up, the angels goes up, goes down,
[48:57] showing God's activity. Jacob wakes up
[48:59] out of his dream and thinks, "Oh my,
[49:01] what happened? Surely the Lord was in
[49:03] this place and I knew it not." And the
[49:05] Bible says, "And he built an all, he
[49:07] took a pillow, he took a stone where his
[49:10] head was upon where he was sleeping, and
[49:12] he memorialized that stone. He pours
[49:14] oil." You imagine seeing Jacob out there
[49:17] and then you think, "What is this guy
[49:18] doing? and he's pouring anointing oil
[49:20] upon a rock. What was it? It was there
[49:22] was something that rock might have been
[49:24] a rock, original rock, just nothing to
[49:26] nobody before. But when God does
[49:28] something for you, that church becomes
[49:30] important. That that altar becomes
[49:32] important. That sermon becomes important
[49:36] because what was it? It was what grabbed
[49:37] a hold of you. And Jacob begins to pour
[49:41] oil upon that stone and he wakes up and
[49:43] says, "Oh, surely the Lord was in this
[49:46] place and I knew it not. This is none
[49:48] other than the gate of heaven. And he
[49:50] says, "And Jacob called the name of that
[49:54] place Bethl, meaning the house of God."
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; But you know what? His life was not
[50:02] changed.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; He had an altar. He had a sacrifice. He
[50:06] had a supernatural experience.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; But yet, he went right after that. But
[50:11] you go right back to the next chapter
[50:12] and he's not going he's he's going a
[50:14] million miles away from God in lust in
[50:17] in temper in in carnal things.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; And God keeps telling him, "Come back to
[50:22] Bethl. Come back to Bethl. Come back to
[50:24] Bethl." And Jacob would build an altar.
[50:26] He'd have an experience. But he would
[50:28] never turn his heart or surrender his
[50:30] heart back to God.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Although Bethl meant the house of God.
[50:36] Go read your Bible, though. What's so
[50:38] powerful is that when God finally gets a
[50:41] hold of Jacob's heart, finally
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Dena's, you know,
[50:48] finally hold of him. The Bible says this
[50:51] that Jacob tells his tells his family,
[50:54] "Throw out your idols, take off your
[50:55] earrings." That's what he says in the
[50:57] Bible. Take throw them all off of you.
[50:59] And it says, "And let's build an altar
[51:03] and make a sacrifice unto God." And
[51:06] Jacob does that. God comes down, anoints
[51:08] it just like he did the first altar and
[51:11] sends experience. But then the you know
[51:12] what's so different? You read this. The
[51:14] Bible says that he calls the name of
[51:16] that place El Bethl
[51:21] &gt;&gt; because you see Bethl means the house of
[51:24] God. But Elbethl means the God of the
[51:27] house.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; So what do we what do we want here? We
[51:32] don't just want the house of God. How
[51:34] many want to say, "Lord, I want the God
[51:35] of the house."
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Moses, you can think of, I'm just
[51:41] skipping some of these because there's
[51:42] too many. Moses built an altar. Called
[51:44] the name of that place, altar became a
[51:46] memorial of victory. Gideon, Judges 6,
[51:48] built an altar to the Lord. Uh David in
[51:50] 2 Samuel 24 builds an altar to the Lord.
[51:53] Elijah, we just read it. He places after
[51:56] he rebuilt the altar and and the fire
[51:58] fell from heaven. Here they see a
[52:01] burning fire. But yet there would never
[52:03] be a fire without an altar. First there
[52:07] must be an altar which is a place of
[52:10] sacrifice. It's a place of repentance
[52:14] and it's a place of surrender. Prophet
[52:17] of God even talks about applying the
[52:19] token. He says when you come for the
[52:21] token what are you what are you doing?
[52:23] And he says you're not up there and in
[52:25] and one place he says you're not up
[52:26] there beating your buddy on the back at
[52:28] the altar laughing and huron and
[52:30] shouting. There's a place for shouting,
[52:32] &gt;&gt; but he says when you really come to the
[52:34] altar, there's no there's no there's no
[52:36] beating yourself and clapping your
[52:37] hands. And he says, but you're there to
[52:40] be identified with death, your
[52:42] sacrifice.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; And he says, you're coming dying out to
[52:46] yourself, surrender, repentance,
[52:50] sacrifice. Friends, you can shout,
[52:52] scream, dance, and I'm all for all. Even
[52:54] preach, and I'm for all of those things.
[52:56] But if the altar is in disrepair, the
[52:59] fire has no place to fall.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; You can't call upon God. Elijah couldn't
[53:08] call upon God with a broken altar.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; And I just I just want to say youth
[53:15] camp, 10 youth camps, 15. Someone
[53:17] suggested to me, Brother Matt, we should
[53:18] do a bianual youth camp. Oh dear.
[53:21] twice a year, three times a year. Let me
[53:23] just tell you though, whether you did 10
[53:25] a year, one every week, I don't care how
[53:28] many emotional experiences you want to
[53:30] have, if your altar is in disrepair,
[53:33] &gt;&gt; there is no true fire that falls and
[53:36] changes your heart.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; He didn't start with a prayer. Elijah
[53:40] didn't start with a prayer. He started
[53:41] with repair.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Repair the altar. And he didn't even ask
[53:46] God for that fire until that altar was
[53:49] in order. Can you say amen?
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Listen, brother Brandham says the old
[53:54] fashion, this is leadership. The
[53:56] oldfashioned altar calls, they're out of
[53:59] style today, but God still moves in
[54:02] them.
[54:04] Brother Brandham hated that that they he
[54:06] that they had abandoned the altar, even
[54:10] just something as physical as an altar
[54:12] call because God works so powerfully in
[54:15] that because it's a way that we humble
[54:19] ourselves.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Coming to the altar is humbling
[54:23] yourself.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; That's why God can use them. People want
[54:28] to say, "Brother Brandon was against
[54:29] altars." That's not true. He was against
[54:31] what the denominations had turned altar
[54:33] calls into.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; But the true altar and altar was in the
[54:38] very beginning. Even the zodiac with the
[54:40] lion, Leo the lion, all of there's the
[54:42] the altar is in those in the stars also
[54:44] because it was in the mind of God.
[54:46] Brother Brandon says here, he says um he
[54:50] says if they put them down there, this
[54:52] is and I will restore. If they put them
[54:54] down at the altar and let them pray
[54:57] there until they come through with the
[55:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost, they'd stay
[55:04] put.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; That's a powerful quote.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; This is this is this is what this is
[55:12] what brother Brandham advocated. He
[55:15] advocated
[55:16] this this as he says, "Put them at the
[55:19] altar and let them pray there, Terry
[55:22] there." Not just a simple prayer, but
[55:24] tar there till they come through with
[55:26] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. They'd
[55:28] stay put.
[55:31] He says this here, "And I will restore."
[55:33] June 20th, 1954. God don't want liies on
[55:37] the altar. He wants sinners on the
[55:39] altar.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; God don't want your lily. He wants you.
[55:44] Amen.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; You're the person that needs to be on
[55:50] the altar.
[55:52] I can read these. I can go on and on.
[55:53] Jesus saw the authority. Listen what he
[55:55] says here. When he fulfilled the vision
[55:56] of the Lord, showed him the fire of God
[55:58] fell out of the heavens and consumed the
[56:00] sacrifice. He's referring to Mount
[56:03] Carmel there. Uh Abel, listen to what he
[56:05] says here. And I will restore. Abel died
[56:07] on the altar with his lamb. And every
[56:10] man that comes to Christ must die on the
[56:13] same altar of self-sacrifice,
[56:16] forgetting your own ways. We die out to
[56:19] Christ on the altars of God's sacrifice
[56:23] and Jehovah God sending down the Holy
[56:26] Spirit stamping a seal on it as a
[56:30] confirmation.
[56:32] You say, "Brother Matt, what are you
[56:34] saying?" And I'm saying that I'm afraid
[56:35] if we're not careful, we replace an
[56:38] emotional experience or some worship
[56:41] song where we all feel the I'm not
[56:43] saying you don't feel the presence of
[56:44] God, but we all just raise our hands and
[56:47] think that's enough. Listen, friends, a
[56:49] one-time experience there with your
[56:51] emotions is not enough. I believe it's
[56:53] time we come back to the altar of
[56:56] humbling oursel and repenting and
[56:59] surrendering to God. Do I have a church
[57:02] that believes that God is not done using
[57:04] the altar or altar calls? God wants to
[57:08] bring lives, not your liies. He wants
[57:10] your life on that altar.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "Then after the foul,"
[57:16] listen to what he says here. This is thy
[57:18] church. Then after the fire fell on the
[57:21] Ohio River in 1930, a healing revival
[57:23] swept the the world. a fire that falls
[57:27] upon an altar.
[57:30] Just going to move on through some of
[57:31] this because I'm already finding that I
[57:34] just can't never do good about my time.
[57:36] So, y'all forgive me.
[57:39] I just want to reflect here just for a
[57:41] moment because I believe God did
[57:42] something so powerfully upon the altar,
[57:45] the altars of hearts this weekend. And
[57:49] and I believe I I want to be clear. I'm
[57:51] I'm I I I love all of all of camp. I
[57:54] love every year of camp that we've had.
[57:56] I love some of the moments of uh
[57:59] exhilarating energy you could feel in
[58:02] that room and and some of it there was
[58:04] just so powerful you could see if
[58:06] brother if you could just play that
[58:08] sister Sarah I sent you that you can
[58:09] just have that just on the screen just
[58:11] going skip through some of it just parts
[58:13] of the worship uh service there and then
[58:15] uh until I tell you just keep letting
[58:18] the worship play uh just make sure it's
[58:20] parts where the worship is taking place
[58:22] I just want you can drag that over and
[58:24] bring that up don't have any sound there
[58:26] in the back. Just keep that. Don't watch
[58:27] that so much. Look at it, glance at it.
[58:30] But listen to what I'm saying here. I
[58:31] just want to bring you uh by just a way
[58:33] to refresh your mind because I believe
[58:35] that God did something so special this
[58:38] past weekend. As I said, I thankful for
[58:40] every camp. I'm thankful for everything
[58:42] God did every year at camp and some of
[58:45] the moments of the energy of the worship
[58:48] of 500 uh uh people that are just
[58:50] worshiping the Lord, calling on God, the
[58:53] presence of the Lord sweeping through
[58:55] the building and and how many were
[58:56] there? Raise your hand if you were there
[58:58] at camp. We got quite a few out, quite a
[59:01] few that are here that quite a few out
[59:02] that were there. And it was just I can
[59:05] just say just whenever you want, Caleb,
[59:06] you could just start playing that. Yeah,
[59:08] just have that up. Uh, it was a powerful
[59:10] moment. Powerful moments there. Thankful
[59:13] for all of them. But can I just say what
[59:15] what I'm the most thankful for real
[59:18] simple is hearts that surrendered to
[59:21] God.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Because that's the only reason we do any
[59:27] of it.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; I love every part of it, but that's the
[59:32] only reason we do any of it. It's in the
[59:35] downloads file folder. I I air dropped
[59:38] it there. Get it on the screen. Play it.
[59:40] Go ahead and start. I'm not waiting. I'm
[59:42] just going to talk right over the top of
[59:43] it. So, you can drag it over. Is it
[59:46] working? So, okay. That's fine. Work
[59:48] through those. That's okay. Let's forget
[59:50] I said it. We might not have it. That's
[59:52] okay. I I I really don't want you to be
[59:55] distracted by that. I want you just to
[59:57] listen because this is really what the
[59:58] Lord just called me to for this morning.
[1:00:01] I I just think it's amazing when I think
[1:00:04] about Youth Camp and when I I just want
[1:00:06] to just take a moment to say it is
[1:00:09] absolutely nothing short of a miracle
[1:00:13] that this little small church
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; in a seaside city on the east coast that
[1:00:19] doesn't isn't on the way to anywhere. I
[1:00:22] tell people all the time, people say,
[1:00:24] "What's in Buford?" Marines and
[1:00:27] believers.
[1:00:29] And if you're a believer and live here,
[1:00:31] you're not. You're here because there's
[1:00:32] a church here. It's a beautiful place.
[1:00:35] But but it's amazing that that our
[1:00:39] little church, the sacrifice that we
[1:00:41] make that we could put on a camp to that
[1:00:44] size and to that scale is amazing. That
[1:00:49] t that screen does look off, brother
[1:00:51] Caleb, if you're trying to get it to
[1:00:52] come on. There it goes. It's on now.
[1:00:53] Thank you. I think that was the problem.
[1:00:56] It's amazing that something to that
[1:00:58] scale would happen. Make sure
[1:01:00] Proresenter is closed. Make sure it's
[1:01:02] closed completely. Um to think that our
[1:01:07] church, our whole church gets behind it.
[1:01:09] Stand up. Only you that were at camp.
[1:01:13] Stand up. Can you do it? Just you that
[1:01:15] were there. I want those that weren't
[1:01:16] there just to put your eyeballs on them
[1:01:19] just for a
[1:01:21] [Music]
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; and all those that aren't.
[1:01:26] He's a chain breaker.
[1:01:28] [Music]
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; I want you to know this is why we don't
[1:01:32] have church for church services.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; If you believe
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; because most of our church is gone.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; If you can feel it, somebody testify.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; We tear our apart.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Hours upon hours upon hours helping put
[1:01:53] it back together.
[1:01:56] Why don't you think of all those people
[1:01:58] that were there sacrificed their time,
[1:02:00] their labor for lives that would be
[1:02:02] changed? Those that aren't here. Uh and
[1:02:05] brother George Buckman also stand.
[1:02:07] Brother George stand. He wasn't at camp,
[1:02:09] but I want him to stand because this
[1:02:10] brother worked tirelessly with me and
[1:02:13] him for hours upon hours upon hours. And
[1:02:15] he's not old, but he's not young and I'm
[1:02:17] not going to say either. And and worked
[1:02:20] worked uh with me. Couldn't do it
[1:02:23] without him. Impossible. Why don't you
[1:02:24] give all of these these these workers a
[1:02:27] hand? Give them a good hand. Give
[1:02:29] yourself a hand.
[1:02:32] Be seated.
[1:02:34] Just skip through parts of that. Just
[1:02:35] parts of that. I just want to bring it
[1:02:37] back up to your memory and your mind.
[1:02:39] It's incredible that we can put on this
[1:02:41] type of camp. I It really is. It's
[1:02:44] nothing short of a miracle. Um, so many
[1:02:47] people put their own time, their money,
[1:02:49] their effort into it with not getting
[1:02:51] paid anything at all and paying uh to be
[1:02:54] there as we as Carolina Point charges
[1:02:56] every person that's going to be there
[1:02:58] the same exact amount. These people gave
[1:03:00] of their time. Didn't make any money.
[1:03:02] We're just volunteering their their
[1:03:03] their time away.
[1:03:07] None of them to be seen. None of them
[1:03:09] did it to be a pat on the back. They did
[1:03:11] it for one thing. that God could have an
[1:03:13] altar where kids could come to and
[1:03:15] surrender their lives to the Lord Jesus.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; That's the only reason we do it. I want
[1:03:20] it to be clear. We built an altar.
[1:03:22] That's all.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; That's what God told us to do. Repair
[1:03:26] the altar of the Lord. A lot of people,
[1:03:30] you know, can I just say that that I'll
[1:03:32] just take just a moment just to say this
[1:03:34] really quickly. A lot of people have
[1:03:36] complimented how good the video is, how
[1:03:39] good the audio. There was a team there
[1:03:41] that done that and how much we it's
[1:03:43] incredible that we have something like
[1:03:45] this. The video that we have, the audio
[1:03:47] that we have, and and and got testimony
[1:03:50] after testimony after testimony, people
[1:03:52] saying, "I felt like I was there. Thank
[1:03:53] you. I felt like I was right in in the
[1:03:55] room." And that's why we do it. And I'll
[1:03:57] just give it just a little short uh
[1:03:59] mission statement. Well, you say,
[1:04:00] "Brother Matt, why do you put so much
[1:04:02] time and effort? And couldn't you save
[1:04:04] yourself so much effort just to put a
[1:04:07] little, you know, PTZ camera, security
[1:04:09] cam at the back with a wide view and and
[1:04:11] never moves and you just watch the room
[1:04:12] and and have sound
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; like this over 10 cam.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; You could do all of that and I could why
[1:04:18] why wouldn't you do that? I tell you
[1:04:20] why. And just tell you my own
[1:04:21] inspiration in COVID during COVID 2020
[1:04:24] and all my kids were home and we were
[1:04:25] all home and I I get to watch my kids
[1:04:28] that you don't get to pay attention to
[1:04:29] as much and they're on their phones.
[1:04:31] They're con they're consuming content.
[1:04:33] They're watching videos from you know I
[1:04:36] just you know different won't name any
[1:04:38] names but music good music some of it uh
[1:04:41] from from uh you know from different
[1:04:44] mega churches and different you know
[1:04:46] groups and you know who I'm talking
[1:04:47] about different ones and and they're in
[1:04:49] video and you're watching the video and
[1:04:51] they're playing on the screen and we're
[1:04:53] watching and then you're hearing all
[1:04:54] these you know uh you know non-denom
[1:04:57] some non-denomination non-es believers
[1:04:59] but they're putting out music that
[1:05:01] sounds good people Mike I realize my
[1:05:03] kids I don't they don't grow up in the
[1:05:05] world that I grew up in.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Whether you like it or not, parents,
[1:05:09] this is a content consumption age.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Whether we like it or not.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, bless God, we ought to go back to no
[1:05:18] to live streaming. Okay, I don't you
[1:05:20] might you that might be your approach.
[1:05:22] My approach is God's word meets the
[1:05:24] challenge of the day, the hour, the
[1:05:26] moment.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; And many times we want to look back, but
[1:05:30] this what we're facing today is a
[1:05:31] different world. It's a different age.
[1:05:33] They're watching stuff. And so I just
[1:05:34] thought here my kids are spending hours
[1:05:36] upon hours on Spotify and listening to,
[1:05:39] you know, secular, not secular, but
[1:05:41] Christian contemporary is what I mean to
[1:05:42] say, music, and they got their videos
[1:05:44] and they look good. I thought, well, if
[1:05:46] they're going to consume content, why
[1:05:48] can't we have something that doesn't
[1:05:51] look like it was put on a bubblegum
[1:05:53] budget? Why why can't we have something
[1:05:55] that is nice for our people to be able
[1:05:58] to listen to bride music? Amen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Are do you do you get what I'm saying
[1:06:04] here this morning?
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; So that's why we do what we do because I
[1:06:09] want there to be if if the world has if
[1:06:12] the nominal church has that I'm not
[1:06:14] trying to compete with them but brother
[1:06:15] Brandham said if you're going to do
[1:06:16] something for God do your best.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; And so if that means cameras and more
[1:06:22] angles and better views and higher
[1:06:24] definition and better sound then to God
[1:06:27] be the glory.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:31] It it's amazing because so many people
[1:06:33] put their time, put their effort and and
[1:06:35] every young person whose life was
[1:06:37] changed. I want to say to those who work
[1:06:39] tireless, I know there's many who wanted
[1:06:41] to help and couldn't.
[1:06:43] I just want to say that for every life
[1:06:45] that was changed,
[1:06:47] you'll have a blessing on the other side
[1:06:48] for that work and labor you put in.
[1:06:52] I I there's so many different uh
[1:06:55] categories here that I could read from,
[1:06:57] and I'm just going to do it here for a
[1:06:58] moment. I want you to um recognize the
[1:07:02] musicians that were there. We had
[1:07:03] brother Steve Curtis, Brother Micah
[1:07:05] Curtis, Sister Julia, uh Buckman, Sister
[1:07:08] Deborah Jackson, Brother Andrew Cobb,
[1:07:11] Brother Chris Watkins, Brother John
[1:07:12] Lineich, Brother Aaron. Why don't we
[1:07:14] give all of these brothers and sisters a
[1:07:17] hand? Amen.
[1:07:21] We had deacons there. Some serving from
[1:07:24] not all the people I'm going to even
[1:07:25] hear today are from. We had others from
[1:07:27] other churches that helped deacons and
[1:07:29] worship leaders. I want to thank brother
[1:07:31] Tony for how much he did with the
[1:07:34] worship service and leading worship year
[1:07:36] after year faithfully like that. I
[1:07:38] believe brother Tony uh deserves a round
[1:07:41] of applause even though he's not here
[1:07:42] this morning.
[1:07:44] The security team that that worked
[1:07:47] there, all the brothers that were there
[1:07:49] and and the concession team. And I just
[1:07:51] I I I just want to say here for a moment
[1:07:54] that um there were so many people that
[1:07:56] helped. I couldn't even name all the
[1:07:57] names, but there were so many different
[1:08:00] people. I want you if you helped in
[1:08:02] concessions or hot food, stand. If you
[1:08:04] did at all, stand to your feet. Go
[1:08:06] ahead. Do it, sisters. Don't be shy.
[1:08:08] Stand up. Stand up. All of those that
[1:08:11] helped in concessions and some of those
[1:08:13] that aren't here, stand up. Stand up.
[1:08:14] You're not done. I I want you to give
[1:08:16] this crew a round of applause. They
[1:08:19] deserve it.
[1:08:21] Amen.
[1:08:23] And and I can't say enough about my
[1:08:25] wife. I really can't. And I don't think
[1:08:28] many of you can either.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Even if you tried, it wouldn't be
[1:08:31] enough.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Who worked so hard and so tirelessly
[1:08:35] puts her whole uh everything she's got
[1:08:38] into that to to be a blessing to make
[1:08:41] camp possible. And all the workers that
[1:08:43] headed that team up. Sister Amber Smith
[1:08:45] heading up the check-in team and and and
[1:08:48] and and all of the work and stood up.
[1:08:50] She stood up for the concessions.
[1:08:52] Brother uh you know uh Tony could have
[1:08:55] stood up for security. I I would do it,
[1:08:56] but I just don't want people to, you
[1:08:58] know, stand and sit stand and sit. But
[1:09:00] so many people play multiple roles. It

[1:12:22] Um, and so I just want to say thank you.
[1:12:24] Sister Emily Curtis also has been a
[1:12:26] counselor every single year since we
[1:12:28] started. It's a hard job. We choose very
[1:12:31] carefully. Thank you, Sister Emily. Give
[1:12:32] her a hand for doing that year after
[1:12:35] year. And brother Steve to go without

[1:12:39] Brother Wes Ardell, different ones who
[1:12:41] came. and so many so so so many I could
[1:12:44] I could say that came and were helpful
[1:12:46] and were a part. I just want to say
[1:12:48] thank you for coming. It was a I believe
[1:12:52] a a a investment that will be worth it
[1:12:55] and will echo throughout the hills of
[1:12:58] eternity. Do you believe that?
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Um make sure I'm not forgetting here
[1:13:03] anything today. Let me just read through
[1:13:04] my notes. Um yes uh just so much so many
[1:13:09] people were so essential. um to the camp
[1:13:12] in so many ways and and uh I just am so
[1:13:16] thankful the planning group that we have
[1:13:18] that gets starts February usually of
[1:13:20] every year and starts planning for youth
[1:13:22] youth camp um really in May or June
[1:13:25] especially working very hard the
[1:13:28] planners it's a huge sacrifice um and so
[1:13:31] I just want to say
[1:13:33] um
[1:13:35] I I would just like to say thank you if
[1:13:37] you're a young person and you were at
[1:13:38] camp one of our own youth why don't you
[1:13:41] Stand up just for a second. Stand up. If
[1:13:43] you were a young person and you were at
[1:13:45] camp, even if you weren't a camper,
[1:13:47] Emariah, stand up. Every young person
[1:13:50] that was there, I want you to look
[1:13:52] because this is the next generation of
[1:13:53] Bethl Youth Camp, give them a hand for
[1:13:56] being a testimony.
[1:13:59] Amen. Be seated.
[1:14:02] Thank you. And I just want to say thank
[1:14:04] you so much to all of those um brother
[1:14:08] Andrew for taking all the specials in
[1:14:10] that you did the way you did. I'm
[1:14:11] getting texts so I'm just reading these.
[1:14:12] So many people are thinking of so many
[1:14:14] people. Sorry if I miss anybody uh
[1:14:16] today, but I just want to say thank you
[1:14:19] so much. And I believe that heaven uh is
[1:14:22] happy. I believe the Lord Jesus is happy
[1:14:25] and he's pleased. Aren't you glad you
[1:14:28] could do a part?
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you can be a part?
[1:14:32] And if you weren't at camp, um, if you
[1:14:35] weren't at camp and, um, and you want
[1:14:39] and weren't able to help, we understand
[1:14:40] that. If you want to help, we always
[1:14:42] need more help. Every single year, it
[1:14:43] seems like getting more and more help. I
[1:14:45] just want to take just a moment before
[1:14:47] we close just to think about the
[1:14:49] ministers just before it's 12:18, so
[1:14:52] I'll get you out way earlier than than
[1:14:54] we usually are. Can you just give me a
[1:14:56] couple more minutes? Just a couple more.
[1:14:59] Um, I just want to say how much I'm
[1:15:01] thankful to Brother Ronnie Long for
[1:15:04] coming. Um, also, yes, Jonathan and
[1:15:07] Martha, thank you so much for the hikes
[1:15:09] that they did and actually my brother
[1:15:10] helping with the prayer line. I don't
[1:15:12] want to forget
[1:15:15] making
[1:15:17] them a hand.
[1:15:21] Amen. And so, I I uh I want to thank
[1:15:24] brother Ronnie for coming and and just
[1:15:26] take a moment. Brother Ronnie started
[1:15:28] and opened our service. I thought it was
[1:15:30] just so powerful with just a yes.
[1:15:34] That's what brother Ronnie's uh thought
[1:15:37] was upon was God is only looking for a
[1:15:41] yes. How many appreciated what our
[1:15:43] brother Ronnie spoke? I think it was
[1:15:45] called the power of yes or the power of
[1:15:47] a yes. And and and he talked about
[1:15:51] reclaiming the ground for God,
[1:15:53] reclaiming your ground. him. He talk he
[1:15:56] took the scripture out of Romans chapter
[1:15:58] uh 10 where the Bible says the word is
[1:16:00] nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy
[1:16:03] heart that if thou shalt confess with
[1:16:04] thy mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in
[1:16:06] thy heart thou shalt be saved. And and
[1:16:09] brother Ronnie opened it just with these
[1:16:10] on my notes. I'm not asking for a lot
[1:16:12] tonight. I'm just asking for a one
[1:16:15] thing, a yes, just one word. He reminded
[1:16:19] us that our confession has power.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. and that what we speak in our
[1:16:25] mouth can shape an atmosphere.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; I believe it shaped the whole youth
[1:16:30] camp.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; That power of yes, agreeing with God's
[1:16:34] word can break strongholds in people's
[1:16:36] lives. Years that of struggle and just a
[1:16:39] yes, just an agreement uh uh based on
[1:16:42] upon the word of God. He told us that
[1:16:44] we're we're in Lady Aia, but we're not
[1:16:47] Ladyans. He reminded us that uh young
[1:16:49] people that you weren't born in this age
[1:16:51] by accident, but that God saw the age
[1:16:54] you would live in and the confusion and
[1:16:56] the filth and the social pressure, the
[1:16:58] temptations of technology. And yet he
[1:17:01] still sent you here anyway because he
[1:17:03] called you and trusted you to be an
[1:17:06] overcomer.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; And and and that line just stuck with
[1:17:10] me. You're not in Lady. You're you're in
[1:17:12] Lady A, but you're not Lady Aans. You're
[1:17:15] of this, you're in this world, but
[1:17:16] you're not of the world. You're
[1:17:18] different. The world, the word makes you
[1:17:21] different than the world. He talked
[1:17:23] about how that you're sponsored. You've
[1:17:26] got a sponsor. You've been sponsored by
[1:17:27] the Lord Jesus. Remember that? He talked
[1:17:29] about Nike sponsoring LeBron James for
[1:17:32] $75 million a year. Not because he's
[1:17:34] average, not because he's just another
[1:17:36] guy playing basketball because they but
[1:17:38] because they believe in him. And then
[1:17:40] brother Ronnie says, "And Christ has
[1:17:42] sponsored you." Think about that. He put
[1:17:45] his name upon you. He put his badge upon
[1:17:48] you. And he didn't sponsor you to fall
[1:17:50] or to be a lady of sin. He sponsored you
[1:17:52] to overcome.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; And and he's never lost a battle. Amen.
[1:17:57] He's never backed up. He's never
[1:17:59] apologized. And that's that's whose logo
[1:18:02] you're wearing. The logo of the Holy
[1:18:04] Ghost is our emblem. That's the team I'm
[1:18:07] part of.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; He talked about that to say yes to God
[1:18:10] and not to the devil. reminded us that
[1:18:12] the devil only has the power that we
[1:18:14] loan him through our thoughts. When you
[1:18:16] start believing his his lies, you begin
[1:18:18] to empower his works. But when you say
[1:18:21] yes to the promises of God, you strip
[1:18:23] him of that power. He said you didn't
[1:18:25] God didn't send you to this age to be
[1:18:28] powerless. He he equipped you with
[1:18:30] everything you need to overcome every
[1:18:33] enemy that you will face. Anxiety,
[1:18:36] depression, fear. They might attack you,
[1:18:38] but they can't own you because Christ
[1:18:41] bought you already.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; These are just reminders of some of the
[1:18:47] things we learn. I just don't want the
[1:18:48] fire to go out. I want these to be
[1:18:50] important to us. I believe God said
[1:18:52] something to us. He talked about David
[1:18:54] and how even David's own father didn't
[1:18:56] believe in him. He wasn't the strongest.
[1:18:58] He wasn't the tallest. He wasn't the
[1:19:00] most qualified. But when God called
[1:19:02] David, David said yes. And that yes
[1:19:06] anointed him to tear down and to bring
[1:19:08] down giants. He talked about Isaiah who
[1:19:11] answered the call when God said, "Who
[1:19:13] shall I send?" And he said, "Here am I.
[1:19:15] Send me." That one yes. Changed an
[1:19:18] entire nation. Um and he asked the
[1:19:21] question, "Do I have any Isaiah's in the
[1:19:23] building? Do I have any Davids in the
[1:19:25] building? Any Paul's? People that are
[1:19:27] willing to forsake their own ways and
[1:19:29] just say yes to God." He told us that
[1:19:33] your yes changes everything. Sometimes
[1:19:35] God just wants a yes. Not an
[1:19:36] explanation, not a plan, just a yes. He
[1:19:39] told us that many of the struggles we
[1:19:41] face aren't meant to crush us. They're
[1:19:44] meant to reveal the potential that's
[1:19:46] been stored inside of us all along. The
[1:19:49] potential means stored energy. And God
[1:19:52] placed that energy inside of us before
[1:19:55] the foundation of the world. Uh friends,
[1:19:57] I believe it was a challenge to our
[1:19:59] church. It was a challenge to our young
[1:20:00] people. Uh we uh to to give a yes. Will
[1:20:04] you say yes to the call? Yes to the
[1:20:06] surrender. Yes to the change. Yes to the
[1:20:09] freedom. Yes to be used by God.
[1:20:14] I I loved brother Paul's sermon. He
[1:20:17] preached to us and also the devotions. I
[1:20:19] won't get into those this morning. They
[1:20:21] were wonderful uh there with brother
[1:20:23] Paul and and brother Diggs. And brother
[1:20:26] Paul's sermon was I I believe if I got
[1:20:28] the title right was called the zeal of
[1:20:30] thine house or something like that. Is
[1:20:32] that right?
[1:20:34] something like that. And he and he
[1:20:36] talked about it was a call it was it was
[1:20:39] a sermon about personal revival. How
[1:20:42] many of you remember that sermon? If you
[1:20:44] didn't, it's on the internet. You can go
[1:20:46] back and stream it. You could take that
[1:20:48] down now. Thank you.
[1:20:51] He talked about the zeal for the house
[1:20:53] of God
[1:20:56] and he talked about men who had gone on
[1:20:58] before. story referenced brother
[1:20:59] Hilderbrand I believe brother Biscoll
[1:21:01] brother Soraniano different ones who had
[1:21:02] passed away men who were examples
[1:21:06] uh in the house of God. He said
[1:21:08] something that was so powerful. He said
[1:21:10] never underestimate that God puts images
[1:21:13] in our lives to inspire us to encourage
[1:21:16] us and to set the road right before us.
[1:21:21] He he told us about the Apostle Paul's
[1:21:23] words, "Follow me as I follow Christ."
[1:21:28] How that God always has someone in your
[1:21:30] life, a living example to show you the
[1:21:32] way. Doesn't leave you without a guide.
[1:21:34] The Holy Spirit's the guide. But God
[1:21:37] puts men in your life, people in your
[1:21:38] life, mothers, fathers, leaders that
[1:21:41] that God says these are people that have
[1:21:43] been sent as beacons to to light the
[1:21:46] way.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; You remember brother Ann told about that
[1:21:49] story? I forget the man's name in
[1:21:51] present stage of my ministry. He's
[1:21:52] talking about he has that dream of
[1:21:54] brother Brandham and he says and I was
[1:21:55] following you and I lost you and you
[1:21:57] went up the mountain and and and he says
[1:21:59] how do I get there and brother Brandham
[1:22:01] says he says brother just follow the
[1:22:03] bloody footsteps
[1:22:05] because that's what I did. I followed
[1:22:07] the bloody footsteps of the Lord Jesus.
[1:22:11] He talked about this King Josiah young
[1:22:14] man eight years old who carried a burden
[1:22:17] for the house of God. Brother Paul said
[1:22:20] Josiah was known for what what what we'd
[1:22:22] call a spiritual house cleaning. The
[1:22:25] Bible says he removed groves and altars
[1:22:28] and spirits and some of the things that
[1:22:30] the Bible records that were happening
[1:22:32] right around the house of God, right by
[1:22:34] the temple of God. Some some of the most
[1:22:37] terrible things you could ever imagine.
[1:22:39] Trash that was just there. And and it
[1:22:42] was amazing enough that go that there
[1:22:44] was right near the right in the church
[1:22:46] they were there was you know uh temple
[1:22:49] prostitutes and all kinds of just things
[1:22:51] that you wouldn't believe were written
[1:22:52] in the Bible. And brother Paul said it
[1:22:54] was it was bad enough that they were
[1:22:55] there in church. What was worse is that
[1:22:57] no one was saying anything about it
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; and that people had just became okay
[1:23:03] with it until God dropped the Josiah man
[1:23:06] who said yes. He dropped something a
[1:23:08] young man just a youth into his heart to
[1:23:11] clean the house of God. Then he came to
[1:23:14] that powerful part you all remember
[1:23:16] where he talked about and when they got
[1:23:18] to cleaning Josiah started cleaning the
[1:23:20] house of God. And when he was in the
[1:23:22] middle of cleaning they found the book
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; and the open book revelation to Josiah
[1:23:29] is what changed everything for the
[1:23:30] children of Israel. And while they were
[1:23:32] sweeping and removing the clutter,
[1:23:34] Hilkkey, I believe the high priest in
[1:23:36] the Bible that finds the book of the law
[1:23:38] buried somewhere in the house of God.
[1:23:40] Had it been destroyed, it hadn't been
[1:23:42] burned. It was just buried under what
[1:23:45] they had neglected.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Some just some reflections from camp. I
[1:23:52] believe it's powerful
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; because that book was open to Josiah.
[1:23:56] Brother Paul said that's why his actions
[1:23:58] were to clean. That's why he went about
[1:24:00] cleaning the house. When the word was
[1:24:03] opened, everything changed.
[1:24:06] Conviction comes, cleansing comes,
[1:24:09] repairing the altar cl comes. He didn't
[1:24:11] just read. He didn't just read the book
[1:24:14] that they found.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; He responded to the book that they
[1:24:18] found.
[1:24:20] Not just intellectually, it caused
[1:24:22] action. It did something in his life. He
[1:24:25] read us Psalms 69
[1:24:28] verse9, the zeal of thine house
[1:24:32] has eaten me up.
[1:24:35] Reminded us this scripture pointed to
[1:24:37] Jesus when Jesus goes into the temple
[1:24:39] and found it being used for money and
[1:24:42] for selling and and he turns the tables
[1:24:44] over and takes a whip and and he says,
[1:24:46] "My house shall be called a house of
[1:24:48] prayer. You've made it a den of thieves.
[1:24:50] You've made it, you know, a house of
[1:24:51] reproach." became a marketplace
[1:24:55] and and he he he talks about the
[1:24:58] phenomenon. You remember this the
[1:24:59] phenomenon he read an article about the
[1:25:01] phenomenon of the third generation. How
[1:25:04] many remember that the third generation?
[1:25:06] He read from a study showing how that
[1:25:08] every movement even brought it down into
[1:25:11] every family, every church tends to go
[1:25:12] through with this third generation
[1:25:15] pattern. The first generation is
[1:25:18] dynamic, full of sacrifice, full of
[1:25:20] fire, full of potential, full of vision.
[1:25:23] But then the second generation starts to
[1:25:25] try to protect the movement. Remember
[1:25:27] that?
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; And they they inherit what the first one
[1:25:30] built. And they focus on maintaining
[1:25:33] what rather than advancing, rather than
[1:25:35] going forward, they just focus on
[1:25:37] maintaining what the first generation
[1:25:39] accomplished. And then he talked about
[1:25:42] the third generation comes along and
[1:25:44] they've only heard the stories. They've
[1:25:46] only have the memories. They only have
[1:25:47] the history. They didn't live it. It
[1:25:49] wasn't their life. They don't feel the
[1:25:51] same way about it. And he says that
[1:25:54] third generation is marked by decline.
[1:25:57] And they start asking, "Why are we even
[1:25:59] doing this?"
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? Why the prophet of
[1:26:05] God in the Ephesian church age said,
[1:26:06] "God has no grandchildren."
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; One revival isn't just passed down to
[1:26:10] the next revival because because this is
[1:26:12] what will happen. and the third
[1:26:13] generation phenomenon where we have
[1:26:14] children that were raised in the message
[1:26:16] some who were in brother Brandham's
[1:26:17] meetings defended it fought for it lived
[1:26:19] it was their focus their burden their
[1:26:21] passion and then the second generation
[1:26:23] just comes along and says yeah we
[1:26:24] believe all that let's protect what we
[1:26:26] have and let's try to maintain what we
[1:26:27] have then the third as generations go
[1:26:29] and time goes the third generation has
[1:26:31] no connection to that
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; and so they go what what is this what is
[1:26:34] this dress code what is dresses and p
[1:26:37] and no p and no makeup and no earrings
[1:26:39] and a prophet and seventh angel and
[1:26:41] mysteries and thunders And some of our
[1:26:43] people don't even read the have never to
[1:26:45] this if I would to embarrass us
[1:26:47] embarrass us today to show a ra a
[1:26:49] raising of hand who has read the church
[1:26:50] age book from front to back who's read
[1:26:52] the seven seals book.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is what's to get us in
[1:26:55] rapture.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; If I was to show a show of hands who's
[1:27:00] read it that's that third generation
[1:27:02] curse. But here's what God needs. God
[1:27:05] needs you to repair your altar and let a
[1:27:08] fire that fell on the first generation
[1:27:10] come upon the third and fourth
[1:27:11] generation to where the revival isn't
[1:27:14] mamas, daddies, pastors, brothers,
[1:27:16] sisters. It's my revival.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; He talked about that. He said, "It's
[1:27:22] simply, you know, brother saying that
[1:27:24] simply the manifestation of the truth.
[1:27:26] God has no grandchildren. Each must have
[1:27:28] their own experience with God. The
[1:27:31] fervent desire to please God, the
[1:27:33] passion of know his word, the cry for
[1:27:35] reach out of the spirit began to fade.
[1:27:36] Instead of that church being on fire
[1:27:38] with the fire of God, it's cooled off
[1:27:39] and became formal.
[1:27:42] That's what was happening to the
[1:27:43] Ephesians. And and and and they became
[1:27:46] concerned. And brother Brandham says it
[1:27:48] this way. He says they begin to he says
[1:27:51] he says not care. I'm trying to say the
[1:27:54] word the way brother Brandham worded it.
[1:27:56] not to be too careful about what God
[1:27:58] thought of them and begin to be careful
[1:28:01] about what the world thought instead.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And brother Paul said something so
[1:28:06] powerful. He said, "We live in an hour
[1:28:07] where young people are constantly
[1:28:09] comparing themselves on social media.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Scrolling, watching, comparing, it leads
[1:28:14] to depression. It leads to emptiness."
[1:28:17] Can I get an amen?
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; You aren't you, Brother Paul said,
[1:28:20] you're not called to compare yourself
[1:28:21] with anyone else. You're called to look
[1:28:23] to God's word and say, "Lord, what do
[1:28:25] you think of me?"
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; When you start trying to conform to the
[1:28:29] world, you start drifting one small step
[1:28:32] at a time. One little, as brother Paul,
[1:28:34] one little deviation from the word is a
[1:28:36] step away from Christ.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; He talked about when brother Paul talked
[1:28:41] about worship, he told the story behind
[1:28:43] the song, Matt Redmond's song, the heart
[1:28:45] of worship that we sing. I'm coming back
[1:28:48] to the heart of worship. And he took
[1:28:50] something so powerful out of that that
[1:28:51] the song was not wasn't written from it.
[1:28:58] There was a the church that he read
[1:28:59] about and how that they became too
[1:29:01] focused. He felt too focused on music,
[1:29:03] too centered around performance and
[1:29:05] production and people weren't enjoying
[1:29:08] worship. They he says people were
[1:29:10] enjoying worship but they weren't
[1:29:12] encountering God.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; So the pastor did something what they
[1:29:16] thought was radical. He he he he says,
[1:29:18] "We believe we lost the meaning of
[1:29:20] worship." And so he removed the
[1:29:22] instruments.
[1:29:24] He removed all the lights. He removed
[1:29:26] the sound system. No band, no tracks,
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; just hearts.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; And that's true worship.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; A he began to say, you know, we're it's
[1:29:39] what the pastor said. We're not going to
[1:29:41] sing to God until we learn to sing for
[1:29:44] God again.
[1:29:46] And God began to move and and he and he
[1:29:48] sat down with his guitar and began to
[1:29:50] write the song. I'm coming back to the
[1:29:51] heart of worship. It's all about you,
[1:29:54] Jesus. Sorry, Lord, for the thing I've
[1:29:56] made it. When it's all about you.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; It's all about you. This is brother Paul
[1:30:01] said, that's what happens when the open
[1:30:02] book is found. Worship goes from
[1:30:05] performance back to presence, back to
[1:30:08] his presence. That's what revival really
[1:30:11] is. coming back to the heart of what it
[1:30:14] all means.
[1:30:15] Just for to save time, I'm just going to
[1:30:17] skip some of this. He talked about
[1:30:18] Jonah, you know, and and and and he and
[1:30:21] he talks about the third and fourth
[1:30:23] generation, and he reminded us God's
[1:30:26] eyes are on this generation.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, he told us that
[1:30:29] God's eyes always were upon the next
[1:30:32] generation. Even when the world was
[1:30:34] dark, God was looking ahead.
[1:30:37] And and and and this is a powerful
[1:30:39] statement. I think it's so true. He
[1:30:40] said, "This camp did not originate with
[1:30:42] brother Jason. It originated in God's
[1:30:44] desire to deal with young people.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; That wasn't man's idea. That's God's."
[1:30:49] And I say, "God, don't ever let it be
[1:30:52] about our church or us or a ministry.
[1:30:54] Come on, somebody. Don't ever let it be
[1:30:56] about my music or or or or some
[1:30:58] performance or some production that I'm
[1:31:00] thankful for all of that. But let it be
[1:31:03] about hearts
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; that repair the altar and a fire lights
[1:31:07] the upon their altar and they're changed
[1:31:09] from who they were to who God had
[1:31:12] intended them to be.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Let it remain the heart of worship. I
[1:31:16] think it was so powerful some things
[1:31:18] that were so laser accurate with some of
[1:31:21] the things brother Paul had to say.
[1:31:23] Brother Donnie spoke to us on Saturday
[1:31:25] and and he talked about the danger of an
[1:31:28] uncsured heart. Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; The church he talked about was God's
[1:31:32] university and how that even angels
[1:31:34] learn from us as they watch us and and
[1:31:36] and the B he quotes the scripture that
[1:31:39] they're sent to angels are sent to
[1:31:41] minister to the heirs of salvation and
[1:31:43] talks about how that they're even
[1:31:44] learning from us. Ephesians 3 the
[1:31:46] manifold wisdom of God is being revealed
[1:31:48] through us that angels actually study
[1:31:50] our lives to understand mercy and grace
[1:31:53] and redemption.
[1:31:56] And he says the church is a university.
[1:31:58] Each each of you are professors teaching
[1:32:00] angels by the way you live. That means
[1:32:02] your trials, your tests, your
[1:32:04] shortcomings,
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; your times you stagger. Many Christians,
[1:32:10] you know that that there's something God
[1:32:12] is doing in our life. He's blinging out
[1:32:14] a story out of our life. He talks about
[1:32:18] Abraham and his progressive walk of
[1:32:20] faith. And using Abraham, he showed how
[1:32:22] that God's dealing comes in stages.
[1:32:24] progression like progressive revelation.
[1:32:27] And he and he talked about he talked
[1:32:29] about Lot how that Lot separated Abraham
[1:32:31] separated himself from just going
[1:32:33] through some of these and and he talked
[1:32:35] about how that Abraham had to separate
[1:32:36] from everything because total obedience
[1:32:39] requires total surrender. Total re total
[1:32:42] separation.
[1:32:44] Total obedience brings total possession.
[1:32:46] But you first must have a total
[1:32:48] separation. Brother Brandon preaches
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; of unbelief and partial surrender.
[1:32:53] Listen, I'm just bringing some of these
[1:32:55] stones back to your mind here. Partial
[1:32:58] surrender has consequences.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; He he he quoted from brother Brandham al
[1:33:06] Shadi. When you come to total obedience,
[1:33:08] then you can have possession.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Donnie says, "Yet so many are
[1:33:12] not yet in total possession because we
[1:33:15] don't have total surrender."
[1:33:17] He talked about the I'm just going to go
[1:33:20] through some of the these things here.
[1:33:22] talk about the inner battle.
[1:33:25] How that brother Brandham says, "My
[1:33:26] greatest enemy is is is me.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Not my brother, not my sister, it's me."
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; And even after decades of ministry,
[1:33:34] brother Donnie was talking about what he
[1:33:36] wrestles with the most is his self, his
[1:33:38] wills, his desires. And the greatest
[1:33:41] hindrance to more of God isn't what's on
[1:33:44] the outside that we blame. It's on the
[1:33:47] internal pride and resistance from the
[1:33:49] heart.
[1:33:51] When you surrender fully, he comes in
[1:33:53] fully. Can you say amen?
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; He talks about how that God wants a
[1:33:58] complete surrender. We know all of the
[1:34:00] things he talked about Samson and and
[1:34:03] and and and how that his heart he gave
[1:34:06] his strength to Delilah. I'm sorry. He g
[1:34:09] he gave his strength to God, but Samson
[1:34:12] gave his heart to Delilah.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; And all the potential. Brother Brandon
[1:34:19] makes that comment about there in the
[1:34:21] church age book I believe that he talks
[1:34:23] about the the bride church the super
[1:34:25] church super race and he says and his
[1:34:27] they will have his potentials
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; who's his his potentials
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; but potential doesn't mean it'll come to
[1:34:36] pass
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; it takes a surrender can you say amen
[1:34:40] just closing don't get scared about to
[1:34:42] close
[1:34:44] it was it was a it was God imploring us
[1:34:48] to have a full surrender.
[1:34:51] God wants a complete surrender and Satan
[1:34:55] tries to keep us at a half-yielded,
[1:34:58] halfhearted
[1:35:00] surrender.
[1:35:04] And he says, "Some people have walked
[1:35:05] away from this message not because it
[1:35:07] wasn't true, but because they never
[1:35:08] really caught the reality of it." It's
[1:35:11] not enough to say I believe, brother
[1:35:12] Brandham.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; We need more than knowledge.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; And that's the call of God today.
[1:35:23] Surrender. Surrender your heart.
[1:35:25] Surrender your thoughts. Surrender your
[1:35:27] will. Surrender your pride. Surrender
[1:35:30] your all.
[1:35:32] Not partially.
[1:35:34] Just feel the Holy Spirit just as we
[1:35:36] close here today.
[1:35:38] Surrender completely to him.
[1:35:42] Surrender your all to him.
[1:35:44] We want salvation of our home. You know,
[1:35:49] one man in the Bible cried for that.
[1:35:51] It's man by the name of one of the most
[1:35:53] powerful scriptures you'll ever read.
[1:35:56] I so relate to it. I believe all of us
[1:35:58] can today. It was a man named Cornelius.
[1:36:01] And he had one simple request. Save my
[1:36:05] home.
[1:36:08] Save it, Lord.
[1:36:11] Save my home.
[1:36:14] And all of us today could have a house
[1:36:16] that needs to be saved. Whether that's
[1:36:18] literally spiritually, physical
[1:36:20] salvation needed, spiritual, financial,
[1:36:23] disaster facing you, threatening your
[1:36:26] home, threatening your life.
[1:36:30] I just wrote some of these notes even
[1:36:32] not really able to preach it here today.
[1:36:34] But is your house torn by tension,
[1:36:38] strife,
[1:36:41] impending problems and rebellion and
[1:36:46] impaired love or troubled relationships?
[1:36:49] Is your life, your faith, your marriage,
[1:36:51] your house in any danger? Is there need
[1:36:54] for genuine a genuine miracle of God for
[1:36:58] deliverance and salvation? I'm remember
[1:37:01] I am preaching today.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Build an altar.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; And I'm convinced more than ever before
[1:37:08] Satan is he's not afraid of youth camps,
[1:37:11] friend. He's not afraid of that one, you
[1:37:13] know, bubble on the on the on the map,
[1:37:16] you know, one high spot, you know, big
[1:37:18] spot that was big and a big moment. He's
[1:37:20] not afraid of that. He's afraid of
[1:37:21] people that have a altar that's repaired
[1:37:24] that the fire of God is burning upon a
[1:37:27] surrendered heart. He's he's trying
[1:37:30] Satan is trying everything he can with
[1:37:32] all his cunningness and wisdom and
[1:37:34] technology and it's Satan's Eden to
[1:37:36] destroy homes. If he wants to destroy
[1:37:39] churches, he must first destroy homes
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; and children. You can take could be
[1:37:46] seduced and deceived by demonic
[1:37:48] temptations. marriages. Some of them in
[1:37:50] deep trouble. Some of it look good that
[1:37:53] aren't good. Sometimes it's not the
[1:37:55] outward veneer. It's what's happening
[1:37:57] inside under the surface.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; And a heart that turns away from the
[1:38:04] truth doesn't look like a heart that
[1:38:06] turns away because the body doesn't turn
[1:38:08] first. The heart does.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; And long before the body leaves, the
[1:38:13] heart leaves. Take people leave the
[1:38:15] message. long before they got up and
[1:38:16] walked out and posted on Facebook their
[1:38:18] freedom,
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; their their their freedom, their heart
[1:38:23] was unsurrendered and had turned away.
[1:38:25] Long before a man or woman walks out of
[1:38:27] a marriage, the heart walks out first.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; And if the heart walks out, it's only a
[1:38:31] matter of time, the body will follow the
[1:38:33] heart.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; But you ever get a heart turned to
[1:38:35] Christ,
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; and the body will follow what the heart
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; goes after.
[1:38:42] and and and never before has there been
[1:38:45] homes that are under such duress,
[1:38:47] stress, pressure of the age that we live
[1:38:50] in than right now. The very foundations
[1:38:52] of what we believe uh and Christianity
[1:38:55] are shaking. It's a just a direct result
[1:38:57] of brother Brandham's seven visions. He
[1:38:59] has the the moral plight, the fourth
[1:39:01] vision of women getting out of their
[1:39:03] place, men getting out of their place.
[1:39:04] Man doesn't know what a man is. Woman
[1:39:06] doesn't know what a woman is.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; And and then it leads from there to
[1:39:09] moral decay. and and you have all of
[1:39:11] those visions coming to pass that the
[1:39:13] whole world is shaking. Friends, I I
[1:39:15] just want to say run to Christ. Run to
[1:39:18] the only thing that's solid. One day
[1:39:22] everything will shake, but there will be
[1:39:24] something that can't be shaken. And I
[1:39:25] want to say let me be in him that can't
[1:39:28] be shaken. A kingdom which can't be
[1:39:30] moved.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Say, brother Matt, that's me. That's
[1:39:34] might be me. Might be a family member.
[1:39:36] Might be a friend. Might be someone I'm
[1:39:38] thinking of. How do we save our home one
[1:39:40] way in Acts 10
[1:39:44] can save your house the same way
[1:39:45] Cornelia saved his in one single day one
[1:39:50] glorious miracle his entire house was
[1:39:54] saved and filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:39:58] one day his situation was transformed
[1:40:01] from spiritual blind this man wasn't a a
[1:40:04] Jewish he wasn't a proelite he was
[1:40:07] didn't have any history.
[1:40:10] And then one day he transformed his home
[1:40:12] from spiritual blindness to light. God
[1:40:14] gave his house. They had a public
[1:40:17] Pentecost in Acts two, but Cornelius was
[1:40:19] going to have a private Pentecost in his
[1:40:22] own home. Amen.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God, the same spirit
[1:40:26] that shook the church in Jerusalem was
[1:40:28] now going to shake Cornelius's home and
[1:40:32] and and opens the door for the Gentiles
[1:40:35] to receive the key that God gave to
[1:40:38] Peter. It was going to be the Gentiles
[1:40:40] entrance into the faith and the joint
[1:40:42] heir of Abraham's seed and Abraham's
[1:40:45] promises. All because one man determined
[1:40:48] in his heart to save his home.
[1:40:53] Can I just close by saying this? There
[1:40:56] are no shortcuts.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; There are no shortcuts to rebuilding
[1:41:00] your altar.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; There's no quick prayer. There's no
[1:41:04] quick fix. People love that. I do, too.
[1:41:08] But there is no quick fix.
[1:41:10] There's a God who can do things quick.
[1:41:15] I can
[1:41:18] I don't have time to even cover that.
[1:41:20] but dealing with a family a family
[1:41:23] longlost family member of mine and
[1:41:25] wanted his life was a wreck from alcohol
[1:41:27] and wanted this solution and my life's
[1:41:29] in chaos and he's crying and crying and
[1:41:31] crying and I said there's only one thing
[1:41:33] you can do and that's surrender your
[1:41:35] life to repent and as soon as I talked
[1:41:37] about repentance oh no I'm good I'm good
[1:41:39] I'm good I'm good yet his life was in
[1:41:42] shambles he wanted a quick fix he wanted
[1:41:43] the preacher to pray for him and it
[1:41:45] would be over you can't do that there's
[1:41:47] no shortcuts you got to come to
[1:41:49] repentance yourself, repair your altar,
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; make a sacrifice unto God. What
[1:41:54] sacrifice? You
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; present your body a living sacrifice,
[1:41:59] which is a your reasonable service.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; People want a quick shortcut. We spend
[1:42:05] as little of people, you know, you can
[1:42:07] get them here and my life's in chaos and
[1:42:08] my life's in distress and you don't owe
[1:42:10] much trouble and I don't feel like
[1:42:12] living. I don't feel like going on and I
[1:42:14] have no I have no, you know, drive and I
[1:42:16] have no motivation and my life's falling
[1:42:18] apart and I'm in so much trouble and and
[1:42:21] we can spend, you know, a whole
[1:42:23] afternoon talking about the trouble. But
[1:42:25] when you talk about how do we fix that?
[1:42:29] How how do we how do we how do we get
[1:42:31] back to the place
[1:42:34] to where there isn't disarray and chaos
[1:42:36] and strife and we don't we don't want
[1:42:39] the answer. We don't spend we want to
[1:42:42] spend as little time as possible weeping
[1:42:45] before the Lord. We don't want to fast
[1:42:49] pray fast and pray. Behold the face of
[1:42:52] the Lord. Cry out to God in desperation.
[1:42:55] No one wants that. Can I just say,
[1:42:58] friends, we're all guilty. We don't
[1:42:59] spend enough time
[1:43:01] before God's word,
[1:43:04] laying our lives down on the altar of
[1:43:05] God's word. We we spend a lot of time
[1:43:07] talking about our trouble. But how much
[1:43:09] time do we spend in prayer?
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Can I get a hearty amen here? We spend
[1:43:13] hours glued to television. You're glued
[1:43:15] to your television. We spend hours glued
[1:43:18] to our phones, hours doing this, hours
[1:43:21] at work, hours at the gym, hours at the
[1:43:23] sports, hours at the recreation, hours
[1:43:26] doing this. But how many hours do we
[1:43:29] spend laying before the Lord?
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Do we care about our altar? Is it in
[1:43:34] disrepair? or is it in disarray?
[1:43:36] Musicians, could you come?
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; We spend so much time on that.
[1:43:44] We go to the Bible. Can I just keep on
[1:43:46] while they're coming?
[1:43:51] Spend so much time in in darkness and
[1:43:53] wonder why our homes are vexed by
[1:43:55] darkness. We go to the Bible just long
[1:43:59] enough. Listen,
[1:44:02] we go to the Bible just long enough to
[1:44:05] pick out a little special promise or
[1:44:07] memory verse or something we can pin
[1:44:08] down. Not against those things. It's
[1:44:10] just a name it and claim it. And it
[1:44:13] doesn't work. It's got to start by
[1:44:17] building an altar.
[1:44:20] It's more than an exercise of faith.
[1:44:22] It's more than a mental word game.
[1:44:25] The life of Cornelius proves that God
[1:44:28] wanted devotion. Listen to what the
[1:44:30] Bible says in Acts 10 of this man,
[1:44:32] certain man in Cesaria called Cornelius,
[1:44:35] a centurion of the band called the
[1:44:38] Italian man, a devout man, one who
[1:44:40] feared God with all of his house, which
[1:44:42] gave much arms to the people, and prayed
[1:44:44] to God always. When I say Cornelius
[1:44:46] prayed always and fasted, he prayed, he
[1:44:49] fasted, he waited on the Lord. Spent
[1:44:52] hours in prayer because why? He wanted
[1:44:55] to save his house.
[1:44:59] He was determined to save his home.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; He was determined not to neglect the
[1:45:05] things. Food became secondary. When you
[1:45:08] fast,
[1:45:12] food is secondary to you. There's one
[1:45:14] thing you want. Save my home, Lord. And
[1:45:16] whatever it takes. How many could bow
[1:45:18] your heads with me? Musicians, could you
[1:45:20] play something?
[1:45:22] Just bow your heads with me here this
[1:45:24] morning.
[1:45:26] Every head bowed, every eye closed.
[1:45:28] Build an altar.
[1:45:34] He was determined.
[1:45:37] Determined.
[1:45:41] He became so desperate
[1:45:45] to the point of neglecting natural food
[1:45:48] so he could seek God. How when's the
[1:45:50] last time you fasted?
[1:45:54] It's biblical.
[1:45:57] Yep. Prophet had a lot to say about it.
[1:45:59] Not preaching on that today.
[1:46:03] But let me just say
[1:46:07] that man should have put us all to
[1:46:08] shame.
[1:46:11] He had no teaching, no tapes, no table,
[1:46:15] no church, no sermons. He didn't have a
[1:46:18] teacher. Wasn't a Jewish proelite. He
[1:46:20] was simply a man who was desperate for
[1:46:22] God to save his house.
[1:46:26] He didn't even have the Holy Ghost yet.
[1:46:32] urging him and pulling on him to pray.
[1:46:35] Yet he fasted and prayed always.
[1:46:42] Let me just say to you, father, mother,
[1:46:46] young person,
[1:46:48] the man that prays, the person that
[1:46:51] prays,
[1:46:53] God
[1:46:54] hears.
[1:46:56] [Music]
[1:46:58] That's the answer. Not a quicky
[1:46:59] solution, not a quick one time, just a
[1:47:03] quick fix, but prayer is the only way to
[1:47:05] save our homes, solve our problems.
[1:47:10] [Music]
[1:47:12] I wonder if there'd be someone here
[1:47:13] under the sound of my voice just as we
[1:47:15] sing and worship the Lord, you maybe
[1:47:18] want to raise a hand, no one looking to
[1:47:20] say, "Lord, I want to repair my altar."
[1:47:24] Oh yes. Hands up everywhere.
[1:47:28] I want to repair it. Lord might be in
[1:47:30] disarray.
[1:47:34] I don't just want a good I love camp. I
[1:47:36] love experiences like that. But Lord, I
[1:47:38] want something that goes beyond that
[1:47:40] echoes beyond a a good weekend of
[1:47:44] services. Something that changes me on
[1:47:47] Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[1:47:49] Friday. A living fire ever burning
[1:47:53] bright with passion, with zeal, with
[1:47:57] worship that comes from the heart, not
[1:47:59] from the music. Oh, could you stand with
[1:48:01] your hands raised and say, "Lord, bring
[1:48:03] me back." Hands up everywhere. Keep them
[1:48:05] up. Bring me back to the heart of
[1:48:07] worship, Lord. When it's all about you.
[1:48:11] It's all about you. Here's my yes, Lord.
[1:48:14] I'm going to give it today. Here's my
[1:48:16] yes.
[1:48:18] Here's the zeal of thine house. I got it
[1:48:20] raised. Zeal of thine house. The temple
[1:48:23] of the Lord is eating me up. I don't
[1:48:26] want an uncsured heart. Here's a fully
[1:48:29] surrendered heart. I'm raising it up
[1:48:31] before you, God, right now. I'm raising
[1:48:33] it up before you, Jesus. A full
[1:48:36] surrender. A full surrendered heart.
[1:48:40] Yes, Lord.
[1:48:43] That's my desire.
[1:48:47] And brother Donnie preached on Sunday
[1:48:48] about proving his word. God will come
[1:48:50] and prove it.
[1:48:52] Bring all
[1:48:55] your needs to
[1:48:58] the altar.
[1:49:01] Raise your hands and sing now. Bring all
[1:49:06] your needs to
[1:49:09] the Lord.
[1:49:15] He is
[1:49:17] so willing
[1:49:20] and able
[1:49:22] to help you. Bring all bring all
[1:49:28] your needs to the Lord.
[1:49:33] Raise it up now. Raise those hands home.
[1:49:37] Bring all
[1:49:39] your needs to
[1:49:42] the altar.
[1:49:45] Oh,
[1:49:48] bring all your needs to
[1:49:53] the Lord.
[1:49:54] [Music]
[1:49:56] Oh,
[1:49:58] oh, he is
[1:50:01] so willing
[1:50:04] and aable
[1:50:07] to help you.
[1:50:09] Oh, bring all your needs to. Oh, that
[1:50:15] sounds beautiful.
[1:50:17] Sing it again now. Oh, bring all your
[1:50:23] needs to the altar.
[1:50:29] Oh yes, Lord.
[1:50:32] Yes, Jesus. Your needs.
[1:50:36] Oh yes, Lord Jesus. I'm bringing them
[1:50:39] now. Oh,
[1:50:42] he is
[1:50:44] so willing,
[1:50:46] so able, able
[1:50:50] to help you.
[1:50:53] Oh, bring all. One more time before we
[1:50:57] go. The Lord,
[1:51:01] if you got a need, just raise it up now.
[1:51:04] Oh, bring all your needs to the altar.
[1:51:12] Oh,
[1:51:15] bring all your needs to
[1:51:20] the Lord.
[1:51:23] [Music]
[1:51:24] For he is so willing
[1:51:30] and able
[1:51:33] to help you
[1:51:36] bring all your needs to the Lord. I'm
[1:51:43] coming back to the heart of worship. Can
[1:51:45] we sing that, brother Ander? Go ahead.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; I would remiss if I did not say
[1:51:52] something at this juncture. Okay.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; So, you know, anytime that you have uh a
[1:51:58] ship uh crossing the ocean, it doesn't
[1:52:02] matter how big the ship is or how fancy
[1:52:04] the boat is.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Or how many passengers are on the ship
[1:52:09] or how many crew members are on the ship
[1:52:11] or how hard the crew members work or are
[1:52:14] dedicated to the ship.
[1:52:17] If you don't have a captain on the ship,
[1:52:21] the ship will never successfully arrive
[1:52:24] at the destination.
[1:52:26] And anytime that you do something on the
[1:52:30] scale um of this youth camp that we
[1:52:33] have, uh if you don't have a captain,
[1:52:38] this would never be possible. And um
[1:52:43] it's the responsibility of that captain
[1:52:46] on that ship. He has all of the weight
[1:52:51] and all of the responsibility of every
[1:52:53] decision that is made on that ship.
[1:52:56] And if anything goes wrong or anything
[1:53:00] happens,
[1:53:02] the captain is responsible for that. And
[1:53:06] he's the one that has to decide when to
[1:53:09] slow down.
[1:53:16] or when to navigate through the storm in
[1:53:20] order to arrive at the other side
[1:53:22] successfully.
[1:53:24] And
[1:53:26] I just I just wonder if we can all give
[1:53:30] a big round of applause to brother Matt
[1:53:33] Watkins for this camp because without
[1:53:36] him none of this would have been
[1:53:39] possible no matter who was had whatever
[1:53:44] they were doing. Brother Matt, thank you
[1:53:46] very much.
[1:54:02] Thank you for that. Amen. They were
[1:54:04] texting me. You forgot about yourself.
[1:54:07] No, I didn't. I'm nobody. I'm just just
[1:54:10] a part of the part of what God's doing.
[1:54:14] Aren't you glad to be part of that?
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you just um sing this
[1:54:18] song with me as we go? Oh, I love this.
[1:54:20] Maybe just one time before we leave,
[1:54:22] then we'll have you be dismissed. When
[1:54:24] the music fades,
[1:54:27] all is stripped away
[1:54:31] and I simply come.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, longing just to bring something
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; that will bless
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; bless your heart.
[1:54:51] I'll bring you more. I'll bring you more
[1:54:55] than a song.
[1:54:57] For a song is
[1:55:01] is not what you have required.
[1:55:06] You search much deeper. You search much
[1:55:09] deeper within. Through the way through
[1:55:13] the way things are. You're looking into
[1:55:18] my heart.
[1:55:23] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[1:55:30] And it's all about you.
[1:55:34] It's all about you, Jesus.
[1:55:38] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I made
[1:55:44] it. When it's all about you. Oh, it's
[1:55:49] all about you. Sing that again. I'm
[1:55:52] coming. I'm coming back to the heart of
[1:55:58] worship.
[1:56:00] Tell him it's all about you. Oh,
[1:56:04] it's all about you, Jesus.
[1:56:08] And I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've
[1:56:13] made it. When it's all about you. Oh,
[1:56:19] it's all about you, Jesus.
[1:56:24] King of endless world.
[1:56:27] [Music]
[1:56:29] No one could express
[1:56:32] how much you deserve.
[1:56:35] [Music]
[1:56:36] Though I'm weak and poor. Oh, though I'm
[1:56:40] weak and full.
[1:56:43] All I have is yours.
[1:56:47] Every single bread.
[1:56:51] I'll bring you more. I'll bring you more
[1:56:55] than a song. Yes, Lord. For a song in
[1:57:00] itself is not what you have required.
[1:57:07] You search my You search much deeper
[1:57:11] within. Oh, through the way things are.
[1:57:16] You're looking into my heart.
[1:57:22] Oh, I'm coming back to the heart of Yes,
[1:57:28] Lord. Oh, where it's all about. Tell him
[1:57:32] that this morning. It's all about you.
[1:57:36] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Lord, for the
[1:57:41] thing I made it. When it's all about
[1:57:47] you. Oh, it's all about I'm coming back
[1:57:52] home.
[1:57:53] I'm coming back to the heart of God
[1:57:58] bless you, friends. You can be
[1:58:00] dismissed. We'll see you Wednesday
[1:58:02] night. Keep our pastor in prayer as you
[1:58:04] go. Oh, I'm sorry.
[1:58:08] I'm sorry, Lord.
[1:58:11] Think I've made it
[1:58:16] all about you.
[1:58:18] [Music]
[1:58:19] All about you, Jesus.
[1:58:23] [Applause]
[1:58:23] [Music]
[1:58:41] Lord of worship.
