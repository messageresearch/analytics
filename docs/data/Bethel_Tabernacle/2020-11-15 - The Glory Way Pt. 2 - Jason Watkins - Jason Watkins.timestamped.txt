[27:05] father we thank you for your word this
[27:07] morning

[27:12] heart lord so i pray that today we're
[27:14] able to
[27:15] express our heart freely and openly to
[27:18] the people
[27:19] lord we realize we're in a perplexing
[27:22] age in a perilous
[27:23] age as the bible called it perilous
[27:26] times
[27:27] and father we know that the word of god
[27:29] has the answer
[27:30] for our lives we know lord that it is
[27:34] the
[27:35] it is the only source that can give us
[27:37] an answer
[27:38] to the to the extremes that we see
[27:42] going on in this day lord the world gr
[27:44] men's heart
[27:45] in in fear failing for fear groping in
[27:48] darkness
[27:50] lord such a fear of the unknown and the
[27:52] things that are coming upon humanity
[27:55] and lord it's a terrible time but yet it
[27:58] yet
[27:58] it's the most glorious time for the
[28:00] light of the gospel that's ever been for
[28:02] you're
[28:03] bringing portions of your word to pass
[28:06] today that have never been brought to
[28:08] pass lord
[28:09] in all the ages and we're seeing
[28:12] prophecy fulfilled
[28:14] in our lives father so we commit
[28:16] ourselves to you that's all we can do
[28:18] that's all i can do
[28:20] i want to just preach from my heart
[28:22] today lord
[28:23] my notes have been over and over and
[28:25] over it's all in my mind it's all in my
[28:27] heart
[28:28] and father we'll follow along but i want
[28:30] to be sensitive to your leadership
[28:32] for you knew who would be here today you
[28:34] knew who would be on the stream lord
[28:36] you knew who would be listening in
[28:38] either live or by archive
[28:40] so i committed now to you commit myself
[28:43] into your hands
[28:44] for service in jesus name amen god bless
[28:47] your friends you can be seated
[29:05] we we finished off last time
[29:08] in the uh with a couple of thoughts
[29:12] and you know i wanted to just maybe
[29:15] touch
[29:16] one or two of them from last weekend
[29:19] we realized that there there are
[29:23] many ways that we can go and live our
[29:25] lives
[29:26] in fact is the bible we reminded you of
[29:28] it last time
[29:30] the bible talks about how that there is
[29:32] a way that seemeth right to a man
[29:34] but it's actually not the right way and
[29:37] that in fact is if you end up going that
[29:39] way which
[29:40] seems right you can actually end up
[29:42] being destroyed think sir
[29:44] you can actually end up in calamity and
[29:47] destruction
[29:48] even all the way in death and so
[29:51] you know the book of jeremiah and i'm
[29:54] going to refer to a number of scriptures
[29:56] today we may not turn and read them all
[29:59] but the book of jeremiah makes a
[30:01] reference how that
[30:03] the way of a man is not within himself
[30:05] he can't find it
[30:07] now do you believe your prophets do you
[30:09] believe your prophets
[30:10] amen then then then hear the word of
[30:13] jeremiah the prophet
[30:14] it is not in you to discover your own
[30:17] way
[30:18] that in fact is the the bible goes on to
[30:20] say in other places
[30:22] that you know that the the heart is
[30:25] is deceitful and it's desperately wicked
[30:29] see that's why you have to be born again
[30:32] and so you have to get a new nature and
[30:35] that new nature
[30:36] comes with new characteristics so that
[30:38] you can
[30:39] live your life the correct way and in
[30:42] fact is
[30:43] it is so powerful it is so
[30:47] the word of god is so powerful
[30:50] that if you will just live your and keep
[30:53] your heart humble before the lord
[30:55] you won't even have to figure anything
[30:57] out god will just lead you
[30:59] the right way and so you know i i see a
[31:02] lot of people many times
[31:04] and you know they we and it's natural
[31:07] and not
[31:07] being critical of it i do it we all do
[31:09] it you you have a situation in your life
[31:12] you want prayer you come up for
[31:13] deliverance maybe you know
[31:15] in the areas of of overcoming and uh you
[31:19] know i've i've came up in prayer lines
[31:21] before
[31:21] wanting more power for overcoming how
[31:23] about you i
[31:24] and not always a prayer line sometimes
[31:26] i've set you know and under the
[31:28] preaching of the word
[31:29] and i came to this conclusion i need
[31:31] more of him
[31:32] and so i i realize when i came here i
[31:34] thought i had enough but
[31:36] now that i'm here and i'm hearing the
[31:38] word i'm realizing wow
[31:40] my my cup isn't full and i need some
[31:42] more from the lord
[31:45] and you know a lot of times we we can
[31:48] from our human side and we can we get
[31:51] the
[31:52] we get the idea that you know i need to
[31:54] come up and ask god
[31:56] you know you know help me with this and
[31:58] help me with that and really
[32:00] most often we can think of individual
[32:02] things
[32:03] and even if we're not confessing it to
[32:05] the preacher because this is not a
[32:06] confessional booth
[32:08] but you're you're saying you know i want
[32:10] to have more of a coming power you're
[32:11] thinking of something
[32:13] you're thinking maybe of a couple things
[32:15] that you need to
[32:16] you need some overcoming strength on you
[32:18] know one of the pieces of advice that i
[32:20] always give somebody whether it's
[32:21] here at the altar for prayer or whether
[32:24] it's in my office in counseling or on
[32:26] the phone
[32:27] and i say listen brother you know don't
[32:29] don't get the cart
[32:30] or sister don't get the card ahead of
[32:32] the horse because
[32:33] the bible promises in the holy spirit
[32:36] that you will have an overcoming power
[32:38] that's one of one of the things the holy
[32:40] ghost has given for
[32:42] amen so rather than rather than
[32:46] burning fuel as it were
[32:49] using up your energy sources trying to
[32:53] figure out how you can be an overcomer
[32:56] over this
[32:57] or over that why don't you burn all your
[32:59] fuel getting close to god
[33:02] and just purpose in your heart to say
[33:04] i'm just going to get more humble
[33:06] i'm going to pray more and i'm going to
[33:08] seek him more and i'm and i'm going to
[33:10] try to draw closer to him because if you
[33:12] do that
[33:13] i'm here to tell you something friends
[33:14] that gene of god
[33:16] that is down inside you when the
[33:18] anointing begins to fall on it and this
[33:21] word not just any word but when the full
[33:23] word
[33:24] falls in this age of the full day on a
[33:27] people who are to be the full believer
[33:30] who are actually here by designed to
[33:32] take a body change
[33:34] i'm here to tell you there's an
[33:35] anointing falling on this word that is
[33:37] sufficient
[33:38] to give you overcoming power today
[33:41] tomorrow next week i don't care what
[33:44] you've stumbled at
[33:45] it has the power to set you over the top
[33:51] it has the power to put you on a ledge
[33:54] on this mountain we're all climbing
[33:56] we're climbing mount zion
[33:58] amen and i'm here to tell you this
[34:01] anointing has a power to set you on a
[34:03] ledge you haven't been at before and not
[34:06] just
[34:06] set you there and leave you there but
[34:08] set you there and then take you to the
[34:09] next one and take you to the next one
[34:11] and take you to the next one
[34:12] i want to go to the next one
[34:16] i live to overcome i'm a christian it's
[34:19] my whole desire it's my everyday focus
[34:22] to not slip backwards but to press
[34:25] forward
[34:26] and that was paul's instruction that we
[34:29] press toward
[34:31] a higher calling
[34:34] there are so many ways and so many
[34:36] things that can influence our lives
[34:40] and there is nothing that is better
[34:43] to influence your lives than the word of
[34:47] god and god
[34:48] has by design
[34:51] placed you here to
[34:55] obtain glory amen
[34:58] by bringing him glory amen
[35:02] amen say it again god's not here to make
[35:04] you the most popular person in the world
[35:07] amen god's not here for the world to
[35:10] applaud
[35:11] when you step out on the street god's
[35:14] not god didn't put you here for that
[35:16] god put you here so that people will
[35:19] think about god
[35:21] god put you here as a beacon as a lower
[35:24] light as we've said before along the
[35:25] harbor they have the lighthouse on the
[35:27] hill
[35:28] but they also have lower lights along
[35:29] the harbor entrance because the
[35:31] lighthouse alone won't lead them into
[35:32] the harbor they'll crash
[35:34] so you have to have the lower lights
[35:36] burning if it's a tricky harbor
[35:38] especially
[35:39] and so so we find that that this
[35:42] is god's purpose for our lives it was
[35:44] astounding to me
[35:46] and there was so many different places
[35:48] that i that i could have read from but i
[35:51] i just i narrowed my search just to
[35:54] strictly the book of revelation because
[35:56] that's our book
[35:58] amen amen that's our book
[36:01] that's the bride's book for the end time
[36:03] it was written after paul was gone
[36:05] you know paul doesn't ever quote from
[36:06] the book of revelation because it was
[36:07] brought
[36:08] remember in our sunday school teaching
[36:10] john was trying to put all the bible
[36:12] together and god allows him to get
[36:13] arrested
[36:14] because god wanted the book of
[36:15] revelation put in there and all down
[36:17] through the ages it stayed in symbolism
[36:19] and things were not unlocked to the
[36:21] people
[36:22] but it was promised at the end time it
[36:24] would be made known
[36:26] because john was caught up to the lord's
[36:28] day said i was in the spirit on the
[36:29] lord's day that's this day that's the
[36:31] end time
[36:32] that's the time when we go home
[36:35] but before we go home we have a mission
[36:37] we have a job here
[36:39] and i'm here to tell you that's to get
[36:40] glory by bringing him glory
[36:44] and so i my message to you today is the
[36:46] glory way
[36:49] so what is the glory way
[36:53] it's whatever way that you need to live
[36:56] that brings him glory amen
[36:59] it astonished me i i really
[37:03] was caught off guard by how many
[37:05] references
[37:06] from the very first chapter of the book
[37:08] of revelation all the way nearly to the
[37:10] very end of the book
[37:12] you find that you know and i'm not i'm
[37:15] just going to i'm just going to just hit
[37:16] them quickly and not you don't even need
[37:17] to try to keep up with josh because i'm
[37:19] just going to go fast
[37:20] but we find in the in the first chapter
[37:23] of revelation
[37:24] to him be glory and dominion forever and
[37:27] ever
[37:27] the fourth chapter and when the beat and
[37:30] when those beasts
[37:31] give glory and honor and thanks to him
[37:33] that set on the throne who liveth
[37:35] forever and ever
[37:36] further on in the fourth chapter thou
[37:37] art worthy o lord
[37:39] to receive glory and honor for thou has
[37:41] created all things and for thy pleasure
[37:44] they are and were created so
[37:47] it's so our whole life is for his glory
[37:50] amen listen friends you know i i
[37:53] remember one time in um
[37:56] oh where was i at i was in uh
[38:00] i was in the ukraine and brother eugene
[38:03] was with me we were
[38:04] we had went to a a store because in the
[38:07] camp they had no telephones or internet
[38:09] and so
[38:10] we went to a place it was a place of
[38:12] business i i think they
[38:13] they printed flyers and business cards
[38:15] and things like that print shop
[38:17] and they had uh internet connection
[38:19] where we could
[38:20] you know uh text home and say how are
[38:22] you we're here we're good we're safe
[38:24] and there was a young woman sitting
[38:26] there and you know she
[38:28] we had been in there before and finally
[38:30] after about the third time
[38:32] you know we come in and she's she's all
[38:35] bubbly
[38:35] and all happy and she's almost a little
[38:38] bit giddy and almost silly and she's
[38:40] probably 18 19 years old
[38:42] and uh and i just thought wow you know
[38:43] somebody's in a good mood
[38:45] but then in a little bit she began
[38:48] we began to discover and she had been
[38:51] out the night before and
[38:52] she had been drinking and dancing and
[38:54] had met a boy and all these things
[38:56] and she's almost bragging here we are
[38:57] preachers and she knows we are
[39:01] and she's bragging about had me a good
[39:04] night last night in her best broken
[39:05] english
[39:06] and oh i said a good night is everything
[39:09] fine oh yes you know my friends and
[39:11] drinking and dancing
[39:12] and i'm so happy for today and she even
[39:14] stands up you know and tries to
[39:16] imitate a little jig that she had did
[39:18] the night before
[39:20] and i and i just thought wow how sad
[39:24] i felt like brother brandon when he was
[39:25] in that hallway you remember
[39:27] and those women were coming down one of
[39:29] them a sunday school teacher
[39:30] and they've got a you know whiskey in
[39:32] one hand and they're half dressed and
[39:33] they're kicking up their leg
[39:34] whoopee this is life and brother brandon
[39:36] said i tried to stay out of it he said
[39:37] but that was just more than i could take
[39:39] and he said i stepped out and said just
[39:41] a minute sister he said that's not life
[39:43] that's
[39:44] death see and and even he said she tried
[39:48] to pull away but he held on tight
[39:50] you remember brother branham when they
[39:51] had the company dance remember that
[39:54] and uh they said billy we're gonna we
[39:56] you know we know you're really a
[39:58] straight and shooter and you're a

[40:07] know we're gonna have some good clean
[40:08] fun so brother branham goes
[40:10] and he walks in and here's a band
[40:12] playing all their rock and roll music
[40:14] and all these people out on the floor
[40:16] dancing and brother branham just
[40:17] standing there looking
[40:18] just a young man young christian and you
[40:21] know how the devil is
[40:23] and the devil gets a hold of the young
[40:25] woman he said a young woman out there on
[40:27] the floor

[40:30] said she saw him and here she come
[40:32] and she run and got him by the hand said
[40:34] you want to dance
[40:35] he said i sure do and she let him out
[40:39] onto the floor
[40:40] and he said now before i do anything let
[40:43] me stop the band just a minute
[40:45] before i do anything he said i always
[40:47] like to pray
[40:48] and ask the lord's blessing and he said
[40:50] she he said now if you all just get down
[40:52] on your knees and he went down to his
[40:53] knees and she tried to pull away and he
[40:55] grabbed her and pulled her down on her
[40:56] knees
[40:57] and he said lord you know we love you
[40:59] and he went on to his prayer
[41:01] and while he's praying the band started
[41:02] closing up their instruments started
[41:04] wrapping everything up everybody started
[41:05] leaving putting their drinks in the
[41:07] trash can
[41:08] i'm here to tell you something friends

[42:54] and you ought to be thankful that you
[42:56] have preachers standing
[42:58] here giving you the the true gospel let
[43:00] me tell you something friends
[43:02] our lives have a purpose for being here
[43:06] and you might accomplish a lot of things
[43:09] in your life that might be
[43:10] rather spectacular you might soar in the
[43:13] fields of education and career
[43:16] you might you might you know become a
[43:18] very world
[43:19] renowned person nothing not saying
[43:21] nothing against that
[43:22] do all you can be somebody good be
[43:25] somebody the world can
[43:26] can can appreciate but understand this

[43:36] hear me no matter what station you ever
[43:39] achieved to with if if it's not christ
[43:42] guiding your life your life equals zero
[43:48] you get a big fat zero
[43:52] your life is worthless unless it's
[43:54] bringing god glory
[43:57] your life has no meaning or purpose
[43:59] unless you're in a glory road
[44:01] that's giving god glory he goes on to
[44:05] say in the fifth chapter
[44:06] he heard john heard a bunch of people
[44:09] you know he heard angels is who it was
[44:11] and angels around the throne saying and
[44:13] i love this
[44:14] they were saying with a loud voice
[44:17] they were saying with a loud voice
[44:19] worthy is the lamb that was slain to
[44:21] receive
[44:22] power and riches and wisdom and strength
[44:23] and honor and glory and blessing
[44:25] and when those angels got going john got
[44:27] excited
[44:28] and then the bible says in 513 and every
[44:31] creature
[44:31] which is in heaven and on earth and
[44:33] under the earth and such as in the sea
[44:35] and all that are in them heard eyes
[44:37] saying blessing and honor and glory and
[44:39] power
[44:40] and then when john got excited then the
[44:42] four and 20 elders got excited and they
[44:44] fell down on their knees and
[44:45] said glory to god and praise the lord
[44:48] i'm here to tell you something friends
[44:49] start
[44:50] praising god it's contagious
[44:53] it'll move to somebody else and somebody
[44:55] else and before you know it
[44:56] we'll all have our hands up in the air
[44:58] saying worthy is the lamb praise our god
[45:01] and then god receives glory
[45:04] let them hear it on the streets on our
[45:06] outdoor speakers
[45:07] god deserves glory give him the praises
[45:11] that his name is due
[45:15] he goes on chapter 7 saying blessing and
[45:18] glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and
[45:20] honor chapter 11
[45:22] the same hour there's a great earthquake
[45:23] in the 10th part of the city fell
[45:25] and in the earthquake were slain of men
[45:27] 7 000 and the remnant were afraid and
[45:29] gave glory to god
[45:32] in the midst of calamity amen
[45:35] see gave glory to god
[45:40] chapter 14 saying with a loud voice fear
[45:43] god
[45:44] and give glory to him for the hour of
[45:46] his judgment is come
[45:48] and worship him that made heaven and
[45:50] earth in the sea
[45:51] chapter 15 and the temple was filled
[45:54] with smoke from the glory of god and
[45:56] from his power
[45:58] no man was able to enter the temple
[46:00] verse chapter 16
[46:02] and and and these are men in chapter 16
[46:05] who were scorched with the heat of the
[46:07] judgments
[46:08] and the bible makes it a tragedy
[46:11] this verse is a tragedy because in all
[46:14] of their suffering they gave
[46:15] not god the glory see the only one who
[46:19] could help them i get astounded every
[46:21] time i read that in the bible
[46:23] that here are people suffering in the
[46:25] tribulation
[46:26] and they the only one who can help him
[46:29] they're cursing him
[46:32] what madness is this so
[46:35] chapter 18 he says and after these
[46:39] things i saw another angel coming down
[46:41] from heaven having great power
[46:43] and the earth was lighted with his glory
[46:46] chapter 19
[46:47] and after these things i heard a great
[46:49] voice of much people in heaven saying
[46:51] alleluia
[46:52] salvation and glory and honor
[46:55] and power unto the lord god
[46:59] and then it goes to chapter 21.
[47:02] now watch it's come all the way through
[47:03] the bible remember the book of
[47:04] revelation
[47:05] is the book of our day it's the bride's
[47:07] book of this day
[47:09] a lot of it's been fulfilled since the
[47:10] time of the apostles i get that i'm not
[47:12] saying
[47:13] it only covers the history of our day
[47:15] but it's it's
[47:16] its primary purpose was so that the
[47:19] bride at the last time saw a prophet
[47:20] would have context
[47:22] and be able to to qualify to you
[47:25] what you see going on and and be able to
[47:28] explain modern events and make them
[47:30] clear to you through prophecy
[47:31] [Music]
[47:32] to have an authority a prophet has no
[47:35] authority outside of the word if he's a
[47:36] real prophet
[47:38] and so so that a prophet of this day
[47:40] would have authority to stand on
[47:42] god gives the church the book of
[47:43] revelation
[47:45] and so we find then that he could
[47:47] identify he could say
[47:48] here's a strong angel here's a mighty
[47:51] one here's this one here's that one
[47:53] here's john
[47:53] represents this represents that a a
[47:56] strong angel
[47:57] rising up out of the east with the seal
[47:59] of the living god and all of these
[48:00] things a prophet was able to establish
[48:02] what we believe
[48:03] from the bible i'm glad amen
[48:07] i'm glad because if i if i knew
[48:11] that my whole life was purpose to bring
[48:13] him glory then i would want an
[48:15] authoritative word
[48:17] that could accomplish it i wouldn't have
[48:20] any confidence because the stakes are
[48:22] too high
[48:23] because if i know my only purpose being
[48:25] here is to give him glory
[48:26] then nothing in life should equal that
[48:29] then if it's that important i need to
[48:31] make sure i've got the right path i need
[48:33] to know i'm in the glory way
[48:37] that's why i'm thankful for a message
[48:38] that's why i'm thankful for a prophet
[48:40] that's why i'm thankful he established
[48:42] it on the word of god
[48:44] incontrovertibly unassailable this
[48:46] message
[48:47] in the bible is unassailable you cannot
[48:49] resist it
[48:50] unless your steep stooped and willful
[48:52] blindness
[48:54] because god has made it so plain and not
[48:56] only has he made the interpretation
[48:58] plain
[48:59] it made the manifestation plain and we
[49:01] have it and we see it and we know it
[49:04] so he says chapter 21
[49:08] i love this now watch
[49:12] so he says and there came unto me one of
[49:14] the seven angels had the seven vials
[49:16] full of the seven last plagues and
[49:17] talked with me saying come hither i will
[49:18] show thee the bride
[49:20] the lamb's wife and he carried me away
[49:24] in the spirit to a great and high
[49:25] mountain and showed me that great city
[49:29] so he's going to show him the bride but
[49:31] now he's going to show him the
[49:31] representation of the bride because the
[49:33] bride is a people
[49:35] you understand and the city is built to
[49:38] reflect the character
[49:39] of god's glory that his word put in her
[49:43] that's why when he says he says the city
[49:47] having the glory of god and her
[49:50] her light was likened to a stone most
[49:53] precious even a jasper stone clears
[49:54] crystal
[49:55] and so the city itself is
[49:58] is is crowned with regal beauty
[50:02] and precious stones and everything in
[50:04] its place
[50:05] and that city is a testament to the
[50:08] world
[50:09] when they approach it because they're
[50:11] going to bring their honor
[50:13] into that city and before they ever see
[50:16] the bride
[50:16] set it seated by him on the throne they
[50:19] will see
[50:20] the beauty of what god could produce in
[50:23] a people
[50:24] and when they get inside the city having
[50:26] seen the city
[50:28] and see the bride they'll go oh yeah
[50:31] she matches no wonder she's seated on
[50:33] that throne
[50:34] i'm here to tell you something friends
[50:36] that's what this message has come to do
[50:38] it's come to put you in a glory way so
[50:40] that your life becomes glory
[50:42] which brings him glory and the whole
[50:44] city is glory
[50:46] hallelujah that's what the whole 21st
[50:50] chapter and in fact is every every
[50:53] remaining
[50:54] every remaining mention of glory is
[50:57] about this city
[50:58] [Music]
[51:01] 2123 and the city had no need of the sun
[51:04] neither of the moon to shine in it
[51:06] for the glory of god did lighten it and
[51:09] the lamb
[51:11] is the light thereof 24 and the nations
[51:13] of them which are saved
[51:15] shall walk in the light of it and the
[51:17] kings of the earth
[51:18] to bring their glory and honor into it
[51:21] verse 26
[51:22] and they shall bring the glory and honor
[51:25] of the nations into it
[51:27] your life here has that purpose behind
[51:30] it
[51:31] amen and there should not be anything
[51:36] allowed in our lives there should not be
[51:40] anything allowed in our lives
[51:44] that dim the glory of god
[51:47] to the world see
[51:51] amen now don't be all shouting with me
[51:54] on the first part and start getting
[51:55] quiet
[51:56] amen come on if we're gonna if we're
[51:59] gonna
[51:59] if we're gonna you know the w in the
[52:02] shepherds
[52:03] in the east they're in the middle east
[52:06] when they
[52:06] are have sheep and a lot of times when
[52:09] the
[52:10] the the little lamb is sick and they
[52:13] have a limestone that'll bring healing
[52:15] but you can't get the lamb to lick the
[52:17] limestone because it tastes horrible
[52:19] see what he does he reaches in his bag
[52:21] and he pulls out some honey
[52:22] and he smears it all over the limestone
[52:25] and the lamb starts licking like crazy
[52:28] on the honey and what happens as he
[52:30] starts breaking into the line and numbs
[52:32] his tongue and all he remembers is the
[52:34] sweet and he just keeps eating
[52:35] and he eats the heats the lion eats the
[52:37] limestone you know the limestone gets
[52:39] into his body and starts having its
[52:41] healing
[52:42] effect so hey there's honey in the rock
[52:46] amen amen and and so
[52:49] just remember friends that that is i
[52:52] think that
[52:53] that that's such the purpose that we're
[52:56] here for
[52:59] and i was thinking about brother jd's
[53:01] sunday school class this morning i
[53:02] thought wow
[53:04] i almost need to give him the first half
[53:06] an hour of my sermon
[53:08] time to just re-preach it now that we
[53:10] got a church full of people
[53:11] i hope if you weren't here you were at
[53:13] least streaming goodness
[53:14] because of all the of all the topics
[53:18] he's preaching about the character and
[53:20] the characteristics of god
[53:21] and he's been on love and working on
[53:23] divine love and agape love and feeling
[53:24] love and
[53:25] just astonishing you know i was thinking
[53:27] about this morning
[53:29] and you know you know just faith i was
[53:32] thinking about you
[53:33] and your career path that you said to me
[53:36] and you know i thought i'm going to say
[53:37] to sister faith
[53:38] when you and because i told her that's
[53:40] awesome that she wants to be a servant
[53:42] help humanity she has a career path to
[53:45] as a counselor and psychology and crisis
[53:48] intervention
[53:49] and these kinds of things i said faith
[53:50] that is amazing that that that could be
[53:52] a gift of god for suffering humanity
[53:54] that's why god said he that's why
[53:56] brother um said god gave us doctors
[53:58] see it's a mercy of god for suffering
[54:00] humanity and i thought to myself when i
[54:02] say i'm gonna tell her sister faith
[54:04] you'll never be able to help anybody
[54:05] unless you can learn the characteristics
[54:08] of god
[54:09] learn the principles of god and counsel
[54:11] them in that that'll give them more help
[54:14] than any other thing if you want to help
[54:16] somebody give them the characteristics
[54:18] of god
[54:19] teach them the ways of almighty god
[54:23] because he's more than history man
[54:27] he's much more than history there
[54:29] there's his acts but there's also his
[54:31] ways
[54:32] and so we find then that you know we
[54:35] want to be glad
[54:37] we want to rejoice in the lord
[54:40] you know when we when we look out here
[54:43] today and
[54:44] again i i have to always quickly
[54:48] set your mind at ease i'm not here to
[54:49] preach on politics i hate that stuff
[54:51] anyway but but it's so pervasive it's
[54:54] just like
[54:55] front and center in our face and and i'm
[54:57] not talking about who
[54:59] who can get in the office i'm talking
[55:01] about the
[55:02] the social political fabric
[55:05] the the the ways of the world and the
[55:08] way
[55:09] i mean here we you know people that
[55:12] maybe look like sensible people
[55:16] and you'd say you know they're crazy
[55:19] they're in the streets and they're
[55:20] writing and they're
[55:21] burning and and then you know they're
[55:24] fighting and they're attacking and
[55:26] and you you even even both sides are now
[55:29] saying i've
[55:29] i've even read to their credit some
[55:32] liberal commentators going
[55:34] are we nuts y'all come on everybody are
[55:36] we crazy
[55:38] you know no wonder no wonder there was a
[55:41] red wave that nearly
[55:42] we lost congress over no wonder we
[55:43] barely beat that president if they did
[55:45] in fact
[55:46] because even they know they're crazy
[55:49] amen
[55:50] and i'm talking about one of their
[55:52] leading leading
[55:53] one of their leading voices has said we
[55:56] could have easily won all this if we
[55:58] weren't so
[55:58] nuts and said you people out here doing
[56:01] things that don't even make sense he
[56:03] said come on friends
[56:05] it don't even make common sense what
[56:06] you're doing no wonder
[56:08] there was such a a red wave and he and
[56:11] he's right because people
[56:13] you know that's why i've always said you
[56:15] can tell when an evil spirit's anointing
[56:17] you you know why
[56:18] because you'll do things that don't make
[56:19] sense
[56:21] you do things don't make sense i
[56:24] remember speaking to a man who used to
[56:26] be in the message used to preach this
[56:27] message right from this pulpit
[56:29] and then he's on youtube making every
[56:31] kind of horrible
[56:32] video about the message and brother
[56:34] branham and the people that follow it
[56:35] and all this kind of
[56:36] and i finally said to him one day i said
[56:38] you know you've got an evil spirit
[56:40] he said you think so and i said no i'm
[56:42] saying you're evident that you do
[56:44] i said because an evil spirit will make
[56:46] you do things that don't make sense it
[56:47] don't even add up it's not common sense
[56:49] not even common sense
[56:51] and uh we weren't you know angry i was
[56:54] just just trying to help him
[56:56] and i said listen friend because i still
[56:57] consider him a friend
[56:59] i said you know
[57:02] i said here you are on the internet
[57:05] attacking a man who you know was a
[57:09] godly sanctified man who lived a
[57:12] life of purity and all of his peers said
[57:14] that and even his enemies said that
[57:15] even people who disagreed with his
[57:17] doctrine said he was a very
[57:19] humble sincere man of god and even they
[57:22] had him but the government tried they
[57:24] couldn't find
[57:24] any kind of thing against him and i said
[57:27] and further you know
[57:28] that it produces people who live decent
[57:30] and holy and godly
[57:32] and we teach our children the right
[57:33] things and we make makes good citizens
[57:35] out of us and
[57:36] and we're honest people and you're on
[57:39] there attacking it
[57:40] and you know what it produces and so
[57:43] that's
[57:44] that's crazy that you would do that
[57:47] and i said moreover you know by teaching
[57:51] of the bible you know that the real
[57:53] threat to this
[57:54] world is rome amen
[57:57] and i don't see you spending one minute
[57:59] on youtube
[58:00] telling the world about the real
[58:01] antichrist or telling them about
[58:04] the errors of jehovah's witness or or
[58:06] mormonism all i
[58:07] see you is on the air uh trouncing
[58:09] something you actually know is good
[58:11] and leaving off the things that you know
[58:12] is really killing the world and call
[58:14] yourself a preacher i said you're full
[58:15] of the devil
[58:16] because you're doing something that
[58:17] doesn't even make common sense
[58:20] [Music]
[58:21] that's that's stupid i'm sorry little
[58:24] kids
[58:24] i didn't mean but jason didn't mean to
[58:26] say that amen
[58:28] i apologize to moms amen so
[58:32] but that's crazy okay
[58:35] i'm sorry that slipped out but
[58:39] but it didn't make any it didn't make
[58:41] any sense then doesn't make any sense
[58:42] now
[58:44] and you know you remember brother
[58:45] branham talked about the craziness in
[58:47] the world he didn't call it juvenile
[58:48] delinquency all the world does
[58:51] brother bram never called it that he
[58:53] said it's all parental delinquency
[58:56] and and and you know what you see now
[58:58] you see say well they're grown-ups in
[58:59] the street out there well they were
[59:01] children once but the age
[59:03] their parents that brother branham was
[59:05] preaching to
[59:06] didn't listen the age that brother
[59:09] brennan was preaching to
[59:10] stayed with her with their little social
[59:13] parties and they didn't take the word of
[59:14] god and now what you're seeing is
[59:16] grown-ups back in the streets acting
[59:20] crazy
[59:20] because of the previous generation you
[59:22] remember brother graham said it just
[59:23] gets worse every generation you start
[59:25] out
[59:25] with a chorus girl and you go you know
[59:28] in the early 20s and then from there you
[59:29] go to flappers in the 30s and then from
[59:31] there
[59:32] you know the the fact the nation the
[59:34] motherhood of uh backbone of mother of
[59:36] the nation was broken
[59:37] women going to work after the world wars
[59:40] and and and he said and then you you get
[59:42] a striptease and he said what will the
[59:44] next generation be
[59:46] well now we know the answer
[59:49] we know the answer to that question
[59:50] brother brown didn't stay around long
[59:52] enough to see it we've seen it
[59:54] we see madness on in the streets we see
[59:56] madness everywhere even good people
[59:58] acting crazy
[59:59] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:00:01] this age has become so dark but
[1:00:03] but at the same time the word has become
[1:00:06] so bright
[1:00:07] and you need not eat off the poi i'm so
[1:00:10] glad that you're not starving
[1:00:11] and have to eat out of a garbage can or
[1:00:13] eat toxins or poisons just to stay alive
[1:00:16] you have the pure
[1:00:17] seven course meal you have the purity of
[1:00:19] the word
[1:00:20] thank god thank god i have answers for
[1:00:23] you
[1:00:23] thank god parents have answers for their
[1:00:26] children amen
[1:00:29] you know it's it's it's incredible the
[1:00:31] age that we live in and the way that
[1:00:32] people
[1:00:33] uh don't care about their children and
[1:00:37] and you know put them on every kind of
[1:00:39] talent show and ruin them and
[1:00:41] push them into education never touch
[1:00:43] never teaching them about god never
[1:00:44] teach them about the holy ghost
[1:00:46] you know and and i'm i'm not of course
[1:00:49] sadly that ain't just in the world
[1:00:52] [Music]
[1:00:53] sadly there's there's good and i call
[1:00:56] them good
[1:00:56] very they're believers but they sure
[1:01:00] have got their vision clouded on what
[1:01:02] they push their kids into
[1:01:04] and i'm not at all against pushing your
[1:01:06] kids into what'll make them successful
[1:01:08] but how about you get them how about you
[1:01:10] push them with all your might to the
[1:01:11] holy ghost first
[1:01:13] how about you do that which will secure
[1:01:15] them eternally then work about
[1:01:17] then work on their life naturally
[1:01:19] instead of the other way around
[1:01:21] come on you know
[1:01:24] it's just sad that people don't seem to
[1:01:26] care sufficiently
[1:01:28] in a time you know when our children
[1:01:30] live in the most perverse
[1:01:32] day of human history how is it that the
[1:01:35] parents
[1:01:36] sometimes aren't fighting with all their
[1:01:38] might you know providing every
[1:01:40] opportunity they can even inventing
[1:01:42] opportunities
[1:01:44] to get their kids to church or to
[1:01:46] meetings or to fellowship
[1:01:48] do everything you can i'm talking about
[1:01:50] going to the wall and back
[1:01:53] you know we don't wait a lot of times
[1:01:54] you don't have any problem pushing them
[1:01:56] to a
[1:01:56] a nice education perfectly fine nothing
[1:01:59] to say evil about it
[1:02:00] you know i i'm glad that we've got
[1:02:02] people who have an education i
[1:02:04] and i believe that on a certain level of
[1:02:06] that it minimally
[1:02:08] you know because you you you're going to
[1:02:10] need to be able to teach your children
[1:02:11] hey we live in a modern world that's the
[1:02:13] world we live in
[1:02:15] so i'm not against career and education
[1:02:17] and
[1:02:18] achievement wonderful wonderful
[1:02:20] wonderful
[1:02:21] but but how do the priorities get so
[1:02:23] twisted
[1:02:25] to where either and i don't know which
[1:02:26] one is worse
[1:02:28] to where either sometimes parents who
[1:02:30] have gotten
[1:02:31] sideways in their in their priorities
[1:02:34] push their children toward education and
[1:02:36] achievement
[1:02:37] but there doesn't seem to be hardly any
[1:02:39] effort to get them filled with the holy
[1:02:40] ghost
[1:02:41] [Music]
[1:02:43] amen amen amen
[1:02:47] me just let me lower my presentation
[1:02:50] down
[1:02:51] just so you know i'm not attacking just
[1:02:53] speaking from my heart
[1:02:56] parents today here and on the internet
[1:02:59] whoever might hear this on an archive
[1:03:02] you should be going to the wall and back
[1:03:04] to get them full of the holy ghost
[1:03:07] get their eternal destination they're
[1:03:09] calling an election sure
[1:03:11] set the right kind of example then
[1:03:13] whatever god can open doors ahead of
[1:03:15] them
[1:03:16] then then help them find wonderful you
[1:03:19] know and
[1:03:19] and and it's and it's really distressing
[1:03:22] to see
[1:03:22] or sometimes and i don't even know if
[1:03:25] maybe this might be worse
[1:03:26] i don't know i'm telling you i don't
[1:03:28] know it might be worse
[1:03:30] uh where you just have a an indifference
[1:03:34] to
[1:03:34] whatever i don't even care and i'm
[1:03:38] we're just getting through life well i'm
[1:03:39] not i'm not trying to push them out
[1:03:40] there well you're also not trying to get
[1:03:42] them filled with the holy ghost you're
[1:03:44] just kind of indifferent to it all
[1:03:46] and and and i know this indifference is
[1:03:49] a worse enemy
[1:03:50] lukewarmness is a worse enemy than
[1:03:53] coldness
[1:03:55] because at least if you're cold you know
[1:03:56] where you stand and you know you need
[1:03:58] god if you're lukewarm and you just
[1:03:59] don't care
[1:04:00] i i remember i've told this story before
[1:04:02] i'm sure you've heard it
[1:04:03] but you know i had a sister come to me
[1:04:05] very distressed because she's trying to
[1:04:06] witness to her mother and mother gets so
[1:04:07] mad
[1:04:08] she tried to witness her out of the
[1:04:09] bible out of the message of the hour and
[1:04:10] her mother was i think a moss back
[1:04:12] baptist and she would just get so
[1:04:13] flaming mad
[1:04:14] and i said wonderful sister that's
[1:04:15] second best reaction she could have
[1:04:18] she looked at me like what i said sure
[1:04:21] she said what's worse i said
[1:04:23] indifference
[1:04:25] believe me it's much worse if she just
[1:04:27] says to you oh that's nice honey well
[1:04:28] anyway what were we talking about
[1:04:30] and it just it just passes her right by
[1:04:33] and she don't have any reaction at all
[1:04:34] that's that's when you're in a bad spot
[1:04:36] friends when you don't even care
[1:04:39] about right and wrong you don't care
[1:04:41] about the right path the wrong path the
[1:04:43] best path the not best the upside down
[1:04:45] the inside out
[1:04:46] you don't care about enough about your
[1:04:48] priorities to set them straight come on
[1:04:50] friends
[1:04:52] and and that that's a worse i said at
[1:04:54] least she had a reaction
[1:04:56] at least she cares about something
[1:04:58] brother brandon said i'd rather see a
[1:04:59] man stand even if he's wrong
[1:05:01] see him stand on a principle just so
[1:05:03] that he won't fall for anything
[1:05:05] see so you know this is the day to have
[1:05:08] some grit
[1:05:09] this is the day to care this is the data
[1:05:12] try to make a difference say i i can't
[1:05:14] give them the holy ghost you can't but
[1:05:16] your job
[1:05:17] as a parent is to provide them with
[1:05:19] every opportunity
[1:05:20] and then some and go to the wall and
[1:05:24] back find it like you're fighting a fire
[1:05:26] i mean
[1:05:26] go all out whatever you have to do spare
[1:05:30] no expense
[1:05:32] spare no expense if you want to do
[1:05:34] things that are crazy do
[1:05:36] that
[1:05:39] spare new expense you talk about crazy i
[1:05:43] think back on it now and i go i must
[1:05:44] have been nuts
[1:05:46] hand the keys to the family vehicle we
[1:05:48] only had one
[1:05:50] hand it over to my teenage boys because
[1:05:52] they want to go three states over to a
[1:05:54] christian youth banquet
[1:05:56] and i'm like here's the keys
[1:05:59] and people go you let them take your
[1:06:00] vehicle you know i got my work truck
[1:06:03] outside
[1:06:04] but you know what you know why i did
[1:06:05] that because i knew
[1:06:07] i have to i have to do everything i can
[1:06:09] and i have to invent things to do
[1:06:11] i have to create opportunities i gotta i
[1:06:14] can't rest day or night my
[1:06:16] job as a parent is to see them secured
[1:06:19] in their faith i couldn't give them the
[1:06:22] holy ghost but it was my
[1:06:23] job to provide everything in their life
[1:06:26] and in their schedule and set a right
[1:06:29] example
[1:06:30] i want to tell you something friends i
[1:06:31] don't think that my children got raised
[1:06:33] up i think if you'd ask any one of my
[1:06:35] boys
[1:06:35] they would not have the idea that my
[1:06:38] priorities that i didn't care about
[1:06:40] spirituality or that i didn't care about
[1:06:42] my church schedule i didn't care about
[1:06:44] the friends they had i cared about
[1:06:46] all of that stuff and i put my hand on
[1:06:49] and controlled it and intervened because
[1:06:51] why
[1:06:52] i couldn't save them but i wanted to
[1:06:53] give them every possible
[1:06:55] every single idea that i could come up
[1:06:58] with
[1:07:01] i think i made the right choice
[1:07:04] oh let me move on y'all going to go into
[1:07:06] vapor lock on me
[1:07:09] but it's true friends you know we get
[1:07:12] very concerned with better
[1:07:14] homes and better cars and you know
[1:07:18] which wind and rain can take away like
[1:07:20] that
[1:07:22] and jesus said why would you build your
[1:07:24] life on sand
[1:07:26] when the storms of life and they come
[1:07:29] oh they're coming you can best believe
[1:07:32] that they're coming
[1:07:33] so jesus said don't build your life on
[1:07:36] that because
[1:07:37] when they come they'll wreck everything
[1:07:39] you've done
[1:07:40] build on the solid rock of god's word
[1:07:43] and when
[1:07:44] not if when those storms come it'll
[1:07:46] stand
[1:07:49] it might even waver and you might lose a
[1:07:51] few pieces of trim but you can put it
[1:07:53] back
[1:07:53] i can put a few shingles back but i
[1:07:55] don't want to lose the whole house
[1:07:59] amen better devices better jobs
[1:08:03] better education got
[1:08:06] elite people even thinking they can game
[1:08:08] the system and pay money to get their
[1:08:10] kids in the best schools
[1:08:11] it's madness they're in prison now for
[1:08:14] it
[1:08:14] ruin their careers for it you see what
[1:08:16] they're chasing you see what laodicea
[1:08:18] wants you to chase after
[1:08:20] don't do it friends don't do it young
[1:08:22] people if mom
[1:08:24] and dad aren't don't have enough zeal
[1:08:26] you get some zeal
[1:08:28] if if they won't if they won't lead by
[1:08:30] example then just
[1:08:31] then just call on god and god will meet
[1:08:33] you and you can lead the family
[1:08:35] hallelujah i've seen that happen i've
[1:08:38] seen teenagers i've seen teenagers
[1:08:41] get it get enthused over the word of god
[1:08:44] get filled with the holy ghost and lead
[1:08:46] their parents into the message of the
[1:08:48] hour
[1:08:49] bring their parents back under the power
[1:08:51] of god don't tell me i'm gonna tell you
[1:08:53] something friends

[1:08:57] teenager in here with the power of the
[1:08:59] holy ghost
[1:08:59] and bring them into the glory way
[1:09:03] hallelujah that's why we preach it's why
[1:09:05] we gather
[1:09:07] you know i appreciate the parents you
[1:09:08] know and i get it
[1:09:10] you say well they're good kids well sure

[1:09:14] raising and church services will do that
[1:09:17] i get it i appreciate the parents that
[1:09:19] make that effort but
[1:09:20] that's not the limits of what god is
[1:09:22] expecting from you
[1:09:28] you know sometimes as a shepherd i find
[1:09:29] myself
[1:09:31] almost feeling like i need to go step in
[1:09:34] just step in front of somebody
[1:09:36] you know knock on their forehead and go
[1:09:38] hey
[1:09:40] god remember him come on
[1:09:43] and they're like oh yeah oh yeah thank
[1:09:45] you pastor thank you

[1:09:49] i'm doing today
[1:09:50] it's the glory way i'm trying to tap you
[1:09:53] and go hey
[1:09:54] rapture remember that the holy ghost
[1:09:57] remember that
[1:09:59] i know the world's not all about your
[1:10:00] job your career and your social
[1:10:02] activities
[1:10:04] your whole life this life is not about
[1:10:06] this life how many times you heard
[1:10:07] brother jason say that
[1:10:08] this life is not about this life this
[1:10:10] life is about the next life
[1:10:12] hallelujah i'm living this one right to
[1:10:14] get to that one
[1:10:16] glory to god oh my this has seemingly
[1:10:20] been a
[1:10:21] been a repeating blind spot seemingly in
[1:10:23] every generation
[1:10:24] parents not willing to go to the wall
[1:10:26] and back it's not easy
[1:10:29] in fact it's hard to keep a balance life
[1:10:32] is just so
[1:10:33] necessary and busy amen it's true
[1:10:36] amen and i and i and i see
[1:10:40] plenty of parents going to the wall god
[1:10:43] bless you
[1:10:44] let me let me just not sound like today
[1:10:46] like i'm just
[1:10:47] trying to beat everybody up we're on the
[1:10:49] glory path and i
[1:10:50] see many parents going to the wall and
[1:10:53] back doing everything they can
[1:10:54] sparing no expense and so i want you to
[1:10:57] know
[1:10:58] it's not unnoticed you know we want to
[1:11:00] we want to
[1:11:01] build something out of the word of god
[1:11:04] amen the world there's no safety in the
[1:11:07] world
[1:11:08] amen god gave an example put a prophet
[1:11:11] here to give us
[1:11:12] an example how to how to live our lives
[1:11:15] how to think about education how to
[1:11:17] handle politics how to handle family
[1:11:19] members
[1:11:20] god but god caused a prophet to live in
[1:11:22] front of us
[1:11:23] as an example amen
[1:11:26] and so so you know we we have found that
[1:11:30] that his words
[1:11:32] 50 years ago
[1:11:36] have come to pass you know there's a lot
[1:11:37] of things brother branham saw
[1:11:40] and commented on that even today when i
[1:11:44] read them i go
[1:11:45] wow that was barely even noticeable in
[1:11:48] his day
[1:11:49] see but he was seeing as a prophet whose
[1:11:51] eagle eye looks a long ways off
[1:11:53] he was never going to see a lot of the
[1:11:56] stuff he was talking about in seed form
[1:11:58] and then i said to myself is that why
[1:12:00] we've still
[1:12:01] here 50 plus years later because god
[1:12:04] needed
[1:12:05] for our bride to actually fulfill to
[1:12:08] where it's not just seed anymore
[1:12:10] it's in the full realities the insanity
[1:12:12] he said
[1:12:13] in the 60s the world will go continually
[1:12:15] it'll get worse and worse and worse
[1:12:17] until they come completely insane
[1:12:21] and i'm here to tell you something
[1:12:22] friends we have arrived
[1:12:24] we have arrived i think that that's why
[1:12:26] we're still here
[1:12:27] and and and and you know when we when
[1:12:30] brother branham says here
[1:12:31] in in trying to do god a service without
[1:12:34] being the will of god 1965
[1:12:36] one of the last things one of the last
[1:12:37] sermons he preaches
[1:12:40] he says you know sh
[1:12:43] you know show me the the results because
[1:12:46] you know here is uh here's a here's
[1:12:49] remember elijah
[1:12:50] almost mocking the false prophets cry
[1:12:52] louder
[1:12:54] see and so brother branham says show me
[1:12:57] the results why has this so-called
[1:12:59] revival
[1:13:02] this is 1965. he's he has spent his
[1:13:06] entire ministry pleading with pentecost
[1:13:09] come back to the word and they didn't do
[1:13:12] it
[1:13:13] and he's even got a a time
[1:13:16] where you know he's gave her a space to
[1:13:18] repent
[1:13:20] all down through the church ages until
[1:13:22] we get to the last one
[1:13:24] and you know because the cup of iniquity
[1:13:26] wasn't full that's why
[1:13:27] until until the cup of iniquity of the
[1:13:29] amorites was full israel couldn't go in
[1:13:32] you understand joshua couldn't take them
[1:13:33] over once that cup was full
[1:13:35] then they could go into exodus then
[1:13:37] joshua could take them over and
[1:13:39] and why why are we still here because
[1:13:41] you know why has the ages going because
[1:13:42] the cup of of iniquity wasn't full
[1:13:45] and now we've reached a time friends say
[1:13:47] what's the madness on the street the cup
[1:13:49] of iniquity running over
[1:13:52] it's pure poison and people drink it and
[1:13:54] swim around in it
[1:13:56] it's it's life that's what we've come to
[1:13:58] this isn't fantasy
[1:13:59] you're i'm telling you things you know
[1:14:01] you see it in the news
[1:14:05] we have a we live in the bible belt we
[1:14:07] live in a red state we live in a small
[1:14:08] seaside town
[1:14:10] we don't have a lot of direct contact
[1:14:12] with it but i'm here to tell you the
[1:14:13] nation is rife with it
[1:14:17] and we don't know yet what how crazy it
[1:14:20] might get
[1:14:21] we don't know no one knows i ca
[1:14:24] you can hear one pundit one of these
[1:14:26] talking heads get on there
[1:14:28] and go oh the incumbent has no chance
[1:14:30] there's no path he might as well give up
[1:14:32] now
[1:14:32] and then you hear another talking head
[1:14:34] go are you kidding he's got a perfect
[1:14:35] path if the courts do this and the
[1:14:36] courts do that
[1:14:38] and and i mean you're sitting there
[1:14:39] going wow what is about to happen in
[1:14:41] this nation
[1:14:42] i don't know some i don't know friends
[1:14:44] but i know this i want to be in the clef
[1:14:46] of the rock
[1:14:48] i want to be where i where i'm safe i
[1:14:50] want to know that
[1:14:51] god is in my life that god is anointing
[1:14:54] my kids that that god is anointing my
[1:14:56] grandkids that god is anointing your
[1:14:57] kids and your grandkids
[1:14:59] because we're marching to zion and i
[1:15:00] believe we're almost home
[1:15:04] he says show me the results why has this
[1:15:07] so called revival getting people back to
[1:15:09] church
[1:15:10] churches done to the nation
[1:15:13] to the body of believers it's nothing
[1:15:15] but made new organizations and
[1:15:17] denominations all the way along
[1:15:19] more members and so forth is the nation
[1:15:22] better
[1:15:22] they said they was going to you know
[1:15:24] america god brother branham now here
[1:15:26] now here he comes like elijah like
[1:15:28] mocking if you listen to the tape you'll
[1:15:29] hear it
[1:15:30] they say oh god bless america oh it's a
[1:15:33] nation
[1:15:34] it's a christian country brother branham
[1:15:36] says it's a million
[1:15:38] miles from a christian country he said i
[1:15:41] don't even pray for it
[1:15:43] how can i pray for it and it won't
[1:15:45] repent under the mighty powers of god
[1:15:47] demonstrated before it
[1:15:48] and deny the and closing the doors to it
[1:15:51] and walking away i committed to god
[1:15:53] she is going further away that's a
[1:15:55] prophecy
[1:15:56] now she is going to sink just watch what
[1:16:00] happens
[1:16:01] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:16:03] we didn't need to wait on california we
[1:16:04] didn't need to wait on on hollywood to
[1:16:06] go under the
[1:16:07] under the waves to see the nation going
[1:16:09] under the waves
[1:16:13] so we have an anointing on this word
[1:16:16] it brings us to this glory way and
[1:16:18] that's my message to you
[1:16:20] set your life in the glory way set your
[1:16:23] children's
[1:16:24] path in the glory way stop
[1:16:27] stop putting them aside or stop
[1:16:30] putting them in your way or trying to
[1:16:32] live out your unfulfilled fantasies in
[1:16:34] your children
[1:16:36] did i say that out loud
[1:16:40] yeah i did because that happens
[1:16:46] i pray for the spirit of god to bring
[1:16:48] your family into his image
[1:16:51] that's what i'm praying for that the
[1:16:53] spirit of god will bring you
[1:16:55] into his image i know he has an image
[1:16:58] that he saw of you and your family
[1:17:00] before the foundation of the world
[1:17:02] and i pray every day lord bring them
[1:17:04] closer let this day
[1:17:06] be a little closer to that image now i
[1:17:08] don't know what that might cost you
[1:17:11] it might cost you quite a bit but i'm
[1:17:13] here to tell you
[1:17:15] if it if i'm able to pull it off and get
[1:17:17] you on the other side like i'm ordained
[1:17:19] to do
[1:17:19] you'll thank me you'll thank me for
[1:17:22] telling you the truth
[1:17:24] see let your life you know we want to
[1:17:27] see our lives become actively in the
[1:17:29] ways of glory
[1:17:31] because our life in glory is to bring
[1:17:33] him glory
[1:17:35] and and it's sad because almost all of
[1:17:37] humanity refuses to do that
[1:17:39] although god gave him life although god
[1:17:42] put the breath in their lungs they won't
[1:17:43] live
[1:17:44] they won't use that air to give him
[1:17:46] glory
[1:17:48] he put life in their bloodstream they
[1:17:49] won't use that life to give him glory
[1:17:52] see and so there's you know i'll tell
[1:17:55] you something friends
[1:17:56] you know i
[1:17:59] there there's hardly words let me just
[1:18:01] say this as a veteran

[1:18:40] tell you from experience that that that
[1:18:43] there is
[1:18:44] there is almost i tried to even put it
[1:18:46] in my notes and i
[1:18:47] i i i found it inept
[1:18:51] that there's hardly words to describe
[1:18:54] the feeling that you can have
[1:18:58] on a daily basis when you wake up in the
[1:19:01] morning and you
[1:19:02] know your life is pleasing to god
[1:19:06] when you go through the day and no
[1:19:08] matter what you encounter you're not
[1:19:09] afraid of it
[1:19:10] because you know he's near you you know
[1:19:13] all you have to do is whisper a prayer
[1:19:15] you know you could lay your hand on the
[1:19:17] sick and they'd recover
[1:19:18] you know you could cast out a devil you
[1:19:20] go to bed at night and you know you're
[1:19:21] safe in his arms
[1:19:22] and you know that you've lived the right
[1:19:24] way and you know that he's pleased and
[1:19:26] you can
[1:19:26] feel it there's hardly no words to
[1:19:29] describe but it can't imperfect
[1:19:31] contradistinction
[1:19:33] there's no misery for a christian so
[1:19:35] great as when you walk around and
[1:19:37] and the clouds of failure are hanging
[1:19:39] over you and you you're moping around
[1:19:42] and carnality oh
[1:19:44] my flee it take my word for it run back
[1:19:47] to christ
[1:19:48] get get your life back in prayer get
[1:19:50] your life back in church
[1:19:51] know that he's pleased with your life
[1:19:54] there's nothing you would ever do
[1:19:56] nothing you would ever accomplish no
[1:19:57] amount of money you would ever have
[1:19:59] it would never equal that feeling
[1:20:05] it would never equal that feeling
[1:20:09] and i've proven it i've proven it
[1:20:12] over the years i've proven it
[1:20:19] i'm going to have to skip this because i
[1:20:21] i want to just come to a close
[1:20:24] you see that city that we talked about
[1:20:28] josh let's pull it up give me john 18 st
[1:20:30] john 18
[1:20:32] and we're going to go to verse 6.
[1:20:35] it's a beautiful verse watch this
[1:20:40] this is jesus in the gardens here comes
[1:20:42] the soldiers
[1:20:45] as soon then as he had said unto them
[1:20:48] i am he he said whom seek ye and they
[1:20:51] said jesus of nazareth
[1:20:53] and he said i am he they went backward
[1:20:55] and fell to the ground
[1:20:57] now these aren't ballerinas these are
[1:20:59] soldiers
[1:21:01] these are warriors with swords and
[1:21:03] staves and shields
[1:21:05] helmets they're used to killing people
[1:21:07] they're used to arresting people
[1:21:08] and here's jesus not a big man brother
[1:21:11] branham saw him said he was a very small
[1:21:12] man
[1:21:14] he said very very small he said he said
[1:21:16] i would say maybe he weighed 140 pounds
[1:21:19] and he said just very small narrow
[1:21:21] shoulders no beauty in him that we
[1:21:22] should desire he said but yet
[1:21:24] he said when he looked in my eyes he
[1:21:25] said it was like he said it was like
[1:21:28] you wanted to just burst in crying burst
[1:21:30] out crying he said yet
[1:21:32] it also had the look that if he would
[1:21:33] speak the world might end
[1:21:35] he said there's no way i can describe
[1:21:37] when he looked at me how that feel
[1:21:38] feeling felt and here is
[1:21:41] armed troops and they confront him
[1:21:45] in the garden of gethsemane why didn't
[1:21:47] they recognize him
[1:21:48] why didn't they recognize him jesus told
[1:21:49] him he said he goes on in the
[1:21:51] conversation he says
[1:21:52] i was with you daily in the temple you'd
[1:21:55] made no move
[1:21:56] and now here a man who's been preaching
[1:21:59] daily
[1:22:01] they've they secretly infiltrated his
[1:22:03] meetings and they sent the high priest
[1:22:05] sent him to arrest him they come back
[1:22:06] without him where are you where's he at
[1:22:08] well we we couldn't we couldn't arrest
[1:22:10] him why not
[1:22:11] never a man spake like that man
[1:22:14] a little bitty guy and he
[1:22:18] here he is they should have recognized
[1:22:20] him but they don't recognize him i
[1:22:21] thought to myself
[1:22:22] i wonder what it was what had that
[1:22:25] gethsemane experience
[1:22:26] done to him that they didn't even
[1:22:29] recognize him anymore
[1:22:31] i want to tell you something friends
[1:22:32] here's a man who had so surrendered his
[1:22:35] entire will
[1:22:36] who had been able to say not my will but
[1:22:40] thine be done a man who had cried under
[1:22:42] such anxiety that his
[1:22:44] his tears were bl had blood mingled in
[1:22:47] them
[1:22:48] that his sweat was mingled with blood
[1:22:52] and that's a medical they have a medical
[1:22:53] explanation for that under extreme
[1:22:56] under extreme stress that it can cause
[1:22:58] capillaries
[1:22:59] to frac to fray and blood can come out
[1:23:03] through
[1:23:03] your sweat and tears
[1:23:06] this is a man who knows the torture he's
[1:23:09] about to go into
[1:23:10] and he's about to volunteer for it and
[1:23:13] his human side says
[1:23:14] not my will thine be done you know why
[1:23:17] because he knew he had one way to be in
[1:23:20] and that was to give god glory and
[1:23:23] whatever it cost him
[1:23:25] he was there to give god glory and
[1:23:28] whatever you say what did it do to him
[1:23:30] whatever it did to him they didn't even
[1:23:32] recognize him
[1:23:35] and they said whom seek ye and he said
[1:23:38] jesus nazareth
[1:23:39] i am he and they immediately fell to the
[1:23:41] ground
[1:23:43] falling backwards in fear and he asked
[1:23:45] him again whom seek you
[1:23:47] jesus of nazareth i've already told you
[1:23:49] i'm he
[1:23:51] you know something friends i thought
[1:23:52] about i thought about i wonder
[1:23:55] if there was such glory such
[1:23:58] such such glory that there was a moment
[1:24:02] maybe when the when the veil of flesh
[1:24:04] was
[1:24:05] rent for just a moment and a little
[1:24:07] flash of the life that was in him
[1:24:09] flashed out i'm here to tell you
[1:24:11] something friends when god flashed on
[1:24:13] the scene people ran for their lives
[1:24:16] what was it in his life that was so
[1:24:18] surrendered to god
[1:24:19] that when he just said i am he was there
[1:24:22] some little
[1:24:23] crack that came was there just enough
[1:24:26] something come out of his eyes i don't
[1:24:27] know the bible doesn't record it
[1:24:29] only thing i know is from a little man
[1:24:32] rough
[1:24:32] burly soldiers collapsed and fell to the
[1:24:35] ground

[1:24:39] the kind of glory that i want to have in

[1:25:05] horrible sins

[1:25:10] for my earthliness just earthiness
[1:25:14] just humanness just this lower
[1:25:17] level that i wasn't designed to live in

[1:27:19] heart to know and acknowledge to you
[1:27:22] lord i've been pretty earthy and i
[1:27:25] haven't really been as heavenly as i

[1:34:08] today thank you for coming out
[1:34:10] make sure you greet brother esteban he's

[1:34:20] that's one we're going to a land where
[1:34:22] we won't be separated brother won't have
[1:34:24] a nation in between us
[1:34:26] amen and even if we do i can be there in
[1:34:28] a thought
[1:34:29] all i gotta do is think it and be there
[1:34:32] wow can you imagine that friends because
[1:34:35] you know when you travel like a thought
[1:34:38] then then distance becomes relative
[1:34:42] i mean if i want to move from here to
[1:34:44] there it'll take me you know
[1:34:46] two and a half seconds but if i want to
[1:34:48] move to the back door
[1:34:50] it's further so distances equals time
[1:34:53] i'm going to need probably 20 seconds if
[1:34:55] i want to go to the street if i want to
[1:34:56] go to up here to the drugstore
[1:34:58] i'm going to need minutes but imagine in
[1:35:01] a place where whether i'm
[1:35:02] two feet or two trillion miles it
[1:35:06] doesn't take any longer to get two
[1:35:08] trillion than two feet
[1:35:10] because distance is completely relative
[1:35:13] time won't matter oh amen brother andrew
[1:35:17] do you know the song um
[1:35:19] i'm kind of home sick for
[1:35:22] a country i'm kind of
