the name of the Lord Jesus happy to have all your smiling faces here today number of visitors throughout the audience I won't start calling names but uh welcome God bless you we're happy to have you here today amen turn around shake hands with somebody say God bless you amen Prophet said that's the best thing you can say to someone God bless you there's a great amount of meaning in that amen my if God blesses you then everything will be fine amen praise the Lord amen um you can be seated just for a moment I have a uh a little video clip that we received from Brother Jason and I I can't say a whole lot um I can't name call but um it comes from um th this is not the scene where Believers are there's a pastor there and uh Brother JD has asked me not to say his name over the Internet because we're streaming but uh the report from him is that they are you know um hunkering down and that attacks are going on throughout Israel you're going to see a clip here that is reflective of actually what's happening on the ground and a lot of times the Western media you know because of the liberal slant of things they don't want to show everything and I can promise you I promise you no matter what happens no matter what Israel does in defense of their Nation they basically had a 911 event like we did and when that happened we went straight to War uh they're going to do the same thing however you can rest assure they will be very heavily condemned for it by the world um they'll be called you know they'll be called genocide and everything and all they're doing they've literally been in eved what you're seeing is a running gun battle on their interstates if you went out to 95 and you were driving and suddenly an enemy from the tree line opened fire and fortunately there was a convoy of Israeli soldiers and they all hit the brakes jump out and this is a liveaction running gun battle the people filming it inside a car are hunkering down trying not to get killed amen just want to give you this brother Matt go ahead [Music] go go [Music] that's happening in real time that's very recent it would be no different friends put yourself going up 21 you're passing by the air station and suddenly you come under Fire and Marines are flooding out of the air station to return fire that's what's happening on the ground in Israel right they have crossed the borders they've invaded they've killed innocent they went after children and women and I saw a clip of Israelis being taken hostage and women being separated and carried off in vehicles um already bleeding and so this is happening and uh we want to be praying the Bible tells us in multiple places that we should pray for the Peace of Israel for the Peace of Jerusalem and you know we know that of course that's not going to stop all nations in in coming against Jerusalem in the tribulation that's going to happen your prayers aren't going to stop that but there are believers there and we're praying Lord keep your hand over all of your family over the innocent people watch over soldiers and you know I don't we don't want to see people killed on either side of a conflict but you know I know that the Lord has all of this in his control that's the thing you really want to take away friends is the Lord is in control this is the uh this is a surprise attack uh very similar they haven't seen anything like it since 73 on yam kapor when uh um Arab Nations poured across their border and Israel nearly collapsed I don't know how familiar you are with that but they nearly were overrun they were taken by surprise their intelligence had an epic failure to detect it and they were literally facing the collapse of the capital uh I think it was Egyptian and Syrian were in a coming from the North and the South and Israel had it is known that Israel is a nuclear nation and they have all it is it is absolutely established fact and I verified it Israel had nuclear bombs armed on the planes on the runway and the bombers with engines running and they were waiting for the command to strike and Washington found out about it called the cremin said you better tell them uh Egyptians and syrians to stop or we're looking at Armageddon and just the hand of God moving and political pressure was applied lied and we didn't face uh Global you know nuclear war in the 70s you know why we didn't because God wasn't ready for it amen hallelujah he still had names on that book Hallelujah and I'm so glad to know that my name is on that book praise the name of the Lord and at you say when will it all end it'll end at the appointed hour it'll end ex that's what Jesus said the father has that you just understand this it's a date on his calendar known to God Amen Hallelujah and it's not you're not going to speed it up or hinder it amen but friends the world is falling apart it's happening right now and my personal opinion and I I as a student of History I study historical Trends I preach by history history has moved at the pace of Prophecy since since the uh the earliest civilizations that's provable by the Bible and an overlay of history and I can tell you as a student of History who studies it and teaches it what you're seeing now is something to take notice of this is not a small thing and I uh you know I I believe it looks to me like this could really get out of control very quick and uh we know Iran is behind it Western Nations know that intelligence Services know that and if Israel decides to take advantage and strike Iran you need to be close to the Lord I just want to say to you the time for playing church has ended amen it it's it's going home time amen we know that we will not be here when that happens amen so that's clear in Prophecy amen so I just wanted to give you that update today and uh the pastor there says that all the Believers are accounted for currently and safe but they are having to hunker down and there's all kinds of emergency procedures they're having these this this is all over they they have found pockets of this you know they realize that they got into more than just one little Hamlet and one military base they've spread out and attacks are still going on and so the Israeli Army is trying to get control of their borders and and they're trying to rescue hostages as we speak so will you be praying for them amen praise the Lord we're going to take today I'm going to invite you to stand back with me for a reading in Genesis chapter 1 I'm hoping to conclude today my lengthy series 10 part 10th part today rebuilding Eden rebuilding Eden amen praise the Lord in Genesis 1 it's um a lengthy reading so we will um read through quickly Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day and God said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters and God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so and God called the firmament heaven and the evening and the morning were the second day and God said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together into one place and let the dry land appear and it was so I think it's pretty clear who's in control there's no ambiguity who's calling the shots he's not counseling with anybody there's no committee this isn't a denomination this is One Sovereign in control of his creation aren't you glad he's in control of you and God called the dry land Earth and the Gathering Together of the waters called he seeds and God saw that it was good and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so and the Earth brought forth grass and Herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good the evening and the morning were the third day he goes on down and down and down fourth day fifth day sixth day he comes to verse 24 and God said let the Earth bring forth the living creature after its kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after its kind and it was so and God made the Beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the Earth after his kind and God saw that it was good and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it now he's transferring some Authority he's been doing it all now he's got somebody in his own image and he's saying now I want you to take over see have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth and God said behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the Earth and every tree and the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat to every beast of the earth and to every foul of the air and everything that creepeth upon the Earth wherein there is life I have given every every green herb for me and it was so and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day three verses into chapter two thus the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and God blessed the seventh day and Sanctified it it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made from there it goes on into the generations of the heavens all right let's pray I have a special prayer request from um brother Donnie Reagan is asking prayer we had to take Erica to the hospital yesterday she has pneumonia in both lungs and pancreatis and high ammonia levels and Colitis would you all remember her today she needs a touch from the Master but then he says but none of these things back to as Paul said in the book of Acts but none of these things move us from believing that our God is going to completely restore her father we give you thanks today for this Faith Lord that brother Donnie has for his daughter We join our faith with his faith Lord may you join your faith with our faith and push this promise through to completion May our sister receive receive a merciful Touch by the master today Grant it Lord we have prayed much and we continue to pray and we will not stop praying Lord we are determined to see our sister Lord brought back under thy blessing of Health today I pray you'll bless the word the hearing the reading Lord the speaker and the hearer commit myself into your hands completely now in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you friends you can be seated man just waiting for the commotion to die down everybody good praise the Lord the Bible knowledge commentary volume two concerning Genesis 1:1 makes this statement the account of Genesis 1:1 where we read in the beginning God created the Heaven and the earth and the commentator says the account reveals that that God is a redeeming God it records how and this is what you read in that lengthy reading it records how that he brought the cosmos out of chaos he turned Darkness into light he made divisions between them he transformed cursing into blessing and moved from what was evil and darkness to what was holy now that is a a perfect type of what he has done for you and I when we were born in sin and we came into the world in darkness and our lives in chaos and so bad was our situation so hopess was our condition that Paul said that the mind that you were given that you were born with when you were born in sin could actually never agree with God you could never believe him you could never agree with him it is hopeless for mankind B born in sin to save himself find God or find his way home our home is in heaven above as what the Bible teaches us that we are we have Jerusalem above the mother of us all this is why in the Old Testament whenever you read about Jerusalem referred to as Zion and you realize a prophet said that's always a type of the bre bride it's always a type of the of the wife of Christ and and and that's such an important point because you know one of the prayers as I was saying one of the areas that tells us to pray for the Peace of Jerusalem is not only there's two verses in Psalms and I'm not going to turn to it today because I'm already got a lot to cover and I don't want to go too long but but one verse says that you should pray without and I'm just I'm just I'm just uh paraphrasing it don't stop praying for the Peace of Jerusalem and the next verse to my astonishment when I read it I thought am I seeing things I didn't ever remember reading it and it said and give God no rest until he does it blue my mind all my years of reading the Bible I never remembered I if I read it I read across it and didn't catch it don't let and God is saying through David here's what I want you to do don't give me a break don't let up on me keep praying until I make Jerusalem a city of peace and I just say if Jerusalem is Zion and Zion is the bride that I'm not going to give him any rest until he brings my life to where it needs to be until he brings this whole assembly and all your families to where it needs to be give give no rest to the Holy Spirit no wonder brother Brandon would say just start knocking to he that knocketh say Lord I'm not going to stop are you getting tired of Me Knocking I'm having a good time knocking that's what we need friends this world's falling apart and we need the power of the Living God moving Among Us and I would say don't stop praying for it don't stop pressing for it by allowing the light to shine on my Eden soil my Stardust as NASA says we are visy Stardust brother brandham said before Stardust I I I existed Hallelujah so just as in the Garden of Eden those ages long ago when all Darkness was cleared away the water was rolled back and the dry land appear and Eden soil before it ever was separated it already was in existence but the water had covered it it's interesting because when you look at that as an analogy as a type you say goodness the water was covering over all the land with all the seed and nothing could grow but yet water is the source of life for the seed to grow it needs light and it needs water it's say wow it it it kind of loged jams the spiritual type because it's almost as if that thing which was s which was to support life was hindering life but that's not uncommon at all when you're talking about something in a fallen condition because that's when you when the narrative opens up when the drama the first scene in the curtain opens in Genesis 1:1 the Earth has already been there a long time in in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth period doesn't say when how long what he did it just simply says that's what he did and then that's it and then verse two he begins bringing it back it came out of a ruined condition it came out of a chaos Darkness covered the face of the deep water there was no dry land the firmaments weren't even divided this is some type of a prophet calls it a ruined Earth from uh something prior we don't know we'll we'll understand it better by and by it's rather ambiguous in scripture but but it's a type of you and I the the Earth hadn't always been ruined than it was and now he's fixing it I I wasn't always born in sin I had a beginning in the mind of God but then I came born in sin but now he's fixing me hallelujah hallelujah thank God he's fixing me he's fixing you and he he he how does he do it he gives his word that's how he always operates there there's there's times where I would like him to slap you around and there's times he needs to slap me around knock some sense out into you or some stupidity out of you but he doesn't do it that way he sends his word and he gives you the choice whether or not to believe it I'm here to tell you if you'll just believe it and receive it and Obey it it'll fix the chaos it'll repair you I don't care what's happened it'll repair you he by his word the word just obeyed him his brother R would say one time he said you know if God could have chose the the the the wind to preach the gospel he chose what the Bible calls the foolishness of preaching and that's so crazy because it's Fallen men preaching to Fallen men trying to get us all perfect so it's the foolishness of preaching but it's what God chose see and so Propet said he could have chose the wind he could have done that he said he could have chose the trees to do it in fact as he said had he chose the wind the wind would have just obeyed him the trees would have just obeyed him he we already know Jesus commanded the winds and the waves we already know he said to a to a to an olive tree you'll bear or you'll bear no more forever and it began to wither up immediately and so we already know that nature always obeys him Prophet said but it's man who gives him his trouble God's not looking for robots or Androids or forced slavery he he doesn't want worship like Nebuchadnezzar did where which slavery Worship You worship or I'll kill you it's not that God God loves and God wants to be loved and God gives and and he he desires the whole thing was about building a kingdom Prophet said he was alone but he he wanted to share his eternal life with Humanity who could not love a god with that kind of a heart that kind of a soul who who takes no pleasure in even the death of his enemies takes no pleasure he would that all men come to repentance the Bible says he knows they won't but he desires he gives them a chance and he tries it's why a prophet said if you go to hell remember Hell friends was never built for human beings it was built for the devil and his angels but the Bible says Hell hath enlarged itself like a prison overcrowded prison they had to build on new Wings because it's now housing humans who wer never supposed to be there and he said if you go to hell you'll fight every step of the way because God will set every kind of barricade and block and try to block you and he he'll do it with parents and preachers and friends and prayers and he and and then if none of if none of the good things work then he'll plague you and and and go after you and whip you and and try everything he can like a loving parent would do you don't love a child if you don't discipline the child because they're they're wild weed they can't they they can't grow straight they they have to have nurturing they have to have training you don't you don't raise up children and start letting them make their own decisions as a child that's ignorant nature itself no nowhere does that happen in nature see and so I mean you know those those Mama bears they raise those Cubs until they're able and then sometimes even will keep them even longer see so so so you find that that you know God operates in this exact same way just the same way he rolled back Waters and dry land appear he brought order out of chaos and and and this is literally the heart of every son and daughter of God born in in the darkness of chaos and they overflowed you know as I was giving you a while ago the analogy of the water remember that Paul goes into the book of Romans and he he starts taking the Law of God which came from God and Paul says now here's an interesting thing that that Satan he saw the word of God and then he saw me and he knew if I'm born in sin there's no way I can keep this it's not possible even and and and he also knows that even if I'm a good person that still wouldn't have any Eternal value it has temporal value if you're good if you give God will see to it that people give unto you you reap what you sow so goodness so kindness you'll reap it back but as far as Eternal value as far as escaping the Realms of mortality into the new heavens and the new Earth you have to be born again there there's no amount of good works that can earn you the right to live in heaven you have to be born again and so Paul says that here Satan was taking advantage of the good word and you and he said he was actually using the word which was for life and he was applying it to me and it brought me death cuz I couldn't keep the word and so now I I'm on the I'm on the hook to keep it but I can't and even what a little bit I can still do is still just so far below God its filthiness at best to him that's how much higher he is and so it's just like genesis the water which was supposed to give life is now is now hindering life the word which was sent to give life because you're born in sin it's now it's now condemning you that's why brother and said the law all the law could do was put you in jail all it could do was condemn you but Christ came to fulfill the law on your behalf and now you can go free you can be born again you can have all the chaos removed and you can be a fruitful field for the Lord so we realize then that the same word that was spoken let there be light it speaks to us now and it rolls back the Waters of death and darkness so that the seed that we were born with can shine in the presence of God's sunlight it brings forth life it brings forth life I'm here to tell you Jesus called the gospel a seed I mean there is so much value in that because it's good seed and if it falls in the right bedding ground you know what it'll do it'll grow the same Garden of Eden that God grew your life has the potential to become a garden of beauty and Perfection Adam and Eve operated in Perfection all was peace forever more in that happy Golden Shore there was no Strife between Adam and Eve they had a perfect marriage a perfect home they would have brought forth perfect children and perfect Offspring as they were commanded to do but before that could come about God's enemy Prophet says he slipped in under the wall and he began to reason he went after Eve because of her unique way of coming into the Earth her beginning was unmanifested she was contained within Adam until at a later time after creation God put him to sleep and took her out because of this way that she came it exposed her to reasoning he he never went to try to reason with Adam that would have been impossible Adam was the son of God and would have never reasoned God's word and therefore you're not to reason God's word see and so but she did she she made that terrible terrible mistake now we find that that when that happened and she reasoned the word of God Prophet said it like this when she received the devil's liie then she received his L you see the spoken word is the Original Seed so you have no chance to be an overcomer if you doubt and reason the word of God you literally are defeating your own self it's not that the word is powerless it's that you will not allow it to operate in your life and that's your choice I've made my choice I I as for me in my house we're going to believe it and we're going to live it you say Do you ever fail at it I do but thankfully I have an advocate with God Christ Jesus who intercedes on my behalf when I do make a mistake and I'm going to Avail myself of that I'm not going to let that sit in my treasure chest and never spend it that's right see the world cast great doubt on this Victor Hugo when he was past 80 years of age he gave expression to his religious faith in these Sublime sentences he says I feel in myself the future life it's past 80 I am like a forest which has been more than once cut down the new shoots are livelier than ever I am Rising toward the sky the sunshine is on my head the Earth gives me its generous sap but Heaven lights me with its unknown worlds you say the soul is nothing but the resultant of the bodily Powers why then is my soul more luminous when my body Powers begin to fail winter is on my head but Eternal spring is in my heart I breathe at this hour the fragrance of the lilacs the violets and the Roses as at 20 years I the nearer I approach the end the pler I hear around me the immortal Symphonies of the worlds which invite me it is a marvelous yet simple truth that Hugo realizes in in his as the older he gotten the closer to Heaven he felt am I want to say to you today friends don't let the world paint Heaven as some story some fabrication it's a real land it's in existence right now there are people living there there are people you have known in this lifetime who are living there alive right now and they're saying as a prophet heard press the battle you can make it you're almost home Hallelujah we've been in this series making the statement over the last several installments how that Holiness is embedded uh in love in the Eden Story the reason that and I just want to say this not perhaps that Believers need this you know this this this opening statement but perhaps because I've dealt with it again and again and again and again and I'm going to go down the path a little bit today not it's not really the the the main stay of my sermon but I don't get to choose these things I have to follow the boss but there is such a uh an assault today that of all places comes from modern Christianity yeah of all places it's not even the liberal left it's actually the conservative right that says God is love which is true and it doesn't really matter how you live or what you do God judges the heart forgetting completely that if the Heart Is Right the outside will be right as if they're just ignoring that and I and and I say they're ignoring it because there's no way they could be so naive as to actually they believe it because they want to believe it as I've said to you before if you don't if you don't if you go up years and I've seen this and I'm seeing this that and I'm seeing it more than I've ever seen it that if you sat in a message church for enough years and you never get the B baptism of the Holy Spirit but you remain only mentally convinced of it eventually your willpower to live Holiness will erode and you'll start leaning into carnality and the and the design of the world and and if and if and if you don't get that arrested and what we're seeing is is that you'll finally get so impatient with constantly having to live a Holiness standard that you'll start looking around for a different version of The Gospel that will tell you you don't have to you will minimalize the value of the message you will minimalize the authority of the Prophet don't tell me it won't happen I'm already seeing it it's a fact so I I want to say again yes God is love the love of God is immeasurable but Holiness is embedded in his love right living is embedded in his love don't imagine that you can live an ungodly lifestyle and call that the love of God that is a conundrum that is that is that is impo that's impossible see so when we when we go to the most more often than not people we we talk about the Ten Commandments from Horeb and you know because that's where everybody say okay well that's where the law began to be given and thou shalt not kill and thou sht not steal and shall not commit adultery and shall not do this and bear false witness and covet and all these different things and and and you know which is exactly why I've said said and say again you know my my wife and I we we were just talking about this recently my goodness if if if there wasn't even no heaven and there was I would still live a Christian lifestyle because it's better it's healthier I as I've said you've heard me say it before I get to hang on to all my money I get to stay in health I don't blow it on wild living I don't I don't eat up my body with with diseases social diseases and and and controlled substances that destroys me I I I I I don't abuse my wife or my children we have love and we and the Christian lifestyle teaches me that it's a much better lifestyle people are crazy to not live it even if they're not a Christian they should live it they'll have a better life absolutely have a better life see because those principles of God work because they're a seed Jesus called it a seed it'll grow a crop and it'll grow in Eden so so when we look at these Ten Commandments from Horeb I I want to make a statement and and I'm there's a number of things today that I'm going to go slow on on purpose because this is my perhaps my last chance in this series to nail this one more time the Ten Commandments from Horeb were not first written at Horeb they were first written in Adam's heart and Genesis bears that out it was you know when we come to horb it was it was insincere individuals who desired to codify it all in writing was insincere Prophet said that was never God's plan they had a prophet they had the pillar of fire they had a Brazen altar they had everything they needed a cloud by day a fire by Night the angel of the Lord's presence a Vindicated Prophet but man wanted something to do in it he he the reason he wants something to do in it is so he can control it and so he wanted to have a part he wanted a law Prophet said it's the most his Kentucky English rational thing meaning irrational thing they ever did and and and and the only reason even Jesus shows us that the only reason God gave it to him was to prove to him they couldn't keep it see to get people to understand you can't save yourself you've got to surrender eternal life comes by surrender Christ will give it to you but you've got to let him hallu so it was in sincere people who desire to have it in writing and and and just as in the days of Samuel there were make Believers of Jehovah who preferred a mortal King over God being their Divine King you know Joshua having crossed over and he met the captain of the Lord's host and and and what you see God laying out to Joshua after he met the captain of the Lord's host and he said now here's what you're going to do here's your battle tactic here's your first Target and don't worry if you follow my instructions this is going to not exist and it's going to you're going to reclaim the land and then after that there'll be another one and another one and another one because I am giving you this land that's the only people I know of in history in all the world are are the children of Abraham who the creator of the world says I'm going to give you a piece of my world and I'm actually going to deed it to you they're the only people I know everybody says oh it's our nation and you go all the way back to Native Americans saying oh it our well who gave gave it to us who gave it to you well who gave it to them I only know of one group that the Creator who built it said I'll give it to you and and God warns them for years decades and even centuries get out of it my people are sojourning they're going to be in PR in slavery for 400 years but I'm going to bring them out you better clear out and then this people say oh God was so cruel he killed those people that he warned them for 400 years get off of Abraham's property the eviction is going to be painful just leave and they dug in defying God just like Sinners do today it's my body It's My Life I'll do what I want who told you that who told you it was your body in your life did you build it can you keep it alive can you keep the air going and can you keep your heart going you have nothing you owe God everything you owe him the breath in your lungs if it wasn't for God you'd have nothing Hallelujah so it's it's it's it's even so what is Joshua given Joshua is given instructions how to begin to build Israel the gift that God gave to Abraham and his descendants what is God doing he's showing him do it this way do it that way take this have that move here go there put this tribe there put this tribe there put this tribe there put this tribe there put this tribe uh put put put Caleb up here no Caleb wants this mountain okay put Caleb over here and give him this mountain and and and you know what God was doing he's building a larger Eden he's rebuilding Eden what do you think the word is in this hour he's rebuilding Eden we're rebuilding Eden that's why the word has came oh be a believer of it today it'll rebuild everything that could ever be wrong in your lives and homes it was insincere people like achen who remain steeped in the what I call the miseries of humanism humanism and reasoning of God's word thank God people like aen didn't stop people like Joshua thank God there was aens but there was still believers there was aens but the Israel still conquered Hallelujah it will not prevent the Bride of the last day either mark that down it will not stop her so so can we see this God of love in Eden brother Bram tells the story so so tenderly so beautifully how that you know God coming down you remember God coming coming down every evening to he said he would take his children he'd come down to visit them did you enjoy your day in the beautiful world today yes Father oh it was so beautiful we were along the ridge line and we went down and and and and we saw this and that oh my that's wonderful I I I've built it all for you I I rule the heavens I'm I I'm going to this is just the beginning children this is just the start we're going to build a whole Kingdom we're in this together and he said he would now lay down and he would lay them down at night give them a little kiss on the cheek you know and good night I'll see you tomorrow off to sleep they would go Eve roll over lay and and on on Adam's chest and he would stroke her beautiful hair and they would just Drift Off to Sleep all was beautiful all was peaceful all was so So Divine it was it was a model it was just God getting started to build a Holy Kingdom a holy economy let me tell you something friends the eye hath not seen the ear has not heard it's never into the heart of man what God has in store for them that love him how that how that he he cared about them he shows them his love he shows them his care he Prophet said he had them fortified behind the word they were they were taught moral in no uncertain terms this you can partake of this you can't don't have anything to do with it and the the amazing thing was that Satan in the Garden of Eden as we were saying Wednesday Ezekiel saw him as a man and and and and typed him as a king and said you have been in Eden and you had all these precious stones and you were beautiful until sin was found in you and so audacious so audacious was Lucifer that he built his office right next to the to Christ's office right in the midst of the garden right in the headquarters right in the hub right in the center don't think he's not trying to do that to you don't think he's not trying to crowd in and move the Lord out of your life and out of your home and then you can start reasoning the word of God and he's going to tell you oh you'll be a lot happier you the Lord knows that you know you don't really have to do all these things there's no need to limit yourself be who you want to be do you go for it see and so he but God made it very clear morals Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not do this Thou shalt not lie sh not steal sh not kill all these different things these morals are taught in Eden they didn't get invented at horb at sini you see so so the love of God is in Eden the moral teaching of God there's no ambiguous wording about what trees were good and which trees were forbidden you know the the the world uh you know stayed upright as long as his family followed the word and as soon as they didn't that broke the world broke the whole world see so one would imagine that being told something to the face by God in person you would think that that that would prevent even the hardest heart from transgression but not so they were told to the face by God in person I have to look at that and and comfort myself in a strange weird way when I I stand up here and pour my life out for almost three decades and preach it as hard as I can quote it out of the scripture quote it out of the message and yet I see an uh and I'm not worried about transgression I don't I don't track wins and losses because I got those I don't I don't I don't keep a there's no record at my house of your W and L columns wins and losses and I wouldn't want you I hope you don't keep one on me because I probably have more losses than wins and that'd probably be the truth that that's not what I'm talking about I'm not talking about transgressions I'm talking about unwilling Hearts who are simply unwilling to let the whole word govern their lives and they don't mind 90% of it but they're determined to have that 10% of their own say their own way their own will amen and so I say well goodness if Adam and Eve were told to the face by God in person and they didn't do it what chance do I have but I still got to preach it amen God told them to the face in person you shall not do this but reasoning is a powerful weapon against the word of God want to say that again friends I got it highlighted on to say it reasoning is a powerful weapon against the world word of God am Satan knows that if he can get you to reason the word of God water it down and maybe it doesn't matter quite as much as the pastor says maybe it's not all that incumbent upon me after all the prophet was just a man he had his own opinions I don't necessarily those are the people that I fear for for on Resurrection morning cuz I don't know how you'll get the word to come up if you've never obeyed come out and you've never fully surrendered say but the Lord can do it he can I'm just saying I fear for you I'm not talking about transgressions I'm talking about an unwillingness to let Christ be the center an unwillingness to let the message message that God ha sent you be the the dictation of God's voice for your life and your homes and your marriages and your children fair enough I have not sh to declare unto you the whole counsel of God I can't get up on that morning and know that I held back and maybe it was partly my fault can't do that friends I love you but I love the word more than you Hallelujah reason in is a powerful weapon against the word even the revealed word it has doomed the most noble of humanity yet it has been the path to uh to failure even for the family of God I've seen it people who I know have had an experience with the Lord I know they have maybe multiple experien with the Lord and they're Believers for real they're not make Believers they're True Believers but that that area of reasoning of the word where they won't come to a full complete surrender I've seen it be be a path of failure and a path of destruction and and I'm telling you that there's no way to escape getting down the road Without Regrets I just made up my mind I'm done with regrets I do failing but I quickly repent I I try my best I strive I press daily cuz I don't want any more regrets do you see friends how vulnerable you are I mean even with I mean to say nothing without the Holy Ghost even with the Holy Ghost yet you refuse to lay aside weights and sins Paul said as I said to you Wednesday when Paul said lay aside the weights and sins that do so easily beset you run this race Paul wasn't talking to Sinners he was talking to Believers see we should never be without Holiness Holiness was embedded in the love of God all the way back to the Eden story I'm G to tell you something friends God's God's heart is first broken at Eden at the gates of Eden that's where God had his first heartbreak was at the gates of Eden when you look at the strict guidelines uh that we find in Exodus and Leviticus and Deuteronomy those three particularly these guidelines against immoral behavior that are outlined in those three books particularly they also had a secondary purpose that they served they they were they were designed to reflect and and of course they were they were God said keep this so that it may be well with thee in long life and I'll bless thee all of that but it but it had a secondary uh application and that is that that they were used that that the the statutes Israel by being able to read them and then they could look at what they were and then they could look everywhere in all the Heathen Nations around them and they could see by what they read vers versus what they see then they know that there's a reflection in the word of what's out there am God is saying don't be immoral don't be vile don't be ungodly don't be sinful don't do this don't do that don't do this that when they read that it's like looking in a mirror they can go wow why is he saying all of that to us we're his chosen people because partly it's reflecting what's all around them this is exactly why Israel was supposed to be a beacon God dropped a holy nation right down in the center of idolatry right down in the middle o of Eastern mysticism and said now I want you to be a Shining Light so that when the world over here in their heathenism looks at that they'll be attracted there's a better way there's a better way there was a better way Ruth Ruth saw a better way the moabitas she she didn't want to go back to her her her Moab she said your God will be my god oh Hallelujah your home will be my home where you live I'll live where you die I'll die why because Naomi was a beacon a Shining Light of Purity um where's my Gizmo all right let's let's have let's have that now almost home part two Hallelujah all right let me just keep up with myself now I've built this PowerPoint in a funny way I've built it on purpose to go really slow really slow because I want what you're going to read to sink in we start in the church age book Revelation chapter 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ now you're about to read the words that God's singular Vindicated proven to be prophet of the age says going slow I want that to sink in there's no arguing with the one God sends that's right he sends him to stop argument he sends him to to put down debate he sends him to Vanquish reasoning see in Revelation 153 it says and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy Works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways Thou King of saints that's a pretty wonderful scripture I'm glad he's king of saints ready for the next one do you see it the lamb the high priest holding his blood as an atonement on The Mercy Seat for our sins is the Lord God Almighty am we could just go home that right there that is his present office don't let anyone tell you he's not still interceding for sins that is his present office that is what he is doing now pleading his blood for our sins everybody say hallelujah hallelujah thank God but one day that lamb will become the lion of the tribe of Judah he will come forth in power and glory and take his authority to reign as king he is the coming king of this Earth of course that does not say he is not King now for he is our king king of saints right now it is a spiritual kingdom are you keeping up you with me me right we found out who he is what he's doing what his purpose is what what's up that's what's up right now it's a spiritual Kingdom you with me not going too fast am I it is not of this world system it is not of this world system amen what what's not the spiritual Kingdom that we're a part of right it's not of this world system even as we are not of this world there's no ambiguity there that's as clear as it can even be said I I I mean grammarly couldn't even improve on that it is not of this world system what's not our spiritual Kingdom our King even as we are not of this world that's the reason that's the reason that there's a reason yes say oh you people are mad there's a method to this madness that's the reason we act different from the world we do sure why because we're not of it what are we part of a spiritual Kingdom what is that about there's a king he's our father and we're here in service to him I didn't start here I'm not finishing here my life is not about here my life is about there this life only counts if you get to live it eternally what's life even worth if you don't live eternally it's a few days in full of trouble it's hardship and heartache and pain what's it worth if you don't get to live eternally in a Happy Land with no stress and no taxes and no anxiety and no bad neighbors and no loud music and no traffic rage and no government no nothing Hallelujah nothing to worry about no sorrow to be sorry for that's the reason we act different from the world I can only conclude when people who are supposed to be Believers act like the world they either don't realize they're part of a kingdom or they don't want to be part of the Kingdom I don't know maybe they come here CU they just like me maybe they like the way sister Debbie dresses me maybe they like the way brother Anthony sings I don't know it's a great singing Sister Debbie does a good job our citizenship it ain't here it's in heaven I'm so glad to hear y'all pulling we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth where Jesus is the king see just like Israel they were to be a reflection to the world we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth where Jesus is the king that is poetry that is so beautiful that just rolls off the tongue we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth where Jesus is the king why are y'all so different why why are y'all so weird why are yall so not like everybody else who wants it who wants to be that Jesus will let you be honest if you just want to say I don't really want to be but I want to be that is why oh there's a reason yeah that's why our women do not dress in men's clothing or cut their hair or use all those cosmetics and other things that the world likes so much there's a reason sisters born of the Holy Spirit don't do those things because they don't want to do those things the world wants to do those things because they're not Sisters in Christ they're human beings they could become Sisters in Christ if you'd witnessed to them correctly I I if if your life didn't conflict with your testimony if your life matched your testimony come on what good is what good is your lip service if your life don't match it how you going to witness to somebody in this community and they go do you see what you're saying versus what you are if if what y'all have is the truth then why does uh you know that's that is why our men don't drink and smoke and carry on in sin there's a reason for it our Dominion I love it is the dominion over sin I'm not under it and I'm not in a treaty with it I'm not alongside it I'm not compromising I'm not sitting in its camp and it's not in my Camp I have a dominion over sin it is enforced through the power that is in the spirit of Christ that indwells us every Kingdom on Earth is going to be torn down but ours will remain ours will remain Hallelujah who want to be a part of that Kingdom you give me about 15 more minutes I got two more slides I want three more slides I want to show you so our commission from the Lord is to reflect this reality to the Fallen World so you say what what reality that the Spirit uh that we that we manifest is the spirit of our rebirth we actually demonstrate to them we actually demonstrate to them that there is another actual world besides this one and it's real and it and and it's a reflection we are to be a reflection of that higher life saywell you know we got nice smiley people and wholesome values and we pay our taxes and we don't lie and cheat the Mormons do the same thing put some of you to shame don't even get me started on the Amish it's not about that friends it's about a complete reflection of the Holiness that started in the Garden of Eden it ought to be more on display now that the world is further away from it and more perverted and more Twisted we are to have such a display of Holiness on purpose a willingness to lay aside the weights and sins that beset us and Skip walk this race jog this race run this race because our duty as commissioned by the Lord is to Showcase did you know you are a showcase to Showcase this corrupt world the essence of the world that we are reborn into we must and I'm being very careful on my notes I thought what I want to say very carefully we must exhibit to them that there exists a different world a world that is as real as this one and even more real our aim is to re why I am a believer why I am a preacher why I constantly put it on you because our aim why do we have a church our aim is to reflect the superior way of living while down here consider the contradiction just for a moment stop don't think about Walmart or the NFL just just stop consider the contradiction that arises from God's plan and how confusing it is to The Sinner if your clothing your speech your behavior do not reflect does not reflect the spirit of the world that you were reborn into but instead resembles the outside world that you are meant to stand apart from think of the contradiction this is exactly where Israel stood all those centuries ago Moses read to them the law from Mount SII and the outside world was filled with sin perversion and idolatry and you just have to wonder my goodness how had Humanity who had started in such Perfection how did it get that way my you know this is exactly why God wanted Israel to be a loudspeaker this exactly why he wanted them to be a beacon he wanted them to be a public address system he wanted them to be a living example to the world a living example of another world 2,000 years from Noah to Jesus found Israel steeped in failure in this Mission even picking up great men like Abraham and David and Elijah and finally John and now 2,000 years from Jerusalem to leoda uh the New Testament Church has once again failed Christ has found her as an adulterous woman she is a living catastrophe even picking up Great Men along the way like Paul and Luther and Wesley are our early fathers of the auser Revival finally the Pentecostal movement itself which of course has now sits in complete ruin today Mega Ministries all these Mega Ministries like we've been talking about the the hill song Global Hillsong Church movement the shameful tele evangelists who fly around in their Lear Jets until one gets a little low on gas and they switch to their other Lear Jet and and they live in homes that almost look like Royal palaces and they tell people God told me to buy this jet that's a flat lie I mean listen friends it's nonsense even even the Asberry Revival is proof of this oh I said it oh I said it the Asberry Revival is not a move of the holy spirit it's a move of a spirit I don't deny that but you still got you still got bobbed haired women with all kinds of Jezebel makeup wearing blue jeans with hands in the air praising God singing songs that is the Antichrist system you've got men who drink and cuss and then get in the pull pit and commit adultery outside of it that is the Antichrist system we don't believe in it we don't stand for it we are the pure unadulterated Bride of the Lord Jesus [Applause] Christ professing to be the church they do they you know a prophet saw them naked dancing in a in an example so vulgar Prophet said I had to turn my head I couldn't even look at you say well brother Jason I don't see it that way well firstly uh brother brandham didn't see something he was shown something that's the first thing he didn't see something he didn't come back and tell us what he saw he said I was shown a preview of The Bride doubt it all you want to but I would simply point out that you don't have the angel of the Lord standing over your shoulder showing it to you because he was showing it to him because I don't care how you see it that's how God sees it God sees it as naked idolatry dancing and vulgar but the bride had to come in preview one more time and there came a group of sainted little girls smooth clean marching to the step of the Gospel this the entire advantage of a prophet he's an oracle he's a human vessel that the almighty God speaks through how do you know the true ones from the false ones because he speaks to according to all the word absolutely that's what a true prophet he speaks according to all the word and all the pro true prophets before him signs and wonders and prophecies are just there to attract your attention friends but it's the word that is the test it's the word that comes through those chosen vessels God's God's word is committed to them in a supernatural way to change you you to change you into the version of the Living Word that's why it comes there's no way for you to do it to yourself see so why why do you think they don't follow the decency and morality teachings of William Bren because they they don't believe he was that vessel sent by God to declare how the Holy Ghost feels about their condition they don't believe it so I just say today whose side are you on there's no middle ground sir Moses said all who are on the Lord's Side come to me and all who are not stay with Dayan see and that didn't end well for daythan or his family or his children or his cattle or anybody I mean was was William brandham the angel the tour guide the prophet from the future who stood there and showed John who the was was that him or was it not see it it's really comes down it's that simple either it was him or it wasn't him and John tried to worship him he refused it said I'm one of the prophets he's a prophet from the future see so no wonder we say the heart that broke on Calvary is heartbroken with grief at the gates of Eden first oh that clock wow what an enemy I never preach long so can I just keep going a little bit come on y'all all right I I Don't Preach long let me not make a joke about that either I'm not going to out our other preachers but I Don't Preach long brother brandom describe and I'm not going to preach long today but I'm not going to be able to keep that 15-minute promise I want to show you two more slides Amen brother brandham describes him running through the garden when word reached God that his children had fallen he didn't send an angel he didn't send a message J he did he said he came himself the desperate search and we could have never known this it had not had a prophet with prophetic insight to to describe to us the desperate search for his fallen family brother Ram says in the message The Prodigal 1950 and here he was searching walking running up and down through the garden screaming for his Lost Boy the f father hunting searching for the son it should have been the son searching for the father and today it's just the same just as soon as a man sins and instead of coming out and confessing his sins before God he'll try to get back he'll try to hide behind something he'll try to get a self-made religion brother R says in 1916 in having conferences when God knew that shocking state of emergency I suppose the first first ever come to heaven was when he heard that his children was lost and he came frantically up and down through the garden he went looking under every Bush Adam oh my son Adam Where Art Thou you know he's when God judged the case he he didn't he didn't apologize or admit to a poor design God wasn't it wasn't some poor design it was heartbreak his heart was broken from Wednesday we read for you about the change of fashion moving from Paris in the early part of the 20th century and moving to Hollywood and in the early part of the 20th century and how that brother Brandon prophesied that God would sink Hollywood a mile beneath the ocean never said he would sink Paris Paris will meet its own its own demise in whatever way God chooses but he said Hollywood he would sink Hollywood a mile beneath the ocean the first motion picture Studio did you know was not actually on the west coast it wasn't in California at all it was actually on the east coast in New Jersey and it was actually built for science the world's first Film Production Studio was a studio called black Maria which was completed in 1893 on the grounds of Edison's Laboratories in West Orange New Jersey the studio was built for the purpose of making film strips for the uh kinetoscope which was invented by Thomas Edison and his assistant William Dickinson this is the earliest Motion Pictures were shot inside the black Maria using natural sunlight to film the roof of the black Maria was cranked open to admit the light and the entire Studio rotated on Wheels 15° every hour to track the Sun is automated it stayed stayed with the moving of the Sun the the black Maria was a tar paper covered dark studio room with a retractable roof cost 600 bucks yeah and in their $637 to build the first now watch this so the the the reason it was invented was for progress and Science and invention so Med could test his new Contraption the industrial uh uh Revolution was underway men shall run to and fro and knowledge shall increase that's the prophecy of the end time that mankind would get wiser but weaker so but of course Satan's never going to let it stay there soon as Edison proved it's working and they got a studio then right away Satan sees his chance see and so we find that the world's first Film Production he says it that it was uh the first motion pictures made in the black Maria were deposited for copyright by Dickinson at the Library of Congress in 1893 the first films shot at the black Maria included segments of magic shows then plays then vaev dancers and strong in then they even started showing you know the the the the big circus act of Wild Bill Cody and and and the wild west show and then various boxing matches and then fights and then scantily clad women the actual first movie studio in California was a established by a man by the name of C polyscope from Chicago he built it in Edendale Los Angeles in 1910 the first movie studio in Hollywood opened in 1912 however it was not until 1915 that many major Motion Picture companies relocated to Hollywood from the East Coast as the lightning travels from the East unto the West so shall it be your SE being a coalescing starts on the East Coast with an invention now they're building it it's not in Hollywood exactly but it's in on the west coast but now it's going to be in Hollywood and now everybody's moving to Hollywood and now the Fashions are starting to be now we're not going to Paris anymore this is the first part of the 20th century 1912 1912 was the year of the Bob when women started cutting their hair they never used to do that Christian Church taught against women cutting their hair for 2 th000 almost 2,000 years but the modern day they started bobbing off their hair is a sign of Independence this is the truth this is historical and and when you and then by 1915 they're all starting to group in there together and now the trend is starting to change now let me let me let me lift you up out of history and take you into prophecy can I do that for just five minutes you you find that under the fourth trumpet which governed the politics of the world because it's got to get Israel home the trumpets are about Israel you've you've got the sun won't shine anymore and the Moon is darken and the Stars won't give their light and brother Brandon breaks that down to show that's the backsliding of the church it's starting to go the sun's not shining the the the church is going dark the Stars aren't shining sons of God who are supposed to shine and then what happens right around the turn of the century what what does God do to counter that because when the enemy comes in like a flood he raises a standard and while that's happening in the world God brings uh some some old Pentecostal fathers and and they come to isusa Street to the apostolic mission on isua Street in in Los Angeles California and they're going to have the isua Revival and God breaks it out prophet's not even on the scene he's not even born yet and God now is going to bring his last movement to the church and he's holding one star in his right hand waiting and then the fifth trumpet begins to commence and when a fifth trumpet starts because now what's it doing it's all about getting Israel home so it starts changing world events remember the seals are for the bride the trumpets are for the Jews you've got wo and you've got vials and every time a trumpet sounds a vial partially a judgment a trumpet partially opens a vile judgment partially opens that's why when you read you know under the Sixth trumpet where it's dries up the river Euphrates under the Sixth vial it's a plague that strikes the Euphrates so they run hand in hand you you got me you're with me I don't want to go too fast so now you're at 19 now you're at at 197 1910 1912 1915 you've got a coalescing of Hollywood it's starting to pull from Paris and women are starting to Bob their hair and then you come under the fifth trumpet and under the fifth vial and what happens under the fifth trumpet you have a star falling from heaven and a prophet takes it back to Isaiah and says oh Lucifer son of the morning how how Thou Art fallen from Heaven which did weaken the Nations so you've got Lucifer now and he's what is he doing he's been released down into the Earth and he's given a set of keys he hasn't had in his hand since Calvary he's got keys to hell to the bottomless pit Jesus had had them for 2,000 years said now I've got to start moving things along so here you go go down into the world I need it to be more evil than it is and he falls from heaven with a key to the bottomless pit and opens the bottomless pit and when brother Brandon picks that up he says the lid has come off of Heaven and demon powers are streaming into the Earth and then immediately what do you have you have the First wall the second wall the third wall you've got a fifth vial coming down and and and it says that out of this pit rose up these creatures that they they look like scorpions but they they had long hair like women and Stingers in their tails and they looked like lions and they flew and they they tormented and a prophet said notice that they had long hair to torment the women who had cut theirs off they'd only cut theirs off recently in 1912 and now you've got this fifth trumpet and a fifth vial breaking and now you've got the lid torn from hell and demon powers are going to make the world more evil because now we got to come to world war never happened there's got to be way more evil in the world or it's never going to get pulled pulled it off you understand this just off top of my head I hope you you're staying up I can't I can't take too much time and so so then what what does that mean to torment the women because in 1914 the first woe breaks onto the Earth and what does it start World War I and what happens to those women they lose 116,000 of their husbands and their sons to the first woe and the ones who came home injured and diseased were three times that and right as World War I is ending because had it not the first one would have went one two three and we'd have been an armagedon by 1920 and God couldn't let that happen he hadn't even open the seals yet he's got to keep everything moving at the same time and if one runs out ahead he says now we got to drop back and wait for all this other to catch up this is real time this is happening you're living in the coming of the Lord and so he so now we we find that that what happens is at the end of the the woe because why does it stop because it stops in 1918 on the 11th month the 11th day of the of the 11th month and the 11th Hour of the 11th uh day of the 11th month because it's got to get the 11th Hour worker that Jesus spoke of and there's got to be a last bride who returns back to the faith of the original oh my that's where we are friends and God sent forth a prophet to accomplish that and dare we minimalize you think all this stuff is an accident you think God sent an opinion down into the Earth nonsense what God is doing is controlling Nations and you want to disqualify Propet because of a bridge or a bear really that is so ignorant my goodness I know what the word has done to my life I give this message the word test I know what it's done to me on and at the end of 1918 because God stopped it the historically they still to this day I don't know who stopped it Kaiser wilham said publicly I never stopped it the king of England I never stopped it well who stopped it well we just stopped God stopped it but because that the judgments weren't finished right at the end of 1918 the first influenza pandemic Falls because it's coming from the fifth vial and 30 million people die amen and of all the deaths of American GIS more than half half of them died of that plague they weren't shot they were diseased these are the things that God has been maneuvering and unfolding as we go and then I don't have time to run it all the way out to the end it's a whole lesson but then a prophet comes on the scene born out of season God had already spoke to him way back here as a boy while he's working in Europe while these things are happening and then the then the six trumpet sounds and then the sixth vial releases partially because it's all going to be fullness in the tribulation none of it's fullness now and then what happens it strikes the riv Euphrates and six and 200 million demon Chargers are released to go after Hitler nikman and go after the Jews you see friends this stuff you can't make that up this stuff hits perfect this stuff hits on all cylinders I'm here to tell you what God has done in this hour is almost mindblowing I have time to doubt it I'm trying to believe every word of it I want to see where it places me and positionally and what it tells me is that I am the Spotless Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and there's Authority once again under the opening of the seventh seal there's Authority in the Church of Christ while the world has gone off into darkness and the Heathen rages against it let him rage the Heathen will always rage let him rage I'm going to scroll down to my last point and this is at these I want to show you these slides did you ever know that from the Apostolic Faith Mission on isua street they actually had the exact number that from the Apostolic Faith Mission on isua street in Los Angeles in 1907 did you ever know that from that mission to Hollywood is exactly seven miles I double verified it and you know how how our map systems are these days Google or Apple whoever it is it'll give you like the middle one will say this is your beline and then if you want to go around this way and up some back streets you might shave a tenth off if you go this way you'll add a couple of tents depending on you know you can take your pick you choose which one but the center one always comes up seven miles exactly and in this one 69 and 66 I did another one and it was 69 and 72 depends on which way you want to go but the beline route that both Maps recommend if you want to go from where the mission was where they where where they called the fire department because the neighbors thought the building was engulfed in flames wow that's a historical fact they called the fire department the fire department came and found a building engulfed in flames only when they looked closely it wasn't on fire at all but it was glowing and lighting the heavens and it's seven miles and at this time Hollywood Studios don't even exist yet they're just on the East Coast it hasn't made it West yet it hasn't it hasn't come to 1912 yet the woes haven't started yet but it's seven miles exactly to Hollywood I'm going to tell you something friends you think of a prophet now just think for a moment and a prophet said he said I near the end of his ministry he said I have went up and down the Coastline of California year after year after year and every time I come back it gets worse you think of God running up and down the Garden of Eden crying for a son think of a prophet running up and down the coastline as brother brandham describes God running up and down the Garden of Eden crying Adam Adam here he is now here is a prophet now on the west coast it's all come back full circle it started at isua it went around the world seven times and it's coming back and a prophet says he'll sink Hollywood a mile beneath the ocean here is a prophet up and down the coastline of California the last I want to say this clearly hear me the last line of defense it's it's it's moved Westward and backed up and backed up and the Christian Church kept backsliding and kept backsliding till finally she's at the coast she can't go any further you go beyond here and you go east again and brother brandom says it's walled up and the sin and the perversion are all stagnated right there along that Coastline and here's a prophet he's standing on the last line of defense before the love of God is overrun by the enemy completely and the nation is sealed away to its Doom the world has come full circle Back to Where it All Began in the last stage at isua Street seven miles from Hollywood and brother brandham finishes with this there stood Adam and Eve with their fig leaves sewed together behind a bush father I wish you'd go home and play the tape this I'm going to try to emulate as close I can to brother Brandon he's so heartbroken father going back and forth screaming where are you where are you that same God goes up and down the aisles night after night screaming the same thing where art thou Where Art Thou listen friends not Adam I don't know where you are where are you hiding God knew right where he was it's not that it's Adam how did you get here how did this happen to you you you were perfect I had everything how did you arrive at such a place in your life oh Adam my son my son you weren't made for this I made you as an amateur God you were going to rule the galaxies with me we were starting a civilization we were building a kingdom I'm here to tell you God is calling you and I back to that original creation God is calling us back Eden is being rebuilt and Adam and Eve are being restored Hallelujah friends and you can't stop it prophecy is unwinding today Hallelujah it fell by a loss of faith in the word he's building it back by the perfect word come Anthony bring your team he's building it back by a perfect word a restored Faith by rest restored word and a restored people say brother Jason how do you know it'll work it's already been tested it was tested in Jesus he said destroy this temple in three days I'll build it back oh friends it's already been tested stand to your feet with me God and the day and hour that we live in has once again I I I just want to say this last closing statement again God how did it fall by that powerful devious weapon of reasoning God's word doesn't mean what it says it's not incumbent upon me it's just his opinion I don't really have to do that that same reasoning is trying like crazy to prevent this bride see the second Adam's already been restored now all he's got to do is get the second Eve restored and so how does how did he build the first one by his word how's he building the second one restoring his original word not a new word not a new word there is not one thing we teach that's new outside of the Bible amen everything we're teach teaching is only in the scripture it's just a re restoration of the teaching that's all the message is say what is the message what God said he would do what does that mean he'd restore the word and he did what does that mean means that he's given you a way home if you want it he he won't force it on you and if you want to reason it away you'll do that at your own Peril but I cannot help but declare the whole counsel of God bow your heads with me me all over the building Lord thank you that I'd like to thank you for your grace to me thank you for your anointing on the word I'd like to thank you for these people who have been so very patient and allowed me the extra time I needed to finish this series I wanted to I felt in my heart I should I want to thank you I pray you reward them for their patience and their pull on the the word of God today lord it's not unnoticed by me or you and many words were said today quite a few and it'll definitely take the anointing of the Holy Spirit Lord you know I'm just a man all I can do is preach it and live it and try to be the best example of it I can it's ultimately Lord up to the individual whether they will accept your mercy or whether they won't you you won't force them to but I I know that you will compel them you will you will convict their hearts you will you said that that that when you come you would convince the world of sin you would convince them that they need a savior that they can't get home on their own they're hopelessly in chaos because of the way they were born they're born wrong come into the world wrong you're trying to turn everything back around you're trying to restore it back by the spoken word to the spoken word that's the only way that life ever did come that's the only way the Earth got built that's the only way that Mercy was ever extended was through your word it doesn't come any other way there's no works we can do there's no Deeds everybody in this building could go from here today and keep everything that I've said today to the letter it still wouldn't do it they've got to be born again they've got to receive Christ in into their heart and then he will make the changes in them Lord I pray today that you will make it that real May the people see Lord that just as prophecy they can't deny it I all I did was lay out the prophecies out of the Bible and overlay it with history that everybody knows happened what's to deny where where's the room for denial if you did all of that how are you not doing all of this if you sent us a message that opened all of that up and opened our eyes and we understand it and we see our position in Christ then how in the world would we not trust it to get us home how would we not be ready willing to go forward and obey every word of God I pray today for all of those under the sound of my voice here in this live audience th across the airwaves live or maybe at a later time through a recording I pray that same holy spirit that anoints me will anoint them may it be so father I hope today was eye openening I hope today the nail clenched I hope I I I got the point across finally after 10 messages 10 installments on one single thought I pray Lord that you'll make it a reality we commit it to your Comm this audience Lord into your hands you're very capable hands you the only one that can help them and I've did my duty
