[7:53] He'll be the same tomorrow, too.
[7:58] Amen. Brother Jackson, in a request for
[8:00] a friend of his that worked with, his
[8:01] name is Harry Cruz, and he went to the
[8:03] hospital this morning, and they found a
[8:06] brain tumor. So, he wanted the church to
[8:08] remember him before the Lord.
[8:12] I don't know if I'm doing that, but um
[8:15] stop it.
[8:18] Anyway, praise the Lord. I have
[8:21] testimony. You know, I I was having some
[8:23] pretty serious issues with my back and
[8:25] my um sciatic nerve and stuff, and I'm
[8:29] I've actually been feeling really well
[8:31] last three nights or so. I've been able
[8:33] to stay in bed through the whole night.
[8:36] Usually, I'd wake up about 2:30, 3:00 in
[8:40] the morning. and I have to go sit in a
[8:41] chair for the rest of the evening
[8:42] because it would get really bad if I
[8:45] stayed in bed. But that's a little
[8:48] testimony. If you have a request upon
[8:50] your heart this evening,
[8:52] Amen. This is prayer meeting night.
[8:55] Amen.
[8:58] God is good and he's not dead. Let's
[9:00] pray.
[9:01] Lord, I love you. Regardless of what I
[9:04] go through, Father, the ups and downs of
[9:07] life,
[9:09] Lord, you're still the same yesterday,
[9:11] today, forever, encouraging me,
[9:14] helping me, tell me to press the battle,
[9:19] and then give me strength and courage to
[9:21] do that.
[9:23] I pray you bless your people this
[9:25] evening. Remember Harry Cruz, a friend
[9:27] of our brother. Lord,
[9:29] Father, we pray that
[9:32] you would touch this tumor.
[9:35] We just specifically pray right now that
[9:38] I ask that the Holy Spirit, your word
[9:40] says you're the God that heals all our
[9:42] diseases, Father,
[9:45] that we pinpoint on this tumor and Harry
[9:47] Cruz, Father,
[9:49] in the name of Jesus Christ, that you
[9:51] would fully recover him from this,
[9:53] Father. Take this thing away, Lord. We
[9:57] thank you for our brother Joe that's
[9:58] with us this evening. Pray that you
[10:01] would bless them and strengthen them.
[10:02] Father, help the medical team realize
[10:05] what they need to do and pray that you
[10:07] would bless their hands as they would do
[10:09] that.
[10:11] Lord, as we collect the tithes and
[10:12] offerings, we pray that you would just
[10:14] magnify it to your kingdom. Bless the
[10:17] cheerful giver. Father, we're very
[10:19] thankful for what you've done, what
[10:21] you're doing, and what you're going to
[10:24] do. I love you, Father. In Jesus
[10:27] Christ's name I pray. Amen.

[11:03] their lives

[11:14] [Music]
[11:16] to leave their mark.
[11:23] When life is through,
[11:31] but vain

[12:54] gain.
[12:57] [Music]
[12:59] Inside
[13:01] my heart
[13:06] there burned a question.
[13:14] What was I placed
[13:18] [Music]
[13:21] on this earth
[13:24] for?
[13:25] [Music]
[13:28] It truly
[13:30] was
[13:33] [Music]
[13:35] to build a kingom.
[13:41] [Music]
[13:42] Not of my own,
[13:49] but of the Lord.

[14:03] [Music]
[14:04] to count for Jesus.
[14:09] [Music]

[15:56] Amen.
[15:58] Let's all stand. Thank you, Sister Dad.
[16:02] I'm going to try and sing this song
[16:03] here. We were practicing in the back and
[16:06] I really felt
[16:09] the Lord wants us to sing this song.
[16:12] We're going to change the order of the
[16:13] service over and uh invite the minister
[16:16] to come now.

[21:54] [Music]
[21:59] I
[22:01] will adore you.
[22:04] [Music]
[22:11] Amen.
[22:21] While you're standing,
[22:24] if you have your Bibles, let's turn to
[22:25] Revelations.
[22:27] Thank you. Let's turn to Revelations
[22:32] chapter 8
[22:35] verse 12.
[22:43] [Music]
[22:45] And the fourth angel sounded, and the
[22:47] third part of the sun was smitten, and
[22:50] the third part of the moon, and the
[22:51] third part of the stars, so as the third
[22:54] part of them was darkened. And the day
[22:58] shone not for a third part of it, and
[23:00] the night likewise. And I beheld and
[23:03] heard an angel flying through the midst
[23:05] of heaven, saying with a loud voice,
[23:06] "Wo, wo, wo to the inhabiters of the
[23:10] earth by reason of the other voices of
[23:13] the trumpet of the three angels which
[23:15] are yet to sound." Let's bow our heads.
[23:18] Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so thankful
[23:21] to be gathered here in this house of
[23:24] worship that's set aside and dedicated,
[23:26] Lord, for us to come and to worship you,
[23:29] Lord, and to hear the word brought
[23:31] forth. And Father, we just pray, dear
[23:34] Lord, that every person that's coming
[23:36] here tonight, Lord, has come expecting,
[23:38] Lord, not to hear something from me,
[23:40] Lord, but to hear from you. And God, I
[23:42] just pray that for your anointing, dear
[23:44] Lord, that it would just anoint me to
[23:46] speak and anoint the the congregation,
[23:49] Lord, to receive it. And Father, we're
[23:51] just looking forward to see what you're
[23:53] going to tell us tonight, dear God. We
[23:55] love you and we thank you. In Jesus name
[23:57] we pray. Amen.
[23:59] Amen.
[23:59] Man, you can be seated.
[24:02] Certainly good to be back. We It's like
[24:04] we've been traveling. Um,
[24:07] too much.
[24:08] Too much.
[24:10] Well, I'll let him tell it. Can y'all
[24:12] hear me? Okay.
[24:13] Y
[24:13] Okay. Praise the Lord. Yeah. We've been
[24:15] traveling um quite a bit and and uh
[24:19] ministered down in Panama City and um
[24:22] Brother Michael and uh Gonzalez and his
[24:25] wife were there and um then we were up
[24:27] in um Hagerstown, Indiana, and then the
[24:30] Cobs were there. So, we're like, well,
[24:32] we just take everybody where we go. So,
[24:34] that's all right. It it's good to have
[24:36] home folks
[24:38] kind of rooting for you when you're up
[24:39] there. So that's that's real good. But
[24:42] um so we're we're happy to be here um
[24:45] tonight and and we had great services um
[24:49] uh especially in Florida and and Indian
[24:51] Indiana. Um and we were up in New York
[24:54] just uh my goodness, it seems like we've
[24:56] been everywhere um in the last month. So
[24:58] that was a great time. Uh I probably
[25:00] haven't even told you about everything
[25:01] that happened up there, but that was
[25:03] just a great time with brother Carryon.
[25:06] um just a wonderful group of people and
[25:09] really love the Lord and I tell you
[25:10] what, they'll just pull you to death. Um
[25:13] if you ever preach for them up there. So
[25:15] um just a wonderful group of people.
[25:17] Love the Lord. Same with uh um Brother
[25:20] Cobb's church there and then also in
[25:23] Florida. Just had a wonderful time and
[25:25] um just just glad to be home though for
[25:27] a little while. Anyway, so what we want
[25:30] to talk about tonight, I'll get right to
[25:32] the service, right to the sermon because
[25:33] we're not going to hold you too long.
[25:35] We've got the uh prayer requests and
[25:37] everything tonight and this is a good
[25:40] oldfashioned prayer meeting we're going
[25:41] to have. But I'm just so glad to be here
[25:44] and just thinking about as I was riding
[25:46] around today and and I seem like I go to
[25:49] so many places and I see so many
[25:51] different things and and I was just
[25:52] thinking in my heart I was just saying
[25:54] Lord just thank you so much for giving
[25:56] me a desire to want to go to church on
[25:58] Wednesday night. give me a desire to
[26:00] want to serve you and and just every
[26:02] moment, every waking hour that I can
[26:04] have when I wake up in the morning, I'm
[26:06] praying. I'm just asking the Lord to
[26:07] help me through the day. At night, I'm
[26:09] just asking, but I wasn't always that
[26:11] way. And maybe some of you might look at
[26:14] at others and say, "Well, they got it
[26:15] all put together. They're they're
[26:17] they're a wonderful Christian. My
[26:20] they're they just I I wish I was like so
[26:22] and so." But let me tell you something.
[26:24] Everybody has trials and everybody has
[26:26] trouble and everybody has to grow. And
[26:29] and I I know one thing. I've I've been
[26:31] on the bottom. I've been so low
[26:33] sometimes I couldn't even I couldn't
[26:35] hardly raise my head up. And even to
[26:37] think I was a Christian. This is after I
[26:39] become a Christian now. So this is like
[26:41] a lot of people maybe you're a new
[26:42] Christian just starting out and you're
[26:43] like, "Woo, this is tough." Well, it can
[26:46] be. It can be. But the way of a
[26:49] transgressor is hard. But the Christian
[26:51] life is joy unspeakable and full of
[26:54] glory. Because no matter what you're
[26:56] going through in life, you might have a
[26:57] trial, you might have a hardship, you
[26:59] might have all kind, but you've got the
[27:01] spirit of God to help you through it if
[27:03] you'll go to him and not go to other
[27:05] things that people are so prone to go to
[27:08] to find that satisfaction, to find that
[27:10] that joy or whatever it might be, a
[27:12] little bit of a peace or a little bit of
[27:14] a of a respit from whatever trial you're
[27:16] going through. And I've preached on that
[27:18] before, but it seems like in this day
[27:20] and time, in this Leodysian church age
[27:22] that we're in, it it's a lukewarm age.
[27:25] It's not hot. It's not cold. It's it's a
[27:27] it's an age where people have money and
[27:29] and the churches are rich and and but
[27:32] yet the Bible tells us that you're you
[27:36] think that you're rich and yes, you're
[27:38] increased with goods,
[27:39] but know it know ye not that you're
[27:41] miserable, blind, wretched, naked, and
[27:44] don't know it. Right. Amen.
[27:46] Because you might have the wealth of
[27:48] this world.
[27:50] Tell you something. I've never seen a
[27:52] hearse, a U-Haul falling a hearse. You
[27:56] can't take it with you. And people put
[27:58] all their trust and all their hopes in
[28:00] money. And they're they're trying to get
[28:01] a little bit more, trying to go get a
[28:03] little bit more wealthy, but they they
[28:05] fail and they leave off of what is the
[28:08] greatest thing that we can do. The Bible
[28:10] tells us what would it profit a man to
[28:12] gain the whole world and lose his soul?
[28:14] doesn't profit you anything. The rich
[28:16] young ruler came to Jesus and you know
[28:18] this this part just struck me when he
[28:21] comes to him and he says good master
[28:23] what must I do to be saved? He said the
[28:26] Bible says he looked on him and he loved
[28:28] him. That's what that's what the Bible
[28:30] says. Jesus looking on the rich young
[28:32] ruler loved him even though he knew what
[28:34] he was going to do. He knew what choice
[28:36] he was going to make. And we go right
[28:39] back to John 3:16. For God so loved the
[28:42] world that he gave his only begotten son
[28:44] that whosoever believeth in him would
[28:46] not perish. Now I know we've we can our
[28:49] most of our Sunday school children can
[28:51] quote that but it's so profound that
[28:53] that's just showing God's love toward
[28:56] us. That was a that was a representation
[28:58] of God on the earth showing his pure
[29:02] love.
[29:04] Now, we know that it's not God's desire
[29:05] that he should perish that all should
[29:07] come to the grace of God, but he does
[29:10] know who will.
[29:12] And so, what what I want to talk about
[29:15] this this evening is as we read here in
[29:17] Revelations,
[29:20] it go.
[29:29] So, we want to talk about in Revelations
[29:31] here, how He says, "And I beh I beheld
[29:36] and heard an angel flying through the
[29:38] midst of heaven saying with a loud
[29:40] voice, wo wo wo to the inhabitants of
[29:43] the earth." Amen. Now we know what
[29:46] brother said about that through the
[29:50] church ages and through the seals of
[29:52] those three woes were three world wars.
[29:55] First world war, second world war and
[29:57] one to come. Now,
[30:02] now what he's talking about here, so
[30:04] there this is a momentous occasion. It's
[30:07] so great if you think about it that the
[30:10] angel in the fourth the fourth angel
[30:13] when he was crying out, he was looking
[30:16] forward to what the other three were
[30:17] going to do.
[30:19] So, it's something that was so momentous
[30:21] and such a calamity. And God always does
[30:24] things in threes if you notice that.
[30:25] Many of you know that. uh father, son,
[30:28] holy ghost. We know you're saved,
[30:30] sanctified, and filled with the Holy
[30:31] Ghost, right? Just three steps, three
[30:33] stages. So God does things in threes.
[30:36] But yet, while the while they're
[30:38] heralding the the onset of this terrible
[30:41] calamity in Revelations and in in the in
[30:45] the world wars, there's also something
[30:47] going on in in the church world
[30:51] that as these as these messengers are
[30:53] breaking forth and they're opening up
[30:55] these seals that they have and they're
[30:57] open and they're coming forth that that
[30:59] this is a this is a uh a third or a a
[31:03] last three stages of the restoration of
[31:06] the church that brother Brandham said
[31:08] this. He said that down in
[31:13] um
[31:15] he said that that it that that it was a
[31:17] perfect church that they that they were
[31:19] absolutely perfect. He said notice and
[31:21] it started out as the original as Jesus
[31:24] said the word of God is a seed that a
[31:26] swer swed and he was the swer. The seed
[31:30] was the word and notice any seed that
[31:32] abides alone never does anything. It's
[31:35] got to fall into the ground to bring
[31:37] forth its production again. And this
[31:40] seed, that perfect church, I want you to
[31:42] remember that perfect church fell to the
[31:45] ground at Naia Rome when she became a
[31:48] denomination. That's on the masterpiece.
[31:51] So, we know that that the first church
[31:54] that came forth that it was an absolute
[31:56] perfect church. They had signs and they
[31:58] had wonders. Jesus said in Mark the four
[32:01] uh uh 16th chapter he said these signs
[32:04] will follow them that that believe my
[32:06] name they'll cast out devils they'll
[32:07] speak with new tongues you and they'll
[32:10] lay their hands on the sick and they
[32:11] shall recover drink any deadly thing and
[32:13] if they take up serpents so they they
[32:15] had done all these things in the first
[32:17] church they were filled with the Holy
[32:19] Ghost on the day of Pentecost and they
[32:22] were a perfect church they had a church
[32:24] age messenger but see here's the thing a
[32:26] lot of people miss is that even though
[32:28] that anointing came and it was fallen on
[32:30] the church and they had the signs and
[32:32] they had the wonders but yet there was
[32:34] still something lacking that they didn't
[32:37] have at the time and what was it that
[32:39] was a messenger see they when the the
[32:43] Holy Spirit fell at the day of Pentecost
[32:45] there had to be yes that was in a great
[32:47] anointing and they took the word but yet
[32:50] they were all kind of scattered Peter
[32:51] was saying this one the different ones
[32:53] were saying this one but God sent a man
[32:57] who absolute complete grace It was a It
[32:59] was an act of grace because he was going
[33:01] to persecute the church of God. So even
[33:05] though that anointing fell and the
[33:06] church was on fire, but yet there still
[33:09] had to be something to get that church
[33:11] centered and rooted and grounded and it
[33:14] had to be a man that was in God's hands.
[33:17] And so he brought, of course, we know
[33:19] the story. Paul, I need some water if
[33:21] somebody wants to help me out here in
[33:23] just a minute.
[33:24] So Paul of course came and he what did
[33:28] he do? He set things right. He set
[33:30] things in order. You know Peter was
[33:32] talking about well you might need to be
[33:34] circumcised all you Gentiles. And he
[33:36] would do that when he would get around
[33:37] the Jews. But when he got around the
[33:38] Gentiles it was it was everything was
[33:40] hunky dory. So we we had to have a
[33:42] messenger who who didn't who didn't
[33:45] quibble one bit on the word. And he knew
[33:47] he took everybody right back to the
[33:49] word. And it wasn't his idea. He didn't
[33:52] get around one and say, "Well, it you
[33:54] know what? It could look like this or it
[33:56] could be that way." But it had him come
[33:57] right back to the word.
[33:59] So, this being said, this first church,
[34:04] even though they were perfect, and even
[34:06] though they had a messenger, and even
[34:08] though they they had a word from the
[34:10] Lord that you're not all going to sleep,
[34:13] see, I'm sure that there were many who
[34:15] were in in um persecution. They were
[34:19] they maybe had their homes taken from
[34:21] them. They had their freedoms taken from
[34:23] them.
[34:25] And many had their lives were taken from
[34:27] them.
[34:29] They were totally completely bereft.
[34:32] And and and so Paul sent them a letter
[34:35] and and he sent it to the Thessalonians
[34:37] and he said he said, "Oh, I know a
[34:39] mystery that we're not all going to
[34:41] sleep, but we're going to be changed in
[34:43] a moment, in a twinkling of an eye." And
[34:45] I could just imagine that they would
[34:46] they would take that letter and they
[34:48] would run from house to house. Did you
[34:50] see what what the prophet Paul told us?
[34:52] Did you see what he told us that any day
[34:55] now that it could be the rapture could
[34:57] take place that all the hardships we're
[34:59] going through? Oh, it's just for a
[35:00] little while that that oh, any day that
[35:02] the Lord's going to send from heaven
[35:04] with a shout and the voice of the
[35:06] archangel and the last trump of God and
[35:08] we won't have to worry about these
[35:10] things anymore. Oh, and just comfort. As
[35:12] Paul said, comfort one another with
[35:14] these words. And that was a comfort to
[35:17] them.
[35:18] But they didn't realize that they were
[35:19] not predestinated to be raptured.
[35:22] See, they were not predestinated to go
[35:24] in the rapture. That they had to fulfill
[35:27] another part of God's plan.
[35:29] And they had to die and go into the
[35:31] ground. Because if you take a seed of of
[35:34] wheat or corn, if you want more, ask any
[35:37] farmer, you can't just take that one.
[35:38] You've got to plant it. And when you
[35:41] plant it in the ground and it is watered
[35:43] by the blood of the martyrs and the
[35:45] blood of the saints, that was that first
[35:47] church that was planted in the ground.
[35:49] But there had but but but the Bible
[35:51] tells us that he waits for that precious
[35:53] fruit of the ground. And we know that in
[35:55] this last day, there's going to be
[35:57] another church
[35:58] without spot or without wrinkle.
[36:01] Amen.
[36:02] Do you believe that?
[36:05] Now, this is a teaching this morning
[36:08] or I'm sorry, this afternoon.
[36:10] I I told Brother Brandt, I said, "Good
[36:12] morning, brother. I'm I'm all
[36:14] discombobulated."
[36:16] Now, that's what he revealed at the very
[36:19] first church age. Now, watch as John saw
[36:22] him standing, the seven golden
[36:24] candlesticks, and he was standing with
[36:26] his hands out. Here's the first
[36:28] candlestick. See the first church age.
[36:31] Then the second, third, fourth, fifth,
[36:33] sixth, seventh. With his hands out in
[36:35] the form of the cross, he said, "I am
[36:37] alpha and omega." In other words, I'll
[36:39] be supreme in the first, I'll be supreme
[36:41] in the last. The light rises in the east
[36:44] and sets in the west. It's been a dismal
[36:46] dark time, and it shall be light in the
[36:49] evening time. The same gospel power that
[36:51] raised up here on the one hand in the
[36:53] east has shined over now in the other
[36:55] hand in the west. Alpha and omega, I am
[36:58] A and I am Z in his hands. You get it?
[37:01] Now, so what we're talking about about
[37:04] these three stages is that that coming
[37:07] up through the dark ages. Now, what
[37:08] brother Brandham was saying there, he
[37:10] said he he was supreme in the first and
[37:12] he was supreme in the last, but he was
[37:14] in all all the candlesticks, but yet dur
[37:17] in those candlesticks, it was it was
[37:19] mongerized there. There were creeds and
[37:22] dogmas and yet it was Christ, but yet it
[37:24] wasn't the fullness of Christ. It it
[37:27] could never be raptured. Now, the first
[37:29] church could have, but yet it was in
[37:31] God's plan for it to go down into into
[37:33] the ground. So, we know that only the
[37:36] that the first church could have been
[37:38] and only the last church can be, but now
[37:41] they're all going to all the dead in
[37:42] Christ are going to rise. So, they will
[37:44] be raptured. Amen. But it but it had to
[37:46] be in this last day. But now, so we go
[37:49] back and we look at so what happened in
[37:51] that time. We know there was a dark dark
[37:54] age that the the word of God was lost
[37:56] that it was it was just a few just just
[37:59] a very few people who kept the true word
[38:01] of God. But when the last when the first
[38:04] church age ended and it denominated and
[38:06] they and they started the first
[38:08] denomination in Na Rome so then it
[38:11] started then the next one came on it had
[38:13] word but yet it was still under under
[38:15] the under the ground. It was still
[38:16] buried but then it started coming up in
[38:18] the reformers. And so you young people,
[38:21] I I want you to pay attention for just a
[38:22] moment because I know we talk about
[38:24] things and I want you to to get what
[38:26] we're talking about when we say the seed
[38:28] and the shook and coming up and the
[38:30] reformers. So during the dark ages, it
[38:33] was it was the the the church had the
[38:37] monopoly on the word of God. They
[38:39] wouldn't hard let anybody have it. And
[38:42] they had their priests and they had
[38:44] their their bishops and they would sell
[38:46] you indulgences. If you wanted to go out
[38:49] and commit sin, just bring them a little
[38:51] bit of money. And they would do that.
[38:53] And if you wanted to be forgiven of a
[38:55] sin, bring them a little bit of money.
[38:56] Make your confession. All these things.
[38:58] It was such a a horrible time. And and
[39:01] and so it got the people to a point to
[39:04] where they realized that something had
[39:06] to change. And in Germany, the people
[39:09] were getting disgruntled. They were
[39:11] getting dissatisfied. You had different
[39:13] ones raising up. And there was a spirit
[39:15] of reformation that swept down through
[39:18] the land.
[39:20] And so when that spirit came, it took
[39:23] somebody to put it into motion.
[39:26] That it was an anointing that came. It
[39:28] would have done Martin Luther one bit of
[39:30] good if there hadn't been people ready
[39:32] to receive his message.
[39:34] See,
[39:35] God had to send that message down and
[39:37] send that anointing. So when the message
[39:39] came, they they grabbed a hold of it
[39:42] real quick.
[39:43] And and and we know that down through
[39:45] the through the years that as they as
[39:48] they tried and held on as much as they
[39:51] could. And and you had the different
[39:53] ones like John Hus and William Tindle.
[39:56] William Tindle was he was strangled by
[39:58] Thomas Moore. And Thomas Moore is
[40:00] venerated as a saint in the Catholic
[40:02] Church even to this day. But he murdered
[40:05] William Tendle for the for the uh the
[40:08] incomprehensible crime, the terrible
[40:10] deed of translating the Bible into
[40:13] English.
[40:15] And murdered him. Why? Because they had
[40:17] a monopoly on it. They said, "You're not
[40:19] going to translate without our okay.
[40:22] You're not going to you're not going to
[40:23] spread this around unless we give you
[40:25] the the okay." And so they had many
[40:28] bishops that they would they would try
[40:29] to bribe. They say, "Oh, we're going to
[40:31] give you a a big parish. We're going to
[40:33] make you rich. We're we're going to give
[40:35] you more authority. And many men, maybe
[40:38] they did give in to that, but there was
[40:40] many that didn't. And one of them, I
[40:42] can't recall his name, but they hung him
[40:44] in front of his own church. And I was
[40:46] just thinking, oh God, I was just
[40:47] thinking about Brother Jason, how he
[40:49] stood for this word. And I was thinking
[40:51] about what if I was back then and my
[40:53] pastor had had stood against the this
[40:56] rotten filth of of the Rome of Church of
[40:58] the Church of Rome. and and they and
[41:00] they came and they said, "Either you
[41:02] stop preaching or we're going to kill
[41:03] you." And and no doubt the people were
[41:07] praying for him, but yet it was still it
[41:09] was that time that they had to die. They
[41:11] had they had to that was under the ox
[41:14] age. They had to be slaughtered and to
[41:16] be sacrificed for the kingdom of God.
[41:20] And we don't understand that nowadays.
[41:22] we get a little uh something happens in
[41:24] our life, our car breaks down or or we
[41:26] got an unexpected bill that comes from
[41:28] somewhere or maybe somebody says a
[41:30] little something about us or or any
[41:32] little thing. Maybe it's raining and we
[41:34] say, "Well, we don't want to go to
[41:35] church on Wednesday night or or so and
[41:37] so's um not going to be there. I don't
[41:39] want to be there or my friends are not
[41:40] going to be there." Oh, brother, we are
[41:42] in a weak sir watered down leoty in
[41:46] church age.
[41:48] It's so it's so terrible. And so we know
[41:51] that that brother Bham said when he drew
[41:53] out this last church age, he was no
[41:55] dark. There was no light at all. It was
[41:57] all darkness. But yet he drew light in
[42:00] there because he knew there had to be
[42:02] light. There shall be light in the
[42:04] evening time. And that's where we're at.
[42:06] Even now, that's the great mystery.
[42:09] That's the great miracle in my opinion
[42:11] is that even in the midst of this
[42:12] darkness, even in the midst of the
[42:14] hedenism and the heathenism and and the
[42:17] and the filth and the gum of this last
[42:19] church age, that God's going to have a
[42:21] little spotless bride.
[42:23] Oh my.
[42:25] Just as Satan came into Eden and he took
[42:28] away Adam's bride and he and he and he
[42:30] wooed her and he and he committed
[42:32] adultery with her. We're in the middle
[42:34] of Satan's Eden here.
[42:37] See? And so Christ is coming and taking
[42:41] his little bride out of here. Amen.
[42:43] I think I said it wrong a a minute ago.
[42:45] Satan came into Eden, not Satan's Eden.
[42:49] So here we are in this last church age.
[42:52] And and so so that was the age of the
[42:54] reformers. And so you had John Wesley
[42:57] came up. And so he believed in
[42:59] sanctification.
[43:00] And and so the so the churches, but
[43:03] there had to be an anointing that went
[43:04] out. And so the same thing happened in
[43:07] the day of Pentecost or at the day of
[43:09] Isuza Street when the Pentecostal
[43:11] blessing fell. So a lot of times we
[43:13] wonder, well, what's the difference in
[43:15] us and the Pentecostals? Well, the
[43:17] apostolics believe in one God. They
[43:20] baptize in Jesus name. You have the the
[43:23] UPC, they do the same thing. You've got
[43:26] the assemblies and the different groups.
[43:28] They're all Pentecostal. But what makes
[43:31] us different from them? See, they they
[43:34] worshiped God and they and they and they
[43:37] believed in the signs and the wonders
[43:39] and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
[43:42] But yet, what it was, that was an
[43:44] anointing that came down onto the world
[43:48] to get it ready for this last church
[43:50] age. If you go back and read in history
[43:53] in like 1850, I believe it was 1830,
[43:56] that was what they called the Great
[43:57] Awakening. And there was a movement that
[44:00] went out and it was called the
[44:01] restoration movement. And so they there
[44:04] was an anointing that was coming down
[44:06] and the churches got together and the
[44:08] different ones they they came out of the
[44:10] denomination. They came out of the
[44:11] Methodists and the and the different
[44:13] ones. One of them in this movement was
[44:15] Alexander Campbell who was a Campbellite
[44:17] started. The that's where the Baptist
[44:19] came from John Smith. But then there was
[44:20] other ones who came along and they and
[44:23] they had these different groups and it
[44:25] wasn't but just a moment and they
[44:27] denominationalized. They started
[44:29] organizing. And so even though they
[44:31] wanted to go back to the original
[44:32] church, they wanted to go, they knew
[44:34] that what they were doing was not right,
[44:37] they couldn't find sprinkling anywhere
[44:39] in this Bible. So there was an anointing
[44:41] that went out and said, "We have to
[44:42] start immersing again. We have to start
[44:44] doing these things again."
[44:46] But what happened? Man's creeds and
[44:49] ideas and their dogmas got involved. Got
[44:52] in the middle of it. And and so because
[44:54] why? because it wasn't a messenger that
[44:57] came with it at the time. There was an
[44:59] anointing that came out and they were so
[45:01] one of them they they they became the
[45:03] United Churches of Christ, the Church of
[45:05] Christ, the American Missionary
[45:07] Association. And so they they they moved
[45:09] on and then they split up and had all
[45:12] kind of different uh different doctrines
[45:13] and different ideas. One of them don't
[45:15] believe in music in the church. One of
[45:17] them does this, one of them does that.
[45:19] But I tell you where all of them have
[45:20] ended up at in the World Council of
[45:22] Churches. Every one of them. because it
[45:24] just shows you that man's creeds and
[45:26] ideas, that's all you're ever going to
[45:28] get from it.
[45:30] But God's going to have a a a little
[45:33] group. He's going to have a little bride
[45:35] in this last day that she's going to be
[45:37] free from every dogma, free from every
[45:40] creed. Why? Because it's not a
[45:42] reformation.
[45:43] It's not reformers. It's restoring back
[45:46] to that original
[45:47] that God had planned for us.
[45:50] And so we we've got to go back. How do
[45:53] we go back? How do we get back to that
[45:55] original? Well, God sent a prophet. That
[45:57] was the only way we could do it. It
[45:59] wasn't ever going to happen with a group
[46:01] of people. It wasn't never going to
[46:03] happen with with this denomination or
[46:05] that denomination. But God had to have
[46:07] one man in his hand. One man that that
[46:10] didn't have a He didn't hardly have a
[46:12] dog in the fight. He was raised in the
[46:14] middle of nowhere in the mountains. His
[46:16] daddy was a bootleger. No, they weren't
[46:18] even rel religious people. But God
[46:20] brought him in. and what to confound all
[46:24] of the theologians and all the different
[46:26] ideas and dogmas and doctrines that they
[46:28] had of that day.
[46:29] Amen.
[46:30] Aren't you glad for that?
[46:32] I got to shed this for a second.
[46:37] But so and and and so we we we're
[46:41] looking at what God has done in our day
[46:43] and we say, "Well, what makes us special
[46:45] people?" Well, I'm nothing special. I'm
[46:48] nothing special. I fail all the time. I
[46:51] make so many mistakes sometimes. I don't
[46:53] even think I could even get up.
[46:56] And I'm I was just praying the other
[46:58] day. I said, "Lord, how I don't
[47:00] understand. I I make so many mistakes.
[47:03] You would think I'd be farther down the
[47:04] road than I am now.
[47:06] You would think I would I wouldn't let
[47:08] the same little thing trip me up again."
[47:10] That's right.
[47:12] And and then the devil comes right along
[47:14] and he's like, "Well, see, there you go.
[47:17] You just think you are. You're you're
[47:18] not a Christian. See, you just think you
[47:21] are. And I How many of y'all has he ever
[47:23] told that to?
[47:24] He tells me that all the time.
[47:26] But it's not about your feelings.
[47:28] That's right.
[47:29] It's not about how you feel this day or
[47:31] you feel that day, but it's about the
[47:33] promise that he gave to us.
[47:35] Hallelujah.
[47:35] And it's I'm not trusting in my
[47:37] feelings. I'm not trusting in my works.
[47:39] I'm not trusting in the things that I
[47:41] can do, but I'm trusting in the finished
[47:43] work that he did already. Now, that
[47:45] seems so simple, but yet it's so
[47:47] profound at the same time. We have to
[47:49] trust in him.
[47:51] You know, they say brother Brandham made
[47:52] mistakes and and he uh he did this and
[47:55] he did that, but I've said before that
[47:57] he said on uh the uh life story in Los
[48:02] Angeles, he said, "Lord," he said, "Let
[48:04] my mistakes be their stepping stones."
[48:08] So, I feel like that was ordained if he
[48:10] did make a mistake.
[48:12] Now, we want to look at what Moses did.
[48:14] Sometimes folks say, and me and a
[48:15] brother were talking about this the
[48:17] other day, and it really struck me what
[48:19] he said because we was talking about the
[48:21] mistakes they say brother Brandon made.
[48:22] I said, um, you know, we we wonder
[48:26] sometimes if the things he did wasn't
[48:28] ordained to throw some off.
[48:31] Just like, do we really think that that
[48:34] Jonah was backslid when he got on that
[48:35] ship bound for Tarsus?
[48:37] Was he backslid? No. He was in the will
[48:40] of God.
[48:41] Perfect will of God. And and so what
[48:43] about Moses? Now I want y'all's
[48:45] attention. What about when he struck the
[48:47] rock twice?
[48:49] Even though he broke the continuity of
[48:51] scripture,
[48:52] but think about it. It was the law that
[48:55] he was projecting and under the and he I
[48:57] don't believe God could allow him under
[49:00] the law to take people into the Holy
[49:02] Ghost, which was Canaan land. That was a
[49:04] type of the Holy Ghost. That's proven
[49:06] that you're never going to get there by
[49:08] the law. You're never going to get there
[49:10] by your works. You're never going to get
[49:12] there
[49:13] aside from Christ.
[49:15] Joshua was a perfect type of Jesus
[49:17] Christ.
[49:18] He was even he his name in the New
[49:20] Testament in the Scoffield Bible even
[49:22] says Jesus twice when it says Joshua.
[49:25] It's speaking of Joshua, but it's
[49:26] speaking of Jesus and and so he led the
[49:29] people where we're not traveling around.
[49:31] We're not all in in in a in a wandering
[49:34] around in the wilderness as some would
[49:35] say. I've heard some people say, "Well,
[49:37] the prophet led us out and now we're
[49:39] wandering around in the wilderness and
[49:41] we're waiting for a Joshua to take us
[49:43] back."
[49:44] See, but the Holy Spirit is the Joshua.
[49:48] And in some sense, yes, we we have been
[49:51] taken out, but also at the same time,
[49:53] Brother Brandham said that this prophet
[49:55] would have a ministry that was would to
[49:57] be to take out of
[49:59] and into.
[50:01] Amen. Amen.
[50:02] I read a letter the other day said, "Oh,
[50:03] we're just wandering around." A big
[50:05] name, too. We're wandering around in the
[50:07] desert. I don't know where he's
[50:09] wandering, but I'm telling you right
[50:11] now,
[50:13] I'm in the land where milk and honey
[50:15] flows. I'm feasting on that old corn.
[50:18] I'm I'm in I'm in the heavenly places in
[50:20] Christ Jesus.
[50:21] I'm not running around in the desert.
[50:24] Cuz he came with a message, oh, to
[50:26] deliver us and to take us all the way
[50:28] through. Yeah.
[50:29] A lot of people they get mixed up and
[50:31] they say, "Well, Canaan land represents
[50:33] heaven." Oh, I beg to differ.
[50:35] There's no way it can represent heaven.
[50:37] Cuz that's when the battles really
[50:39] started when they got over there. They
[50:40] were just walking around having a good
[50:42] time for 40 years.
[50:44] Their shoes didn't wear out. The clothes
[50:46] didn't wear out.
[50:50] Moses told them in Deuteronomy 2029, he
[50:52] said, "You've not even eaten bread." And
[50:55] that's true. They didn't they didn't
[50:56] have to go out and gather any corn. They
[50:58] had no wheat. They ate the mana, but
[51:01] they didn't eat bread of their own
[51:02] hands. God absolutely supernaturally
[51:05] sustained these people.
[51:08] And how much more can he sustain us?
[51:11] I got a friend. He's a He's a big
[51:12] prepper. He's got AR-15. He's got he's
[51:16] got food stored up. He's got he's got
[51:18] going to get him a camper. He said, "I
[51:20] got me a bugout bag when when it all
[51:22] goes south." And I'm said, "Well,
[51:25] I don't need one of them."
[51:28] But like I said, God in in the time of
[51:32] Moses, think about this. What a
[51:34] supernatural people brought out with a
[51:37] mighty hand out of slavery and bondage.
[51:39] They were supernatural to start with
[51:41] because they they shouldn't have even
[51:43] been there.
[51:44] There was no Sarah couldn't even have a
[51:46] baby when she was young.
[51:47] That's right. But God took Abraham and
[51:50] Sarah and turned them back young and
[51:52] healed whatever was going on with them
[51:54] and brought this race of people
[51:57] supernaturally on the earth
[51:59] and then brought them out of is of Egypt
[52:02] supernaturally
[52:04] and sustained them supernaturally.
[52:06] There's nothing that man's ever done. We
[52:09] can't do anything.
[52:11] It's not by might, not by power, but
[52:13] it's always by his spirit.
[52:16] Amen. You do you love him? Can you
[52:17] believe it?
[52:18] So now, what where where are we at
[52:21] tonight? We have to trust in nothing
[52:24] else but the Holy Spirit to lead us and
[52:26] guide us. It's not in your own works.
[52:28] Don't get hung up. Don't worry about if
[52:30] you if you made a fall. If something
[52:32] happened to you, if you looked at
[52:34] something you shouldn't have looked at,
[52:35] if you talked the way you shouldn't have
[52:36] talked, if you had a bad spirit or
[52:38] something happened to you.
[52:40] I want to read you something.
[52:42] Brother Brandon was talking about
[52:43] restoration.
[52:47] Boy, y'all are quiet tonight.
[52:49] Y'all y'all listening good.
[52:53] Amen.
[52:55] So,
[52:58] let's go down here to what he said.
[53:01] It says, "I have lived I have lived many
[53:04] years in sin until I found the Lord."
[53:06] This is a question somebody sent.
[53:07] Brother Brandham, "Live many years in
[53:09] sin until I found the Lord." Please,
[53:11] brother Brandham, see I have sinned
[53:13] again and I'm not worthy to come before
[53:16] you in this holy place. Please tell me
[53:18] if I can be restored whole again. Yes,
[53:20] he says yes emphatically with an
[53:22] exclamation mark. You have not sinned,
[53:24] my friend, so far in God, but what you
[53:28] could be restored. If you had sinned so
[53:31] far that you could not be restored,
[53:33] you'd never want to be restored. See?
[53:35] See? But as long as there's something
[53:37] dealing with your heart, you're still in
[53:39] the line of restoration.
[53:42] Brother Brandham said this, "Guilty of
[53:43] the least is guilty of the whole." I
[53:45] have sinned many times. Every day, every
[53:48] one of us do things that we don't want
[53:50] to do. It's in our heart. You don't want
[53:52] to be that way or you wouldn't ask this
[53:54] question. See, that's itself a proof
[53:57] that God still dealing with you. You've
[54:00] probably gotten nervous. Probably Satan
[54:02] telling you that you can't be restored.
[54:04] He's lying. Certainly he is. Because
[54:07] look, if there's a deep calling, there's
[54:09] got to be a deep to respond to the call.
[54:12] If there's a hunger for something, that
[54:14] something's got to be somewhere or you
[54:16] would have no hunger for it. Amen.
[54:19] Now, now if you there's a place you can
[54:22] cross where you can't get back, but when
[54:24] that is you're down there again in the
[54:26] same shape you was, it goes to show that
[54:28] you only fell from grace. Backsliding is
[54:30] not lost. I want somebody to tell me
[54:32] where backsliding is lost. and prove it
[54:35] by prove it to the Bible. David lost the
[54:37] joy of his salvation when he took Ba
[54:40] Sheeba, Uriah's wife. But he never lost
[54:42] his salvation. He never said, "Restore
[54:45] to me my salvation." He said, "Restore
[54:47] to me the joy of my salvation."
[54:51] I tell you what, I was talking about
[54:53] when I went up there that I I used to
[54:56] just be a ranked sinner. I don't know if
[54:58] any of y'all were or not, but I
[54:59] certainly was. And I was I was going
[55:02] through there years ago, me and a me and
[55:04] a friend of mine on a road trip up to no
[55:06] good. We went up through Indiana and
[55:08] Ohio and all that. And on the way up
[55:10] there, I looked over at Becky and I was
[55:11] just like, I never would have dreamed
[55:13] when I came up here years ago that I
[55:15] would be coming up here preaching the
[55:17] gospel. Amen.
[55:18] I never would have dreamed that. I never
[55:19] would have dreamed that God could take
[55:21] somebody like me and and and use me to
[55:26] bring the word to his people. I I y'all
[55:29] maybe you don't understand if you're a
[55:31] preacher you understand that why in the
[55:33] world God would ever do that.
[55:35] But what is it? He he the hardest thing
[55:38] Brother Brandham said is for for God to
[55:40] do this is what he said. The hardest
[55:42] thing for him to do is to get one mortal
[55:44] to believe another mortal.
[55:47] And and so we live in an age that that
[55:49] says, "Well, we don't need preachers
[55:51] anymore. All we need to do is just sit
[55:53] down and and shut up and push play."
[55:55] But let me tell you something. There is
[55:57] still a ministry in this age. There's
[55:59] still a ministry that's going to do
[56:01] exactly what the prophet said. They're
[56:03] not just going to say, "Well, just push
[56:04] play." Well, they're pushing play. But
[56:06] are they doing what he said when they
[56:07] push play?
[56:10] When Jesus stood at the grave of
[56:12] Lazarus. Yes, that was the voice of God
[56:14] that spoke. He said, "Lazarus, come
[56:17] forth." But yet, what happened when he
[56:19] started coming forth? He had others. He
[56:21] said, "Go loose him."
[56:23] And that's the ministry of this day.
[56:25] Jesus is crying, "Go loose those
[56:27] people." That's the voice of God crying
[56:29] out. But yet, he's still got men and
[56:32] women in this day that can speak for God
[56:34] and go loose
[56:36] the grave clothes off of somebody.
[56:38] I was dead in sin. I was dead in sin and
[56:41] trespasses, but yet God called my name
[56:44] one day.
[56:45] Amen.
[56:46] I don't deserve it.
[56:47] You don't deserve it. None of us deserve
[56:49] it. You say, "Brother, you say, "Brother
[56:51] Joe, you sure are preaching awful simple
[56:52] tonight." Well, I hope it's so simple
[56:54] that it that it just it brings you right
[56:56] back around to seeing the profound
[56:59] because God's got to get a church ready
[57:01] for a rapture.
[57:02] And what is it? We're we've been here
[57:04] for how long? But yet, we're still
[57:07] carrying on. Brother Brandham said the
[57:09] only thing that's in that's hindering
[57:11] the rapture is the readiness of the
[57:13] church.
[57:14] So, we've got to get all the little
[57:15] things out of our life.
[57:18] Is that right?
[57:20] So, what did he say here? He said, "I
[57:24] got to get my glasses on again."
[57:26] So, we've got to get to back to a point.
[57:29] There's a new birth coming on. A strong
[57:31] wind in Israel is coming up called
[57:34] backwash and holy rollers. Hallelujah.
[57:36] Just as flexible as it can be. That's
[57:38] right. Got life in them. The new tree
[57:41] was alive. The old tree was dead. That's
[57:43] the reason they can't bend because it's
[57:46] dead. But there's a new birth coming on.
[57:48] The latter rain is being poured out in
[57:50] these last days. power, signs, and
[57:53] wonders. And the same joy them old trees
[57:56] joy long time ago has come back in a new
[57:58] generation. Amen. Cuz I want to tell you
[58:01] something. When he's talking about
[58:03] restoration, he's talking about the
[58:05] church, but this is a restoration time.
[58:08] It's not just going back to the first
[58:09] church, but it's restoring everything in
[58:11] your life. Yeah.
[58:13] In Joel 2:28 it says, "Behold, I will
[58:16] restore, sayeth the Lord, all not just
[58:19] what it ate, but he said, I'll restore
[58:21] the years that the locust and the
[58:24] cankerworm and the Palmer worm ate."
[58:27] You want to talk about true
[58:28] justification? I don't care what you've
[58:30] done in your life. I don't care where
[58:32] you've been or what path of sin Satan
[58:34] has taken you down. But when God
[58:36] restores you, it'll be like it was never
[58:38] ever happened first place.
[58:41] When you're restored, it'll be as though
[58:43] it never happened.
[58:45] Restoration doesn't mean you build a
[58:47] building back the way it was and it's
[58:49] wonky jawed and it's crooked and it's
[58:51] got all this mess on it, but it's
[58:54] absolutely completely restored back to
[58:56] the original condition.
[58:59] And when God restores you, he restores
[59:01] you to the vision he had of you in his
[59:02] mind before the foundation of the world.
[59:05] Satan might have got in there and he
[59:07] might have tampered with his creation.
[59:09] He might have got in there and pulled
[59:10] you away for a little while, but oh,
[59:12] there's a germ of God. There's something
[59:14] that won't let you stay out there, but
[59:16] just so long.
[59:18] Thank you, God.
[59:19] Thank you, God, for calling me.
[59:21] What is that germ of life in there? When
[59:23] it hears the word of God, it says,
[59:25] "Amen." There's a deep calling and
[59:27] there's a deep that responds. That's
[59:29] true restoration.
[59:31] That's true justification.
[59:34] Just as if you'd never done it.
[59:35] Amen. You know, Brother Bram talked
[59:37] about that little woman and he said that
[59:39] how he talked about her in sin and God,
[59:41] why don't you just wipe it all off? And
[59:43] he walked up there and and he the Lord
[59:45] pulled him behind the door and he showed
[59:47] him that vision of the rainbow around
[59:49] the world. And every time he would sin,
[59:51] the blood would fly off of Christ and he
[59:54] saw that he and he he showed him his own
[59:56] sins that he wrote and he had it down in
[59:58] a book and he said he reached up in
[1:00:00] there. He said, "Lord, is that all my
[1:00:02] sins?" And he said he just stuck his
[1:00:04] hand aside and wrote pardon across there
[1:00:07] and cast it away.
[1:00:10] I love that story cuz that's my life
[1:00:12] right there. I know I've told that
[1:00:13] before, but I love that because that's
[1:00:16] me.
[1:00:17] Sometimes we get a little phariseical
[1:00:19] spirit on us, don't we?
[1:00:21] I believe in holiness. I believe in
[1:00:23] right living,
[1:00:24] but I don't believe in legalism. That's
[1:00:26] right.
[1:00:27] Y
[1:00:29] Amen.
[1:00:30] I believe if we've got the Holy Spirit
[1:00:31] of God living in us, we're going to live
[1:00:33] holy.
[1:00:34] It's going to make make us talk right.
[1:00:36] It's going to make us act right.
[1:00:38] I was talking about somebody the other
[1:00:40] day. I said, you know, he kind of got
[1:00:42] upset at me cuz I was leaning the part
[1:00:44] and I was able to find it quicker than
[1:00:45] he could. I called him back and he's
[1:00:47] like, "Well, somebody does me that way."
[1:00:49] He said, "I'll just I'll just usually
[1:00:50] block them on the phone or blacklist
[1:00:52] them." I'm like, "Well, my goodness, I
[1:00:54] hated that." And I was telling my wife
[1:00:56] about I said, "But you know," I said,
[1:00:58] "He's he's not a Christian. You know, he
[1:01:00] he that's just the way he is." And I got
[1:01:02] to thinking, I'm like, "Well, I know
[1:01:03] some Christians that are like that, too.
[1:01:07] That's the bad part about it.
[1:01:09] That ain't That's that's the bad part."
[1:01:11] Oh, brothers and sisters, like brother
[1:01:13] Jason was preaching the other day. He
[1:01:15] said he said, "The worst thing in the
[1:01:17] world is that for for the people of the
[1:01:20] world to mistake you for one of them.
[1:01:24] Amen.
[1:01:25] Oh, that hit me right between the eyes.
[1:01:28] Sometimes we try to get along, go along
[1:01:30] to get along, but that ain't what we're
[1:01:32] called to do.
[1:01:33] Brother Brandham said said, "You'll be
[1:01:36] hunted. You'll be hated. You'll be
[1:01:37] despised of all men."
[1:01:39] Yeah.
[1:01:40] If if we're loved by everybody and
[1:01:42] everybody, oh well, we want so and so to
[1:01:44] come over. I got a joke I want to tell
[1:01:45] you. Oh my
[1:01:48] Yeah.
[1:01:49] So, how do we act around other people?
[1:01:51] Come on. Are we quick to give our
[1:01:53] testimony?
[1:01:55] Young people, if you want to grow in
[1:01:56] God, you start giving your testimony
[1:01:58] about what God's done for you.
[1:02:00] Don't worry about what other somebody
[1:02:01] else is going to say about you.
[1:02:02] Don't be ashamed of the gospel.
[1:02:06] Sometimes we we get so quiet and we
[1:02:07] like, "Oh, I don't want to say nothing.
[1:02:09] I might offend somebody." Well, if it
[1:02:10] offends them, they need to be offended.
[1:02:13] The the world don't come to church to
[1:02:15] see more of the world.
[1:02:16] That's right.
[1:02:17] They come to church to see Christ. And
[1:02:20] if they're seeing the world in you, then
[1:02:22] you're you've missed the boat somewhere.
[1:02:24] That's right.
[1:02:25] I was talking to a man the other day and
[1:02:27] I was he was talking about going on a
[1:02:28] cruise. I said, "I'd like to do that.
[1:02:29] That sounds like fun." He's like, "Well,
[1:02:31] I want to tell you." He said, "If you if
[1:02:33] you like to gamble," he said, "they turn
[1:02:34] the casinos on and he said they'll get
[1:02:36] it hot for about two hours and they'll
[1:02:38] let you win a lot and then then they'll
[1:02:40] start cranking it up to where they take
[1:02:41] it back from you and then some." And I
[1:02:44] said, he said, he said, "Now, best thing
[1:02:46] to do is is win about for about two
[1:02:48] hours and then take it back to your
[1:02:49] room." And I said, and he's talking
[1:02:51] about the drinks and all. I said, "Well,
[1:02:53] that's kind of like turning me against
[1:02:54] cruising there for just a moment." So, I
[1:02:56] said, "Well," I said, um, you know, I
[1:02:59] said, "I used to like all that stuff. I
[1:03:01] used to be into gambling and drinking
[1:03:02] and carrying on." I said, "But I gave my
[1:03:04] heart to the Lord." And I said, "I quit
[1:03:06] all that stuff." And he looked at me and
[1:03:08] he, you know what he did? He threw his
[1:03:09] hand. He said, "Well, praise God.
[1:03:13] Then he got real religious all of a
[1:03:14] sudden.
[1:03:15] He said, "Oh, I go to this church over
[1:03:17] here and I I know if I died right now,
[1:03:19] I'd go to heaven." And I said, "Well," I
[1:03:21] said, "You got to trust in him with all
[1:03:22] of your heart. You got to forsake the
[1:03:24] world.
[1:03:26] But don't be ashamed of the gospel."
[1:03:28] Get up in the morning when you wake up,
[1:03:29] young people, say, "Lord, give me an
[1:03:31] opportunity today maybe to be able to
[1:03:33] say something for your kingdom."
[1:03:36] Amen.
[1:03:37] But God will restore you.
[1:03:39] No matter where you've been, it's
[1:03:40] complete restoration. Amen.
[1:03:43] Now, I'm just about out of time. I got a
[1:03:45] few more quotes here I want to read.
[1:03:48] It went fast, didn't it?
[1:03:49] Good to see you, brother.
[1:03:52] Amen. Let read in Joel 2. I just feel
[1:03:54] like reading that in Joel 228
[1:03:57] or I'll read in 224, 2:25. And I will
[1:04:01] restore to you the years that the locust
[1:04:04] hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the
[1:04:06] caterpillar, and the palmer worm, my
[1:04:09] great army, which I sent among you. and
[1:04:12] ye shall eat in him plenty and be
[1:04:14] satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:04:15] Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously
[1:04:18] with you and my people shall never be
[1:04:20] ashamed. See, we're not ashamed of the
[1:04:23] gospel. We we should never be ashamed of
[1:04:26] what he's done for us.
[1:04:27] And and and crying on the mountain tops,
[1:04:29] cry it on the housetops. Get on
[1:04:32] Facebook. Don't get on there and put it
[1:04:34] put how many deer you killed or or what
[1:04:36] NASCAR uh race you went to or or your
[1:04:40] foot favorite football team. Put
[1:04:42] something on there about the Lord.
[1:04:43] All right.
[1:04:44] Let everybody know whose side you're on.
[1:04:46] Oh, I get on there. It's so much
[1:04:48] foolishness and and
[1:04:50] everybody wants to show me what they
[1:04:52] ate. I don't really care.
[1:04:55] I mean, that's fine.
[1:04:57] Sitting down eating dinner and showing
[1:04:59] their food.
[1:05:01] Oh my
[1:05:03] But tell me something about what the
[1:05:04] Lord's done for for you.
[1:05:08] There's a restoration.
[1:05:11] But you know where where we're at? How
[1:05:13] do we get back? See, we want to go back,
[1:05:16] but we've gotten to a place to where
[1:05:18] it's us and them. It's us four and no
[1:05:21] more. And not only is it the is it the
[1:05:24] little foxes that spoil the vine,
[1:05:26] but sometimes sometimes you can have a
[1:05:29] truth and that truth can be a poison.
[1:05:33] Did you know that?
[1:05:35] That's what he said.
[1:05:36] Let's see if I can find it. He said now,
[1:05:40] okay, so the prescription, you want to
[1:05:42] know the way back. That's it. That is
[1:05:44] what Peter said. Dr. Peter, the one
[1:05:46] who's given the inoculation, Christ
[1:05:48] tried it on himself and it worked. Peter
[1:05:50] had it and it worked. I got it and it's
[1:05:53] doing real good. That's the
[1:05:54] prescription. Don't try to tamper with
[1:05:56] it. Don't try to add something to it. If
[1:05:59] you put too much poison, you'll kill
[1:06:01] your patient. Sure is the world. Dr.
[1:06:03] Knowed how to balance that prescription.
[1:06:05] Brother Andrew was up there and I asked
[1:06:06] Brother Andrew, I said, "That's exactly
[1:06:08] right." Because you can take something
[1:06:09] that's good for you, but if you add too
[1:06:11] much to it or don't get the mixture just
[1:06:13] right, then it can become a poison.
[1:06:15] Right. They even take snake venom and
[1:06:18] make uh make uh medicine out of it,
[1:06:20] right?
[1:06:21] They take all kind of mushrooms and
[1:06:23] stuff like that. And if you do it in the
[1:06:25] wrong the wrong dosage, it can kill you.
[1:06:28] All right. So, this is what he said. He
[1:06:30] said, "Now, if you see, if you put too
[1:06:32] much poison in it, you kill your
[1:06:34] patient." That that that that is right.
[1:06:36] You don't want to be crude and rude and
[1:06:38] bulldozing and overdriv. See, with the
[1:06:41] truth that you found, that is where you
[1:06:44] oneness, brethren, made the mistake. So
[1:06:46] even though we've got the truth and even
[1:06:48] though we're on the right side, so as we
[1:06:51] always say, God's on our side, well, I
[1:06:53] want to be on God's side.
[1:06:56] So even though you've got the truth, if
[1:06:58] you take that, you can be overbearing.
[1:07:00] You can be bulldozing and you can do
[1:07:02] more damage
[1:07:04] than good
[1:07:05] and drive people away. Then it becomes
[1:07:06] poison.
[1:07:07] See, especially if you let it get in and
[1:07:10] break up fellowship. See, that's where
[1:07:12] you on this brother made the mistake.
[1:07:14] Now we are going back to the road. We're
[1:07:16] going back to cure. And you assembly
[1:07:19] brothers that separated yourself. Each
[1:07:21] one of you, that is where you made your
[1:07:23] mistake. When a truth is added, just go
[1:07:26] on. Let it alone. God will take care of
[1:07:29] it. No man can come to him unless he
[1:07:31] calls him anyhow. Amen.
[1:07:34] So I I don't I don't want to have too
[1:07:37] much poison. And I want to have the
[1:07:39] truth. But you know, when I first got
[1:07:40] saved and I and I I first came back to
[1:07:43] the Lord,
[1:07:44] Amen.
[1:07:44] I was a little legalistic. I don't know
[1:07:47] if anybody else has ever experienced
[1:07:49] that, but I was when I say a little, I
[1:07:51] mean a lot.
[1:07:52] And I was a lot legalistic. And and so I
[1:07:55] said, "Boy, it's got to be this way, and
[1:07:56] I it's got to be that way." I was about
[1:07:58] one light switch away from being an
[1:08:00] Amish because I felt like, you know,
[1:08:08] Ask my wife back there.
[1:08:13] I talked to somebody the other day. I
[1:08:14] said, "You know, I used to be real
[1:08:15] legalistic." She's like, "Yes, you sure
[1:08:17] did."
[1:08:20] But I'm glad the Lord has patience with
[1:08:22] us.
[1:08:23] And we all got to grow. And what I've
[1:08:25] learned in my growth is that every every
[1:08:28] apple don't get ripe on the tree at the
[1:08:30] same time.
[1:08:31] If you go to pick apple, some green in
[1:08:33] the top, some of them ripe at the
[1:08:34] bottom. Sometimes it's vice versa. Some
[1:08:36] of them at the top's real good and ripe.
[1:08:38] But we don't just know just say, "Hey,
[1:08:40] you ain't ripe yet. You ain't going to
[1:08:41] make it."
[1:08:42] See?
[1:08:44] We got to have that patience with each
[1:08:46] other
[1:08:47] in the church.
[1:08:48] Yes, sir. the other churches around us.
[1:08:52] You know, you got people that believe
[1:08:54] different things and and they say,
[1:08:56] "Well, you just got to push play and
[1:08:58] you've got to and and you know what? I I
[1:09:00] I don't fall out with them. I don't
[1:09:03] maybe I can't walk all the way." But you
[1:09:06] know what? They're I believe their
[1:09:07] heart's right. I think they're in the
[1:09:09] right place and I think that that they
[1:09:11] that they're promoting the prophet. So,
[1:09:12] I'm a friend with them. and and they're
[1:09:14] saying, "Well, you know, but now where I
[1:09:16] separate is where they say, "Well, we
[1:09:17] don't need preachers at all." Now,
[1:09:19] that's where I separate. But, you know,
[1:09:21] I I love them and I pray for them and I
[1:09:24] believe one day, somehow or another,
[1:09:25] God's going to get all this worked out.
[1:09:28] Do you believe that?
[1:09:29] I believe he will. I think he's going to
[1:09:31] work it all out because there's good
[1:09:32] people in all these churches. And I
[1:09:34] mean, you've got different doctrines and
[1:09:35] you've got people in those. And now, I
[1:09:37] blame a lot of it on the ministry.
[1:09:39] Sometimes the ministers get a little
[1:09:40] they'll get a little idea or they they
[1:09:42] call a revelation but it's actually just
[1:09:44] their opinion and then what they do they
[1:09:46] set they'll divide the people
[1:09:48] and and and so but they need prayer.
[1:09:51] They they need us to pray for them.
[1:09:53] Amen.
[1:09:54] So anyhow I just want to say that
[1:09:55] tonight. I felt I felt like like I
[1:09:57] should because
[1:09:59] you know um meeting people and you see
[1:10:02] where their heart's at. You see they
[1:10:04] really genuinely love the Lord. And I I
[1:10:07] tell you what, if if I if I based if
[1:10:09] people looked at me and and the journey
[1:10:11] that I've been on and my in my life and
[1:10:13] my walk with Christ, if they would have
[1:10:16] seen me back 10 years ago,
[1:10:18] I would have been excommunicated.
[1:10:20] I would have been cast aside. I would
[1:10:22] have been one of them or or that one
[1:10:23] over there.
[1:10:24] But you know, God had mercy on me. And
[1:10:27] and as I grew and as I started studying
[1:10:30] the word and the more I listened and the
[1:10:32] more I got around fellowship and the
[1:10:34] more I went to meetings and the more I
[1:10:36] did this, I thought, "Wait a minute,
[1:10:37] maybe it ain't so bad over there or
[1:10:38] maybe this group ain't that bad or and
[1:10:41] then you start having that fellowship."
[1:10:42] Amen. You get all that poison out of
[1:10:44] there that Satan wants to separate the
[1:10:47] children of God.
[1:10:48] If he can separate us, he's got us
[1:10:50] whipped.
[1:10:51] Come on, brother.
[1:10:52] That's right. How are we any different
[1:10:53] than the oneness and the trinitaries and
[1:10:55] the and all them?
[1:10:56] That's right.
[1:10:57] Yeah.
[1:10:57] See,
[1:10:58] we're not any different.
[1:10:59] Amen.
[1:11:00] If we let that separate us.
[1:11:03] Now, they might Now, I' I've drew
[1:11:05] circles and drew it bigger and they
[1:11:06] kicked me plum out of it before,
[1:11:08] but let them kick you. Let them be the
[1:11:10] one to do it.
[1:11:11] But you do the right thing. You be the
[1:11:13] one that does the right thing no matter
[1:11:15] what. Always, always have a hand out for
[1:11:18] somebody.
[1:11:20] So, they might kick you out. They might
[1:11:21] do whatever. But you know what? Brother
[1:11:23] Billy Paul said this about brother
[1:11:24] Brandham. He said the one thing about my
[1:11:26] daddy. He said you couldn't tell his
[1:11:28] friends from his enemies.
[1:11:29] You couldn't tell his friends from his
[1:11:31] enemies. And I I don't want any enemies.
[1:11:34] And if I did, what do you do with them?
[1:11:36] Jesus said do good to him.
[1:11:39] That's right.
[1:11:39] Is that right? He said I said love your
[1:11:41] enemy. It's easy to love your neighbor.
[1:11:43] Brother Matt, you're real lovable. I can
[1:11:45] love you all these other brothers. But
[1:11:47] love your enemy. Now, that's a different
[1:11:49] pill to swallow.
[1:11:51] Somebody that's talked bad about you,
[1:11:53] said bad things about And you say,
[1:11:55] "Brother Joe, this is so elementary."
[1:11:57] Well, it's elementary. But I tell you
[1:11:59] what, we sure need it. I need it. I The
[1:12:02] reason I'm telling you because I need it
[1:12:03] in my life.
[1:12:04] I need more of it. Amen. Do you love
[1:12:06] him?
[1:12:09] Ain't he good? Amen.
[1:12:11] So, I did want to say one more thing
[1:12:14] before I close.
[1:12:15] That in the book of Revelations when
[1:12:17] it's talking about
[1:12:21] the the first woe being passed, I
[1:12:23] believe it's Revelations. Let me read
[1:12:24] that. For some reason, I just the Lord
[1:12:26] just brought that to my attention.
[1:12:29] So it says here in Revelations 9:8, "And
[1:12:33] they had hair as the hair of women, and
[1:12:36] their teeth were as the teeth of lions,
[1:12:38] and they had breastplates as it were
[1:12:40] breastplates of iron, and sound of wings
[1:12:43] were as a sound of chariots and many
[1:12:44] horses. But I want to go on down to
[1:12:47] verse 12. One woe is passed, and behold,
[1:12:50] there come two woes more hereafter."
[1:12:54] Now, the musicians can come on up if
[1:12:56] they want to. I want to just kind of
[1:12:57] talk about this for just a moment. You
[1:12:59] know, in this leady and church age,
[1:13:02] it's such a deceiving age and it it
[1:13:06] makes it makes you feel like that you've
[1:13:08] got to be beautiful. You've got to go
[1:13:12] along with the world. But Paul told
[1:13:15] tells us that a woman's hair is her
[1:13:17] covering. And if she cuts it, then she's
[1:13:20] uncovered.
[1:13:21] Now uncovered doesn't just mean your
[1:13:23] head. If you look at uncovering, it
[1:13:25] means you're naked in the sight of God.
[1:13:28] And so I just found it was very striking
[1:13:31] that that here it says that brother
[1:13:34] Brandham said this that these locust
[1:13:36] that had hairike women, he said that was
[1:13:38] to torment those women who had cut their
[1:13:40] hair. Yeah.
[1:13:41] See, so if the devil is tempting you to
[1:13:45] do that, just to trim it, just to leave
[1:13:47] the curling iron on long enough to burn
[1:13:49] it off, if he's tempting you to do that,
[1:13:52] if he's tempted, rebuke him for it.
[1:13:55] And you say, you say, "I'm not going to
[1:13:58] be like this lesian church age.
[1:14:00] I'm not going to be like that." Because
[1:14:02] right after that was in, it says here,
[1:14:04] "One woe is passed." And the reason I
[1:14:06] read that is because that was the first
[1:14:07] world war. Right after the first world
[1:14:10] war ended in about 1918 1920 was the
[1:14:13] first time women started cutting their
[1:14:14] hair.
[1:14:15] That's not just a coincidence that it's
[1:14:17] in the Bible. That's not a coincidence
[1:14:20] that it's right immediately the first
[1:14:22] world war ends.
[1:14:24] And that was called the shingle bob.
[1:14:26] Maybe some of you young ones didn't know
[1:14:28] what when brother would say why do you
[1:14:30] bob your hair? Don't bob your hair
[1:14:32] girls. That was the that was the
[1:14:33] hairstyle of the bobbing. It was shaved
[1:14:36] in the back, long come down in the
[1:14:38] front. And that's still fashionable to
[1:14:40] this day. That's still a fashionable
[1:14:41] thing. And what that was, I read a
[1:14:44] article about it. That was a sign of
[1:14:45] rebellion. It was a sign of of shaking
[1:14:48] off the old stereotypes that women had
[1:14:50] of being mothers and being real wives
[1:14:53] and being women. They wanted to do their
[1:14:55] own thing. See, and everybody, God help
[1:14:58] me. Everybody that here lately that has
[1:15:01] that has backslid on God and has and has
[1:15:05] quit going to church.
[1:15:06] Yeah.
[1:15:07] They say, "I'm just doing my own thing
[1:15:09] right now."
[1:15:11] That is absolutely the spirit of Satan.
[1:15:15] And it's it's a spirit of discouragement
[1:15:16] in the people.
[1:15:18] Amen.
[1:15:20] I don't know why I said that. I I just I
[1:15:23] read that and I was like, "Well,
[1:15:24] somebody needs to hear it."
[1:15:26] Because it's so important in this day to
[1:15:29] be clothed in righteousness.
[1:15:31] That God's going to have a spotless
[1:15:33] bride.
[1:15:34] He's going to have a spotless church
[1:15:36] just like that original church, just
[1:15:39] like that first church. But the the
[1:15:42] difference is this church is going to be
[1:15:44] raptured.
[1:15:45] I want to make it. Don't you
[1:15:48] raise your hand. Say, "I want to make
[1:15:49] it." If you want to make it, if nobody
[1:15:51] else does, it's going to be me.
[1:15:52] Amen.
[1:15:53] I tell you what, I don't want nothing in
[1:15:55] this world to hinder me.
[1:15:56] I don't want I don't want no hair,
[1:15:58] fashion, hairdo. I don't want no
[1:16:00] Netflix. I don't want no hip-hop music.
[1:16:03] I don't want no country music, no Gar
[1:16:05] Brooks, J Jason Alena, or none of them.
[1:16:09] Amen. Amen.
[1:16:11] Turn our eyes toward Jesus.
[1:16:14] Amen.
[1:16:14] Look full in his wonderful face.
[1:16:16] Hallelujah.
[1:16:18] In
[1:16:18] Hebrews 12, it says, "Looking unto
[1:16:20] Jesus, the author and the finisher of
[1:16:23] our faith, looking away from all the
[1:16:25] things of this world.
[1:16:27] Looking away from all the things that
[1:16:29] that draws us aside."
[1:16:32] I don't know if I read that or not. Let
[1:16:35] me get my phone out of here.
[1:16:37] I think I've got it in there. I want to
[1:16:40] read this. I got to have it anyway for
[1:16:42] the prayer request.
[1:16:47] Y'all bear with me just a moment.
[1:16:50] I just really want to read this to you.
[1:16:52] [Music]
[1:17:15] Therefore, since we are surrounded, this
[1:17:17] is amplified version, by so great a
[1:17:20] cloud of witnesses who by faith have
[1:17:22] testified to the truth of God's absolute
[1:17:24] faithfulness, stripping off every
[1:17:26] unnecessary weight in the sin which so
[1:17:28] easily and cleverly entangles us. Let us
[1:17:30] run with endurance and active
[1:17:32] persistence the race that is set before
[1:17:34] us. Now, this is it. Verse two, looking
[1:17:37] away from all that will distract us and
[1:17:40] focusing our eyes on Jesus who is the
[1:17:42] author and perfector of faith, the first
[1:17:45] incentive for our belief and the one who
[1:17:47] brings our faith to maturity. Who for
[1:17:50] the joy of accomplishing the goal set
[1:17:53] before him endured the cross,
[1:17:56] disregarding the shame and sat down at
[1:17:58] the right hand of the throne of God,
[1:18:00] revealing his deity, his authority, and
[1:18:02] the completion of his work. See, it's
[1:18:05] all been completed in him. But we've got
[1:18:07] to get our eyes off of this world. We've
[1:18:09] got to get our eyes off of one another
[1:18:11] and get our eyes on him. Turn away from
[1:18:14] everything. Because when he was in the
[1:18:15] garden of Gethsemane,
[1:18:17] he said, "Oh God, let this cut pass from
[1:18:19] me if it be possible." But yet, he
[1:18:21] endured that knowing what the shame was
[1:18:23] going to be. Because the shame
[1:18:27] that is talked about here was the
[1:18:29] crucifixion.
[1:18:31] Because sometimes the public shame of
[1:18:33] the cross is overlooked. When one thinks
[1:18:35] of the pain and agony inflicted by it.
[1:18:37] But in the Roman Empire, crucifixion was
[1:18:39] a shameful and disgraceful way to die. A
[1:18:42] form of capital punishment from which
[1:18:44] Roman citizens were exempt. And in Roman
[1:18:47] comedy, it was used as a curse. Go to
[1:18:50] the bad cross.
[1:18:52] Well, think about that. how that he he
[1:18:54] laid aside everything and he paid the
[1:18:57] price to redeem us.
[1:19:01] How can we turn that aside?
[1:19:03] How can we just let that just go?
[1:19:08] Paul said, "How shall we escape if we
[1:19:10] neglect so great a salvation?
[1:19:13] If you neglect your garden, you're going
[1:19:14] to have weeds in it. If you neglect your
[1:19:17] family, you're going to have problems.
[1:19:19] Let's not neglect this salvation. Let's
[1:19:21] nurture it. Let's feed it every day with
[1:19:24] the water of the word.
[1:19:26] Amen. Feed on that mana. Feed on that
[1:19:28] old corn that's in that new land. Amen.
[1:19:31] That's where we're at. Let it stand this
[1:19:33] evening.
[1:19:45] Got some prayer requests here.

[1:21:56] everything. So,
[1:21:58] I believe the Lord can restore it. I
[1:22:01] believe the Lord can do that. And I
[1:22:02] believe the Lord can take every one of
[1:22:04] these needs that we have. And why don't

[1:22:29] condition."

[1:23:55] for that request for him, for that Harry
[1:23:58] Cruz that he worked with, Lord.
[1:24:00] Father, I just ask that you would just
[1:24:02] be merciful in that condition. He has a
[1:24:05] tumor that they found, Lord. He said
[1:24:07] he's a wonderful Christian man. God, I

[1:24:38] a miracle working God. You're the God

[1:26:09] be no permanent damage or anything,
[1:26:11] Lord, and that he can he can get back to
[1:26:13] work, Lord, and and uh and just heal his

[1:26:24] going on, Lord, as so much so much
[1:26:27] turmoil in the world, Lord, but he's
[1:26:29] over there on a mission, dear God. He's
[1:26:31] on a mission to bring the word of God,
[1:26:33] Lord. And Father, and to plant those
[1:26:34] seeds, Lord, and to water those seeds,
[1:26:37] Lord, that's been planted. Father, I
[1:26:38] pray, Lord, that you would just be with
[1:26:40] our precious brother, God. And just keep
[1:26:42] him safe, Lord. God, may he have a
[1:26:44] prosperous time, Lord, in the word as he
[1:26:46] cast that net out, dear Father. We know
[1:26:48] the harvest is ripe, the laborers are
[1:26:50] few, God, would you bless that laborer
[1:26:53] over there, Lord? Lord, in return,
[1:26:55] Father, his luggage that he needs, God,
[1:26:58] I know that he needs those suits. He
[1:26:59] needs his Bible, Lord. He needs all
[1:27:01] those things, Father. And Lord, we know
[1:27:02] that you, Lord, you you told him where
[1:27:05] Brother Evans's car was one time. You
[1:27:07] found the ponies that time, dear Lord,
[1:27:09] through your prophet. God, I know that
[1:27:11] you can do the same thing, Lord,
[1:27:12] tonight. Dear God, we're praying for
[1:27:14] that. And dear Lord, we ask also for
[1:27:17] brother Dale and that brother out there,
[1:27:19] Neil Mer. He needs a supernatural
[1:27:22] intervention to restore his kidneys,
[1:27:24] Lord. God, I know that you can just
[1:27:26] create new kidneys, Lord. You can you
[1:27:28] can make him like a brand new man again,
[1:27:30] dear Father. And Lord, we know, dear
[1:27:32] Father, that you are the same yesterday,
[1:27:34] today, and forever. Now, we we can't
[1:27:36] touch him. We can't lay hands on him.
[1:27:38] But oh God, by faith believing, Lord, we
[1:27:40] can reach out, dear Lord, and know that
[1:27:42] you are a healer, Lord. For you said,
[1:27:44] "These signs shall follow them that
[1:27:46] believe, Lord. We don't follow signs,
[1:27:48] but they follow us. And God, we thank
[1:27:50] you. We praise you in in advance, Lord,
[1:27:53] for all of these requests, knowing that
[1:27:55] you'll meet every one of them, dear God.
[1:27:57] In Jesus name we pray. Amen.

[1:30:51] True.
[1:30:54] It is my joy to
[1:30:58] you
[1:31:00] in
[1:31:01] [Music]
[1:31:06] you.
[1:31:07] Amen. Amen. Is there any other needs
[1:31:10] before we have testimony time? Anybody?
[1:31:15] You got one?
[1:31:19] Uh, I'd like to give a praise report. I
[1:31:21] had a um a lost wallet. So, I know we
[1:31:24] all have had many prayer requests for
[1:31:25] people find things, but uh had a really
[1:31:27] really cool one. So, Friday night went
[1:31:29] in to get food. I think I left my wallet
[1:31:31] there, at least in my mind, because I
[1:31:33] remember pulling it out and uh so I
[1:31:35] didn't realize it until Monday. So, I
[1:31:36] don't like didn't use it all weekend.
[1:31:38] Didn't need it. And I was like, man,
[1:31:39] where's my wallet? Oh, no. So, I called
[1:31:42] Chris A. John because Chris, he's back
[1:31:43] here somewhere. But he that was the
[1:31:45] restaurant. I went and got the food. So
[1:31:46] I said, "Chris, can you please check the
[1:31:48] camera? Can you please ask?" He's he
[1:31:49] called me back about an hour later. He
[1:31:50] was like, "Man, I was closing." But I
[1:31:52] looked, man. I asked the manager. I
[1:31:53] looked in the drawer. There's no
[1:31:55] cameras, but
[1:31:57] I I I'll keep praying. I was like,
[1:31:58] "Thanks, Chris." And so we started
[1:32:00] talking and like he started testifying.
[1:32:01] He was like, "Man, I can tell you so
[1:32:03] many miraculous things that's happened
[1:32:05] to me. Like, so just believe, man." And
[1:32:07] I was like, "Absolutely, man. You pray."
[1:32:09] And so I started telling him about some
[1:32:11] different testimonies and I hung up and
[1:32:12] I felt really good and I was like man
[1:32:14] you know what I picked up my phone and I
[1:32:15] was like I was going to type you know
[1:32:18] find your wallet and put it back in your
[1:32:19] car. Instead I wrote put wallet back in
[1:32:22] cart because I just took a step of faith
[1:32:24] that I am going to have my wallet in the
[1:32:25] morning. No joke before I was fully
[1:32:28] awake it was like God gave me a dream
[1:32:30] and I flashed in my mind and saw my
[1:32:32] wallet on my desk. And so I got up and I
[1:32:34] went to work and when I walked in my
[1:32:36] office there it was. And I was like, I
[1:32:38] don't know if it was there, but if he
[1:32:39] put it there, but praise God. So,
[1:32:43] [Applause]
[1:32:50] I believe he put it there.
[1:32:53] So, I had the same thing like two weeks
[1:32:56] ago. Um, we had a prayer request put in
[1:32:59] for that tool that I lost. Like, I had
[1:33:03] no idea where it was. I checked three
[1:33:05] different customer houses.
[1:33:07] It was like kind of embarrassing having
[1:33:09] to go like, "Hey, I did a stupid thing."
[1:33:13] But I went all the way through this
[1:33:15] whole thing and then put that request in
[1:33:17] Wednesday and I was like, you know, I
[1:33:18] just I need it bad. Like that's a tool
[1:33:22] that I'd use every single day. And I
[1:33:26] asked either for him to like just make
[1:33:29] it appear in the back of the van or put
[1:33:32] an image in my mind where it was.
[1:33:35] So,
[1:33:36] in the back of my mind, I'd already
[1:33:38] checked the different houses and
[1:33:40] everything, but in my back of my mind,
[1:33:41] it was like some little image that I was
[1:33:44] like, "No, I'm like making that up. It's
[1:33:47] probably not it. I don't know why I did
[1:33:50] that." But the next day, Thursday
[1:33:53] morning, I go and I check that little
[1:33:56] spot. I was like, you know, it's right
[1:33:57] around the corner. I'm just going to
[1:34:00] head in there. And it was right exactly
[1:34:02] where it was supposed to be. So it was
[1:34:06] about ready to start balling in front of
[1:34:08] customers and stuff. But I have another
[1:34:11] little testimony. Everybody that heard
[1:34:14] Congo, my dog got bit by a snake and it
[1:34:17] was kind of a scary deal cuz I was a
[1:34:20] ways away from the house and everything.
[1:34:21] I didn't know what kind of snake it was
[1:34:23] or anything like that. So, it was just
[1:34:28] immediately I called Gideon and I was
[1:34:30] like, "Hey, call your mom cuz she's the
[1:34:32] one that knows how to pray for dogs."
[1:34:34] So,
[1:34:36] um I immediately it was just so awesome
[1:34:39] knowing that there is such a resource to
[1:34:42] use that everybody was immediately went
[1:34:45] to prayer and it worked. He uh is back
[1:34:49] to his own self and he's doing good
[1:34:52] running around. So, no swelling. There's
[1:34:54] a little scab and that's it. So, it was
[1:34:56] a copper head that
[1:34:59] could have been bad, could have not been
[1:35:00] bad. I don't know. It just I fully
[1:35:03] believe it was the prayers that did it
[1:35:05] for him. But
[1:35:07] [Applause]
[1:35:13] those copperheads are no joke. Our
[1:35:14] neighbor um they lost their dog from it.
[1:35:17] So, that was the prayer to save that
[1:35:20] dog.
[1:35:25] So um one of the issues our baby has had
[1:35:28] um her umbilical cord only has one
[1:35:30] artery compared to other babies like all
[1:35:33] other babies who has two and basically
[1:35:37] it causes um your baby not to receive
[1:35:40] like proper nutrition and they can't
[1:35:42] like grow and develop like normally. So
[1:35:46] basically throughout my entire
[1:35:48] pregnancy, she has actually declined
[1:35:51] like as I like as every week has gone
[1:35:53] by, she has declined in the weight
[1:35:55] percentile. And when we went to the
[1:35:58] doctor um for an ultrasound at the end
[1:36:01] of April, she was in the third
[1:36:02] percentile. And then two Fridays ago, we
[1:36:06] met with the NICU doctor and it was a
[1:36:10] very long appointment, but just
[1:36:13] concerning that specific issue, she said
[1:36:16] that when she was born, like she would
[1:36:18] need multiple procedures. She would have
[1:36:21] to um she would definitely be in the
[1:36:23] NICU for over several weeks. Um she
[1:36:26] would have to have like IVs to give her
[1:36:30] like extra nutrition and proteins. um
[1:36:33] she would she would be so weak that she
[1:36:35] actually wouldn't even be able to eat on
[1:36:37] her own. So she would have to have a
[1:36:39] feeding tube. Um and that's just for her
[1:36:44] size. That's not even all the other
[1:36:46] stuff she would need for her other
[1:36:47] issues. Um and I had my ultrasound
[1:36:50] yesterday and one thing the doctor told
[1:36:54] us was that she won't even be 4 lb like
[1:36:58] if you carry her full term. And she
[1:37:00] weighed 4 lbs 13 ounces yesterday.
[1:37:03] And she, which is more than double in
[1:37:06] size from our last ultrasound, she only
[1:37:09] weighed 2.6.
[1:37:11] And she went from the third percentile
[1:37:13] to the 22nd. And my prayer for the
[1:37:16] appointment yesterday was that our baby
[1:37:18] would grow. Even if it was just one,
[1:37:21] like she went to the fifth percentile, I
[1:37:23] was going to be so happy. and the Lord
[1:37:25] exceeded my expectations like beyond
[1:37:28] like anything I could imagine. So, I'm
[1:37:30] just so grateful. And I know a lot of
[1:37:33] people probably don't understand weight
[1:37:34] percentiles, but basically like if your
[1:37:37] baby's in the 25th to like 50th, that's
[1:37:39] like perfectly normal. So, her size is
[1:37:42] pretty much perfectly normal. So, I'm
[1:37:44] just so grateful. Amen.
[1:37:55] You know, uh, recently I was sick and
[1:37:57] all y'all was praying for me, wondering
[1:37:59] what was wrong with me. Well, I just,
[1:38:02] uh, the Lord healed me because of
[1:38:04] y'all's prayers. But I got up on a
[1:38:06] Wednesday morning. I just felt terrible,
[1:38:08] just sick, scratchy throat, coughing,
[1:38:12] congestion, just slept a lot. And Jason
[1:38:16] insisted I stay home and isolate. And
[1:38:19] even sister Andrea come over and brought
[1:38:21] me flowers. I felt so bad I didn't
[1:38:23] invite her in the house, you know, cuz
[1:38:25] and it's a good thing because I had a
[1:38:28] doctor's appointment for a regular
[1:38:30] checkup. I had to reschedu it. And that
[1:38:33] was last Monday. And when I went to him
[1:38:36] and I said, "Yeah, I was sick and that's
[1:38:38] why I rescheduled." And he said, "What
[1:38:41] was wrong?" And I told him, he said, "I
[1:38:43] got a lot of patients like that. There's
[1:38:45] a new variant going around and I had CO.
[1:38:48] So, and God just protected all y'all and
[1:38:50] me and and healed me because y'all I
[1:38:53] just thought I wanted to tell y'all
[1:38:54] that. Appreciate your prayers so much.
[1:38:57] [Applause]
[1:39:03] Sister, I want to tell you where's Abby
[1:39:05] at? Hold. Raise your hand up. Abby.
[1:39:11] Matter of fact, come here for a minute.
[1:39:16] How many shades of red can that face
[1:39:18] turn? Just stand right here if you
[1:39:20] would. She was 2 lb and 4 ounces when
[1:39:24] she was born. Three months early. Didn't
[1:39:28] think we was even going to be able to
[1:39:30] raise her for the Lord. And we even had
[1:39:32] a friend who because she was in the NICU
[1:39:34] for three months and had a friend who
[1:39:36] was had already started to make a coffin
[1:39:39] for her because they weren't expecting
[1:39:40] her to make it. But we had some brothers
[1:39:43] who wouldn't take no for an answer. We
[1:39:45] wouldn't take what the devil had to say.
[1:39:47] And sister, I appreciate that testimony
[1:39:48] right there because we're not going to
[1:39:50] Well, I'm taking it back. We're going to
[1:39:51] take it back. Whatever Whatever the
[1:39:53] devil's trying to take from you, we're
[1:39:55] taking it back. Amen.
[1:39:57] My Anybody else? You're She's
[1:40:01] 2 lbs and 4 ounces.
[1:40:06] So, a couple of weeks ago, I was we were
[1:40:09] driving home from church and
[1:40:11] I told Aaron, I said, you know, I'm not
[1:40:14] normally an organ player, you know, um
[1:40:17] mostly a pianist. And I said, I can't
[1:40:19] really get better on the organ if I
[1:40:21] don't have one to practice at home with.
[1:40:23] And I just said that in passing. And I
[1:40:26] said, well, you know, it is what it is.
[1:40:28] So, it was about two weeks ago, I was at
[1:40:31] work and Aaron texted me. He said, I
[1:40:32] found you in Oregon. I said, 'Oh, that's
[1:40:34] that's great. Okay. So, I got home and
[1:40:38] he went and picked it up. It was
[1:40:39] Hammond, so I was really really excited
[1:40:41] and it was free from a church. Um, and
[1:40:45] so I'm just really grateful that God
[1:40:47] just honor. It wasn't even a prayer,
[1:40:48] just a thought that I just spoke because
[1:40:52] I really wanted to improve. So,
[1:41:01] God hath the praise of his people.
[1:41:06] Well, brother Chris Watkins asked me to
[1:41:09] give this testimony. So, um, two weeks
[1:41:11] ago, um, you all know I was living with
[1:41:14] in brother Jason's camper and that
[1:41:17] situation changed. He decided to sell
[1:41:18] it. So, I had to find a new place to go
[1:41:20] and I thought I had everything worked
[1:41:23] out and um I was going to I I managed,
[1:41:28] you know, to make arrangements to get a
[1:41:30] camper from Brother Canada and then to
[1:41:31] move I thought in the very same spot I
[1:41:34] was at, but that guy kind of like
[1:41:37] stopped communicating with me because I
[1:41:39] guess that place was getting shut down
[1:41:40] where I was living. So,
[1:41:42] um
[1:41:44] on Yeah. So, two weeks ago today, I woke
[1:41:47] up at 10:00 in the morning, find out I
[1:41:48] had to move because the camper is being
[1:41:50] sold. So, I put everything in storage
[1:41:52] and then didn't know what I was going to
[1:41:54] do. And then, but what I was getting to
[1:41:57] say, I guess I'm getting ahead of
[1:41:58] myself, but the night before I was on
[1:42:00] the phone with my brother and I have a
[1:42:02] half brother. Um, anyway, and I told him
[1:42:04] I'm going to use the same faith and just
[1:42:06] like when I the same day I left the
[1:42:09] motel, brother Jason, it was put on his
[1:42:12] heart to put me in this camper. So I
[1:42:14] said and I didn't know where I was going
[1:42:15] to go when I left that motel. So I would
[1:42:17] just the same aspect I was like well
[1:42:19] whatever happens I'm gonna be okay. And
[1:42:21] so I worked everything out where I was
[1:42:24] able to get the camper and also the very
[1:42:28] same day I found a place to put it. And
[1:42:30] the guy that I rented it from still has
[1:42:33] not even asked me for anything right
[1:42:34] now. He's just do you need anything? And
[1:42:37] just making sure I'm all settled in and
[1:42:39] everything. and he helped me get some
[1:42:40] stuff that I needed like an extension
[1:42:42] cord and some other stuff. And then also
[1:42:45] I wanted to say um that my new employer
[1:42:50] um they're Christians and um they really
[1:42:53] done a lot to help me out and I don't
[1:42:54] ask people I try not to ask anybody for
[1:42:56] anything and one thing I needed for the
[1:42:58] camper was a 20 foot extension of a
[1:43:00] waistline. Well, you can't really buy
[1:43:02] one in Buford. So he ordered one on
[1:43:04] Amazon and when it came in he said see
[1:43:07] if that works. And I said I did. how
[1:43:09] much do I owe you? He said, I owe you
[1:43:10] nothing and or I owe him nothing. So, I
[1:43:13] thanked him for that. And I just wanted
[1:43:16] just say that still like I know I'm
[1:43:19] trying my best to always be here and I
[1:43:20] know it's a the greatest place to be
[1:43:23] because just the other day like I never
[1:43:25] have any fellowship really. If I'm
[1:43:27] working or if I'm not working or if I'm
[1:43:30] not here, I'm always alone. And the
[1:43:32] other day, um, me and Chris and John
[1:43:34] Watkins, we went bird watching for like
[1:43:36] two hours. And,
[1:43:38] you know, it was like the greatest thing
[1:43:40] ever just to be able to be with
[1:43:42] Christians and the children of God and
[1:43:44] have fellowship. And it really just warm
[1:43:46] my soul. I just want to thank God for
[1:43:47] all these things.
[1:43:55] Praise the Lord. I think we've we've
[1:43:57] prayed, we've given praise, we've heard
[1:43:58] the word, and I think we could depart
[1:44:01] from here. Brother, you want to sing
[1:44:03] something as we go?
[1:44:07] I'm going to turn up my praise
[1:44:11] and drown out the doubt.
[1:44:14] I'm holding my shield of faith
[1:44:18] and I feel no alarm
[1:44:22] when the enemy comes.

[1:47:33] and I overcome.
