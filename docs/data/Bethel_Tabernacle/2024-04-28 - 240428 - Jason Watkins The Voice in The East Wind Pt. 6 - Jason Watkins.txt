TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you'll find that bethseda we were there is near the Sea of Galilee this is where it's at and so you have the Sea of Galilee which is where bethseda is this is where he feeds 5,000 then he's going to feed 4,000 and where he feeds the 4,000 is near the region of the gisin gism remember that and so the first location is Betha it's Jewish it's a Jewish City it's to the Jews right so the first here's 5,000 he feeds the first location the numbers for that first location the people who he feeds them who breaks the fishes and the loaves is Jewish it's a Jewish Community the second is the gines and the gines are Gentiles so you catching it the first time he feeds the Jews the second time he feeds the Gentiles you follow those twos remember only two groups of people only two ways God looks at everything and so he feeds 5,000 here 4,000 here one's to the Jews one's to the Gentiles right also the numbers are a perfect match the feeding of 5,000 is representative of the Jews Five Loaves 5,000 representing what the old Covenant the Torah what is five the first Five Books of Moses is the Torah so it's it's a representation that this feeding or this opening or understanding is coming to the Jews it's going to be 5,000 it's going to be in a Jewish City it's going to represent the first five books of Moses the Torah and guess how many baskets they end up with 12 wow brother Enoch someone say wow 12 you think God does any of this by accident he doesn't 12 tribes five books Five Loaves representing 12 then brother Matt surely the 4,000 couldn't add up either well the the 4,000 represents the Gentiles because there's how many loaves are used hello we just read it there's seven loaves seven Church ages seven Church age Messengers the fullness of the Gentiles there's seven loads and guess how many baskets they end up with seven it's a perfect representation of the Gentile dispensation and the Jewish dis dispensation because right now this is what's about you say brother Matt what do you saying I'm saying that God has a language and if you just read the Bible and gloss over it and you just you'll get an understanding from it but brother Brandon says above all else pray for Revelation but why brother mat because Revelation is God God's language he doesn't just you say can he use knowledge he does can he speak to me through through just learning the Bible by hearing the Bible studies all of that's important friends but I just want to tell you brother Brandon would say it this way it it's not going to take normal just brother my brother came to brother Bram said oh brother brandham the only way I can only way to understand God is to you got to study the Greek and study the Hebrew and study the languages and and and prophet of God says that's all right but let me tell you what that's what that's produced it's just produced seminaries and churches and churches churches and Peoples Peoples but there there would come something greater than a human dialect or understanding because God was going to call a people and that those people would understand the word or the mystery of the word not through understanding or reasoning or rational thought but through Revelation can you say Amen are you glad for it Lord we give you thanks this morning Father for your word lord it's our portion as David said I pray God that you would take these things that I said Lord and God may you add to it God may you give Grace unto the hearer Lord Jesus may it produce something in our life we ask bless the service the worship Lord God that'll go

amen amen happy to have all of our visitors here with us amen praise the Lord Exodus 12 we're going to be looking at the part six of the voice in the East Wind and so uh we're just want to get right into it verse one Exodus 12 verse one I think I sent back that we would read down through verse 13 I believe all right verse one and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron uh in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of month so this would be on their calendar abib their first month or Nissan which would correspond to our March or April it shall be the first month of the year to you speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the 10th day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for an house and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next un to him take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish is a perfect type of Christ your lamb shall be without blemish and male of the first year you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and he and ye shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take the blood and strike it on the two side post and on the upper doorpost of the house so it would make a perfect cross amen it's over the top and it's on the sides all right and they shall take the blood and strike it on the two sides of the post on the upper doorpost of the house wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the Flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread with bitter herbs shall they shall eat e it eat not of it raw nor Soden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the pertinence thereof you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning you shall burn with fire and thus shall you eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt so they called it the Passover because the Lord the death angel passed over their houses and they did not suffer the death angel so it's a Passover meal to the Jews to this day let's pray Lord we thank you for your word now that we've read and I pray Lord for your anointing Spirit to be upon me as we go at a a a a measured Pace today Lord teaching the word of God a very very critical lesson today Lord very important perhaps the most important lesson that we could receive from the message of the hour Lord Brother brandham called it the very highlight of his ministry and that was taking into account all the great Miracles that had happened around the world and the tens of thousands of prophetic word that had went forth and he said the token was the highlight so Lord we ask for your mercy now as we look into it and father we'll go as far as today as we feel till we feel the tug of the Holy Spirit and the people have absorbed enough and Lord and we'll we'll carry on uh in services to come we commit it now to you give me wisdom as I go forward Lord I Thank you for the wonderful spirit I feel in my heart and my mind this morning I feel well rested I I feel just happy in my thoughts Lord and I'm happy happy to have the family of God here today Lord may you bless our our family who are out on the road traveling and in meetings in various places Lord perhaps they'll catch this by a stream as we already know some have told me they would some will catch it by an archive we commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated all right brother Gideon let's have the uh PowerPoint amen so I covet your undivided attention today it'll be very important not only because we have a very important topic but because it's I'm going to take it today like U almost like it' be like an extended Sunday school class amen and your Sunday school teacher was going man I thought who was that masked man he was he was he was not stopping so amen we were but I was enjoying it amen I was enjoying that breakdown so we're going to your your minds are already in that mindset I'm sure you were here for the for the Sunday school class and so we want to continue on in a teaching vein now I have a lot of things I want to say I already know I'm not going to get to all of them I have a lot of quotes on this slide 58 slides I already know I'm not going to get to all of them it's okay breathe everything will be fine you know me I won't do that to you there is no death worse than being drugged to death and so we won't do that we'll go at a pace and a clip and uh but I want to unburden at least a certain portion of it of my heart today it's teaching so you're going to want to pay Keen attention so if you'll give me your undivided attention for 60 70 minutes or so we will we'll pull the shoot stand on the brakes as brother juel said and we'll get her on the ground praise the Lord Brother Don I appreciated your text I got that early this morning when I was up very early I appreciate that my brother all right so we're talking about the voice in the East Wind and we are taking today for for a subtit or not there not a subtitle that's coming next but our topic is the identification of Christ in our lives and and we are looking at a subtopic of the final plague and this is part two we carried on with part one from uh we started on part one of the final plague on Wednesday and we were showing you uh some amazing things concerning the token I don't want to don't have any time to go back and recap I would like to recommend that if you did not get that sermon please take the time and make my many hours of effort and study and prayer worth it will you do that if you didn't weren't here and you haven't heard it yet please go back find you a quiet 45 or 60 minutes where you can listen to it without interruption because as I say the token is perhaps I I if it is if not the most if not the actually the most important message that we have it's certainly one of the most important right at the top now I have a number of quotes and I just want to lead in a little bit because I know how I know how it is when you have a lot of quotes and of course my I have so many because I like my slides to be legible My sl my slides usually only have three four five uh if it has six sentences that's a lot because I don't put a lot on a slide I would rather take a slide that I you know that you can't read because it's you know 20 lines long and you can't read it anyway and I'll break it up into three or four slides so that's partly why I have so many so it will go quickly all right you good all right now in these quotes that we are going to look at from brother brandham he preached uh the token four different times and and I'm got quotes from the one called token that he preached in 63 at his home Tabernacle in Jeffersonville I also have one uh another one that he preached uh sometime later in 1963 I believe in November and uh I'm not sure where he preached that but then I also have some quotes from when he preached it in February of 1964 and then he came one month later to the day uh in uh in Dallas and he preached it on March uh I believe March the uh the uh 8th in Dallas and and and he preached it those four times I think that that those four dates I almost put it on the on on this morning I almost put my first screen up to list those four dates along with my wday sermon and along with today's sermon and say these are dates which for you bethl Tabernacle I hope will live in infamy because they are so important to us as an assem and and actually I don't have I I realized that by the time I went through his first three sermons by the time I got to the fourth one everything was just repeating and I eliminated all the repeating unless it was absolutely necessary uh so I would recommend you that uh after this series today and maybe next week that you get that fourth part in fact is don't wait go ahead this week and get that fourth one preached in March of 1964 because I I'm not quoting from it in this lesson I have no plans to but it is fantastic and so brother brandom really demonstrates the the word there in Dallas Texas now in these quotes brother brandham I want you to to realize and and I'm going to help you because I want you to stay with me I don't want you to get lost in the shuffle so whenever I'm teaching I'm constantly I don't just like to read endlessly and and quote endlessly because you're sitting there hearing it and after a while it goes and you're like what what is he even saying and it just becomes words so my way of teaching is I like to tip you off in advance of what you're going to see this is what we're going in to look for all right so in these quotes brother brandham as he starts out is going to focus on the blood of Jesus as the token during the early part of the sermon uh in all three in all four sermons he does that he starts out by saying you know the blood of Jesus is the token and and and why wouldn't he because when we read in Exodus 12 God said this shall the blood shall be to you a token but brother brandham is going to explain that correct because that was under the Old Testament under the chemistry of the blood that that that it there had to be something painted on the outside of their dwelling because was the life of that lamb even though they had kept it up from the 10th to the 14th even though it was spotless a year of the fir lamb of the first year even though it was exactly what God had ordered according to his word and even though they followed the preparation and the consumption of it uh but nonetheless the innocent life of that lamb could not come back on them so at that time you're going to hear brother Brandon say all they could do was paint a representation using that blood of what it stood for in coming ages so that when you get to the coming ages it won't any longer be the chemistry of the blood See it'll actually be the life that was inside the blood that comes back on you and that's the token all right so he's going to progressively shift our understanding towards the Holy Spirit and not the blood the chemistry of the blood as the acceptable token in this end time hour and so that's where we are friends we have arrived at the end time hour and that's why uh the they they kept up a lamb for from the 10th to the 14th and and brother brandom is going to type that into the church ages they had the lamb in the church ages but at the evening time there had to be a display of the token they couldn't just keep keep keeping it in the pin they actually had to slay it and take the blood and put they couldn't just put it in a jar on the table they couldn't just be circumcised they had to actually display their token in order for the death angel to come to their door and see the blood and hear the voice of the blood remember he said thy brother he said to Cain the voice of thy brother's blood crith out to me so the the so in God's mind when there was life in blood then that blood had a voice and and even though Abel was he was dead the the fact that the life given by God had been in his blood the voice was still speaking see a lot of times people don't realize that when you leave this life you're not excluded from all your sins it still is speaking you're still going to go to a judgment see so death and people take their own life thinking they're going to get out of their pain that's only going from the frying pan into the fire that only makes the situation worse so death doesn't change anything no one has actually ever died yet no one there's never been anyone actually died yet they're they're all still very much alive in either a realm of the lost or the or somewhere under the altar of God under the land in the lands of the redeemed one of those two places there's no Purgatory well there is and you're in it now this is the in between Place amen and I don't need a priest to pray me out of here and I don't need to go buy a candle I can get I I can escape this and I've got a promise that I will escape it all right so so it's it's the evening time you're to eat it in haste and so these are little Clues to us how urgent this message ought to be in our minds it ought to be urgent because by the time the evening time came listen they had spent they had spent 430 years and then they had spent four days pinning a lamb up and then they had to go through the whole process of slaughtering it but at but from the time it came to the evening time to the slang to to the to the putting it on the on and consuming it and putting it on their house and burning The Leftovers the next morning they were leaving just from one evening and the evening and the morning was a new day Hallelujah and that's where you and I have arrived friends we have arrived at the evening time and I'm telling you it's not going to be long it can't be long so it's an urgent hour and this is what brother Brandon is really trying to stress and I suppose that that this has got to be the chief stressing point is that we have arrived at a at a time and a moment an Epoch in history we have arrived at the moment that God's family and God have waited for through centuries and it and it has brought forth a chain and you need to get that something has changed and what used to work legitimately will no longer work see now so brother brandham is going to go he's going to progressively move from the blood he's going to actually say it the blood is the token and then he'll progressively shift our understanding towards the Holy Spirit and not the blood as the acceptable token in this in this end time hour now progression of course is the plan of being the plan of God I mean that's very obvious very noticeable in the word we we see how that you you had an age of you know you can take you can take Noah's day and the Earth received its baptism then you can come to Calvary and the blood of Jesus dripped on the earth so it so it was it was baptized under Noah it was Sanctified under Jesus and then the Holy Ghost came in the upper room and created a kingdom of God on the earth so you can see this progressiveness brother Brandon would then take those three events and overlay that with justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Spirit which must be distinctly understood as more by far than what struck the isua revivalist the the isua Revival in brother Bram taught us in many specs could just be an extension of of the Philadelphian age because it an Open Door gets set at the End of the Age which is a open door's always a revelation it's an Open Door of Christ and they're going to begin to catch some revelation after Wesley's gone because he died as a trinitarian and then you're going to have men at the end of the 1800s coming on the scene like parum and lake and Grant and Seymour and Wigglesworth and and and and Bosworth and and Bosworth brothers and the the the man who wrote uh only believe I forget his name but those those men were great men that came up out of that Revival and they were catching the revelation of the of the restoration of the deity of Jesus and so they started uh something unheard of they started baptizing according to acts 238 they started declaring that the Trinity is not a correct Doctrine see so so we find that that it then brother Bram talked about how that that Revival restored some of the power that the church ought to have had but it was lacking and so it brought back some of the power but that's uh that certainly was not the long awaited restoration of the word back to the original abstract title deed which would restore the full token to the church that comes under the opening of the word in our hour and only because it's Progressive so we find that God does it that way so we find then that he he baptized it under Noah he Sanctified it under the blood of Calvary and then the holy ghost in the New Testament which was a New Covenant God made a New Covenant with mankind that's what the New Testament is see and so and eventually it would become a claiming work of the Lamb to claim his Lamb's Book of Life now Paul just I'm just trying to help your mind in case in case you're coming to hear brother bradam say here this used to work and there was scripture for it but now it doesn't work anymore now other parts of the scripture have taken those scriptures further and you no longer can find God's satisfaction back here any longer now Paul in in his sermon if it troubles your mind you can find acts 17 and we're not going to turn to it today I'm just trying to move through uh my my introduction so Paul speaking you know to the to the Jewish Church there and they're struggling with that they're struggling with 1600 years we we have the law of Moses and we had sacrifices and 1600 years you're telling us Paul that all of the things that we did and you know and and and we we had the uh we we had the Ark of the Covenant and we had you know the brass serpent we had the the labor and we had all of these different things and we had the Great temple and Paul is trying to come to say listen listen verse 30 and of the times of this ignorance God wined at but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent so there was a time in the Old Testament that he gave them a workable solution that couldn't do away with their sin but it it could it it literally held off judgment God the Bible shows how that he restrained pouring out judgment waiting for the Lamb of God so that his his judgment could be satisfied lest he destroy all of his creation so we find then that Paul is saying yes it used to work but now he requireth every man to repent Peter told you that on the day of Pentecost and I'm coming behind Peter to say this is what you have to do you can't just be a devout Jew anymore Peter was preaching to Devout Jews not hor mongers not drunkards devout Jews and Peter was saying You must repent you must change your mind you must be baptized in his name and now Paul is saying yeah Peter wasn't wrong you used to have a system that system God honored it God gave it to you but God doesn't honor it anymore he now requires you to come forward in the word amen amen so this is all through the Bible I don't have time to get bogged down in it today we can see it in nature a child comes through water blood and spirit that's and and that's a spiritual type of the three stages of redemption so we realize that that that Christ when Christ died not only as a baby born through water blood and then life or Spirit we find that Christ died and he released when the Roman spear pierced his side then brother brandham said out the Bible says out come water and blood and brother branam shows it came water blood and life say now wait a minute he was already dead correct his human life had already left the body it expired but there was a life inside his blood that made him a unique human you understand he wasn't like Solomon he wasn't like you and me exactly he was kind of he was 100% a man but he was also 100% God we got the quote here for it in a minute so we find then that brother brandham said that released the bride and what does that even mean it released the life that was in brother brandham said that Roman the tip of that Roman spear pierced that original spoken word blood cell from which all the other blood cells had multiplied from that's how he was virgin born it wasn't wasn't God seed in Mary's egg God created both a fertilized seed and the Egg and fertilized it himself and that blood cell and God's life was put inside that blood cell all right you're going to see all this just in a moment so we find then that that that that that life then comes out of him when that blood cell is released and that releases a bride how so because listen as I've said to you before in Isaiah 42 there's only one elected son there's only one people get upset when we talk about election though it's a Bible word and a Bible teaching and I and I I A lot of times you can they say oh you think you're elected you think you're some elitism say no listen there's only one elected son and that's Christ according to Isaiah 42 well how did you get elected I was in him I was in Christ before the foundation of the world I'm a part of him so when his life came out I came out and that life came back in the church and found people like you and me see and it brought that brought a new birth something that had never happened the Holy Ghost had fallen upon people it fell on Moses it fell on the prophets but they were never born again it couldn't remain on them see so so we find then that that the church ages we're just looking at progression now just so that so that you don't struggle with these things that brand is going to say it's it's the Bible is replete and nature is replete with these kinds of examples the church ages came through justification sanctification and the Holy Spirit baptism which is the token Luther and Wesley and all the reformers they had you're going to hear Brother brandham show you they had the true lamb brother Bram said don't say they didn't have the Holy Ghost they certainly did don't say they weren't born again they certainly were they're part of the first resurrection however because of the limit of what they had they without us can never be made perfect it's going to take you and I for the finishing piece and that's going to bring them up out of the grave and then we which are alive and remain will be changed oh friends you're you're in a part of something you're in the big middle of the greatest event 6,000 years in the making and God's just that close to getting his family home don't forsake it now my goodness don't let anyone Sidetrack you or distract you or disuade you God has sent the greatest lifegiving word since Jesus walked the shores of Galilee see so Luther and Wesley and all the reformers they had the true lamb they had faith in the real Christ but but but remember they would have been if you're running your types in the Old Testament brother brandham ties them back to the era when the lamb was pinned up not the evening time the token only came at the evening time Luther and Wesley had the true lamb but it's during the time when it's being pinned up and it's and and it's going from the 10th to the 14th day allowing for inspection allowing for Preparation but the token was at even it was an even evening time event this is clear amen so of course the token being on display in the true living members of the true church is not a new thing the early church certainly had it on display brother brandom said they absolutely had the abstract title deed they had the ministry of the son of man they were the word made flesh in a bride they certainly had the full word see we don't get more more Revelation every revelation we have is based on what Paul taught and if that's not true tell me which Doctrine we have that he didn't teach I've challenged men who try to say we go further our Revelation well and they don't stop there our relation goes further than William brandom good grief what you just like get hit by a truck how can you possibly say that you know and and you can't go beyond what Paul Paul said no nobody can add to what I've laid down here all you can do is build on what I've said Paul's words could not be countermanded even by God because God gave Paul his words and God can't change his mind about his word see so there is no Doctrine and I I've challenge them to please give me the doctrine that we believe that we understand that Paul didn't preach on even even even when John comes back with the Book of Revelation and it gets open to us in the end time by a Prophet Elijah guess what it lines up with everything Paul taught us Paul wasn't even here and he was preaching the teachings of the Book of Revelation was already gone when it come back that's why you never hear him quote quote from it but yet everything that's in it is based on what he taught so it's not a it's not a it's not a situation you know I just said which Doctrine I'm predestination election the the serpent seed water baptism the godhead marriage and divorce who is this mdic which one the Rapture mystery the coming of the mighty one which one the man of sin to be revealed which one which Doctrine do we have that came out of the opening of the seals that doesn't amplify and bring to perfect understanding what the Apostle taught us dis obey Paul at your own Peril this is why brother Brandon was thankful he only ever taught what Paul taught and nobody can disprove that say well he says those Millions shouted we're resting on that well I believe that story but even if that story wasn't a story I would to Simply say to you find which which Doctrine is in this message that can't be proven by Paul's Doctrine there's not one I've challenged that around the world I'm T taking taking all comers I've been for 30 40 years proving this Bible proving the message in the Bible back and forth back and forth they dovetail flawlessly there's no contradiction them at all and they bring life and Liberty to God's family like nothing the world has got a hold of see so so I know I don't need to say that here that's just uh preaching to the choir here let me move on so we find then that that they certainly had the token in the in the alpha Church they had it on display uh because you're going to find out that to be on display means it's a display in your life I don't need brother bradam didn't need and Jesus doesn't need you to go home and paint anything on your house to prove you're a Christian he doesn't need you to put a cross on your front door or draw a fish on your car are he doesn't need you to wear a crucifix around your neck you're welcome to do any and all the above but that's not what he's talking about it's the voice of my life that proves so they certainly had it on display but the seed like Christ of course we know in the ages it had to go into the ground just like Jesus did they wanted him to be a king right away he couldn't do that it broke the it broke all the the types and shadows that had already been set over 4 thousand years of Old Testament history it wasn't he wasn't going to undo all of that and so just like Christ the seed had to go under the ground the church had to go into the ground they fell away and so we are H you say well do we go do we come to anything further than the early church we do and that is a body change so they didn't get a body change we get a body change so this message has restored back the original teaching to take us back to the Apex of where the early church began to Crest over and decline we go back to that Apex and carry it on to the Millennium see and the only way to do that is by we have the restoration of the same word see all right so through water through blood through Spirit justification sanctification and the return of the original Full Life of Christ on display again that is the message of the token amen it's on display yeah it's not about 4 days from the 10th to the 14th it's not it is about that but it's not mainly about that it's not it is about eating it in haste but it's not mainly about it eating in haste it is burning it with fire but it's not mainly about that what it mainly is is that life has to be on display that's what it means when brother brandham says apply the token people sometimes don't know what that they say they hear him say apply the token what does that even mean it means to display the Life of Christ in your life we're not just talking about a a modern idea of the Life of Christ we're talking about a life that they had in the early church where it makes men the kind of men that live back there and women the kind of Bible ladies that they had back there see so it it brings the same power do you believe it it brings the same author it it it bring and and you know and you know what it come you know how we get there God's already did his part he's already given us the the word what what is our part is to put it on display we we say oh I want the same power I want the same Authority well it takes the same dedication it takes the same kind of sincerity you have to be indwelled by the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead when it happened in the alpha age it established the church and the literally wrote a book of Acts behind it it must do that again it must do the same thing in this hour for we live in an unparalleled day want me to tell you something friends your family is growing up in Satan's Eden with every modern trap imaginable and many that'll be invented you can't even imagine and we're already seeing things that were just science fiction just a decade ago go I'm here to tell you listen to me well your family is being raised and reared in Satan's Eden it is an unprecedented time it is an unparalleled day you cannot afford to not have the token on display applied to your home applied to your life amen see your family is growing up and it's there's every modern trap of the devil it's more needed now than in any hour before so since it was lost Through the Ages and is now fully restored it becomes necessary to recognize it again and to observe it again and this is what brother brandham really is pointing to in all four of those sermons we must come back to be like the first church in the book of Acts brother Henry green loved him long ago gone old War General from back in the day my childhood and he used to always say God started his church like he wanted it and now he wants it like he started it hallelujah how many bethl Tabernacle will agree with that so the token was how the early church was identified the token on display in their lives was was how the early church was identified as separate and different from the false church that began to be formed right after the outpouring of the Holy Ghost in the upper room and it looked just like the true church there it hadn't had all this time yet to be way apart right at at that point it had not turned from the truth un fables it was still it still looked just like it still looked just like the truth and you could hardly tell it apart except it began to get a little rough around the edges and they begin to take people in the church who weren't actually getting born again you see a few you see a few uh episodes you see ananas and saf lying to the Holy Ghost and you know it's amazing I I don't know how trinitarian gets around the fact that they lied to the Holy Ghost and Peter said you haven't lied to man you've lied to God so which one do I mean is God or is it God or is it the Holy Ghost which one you lie to so so we find then that the token on display was and that's the life on display that was the difference between those who were True Believers and those who what we call today and we coin a modern phrase called easy believism now uh actually Billy Graham is the one attributed with first coining that phrase easy believism and uh you know our dear precious brother and brother brandham loved him and I think he was a great man and I know he'll have a reward but brother brandham said the flaw in his ministry he didn't call it a flaw that's my word but brother brandham talks about the problem that was there was that he only brought the people through a decision and he didn't take them all the way to the new birth and he said I come into a city and I have 30,000 vergins at the altar and I come back in a year and I can't find 30 still fighting the fight of faith that still looked like him he was a real Christian see and so so we realized then that his ministry actually uh he he didn't recognize it uh there's no indication he ever recognized it but his ministry helped along easy believism now it wasn't a new they had that in the early church uh that was called gnosticism and different things like that and they they immediately um began to try to pull away from uh the token being on display in Godly Lifestyles now in fact is there's been a 30-year running debate you may have heard of it between John MacArthur his version of what is called lordship salvation versus Zay haj's teaching labeled and they label it easy believism it actually comes out of they've kind of fixed it because there was such an out cry over the last three decades but it was the main teaching of Dallas Theological Seminary it was just easy believism that's why your mega church across the town here has no standards and they they have no problem telling you that they they don't believe we we had a we had a man come to this church and he and he liked coming here and he's still a Believer to this day moved on somewhere else but while he was here he had a girlfriend that came with him from that church and she sat here a few services and she wanted to see me in the back so he brought her and we sat down he wanted me to try to explain some things to her and I took some time to explain it and she says well I just want to go back to my other church and I and I said well why is that she said well because over there we can just pretty much do whatever we want said to me and I knew that to be true because I knew other people who go over there and that come out of DTS that come out of Dallas Theological Seminary that they are the main uh they are the main source of easy believism where it's just where it's just you know where it's just Grace uh you know and and and and and it's it's just faith alone that justifies it's just faith alone you don't have to make any change you don't actually have to be born again there's no really such thing as the Holy Ghost you just make a decision and you just become a better person see and so so you know I I like this statement the reformers used to make the reformers said many of the reformers coined this phrase that said that while faith alone justifies the faith that justifies is never alone that's a good statement the faith that justifies we certainly are faith alone justifies but the faith that justifies is never alone faith alone justifies but the faith that justifies is never alone it brings a real change if you get the real justification see so although lordship salvation which MacArthur preaches heavily that it has to be an impact in your life there has to be a repentance there has to be a change there has to be the lordship of the Savior over your life I admire him for that he's completely misunderstanding the godhead and he's a died in the wool trinitarian but hey you know I'm not his judge I'm not to judge another man's servant to his own Master he rises or Falls all right so so we find then my device better to cooperate that that that while his teaching is certainly closer to the truth that that that but that what they been debating since the 1980s and I and I would sit down and say you're both wrong you're both wrong yeah lordship salvation is closer but uh Oneness is closer than but they're both wrong you understand the problem that that here's what I would say listen you you've been debating this for 30 years since the since even longer than 30 years it started coming out in the 80s I'm here to tell you that William Brandon was setting the record straight in the 1960s under an Elijah anointing he was setting the record straight preaching the token the problem really when you break it down is a miss understanding of the godhead because the godhead is not a teachable Doctrine in a Creed he's the person of the almighty God see so in these quotes if we get to any of them today in these quotes uh brother Brandon will describe how individual believers who are according to the scripture the house of the Lord they must be covered by this token so it's you got to have the token applied to your home but you're also a house so it's got to be applied to you and applied to your home and applied to your children see so it's got to be on display so the the the the text emphasizes you know the the that what the way brother Brandon begins to break this down is that it's going to emphasize that the followers of Christ are to be in Union with Christ that's what the token is about and and as such they they will have have his very distinctive nature very different from the world very different as night is from day and it's it's miles and millenniums Beyond even what modern Christianity says his nature is when I look at their services and what they what goes on on their platforms I'm here to tell you with love and consideration for their ignorance that is not the nature of Jes Jesus Christ that I'm seeing see so so we find that he's also going to disclose in these quotes the necessity of displaying the token through Faith and Action because the token is part of your identification amen the token on display is part of your identification with Christ it shows ownership and that is really really good news because it means that then you can bring your token when sickness comes into your house and you can come to the devil and and brother Brandon says show him your token people say what does that mean uh it means the same thing as apply the token it means you can walk up there and the Bible says if our heart condemns us not we can have faith toward God is that right so the way you do is you come to the devil and you say let me tell you something I am a Christian and you know I'm a Christian and I nothing to do with you and my heart has no condemnation I'm a believer of the word I'm the property of Christ and you have no rights in my home that's why he can't hold your children against your will because you have because you're willing to live on display and the devil knows that cuzz he sees it and you can't trick him because he sees you in secret but when you know that you have the token on display then the devil knows that so so we find it's part of your identification the port the portrayal of the token literally extends in this way to practi iCal aspects such as healing uh responding to challenges and brother brandham is going to use it as a term and he's going to say it's a badge of recognition to the world so the token is many things the token on display it is a badge of recognition you carry a badge of identification and Authority Devils see it your neighbors see it your church family sees it amen it is your life from a willing heart not works not about gritted teeth not because I don't want to go to hell not because I don't want to miss the Rapture it's your whole desire has changed the worshipper once purged has no more conscience of sin the desires of the world are gone from him and his desires are for Christ all right out of 58 slides I probably got enough time to get to maybe two all right that's okay I'm perfectly satisfied with where I'm at today all right so let's take about the last 10 15 minutes and we will look at a maybe two or three at the most but I'm going to watch the clock and I got about 19 minutes before the top of the hour you good yeah come on you americ everybody good got a cushion seed air conditioned building people next to you smell good it's all good you're fine all right we'll get the girls up here to sing for you if you get too bored all right so brother brandham comes here and this is his first iteration of it in uh in September in his Tabernacle I actually have the token but that's actually titled just token so he says here Christianity has to display its token publicly amen catch it again it has to display its token publicly in public life at the office on the street when trouble is around in church and everywhere else you shouldn't look at work different than you look at church you shouldn't look at in the shopping places you shouldn't go on vacation and have a different display than you have here amen a amen have brother Kenny CL sing it amen should have probably started you all so you got a good exercise so he says and everywhere else here he is now you see that red there the reason that's in there is for clarity you ever read the Amplified Bible and it'll take the King James and it'll add words in for clarity just to amplify the meaning so you don't miss it sometimes King James can get a little because it's archaic and you especially in Paul's abstract way of writing you miss what he's saying sometimes so I've added that for clarity so everywhere you see red that's me just adding he say you're adding to the quote calm down I know what I'm doing I do this for a living it's all good you I won't kill you I promise I've been studying this message since a boy so give me some some some card blanch here the blood of Jesus is the token and the token must be applied or as brother brandom says in the very top in case you think I'm on a li on a limb at the bottom he says displayed so when he says applied just think displayed this is why it's applied in your home it's displayed it's why it's applied to the devil it's why it's a badge it's displayed it's why it gives you Authority cuz it's displayed see all right so so we find then watch so the blood is the token and the token must be applied all right um uh must be applied if it's not even the Covenant of faith in Christ cuz that's what he's talking about and if you go listen to the sermon you'll understand why I've got it that way that's what he's talking about go listen to all four takes I have all right so even the Covenant of faith in Christ like John 3:16 like John 5:24 amen you know like like acts 238 the promises unto you you'll receive the Holy Ghost no you won't if you're not willing to surrender your heart if you're not willing to completely repent and walk away from the world repent means to turn around and go the other way if you just want some some battle relief and you want to turn over a new Leaf you're never going to get the Seal of the Holy Ghost so so so you realize then that that even the Covenant is not in effect that's what brother R was saying if it's not even the Covenant is not in effect to that in individual now brother Braham is not saying the Covenant is not in effect he's saying to the individual it's not see just like a pardon is only a pardon if you receive it as a pardon you Jesus said you by your Traditions have made the word of God of no effect see so it's not that the word isn't effective it's that you've made it ineffective to yourself and to other people yeah all right so you have to realize then that his blood let me let me let me just try to break down and then I'm going to show you with the quotes I it's dangerous because I don't have time to get to all the quotes and I don't know if I'm going to able to prove it with the two or three that I have um this is risky um let me try so I want to try to help you understand when brother Brenham talks about the blood and he talks about the life in the blood and this will help you you with your understanding of the godhead it'll help you understand who Jesus was and his human relationship to a supernatural God understand and how that paradoxically he wasn't a second person he was the person and brother brandham shows that in the scripture is so clear in that so remember that his blood that flowed on Calvary it was notice how I say this going to be very clear his blood that was shed on Calvary was innocent blood and it was shed for you and me and without the shedding of blood the blood of God was it the blood of God the Bible says it was brother Ram says it was he didn't have he wasn't the blood of a Jew he wasn't the blood of a gentile he was the blood of God Amen so his innocent blood that was shed for you and me and we know that without the shedding of the blood of God there is no remission for our sins is that right and say Amen we know that we are Washed by the blood of the Lamb are you washed in the blood in the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb we sing that that's a Bible uh backing song so we are Washed by the blood of the lamb in fact is the foolish virgin the B The Book of Revelation shows us they actually wash their robes in the blood of the lamb for cleansing because they don't have his righteousness otherwise if they had had his righteousness they'd have been born again and they'd went in the Rapture so after they give their life and suffer the Judgment of Jacob's trouble they actually wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb the bride does not do this people think that's the bride it's not the bride the bride has no need to wash her robes and the blood of the Lamb because a prophet said you you are the blood of God by the spirit I don't need to wash my garments I've already dressed in the garments of the bleeding word and I already am the blood of God by the spirit because I've been baptized by the Holy Ghost we are kept by the blood amen that's right you're saved through faith you're kept by the blood so but there but but there has to be a way to get a transfer of that in ENT sacrifice onto US who are born in sin that's the rub that's the problem that's the disconnect was not a problem with the blood of Jesus it was the blood of God it was innocent it was holy all right but but but none of us here here it is none of us and if you do please stand up none of us have his physical chemical blood who's got it does the Vatican have it no is it in Jerusalem somewhere no is it at the brandham Tabernacle no no one has his physical blood so how are you going to get his physical blood see there has to be a way to get that innocent life that's not needed since the life in the blood comes back on the cner and makes him a new creation and Paul says through the blood of Christ you have been enjoined back to God hallelujah though you never contacted the chemical amen so none of us have the chemical it's not needed the life that was in the blood comes back on The Sinner and that redeems him which is God in the form of the holy ghost that comes and lives in us and Works through us can we all say Amen to that so with the baptism of the Holy Ghost down in your soul on I want you to Rejoice over this with the baptism of the Holy Ghost down in your soul you are in a better position than if you had the physical blood in a jar and were still in sin if if I had a physical jarv his blood but I was still in sin what good does it do me brother brandom said in Rising Sun he said he rose from the dead but what's that do for me unless I can be identified in his death burial and Resurrection unless the life inside the blood can come back on me The Sinner and change me magically supernaturally change me into a new creation in Christ otherwise you're still lost I don't care what what good deed you do so from here here brother Brandon will begin to you know he'll be he'll start to put this under a magnifying glass uh of the word and he'll start to look deeper into the statement the blood is the token he starts out by saying that but we find out that he's going to put a magnifying glass and go deeper so that you get layers that give you clear understanding he's going to show how that it's not the chemistry of the blood in Jesus as it would appear on a periodic table those chemicals would your blood chemicals that make up your blood appear on the periodic table so brother brandom is going to show us that the chemistry of the blood of Jesus he had human blood and yet it was the blood of God that's the Paradox see and yet and so we find that you say well what what how how is that possible then he was half and half no he was ho and whole 100 and 100 say well that doesn't make sense correct it's not it's a paradox it's something that can't be but it is though it can't be here he goes but it is so but but it's not chemicals uh that's not the the chemistry of the blood of Jesus wouldn't do you any good brother Brandon did have value because it ran down the cross and went on the earth and just like Noah's flood baptized the Earth in the mind of God Jesus blood purchased it so it did have a value you understand but brother Ram says it's long ago dried up all right so rather than the actual chemicals that would appear on the periodic table that's not the token that's not the token rather it's the life of God that was in the blood of Jesus making him a unique human being never before seen or then or since wouldn't be necessary for someone to come like he did because now he's already paid the price and and that he died he dieth no more and he doesn't need you to to go do it see so that that life in his blood is the token that comes back on the believer for Redemption therefore in the days of Luther it was thought to believe in the days of Wesley the chemistry of the blood but this is the last day where the token is required that makes together the whole unit for the Rapture it's been the lamb all the way through brother bram's not denying that it's been the lamb all the way through it was the lamb in Luther's time it was the lamb in Wesley's time but now is the token time that each house must be covered by the token and what is the token on display the life in the blood on display that's the token on display the token is the Holy Ghost and displaying the token is displaying the Holy Ghost see so it's been the lamb all the way each house must be covered so and I I I won't get into that I see a sidebar here but we're going to we're going to stop in six minutes each house of God must be covered by the token all that's inside of it must be covered by the token and the house of God is the body of Jesus Christ and by one Spirit we're all baptized into this token and become part of it that God said when I see the token help me dis when I see the token displayed I'll pass over you brother Brandon finishes that statement and he says on the tape what an hour that we're now in oh I agree with that friends what an hour that we are now in the consummation of all the ages the thing we've waited on the thing that Paul waited on and wrote about and John wrote about and John saw it you're here you're it this is the hour and the world is gone into madness and chaos and it's it's Satan's Eden he's been voted and elected as the god of the age but there is a people who are believers of the word who have the token proudly on display as a badge of their dedication to the Lord and we're not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power of God under salvation and my only Quest is to display it more and more and more and more what is your quest today what the purpose of your life to display it more and more so it's obvious I'm watching the clock it's obvious that we've come we have arrived at a critical Tipping Point for Humanity there's been a a sea change in Christianity I want you to understand it at that level the holy spirit is impressing his prophet and drawing him to call out this end time danger and to identify it to his family I ask you today do you hear the father's voice today in the voice of a prophet I've been preaching on the voice of the East Wind and I said how is it that Pharaoh didn't hear the voice in the East Wind how is it that the world doesn't hear the judgments coming listen friends the night is far spent you understand the night is far is far spent what what once once Moses pronounced that eighth plague by morning's light Listen by morning's light it was too late for Pharaoh because the morning brought the Locust on the wind and he had heard the wind blowing all night by morning it was too late for Egypt it's blowing harder and harder we're at the dawning of a new day and I don't want it to be too late for me I don't want it to be too late for you do you hear the spirit calling to you today do you hear the voice of the East Wind do you hear the father's voice in the message of the hour saying you you must have the token on display it can't just be the what they had in the ages and a even if you have a faith in Christ that is that is aned if you refuse to have the token on display amen amen amen and amen let's stand I dare not dare not go one more word because we're going to break into some real breakdown stuff there amen praise the Lord praise the Lord Hey Brother Kenny you can sing some more of that um that you were singing when I stepped up yeah refiner fire love that wow friends the word of God is real amen it's true it it can it can do for you in your life everything that you need from God I'm here to tell you bow your heads with me over the building Lord as is my way I'm always got my spiritual ear and my spiritual senses tuned to when you tell me enough's been said you can stop and I just felt that leave of the Holy Spirit to stop just right there there is so much more to be said and we want to say it but enough has also been said today to judge the World by Lord I hope that every person in this building physically across the Internet by way of archive will understand the great thing that you have done in this hour Lord don't let the God of this evil age as brother bradam said spray his poisonous spray on their minds and their hearts I pray that you anoint these young people with faith to believe the word of God anoint the moms and dads to believe to desire the presence of God in their home they say I I want that badge brother Jason I want that Badge of authority I want the devil know I want the devil to know that when I pray I'm coming with my token I'm not ashamed of the gospel and I do make mistakes but they're all under the blood and I can stand and face down any demon spirit and say I am a believer and I sure you could Point all day long to my mistakes but God don't see one of them because they're all under his blood and I adure you get out of my house and get out of my children and get out of my family that's the authority Lord that you've placed in the bride it can overstep any barrier it can undo years of misdirection it can undo pain and hurts it can Lord even when we've been complicit in our own pain it can just step right over that and build a whole brand new Garden to us today Lord I Thank you for your your anointing that I felt today the Casual almost relaxed atmosphere Lord here this morning and in my own mind and in my own heart I just felt so at

daily basis hey we're all in this together and I've said so many times Lord just take that from me and I find myself 6 months later still praying and crying over the same thing and finally the Lord I
