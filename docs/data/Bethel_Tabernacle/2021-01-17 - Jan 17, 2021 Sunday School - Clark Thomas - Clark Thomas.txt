========================================

so [Music] so so do [Music] so so [Music] do [Music] so god bless you amen let's stand and bow our heads in the word of prayer dear lord i thank you for this opportunity to express what's on my heart and we just pray that this will help us to be more sincere border in our testimonies have a greater faith in you a greater faith in your word a greater faith in your promises and by doing so have a greater faith in one another because we do know that this is a relationship it's a relationship between the god of heaven and his elect and lord we just want to grow in that and so lord we just commit this service this uh sunday school lesson to you in jesus christ's name amen the scripture i would like to speak on this morning is first john chapter four and just the first four verses i think we're going to just start with the first verse first john 4 verse 1 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world and you may be seated i want to stop here in just a moment the question is not whether you follow a prophet because everybody in a sense follows a prophet most everybody has somebody that they turn to when they want to make sure that they're on track spiritually all right so the real question is who is your prophet now in a general sense it could be your pastor or your mentor or your pastor's mentor or some general overseer whoever it might be in other words it may be somebody who doesn't even actually have the office of a prophet nor claims to yeah and we know throughout history where there have been people who were not prophets martin luther william tyndale george whitfield john wesley charles finney are examples of that they were not prophets but they had the right vision to direct others then there have been those who've had the wrong visions a modern day example of that is ed sullivan who presented elvis presley in the beatles as wholesome entertainment and not to mention our hollywood culture that caused good evil and evil good and even good people with bad visions are not people you want to be following amen and sometimes it's those people who will deceive you the worst because you expect better things of them but remember a counterfeit can only hurt you if you are counting on there being a genuine oh yeah wow i can't be deceived by russian rubles because i'm not going to accept them anyway right bring me some american currency and we'll talk but now you come along with a counterfeit 20 bill you can hurt me because i think i have something of value and i really don't then i'll have something i need to verify so there we go to verse 2. hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is coming the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world many people read right past this scripture satisfied that they have the spirit of christ simply because they believe jesus came in the flesh and that he was the son of god that's their testimony straightforward reading right if you profess to be a christian you go to heaven and if you die without becoming a christian you're eternally lost but everybody knows it's not that simple james 2 19 states thou believest that there is one god they'll do us well the devils also believe and tremble now after jesus gave the devil a whipping there in the wilderness no demon ever said if thou be the son of god no spiritual demon anyway rather they said jesus thou son of god they'll come to hither to torment us before our time so it can't be that right and so in our carnal thinking we try to change it into doctrinal statements an intellectual belief in the historical accuracy of the bible for example or at least that jesus actually existed as he's portrayed in the bible and that he was actually the son of god that he was actually god himself the son of god but then we turn it into a certain model of the godhead and it doesn't really matter what that consensus is whether it's a oneness model a trinitarian model a unitarian model it's only a model all right you know in science a chemist has the intellectual honesty to know that he's never seen an atom he only has a model for it and so science has enough humility to realize that model could be wrong but it works and so we have models that work for us and what we always need to be growing in our understanding of god you can't place your faith in a model because it's only a model it's not a final understanding of who god is if you're married you know you never get figure your own spouse out how are you going to figure god out but you can believe every scripture without trying to force some carnal understanding yes here's the challenge how can the father-son relationship be greater than the bridegroom relationship when the scripture says that a man must leave his father and mother so that he can cleave his wife and become one flesh you got a real problem if you've got godhead wrong on that one so there's a real problem with these doctrinal issues and the problem is that it takes absolutely no revelation to agree with somebody else on doctrine all we have all we ever have to do is find that one person we believe to be more spiritual than anybody else and say you're right goodness end of story we can go home do whatever we want to do and wait for the lord to take us home either by the grave or by the rapture that's not too far from people's theology that attitude god doesn't care what we do he only cares what we think if we're not careful we fall into this doctrinal legalism in which we gravitate to those who think the way we do regardless of how they act when we need to be considering that member of the body of christ who may be just as sincere as we are but sees things a little differently for an analogy just to give myself an extra challenge by doing a visual here i think this will work okay i have a i brought a jigsaw puzzle with me and on the box here's this nice i don't know if the camera can see it well i don't know if you can there might be a reflection or something right here but there's this dolphin on the picture like flipper not the waihewahi but it's got this nice trim around it it's a very neat picture very pleasant picture so open this box and this is what i find wait what are you gonna do with that the picture is nice and rectangular but the pieces have all these rough edges now we don't like rough edges let me find a couple pieces here where i can make my point i think that's it or maybe that's it we don't like our rough edges so what do we do we try to hide our rough edges we go around acting like we have it all together so the people like us people respect us people follow us but that's exactly the opposite of what the bible tells us to do okay james 5 16 confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that you may be healed if we want healing that's the way to do it in other words let's admit that we all have rough edges and without the other pieces of the puzzle other members of the body we're not going to be complete here's my confession i need a revival without even having to be specific i'll just tell you i have things i have to overcome in a way that i haven't overcome them the way that i want to and i need people with the same burden that i have you know so that we can minister to one another and if i can light your fire then maybe you can light mine maybe we can help light each other's fire i need more faith i need to be more sincere i need to be delivered from this body of flesh and i thrive on encouragement from others who have that same vision and if it's true of me then maybe it's true of you but so often we don't confess we act as though we alone have it all together or our own little our own little group has it all together we'll get a few pieces and we'll just trim it off to where there's this one box nothing else connects to we hide our rough edges and by hiding our rough edges by by not acknowledging our rough edges we fail to connect with the rest of the body of christ my goodness the bible speaks of the lamb jesus christ having a bride can anybody show me where it says he has a harem just as every piece of this puzzle in this box here is part of the same puzzle yeah wow so is every member of the bride of christ part of a single functioning body beautiful there is no competition wow it's good because i'd probably lose anyway so as we can't take one another's place you can't you can't swap pieces here as long as there's one member of the body who is not in his or her rightful position there will be rough edges and that's okay that is why ministries that are not all smooth and polished don't bother me it is the rough edges that connect us to one another being all proper and polished does not bring jesus christ on the scene on the other hand if you have the holy ghost then by definition god dwells in you and that's the jesus christ that's come in the flesh that john the apostle spoke of now it's easy to say that about the apostles and the prophets but it's even true of that member of the body of christ whom we esteem the least whoever that might be that is exactly where we need to be the most careful all right we must never make one person outside of jesus christ himself the entirety of the body it is not that person that you esteem the most but jesus said as you have done it unto one of the least of these that's what judges us not the greatest the least once the puzzle is complete talking about the body of christ there will be no rough edges if there are any pieces left over they weren't part of the puzzle to begin with it's not because we threw them out wow it's because they didn't line up they just refused to join themselves to christ and then by their own choice they're left outside so it is essential that we discern the lord's body amen it's all about growth we ourselves must grow and we must allow others to grow and that's why both repentance and forgiveness are so important there's certainly a shortage of that in the country in our country right now amen my favorite most most recently really becoming my favorite book of the bible is the book of job job was a righteous man who looked out for everybody and he just could not understand why god did not seem to be looking out for him and to make matters worse god wasn't answering any of his questions and job actually had a case yet we get all pouty because god doesn't answer all of our questions as though it's is over entitled to that more than job was it was those very unanswered questions that gave job most of his growth meanwhile it was those around him that were coming up with answers but they were the wrong answers so don't fear the hard questions fear the answers that come too easily the one strike job had against him was thinking he was more righteous than god was because based on his limited understanding here he was he would do things for other people and god was just letting him suffer and perhaps the main purpose of this test was to bring job to a place of understanding that god had all things under control even when he seemed not to and that his ways are perfect even when it seems they aren't and it finally shook job to the place where he realized he couldn't be holding a grudge against god of all people so job had to repent by forgiving god let that sink in and then everything was restored to him even more so so if job outside of christ perhaps the most righteous man ever could not experience victory without reconciling himself to god who has never been guilty of anything how much more do we need to reconcile ourselves to one another through repentance and forgiveness one of the greatest hindrance hindrances to unity in the body of christ is our failure to forgive and often it's not that person who's completely betrayed you it's that person who merely irritated you you know you know what i'm talking about that person whose heart you're always blessing because you can't bring yourself to actually respect him well bless his heart bless her heart and then you're going to describe how that person was 15 years ago we've got to let people grow come on we've got to have grace for one another so maybe it's that person who's just a little more legalistic than you are maybe not legalistic enough or has some doctrinal difference with you over some relatively minor point if you want to take that approach of agreeing to disagree and break fellowship that's totally up to you but let's be very clear in doing that you are making a declaration that you and that other person are not part of the same body wow and we we need to be very careful about being on the wrong side of that division particularly right now the problem with the pharisees of jesus day is not that they called sin sin sin is sin the problem was they labeled the sinner a sinner without any opportunity to reconcile there's nothing wrong today with preaching against sin and we have standards of holiness sure so let's discuss where those standards of holiness came from now everything we believe is based on the bible that's true and yet the bible leaves a lot of room for interpretation okay the bible says that a woman should have long hair how long it says a man should have short hair how short it says men and women should should dress certain ways but what constitutes a man's dress or a woman's dress women are to be modest but how do you measure that all right which activities are associated with sin and worldliness and which ones aren't so if the bible does not specifically say then the correct answers can only come by the holy ghost yet if i read the bible and you read the bible we get two different interpretations think about it even if we have the same profit we end up with two different interpretations i may put the more strict interpretation on things you may put the less strict interpretation on things or the other way around so how does the holy ghost resolve this the answer is through our influence on one another throughout the reformation beginning of the reformation the bible was the only book in the home and mothers would read it to their children and these questions would come up what do i make of this how do i how do i apply this and these mothers would be wanting to do what was best for the home and so by their example they would live it and they would inspire somebody else who would see their life and it would have an effect on them and they would they would watch each other's testimony and and take notes of what what was leading to holiness and what wasn't and the more spiritual people were the clearer it became to them what was right what was wrong that's why it took so long for slavery to become an issue was because people had to be had to have their awareness brought to the see things as they were if the man is the head the woman is the backbone women played an essential role in helping and helping both their husbands and their sons to become men and boy we could use a lot more of that today now everybody needs to know this the reason women wanted to vote in the first place was to abolish slavery to outlaw liquor to make the home better talk about buyer's remorse that is not what they're doing today amen things were not perfect during the victorian age and i'm not saying that they were there were a lot of inconsistencies that needed to be worked out but at least they were thinking about how to make the next generation better [Music] and that is all gone by the wayside so as a nation we started abandoning all moral progress that the victorian age represented and instead we became self-absorbed as though god would bless us simply because we were american as a warning all these things we just discussed were confirmed to us once again through a holy ghost ministry the same holy ghost is still alive today and with us and without in any way diminishing the offer the office that restored the fivefold ministry of ephesians 4 11-13 which talks about apostles prophets evangelists pastors teachers until we all come in the unity of the faith not just the ministry every single one of us i'm going to say this from personal experience i'm holding two pieces of of the puzzle that that fit together perfectly these two pieces fit together perfectly now there are 15 ways that they don't my wife and i came from very different backgrounds and there were a lot of things that we had to work out for our relationship to proceed we couldn't even we couldn't even think about getting married we had we had to get these things worked out it took years of and it took years it took a lot of work but we finally broke through with heavy tears we came to understand one another's viewpoint and once that happened something supernatural took place circumstances began working themselves out before i could even do anything about them wow i mean it was just it was a domino effect and i was a spectator and to me that's a taste of what could happen if we as a body of believers could humble ourselves and reason together if something bothers one of us that doesn't bother the other then maybe one of us is overly sensitive or the other or the other one is too undersensitive or both but if we are in christ we should be able to get on the same page we should have enough respect not just to blow the other person off if that person is a sincere believer and what is probably more important is not that we would agree on everything but that we would be willing that the holy ghost could speak to us through one another which brings us to verse four year of year of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world let us stand then as we bow our heads one more time our heavenly father there is a body of christ and i am thankful to be counted part of a group of believers that are desiring to be completely surrendered to you and lord even as i speak this i know there's a invisible audience that is uh probably larger than the audience that i see here made of people with maybe entirely different viewpoints and i pray that even those will be struck by some of the things that were said here that that everything here is scriptural everything here is is a is a challenge to everyone who would call himself a christian because we this is not some sort of mental idea it's not a it's not a list of rules it's not a set of doctrines it is a relationship between you and your people and lord we just are amazed how identified you are with your elect yes if you were if you were our father and that was all that it was that would be that would be wonderful enough to be you to be our father and we to be your children and yet you also came to be our brother and so we are your brothers and sisters we are your friends those are those are those are great relationships there but even more so we have a bright bridegroom relationship with you and beyond that you have made new jerusalem you have you you declared as jesus christ as as the man you said who are my who are my mother and my brethren and you identified your elect with both of those making new jerusalem the mother of us all also the mother of that word that's being restored so four of the greatest i mean the four greatest relationships we could ever have with another human being are represented in our you're our father you're our brother you're our husband you are our son and if that weren't enough you have made us your body so lord help us to recognize one another to respect you to respect one another and to see the holy ghost have liberty to move like we've never seen it granted we ask amen in jesus christ's name amen
