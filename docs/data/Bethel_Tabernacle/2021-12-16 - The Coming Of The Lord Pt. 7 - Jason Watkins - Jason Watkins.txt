[Music] [Applause] amen praise the name of the lord god bless you this evening greet you in the name of the lord we're going to make a few announcements before we um just release the musicians and and have you stand just a couple quick announcements i want to make concerning um the um new year's eve service we're planning so uh we're what we're going what i want to do is have a new year's eve service which will be december the 31st at our normal time starting up of 7 pm what we're going to do is we're going to move the service on december 29 to december 31 so that's moving wednesday to friday you got that the last wednesday moved to the last friday december 29 moved to december 31st uh it's not a watch night uh in the sense of going to the midnight hour but what we do want to we do like to do on that last service of the year is have communion and foot washing we didn't get to have foot washing last time because of the pandemic and what more but i feel good enough in my spirit we'll go ahead with commune and foot washing on that 31st friday now um what i'm going to actually do um is we'll have commune and foot washing and then i've asked our entire ministry team there's six of us now i've asked the entire ministry team to take 10 or 15 minutes of exhortation including myself i might take a few more than that but amen praise the lord but uh not not too many more than that amen i i want to have good participation and so uh what we'll do is that's going to be a little different this this year um i'm just kind of getting those weird ways where i sometimes flip things around but uh we're going to have the communion and the foot washing first rather than at the end and we just miss and go home i'd like to come in and have a few songs maybe a couple congregationals and maybe a special and then i want to go immediately into the lord's supper and foot washing and then when we come back in uh then we will go from there sing another song or two and then i'd like to have our team come up and just kind of uh give you something off of their heart um you know for me i just want to reflect a little bit on the year past and a little bit how the lord is dealing with my heart in the new year coming i hope that we don't end up spending one day in the new year see if we do i want to have a plan but i hope we don't i hope it's a plan i never have to put into play amen i would rather i would rather see uh this december i'd rather see tonight be the last service and in the morning we meet in glory hallelujah that would be grand wouldn't it and so um we're going to do that and uh it should follow for parents with children don't worry because it should follow pretty close to the normal dismissal time amen i don't i don't like having saints out on the road with their families late on new year's eve that's almost exactly why i don't do it um my involvement with law enforcement has shown me that south carolina has exceptionally lacks drunk driving laws and lawyers here make a killing amen they they flourish here because they can almost get you out of anything in the state of south carolina so we'll be letting out probably i'm going to aim at around 9 30 and we should have everybody out pretty close to that amen praise the lord just want to make that announcement our last wednesday which will be the 29th is moved to friday the 31st and it's a new year's eve service and we're going to do a few special things there amen you got that praise the lord let's stand to our feet and we want to invite you to revelation chapter 10. i sure appreciate that singing and uh that special song i asked sister sarah to sing that for me i actually have a recording of her singing it i listen to it a lot and i love the words and i it just was going to go so perfect with my sermon this evening we're hoping by the will of the lord to conclude i don't make any promises but well even if i do it's just a human promise and it can get broken but i'm going to try by the will of the lord i believe i will be able to to finish the series here on the coming of the lord and we want to come this evening with us a particular subtitle that you're familiar with i actually sent it out to the whole church because we want to come back to innocence friends that is truly what the word of god has been sent in this day to accomplish and so i will take my subtitle return to innocence one verse in revelation 10 and then brother caleb i sent you another verse you should have it revelation 10 and just one or let me get there myself not 1 10 10 1. revelation chapter 10 verse 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and um we also would like to have you go now to first peter chapter 2. i want to get this one quick verse there um you know and this was actually in a late edition uh that i just felt on my heart as i was in the back room and just added this quickly to my notes first peter chapter 2 and verse 9. but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood isn't that wonderful you're a chosen generation a one a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people did you know you were all of those say well i'm just i'm just me i'm just a person no but you're you're a chosen generation you're actually a royal priesthood you're a holy nation see a peculiar people that ye here's why that ye or i could read it this way so that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light father we thank you for your word and i just surrender myself now to lord just to be your assistant to bring this thought lord i it's it's so close to my heart so i'm depending on you to help me get through it but lord it means a great deal to me and i'm i i trust that i'll be able to bring it to the people lord with that kind of a feeling that i can also engage their heart on this lord here in the visible audience and those on the streaming network lord we commit it to you now in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated we've been dealing exhaustively on this subject of the coming of the lord i think that we have certainly broadened your thinking to more than just on some day on a calendar the dead saints will be here and we'll change into new bodies i hope at this point we've been able thank you for the mat i hope that that we broadened your mind enough that you realize that there's a lot to do with the coming of the lord that isn't at all waiting for that glorious morning it's actually happening right now at least that's god's plan and so we've been trying to demonstrate to you and show you from the scripture that this this is a process this is a this is a whole collection of things that are taking place in real time as we live out real lives the coming of the lord uh it will be a surprise to the world but it shouldn't be a surprise to us since we're already in it i mean it wouldn't surprise you if i told you you're here would you would it why because you're already here if i said hey guess what you're in church you'd say yeah okay so it well it shouldn't take you by surprise if i say you know the rapture is coming because it's already happening and you're actually already involved in it and i'm here to tell you friends you're being caught up in it more than you realize god is doing more and i'm glad it's that way he's doing more than we realize and i want to say it like this and want to add this to it he's doing more than you're capable of and that's the best news that's the best news for me he's doing everything i can't do he's accomplishing everything that i fall short oh my we are coming to that perfect very image of god now one of the things that we've been showing you especially these last couple of parts and tonight and sunday are probably i would say the closest thing to my heart in all of this i've i showed you sunday how that you know that that this word that this rapture is able to live in our lives and manifest through our lives and that we are you know we we are we are uh dedicated to being a display for this descending of christ to the world you're the you're the last good that'll be here you're the last full image of truth that will be here this is the only opportunity right now is is the worst of times but it's the best of times it's the worst of times for the world and mankind but it's the best of times because there's never been a bride on the earth more visibly united and obvious that she has come into the image of god's word i mean even just the contrast just in contrast of what you of what uh contrast to the world just what you aren't is glorious i want to say sometimes you feel like you're behind the eight ball you you can't catch up you're not you're not doing very good i'm here to tell you what you are not is glorious in the eyes of god so just understand that that the lord is in this he's with you he's he's helping you he's moving through us he's bringing us to that don't let the devil discourage you with you [Music] because you're your biggest discourager you knock yourself out more than i more than anybody else can see because you you know who that man in the mirror is you know him better than anybody and you dread him more than anybody and but i'm here to tell you that he knows that man in the mirror better than you and he says you're a royal priesthood you're a chosen people you're a holy nation you're peculiar and i've i've called you and i've elected you now we've been showing you how that right off the very back in the first verse of chapter 10 that christ is displaying himself in the imagery of of of himself in the bride it's just like in chapter one when he comes gird about the pabst with the golden girdle brother random says notice it's a woman but yet it's christ in the seven lamp stands but what the imagery of revelation is showing is that it's christ moving in his body that was always his goal to have a kingdom see to have a chosen generation a royal priesthood now look at what look at what being a in in the in the position of of of a priest look at what it enables you to do it enables you to bring forth praises of him who hath called you out of darkness to his marvelous light now the and this is why when he comes and he has a rainbow we've talked about all of the imagery here the fetus pillars of fire that's not pillar of fire because it's pillars of fire because it's according to the book of acts when he came in the upper room he divided himself into the church licks of fire fell on them all and so we've looked at the imagery i don't want to go over it all again tonight but one of the things that is look that we are looking at is this rainbow because this is this is all seven colors and that's significant that's highly significant that it comes in this age because it's the full seven colored rainbow display of his person see and it's now and because that it's the image of christ in his bride it's the full seven colored rainbow display of his person now completed through a bride who is in his very image by receiving his very word which is very him amen you understand and so this is this is so monumental this is what the ages have waited on when there would be a people in the earth who would who who a prophet could say she is him the prophet could say you are the blood of god by the spirit see and so this has this has restored true worship see this has restored this the fact that he's come in this end time the descending of the mighty angel in his full seven color rainbow on display means that that he now has a people who have been restored who can now give restored worship who have come into true fellowship who can now display true fellowship with christ true relationship restored like it was in the garden of eden this is the power even to the power of creation restored back to the end time bride the power of the spoken word as a prophet comes to it under the under the imagery of a wave sheath that was only proving that there's more in the field to come like that and as i pointed out to you many times there's many more there's four times more scriptures in revelation 10 that refer to your ministry as it refers to william branham's ministry that's not diminishing a prophet that's not elevating you above him that's not nothing of the kind we wouldn't have a message had that prophet not come but don't fall short and sit back and just think brother branham did it all and maybe he'll come back or maybe it's already done he's not when he comes back they're all coming back when he comes back my grandmother's coming back when he comes back my dad's coming back hallelujah we're not coming back for to carry the message around the world you are the message going around the world right now see and so we have been called to finally at last have this restored relationship have this restored fellowship have this restored true worship because not everyone that saith lord lord shall enter in and many shall worship him but jesus said in vain they do it see because they teach for doctrine the commandments of men but there had to be a people who could come to actual true restored worship so we are invited tonight to be a priesthood a royal priesthood see there's a lot i could i could take off on that just that item of it but i i don't want to get stuck there but but but this part of this priesthood is to take part in the in the full temple experience because if you look back in the old testament let me just touch it this much if you look back in the old testament you have you have outer court inner court and a and a most holy place you have an outer court you have the holy place you have the most holy place and we find that only the high priest could actually he was the only one authorized to to stand at every station now he had other priests standing at various places but he's the only one authorized to stand from the beginning to the end and go all the way into the shekinah and come back out and live to tell about it you understand because this is what is bringing true full temple experience you're not you're you're you're invited as a priest to have the full temple experience in your life we're not just talking about standing in the church queue we're not just talking about being part of a system being having your name on some book no no this is the full experience of the shekinah moving in people's lives again true worship friends you want to remember this true worship is not singing in music and emotional display that that's that's not even what i'm talking about anybody can do that but true worship is wearing the seven-colored rainbow true worship is being clothed in the garment of the son of man feeding on the body word of the son of man true worship because the true worship is wearing the seven colored rainbow because that is that rainbow is the representation of his full life that's why joseph got a coat of seven colors and all the bread not all the brothers got it only one chosen bro only one chosen son got it and it caused his brothers to be offended and that's why jesus would say blessed is he in whom is not offended in me see and so we you realize friends that that part of the the part of the reason of the coming of the lord was to bring this what i'm saying on your life so it's not just to wait on a day on the calendar when the dead and christ rise and we which are alive remain changed and are caught up that that that is coming as a consequence of this happening this happening right now you're sitting here believing the word and you're becoming the word and you're feeding on the word and that's because this is happening that's going to happen see so it's not merely doctrines it's not even correct doctrines our life amen is a worship our life is a worship that's what that's a part of why the coming of the lord happened in this day to restore this fellowship to restore this relationship to restore this worship worship takes place in in sacred places and and and there has to be a a a sacred space that and and what makes it a sacred space is that the presence of god is there yes praise god see and so you know when you when you i and just just looking at bible imagery and i have a look through a lot of not commentary but a lot of textual text manuals concerning dictionary of biblical imagery and various other ones but there's quite a bit said about this sacred space and one of the things that you that you want to get right quick is that the the sense of a sacred space it runs through strong through the whole bible there's constantly places where god comes and meets a man and that becomes a notable place god met abraham god met jacob god met moses god met this one god met that one see god met adam in in the garden of eden god met abel at his altar say did that did that become a sacred space it sure did say well but did it remain a sacred space it sure did because jesus died on the same rock the same rock abel died on the same rock moses stepped on which was christ christ died on that same rock prophet teaches us so we find then that that this sacred space is a place where god is encountered and by by virtue of his presence the very place itself becomes holy it becomes in the estimation of god something set apart from just an ordinary place now god created everything created the whole world you understand but we find that when his presence comes to a certain place and there's a certain action and that action is always the thing that the thing that completes the circuit is not just that god comes down but that he has his family come into a into a uniting and there becomes a connection and that makes it a holy place see when it's a physical location such as a mountain perhaps where abraham met him talked to him where abraham built an alter sacrificed his son and ended up sacrificing the ram a place where moses met him and you know when he when he approached the the burning bush and he said take off your shoes because now the ground that just a few hours before had been normal ground but now it's holy ground why because you've got god and now a prophet god didn't come down in the bush and and say on a big horn for the world to hear this ground is consecrated holy he didn't say it until a prophet approached and now you've got a connection and now it became a holy ground why because moses was playing a part in that connection oh can you see where your life is tonight can you see why god called you you're here to make a connection between heaven and earth and bring holiness to the earth this is the coming of the lord this is part of what it's accomplishing it's a very important part it's just as important as the dead in christ shall rise first and we which you're alive and remain shall be changed this is just as important as that without this that won't come you see so sometimes it can be a physical location sometimes it's just an altar of stones like the one jacob built when he built an altar and it becomes something more you know and and in fact is it becomes known and sometimes people return to it and then they'll return to it a again and again and again and and and and either physically sometimes or sometimes you know it's it's just maybe a memory maybe it's a time when you yourself were in deep prayer and your heart was heavy burdened and you needed god to come and talk to you you got in a situation and and you went to your knees and in desperation you said lord can you come i gotta talk it over and god came and you remember that time and that becomes a marker in your mind oh my oh i will tell you something friends when you have that kind of experience satan nor nobody else can ever take it from you because you know he was there and you know he'd talk to you and you know he answered you and what you prayed for happened see he told you what he would do and then he did it you know it was him in times of trouble you go back there in your mind again and again and again you relive those precious times because they they put strength in you i want to tell you something friends you need to have a a history in your mind of times when you know god met me i met him i talked to him i had a burden and he was faithful and he met my need and i know that was him because there might be times when you get in your life and you can't hear him and you can't feel him and you're praying and you've went back to the same place where you bowed the first time you've said the same words you've been just as sincere and he's quiet and he's silent and the devil's laughing and pushing and pressing i'm going to tell you that's when you've got to be certain of god that's when you've got to know i know that was him the last time and i know if he met me then he can meet me now this is the coming of the lord this is what it secures for the believer it gives you the opportunity to be a priesthood to give praises and worship that are acceptable in the mind of god some sacred places uh in the bible are the site of kind of a one-off encounter with god while others you know they they seem to have a continual visitation of the lord i mean the certainly the holy of holies and the the temple worship the tabernacle of the wilderness these would be places where god would come repeatedly and repeatedly and and and this is what the holy ghost has provided for you a place of continual visitation and presence see because he might he he records how that he came to this place or he came to this place you know he he he came in to gideon and he came you know to sampson's parents and he appeared to hear but there's no record he ever appeared back there again see he met he met jacob at bethel and jacob built an altar and the next thing you know he he makes a pledge to god he has a dream and he says my goodness this is the very gate of heaven he saw a ladder connecting heaven to earth and angels ascending and descending and the son of man standing at the top speaking to him and jacob carried that and it strengthened him and died it didn't make him a perfect person but god was making a pledge and jacob made a pledge if you go with me and if you'll i'll serve you and i'll pay my tithe to you and i will follow your word and you'll be my god and you'll go with me when i go and you'll be with me when i come and god said i'll do it jacob that's my promise to you and god never left him even when he was a shyster and and conniving his own family members i'm here to tell you god you say why would god do that because god knew there was going to come a time god knew he couldn't run in any longer that he would get to a point where he had to have an experience here to tell you something friends you would the way that we were in sin god should have long ago kicked us to the curb but god knows there's a time and there's a place and he's going to find you and he's going to fill you with his life and you're never going to be the same again and it'll be a continual presence a continual presence a continual presence in your life we're witnesses of it aren't we amen it's a connection to the unseen spiritual world and the bible pictures pictures it that that upper world it pictures it as the upper world reaching down into the ordinary routines of life that's that's the bible imagery of this communion that goes on of you becoming a priest to lift up praises to god this this place where you arrive to by the coming of the lord by the return of the token by the return of the abstract by the turn by the return of the full word we have now come back to that spot friends where the garden of eden is just in front of us amen just in front of us see the millennium that's what it's restoring and and and heaven and earth brother branham talks about even at calvary and how that heaven and earth embraced and kissed it was an embrace that that now they're joined back you understand when sin came that put a breach and god no longer had that kind of fellowship he could come down and anoint his people and talk to him and visit him but he couldn't live in him and that was his great desire his great desire was not to have a building with a priest in garments his great desire was to live in you his great desire was to have the fellowship that he had with his family before the fall took place and so the whole bible imagery is is this it's it's it's one of everlasting rest and peace back home back home redeemed after the fall i'm back home i've crossed the chasm i've i'm sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus i know this body is aging and getting sick and someday it'll give up the ghost if the lord don't come soon in my lifetime which i believe he will but i'm already home it ain't going to matter i'm already home moody said one day you're going to hear moody's dead don't you believe it hallelujah brother branham said to brother bosworth said brother brazworth you know you're dying he said i can't die billy i died a long time ago oh hallelujah friends this is the hope of the resurrection that we hold in our hearts oh my any place becomes a candidate to become sacred by virtue of a visitation from god we know that's true my goodness look at the places we took this temple but you know what now it's a holy priesthood you you can go you can you can go and buy an old abandoned building that used to be a brothel and go in there and gut it and clean it and start holding holy ghost services in it you'll drive out every demon that's been there for a hundred years you'll bring the power of god down and god will save sinners and he'll heal the sick in a place where the devil used to live now god's presence has made it a holy place it's made a connection place where heaven and earth connect and power supernatural power flows back and forth i tell you something friends if you could only see if you could only see in your mind's eye if god would open your eyes you'd see angels lining these walls you'd see a stream of light from here to heaven you'd see oh my that's what we have among us now for abraham and isaac mount moriah became a sacred site not because it held any special physical property not at all but because it's where abraham exercised his supreme faith see and and he's and he's rewarded by god you can read that in genesis 22 but you you we we spoke about jacob at bethel bethel was this ordinary ordinary ground there's nothing special about it at all see it was just ordinary landscape until god appeared there to jacob in a dream see and he says that surely the lord is in this place i didn't know it there this is none other than the house of god this is the gate of heaven i made this point in a previous section i'm just recovering a little bit tonight that's genesis 28. so i want to say to you friends our lives are this way our lives we we're just ordinary people it's not even the man that comes predestinated it's the seed of god placed in him we're just ordinary folk we're not we're not we're not super people we're just ordinary people hallelujah but we've been we've been instilled with an extraordinary purpose you've been given an extraordinary sea gene you've been given an extraordinary commission to be a royal priesthood lifting praises to god that are acceptable when the nation of israel set up 12 stones of remembrance remember that following the crossing of the jordan joshua chapter 4. remember they when they cross it and they turn around and put the stones back as a memorial and and the jews you know identify that space and and that accompanying event is sacred in fact as many scholars believe that when when john in matthew 3 is saying you know who warned you to flee from the wrath to come you generation of vipers said don't say within yourselves you know we have this we have that he said fry i say to you god's able these stones and most scholars believe he's pointing to that to the stones joshua laid in the river as a memorial that they still knew where they were so i'm going to tell you god can raise these stones in the jordan children to abraham see you're not going to be able to do this you're not going to be able to accomplish this this is going to have to take god to do this is what makes the coming of the lord in this hour so fantastic he's able to take a bride and lift her off the earth because he's here now changing her from the inside out see you can go down all the way down through the bible there's many places all oh my i'm just going to skip over many of them tonight i think i've maybe even mentioned the few of them before in other other portions but but but you remember that you know a a paradise i mean it was a paradise garden of eden that that was the first sacred spot that was the first sacred place was this paradise of eden that god created for the human race because god it's a place that god actually planted himself the bible says he planted a garden in the east of eden and this was for the his first human couple so it's a place which god was able to walk and have conversations with adam and eve on a daily basis brother branham says in the identified masterpiece of god he says let me have this handful of people here tonight now can you read yourself into this if god could have this handful of people here tonight fully fully considered to christ and their lives dedicated to christ i can do more with this handful or god can do more rather with this handful of people here than you could do with the whole world council of churches towards the kingdom of god one man surrendered into his hands fully amen that's all god needs one man he only needs one what if he could get this whole crowd what if bethel tabernacle has a as a universal group of believers we can all have our only consideration could be the word our only dedication would be to christ what god could do with this little church oh my friends he says i hear testimonies now watch he's going to talk about here's what here's what hinders it here's what hinders it he says i hear testimonies the old-fashioned pentecostals how they had prayer meetings all night long our fathers and mothers 40 50 years ago pray all night long see he said but but you see we're not willing to lay still he's talking about the you remember the the thing where the old the indian how he purified gold was he beat on it and he beat all the draws out now they put it in a crucible and heat it and fire but it said he he would beat on it until he beat all the imperfections out and he could see his own reflection and then he knew he had pure gold and brother branham says he says you see we're not willing to lay still and let him beat this side and that side and knock this out and knock that out and knock this idea out and that and let jesus christ be reflected in us we get so busy and satan is a master at making laodiceans busy busy we're always busy we never can lay still long enough to let god knock this out of your life knock this out of your mind knock this habit knock this this this disgraceful thing knock this thing out of your life knock this out of your home where what do we do we're always just on the run we're on the run we're on the run we're on the run we won't instant this an instant that and come in and song leader get me going and preacher preach me happy and i'm gonna go home and go right back to my treadmill slow down aaron didn't rush into the into the holy of holies and rush out panting heavy okay it's over everybody can go home no this thing was sacred this was lives this was souls hanging in the balance here's what causes it we see too many movies there's a 21st century hit in the head for you amen oh you didn't think the holy ghost had that kind of discernment for 50 years down the road amen too many televisions too many oh listen to this one we got say oh i don't i kick that i don't have that okay we got too many other worldly amusements now avoid that one if you can that's that's a that's that's a scatter gun you're not going to get away from that one that's going to get you running if you want that scatter going to get you too many other worldly amusements until the church has lost its taste oh my what we need today you want to know what we need today what we need today not not not 1964 december 5th 64. but what we need here in 2021 what we need today is some real genuine prayer meetings some cleaning up all the way from the pulpit to the janitor the whole house to be cleaned up i just say start right here lord start right here slow me down knock this out of me knock that out of me slow me down and knock it all out of me knock the world out of me cause me to come into thy presence you realize friends that's what the coming of the lord is about so that you can come into his presence and have fellowship and have relationship and have life a sacred place that has the presence of god it creates a restored innocence amen and that's coming now to the real heart of my sermon tonight because that's what they had in the first sacred place they had innocence you you they they were adam adam was just unmovable untemptable unassailable he he was perfectly unconscious of the power he had he just speak to the wind without regard speak to a tree he didn't occur to him i've got to really have my faith going here this was you talking about somebody who knew who he was and the prophet comes back and says now here when the bride really knows who she really is say well what's going to do that what super fuel's going to give me that we i just read it for you i just read it for you slow down let him knock this out let him knock that out oh god kick some of those things out that are poisoning your lifestyle see those things that are poisoning and saturating your mind and putting you in too too big of a hurry and and and you've got to have time to go into the presence of god and spend some time there because it brings the power of creation that shouldn't surprise you because wherever the presence of god is the power of creation's there here's a being who just simply spoke and everything that is became see out of nothing he made everything he didn't have to have a starter kit he didn't have to build off of something he there was nothing until he spoke it and it became all things were made by him and there was not anything made that was made see when you're in this kind of a priesthood relationship with the lord when you have when you have come to the real purpose of the mighty angel descending his real purpose as i've said so many times wasn't to fill your head full of theology his whole purpose was what paul said to bring you into a fellowship to bring you into a priesthood to make you a royal priesthood a holy nation able to bring praises back to god you've you've reestablished that relational connection to god it brings if if that's the case if it's a restored presence then you can well imagine i shouldn't have to uh compel you to believe tonight that that restores you to innocence this is why brother branham could say we've come back as though we never did it in the first place it's not just forgiven it's as if you never actually did it because innocence is restored by the presence of god oh my hallelujah to be innocent is to be free from guilt to be innocent is to be blameless to be innocent is to be clean to be righteous oh friends the search for innocence this great quest of life that we find ourselves on you know it i know it as a believer i know i'm not unique in this i know you have it as well our whole quest of life is is for the this innocence to be brought back to me to where i can finally defeat me and be him to where i can finally have my mind clean all the time so i can finally have everything in my life pure and holy and righteous people don't want that then don't go to heaven because it's going to be filled with that oh my brother matt was brother matt smith we were in the fellowship hall sunday he was he was talking about his his his finishing portion of his lesson i've been so enjoying it i think scheduled for this sunday i think matt and and we find that it's true right okay i'm telling you now i think i told the rest of the team didn't tell you get used to it that's how we roll ask the brothers ask your dad he will tell you how many times he got a phone call at five o'clock amen but i knew i could always rely on brother dale i could have caught him at seven o'clock it wouldn't have mattered amen he's always got a he's always got a flips a switch and takes off preaching amen but how the that that the thing that is so grievous about hell is the absence of god amen and you have these people who just hate everything about god okay calm down relax god's got a place for you [Laughter] don't worry he won't be there you don't have to worry you don't have to be upset you don't have to dread hell god won't be there okay oh my but it is a quest for innocence isn't it friends because this was the original state of the human race the the whole bible records this quest of the soul of the of the family of god to regain that state of perfect righteousness that is that is with me every day that oh what heaven's gonna be i'm i'm glad for streets of gold walls of jasper i'm glad for all of that but i'm gonna be so glad to reclaim to reclaim that perfect righteousness to reclaim that perfect fellowship with god where i don't have to battle this fallen body and this fallen world and this demon powers that are streaming through the earth i i'm i'm thankful for the coming of the lord amen to be guiltless can you think of it can you imagine it to be guiltless to be blameless to be pure to be holy to be innocent it remains to this day the deepest cry of my soul i'm positive it's the deepest cry of your soul listen don't let wealth and fame fortune in glory don't let that young people don't let that be your your greatest quest have a quest for righteousness get get your soul back to innocence in the presence of god that's the deepest cry brother branham said it in the in the identified masterpiece he carries on it takes the power of christ to change a man and i'm glad he said it this way it takes the power of christ to keep a man see now watch what we need today is the life of christ inside of us that's what purifies see not the outward a turned around collar a degree of psychology or something no no it takes the power of the resurrected christ to make us what we should be god has no other plan then let the holy spirit rule and reign in the church they build all kinds of churches but that's that's not in god's plan because god's plan never includes being run in a church god's plan includes god running the church see the tabernacle in the wilderness and the temple that solomon built what supreme examples in the old testament you couldn't find better example of what god was aiming at to accomplish in the era of the holy ghost because it was the place that god would choose for his name to dwell see and and and which for israel remember that israel's that was their mission was that they were to displace the they they took the land of canaan and it was filled with canaanites and canaanites were everywhere and the whole world was sown over in heathenism and god called one man abraham and said i'm going to make a nation out of you and and you're going to sojourn in a strange land but then i'll bring you up by mighty hand because i got to grow you there you're going to become two and a half million i'm going to bring you out by mighty hand i'm going to take you through a journey and i'm going to i'm going to you're going to go into the heart of this heathen land and you're going to establish yourself drive out all the occupants and set up true worship as an example you're going to displace all of the false narratives you're going to displace all of the false worship and all the misunderstandings that all the heathens had they were going to be the crowning jewel as a people and and and from there god was going to send his light that was the plan to go into all the world see now don't don't fear because i know that you know they were they were to displace all that all that canaanite worship they didn't do a very good job of it but it's going to get done in the millennium it's going to get done see and so so we we see then when we look at revelation 10. and then when you look at at the measurable measurably perfected bride as it's indicated in revelation 11 1 she's she's she's the inner court measured and perfect the outer court's not measured the gentiles the rest of them are going into the tribulation the gospel is going to the jews but revelation 11 1 validates everything from 10 1 all the way through 10 1 to 11. it validates that everything that we've believed is true things that god had declared for thousands of years he vindicated in the day you live in [Music] things that god had declared down through history uh that that there would be there would come a time that there would be no place of true worship anywhere in the world except where his name was see only where his name was and as brother branham would so often say say he would so often say that he put his name in christ and christ is the word so then there's no fellowship outside of the blood because it had to be it had to be connected to his presence you understand that that was the whole point they couldn't just go out somewhere and slay an animal they had to bring their sacrifice to the door because it had to be recognized by the presence of god oh friend you can't you don't get to just decide how to worship god he has one provided way amen there is no fellowship outside of his provided way it cannot be a man-made idea or a man-made ideology or a man-made idol jesus says to the woman at the whale woman the time he says he tells her that the time was approaching when she when when she would worship the father neither in her mountain or even at jerusalem but he said the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship he's always been after that everything he's ever done is to accomplish that you're it it's accomplished in this bride hallelujah scripture isaiah picks up in his second chapter and how there's a vision of of a world when he when he looks at the millennium i know israel failed but don't forget friends we've got a millennium coming we're right on the edge of it now and how that the scriptures in isaiah 2 envision a world of total peace in which people people literally beat all of their farming tools into beat all of their weapons of war into farming tools all of them they're swords they're spears they all get they all do away with it we won't need swords and spears we won't need weapons of war in the millennium because it's going to be a world of total peace he goes on in the 32nd chapter how that there's this there'll be this vast sacred place where the spirit of god will be poured out from on high and justice will dwell in the wilderness and righteous will abide in the fruitful field it's going to be global finally habakkuk says in chapter 2 that the whole earth think of what it is friends just ahead of us think of what the coming of the lord think of what the mighty angel descending has come to accomplish the whole earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the lord as the waters cover the sea in fact zechariah records in zechariah 14 that the coming of this golden age will be so great it'll be so wonderful that even that even the bells of the horses will be inscribed holiness unto the lord and every pot in jerusalem and judea shall be sacred to the lord oh my when i think about what's coming he says here in revelation 21 27 and there shall in no wise enter in into it anything that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the lamb's book of life this this is the power of a sacred place i want you to grasp that for a moment this is the kind of power re put it up again caleb this is what a sacred place accomplishes there shall in no wise enter in anything that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh the lie but they which are written in the lamb's book of life revelation 21 27 records that this sacred place has decisively expelled all evil amen get your mind around that for a minute it that and that's that's what a sacred space in you can accomplish do you realize today that when he calls you to a and calls you a royal priesthood he calls you a holy nation that you're a peculiar people that your chosen people he's he's called you to make you a sacred place you're a sacred space for the presence of god to move in and out of and when when you are surrendered to that then that expels all evil how many want to have all evil expelled out of their life i say oh god all evil all weaknesses all failures forever forever forever gone from me there is value friends in being a sacred space that god can dwell in there's value in it tonight i hope i'm this preaching this little sermon i'm going to close here in a minute but i hope that this series has shown you that the coming of the lord is far more than just the dead in christ rise and we get changed oh friends this is something that's been going on it's moving around the world it's calling a bride it's separating around yes we got failures but we won't have yes we got weaknesses but we won't have oh yes i still gotta i still gotta battle me you won't after a while oh hallelujah i want to be a sacred space i want to be a place where the word of god can move in and out of my life oh hallelujah you become permanently exempt from decay when the presence of god is dwelling present in the holy of holies in your heart your soul friends becomes exempt from decay or the possibility of ever being lost again now you hit the devil between the eyes with that one you let him know i am a royal priesthood i god comes down and lives in the in the most holy place of my soul and i am exempt from decay i have no possibility of ever being lost again what a glorious testimony i have no possibility brother branham tells him that message and i'll close with this it's such a beautiful story you've heard it so many times about the violin that they were auctioning they couldn't get anything for it nobody even want to bid on it it was it was you know it was dilapidated and and grungy and broken and it you know just it just looked like a piece of junk but there was a master violinist in the audience who looked at it and knew that it was a masterpiece no one knew but his eye was trained to catch it and he gets up and comes forward and says may i examine it and when he examines it his all everything that he thought was true and he takes his little bag and he opens up all of the little stuff and he starts cleaning it and tuning it and rosining the bow and getting everything ready and then he picks it up into his hands and the master begins to express his inner music through this instrument and that and that that music from the master went through the instrument and into the people and people became enraptured and they bid ten thousand a hundred thousand a million dollars and that the thing just it became a priceless violin that's a story out of history what what happened friends the master picked it up oh my my my it's not you see you understand that's what god did to you you understand that that's the reason he did it he picked you up you were broken and rubbish and you were ready for nothing and he picks you up cleans you up tunes your life and rosins everything up and gets it ready why so that he can express his music through you to the world so that the world can see value in him not valuing you valuing him that's why we're priesthood to lift up praises to god see you say oh my if you just knew my life brother jason preacher man my life if you only knew my past but friends you have to understand that redemption redemption comes not to deal with what we did but redemption comes to deal with what we had become it had nothing to do with what i did in my past it's it's i was born in sin i was a son of god but i got trapped in a wrong kind of a birth had nothing to do with what i did it's what i had become and he come to redeem me back hallelujah and through his sacrifice at calvary and the baptism of the holy spirit he has redeemed my life back to him and dismissed everything that i ever did wrong dismissed it completely out of existence out of his memory can never be brought against me as a charge has secured me into the kingdom how did it happen how did i get out of that trap how i was trapped in sin trapped in death was cut off from his presence but the master picked me up i'm in his hands today oh this is why i told your friends when revelation 18 4 i hope you remember that one from part two or three or somewhere wherever i said it in revelation 18 4 come out of her my people don't don't just think of that as being rescued out of false doctrine come out of everything the devil put on you that's what the message get calls you to that kind of a freedom come out of everything he's ever bound you with come out of every complex he's ever given you come out of every weakness come out of every every up and down come out of come out of all of that come up into the revealed word of the hour come up into purity come up into holiness come up into innocence i want my life to be that instrument in his hands amen i want my life to be that instrument in his hands i want my life to create a sacred place of uh worship i don't want to have to wait for the world to come uh uh because brother branham said right now this is garden time right now think about that garden time right now say that back in the late 60s it's already garden time oh
