[40:49] with sitting with you in thy throne when
[40:52] we have overcome
[40:53] and lord help us

[41:09] you're still following up with our
[41:10] scriptures that we're ready here
[41:13] on wednesday
[41:17] and the title be the same maybe just
[41:20] part two
[41:24] song of solomon chapter three
[41:29] from verse one
[41:36] by night on my bed
[41:41] i saw him whom my soul loveth
[41:44] i saw him but if i phone him not
[41:49] i'll rise now and go about a city in the
[41:52] streets and in the broad ways
[41:55] i will seek him on my soul love is
[41:59] i saw him but i phoned him not
[42:04] the watchmen
[42:05] that go about the city phoned me
[42:09] to whom i said
[42:10] so he him whom my soul loveth
[42:16] he doesn't write the answer that they
[42:18] had in other words it was relevant
[42:24] it was
[42:26] very little that i passed from them
[42:31] but i phoned him whom my soul loveth
[42:34] i held him i would not let him go
[42:37] until i had brought him into my mother's
[42:40] house
[42:41] and into the chamber of her
[42:44] that conceived me
[42:48] i charge you ye daughters of jerusalem
[42:51] by the rose and by the hands of the
[42:53] field that you stand not up nor awake my
[42:57] love till he please
[43:02] now he's talking about love as a person
[43:06] because charity that is christ the
[43:08] capstone is a man
[43:14] and verse 6 he says who is this that
[43:16] cometh out of the wilderness
[43:23] like pillars of smoke perfumed with mars
[43:26] and frances
[43:28] with all powders
[43:30] of the merchant
[43:33] behold his bed
[43:35] which is ceremonies
[43:38] thrisco
[43:39] men about it
[43:42] of the variant of israel
[43:46] they all hold his words
[43:48] being expat you know
[43:51] every man has his sword upon his thigh
[43:54] because of the fear
[43:56] in the night
[43:58] we went through that last time and i
[44:00] wanted just to go back again a little
[44:02] bit in the book of matthew chapter 13
[44:05] in verse um
[44:07] 25 let me read but while man slept his
[44:11] enemy came and sold tears among the
[44:14] wheat and went his way
[44:16] but when the blood was sprung up and
[44:18] brought forth fruit then appeared the
[44:21] tears also so the servants of the
[44:24] householder came and said unto him sir
[44:27] they thou not
[44:29] saw good seed in the field from whence
[44:32] then has it tears
[44:34] and he said unto them the enemy has done
[44:38] this i just wanted to end there
[44:41] may god bless his word and bless you may
[44:43] be seated
[44:47] now the enemy
[44:49] has nothing has no interest in the field
[44:54] until the field has been sold with a
[44:56] good seat
[45:03] the enemy had no much interest in you
[45:06] until you became a child of god
[45:13] just like
[45:14] you are just like an ordinary person
[45:18] are healthy valuable because you have
[45:21] the birthright
[45:24] it's only when the birthright is taken
[45:26] away from you that you become nothing
[45:29] but when you have the birthright you're
[45:32] something special
[45:34] blessed be the name of the lord
[45:36] so now we look at this we talked about
[45:39] this sometime i mean on wednesday so i'm
[45:42] just going to skip a few things and pick
[45:45] just a few verses that i want us to
[45:47] still look at
[45:49] we saw the watchmen
[45:51] we knew that they had left their posts
[45:53] they are you know you know guarded posts
[45:56] of duty that's why they had no answer
[46:00] now the woman didn't say preach me a
[46:02] good summon about him
[46:05] tell me convincing quotes about him
[46:08] tell me your testimonies about him
[46:11] tell me what you know about him but the
[46:14] question is where can i find him
[46:18] where is he
[46:21] and i think that is where we've come to
[46:23] as the bride of jesus christ i mean good
[46:26] summons good songs that's wonderful
[46:28] go to preachers influential experienced
[46:32] perfectionists
[46:35] that's wonderful we found god for them
[46:37] but where is he
[46:40] that's what i'm looking for that's why
[46:42] you are here
[46:44] you cannot be the bride
[46:47] when you have not set your eyes
[46:50] upon the bridegroom when you have not
[46:52] really touched him the bible says that
[46:54] which we had from the beginning that
[46:57] which we had that which we saw and that
[47:00] which we have handled with our own hands
[47:03] of the word of life
[47:06] so the bridegroom has to be united with
[47:09] a bride and it has to be a reality it
[47:12] should not be an assumption
[47:16] we are moving from the grounds of
[47:19] assumption to reality
[47:22] so that you are standing on the ground
[47:24] that you know i'm standing on the solid
[47:26] rock solid ground
[47:29] and those are the people that they're
[47:30] very scared of they never is not scared
[47:33] about when you are moving from pillar to
[47:35] bust looking for truth looking for this
[47:38] and today i want us to go back to this
[47:40] scripture where he says he she had just
[47:44] passed them
[47:45] in other words
[47:47] he was beyond them he was beyond their
[47:50] rich
[47:53] they were the ones who were supposed to
[47:54] have really pointed out to her where he
[47:57] is but because they have backslidden
[47:59] from their god posts
[48:02] they are also working on the level of
[48:05] commoners
[48:08] glory be to god
[48:10] and that's why when we have today i was
[48:12] sharing a verse where the prophet says i
[48:15] mean it's called where the prophet says
[48:16] if you've got a pastor that tells you
[48:19] the truth that
[48:20] points you to reality points you to
[48:22] jesus
[48:24] stay there and respect that man and love
[48:27] him because
[48:28] many are failing now to point you to him
[48:31] where is he
[48:33] who is he
[48:34] how can i get to him
[48:38] amen
[48:40] and we have come to a time that we are
[48:41] not going to point people to our
[48:43] churches let the people
[48:45] find that he is in us he we have got him
[48:49] then they will follow us like the
[48:50] prophet says just live a life that that
[48:53] makes you the salt of the earth until
[48:56] you cause the fast
[48:58] in the people because they have tested
[49:01] the salt
[49:03] glory beer oh god
[49:05] so now this woman where does if she
[49:08] find him she finds him whom her soul
[49:11] loves beyond
[49:14] the watchmen
[49:17] glory be it oh god
[49:19] and that's what i was preaching in lima
[49:21] i was talking about what did you go into
[49:23] the wilderness look for
[49:26] and i was talking about receiving the
[49:28] mysterious reality of the more than
[49:32] prophet
[49:33] ministry
[49:35] they were ending at the office of the
[49:37] prophet
[49:39] they all took john the baptist for a
[49:41] prophet
[49:42] they took jesus for a prophet but that
[49:45] didn't bother i mean it benefited them
[49:48] so knowing this prophet like he's a
[49:50] prophet you can do it you can know him
[49:53] 30 years 20 years 50 years but that is
[49:56] not enough you have to go beyond the
[49:59] office of a prophet to what this prophet
[50:02] pointed you to
[50:03] so we thank god and brother brother was
[50:05] not just a prophet he was more than a
[50:08] prophet because he was a prophet
[50:10] messenger he brought a message and the
[50:12] message that he brought was he pointed
[50:14] us to christ he introduced christ to us
[50:18] so i mean why are we trying to focus on
[50:21] the prophet he said this he did this he
[50:24] accumulate he because people are stuck
[50:25] he met didn't
[50:27] at the office of the prophet
[50:30] they are trying to examine the prophet
[50:32] well the prophet is just a victim like i
[50:34] said he's a victim because he didn't
[50:36] want to be a prophet he didn't want even
[50:38] to preach this message he said i would
[50:40] rather even like i'm skinned than even
[50:42] to say it but i i'm obligated to say it
[50:45] not because i want to say it but because
[50:47] i have to say it
[50:49] so now you see when you begin to focus
[50:52] on brother brahm the man there are very
[50:54] many mistakes and god allowed them to be
[50:56] there
[50:57] to blind those who are going to look at
[51:00] the man the office
[51:02] well he said this he did it he did it he
[51:04] behaved like this you are very right you
[51:07] may even have quotes
[51:09] to point out where he's wrong you are
[51:11] intellect you know intellectual enough
[51:13] to find faults
[51:15] just like you could be intellectual
[51:16] enough to find faults in jesus
[51:20] and a man of god including jesus himself
[51:22] was god in flesh if you would go to him
[51:25] using intellectualism you'll find what
[51:27] faults and god purpose them to be there
[51:31] could you imagine brother jason coming
[51:33] here or going to any church here and he
[51:35] finds people doing wrong things that he
[51:37] whips them out
[51:39] what would you think
[51:41] with your delicate hypersensitive
[51:44] american lifestyle
[51:47] someone comes with a whip
[51:50] and a sharp sharp and with a very angry
[51:54] face come on mr perfect love
[51:58] we have not seen love today
[52:01] so if you are looking for fault you
[52:03] would have got it
[52:05] but he was not wrong
[52:07] he was right
[52:08] but physically morally
[52:14] he's not like the good
[52:16] good or the kind of priest like brother
[52:18] brother talks about him the good old
[52:21] kind priest who was sick when he was who
[52:24] came to see you when you're very sick
[52:27] and you were in the hospital good old
[52:30] kindly priest
[52:31] who is he that kisses your babies when
[52:33] they are crying and you know soothes
[52:36] them and shows them good all kind of
[52:38] priests who is he that comes and sits by
[52:41] you and tells you you know good words
[52:44] that you want to hear good old kind
[52:46] priest and then all of a sudden there
[52:47] comes some man with a whip
[52:52] and he whips people out of the temple
[52:55] who do that be your pastor
[52:58] would you go for that man
[53:03] it becomes very easy for us actually to
[53:05] believe jesus today and we would have
[53:07] believed when he was there physically
[53:10] i'm saying it
[53:13] if
[53:14] brother
[53:15] jason would stand here and just say you
[53:18] all devil get behind me
[53:21] sure
[53:25] and you have just called it the same man
[53:27] blessed are thou simon by jonah because
[53:31] flesh and blood has not revealed this
[53:33] but my father in heaven has revealed in
[53:35] the same chapter a few moments ago he's
[53:38] a blessed and now he's all devil get
[53:41] behind me
[53:44] satan
[53:45] you call him satan
[53:48] a ki believe in the church not in the
[53:51] pastor's office but public in the church
[53:54] among others
[53:55] at least he could have had the respect
[53:58] to call him in the office
[54:01] he shouldn't have told me that in the
[54:03] presence of other people
[54:05] now what does he mean how does he expect
[54:08] those people to look at me when they
[54:09] look at me every how to how do they
[54:12] think about me bring it in the common
[54:14] sense
[54:16] common reasoning
[54:19] you would find a lot of food for her
[54:21] from that and there are very many people
[54:22] who have left the church for very
[54:24] similar statements what about if they
[54:26] were to call you saturn
[54:30] that is the jesus you believe
[54:32] would you have to do that
[54:35] if they were you you were the one to be
[54:36] called saturn
[54:39] let me give you another example
[54:41] he tells the disciple he says when i
[54:43] sent you the other time did you go with
[54:45] anything nothing
[54:47] now i want to tell you that if you don't
[54:50] have a sword then you better sell your
[54:52] clock and buy one
[54:54] jesus tell us the disciples
[54:56] and they know that our lord is telling
[54:58] us to buy swords so they sell their
[55:00] clocks and buy swords and then the next
[55:03] day
[55:04] the opportunity to use this sword
[55:07] maybe this is why he told us to buy the
[55:09] swords
[55:11] peter pulls it out
[55:14] and he cuts off malka's ear
[55:16] and he's
[55:18] like surprised jesus put it back
[55:23] they that leave by their sword shall
[55:25] perish by the sword
[55:29] and then he picks the the peace that he
[55:31] has cut down and he puts it back on the
[55:34] ear and heals it
[55:36] what do you think
[55:39] did he trick us did he tempt us did he
[55:42] what did he mean by if you don't have a
[55:44] sword sell your clock and buy one and
[55:47] now he turns around today and he says
[55:49] well if you live by the sword which he
[55:52] told us to buy if we live by the sword
[55:55] and he's the one who told us to buy then
[55:58] we shall die by the sword so that means
[56:00] he wants us to die by this lord because
[56:02] he told us to buy this what you do have
[56:06] a lot of common sense there
[56:12] but peter never answered the word
[56:16] one day he was asked if he would also
[56:18] want to leave his head to whom else
[56:20] shall we go
[56:22] he doesn't say because you are the best
[56:25] ex you know ex you know teacher the best
[56:28] preacher the world has god you have the
[56:31] best pastor no
[56:33] he says
[56:34] thou alone has the words of life
[56:42] so now you see this woman is looking for
[56:45] reality and the church today is looking
[56:47] for reality and until you have got him
[56:50] you are in trouble i want to tell you
[56:52] sister brother until you got him and
[56:54] brought him in your mother's chamber
[56:57] which is the holy ghost chamber because
[56:59] we proved the other time that your
[57:01] mother's chamber the holy ghost is your
[57:03] mother and your mother's house or
[57:05] mother's chamber is the body and then
[57:07] when you get him and bring him in the
[57:08] body you are now safe
[57:11] no man is going to deceive you
[57:13] you got reality
[57:15] no no no psychology no manipulation no
[57:18] explanation
[57:19] no scientific interference
[57:23] will no examination of the prophet
[57:26] nothing because you go to him
[57:29] you got him already
[57:31] he's in your room he's here
[57:35] blessed be the name of the lord and god
[57:37] waiting if there is a tomorrow we shall
[57:38] find out why is he here
[57:42] why is he
[57:44] not elsewhere
[57:46] so he says
[57:47] he gets him he says i can now not let
[57:50] him go
[57:52] that means you must be very careful not
[57:55] to do what can make him go
[57:59] and now
[58:01] he she gives a little glimpse of where
[58:05] he was
[58:07] because not only was he in the streets
[58:12] no
[58:14] he came from somewhere into the streets
[58:17] just because she was in the streets
[58:22] this is explained in verse 6 where he
[58:25] says who is this
[58:28] that cometh out of the wilderness
[58:32] so he came out of the wilderness
[58:37] to meet him to meet her in the street
[58:41] and he came you know he said she says
[58:44] who is this that cometh out of the
[58:46] wilderness
[58:47] like pillars of smoke
[58:50] perfumed with mar that is death the
[58:53] anointing of death
[58:56] when he comes to you you should be ready
[58:58] to die
[59:01] mar was and frank says where the
[59:04] perfumes that way for the anointing of
[59:07] the dead
[59:09] so he only comes to you this time when
[59:12] you are going to accept to die
[59:15] you are going to be anointed you are
[59:17] going to share the anointing of death
[59:21] you die out
[59:23] then his life is manifested in you
[59:25] that's what it's meaning
[59:27] he doesn't just it's not just available
[59:29] in the streets
[59:31] he's coming from the wilderness and this
[59:33] is the same man of whom this question
[59:36] was asked when he came to jerusalem who
[59:39] is this
[59:41] the same question who is this
[59:45] was asked when jesus came triumphantly
[59:49] into jerusalem and all the denominations
[59:53] the sanhedrin the preachers will say who
[59:55] is this
[1:00:00] so the who is this
[1:00:02] was the bridegroom
[1:00:04] that this woman was looking for
[1:00:06] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:00:08] but who were asking in jerusalem when
[1:00:10] you read i think luke chapter 21 they
[1:00:12] were saying who is this who were asking
[1:00:15] that who is this the clyde the sanhedrin
[1:00:18] the preachers the pastors
[1:00:21] blinded by the nominations critics and
[1:00:23] dogmas and they don't know him
[1:00:26] they don't know the man whom this woman
[1:00:29] has been looking for
[1:00:32] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:00:34] so she comes i mean he comes from the
[1:00:36] wilderness
[1:00:38] and i want you to look at something from
[1:00:40] the wilderness
[1:00:43] there's something special about the
[1:00:44] wilderness
[1:00:48] because if we go to luke chapter 7
[1:00:51] from verse 24 quickly
[1:00:55] if i can get it look chapter 7 from
[1:00:57] verse 24.
[1:01:00] i want us to examine something about the
[1:01:03] wilderness
[1:01:07] jesus saying here
[1:01:09] in verse 24 and when the messengers of
[1:01:11] john where departed he began to speak
[1:01:13] unto the people concerning john
[1:01:18] and he's what is he saying what way
[1:01:20] out into the wilderness for to see
[1:01:29] glory oh god
[1:01:32] there is something about the wilderness
[1:01:38] and that's why every genuine prophet of
[1:01:40] god loves the wilderness
[1:01:44] he's not in a a place where people are
[1:01:47] packed and strips and and you know where
[1:01:49] everything noisy places where people go
[1:01:52] on the beaches and you know places where
[1:01:55] people want to be he's always in
[1:01:57] isolation
[1:02:01] but there is something he's doing in the
[1:02:03] wilderness which is on a temporal basis
[1:02:07] why in the wilderness and jesus says
[1:02:10] what went he out in the wilderness for
[1:02:13] to see
[1:02:14] is a reed shaking with the wind
[1:02:20] and then he comes but what went he out
[1:02:22] for to see a man clothing soft raymond
[1:02:26] because they which are
[1:02:29] gorgeously like a parody and leave this
[1:02:32] delicately in the king's courts
[1:02:34] but what went you out for to see a
[1:02:36] prophet yes yes i say unto you and more
[1:02:40] than a prophet
[1:02:41] this is he of whom it's written behold
[1:02:43] i'll send my messenger before thy face
[1:02:46] we shall prepare thy way before thee
[1:02:50] and he says i say unto you among those
[1:02:52] that are born of women there is no
[1:02:54] reason there is not a greater prophet
[1:02:56] than john the baptist but he that's
[1:02:58] least in the kingdom of god is greater
[1:03:00] than john he's talking about john
[1:03:03] and in matthew chapter 11 he says if you
[1:03:06] are to receive it this is the elijah
[1:03:08] this is the elias who was to come
[1:03:12] but this very john had denied that he
[1:03:14] was elias i'm not going to enter into
[1:03:16] that that is another someone somewhere
[1:03:19] that i preached
[1:03:21] but there is something about the
[1:03:23] wilderness
[1:03:24] that these prophets always go to
[1:03:26] moses phoned him in the wilderness and
[1:03:29] the back side of the desert
[1:03:31] so was always elijah in the wilderness
[1:03:34] elisha would go to the wilderness
[1:03:36] john the baptist from the age of 9 to 30
[1:03:39] years when he introduced jesus he was in
[1:03:41] the wilderness
[1:03:43] himself was a wilderness man he would
[1:03:46] only come to jerusalem but go back to
[1:03:48] the wilderness
[1:03:49] brother branham was a wilderness man
[1:03:54] and he says when i'm there i'm i'm very
[1:03:56] calm and refreshed why
[1:04:02] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:04:05] so if you come here
[1:04:07] i i wanted us to come to something what
[1:04:10] the prophet says here
[1:04:14] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:04:19] in the wilderness
[1:04:21] he comes here in the message
[1:04:24] spirit of truth i think he preaches it
[1:04:26] 1963.
[1:04:28] he says he's talking about
[1:04:34] you are
[1:04:36] the other
[1:04:37] part of america alaska
[1:04:41] it says and then on
[1:04:43] then from then on 600 miles the way the
[1:04:47] crow flies and there's not even a path
[1:04:50] or a trail
[1:04:51] and when you hit the west coast you go
[1:04:54] about 800 miles to vancouver
[1:04:57] and there's not even a speck of
[1:04:59] civilization
[1:05:01] and the next civilizations going this
[1:05:04] way is anchorage about
[1:05:06] seven or eight hundred miles
[1:05:09] go back this way you run into a little
[1:05:11] city yellowknife
[1:05:14] where you get a ship in there once a
[1:05:16] year for the eskimos
[1:05:19] and next you hit russia
[1:05:22] now i want you to listen what he says
[1:05:26] so you are he's talking about why he
[1:05:28] wanted to go and heidi there
[1:05:30] he likes to be there where he's very far
[1:05:33] away from civilization all sides
[1:05:36] hundreds of miles away he wants to be by
[1:05:39] himself there
[1:05:42] so he says so you are really to yourself
[1:05:47] that's where god can take his rest
[1:05:55] that's where god can take his rest up
[1:05:59] there
[1:06:00] from all of our troubles
[1:06:03] and the trials that we put him into
[1:06:13] glory be to god
[1:06:17] god rests there
[1:06:19] deep away the wilderness
[1:06:23] and you see what a prophet says so i
[1:06:26] would like to go up there and talk to
[1:06:28] him when he's resting
[1:06:35] resting from what from all our troubles
[1:06:38] and trials that we put him into
[1:06:40] he flees away
[1:06:42] from a troublesome nagging church
[1:06:49] he sees you quarreling with your wife
[1:06:52] pushing her arguing around he goes to
[1:06:54] the wilderness
[1:06:57] that's where the holy spirit always
[1:06:58] flies
[1:07:02] he descended he doesn't have to go back
[1:07:04] he's here
[1:07:06] but he goes somewhere
[1:07:08] and that's why these prophets always
[1:07:11] know where to find him
[1:07:18] and that's what i want you every brother
[1:07:20] and sister here to know
[1:07:22] that you are not going to find god in a
[1:07:24] multitude you are not going to find god
[1:07:27] in the common places you are not going
[1:07:29] to find god in this use of places you
[1:07:32] want to be where everybody wants to be
[1:07:35] you are not going to find god's presence
[1:07:37] in those atmospheres that the world
[1:07:39] enjoys
[1:07:40] you can go an extra mile an extra mile
[1:07:44] now i'm talking about spiritually do you
[1:07:46] know that prayer is an extra mile do you
[1:07:48] know that fasting seeking god is an
[1:07:50] extra mind
[1:07:52] putting aside cutting off yourself
[1:07:54] switching off your phones and everything
[1:07:56] and you see today we are so connected to
[1:07:59] the world
[1:08:00] that you even feel like switching off
[1:08:02] your phone for one hour two hours in the
[1:08:04] service it's too much
[1:08:10] but those are the streets that he is not
[1:08:12] there
[1:08:13] you are connected to the people you will
[1:08:15] not find god there you only find spirits
[1:08:18] and demons and wrong influence
[1:08:20] but there is a place to go
[1:08:23] and you have to put in effort he's
[1:08:24] hiding somewhere you'll find him and
[1:08:27] he'll show up to you when he's coming
[1:08:29] from the wilderness and the prophet says
[1:08:32] i want to go there
[1:08:36] talk to him
[1:08:37] where he's resting
[1:08:40] from our from people's believers he
[1:08:43] includes himself
[1:08:45] so he projects himself from the group
[1:08:49] and he goes as an individual
[1:08:53] so that it's not god is not now dealing
[1:08:55] with our problem
[1:08:57] but he's going to deal with him as an
[1:08:59] individual
[1:09:00] amen
[1:09:01] blessed be the name of the lord amazing
[1:09:04] now
[1:09:05] this is a quote which is very
[1:09:06] interesting
[1:09:10] and i've always wondered why and this is
[1:09:13] the first time i'm speaking about it
[1:09:16] first time i knew about it a long time
[1:09:18] but i was always wondering why the
[1:09:20] prophet say this
[1:09:22] why he wants to go and hide in that
[1:09:25] place where he's thousands of miles this
[1:09:28] way no civilization hundreds no
[1:09:30] civilization no civilization he's
[1:09:32] surrounded by himself and he says in
[1:09:34] that wilderness
[1:09:36] is where god takes rest
[1:09:40] from our
[1:09:42] troubles
[1:09:44] and trials that we put him into
[1:09:48] like we embarrass him all the time we
[1:09:51] ashame him all the time we speak
[1:09:53] nonsense we argue and stew and fast
[1:09:58] until the holy spirit is grieved where
[1:10:01] does he go he goes to take a rest
[1:10:04] because here he has not found the rest
[1:10:08] there has to be certain things put right
[1:10:10] until this one becomes his resting place
[1:10:13] and that's why i was calling it the rest
[1:10:15] the final resting place
[1:10:18] do you know that you don't own yourself
[1:10:20] according to first corinthians 6 18 says
[1:10:22] this body is not yours you don't own it
[1:10:25] you are bought with a price you are paid
[1:10:27] for it belongs to him but we are scaring
[1:10:30] the owner out of his body out of his
[1:10:33] temple and we are welcoming demons we
[1:10:36] are welcoming spirits we are copying and
[1:10:38] pasting lifestyles of non-believers make
[1:10:42] believers you know masquerade us and we
[1:10:45] are chasing away the dove
[1:10:51] so brother branham in order to get the
[1:10:53] fresh message to hear directly from god
[1:10:56] he knew where to find him
[1:11:04] so you love those places where everybody
[1:11:07] wants to go watch out
[1:11:09] i was hearing brother yesterday
[1:11:11] yesterday speaking
[1:11:13] and he was saying everything that we do
[1:11:15] even what we call a habit is a spirit
[1:11:20] no habit no act no thought no do no work
[1:11:24] that you do lacks the spirit behind it
[1:11:26] so you have to ask yourself is this the
[1:11:28] spirit of god
[1:11:31] or my spirit or spirits that i copy
[1:11:34] is it a christianity like brother balaam
[1:11:36] calls a church spirit
[1:11:40] this is how we clap this is how we do it
[1:11:43] so i want to do it like sister so and so
[1:11:45] this is how the other sister dances this
[1:11:47] is how the brother i i like it when
[1:11:49] brother jason shakes his head and says
[1:11:51] hallelujah i want to copy that
[1:11:59] so
[1:12:00] why did he wanted to go there
[1:12:04] let me repeat this
[1:12:06] so you are really to yourself
[1:12:09] and i want to tell you friends
[1:12:13] you will know your relationship with the
[1:12:16] good how it is when you remain alone in
[1:12:19] that house or in that forest or wherever
[1:12:21] you are and you start to sing and you
[1:12:23] start to pray you will know either you
[1:12:26] are just a hypocrite
[1:12:28] a masquerader
[1:12:30] acting christianity or you are a real
[1:12:33] christian those moments when you are
[1:12:35] alone it is always very easy for us to
[1:12:38] get in the spirit when we are singing
[1:12:40] together like this
[1:12:44] it's very easy that's why it is very
[1:12:47] easy for for for you to come here and
[1:12:49] and dance and sing and clap but when you
[1:12:53] are alone can you do it
[1:12:57] when you are alone do you sing
[1:12:59] do you enjoy that song the way you know
[1:13:03] like like like i was telling one brother
[1:13:05] somewhere
[1:13:06] he says i want to go and sing for this
[1:13:08] ch the church in this song i said you
[1:13:10] have to move away from singing for the
[1:13:12] church
[1:13:13] and you sing for god
[1:13:18] let the church just benefit
[1:13:20] because they are there and god is in
[1:13:23] them
[1:13:25] but we don't sing for the church we sing
[1:13:28] for god and if you go beyond singing for
[1:13:31] the church and you are singing for god
[1:13:33] then wherever you are that song will be
[1:13:36] as sweet
[1:13:38] as meaningful as impactful and even more
[1:13:42] maybe with the tears maybe the prayer
[1:13:45] then you can find it in the church here
[1:13:47] but you'll find that when you go back to
[1:13:49] our homes we are very dry
[1:13:53] we can't even sing
[1:13:55] you do you are busy knocking up your
[1:13:57] plates and sausages and spoons and so
[1:13:59] forth but you don't even sing a song
[1:14:03] maybe it's only when you're annoyed and
[1:14:05] then you want to spiritually
[1:14:07] you know press the spiritual appearance
[1:14:09] and then you want to scare your husband
[1:14:11] or your wife whoever annoyed you that
[1:14:13] you are in the spirit you should be
[1:14:14] careful so you begin to sing a song
[1:14:20] and i say amazing grace that save the
[1:14:23] sinner like me rich like me to condemn
[1:14:25] him because he was rebuking you you know
[1:14:29] so
[1:14:30] god is
[1:14:31] rich like me so you better be careful i
[1:14:34] may be not perfect but i'm god is
[1:14:36] i'm god is rich you know so you may sing
[1:14:39] a song just to intimidate someone but
[1:14:41] you are not again in the spirit
[1:14:47] so he says so you are really to yourself
[1:14:53] you and him
[1:14:55] so how do you feel there
[1:14:57] how do you talk to him how do you relate
[1:15:00] to him how long does your prayer take
[1:15:03] does the fire catch up or you just
[1:15:05] struggle and struggle on your own and
[1:15:07] begin repeating yourself
[1:15:10] how do you feel when you are alone have
[1:15:13] you ever taken a trip to the wilderness
[1:15:18] have you ever taken a trip to the
[1:15:20] wilderness you that wilderness i'm not
[1:15:23] meaning the alaska one now this time a
[1:15:25] meaning and a wilderness where are you
[1:15:27] and your god you are alone
[1:15:30] cut off
[1:15:33] aha
[1:15:36] i've seen here in america you have a
[1:15:37] good custom way when someone wants to
[1:15:40] come the author is maybe confessing or
[1:15:42] repenting and the family members want to
[1:15:44] accompany that person i mean it's all
[1:15:47] that he feels the solidarity of the
[1:15:49] family they are praying together with me
[1:15:50] that is good but i mean
[1:15:53] what about if you went alone
[1:15:56] because if it is a scene you did it
[1:15:58] alone
[1:16:00] you are responsible as you
[1:16:02] it's not wrong for someone to escort you
[1:16:04] but
[1:16:05] have you ever sought god alone do you
[1:16:07] know that when you when if you go to god
[1:16:09] as you you'll be more sincere and you
[1:16:12] speak more words and you repent more
[1:16:15] better
[1:16:16] than when you are accompanied by a group
[1:16:22] do you know that we have we love our our
[1:16:25] our pies and our you know all these
[1:16:28] things that you have you have
[1:16:30] hamburgers and pies and we don't have
[1:16:32] those so you have a lot to choose from
[1:16:35] now
[1:16:36] have you ever if you're a young man have
[1:16:39] you ever even fasted 24 hours
[1:16:42] ask yourself a question have you ever
[1:16:44] waited upon god for even a day
[1:16:50] jesus asked the disciples can't you pray
[1:16:52] with me just one hour
[1:16:57] and they couldn't
[1:16:58] in that crucial time
[1:17:00] one hour
[1:17:02] he comes he finds them snoring sleeping
[1:17:07] they were not
[1:17:08] because he would leave them
[1:17:11] to pray by himself
[1:17:13] and he comes back they're sleeping
[1:17:17] that's why they would also be very
[1:17:19] spiritual when he's around and when he's
[1:17:21] not you remember the time they brought
[1:17:23] that epileptical boy and they could only
[1:17:26] cast out the devil
[1:17:28] and then jesus says how long would i
[1:17:30] suffer you people you are always very
[1:17:32] spiritual and vibrant when i'm here
[1:17:37] learn to go to the wilderness so you are
[1:17:40] really to yourself that's where god can
[1:17:42] take his rest up there from all of our
[1:17:45] troubles and try us that we put him into
[1:17:49] so i like to go up he doesn't say with
[1:17:52] my wife
[1:17:56] i like to go up there and talk to him
[1:17:59] when he's resting
[1:18:01] you see so that when so so then when
[1:18:05] like it was last night on the ship he's
[1:18:08] comparing when he was on the
[1:18:10] ship you know jesus rested slept
[1:18:14] on the ship
[1:18:19] and the disciples went to him he didn't
[1:18:21] come to them
[1:18:23] they went to him master we perish save
[1:18:26] us
[1:18:28] blessed be the name of the lord so he is
[1:18:31] in the wilderness so what did you go
[1:18:34] into the wilderness to see
[1:18:40] have you seen him
[1:18:41] have in any case did you ever go to the
[1:18:44] wilderness
[1:18:46] have you ever gone there as an
[1:18:47] individual
[1:18:51] and if you have not
[1:18:53] how do you see him because it is only
[1:18:55] those who went
[1:18:56] who are having an answer to this
[1:18:59] question
[1:19:02] so but also it depends on whom did you
[1:19:05] intend to see
[1:19:08] so there are those who went to see mr
[1:19:10] perfect mr smartman mr intellectual mr
[1:19:13] oretta they didn't find him
[1:19:17] and that's why when you come to this
[1:19:18] message and you want him to look to sin
[1:19:21] brother brother mr intellectual mr
[1:19:23] perfect mr dis they are trying to look
[1:19:25] at him
[1:19:27] and they think brother branham was in
[1:19:29] the wilderness introducing himself no
[1:19:32] he was in the in the wilderness
[1:19:34] interacting having fellowship with mr
[1:19:37] jesus whom he's introducing to the bride
[1:19:40] that's why he says i loved going to the
[1:19:42] wilderness to have a talk with him so
[1:19:44] who was the main person in the
[1:19:46] wilderness it's not the prophet
[1:19:49] no it is this man so whom did you go to
[1:19:51] see where me i saw i went to receive him
[1:19:54] and saying yeah okay if you received to
[1:19:56] respond to receive the message what was
[1:19:57] the message of the messenger
[1:20:01] have you got the reality of what the
[1:20:03] messenger introduced to your avent god
[1:20:06] if you have any god then there is a
[1:20:08] problem
[1:20:11] blessed be the name of the lord so here
[1:20:13] he says
[1:20:14] you know like the man from the east
[1:20:17] like we said on wednesday
[1:20:19] they came
[1:20:20] but when they thought they are going to
[1:20:22] find him in the streets of jerusalem
[1:20:24] they start left to them
[1:20:27] how did they follow the star
[1:20:30] it would have led them somewhere else
[1:20:33] not in a powerful hotel not in a
[1:20:35] powerful hospital
[1:20:37] but in a little cabin somewhere
[1:20:41] in a manger
[1:20:44] in the bush
[1:20:46] where the animals stay
[1:20:49] nothing attractive about it
[1:20:51] but there is where god of all heaven was
[1:20:57] so when they went to the places they
[1:20:59] thought he was they missed him
[1:21:01] and they start after them
[1:21:04] blessed be the name of the lord and
[1:21:06] today we may even think
[1:21:09] if i got to this man if i went to this
[1:21:10] man if i went to this man which is good
[1:21:12] to look for good ministries you can come
[1:21:15] and be another pastor like this one whom
[1:21:17] i respect but the problem is are you
[1:21:20] just going to be under the shadow of
[1:21:22] that pastoral ministry or you are
[1:21:24] interested in getting a hold of the
[1:21:26] reality that he's presenting
[1:21:30] just saying well i am in bethel
[1:21:32] tabernacle and you think you'll draw you
[1:21:34] a comfort from being in bethel
[1:21:36] tabernacle
[1:21:37] you are not having reality
[1:21:40] because at bethel tabernacle we don't
[1:21:42] come to meet a man
[1:21:45] we come to be introduced to the other
[1:21:47] man
[1:21:48] jesus christ himself
[1:21:51] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:21:53] so now i want us to look at this
[1:21:56] where do you find him
[1:21:59] the prophet continues
[1:22:00] among our kindreds
[1:22:02] among us the baptists
[1:22:04] methodists presbyterians so forth see if
[1:22:07] you find it no sir
[1:22:09] you don't find him amongst our king's
[1:22:12] folks
[1:22:13] so you go beyond your king's folks
[1:22:18] you go beyond family religion you go
[1:22:21] beyond my dad was a pastor my dad was a
[1:22:24] minister the message my mama received so
[1:22:27] many visitors our home we grew in this
[1:22:29] mercy you must have a personal
[1:22:31] experience with you that you have met
[1:22:34] him
[1:22:35] not just you grew up in the messenger
[1:22:37] family
[1:22:39] no
[1:22:41] you can't find him among her relatives
[1:22:47] no sir
[1:22:49] the only way you find him is the way
[1:22:51] that mary and joseph phoned him where
[1:22:53] they left him
[1:22:56] glory be to god he says that's where
[1:22:59] they they find him and that's where you
[1:23:02] find him
[1:23:04] they okay where where did they leave him
[1:23:07] at the pentecostal feast hallelujah
[1:23:09] that's where the church will find him
[1:23:10] again go back to the feast of the of
[1:23:13] pentecost go back to the outpost the
[1:23:15] pouring out of the holy ghost and there
[1:23:18] you'll find the power of almighty god
[1:23:21] you'll find the risen christ
[1:23:25] you'll find the signs and wonders of him
[1:23:28] just exactly like he said he would be
[1:23:32] the works that i do shall you do also
[1:23:35] you
[1:23:36] you
[1:23:37] shall not selected a few
[1:23:41] but you
[1:23:43] these signs shall follow them that
[1:23:44] believe in my name
[1:23:46] you know they shall lay their hands on
[1:23:48] the sick and the sick shall recover
[1:23:50] that that as long as you believe that
[1:23:52] that is for you
[1:23:55] it's not for pastor son so brother swan
[1:23:57] so deacon so and so
[1:23:59] preacher so and so no
[1:24:01] so he says
[1:24:02] that if you don't have them then you
[1:24:04] have not yet found you have to press on
[1:24:06] to get ahold of that so he says you'll
[1:24:08] find signs and wonders of him just
[1:24:10] exactly like he said it would be go back
[1:24:12] to where you phoned him go back to the
[1:24:14] beginning and he comes here he can say
[1:24:17] where did they find him
[1:24:19] where did they find jesus right where
[1:24:21] they left him where did they leave him
[1:24:23] the feast of pentecost where do we leave
[1:24:26] jesus
[1:24:27] where did they catch
[1:24:29] at the feast of pentecost when we get
[1:24:32] away from the old time pentecostal power
[1:24:36] and the feast of pentecost we walk away
[1:24:39] from jesus that's exactly right friend
[1:24:42] we are living under our privileges yes
[1:24:45] sir
[1:24:46] this woman realized she's living under
[1:24:48] her privileges because here she is in
[1:24:51] the night
[1:24:52] but the love is not there
[1:24:57] how can i be the bride of jesus
[1:24:59] and this is a time of darkness i need
[1:25:02] him more
[1:25:04] now than ever before
[1:25:06] my life is at stake
[1:25:08] my family's life is at stake
[1:25:11] my future is at stake
[1:25:14] i need him now
[1:25:18] how is it that he's not here
[1:25:21] i must put right whatever made him leave
[1:25:23] me
[1:25:26] i must create a conducive atmosphere for
[1:25:29] him to come back
[1:25:34] but what how will i create that i will
[1:25:37] have to die to myself
[1:25:39] because he's coming with the anointing
[1:25:41] of marr and frank since
[1:25:44] to share with me that anointment
[1:25:48] glory be to god so he says
[1:25:52] they left him and let me leave this he
[1:25:54] says
[1:25:55] so where is the joy of the lord
[1:25:59] where is the power of the lord the
[1:26:01] church asks today what what happened to
[1:26:04] the god of history he's waiting for his
[1:26:06] people to call him on the scene
[1:26:09] we can't do it through denominations we
[1:26:12] can't do it under psychology we can't do
[1:26:14] it under arithmetic we can't do it with
[1:26:17] education we separate ourselves we
[1:26:20] divide ourselves we are not
[1:26:22] divided we are one person indeed in
[1:26:24] christ jesus we are all one
[1:26:27] and then says our denomination is we
[1:26:29] never do it as good as they are they
[1:26:31] won't do it our education is the
[1:26:32] greatest hindrance that the gospel has
[1:26:35] ever had his education
[1:26:36] what we need is not education we need
[1:26:38] the power and demonstration of the holy
[1:26:40] ghost back in the church to demonstrate
[1:26:41] the power
[1:26:43] jesus never said go into the whole world
[1:26:45] and teach he never said go into the
[1:26:48] world and do you know he said go into
[1:26:51] the world and preach the gospel and the
[1:26:53] gospel is to demonstrate the power of
[1:26:55] the holy
[1:26:56] holy ghost
[1:26:58] the power of resurrection we are still a
[1:27:01] million miles short than where we should
[1:27:05] be
[1:27:06] why he's hiding millions hundreds of
[1:27:10] miles in the wilderness
[1:27:14] somebody has to go and find him
[1:27:19] and that's why when they asked him
[1:27:21] by what authority by what power do you
[1:27:23] do these things he puts them back he
[1:27:25] points them to john the baptist he says
[1:27:26] what the baptism of john what was it
[1:27:29] was it of man
[1:27:31] oh city of god
[1:27:33] if it was of god and you didn't receive
[1:27:35] it that's why you are asking where i
[1:27:36] come from what authority i have
[1:27:38] i'm just simply the manifestation of
[1:27:40] what he introduced and you people if he
[1:27:42] had received the tune as did the message
[1:27:44] that he brought you wouldn't be
[1:27:46] questioning who i am
[1:27:51] so now
[1:27:52] the ministry the glory the power the
[1:27:54] anointing that was with the messenger or
[1:27:57] in the days of the prophet becomes
[1:27:59] history to us and you say where is this
[1:28:02] where is this
[1:28:03] what is this and yet
[1:28:06] the prophet doesn't do
[1:28:10] what god is going to do
[1:28:12] he only reveals the secret of god
[1:28:16] god surely the lord god will do nothing
[1:28:21] but he reveals his secret to his
[1:28:23] servants the prophet so the prophet
[1:28:26] simply reveals what god is going to do
[1:28:30] so but he reveals this mystery to who
[1:28:33] behold i send you
[1:28:35] elijah who is the you
[1:28:38] are you in that number so that means
[1:28:40] whatever god revealed through this
[1:28:42] prophet that he's going to do he's going
[1:28:44] to do in the person who receives this
[1:28:47] message this revelation
[1:28:51] so he simply demonstrates
[1:28:56] what he's going to do he reveals it
[1:28:59] but there is more to do
[1:29:01] when god himself takes over
[1:29:04] when god finds the resting place
[1:29:07] okay now when you have found him
[1:29:10] then hold him tight
[1:29:16] glory to god i feel like reading
[1:29:18] something here in the book of john
[1:29:20] chapter one in the book of john chapter
[1:29:22] one
[1:29:23] you see he says here in verse 44 now
[1:29:26] philip was of besider the seat of andrew
[1:29:28] and peter and philip findeth nathanael
[1:29:31] and said unto him we have found him of
[1:29:34] whom moses in the law and the prophets
[1:29:36] did right jesus of nazareth the son of
[1:29:39] joseph
[1:29:41] a wilderness man jesus of nazareth
[1:29:44] nothing good coming out of what
[1:29:46] notherest
[1:29:48] the city of barrenness
[1:29:51] the seat of the poor they rejected
[1:29:54] when i was in israel in 2006 even our
[1:29:56] guide wouldn't want us to want to he
[1:29:59] wanted to want to lead us to that city
[1:30:01] because up to now
[1:30:03] it is a city of those with the debt the
[1:30:06] unsuccessful the cast
[1:30:11] blessed by the name of the lord
[1:30:13] and this man was not even wanting to go
[1:30:15] there
[1:30:16] but that's where jesus was
[1:30:19] in the place where many people don't
[1:30:21] want to go
[1:30:24] and it was called jesus of nazareth and
[1:30:27] you can see the triangle that blind is
[1:30:30] the educated
[1:30:31] the intellectual
[1:30:33] they were already living in others but
[1:30:35] when the time for marriage to deliver
[1:30:37] was about to come the census and
[1:30:39] taxation forces them to go back to their
[1:30:42] roots
[1:30:43] and she goes back to bethlehem to
[1:30:45] fulfill the scripture that this baby is
[1:30:47] to be born in bethlehem and then from
[1:30:49] bethlehem herald wants to kill and they
[1:30:51] flee to egypt
[1:30:53] and then from egypt back to nazareth so
[1:30:56] you look at that triangle
[1:30:59] from nazareth to bethlehem bethlehem
[1:31:01] egypt egypt
[1:31:03] now the rest
[1:31:04] so now it's blinding these people
[1:31:07] nothing no prophet can never come out of
[1:31:10] nazareth get it to us get it from us out
[1:31:13] of god in the arises no prophet
[1:31:17] saw this thing thunk sunk into the
[1:31:19] people's mindset they were like it is
[1:31:22] true it's written
[1:31:24] so it was blinding
[1:31:27] but that
[1:31:28] triangle was done on intention on
[1:31:31] purpose
[1:31:34] go from nazareth because you are not
[1:31:37] nazarenes but go
[1:31:39] and deliver in bethlehem according to
[1:31:41] the scripture
[1:31:43] then persuasion will arise and you hide
[1:31:45] in egypt then from egypt you'll come
[1:31:47] back to nazareth and the boy will grow
[1:31:49] up being called jesus of nazareth
[1:31:53] not jesus of bethlehem
[1:31:56] because if he was growing in bethlehem
[1:31:59] they would have said well maybe because
[1:32:01] this prince was supposed to come was
[1:32:02] supposed to be born in bethlehem but now
[1:32:04] they could search the scripture
[1:32:06] intellectually
[1:32:08] and find that he doesn't qualify
[1:32:12] but the messiah the messiahic signs were
[1:32:15] with him he fulfilled all of them and
[1:32:18] even challenged them he says search the
[1:32:20] scriptures
[1:32:22] you think in those scriptures you have
[1:32:24] eternal life but they even tell you who
[1:32:26] i am
[1:32:27] if you don't believe me for what you
[1:32:30] think i am believe me because of the
[1:32:32] works
[1:32:33] but they couldn't because they had their
[1:32:35] own evidence
[1:32:38] so that's why you today you should not
[1:32:40] even be surprised there are very many
[1:32:42] people who are finding it it's hard to
[1:32:45] you know to receive this message or even
[1:32:47] to you know become this message in the
[1:32:49] time of becoming the message
[1:32:52] because they begin to scrutinize the
[1:32:54] origin
[1:32:55] talk about
[1:32:57] brother branham of los angeles
[1:32:59] or new york
[1:33:01] but he was from indiana
[1:33:06] uh-huh jeffersonville
[1:33:12] what why
[1:33:15] to blind the people
[1:33:18] blessed be the name of the lord so we
[1:33:20] are looking at something here that i
[1:33:22] want us to follow slowly so when you
[1:33:24] find him
[1:33:27] hold him
[1:33:30] the bible says hold
[1:33:32] to that which is good
[1:33:35] that which has been given you don't lose
[1:33:38] it
[1:33:40] so
[1:33:42] this man
[1:33:44] he doesn't say
[1:33:46] i i presume we could have found a man
[1:33:49] that is like a prophet
[1:33:52] if you can come and you attend his
[1:33:54] services with me we shall sit down and
[1:33:56] compare our notes after the service and
[1:33:59] see
[1:34:00] whether he is the messiah or not
[1:34:04] the man is confessed he says we
[1:34:08] have found him
[1:34:11] and it's very positive to tell another
[1:34:13] even when he's around comes up with
[1:34:15] reasons and questions and he says
[1:34:18] i don't have time to explain him
[1:34:22] come and see
[1:34:26] in other words
[1:34:27] when you were that bride you was phoned
[1:34:29] him you were caucasus but you must have
[1:34:32] reality that these people who are
[1:34:35] argumentative will come and see
[1:34:41] if their ordained life like
[1:34:45] this man was this nathaniel
[1:34:48] the moment they'll come they said this
[1:34:50] is it
[1:34:51] regardless of all my former theology
[1:34:54] that they taught us he couldn't be from
[1:34:56] nazareth he couldn't be from galilee but
[1:34:59] i've seen reality i can confirm you
[1:35:02] people have found him and he ended up
[1:35:04] saying you are my god
[1:35:07] you are the messiah and so forth and
[1:35:09] jesus just because you have seen that
[1:35:11] you now believe you'll see much more
[1:35:14] you'll see much more
[1:35:16] blessed be the name of the lord so we
[1:35:18] have found him
[1:35:20] it's our standing today
[1:35:22] if you haven't
[1:35:23] then seek him in the wilderness
[1:35:26] but when we say we have phoned him
[1:35:29] then we are sure of what we are talking
[1:35:31] now i'm not looking for the truth
[1:35:33] friends
[1:35:34] i'm not looking for another message i'm
[1:35:36] not doubting this message
[1:35:39] i'm not here to tell anybody that i have
[1:35:41] to look for check this checklist nothing
[1:35:44] because like for me
[1:35:47] god led me supernaturally to this
[1:35:49] message and when i came to this message
[1:35:52] i have never found anything like it
[1:35:58] if there is a problem the problem is me
[1:36:02] the problem is not his message
[1:36:04] so we have found him we have found the
[1:36:06] truth we have found reality we are in
[1:36:09] the on the right ground
[1:36:13] but now when you find him
[1:36:15] you don't end just on saying i phoned
[1:36:17] him but you have to lead him to your
[1:36:20] mother's house
[1:36:22] that is the final
[1:36:24] resting place
[1:36:30] don't just say we've got the truth we've
[1:36:31] got the truth because even those who are
[1:36:33] falling from it they used to say we
[1:36:35] found the truth we have got it we know
[1:36:37] this is the truth this is it this is it
[1:36:39] this is it but time will come that will
[1:36:41] not say this is it this is it we have it
[1:36:44] but this is it
[1:36:46] this is it it is here
[1:36:48] i am it
[1:36:49] and it is me
[1:36:53] that's why i was saying sometimes
[1:36:56] when i when someone said brother have
[1:36:57] you seen this woman who says she's
[1:36:59] explaining why she left the message i
[1:37:01] said i don't even mean to listen to that
[1:37:04] they left the message because they got
[1:37:07] the message
[1:37:08] because they believed the message
[1:37:10] they were with the message
[1:37:12] but if they had become the message they
[1:37:15] would not leave the message
[1:37:17] you become it you are eat and that is it
[1:37:22] i said brother if i am received then i
[1:37:24] am comfortably deceived
[1:37:29] comfortably deceived
[1:37:31] but also on sure ground because show me
[1:37:34] a message that can bring word by word
[1:37:38] and put the message put the bible like
[1:37:40] this message show me any other preacher
[1:37:43] any other ministry that was vindicated
[1:37:46] beyond
[1:37:47] what this messenger was indicated these
[1:37:50] are a bunch of cowards
[1:37:52] show me
[1:37:53] let them do the disadvantage the
[1:37:55] prophecies and so forth they are hand
[1:37:57] picking a few gray areas
[1:38:00] what about the millions and millions
[1:38:02] that are untapped
[1:38:04] and as i like i said john the baptist
[1:38:06] the prophet said never even performed
[1:38:08] one miracle he didn't even heal one case
[1:38:11] he didn't even okay he was a prophet
[1:38:13] what prophecy did he
[1:38:14] give what prophecies apart from just
[1:38:17] connecting prophecy prophecy with
[1:38:19] reality what did he join the baptist do
[1:38:21] moreover his ministry was just six
[1:38:23] months
[1:38:28] six months
[1:38:29] so she tell him in the prophecies that
[1:38:30] he prophesied that came to pass tell me
[1:38:33] the miracles that he did and yet jesus
[1:38:35] says he's more of all that we're born of
[1:38:38] women there's no one greater than john
[1:38:39] the baptist so john the baptist was
[1:38:41] greater than moses rather than elijah
[1:38:43] greater
[1:38:44] greater than all those prophets
[1:38:47] with no miracle recorded to his credit
[1:38:51] and you talk about a ministry with
[1:38:53] millions of signs and wonders
[1:38:56] and then you am i so stupid to begin to
[1:38:59] doubt it just because some intellectual
[1:39:02] brain is pissing up some evidence
[1:39:05] against it
[1:39:07] come on we are not a badge of
[1:39:09] ignoramuses
[1:39:11] we are not idiots
[1:39:15] may that we believe this message by
[1:39:17] knowledge it's by revelation
[1:39:20] and revelation cannot be indoctrinated
[1:39:23] or brainwashed it's finished
[1:39:27] so
[1:39:28] this is the time we phoned him okay what
[1:39:30] did you do with him when you phoned him
[1:39:33] what did you do with the message when
[1:39:35] you found it what did you do with this
[1:39:38] who is this i have found him who is he
[1:39:41] he's jesus where is he he's here with me
[1:39:44] he is not supposed to be just there with
[1:39:47] you
[1:39:49] well he healed me this he gave me this
[1:39:52] he blessed me with this he did this he
[1:39:54] gave me this don't look for signs that
[1:39:57] is harlots
[1:39:58] those are daughters of jerusalem
[1:40:02] we are going to come to that
[1:40:04] the daughters of jerusalem want to wake
[1:40:07] him up out of the sleep that is out of
[1:40:10] the rest is resting in you by pointing
[1:40:12] to what they have interest in a man
[1:40:17] the daughters of jerusalem are like
[1:40:19] those girls who went with esther
[1:40:22] to king our swearers
[1:40:24] and they wanted gifts
[1:40:27] and because they asked for gifts they
[1:40:29] were given gifts
[1:40:30] but esther didn't ask for a gift she
[1:40:33] wanted a man
[1:40:35] because he knew when i get the man all
[1:40:37] that he has his mind
[1:40:41] but the hallows look for gifts
[1:40:44] as long as you have the money you give
[1:40:46] the gifts and the harlots will just you
[1:40:48] know swarm around you
[1:40:52] that's why this woman
[1:40:55] he didn't already say we have food i
[1:40:57] have phoned him
[1:41:00] but i held him
[1:41:02] tight glory to god
[1:41:05] and led him to my mother's house
[1:41:09] the final resting place
[1:41:12] and locked the doors
[1:41:13] and then he says shh
[1:41:16] this is now the seventh seal silence
[1:41:20] the invisible union of the bridal
[1:41:23] the bride and the bridegroom
[1:41:26] take away your nonsense i don't want to
[1:41:28] hear your noise
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:32] hallelujah
[1:41:33] i don't want noise
[1:41:36] i've suffered enough i've toiled enough
[1:41:39] i've looked for him i've phoned him i've
[1:41:41] brought him to my my mother's house
[1:41:43] which is this body is now here in the
[1:41:46] temple because this is the temp of the
[1:41:47] holocaust and the holocaust is my mother
[1:41:49] and i have brought him in my mother's
[1:41:51] house he is resting and when he rests i
[1:41:54] rest but how does he rest he rests by
[1:41:57] doing what i can't do
[1:41:59] he does what i can't he
[1:42:01] he he takes over my impossibilities and
[1:42:04] he makes them possible he takes over my
[1:42:06] thinking and begins to think for me the
[1:42:08] mind of christ is now the one in remy my
[1:42:11] mind is gone i don't have my own
[1:42:13] thoughts coming i don't have my own
[1:42:15] intentions coming he's here he's resting
[1:42:17] but he rests
[1:42:19] by doing what i can't do
[1:42:22] and how does he do i season he increases
[1:42:24] i die that's why he came with mar and
[1:42:27] frank says anointing for the dead he's
[1:42:30] coming to anoint me death
[1:42:32] confirming my death so that he lives in
[1:42:35] me
[1:42:40] and if i have accepted to die so that he
[1:42:43] lives who are you to disturb his peace
[1:42:49] and you know you women if you love your

[1:44:28] got jesus do you think you have got the
[1:44:30] truth do you think this message is true
[1:44:32] do you think this man really whom you
[1:44:34] think is a messenger was true please
[1:44:36] take away your noses
[1:44:38] i don't want nonsense yeah i don't want
[1:44:40] to hear your noses i don't hear i don't
[1:44:43] know what here knows
[1:44:44] my master is resting he's here
[1:44:49] glory to god
[1:44:51] let's go back to the bible go back the
[1:44:53] book of song of solomon
[1:44:57] he says
[1:44:58] i brought her him to the chain he
[1:45:00] brought her in the chamber of hearts
[1:45:02] that he conceived the okay verse five i
[1:45:04] charge you
[1:45:07] you daughters of jerusalem
[1:45:10] believe us
[1:45:14] i'm reminding you
[1:45:16] i'm telling you
[1:45:18] i charge you daughters of jerusalem
[1:45:20] you know those debtors of jerusalem
[1:45:22] according to isaiah chapter three
[1:45:24] they were walking tinkering and missing
[1:45:27] as they go on high heels and bungles and
[1:45:29] everything and
[1:45:31] the bible says because of the dot the
[1:45:33] daughters of jerusalem are haughty and
[1:45:36] big headed and those are disobedient
[1:45:39] brutes
[1:45:42] they claim they belong to zion they
[1:45:45] claim they belong to jerusalem and
[1:45:47] jerusalem means they set the seat of
[1:45:50] peace
[1:45:52] but they are not peace makers and peace
[1:45:55] promoters they are coming with noise
[1:46:00] so how would you claim to be a daughter
[1:46:01] of jerusalem
[1:46:04] when you are bringing noise
[1:46:06] when you are disturbing the peace
[1:46:10] of him who is resting in me
[1:46:14] how can you trouble my heart
[1:46:17] in other words i'm shouting my ears to
[1:46:19] any other voice i don't want any voice
[1:46:22] that troubles my heart i don't want to
[1:46:25] hear any statement any other person to
[1:46:28] sow any seed of this creep and say here
[1:46:31] this bed this room is sacred it belongs

[1:47:12] the believer he is the believer of

[1:48:19] which other revelation can be greater
[1:48:21] than this revelation the revelation of
[1:48:23] the revelator and the revelation himself
[1:48:26] is dweeting in me
[1:48:28] christ in you is the center of
[1:48:29] revelation

[1:48:37] you daughters of jerusalem this should
[1:48:39] be your message to the daughters of
[1:48:40] jerusalem
[1:48:44] they are trying to incite a reaction
[1:48:47] from you
[1:48:48] so that you begin to doubt the one that
[1:48:51] is already in you they are beginning to
[1:48:53] question if he is this why is it not
[1:48:55] this
[1:48:56] if he is the true one show me
[1:48:59] what gifts has he given you
[1:49:02] me i want a man who give me gifts
[1:49:07] show me the gifts that he has given you
[1:49:10] and i will prove he's the right man and
[1:49:12] this one says i'm not interested in
[1:49:13] gifts

[1:52:32] you're an unbeliever i will also live
[1:52:34] the word no no no no that's not the way
[1:52:36] to approach god
[1:52:41] god is not going to be forced like
[1:52:43] pentecostal hallowed you hear them
[1:52:45] saying
[1:52:46] i command fire from heaven now in the
[1:52:49] name of jesus i command your healing i
[1:52:51] come who is you to command
[1:52:54] commander who
[1:52:55] we only can command the devil command
[1:52:58] the spirit to leave not command the holy
[1:53:01] spirit
[1:53:02] how can you command your master
[1:53:06] his servant is never above
[1:53:09] his master
[1:53:12] how do you command your husband
[1:53:14] because you're an american woman
[1:53:17] that is the american spirit but we are
[1:53:18] not americans
[1:53:21] americans have died and rotten
[1:53:24] can someone say amen do that
[1:53:26] yes
[1:53:27] so you don't have to take a advantage of
[1:53:30] the american spirit
[1:53:33] you say you are now the boss
[1:53:35] if you play around i'll divorce you and
[1:53:36] when i divorce your ministry is done
[1:53:39] no
[1:53:41] just because you know what the bible
[1:53:42] says if you divorce him you don't use it
[1:53:45] as a beginning tool
[1:53:48] you don't take advantage of the bible to
[1:53:50] exploit
[1:53:52] a situation for your negative prophet i
[1:53:55] mean you know self-consciousness
[1:53:58] no
[1:54:00] this is not how we behave
[1:54:04] huh you know i you need me more than i
[1:54:06] need you who doesn't need the who
[1:54:12] he said i i was talking with one woman i
[1:54:14] said pastor you know what i think he
[1:54:16] needs me more than i need him i said but
[1:54:18] why did you travel all the way from your
[1:54:19] home to his home
[1:54:21] to his house
[1:54:23] you needed him how fast i can do without
[1:54:25] marriage the very first easy days that
[1:54:27] you can't stay without marriage that's
[1:54:29] why you're married
[1:54:33] that's why you married
[1:54:35] you married because you wanted to be
[1:54:37] married
[1:54:38] and now is the devil just bringing you
[1:54:39] you know some prestige in your mind i
[1:54:42] can't do without him fine you can do
[1:54:44] without him but limping it
[1:54:46] you'll not be normal you'll be abnormal
[1:54:51] [Music]
[1:54:54] okay what they call a new normal but a
[1:54:57] new number is abu numa
[1:55:00] so
[1:55:01] i charge you leave him let him do his
[1:55:03] things in his own time
[1:55:05] now he i have already talked about this
[1:55:09] now he comes here when you come to the
[1:55:11] final part in the book in verse seven he
[1:55:14] says behold his bed
[1:55:17] which is ceremonies
[1:55:19] fresco
[1:55:21] valiant men are around about it
[1:55:25] of the variants of israel
[1:55:29] they all hold swords
[1:55:32] being expat in the war
[1:55:35] not amateurs
[1:55:39] every man has his sword upon his side
[1:55:42] because of the fear
[1:55:44] in the night
[1:55:48] so there is a fear
[1:55:50] as the night goes into the day
[1:55:56] and everybody
[1:55:58] should protect
[1:55:59] so while men slept
[1:56:02] what does the bible say about us
[1:56:04] should we sleep with those who are
[1:56:06] sleeping
[1:56:07] no you are not going to be excused and
[1:56:10] say lord i slept because it was time
[1:56:12] that others are sleeping
[1:56:14] no
[1:56:15] because when you come i think it's in
[1:56:16] the book of first thessalonians
[1:56:18] something
[1:56:19] when you come to first thessalonians
[1:56:21] chapter 5
[1:56:24] first thessalonians chapter 5
[1:56:26] um
[1:56:27] here is what paul says
[1:56:30] um
[1:56:37] chapter five
[1:56:39] let's see here first thessalonians
[1:56:41] chapter 5 let's hear from verse
[1:56:44] 5 he says
[1:56:48] oh let's begin from verse 4 but he
[1:56:51] brethren
[1:56:52] are not in darkness
[1:56:59] that that day should overtake you as a
[1:57:02] thief
[1:57:04] you are all the children of light
[1:57:07] and the children of the day
[1:57:08] you are not of the night nor of darkness
[1:57:12] there are four let us not sleep
[1:57:20] as do others
[1:57:23] but let us watch and be sober for they
[1:57:26] that sleep sleep in the night and they
[1:57:29] that be drunken are drunken in the night
[1:57:32] but let us who are of the day be sober
[1:57:37] putting on the breastplate of faith now
[1:57:40] he's talking about arming yourself
[1:57:44] with a protective wear
[1:57:46] of faith
[1:57:49] and
[1:57:50] love
[1:57:52] if you don't love him whom you're going
[1:57:55] to stand for how will you protect it
[1:57:59] how will you
[1:58:01] defend it
[1:58:02] how will you fight to keep it
[1:58:06] you must be in love
[1:58:08] faith
[1:58:09] then laugh
[1:58:12] and he says and for any element the hope
[1:58:15] of salvation
[1:58:17] so we are not among those who slept
[1:58:21] while men slept
[1:58:24] the enemy came
[1:58:26] and sowed the seeds
[1:58:30] seeds of discrepancy
[1:58:35] they were not supposed to sleep there
[1:58:37] was supposed to be watchman over that
[1:58:39] watchman over that garden
[1:58:43] and now look
[1:58:45] let me take you to the
[1:58:46] practicalities of that story that woman
[1:58:50] was not supposed to keep
[1:58:52] her husband to defend him
[1:58:56] from the daughters of jerusalem had
[1:58:58] those watchmen been at their posts
[1:59:02] but because they are now they have left
[1:59:05] their guarding positions
[1:59:06] they are moving around
[1:59:09] she had to stand
[1:59:11] to defend this
[1:59:14] thank god we have men who are still
[1:59:17] defending
[1:59:19] and telling you the truth that this is
[1:59:22] the truth
[1:59:23] thank god we still have brother jason
[1:59:25] here
[1:59:26] but you know some of his good friends
[1:59:29] have gone
[1:59:30] in america and canada and europe in
[1:59:32] africa bacca there in here at home
[1:59:35] do you know that people are using money
[1:59:37] here taking advantage of african poverty
[1:59:41] buying preachers out of the message
[1:59:44] because they have left the message they
[1:59:46] are sending money there
[1:59:50] can imagine that kind of spirit
[1:59:53] if you think you are right leaving the
[1:59:55] message it has come to you why do you
[1:59:58] why don't you leave that person oh why
[2:00:00] don't you preach that to that person
[2:00:03] to get the revelation
[2:00:05] why is it that you are using your money
[2:00:08] to buy out someone from the message
[2:00:11] of course some of us cannot be bought
[2:00:13] out
[2:00:14] i don't care whether you gave me a
[2:00:15] million dollars
[2:00:18] you can't buy me out of this
[2:00:21] but there are those who are weaklings
[2:00:23] who don't know what they are up to and
[2:00:24] they are selling out and people are
[2:00:26] going on there in their churches they
[2:00:28] are tearing out all those images they
[2:00:30] are taking out message books and burning
[2:00:32] them and doing this and it's going on
[2:00:35] brothers we knew
[2:00:37] because somebody has given them what
[2:00:40] look at that spirit
[2:00:42] it's very serious than we think
[2:00:47] and we are not going to hold it with the
[2:00:48] kidney gloves
[2:00:51] let everyone be armed with a sword
[2:00:56] because the bed
[2:00:58] must be protected
[2:01:00] can you imagine that bed of king solomon
[2:01:02] who was the type of jesus
[2:01:05] was surrounded by
[2:01:07] 60
[2:01:08] variant men
[2:01:14] solomon had over 1 000 women which is
[2:01:16] the type of christ and the churches in
[2:01:17] different places but all those women
[2:01:20] could not have another man that's why
[2:01:21] those women had eunuchs keeping them
[2:01:26] but there was one particular place they
[2:01:28] would meet solomon and that place is
[2:01:30] surrounded
[2:01:32] protected
[2:01:34] no man can sneak him
[2:01:37] taking advantage of the men and women
[2:01:40] that solomon had but we thank god our
[2:01:42] solomon today
[2:01:44] is everywhere
[2:01:45] he's not like they had a physical
[2:01:47] solomon who was only with one woman but
[2:01:50] at a time this jesus is with every
[2:01:53] church he's on every part of it he's
[2:01:55] bringing the truth as long as you have
[2:01:58] got men with swords
[2:02:00] to protect the ground
[2:02:02] and you have to hold your sword this
[2:02:04] word is the word of revelation that that
[2:02:07] one that cuts and pierces into the
[2:02:09] thoughts of people and exposes
[2:02:13] this has to be protected
[2:02:16] we are not going to look at the devil
[2:02:18] just marauding around
[2:02:20] we have to take on the enemy
[2:02:23] and defend your ground the prophet says
[2:02:26] cannon
[2:02:27] and all the promises were the children
[2:02:30] of israel but they had to fight for
[2:02:32] every inch of it
[2:02:34] they had to to fight
[2:02:37] for every inch
[2:02:39] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:02:42] now i want us to continue here
[2:02:46] you know
[2:02:47] and
[2:02:51] he comes here
[2:02:54] he comes here in the message why christ
[2:02:56] speak he says god has got a purpose of
[2:03:00] you being here
[2:03:02] see
[2:03:04] if you can only be or get to that place
[2:03:08] that is recognizing the purpose of your
[2:03:10] being here
[2:03:12] he says how much trouble you save god
[2:03:15] and yourself to
[2:03:18] can you imagine serving god a lot of
[2:03:20] trouble
[2:03:22] of course we read where the prophet says
[2:03:24] god hides in the wilderness he's going
[2:03:27] in the wilderness because of the trouble
[2:03:29] that we put him into
[2:03:32] but if you can save god from this
[2:03:34] useless adult this trouble
[2:03:37] then that means that is the medicine of
[2:03:40] keeping him here
[2:03:43] you save him a lot of trouble
[2:03:47] you don't oh good do this lord what you
[2:03:50] know what to do
[2:03:56] i mean we are not going to ask god to
[2:03:59] smite people dead to throw them into
[2:04:01] trouble and so forth if they are the
[2:04:03] serpent's seed they have to be there
[2:04:10] we are going to know what to do
[2:04:14] make our lives
[2:04:17] this bodies
[2:04:19] this mother's house
[2:04:22] to be a resting place
[2:04:25] so that god doesn't have to hide the
[2:04:27] rest in the wilderness you've brought
[2:04:30] him from there
[2:04:32] and he's now resting here
[2:04:34] and nobody disturbs his peace
[2:04:38] you save god and yourself
[2:04:40] a lot of trouble when you know why you
[2:04:43] are here
[2:04:45] so the bed chamber
[2:04:47] let me finish here he says it must be
[2:04:50] guarded by valiant men
[2:04:55] glory be to god and there is no other
[2:04:58] man valiant more valiant
[2:05:00] than the life of christ himself
[2:05:02] expressing through you
[2:05:04] that is the variant of all men
[2:05:07] so you don't need physical men this time
[2:05:10] to keep your life not that the corners
[2:05:12] will make sure oh if who is who's that
[2:05:15] one talking to you if you don't talk to
[2:05:16] any man you should not do this hey
[2:05:19] you know this though shall not thou
[2:05:21] shalt not
[2:05:22] that age is gone
[2:05:24] it's now him in you
[2:05:27] taking full charge of you
[2:05:29] and you dying out all your reasoning
[2:05:34] and then he comes here the prophet says
[2:05:36] he's trying to say like he's bringing
[2:05:38] the type of the new testament he says
[2:05:40] the first beast was like a lion the
[2:05:41] second beast was a calf
[2:05:43] and that is a young cough and the third
[2:05:46] young ox and the third beast was the
[2:05:47] first of a man the fourth beast was a
[2:05:49] flying ego
[2:05:50] just exactly the tribes of israel camped
[2:05:52] around guarding they were afraid gods
[2:05:56] of the right
[2:05:57] to the ark
[2:05:59] oh hallelujah don't you see it here
[2:06:03] master city master city
[2:06:06] nothing could come anywhere around it
[2:06:09] without crossing those tribes crossing
[2:06:11] what the lion crossing the man that is
[2:06:14] the intelligence of the man crossing the
[2:06:17] ox crossing the ego the swiftness of it
[2:06:21] the heaven the earth in between all
[2:06:23] around you see they are way guards
[2:06:26] above it was the pill of fire brother
[2:06:29] nothing touched the master seat
[2:06:32] and he comes of course we know
[2:06:34] this beast in the new testament like
[2:06:37] matthew was the lion and mark was the ox
[2:06:40] and then we know luke was the
[2:06:42] intelligence of the man because he was a
[2:06:43] doctor and john was the flying ego
[2:06:47] they guarded the testimony
[2:06:50] of jesus christ
[2:06:51] whatever matthew did not write mark
[2:06:54] comes and fills the gap
[2:06:56] whatever marker doesn't bring in
[2:06:59] luke brings it
[2:07:00] whatever look who doesn't bring in john
[2:07:03] or this one confirms what this one has
[2:07:06] said and also repeats it to confirm that
[2:07:09] out of the witness of two or three let
[2:07:11] every word be established
[2:07:14] and then we have those spirits
[2:07:17] those four anointings upon us the
[2:07:19] boldness of a lion
[2:07:23] you know and the strength of the oaks
[2:07:27] and the wisdom the intelligence of a man
[2:07:30] and the revelation of an ego the vision
[2:07:33] in the church today
[2:07:35] to be embodied in you to protect
[2:07:38] the masses city because he is seated
[2:07:42] in you now
[2:07:44] glory be to god
[2:07:46] and he says all right
[2:07:48] and he comes here we now we are living
[2:07:51] in another age glory oh i love this age
[2:07:53] don't you now god has a master see today
[2:07:56] to be guarded
[2:07:59] you believe that where is the master
[2:08:01] seat found in the heart of a man
[2:08:04] where did it come in the heart in of
[2:08:07] heart of man in at the day of pentecost
[2:08:10] when the holy ghost which is god came
[2:08:12] into the shaman heart is that right now
[2:08:14] let's mark this down and get ready to
[2:08:17] draw it into okay he says
[2:08:20] all right guarding the master seat
[2:08:24] now has god got guards for the master
[2:08:27] seat today
[2:08:28] now that is a beautiful picture i mean
[2:08:32] that's watch how beautiful it's rolled
[2:08:34] out so god is also guarding
[2:08:37] this
[2:08:38] some guarding
[2:08:40] in press
[2:08:42] but
[2:08:44] how do you conduct him to come
[2:08:49] i want to finish by that
[2:08:53] because if you got the bible there are
[2:08:55] beautiful types there
[2:09:03] let me leave this
[2:09:06] when you go to the old testament i will
[2:09:08] just quote it you know the story
[2:09:12] where you realize
[2:09:14] somehow
[2:09:16] i mean um david when he was deposed
[2:09:20] from being a king he became the rejected
[2:09:22] king a fugitive
[2:09:27] but when he was to come back
[2:09:31] there was a general feeling among other
[2:09:33] people
[2:09:38] i mean let me read this in first second
[2:09:40] samuel chapter 19
[2:09:42] verse 9 and all the people were at
[2:09:44] strife throughout all the tribes of
[2:09:46] israel
[2:09:47] saying
[2:09:49] the king
[2:09:50] saved us
[2:09:52] out of the hand of our enemies
[2:09:54] and he delivered us out of the hand of
[2:09:57] the philistines and now he's flared out
[2:10:01] of the land for absalom
[2:10:04] absalom is today's judae's career
[2:10:08] that's why he's
[2:10:09] the second person to hang himself in the
[2:10:11] bible
[2:10:13] in the old testament
[2:10:15] to be hanged conditionally he didn't
[2:10:17] hang himself but he was hung
[2:10:19] just like he thought fell who betrayed
[2:10:21] jesus i mean he betrayed everything also
[2:10:24] hanged himself
[2:10:26] so you find
[2:10:28] he turned against his own father
[2:10:34] and deposed him
[2:10:39] now he says
[2:10:41] the absolute whom we anointed
[2:10:44] over us is dead in a battle
[2:10:48] now there are for why speak you not as
[2:10:52] not a word of bringing the king back
[2:10:58] and the king david said to zadok and to
[2:11:00] a beast of the priest saying speak unto
[2:11:03] the elders of judah saying why are you
[2:11:06] the last to bring the king back to his
[2:11:08] house seeing the speech of all israel is
[2:11:12] come to the king even to his house
[2:11:15] you are my brethren
[2:11:17] you are my bones and my flesh
[2:11:21] wherefore then are you the last to bring
[2:11:24] back the king
[2:11:28] so the king can run away by himself
[2:11:31] although he went with people
[2:11:33] but he cannot come by himself
[2:11:37] he has to be conducted back
[2:11:44] why should you be the last one to invite
[2:11:47] your king back
[2:11:51] you are the only born of his bones
[2:11:54] and flesh of his flesh
[2:11:56] you are him
[2:11:58] the bride is him
[2:12:01] you should never be the last
[2:12:06] to become the tabernacle
[2:12:08] of the king
[2:12:10] don't wait that you come the last the
[2:12:12] last is always not the right position
[2:12:14] for me
[2:12:15] and the question is even the king would
[2:12:18] have come back but he says
[2:12:20] why are some of my friends the last to
[2:12:22] speak
[2:12:24] about my coming back
[2:12:27] i want to come back but i want to be
[2:12:29] invited back i want to be conducted back
[2:12:33] led back
[2:12:34] to my house
[2:12:38] so they had to go hundreds and thousands
[2:12:42] of people to lead the king david
[2:12:45] back
[2:12:46] to the palace
[2:12:49] and they would read him how how do we
[2:12:52] lead our jesus back
[2:12:55] you can only go to him invite him by
[2:12:58] repentance
[2:12:59] by dedication
[2:13:01] by devotion
[2:13:02] by worship
[2:13:04] by praise
[2:13:07] conduct him back into his house
[2:13:12] why should you be the last
[2:13:14] one and yet we sing the song
[2:13:18] while
[2:13:19] on others thou art
[2:13:22] smile
[2:13:23] eileen
[2:13:26] do
[2:13:27] not pass smee
[2:13:30] bar
[2:13:32] why should he smile on others
[2:13:35] why should he see others feel others
[2:13:39] transform others
[2:13:42] in the where others and not you
[2:13:46] you have to conduct him back
[2:13:49] like that woman went
[2:13:51] and met him
[2:13:53] and held him and led him
[2:13:56] to the mother's house
[2:13:59] who don't you want to conduct him into
[2:14:01] the house today
[2:14:03] that is the question
[2:14:06] how many want him back
[2:14:08] if her tori is out
[2:14:11] and the prophet says if it is be filled
[2:14:13] and be refilled and refilled don't even
[2:14:16] say well it's not history well i was
[2:14:19] filled with the holy spirit in 2010
[2:14:23] it was the march of in the month of
[2:14:25] march in the day of 17th that is history
[2:14:32] you have to be refueled until the
[2:14:33] prophet says until every five of you
[2:14:38] is filled with the holy spirit
[2:14:41] that's the challenge friends
[2:14:43] until you are soaked up of him
[2:14:46] until he becomes you and you become
[2:14:49] nothing
[2:14:51] that's the challenge
[2:14:53] may god bless you
[2:14:54] let's stand up
[2:15:04] we are going to have a word of prayer
[2:15:11] and maybe our friends can pray for us
[2:15:13] past me not agent or savior we know how
[2:15:16] to do that
[2:15:18] and as that song is going on
[2:15:22] you would speak to him in your heart and
[2:15:24] say lord
[2:15:25] i want to conduct
[2:15:27] you your fullness the person
[2:15:30] of christ
[2:15:33] that you may indulge me
[2:15:36] lord i can't pass through this night
[2:15:38] alone
[2:15:40] i can't enjoy living this life alone
[2:15:44] i know i was not made to be that way
[2:15:49] this is just the temple
[2:15:51] of the person of jesus christ
[2:16:00] so maybe the song that can lead us
[2:16:03] in that song as we pray
[2:16:14] [Music]
[2:16:23] [Music]
[2:16:29] my heart
[2:16:37] [Music]

[2:17:47] [Music]
[2:17:54] well we can hold it there we are just

[2:18:03] my friends just lift up your hand
[2:18:06] and believe in your heart as we pray
[2:18:09] lord jesus
[2:18:11] water time what a challenge that
[2:18:14] is before us this day
[2:18:17] that we have to get you
[2:18:19] from the wilderness
[2:18:22] that when the question again is asked
[2:18:24] what went he out in the wilderness to
[2:18:26] receive
[2:18:28] we would have the right answer
[2:18:31] we went to receive him we went to
[2:18:33] conduct him
[2:18:35] back
[2:18:36] to our mother's house
[2:18:38] to the temples of the holy spirit
[2:18:41] that the person of christ would dwell
[2:18:44] not only should he dwell
[2:18:47] but we should hold our swords
[2:18:50] and not even us holding
[2:18:52] but him in us is our armor
[2:18:55] him in us will take care of himself
[2:18:58] but we have to be on the lookout
[2:19:00] for our anniversary
[2:19:02] the devil
[2:19:04] moves out
[2:19:05] looking for him he may divide
[2:19:08] and lord we have seen many
[2:19:10] different

[2:19:37] maybe they need a refeeling
[2:19:39] maybe they need a confirmation that you
[2:19:42] are in
[2:19:43] maybe lord
