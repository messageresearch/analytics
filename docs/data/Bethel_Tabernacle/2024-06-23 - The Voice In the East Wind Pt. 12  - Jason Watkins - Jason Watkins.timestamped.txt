[41:07] seven so I've just quit saying it amen

[41:11] as I feel the burden in that frame of
[41:13] thought the voice in the East Wind amen
[41:17] we want to um give you an
[41:20] update
[41:22] um so sister Deborah and brother Travis
[41:25] are in the hospital now for the delivery
[41:28] of uh baby miles oh I didn't know we had
[41:31] a name praise the Lord be praying all
[41:33] goes well amen be praying the baby comes
[41:37] soon amen praise the lord we sure will
[41:40] do that more than one way to build a
[41:44] church amen so we're happy in the Lord
[41:48] for them trusting that the Lord will
[41:51] just bless that as he always has amen
[41:54] Genesis chapter 1
[42:05] let's read verses 1 through
[42:11] five in the beginning God created the
[42:14] Heaven and the
[42:16] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[42:20] void Darkness was upon the face of the
[42:23] deep and the spirit of God moved upon on
[42:27] the face of the
[42:28] waters and God said so God is really
[42:31] busy here and God said let there be
[42:34] light and there was
[42:37] light and God saw the light that it was
[42:40] good and God divided the light from the
[42:44] darkness and God called the light day
[42:48] and the Darkness he called night it's
[42:51] interesting to me that after he called
[42:55] it good he still had quite a bit of work
[42:58] to
[42:59] do man he created it it came right it
[43:04] was a it was a completely a product 100%
[43:07] of his spoken word as Paul taught us he
[43:11] created it out of nothing he just spoke
[43:14] it and his creative word went to work
[43:18] and created it but yet even when he
[43:21] created it he created it it came from
[43:23] him and he said it was good and then he
[43:26] still had work to to do amen right and
[43:30] God called the light day and the
[43:31] Darkness he called night and the evening
[43:34] and the morning or the first day and
[43:39] verse goes down through Day 2 3 4 5 and
[43:42] six verse
[43:47] 31 and God saw everything that he had
[43:50] made and behold it was very good and the
[43:54] evening and the morning were the sixth
[43:58] day chapter 2 verse1 thus the heavens
[44:01] and the Earth were finished and all the
[44:04] host of them and on the seventh day God
[44:08] ended his work which he had made and he
[44:11] rested on the seventh day from all his
[44:14] work which he had made and God blessed
[44:17] the seventh day and Sanctified it
[44:21] because that in it he had rested from
[44:24] all his work which God created and made
[44:28] let's pray father we thank you for your
[44:31] word today and Lord I'm so
[44:34] grateful to you Lord that you came on
[44:38] the scene when I needed you father to
[44:40] try to settle my mind so much to say but
[44:44] uh we have a a finite amount of time to
[44:46] say it in so Lord we just want to be
[44:49] very proficient and very studious and we
[44:51] want to say everything that you once
[44:53] said and I want to have it in the order
[44:56] and Lord in my own mind it seemed just
[44:59] everywhere and large and more than I
[45:01] could say and but Lord you just came on
[45:04] the scene I'm so grateful you just
[45:06] settled me down you began to speak to me
[45:09] you begin to line it out for me so today
[45:12] Lord I just stand here with such a peace
[45:14] in my heart such a confidence in you so
[45:17] now Lord I'm just here as your assistant
[45:20] you know that's all I am just your
[45:22] assistant they sang a song I followed
[45:24] you out here Lord that's all I know so
[45:27] here we go Lord I give it into your
[45:29] hands completely in Jesus name amen God
[45:33] bless you friends you can have your
[45:43] seats when we left off last time in the
[45:49] 11th
[45:51] installment we found a lamb coming
[45:55] forward from eternity
[45:57] from the eternities as brother brandham
[45:59] said to claim The Book of Life to open
[46:03] it to loose the Seven Seals thereof the
[46:05] same seals that that Christ had sealed
[46:10] the word the word of God and the Mystery
[46:12] of God the mystery of Christ had been
[46:15] sealed once the church began to fall
[46:18] away from her first love she began to
[46:21] backslide she began to Trend downward
[46:24] and the apostles are going off the scene
[46:27] the gnostics are already invading the
[46:29] pull pits and the churches and uh the
[46:31] the apostles that are Left Alive are
[46:33] writing urgent letters we need to
[46:35] earnestly contend for the faith once
[46:37] delivered to the Saints you know where
[46:40] they they start talking about this one
[46:41] and this judaizer and this one that
[46:43] doesn't receive John anymore and John's
[46:45] going to have to go try to deal with
[46:47] this and they've got Paul and they
[46:49] execute him they put John on patmas and
[46:53] and we find that you know by the time
[46:56] John comes back uh is that we find that
[47:00] you the word now is is is showing that
[47:03] it's got a seal on it and and from there
[47:06] by the time you get past irenius brother
[47:09] brandham said he's actually the last one
[47:12] that even had a clear understanding of
[47:14] the godhead and that's a Paramount
[47:17] Doctrine because if you can't really
[47:20] understand clearly by the word of God
[47:23] the relationship that Jesus as a man had
[47:26] to the father which was a spirit and if
[47:28] you can't understand that relationship
[47:30] then you'll never fully understand your
[47:33] relationship and your part in the
[47:35] godhead because brother brandham shows
[47:38] how that the bride is actually part of
[47:40] by expression by expression uh she's not
[47:44] a worshiped being but by an unfolding
[47:47] expression every son and daughter of God
[47:49] are a part of God's continuing godhead
[47:52] so the godhead then becomes more than
[47:54] just I he one is he two is he three you
[47:57] actually are seeing that the plan of God
[47:59] using the Plan of Redemption is going to
[48:02] have an entire Kingdom of saints of
[48:05] Kings and Priests and that and that and
[48:08] the increase of that Kingdom throughout
[48:10] all the ceaseless ages through the
[48:13] eternities unfolding by the uh by the
[48:17] hidden Mana the future hidden Mana that
[48:20] Kingdom of Christ will never cease
[48:23] increasing hallelujah amen so we're
[48:26] headed for something friends I'm here to
[48:28] tell you you haven't believed cunningly
[48:31] devised tales and these are not fables
[48:34] there are fables in the in the world and
[48:36] thank God because he knew we could he
[48:40] could never get us home on man-made
[48:42] fables so he comes in this day and he
[48:46] steps out of the eternities and he takes
[48:48] the book and he looses the Seven Seals
[48:50] to restore back the faith of the fathers
[48:54] by restoring back the original word
[48:57] there's only that's the only way you can
[48:59] have the original faith of the fathers
[49:02] was to have the original word because
[49:04] faith comes by hearing the
[49:06] word so we thank the Lord for this
[49:10] whereas he he could not come and instead
[49:12] of being able to come and receive a
[49:14] bride which he was entitled to do by the
[49:17] time he brother B says by the time he
[49:20] he's ready she's already polluted she's
[49:23] already uh you know married she's
[49:25] already in adultery and the the the Nan
[49:29] Council has already happened and so
[49:30] instead of being able to take a bride
[49:33] home in a Rapture Christ must sit back
[49:36] down in the eternities intercede over
[49:39] over 2,000 years intercede for ignorance
[49:42] see and we we showed you last time that
[49:45] and I and I asked it to you like this
[49:47] where else would he be interceding from
[49:50] John had not noticed him cuz he had been
[49:53] back there interceding he's looking for
[49:55] a lamb and a and he sees a lamb and so
[49:58] we find that he didn't see him brother
[50:01] brandham said he hadn't noticed him
[50:02] because he had been back there
[50:04] interceding in the eternities and I I
[50:06] just POS the question to you where do
[50:09] you imagine that he would be interceding
[50:12] for you in the eternities because it is
[50:15] in the eternities that he beholds you it
[50:19] is in the eternities where you began
[50:21] with him so in that regard you didn't
[50:25] actually you might have had a a birth
[50:27] date here on this world but before there
[50:31] was ever a this world you existed in the
[50:33] mind of
[50:36] God we were we were in the elected son
[50:39] as I've said to you many times it's it's
[50:42] not a doctrine of elitism that's a false
[50:46] charge that they charge the the redeemed
[50:49] of the Lord with to say oh you you talk
[50:52] about predestination and you talk about
[50:53] election and it's just elitism you think
[50:56] you're a you think you're a super race
[50:58] well I know he's a super race and I know
[51:02] that according to Isaiah 42 there's only
[51:05] one elected son and that's Christ well
[51:08] then how did you and I get elected
[51:10] because we were in
[51:12] him I was in Christ before the
[51:15] foundation of the world so when he Steps
[51:18] From the eternities in this day in this
[51:20] end time he's coming to claim the book
[51:24] he's coming to to bring to pass his
[51:28] vision of you and I he's always had a
[51:31] vision of you yes amen and we were
[51:34] showing you last time that your life has
[51:37] really been uh an unfolding drama of
[51:42] God allowing you to come in under a sin
[51:46] birth but watching you your whole life
[51:49] with a plan and a vision that couldn't
[51:51] be interrupted couldn't be redacted
[51:53] couldn't be changed couldn't be altered
[51:55] not enough Devil's in hell to change the
[51:57] vision even you can't change it and then
[52:01] he just kept following you and kept
[52:02] following you until the time appointed
[52:04] of the father and then it I don't know
[52:06] whether he brought you in a church or
[52:08] whether he drugg you out of a bar or
[52:10] whether he knocked you on your back or
[52:12] whatever he had to do but he made you
[52:15] look up and when you look up you heard
[52:18] an eagle scream Hallelujah and something
[52:20] echoed like a deep you couldn't you
[52:22] couldn't explain it fully nobody else
[52:25] quite heard it but but you heard
[52:27] it Hallelujah I'm here to tell you
[52:30] that's the same Jehovah that dwelt in
[52:32] the
[52:33] eternities so it was a voice that was
[52:36] inexplicably familiar to
[52:43] you he's coming here why did he come as
[52:46] we've said it's not just to increase
[52:48] your theology it's to have a
[52:51] relationship it's to know you in
[52:53] Redemption yes amen but it's to bring
[52:55] you to the Vision he had of you before
[52:58] the foundation of the world and so this
[53:02] is this should be always great news amen
[53:06] but unfortunately sometimes I've had to
[53:09] sit across in counseling with somebody
[53:12] whose life is absolutely
[53:15] devastated smashed and laying in
[53:20] pieces and and the whole reason is is
[53:23] because God had a vision of them and he
[53:25] won't let them
[53:29] go I just say Lord smash whatever you
[53:33] have to smash in my life rip tear burn
[53:37] pluck I don't care what it takes if I
[53:40] won't give it up take it from
[53:47] me so we find then that that
[53:51] power that comes to redeem you and I
[53:54] want to really make this connection
[53:57] today the power that redeems you and
[54:00] does all of that that we're talking
[54:03] about is the same power in Genesis amen
[54:07] that's Genesis power that chased you
[54:10] Genesis power that did whatever it had
[54:12] to do to get you it's Genesis power
[54:14] that's holding you it's Genesis power
[54:17] that's going to deliver
[54:19] you you say why do you call it Genesis
[54:22] power because the whole plan is to bring
[54:24] you back to this perfect time
[54:27] where God can look over the whole world
[54:29] with you in it and say it's good it's
[54:34] very
[54:37] good so that power is found in the same
[54:41] way in the same place and in the same
[54:43] way it's God's spoken word of command I
[54:47] don't have time to go into it today
[54:49] brother brandham dealt with it quite a
[54:51] bit and there is a man here who can turn
[54:53] on the light it's a great sermon you
[54:54] should go hear it where brother brandham
[54:57] describes the new birth using nature how
[55:00] that the Earth was there and the sun was
[55:02] there and the seed was in it but there
[55:04] was a Darkness between the light of the
[55:06] sun and the seed buried underwater so
[55:09] what does God do first thing he does is
[55:11] he starts causing the land to appear
[55:13] he's got a
[55:14] plan see and he he's got a light and and
[55:19] and and now he he's actually C he's
[55:21] going to cause light to strike seed and
[55:25] that's why that's why when we look at
[55:27] verse one in the beginning God created
[55:29] the heavens and the Earth period that's
[55:31] it that's all he says so I I realize
[55:35] that when you read the days it looks
[55:37] like well on this day he did this to the
[55:40] light and on this day but in the very
[55:43] first sentence in the beginning God
[55:45] created the heavens and the Earth the
[55:47] Sun is already there amen the Earth is
[55:50] already there every seed that it'll ever
[55:53] have is already there but now he's got
[55:55] some work to do you see you came into
[55:59] this world with a gene of God but in
[56:02] between the light of God's word and your
[56:05] Gene there was a dark shadow called a
[56:09] fallen nature and so the same word that
[56:12] spoke here and said let there be light I
[56:15] command it and what did that do that
[56:17] separated the Darkness and Light come
[56:19] through and he he brought the dry land
[56:21] so it could strike seed God was working
[56:24] I'm here to tell you you became a
[56:25] believer because God was
[56:28] working it's all Grace it's all on him
[56:31] as I said at the beginning you owe him
[56:35] everything how would we not give him our
[56:37] whole heart and mind how would we not
[56:40] worship Him how would we not lift his
[56:42] name in
[56:43] Praises how would we not have a prayer
[56:46] life that seeks to commune with this
[56:47] being who's done so much and seeks to do
[56:51] so much
[56:52] more so you can see then why Satan's t
[56:56] itic is to always you know always to
[56:58] interfere with that connection always
[57:01] filling up your life with with a really
[57:03] super complicated scientific word hard
[57:06] to pronounce um it's it's ancient and I
[57:10] and and I use it on purpose Satan fills
[57:12] up your life with
[57:17] stuff I just say what is that it's yeah
[57:20] it's everything it just covers it all
[57:23] you say well can be more specific I can
[57:26] anything that hinders you talking to him
[57:29] anything that hinders you being here
[57:31] anything that hinders you letting your
[57:33] light shine or the token be on display
[57:35] that stuff the devil has allow has
[57:38] talked you into having that interferes
[57:42] with the Lord's Vision in your life and
[57:45] you will never know the joy and peace
[57:47] that you know exists you know it's there
[57:49] you know it exists it's always like a
[57:51] carrot just out ahead of you you know
[57:53] it's there but I'm here to tell you as
[57:55] long as you value that stuff more than
[57:57] you value what's on the other side of
[57:59] that it'll just stay there see this is
[58:03] the part of overcoming that's your part
[58:05] yes amen see he did the part you
[58:08] couldn't do you couldn't save yourself
[58:09] you couldn't bring light to the seed you
[58:11] couldn't annihilate your old nature you
[58:14] were born with it stuck with it you were
[58:16] as brother Donnie says chained to a dead
[58:17] man amen amen but God rich in Mercy see
[58:22] loved us and and and did that for you
[58:24] now it's up to you to unpack you don't
[58:27] say I need to pack up not to go to
[58:29] heaven to go in the Rapture Prophet said
[58:31] it's time to unpack need to unpack
[58:34] things that are hindering you unpack
[58:36] things that are limiting your
[58:38] spirituality unpack
[58:41] them
[58:43] so we find then that it's that same word
[58:46] of command that annihilated that thick
[58:50] darkness and allowed the sun to strike
[58:52] the seed whatever day that it looks like
[58:54] it was created that's just God working
[58:56] on what he's already done he's
[58:58] developing it he's developing you I I
[59:01] don't know what
[59:03] day you know there's no one in here
[59:05] except maybe some of my family that I
[59:07] know their birthday see but but but the
[59:12] real brother brandham talks about three
[59:15] birthdays that you've got a Earthly
[59:17] birthday you've got a new birth birthday
[59:20] and you've got a Rapture Day where you
[59:22] get a glorified
[59:24] body I I I had number one now I've got
[59:28] I'm enjoying the second stage and I'm
[59:30] looking for the third Hallelujah I'm
[59:32] looking to blast off I'm I'm thoroughly
[59:34] done with this
[59:37] one so so we find then that it's the
[59:40] same spoken word of God's spoken word of
[59:43] command brother brandham deals with that
[59:45] as I said and there is a man here that
[59:47] can turn on the light he really lays out
[59:49] the new birth
[59:51] properly so this new birth then brings
[59:54] with it its new nature it's your
[59:56] original nature which had been dormant
[59:58] it was in seed form it was there but it
[1:00:01] was dormant it had no efficacy it had no
[1:00:03] influence on you but but as I said at a
[1:00:07] time appointed of the Father the voice
[1:00:10] of God spoke to you and commanded the
[1:00:13] darkness in you see and so now that
[1:00:17] annihilated the old nature and allowed
[1:00:20] the the life that was in the seed to
[1:00:23] come forth and you're a Christian amen
[1:00:25] see you're real one you're not just one
[1:00:28] where the spirit of God has anointed
[1:00:30] your flesh or your spirit which are no
[1:00:33] matter what he would do I mean he could
[1:00:34] come down and literally put his hands on
[1:00:37] your flesh it would still keep it would
[1:00:40] still be
[1:00:42] sinful you understand you can come up
[1:00:45] under his anointing and on a platform
[1:00:48] and it'll drive Demons of disease out of
[1:00:50] you until you get outside and they'll
[1:00:52] come right back you see because this
[1:00:55] body is is dying it's of the earth it
[1:00:58] still has sin in it the only way that
[1:01:00] you'll ever get a body that doesn't have
[1:01:02] any sin is you got to have a a glorified
[1:01:05] body like under his glorious
[1:01:08] body so the nature of sin remains in the
[1:01:12] flesh and the spirit but now your spirit
[1:01:15] is Under New Management can I say it
[1:01:17] like that there's a new owner with a
[1:01:19] different Vision a different nature that
[1:01:22] comes from above this new nature now has
[1:01:26] a direct access to your still Fallen
[1:01:29] flesh see your still Fallen Spirit I'm
[1:01:34] here to tell you I I I love every one of
[1:01:36] you you're all my sweetie pies but
[1:01:39] you're you're you're without the Holy
[1:01:42] Spirit there's nothing good about
[1:01:46] you there's only one good and that's
[1:01:50] God see and so without the Holy Ghost a
[1:01:54] man is just a brute beast that's all he
[1:01:56] is he he's just a he's a fallen he was
[1:01:58] built in the image of God built to be an
[1:02:00] amateur God but he's just a brute animal
[1:02:03] see and so so we find that that this new
[1:02:07] nature of course it has a direct access
[1:02:11] to this Fallen flesh and Fallen Spirit
[1:02:14] where your memory and your reason and
[1:02:16] your conscience and your affections and
[1:02:18] your imaginations are still under a sin
[1:02:21] under the law of sin and death see so
[1:02:24] this the but fortunately by the new
[1:02:26] birth you're under a new management
[1:02:28] you've got a new nature and now Begins
[1:02:30] the greatest battle ever
[1:02:32] fought see now you're where Paul talks
[1:02:36] about in Romans 7 to will is present
[1:02:38] with me where where did you get the will
[1:02:41] to do God's Will from your
[1:02:43] soul be because the I've had a new
[1:02:46] nature
[1:02:47] change and so so Paul says to will is
[1:02:51] present with me but the problem is I
[1:02:53] still got problems going on in my flesh
[1:02:55] and so there's a battle there constantly
[1:02:58] and that's the greatest battle ever
[1:02:59] fought all right so I can't get bogged
[1:03:02] down into that in that today I want to
[1:03:04] keep moving now don't worry I'll revisit
[1:03:07] it in further Parts because we're going
[1:03:09] to continue to to to look at it so this
[1:03:13] is this is
[1:03:15] precisely why only the we say the
[1:03:20] message of the hour well it's really
[1:03:22] broader than that the message of any
[1:03:24] hour only the message of any hour you
[1:03:27] say well what is the message of any hour
[1:03:29] it's the message that Christ anoints for
[1:03:32] that day and there's only one of them
[1:03:35] and it's not varied and it's not
[1:03:37] multiple choice and it's not up for
[1:03:38] debate he sends an angel he sends a star
[1:03:42] a a a seal partially opens a mystery
[1:03:44] drops a messenger catch it and runs with
[1:03:46] it it gathers a bride around
[1:03:49] him
[1:03:51] abc123 amen it's not rocket science see
[1:03:54] and so only the message of any hour has
[1:03:58] the ability to fully accomplish
[1:04:01] redemption in the individual that that's
[1:04:03] that that that's the very reason that
[1:04:05] that's true is because the only Power of
[1:04:09] creation is the spoken word Satan cannot
[1:04:12] create amen understand so that if you
[1:04:15] want if you want Zoe life you've got to
[1:04:18] have you've got to have the very essence
[1:04:21] of Zoe himself see that comes down and
[1:04:24] and brings forth a part that he placed
[1:04:27] in you as a as a child sister Deborah is
[1:04:29] about to bring a child into the world
[1:04:32] and there's a little angel and and and
[1:04:35] and that's that's there right when it's
[1:04:37] ready to take that body but down but
[1:04:39] brother Brenham teaches us how that God
[1:04:41] takes a little deposit of himself slips
[1:04:43] it inside and so when that baby becomes
[1:04:46] a living Soul it has a dormant seed of
[1:04:49] God's life in it see and the the only
[1:04:52] way that can ever come to life is the
[1:04:55] message of any hour of whatever hour
[1:04:58] you're in that message comes across you
[1:05:00] and you hear you recognize and you begin
[1:05:03] to act on the word of God and that is
[1:05:06] what brings the new birth and I'm here
[1:05:08] to tell you that is what has always
[1:05:10] brought the new birth since the days of
[1:05:13] the Holy Ghost that's always what
[1:05:15] brought the new birth I could just I
[1:05:17] could stop right here and just go to
[1:05:19] scripture after scripture after
[1:05:21] scripture after scripture the apostles
[1:05:23] taught it unequivocally that you're Born
[1:05:26] Again by the revelation of the word to
[1:05:29] you personally
[1:05:33] Hallelujah so so that it's it's why it
[1:05:37] has to be the message of any hour and
[1:05:39] and because the spoken word of God is
[1:05:42] the original seed of life and all
[1:05:44] creation I read it for you in our
[1:05:45] opening text so so I mean think about it
[1:05:49] friends how else do you imagine God
[1:05:51] would have a kingdom where everybody are
[1:05:53] Saints amen amen we're a whole Kingdom
[1:05:58] and everybody's got the nature that
[1:06:00] Jesus
[1:06:01] had how you suppose that's going to
[1:06:03] happen if it's not for the creative
[1:06:05] power of God's
[1:06:07] word because people will decide to do
[1:06:10] [Music]
[1:06:12] better you know humanity is just going
[1:06:15] to collectively determine to become
[1:06:17] better
[1:06:19] people they they've thought that forever
[1:06:23] John Lennon thought all we need is love
[1:06:24] he's wrong
[1:06:27] now if he hadd been talking about the
[1:06:28] right love he'd have been right but he
[1:06:31] had no Revelation because he thought
[1:06:33] love was a a thing or an emotion but he
[1:06:36] didn't know love was a
[1:06:41] person and so you've got to have a
[1:06:44] change to your nature this is where we
[1:06:46] were talking about you know last time uh
[1:06:49] uh cycles and and patterns that are in
[1:06:52] our life and things that come down to us
[1:06:54] through the grab bag of life and and
[1:06:56] their you know heredity and different
[1:06:58] things and how you came and
[1:07:00] characteristics and you know your
[1:07:02] temperament and your zodiac and your
[1:07:04] raising and your what the ministry you
[1:07:06] sit under all of these things you you
[1:07:09] become the sum collection of everything
[1:07:11] you've
[1:07:12] experienced by the time God finds you
[1:07:15] you are a messed up
[1:07:18] individual that's why the best thing for
[1:07:21] you to do is stop drop and roll you're
[1:07:23] on fire and he's trying to help you quit
[1:07:25] trying to tell him how to do it just do
[1:07:28] what he says and I promise you'll get to
[1:07:30] a new
[1:07:32] birth and so you know so we have these
[1:07:36] things you know these Cycles in life and
[1:07:39] and they repeat their their they don't
[1:07:41] respect persons I mean I I remember
[1:07:44] hearing years ago when brother gidon
[1:07:46] retif was preaching on Breaking the
[1:07:47] cycle and he said it like this and you
[1:07:49] could hear thetion in his voice he said
[1:07:51] it slow he was careful and he was there
[1:07:55] in at at bible way and he said I'm just
[1:07:57] going to say this he said I hope it
[1:07:59] doesn't offend you he said but if
[1:08:02] brother Bram had not received the
[1:08:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost then he would
[1:08:08] have been a
[1:08:12] brandom see and what how did Brother
[1:08:16] Bram describe the Brams they were
[1:08:19] Fighters they were drunkards they would
[1:08:22] knife you in a second many of them died
[1:08:25] with their boots on see they were
[1:08:28] Mountain folk who were no nonsense and
[1:08:30] and and and defended their own to the
[1:08:33] death and and you and you know and if
[1:08:35] you if they would fight out in the
[1:08:36] backyard but if you caught one of them
[1:08:38] in the front yard and tried to get in a
[1:08:40] fight with him brother brandham said
[1:08:41] Brams would come from everywhere you had
[1:08:43] to fight the whole family so they they
[1:08:45] were they were a rough cob people and
[1:08:49] you know you remember when brother
[1:08:50] brandham is dealing with his own nephew
[1:08:53] and his own brother's got a son and he's
[1:08:55] married to a German lady and that German
[1:08:57] lady her whole family are
[1:09:00] snobs they won't repent they're not
[1:09:02] friendly they'll never apologize even
[1:09:04] when they're wrong he's a brandom so he
[1:09:06] come from Drinkers and bootleggers and
[1:09:08] Fighters and gamblers and adulterers
[1:09:11] remember brother brandom that's why he
[1:09:13] hated women he said because he had to
[1:09:15] pack water to the steel and he saw what
[1:09:17] those women were doing in his house you
[1:09:19] know at 3:00 and 4: in the morning and
[1:09:21] so he said I hated women he said now God
[1:09:23] took that out of me and he said gave me
[1:09:26] uh the Holy Ghost and he said now I
[1:09:28] appreciate Godly women there's nothing
[1:09:30] better that a man can have outside of
[1:09:33] his salvation than a Godly
[1:09:36] wife so so we find that that he you know
[1:09:40] he he would have been that way but he
[1:09:42] and so now he's got a
[1:09:43] son and the son has had an altar
[1:09:47] experience right like like many of us
[1:09:51] before we got a new birth we came to the
[1:09:53] altar again and again and again right we
[1:09:56] got prayed we cried we prayed prayed for
[1:09:59] we went to youth camps we did everything
[1:10:00] we could you know when I was a teenager
[1:10:03] in the church and there was such a an
[1:10:05] immature understanding of the new birth
[1:10:08] I mean the altar was just a merry go
[1:10:10] around all the young people went to it
[1:10:11] all the time it was just like this is
[1:10:14] what you do you know and the preacher
[1:10:15] gets to the end of his sermon and he
[1:10:17] starts counting 10 N8 you're terrified
[1:10:20] the rapture's coming and you're running
[1:10:21] to the Altar and you're screaming and
[1:10:23] crying and then you leave there and
[1:10:25] those were real tears I cried plenty of
[1:10:27] them but then we went right outside and
[1:10:30] I hung around and I could see what I was
[1:10:32] doing what they were doing and we
[1:10:33] weren't getting
[1:10:34] converted we we we're getting people
[1:10:37] brother R said we're getting them to
[1:10:38] church but are we getting them to Christ
[1:10:41] are we really bringing them in and
[1:10:42] showing them that this is not just
[1:10:44] Doctrine you're trying to believe or
[1:10:47] understand you might never understand
[1:10:48] all the doctrine but we're here to tell
[1:10:50] you God has done something tremendous in
[1:10:52] this day and you are invited to be a
[1:10:54] part of
[1:10:55] but it requires the giving of your whole
[1:10:58] heart mind body and soul and if you
[1:11:01] don't do that then I'm not saying God
[1:11:03] doesn't love you I'm not even saying
[1:11:05] somewhere in eternity he might find a
[1:11:07] way to save you but you're never going
[1:11:09] to be part of the first resurrection
[1:11:12] you're never going up in the Rapture
[1:11:14] you're certainly not going to be in the
[1:11:15] Millennium that's not my teaching I
[1:11:18] didn't decide that that's his
[1:11:21] teaching and we could go scripture after
[1:11:23] scripture after scripture on that as
[1:11:26] well so you know this nephew had never
[1:11:29] been born again and because of that he's
[1:11:31] arrogant he gets that from his mom you
[1:11:34] know he's he's he's he's angry he's
[1:11:36] aggressive gets that from his dad came
[1:11:38] down through the genes of of of man and
[1:11:40] woman and brother brandham says you know
[1:11:42] he needs the new birth yeah and he says
[1:11:45] Billy I know my son has has has been
[1:11:49] saved he went to the Altar and brother
[1:11:51] brandham didn't deny that he said I'm
[1:11:53] not saying that he hasn't had an
[1:11:54] experience like that but I'm saying that
[1:11:57] he's never been born again you can see
[1:11:59] that his old Fallen nature is still
[1:12:02] dominant see amen and he said and my
[1:12:05] recommen he said my recommendation would
[1:12:07] be that he never marry anybody or he'll
[1:12:10] make some good girl's life hell on Earth
[1:12:14] I'm here to tell you something sister
[1:12:15] don't chase a boy who's not born of the
[1:12:18] spirit of God because the potential for
[1:12:20] him to make your life a hell on Earth is
[1:12:23] large that's
[1:12:27] right so so he he says to his brother
[1:12:31] you know you're a Brandon but why aren't
[1:12:33] you like all of our family because of
[1:12:35] the Holy Ghost he says to the wife
[1:12:36] sister your family is arrogant won't
[1:12:38] apologize they're mean and hateful why
[1:12:40] aren't you like that you're sweet and
[1:12:42] loving and kind and humble he said
[1:12:44] because the Holy Ghost changed you
[1:12:47] see so you know he brother Bram even had
[1:12:51] to break out of that cycle of of being a
[1:12:54] br him and and he you know and God I'm
[1:12:58] glad to know God gave him his daddy at
[1:13:01] his death you know just before he died
[1:13:03] he gave his heart to the Lord and
[1:13:05] brother brandom said I held him in my
[1:13:06] arms and I I watched his curly black
[1:13:09] hair he said as his head went over his
[1:13:10] just barely in his 50s and he said he
[1:13:13] went went to be with the Lord but
[1:13:15] brother brandham got comforted later on
[1:13:18] because he saw him on the other side and
[1:13:19] the lord gave him his daddy at death and
[1:13:21] I'll I mean hey I'll take that for my
[1:13:23] loved ones if I can pray hard enough and
[1:13:26] apply a token and he'll give them to me
[1:13:28] somehow some way you know that that's
[1:13:30] fine but but but I just don't want to
[1:13:33] come in at death I Want to Be Alive Now
[1:13:35] I want to serve him now I want to
[1:13:39] account for something I want to I've
[1:13:41] been called by a great God with a great
[1:13:44] calling who has a great vision and I
[1:13:46] want to be a part of
[1:13:51] that how did you get there brother Jason
[1:13:53] one day I met a great person
[1:13:56] am and he SATs on a throne way up high
[1:13:58] and he called to me did he call to you
[1:14:00] friends oh he drew Us near didn't he my
[1:14:04] he's known us all along and think about
[1:14:06] that he he he he knew you all along and
[1:14:10] still chose
[1:14:13] you amen it's hard to believe brother
[1:14:16] the Lord would call a x Mafia Hitman but
[1:14:19] he
[1:14:22] did amen that quite a work on brother
[1:14:26] Luther
[1:14:27] amen the Holy Ghost sister Melissa or
[1:14:32] something all the
[1:14:34] above well here's the good news brother
[1:14:36] Luther he's choosing you
[1:14:39] still he he knew the mistakes I'd make
[1:14:41] last week he's still choosing me he
[1:14:44] knows I might stumble next week but I'm
[1:14:45] here to tell you he's still choosing me
[1:14:48] he doesn't regret his choice
[1:14:53] hallelujah oh my uh we had all kinds of
[1:14:56] hooks in US didn't we everything that
[1:14:58] Satan could hook onto our life we talked
[1:15:00] about that last time that's still
[1:15:01] burning in my heart my but I'm glad that
[1:15:05] I'm glad that the one who found me could
[1:15:07] do something about it oh my it's one
[1:15:10] thing I get lost in the wilderness and
[1:15:12] search and rescue comes and sends me a
[1:15:14] chopper I'm as glad as I can be to get
[1:15:16] back home to my family but but they're
[1:15:18] they can't keep me from getting lost
[1:15:20] again if I do the same stupid things
[1:15:22] I'll get lost in the same stupid way I'm
[1:15:25] glad that somebody who rescued me who
[1:15:27] could change me Hallelujah so that I
[1:15:30] don't just keep going down that path I
[1:15:32] don't even want to go down that path
[1:15:35] anymore amen he took my old Heart of
[1:15:38] Stone out and gave me a new one amen and
[1:15:40] that's and that then becomes your your
[1:15:44] your new birth nature see so I want to
[1:15:48] say it like that a lot of times we run
[1:15:50] it together too quickly and you don't
[1:15:51] you're missing the point it's a new
[1:15:55] birth nature amen you understand so so
[1:15:59] my new birth Nature has desires like God
[1:16:03] has and it and and it doesn't think like
[1:16:06] the rest of the world why am I weird
[1:16:08] because I don't I have a new birth
[1:16:10] nature why can't I just go along and go
[1:16:13] with the flow because I I don't my new
[1:16:16] birth nature won't doesn't like that see
[1:16:20] it doesn't think like the world it
[1:16:22] doesn't share the same desires as the
[1:16:24] world I don't have the same motives the
[1:16:26] same objectives I used to but I have new
[1:16:29] dreams now New Visions new motives new
[1:16:32] objectives I have new plan I have a
[1:16:34] different world view and I have a
[1:16:36] different view of the
[1:16:39] world I see the world for the poison
[1:16:42] that it
[1:16:43] is
[1:16:45] see and so I I you know I I just
[1:16:48] conclude different things I I go in a
[1:16:50] different direction I don't know I I
[1:16:52] March to the beat of a Different Drum we
[1:16:55] could go on all day describing it you
[1:16:57] know but there's all you say well what's
[1:16:59] it really about it's really about a
[1:17:01] presence dwelling deep within me that
[1:17:04] groans with all creation for the
[1:17:06] manifestation of the sons of God there's
[1:17:09] some alien life down inside of me and it
[1:17:12] it Longs for something more than this
[1:17:14] world has to offer me Longs for a clean
[1:17:18] place a presence of God you know and and
[1:17:21] and and I I wasn't I I'm not happy just
[1:17:24] to be in a Sunday to Sunday Cycle don't
[1:17:27] be satisfied get out of that cycle as
[1:17:30] brother Matt preached about the the the
[1:17:32] the the circle you know the the what do
[1:17:34] they call it the the traffic circle
[1:17:37] those things are not made for you you're
[1:17:39] going somewhere so you don't just go in
[1:17:41] a traffic circle and go around and
[1:17:43] around and around drive out of that
[1:17:45] thing you're never going to get where
[1:17:47] you're going if you're just in a circle
[1:17:49] and in a cycle don't come here in some
[1:17:51] Sunday to Sunday Cycle last Sunday I
[1:17:53] felt great this week we was no good but
[1:17:55] now I'm feeling great again break that
[1:17:57] cycle get rid of that hook let the
[1:18:00] Christ take that chain and snap it out
[1:18:02] of your
[1:18:04] life see drive out of
[1:18:09] it brother brandham is dealing with the
[1:18:14] Pentecostals there and here in
[1:18:18] 1959 he's coming with a very important
[1:18:21] sermon what is the holy
[1:18:26] ghost I
[1:18:27] mean that's a question that everybody
[1:18:30] every Christian had an opinion on now
[1:18:33] the Earth has reached a time where it's
[1:18:36] not just of some great tremendous
[1:18:39] brother or sister from a man age who
[1:18:42] could write a devotional book and try to
[1:18:44] describe and it would be a a it would be
[1:18:47] a mixed bag of accuracy and
[1:18:50] error but now finally the Earth the Lord
[1:18:53] had deployed his seventh star his
[1:18:56] seventh and last star from his right
[1:18:58] hand he had been deployed to the Earth
[1:19:01] he he was catching understanding that
[1:19:04] the world even before the seals he's
[1:19:05] still a
[1:19:07] prophet I used to love brother Homer
[1:19:09] Brown when they would ask him he'd read
[1:19:11] a quote and that somebody would say Well
[1:19:13] when did he say that you know what year
[1:19:15] was it brother brandham said that and
[1:19:16] brother Homer always was that answer the
[1:19:18] same way he would say in the year he was
[1:19:20] a
[1:19:22] prophet that's pretty okay end of
[1:19:25] argument and so he he he and I get the
[1:19:28] background versus the message coming
[1:19:30] under Malachi 4 I get that we're not
[1:19:32] trying to teach on that today but
[1:19:34] brother brandham is saying here and he's
[1:19:36] trying to get the church to understand
[1:19:38] and he says here I believe that we are
[1:19:41] so close to the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:19:44] that it behooves us to do all that we
[1:19:47] possibly can to bring every soul to the
[1:19:50] kingdom and to bring the kingdom to the
[1:19:53] people that we might be healed of our
[1:19:56] Spirits amen so he's he's he's pointing
[1:20:00] to a problem there's a problem going on
[1:20:03] in the last day church now it's not she
[1:20:06] hasn't flatlined yet Christ is only 1959
[1:20:10] she hasn't kicked him out yet she
[1:20:12] will see but she hasn't flatlined yet
[1:20:16] she hasn't put him out so so there's
[1:20:19] there's no need yet for Malachi 4 to
[1:20:21] take the re to to take the message of
[1:20:23] Revelation 184 say come out of her my
[1:20:25] people because that's the message after
[1:20:28] she kicks him out and then that's when
[1:20:30] Malachi 4 the spirit of Elijah is really
[1:20:32] running full force on a man who was born
[1:20:35] a prophet and now he's got a message
[1:20:38] because the the the mighty Angel has
[1:20:41] came down to the strong Angel to give
[1:20:43] him the open book and the message is now
[1:20:45] you need to come out of her before he
[1:20:47] would say get you a good church find you
[1:20:49] a good church go somewhere these men
[1:20:51] will be happy to have you in their
[1:20:53] churches uh because right now but he's
[1:20:56] but he's identifying that the church is
[1:21:00] sick
[1:21:02] 1959 Christ is only going to be welcome
[1:21:06] in the church the modern Christian
[1:21:09] Church he's only only going to be
[1:21:11] welcome for about another four years
[1:21:15] amen and so so literally the church has
[1:21:18] about 4 years to live and then it'll be
[1:21:20] completely dead see and Redemption
[1:21:24] within it is is no longer even possible
[1:21:26] salvation from destruction but
[1:21:29] Redemption no way you've got to come out
[1:21:31] and hear the message you've got to
[1:21:33] receive the word that brings the new
[1:21:35] birth see before he could bring a new
[1:21:38] birth and that because he was in The
[1:21:40] Eternity winking at ignorance well he
[1:21:42] stepped forward and he Blu the seals and
[1:21:45] now he calls all men and says you got to
[1:21:47] now come to the word Paul did the same
[1:21:50] thing that's what the Jews were trying
[1:21:52] to say hey we've got Moses and you got
[1:21:54] 1,600 years of tradition Paul who do you
[1:21:57] think you are and Paul says listen
[1:21:59] you're you're missing the point the lamb
[1:22:01] has now come the one those those
[1:22:04] offerings of animals could never make
[1:22:05] the worshipper perfect you know that as
[1:22:08] well as me you know that you came with
[1:22:11] the same desire and left with the same
[1:22:13] desire every year continually we're
[1:22:15] trying to tell you that that he was he's
[1:22:17] coming to live inside you and that
[1:22:20] during that time where you brought
[1:22:22] animal sacrifices God winked at your
[1:22:24] ignorance that's Paul's language God
[1:22:26] winked at your ignorance but now he
[1:22:29] requireth all men to do what obey Peter
[1:22:33] they asked Peter what shall we do and he
[1:22:35] says repent and Paul says you got to go
[1:22:38] back what do you do God winked at your
[1:22:40] ignorance but now he requireth all men
[1:22:42] to repent amen and accept the name of
[1:22:45] Jesus Christ and take his name in
[1:22:46] baptism and receive the Holy
[1:22:50] Ghost see so a prophet is doing the same
[1:22:53] thing at the in the omeg GA age to say
[1:22:56] yes in those ages that was he winked at
[1:22:58] ignorance Redemption was possible I know
[1:23:01] that because I know Martin Luther is in
[1:23:03] the first resurrection I know John
[1:23:05] Wesley is in the first resurrection
[1:23:06] though Martin Luther smoke and drank and
[1:23:09] Wesley preached Trinity Doctrine I know
[1:23:12] that Christ was in The Eternity winking
[1:23:14] at their ignorance you can't disbelieve
[1:23:16] what you don't know so so you know with
[1:23:19] without and Paul talks about that in the
[1:23:21] fifth chapter of Romans man I'm going to
[1:23:22] get sidetracked if I don't move on here
[1:23:25] but but but Paul talks about that when
[1:23:27] there when there is no law then then you
[1:23:30] you can't be condemned like that because
[1:23:32] you can't be found guilty of
[1:23:33] disbelieving something you don't know
[1:23:36] see so it's all about you say well then
[1:23:38] what about people who can't who can't
[1:23:40] see the message but they're good
[1:23:41] Christian people they they'll be saved
[1:23:44] they already are saved see but that
[1:23:47] doesn't mean they're redeemed they're
[1:23:48] still headed for a tribulation for their
[1:23:50] sin of unbelief and rejecting the pure
[1:23:52] word that would have given them a new
[1:23:54] birth
[1:23:55] amen see and so they will be granted
[1:23:59] eternal life it's obvious that they
[1:24:01] don't have it they're standing at the
[1:24:02] Judgment in Matthew 25 Jesus had
[1:24:05] promised if youve passed from Death To
[1:24:07] Life you'll never stand at that judgment
[1:24:09] you'll be seated with Christ on the
[1:24:12] throne so so these aren't things we're
[1:24:15] making up this is just a prophet putting
[1:24:18] scripture after scripture together and
[1:24:19] making the the case
[1:24:22] incontrovertible and so so we find here
[1:24:24] that he's showing that the church four
[1:24:27] years out of her death spiral four years
[1:24:30] shy of it is already sick and a prophet
[1:24:32] is saying in the message what is the
[1:24:35] holy ghost He we need to be healed of
[1:24:37] our Spirits the body the spiritual body
[1:24:40] of Christ on Earth is very
[1:24:43] sick he comes also in 1959 this is
[1:24:47] actually in a sermon six months prior he
[1:24:50] says this is a sick world isn't it
[1:24:54] and but we know in 1959 that was Cub
[1:24:57] Scouts that was
[1:24:58] t-ball right but you know what's the
[1:25:01] sickest body on Earth I say this with
[1:25:03] reverence not to be sacrilegious God
[1:25:05] forgive me if I say wrong the body of
[1:25:08] Jesus Christ it needs healing and it can
[1:25:11] only be healed he's talk talking about
[1:25:13] brotherly love he actually thought that
[1:25:14] was the evidence of the Holy Ghost till
[1:25:16] he got corrected by the angel it's
[1:25:18] unident it is an Evidence Divine love
[1:25:22] it's part of the package but but the
[1:25:24] real evidence is to be able from your
[1:25:26] very soul to say Amen to every word
[1:25:30] see so so we find he says that that's
[1:25:34] the sickest body I know of all broke to
[1:25:37] pieces and tore up now you good I'm at
[1:25:40] the bottom of the hour so you know me
[1:25:43] I'll take about another 20 25 minutes
[1:25:45] and we'll stop so just stay with me all
[1:25:49] right all right so he
[1:25:52] says it's the it's the body of Christ it
[1:25:55] needs healing all right and he says and
[1:25:58] you're the members of the body so God
[1:26:01] heal you physically and spiritually amen
[1:26:05] catch
[1:26:06] this make you what you should
[1:26:11] be so he's not just talking about a
[1:26:15] healing of you spiritually he's talking
[1:26:17] about a healing that will be sufficient
[1:26:19] to make you what you should be hlj and
[1:26:22] he's preaching all the Days of Our Lives
[1:26:26] so this is about your life what what is
[1:26:28] your life supposed to be there's no way
[1:26:31] you're going to get there without the
[1:26:33] baptism of the holy spirit so so you see
[1:26:36] that it's the it's the it's literally
[1:26:38] the the the bride's privilege all right
[1:26:41] now watch brother brandham comes here in
[1:26:43] the spoken word is Original Seed because
[1:26:45] you're going to see that it's the
[1:26:47] bride's privilege to point The Lost
[1:26:49] World to Christ at his coming he says as
[1:26:53] the end time prophecies will
[1:26:56] repeat I believe as the first runner
[1:27:00] came from the Wilderness and cried
[1:27:02] Behold the Lamb of God the second
[1:27:05] Forerunner will do the same and I if
[1:27:08] you're really a a good student of the
[1:27:10] message you know that when brother
[1:27:12] brandham said it here in 62 he said he
[1:27:15] will probably I took that out you know
[1:27:17] why on the authority of what he said
[1:27:18] later because when he takes this and
[1:27:20] puts it in the church age book it's not
[1:27:22] probably it's for sure
[1:27:24] see so the second Forerunner will do the
[1:27:27] same by pointing the people to a word
[1:27:31] born bride the bride of Christ will be
[1:27:34] pointed to the skies at the appearing of
[1:27:37] Jesus screaming Behold the Lamb of God
[1:27:40] so a prophet you
[1:27:41] say how did he go home and the Rapture
[1:27:44] didn't come we were all going to go
[1:27:46] together he his mission was to come and
[1:27:49] identify you to identify who the bride
[1:27:53] would be what she would look like and
[1:27:56] how she would act and how she would
[1:27:57] conduct herself he he gave the
[1:28:00] specifications so that we could know
[1:28:02] when we're part of the Bride when we're
[1:28:05] willing to say Amen to every word we can
[1:28:07] know we're part of the Bride when I'm
[1:28:09] willing to have my token on display I
[1:28:11] know I'm part of the Bride I don't need
[1:28:13] brother B to come back and tell me that
[1:28:14] or Gabriel to show up and tell me I'm
[1:28:16] highly favored he already told Mary who
[1:28:18] I'm a type who's a type of the bride and
[1:28:21] I already know I'm highly favored
[1:28:26] and so because because first of all what
[1:28:28] is Grace it's the unmar favor amen and
[1:28:34] so the the the Capstone comes crying
[1:28:37] Grace Grace unto it so I already know
[1:28:39] I'm highly favored because Grace is the
[1:28:42] favor of
[1:28:44] God
[1:28:45] see so he he says here it's the bride of
[1:28:49] Christ that will be pointed to the skies
[1:28:52] at the appearing of Jesus screaming
[1:28:54] Behold the Lamb of God so you got a
[1:28:56] mission yes you got a job to do if
[1:28:59] you're a Believer you're supposed to
[1:29:02] your life is supposed to be pointing to
[1:29:05] a Heavenly home and A Life That's Coming
[1:29:08] your life is supposed to be the final
[1:29:10] voice to the final
[1:29:13] age he says in kinsman redeemer just in
[1:29:17] case you're wondering whether you've got
[1:29:18] the tools to do that with if you do if
[1:29:21] you're if you're born again Watch what
[1:29:22] he says in the Kinsman Redeemer now Sons
[1:29:25] and
[1:29:26] Daughters who has the most power before
[1:29:30] God he's talking about a a a son and
[1:29:33] daughter of God versus an angel right he
[1:29:35] says what is an angel an angel is a
[1:29:37] servant that right they're his servants
[1:29:40] what are you his son and daughter who
[1:29:43] has the most power in heaven then a
[1:29:47] sinner that's been saved by grace or an
[1:29:50] archangel that's standing by his right
[1:29:53] side amen here's the answer you ready I
[1:29:57] should leave you on a cliffhanger here's
[1:29:59] the answer The Sinner that's been saved
[1:30:02] by grace has more Authority in heaven
[1:30:05] than the Archangel that stood by his
[1:30:06] side without
[1:30:08] sin why why brother because he's a son a
[1:30:12] son has more Authority than a servant
[1:30:16] yeah but you were born in sin he wasn't
[1:30:18] that just means I know God as a redeemer
[1:30:20] in a way the angel could never know him
[1:30:24] understand so so I have an opportunity
[1:30:26] to be a more complete
[1:30:30] son so an angel you know I mean if you
[1:30:33] if you look at how God operates in in
[1:30:36] the earth now look when they came to the
[1:30:40] the
[1:30:41] tomb they they there was a large Stone
[1:30:44] there that the women couldn't roll away
[1:30:48] so they needed somebody to do something
[1:30:51] that they couldn't do that they even
[1:30:53] though they were Daughters of God they
[1:30:55] couldn't roll the stone away so an angel
[1:30:58] came and rolled the stone away and Peter
[1:31:02] was in prison and he had chains on and
[1:31:06] Peter couldn't get the chains off and he
[1:31:09] couldn't open the prison doors am so
[1:31:12] what happened an angel showed up and
[1:31:15] took the chains off and opened the doors
[1:31:17] and walk and let him out see but but
[1:31:21] when it came to the house of Cornel I
[1:31:24] and the Holy Ghost was going to come and
[1:31:27] baptize people into the Holy Ghost it
[1:31:30] couldn't be an angel showing up to
[1:31:32] preach it had to be a man it had to be
[1:31:35] Peter who summoned the Holy Ghost and
[1:31:39] while he yet spake these words
[1:31:42] hallelujah it's one thing to open a
[1:31:44] prison door loose a chain you might get
[1:31:46] in another prison you might get another
[1:31:48] chain but once you've passed from Death
[1:31:50] to life there's no coming back from that
[1:31:52] Hallelujah and it took a Son of God
[1:31:55] filled with the spirit of God
[1:31:59] see it took the power of
[1:32:03] creation that operated in Peter's
[1:32:06] Ministry to to make New Creations in
[1:32:09] Christ that took a son in the image of
[1:32:12] God free of all Hooks and cycles and all
[1:32:15] everything broken and God in complete
[1:32:17] control of his life that's the that's
[1:32:19] the that's the comfort that I take that
[1:32:22] I know as long as I can I know I'm
[1:32:24] called I already know I wasn't called by
[1:32:26] my parents or by a bible school I was
[1:32:30] called by the same one that called St
[1:32:31] Paul the same one met me in the woods
[1:32:34] and I had a supernatural experience and
[1:32:36] I know I'm called to preach the gospel
[1:32:38] and I and I'm coming out here today and
[1:32:40] my life my whole life is under the blood
[1:32:42] I would never uh pick up this sacred
[1:32:44] book called handling the fires of God
[1:32:47] with with secret sin in my life and
[1:32:49] there is none and I stand Here anointed
[1:32:51] of the Holy Spirit I have power over
[1:32:54] demons I have power to break chains I
[1:32:56] have power to drive back evil
[1:32:59] spirits as I'm preaching the Holy Ghost
[1:33:02] can fall on you it can heal your body
[1:33:04] heal your mind heal your spirit give you
[1:33:07] the new birth say have you ever
[1:33:09] experienced it I it happens all the
[1:33:13] time all the
[1:33:16] timeall see so it it it it God is
[1:33:20] determined to use people amen see it it
[1:33:24] it it took it let me say it this the
[1:33:28] right way it took Hatty
[1:33:31] Wright willing to say the
[1:33:35] truth and believe what she said it there
[1:33:40] there there's nothing about some Gabriel
[1:33:43] showing up in her little cabin and
[1:33:45] saying to you two boys I'm G to force
[1:33:47] you to be born again that that who has
[1:33:50] more Authority the son or daughter of
[1:33:52] God or the angel there was no angel that
[1:33:55] came in there and did that Haddie a
[1:33:57] woman a human being born of the spirit
[1:34:00] of God and brother brandham said sister
[1:34:02] Hattie say anything I'll say it behind
[1:34:05] you and you'll have it and she said the
[1:34:07] salvation of my two sons and those boys
[1:34:09] hit their knees right then because
[1:34:12] that's what God was looking for a bride
[1:34:15] who can point to the skies at the
[1:34:18] appearing of Jesus Christ and say Behold
[1:34:21] the Lamb of God
[1:34:25] am speak the
[1:34:28] word that was Genesis power that was
[1:34:31] operating in
[1:34:33] her there was not enough devils in hell
[1:34:36] to stop
[1:34:38] it see so this is this is how God deals
[1:34:42] in your life and I know good and well
[1:34:45] you're like me we deal with the the
[1:34:49] weaknesses and the ups and downs that we
[1:34:53] we only we talk to the Lord about you
[1:34:55] know that
[1:34:56] list you know that little list that
[1:34:59] little list that only the Lord hears
[1:35:01] that we talk to him
[1:35:02] about the desires of our of our heart
[1:35:05] see we're still trapped in this awful
[1:35:09] Fallen flesh amen and you know I I was
[1:35:13] so appreciating brother Caleb's Sunday
[1:35:16] school from a couple of Sundays ago when
[1:35:18] he started talking about you know the
[1:35:21] Rahab and and she had had had a name and
[1:35:24] it was an ill-famed woman and you know
[1:35:26] if you she she kept the name but the but
[1:35:29] the word began to refer to her in a
[1:35:30] certain way that hadn't applied I mean I
[1:35:33] mean you and the other example he used
[1:35:36] there um who was it Caleb used Rahab and
[1:35:39] uh and Ruth there it was and and and
[1:35:42] Ruth was the moabitas but but then she
[1:35:45] becomes the Bride
[1:35:46] of uh here here here is Ruth Ruth and
[1:35:49] Boaz now she becomes uh the progenitor
[1:35:53] she's now in the lineage of Christ and
[1:35:56] she's going to bring that lineage forth
[1:35:58] and that's eventually going to get to
[1:35:59] Jesse and Jesse's and and we're going to
[1:36:01] find that it's going to go all the way
[1:36:03] down to to the seed line of Christ see
[1:36:06] and the same thing with Rahab who
[1:36:08] married General salmone and then you get
[1:36:09] Boaz and so brother Caleb tracked it all
[1:36:12] all back and and that reminded me
[1:36:14] because I had this point in my notes and
[1:36:16] I said wow isn't that amazing because
[1:36:19] psalms 14:7 now
[1:36:22] watch Psalms
[1:36:24] 14:7 oh that the salvation of Israel
[1:36:28] were come out of
[1:36:30] Zion when the Lord bringeth back the
[1:36:33] Captivity of his people Jacob shall
[1:36:36] rejoice and Israel shall be
[1:36:39] glad see it's a Messianic prophecy that
[1:36:43] one day he's coming and Israel is going
[1:36:45] to be redeemed as a nation in one day
[1:36:48] see and but but if you'll notice here
[1:36:51] that it's representing a coming Nation
[1:36:54] and and and he was called Israel but he
[1:36:58] was still Jacob am see and this isn't
[1:37:02] the only place you would think that once
[1:37:04] the angel said your name will no longer
[1:37:06] be Jacob but it's Israel because Jacob
[1:37:07] meant a
[1:37:09] Shyer and Israel meant a prince you'd
[1:37:12] think they'd have never referred to him
[1:37:14] as Jacob again you'd think that that
[1:37:15] would have been erased from the annals
[1:37:17] of heaven and his name Jacob would have
[1:37:19] never been mentioned again ever and here
[1:37:22] it is hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:37:23] years later and David under inspiration
[1:37:25] is still calling him Jacob but also
[1:37:27] admitting he's Israel and also admitting
[1:37:29] this is the seed line you see friends oh
[1:37:32] my his Spirit had been healed from being
[1:37:36] a Shyer and now he was given the name to
[1:37:39] be fit a nature of a prince God had done
[1:37:42] a work in him but he was still Jacob and
[1:37:45] and and yet he would be a part of the
[1:37:47] coming Kingdom and being God's family
[1:37:49] because look I I I know I'm still me and
[1:37:53] I know I know I've still got faults but
[1:37:55] I am part of a
[1:37:56] kingdom I know I get it I know I'm a Son
[1:38:00] of God I know I get a new name but I'm
[1:38:02] still me I've still got this old flesh
[1:38:05] and and and and and I'm going to be me
[1:38:07] until I get out of here but I am getting
[1:38:10] out of
[1:38:11] here
[1:38:13] hallelujah because why I've surrendered
[1:38:16] to a new
[1:38:18] nature oh
[1:38:21] my my
[1:38:23] I'm part of that same Kingdom I got to
[1:38:26] find a place to
[1:38:29] close we talked about how that
[1:38:32] the you know the Passover was a cycle
[1:38:35] that never dealt with the sin of the
[1:38:39] believer uh whereas you know the baptism
[1:38:42] of the Holy Ghost was literally the
[1:38:44] advantage of the true Sabbath see not a
[1:38:48] day on a calendar but the advantage of
[1:38:51] the true Sabbath would be the holy
[1:38:53] spirit and that that would literally
[1:38:56] pass me from Death unto life and I would
[1:38:59] never come back to having that sinful
[1:39:02] nature again ever forever I would never
[1:39:05] have it
[1:39:06] again and so I I just I thought about
[1:39:09] that this morning and I thought well
[1:39:10] Lord I I might still have ups and downs
[1:39:13] and I'm I'm still trapped in a body that
[1:39:15] makes mistakes but at least I'm that far
[1:39:18] sir at least I've passed from death into
[1:39:20] life you ought to be thankful for that
[1:39:22] today and just say at least I'm that far
[1:39:25] I know I'm still battling but but I but
[1:39:27] I I don't yet have a body that's free of
[1:39:29] Temptations but I am that far hallelujah
[1:39:34] how far are you I have no more desire of
[1:39:36] sin all the desire of the world has gone
[1:39:40] from me I am that
[1:39:42] far
[1:39:45] Hallelujah so a
[1:39:47] messenger was sent in our day see wow
[1:39:52] there for get all of
[1:39:58] this so a messenger is sending our
[1:40:04] day no I'm done stand
[1:40:08] up
[1:40:11] amen no it's just too important to
[1:40:13] preach to you when you're starting to
[1:40:14] get tired and I can feel it amen praise
[1:40:17] the Lord I probably geared you that way
[1:40:19] it's probably my fault but amen but amen
[1:40:22] I love the Lord don't don't
[1:40:24] you amen that's a tough spot to be in
[1:40:28] but I I I I think and trust and hope
[1:40:31] that I've used the better part of wisdom
[1:40:33] amen praise the Lord I want you to Bow
[1:40:36] your heads with me over the building
[1:40:38] this
[1:40:39] morning
[1:40:41] yeah amen let's talk to the Lord
[1:40:53] Lord I sure am
[1:40:55] grateful to you this
[1:40:59] morning you know
[1:41:02] the
[1:41:05] the the way my mind was this morning
[1:41:08] trying to figure and trying to
[1:41:09] encapsulate how do I say all of this how
[1:41:12] do I make it
[1:41:13] clear and Lord you've just built me as
[1:41:15] you've built me I am what I am and I I
[1:41:18] have to feel like I'm being clear if I
[1:41:21] feel like I'm confusing the people Lord
[1:41:23] it'll just give me a nervous breakdown I
[1:41:25] can't preach like that I I'm sorry that
[1:41:28] I go so slow and so
[1:41:30] methodical but you've built me as you've
[1:41:33] built me and so there it is so today
[1:41:36] Lord I I I feel in my heart that we can
[1:41:40] just stop right there I think enough has
[1:41:42] been
[1:41:43] [Music]
[1:41:45] said Lord enough has been said that
[1:41:47] every man and woman ought to have a
[1:41:51] ought to feel afraid fresh desire for
[1:41:54] more of you there ought to be Lord
[1:41:57] there's been enough said today and
[1:41:58] explained in a way that people realize
[1:42:01] that that there's hope for them that you
[1:42:04] are possible that that an experience
[1:42:07] with you is
[1:42:08] doable that you could be a possibility
[1:42:11] in their life Lord and maybe we've said
[1:42:14] it in such a way today that people who
[1:42:17] felt overwhelmed and felt like I just I
[1:42:19] don't think I can be that I don't think
[1:42:21] I could ever get there maybe to today
[1:42:23] it's been shown in a way that they could
[1:42:25] leave here with New
[1:42:26] Hope a new feeling in their heart Lord
[1:42:29] to say I believe I can make it after
[1:42:32] all Lord I commit this audience into
[1:42:35] your hands
[1:42:36] today Lord with what has been said May
[1:42:39] each and every person and Lord and may
[1:42:41] it start with me may I have a fresh
[1:42:45] feeling in my own heart today Lord along
[1:42:48] with these people when we look into the

[1:43:00] of it Lord more and more of it so I'm
