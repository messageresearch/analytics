[0:00] John chapter
[0:05] 15, Job chapter
[0:12] 1. Let's start at verse
[0:16] six. The Bible says, "Now there was a
[0:18] day when the sons of God came to present
[0:21] themselves before the Lord, and Satan
[0:23] came also among them. And the Lord said
[0:26] unto Satan, Whence comest thou?" Then
[0:28] Satan answered the Lord and said, "From
[0:31] going to and fro in the earth, and from
[0:34] walking up and down in it." And the Lord
[0:37] said unto Satan, "Hast thou considered
[0:39] my servant Job, that there is none like
[0:42] him in in the earth, a perfect and
[0:45] upright man, one who fearth God and
[0:48] escueth evil." Then Satan answered the
[0:52] Lord and said, "Doth Job fear God for
[0:56] not? Hast not thou made a hedge about
[1:00] him and about his house and all and
[1:03] about all that he hath on every side.
[1:06] Now that's some protection right there,
[1:08] right? He says and about all that he
[1:12] have on every side. Thou has blessed the
[1:16] work of his hands and his substance is
[1:19] increased in the land. Now catch this.
[1:23] Satan is testifying over God's
[1:26] protection.
[1:29] He knows he can't touch Job. And he's
[1:32] saying his family is blessed. His
[1:35] position, his his possessions are
[1:36] blessed. Everything about him is
[1:39] blessed. Isn't that something? The
[1:42] devil, he's watching all of us, but he
[1:45] knows that there are boundaries. Oh my.
[1:48] Let's keep reading. He says, "But put
[1:50] forth thine hand now and touch all that
[1:54] he hath, and he will curse thee to thy
[1:58] face. And the Lord said unto Satan,
[2:01] Behold, all that he hath is in thy
[2:04] power. Only upon himself, put not forth
[2:08] thy hand." So Satan went forth from the
[2:12] presence of the Lord. Let's go to um St.
[2:15] John chapter 15.
[2:30] Let's start at verse one. St. John
[2:32] chapter 15 verse
[2:34] one. He says, "I am the true vine and my
[2:38] father is the husbandman. Every branch
[2:40] in me that beareth not forth that
[2:44] beareth not fruit, he taketh away. And
[2:47] every branch that beareth fruit, he
[2:49] purgth it, that it may bring forth more
[2:53] fruit. Now ye are clean through the word
[2:56] which I have spoken unto you. Abide in
[2:59] me and I in you. As the branch cannot
[3:02] bear fruit of itself except it abide in
[3:06] the vine, no more can ye except ye abide
[3:10] in me. Amen. May the Lord a bless reader
[3:13] of his word. You can have your
[3:16] seats. Uh tonight by God's grace I don't
[3:19] have anything new but I want to
[3:22] encourage you. Hallelujah. Amen. Because
[3:25] we are in very very intense times and
[3:28] it's it's you know sometimes I think uh
[3:31] I I I not just I think but sometimes I
[3:34] feel like I'm failing. Sometimes I feel
[3:37] like oh Lord God am I am I supposed to
[3:40] be here in my life and the question is
[3:43] yes.
[3:45] The question is yes. I want to tell you
[3:48] that church that there's nothing about
[3:50] your life that's out of order. You know,
[3:53] God is a God of precision. Hallelujah.
[3:56] He knows exactly what to do to get you
[3:58] to wherever you are in life. And you
[4:01] know, my my subject tonight is growth by
[4:04] pruning. Growth by pruning. And you
[4:07] look, if I if I if I go to the
[4:09] scripture, the important verse that I
[4:12] pulling us out of, if we go to um back
[4:15] to St. John chapter 15, the Bible says,
[4:19] "Every branch, Amen. Every every branch
[4:22] in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh
[4:26] away. See, first things first, as a
[4:29] Christian, we're supposed to be
[4:31] producing something. You know, none of
[4:33] us are supposed to be just laidback
[4:35] church members. But there's something
[4:37] about us. We're supposed to be producing
[4:39] fruit. Amen. Why fruit? Because the seed
[4:43] is in the fruit. And if you have no
[4:45] fruit in your life, how is Christianity
[4:48] ever being multiplied? because that was
[4:50] the that was the uh whole commission of
[4:52] Adam. He said, "Be fruitful and
[4:55] multiply." So therefore, church, we must
[4:58] bring forth fruit. But look, he said,
[5:00] "If you're not bringing forth fruit, he
[5:02] taketh away. And every branch that
[5:04] beareth fruit, listen, he purges it."
[5:07] Amen. Hallelujah. That's what we're
[5:10] going to kind of talk about tonight. He
[5:12] purges it that it bring forth more
[5:15] fruit. Hallelujah. That it bring forth
[5:17] more fruit. Now ye are clean through the
[5:19] word which I have spoken unto you. Now
[5:22] we know God's love is elected love. But
[5:25] the way God expresses his love is how
[5:28] church by sending us through a trial. By
[5:31] sending us through something that is
[5:33] very unexpected. That's sending us
[5:35] through situations where we may feel
[5:38] like Lord I don't deserve this. You know
[5:41] think about it as Christians. And most
[5:43] of us we're trying to do the best we
[5:45] can. Most of us we don't smoke. We don't
[5:47] drink. We don't cuss. We don't do none
[5:50] of those things. But constantly, we're
[5:52] going through battles.
[5:54] It almost don't make sense. Amen. It
[5:57] seems like we we're trying to live a
[5:59] dedicated life and we're trying to do
[6:01] the best we can, but we always find
[6:03] ourselves against opposition. We always
[6:06] find ourselves in a in a place where
[6:09] we're saying, "Lord, why me?" Or, "Lord,
[6:12] what have I done to deserve this?" And
[6:14] you know, uh, church, what's going on is
[6:17] that God is constantly purging us that
[6:20] we bring forth more fruit. But what you
[6:23] have to realize is your purging is also
[6:26] a proving ground. Hallelujah. God is not
[6:29] only proving to you, but he's proving to
[6:32] the devil that you will stand. Notice
[6:35] right here in the Bible with Job, God
[6:38] didn't even argue with Job. I mean, with
[6:40] the devil, he didn't argue with him. He
[6:42] told him, "Go ahead."
[6:45] Hallelujah. Amen. But before he told
[6:47] him, "Go ahead," he testified about
[6:50] Job's life. He said he's a perfect and
[6:52] upright man. One who is skeweth from all
[6:55] evil. Now, think about it. Job was going
[6:58] through his trial. Now, he didn't see
[7:00] himself perfect.
[7:03] Amen. Hallelujah. He didn't see himself,
[7:06] Hallelujah. trial free, but God did.
[7:08] Hallelujah. He was already in that stage
[7:11] in God's mind. In God's mind, this trial
[7:15] was nothing.
[7:19] The trial was all about proving the
[7:21] devil wrong. Hallelujah. And your trial
[7:24] is all about the same thing. Proving the
[7:27] devil wrong. So, let's understand
[7:29] something about God. He'll never He
[7:32] can't He'll never put you through
[7:34] anything that you can't handle. That's
[7:37] right. That's right. Hallelujah. If he
[7:40] would put you through something that
[7:42] would cause you to fail, that mean God
[7:44] is alive.
[7:48] And the prophet said he's not the author
[7:51] of confusion. So he has to have a
[7:54] purpose. But the thing of it is we have
[7:57] to be able to go through the purging and
[8:00] not complain.
[8:02] Yes, sir. We have to go through the
[8:04] tests and trials and find a way
[8:06] somewhere in there to say, "Thank you,
[8:08] Jesus."
[8:10] Hallelujah. Because you have people
[8:12] accuse you while you're going through a
[8:14] trial. They'll say you you sin and all
[8:17] these things while you're going through
[8:19] a trial. They'll judge your family.
[8:21] They'll judge your relationship. They'll
[8:23] judge who you are in church while you're
[8:25] going through a trial. But just
[8:27] remember, brother Brad, all he's doing
[8:29] is proving to the devil that he's a lie.
[8:32] All he's doing is proving to the devil
[8:34] that you will win. And listen, all of
[8:37] Joe's accusers had no proof
[8:41] of any kind of wrongdoing in his life.
[8:49] We sing a song at home. You can talk
[8:52] about me as much as you please. And the
[8:55] more you talk, I'm going to bend my
[8:58] knees.
[9:00] Church, that's what it's all about. The
[9:01] prophet preached reaction to an action.
[9:04] Hallelujah. An action oral reaction. You
[9:06] know the message. Hallelujah. And a lot
[9:08] of times, God wants to see what you
[9:10] going to do. But look, what did the
[9:12] trial do for Job? Hallelujah. What did
[9:15] the pruning or the purging do for Job?
[9:18] It brought more revelation out.
[9:21] Amen. Hallelujah. It brought more
[9:24] revelation out. Job began to say, "The
[9:26] Lord God giveth and the Lord God what?
[9:29] Taketh away." When was the last time you
[9:32] blessed God?
[9:35] Because of what you're going through.
[9:37] Oh, hallelujah.
[9:40] Wow. You say, "Bro D, why are you
[9:42] preaching this?" Because I learned.
[9:45] [Music]
[9:46] Hallelujah. I'm preaching by experience
[9:49] tonight. Hallelujah. And when I was when
[9:52] I was
[9:52] um when this thought was coming and and
[9:55] this it just this church is special to
[9:58] my ministry because I can have something
[10:01] at the house or something and study but
[10:03] it's something about getting on
[10:06] 95. And as soon as I get on 95
[10:09] everything start to turn. Everything
[10:11] started to go right not left. It goes
[10:12] right. It goes right and inspiration
[10:15] starts to fall and I have no notes and
[10:17] no nothing. and all of it just starts to
[10:20] come and come and God say preach about
[10:21] this and preach about that and and I be
[10:24] like Lord but what about this he said no
[10:26] preach on this
[10:28] it never fails so what God is telling
[10:31] saying tonight be encouraged
[10:34] hallelujah because your trials are for
[10:37] your good we quote the scripture all the
[10:40] things all all things work out for good
[10:42] but when we going to believe it
[10:44] hallelujah we when we going to come to
[10:47] church and say Oh, brother Digs, I got
[10:49] this ankle. I got this pain. But blessed
[10:51] be the name of the Lord.
[10:54] I don't know why I'm going through this,
[10:56] but hallelujah. Do you expect to receive
[10:59] all good and no evil at the hand of the
[11:01] Lord? That's what Job told his wife.
[11:06] Sure did.
[11:11] But church, there is a
[11:12] purging that we go through as believers.
[11:16] And purging is not Hallelujah. It
[11:19] doesn't mean that you've done wrong.
[11:22] Purging means that there is still some
[11:25] hidden mystery in you that we haven't
[11:28] seen yet. Hallelujah. Church, God
[11:31] allowed David, hallelujah, to commit
[11:34] adultery. Hallelujah. Premeditate
[11:37] murder. Hallelujah. Conspire and do all
[11:40] these things to one man just to get
[11:43] Psalms 51 out of him.
[11:45] created me a clean heart.
[11:49] Oh my. He allowed him to go through a
[11:52] King David, mighty warrior. God said,
[11:55] "If you would have asked me, I would
[11:57] have gave you another woman." Amen. But
[11:59] God let him go through all of that just
[12:02] to get that son created me a clean
[12:04] heart. Take not thy Holy Spirit from me.
[12:09] And what do we do now when we get in
[12:11] situations? We cry out that same son.
[12:14] Hallelujah.
[12:16] Why?
[12:17] So that trial, those fruit were for us
[12:21] to eat on. Amen.
[12:24] Yes, sir. David being purged for our
[12:27] benefit. Hallelujah. And you may not
[12:31] have realized it, but sometimes you go
[12:33] through things because somebody's going
[12:35] to go through it after you.
[12:37] And they're watching how you go through
[12:39] it. And if you go through it right, I
[12:42] guarantee you they'll come back and tell
[12:44] you, "I thank God for you because I saw
[12:47] you going through what I'm going through
[12:49] and you were a good blessing to me."
[12:52] Hallelujah.
[12:53] Praise the Lord. Amen,
[12:57] church. But you
[12:59] look, Satan has boundaries.
[13:03] There's only so much he can do.
[13:06] And you'll be surprised what you can go
[13:10] through. You'll be surprised how much
[13:13] you can take. You'll be surprised,
[13:16] hallelujah, how much you can hear and
[13:18] stay focused. You'll be surprised how
[13:21] much strength you have with so much
[13:23] weight on your shoulders and you still
[13:25] get up and remain faithful. You'll be
[13:28] surprised. Hallelujah. Until you go
[13:30] through it.
[13:32] And when you're going through it, you're
[13:34] like, I don't know where the strength
[13:35] came from, but there was something in me
[13:37] that wouldn't let me quit. What was it?
[13:40] Hallelujah. It was the manifestation.
[13:42] Hallelujah. Of God's spirit. Amen. Amen.
[13:46] And God's using that thing to make you
[13:48] stronger. Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[13:52] Think about it, church.
[13:53] Job, what he was going through, it
[13:55] caught him by such a surprise.
[13:58] Hallelujah. that the Bible say he went
[14:00] and sat on the ash heap
[14:04] and and
[14:05] and I don't know if Elephants and the
[14:09] different ones his friends are going to
[14:11] be there in heaven but I almost if we
[14:13] get to heaven I almost want to rebuke
[14:16] [Music]
[14:18] them now I might not be saying their
[14:20] names right different ones y'all know
[14:22] what I'm talking about Joe's
[14:24] buddies all they could do was judge him
[14:27] by his trial. Yes, sir. Brother Jason,
[14:30] they had no proof. And they say he can't
[14:33] lose his family. He didn't lost his
[14:36] children, all his possessions. He got to
[14:38] be sinning.
[14:40] They came to their own conclusion. And
[14:43] you know what the whole trial was? The
[14:45] trial was a bet between God and the
[14:47] devil.
[14:52] Church, you may not realize it. God is
[14:54] betting on you.
[14:56] God has put everything on the table.
[14:58] Hallelujah. And he said, "I place my
[15:00] money on JD." Hallelujah. I place my
[15:03] money on Matt. Hallelujah. I place my
[15:05] money on the Yash family. Hallelujah. I
[15:08] place my money on Caleb. Hallelujah.
[15:11] See, church, God is not worried. He
[15:13] Hallelujah. He'll come with his whole
[15:15] stack, all of his millions, say, "Put
[15:17] this on
[15:20] seven." Hallelujah. because this child
[15:23] is going to make them complete.
[15:29] God, I hope you're being encouraged
[15:30] tonight.
[15:33] There's no way you can lose
[15:36] because if you lose, that mean God
[15:37] doesn't know what he was talking about,
[15:40] church. Hallelujah. In God's casino,
[15:43] hallelujah, of our life, every table is
[15:48] rigged. Amen.
[15:52] Every table is rigged.
[15:55] You can't help but come out winners
[15:58] and Satan looks at my life. Hallelujah.
[16:01] And he says, "God, give me the dice. I
[16:04] want some sixes." And God says, "No,
[16:06] it's going to always come on
[16:08] sevens. My dice are loaded to one side.
[16:12] So no matter how I'm thrown, hallelujah,
[16:14] it always comes out of my favor.
[16:19] It'll always come out in your favor,
[16:21] church.
[16:23] Amen. Amen. I hope somebody being
[16:26] blessed.
[16:29] I want you to look at it
[16:31] not so much as what I'm saying, but your
[16:35] life tonight
[16:36] and to know that there is a purpose. And
[16:41] what God is doing, he's growing your
[16:43] tree. That's right. Amen. By the
[16:46] pruning. Hallelujah. Listen, what does
[16:50] it mean to be
[16:51] pruned? Now, for those of you who don't
[16:53] understand what pruning is, I'm going to
[16:55] give you a definition, but I'm going to
[16:57] give you an example first. Pruning is
[17:00] when you got a tree that has grown a
[17:02] certain way. And maybe it's pushed out
[17:05] what it's supposed to pushed out and now
[17:08] it's got branches, hallelujah, that are
[17:10] leaning a certain way. And those
[17:12] branches may be in the way of something.
[17:15] They may be stopping something from
[17:17] being other branches from seeing
[17:18] sunlight. And those branches have to be
[17:21] cut,
[17:24] but those branches being cut does not
[17:26] destroy the tree.
[17:29] What it does, it makes room for the
[17:31] other branches to continue to grow and
[17:33] live. And there are areas in your life,
[17:36] areas in my life that God has to prune.
[17:38] Hallelujah. It doesn't mean that we're
[17:40] not Christians, but it mean that that
[17:42] stage is over. Hallelujah. That stage is
[17:45] over, honey. That trial is over. The
[17:48] effect of that trial is over. And now
[17:50] I'm cutting it off. That you can no
[17:52] longer remember it.
[17:54] There's some things that we are still
[17:56] remembering and bring it up. And God
[17:58] wants to prune it and cut it off. So you
[18:01] can grow in other areas. Hallelujah.
[18:05] Hallelujah.
[18:07] But you cut it off so that the tree can
[18:10] grow. so that the other the other other
[18:13] parts of the tree can get strength.
[18:16] But listen, it says pruning can remove
[18:20] any portion of that that have a disease.
[18:26] And you know how people do the problem
[18:29] in the message is come on. We have so
[18:32] many people sitting in church still
[18:36] living by their hurts
[18:39] and they want to blame the message of
[18:41] the hour for it. No, it's not the word.
[18:44] It's you still carrying baggage that you
[18:47] can be delivered from because the
[18:50] message came to set us free. But what we
[18:53] do is we live with our hurts and our
[18:55] pains and and what does it does? It
[18:57] causes a
[18:59] disease. It causes a sickness.
[19:01] Hallelujah. Well, people say, "Well, I
[19:03] can't go to church." No way. Because
[19:04] I've been hurt.
[19:08] And then you have men leave church and
[19:10] go home and start church in their house
[19:13] and become pastor. And they never been
[19:15] called to be a pastor.
[19:18] And they raise their family up with no
[19:20] fellowship. Raise their family up.
[19:22] Hallelujah. Without the five-fold
[19:23] ministry.
[19:25] Amen. Because they've been hurt. But all
[19:28] God was trying to do was prune the tree.
[19:32] Amen.
[19:34] Come on. And I know people stay in the
[19:36] house, have house meetings. Hallelujah.
[19:39] For years when the Bible says,
[19:42] hallelujah, that the five-fold ministry
[19:43] is there for the perfecting of the
[19:47] saints. Yes, sir. Praise God.
[19:51] I learned a while
[19:53] ago, as much as I liked having my family
[19:57] go everywhere with me, I realized I was
[19:59] in the five-fold ministry.
[20:02] And the only way they was going to be
[20:04] perfected is by staying back.
[20:06] Hallelujah. Now, that made me feel some
[20:08] kind of way because I like having the
[20:11] crew with me. But coming to terms that,
[20:14] hallelujah, their livelihood is at
[20:16] stake, too. But think about how good it
[20:19] is. Hallelujah. You f to go to another
[20:21] church and your kids say, "Daddy, I just
[20:24] want to stay home here, pastor.
[20:26] Shouldn't that make you happy?
[20:32] But you know, we selfish and we won't
[20:34] control everything."
[20:38] Amen. I just got back I just got back
[20:40] from London and I preached a message to
[20:42] the youth. Hallelujah. I called it let
[20:44] it go. Because there's a lot of things
[20:46] we're holding on to when all we got to
[20:49] do is let it go. And what you have to
[20:51] realize in a tug of war, in a tug of
[20:53] war, there's you on this side and
[20:55] there's only two spirits on the other
[20:56] side. You're either pulling against God
[20:58] or you're pulling against the devil. And
[21:00] the thing of it is what we need to do is
[21:02] stop pulling and just let it go. Because
[21:04] whatever you're pulling will go back to
[21:06] the rightful owner.
[21:09] Hallelujah. If it belongs to God, it'll
[21:12] go back to God. If it belongs to the
[21:14] devil, it'll go back to the devil. So I
[21:16] say to you, every form of disease, let
[21:19] it go. Every depression, let it go.
[21:22] Every hurt, let it go. Every pain, let
[21:25] it go. Hallelujah. Church, I'm living by
[21:29] a new revelation. Brother Diggs is only
[21:31] trying to control whatever he can't
[21:34] control.
[21:38] Amen. Hallelujah.
[21:40] You say, "Bro, what does that mean?
[21:43] That
[21:44] means put the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[21:47] in my children in God's hands.
[21:51] No matter what I see.
[21:54] God is in your hands. Because all I can
[21:57] control is what I can control. How do
[22:01] you control it, Brother Diggs? By
[22:02] committing it to God. Get down on my
[22:05] knees and pray and say, "Lord, I
[22:07] dedicated to you. Now I'm looking for
[22:09] you to do your part because you told me
[22:12] raise them up in the way they should go.
[22:14] It don't matter if they snorting
[22:15] cocaine.
[22:19] If you did your part, if you raise them
[22:22] up the way they supposed to go, you are
[22:24] blameless.
[22:26] The rest belongs to God.
[22:29] Hallelujah. And but you know what
[22:31] happens? We say, "Oh God, Lord, please
[22:34] save my child." Next thing you know,
[22:36] your son gets locked up, going to jail,
[22:38] and you trying to mortgage the house,
[22:40] sell everything. You just said, "Lord,
[22:42] do whatever you got to do to save him,
[22:44] and now you trying to bail them out."
[22:51] Leave them in it. That's the best thing
[22:52] for them.
[22:54] If you prayed about it, let it go.
[22:58] Commit it to God because they got to be
[23:00] pruned, too.
[23:03] That's good. He said, "Oh God, Lord,
[23:05] please save my daughter." Then she gets
[23:08] pregnant.
[23:09] And you like, "Oh my Lord, why you let
[23:11] this happen?" And, "Oh, she can't be in
[23:13] the house anymore." You said, "Do
[23:15] whatever you got to do to let her get
[23:17] saved."
[23:21] And that responsibility can change her
[23:23] life. You know, we don't look at things
[23:25] like that. Ah, she committed sin. God
[23:28] allowed it.
[23:31] Yes, it all comes back to God. God
[23:35] allowed it. God allowed Joe's brothers
[23:37] to be Joseph's brothers to be jealous of
[23:40] him, hate him, sell him into slavery,
[23:42] and then Piper's wife to lie on him, get
[23:45] him thrown in jail, let the baker and
[23:47] butler, hallelujah, forget all about him
[23:49] just to get him in position.
[23:52] What was he doing? God was pruning him,
[23:54] church, through all of his trials, he
[23:57] was still being used. Amen. But what was
[24:00] God doing? He was getting more fruit out
[24:02] of his life.
[24:04] Oh, I feel good.
[24:07] Hallelujah. Praise God. See what we
[24:11] need. The prophet of God say we need a a
[24:13] a a backyard bl backyard blue sky
[24:18] sinkilling Holy Ghost revival.
[24:22] But we will forget about church order
[24:24] and we just say, "Lord, I thank you cuz
[24:27] you've been good to me." Amen. Amen.
[24:29] Amen.
[24:31] Oh, brother D, he's just he's just
[24:33] trying to stir us up.
[24:36] I don't feel like all that tonight.
[24:40] Come on. Okay. But what if it's God
[24:43] trying to stir you up?
[24:46] You going to tell him, "I don't feel
[24:47] like it."
[24:49] I bet you going to tell your boss you
[24:51] don't feel like coming in.
[24:54] What you do is make up a lie. Uh, my
[24:57] temperature is
[25:00] 98.5,
[25:02] not.3. But let me move
[25:06] on. You know, that's that's kind of one
[25:08] of my pet peeves because of the way I
[25:13] am. Sometimes I think people want me to
[25:15] apologize for being excited.
[25:19] Apologize for being radical about God.
[25:23] apologize for giving God praise and
[25:25] dance and worship.
[25:29] But I'm sorry. I don't have no
[25:32] apologies.
[25:33] God healed me from cancer in my brain.
[25:36] When the doctor said if I don't take
[25:38] chemo, I'mma die. Well, I ain't dead
[25:40] yet.
[25:42] So, I might as well give God some
[25:43] praise.
[25:45] Hallelujah. Heal me from diabetes at
[25:48] least four
[25:49] times. Amen. To where the devil just
[25:53] might as well quit cuz I got a
[25:55] revelation of it now. And you don't want
[25:58] me to praise God in your church. Well,
[26:00] I'm sorry. I'm like Paul. From this
[26:02] purpose, I came. Hallelujah. That the
[26:05] starchiness, Hallelujah. would get out
[26:07] of Bethl Tabernacle. That these young
[26:10] people would see a man on fire.
[26:12] Hallelujah. They see a man, Hallelujah,
[26:15] that has no apologies for the goodness
[26:17] of God. God came into my life when I was
[26:20] 15 years old and he hadn't left me yet.
[26:23] Through every trial, he's been faithful.
[26:27] Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[26:30] And I'm like, brother Brandham.
[26:32] Hallelujah. If my kids go to the world,
[26:34] they have to walk over a Christian life.
[26:39] Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[26:42] Hallelujah.
[26:45] I'm sorry. If you see me in heaven, it's
[26:48] gonna be just like this. Ain't gonna be
[26:51] no preaching. Ain't gonna be a bunch of
[26:52] screaming and holling, worship, giving
[26:54] God praise.
[26:56] Ain't going to be no preaching in
[26:57] heaven. Ain't going to be nothing but a
[26:59] worship service.
[27:02] Amen. Cuz the unveiling of the word and
[27:05] its fullness is going to be before us.
[27:08] Ain't nobody going to have to tell you
[27:10] about Jesus. And if you can't worship
[27:12] him now, you ain't going to worship him
[27:14] over there. Cuz the prophet of God say
[27:16] only thing death does is change your
[27:19] dwelling place. It does not change who
[27:21] you are.
[27:24] Like people say, "If I was with the if I
[27:26] was with the uh uh Jesus on the shores
[27:28] of Galilee, boy, I would have had a
[27:29] time. No more of a time than you having
[27:32] right now."
[27:34] It's all about your image and the
[27:36] revealing of God in your heart.
[27:38] Hallelujah. And if you got that
[27:40] revealing now, you'll do the same thing
[27:42] then that you're doing now.
[27:48] staring at the Lord while he's
[27:49] preaching.
[27:53] [Laughter]
[28:00] He's breaking bread. He doing miracles.
[28:03] And all you got
[28:06] is He's speaking personally in your
[28:09] life. And all you got is
[28:12] I don't know about you, but I didn't had
[28:14] hallelujah. Holy Ghost fil men walk up
[28:17] to me and tell me exactly what I've been
[28:19] praying about and you want me to just
[28:22] [Applause]
[28:25] Hallelujah. J, I couldn't be that man in
[28:27] the Bible where Jesus said, "Don't tell
[28:29] nobody I did this." Huh?
[28:33] I'm sorry. Go see a man.
[28:40] Come see a man
[28:42] who's changed my life. Yeah, I got
[28:45] faults. Yeah, I got ups and downs. But I
[28:47] got a God who remains faithful through
[28:50] my faults, through my ups and downs. I
[28:53] can always go to him and say, "Lord, you
[28:55] remain the same. You forgave me one time
[28:57] and I'm asking you to forgive me again."
[29:00] Hallelujah.
[29:02] Hallelujah. Praise God. Does anybody
[29:04] feel strong tonight? Well, if you don't,
[29:07] let me help you out. As a Christian,
[29:09] your Bible says the joy of the Lord is
[29:12] your strength. Just thinking about God
[29:15] ought to put a smile on your face.
[29:18] And if you don't want it, I take your
[29:20] smile.
[29:23] Give it to me.
[29:27] It's amazing because you know in our
[29:30] journey we're being we're being pruned
[29:33] and our children are watching us be
[29:35] Christians.
[29:37] They're watching you. They're watching
[29:38] your salvation to watch you go through
[29:39] and and it's amazing to me. We rebuke
[29:42] our kids and say you need to give God
[29:43] praise. You need to sing and all these
[29:45] things we you need to you need to you
[29:47] need to you need to and all they doing
[29:49] is watching you.
[30:01] There is a thing called learn behavior.
[30:04] There is a thing called influence.
[30:07] Hallelujah.
[30:08] Oh my. Let me move on everybody. All
[30:10] right.
[30:12] He says uh that that pruning can remove
[30:16] any portion that have a disease.
[30:20] Fungi. Y'all know what fungi is, right?
[30:23] Fungi, it gets on something, it begins
[30:25] to overtake it. And as it overtake, it's
[30:28] a growth. And as it overtaken, it it
[30:31] starts to produce disease.
[30:34] And some of us have spiritual fungi in
[30:37] our lives. Hallelujah. Things that we've
[30:40] come in contact that we've never got rid
[30:42] of. And now it's overtaken your journey.
[30:46] Can't even praise God. can't even say,
[30:47] "Lord, I love you." Can't even smile
[30:50] while you're going through it, cuz all
[30:52] you can do is think about what you're
[30:54] going through.
[30:56] Don't think about what you're going
[30:57] through. Think about, hallelujah, who's
[31:00] helping you go through it.
[31:04] And other types of
[31:06] decay, stopping it from spreading to
[31:09] healthier branches. That's what pruning
[31:11] does. pruning. Hallelujah. It cuts off
[31:15] all the sickness and the decay and the
[31:18] fungi. Hallelujah. To make the whole
[31:20] tree healthier.
[31:22] Oh my. Removing these branches can also
[31:26] expose the others to move to more
[31:29] sunlight.
[31:32] Hallelujah.
[31:33] Church, where God deals with certain
[31:35] situations in your life by pruning, all
[31:38] he's doing is rising up other areas that
[31:40] haven't been touched yet.
[31:43] Hallelujah. There areas in your life
[31:46] that hadn't been touched spiritually
[31:47] yet. So the way God gets to that is
[31:50] sending you through a trial.
[31:54] Woo. You say, "Lord, give me more love."
[31:57] He'll send you through a trial just to
[31:58] touch that area of more love. You say,
[32:01] "Lord, give me more joy." He'll touch
[32:04] that area in a trial by giving you more
[32:07] joy.
[32:12] Anybody want to be touched?
[32:15] Be careful. God is faithful.
[32:18] Be careful. God is faithful. You say,
[32:20] "Lord, I want to be touched." He will
[32:22] touch you with a
[32:27] trial. Y'all looking at me. Oh my
[32:31] God. I don't want to go through a trial.
[32:34] Trust me, you are.
[32:37] To get out of here. You will. Amen.
[32:40] Hallelujah. But the good thing about it,
[32:41] you will survive it.
[32:44] You have to. Hallelujah. For you to fail
[32:47] will be like God himself failing. Why?
[32:49] Because his seed is inside of you.
[32:52] That's right. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Oh
[32:54] my. Hallelujah. Oh my. This is the part
[32:58] I like. He said branches can also expose
[33:00] the others to move to more sunlight and
[33:04] air circulation. Woo. When you got more
[33:07] air circulation, the whole body is being
[33:10] blasted.
[33:15] Two, what's the two most important
[33:17] elements of your body?
[33:20] Oxygen
[33:21] and the blood.
[33:24] Without oxygen, the blood can't flow
[33:27] freely.
[33:29] Hallelujah. And without no blood, you're
[33:32] dead.
[33:35] Amen. The most two important things. But
[33:38] the oxygen and the blood works together
[33:40] to keep everything running in harmony.
[33:42] Hallelujah.
[33:44] He said which also helps to reduce
[33:48] Hallelujah. to reduce diseases
[33:51] encourages fruit production. Hallelujah.
[33:54] So your trial, it encourages fruit
[33:56] production. And that's what God was
[33:59] showing the devil here in Job's life.
[34:02] But all his friends could see was what
[34:04] he was going through.
[34:07] Whatever happened to the the the the the
[34:10] proverb, don't judge a book by its
[34:12] cover.
[34:14] We do that so much.
[34:17] We do that so much. Look, let me say
[34:21] this. For you to go through anything, it
[34:23] has to be in the plans of God. That's
[34:25] right. And God can use what he want to
[34:28] use, how he want to use it, when he want
[34:30] to use it to make you a better person.
[34:34] But let's just
[34:36] let's just take Satan's grip off of it
[34:38] tonight.
[34:39] Because he Satan think he has a grip on
[34:41] the whole situation. Let's take his
[34:44] hands off of it tonight. Hallelujah. God
[34:47] directs the devil on where he can try
[34:50] you.
[34:51] [Music]
[34:56] He can't say, "I'mma mess with the
[34:58] family." Not without God's permission.
[35:01] I'mma mess with the children, not
[35:02] without God's permission. Because you
[35:05] go, you go from chapter 1 to chapter two
[35:08] of Job. First things were all his
[35:09] possession, his children, and all that
[35:11] stuff. And then God says, "But don't
[35:13] touch his life." Satan had to abide by
[35:16] that. Hallelujah. And then Job came out
[35:19] victorious. Hallelujah, church. He
[35:21] wasn't restored yet, but he was still
[35:24] blessing God. That's what the whole
[35:26] trial was about. Satan wanted to hear
[35:28] Job curse God. But in the midst of
[35:31] losing his possessions, losing his
[35:33] money, losing his children, wife talking
[35:36] bad about him, he never cursed God.
[35:42] So he was still winning even though he
[35:44] lost everything.
[35:46] Then Satan comes back, hallelujah, and
[35:49] he says, "You know what?"
[35:51] Yeah, he doing all that, but let me get
[35:53] his body. See, even though he was going
[35:55] through all that stuff, Satan couldn't
[35:57] touch his body. Now, he asked God for
[36:00] permission to touch his body. And God,
[36:02] Hallelujah, because the table is rigged,
[36:04] God said, "Go ahead.
[36:07] Put all your cards. Put all your money
[36:08] on the table."
[36:10] And he says, "Go ahead." And you know
[36:12] what? Job had balls from his head to his
[36:15] toe, all over his body. But you know
[36:17] what? Hallelujah. He still didn't curse
[36:19] God. That's right. But more revelation
[36:22] came out. Hallelujah. Job's trial
[36:25] brought him what? It brought him all the
[36:27] way to the cross before Christ in the
[36:29] flesh had ever died.
[36:32] Amen. Hallelujah.
[36:34] Only the prophet of God said the oldest
[36:36] book in the Bible is Job. Amen. But when
[36:39] Job said, "I know my redeemer liveth."
[36:41] Hallelujah. And I shall see him again in
[36:43] the flesh. God hadn't even been to the
[36:46] cross yet. Amen. Your child, Hallelujah,
[36:49] it should express new areas of God, new
[36:52] revelations of God, Hallelujah, in your
[36:55] life.
[36:57] Amen.
[37:02] Look, but in pruning, now this is
[37:06] powerful. This is powerful right here.
[37:07] And I ain't gonna be too much longer.
[37:09] I'm about to close. Look, in pruning, I
[37:11] want to show you how to prune a tree.
[37:14] And you think about I want you to catch
[37:15] the steps of this pruning a tree. If you
[37:18] want to cut a branch off, you want to
[37:20] prune that
[37:21] tree. You don't just cut it from the
[37:23] base. No. Or or where that limb is
[37:26] pushing out from. Let's just say my arm
[37:28] is the limb that need to be
[37:30] cut. This is a figure of speech,
[37:35] Lord. You ain't going to cut it. If you
[37:38] pruning, you going to cut it right here.
[37:40] No, you start further out.
[37:43] And you cut right here. Why do you cut
[37:46] right here? Because if I cut where I
[37:49] need, where I want to cut, as the tree
[37:52] is falling, it's going to tear areas
[37:53] that don't need to be torn. And then
[37:56] it'll cause the tree longer to
[37:59] heal. So what God, oh boy, this is
[38:01] powerful. So what God does, he'll stop
[38:04] further out in the pruning situation.
[38:07] It's called It's called, Hallelujah,
[38:09] three cut method. And what what what a
[38:12] man does when he's pruning a tree.
[38:14] Hallelujah. He doesn't cut from the top
[38:17] first. He cuts from the bottom.
[38:20] Cuts in areas that nobody else sees.
[38:23] Hallelujah. And he cuts that tree from
[38:26] the bottom. Hallelujah. Because what's
[38:28] going to happen is that cut is going to
[38:31] protect the whole tree as you cut
[38:33] closer.
[38:36] Oh, I wish I had a video to show it.
[38:38] Sister thought I should have told you
[38:39] that. But look what he does is just say
[38:42] he starts cutting out. Can everybody
[38:43] hear me good? Are we all right on the
[38:45] tape? Can you hear me good? You might
[38:47] want to cut this long while I
[38:48] illustrate. But look what he does is he
[38:50] cuts out here but it cuts under here.
[38:53] But to get the tree he has to come back
[38:55] and cut from the top because as he
[38:58] cutting from the top the the weight of
[39:00] the tree will fall down but this cut
[39:02] will protect everything else from being
[39:04] torn. Amen. So what God does, the trial
[39:09] starts way out here, but then it gets
[39:11] intense as it comes
[39:14] back. But it's all about making the cut.
[39:17] Hallelujah. More able for you to bear.
[39:20] Hallelujah. And what he does, he starts
[39:23] in here in areas nobody else sees.
[39:25] Hallelujah. And he cuts underhand. Then
[39:28] he comes and cuts from the top and the
[39:30] branch that part falls off. But the rest
[39:33] of the womb is protected. Then you go
[39:35] back to the shoulder of the tree and cut
[39:38] the rest of the branch off.
[39:41] Are you catching me? And by doing it
[39:44] that way, the three cut method, you
[39:46] protect the whole tree and you help it
[39:48] to heal faster.
[39:50] And that's what God does. You say,
[39:52] "Brother James, my trials are getting
[39:54] more and more intense now because the
[39:56] cut is getting smoother."
[39:59] See, out here, you couldn't handle that
[40:02] cut right here yet. Amen. So God starts
[40:05] out here and cuts underhand. He cuts
[40:07] right here. Then he comes back after it
[40:09] falls off and touches those real real
[40:12] sensitive areas.
[40:15] Amen.
[40:18] Let's
[40:19] go. I hope y'all brothers got my
[40:23] stuff. This This right here is in the
[40:25] message um the approach to God.
[40:29] He says, "Now, have you ever
[40:32] noticed how that when the disaster
[40:34] struck Job's
[40:36] home, you hear me say a
[40:38] disaster?" Don't we feel like sometimes
[40:41] our Christian journey is a disaster?
[40:43] I don't know about you, it feel like a
[40:45] disaster. Brother Matt, hallelujah.
[40:47] God's been giving me inspiration by
[40:48] preaching on
[40:49] tragedy. And you know, sometimes we have
[40:52] tragedy in our lives and we say, "Oh,
[40:54] God, this is so tragic." Amen.
[40:58] Why did this happen? It's so tragic. H
[41:01] but
[41:02] God, he don't think like we think.
[41:06] Let's just take a tragedy. Hallelujah.
[41:08] In the scripture, Ruth, her husband
[41:12] died. Oh, it's so
[41:14] tragic. We got saints in here.
[41:16] Hallelujah. Who's lost loved ones? Her
[41:19] husband died. Then her brother-in-law
[41:22] died. Her father-in-law died. Oh, it was
[41:24] so tragic. But all of those tragedies
[41:27] led her to Boaz.
[41:32] Hallelujah. So God used those tragedies
[41:36] to put her life in a position better
[41:38] than it ever was.
[41:40] Hallelujah. Because her husband wasn't a
[41:43] type of Christ. Her husband, Hallelujah,
[41:46] couldn't redeem Naomi and all the
[41:48] possessions. Hallelujah. But once the
[41:50] tragedy took place, oh my
[41:54] Ruth be to live a life that she could
[41:57] never live married to the man she was
[41:59] married to.
[42:03] So God would allow tragedies and and
[42:06] tragic situations just so he can bless
[42:09] you.
[42:11] Somebody say hallelujah.
[42:13] Oh my. If you're going through
[42:14] something, hallelujah. It could be just
[42:17] so God can bless you.
[42:20] Man, I thought I was going to get more
[42:21] worship than that.
[42:24] I thought I was going to get more think
[42:25] it's easier than that. You mean I'm
[42:27] going through a trial just so God can
[42:30] show me that he's God?
[42:32] You mean my finances are jacked up just
[42:35] so God can show me how blessed he is? So
[42:38] he can show me he's a provider.
[42:44] I don't know about y'all. I don't know.
[42:45] I don't know why this thought came on my
[42:47] mind, but while I was coming down here,
[42:49] I was thinking about that
[42:53] Maserati. I must got a spirit on me cuz
[42:56] they was zooming down. I zoom zoom zoom
[42:58] zoom. I said, "Well, if I was in my
[43:00] mazy,
[43:05] I pray for me." Amen.
[43:10] But we look at tragedy and tragic
[43:12] situations when it's just God.
[43:15] Hallelujah. It's just growth by pruning.
[43:20] Let's keep going. He said Job's home and
[43:24] children was all killed and everything
[43:26] and all Job had was destroyed. God
[43:29] wasn't rebuking Job. He was only purging
[43:33] Job. Amen. I like that word, a purge.
[43:37] The branch that bears fruit when God
[43:39] purges it that it'll bring forth more
[43:41] fruit. The trouble of it is we think
[43:44] sometime God's angry with us. But he's
[43:47] only trying to purge us that will bring
[43:51] abundance of fruit, church. Not just any
[43:53] kind of fruit. Abundance of fruit.
[43:57] Hallelujah. Sometimes things that happen
[43:59] just just so God can get you to speak
[44:01] the word over it.
[44:04] Some friends of mine in the UK,
[44:05] Hallelujah. The sister, she she planted
[44:08] a pear tree. Y'all might have heard this
[44:10] before. She planted a pear tree, but the
[44:13] pear tree as it grew and grew and grew,
[44:15] it would never push out past
[44:18] and she was like, "I know I planted a
[44:19] pear tree." So one day, hallelujah,
[44:22] after hearing the word and and the
[44:24] substance of the truth being preached,
[44:26] one day she walked up to the
[44:30] tree. She walked up to the tree and she
[44:32] said, "I planted you to give me pears
[44:36] and if you don't give me no pairs, I'mma
[44:39] cut you down next
[44:42] season." When the next season came
[44:44] around, that thing start pushing out
[44:45] pairs from
[44:49] everywhere. Hallelujah. Why? Because it
[44:52] heard its maker speak.
[44:55] And God was in that little frail woman.
[44:57] Hallelujah. And church to this day.
[45:00] Hallelujah. That tree pushed out so many
[45:02] pairs to the branches start falling off.
[45:08] And I just got back from there. It's
[45:10] still pushing out past.
[45:13] All God is trying to get you to do is
[45:16] speak the word over your situation.
[45:19] Stop crying, stop muring, complaining,
[45:21] and speak the word. Lord, I claim my
[45:25] family. Lord, I claim a better job.
[45:28] Lord, I claim a greater understanding.
[45:32] Amen. Speak the word. That's right.
[45:34] Lord, give me Hallelujah. strength over
[45:37] the spirit.
[45:39] Lord, I claim my healing.
[45:42] Amen.
[45:44] Hallelujah.
[45:48] Oh
[45:50] my. Every bit of paracoba or parad this
[45:54] or par that come from that tree.
[45:57] Everybody in the church eating off that
[45:59] tree now.
[46:02] Oh my.
[46:04] The branch the branch that bears fruit
[46:06] then God purges it that it'll bring
[46:08] forth more fruit. The trouble of it is
[46:10] we think God sometimes angry with us but
[46:12] he's only trying to purge us that we'll
[46:14] bring abundance of fruit giving us a few
[46:16] trials. The Bible said that they they're
[46:19] worth more to you than precious gold.
[46:23] Did you ever know that every son that
[46:25] cometh to God must first be tried?
[46:28] Whipped, childhipped, correction.
[46:31] Whipped.
[46:33] Whip mean
[46:35] hurts. Whip means it gets into your
[46:38] muscle memory.
[46:40] You give a child a real good Oh, I
[46:42] forgot.
[46:45] Come on. It's all right. We got these
[46:47] new age parents.
[46:52] You better stop it.
[46:54] I'm going to put you in timeout.
[46:58] I'm going to count one, two, three. I
[47:00] guarantee you you always get to three.
[47:04] If you one of them one, two, three
[47:06] parents, I guarantee you, you always get
[47:08] to three.
[47:11] I hate to tell you this, to your child,
[47:13] you a joke. And they know one you ain't
[47:16] going to do nothing. They know two you
[47:18] ain't going to do nothing and they know
[47:19] three you just going to walk to them.
[47:24] So you think about that next time you
[47:25] get into the one two
[47:26] three. One
[47:29] they
[47:40] two my mama my mama her first name is
[47:44] Zora. And y'all heard me say this
[47:46] before. Her first name was And now that
[47:48] we all save, I I can say things like
[47:50] this to her. And I just said this the
[47:52] other day. I said, "Hey, if we was being
[47:54] raised in this generation, you'll be in
[47:56] jail.
[48:01] The whippons we got,
[48:04] no, I said whippons, not spankings.
[48:07] The whippons we got because we were
[48:09] wrong. Now today's society calls child a
[48:15] My mama, her name is Anora and I class
[48:17] she was like
[48:18] Zoro whenever something happened.
[48:24] It like it's like her belt was never it
[48:27] like it was never on. It was
[48:36] always not paying attention in church
[48:39] man.
[48:41] Please go to sleep. Get water breaks.
[48:43] Man,
[48:47] please church. I was a grown man sitting
[48:50] in church and she threw a book at
[48:57] me. I was sitting in church like this. I
[49:01] wasn't sleep. I just had my head down.
[49:03] Oh no. And next thing
[49:07] you I'm
[49:10] like, "You better wake
[49:13] up." And I couldn't pull that I'm grown
[49:18] card cuz that I'm that I'm grown card
[49:21] would have got me embarrassed in church.
[49:27] I couldn't hit her back because then the
[49:28] whole church will jump on me.
[49:33] That's right. That's the community we
[49:35] raised up
[49:37] in. But now they Oh, bless they hard. Oh
[49:40] my goodness.
[49:44] You You do whatever God tell you
[49:46] do. Like I tell her, I said, "I been,
[49:48] you boy, you be locked. You be locked
[49:51] all the way up some of the stuff you
[49:54] did."
[49:55] And she just smiled and laughed and say,
[49:58] "It got you where you at, didn't it?
[50:00] That's right. So, you know what I do? I
[50:02] say, "Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[50:05] Hallelujah. Because I got friends who
[50:06] didn't have that discipline. Some of
[50:08] them are dead. Some of them without the
[50:11] parties and and and did the wrong drugs
[50:14] and now they out of their minds.
[50:19] So, I thank God for a parent, a
[50:22] God-fearing parent. Hallelujah. Who
[50:24] warned me put tattoos on my body as a
[50:27] young man. who told me, hallelujah,
[50:29] homosexuals wanted their ears pierced
[50:31] before it got to where it's at now.
[50:36] And I never catch none of y'all walk in
[50:38] my house period ears.
[50:46] And there was a little bit came with
[50:47] that because she was security guard
[50:50] at a nuclear
[50:52] plant. So she had on the whole gear,
[50:56] nice stick, mace, gun, handcuffs, it
[50:58] all. Say if you try me, I'mma spray you
[51:01] first and then I'mma go to work on you,
[51:11] boy. I was just real talk. I love my
[51:14] mama death. Real talk. This is why I'm
[51:17] saved.
[51:21] And she was so bad. She used to bring
[51:23] the gunshot home and all you see is
[51:25] bullets in the head and in the heart.
[51:30] Now, I didn't believe she'd shoot me,
[51:31] but I wasn't willing to try
[51:37] because she had some real substance.
[51:40] Hallelujah. And that's what the world is
[51:42] missing today. Real substance.
[51:44] Hallelujah. A revance for life, a
[51:47] revengeance for family, a rev for God.
[51:51] Hallelujah. Amen. Let me get out of
[51:52] this. I need to close
[51:57] now. Don't go home and slap your child
[51:59] across the head cuz Brother
[52:01] Dig,
[52:04] don't let God lead
[52:08] you. The Bible say, "Provoke not your
[52:11] children to wrath." All right, everybody
[52:14] with me?
[52:16] Listen, I want to read you something
[52:18] real quick and I'm gonna try to get out
[52:20] of the way.
[52:23] Listen, this is I love this quote right
[52:26] here. This This is uh How can I
[52:29] overcome? Is this the one I want? No, I
[52:31] don't want that one. I want the one uh
[52:33] the power of God
[52:38] 1955. He said, "Think we have an
[52:42] anchor."
[52:43] Amen. That's in the veil. We can see it
[52:47] sometimes, but we know it's there. We
[52:50] can't see it sometimes, but we know it's
[52:51] there. Listen to this
[52:53] church. Like the little boy was flying
[52:56] the kite. They said, "Where is
[52:59] it?" said, "I can't see it." Said, "I
[53:03] know it's still there cuz I feel it."
[53:05] Hallelujah.
[53:07] Hallelujah. Church, even if you're going
[53:09] through a trial, hallelujah. Sometimes
[53:11] God feel like that kite, but it's still
[53:14] there. How do you know? Cuz you can feel
[53:16] it tug every now and then. You can feel
[53:19] something. Say, "Go pray. It'll be all
[53:20] right." You can feel something when you
[53:22] get to church. Sing that special I put
[53:24] on your heart. What is it? That's the
[53:25] kite still connected. That's God still
[53:28] connected to you. Hallelujah. And
[53:30] sometimes all it takes is just a little
[53:32] tug to let you know he's still with you.
[53:37] Hallelujah. I don't know about you,
[53:39] church, but all I need is that little
[53:41] tug sometimes. Hallelujah. All I need is
[53:43] to come to church and hear the pastor or
[53:45] the ministry speak just a little bit on
[53:48] my situation. What is that? That's That
[53:50] means I'm still connected to the kite.
[53:53] What is God saying tonight that your
[53:56] kite is still connected?
[53:59] God's trying to get somebody a tongue
[54:01] tonight to let you know he's still with
[54:03] you. Nobody can see it, but it's still
[54:06] there.
[54:08] Brother, this generation don't even know
[54:10] what it's like to fly kites.
[54:13] I do.
[54:15] I'm talking about the younger people. We
[54:17] know.
[54:21] I'm about your kids. Hallelujah. We
[54:24] know. We couldn't wait for March. Cuz
[54:25] I'm a March baby. When it's what they
[54:28] call March, the windy month. And we go
[54:30] by kites.
[54:33] Amen. Someone looking at me like what's
[54:34] a
[54:41] sister? They don't even know what is
[54:46] some of the cleanest fun you could ever
[54:48] have.
[54:51] Some plastic and a couple pins and some
[54:53] rope on your arm running down the
[54:55] street.
[54:59] Man, you talking about fun. We used to
[55:01] have a blast.
[55:05] But now y'all fun ain't got no substance
[55:06] to it. Locked up in a room.
[55:16] Ain't no memories in that.
[55:18] I got it on fire,
[55:22] man.
[55:25] Please let me go. He said, "I know it's
[55:28] still there cuz I can feel it."
[55:30] Everybody all right? I think I got the
[55:32] longest drive tonight.
[55:36] So that's right. We may not be able to
[55:38] see it. Times get dark. The clouds may
[55:41] hide his blessings, his blessed face for
[55:44] a spell. But remember, the clouds may
[55:46] hide his face, but it don't hide him.
[55:50] Hallelujah. It can hide the sun from
[55:52] you, but it's still shining beyond the
[55:55] clouds. And faith sees the sun beyond
[55:58] the clouds. Oh my. And here was Moses
[56:03] mother in the conflict of testing of her
[56:06] faith. And every child, every son that
[56:08] cometh to God first must be tried. God
[56:12] test your faith. Now look like God. Now
[56:17] this right here is some real substance
[56:20] right here. I I don't want y'all to miss
[56:22] this. Listen to this. He says, "Now look
[56:25] like God could just simply bypass the
[56:28] whole thing and don't have any
[56:31] appropriate way."
[56:33] Instead of sending you through a trial,
[56:35] God could just give it to you, couldn't
[56:37] he? But remember, when he first started,
[56:40] he said, "I'm not going to drive him by
[56:42] the land. You going to do it. You're
[56:45] going to appreciate building houses in
[56:47] this land. You're going to appreciate
[56:49] eating those giant fruit." Amen.
[56:52] See, because when you do it, there's
[56:54] more gratitude about it. Ain't it? For
[56:57] for those of us who allow our kids to
[56:59] get jobs and you let them buy their own
[57:01] car, they'll appreciate that thing much
[57:03] more than driving yours.
[57:06] They'll get in your car. It ain't even a
[57:07] stick shift. And they'll be
[57:13] downshifting. Let me see what it can do.
[57:15] Let me see if I can
[57:17] [Music]
[57:20] drill. and it tear up. They'd be like,
[57:23] "Dad, mom, you got to fix it. Tow up on
[57:25] me, but let them buy it. Let them have
[57:29] to pay that $1,500 to fix it. I
[57:31] guarantee they'll treat it different."
[57:37] Hallelujah.
[57:39] Listen, he
[57:42] says the appropriate way and just cut
[57:44] the thing off. But it's better that he
[57:47] gives you a test. And listen to this.
[57:50] It's better that he gives you a test and
[57:52] then comes to you when you're in the
[57:55] test.
[57:56] [Music]
[58:00] Oh my. So, you know what I want
[58:01] everybody to do that's being tested?
[58:04] When you get home, I want you to start
[58:06] doing this.
[58:08] Amen. The prophet say it's better for
[58:11] him to give you a test and then for you
[58:13] to look for him coming to you on the
[58:16] test.
[58:18] I want everybody to start looking for
[58:20] him because he has a purpose.
[58:22] Hallelujah. The test is supposed to
[58:24] reveal more of him. Hallelujah. He could
[58:27] easily just send you through it and
[58:29] bring you out on the other side. No. H.
[58:31] What he does send you through the test
[58:33] and then he shows up.
[58:36] He let the He let the Hebrew boys
[58:38] Hallelujah. They had to step in the
[58:40] furnace before God came.
[58:42] Just testifying about God wasn't good
[58:44] enough. They had to get in the fire.
[58:47] Once they got in the fire, their clothes
[58:49] didn't burn. Their shoes didn't burn.
[58:52] Their skin didn't burn. Their hair
[58:54] didn't burn. And then God stepped in
[58:56] there with them. H. And the whole world
[58:58] begin to testify. We see the fourth man.
[59:04] We see the fourth man in your trial with
[59:07] you.
[59:10] Think about it, church. Hallelujah.
[59:12] Daniel had to go into the lion's den and
[59:14] those lions were hungry. And then God
[59:17] came into the trial with him just to put
[59:19] his hands on their mouth.
[59:23] Amen. My good. Oh my. He said it's
[59:28] better that he gives you a test and then
[59:30] comes to you when you're in the test. I
[59:33] like that. Don't you?
[59:36] It's better. I'm going to say it again.
[59:37] It's better for him to give you a test
[59:39] and then comes to you in the test. I
[59:41] like that. Don't you?
[59:43] I like that. Don't you? I like that.
[59:47] Don't you? But this, what do you like
[59:49] being tested and then God comes to me on
[59:52] the test? I like that. Don't you?
[59:57] Amen.
[59:59] Hallelujah. Amen. We're going to look at
[1:00:01] this thing different.
[1:00:03] Yes, sir.
[1:00:07] He said, "The greatest experience of my
[1:00:09] life is when I come up against a
[1:00:11] mountain that I can't get over it, under
[1:00:14] it, or around it, and just stand still."
[1:00:18] And God will move the thing back, and he
[1:00:21] will move no matter how dark the cloud
[1:00:23] is. Faith pierces it yonder with a eye
[1:00:27] that looks beyond anything the devil
[1:00:30] can't set before you. Cuz God is our
[1:00:33] victory.
[1:00:35] Come on, musicians. Somebody say it with
[1:00:37] me. God is our victory.
[1:00:40] God is our victory
[1:00:44] in every test. God our victory.
[1:00:50] So I don't mind That's right. growth by
[1:00:53] pruning. That's right.
[1:00:56] Because the Bible says everything that
[1:00:58] can be shook will be shaken.
[1:01:01] but for the benefit of the believers
[1:01:05] because everything that's meant to stand
[1:01:06] will stand. But he got to shake
[1:01:09] everything that's not needed to be here
[1:01:11] first. And there's some things in our
[1:01:13] life that God don't need. So what does
[1:01:15] he do? He shake us up. Hallelujah. Cuz
[1:01:18] you notice what a hurricane does? First
[1:01:21] thing a hurricane does, it breaks loose
[1:01:23] everything that's already loose. Amen.
[1:01:27] If your
[1:01:28] roof has been up there too long, trust
[1:01:32] me, you going to be calling the
[1:01:33] insurance company
[1:01:35] cuz the hurricane going to expose it. If
[1:01:39] your tree hadn't gone deep enough, trust
[1:01:41] me, you either going to be removing it
[1:01:42] or replanting it because the winds of
[1:01:46] that hurricane is going to expose it.
[1:01:48] And that's what God does. He exposed the
[1:01:51] deep and fragile areas in our life by
[1:01:54] giving us a test only to make us go
[1:01:58] deeper, only to make us stronger.
[1:02:05] Hallelujah. Let's
[1:02:08] pray. Let's go back to
[1:02:11] that. Oh, go back to that key. That same
[1:02:14] key you added in.
[1:02:18] Oh, nobody like you,
[1:02:23] Lord. Nobody like you,
[1:02:27] Lord. Everybody say,
[1:02:32] "Oh."
[1:02:34] Oh, you are my healer. You are my
[1:02:38] healer,
[1:02:40] Lord. You are my healer, Lord.
[1:02:46] Everybody say,
[1:02:49] "Oh,
[1:02:51] oh, you're my provider, Lord. You're my
[1:02:55] provider,
[1:02:58] Lord. You're my provider,
[1:03:02] Lord."
[1:03:07] Everybody's,
[1:03:09] "Oh, you're my deliverer, Lord. You're
[1:03:13] my deliverer.
[1:03:16] Oh, you're my
[1:03:20] deliverer.
[1:03:25] Everybody's
[1:03:26] Oh, nobody like you,
[1:03:29] Lord. Nobody like you, Lord. Nobody like

[1:09:52] Lord, thank you for your goodness.
[1:09:55] Thank you for every setback,
[1:09:58] for every trial, every
[1:10:00] tribulation, everything, Lord, that
[1:10:02] you're doing to make us strong. Lord, we
[1:10:04] give you thanks and we say blessed be
[1:10:07] the name of the Lord. Father, though we
[1:10:09] may not understand everything, but we
[1:10:12] know we serve a God that is in control.
[1:10:15] We know we serve a God that is
[1:10:17] intentional. We serve a God who is
[1:10:21] purpose driven. And Lord, we know you
[1:10:24] won't stop until you see the full
[1:10:26] fulfillment in our life. Lord, till
[1:10:28] we're all made worthy of eternal life on
[1:10:31] this side. So Lord, we thank you for the
[1:10:35] pruning, Lord. the cutting away of
[1:10:37] diseases and hurts, Lord, and pains and
[1:10:41] fungi, Lord, and all the infections,
[1:10:44] Lord, spiritually in our lives. Lord, we
[1:10:48] give those things unto you right now
[1:10:50] because there's nobody like you, Lord.
[1:10:53] Lord, and at the sound of our voice, we
[1:10:55] bind every demon power that's been
[1:10:58] oppressing your people. We bind the
[1:11:00] demons of this of this world, Lord, of
[1:11:03] this age that are after our children,
[1:11:07] the demons of
[1:11:09] sexuality, the the the lion spirits, the
[1:11:12] influences of the world. We bind them
[1:11:14] right now in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:11:18] Lord, we pray for peace in our
[1:11:21] marriages,
[1:11:23] peace in our homes, peace on our job,
[1:11:26] peace in our church because you are
[1:11:29] Jehovah Shalom.

[1:11:34] Lord, that we receive that
[1:11:36] peace cuz there's nobody like you, Lord.
[1:11:39] Lord, and we pray that in this church,
[1:11:42] there'd be such an anointing, Lord, that
[1:11:45] when the people come, their burdens are
[1:11:47] lifted as soon as they step through the
[1:11:50] doors, Lord, that the worship will be so
[1:11:53] anointed, it'll be like David. It'll
[1:11:55] break yolks. And when the preacher
[1:11:57] comes, he won't even be able to minister
[1:11:59] because of your presence.
[1:12:02] Lord, that you'll speak, lift the ear to
[1:12:04] your people.
[1:12:06] You're still the
[1:12:07] same, Lord. And we count ourselves
[1:12:11] privileged to serve a God like
[1:12:14] you. A God who died and rose. A God who
[1:12:18] went down to hell and took control of
[1:12:21] hell, death, and the grave. And Lord,
[1:12:24] just to know you are in control of my
[1:12:27] hell. Hallelujah.
[1:12:30] Lord, I give you praise
[1:12:33] cuz you are so worthy.
[1:12:36] You are so worthy. Lord, we bless your
[1:12:37] holy name in the wonderful name of Jesus
[1:12:41] Christ. We pray Lord we pray for
[1:12:43] traveling mercies Lord and every
[1:12:46] request Lord that would go forth Lord we
[1:12:49] pray for it right now Lord Lord God to

[1:13:05] them the favor of the trial Lord God
[1:13:08] that you could easily Lord not let us go
[1:13:11] through it, but Lord, you'd rather take
[1:13:12] us through it and then show up with us,

[1:14:38] [Applause]
[1:14:41] Jesus. Amen. We have some needs we want
[1:14:44] to get to. Want to read that came in and
[1:14:47] Brother Diggs just pray over them. Just
[1:14:49] want to read them to you. Good morning,
[1:14:50] brother. Uh I'd like to add my little
[1:14:53] grandson, Lane, to our prayer request
[1:14:55] tonight. I didn't add him last week
[1:14:56] because he seemed like things were
[1:14:58] getting better, but he was admitted to
[1:15:00] Al Dupont Children's Hospital in
[1:15:03] Wilmington, Delaware. I want to make
[1:15:05] sure I get that right. About a week ago,
[1:15:07] he couldn't breathe. They found for some
[1:15:09] reason, this is from Brother Joe Carter.
[1:15:12] Uh they found out he could he couldn't
[1:15:14] breathe. They found for some reason air
[1:15:15] pockets around his heart. I have no clue
[1:15:17] what would cause that, but he was
[1:15:19] discharged after they got his breathing
[1:15:22] under control. and he's back in with it
[1:15:25] again. Poor little guy. Can't breathe
[1:15:26] right now. I don't know if his if his uh
[1:15:30] bout with COVID is related to this. His
[1:15:32] bout with CO is related to this. He did
[1:15:34] have CO about 6 months ago, but we
[1:15:36] figured all was gone. This is something
[1:15:38] completely new. I've never heard of air
[1:15:40] around the heart being trapped. So, I
[1:15:41] don't know what the condition is or what
[1:15:42] to call it. We just like to have prayer
[1:15:45] for him. Amen. That's from Brother Joe's
[1:15:47] grandson, Lane. Want to remember him
[1:15:50] tonight. Um, my brother Chris, who's not
[1:15:54] here tonight, sent in a prayer request
[1:15:56] for him. He's had a migraine uh since he
[1:15:58] woke up all day. He's tried everything
[1:16:00] to get relief. Um, and he's streaming
[1:16:02] here tonight. So, we're going to pray
[1:16:04] the Lord gives him relief. Amen. Uh,
[1:16:07] also, this is from Sister Meredith. Mom
[1:16:09] is scheduled to have a heart cath on
[1:16:11] Friday to see if they can find the cause
[1:16:12] of the aphib. Please have the church
[1:16:15] pray for strength for mom. A smooth
[1:16:17] procedure with the Lord guiding the
[1:16:19] doctor's hand. and this will give the
[1:16:21] doctor the correct direction to go with
[1:16:23] her treatment and while he's there maybe
[1:16:25] be able to fix the problem if the Lord
[1:16:27] wills it. We want to believe for that
[1:16:29] and pray for that. I also want to
[1:16:32] remember I guess this was sent in but uh
[1:16:34] my dad our pastor's ministering away um
[1:16:37] there in Ramsir, North Carolina. So we
[1:16:39] just want to be remembering them as they
[1:16:41] travel. Amen. Maybe I don't see any more
[1:16:43] but maybe have you have something upon
[1:16:45] your heart you just want to represent
[1:16:47] that. Just raise a hand up to the Lord.
[1:16:49] and say, "Lord, here's my need." Amen.
[1:16:51] You believe the Lord Jesus is here
[1:16:53] present right now. Amen. I believe that
[1:16:55] we've heard the word of God preached.
[1:16:57] Amen. And can just sense him, sense that
[1:16:59] kite, that other end, that pulling.
[1:17:02] Amen. Feel his presence. So, we just
[1:17:03] want to join our faith together. Why
[1:17:05] don't you put your arm over on somebody?
[1:17:07] We said it last Wednesday. We'll say it
[1:17:09] again. Don't let brother Diggs be the
[1:17:11] only voice. Let God hear your voice.
[1:17:13] Amen. The Bible says, "Let the redeemed
[1:17:15] of the Lord say so." So, as brother
[1:17:17] Diggs begins to pray, you begin to call
[1:17:19] on the name of the Lord. Brother Digs,
[1:17:21] come take up these needs. Amen. Let's I
[1:17:24] don't know if you'll remember them all,
[1:17:26] but all of them. Okay.
[1:17:28] Okay. And saints, I want y'all to uh
[1:17:31] remember me in prayer. It's uh like like
[1:17:34] I say, I'm preaching by experience. I
[1:17:36] every time I feel like I hit a level
[1:17:39] where everything is running smooth, I
[1:17:41] live off the gospel and then something
[1:17:44] comes where it seems like it's a
[1:17:45] overflow and I be wondering where I'm
[1:17:46] going to get it from. But God is
[1:17:49] faithful
[1:17:50] and I'm talking about in the financial
[1:17:52] area. I I need some real substance. But
[1:17:55] again, God is faithful and he's always
[1:17:58] been my provider. You know, I've been
[1:18:00] doing this for a a long time, and God
[1:18:03] has always come through and I I I need I
[1:18:06] want him I need him to come through with
[1:18:09] an abundance
[1:18:10] and I believe he can do it. I've seen
[1:18:12] him do it, you know. So, just keep me
[1:18:15] and family in your prayers as we pray
[1:18:18] for this. Amen. Lord Jesus,
[1:18:21] Father, we approach your throne of
[1:18:23] grace, but first of all, we want to
[1:18:26] acknowledge, Lord, we're coming through
[1:18:28] the provided way. We're coming through
[1:18:30] that blood, Lord. Yes, God. That blood
[1:18:32] that's atoning over every life, over
[1:18:34] every request right now, Lord. Lord God,
[1:18:37] and we pray, Father, that you cover
[1:18:39] every situation, Lord Jesus, through
[1:18:42] that that that eternal infinite blood.
[1:18:46] Lord, that purges our lives, Lord. And
[1:18:49] Father, we have requests for heart
[1:18:51] conditions. And Lord, I stand here as a
[1:18:54] witness. My very own son had a heart
[1:18:57] murmur for 10 years. And Lord, you
[1:19:00] delivered. Lord, you took the hole out
[1:19:02] of his heart. And Lord, we put this same
[1:19:05] heart condition of this young man, Lord.
[1:19:08] Lord, that if you did it for my child,
[1:19:09] you can do it for their child because
[1:19:11] you're the same, Lord. And you say we
[1:19:13] are to be identified with Bible
[1:19:15] characters. Not only just the characters
[1:19:17] in the Bible, but we're the living word.
[1:19:20] So, Father, we can be identified with
[1:19:22] the lives that are walking on this
[1:19:24] earth, Lord. And Lord, we pray for
[1:19:26] headaches, Lord. And Father, seems like
[1:19:28] the brother can't get rid of it, but
[1:19:30] Lord, you're our sustaining power, Lord.
[1:19:33] You You say you're the Lord, thy God,
[1:19:34] that health thee, Lord. Lord, and and
[1:19:37] and even the pastor, Lord, he's out
[1:19:38] preaching the gospel, Lord. Be with him,
[1:19:41] Lord. God, that you'd move him out the
[1:19:43] way, Lord, and he'd be a mouthpiece for
[1:19:45] the for those people, Lord, and every
[1:19:47] other request, Lord. Lord, you know, you
[1:19:49] know the need, Lord. And Father, help us
[1:19:51] to be like Job, Father, as we're going
[1:19:53] through that more revelation is unveiled
[1:19:56] and we're able to give you thanks, Lord,
[1:19:58] in the midst of all of it, Lord. Whether
[1:20:00] it's a a a sickness, Lord, or personal
[1:20:03] issue or a lack or a need, Father, we
[1:20:06] know that you are more than able. And
[1:20:09] Lord, we take our cares unto you because
[1:20:11] your your burden is light. Your yoke,
[1:20:13] your yoke is is easy, Father, according
[1:20:16] to what your word says, Lord. Lord, we
[1:20:18] take you at your word. Yes, Lord. Lord,
[1:20:21] you said you couldn't swear by no
[1:20:22] greater, so you swear by yourself. So,
[1:20:24] in the name of Jesus Christ, we bring
[1:20:27] every request unto you. Lord, in your
[1:20:30] name we pray, Lord, and even the
[1:20:32] unspoken request, Lord, there are people
[1:20:35] in here right now praying over their
[1:20:36] children. Their children who have gone
[1:20:39] away withward, Lord. Lord, we know that
[1:20:41] you're still in control. Lord, that
[1:20:43] there are family situations being prayed
[1:20:45] for right now. That there are children
[1:20:47] in this room, the parents are praying
[1:20:49] for right now, Lord God, that you would
[1:20:52] touch that need, Lord, and move every
[1:20:54] cloud away so we can see the kite is
[1:20:57] still there. We know that you're still
[1:20:59] there, Lord. Lord, touch it in the
