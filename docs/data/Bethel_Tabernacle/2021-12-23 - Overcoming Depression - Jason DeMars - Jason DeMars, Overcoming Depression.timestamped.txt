[20:46] i feel like a human being again
[20:50] a complete human being again
[20:52] was was half of one i think for the last
[20:55] couple weeks
[20:56] so thank you to everyone that
[20:58] helped me and and and took care of me
[21:00] appreciate you all and amy's parents are
[21:03] doing much better
[21:04] there's still some way to recovery to go
[21:07] but thank the lord they're out of out of
[21:09] the danger dangerous place and
[21:12] and um just on the road to recovery so
[21:14] pray continue to pray for them
[21:16] amen so i'm going to
[21:19] speak on a subject tonight overcoming
[21:22] depression
[21:24] and the scripture that i'm going to
[21:25] start with is proverbs 12
[21:28] 25.
[21:30] and i'm not sure if you can pull it up
[21:32] back there but i'm going to read from
[21:33] the
[21:35] nkjv
[21:37] if you can't no problem
[21:38] you'll see it there in the kjv
[21:41] and i'll read to you the nkjv
[21:46] anxiety in the heart of man
[21:49] causes
[21:50] depression
[21:52] but a good word makes it glad
[21:55] amen may the lord have the blessing to
[21:56] the reading of his word you can be
[21:57] seated
[22:01] so write in that verse if you want to
[22:02] leave that verse up for me brother
[22:05] right in that verse we have the problem
[22:09] the source of the problem
[22:12] and
[22:13] the solution to the problem we read the
[22:15] word we can close and go home it's over
[22:18] with
[22:21] but
[22:22] the reality is
[22:24] the reality is there's there's a lot
[22:26] there's a lot to it
[22:28] and that there's a lot that goes along
[22:29] with that
[22:31] but yeah you see their heaviness
[22:33] in the heart of man makes it stoop it's
[22:36] a it's a beautiful picture
[22:38] or a terrible picture
[22:41] of what depression is really
[22:43] but it's a it's a it's a good picture
[22:45] that's painted
[22:46] their anxiety
[22:48] in the heart so in other words anxiety
[22:51] produces
[22:52] depression and the anxiety that we have
[22:56] can have
[22:57] lots of different sources
[23:00] so what does anxiety mean
[23:02] i think we all know what it means
[23:05] it comes in heaviness doesn't it
[23:08] sometimes you even feel such a heavy
[23:10] feeling in your spirit
[23:12] in your just bodily you feel that heavy
[23:14] feeling inside of you
[23:16] but in
[23:18] webster's dictionary it says concern
[23:21] respecting some event
[23:23] future or uncertain which disturbs the
[23:26] mind and keeps it in a state of painful
[23:29] uneasiness
[23:30] it expresses more than uneasiness or
[23:32] disturbance and even more than trouble
[23:34] or
[23:35] solicitude it usually springs from fear
[23:37] or serious amp apprehension of evil
[23:41] and involves a suspense respecting an
[23:43] event and often a perplexity of mind to
[23:45] know how to shape our conduct i would
[23:48] say it's not just
[23:49] anxiety isn't just something that
[23:51] speaks of something in the future
[23:54] it can also be something that's happened
[23:55] to you in the past
[23:57] and you can take something that's
[23:58] happened to you in the past
[24:00] and and push that forward that's gonna
[24:02] happen again that's going to this is
[24:03] going to take place again and it
[24:05] produces
[24:06] anxiety inside of you
[24:08] and when that anxiety takes root
[24:11] inside of you what does it lead to
[24:14] depression
[24:19] so
[24:20] just a few things here
[24:23] we're living in one we're living in an
[24:26] age
[24:27] that is afflicted with anxiety
[24:31] or as brother branham called it a
[24:33] neurotic
[24:34] age
[24:38] two just because you're a holy ghost
[24:40] filled
[24:41] believer doesn't mean you don't
[24:44] experience anxiety and depression
[24:47] brother branham did
[24:51] it's clear through the message that
[24:53] depression
[24:55] comes via an evil spirit if you go
[24:57] through and read i read many many of the
[24:59] prayer lines
[25:00] and brother branham clearly over and
[25:02] over again
[25:03] calls it a demon of nervousness or a
[25:06] spirit of nervousness or a spirit of
[25:09] depression
[25:11] he says
[25:12] it's a shadow of misty darkness that
[25:15] would hang over a person that's not to
[25:17] say that there isn't there couldn't be a
[25:19] physical
[25:20] aspect to that but even so that demon
[25:23] works through the physical aspect
[25:26] to lead you to anxiety and depression
[25:31] there is a spiritual war taking place
[25:35] we can't forget that earth
[25:37] is the scene
[25:39] of a great cosmic
[25:41] battle that's taking place
[25:43] satan wants to control and operate
[25:46] through
[25:47] man
[25:48] and he works on his mind
[25:51] god seeks to control and operate through
[25:54] man also but he works through changing
[25:57] his heart
[25:59] amen
[26:01] satan once satan has access
[26:04] to the mind he starts to
[26:06] work
[26:07] and he will prevent god from working in
[26:09] your life
[26:14] many times
[26:16] satan can bring a spirit of depression
[26:19] on someone that would
[26:21] prevent them from repenting
[26:24] and making things right
[26:26] leading them to be released from that
[26:28] spirit
[26:29] of depression satan wants control
[26:32] and if you repent
[26:34] what happens
[26:35] he loses control
[26:37] there could be and i'm not trying to put
[26:39] paint a blanket picture that you're
[26:41] depressed because you have sin in your
[26:43] life
[26:44] that could be
[26:46] that could be but that doesn't mean it's
[26:48] the only reason we'll talk we'll look at
[26:49] that
[26:52] so i and i think
[26:54] god's word
[26:56] defines depress and we have to be
[26:57] careful here because
[26:59] in our day
[27:01] everybody's talking about mental health
[27:03] it's in advertisements it's on
[27:04] television it's on facebook that's good
[27:08] but i think they don't understand they
[27:10] don't understand the real
[27:13] source
[27:14] they don't
[27:15] understand the real definition
[27:17] of it they have their own definition so
[27:20] if you look at
[27:21] mayo clinic it says a mood disorder that
[27:23] causes
[27:24] a persistent feeling of sadness and loss
[27:27] of interest
[27:28] also called major depressive disorder or
[27:31] clinical depression it affects how you
[27:33] feel think and behave and can lead to a
[27:35] variety of emotional and physical
[27:37] problems
[27:38] whether while there can be medical
[27:39] conditions that cause or contribute to
[27:41] depression from the point of view of the
[27:43] bible
[27:44] uh
[27:47] so that that's the end of the definition
[27:49] behave and can lead to a variety variety
[27:50] of emotional physical problems
[27:53] definitely definitely that that can be
[27:55] true
[27:56] but remember we're made up of body soul
[27:59] and spirit
[28:00] amen
[28:01] so depression comes as a result of
[28:03] impacts
[28:04] things on each aspect of you as a person
[28:08] physically
[28:10] spirit in your spirit which is speaking
[28:12] of your attributes of your mind
[28:15] or your soul
[28:16] satan will attack each parts of those
[28:18] places
[28:19] things happen in our life that impact
[28:22] each part of those places
[28:24] and if you don't if you if you treat a
[28:27] human being just as a as a physical
[28:30] brain
[28:32] and a physical body
[28:34] you won't treat the real problem
[28:37] that a person is facing
[28:39] you can treat part of it
[28:41] but you can never get to the root of
[28:44] what the problem is
[28:47] definitely
[28:48] physical maladies can produce
[28:51] depression there's no question about
[28:53] that but again
[28:56] unless we approach that correctly
[29:00] i don't want to get into talking about
[29:01] drugs and
[29:03] they okay
[29:06] you need me to use this
[29:08] oh no that's terrible
[29:19] are we on
[29:20] all right
[29:22] all right so
[29:25] people that are facing depression
[29:28] need help
[29:30] i think we can tend to be
[29:32] not everyone but a lot of people around
[29:33] the message can be
[29:36] super spiritual
[29:37] and if you talk about feeling depressed
[29:39] oh my goodness this person's so weak
[29:42] this person's got real problems in their
[29:44] lives and there's a stigma that goes
[29:46] along with
[29:47] even talking about that at all
[29:49] and that's to me that's terrible because
[29:51] that's what the body of christ is for
[29:53] that's what we're here for is to help
[29:55] each other
[29:56] through what we're going through
[29:59] we're not here to tear people down
[30:01] throw people under the bus or say
[30:02] there's something wrong with you because
[30:03] you're depressed
[30:05] all of us
[30:06] live in a human body
[30:08] depression is not
[30:10] just a medical condition
[30:13] depression is a human condition
[30:15] and it can be on many different levels
[30:19] young kids can experience it
[30:21] elderly people can experience it all of
[30:23] us in between can experience it
[30:25] on different levels some people face it
[30:27] where it's so debilitating they can't
[30:29] even get out of bed
[30:31] all right some people face it where they
[30:34] can live their normal life and you never
[30:36] know
[30:38] you know there's so sad
[30:40] cases where people commit suicide and no
[30:42] one knew anything was wrong not even
[30:44] their spouse
[30:46] it's awful
[30:48] i think i think it's important to say
[30:50] i'll talk about this more later but
[30:53] if you're facing depression you need to
[30:55] find someone you can trust
[30:57] and talk to them
[30:59] sometimes just talking to someone that
[31:01] cares
[31:03] can bring healing
[31:06] so those of us if you're a person that's
[31:08] going to be talked to
[31:10] don't do too much talking
[31:12] mostly do listening
[31:24] you know and it's not it's not a matter
[31:25] of
[31:27] every time
[31:28] someone feels depressed you know you lit
[31:31] in today's day and age you kind of see
[31:33] the the left wing and the right wing
[31:35] political movements
[31:37] the left wing enshrines
[31:39] and almost puts a crown on
[31:42] mental health and mental disorders and
[31:45] sadness and try to find every mental
[31:47] problem that you possibly have
[31:50] and own it
[31:51] we don't want to own that
[31:53] we don't want to crown it
[31:55] we don't want to enshrine it in our
[31:56] lives
[31:58] and then on the right hand it's sort of
[31:59] like oh you guys are a bunch of babies
[32:00] and wimps just toughen up
[32:03] that's not helping anybody either
[32:06] you need indeed there's a balance
[32:09] scripture
[32:10] speaks about
[32:11] men of god the greatest man of god of
[32:13] history
[32:15] feeling deep and terrible depression
[32:19] so
[32:21] if moses was depressed elijah was
[32:23] depressed
[32:25] david
[32:26] jobe
[32:27] jesus
[32:30] brother branham
[32:32] why do we have a sick stigma
[32:34] if someone's depressed there's something
[32:36] wrong with them well yeah there is
[32:38] there's something wrong so help him
[32:42] not something wrong let's kick dirt on
[32:44] them
[32:46] i'm sick of that
[32:48] i'm sick of that and i'm thankful that
[32:50] we're not a church that does that
[32:53] and that we're a place that
[32:54] as best as we can though we may fail
[32:57] many times
[32:59] best as we can we're trying to help
[33:00] people
[33:01] get healing get deliverance
[33:03] and just be there for people
[33:07] depression can come from many many
[33:09] different things
[33:11] it can come from a traumatic event in
[33:13] your life
[33:14] it can come from you having unscriptural
[33:17] expectations of other people
[33:20] it can come from
[33:22] grieving
[33:22] for a loved one that you've you've
[33:25] almost lost hope
[33:29] in life because of your grief
[33:32] fears misplaced shame false guilt
[33:35] unconfessed sin bitterness and hatred
[33:38] that you're suppressing and pushing down
[33:40] all these things can bring
[33:43] depression
[33:46] but there's a cure amen
[33:50] and there's a fountain
[33:53] so let's look at some scriptures i'm
[33:55] going to go through quickly
[33:57] numbers 11
[33:58] 10-16
[34:04] the prophet that god spoke to lip to ear
[34:07] won't just speak to moses
[34:09] in dreams and visions
[34:12] but he speaks face to face to moses
[34:16] so one of the greatest prophets of all
[34:18] history then moses heard the people weep
[34:21] throughout their families every man in
[34:23] the door of his tent
[34:24] and the anger of the lord was greatly
[34:26] kindled
[34:28] moses also was displeased
[34:30] and moses said unto the lord wherefore
[34:32] has thou afflicted thy servant and
[34:34] wherefore have i not found favor in thy
[34:36] sight that thou layest the burden of all
[34:39] this people upon me
[34:41] have i conceived this all this people
[34:43] have i begotten them that thou should
[34:45] have said unto me carry them in thy
[34:46] bosom as a nursing father beareth the
[34:49] suckling child unto the land which thou
[34:51] swear us unto their fathers
[34:53] when should i have flesh to give unto
[34:55] all this people for they weep unto me
[34:56] saying give us flesh that we may eat
[34:58] i'm not able to bear all this people
[35:00] alone because it's too heavy for me
[35:02] and if thou deal with thus with me kill
[35:04] me i pray thee out of hand
[35:06] if i have found favor in thy sight and
[35:08] let me not see my wretchedness
[35:12] and so you see there that's someone
[35:15] who's
[35:16] facing
[35:18] terrible anxiety
[35:20] over what everybody is complaining about
[35:22] everyone's complaining complaining
[35:24] complaining
[35:26] all the responsibilities on me what is
[35:28] what is moses
[35:29] depression from
[35:32] what is it from it's from
[35:34] a false understanding of the situation
[35:38] moses thinks it's all his responsibility
[35:41] god told him from the beginning that was
[35:43] not true and he reiterated that over and
[35:45] over and over again that that was not
[35:47] true but yet moses as a man
[35:51] had a feeling
[35:53] what was it he felt their complaints and
[35:55] it frustrated him his frustrated
[35:58] frustration led him to
[36:00] feel anxiety how am i going to fix the
[36:02] problem
[36:03] instead of praying and saying lord
[36:06] i cannot fix the problem he got anxious
[36:09] and he got angry
[36:11] and then he got depressed
[36:14] and god doesn't condemn him what does he
[36:16] say okay it's too hard for you to bear
[36:18] verse 16 and the lord said unto moses
[36:20] gather unto me seventy men of the elders
[36:22] of israel whom now know us to be elders
[36:24] of the people and officers over them and
[36:26] bring them unto the tabernacle of the
[36:28] congregation that they may stand there
[36:29] with thee
[36:30] so that's the grace of god
[36:33] he says okay moses
[36:35] i see you're depressed
[36:36] i see you're anxious
[36:38] i'll have some other people just be able
[36:40] to stand with you
[36:42] but the truth of the matter behind the
[36:44] whole thing is
[36:45] moses has an unscriptural
[36:48] understanding
[36:51] that all the responsibility was on him
[36:55] but it wasn't
[36:57] it never was
[36:58] he was just a tool in god's hand
[37:00] all he had to do was go get on his face
[37:03] and pray
[37:05] that's all he had to do
[37:07] but instead he got angry anxious
[37:09] depressed
[37:11] how many have ever how many have been
[37:13] there
[37:18] psalm 32 1-5
[37:26] david is the psalm of david
[37:28] blessed is he whose transgression is
[37:31] forgiven
[37:32] whose sin is covered
[37:35] blessed is the man unto whom the lord
[37:37] imputeth not iniquity
[37:39] and in whose spirit there is no guile
[37:42] now listen okay that's good stuff praise
[37:45] the lord
[37:46] but then let's look at david
[37:49] when i kept silence
[37:51] my bones wax old through my roaring
[37:54] all the day long
[37:57] for day and night thy hand was heavy
[37:59] upon me
[38:00] my moisture is turned into the drought
[38:02] of summer
[38:04] then look the next step i acknowledge my
[38:06] sin unto thee in my iniquity
[38:08] have i not hid i said i will confess
[38:12] my transgressions unto the lord and thou
[38:13] forgave us the iniquity of my sin
[38:17] this is a this is a process
[38:19] in this verse okay
[38:21] so he's telling
[38:22] the facts of the character of god
[38:25] and his forgiveness and his mercy
[38:28] but he is what is what is he why does he
[38:31] say that
[38:32] in verse three
[38:34] frank
[38:35] for when i kept silence
[38:37] my bones
[38:39] waxed old
[38:41] through my roaring
[38:43] all the day long what in the world does
[38:44] that have to do with the rest of the
[38:45] context well i'll tell you what it has
[38:47] to do with the rest of the con
[38:50] context
[38:53] david was not confessing his sin
[38:57] in the in the context he he kept silence
[39:00] kept silence from what
[39:03] confessing his sin to god
[39:05] so he was he had sin in his life that he
[39:08] refused to confess
[39:11] and what was the result his bones waxed
[39:14] old
[39:16] his bones
[39:17] what
[39:19] does he get arthritis or what are we
[39:21] talking about here
[39:23] i don't think he's talking about
[39:24] arthritis
[39:26] his bones wax old wipe through my
[39:29] roaring
[39:30] roaring
[39:33] what what does that mean
[39:35] through through his tears his crying his
[39:39] weeping
[39:40] so my bones wax old through my weeping
[39:42] all the day long so he kept silent
[39:44] refused to confess his sins
[39:46] and he what did he do he fell into
[39:49] depression
[39:51] through his crying
[39:53] all the day long
[39:55] and then what does he do
[39:57] he confesses
[40:00] i acknowledged my sin
[40:02] that's that
[40:04] so god's hand was heavy upon david
[40:06] praise the lord for the goodness of god
[40:09] amen
[40:12] have you ever experienced it where god's
[40:14] hand was heavy
[40:15] upon you because you were stubborn
[40:19] and you weren't going to confess your
[40:21] sin even if it was just to him
[40:23] and make it right and move on from it
[40:26] no you just kept it i'm going to keep
[40:27] that i'm not going to say anything i'm
[40:29] not going to do anything about it
[40:31] and what happens it leads you to feel
[40:33] depressed why because god's hand becomes
[40:36] heavy upon you why am i why am i feeling
[40:38] this way why am i i don't understand and
[40:40] you get anxious about it and you get
[40:42] depressed
[40:43] god's hand is heavy is not to make you
[40:46] depressed that's your resisting
[40:49] against god moving in your life to bring
[40:51] you to repent
[40:53] so when when god brings his hand heavy
[40:55] immediately
[40:57] lord what have i done am i hiding
[40:59] something am i doing something wrong
[41:01] let me to know what to do how many of
[41:03] you experienced that in your life the
[41:04] holy spirit comes and you feel so heavy
[41:07] and you feel like like
[41:09] something's not right what's not right
[41:12] i'm going to prayer
[41:14] that's what we should do don't don't sit
[41:15] there and let it fester and fester and
[41:18] get depressed
[41:19] immediately stop everything stop your
[41:21] work stop
[41:23] nothing is more important than what god
[41:24] is doing in that moment
[41:26] get on your knees in some place private
[41:28] and say god what is going on
[41:31] something's heavy is on me he might be
[41:33] warning you from something but he also
[41:35] might be telling you to repent
[41:37] amen
[41:38] thank god for that conviction
[41:42] thank god for people on earth
[41:45] that feel conviction
[41:47] and quickly repent
[41:50] but here david he did he didn't
[41:53] do that
[41:54] and it turned into depression because he
[41:56] was resisting that
[41:59] but finally he said i give up i
[42:01] surrender
[42:02] lord
[42:03] this is what i've done forgive me and
[42:06] god forgave him it's as simple as that
[42:10] first
[42:11] king so hidden and unconfessed sin
[42:13] before god
[42:15] can lead to
[42:16] anxiety and it will result in depression
[42:20] so first kings 19
[42:21] 2-5 familiar with the story
[42:25] then jezebel sent a messenger unto
[42:27] elijah saying so let the gods do to me
[42:29] and more also if i make not thy life as
[42:31] the life of one of them the prophets of
[42:33] baal that elijah slew
[42:35] by tomorrow about this time and when he
[42:38] saw that
[42:39] he arose and went for his life and came
[42:41] to beersheba which belongeth to judah
[42:44] and left his servant there
[42:46] but he himself
[42:47] one a day's journey into the wilderness
[42:49] and came and sat down under a juniper
[42:51] tree
[42:52] and he requested for himself that he
[42:54] might die and said it is enough now oh
[42:55] lord take away my life for i'm not
[42:57] better than my father's
[42:59] and as he lay and slept under a juniper
[43:01] tree behold then an angel touched him
[43:05] and said unto him arise
[43:07] and eat that's the grace of god so here
[43:09] we have elijah running for fear from a
[43:12] queen that wanted to kill him
[43:15] even after all the inspiration and the
[43:17] things that he did he was brought low
[43:20] brought low because of a woman
[43:24] that scared him to death
[43:28] and he ran and hid and i think that's
[43:31] that can be the tendency to someone that
[43:33] feels feels depression i'm gonna run and
[43:35] hide
[43:36] thank god for his grace that god
[43:40] will send something to help you
[43:44] you say well i i was alone for a long
[43:46] time people left me alone
[43:49] god's grace was there if you're his
[43:50] child
[43:51] god's grace is there somehow there might
[43:54] be dark nights there might be dark years
[43:57] there might be
[43:58] dark decades
[44:00] but god is going to do something
[44:03] if he did it for elijah that's his god's
[44:04] principle if he did something for elijah
[44:07] if he did something for david
[44:10] if he did something for moses and you're
[44:12] facing depression for some reason or
[44:14] another
[44:15] god will do something for you too
[44:19] what is he going to do
[44:21] good question what is he gonna do ask
[44:23] him
[44:25] what are you gonna do lord i'm depressed
[44:27] what are you gonna do
[44:28] i can't i can't fix myself
[44:31] i can't change myself i need you to
[44:33] change me
[44:37] he'll come he's gracious
[44:40] jonah
[44:43] jonah what a preacher
[44:46] he went and preached and accomplished
[44:48] his mission
[44:50] and he was so
[44:51] depressed
[44:53] and angry
[44:56] the bible says he was exceedingly
[45:00] angry
[45:02] can you imagine brother brad you go and
[45:04] preach a revival meeting and the whole
[45:06] town repents
[45:08] and you say
[45:12] my prophecy is not coming to pass
[45:15] and these people are rotten i hate this
[45:17] city
[45:20] and he has more compassion on a on his
[45:22] vegetable
[45:25] he
[45:26] must be a gardener
[45:28] cares about vegetables more than he does
[45:29] about people
[45:34] and what happens he's depressed and says
[45:35] kill me
[45:37] i want to die
[45:39] what is it
[45:41] anger
[45:42] i don't want to say stupidity but it's
[45:44] pretty close to that
[45:46] sometimes we get depressed because we
[45:49] did something stupid
[45:52] and we're embarrassed and ashamed of
[45:54] ourselves
[45:55] fine
[45:56] fine
[45:57] we've all done that
[46:00] just repent
[46:01] don't go hide yourself
[46:03] don't go get under your vegetable garden
[46:06] and ask for god to kill you
[46:12] i'm not trying to make it i'm trying to
[46:14] make you laugh a little bit but
[46:16] make you smile a little bit it's a heavy
[46:18] topic
[46:20] but the reality is here jonah felt felt
[46:24] false reasons jonah felt like a failure
[46:28] he ever felt like a failure before lord
[46:30] he said lord i'm such a failure
[46:32] i've just messed everything up i'm at
[46:34] this place in my life and this has
[46:35] happened and this has happened and this
[46:37] has happened and you just
[46:39] lay down in bed and you don't ever want
[46:40] to get out of it
[46:42] yep
[46:43] i've been there
[46:48] but but again
[46:49] it starts out with false thinking about
[46:52] yourself
[46:53] and what god says about you
[46:56] and again
[46:57] when you're going through that
[46:59] many times you have you don't even know
[47:02] everything that you think is perfectly
[47:03] logical
[47:04] perfectly reasonable
[47:06] that's why
[47:07] we need good friends that we can talk to
[47:12] and they can slap us upside the head a
[47:13] little bit
[47:15] they can listen first
[47:18] and nicely say
[47:21] brother sister i think you're starting
[47:23] from the beginning from a wrong
[47:25] wrong way of thinking
[47:28] you're looking at it
[47:30] differently than god looks at it
[47:36] psalm 69 verse 20.
[47:40] reproach
[47:41] have broken my heart or insults
[47:44] have broken my heart and i'm full of
[47:46] heaviness
[47:48] again there that word heaviness
[47:51] speaking of sadness sorrow depression
[47:54] and i looked for some to take pity but
[47:56] there was none
[47:57] and
[47:59] for comforters but i found
[48:01] none
[48:04] difficult situation sounds like sounds
[48:06] like jesus
[48:07] doesn't it i believe it's a prophecy of
[48:09] the messiah
[48:11] he was there he was left alone
[48:14] there everybody forsook him
[48:16] and yet what did he do
[48:20] turn and run
[48:22] it was the darkness of night in the
[48:24] garden of gethsemane pretty easy to
[48:26] escape
[48:27] especially when you know exactly what's
[48:28] coming
[48:32] but he walked
[48:33] he he asked them who are you seeking
[48:37] i would have hidden
[48:39] back behind the fence
[48:42] jesus walked directly up to them said
[48:44] who are you seeking
[48:47] yeah we knew the answer to the to the
[48:49] question already
[48:51] and when he said it again i think they
[48:52] fell down
[48:57] another chance to run right
[49:01] instead he patiently waited for them to
[49:03] arrest him and
[49:04] beat him and
[49:07] and so i that's an example to us what
[49:09] are we what should we what should our
[49:10] response
[49:12] be
[49:12] when we're depressed
[49:14] should it be disobedience
[49:16] or should it be obedience
[49:19] it should be obedience
[49:23] matthew 26 38 then saith he and unto
[49:26] them my soul is exceeding sourful
[49:30] listen to this even unto death
[49:33] tear ye here and watch for me he sweat
[49:36] drops of blood
[49:38] that's a medical condition that can
[49:41] happen when a person is
[49:42] facing extreme levels of stress
[49:46] so jesus went through it
[49:50] uh your soul
[49:52] so heavy
[49:53] so sorrowful
[49:55] unto
[49:56] death what is that describing
[50:00] he knows what's coming he's
[50:02] facing what we would call depression
[50:08] now
[50:09] job
[50:10] chapter nine
[50:12] i'm going to read 27-35 this is from the
[50:16] nlt version
[50:18] i i don't know personally i find it in
[50:20] the kjv
[50:22] very hard to understand the book of job
[50:24] so i always find myself turning back to
[50:26] different
[50:28] different translations and and the
[50:30] original the original hebrew to find out
[50:32] what's going on
[50:34] um that's just maybe just me but
[50:36] i read this nlt and i was
[50:39] amazed
[50:40] at this verse he says
[50:42] if i decided
[50:44] to forget my complaints
[50:46] to put away my sad face
[50:49] and be cheerful i would still dread all
[50:52] the pain
[50:54] for i know you will not find me innocent
[50:56] o god
[50:57] whatever happens i will be found guilty
[51:00] so what's the use of trying
[51:03] even if i were to wash myself with soap
[51:06] and clean my hands with lie
[51:08] you would plunge me into a muddy ditch
[51:10] and my own filthy clothing would hate me
[51:14] god is not mortal like me so i cannot
[51:16] argue with him or take him to trial
[51:20] if only there was a mediator between us
[51:24] someone who could who could bring us
[51:26] together hallelujah there is a mediator
[51:30] the mediator could make god stop beating
[51:32] me
[51:35] and i would no longer live in terror of
[51:37] his punishment
[51:39] then i could speak to him without fear
[51:42] but i cannot do that in my own strength
[51:47] so job
[51:48] has gone through a terrible trauma in
[51:51] his life
[51:52] he lost his children
[51:54] property
[51:55] struck with the terrible sickness
[51:58] and he says even if i put a smile on my
[52:00] face
[52:01] and tried to put away the depression
[52:04] i'd still be afraid of the pain
[52:08] that's quite the statement
[52:11] that's quite the statement and there's
[52:12] people that live
[52:14] in that place i'm trying to put away the
[52:16] depression i'm trying to put a smile on
[52:18] my face
[52:19] in front of everybody
[52:21] but even if i did that
[52:23] i'd still be in terror
[52:26] i'd still be afraid of
[52:28] of what happened
[52:32] each of us
[52:34] has had traumatic events
[52:36] happen in their lives
[52:40] some people even were
[52:42] could have been raised in a home
[52:44] that produced trauma that way
[52:46] some people
[52:48] could have been raped or physically
[52:50] abused or lost a spouse or a parent
[52:53] at a young age or even
[52:55] someone
[52:56] hurt in a bad
[52:58] church situation which brings
[53:01] trauma in your life
[53:03] and it creates a situation where you're
[53:06] living in depression and that depression
[53:09] is controlling how you respond to things
[53:11] that are right in front of you right now
[53:16] and all these things they lead to that
[53:18] anxiety
[53:21] they lead to that depression
[53:23] but
[53:24] god doesn't want us to stay there
[53:27] god doesn't want us to enshrine that god
[53:30] doesn't want us to take a crown and
[53:31] place it upon that and say this is me
[53:35] the world wants to say this is me
[53:38] as good as alcoholics anonymous says is
[53:41] is for helping people
[53:43] people have to identify
[53:46] forever with their sin which is not
[53:47] scriptural
[53:50] amen
[53:55] we don't identify with what trauma
[53:57] happened to us
[53:59] i'm of this i'm a that
[54:02] i have i have this you'll hear that it's
[54:05] my depression
[54:08] it's my anxiety don't claim that as
[54:11] ownership words have power
[54:13] as a man thinks in his heart so is he
[54:18] don't claim it as yours don't say it's
[54:19] mine
[54:21] it's it's it's real it's there it's the
[54:25] the depression but it's not my
[54:27] depression
[54:28] it's the depression because it's an
[54:30] enemy
[54:31] that wants to hurt you
[54:33] destroy you ruin your life
[54:36] and you have to fight
[54:40] not only that but isn't this what part
[54:42] of what the gospel is for
[54:44] isn't that part of why jesus came
[54:47] we don't want to make the gospel just
[54:49] about this
[54:50] life and dealing with problems in this
[54:53] life
[54:54] ultimately
[54:56] the gospel doesn't wipe every tear away
[54:58] right now
[55:00] does it doesn't
[55:02] that's
[55:03] the new jerusalem the new heaven and the
[55:05] new earth where every tear
[55:07] is wiped away
[55:09] still we here we have tears
[55:12] we have sorrow jesus said in this world
[55:15] you'll have trouble
[55:16] those troubles will produce dramatic
[55:18] events in your life those traumatic
[55:20] events will be in your mind
[55:24] until
[55:26] we
[55:26] forget
[55:28] everything that god has already
[55:29] forgotten
[55:34] i have a little taste of that when i was
[55:36] in
[55:36] in the hospital
[55:38] for a day and a half i have no idea what
[55:40] happened and brother andrew says that's
[55:42] a really good thing
[55:48] and it is because the real short
[55:49] snippets that i have are not
[55:51] very fun to think about
[55:54] but i don't have to be defined by that
[56:00] and none of us have to be defined by
[56:02] when i was a child this happened to me
[56:04] when this time this happened to me
[56:07] because the gospel came
[56:09] to change lives
[56:12] to not make you limit it yes okay
[56:14] if something happened to you and you
[56:15] lost your arm your
[56:17] god can cr create a whole new arm
[56:19] absolutely
[56:20] but many times he doesn't
[56:23] many times he doesn't and you go through
[56:25] life without that
[56:27] these events make us who we are
[56:30] but we don't have to be controlled in a
[56:32] negative way by them
[56:34] god works everything for our good
[56:38] so in our mind when we're thinking about
[56:40] such and such an event
[56:43] how would god like us to think about it
[56:46] oh i just i went through this
[56:49] and my life is just destroyed and it's
[56:52] terrible
[56:54] no
[56:54] all things work together for for the
[56:56] good for those that love god and that
[56:59] means that god actively works
[57:01] in the midst of terrible and troublesome
[57:03] things in order to accomplish his
[57:06] good purposes and eternal purposes in
[57:09] your life
[57:12] you know part of what
[57:14] amy and i went through with covid
[57:16] god used that to train amy so that she
[57:18] could go
[57:20] help her parents
[57:21] so they wouldn't die
[57:24] and god used what
[57:26] the terrible thing that i went through
[57:29] to save lives
[57:32] isn't that what happened to joseph
[57:34] joseph went through terrible trauma what
[57:36] was his response i'm gonna get even with
[57:38] those guys no
[57:42] what you meant for evil god meant for
[57:44] good and to save lives
[57:49] and
[57:50] and again we have to
[57:52] we have to speak that over our lives
[57:55] it's true whether you speak it or not
[57:58] but it's going to change your attitude
[58:00] if you speak what god has spoken over
[58:03] your life
[58:04] instead of
[58:05] i had this problem i had this trouble i
[58:07] went through this i went through that
[58:09] okay that's fine tell that and then say
[58:11] but god
[58:15] because it's a testimony
[58:17] those things are there to be a testimony
[58:20] that god can take someone from a
[58:22] terrible circumstance through a terrible
[58:24] situation
[58:26] and make them a whole human being again
[58:29] and they still have the hurt there
[58:32] and they still think about it and say oh
[58:34] that was so bad that's the worst thing
[58:36] that ever happened to me
[58:38] but god
[58:40] works everything for my good
[58:42] god takes care of me
[58:44] god use this to help other people
[58:50] the gospel
[58:52] isaiah 61
[58:55] one through three of course we
[58:57] we familiar with that
[58:59] but i'm going to read verse 3
[59:03] to appoint unto them that mourn in zion
[59:06] to give unto them beauty for ashes
[59:09] the oil of joy for mourning
[59:12] the garment of praise for the spirit of
[59:14] heaviness that they might be called
[59:16] trees of righteousness the planting of
[59:18] the lord that he might be glorified
[59:20] amen so
[59:24] again
[59:25] he didn't say
[59:26] we would never have troubles
[59:30] in fact he said we would be in the midst
[59:31] of mourning we would be more we would be
[59:33] mourning
[59:34] but he would replace that with the oil
[59:37] of joy
[59:39] right
[59:41] the garment of praise for the spirit of
[59:42] heaviness
[59:44] he doesn't erase your memory
[59:47] right
[59:48] you
[59:49] most of us remember the traumatic things
[59:51] that we went through right in our lives
[59:55] okay
[59:56] but you're not again
[59:58] don't be defined by them and don't be
[1:00:00] limited by them
[1:00:02] because with god all things are possible
[1:00:09] if you're depressed talk to your pastor
[1:00:12] or someone you trust in the body of
[1:00:14] christ
[1:00:16] just just some just some things
[1:00:19] walk in obedience okay that's where i'm
[1:00:21] starting here
[1:00:23] some solutions walk in obedience number
[1:00:26] one don't ever let
[1:00:28] i've been so low where i felt like i
[1:00:30] didn't want to see people
[1:00:32] i've been so low where i didn't want to
[1:00:33] go to church
[1:00:35] or if i went to church i ran out of the
[1:00:37] church as fast as i could to get in the
[1:00:39] car and go home
[1:00:40] because i didn't want to talk to anybody
[1:00:42] and have somebody say how are you doing
[1:00:52] don't do that
[1:00:54] don't do that
[1:00:56] talk to your pastor
[1:00:58] talk to someone that loves you
[1:01:01] in the body of christ
[1:01:03] someone that has the spirit of god in
[1:01:04] their lives
[1:01:07] talking through that what you're going
[1:01:09] through can lead you to discover
[1:01:12] what's the source of the problem
[1:01:14] wrong ways of thinking unrepented sin
[1:01:17] and if just anything else to help
[1:01:18] release
[1:01:20] you from the pain that you're
[1:01:22] feeling
[1:01:25] wake up in the morning
[1:01:27] spend time in prayer
[1:01:30] read your bible
[1:01:32] before you go to sleep at night
[1:01:34] pray
[1:01:35] read your bible
[1:01:37] why you say this is so simple because
[1:01:39] depression will
[1:01:41] rob you
[1:01:42] of your senses
[1:01:45] it will make you act stupidly
[1:01:49] i've been there
[1:01:51] it'll make you do things that's the
[1:01:53] opposite of what's going to help you
[1:01:56] so what should we do do the opposite of
[1:01:58] what you feel that's what brother
[1:01:59] branham said if you think this way then
[1:02:02] do the opposite
[1:02:06] listen to sermons of brother branham
[1:02:08] take time to do that
[1:02:09] make that be what's on in your car as
[1:02:11] you're driving
[1:02:13] attend every church service and bible
[1:02:16] study and prayer meeting that the church
[1:02:18] offers
[1:02:21] talk to and fellowship with like-minded
[1:02:24] believers
[1:02:27] and here's here's simple natural things
[1:02:30] but it's important exercise your body
[1:02:33] drink water remember brother john andes
[1:02:36] was saying that about restoration drink
[1:02:38] water drink water
[1:02:41] eat healthy these all these things
[1:02:44] were a tripartite mean
[1:02:47] resolve conflicts that you have quickly
[1:02:50] don't let them fester
[1:02:53] don't let them become deep wounds
[1:02:56] just go talk about it what's the worst
[1:02:58] thing they're going to happen
[1:03:05] lots of bad things could happen right so
[1:03:07] what
[1:03:08] your got the word of god says to resolve
[1:03:10] your conflicts quickly
[1:03:12] drop your gift don't bring it to the
[1:03:14] altar go and
[1:03:16] resolve the problem that your brother
[1:03:18] has with you
[1:03:25] then start doing something to serve
[1:03:27] other people
[1:03:29] get your eye take the focus off of
[1:03:31] yourself
[1:03:32] put it on others
[1:03:38] if you're if you're a if you're a
[1:03:40] brother go and give another brother
[1:03:43] in christ a hug
[1:03:45] dear sister go give another sister
[1:03:48] a hug
[1:03:51] okay wow that's really
[1:03:54] simple
[1:03:56] there's physical reasons
[1:03:58] physical reasons
[1:04:00] it helps
[1:04:03] then
[1:04:04] talk to yourself
[1:04:06] in your thought life according to the
[1:04:08] word of god
[1:04:10] that's the biggest thing that the devil
[1:04:11] does in the secret place of your mind
[1:04:14] you begin to talk to yourself
[1:04:17] and it's not you talking to yourself
[1:04:19] it's the devil
[1:04:21] the devil is manipulating your mind and
[1:04:23] your patterns of thinking
[1:04:25] and it makes you
[1:04:27] full of anxiety full of depression
[1:04:30] check your thoughts by the word
[1:04:36] matthew 11 27-30 all things are
[1:04:39] delivered unto me of my father and no
[1:04:41] man knows the son but the father
[1:04:44] neither knows any man the father save
[1:04:45] the son and he to whomsoever the son
[1:04:48] will reveal him so he's talking about
[1:04:51] revelation
[1:04:52] revelation personally to you and then
[1:04:54] what does he say
[1:04:57] come
[1:04:58] come unto me
[1:05:00] all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[1:05:03] and i will give you rest
[1:05:06] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[1:05:08] for a meek and lowly in heart and you
[1:05:10] shall find rest
[1:05:11] unto your souls for my yoke is easy and
[1:05:14] my burden is light
[1:05:16] amen
[1:05:18] go to jesus
[1:05:20] if you're depressed if you're full of
[1:05:22] anxiety go to jesus
[1:05:26] he'll change he'll he'll change your
[1:05:28] outlook he'll change your life
[1:05:30] it might take time
[1:05:33] might take other circumstances but he
[1:05:35] will do something to do it you go to him
[1:05:40] don't run away from him
[1:05:42] part of coming to jesus is doing the
[1:05:44] things that i talk to you about
[1:05:47] because
[1:05:49] this life here in the body of christ the
[1:05:51] local church
[1:05:53] is part of
[1:05:55] how we come to jesus
[1:05:58] it's not the only way
[1:06:00] it's not the only means
[1:06:02] but it's part of how we meet him and
[1:06:05] meet with him
[1:06:07] and see him
[1:06:09] in the world in the little while in the
[1:06:10] world sees me no more yet you will see
[1:06:12] me
[1:06:13] why for i'll be with you
[1:06:15] even in you so if you want to see jesus
[1:06:18] come and look at the believers that are
[1:06:20] filled with the holy ghost
[1:06:25] so
[1:06:26] you know looking at looking at
[1:06:28] depression
[1:06:29] okay it can be real easy just to say
[1:06:32] all right come on up here we'll pray
[1:06:34] over you and you'll be delivered from
[1:06:36] depression that's absolutely true
[1:06:39] and god can heal you miraculously
[1:06:42] from the way of thinking the patterns of
[1:06:44] thinking all those different things god
[1:06:46] can do that miraculously
[1:06:49] many times
[1:06:51] many times
[1:06:52] in my experience
[1:06:57] that there is a
[1:06:58] fountain there is a spring
[1:07:02] there is a well of water that's
[1:07:04] springing up
[1:07:05] into eternal life
[1:07:07] and these things that we face that make
[1:07:09] us anxious and make us feel depressed
[1:07:12] it's something where we
[1:07:14] it it comes and it goes
[1:07:17] and we have to go to jesus we have to go
[1:07:20] to him we have to get on our knees
[1:07:22] we have to do these things
[1:07:24] we have to listen to worship music
[1:07:27] he delivers in many different ways
[1:07:29] he builds our faith
[1:07:31] in many different ways
[1:07:35] but it's it's
[1:07:37] a fountain that we have to go to
[1:07:39] and it's not just once
[1:07:41] it's not just twice
[1:07:42] it's not just three times it's not come
[1:07:45] and
[1:07:46] come on let's come forward and and pray
[1:07:48] over you that's good it'll help you
[1:07:50] and god can deliver you
[1:07:53] at the same time with depress that's the
[1:07:55] spirit of this age
[1:07:58] it's a neurotic age not fit to live in
[1:08:01] right
[1:08:02] neurosis produces a depression
[1:08:05] so
[1:08:07] it's something we have to fight against
[1:08:08] continually it's a spirit in this age
[1:08:11] that young people old people middle aged
[1:08:14] people all
[1:08:16] have to fight in our own unique ways
[1:08:21] even sometimes there's traumatic things
[1:08:23] that happen
[1:08:24] and just time moving on
[1:08:27] and living by the principles of god's
[1:08:29] word
[1:08:30] delivers you from that amen
[1:08:33] you look back and say man when after it
[1:08:35] first happened i felt so terrible i had
[1:08:38] ptsd and
[1:08:40] you know
[1:08:41] i would shake because of this or that or
[1:08:43] the other thing that happened
[1:08:45] and now i don't do that anymore it
[1:08:46] wasn't any specific event
[1:08:49] it was just living by god's word
[1:08:51] and now i don't feel that way anymore
[1:08:55] and and
[1:08:56] you know we all have our own fight and
[1:08:58] our own battle
[1:08:59] but be in the fight be in the battle
[1:09:02] because that's what it is
[1:09:05] in the sermon letting off the pressure
[1:09:08] brother branham says see it's just built
[1:09:09] up pressure it's the age we're living in
[1:09:11] an erotic age where people don't know
[1:09:13] what to do
[1:09:14] where they're going and the doctors
[1:09:16] don't have the answer for it because the
[1:09:18] psychiatrist is being doctored by the
[1:09:19] psychiatrists
[1:09:21] so they have not the answer
[1:09:23] but there's some answer surely somewhere
[1:09:27] we could deal on it for hours
[1:09:30] but i was just thinking that god has the
[1:09:32] answer amen
[1:09:34] he does
[1:09:37] i love psalm 42
[1:09:40] many times
[1:09:42] i turn and read psalm 42 and i feel
[1:09:45] down
[1:09:47] i'm going to read it from the nlt again
[1:09:51] as the deer longs for streams of water
[1:09:53] so i long for you o god i thirst for god
[1:09:55] the living god
[1:09:57] when can i go and stand before him
[1:10:00] day and night i have only tears for food
[1:10:02] while my enemies enemies continually
[1:10:04] taunt me saying where is this god of
[1:10:06] yours
[1:10:07] my heart is breaking as i remember how
[1:10:09] it used to be i walked among the crowds
[1:10:11] of worshippers leading a great
[1:10:13] procession
[1:10:14] to the house of god singing for joy and
[1:10:16] giving thanks amid the sound of great
[1:10:18] celebration
[1:10:19] why am i discouraged
[1:10:21] why is my heart so sad
[1:10:24] i will put my hope in god amen
[1:10:28] i will praise him again my savior and my
[1:10:30] god
[1:10:31] now i'm deeply discouraged
[1:10:34] but i will remember you even from
[1:10:36] distant mount hermon
[1:10:38] the source of the jordan from the land
[1:10:40] of mount miser
[1:10:41] i hear the two mold of the raging seas
[1:10:43] as your waves and surging tides sweep
[1:10:45] over me
[1:10:46] but each day the lord pours his
[1:10:48] unfailing love upon me
[1:10:51] and through each night i sing his songs
[1:10:52] praying to god who gives me life oh god
[1:10:55] my rock i cry
[1:10:56] why have you forgotten me why must i
[1:10:58] wander around in grief oppressed by the
[1:11:00] enemies
[1:11:01] their taunts break my bones they scoff
[1:11:03] where is this god of yours why am i
[1:11:05] discouraged
[1:11:06] why is my heart so sad i will put my
[1:11:08] hope in god i will praise him again
[1:11:11] my savior and my god i love that
[1:11:15] i love that you know why it's it's so
[1:11:17] encouraging
[1:11:18] because when you're feeling down
[1:11:20] you can go and read the scripture and
[1:11:22] see oh
[1:11:23] i'm not alone
[1:11:25] not the first one that's went through
[1:11:26] this
[1:11:27] david's went through it what was his
[1:11:29] solution
[1:11:30] praise the lord
[1:11:32] give thanks to the lord
[1:11:34] philippians 4 6 through 9.
[1:11:42] be careful or anxious
[1:11:45] for nothing
[1:11:46] but in everything by prayer
[1:11:49] and supplication with thanksgiving let
[1:11:51] your requests be made known unto god
[1:11:55] and the peace of god which passes all
[1:11:57] understanding
[1:11:58] shall keep your hearts and minds through
[1:12:00] christ jesus
[1:12:02] finally brethren what the whatsoever
[1:12:04] things are true
[1:12:05] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:12:08] things are just
[1:12:09] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[1:12:11] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[1:12:13] of a good report if there be any virtue
[1:12:15] and if there be any praise
[1:12:17] think on these things
[1:12:20] those things which you have both learned
[1:12:22] and received and heard and seen in me
[1:12:25] do
[1:12:26] and the god of peace shall be with you
[1:12:30] all right
[1:12:31] so the solution to depression is to be
[1:12:33] free from
[1:12:34] anxiety so everybody do you want to be
[1:12:37] freed from depression
[1:12:39] don't have any anxiety
[1:12:41] let's go home
[1:12:44] you can do that right
[1:12:46] the bible commands it
[1:12:48] so i bet there's a way that god can make
[1:12:50] a way
[1:12:52] for us to live
[1:12:54] in such a way that anxiety doesn't
[1:12:56] control us
[1:12:58] don't be anxious for anything
[1:13:00] okay so what do i do instead
[1:13:05] pray
[1:13:07] make all your requests all your all the
[1:13:10] feelings all the things that you feel
[1:13:12] bring it to god the thing that you're
[1:13:14] fearful about you're worried about bring
[1:13:16] it to god make it known to him and ask
[1:13:18] him to work in that situation
[1:13:20] and then it says with thanksgiving so
[1:13:22] and then thank him
[1:13:24] that the answer is coming
[1:13:26] thank him that he's done it
[1:13:30] if you do that then what will happen the
[1:13:32] peace of god which goes beyond
[1:13:34] understanding in other words you're in
[1:13:36] the middle of a situation
[1:13:39] that would make anyone in the world
[1:13:40] anxious
[1:13:42] right
[1:13:44] that's what's going on
[1:13:45] otherwise he wouldn't say what he's
[1:13:46] saying
[1:13:48] you should this is a situation that the
[1:13:50] human race would be anxious about
[1:13:52] but he says don't be
[1:13:55] pray make your request unto god give
[1:13:57] thanks to him
[1:13:59] then the peace of god that goes beyond
[1:14:03] human understanding
[1:14:05] will keep your hearts
[1:14:07] and minds through christ jesus
[1:14:11] then he gives the next
[1:14:13] bit of advice
[1:14:14] regarding the peace of god
[1:14:18] it's what to think about
[1:14:21] think on positive things that's how
[1:14:23] brother branham would put it
[1:14:25] think always positive thoughts of the
[1:14:27] word of god
[1:14:28] think how god is going to bring his
[1:14:30] promises to pass
[1:14:33] think about the beautiful things that
[1:14:35] the lord has done supernaturally in your
[1:14:37] life
[1:14:39] think about the blessings that he's
[1:14:41] brought brought in your life
[1:14:43] the deliverance that he's given
[1:14:46] think think about
[1:14:48] worship songs
[1:14:52] then he goes on he continues
[1:14:55] again it's about the peace of god ruling
[1:14:58] the what's there's two things fighting
[1:15:00] against each other anxiety
[1:15:03] and the peace of god
[1:15:05] and we want the peace of god to rule
[1:15:08] in our hearts
[1:15:10] so paul is telling us how
[1:15:13] he's telling us how
[1:15:15] prayer
[1:15:18] praise
[1:15:21] and then thought life
[1:15:23] keep your mind
[1:15:25] in in control do not let the the devil
[1:15:28] will try to pass things through right
[1:15:32] he can come in but he we can stop him
[1:15:34] from roosting there right
[1:15:38] the double barrel shotgun that brother
[1:15:40] branham says the old and new testament
[1:15:43] take that double barrel shotgun and blow
[1:15:45] those birds
[1:15:47] blows those birds out of your garden
[1:15:51] so think on positive things of the word
[1:15:53] of god
[1:15:55] and then the last thing he says
[1:15:57] the things that you learned
[1:15:59] received and heard and seen
[1:16:03] do
[1:16:04] it okay i'm gonna cut i'm gonna do it
[1:16:07] one more time because i want you to i
[1:16:09] want everyone to memorize this and i
[1:16:11] want it to be on your heart
[1:16:13] next time you feel anxious and you're
[1:16:15] starting to feel depressed i want you to
[1:16:17] go back to the scripture in your mind
[1:16:19] okay pray make my request known to god
[1:16:22] give thanks worship him
[1:16:27] change my thought life think on positive
[1:16:29] things
[1:16:30] think on the positive things of the word
[1:16:32] of god and the blessings and the
[1:16:34] testimonies and the supernatural things
[1:16:36] that you've personally witnessed in your
[1:16:38] life
[1:16:39] think on those things
[1:16:40] and then walk in obedience
[1:16:44] not disobedience doesn't matter what
[1:16:47] other people are doing don't worry about
[1:16:48] what other people are doing worry about
[1:16:50] what god has commanded to you personally
[1:16:54] what you've seen
[1:16:55] what you've heard what you've learned
[1:16:58] do it
[1:17:00] if you do if if you follow that pattern
[1:17:03] then the peace of god
[1:17:05] shall be with you
[1:17:07] how many want the peace of god with you
[1:17:09] amen
[1:17:10] it's
[1:17:11] i'm not trying to down talk
[1:17:13] a prayer line love a prayer line
[1:17:16] i love god working through prayer lines
[1:17:19] but that's not what this is talking
[1:17:20] about
[1:17:21] anxiety is a the malady that the whole
[1:17:24] human race faces
[1:17:26] it is not an anxiety that a christian
[1:17:28] should be controlled by
[1:17:30] the word of god
[1:17:32] commands us not to do it
[1:17:35] we're not to fester well i'm just an
[1:17:38] anxious person you don't understand
[1:17:39] brother jason i'm just an anxious person
[1:17:42] you're doing it again
[1:17:44] you're owning it
[1:17:46] you're owning it i am this way
[1:17:49] god has set you free from that
[1:17:53] by the blood of jesus christ and the
[1:17:55] baptism of the holy ghost you're set
[1:17:57] free you're not subject to your old
[1:18:00] nature anymore
[1:18:02] it's still fighting against you
[1:18:04] but you're not subject to it it does it
[1:18:06] doesn't have to rule over you
[1:18:09] you can fight against it and overcome it
[1:18:17] first peter 5 7 says cast
[1:18:20] all your cares upon him
[1:18:22] because he cares for you
[1:18:24] cast all your anxieties on him
[1:18:27] part of casting all our anxieties on him
[1:18:30] it's not just a prayer and say lord i
[1:18:32] take this feeling that i have and i put
[1:18:34] it on you
[1:18:36] if you love jesus then you keep his
[1:18:38] commandments you follow his word right
[1:18:41] and so if you want if you want to see
[1:18:43] deliverance
[1:18:46] seek first the kingdom of god
[1:18:49] so many times overseas people come in
[1:18:51] the prayer line pray for me for this
[1:18:53] pray for me for that and everything
[1:18:54] they're asking for prayer for is very
[1:18:56] very simple seek first the kingdom of
[1:18:58] god and his righteousness
[1:19:01] and all these things will be added unto
[1:19:02] you
[1:19:04] i will pray for you to be obedient to
[1:19:06] the word of god and god will add the
[1:19:08] rest to you
[1:19:10] that's what this is about
[1:19:12] yes prayer can give you a jump start
[1:19:15] but you're going to have to fight
[1:19:18] many of the many of the people that came
[1:19:20] through the prayer line the young people
[1:19:21] at the
[1:19:22] at the camp
[1:19:24] was about depression or different things
[1:19:26] in their life and most of it was i pray
[1:19:28] i'll pray for you but you got to know
[1:19:30] that
[1:19:31] you've got to go home and fight
[1:19:33] let this be the starting place that
[1:19:35] you're gonna fight because
[1:19:37] i'm 44 years old
[1:19:39] i've been walking in the message for a
[1:19:41] little over 20 years
[1:19:43] i was facing those things then and i'm
[1:19:45] still fighting
[1:19:46] all of that again why because there's a
[1:19:48] spirit of this age
[1:19:50] that we have to fight against
[1:19:52] yes if somebody has
[1:19:55] let's say just terrible depression where
[1:19:57] they're just laid low they're sick
[1:19:59] they've got all kinds of things
[1:20:01] they need deliverance they need healing
[1:20:04] but they still need to they're still
[1:20:05] going to need to fight it's not as
[1:20:07] though okay you're healed now just go
[1:20:09] back to thinking and living the way you
[1:20:10] were before it's not going to work
[1:20:13] it's not going to work it'll help you
[1:20:14] for a little bit but you'll just go back
[1:20:16] to the same problems
[1:20:18] as you were
[1:20:20] living in before
[1:20:22] sometimes deliverance is something
[1:20:25] that we
[1:20:26] start
[1:20:27] and continue to walk in the rest of our
[1:20:29] lives
[1:20:31] and we can't just lay like a dead corpse
[1:20:33] and say i've been delivered
[1:20:35] you walk in it
[1:20:37] we walk in newness of life
[1:20:40] part of being delivered from depression
[1:20:43] that's a malady that everybody faces
[1:20:45] everybody has to fight against
[1:20:48] it's not just a matter of pray and it's
[1:20:50] over with it's going to come back
[1:20:52] and you have to fight it
[1:20:54] and you have to fight it again
[1:20:56] and you have to fight it again
[1:20:59] why why is that we're in eleodusa
[1:21:02] it's a neurotic age
[1:21:06] it produces
[1:21:07] everything around us is fighting to
[1:21:09] produce anxiety to control us
[1:21:12] god is a great deliverer
[1:21:15] amen
[1:21:16] but he's also a
[1:21:18] a great eternal spirit that's living
[1:21:20] inside of you to create the character
[1:21:23] that's a reflection reflection of jesus
[1:21:25] christ
[1:21:26] that regardless of what we feel again
[1:21:29] jesus felt depression
[1:21:32] jesus felt anxiety
[1:21:34] right to the point of sweating drops of
[1:21:36] blood it's not as though a sinless life
[1:21:39] is going to produce a life free in this
[1:21:42] sinful world of anxiety and depression
[1:21:45] but it shouldn't stop you from being
[1:21:47] obedient
[1:21:48] it shouldn't stop you from living
[1:21:49] according to according to the word of
[1:21:51] god
[1:21:52] musicians if you'd come
[1:21:56] again and i don't want to
[1:21:58] there's a fine balance in that because i
[1:22:00] do i know god delivers but what i'm
[1:22:03] trying to the point i'm trying to by by
[1:22:05] prayer prayer lines
[1:22:07] and does the supernatural work but i'm
[1:22:10] afraid that we emphasize so much
[1:22:13] on the fantastic
[1:22:15] sometimes
[1:22:18] that we forget that there's people that
[1:22:20] are
[1:22:21] living their life
[1:22:22] and they've got to supernaturally
[1:22:25] fight against the enemy on a daily basis
[1:22:29] amen
[1:22:31] let's pray let's stand up
[1:22:40] father we just come before you and we're
[1:22:42] so thankful for your goodness lord
[1:22:45] [Music]
[1:22:46] we're thankful lord that you give us
[1:22:49] strength to fight and overcome
[1:22:53] lord and we know
[1:22:56] as long as we're in this
[1:22:58] body of flesh
[1:23:00] we'll still face
[1:23:03] struggling against sin struggling
[1:23:06] against
[1:23:07] anxiety but we don't have to be ruled by
[1:23:09] it lord
[1:23:11] i pray for each one lord if there's
[1:23:13] anyone
[1:23:14] in the listening audience audience here

[1:23:42] [Music]
[1:23:44] where their life your life is flowing
[1:23:47] through them lord
[1:23:48] so that in this battle that we're facing
[1:23:53] feels like on a moment-to-moment basis
[1:23:57] we're facing this battle that will have
[1:23:58] the strength to be overcomers
[1:24:01] and that will overcome and will overcome
[1:24:03] and will continue to overcome
[1:24:05] and will be identified as those ones
