[1:28] room the world was going to receive its
[1:31] greatest gift that had ever received a
[1:34] little package wrapped up a little first
[1:37] little Christmas
[1:39] package that was ever wrapped in all the
[1:41] world God wrapped it
[1:44] up God made flesh in a
[1:47] package God who covers all space and
[1:51] time was before there was a world or a
[1:54] star
[1:56] molecule wrapped
[1:58] himself in a a little package and was
[2:01] laid in a
[2:03] Manger in a
[2:06] stable where the manures of the cattle
[2:09] and sheep and things up over that stable
[2:13] and in this little mangor on straw or
[2:17] hey
[2:19] Jehovah was laying there crying like a
[2:25] baby it wasn't handed to him in the
[2:28] custom that they were used to gifts
[2:31] being
[2:33] handed that's the reason it's rejected
[2:36] yet tonight amen is because it's not
[2:40] handed to the people in the custom amen
[2:45] that they have been used to receiving
[2:48] gifts they want it wrapped in the kind
[2:50] of goods that they want to wrap it in
[2:54] they want the tensil on it they want
[2:57] something flowly something that's
[3:01] perfumed something that's
[3:03] glittering something that's
[3:06] classic but God don't send it all the
[3:08] time like that
[3:11] amen he sends it in the power the way he
[3:14] wants to send
[3:16] it it wasn't wrapped in fine Linens it
[3:21] was wrapped in swalling
[3:23] claw which I'm taught that the very
[3:26] thing that Jesus is wrapped in the
[3:28] Christ was the uh stuff off the back of
[3:32] a yolk of an
[3:33] ox that was hanging in the stable they
[3:37] they had no clothes for him and they oh
[3:40] when I think of that it nearly breaks my
[3:42] heart no clothes for em Manu will the
[3:47] creator of heavens and earth another
[3:50] thing it was brought by the poor Mary
[3:53] and Joseph was very poor people they
[3:57] were
[3:58] peasants and because it was brought by
[4:02] the poor they didn't want it
[4:06] amen so is it
[4:08] today when this great gift of the
[4:12] church the Holy Spirit falls upon the
[4:16] poor and
[4:17] humble the rich don't want
[4:21] it they don't want to Humble themselves
[4:24] the churches today don't want a pastor
[4:26] filled with the Holy Ghost amen that AR
[4:30] Boy tell you what's right and wrong they
[4:33] don't want it they F him right quick
[4:35] Deacon board get together and turn him
[4:37] away get another and talk about their
[4:40] Creeds they got the church so wrapped up
[4:42] in these denominations till they can
[4:45] take a trusty border or Deacon board and
[4:47] turn a good pastor any way they want to
[4:49] they welcome their their friends and
[4:51] their politicians and so forth but they
[4:54] won't welcome Christ they'd rather have
[4:56] Santa Claus
[4:58] anytime worlds tuck over Santa Claus is
[5:01] tuck over well you don't little children
[5:03] don't even know no more What Christmas
[5:05] Means I wonder people don't know what to
[5:09] do they they just don't want the real
[5:11] thing they'll take anything artificial
[5:13] but they don't want the real thing they
[5:15] don't want the gifts of God they don't
[5:17] want Jesus that's one
[5:20] thing why was the reason they didn't
[5:22] receive this rap package they know what
[5:24] was on the inside of it and they didn't
[5:26] want it that's the reason the churches
[5:28] and people today and the governments and
[5:30] the lands will not receive God's
[5:33] Christmas present is because they know
[5:36] what's in
[5:38] it they don't want it amen amen it'll
[5:41] make women act different it make men act
[5:43] different you'll have to bear the name
[5:47] of a fanatic you'll have to take the way
[5:50] with the Lord's disp
[5:51] few you'll have to clean up your life
[5:54] you'll have to quit your
[5:55] meanus you'll have to stop doing wrong
[5:58] cheating stealing I'm committing
[6:00] adultery amen you'll have to stop these
[6:03] things and the people don't want it
[6:07] amen although they may know it's right
[6:11] but they don't want it it brings too
[6:14] much truth to them it uncovers their
[6:17] sins amen so therefore they don't want
[6:20] it they want nothing to do with it keep
[6:23] away from it that's the way it was in
[6:24] that day they know what was wrapped in
[6:26] it so they said away with it they don't
[6:28] want it it's the same thing
