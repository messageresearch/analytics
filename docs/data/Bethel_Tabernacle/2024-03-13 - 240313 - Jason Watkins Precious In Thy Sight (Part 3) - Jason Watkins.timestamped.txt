[33:13] Christ and to die is gain amen let's
[33:18] pray Master we thank you for your word
[33:21] now tonight and
[33:24] Lord many hours Lord have been spent on
[33:27] this ser series and I'm feel that we're
[33:29] coming to this last part tonight and
[33:32] Lord I think it's as important a part as
[33:34] either of the first two Lord how much we
[33:37] have enjoyed the word of God on this
[33:39] thought now I'm asking tonight Lord that
[33:41] you take the remainder of this material
[33:44] Lord it is very close to my heart and
[33:47] father we have laid before you and salt
[33:49] your face on how to go through it Lord I
[33:52] want to cover it all so I pray Lord that
[33:54] you'll give me the right kind of mind
[33:57] and heart that can complete the
[33:58] assignment tonight and make it real lord
[34:01] to the people father we commit it to you
[34:04] in jesus' name amen God bless you as you
[34:07] are
[34:10] seated
[34:19] amen now I want
[34:22] to read that 20th verse uh one more time
[34:30] and uh if you'll put that up for me
[34:32] please that 20th verse one more time
[34:34] according and because last time after we
[34:37] read it from our King James Bible I read
[34:40] it to you from Eugene Peterson's
[34:43] translation called the message and it
[34:45] was so impacting I want to read it again
[34:47] verse 21st from our scriptures according
[34:50] to my Earnest expectation and my hope
[34:54] that in nothing I shall be ashamed but
[34:57] that with all boldness as always so now
[35:00] also Christ shall be magnified in my
[35:04] body whether it be by life or by death
[35:07] Peterson says it this way I don't expect
[35:11] to be embarrassed in the least on the
[35:14] contrary everything happening to me in
[35:16] this jail only serves to make Christ
[35:19] more accurately known regardless of
[35:22] whether I live or die they didn't shut
[35:25] me up they gave me a platform form alive
[35:29] I'm Christ's messenger dead I'm his
[35:32] prize life versus even more
[35:36] life I can't lose I love that life
[35:41] versus more life choose it's okay you
[35:44] can't
[35:45] lose amen you know and and I I was
[35:49] pointing out and and then of course that
[35:51] 21st verse that was a real really that
[35:55] was coming from Paul's heart this was a
[35:58] conclusion that Paul had come to after
[36:01] many years of suffering persecution
[36:04] hardship nakedness hunger want uh at
[36:08] times you know almost given up for dead
[36:12] and he he lists out many things that he
[36:14] had been through and uh you know it's uh
[36:17] I I appreciated brother Chris Kathy's
[36:20] sermon on Sunday because I thought my
[36:23] goodness I got another one uh like
[36:25] brother Eddie so you know when brother
[36:27] Eddie was around because he had such a
[36:30] tough childhood and his dad you know run
[36:33] off no good you know in the world
[36:36] drinking abusing his mother same thing
[36:39] as brother Chris and uh and really
[36:41] wasn't hardly in their life and brother
[36:43] Eddie you know from the just a boy at 10
[36:46] years old he's working in the cotton
[36:47] field just from a young boy he's having
[36:49] to help support his mother and siblings
[36:52] and you know I whenever I would get
[36:54] somebody in my back office who would
[36:56] have too much of a s
[36:58] story too much of a pity party what is
[37:02] brother jeel wowy wowy woo that's
[37:06] brother ju's statement uh I would just
[37:08] say sit right here and I'd go get
[37:10] brother at is Dad I need you to do that
[37:14] thing and he knew what that meant and he
[37:16] would come back there and just start
[37:18] talking about his life and you could see
[37:20] right away that person closed down their
[37:22] pity party they were they weren't ready
[37:25] to to to you know um cry like that
[37:28] anymore because they realize and so when
[37:30] brother Chris was talking about I mean
[37:32] that was a powerful sermon but I said
[37:35] you know brother Chris what made it so
[37:37] relevant is your testimony behind it
[37:40] because that's incontrovertible nobody
[37:41] can challenge your testimony because it
[37:43] happened to you you were there you see
[37:46] and so you know the the hardship that he
[37:49] went through and the way that he came up
[37:50] as a child and and you know through
[37:53] abuse and broken home and living in
[37:56] shelters as a boy and still come to this
[37:59] message even after his father fought
[38:02] tooth and nail to keep him away from it
[38:04] but he had a righteous grandmother amen
[38:07] amen praise the Lord amen I'm glad that
[38:10] my grandchildren have righteous parents
[38:12] but they also have a righteous
[38:14] grandparent amen praise the Lord and I'm
[38:17] speaking of sister Debbie and amen they
[38:19] know amen and she is uh she is UN she is
[38:24] she is tireless in her stand and when
[38:28] they get left of Sinner they know they
[38:30] have to face mamal and mamal well youall
[38:33] know how opinionated sister well I mean
[38:35] you know
[38:36] how you know how you know how plain
[38:40] sister Debbie speaks amen amen I pray
[38:44] her internet died just now
[38:47] but but uh the grandkids all know what
[38:50] that's like uh they don't want to have
[38:52] to face mama if she's got a problem so
[38:56] uh but they also know the love that
[38:58] comes from it and so brother Chris you
[39:00] know he was he had that same testimony
[39:03] that his grandmother you know and she
[39:05] got him to church and gave him books and
[39:07] then he you know went into the Marines
[39:09] and and the and the Lord got a hold of
[39:11] his life amen and so I just so
[39:14] appreciated somebody that has come
[39:17] through almost in impossible odds almost
[39:20] like insurmountable like Paul and yet is
[39:23] still a Believer and not only a Believer
[39:25] but a stronger one am you know I was
[39:28] just talking with a a sister recently
[39:31] about trials that we go through and you
[39:35] know she was saying to me and a member
[39:37] of my family very close
[39:40] to my trial and at times when I just you
[39:45] know you sometimes you get to the point
[39:47] where the disappointment can almost you
[39:49] can't breathe it just can take your
[39:51] breath away it's so crushing and yet I
[39:54] had the same testimony as her and I said
[39:57] you know and she had the same testimony
[39:59] we would not take back one of those
[40:02] trials now let's be
[40:05] honest none of us would have went
[40:07] through them had we seen ahead of time
[40:10] the Lord said I need you to go through
[40:12] this that's okay pass amen Lord I don't
[40:15] need to be that
[40:19] spiritual but you know Paul is speaking
[40:22] here and he's coming to a conclusion
[40:25] about life yeah so it's a big topic so
[40:29] this is why we've titled this series
[40:31] precious in thy sight life should be
[40:33] precious to you and there's only one
[40:36] life worth living and that's the one
[40:38] Paul found and that's the one he's
[40:39] preaching and he Paul was very careful
[40:42] that this topic of life and what it took
[40:45] for you to achieve it was so important
[40:49] to St Paul that he warned every other
[40:52] preacher uh to
[40:54] Infinity make sure you don't don't
[40:57] change what I'm
[40:58] saying make sure that just as I preach
[41:02] how the people can get to life don't you
[41:05] alter it you build right on top of my
[41:07] foundation and don't change anything
[41:10] don't move the ancient landmarks of the
[41:12] word how many appreciate a restored full
[41:16] word in this
[41:18] hour so Paul had paid a high price I
[41:21] think that a man who has paid a high
[41:24] price he has the right to have some
[41:27] audacity I think that a man who has
[41:29] labored and went through it and and
[41:31] walked through the fire and stood for
[41:33] the people he has a right to say things
[41:36] not only a duty and and a love but he
[41:38] has a right and and I and I think as the
[41:41] family of God you know when I look back
[41:44] at what this first prophet to the first
[41:47] age went through and I went and I see
[41:49] what the last prophet to the last age
[41:51] went through I just say those men had
[41:54] had a right to indict an evil generation
[41:57] those men had a right to tell me how to
[41:59] live those men have a right to tell me
[42:02] how to get home those men have a right
[42:04] to tell me I can't get there myself and
[42:07] I can't figure it out and I'm going to
[42:09] have to come God's provided way or I
[42:13] won't get
[42:17] there so when it comes down to it Paul
[42:21] was showing that it is Christ and it is
[42:24] the Life of Christ that really gives
[42:27] meaning to life this is where he ended
[42:29] last time Christ is what gives meaning
[42:32] to life and that's what that having that
[42:38] Revelation uh and the meaning that comes
[42:40] with it is what causes people to serve
[42:43] him even in hard times even all the way
[42:46] through hard times even all the way to
[42:49] the maximum hard time the ultimate P the
[42:51] ultimate sacrifice the laying down of
[42:54] your life and being willing to die for
[42:57] the cause of
[42:59] Christ now ours isn't so much that we
[43:02] have to give our lives ours is that we
[43:05] strive in our lives against the God of
[43:07] this evil age against Satan's Eden
[43:10] that's why brother Brenham said there in
[43:11] the church age book speaking of the
[43:13] martyrs and then comparing and
[43:15] contrasting to our day against their day
[43:18] and he said to speaking of the reward to
[43:20] some their reward is because they have
[43:23] given meaning their lives and they love
[43:26] not their lives unto death so some are
[43:30] rewarded in that they have given others
[43:32] meaning you and I in that we have
[43:35] striven so I'm here to tell you
[43:37] something friends get used to this
[43:39] reality god holds tantamount the
[43:43] striving that you go through with the
[43:45] physical death of what they went through
[43:47] am I would dare say you need the holy
[43:51] ghost in your life and you need every
[43:53] morning a fresh a fresh dying you need
[43:57] his mercies to be new every morning I
[43:59] know I
[44:00] do see and so it all comes down when you
[44:04] realize that life is precious then we
[44:07] ought to hold it as precious because you
[44:11] know this whole sermon title precious in
[44:15] thy sight was me up early one morning
[44:18] thinking about the goodness of God
[44:20] thinking about how I should have he
[44:22] should have never kept with me thinking
[44:24] how I should have long ago been kicked
[44:25] to the curb think how I should have been
[44:28] a hopeless case oh but there was Grace
[44:32] Hallelujah if it not if not for Grace
[44:35] friends where would I be oh where would
[44:38] I be if not for
[44:41] grace and so I would say to you this
[44:44] evening that the Lord Jesus Christ has
[44:48] invested quite a bit in
[44:50] you he's kept you and preserved you to
[44:53] this hour kept you a Believer when it's
[44:56] really impossible to
[44:58] be oh it's too dark it's too perverted
[45:02] it's too Twisted you would never survive
[45:04] it if we didn't have the message of the
[45:06] hour the opening of the word you'd never
[45:09] be able to recapture the token abstract
[45:12] for your life the church ages would
[45:15] never have given it to you it couldn't
[45:17] give it to them there had to be a
[45:19] restoration of all
[45:24] things so it gives meaning to our life
[45:26] so then
[45:27] we constantly have been asking you the
[45:29] question what's precious to you is the
[45:31] word precious is it now really
[45:35] see that's talk is
[45:38] cheap but do you demonstrate in your
[45:41] life to the Lord that his word is
[45:44] precious to you and that this gospel is
[45:47] dripping with
[45:48] blood do you hold it sacred do you value
[45:52] it am you see and and so you can say
[45:56] well that's how I feel in my heart and
[45:58] humanly speaking I'm not saying you're
[46:00] wrong or even mistaken or even lying or
[46:03] anything you might believe that about
[46:05] yourself but you also might have too
[46:07] high an opinion of yourself and if you
[46:09] look in the mirror of God's word you
[46:11] might really see that what the word says
[46:14] you remember you remember when in Snow
[46:16] White when the wicked witch she wanted
[46:18] to be lied
[46:19] to she's really an old hag but she
[46:22] wanted the mirror to show her she was
[46:24] beautiful this won't do that this is not
[46:27] a magic mirror it will tell you the
[46:30] truth about you and the only thing you
[46:33] can do when you look in the mirror and
[46:34] say God have mercy help me let me have a
[46:38] fresh surrender that a surrender
[46:39] yesterday oh I need it today I need it
[46:41] again and
[46:43] again our lives ought to be sincere
[46:46] before God and humble before God you
[46:49] only get that way through prayer and
[46:51] through dedication the more you can
[46:54] dedicate your life the stronger you
[46:56] become and then the more you can
[46:57] dedicate it which then you the stronger
[46:59] you become so it comes through doing it
[47:02] comes through the exercise of your faith
[47:04] amen you can't look for God to just push
[47:07] you through a pipe or put you in a
[47:09] cookie cutter he doesn't have cookie
[47:12] cutter family we all go through
[47:15] different things it's because and and
[47:17] your trials may not be like mine but on
[47:19] the other side I don't you don't and I
[47:22] don't know what we'll be but he does and
[47:24] whatever I'm Happening Here is getting
[47:25] me ready for there amen so so just look
[47:29] at it like that and then just you know
[47:31] just tell the devil you don't
[47:33] matter but because you say well he says
[47:36] well you know I got I I'll give you this
[47:38] disease I'll kill you for for me to live
[47:40] as Christ and to die you're threatening
[47:43] me with death a man who's not afraid to
[47:46] die are you telling a joke uh to me to
[47:49] live is Christ and to die is
[47:52] gain
[47:55] see so we we realize brother
[47:59] brandham you know I I I want to catch
[48:01] this uh in Philippians 3 please um
[48:05] brother Josh from Philippians 3:13 and
[48:07] 14
[48:09] Brethren I count not myself to have
[48:12] apprehended but this one thing I
[48:14] do I love this verse because I find my
[48:19] up and down life right
[48:21] here Brethren I count not myself to have
[48:24] apprehended but this one thing I do for
[48:26] forgetting those things which are behind
[48:29] and reaching forth unto those things
[48:31] which are before I press that means like
[48:35] a strain you're stretching you're
[48:37] reaching see I press toward the mark for
[48:42] the prize of the High Calling there's a
[48:45] prize there's a high calling of God in
[48:48] Christ Jesus you say what does that even
[48:51] mean a prize of the High Calling of God
[48:55] in Christ Jesus God can live through
[48:58] you what greater prize would you
[49:01] want I mean do you realize all the
[49:03] famous people in the world who have a
[49:06] million times a million times the amount
[49:09] of money you got who hold leadership
[49:12] positions in the world that you will
[49:15] never hold who have who are famous
[49:20] around the world can't even go up the
[49:22] street without getting mobbed who this
[49:25] life is the only life they will ever
[49:27] know and when they're gone from memory
[49:31] you will still be
[49:33] living I would say that the High Calling
[49:36] of God in Christ Jesus is a pretty
[49:39] valuable prize to be striven
[49:44] for verse 20 for our conversation is in
[49:48] heaven from whence also we seek for the
[49:51] Savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall
[49:54] change our vile body thank
[49:57] God that it may be fashioned like unto
[50:00] his glorious body according to the
[50:03] working whereby he is able even to
[50:06] subdue all things unto himself I'm glad
[50:09] he
[50:10] can brother brandham I'm going to give
[50:12] you this these these three statements
[50:15] here three different
[50:19] um actually there's four and and there's
[50:22] in they're in chronological order
[50:24] because I want I want you to see brother
[50:27] branham's as it's continuing to unfold
[50:30] to him he starts saying it in
[50:32] 1953 and he says it again for the fourth
[50:35] time in
[50:37] 1963 but he starts in Elijah in 1953 and
[50:41] he says the American people want to be
[50:45] entertained when they get a preacher
[50:48] that's in 1953 he's already saying this
[50:51] if he's not a good Entertainer to have
[50:53] socials and things like that are
[50:55] carrying on they don't want him and they
[50:57] vote him out of it they want to be
[51:01] entertained but God don't send
[51:05] entertainers he sends
[51:07] preachers see he sends preachers of the
[51:10] Gospel to preach the unadulterated
[51:12] gospel of
[51:14] Christ the power of his
[51:17] resurrection and every man that believes
[51:20] and accept it is born again outside of
[51:26] that you're
[51:29] lost and the nation will be
[51:33] lost he comes in 1955 two years
[51:37] later almost two years exactly about too
[51:40] much shy it a little less he says in the
[51:44] message the same Jesus tonight when the
[51:47] Holy Ghost overshadowed her speaking of
[51:50] Mary when the holy ghost
[51:54] overshelf in her womb
[51:57] now he's about to make a statement that
[51:59] the world will be judged
[52:02] by he says when the Holy Ghost over
[52:05] shattered her and put a blood cell in
[52:07] her womb God the Creator made that and
[52:12] that came to be the Son of God Amen here
[52:16] he says it again outside of believing
[52:19] that you're
[52:22] lost doesn't matter what you do he says
[52:25] all you could do
[52:27] it none of that would matter it's it's
[52:29] you have to believe that in order to be
[52:33] saved to believe what that Jesus Christ
[52:36] was the son of God that it was a blood
[52:38] cell created by the spoken word of God
[52:41] no part of Mary or Joseph at all he was
[52:45] man plus he was the god man see now
[52:49] watch he's going to keep ex extending
[52:52] his understanding now a year later
[52:55] 1956 God's Covenant with Abraham and his
[52:58] seed and the blood cell comes from the
[53:01] male and the male produced the blood
[53:03] cell and the male this time was a
[53:05] supernatural being which could not have
[53:08] sexual desire and God the Creator
[53:11] created a blood cell in the womb of Mary
[53:15] that brought forth the son Christ Jesus
[53:18] you believe
[53:20] it outside of that you're lost if you
[53:24] don't believe that there's not a way in
[53:27] the world for you to be
[53:29] saved see now I'm not I'm not trying to
[53:33] overthrow what brother Brandon made the
[53:35] statement in the in the at the at the in
[53:38] the Millennium the Heathen will be
[53:39] raised up to who never heard the gospel
[53:41] to get a chance God's fair and Equitable
[53:43] in all things you can't accuse him of
[53:45] Injustice so he's got a plan for all
[53:48] that and I'm not here to preach on that
[53:50] I'm just here to tell you God's got
[53:53] it all right so so don't question it
[53:56] whatever you do don't question it and
[53:58] and all right so so then now he comes to
[54:03] 1963 Christ is the mystery of God
[54:06] revealed one of the most epic sermons in
[54:08] his entire
[54:10] Ministry you almost have to hear it 10
[54:12] times I've probably heard it 10 times 10
[54:14] times trying to catch all of it and he
[54:18] says and to be sure that the whole
[54:21] Rapture now is that an important topic
[54:23] to you amen the whole Rapture now Luther
[54:27] was apart Wesley was apart the prophets
[54:31] was apart in the Revelation that they
[54:34] was making up the body the feet the toes
[54:37] the arms and so forth until the head see
[54:40] now we're coming into our time until the
[54:43] head see that makes the entire Rapture
[54:47] it's the body of the word that is such a
[54:51] statement it's the body of the word
[54:55] which is ch Christ amen now I'm going to
[55:00] get ahead of myself but I'm I'm not able
[55:02] I'm not allowed to not do it because I'm
[55:04] being anointed to do it so I'm gonna
[55:06] maybe just catch this one point I might
[55:08] make it again Sunday when you when you
[55:12] look at the pyramid that we have put up
[55:15] many times and I didn't do a PowerPoint
[55:17] tonight intentionally because it's
[55:18] Wednesday but but when you look at that
[55:22] and you see that
[55:24] Pyramid has no cap in the then the cap
[55:26] is coming down and actually the cap it
[55:29] Stone itself is a
[55:31] pyramid and it's got to come down and
[55:34] fit and brother brandham said that's
[55:35] what the gospel is doing it's honing the
[55:37] church if it's speaking of the
[55:39] individual it's adding faith and virtue
[55:42] knowledge and Temperance what is that
[55:43] doing it's honing you to fit not him to
[55:46] fit you he ain't
[55:48] changing he's God he changes not it's
[55:51] it's honing you it gets more and more
[55:54] narrow as it comes and the world has to
[55:56] get cut off of you so that you get to a
[55:59] point where the Capstone can come down
[56:02] see now you'll even notice in the middle
[56:06] when brother brandham has it there's a
[56:09] there's a there's a
[56:11] space and you say well well what is
[56:14] there well here's what we know brother
[56:18] brandham had already taught us that we
[56:22] have a uniting time and sign amen
[56:27] so we already know by prophecy that that
[56:30] was upon us it is the uniting time and
[56:34] sign and the and the sign of the son of
[56:37] man was a sign to the world that the
[56:41] uniting of Christ and his church is
[56:43] coming back to the fullness again just
[56:46] like it was in Paul's day when Paul was
[56:49] writing this you're now coming you could
[56:51] just as easily be sitting hearing Paul
[56:54] preach when you're hear hearing the
[56:56] message of the
[56:59] hour and so you say well so so I know
[57:04] that the Capstone I'm not waiting on a
[57:08] on a on a a uniting we already have the
[57:13] uniting time and sign so the only thing
[57:16] so now that's why we're not looking for
[57:18] some great Big Revival coming brother
[57:20] Bram said I'm not looking for Revival
[57:22] I'm looking for the coming of the
[57:24] Lord see he's just got to revive what we
[57:27] already know that's what the third
[57:29] pool's about it's finally making the
[57:31] word
[57:32] live you say well I don't see anything
[57:35] in between there you know why you don't
[57:37] see anything in between there that's
[57:39] uniting the top to the bottom because
[57:41] that uniting is
[57:44] invisible it's the it's the invisible
[57:48] Union and in fact is no one would know
[57:52] what it took to do that had brother
[57:54] brandham not written in that space Holy
[57:57] Ghost Holy Spirit now he's not saying
[58:00] that's where you get born again he's
[58:02] saying that the same God that started
[58:04] the church is the same one who's
[58:05] finishing the church and it's a uniting
[58:08] time and sign and the word is becoming
[58:11] flesh
[58:12] again and it's an invisible thing to the
[58:15] world they don't see it but we see it we
[58:18] know what it
[58:21] is so brother brandham comes here and
[58:23] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[58:27] and he says I'm going to read it again
[58:30] the whole Rapture Luther's apart
[58:32] Wesley's apart prophets are apart
[58:33] Revelation they were making up the body
[58:36] feet toes arms and so forth until the
[58:38] head makes the entire Rapture it's the
[58:41] body of the word which is Christ hang on
[58:46] to that statement
[58:48] amen it's the body of the word which is
[58:54] Christ so in the beginning was the
[58:58] word and the word be was with God and
[59:02] was God and then became a body so it
[59:05] went from an invisible Spirit into a
[59:07] pillar of fire logos and that was the
[59:10] logos and that was the word and then
[59:12] that logos later became a body and that
[59:15] was now the word made
[59:17] flesh you see and so the life of that
[59:23] word when we talk about the word please
[59:26] don't limit in your mind that the
[59:29] message is just a restoration of
[59:31] Doctrine and Gifts you you thought it
[59:33] was just Doctrine and Gifts it's a
[59:36] restoration of a uniting
[59:38] life it's listen it's the the life of
[59:42] the logos that's the life you bypassed
[59:46] because of the fall but that's also the
[59:49] life you're now being restored back to
[59:52] hallelujah we're being restored back to
[59:55] that life that was in
[59:58] God and Christ was the first of that
[1:00:01] creation he's the beginning of it and
[1:00:04] now the whole family she is him she's
[1:00:08] the continuation of him in expression
[1:00:11] what that's why I say to you and that's
[1:00:13] why we plead with you make Christ first
[1:00:17] put this message as Central let it be
[1:00:20] your whole life sell out to It Lock
[1:00:22] Stock and Barrel it's the only thing of
[1:00:25] any value you it's the only thing that's
[1:00:28] going to
[1:00:34] survive so he says it's the body of the
[1:00:37] word meaning it's coming into human
[1:00:39] beings which is Christ you say uh Jesus
[1:00:44] wait a minute don't just think of the
[1:00:47] Nazarene remember he's the beginning of
[1:00:49] an
[1:00:50] expression God he was the god man he was
[1:00:53] man plus and so so this is why exactly
[1:00:57] we find the Bible saying that the
[1:01:00] kingdoms of this world have become the
[1:01:03] kingdoms of Our Lord that's Jesus and
[1:01:07] his Christ that's his body that's the
[1:01:10] whole pyramid that's the whole life
[1:01:13] restored and you're going to get a body
[1:01:15] like Paul said liken unto his glorious
[1:01:20] body oh it's a uniting time and sign
[1:01:24] friends in visible to the world it's an
[1:01:27] invisible
[1:01:29] Union but it's just as real they don't
[1:01:32] see they don't
[1:01:34] see the logos in you any more than they
[1:01:38] saw it in
[1:01:40] Jesus they sure didn't they called him
[1:01:44] Beelzebub pretty sure they didn't think
[1:01:46] he was the logos
[1:01:47] embodied
[1:01:49] see so now he says that makes the entire
[1:01:54] Rapture it's the body of the word which
[1:01:59] is
[1:02:00] Christ here it is again outside of that
[1:02:04] you're
[1:02:06] lost I don't care how good you are or
[1:02:11] what your relationship is or what your
[1:02:14] fellowship is or what your organization
[1:02:18] is you're lost outside of that word
[1:02:22] being in
[1:02:23] you you're lost outside of that word
[1:02:27] being in you not you're lost out you
[1:02:30] know but you're okay as long as you're
[1:02:32] sitting in a message Church you're lost
[1:02:35] unless that word is in
[1:02:37] you that it comes here with you and
[1:02:40] leaves here with you and it goes to work
[1:02:42] tomorrow what does the
[1:02:47] word when you're in a crisis in public
[1:02:50] and you got a situation are you on
[1:02:52] display or is the word on display when
[1:02:54] you got conflict in your home sibling
[1:02:57] rivalry or or marital stress you know
[1:03:00] who's on display you are
[1:03:03] Christ I'm sure you know which one is
[1:03:05] supposed to
[1:03:08] be so he and he ties that back to the
[1:03:13] scriptures he's making the point I don't
[1:03:16] care how good you are what your
[1:03:17] relationship or fellowship or what
[1:03:18] organization you're lost outside of that
[1:03:20] word being in you and he goes to the
[1:03:22] scripture to prove it if ye abide in me
[1:03:25] if if
[1:03:27] if if ye abide in
[1:03:30] me
[1:03:32] see the word my word abide in you then
[1:03:36] he goes then you shall ask what you will
[1:03:38] do you know why because now you're
[1:03:41] operating the prize the mark for the
[1:03:44] prize of the high calling and so then
[1:03:47] it's then then you ask what you will
[1:03:51] because you and the word are the
[1:03:54] same
[1:03:58] well what does that look like brother
[1:04:00] Jason I'm glad you asked that brother
[1:04:03] bram's got an answer for
[1:04:05] you here's what here's what makes that
[1:04:08] up he has the
[1:04:25] nothing more you see the rest of the
[1:04:28] people living the way they do but yet
[1:04:30] you do not do it you're a prisoner
[1:04:34] you're yoked with him and he says my
[1:04:38] yoke is easy yoked with Christ with the
[1:04:45] word you are or you are
[1:04:53] not we talk about oh overcoming and the
[1:04:56] ingredients of overcoming and what it
[1:04:58] takes to be an overcomer I want to say
[1:05:01] to you tonight that the that the giving
[1:05:03] of yourself unreservedly to the Lord is
[1:05:07] an ingredient of overcoming in fact is I
[1:05:11] would suggest to you it's one of the
[1:05:12] main
[1:05:14] ingredients there you you're going to
[1:05:16] bake a cake there's all kinds of flavors
[1:05:18] and Seasonings and things you might put
[1:05:20] in it but there's some main ingredients
[1:05:22] that if you don't add them it won't be a
[1:05:24] cake
[1:05:28] so the giving of yourself unreservedly
[1:05:31] to the Lord is a main ingredient because
[1:05:35] you are the manifested word of this day
[1:05:38] that's what you're supposed to be a a
[1:05:42] manifestation of the Revelation that is
[1:05:45] in him all the world listen it's it's
[1:05:49] it's all the word that makes up his
[1:05:52] mystery that's what you are yeah amen
[1:05:57] living you see because it's a
[1:06:00] mystery and the people read right over
[1:06:02] it but it's they can't understand it
[1:06:05] they can't decipher it and neither can
[1:06:07] you and it's not about a prophet coming
[1:06:10] and deciphering
[1:06:12] symbolism and increasing your theology
[1:06:14] which the message does but that's not
[1:06:17] what it's really about it's really about
[1:06:20] coming off the page and living behind
[1:06:22] skin you become the mystery of all all
[1:06:25] that he is in the
[1:06:27] word I mean if you if if that's not true
[1:06:31] then he can never be just to condemn
[1:06:34] this world because the world could say
[1:06:38] well even your family couldn't be that
[1:06:40] you put too much on us like Cain said my
[1:06:43] burden is greater than I can bear you're
[1:06:44] putting too much on me and that would be
[1:06:47] the defense they would use but I'm here
[1:06:48] to tell you they will not have a defense
[1:06:51] because this word is becoming flesh and
[1:06:55] this
[1:06:56] and all those who love it who hold it
[1:06:58] precious will say this is the most
[1:07:01] valuable thing that I will ever have in
[1:07:04] my
[1:07:05] life everything else takes second third
[1:07:08] and fourth and fifth behind it nothing
[1:07:10] is up here with the word nothing's even
[1:07:12] equal to the word be living in my life
[1:07:17] and
[1:07:18] me doing whatever I need to
[1:07:21] do to be
[1:07:24] thaten
[1:07:26] that's why I
[1:07:27] said the giving of yourself unreservedly
[1:07:30] to the Lord is a major ingredient
[1:07:35] see so we are a continuation this is uh
[1:07:39] this is the prophecy that he gave in
[1:07:42] Genesis 1 128 be fruitful and multiply
[1:07:46] this is the continuation of that Jesus
[1:07:49] said Jesus I mean in Matthew I I'm sorry
[1:07:53] in Genesis when in chapter 3 when they
[1:07:57] came to God I think it's verse 21 when
[1:07:59] they came and they had fig leaves and
[1:08:03] the Bible says God gave them
[1:08:07] skins see which means he slew a lamb and
[1:08:11] gave them bloody skins now that the the
[1:08:14] innocent life of that lamb couldn't come
[1:08:16] back on them because they were human so
[1:08:19] the only way an innocent lamb could come
[1:08:21] back on a human is the Lamb of God would
[1:08:23] have to be a human
[1:08:26] am so when he started it in Genesis 3
[1:08:30] Jesus said I have come to
[1:08:34] finish I've come to finish his work that
[1:08:38] he started back there and I'm going to
[1:08:40] give my life a ransom for
[1:08:44] many oh friends do you love him like we
[1:08:48] ought to tonight is he the most precious
[1:08:50] thing that you're involved in this and
[1:08:52] that he has revealed this and you're a
[1:08:54] part of it
[1:08:58] Hallelujah so it's the life in the
[1:09:01] logos the life that we bypassed in the
[1:09:04] fall the life that's being
[1:09:07] restored and you thought it was just
[1:09:09] doctrines and
[1:09:14] Gifts brother brandham says in Jubilee
[1:09:18] year this is a very touching
[1:09:21] quote Chris and I were rejoicing over
[1:09:24] this said if we ever get to go there we
[1:09:26] want to do the same
[1:09:30] thing brother brandham says when I stood
[1:09:33] that down there in San Angelo catacombs
[1:09:35] and looked laying there all along for a
[1:09:38] mile nearly under the ground I've seen
[1:09:40] pictures of it probably you have to
[1:09:43] under the ground Graves where they'd
[1:09:45] have to bury their dead he's talking
[1:09:46] about these churches back in the day the
[1:09:50] the True Churches the your brothers and
[1:09:52] sisters who had to meet secretly down in
[1:09:54] the tombs CU authorities wouldn't go
[1:09:55] down there it was hooky and spooky and
[1:09:58] they wouldn't go down there a bunch of
[1:09:59] dead dead people everywhere and so they
[1:10:01] would go down in there they didn't get
[1:10:03] to come into a nice conditioned building
[1:10:05] like this with power and seats and
[1:10:09] freedom they had to meet in
[1:10:11] hiding and he says where they he says
[1:10:14] and they for nearly a mile under the
[1:10:16] ground Graves where they had to bury
[1:10:18] their dead and right on in the corner
[1:10:19] was a little bitty Graves that was the
[1:10:22] children where they put the children in
[1:10:23] the corner and there was a little church
[1:10:26] down there where they had to hide away I
[1:10:29] went down there in the old Roman
[1:10:31] Cathedral where they burnt them now he's
[1:10:33] at a different place the Roman Cathedral
[1:10:35] you know where they burnt them to the
[1:10:37] stake the the um the Roman Coliseum what
[1:10:40] we would
[1:10:41] call and where they burnt them to the
[1:10:44] steak fed them to
[1:10:46] Lions I walked out there in the middle
[1:10:48] of that place and stood there I stood
[1:10:51] around I hadn't seen it yet and all the
[1:10:52] dirt that fell in if you've ever seen
[1:10:54] pictures this makes sense to you and
[1:10:56] there was the great places where the
[1:10:58] lions come out I walked right about
[1:11:00] where I thought maybe the lion pit was
[1:11:03] where the Christians died I raised up my
[1:11:06] hands and stood there I said oh Jesus
[1:11:08] I'm such an unworthy creature to think
[1:11:11] that my brothers sealed their testimony
[1:11:14] here by the mouth of lions and so forth
[1:11:18] for the cause of Jesus
[1:11:22] Christ I happen to stand and look behind
[1:11:24] me and somebody hoisted up The Old
[1:11:26] Rugged Cross standing over Yonder I be
[1:11:28] to hum in my heart on a hill far away
[1:11:31] stood an Old Rugged Cross the emblem of
[1:11:35] suffering and
[1:11:36] shame how that men Through the Ages the
[1:11:39] whole world is drenched with the blood
[1:11:41] of the Lord Martyrs of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:44] Christ I thought what a little old thing
[1:11:47] that we are thinking about taking a
[1:11:49] little missionary trip maybe have to
[1:11:51] stand a little persecution somebody
[1:11:54] laugh at you see brother Ram's mocking
[1:11:57] you know
[1:11:58] humanity and he says I've I'm becoming a
[1:12:01] football that people kicked me around a
[1:12:03] whole lot that don't make any difference
[1:12:05] they kicked other around men before me
[1:12:08] they did things like that and called
[1:12:10] this that or the other I got a gospel to
[1:12:13] preach I got the Lord that I love I got
[1:12:15] a goal to make can you hear him saying I
[1:12:18] don't care about this world I don't care
[1:12:19] about this world I don't care about this
[1:12:21] world I got a gospel to preach I got the
[1:12:24] Lord to love Hallelujah I'm on a
[1:12:28] mission see I got a gospel to preach I
[1:12:31] got the Lord that I love I got a goal to
[1:12:33] make and when I come to the end of the
[1:12:36] road I want to come with every one of
[1:12:38] you saying this I have fought a good
[1:12:42] fight that's your
[1:12:46] desire now watch some of these nights no
[1:12:50] doubt I'll be standing at the pull pit
[1:12:53] when my face will turn pale my lip will
[1:12:55] seal and I'll and he breaks off his
[1:12:58] sentence he starts back I've always
[1:13:01] wanted to go across the pull pit like
[1:13:03] that home to Glory some of these days
[1:13:06] I'll preach my last sermon I'll make my
[1:13:08] last altar call I'll pray for the last
[1:13:11] sick person I want to die with the Bible
[1:13:13] in my hand calling on the name of the
[1:13:16] Lord Jesus Christ fight a good fight
[1:13:18] finish the course he's preaching he
[1:13:20] wants to die preaching he wants to die
[1:13:23] like I do holding up holding up his body
[1:13:25] Bible saying fight a good fight keep the
[1:13:27] faith don't quit don't give
[1:13:30] up he said I want to go home like
[1:13:35] that finish the
[1:13:38] course you know the
[1:13:41] martyrs now can I can I turn more
[1:13:45] personal now is that okay amen this is
[1:13:48] what I this this was what my prayer was
[1:13:50] when I was praying over the reading of
[1:13:51] the word because I I want to come I I I
[1:13:54] I I I've given you all the doctrine I'm
[1:13:57] going to give you and lined up all the
[1:13:59] quotes I'm going to line up I just want
[1:14:00] to speak to you from my heart to finish
[1:14:03] out this third installment you
[1:14:06] good I'm watching the
[1:14:10] time the
[1:14:13] martyrs who died at the stake burned
[1:14:17] alive the martyrs who stood there where
[1:14:19] brother brandom said I I stood where I
[1:14:21] thought the Lions would have a pit and
[1:14:24] this is where they would come up and
[1:14:25] they they tore God's children to
[1:14:28] pieces I want to say to you tonight and
[1:14:30] I'm quite sure you'll agree with me that
[1:14:32] the martyrs didn't have the end that
[1:14:35] they looked for in the Rapture every age
[1:14:38] thought this is the rapture age I'm
[1:14:41] going in the Rapture that's been the the
[1:14:44] driving desire and expectation of every
[1:14:47] age you don't go back through history
[1:14:49] anywhere you don't find anyone saying oh
[1:14:51] it's going to last hundreds and
[1:14:53] thousands of more years they all thought
[1:14:54] the Lord is coming right
[1:14:56] now so when they're being
[1:15:00] slain and their blood is pouring out and
[1:15:03] they're being consumed Alive by wild
[1:15:06] animals I'll assure you that they they
[1:15:09] didn't have the end that they were
[1:15:11] looking for in a Rapture
[1:15:14] moreover I would say that their lives
[1:15:17] finished in a way they didn't
[1:15:20] expect I'm pretty sure being a human
[1:15:22] being myself that none of them serve God
[1:15:25] going someday I'm going to be Torn to
[1:15:27] Pieces by wild animals in front of
[1:15:29] thousands of Romans cheering or I'm
[1:15:31] going to be burned alive at a stake and
[1:15:33] yet they were but that wasn't their
[1:15:37] expectation their lives finished in a
[1:15:40] way that they didn't expect brother
[1:15:41] Brandon's life didn't come to an end
[1:15:44] like he
[1:15:46] desired we know that now he didn't know
[1:15:49] that then he's saying I want to die
[1:15:51] preaching across the pull pit with a
[1:15:53] Bible in my hand I want to go home to
[1:15:54] Glory like
[1:15:56] that life didn't come to an end like he
[1:16:01] desired now I thought about that and I
[1:16:04] thought you know God loving his
[1:16:06] messenger the way he did and often
[1:16:08] granting him prayers you know on another
[1:16:12] level I mean brother brandham got
[1:16:14] prayers answered at Next
[1:16:15] Level he just he'd just go through and
[1:16:18] he'd go into a city and start preaching
[1:16:21] and the hospital would empty out he
[1:16:25] didn't go there to pray for him he's
[1:16:26] just preaching and Faith people want to
[1:16:28] be there so bad they leave the hospital
[1:16:30] and never need to go back they would
[1:16:32] line up for blocks city blocks long and
[1:16:35] brother bradam had to stand in a pull
[1:16:37] pit for three days and eat his lunch and
[1:16:39] sleep and get water and everything right
[1:16:42] there for three days in a pull pit see
[1:16:45] so so you know when when when I'm
[1:16:48] thinking about how that God and people
[1:16:50] would come by ambulances and they would
[1:16:52] line up city blocks and dead people are
[1:16:54] being
[1:16:56] raised this is a man who got his prayers
[1:17:00] answered a
[1:17:03] lot and you would think that God loving
[1:17:06] him the way that he did and granting his
[1:17:09] prayers at the level that he did and and
[1:17:12] and and fulfilling brother bram's
[1:17:14] desires across 33 years of ministry
[1:17:17] you'd think that he would Grant his
[1:17:19] Prophet this last dying wish on this
[1:17:22] side of the
[1:17:23] race who just wanted to die in the pull
[1:17:26] pit and you would think that God would
[1:17:31] have granted him that the martyrs as
[1:17:35] well um that that gallantry those loyal
[1:17:39] people our human mind would go and the
[1:17:42] unbeliever does go and say well if if
[1:17:44] God's a God why does he allow this
[1:17:46] suffering and why does this happen and
[1:17:47] why do good things happen bad things
[1:17:49] happen to good people and and brother
[1:17:51] brandham didn't get to Die the way he
[1:17:53] expected the Martyrs didn't get to die
[1:17:56] you know we think of the you know we we
[1:17:59] think of death let me just say it like
[1:18:01] this we think of death as something
[1:18:04] dark and ominous and for
[1:18:09] boing I can only
[1:18:11] conclude that God doesn't view the end
[1:18:14] of our race in the same way we
[1:18:17] do he doesn't view our race in the same
[1:18:21] sad way that we view it so brother
[1:18:25] brandham didn't get his desired
[1:18:30] end but neither did he
[1:18:34] end the martyrs didn't get their desired
[1:18:37] end but they didn't
[1:18:39] end none of them have ever
[1:18:43] ended Hallelujah friends the Saints of
[1:18:46] old didn't get their desired end brother
[1:18:47] brandham didn't get their desired end
[1:18:49] but but but they didn't end and I'm not
[1:18:52] going to end and you're not going to end
[1:18:57] amen I believe I'll be alive to see the
[1:18:59] coming of the Lord I have two very
[1:19:02] important reasons very serious important
[1:19:03] reasons for believing that number one
[1:19:05] because I don't think it'll be very
[1:19:09] long more seriously number two I've
[1:19:11] honored my father and mother to this day
[1:19:15] amen and my mom and dad are a witnessed
[1:19:17] to that even as a boy my mother told me
[1:19:21] I was the break between the two crazies
[1:19:24] that's not her word words but that's the
[1:19:25] way I say
[1:19:26] it sorry sister Lisa God bless
[1:19:30] [Laughter]
[1:19:33] you
[1:19:35] amen I'm not going to make sister Jean
[1:19:37] say it out loud
[1:19:39] but but but you know and and she told me
[1:19:42] that one time it so calmed me down
[1:19:44] because I you know here was it seemed
[1:19:46] like Injustice to me which when you're
[1:19:48] the middle child everything seems like
[1:19:49] Injustice
[1:19:52] but but that's the truth and I I had it
[1:19:57] I had it big time and you know I had
[1:20:00] seen my younger brother get away with
[1:20:02] almost capital murder and I'd seen my
[1:20:03] sister get away with almost capital
[1:20:05] murder and here I did something that
[1:20:06] wasn't even that
[1:20:10] bad wasn't even that bad and uh and I
[1:20:14] think I think I I I my mom found out I
[1:20:17] was talking just in a public place I was
[1:20:19] talking to a girl who wasn't a Believer
[1:20:21] woo
[1:20:23] woo
[1:20:25] man second Chernobyl Chernobyl before
[1:20:29] Chernobyl my mom lowered the boom on me
[1:20:33] that was anathema that was never going
[1:20:35] to work for her and and and and and and
[1:20:39] and and I said Mom goodness I didn't I
[1:20:40] was grounded and all this and Mom and
[1:20:42] I'm 15 16 years old what I did isn't
[1:20:45] even that bad I mean I you're being too
[1:20:47] hard on me and she said she would said
[1:20:50] and I was really starting to pitch a fit
[1:20:52] and my mom just said Jason you know she
[1:20:55] said' I've had a much harder time with
[1:20:57] your brother and sister she said' but
[1:20:59] you've been like a sparing for me you've
[1:21:02] been like a Grace a little reprieve a
[1:21:04] little rest and I just went
[1:21:07] oh
[1:21:10] gosh Come
[1:21:14] here totally wiped me out all my fight
[1:21:18] went out the door I felt bad for even
[1:21:20] bringing it up and and and she did she
[1:21:24] you know when David did what he did and
[1:21:26] then the Lord cut his sentence short she
[1:21:28] cut my sentence short and I got out
[1:21:29] after about a week
[1:21:32] so
[1:21:34] amen but I have honored my father and my
[1:21:37] mother to this day and I know what the
[1:21:39] Lord promises for that so parents kids
[1:21:44] honor mom and dad because the Bible says
[1:21:47] honor your father your mother that that
[1:21:49] it thing that your life may be long on
[1:21:51] the earth and things go well for you
[1:21:54] that you have a good life and you be
[1:21:55] long live long on the earth am so I I I
[1:21:59] I I believe that you know that that that
[1:22:02] at the very least if the Lord continues
[1:22:04] to wait you all are going to have to put
[1:22:06] up with me when I'm old and
[1:22:09] cranky I expect to be here when he comes
[1:22:13] now it's it's it listen it's true that
[1:22:16] ultimately I can't control
[1:22:19] that neither can you ultimately neither
[1:22:22] can you control that
[1:22:25] but here is what I can control I'll be
[1:22:29] serving him when he
[1:22:32] arrives that I can control I can
[1:22:35] surrender my life to him on a daily
[1:22:38] basis that I can control as for me and
[1:22:43] my house We Shall Serve the Lord that I
[1:22:46] can control say why are you like that
[1:22:48] for me to live is Christ and to die is
[1:22:53] gain
[1:22:56] when Satan tried to eliminate me
[1:22:57] prematurely he failed then he then he
[1:23:00] tried to make me start thinking about
[1:23:01] death and I went for oh my goodness
[1:23:03] brother Arvin got on to me so bad he
[1:23:05] said I've never had somebody test so
[1:23:07] much in my life and I and I I would go
[1:23:10] for a walk and I'd feel a little funny
[1:23:12] feeling I look at my Apple watch and I'd
[1:23:13] text him I've had this feeling and he
[1:23:15] goes you're fine next week ah here it is
[1:23:19] again you're fine and I said what should
[1:23:21] I do he said exercise eat right and stop
[1:23:25] checking your heart
[1:23:28] rate he said when you feel like doing
[1:23:30] that go sit down and get a drink of
[1:23:33] water and he was
[1:23:36] right and the devil got defeated cuz I
[1:23:40] don't think like that

[1:23:53] word I I love teaching it to other

[1:24:23] in in Malachi chapter 2 that they were
[1:24:26] to fill themselves up with the knowledge
[1:24:28] of God so that they could give it out to
[1:24:30] God's family I've dedicated my whole
[1:24:33] life to doing just that to fill up my
[1:24:36] mind with God's word so that when you

[1:25:00] missionary going to the world and the
[1:25:03] Lord let me do that for a long time even
[1:25:05] after I started pastoring he let me go
[1:25:07] to the mission field and I still May yet
[1:25:09] see always chasing that final frontier
[1:25:12] where the gospel had never been that was
[1:25:14] always my vision and and I love him for
[1:25:17] that and I love Believers and I love all
[1:25:20] you people and I and and this church is

[1:25:25] family and this is why the devil just
[1:25:28] can't hardly he you know it's not that
[1:25:30] he doesn't try and it's not that we
[1:25:32] don't have to keep our guard up CU he's
[1:25:34] all the time trying to get in but I'm

[1:25:55] crazy they're as old as we are they feel
[1:25:57] like my

[1:26:21] brother brandham talked about I see that
[1:26:24] that we all see that I see the Shadows
[1:26:27] deepening for the world I know that we
[1:26:31] can't live forever I know the world
[1:26:33] can't survive
[1:26:35] forever Brother brandham start talks
[1:26:37] about as you as you start toe these
[1:26:39] things you start to think more seriously
[1:26:41] about these things and and I have
[1:26:43] certainly found that to be true but but
[1:26:45] the bottom line is Friends the bottom
[1:26:49] line why it why it is so precious in my
[1:26:53] sight is because I have
[1:26:56] found as a bottom line that I am not
[1:27:00] ending and you are not ending the age is
[1:27:05] ending but we who are alive and remain
[1:27:09] to the coming of the Lord are not
[1:27:14] ending Hallelujah those who've gone on
[1:27:17] ahead of us already have not
[1:27:22] ended I can see them on the the side
[1:27:24] smiling I think that that if if they
[1:27:26] could give us a message today I think
[1:27:28] they'd say you know the end is not like
[1:27:30] you think it is and your new life is not
[1:27:33] like you think it is oh friends what a
[1:27:36] day awaits us what is precious to you
[1:27:40] what is precious to you is this world
[1:27:43] this this filthy nasty cold world that's
[1:27:47] perishing is that more precious to you
[1:27:50] than this have you put anything ahead of
[1:27:53] it
[1:27:56] remember a willfulness to surrender your
[1:28:01] life is a main ingredient of
[1:28:11] overcoming I think
[1:28:13] that we can't
[1:28:16] imagine or put into
[1:28:19] words how we'll
[1:28:21] feel on the other side
[1:28:26] when that morning breaks Eternal bright

[1:28:53] that be precious to you start now value
[1:28:56] it above every other thing that that
[1:28:59] that that your service to the king

[1:29:38] of ENT upon his own self God loves us so
[1:29:41] much he's going to extract us right up

[1:30:55] Old Testament he said now they had the
[1:30:57] promise we actually had the goods so we

[1:31:42] get you to
[1:31:44] re-evaluate in this series get you to
[1:31:47] re-evaluate what is precious and I would

[1:44:35] on um I didn't plan on sharing this at

[1:44:42] to do so tonight and it just wanted to
[1:44:45] share a little bit of
[1:44:48] a a little bit of
[1:44:51] just Grace that God gave me and a little
[1:44:55] message um a few years ago like quite a
[1:44:59] while ago my dad's Aunt so my great aunt
[1:45:02] I grew up across the street from her um
[1:45:05] so she was
[1:45:06] like a full-on grandma for me and she
[1:45:09] was
[1:45:10] taken like for we didn't ever really
[1:45:13] know the reason um but just passed away
[1:45:16] in the middle of the night woke up and
[1:45:18] just didn't really understand it
[1:45:21] but
[1:45:24] it hit my sister really hard and you
[1:45:26] know she went through the whole grief
[1:45:29] stage I guess but I just kind of locked
[1:45:31] it away for a while
[1:45:32] and never let it really process
[1:45:37] so um the other night I just kind of you
[1:45:41] know I got a little bit of a dream and
[1:45:44] it was really sweet
[1:45:49] um uh so basically in the dream I just
[1:45:53] just I walked into what felt like a
[1:45:56] familiar house and I sat down at a
[1:45:59] little Breakfast Table and there was my
[1:46:02] aunt cilia s sitting there
[1:46:08] just
[1:46:11] um I just got to kind of catch her up on
[1:46:14] my life and say well I moved to South
[1:46:17] Carolina and I bought a house and I
[1:46:20] married a girl that you would love and
[1:46:21] it was just
[1:46:23] a really nice time to kind of catch her
[1:46:26] up on my life that I never really got
[1:46:29] to it just felt really sweet that I felt
[1:46:32] like I got to talk to her directly and
[1:46:35] it just I felt like I got to process it
[1:46:38] a little
[1:46:39] bit well I felt the dream kind of
[1:46:41] getting closer to an end and I just
[1:46:43] started crying and I was like well I
[1:46:46] don't want you to go
[1:46:47] away and she said well don't worry Mah
[1:46:50] it won't be very long so it's just it
[1:46:53] felt like an awesome little message that
[1:46:55] I got
[1:46:56] and yeah I just want to thank the Lord
[1:47:00] for his mercy and his grace amen and
[1:47:02] just a little message
[1:47:08] amen amen any others and we're going to
[1:47:12] get one more prayer request but any
[1:47:13] others got it oh Sister
[1:47:18] Sarah I just want to thank the Lord for
[1:47:20] having a good day
[1:47:21] today um
[1:47:23] um as many of you know a couple of weeks
[1:47:26] ago I was back in the ER again with my
[1:47:28] heart and aib and they had to shock my
[1:47:30] heart and they had my
[1:47:32] medications and um the medication that
[1:47:36] they have me on they'll tell you that it
[1:47:38] gives you sometimes severe fatigue but
[1:47:42] what they don't tell you is it almost
[1:47:44] makes you feel like you're depressed
[1:47:45] like you can't even get out of the bed
[1:47:47] in the morning just to get up in the
[1:47:48] morning and get dressed and brush your
[1:47:50] teeth is it takes a lot L of mental and
[1:47:53] physical
[1:47:55] energy and um for the past two weeks I
[1:47:58] have just felt completely
[1:48:01] lifeless and it was just pushing myself
[1:48:04] day in and day out and day in and day
[1:48:06] out just trying to cook meal in the
[1:48:08] evening was just so hard goodness and
[1:48:12] um Brad wanted to take the dog for a
[1:48:15] walk last night and I was trying to walk
[1:48:18] the dog and I felt so
[1:48:20] bad I just didn't have the
[1:48:23] energy and it's something that I really
[1:48:25] enjoy doing and other things that I
[1:48:27] enjoy doing around my house I just did
[1:48:29] not find any energy to even do it I
[1:48:32] wanted to do it but it just couldn't
[1:48:33] find the energy and so last night when I
[1:48:36] went to bed I prayed and I told Lord I
[1:48:38] said I'd rather you just take me home
[1:48:40] them for me to have to live like this I
[1:48:42] can't stand this anymore I said can you
[1:48:45] please take all these negative effects
[1:48:47] of this medication away from me and let
[1:48:50] me have a good day tomorrow
[1:48:53] and so went to sleep and this morning I
[1:48:55] got up and I looked over at the clock
[1:48:57] and I said my it's time to get up and I

[1:49:10] stopped and I was opening up all the
[1:49:12] windows I do that every morning and I
[1:49:13] stopped and I said Thank You Lord that I
[1:49:16] feel good this morning Hallelujah I'm so
