Looking For What the Lord Has for us tonight I sure enjoyed studying it and ministering it amen praise the name of the Lord so brother Ben y'all made it back safe and I see amen that was a good time we had over in Georgia amen praise the Lord you know brother Ben while you I I'll give you a rose while you're standing here I told my wife I said I hope if I'm ever listen listening to a sermon preached in Spanish brother Ben is translating I said that has to be the best translation work I've ever experienced in the world in my life amen it was amazing it was just amazing praise the Lord amen Acts chapter 2 verse one Amen Brother Martin was there with brother Samuel and brother Ben was translating for him and boy was it enjoyable my acts chap 2 veres 1 through3 hey you know what uh uh Z I tell you what is that Zoe yeah give me my PowerPoint honey actually I just realized I've got it right there Amen on my PowerPoint already all right so we're covering opposing the Judgment of God opposing the Judgment of Heaven part four and I'm taking a subtitle tonight living under the new law of Liberty we were talking quite a bit about uh the new law of Liberty all right so here is our reading whoops let me turn it on Amen all right Acts chapter 2 verses 1 to three and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them amen let's pray father we commit ourselves into your hands now Lord you see the thought that's on my heart father and I'll have to just be very careful to go along at a certain clip to get through it so I just as ask for your mercy Lord that you'll anoint me to what needs to be said tonight father to this audience present to the audience streaming and even those who would hear it at a later time father we commit ourselves into your hands very grateful Lord to have you helping Lord you're you're more than a help Lord we're here to help you it's it's all about you father and so I pray now that you will reveal yourself to the people Lord and let it burn on their hearts as that has burned in mind commit it to you in Jesus name amen praise the Lord you can be seated we have been endeavoring we've been endeavoring to establish a point for the last number of sermons over over the last number of weeks and I think that it would be fair to say and I'm sure you would agree that the word that we have been trying to establish so distinctly so clearly is that Christ and his word are the same thing and I have said to you and I have expressed to you and stressed to you that I believe and it is my belief that the Lord is continually bringing this and I promise you it's not just at this pull pit I ran into it in the men's meeting we ran into it at a Minister's meeting everywhere I go preachers that I talked to we realize that that that there is such a a relaxing of this idea in the world today and we really dealt with it very closely on Sunday that was a great blessing to me that see not just understand what's happening in the Christian world and the abandonment of the Living Word by the Christian world to to now you say that that's a rude thing to say well I'm not the one who said they would put Christ out right brother Brandon was not the one who said they would do that a prophet only identified that that scripture had come to pass and that he was found on the outside of his church knocking and we're going to look further in that tonight and and we found out that that there was no possibility to separate God from his word and that's the point we've been stressing so as you might imagine I'm going to hit two quotes here uh that make just exactly that statement as we move on in our material tonight brother brandham in the spoken word is Original Seed he says I believe the Bible is the word you should never wonder what William Brandon believed about the Bible I believe the Bible is the word the whole truth and Jesus is the word made manifest he and his word is one and the same there should be no doubt there should be no confusion there should certainly not be any room in the believer's mind at least those who plan to go in a Rapture the thank you those who plan to go in a Rapture there should be no doubt in your mind there should be no room in your mind to entertain that you could have a life that didn't match the word and still call yourself a Believer believing you're going to go in the Rapture this is this is really becoming the dis the identifying feature of those who are born again of the spirit of God and that is that the token will and must be on display and so he goes on now this is I want you to notice this this is uh March the 18th 1962 all right he comes now about uh 10 months later in 1963 in the message an absolute and that title uh blew up in my mind just before I walked out here so what I'm about to say it's just before I walked out here am all right so because I hadn't noticed it as much as I've been uh staring at it and creating this I was I come up off my knees in the office and sat down began to look over my notes again for the 10th or so time and suddenly the Lord began to I began to notice something that left me astonished in the absolute Here and Now notice that it is January the 27th 1963 all right this is just prior to the seals he says in St John the 5th chapter the 24th verse he that heareth my word my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into the Judgment but has passed from Death unto life notice what he says that's absolute thank God that's absolute if you've passed from Death to life you shall never come into to the Judgment that's absolute see that's it he says now not him that maketh believe but he that believeth now we've got to have an absolute I love that we've got to have an absolute all right you believe that now uh he says he he says um we've got to have an absolute and he is the absolute and he and his word are the same we can't separate them he and his word are the same all right so now he when I looked at this and I thought my goodness this is January the 27th I and he's coming to the seals and this is his absolute on his way there and actually that what you will find is that exactly s Sundays later exactly 49 days later from this statement on a Sunday morning back in his home church he will begin a series that will turn a corner in Earth's Christian history on that Sunday morning he will bring God in Simplicity and in the evening he will bring the breach between the ages and the seals it will be the last time that he comes to a pull pit as merely the seventh angel to the Church of leoda when he comes back to the pull pit on Monday to begin the first seal the ministry of Elijah will be in full steam and it will no longer be just the angel to the church age Hallelujah it'll be the last time on this 7th Sunday this 49th day and he's preaching as far as that angel messenger can go the breach between the ages and the seals and the ages is the church and the woman and the seals are Christ and the man and a prophet has gone after from this statement he's gone 49 days seven Sundays and on the 50th he hallelujah oh my friends there's nothing more to be said to the Church of leoda the messenger can't go any further on exactly the 50th day later he will he will he will be a participant in the unveiling of the first seal Hallelujah exactly the 50th day later after seven Church ages and nearly 2,000 years years the church system of man-made Creed is a dead system and it's time to call out a bride Pentecost could not receive those seals they had already made their choice and I have made mine Hallelujah Let It Be notable to you as it was to me that 50 days prior to that event God's prophet is absolutely sure he's an absolute he's absolutely sure that Christ and his word are the same thing God has an Elijah Prophet who's ready to come to the seals who is absolutely after 30 years of ministry he is certain that Christ and his word are the same thing to this degree we we realize this evening friends that brother brandham now will go and I'm going to show you the next quote there uh because the next time he's making this statement it's going to be after the seals and you're going to see in these next number of quotes after he was prior to the seals absolutely sure that he and his word are the same thing and now he's more sure than ever that he and his word are the same thing and it is based on that it is based on that indisputable fact that his that his fullness that if it is if it is not being displayed on your outside then it may be time for you to question his presence on your inside because it's not about a Creed anymore he's done with that system it's not about works or ideology of mankind this is about who has received the body word of the son of man and who has now become a partaker in the body word and you're feeding on the body word of a son of man he says in calling Jesus on the scene my on my birthday no less he and his word are the same let his word identify him that's the way he said you could prove he was God is't that amazing that's the way he said you could prove he was God because that the works that God gave him to do was done done by him if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me see that's how it identified him that's how that's how to identify you if you say you're a Christian and the identification of a Christian the Bible Christian is not worked in you then there is something wrong see these signs shall follow them that believe yes sir not maybe they will they will and I'm not talking about calling fire down out of heaven or speaking swirls into existence I'm not I'm not talking about any physical sensation you could have I'm talking about is your faith anchored in the word that God has brought to us in this hour are you just as absolutely sure that Christ and his word are the same are you as sure as a prophet was sure if you are then he'll come to you like he came to him see brother Brenham comes to the Rich Young Ruler this is the portrait we have Jesus reasoning with the Rich Young Ruler and brother branam takes that young man in a number of sermons one of my favorites is his last message of leadership his last text sermon in the world before he goes home he'll preach communion there in Arizona but uh leadership there in cavina California is the last text sermon that he'll take and it's always been very special to me because you know that's the sermon where brother brandham comes down and and he he he's he the whole thing is you know at one time you know your mother LED you and then your father LED you and then a teacher LED you and then a Sunday School LED you and then a pastor LED you and he said now who's leading you now see and so I and and that as a young man that always gripped me who's leading you now and I always could say Lord I want it to be you leading me and I know I don't always follow your leadership but I always come back to it again and say Lead Me Lord hallelujah to me it was so tender how that brother brandham he comes down and you can listen to it yourself you can go and hear the tape one of the clearer tapes and brother Bram starts singing at the very end of it till we meet till we meet till we meet at Jesus feet and he comes down and the last the last bars the last time you hear his voice this is the last text sermon he'll preach as a full text sermon and he says now now God be with with you till we meet again and that always grips my heart and I just say I'm going to meet him Hallelujah because I know the same God he knew I've feasted on the same word he's feasted on I have the same perfect faith and a perfect God who kept a perfect promise Hallelujah and it's going to bring me to a perfect condition and it is in spite of me it is and he's doing it to you in spite of you he's doing it to you now he comes here to the Rich Young Ruler and I want you to pay Keen attention to these words here he says the world the world began it ends the the the world began it ends Jesus heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall never because he is the word he is the word and that is eternal so you can't change it it doesn't matter that people have tried to change it it doesn't matter that they've imagined it changed it hasn't changed it's Eternal and all those who are Eternal are Eternal with it Hallelujah and that word in you produces the Life of Christ if I could take the life out of a peach tree and put it in a pair wouldn't it wouldn't bear peaches anymore it would have pears on it because that's the life in the tree would produce what it is the life that's in you shows what you are your life testifies so loud in you until your testimony is not heard your life is louder than your than your lips you see so so this this explains so much why the world makes such a claim with their lips about loving Jesus but their life doesn't match that they love Jesus they love a concept of Jesus they love an idea of Jesus they they admire the fine qualities of Jesus but they Reserve to themselves the right to deny his power why would they deny that because they don't want to have their life changed and and the power of God changes lives amen they know what you are by the life you live and the things that you do if the Life of Christ I love this now if the Life of Christ if the Life of Christ is in you then therefore the works and Life of Christ you live because that's his life living through you you're just in a vessel to carry on the work of God what a rash thing he says what a rash thing this young man did when he wasn't interested in such an investment he had great wealth we're told but the wealth of the world has to to perish listen to me young people you're just starting out in your careers here here a prophet here here Jesus trying to reason with this rich young man and he brother brandham said in leadership he he turned down the leadership of eternal life and he's standing on his roof one day looking out over his kingdom and he's thinking and know I've got so many so much stuff I got to tear all my barns down and build bigger ones and I'm going to take your ease Soul take your ease you're loaded it's all it's all Easy Street from here on and he didn't know there's an angel standing behind him you fool you don't even realize today this day you're going to give an account for your soul and so he says he says he had great wealth we're told but the wealth of the world has to perish what about the young man's condition today wonder where he's at that he turned down the opportunity he had yet he was a Christian believer or a Believer we would say to be more fundamentally he was a Believer he was walking in all the light that the law had and probably a loyal member of some great congregation but yet knew that he lacked eternal life now brother Brandon points that out he knew that he could tell that young man although he had kept all the Commandments he still asked asking Jesus what do I do to get eternal life so in spite of all of his good works and his fine congregation that he went to he knew he was still missing eternal life all right now he had seen something in Jesus that he never saw in other men he saw his priest seen his people he had seen good men but there was something special about Jesus Christ oh I love that you see friends because that the Original Seed will always grow the original life like it did in Genesis then therefore we can establish that the token will be on display you see you understand it's not about you trying to put a token on display if if the seed that was in Genesis grew if that same seed is in you it'll grow it's the spoken word it's the Original Seed and if you have believed if you've heard it and you've believed it and you've accepted it I promise you it's not about gritting your teeth and trying to produce something it's about relaxing in the Holy Spirit and just saying Lord take over my life Hallelujah that's why you're here that we read those quotes here recently about brother Bram going all the way back there in Job 38 and before when morning Stars sang together and sons of God shouted for joy and brother Brenham said you don't remember it but you were there you saw Redemption that's why you were shouting you just believe the lie then you just believe it now Hallelujah I want to tell you something friends that gives you a whole new perspective of life and I just say I know why I'm here and I know what I'm supposed to do Hallelujah and it's not trying to be a rich young ruler it's trying to give my life to his majesty and I'm going to have eternal life waiting for me Hallelujah this life's not about this life you chase after the things of this world you'll regret it bitterly the token will display itself because the Original Seed because the Original Seed will grow the original life just like it did in Genesis the seed we realize has power in it as a potential am and that's important it has power in the seed as a potential brother brandham says here in later on in 1965 God's power to transform when that seventh morning when God looked upon it all and he said it's good I love this I I'm pleased with it yeah I'm glad I did it and I thought about that I thought about the all knowing god knew from the beginning Every Act of sin I would commit before I was redeemed and he knew every stumble I would ever ever make after I've been redeemed including the ones I haven't stumbled at yet and he's all he's still saying I'm glad I did it I'm glad I put Jason on the earth here I'm glad I got bethl tacle I'm glad I got these people yes they've had problems yes they've stumbled yes they and they will again but I don't regret it I'm here to tell you God doesn't regret you he's glad he did it Hallelujah Jehovah Eagle is glad he found you he'll never not be glad he found you and it's all now under control and I have put my trust in my son and his wife life that they will make them head of IT see he says he he made them the head of it that that they will watch over it all and see that it's all right that everything will bring forth of its kind now he has the power to do that God then said well if it's all so good and it can't can't be anything else because it's my own desire it's the way I want it and I have spoke it that way and my words has brought it just exactly the way I wanted it and there it is it's all good and I'm here to tell you something friends he's never changed his mind about his Original Seed it's all good that's why he took Enoch off the Earth Enoch a type of the Bride took him off before the Judgment he took Noah and the righteous seed a type of the 144,000 brother brandham taught us there and brother Bram covers that in 10 virgins and proving his word in different places 1964 and uh and and he says Enoch was a type of the Bride Noah of course was the type of the 144,000 who are who are in the Ark of Safety right as the judgment is ready to commence see so but Enoch escaped home before the Judgment began and so he says here so he says and God and so he says now all right so we've read that and there it is it's all good and everything under control to bring forth of its kind now remember to bring when he put the seed in the Earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to trans transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was his transforming power now God put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said it would be say well okay that's pretty good news but I'm a little uncomfortable with the word that it's just the potential well don't fear there's a way to make it sure and as long as it stayed in its right category it would be just exactly what God said it would be it had to be that way because he made it that way and made a channel see don't lose that and he made a channel in his line of word it will have to bring forth exactly like his word said it would do it cannot move from there it's channeled just exactly right so with everything in the trust of his own son that it would be that way then God said it's all good so I'll just rest we were talking Sunday about our opportunity to prove that we're not like Eve we are the second Eve we're not like that Eve that fell this is the Eve that won't fall this is the Eve that is predestinated not to fall hallelujah amen you believe it so he says I'll just rest and and each one of those seeds has power in itself please take courage in this when you feel like such an seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the species that I desire it to be that's what it must be because I have given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in its potentials now to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be God has never changed just the same today as he was then I love this God is determined to do something he'll do it nothing is going to stop him he'll do it say I'm a little nervous that I've only got potentials God is determined to do something I don't always feel so determined brother Jason all right but God is determined and even when your determination doesn't make the great I'm here to tell you there's somebody determined that you're going want to make the great and I just say Lord make it so make it so in my life make it so in my home because it's true I I do underwhelm I do underachieve I I I don't always get over the top of the mountain but Lord I'm glad you're determined here's what's sure I believe the word hallelujah I know I believe it lord it's my whole hope and stay it's my whole life it's everything I want it's everything I desire I want to see the word that's why I said earlier I know why I'm here now I know what I must do and I want to get on with it Hallelujah nothing is going to stop him he'll do it I love that he comes back now for my last quote here that I put on the overhead I think it's uh the last one I I might yeah it is it's the last one he comes all the way back now I went all the way back to 1956 show us the father and it'll satisfy will it satisfy you tonight Hallelujah God was in his son you believe it sure he was God is in his Universe God is in his word God is in his son now God's in his people too amen you believe it and now he's talking about our text cowardly little Bunch sneaking around the corner locked themselves in an upper room and they were a bunch of cowards I'd never I'd have been too much of a coward to say that they were brother brandham called him in another place mechanic filled cowards here's what I want you to grasp as I turn the corner and race for the Finish Line tonight at least as far as we'll get tonight these cowards these sneaking around corners trying not to be noticed hiding away in a locked up room where our brothers and sisters they were children of God all 120 of them and at this point they're mechanic filled Believers they're mechanic filled cowards a cowardly little Bunch whoops a cowardly little Bunch sneaking around the corner locked themselves in an upper room they were a bunch buch of cowards look at that they had God on the outside they knowed all the Creeds and the formulas and everything can I change that quote I I don't mean change it not change the meaning of it can I add something for your Clarity I promise I won't change the meaning I'm going to add some clarity I want you to own it that where you need to own it tonight can I read it like this those 120 precious Saints knowed all the Creeds and the formulas and everything they knowed it all friends and yet they were mechanic filled cowards when I think about that when when when that goes through my mind and I I I think about you know is there anyone in here tonight now I want to get real personal is that okay I'm only taking you where I went studying this because we have a lot of potential and we we know we're Believers I know I am I know I am I know I fail but I know I'm a Believer I know that when I do fail it's not because because I desired that lifestyle it's just something in my flesh got the better of me wasn't prayed up enough wasn't in my Bible enough wasn't at church enough whatever whatever whatever any one of us tonight could write out a whole board full of reasons but I'm here to tell you you've got more potential than that I'm here to tell you there is a gene of God that's ready to come on display I'm here to tell you you you're just on the you're you're just at that point where where you can operate under the law of Liberty and which means as we showed you Sunday it's finally where you're finally a full free moral agent and you can actually choose to live in the image of God hallelujah because nobody's a free moral agent they are free moral agent but not fully because when they're born in sin their mind is enmity against God it's hostile against God Amen that's what we were showing you Sunday but I'm glad there's a way past that I'm glad there's a power greater than the power of sin I was born under there's a power that can deliver me out of that and release the potentials that's down inside me and all do I ever want those released I want them on display I want it to be on my life I want the devil to know it I want my family to feel it I want the world to shake under it say oh you're trying to make something yourself nothing doing I'm just trying to be all that he has a vision of me whatever is his vision I want to be be all of that but of course I find as you find tonight that we don't always maximize our potential I thought about this tonight is there anybody here tonight that could relate to to to these 120 of our precious brothers and sisters am anyone who loves the Lord like the deciples did but finds it hard to overcome their fear of standing up and standing out for the name of the Lord standing strong and standing on display like these 120 like the disciples loved the Lord loved the Lord believed him they were there because they believed him but they were afraid they they were believers they were genan seed people but yet they were afraid they had potential but they needed something more they had to have something Beyond themselves to set that thing off is there anybody in here tonight who like that like the disciples love the Lord like the disciples did but find sometimes it's hard to overcome a fear of standing up for Christ or standing out for Christ and taking on the name and taking his word and standing publicly for it not now I'm not talking about the politically correct Jesus because Jesus is anything but politically correct I'm talking about the real one that was rejected by the masses the disciples were afraid for a reason they were afraid for a reason they weren't they weren't afraid because Jesus was popular they weren't afraid because he was hip and he was accepted by the masses just the opposite of that see like Peter like James like John maybe just like Peter James and John you've had a relationship for years with the Lord you believe in him you love him with a very genuine love and you believe You' die for him Peter felt that Peter felt all of that just before he denied him just before under intense pressure he denied him you've read that sad part of Simon's history we started hearing about his denial as children in Sunday school class you know it was a mistake you knew it as a child I learned what Peter did there as a boy and I thought he shouldn't have done that we've all agreed that he shouldn't have done that and and and and yet you you you find sometimes yourself also somehow afraid to really stand up for Jesus to really be willing to step out and represent his name authentically authentically we're not talking about the social gospel friends we're talking about a a deep sincerity where you're willing to stand out from the crowd and and and and and if you're like me you you lament the times when you as brother brandham talks about lot he said lot was a righteous man and the Bible says it vexed his the sins of Sodom vexed his righteous Soul daily every day but brother brandham said like like like such a sassr kcki and would say he just didn't have the plain nerve to stand against it sometimes we're like Peter James John sometimes we love him but we lack the plain nerve to stand up for him we believe him but sometimes we find ourselves unwilling to not look like we're denying him we love him with all of our heart like those 120 did with and and we're talking about a love with an oldfashioned love of God and a love of Holiness before before God and before his people I'm going to I'm going to tell you something friends like brother brandham said they were cowards because they they had an experience with the Lord on the outside and I just thought tonight that if there's anybody in here and you say I'm too much like Peter James and John I'm too much like those 120 before the experience of the Holy Spirit came and and and I want to say to you tonight you need to get that outside relationship down on the inside that's what they need friends they couldn't stay with just an outside relationship they had had that for years and oh my how many of us and I say I'm right there with you how many times I've said Lord all I need is more of you on the inside because if I can get more of you on the inside there'll be more of you showing on the outside and that's what I'm here for that's why I was sent to the world that's my mission that's why you're here do you know why you're here you're not here to chase the Leo to S dream you're not here go all out but understand why you're here and understand what you're to do this is just a approving grounds this is just a training field we've got a whole another life laying out in front of us friends your prayer should be Lord move from an outside relationship down to my inside amen they why why would he not be on the inside why is he only on the outside brother Jason I've been a Believer like for years so is Peter but I really love him so did the 120 but I believed him I and I've walked with him so had James and John oh friends my they had all opened their heart to the Lord and I would say tonight if you love him and you wonder why maybe he's not more of him on the inside Maybe he's came as far as he can because you're hindering him now I'm now I'm crossing now I'm going to cross you know o over into the side where we are born of the of the spirit of God because even even after Peter was born of the spirit of God he still had a few Hang-Ups even after the Holy Ghost came you even find you know God forbid that this would sound critical but you even find Paul and Barnabas debating and arguing so great was their argument they had to go their separate ways they couldn't they had to break fellowship and Brotherhood I don't say they were in sin or had some amazing failure I just simply say I believe like God did in our in our in our modern day prophet he showed just enough of his hinder parts to give me courage to give you courage because I know that Moses made mistakes and David made mistakes and Abraham made mistakes I know the brother Brandon made mistakes I know the apostles made mistakes but Jesus makes no mistakes and his word puts you in a mistake-free condition and once you allow him to be on the inside open your heart today you know what I'd do if I were you I'd just say Lord come on in come on in I don't want just an outside relationship I want an inside relationship ask him to burn all the desires of the world out of you replace all of those fears and give you some courage I'm going to hear I'm going to tell you something friends do you know what the richest fuel for courage is the joy of the Lord It's your strength I mean when you have the joy of the Lord the glory is so great you want to tell everybody you're not a mechanic filled coward you're not hiding you want to tell everybody I'm not saying we abandon wisdom but I'm going to tell you something you'll become a fisherman and you'll be fishing every day and you'll be you won't you won't you won't be throwing away wisdom you'll be throwing that lure and you'll be trying to reel them in and if you don't get a bite throw it another spot and throw it another spot but you won't be a mechanic filled coward Hallelujah you'll keep tossing that lure every chance you get you'll you'll you'll scheme for ways to throw that lure you'll drop a little word here and there like brother Brandon used to do on purpose you'll do you somebody got a nice car and you'll start talking about a nice car next thing you know it's about the love of God who gave him that nice car you'll scheme and connive why because you're being as wise as a serpent but you're being as harmless as a dove while you're doing it they know all the Creeds they knowed all the Creeds and the formulas and everything but all of a sudden God came down like a rushing Mighty Wind something took place they went around the country Healing The Sick and raising the dead and casting out devils and signs and wonders Begin to Fall God's in his people I say that's what happened when he was in them then and that's what'll happen when he's in them now God is in his people doing what showing himself alive showing himself alive is that your desire tonight want to show he did that the Bible says he that's first one of the first things the book of Acts says he showed himself alive after his passion one of the first things that he wanted to do I'm here to tell you something friends you're in a position tonight that you also can experience a sudden rushing Mighty Wind you too can have him rush right down into your soul hallelujah oh what what came into them what came into them wasn't an it what came into them was a person it's the person it's the Spirit of almighty God and he can fill up all your heart tonight and he can renew all of your mind and you too can be like those original 120 Saints and pillars of fire can rest on every one of us in here tonight that's what I want friend what about you Beth Tabernacle do you realize that I want to exercise all the potential that God has for me oh I'm so glad I'm so glad we've you know we we're talking Sunday about the conundrum that had 30,000 decisions and can't find 30 I'm glad we solv the conundrum Hallelujah I'm glad we have Satan's answer to his challenge his question I have the devil's answer Hallelujah tongues of fire and El of fire came down upon each one of them why don't you stand up with me tonight and say Lord God that's what I want that's what I want in my home I want that in my family I want that in my life I choose to live under the perfect law of Liberty I want my outside experience to be fued by an inside experience oh blessed be the name of the Lord come on brother Anthony Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord friends that's what I want I hope that's what you want tonight say I'm not here not here for just a a form I'm not here for just Doctrine I'm not here to be seen oh

you'll banish fear strike down fear in the hearts of young men and young women strike down fear in the married and the Elder Lord strike strike those fears out of us oh God we believe for the same

wouldn't call it a fall but I slipped and uh as I was going to get ready and um I just somehow I knew it was an angel I'm still kind of shocked about it but when I slipped under I landed exactly on my knees and uh nothing happened to me which was kind of shocking to me because uh it was there in the shower and I I should have hurt something pretty bad but uh as I come to church here tonight and I'm part of this beautiful service that we had tonight I realized that uh you know God's in everything the natural type of spiritual but I was here in the altar on my knees and I said Lord you're so wonderful because uh I don't know it was a fall or what but you know he protected me and uh he protects us all but I just landed on my knees and without nothing being hurt anything happening to me and it was just a shock so I'm I'm grateful to have been here tonight I'm thankful that I came tonight and uh thank you for the the word tonight brother the Lord and your prayers praise the Lord amen praise God Amen if somebody else is burning I'll give you oh okay go ahead brother John all right I've had one I've been wanting to give for a while especially for Meredith but um we've been having to

been there the parking lot has been full no places can't park anywhere both times she has had to go and we prayed the Lord would Prosper away both times she's went there she's had a parking spot we thank the Lord Lord for that amen Lord amen I I'm a witness of that anytime I'm headed to the airport I pull in there and the place is packed out and I just I just drive up those Lanes go Lord where's my spot where's my spot and it won't even be one or two turns of the Year oh thank you there it is thank you Lord amen you know I I learned a long time ago from an old veteran in the missionary field brother James walls the old the old man going on to be with the Lord told me some of the most raising stories of the supernatural that's the that's the brother who ran out of gas going to preach true story ran out of gas going to preach in the back in the mountains way back up in Virginia and uh he was completely out of gas and he told the Lord I'll run out of gas the Lord said go he said Lord I don't have any money and I'm I'm out of gas and that that church you want me to go preach at is is Miles Away across the mountain and the Lord said go he said okay and he got maybe 10 miles on a deserted Mountain Road ran out of gas Lord I told you now what do I do get in your go in your in your trunk what's in my trunk a milk jug what am I going to do with a milk jug walk down through the woods there's a creek fill it up with water pour it in your tank okay he opened it up there was the milk jug he didn't even remember it being in there just one gallon walked down filled it up came up dumped it in his tank cranked the car drove all the way over the mountain Mountain priest drove all the way back home on one gallon of hydrogen and [Laughter] oxygen praise God Amen and uh that's just that's one one of the many stories brother walls told me but he but he told me this and I never forgot it he said so many people need things from God and they don't even occur to them to this ask for it and he said so many times he said I've been with preachers he was telling me about he was everybody's wanting to call their wives nobody could get a line out you know nobody could he's with a whole team of preachers they were they were belly aching because they couldn't call home and he said I went to use my phone and he said has got down on my knees and said Lord I'd like to have a line need to call my wife and he picked it up and there was a line called his wife went down to breakfast the next day all those guys were in a bad mood what's wrong with y'all oh we didn't get to talk to our wives I did how did you get an outside line he said let just ask the Lord for one amen and he taught me that you have not cuz you ask not and I just always ask I just say l and that God has done that so many times just where it just seemed like why would he even do it just because just because somebody in the earth said father would you please yes I'll be happy to that's how I was as father I loved especially if they came and asked me for something and it was in my power to do it oh my goodness that's how I became like super dad amen amen amen amen and now I'm uh now I'm I'm I'm legendary
