e e e e [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] morning everyone God bless you amen let's stand and pray Heavenly Father we just come before you Lord and we ask that your presence would be with us father that you would just take your word Lord and and uh the portion that's allotted to us today uh break it open to our hearts and speak things to us Lord that maybe we haven't seen before haven't understood before but are laying there in your word word father that the spirit of Revelation that has come forth in this age and this generation Lord would have its fruits and effect in our lives father we Commit This Time To You For Your Glory we ask in Jesus name amen continuing on Israel God's time piece part six and uh we'll just start with the scripture I don't know if this is going to work it's been on for who knows how long ah there we go all right Ezekiel 20 we're going to look at I'm just going to read through it then we'll sit as I live sayith the Lord God surely with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with Fury poured out will I rule over you and I will bring you out from the people and will gather you out of the countries when you wherein you are scattered with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with Fury poured out and I will bring you into the Wilderness of the people and there will I plead with you face to face like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt so will I plead with you saith the Lord God and I will cause you to pass under the rod and I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant and I will Purge out from among you the rebels and them that transgress against me I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn and they shall not enter into the land of Israel and you shall know that I am the Lord amen may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so as we look at that we could see several parts to this is first God is going to bring Israel back to the land actually using his wrath so we look at the first verses that first few verses there is he's going to with an outstretched arm and with Fury poured out will I rule over you and I will bring you out from the people so he's not talking about people that are in the land he's talking to people that are outside of the land and that this is the process he's going to use to bring them back into the land so they're still under God's Wrath as we saw before God he doesn't convert them before he brings them back to the land but this verse shows that he actually purges Israel amen though they're in other countries it says he purges them and brings them out to the Wilderness so it's like a perfect uh description of what actually happened it's quite amazing so he uses his wrath poured out upon them to bring them out so Nazi fascist communist purges that took place before and during World War II and then he says he brings them away from Into the Wilderness so they were taken out of the cities that they were in and were actually brought to concentration camps and there will I plead with you well you think about that I mean what a way to any any of us how you challenge where someone's eyes are looking at is by bringing them into suffering and so he brings them into this Concentration Camp Wilderness away from where they lived to literally plead with them who will you trust in who will you believe in will you turn away from God will you turn to God now they're still not converted right but they have the promises of the fathers but then he says I will cause them to pass under the rod right so before they go back to the land before they're allowed to get back into the land they have to be purged then they have to pass under the rod then he brings in them into the Covenant it says well which Covenant well ultimately he's bringing them to the New Covenant amen as we'll see later but but first in order to bring them into the New Covenant he has to bring them into Abraham's Covenant which is the land amen they had been driven out because they rejected their Messiah and continued to reject him and so God says I'm going to bring you back but first I will Purge you first I'll try you first I will test you I'll make you pass under this Rod of Affliction then I'll let you enter first into the Covenant promis to Abraham before you're converted all right let's continue on Ezekiel 37 and I think Ezekiel 37 we're very familiar you've probably heard many many Revival messages preached about will these bones live but I want you to look at this and think about it actually in the prophetic picture certainly we can use that as a type to speak about God bringing Supernatural Revival and the power of God and the baptism of the Holy Ghost but really it's not talking about that exactly all right because remember we're T this is Ezekiel we just were reading in Ezekiel 23 we read before in Ezekiel 36 it's all speaking about Israel it's speaking about the restoration of Israel all from 36 through 44 is talking about around the time of world war let's let's just say the Leo leodan Church age through the Millennium right and we'll we'll get into some of these things not in uh super detail but in in general detail we'll look at it um so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great Army then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel see that's what we're talking about we read I think we read I think at last in part uh five we read about the bones coming to life and so forth this is where he says what it is these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts in other words they are scattered out of the land therefore prophesy and say unto them thus sayith the Lord behold oh my people I will open your Graves and cause you to come out up out of your Graves and bring you into the land of Israel and you shall know that I am the Lord and I have opened your Graves oh my people and brought you up out of your Graves and shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and I shall place you in your own land then shall you know that I the Lord have spoken it and performed it sayeth the Lord the word of the Lord came unto me saying moreover thou son of man take thee once stick and write upon it for Judah and for the children of Israel his companions then take another stick and write upon it for Joseph The Stick of Ephraim and for all the house of Israel his companions and join them one to another into one stick and they shall become one in thine hand amen and then when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee saying wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these say unto them thus sayith the Lord God behold I will take the Stick of Joseph which is in the hand of and the tribes of Israel his fellows and will put them with him even with the Stick of Judah and make them one stick and they shall be one in mine hand amen and the sticks wherein thou wrest shall be in thine hand before their eyes and say unto them thus sayith the Lord God behold I will take the children of Israel from among the Heathen wither they are beg gone and will gather them on every side and bring them into their own land and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mount mountain of Israel and one one king shall be king unto them all and they shall be no more two Nations neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms anymore neither shall they defile themselves anymore with their Idols nor with their detestable things nor with any of their transgressions but I will save them out of all their Dwelling Places wherein they have sinned and will cleanse them so they shall be my people and I will be their God all right so let me just uh pause there as we're looking at that this is this is describing to us their history and actually it's it is history because he when he restored Israel he didn't restore a northern kingdom and a southern Kingdom he didn't restore a separated people he simply restored the nation of Israel it's already come to pass now they don't have a king they have a prime minister they have a president they have a parliamentary style government uh but this will not always be so amen right there going to be there's going to be a messiah that returns to set up the millennial Kingdom and so then the the total fulfillment you see that you have to understand anytime you look at a prophecy we think of it oh it's filled like in an instantaneous event as message Believers we should understand clearly now that's not how it works if you understand the coming of the son of man you can understand that it encompasses quite a number event of events brother brandom's Ministry right the the ministry of the word in the bride amen that the literal Rapture that's part of it that's that's all part of it it's a process it's been taking place as the scripture speaks about it in uh uh Luke 17 it calls it the days of the son of man so the days of the as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man and so it's speaking of a period of time leading up to and including the Judgment but it's not speaking of an instantaneous immediate event you can't work out the days of Noah equaling the days of the son of man and say oh that's an instantaneous event even the name of it itself shows that it's more than just one moment days of the son of man so when we're looking at this prophecy God is bringing the dead bones of Israel laying in the nations of the world and he's bringing them from everywhere back to the land that's his that's his National Revival that's what brother Branham speaks about and talks about plainly that's it's their National Revival being brought back to the land but that's that's a political Revival that's not a spiritual Revival their their true Revival is going to become is going to come in that moment when the 144,000 are sealed in the tribulation period but they're restored back to the land unconverted right they come back to the land and the scripture is clear about that they they're they're raised up they're brought back they're entered into the land Covenant but just because you're in the land Covenant right doesn't mean you're in the spiritual Covenant with God can you can you see that separation otherwise if there they're in the they're in the entire Covenant when Jesus came he'd have W walked right in they'd have welcomed him and he'd have been King and we'd been living in them in the Eternal ages by now none of us would have come forth right so that just because you are a part of natural Israel which receives the natural Covenant coming from Abraham there's a spiritual Covenant that comes becomes a part of that Jesus said to the Pharisees in John 8 I know you're Abraham's seed but if you were Abraham's children you'd recognize who I am amen so there's a clear separation they certainly are Heirs of the promises to Abraham Naturally Speaking that's good but that's not eternal life that's not the baptism of the Holy Ghost just as we can understand our children are born under a covenant the the Bible says children born to even a home of one believer just a mother or just a father is a believer in the home the child is uh under a promise amen but that doesn't mean they receed the baptism of the Holy Ghost they've got to go on and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's where salvation comes in that's where they enter into the to the New Covenant relationship with God all right all right and David my servant shall be king over them and they shall have one Shepherd they shall also walk in my judgments and OB observe my statutes and do them and they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant wherein your fathers have dwelt and they shall dwell therein even they and their children and their children's children forever and my servant David shall there be their prince forever again this is speaking of the the process first the Revival the N the political Revival he brings them back to the land and Ezekiel 3637 even earlier the chapter 23 is speaking using different types showing Israel bring coming back to the land and this is the this is God's purpose he's going to set a king over them so right now right now we can understand why is Israel back in the land God's fulfilling the promise that there is going to be a king there there's much more that goes into the prophecy But ultimately there is going to be a king in Israel and the Bible the Bible tells us Jesus Promised his his his Apostles that they will sit on 12 thr Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel so there will be a davidic kingdom restored and it'll be literally on this Earth and there'll be the bride ruling over the Nations the Gentile bride will rule the Nations but the Jewish people that entered into the New Covenant and were part of the Bride they'll rule over the Jewish Nation amen moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them it shall be an Everlasting Covenant with them and I will place them and multiply them and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them forever more my Tabernacle also shall be with them yay I will be their God and they shall be my people again in in the Millennium it's it's a natural Tabernacle right there's going to be a temple restored rebuilt um in the future we're going to talk a little bit about the tribulation Temple but this right here is talking about ultimately uh in I believe it's Daniel chapter 9 he speaks of the Messiah coming and anointing the most holy place so in the tribulation period it's used misused right but in the Millennium what happens the Messiah comes and he's the one that anoints the most holy Place amen all right and the Heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel When My Sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forever more and I will pour upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of supplications and they they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn so uh let me read the next verse and we'll comment on that that's Zechariah 1210 and Isaiah 668 who ha heard such a thing who who has seen such a thing shall the Earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for a soon as Zion travailed she brought forth her children all right let's read a quote from the second seal there was a brother here one time wanted to be a missionary felt to go missionary to the Jews I said you you might get one now and then oh people thinks the whole nation no sir Israel is converted as a nation not as a person a nation will be born in a day that's Israel all Israel is saved just remember that Paul said so all Israel is saved now notice all Israel that's exactly right right all right so now let's go back to what we are what we know and what we understand um when we look at this so all Israel will be saved all right so that to to to the Natural mind we think every single Jew that lives in Israel will be converted is that what that means it's not what it means okay so what what does it mean that all Israel will be born in a day he converts them as a nation now it's never been in the history of Israel that everyone was a genuine believer point point to me when it was it never was you know e even when there was just 12 tribes point to The Godly Believers amongst them one of them maybe two right so you understand as time went along how many were real Believers there was a whole nation millions of people that came out of Egypt but how many were really Believers not too many Moses Aaron Miriam uh Caleb Joshua and Caleb and Joshua were the only ones that were able to go on and go into to the land from that group the rest of them died outside of the land and so there's a th though the the the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea a Remnant will be saved so how do we reconcile the Nations born in a day all Israel will be saved how do we put this all together well the scripture does it for us we don't have to if I can get it to come up again I don't know what I did brother Mark it's not obeying me all right in in that day now let me SK skip forward because I'm I'm I'm going to come back to that Revelation 71 after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God he cried with a v a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the Sea saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees to we have sealed the Servants of our God in their foreheads and I heard the number of them which were sealed in there were sealed 10040 and 4,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel and he goes through the tribes Judah Reuben Gad Asher napali Manasseh Simeon Levi isachar zebulun Joseph Benjamin all right so that's the that is the 144,000 those are the ones that are sealed with the Holy Ghost right let's go further and look at some more details about that and I looked and lo a lamb stood on Mount Zion and with him 144,000 having his father's name written in their foreheads what's the father's name Jesus so they have an in other words they have a revelation of who Jesus of Nazareth is so it's been restored to them and I Heard a Voice from Heaven as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of a great Thunder and I heard the voice of Harpers Harper harping with their Harps and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song but the 144,000 which were redeemed from the earth so in other words they they have a re a revelation a new revelation to them brings forth a new song so the same thing happened to Moses the same thing happened to the lamb right they each had a sang a new song because they c grasped a new revelation of what God was doing so and so will we sing a new song when we've got catch the revelation of the message and so they sing this new song because they have the revelation of who Jesus is now we see the details 144,000 from each of the tribes 12,000 from each of the tribes will be sealed what does it mean means they receive the revelation of Jesus Christ which brings forth the new birth brings forth the new that now they're entered into the New Covenant where he writes his word in their hearts and in their minds and so now we can go back to what we read before and I will pour upon the House of David and upon upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn all right so we'll stop we'll stop and leave our comments there so they receive the revelation of who Jesus Christ is they say they look on him whom they have pierced people always ask this how is this going to happen G will Jesus return back and they'll literally physically see them I want to ask the question who is it that's preaching when the 144,000 are sealed amen is it Jesus in a way but how how is Jesus revealed to you today how is the son of man revealed to you in this hour right through a Ministry through brother bram's Ministry it was revealed to us a man in the spirit and power of Elijah so how is Jesus going to be revealed that they pierced him to the the TW tribes of Israel that they're going to receive the Messiah and be born and and mourn they're going to go into mourning why because the two prophets will come God will vindicate their Ministry and they will literally in spirit form look on the one that they pierced not a man with nail scarred hands it's a revelation he writes their names he writes the name of the father in their foreheads that's that's just as good as seeing literally physically the one that they pierced that's no difference because it's by spiritual Revelation anyways even a physical man steps up here and says I'm the one that you pierced you still have to have a spiritual Revelation when Jesus was here and was amongst his disciples everybody just understood no problem it was easy the whole nation was like oh there's the Messiah we get it no even his own disciples didn't get it they were so indoctrinated with a Jewish understanding that despite the spiritual Revelation they had here on oneand Peter says you're the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus says I'm going to go to go to Jerusalem be handed over the chief priests and and crucified and he says it'll never be so and he says Get Behind Me Satan see that's that's the that that's the importance of a revelation without a revelation you'll be a Judas right amen Judas had a natural understanding he could see God is doing something great wow we're going to see the scriptures that that prophesy of our kingdom coming to the Jewish nation and and I'm going to be the guy I'm going to be here and when he didn't fulfill that what was it it was a stumbling block a stumbling Stone he couldn't understand it he couldn't receive it and that's the nation of Israel how could how can they receive it it's by Revelation how can a gentile receive Christ by Revelation it doesn't matter the means that it comes by but it must come as a spiritual Revelation into your soul at something that changes you yes amen what about the nations of the earth there literally going to have Jesus return back and is it going to cause them to repent no they fight him and we'll return we'll return back with him to fight the nations of the earth that's the condition of the heart of man we know that by the gospel we are enemies of God and so how does that change spiritual Revelation how does how is the how is the nation of Israel born in a in a day by spiritual Revelation through two witnesses they'll preach the word God will thoroughly vindicate their Ministry and the people that will receive it will be a Remnant right and all Israel will be saved but not all Israel is Israel right it's the ones God's ultimate purpose was for them to not just have a natural Covenant in a natural land but a spiritual Covenant that he would write his word really if you understand it correctly the new Covenant was not even meant for us right it wasn't for Gentiles the New Covenant he says I'll make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah I will write my word in their hearts and in their minds so how does it come to us because they rejected it they turned away from it and because of their rejecting the New Covenant God turns to the Gentiles and said I'll make my people jealous through the foolish people and that's what he's that's exactly what he's done we're waiting for that jealousy to happen they're still too proud of themselves but there will be a Remnant that will hear the word and they will repent and they'll they'll be have been made jealous and their jealousy will come to its full fruition in Repentance and Revelation amen let's stand we'll pray amen Heavenly Father we thank you so much for your word Lord help us Lord to walk in it to live it Lord knowing the hour that we're living in the lateness of the day and how you're about to bring all things to pass Lord that you have spoken we commit ourselves and the service today into your hands Lord be glorified in our midst we ask in Jesus name amen [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music]
