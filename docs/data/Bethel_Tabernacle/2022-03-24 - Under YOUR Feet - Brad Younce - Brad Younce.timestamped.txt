[48:45] with under your feet
[48:48] well you're going to find out
[48:50] because i didn't know
[48:52] until the lord started dealing with me
[48:56] romans 8 28
[48:58] i told the brother about gideon i said
[49:00] listen
[49:01] i said i've got
[49:03] scriptures all jumbled up
[49:05] it's all messed up but i hope they're in
[49:07] order and they're meant to be maybe it
[49:09] might look like
[49:11] something's not right but it is
[49:13] just hang on
[49:14] romans chapter 8 verse 28
[49:18] and we know
[49:19] that all things work out to the good to
[49:21] them
[49:22] that love god
[49:23] to them who are called according to his
[49:25] purpose
[49:26] for whom he did for new for no he also
[49:29] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[49:32] image of his son that he might be the
[49:34] firstborn among many brethren
[49:36] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[49:39] he also called and whom he called them
[49:42] he's also justified and whom he
[49:44] justified he's also glorified and then
[49:46] what shall we say to these things if god
[49:49] be for us who
[49:51] can be against us may god had a blessing
[49:53] you can have your seats
[49:56] i was telling brother jason before
[50:00] monday morning
[50:02] i was going to speak on
[50:04] more than a match
[50:07] and then monday morning it all got
[50:09] changed
[50:11] to this
[50:12] which we're still going to speak on more
[50:14] than a match
[50:15] but it's going to be under the feet
[50:18] under your feet
[50:19] more than a match means easily able to
[50:22] defeat
[50:23] we're facing an enemy tonight that we
[50:26] can defeat him it's so easy to beat the
[50:28] devil
[50:30] it means we can easily defeat him no
[50:32] matter what takes place
[50:34] the devil is under your feet tonight if
[50:37] we could just realize it
[50:39] but back in romans chapter 8
[50:41] we know that all things work together
[50:43] for good to them that love god
[50:46] everything works out to the good not
[50:49] just when you're up on the mountain when
[50:51] everything's all hunky door and you're
[50:53] on your little clouds floating around
[50:54] and everything's rosy but it's like
[50:56] brother jd brought to us this past
[50:58] weekend when you're in your trials and
[51:00] tribulations when there's been testing
[51:02] your everything working out to the good
[51:05] everything is for your good it don't
[51:07] matter what's facing you what you're
[51:09] facing it's all for your good
[51:11] we know all things work out to the good
[51:14] to them that love god
[51:17] you love god
[51:18] everything's going to work out to your
[51:19] good when you're in the lowest valley is
[51:21] working out to your good when you're on
[51:23] the top of the mountain it's working out
[51:25] for your good
[51:27] hallelujah
[51:29] for whom he did for no
[51:31] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[51:35] to the image of his son
[51:37] god foreknew you so because he foreknew
[51:40] you he predestinated you he
[51:43] predestinated you to be conformed to the
[51:46] image which is having the same form it's
[51:50] what conform means having the same form
[51:53] similar conformed to
[51:56] that means tonight if you're in that
[51:57] conform to the image of god you are
[51:59] nothing but a walking talking jesus i
[52:02] walk jesus i talk jesus i act jesus i am
[52:06] jesus i'm conformed to his image
[52:09] moreover whom he did predestinate just
[52:11] because you predestinated you he's
[52:14] called you and he's called you he's
[52:16] justified you he's justified you he's
[52:19] glorified you
[52:20] hallelujah he's already done it what
[52:23] shall we say paul's fired up
[52:26] after all how can he not be when you
[52:28] know will you be the back parts of god's
[52:30] mind how can you not be fired up tonight
[52:33] god foreknew you he said what shall we
[52:36] say to these things if god before us
[52:39] who is going to be against us paul's
[52:42] going to ask in these verses he's going
[52:44] to mention who a few times and this is
[52:46] the first one who's going to be against
[52:49] you next verse he that spared not his
[52:52] own son
[52:53] but delivered him up for us how shall
[52:57] he not with him also freely give us all
[53:01] things
[53:03] you've got god-given rights
[53:06] god has given you everything
[53:09] he's given you healing
[53:12] he's given you
[53:14] brother
[53:16] god given
[53:17] every promise in this book is yours
[53:20] all because he's freely give you all
[53:23] things
[53:24] god-given rights
[53:26] you have a right to defeat the devil
[53:29] that's a direct quote
[53:31] god-given right you have a right to
[53:33] defeat the devil so if that's the case
[53:36] who is going to lay anything to god's
[53:40] who's going to lay anything to the
[53:42] charge of god's elect
[53:44] there's that who again who is going to
[53:47] do it
[53:48] satan is at the throne daily
[53:52] satan is that we know he has a right to
[53:54] the throne of god and job near the story
[53:56] and job
[53:57] when the sons of god present themselves
[54:00] before the throne of god and satan came
[54:02] among the mist where you been satan oh
[54:04] i've been walking to and fro
[54:07] i've been walking two and a throw
[54:08] seeking who he made of our is what he's
[54:11] doing so he has access to the throne
[54:15] he's even got access in the building
[54:17] tonight
[54:19] satan is the most faithful member in
[54:21] church
[54:23] he probably got here early
[54:25] sometimes we see him get here early he
[54:28] beats us to church sometimes
[54:30] that's why when you come in here he goes
[54:32] and starts messing around with the sound
[54:34] system
[54:35] he starts messing around with the
[54:36] internet sometimes he starts messing
[54:39] around with that organ making it sound
[54:40] funny he don't want you to get something
[54:42] from god
[54:45] so he's already in the build he knows
[54:46] when it's time to come to church
[54:50] he's faithful brother he's the most
[54:51] faithful member
[54:52] if we just start getting him to pay
[54:54] tithes
[54:56] if he's going to come to church start
[54:57] putting money in the offering devil
[55:00] woo hallelujah
[55:04] but he's always day and night
[55:06] around the throne accusing you
[55:10] he goes up and he says you know what
[55:12] josh did today
[55:14] you know what caleb did today you know
[55:16] what chris did today
[55:18] he he okay
[55:21] just because they didn't didn't call
[55:22] your name
[55:23] satan knows who you are
[55:26] satan's already been at the throne this
[55:28] very day
[55:30] telling god what you've done just this
[55:31] day
[55:33] trying to accuse you
[55:36] but i'm here to tell you
[55:37] you repent
[55:39] what sin
[55:42] satan
[55:43] he has access to the sea of
[55:44] forgetfulness
[55:46] what brother brown said he has access to
[55:49] that sea of forgetfulness he should
[55:51] because that's where he lives
[55:52] but we don't
[55:54] i kind of wish we did
[55:57] because i know if i had a stick of
[55:58] dynamite i'd go down and blow blow that
[56:00] sea of forgetfulness blow everything out
[56:02] of it where stuff's not in my memory
[56:05] y'all know what i'm talking about or
[56:06] stuff's not your memory of your past
[56:08] he's constantly bombarding you
[56:11] but i hear what sin
[56:14] what sin oh brother brandon said he has
[56:18] access to that sin forgive us but we
[56:20] don't just think of it
[56:22] god cannot remember that we ever sinned
[56:27] think of that
[56:29] he says you young folks
[56:31] what about that
[56:33] what about it
[56:36] god don't even remember that you ever
[56:37] sin he can forget the whole thing
[56:42] and never will be brought into his
[56:45] memory anymore wouldn't that be
[56:47] something
[56:49] just as quick as you say god i'm sorry
[56:52] it's gone
[56:55] not from here
[56:57] only thing god says is what's sin
[57:00] i don't remember it
[57:02] it's about as far as the east is from
[57:04] the west and you know how far that is
[57:07] god don't even know what you've done
[57:10] but if we just move fast past that
[57:12] tonight what a free person we would
[57:14] become
[57:15] what kind of church services we got we
[57:17] know what the greatest battle ever
[57:18] fought it's in the mind
[57:21] mind battles our memories not erased
[57:24] i can tell you one day i was
[57:26] stuff happened several years ago that
[57:29] you know i'm not ashamed of
[57:31] i'm ashamed i should say but she said
[57:32] that way
[57:35] it constantly bombards you
[57:38] you're always repenting when you
[57:40] actually already truly repent
[57:42] you just don't know god don't know
[57:45] but i'm sitting here praying because i
[57:46] would pray every day god forgive me god
[57:48] forgive me i didn't mean to do that
[57:51] and
[57:52] i guess god got tired of hearing me
[57:55] god said
[57:56] what are you even talking about
[57:59] i don't know what you're talk all i hear
[58:01] is what you're confessing with your lips
[58:05] oh brother that done something different
[58:06] i was turned around different from that
[58:08] day on i don't repent for them things no
[58:10] more because they're gone
[58:12] they're in the sea of his forgetfulness
[58:14] and whatever's got you going tonight
[58:18] right here tell the devil where it's at
[58:21] talent that was it's in hell where he
[58:23] belongs
[58:26] get away from me satan
[58:28] you know satan starts starts telling you
[58:30] about you about your past
[58:32] you know what's funny
[58:34] i don't know if it happens to you but it
[58:35] happens to me
[58:37] why is it he always wants to bring up
[58:38] stuff you've done since you got saved
[58:42] he don't bring up stuff you've done
[58:43] before you before you started coming to
[58:45] church it's stuff you've done since you
[58:47] got saved he wants to bombard you with
[58:49] that
[58:51] hallelujah
[58:52] he starts bringing up your pass oh
[58:54] you've done this and all you've done
[58:55] that he keeps you beat down don't it
[58:57] if we dwell on he keeps us beat down but
[59:00] what's sin
[59:02] if the devil's bringing up your past
[59:05] i stole this from brother donnie
[59:08] if the devil keeps bringing up your past
[59:10] just go ahead and remind him of his
[59:11] future
[59:14] just tell the devil before you were
[59:17] created i was already here
[59:21] and when you're destroyed we'll still be
[59:24] going on it's just the beginning
[59:27] it's just the beginning brother brown
[59:29] said that sin was confessed to the world
[59:31] god don't even know that you ever sinned
[59:35] hallelujah he don't even know that's
[59:37] right he's he said he put them in a sea
[59:40] of forgiveness to remember them no more
[59:42] at all against you
[59:44] than men and women stands in the
[59:46] presence of god as sons and daughters of
[59:49] god the very nature of god in their
[59:52] hearts
[59:54] the blood of jesus has
[59:56] so remitted sins till god don't even
[59:58] remember them
[1:00:00] he don't even remember we even sinned
[1:00:02] what's sin
[1:00:04] hallelujah god puts our sins in the sea
[1:00:07] of forgiveness blocks the amount and
[1:00:10] there has if that they never happened
[1:00:14] and did we stand by the grace of god
[1:00:16] through jesus christ our lord pure and
[1:00:18] holy
[1:00:20] just as holy as he was because he
[1:00:24] doesn't see me when i come up there he
[1:00:26] sees his own son that's when you're
[1:00:28] conformed to the image of jesus christ
[1:00:31] he looks at you he sees jesus christ
[1:00:34] oh he can't see because i'm his son and
[1:00:37] he only sees his son and we don't have
[1:00:39] to think about sins anymore it's all
[1:00:42] gone it's under the blood
[1:00:45] you don't even have to worry about it
[1:00:46] anymore it's out of god's memory he
[1:00:50] don't even remember it no more
[1:00:52] so who
[1:00:53] i'm going to ask you again
[1:00:55] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:00:58] god's elect
[1:01:05] who
[1:01:06] it is god that justifies
[1:01:09] justified as though you've never done it
[1:01:11] in the first place
[1:01:13] that's what that means
[1:01:15] you've got you're being cleared
[1:01:17] hallelujah you've been cleared
[1:01:20] once we repented it's gone
[1:01:23] it's never to be thought of again
[1:01:26] we know what brother matt's been he
[1:01:27] talked to us a couple weeks ago
[1:01:29] when that old nature's burned out of you
[1:01:32] he loses authority
[1:01:35] he don't have power over you he has
[1:01:38] influence
[1:01:39] you'll be bothered with no sticky nature
[1:01:42] until we leave this world but you've got
[1:01:44] overcoming power tonight
[1:01:47] we've got over power tonight to overcome
[1:01:49] every devil
[1:01:51] who is he that condemneth
[1:01:54] it is christ that died
[1:01:56] yes yeah rather that is risen again who
[1:01:59] is even at the right hand of god who
[1:02:01] maketh intercession for us
[1:02:04] who another who
[1:02:07] shall separate us from the love of
[1:02:09] christ shall tribulation or distress or
[1:02:12] persecution or famine or negatives or
[1:02:15] pearl or sword who is going to separate
[1:02:18] you from the love of christ

[1:03:01] we're not watching what satan's doing
[1:03:03] we just stagger in the church sometimes
[1:03:05] with the world on us
[1:03:07] drunk on the world and we can't even get
[1:03:08] into service

[1:03:17] atmosphere

[1:53:19] prayer prayer request that came in you

[1:53:22] pray and let you go
[1:53:23] amen you appreciate the word amen don't
[1:53:26] you appreciate that the person
[1:53:28] of his word
[1:53:30] came and showed up tonight
[1:53:32] amen i love that message brother brad
[1:53:34] you preached
[1:53:35] i mean that that reminded me so much
[1:53:37] when he was talking about the incredible
[1:53:39] hulk
[1:53:41] it reminded me of brother branham when
[1:53:43] he talks about
[1:53:44] uh i think he said it was his mother and
[1:53:46] there was a great big man and he said it
[1:53:48] was
[1:53:49] it was like his mother and a vision and
[1:53:51] he said there was a great big man and he
[1:53:52] said he had a stick and he was he was
[1:53:54] going to hit her and he was yelling at
[1:53:56] her and brother branham said i was just
[1:53:57] i was just uh you know troubled and
[1:54:00] endowed and in fear
[1:54:02] and uh and brother branham said that
[1:54:04] stick was the triune uh trinity and he
[1:54:06] said he was just trying to beat the
[1:54:08] church down with the stick
[1:54:10] brother madam so all of a sudden at once
[1:54:11] i just said you ought not to do that and
[1:54:13] spoke against him brother branham says
[1:54:15] when i spoke he said i looked down and
[1:54:17] muscle started popping out
[1:54:20] brother adam said my arms grew bigger
[1:54:22] and he said i got bigger and stronger
[1:54:24] reminded me of the incredible hulk
[1:54:25] brother brad it's hard to be carnal
[1:54:27] but he said i got bigger and bigger and
[1:54:28] bigger and brother branham said that was
[1:54:31] that was the anointing of the lord to
[1:54:32] come and crush the enemy
[1:54:34] i thought of brother branham when he
[1:54:36] said moses mother and you ever know
[1:54:38] brother adam said that he said it over
[1:54:39] and over he said you know faith he said
[1:54:41] when when pharaoh sent out a decree to
[1:54:43] kill all the boys he said the mom he
[1:54:45] said had looked at that child and he
[1:54:46] said something struck her heart
[1:54:48] and he said and she knew this was a the
[1:54:51] promised child to come to be a deliverer
[1:54:54] brother branham says when she said that
[1:54:55] she said there was no more fear she
[1:54:58] didn't worry anymore she had faith to
[1:55:00] keep moving to take that baby brother
[1:55:02] and says you know why i said because
[1:55:03] faith has muscles
[1:55:06] faith has hair on its chest
[1:55:09] and he said and when faith speaks all
[1:55:12] the devils shut their mouths amen
[1:55:14] and i think a word of faith was spoken
[1:55:17] here tonight
[1:55:18] and the devil has to shut his mouth
[1:55:21] amen we're going to take up some more
[1:55:22] prayer requests brother brad i want you
