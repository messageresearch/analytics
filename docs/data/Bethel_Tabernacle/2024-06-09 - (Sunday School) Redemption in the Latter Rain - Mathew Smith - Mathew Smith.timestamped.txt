[11:15] you know full of all kinds of sin and
[11:18] ungodliness and so you know we we think
[11:21] you know we we recognize that you know
[11:23] the seems like the world's coming to an
[11:24] end you know it seems like the we're in
[11:25] the last days and we so we take SC like
[11:29] that and we we apply that to where we
[11:32] are now and we look to see well does
[11:35] what Paul said about what the last days
[11:36] would be apply to where we're at right
[11:38] now or where we're
[11:41] headed and I but I I had this this this
[11:46] quote here um this is from like I said
[11:48] spoken words Original Seed and it says
[11:51] there's this question that brother
[11:51] bram's trying to answer and he says why
[11:53] then has the re Revival fires let up
[11:57] don't hear very much more more of Billy
[11:59] Graham like great evangelists Oral
[12:02] Roberts not burning the country like he
[12:03] used to my meetings is not even heard of
[12:06] they're just three there's just three
[12:09] what's the matter I'm going to be kind
[12:11] of skipping through this in the in the
[12:13] interest of time so if you ever pull
[12:15] this up it's not going to read exactly
[12:16] the way I read it just because I'm going
[12:17] to be skipping a lot um to kind of get
[12:20] to the meat of what I'm trying to get at
[12:22] um it says uh now Billy Graham the world
[12:25] was burning here not long ago with Billy
[12:27] Graham very seldom hear of it now he's
[12:29] still going but what's the matter Oral
[12:32] Roberts why just burning the Earth up
[12:34] dying down Tommy Osborne all them are
[12:37] good Godly men what's happening
[12:40] believing that God called me for a
[12:41] Ministry what's happening to
[12:44] mine now here's going to answer some
[12:47] questions what's happened you say
[12:50] brother brandom yours is deadest of
[12:51] deadest of all of them that's true that
[12:55] is right Billy Graham is more heard of
[12:58] than I am and Billy is more heard of
[12:59] than oral oral is more H is more heard
[13:02] of in one day than I am in six months
[13:05] Tommy Osborne Tommy Hicks any of those
[13:08] Godly men they're more heard of so as
[13:11] far as that turn mine is further away
[13:14] than all of them what's
[13:16] happened brother brandham you're saying
[13:19] uh saying that that you tell us here and
[13:21] now that you actually believe the word
[13:23] and everything well what's happened to
[13:25] you then what's taking place that's what
[13:28] we we want to know so here he is you
[13:31] know and often times you know we this as
[13:34] message people a lot of times we get
[13:35] into this mentality of well where's the
[13:39] constant Revival meetings where's you
[13:41] know we had back in the day under in the
[13:44] 50 you know 40s 50s and into the 60s you
[13:47] had huge tent revivals and and and it
[13:50] seems like the world was swept with this
[13:53] fervency for religion and for
[13:55] Christianity back then but you don't see
[13:58] it as much anymore more right it's kind
[14:00] of fallen off people have gotten more
[14:02] secular you know and you see this and
[14:04] it's not just like you know it's not
[14:06] like people in message churches think
[14:08] this this is just typical Across America
[14:11] across the religious people of of the
[14:14] world in general um people recognize
[14:17] that the the 40s and 50s America was a
[14:20] lot more of a religious Nation right
[14:23] America was very religious it was not as
[14:26] crazy and uncommon for people to go to
[14:28] Tent Revival and to have Revival
[14:30] meetings and things I mean you if you
[14:34] got a A you know saw an advertisement
[14:37] for a tent meeting Revival in your town
[14:39] these days you'd be shocked you never
[14:41] hear of it you know but you know when
[14:44] something like that happens now it's
[14:45] national news back then it wasn't such a
[14:48] big deal like they were happening all
[14:49] over the country all the time a lot of
[14:51] different different people were doing
[14:52] this and that just kind of fell away and
[14:55] it wasn't like it wasn't like these
[14:58] meetings were just sort of there was
[15:00] nothing to them I mean
[15:03] again the our teaching on this is pretty
[15:06] clear that these these revivals had real
[15:11] signs and wonders associated with it you
[15:13] know William Brandon was not the only
[15:15] Ministry that had signs and wonders
[15:17] associated with them Oral Roberts and
[15:18] Billy Graham did too right they
[15:21] absolutely there was a lot of of um
[15:24] Power and and outpouring of the gifts of
[15:25] the Spirit that went along with these
[15:26] revivals that swept world that's why
[15:29] they had the the draw and the appeal
[15:32] that they
[15:34] had but then it just kind of fell away
[15:36] it just kind of died down and so leaves
[15:39] us wondering why why don't we see that
[15:42] anymore should we be expecting to see
[15:44] that right is that something that we
[15:46] should be we should be looking
[15:49] for and um now he says later on he says
[15:53] um that's what's the matter with it the
[15:55] seeds has been
[15:57] planted he said said I wish you could
[15:59] see what's passed passed before sorry
[16:03] passed before me then the seeds has been
[16:05] planted remember there's a planting time
[16:07] than a harvest
[16:09] time um now there has been three
[16:12] different kinds of seeds planted a
[16:14] denominational Billy Graham he was the
[16:17] head planter Oral Roberts for the
[16:20] Pentecostals Pentecostal seed has been
[16:22] planted I'm talking about organization
[16:24] now and then the word has been planted
[16:28] now you'll have to understand understand
[16:29] folks I ain't saying this is no this no
[16:31] more unless God tells me I want you to
[16:33] get this good and clear three seeds has
[16:36] been planted that's the reason the
[16:38] planting it's about over okay and then
[16:42] he starts talking about picks up Joel
[16:45] where Joel's talking about in The Book
[16:47] of Joel he start talking about the
[16:48] former and the latter
[16:50] rain and for the interest of time
[16:52] because this is going to this would just
[16:54] take all the time what we have if I try
[16:56] to read all this but I'm going to try
[16:58] sumarize a lot of it but he goes down he
[17:00] starts doing a lot of commentary about
[17:03] um The Book of Joel chapter 2 and verse
[17:06] 23 where he's talking about the former
[17:07] and latter Reign and what he's he's
[17:10] using this as a type to say listen my
[17:12] Ministry or Roberts and Billy Graham we
[17:14] are all on the Earth right now to do to
[17:17] to teach to put word into the ground
[17:21] right to plant seeds and right now there
[17:24] is an outpouring of the spirit that's
[17:25] creating all this revival amen right
[17:28] that is to water the crop because the
[17:30] way in the in the Hebrew type they plant
[17:34] their their crops in the fall because
[17:37] immediately after that you know they
[17:39] they time it right so as soon as they
[17:40] plant their seeds they get fall rains
[17:42] every year and that fall rain Waters
[17:46] their crop this is known as in here he
[17:49] calls it the Mora rain that's what it
[17:51] says in the Bible if you look at the
[17:53] original word there it's the moral rain
[17:56] which is also translated as the former
[17:57] rain also translated as the teaching
[18:00] rain it is there to allow the crop that
[18:03] they just planted to sprout and gain
[18:06] life and then you have a latter rain and
[18:10] that latter rain is what happens right
[18:11] before the Harvest that finishes the
[18:13] maturing of the of the crop okay and so
[18:17] this is you know when when the Bible or
[18:19] you hear anyone referencing former and
[18:21] latter rain that's what they're talking
[18:22] about you have a something that happens
[18:24] in your life to sort of sprout the word
[18:27] to life in your heart and then you have
[18:30] a finishing th outpouring of the spirit
[18:33] that brings to
[18:37] maturity
[18:39] now um so he he's talking about you know
[18:44] and so he's referencing that all these
[18:45] revivals that you had in the 40s and 50s
[18:47] this is all under a former
[18:49] Reign you know in the in that in that
[18:53] cycle right that you have all these
[18:55] people coming in to plant seed and then
[18:56] the spirit of God falling on it and
[18:58] creating all the
[18:59] Revival and that's new life that's
[19:01] sprouting up
[19:04] right now and this is something else I I
[19:06] just want to interject
[19:08] here anytime you're talking about this
[19:11] sort of thing um where you you know I
[19:13] best example I ever heard of this was
[19:15] actually um brother Ben seabolt who
[19:17] preached about the four horsemen and you
[19:19] know across the church
[19:21] ages and he
[19:23] says
[19:25] anytime you have a a a
[19:30] um well put it like this we know that in
[19:34] in the Bible God deals with Israel as a
[19:35] nation and he deals with the Gentiles as
[19:38] individuals right but then you can look
[19:40] at the Gentile church as a whole across
[19:42] seven Church ages and you can see
[19:43] certain things applied to the whole
[19:45] seven Church ages but you can also take
[19:48] all of that and and narrowly focus it
[19:50] down onto an individual person's life
[19:53] right you can watch The Four Horsemen
[19:55] when somebody is falling away from the
[19:57] word you can watch The Four Horsemen
[19:58] ride through the life yeah right you can
[20:01] see the type of the former and latter
[20:03] Reign operate in a Christian's life
[20:06] right you come to you come to the word
[20:07] you come to Christ that you get this
[20:09] burst of Revival life that you suddenly
[20:11] everything's wonderful everything's new
[20:13] everything's sprouting you have all this
[20:14] fresh life but then what happens is that
[20:18] former reign will end and now you have
[20:19] to grow and mature and it's you're not
[20:22] going to be getting the outpouring of
[20:23] the spirit every day like you used to
[20:25] right and now it's just going to take a
[20:27] lot of growing and maturing
[20:29] but at the end you're once you come into
[20:31] maturity then there's a fresh outpouring
[20:33] of spirit to bring you to that that
[20:34] ultimate final
[20:36] maturity
[20:38] so um so but also you can apply this on
[20:42] an individual Church age so you can take
[20:45] so here's brother Bram talking about in
[20:47] this church age you
[20:48] have a form of rain that's planted or
[20:51] that's that's comes down under a
[20:53] planting
[20:55] time
[20:56] brings uh a fr fresh like a a a
[21:02] Revival and
[21:06] um uh let's see
[21:10] here yeah so I want to I want to pick
[21:12] this up so it says now just wait a
[21:15] minute you take the word from Joel
[21:16] chapter 2 and look at it and see if the
[21:19] Hebrew word you go to the Hebrew and see
[21:21] if if it doesn't if you want to write it
[21:23] down m o u r e h Mora and get the Hebrew
[21:27] word interpret see what Mora means
[21:29] teaching the teaching Reign has went
[21:31] forth the denominational teaching Reign
[21:33] has went forth a million more in 44
[21:36] Baptists and so and so members of the
[21:37] church Oral Roberts and them brothers
[21:39] with the Pentecostal move the great
[21:41] Pentecostal move they moved up into the
[21:43] millions that's right and the seed has
[21:46] went forth the word for the minority the
[21:49] group now watch now remember the word
[21:52] Mora Mora means teaching the former
[21:56] Reign it says the rain the teaching rain
[22:00] teaching rain went forth Billy Graham
[22:02] has struck the world the Pentecostals
[22:04] struck the world and the word has struck
[22:06] the world now what's the matter now she
[22:09] is now waiting for the latter rain amen
[22:12] that's when she produces her fruits I
[22:15] hope you get it when the kind of seed
[22:18] you have planted in your field will be
[22:20] the kind of crop you will
[22:21] reap if the denominations want more
[22:24] members that's what they're going to get
[22:27] yeah that's what they have gotten the
[22:30] Pentecostals want more Pentecostals
[22:32] that's what they're going to get but the
[22:34] word is going to produce Sons and
[22:35] Daughters of God Amen that's coming too
[22:39] watch look at that great latter rain
[22:41] supposed to be done now they would run
[22:43] over the wall leap over and how they'd
[22:46] be an AR uh Army coming just wait a
[22:48] minute the kind of crop you'll get is
[22:51] the kind of seed you put in your field
[22:54] two denominational kinds you understand
[22:56] the two denominational kinds will unite
[22:58] together to go to Sodom but the word
[23:01] will stay with the elected the Royal
[23:03] seed Jesus said as it was in the days of
[23:06] Sodom so it will be the coming of the
[23:07] son of
[23:08] man now he says and what they're trying
[23:11] to
[23:12] do um they're trying to manufacture a
[23:15] latter
[23:16] rain um why the latter rain will sweep
[23:18] the world Ben a former rain sewing words
[23:22] that's right now you'll see what the
[23:24] latter rain produces you'll find out
[23:27] there'll be an a ilation the
[23:29] Pentecostals and all the groups will
[23:31] come together and they'll shut the doors
[23:33] on them guys that won't listen to it you
[23:35] won't even be allowed to open your mouth
[23:38] that's when he'll come that's when he'll
[23:40] show that's when you'll see a rain okay
[23:48] so so often
[23:51] times this is just when I I I've said
[23:53] all of this has all kind of been
[23:55] backgrounded to say kind of make this
[23:57] point
[24:00] so often times we as Christians and as
[24:04] as and The Wider Christ sort of nominal
[24:06] Christian world everybody kind of looks
[24:08] at the world and recognizes that there
[24:10] is the world is full of you know uh you
[24:15] know as we read in in second Timothy you
[24:18] know lovers of their own selves Covetous
[24:19] boasters proud Blasphemous disobedient
[24:21] to parents all these things we can look
[24:22] at the world and say okay we see all
[24:24] this corruption in the world this is
[24:26] clearly evil and wrong and and and and
[24:30] whatnot
[24:31] and there's a there's a a a tendency for
[24:35] people to look at the worst side of
[24:39] that and see that as sort of like well
[24:42] this is a sign of the end and in some
[24:43] sense you were you're you're right right
[24:46] to do
[24:47] that but don't forget that in the middle
[24:50] of all this in the list of all this
[24:54] wickedness he
[24:57] includes people having a form of
[24:59] godliness but denying the power
[25:01] thereof
[25:03] okay a form of
[25:05] godliness that they don't have a form of
[25:08] wokeness right right you know you see in
[25:11] the in the wider Christian world people
[25:13] are so focused in
[25:15] on on um sort of like the trans agenda
[25:19] or the gay agenda or the woke agenda
[25:22] however you want to phrase that we're so
[25:24] terrified of what this these different
[25:28] political movements are that they're
[25:31] starting to unite to combat it yeah
[25:34] right which on a from a purely mological
[25:38] sense you would think that's the right
[25:40] thing to do right and after all the
[25:42] Bible says that you know that it would
[25:44] be as in the days of Sodom so clearly
[25:46] wokeism has to take over the world does
[25:49] it right
[25:51] because if you study this at
[25:54] all you study the history of where a lot
[25:56] of this ideology came from
[25:59] and this isn't like some crackpot Theory
[26:02] it's just communism amen that's all it
[26:04] is it's just a communist a re a
[26:07] rehashing of Communism but using social
[26:10] acceptance as as a standin for
[26:13] economics
[26:15] and you know we know there's no
[26:18] scripture that communism is going to
[26:19] take over the world Amen it's not there
[26:23] right am the Antichrist is not going to
[26:27] come to the world preach ing a a message
[26:30] of of rainbow Flags it's not going to
[26:36] happen it it will look so close that
[26:39] it'll deceive the elect if it were
[26:41] possible it'll look just like the real
[26:43] deal right the fact of the matter
[26:48] is what people need to be on the lookout
[26:51] for is a Revival when you see the world
[26:54] suddenly get very very
[26:56] religious that's when you start raising
[26:58] your eyebrows because the reality is
[27:00] communism is a tool in the hand of God
[27:03] like Nebuchadnezzar was a tool in the
[27:04] hand of God to gather all the the the
[27:08] people at the end time right amen the
[27:13] wokeism is the rope with which God will
[27:15] bind the tears right it is how he will
[27:18] gather them together because they will
[27:20] all start running in the same
[27:21] direction right if you're if everyone's
[27:24] surrounded by by this crazy agenda they
[27:26] all start running together right and
[27:28] they will absolutely unite to fight
[27:31] it but and if you don't if you don't buy
[27:34] into it and you say well I'm not going
[27:35] to be part of that well then you'll be
[27:36] the outcast well you just must be one of
[27:38] them
[27:41] right but and what'll be so deceptive
[27:43] about it is you will see signs and
[27:45] wonders because again it'll be just like
[27:46] Oral Roberts and Billy Graham what went
[27:48] into the ground in the 1950s will come
[27:50] out at the end the seed that went in to
[27:53] the ground that's the point of a harvest
[27:55] you get more of what you put into the
[27:56] ground at the end so what they planted
[27:59] under a under a teaching reign in the
[28:01] 1950s is what they'll get at the end it
[28:04] will have Revival meetings and Holiness
[28:06] standard and it'll be maybe more of a
[28:09] Holiness standard than you have at least
[28:11] a stricter one right it'll look just
[28:14] like the real thing it'll walk talk
[28:16] sound just like the real deal right
[28:20] it'll be so close it'll even have signs
[28:22] and wonders associated with it right
[28:25] it'll have Miracles and it'll be so hard
[28:27] to say well that's not real
[28:29] Christianity the only way that you'll
[28:32] know the only way that you'll know is
[28:35] that at the end of the day they have a
[28:39] very good form of godliness but
[28:43] completely deny the power of that
[28:45] godliness they they don't have any
[28:48] actual genuine power I just want to say
[28:51] this this to my to to finish I'm kind of
[28:54] out of time and this is
[28:57] my the Crux of everything I want to
[29:07] say we know
[29:09] that um if you can pull up um uh Romans
[29:13] chapter 8 verse one for
[29:16] me
[29:20] um
[29:21] the the the the form of godliness right
[29:25] it'll be people who who will be able
[29:31] to show through the scripture how
[29:33] Holiness is a a lifestyle of not
[29:37] conforming to Holiness is against the
[29:38] word of God they will be able to show
[29:40] clearly through the scripture how
[29:42] various you know sinful lifestyles are
[29:44] against the word of God they will be
[29:45] able to show all of this but they will
[29:48] have no ability no path to changing the
[29:53] sinful nature that calls for
[29:55] it right that's the power of God that
[29:58] they will
[29:59] deny right it will
[30:01] be it'll be a good front it'll be a good
[30:04] facade they'll have a very nice face on
[30:06] it right it'll it'll look just like a
[30:10] Christian lifestyle but there's no
[30:13] internal change of the heart amen
[30:15] there's always a desire and a longing
[30:17] for that thing they'll clearly be able
[30:20] to show how you know uh uh uh uh you
[30:26] know some some ungodly lifestyle is
[30:28] against the word of God but they'll
[30:29] offer No Redemption to change it amen
[30:33] they'll offer no real pathway other than
[30:35] just
[30:37] simply I don't know do better just just
[30:40] willpower and that'll fail it'll never
[30:43] work there's no internal change of the
[30:45] nature right no internal change of the
[30:47] heart no desire
[30:49] change and so what they end up with is
[30:52] they have a letter of the law yeah with
[30:56] no and the letter kth right the letter
[31:00] kth there's it's the spirit that
[31:02] bringeth life
[31:04] amen so often
[31:09] times I I just want to look at the
[31:11] scripture here it says there's there for
[31:14] no now there is therefore now no
[31:16] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[31:18] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[31:20] after the
[31:23] spirit so many times people get caught
[31:27] up especially especially new Christians
[31:29] get caught up in lose the the ability to
[31:33] see the difference between condemnation
[31:35] and conviction yeah okay the word of God
[31:39] will convict you it will never condemn
[31:41] you okay the letter of the law a
[31:45] legalistic list of dos and don'ts will
[31:48] convi will convict you every time or
[31:50] condemn you I'm sorry every time and
[31:52] you're think what's the difference why
[31:53] is this
[31:55] important like what's the difference
[31:57] between the those two those two words
[32:00] very simply put like
[32:03] this if a man does something wrong right
[32:06] you do you do commit some sin worthy of
[32:09] death okay and you go before the judge
[32:12] and you are found
[32:13] guilty you are convicted of the crime
[32:17] you have been declared
[32:20] guilty when the sentence is passed and
[32:23] the judge s says you know I sentence you
[32:26] to hang by the neck until dead that is
[32:30] condemnation you are condemned to die
[32:33] right conviction is a statement of guilt
[32:35] and
[32:37] wrongdoing condemnation is a statement
[32:40] of how you're going to end up right it's
[32:42] a statement of of of penalty yeah right
[32:46] the word will will convict you it will
[32:48] let it will make you fully aware that
[32:51] you did wrong and that you need to that
[32:53] you you were
[32:55] wrong the law will send you to
[32:58] hell right but there's a the different
[33:03] like there's a window in there between
[33:05] you know when the man is sitting in the
[33:07] in the jail cell looking out Between the
[33:08] Bars watching him build the
[33:10] Gallows he's
[33:12] been convicted of the crime and he's
[33:16] waiting for his the
[33:18] condemnation right he's watching him you
[33:21] know tie the
[33:22] news but in that window There's an
[33:24] opportunity for a pardon and that's why
[33:28] because of because of redemption that's
[33:30] why we can have no condemnation you can
[33:33] come under conviction every day but it
[33:36] doesn't matter because there's there's a
[33:37] there's an advocate pardoning everything
[33:39] that you do right there's an you have an
[33:42] advocate with the father who's bringing
[33:44] but it it is a it is entirely dependent
[33:46] on on people's willingness to admit
[33:48] guilt yeah and admit their fault and
[33:50] come subject to the word
[33:53] and what is what is um
[33:59] what's
[34:00] coming for the in the end time what what
[34:03] is going to trip people up and what is
[34:05] going to be the snare is that it is
[34:07] going to be a a word a a me a a a a
[34:14] false gospel preached that as long as
[34:17] you can live a legalistic standard you
[34:20] will make it and there will be no change
[34:22] of the heart and there will be it will
[34:24] ultimately condemn the world yeah am
[34:28] right because of because of a a refusal
[34:34] to recognize where their heart doesn't
[34:37] line up to the word of God Amen and we
[34:39] are out of time so I'm going to
[34:42] quit we can stand and have a word of
[34:49] prayer father I trust that you could
[34:53] take
[34:55] this scattered words that I would say
[34:58] and and piece it together for the people
[34:59] that maybe someone would have been
[35:01] encouraged
[35:03] and grab hold of something true and
[35:07] anchor themselves with it Lord it
[35:10] there'd be
[35:10] no no fear of the end Lord because there
[35:14] would be a recognition that we have a
[35:20] peace we have a savior
[35:23] Lord I ask that you would go with us
[35:26] throughout the day that you would be
[35:27] with us in the in the worship service
[35:28] and into the preaching of the Gospel
[35:30] preaching of the
[35:32] word we ask this thing in name of the
[35:34] Lord Jesus Christ amen
