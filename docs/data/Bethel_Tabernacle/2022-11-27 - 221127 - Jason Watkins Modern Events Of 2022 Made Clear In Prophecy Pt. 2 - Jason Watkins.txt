have you all back after the Thanksgiving holiday we've got a number of visitors today and a number of families out of town still on the Thanksgiving holiday traveling back we want to remember them all in prayer in fact as I had a couple extra prayer requests just for that amen praise the Lord but Joseph good to see you and sister Rachel here today and uh happy to have them and sister um Chastity sent please remember us in prayers we are driving back to Beaufort today also requesting prayer for Donna Marie Tyree she's breast cancer survivor and has just finished radiation they saw a spot on one of her lungs in a previous CT and are examining it again today they said it could be a scar from a past infection but please pray that it has gone completely we sure will do that amen and we know that God heals cancer amen we appreciate doctors they are uh God's mercy brother Branham said it was God's mercy to suffering Humanity amen given to suffering Humanity but once it goes beyond the doctors if you remember brother Jack gave his testimony when that guy hit sister Kathy head on at high speed like that and pushed her engine all the way into the car and the doctors tell brother Jack he said I'll give her a five percent chance survive the night so you're looking at 95 percent God actually you're looking at a hundred percent God performing the other 95 percent that the doctors couldn't do brother Jack said you do all you can and I'll trust the Lord God for the rest amen and we've had many many times where God has healed and curable diseases and spared us and redeemed us oh mine the greatest healing we ever had happened in our soul the Lord never heals my body again what he did in my soul amen I'll never get sick there again pass from Death to life and that death can never come back into that area again happy to have my two aunts here today Amen brother Matt called him his aunts but they're actually mine which makes them his great aunts so I'll tell you you always

in the name of the Lord happy to have you in the house of God there's brother JD's parents still with us amen so a number of people sick we want to just pray for him but Joe good to see you out on a rainy day buddy God bless you amen we're going to take up this request and the families that are driving and traveling uh coming home we want the Lord just to give them perfect safe passage amen we're going to look in our Bibles before we pray in Revelation chapter 10 amen I want to by the help of the Lord continue today I want to speak on the ministry of Malachi 4 part 2. amen praise the Lord just we're just going to read a very familiar verse the very first one of chapter 10. and verse 1 Revelation chapter 10 verse 1. I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the son and his feet as pillars of fire now I want you to notice that there's some there's some notable things here okay he is he is an angel he's a mighty Angel all right he did come down from heaven he is clothed with a cloud amen there is a rainbow upon his head now watch the language switch and his face was as it were the Sun not that his face is the Sun it's as the sun and his feet not let their pillars of fire but their ass pillars of Fire praise the Lord amen let's pray father we thank you for your divinely revealed truths today Lord I pray that you continue to help me to lay the foundation of this thought Lord As We are continuing from last week and we confess that we only got past the foundation or got into the foundation we'll carry on with that today there's still a burden of my heart laying forward that I don't think I'll get to today but that's all right Lord I I feel I have exactly what you want to say today so we commit it all to you Lord we're asking a special Grace for the families traveling in Lord that you'll keep them safe we're so happy that you bless them allow them to go and visit family and Lord be away and they're all coming home now today so a number of them Lord would you just watch over them these dangerous wet roads I pray for your mercy and your blessing upon every every point of their Journey Lord for this sister who our sister Chastity turns in this request we thank you Lord for your blessing on This Woman's and thus far are and we're asking for that Lord You're continued and complete blessing upon her that this will all end Lord redounding completely to your glory we give you thanks for our visitors today and we ask now do you be with us in a special way in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated praise the Lord so I I managed last week to lay some foundation on a burden that's on my heart and I was looking back over the notes as I was as I was probably the last third we were able to kind of turn it um you know introspectively and that's always to me the value of the word the the the preaching doesn't really come just to fill your head full of data all right I'm not here just to just to you know talk about all the advances in theology that we have because as we've said before the gospel this message which is the gospel restored didn't come to just fill up our heads with theology we you say well we we have Superior theology here there wouldn't we naturally have that with the opening of the seals and the restoration of the word you would but you didn't do anything that was him so come off your high horse and just say thank God that blessed are your eyes that see in your ears that hear for many have desired and it wasn't granted but we realize that that God has indeed given us and but you know what what is really important in the in the understanding of deeper things of God is why God brought it to you and I've already said it's not just to increase your theological understanding it's far more than that it's it's actually to because you are what you eat and you're the things you gaze at you're transformed into the Bible teaches us so yes uh if God wants us to become the perfect image of Christ at the end time which is what the prophecy said would happen for the bride she would come perfectly into his image and that and that would enable the Capstone to have an invisible Union and we have that then we realize then it's far more than just head knowledge it's got to get down into the gears down into the engine room and it's got to have some way to make the word live it's not just restoring signs and wonders and powers and miracles how about a power to be an overcomer how about a power to have a simple life of prayer like brother Caleb was ministering on today how about a determination and an impossible situation to say I'm going to press on regardless of how weird I become to the world what an oddball does it matter I'm going to press on because I'm I've I've been brought into the to the vision of the word of God so it's for our ratification it's for correction it's it's uh you know and you you you want to think you know introspection is so good because uh you know we don't just want to be Camp Stars we don't just want to run from service to service from meeting to meeting and Shout here and Shout here and Shout there but we're only shouting at the meetings and everywhere in between see so so we want to apply the word down into our hearts so as we looked at it last Sunday we were really talking about a lot of things that thrilled the bride it just Thrills us and it's hard to to keep calm and the stimulation from it stimulation as brother Brenda would say stimulation amen boy wow amen so but but you know it's not about just blowing it out the whistle it's get that Steam down into the gears and make this locomotive start going down the track all right so that's that's what we want so you know we were able then last week to hit a few things which were real burdens of my heart and uh how that it it should have an effect in our lives and it ought to just as you've heard me say many times the only difference between affect and effect is one letter but the meaning is vastly different you can come here and get thrilled in the word and be greatly affected your Cry tears and feel Goosebumps and want to jump and run but does it affect change when you leave here has change been affected in your life I don't just want to be affected I want to be affected by the word of God that is my all-consuming burning desire is to come into this image oh my it don't don't take me into a seven course meal and and it's so magnificent and I lick my chops and tell me I I can't really eat it if if I'm gonna get to go see it let me have a feast and let me eat it let me assimilate it [Music] we're not here to leave the same way in fact as you can't that's the that's both the blessing and the danger uh the curse as it were you say God would bless and curse he sure would he told Israel made him walk between Mount druism and mount evil and he put priests on this side on Mount charism and put priest over here on evil and the children of Israel had to walk between those two mountains and these priests shouted blessings for keeping God's word and these priests shouted cursings for breaking his word and as the Israelites walked through there they had to hear it in stereo they had to go right through the middle of that and make up they were you talking about being in the valley of decision so when you come here to the house of God to hear the word of God this isn't a place to play this isn't Disney World this is this is the valley of decision and people are gaining eternal life are forfeiting their own Mercies and that's why Prophet said you can't leave the same you will either leave and prove you'll leave better or you'll leave worse you'll leave with the deficit I don't want to deficit I want to I want to be a plus I want a game Hallelujah and the only way you gain the only way the only inescapable way is application you must apply the word of God knowing is half the battle but knowing is half the battle amen the other side is always application interestingly when we come to this statement in our scripture and and so by the help of God today I have two great burdens of introspection I probably will only get to one of them today and we'll have to save the other one for next time the Lord willing it's interesting because that when you see this term and I saw another Mighty angel all right so this term another now ironically I I when you read the theological um what will we call it the you know the the the the agreed upon standard among theologians who read this passage that you read today and you see that it says another Mighty Angel and so we realize that that the we find that that their their problem this great debate is over the identity of this angel because you know some insist that it's Christ all right and and and there's a lot of good reasons for that and even the theologians admit that but in spite of all the evidence and there there's a litany I could go down the bullet list today I'm trying to save time but just by the description alone you can see that it's Christ but in spite of all this evidence the theologians remain unconvinced of something you so freely accept they remain by and large unconvinced you'll find the ones here and there who suggest it could be but overwhelmingly they remain unconvinced because and it all goes back to a Greek word because the the Greek word for another I saw another Mighty Angel one meaning another of the same kind and the second meaning another of a different kind so if this Angel were Jesus one Theologian postulates if this Angel were Jesus Christ he would certainly expect to find the second term used for he would be an angel vastly different from this one blowing trumpets or any other angel in this book for that matter so so it so they would expect that if it's Jesus it would have to say an angel of a different kind but the but the reason they remain unconvinced that it's Christ is because it uses the Greek word of the same kind another Angel of the same kind all right and so so he says here he concludes that that he is the uncreated Eternal existing Son of God yet John uses the word that means another of the same kind so this ain't this is an angel not Jesus Christ and when I started reading that I just sit back in my chair and I just thought my goodness what great things God has opened up to us but here I went and I told my wife I said here I am with no formal training in theology all my training is auto didactic from a child just studying it myself with no certifications and yet these men have committed their whole lives to years and years and years yes and yes and yet here I am and I have a better understanding than they have because this is this is this is the exact misunderstanding that you would have when the mystery of the godhead is not clear to you so so now you've got to get your mind wrapped around the fact today that understanding the godhead is not just is he one two or three because every one of those human interpretations is an error see so he's not one like the Oneness he's not three like the trinitarians he's not two like two Lords see but but we do find out that the mystery is in expression because God has expressed himself and therefore his word and he are the same thing this is just another expression of the same Eternal God see so Jesus was just another expression this Angel this this is this is the beauty of you understanding The Mystery of the godhead because to really understand what the seventh seal revealed is in the godhead you're part of it [Music] so now it's not one two or three it's a whole church full it's a whole nation full it's a whole world full this is Christ in you the hope of glory this is the great mystery that they miss out on they haven't understood it since the days of irenaeus brother Branham said that second messenger was the last one to have a clear understanding of the godhead and it wasn't restored until our day when it was prophesied to be so now so now when we look at the godhead and we see the Plan of Redemption just remember it's you say it's all about him well she is him and he is her and it's all one expression of God expressing itself down through age that's why everybody in the Bible is all expressing one goal that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world oh my no wonder it changes Our Lives because when we hear it are there something inside of me that starts lining up to it and there wasn't enough sin in this flesh to stop that from happening there's no birth no raising no culture no mistakes no failures not enough devils in hell just stop the Inner Man from saying Amen to every word the true God is known in expression I mean this is why Jesus could come in Saint John 14 and in the 17th verse speaking of the spirit of Truth he says for he dwelleth with you he's standing there looking at him the spirit of oh Lord we need the spirit of Truth yeah he's right here where's he at he's dwelling with you where hello he's right here you know he he holds up a coin and he says whose image and superscription is this and they said oh that's Caesar so here they could see the image of Caesar and they couldn't see the image of God looking right at him so he says this the spirit of Truth for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you he comes down to the 18th verse I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you verse 20. at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you then he goes on three verses later if a man loved me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him this is all about the family friends this is all about God expressing himself that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's Christ Living Through you and you buy a new birth experience so a sad misunderstanding of the church is a beautiful reality for the followers of The Last Day message and that reality is that of course this angel of course this Angel would be another of the same kind because it's the same God that John saw in chapter one seated on the throne it's the same one Daniel saw as the Ancient of Days it's the same one living in and through a bride making her part of God's godhead [Applause] this is why he descended in a cloud that we read in in 10 verse chapter 10 verse 1. and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud see this is a living Cloud this you find these references give me uh Matt give me um or whoever's running there give me Leviticus 16 2. let's look at three a few places Leviticus 16 2 and the Lord said unto Moses speak unto Aaron thy brother that he come not at all times in the Holy place within the veil before the mercy seat which is upon the ark that he die not look at it for I will appear in the cloud upon The Mercy Seat Daniel chapter 7. all right Daniel chapter 7 verses 13 and 14. I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the Clouds Of Heaven look at this these are living clouds I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory in a kingdom that all people Nations it's not hard to tell who this is talking about and that all people Nations and languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away look at it and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed his kingdom you don't have a kingdom unless you've got subjects Hallelujah this is the ever increasing Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ the kingdoms of this Earth have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ not to Lords but Christ and his entire family since Genesis to now from Genesis to revelation that's the kingdom friends that will never know an end if you're looking to live forever you need to be a part of that Kingdom Hebrews 12. here's another one Hebrews 12 verse 1. wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every wait and see now look at thee look at the responsibility you take on when you realize that the mighty Angel descended clothed with a cloud because you're looking at Christ identified in his body that's the whole that's the whole descending purpose he doesn't descend to give you more knowledge he descended down to become you and you become him and that's the hour we have arrived at because that's true then let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us so it's an admonition if you would do it automatically Paul wouldn't have needed to say it this is a this is a a kick in the pants as they say to to bust up complacency this is this is an inoculation against the laodicea and flu I'm here to tell you covet is a is a is a kindergarten compared to the laodicea flu this is under the seventh file that got released on the men's minds and it's driving insanity of the world but there's a cure there's a remedy there's an inoculation Hallelujah let us lay aside every weight since he came in a cloud since that represents a family since you're part of that family then let us lay aside every weight in the Sin which doth so easily beset us people choose it or they don't people that believe the message of the hour not no kidding they don't have they don't fake believe it they really do still don't lay aside every weight you're talking about a travesty uh you're talking about an injustice against God to have come down and descended down in his Living Word and brought you into it and pulled you into the mystery and made you a part of the mystery and now this one this mystery that wanted to have fellowship with you all along the mystery was never Doctrine the mystery wanted Fellowship oh my and to have that happen to you and you're uh you're a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of humanity and then you won't lay aside every wait and sin that beset you and run don't walk Skip Hop run the race that is set before us it's sad it's what you want to talk about what what takes sleep and what takes my sleep away at night it's people who I know love God and believe this word but won't do that won't do that don't let me don't let me get sidetracked so it all symbol he had a rainbow about his head that means a covenant brother I'm saying it's a covenant angel and a prophet would go right to the Chinese laundromen and he said you go in there you write your name on a piece of paper and he rips it right down where you wrote and then he holds the upper half with the upper half of your name and you've got the bottom half with your name and when you bring them back you can't just match the paper the letters have to match if you've got to you the same Jesus in the beginning has to be the same Jesus in the end it can't change Hallelujah the idea he's a covenant he's coming down with the upper half you've got the lower half Hallelujah you're the parties coming down to to match that Mr Jesus and Mrs Jesus are the same Hallelujah his feet are the same pillars of fire because because it's God divided into his family now he didn't say his feet were the what's the pillar of Fire he said it was pillars because in the upper room at in the upper room in Jerusalem he divided himself into his church and pillars of fire clothing tongues of fire rested upon all of those Hallelujah so it that you understand when you read Revelation 10 1 we you understand that this is this is you're looking at the imagery of God coming as a kingdom a kingdom of saints Christ and his bride his body the true church the bride of Christ no wonder no wonder it didn't say in the Greek another of a different kind because she is him she's the same as him Hebrews 13 8 shows us that that's how she's the same as him she's not literally him she's the same as him she's life of his life word of his word see that's expression so so my children are the expression of me they're bone of my bones sell of my cell see so so when he appears here in Revelation 10 1 he comes not as the nail scarred man not seen in the earth until revelation 19. see he doesn't come as the nail scarred man that the world is looking for they finally see that in Revelation 19 but here in Revelation 10 he comes in the form of his word and by his Spirit he's invisibly United as one in his bride on the earth at the end time that's prophecy so what's happened to us isn't something we made up it's not something William Branham invented this is just God sending a messenger with the prophecy to say Now's the Time this is going to happen it's an invisible Union it's invisible to the unregenerate world to theologians he's an impenetrable mystery they only see him as the nail scarred Nazarene now it's not an invisible display I want to make that clear it's not in it you're supposed to have it on display you understand let this mind which was in Christ be in you let it work for you see last we'd already read lay aside every weight and sin that keeps you from displaying it because it's not supposed to be an invisible display see it's it's not an invisible uh display but an invisible understanding of how it works that's what the world don't understand how how do we see the word uh needed for a Rapture beyond the the saved Christians unwise virgins saved Christian saints Saints righteous how how is it that we see the word needed for a Rapture Beyond those saved Christians who miss it and end up in a tribulation period there is only one viable answer the gene of God and election they don't see The Mystery of the Mighty God unveiled multiplied in the form of his family they don't they they they you know we we become more even more of an oddball how do we how why are we going so much further away from being politically correct and every day we get further away from it I I'm just I'm just wanna I just want to remind the world I I he doesn't change I don't change his word don't change if if there's distance coming between me and the world it's because the world's backsliding and I ain't going I ain't going I'm moving on up Hallelujah going up higher I'm not even looking I don't this world is not my home I'm it will be but it's not my home now Hallelujah so the word made flesh in the Earth again this is the mystery of the son of man this is the final voice to the final age in fact the only version of Jesus the world will see before the end they look to see him they won't this is the bride form of his word made flesh invisibly United to Christ she the same as him is the only form of Christ they will see before it's too late so and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow was about his head his face was as it were the Sun how beautiful his face was as it were the Sun now watch this because brother Brandon reminds us how that they had to put a veil over the face of Moses because they couldn't the the glory was just too much they couldn't gaze at it see and so and and then Jesus when when Jesus was transfigured he he glistened he was transfigured right before them and his his whole his whole body looked like the blazing sun so it shouldn't surprise us when Moses was like that and Jesus was like that and I say to you that he descended down in the image of it of Christ and his family united it shouldn't surprise you that his face is as it were the son no more than pillars of fire or clothed in a cloud or have a rainbow about his head my so it's all like the other notable descriptions it's all God manifesting in his family clicking along faster than I'd expected so maybe we'll we will get to we'll see now I want to approach you know my my first burden brother Branham says in the message a hidden life I love that sermon he said in a voice out of a cloud said this is my beloved Son hear you him set him upon a mountain put the witness there to see witness is there to see it remember Peter James and John witnesses there to see it clothed him in a robe as bright as the sun shining they even Shine Like the Sun in its strength and God spoke out and said this is my beloved Son hear you him now this is going to turn a corner and it's going to hit you square between the eyes this is about adoption of the whole this you're looking at the process for adopting the whole family this is what's going to this is the same process that you're going to have to go through and to to operate the prophecy that God has for you to operate so he says this is my beloved Son hearing him sat upon a mountain put the witnesses there to see it clothe him with a robe as bright as the sun shining they even Shine Like the Sun in its strength God spoke out this is my beloved Son hear ye him God adopted his own child into the family hear me no longer but this is my son who takes over from here One play because when he come to the water he didn't say that he said my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell and that was it it's all he said but now Jesus has went to the Wilderness and he's overcome The Temptations of the enemy now he's come out and I started in his ministry now he's proving himself faithful now you know what he's done he's been willing to lay aside the weights and sins of the world pressing upon him say but he wasn't born in sin right but in every way he was tempted just like you and me but he would steal away in prayer he would talk to the father he spent his life in Dedication that made him an overcomer and now he comes up on the mountain of transfiguration and the voice repeats this is my beloved Son he's never going to be disqualified and neither will you be disqualified Hallelujah says the same thing this might beloved Son but now he adds an addendum hear ye him this is adoption why'd you say that's pretty strong watch what he says God adopted his own child in the family hear me no longer but this is my son who takes over from here brother Brandon said in another place I think it was uh the uh the statue of perfect man he said in other words God said I will sit down now his words are spirit and life so he adopted his child into his own family hear me no longer but this is my son who takes over from here amen that adoption is near the time in parable of the church it's time for that so now he brought it right around you're standing here like like Peter James and John and you're looking at all this and suddenly the word turns and says but now that time is on you now you're the one going to go forward with my word you're going to be the one who now lays aside every weight and sin you're going to be the one who lets the mind which was in Christ be in you the adoption is near the time and parable of the church it's time for that he says in the message Shalom speaking of the darkness on the last age when we see Darkness settling and boy 1964 wood to God we could have that kindergarten day again as far as darkness is concerned I appreciate all the advances like anybody but boy I sure don't appreciate the overspreading of abomination I sure don't appreciate the darkness that's times a thousand see when we see the darkness settling Darkness just before day we know this is so I'm so glad we know that the morning star is hanging Yonder to introduce the coming Sun so this was God's remedy to the darkness the burgeoning darkness what's the ministry of the day star you understand the ministry God was saying I'm going to send you I'm going to have you here in an impossible time I'm even gonna finish up with my Prophet I'm going to take him home and you're going to go all the way to 77 and Beyond a time so dark a prophet couldn't even see and thought nobody could survive it you're going to go to 87 and 97 and 07 and 17 and here we are today coming to the end of 22. and it's more it's it's so in dark it's impossibly dark it's impossibly dark but here's the ministry of the Morning Star to do what it's you're you're you're you're the final voice to the final age because it's it's that's when the Morning Star shines bad news it had to be this evil for you to shine and the way this worked the way the Machinery works this thing's geared is it's got to get worse and worse for you to get brighter and brighter [Music] say Lord I want to run there's nowhere to run as I've said to you before there's no way out but up Hallelujah there's no way out but up you might as well fight you might as well buckle down you might as well take it seriously because you ain't getting out of here Hallelujah it's going it's the going in between so you know I I don't want to take the time to to read about it or even I was going to put up the pictures but it would Sidetrack me and I'm not really preaching about that I I found a curious thing that never caught ever caught before and brother Brandon preached um modern events make clear by prophecy brother Branham really didn't talk about the politics and political you know there was times we talked about you know what's going on in in Khrushchev and Castro and Washington and Eisenhower and this one and that one in the Rome the Vatican and you know what's happening but but in in in this epic sermon modern events made clear in Prophecy one of his last sermons he says to that audience if I never see you again and he never would he's days away from going home and in there what he took up was the the religious World in Prophecy and he showed in the Bible everything that the modern Christian Church was to be and said now look out you see it right it's described it's all tables full of vomit it's Harlot daughters following a system that's scripture words not me don't don't don't cancel me I'm only quoting a scripture words she was a harlot she was a she had Harlot daughters and they meet under names of blasphemy see so so we so we find out then that that we come to this time and and so I'm not here to really talk about I don't really have to come up here and be a news reporter thank God I don't have to be a news reporter because you see the same filth that I see and I I was just looking at at two particular articles and I only use these two I could have used 200. because every day you open the news here's five more now you cannot believe it's happening and ten years ago only it would have been unthinkable one is a California Early Childhood teacher she's she's teaching preschoolers she teacher admits to using what she calls a gender unicorn to instruct three and four-year-olds on sexual attraction and the teachers union is supporting her I've said for years public schools are no place for a child of God and their children there's too many other alternatives that that are out there available to you three and four-year-olds she uses this gender unicorn and she's got I don't even want to describe it it's obscene it's vulgar nasty filthy and and her herself a transsexual a transgender who had the who had the the change you don't really change you just get surgery for nothing now this is what they're teaching how they're teaching preschoolers on sexual attractions so that they understand that if a little boy feels like he likes another little boy then at three and four years old he can get instructed how that he's probably homosexual and his parents can get counseling on how to nurture him you say brother Jason that is that makes me cringe yeah it does but it's here's here's the sad part I'm only reading you headlines I'm only reading you headlines the world has become so desensitized to this another young girl she says here's the headline my high school punished me and they did they suspended her and and wanted us make her go to counseling my high school punished me for saying male students shouldn't be allowed to watch me undress in my locker room she's 14. and there's boys who woke up on Monday and said I think I'm a girl and now they get to go in to the locker rooms of the girls at 14. send your kids to those hell holes if you want but I'm gonna tell you what it is it is one of the most highest forms of child abuse known to God in man [Music] now I'm so grossed out I want to move on I want to say this so now that's a modern event made clear in Prophecy this book said that would happen and it's happening I was sitting in a barber shop where I've been going for years and conversation come up and I just and and you know Jim he has great respect for me not as much as I'd like for him to have all the time but but he's he's got a good heart and I I don't hesitate to talk to him and witness to him and all it doesn't matter there's four or five guys in there I'll start talking about the Lord and they all they all know in the sheriff's department chaplain and the pastor and they so there's like okay the pastor's gonna start preaching and I do ain't for the conversation to come up about you know the craziness in the world and that's my little open door to say look there's not it doesn't matter nothing this name pick up a topic doesn't matter which one you want you want to talk about religion you want to talk about politics you want to talk about the environment you want to talk about science and education technology you want to talk about social Fabrics you want to talk about social trends you want to talk about whatever uh War uh threat monetary system doesn't matter I will take you in this book in this book and I will show you that everything you're questioning was supposed to be exactly what you see and just pick a topic any topic I don't care we can prove it God knew it would be this impossible I'm here to tell you something friends as I was saying to you earlier you better pick up your sword and fight because nobody's getting out of here alive absolutely nobody those who are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord will have to actually be changed and a moment in the twinkling of an eye and you know something that'll have to start with a spiritual death first nobody's getting out of here alive you're gonna have to die one way or another I just say Lord God take my life and give me Jesus in the morning when I Rise Give Me Jesus Hallelujah [Applause] the Bible doesn't even say that Enoch Journey To Heaven it says he was found not because God translated him see God just took him he didn't walk off to Heaven God took him my but he had this testimony that he pleased God I just said take my life Lord may I be pleasing that's got friends everything I'm preaching today is that sentence take my life Lord that I can be pleasing the same way you took Enoch take me Hallelujah change my heart oh God Transform Me by the word let the love of God burn in my heart is that really your desire today friends say let the love of God burn in my heart oh God Hallelujah brother Adam goes on in Shalom It's always darkest just before just a few minutes before day the blackout comes the moon fails to shine The Darkest Day the darkest before day is because the light is pressing the darkness and that interesting we know that's true Hunters know that but the Morning Star comes out and says good morning peace shalom Lord the world good morning but Lord the sin and it's crazy and if you only knew that peace Shalom good morning it's all it's all good I'm in control Hallelujah good morning shalom arise shine for the light has come to you I love how a prophet amplifies that the light has come to you arise shine the light has come to you it could have went to anyone else it came to you say I don't feel worthy it came to you I don't know how this happened I neither do I but it came to me it came to you Hallelujah the light Vindicated again God's word soul that you can see God manifested in his promise of the light of the day that's why it did it it Vindicated light Vindicated again God's word so that you can see God manifested in his promise of the light of the day or the word given to the sage see these promises that's made for this day these promises that was said by the prophets and by Jesus himself in this day God and Sunday Times Hebrews one we all know it give me Hebrews chapter 1 G Hebrews chapter 1. and verse 1. this is very familiar reading to us God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets all right in other words God who at sundry times God who at different times the Holman reads it God who at different times at God's singular who at different times and in different ways spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophet so it doesn't matter if it was Jehovah talking to Abraham or Jesus talking to Matthew it didn't matter if it was if it was Christ talking to to to the devil in the wilderness or he's talking to Paul saying Paul Saul Saul why persecute us thou me and it's the same God when Paul says to you let this mind which was in Christ the one that's come in me now let it come in you it came from him it came to me now I'm giving it to you and that's what a prophet had happened to him in this day under a restoration the spiritual pattern is always in that kind of a promise see that that's that's really you're looking at in Hebrews 1 1 you're looking at a pattern Dr zodiatis uses this word sundry meaning many parts God who in sundered times zodiati says it like this Sunday many parts incremental and Progressive manner in which God disclosed himself up until the appearance of the sun it was fragmentor fragmentary Peace by peace so the one God expressed himself through the Old Testament in incremental in a progressive manner all the way up until Jesus was the embodiment of all of the progressions of all of the increments now listen friends the beauty of that is there's not one not one in that Old Testament who lived their increment perfectly not one of them Abraham doubted ran off to Egypt backslid Moses got angry lost his temper and smoked Christ twice David lied killed and committed adultery I mean come on friends look at him don't let's not even talk about Solomon or Jacob my goodness but do you realize that when Jesus came the Fulfillment all those increments became perfected and when he arose there arose Hallelujah do you have that same hope for yourself coming up to the end time so I'm not might not be living my part out right but when he comes I'll be like him [Applause] Hallelujah so a prophet was sent in our day to gather up to do what to do what to repair all the many parts of the word that had been skewed that had been violated and fractured and splitting she shifted and torn and reversed and flipped all the parts of the of Christ what it meant for Christ to be living in you the hope of glory and for 2 000 years all the parts got skewed around by denominational ideas so so so so so down Through the Ages listen it wasn't it wasn't the scriptures that varied that was the interpretation varied in the lives of the church Luther saw to it swingly Knox Calvin a huss they saw to it that the word nobody could change the word they got a hold of it and and sometimes lost their life making sure you got an accurate Bible it was never the word that got skewed but not the scriptures but the interpretation of the scriptures in the lives of the people and that's what He restored a prophet came back to bring back the right interpretation and the only way that could happen is to unlock all the Mysteries and fix all of the doctrine and fix all of the teachings so that a bride could eat Thoroughbred food and become a thoroughbred bride Hallelujah their standards varied mostly backsliding in the church and that was from the top down and thus the power of God declined it had to so a great promise of God is that at the end time he would restore the original word to restore the original interpretation he would have ladies again and right in a time when coming up under the fifth trumpet they started to decline and and and and coming right into the turn of the century and the wolves are about to start and the the fifth Trump and the fifth vial and then it's gonna from there it's gonna go to the six to bring on World War II and the whole thing is is moving in Prophecy and and women come in in 1912 for the first time and start bobbing their hair it was never done in the Christian church women died because they wouldn't cut their hair and so and and the Bible says that that little scorpions came on the the lid was torn from hell and the and and and an angel descends from Heaven that that has the key to the bottomless pit and Brethren ties that right back to Isaiah 14 how are they fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning so we can see who was given the key we can see who unlocked the bottomless pit and Satan is now given some more extra power to start bringing on the end time Hallelujah it says that they got stings and they'll torment the women they got long hair brother Brandon said like one preacher said to him he was looking at these long-haired boys and he and he said an old-time preacher old Pentecostal preacher where they really knew how boy ought to look and how a lady ought to look and he said an Old Timer stepped up to him and said brother Billy said he's got hair like women should have brother Branham we greatly appreciating that statement and said those scorpions came out had stings in the Tails and they tormented the women brother I'm said tormented they had hair long like a woman to torment the woman who had cut theirs off and that started in 1912 and World War one starts in 1914 and that's the first woe and that now you're in Revelation 7. now you've got an angel ascending out of the East with the Seal of the Living God that's Christ of course Holy Ghost is the only one that can give you the seal and he's saying hold up stop everything and they stop World War One mysteriously because I've got to seal the rest of my servants you can't run ahead this whole thing's got to run in sync the politics the religion the chaos the Blackness the message the messenger the people I've got to be able to separate it's got to go all down through history and I got to keep this thing in a rhythm this is like a symphony Hallelujah oh man there's going to be a people who March to the step of the Gospel and it tormented those women say how'd it torment them because in this two 24 months after they started bobbing their hair they're going to lose husbands and Sons by the Millions they're going to lose husbands and Sons it came to torment the women who cut theirs off and this message come to restore back what a real lady is and what a real man is and a real character is Hallelujah friends I'm not ashamed of this gospel it's the power of God under salvation and we stand for it here hallelujah you you you men young and old and everything in between don't walk around with worldly kind of hairstyles look like a decent Son of God and you sisters let your hair grow stop cutting it off it's your glory God gave it to you stop chasing after the Fashions of this world it's going to Ash and send her this is not your destiny me your destiny is to ascend Hallelujah and I started putting on garments that pertained to a man and Men started carousing and smoking and cursing and drinking socially and brother Branham was pleading with those Pentecostals he said your Founders never did that they never they never lived Bosworth never did that that Wigglesworth never did that Arthur pink never did that these people stood for holiness and Pentecost had two options they had two options either be restored or kick him out [Music] I don't think I need to tell you which one they chose see this was a restoration of the Living Word and and it was going to be alive and living in Saints with the same power the same signs the same overcoming life this this is what would restore shalom this is what will give you the peace that passes understanding is when you allow the word of God to dwell in you richly you want peace you want Shalom let the word dwell in you richly let it permit it allow it God won't force it on you see it would bring a this this this much this restoration of God's family into his very image that that it was so much in His image that a prophet would actually call it the bright coming of Christ boy that's a mouthful it would bring a whole new understanding of what the Rapture would even be and how it would unfold in stages only culminating in the Saints resurrecting and bodies being changed the beautiful secret of the Rapture that everybody's waiting for that's only the last phase that's the finishing move the Rapture gathered a pride it's already on right now Hallelujah this end time word came to do what to totally finish and complete Redemption for the Gentile Church before they see him in Revelation 19 when it's too late now let me carry on with my theme I'm gonna I'm out of time I'm gonna take five or seven more minutes because as I said to you we you know I'm not here today just to wow you with theology you know we we of course we have some new ones here you know Sister Evelyn has been so journeying with us for a while uh we've had brother Chris St John coming back and he's got a lot of questions and and and we've got and we've got our growing youth who are growing who need to know these things who need to know these things come on let me tell you something parents I'm going to need your help for sure I can't teach them everything they get coming here for an hour and a half to hear me waving scream and jump I'm gonna need your help and it ain't gonna do you much good to say it if you're not living it not to mention we have an internet audience and that's our Outreach but but but but but that's so that's not really my theme today I'm not really here I'm only laying foundation for my theme but I'm kind of already on it but all of the different correlations in scripture these are things you know they were well taught in these things we Rejoice over them but as brother Branham said this is the cut the time of adoption where this is this parable's now got to be in you see and this is my real first burden of the word today brother Branham says here in the Patmos vision and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now the words made flesh in his church dwelling Among Us his angels in his hand ministering God you hear me God is depending upon his church God is relying on us of this age to bring this Gospel Light to a dying heathen-bound traditional World God is laying the burden on me and you all I can do is accept for me will you accept for you how many are here today who will say count me in I will take up that burden joette says Judd makes this statement brilliant statement he says evil now listen I'm going to read you this and I'm going to make a few comments and we're going to hit pause and I'll finish it next time still got you yeah it didn't take off and go to Walmart on me or anything did you you still here all right evil never surrenders its hold without a sore fight with that soak this is a managed thinker brilliant brother evil here's his years of experience in busting heads with devils evil never surrenders it's hold without a sore fight this is a Warrior come back from the battlefield to tell you this we never pass into any spiritual inheritance through the delightful exercises of a picnic but always not most of the time joette says but always through the Grim contentions of the battlefield it is no secret it is so it is so in the secret Realm of the Soul every faculty which wins its spiritual freedom I got a bunch of those that I need to win spiritual freedom oh brother Caleb was talking about you know your memory your re or Matthew memory reason affection conscious imagination your sight your your your your your your smell your touch your taste your hearing all of these things that make up your flesh those ten inlets and Outlets that's how Satan finds access to you and poisons you see so he says this is how the secret Realm of the Soul every faculty which wins its spiritual Freedom you want to win every every faculty which wins its spiritual Freedom does so at the price of blood a pollyon it's not put to flight by a courteous request I thought preach brother oh my goodness apollyon is by a courteous request he straddles across a crawl breath of the way the way forward and our progress has to be registered in Blood and Tears this we must remember everybody say must this we must remember or we shall add to all the other burdens of life as if we don't already have a bunch we shall add to all the other burdens of Life the gall of misinterpretation we are not born again into soft and protected nurseries but in the open country where we suck strength from the very Terror of the Tempest we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God that brother has summed up the great burden of my life and the burden that I have in this thought I thought to myself when I read that I thought what great servant of God now you just come with me I'm winding down all right I'm probably finished screaming what great servant ask yourself with me what great servant of God was ever able to do exploits and the power of the Holy Ghost who did not first reach that event through the rigors required for a spiritual life and operational power I'm tired of reading about power I want operational power I will operational status Hallelujah the people of the last day who know their God will do great exploits I'm not interested in just hearing about power I want operational status Hallelujah not one of them you could name in the Bible achieve that did Jesus no one suffered like him did any of the Apostles Daddy You Know listen let's talk about the big boys Peter James John Saint Paul do you think they achieved operational power do you think they achieved overcoming because they went to a picnic or because they Blended in with the world Hallelujah they were hated and killed because they wouldn't have anything to do with the world [Music] what about the Lesser vessels what about people like Stephen what about people like Philip hey you don't read a whole lot about them but they were Mighty Men of Valor what about the house of Cornelius just a gallant man assembling of people in his house and while Peter yet speak these words the Holy Ghost fell what about the corneliuses what about Bethel Tabernacle Hallelujah we'll never achieve operational power if we're friends with the world friends family Bethel family unless you are willing to follow give me second Corinthians 10 verse 5. second Corinthians 10 5. amen you've got to realize brother Jason will jump you got to be ready there you go second Corinthians 10 unless you're willing to do that you can forget operational status unless you're willing to cast down imaginations and there has never been a day where there were more vain imaginations to cast down and every every on every imaginable and unimaginable way that the devil tries to get at you and infect your mind he'll come right in and try to entice you sitting in church he'll try to entice you playing a tape he'll try to entice you reading your Bible he's not afraid of that he he doesn't care if you go to church he doesn't care how religious you are brother man said he doesn't even care how right you are in your Doctrine because he knows a great military secret he knows that if you miss the new birth you won't come up anyway and he'll still win unless you're willing to follow second Corinthians 10 5 casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bring into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ let me tell you something friends you need to have a sure and steadfast Revelation given to you by Jesus Christ that this message is the rapture message and there's no there's no wiggle room in that there's no questioning that if you want to have rapturing faith you're going to have to have a rapturing word and if you want a rapturing word you're going to have to talk about a prophet I'm sorry that that offends the world but he only gives that kind of Revelation To His prophets [Applause] it can't be somebody who says they are it's got to be Vindicated [Applause] Colossians 3 17 Josh you've got to be willing to do this friends if you're not willing to do what Paul is saying here you're never going to know operational status Colossians 3 17. amen amen told you to be ready amen Colossians 3 17. and whatsoever you do in word or deed it's amazing how many deeds and words how many Deeds we do that you really can't say in the name of Jesus and how many words Escape your mouth to each other to your spouse to your children to your neighbor to your boss to your teacher if you can't say it in the name of Jesus Christ don't say it if you can't do it in word or deed if you can't do that and pronounce the name of Jesus upon it Paul is saying don't do that how would this even be possible without restoration in an age of total apostasy friends an age of mankind walking in the blindness prophesied in Isaiah 60. locked down under 2 000 years of failed religious traditions same pattern Paul warned about in the early church wolves coming in after his departure devouring the flock we've sure seen that in the six decades in a prophet since a prophet went home we've seen well same pattern wolves coming in trying to divide and separate don't have anything to do with it stay in love with Christ stay in love with his word hallelujah great movements in the ages of the church began we know that by history by Gallant Warriors of the faith only to see them devolve into shameful organizations build on Creeds and ideas of Fallen Angels after the departure of the original founder that is historically incontrovertible I challenge you to point to me a church that's that that began that didn't begin under Great Men of God down Through the Ages all the way up from the Reformation of Luther through Wesley through the Azusa revivalist through that and what they call the Pentecostal movement all the way up through everything and they started with Gallant men who stood for the word of God and didn't compromise on nothing and today the Bible describes them correctly they're full of vomit their tables are filled with vomit and their people know no more about God than than brother Brandon would say in his home spun way than a rabbit would know about snowshoes God is laying the burden on you and me to shine The Illuminating Light of the restored pure word and original faith of our fathers my fathers were the apostles the whole church is built on the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ not as not only the Cornerstone he's the headstone Hallelujah and he's building an overcoming Church how many want to be part of an overcoming Church amen let's stand to our feet friends that's as far as I can get today amen whole another burden I couldn't even scratch amen come brother Matt bring your team and amen let's let's bow our heads over the building I wonder if just before we sing and let you go out the door I promise you that sinful world to be waiting on you you don't got to worry it ain't going nowhere let's linger a few minutes here in the presence of God bow bow your heads with me all over the building and just Place something as you choose son father I thank you first of all that I was able to get to this concluding point today right at the point of my notes where I drew a line and said from here on it'll be part three and you hit it right on the head I thank you for that I thank you Lord God for your word we stand by what we've said today we believe we can prove it by the Bible I can prove it in history I can prove it Lord and but father I I rather suppose that everybody under the sound of my voice today that was live in this building or out across the internet in our Outreach our our our listing on archive I don't think any reasonable person could deny the points that were made today it's just too clear it's too incontrovertible it's too unchallengeable in the scriptures Lord we love you for this great word that you've given us this day help us Lord God oh let me lift up both my hands let me be like Christ let me be like that word I desire that Lord more than anything I see myself so far from it yet striving daily trying to come to that image oh I'm relying on you Lord I'm relying on you I'm looking to that Shalom I'm looking to that morning star oh help us today Lord God I pray you give a special grace to the hearers of the word today there's no doubt I'm completely positive some heard things they'd never heard it like that before Lord may they may they just take it in prayer and go back and talk it over with you Lord I'm sure you'll confirm your word you always do I ask Lord God for Humble Hearts today young and old married and single from near and far Lord may we I think the word had our number today and I think we need to own it I challenge these young people to own it I challenge them to shine like the Morning Star I challenge them to be a light in this last closing these young people fill them full of the Holy Spirit may they take a stand a brave stand on your word may they refuse to compromise and take the way with the Lord's despised few May the parents Lord look inwardly may we repurpose and double down on our efforts to have our home token applied have our lives under the guidance of the Holy Spirit our words our Deeds
