[0:01] and write it on our hearts. Lord, I pray
[0:03] that you'd help bring bring it forth
[0:04] clearly and that it would be uh not just
[0:09] uh teaching to our minds, but Lord,
[0:11] revelation to our hearts that it would
[0:14] it would be quickened to us. Lord, we we
[0:16] look to you. We commit ourselves to you.
[0:18] We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. God
[0:20] bless
[0:24] you. So, this is part four. Obviously,
[0:27] you've missed three parts if you're a
[0:29] visitor, but uh and I'm I just there's
[0:32] no way to go go back and summarize. I'd
[0:35] spend 25 minutes summarizing everything
[0:37] up to this point. So, I'm just going to
[0:39] hit it. And if you're confused, God
[0:41] bless you.
[0:44] So, what is marriage?
[0:55] All right. It's a covenant relationship
[0:58] designed by God himself. God created it.
[1:02] He created the people that were a part
[1:03] of it, right? And he gave them their
[1:07] purposes and functions. So they're two
[1:09] separate people with distinct purposes,
[1:12] distinct functions, but becoming one
[1:16] unit. The the the two separate, the man
[1:19] and the woman, they complete each other.
[1:21] The man does things that the woman can't
[1:23] do and the woman does things that the
[1:25] man can't do. God has designed it that
[1:27] way. He's purposed it that way. He
[1:29] doesn't want us to change that at all.
[1:33] He wants us to stay in the channel uh
[1:36] that he's ordained for us. And again, it
[1:39] marriage is a covenant between three
[1:42] people. A man and a woman and God. Amen.
[1:48] And and this is God's purpose. This is
[1:50] God's function. And this this
[1:54] relationship permeates all of creation.
[1:57] It doesn't matter if you're a pagan.
[2:00] It's it's there and you'll answer for
[2:02] it. Regardless of if you have the Bible
[2:05] or not, you will answer for what God has
[2:08] placed within creation. Even pagan
[2:12] countries and cultures and places that
[2:14] are, you know, they're still in the
[2:16] stone
[2:17] age, they themselves understand that a
[2:21] woman has a certain function and a man
[2:24] has a certain function. It's not until
[2:26] us educated idiots of the west have
[2:31] attacked and perverted the very uh uh
[2:35] functions of nature that God has created
[2:38] that we go contrary to that nature. But
[2:41] it's very obvious. It's very plain and
[2:44] it's and and and we'll just leave it at
[2:46] that. God being the creator of marriage,
[2:50] God being the center of that covenant of
[2:53] marriage and his purpose for marriage.
[2:57] Uh first Corinthians chapter 7 1. Now I
[3:02] just want to say as as we go into it, if
[3:04] you've studied 1 Corinthians 7, Paul
[3:06] says some very interesting and strange
[3:09] things regarding marriage. And when I
[3:11] say that, just go read it. You'll find
[3:13] you'll understand that. But in verse 26
[3:16] he gives the he gives the explanation of
[3:18] why he's saying what he's saying about
[3:21] singleness and not getting married etc.
[3:24] And it's he says because of the present
[3:28] distress. So the situation that they
[3:30] were facing then in Corinth the
[3:32] Christians were facing in Corinth Paul
[3:34] was encouraging not to get married. Then
[3:37] you turn around in 1 Timothy chapter 5,
[3:39] he writes to Timothy and he says teach
[3:42] the younger women to get married. So
[3:45] understand so that what there's a
[3:46] there's a normal function of life and in
[3:50] the world and then there there is this
[3:52] place where there's a present distress
[3:53] that Paul is advising them just stay as
[3:56] you
[3:56] are because of the present distress.
[4:02] So Paul writes 1 Corinthians 7:1. Now
[4:05] concerning the things whereof you wrote
[4:07] unto me, "It is good for a man not to
[4:10] touch a
[4:11] woman. Nevertheless, to avoid
[4:13] fornication, let every man have his own
[4:16] wife, and let every woman have her own
[4:19] husband." And so just to speak plainly,
[4:23] you understand that there is a a
[4:26] covenant oneness that takes place
[4:28] between a husband and wife. At the
[4:30] center of that marriage, Paul is saying,
[4:32] "You do this in order to avoid
[4:34] fornication." However, we also
[4:36] understand at from the very beginning,
[4:39] God created them before the fall. He
[4:41] said, "For them, man and woman,
[4:44] to multiply and fill up the earth." So
[4:48] God's purpose for multiplication stands
[4:50] before the fall. And yet we understand
[4:53] because of the fall, Paul says, "Don't
[4:55] stay single.
[4:57] get married in order to avoid because
[5:00] this is a natural function that every
[5:03] human being has. God has placed it
[5:05] within us so that the human race will
[5:07] continue on that we have this desire and
[5:10] there is a proper place for the desire
[5:13] to be expressed. So what is a covenant
[5:16] marriage? What is the what is
[5:18] functioning as the covenant marriage is
[5:20] at the center of it is a sexual
[5:23] relationship.
[5:24] At the center of a family is a sexual
[5:28] relationship. That's that's part of it.
[5:30] That's part of the function. And if if
[5:33] we try to be so spiritual above above
[5:36] and beyond that, we kind of are missing
[5:38] even
[5:39] what now again in our in our uh
[5:43] post-puritan viewpoint of things to talk
[5:45] plainly like that makes everybody's
[5:48] cheeks turn a little red, including my
[5:51] own. But it's a fact. It's biblical
[5:53] truth. And we don't want to avoid what
[5:55] the word says. We want to face it
[5:57] directly. Paul says to avoid
[5:59] fornication, get married.
[6:02] Why? Because you're going to be
[6:04] tempted. A woman is going to be tempted
[6:07] to receive think she's going to receive
[6:09] love through allowing that act. A man is
[6:13] going to seek after love through that
[6:16] through that act. And so this is just
[6:19] the natural function of of mankind. And
[6:22] God wants us to be able to express it.
[6:25] But the place it is supposed to be
[6:26] expressed is in the center of a covenant
[6:30] relationship between God and a man and a
[6:34] woman. That's the place for it to be
[6:36] expressed. Anything outside of that is
[6:39] perversion. Anything outside of that is
[6:42] sinful and wicked.
[6:50] 1 Corinthians 11:7. For a man indeed
[6:53] ought not to cover his head, for as much
[6:55] as he is the image and glory of God, but
[6:59] the woman is the glory of the man. For
[7:03] the man is not of the woman, but the
[7:05] woman of the man. Neither was the man
[7:07] created for the woman, but the woman for
[7:09] the man. Order, the order of creation.
[7:11] Obviously, Adam was first
[7:13] formed. Then from Adam was taken out a
[7:17] rib and was created Eve. She was made
[7:21] for him for what purpose? To be his
[7:24] helper in the vision that go see God
[7:28] gave Adam a
[7:30] pre-existing vision for his life and
[7:33] direction for his life. But then Adam
[7:36] couldn't fulfill the function on his
[7:38] own. Right? So God took from Adam and
[7:42] made his
[7:44] helper. What is it? What is that helper?
[7:46] That helper completes what he couldn't
[7:48] do. He couldn't multiply himself, right?
[7:51] It took Eve, the mother of all living to
[7:55] be able to
[7:57] multiply. All right. Secondarily is God
[8:01] has a greater purpose which is the
[8:03] expression of
[8:05] himself. I shouldn't say secondarily,
[8:07] primarily,
[8:11] God has a purpose to express himself.
[8:14] And in order to do that, he couldn't
[8:16] make just a man, right? It's not good
[8:20] for a man to be
[8:21] alone, right? The the only thing in all
[8:24] of creation that wasn't good was the man
[8:27] be being alone. Everything else was very
[8:29] good, but the man being alone was not
[8:32] good. And so what did he do? He made for
[8:35] Adam from him a help meat. And what was
[8:38] this to do? The man was the glory of God
[8:41] and the woman the glory of man. So the
[8:44] woman reflects the man, the man reflects
[8:48] God. All of it, both man and woman
[8:50] together completes the image of God.
[8:53] It's the same thing in type. Christ and
[8:55] the bride. Christ is the direct
[8:58] reflection of God himself. When you see
[9:00] Christ, you're seeing God,
[9:02] right? But the picture is not complete
[9:04] with just Christ. Sounds like a strange
[9:07] thing to say, but that's the truth.
[9:09] Otherwise, why would he ma take out from
[9:12] Christ from the elements of Christ to
[9:15] make for Christ a bride? Because that in
[9:18] that the fullness of God is
[9:21] expressed into Christ to the bride.
[9:26] Amen. And so the the the
[9:31] the primary role is expression, but the
[9:36] secondary role becomes what? the
[9:38] multiplication of life, right? And so
[9:42] God's purpose in creating a man and
[9:44] woman is at the center of that, the
[9:47] multiplication of life. And as I said at
[9:51] the beginning, different different you
[9:53] can't take a man and try to make him
[9:56] fulfill the role of a woman, right?
[9:59] Because when you do that, the Bible says
[10:01] that's effeminite, right? And the
[10:05] epheminite can't go to heaven. That's
[10:08] what scripture says. The effeminate will
[10:10] not inherit the kingdom of
[10:13] God. So God wants the man to express a
[10:17] masculine life and he wants the woman to
[10:20] express a feminine life. No matter how
[10:22] much these insane uh alphabet people
[10:26] want to say that a man can have a baby,
[10:29] she could never have a baby. He can
[10:31] never have a baby. It's impossible.
[10:35] I just love it when people walk in right
[10:37] when I say stuff like that. It's just
[10:39] awesome. Come to come to church earlier,
[10:41] y'all. I sound like a a mad
[10:46] man. I guess they already know that.
[10:51] So, but the the the the reality is a man
[10:55] can't become a woman, a woman can't
[10:57] become a man. There's separate
[10:59] expression. There's separate
[11:00] manifestations. God wants it to stay
[11:03] that way. God loves it that way. God
[11:05] delights it that way. And the two
[11:07] complete each
[11:10] other. All right. So now I want to show
[11:14] you
[11:15] that daughters actually in the two
[11:18] different functions daughters actually
[11:20] don't marry. Did you know
[11:25] that? Psalms 78, I'll explain that in a
[11:29] minute.
[11:30] 7863. The fire consumed their young men
[11:34] and their maidens were not given to
[11:37] marriage. All right. So this this is we
[11:40] see this terminology given to
[11:43] marriage. Matthew 22:30 for in the
[11:46] resurrection neither they neither marry
[11:49] nor are they given nor are given in
[11:51] marriage but are as the angels of God in
[11:53] heaven.
[11:55] Matthew 24:38. For as in the days that
[11:58] were before the flood, they were eating
[11:59] and drinking, marrying and giving in
[12:03] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[12:06] in the ark. Strange. Why we keep seeing
[12:08] this? Marrying and giving in marriage.
[12:12] Luke 17:27 that did eat, they drank,
[12:15] they married wives, they were given in
[12:17] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[12:19] into the ark, and the flood came and
[12:22] destroyed them
[12:25] all. 1 Corinthians 7:38. So then, he
[12:28] that giveth her in marriage doeth well,
[12:32] but he that giveth her not in marriage
[12:35] doeth better. As we talked about before,
[12:37] verse 26 in 1 Corinthians 7 explains
[12:39] this to us. He's saying this because of
[12:42] the present
[12:43] distress. All right? But my point in
[12:46] showing this verse isn't that isn't that
[12:48] it's once again to say, "He that giveth
[12:50] her in
[12:51] marriage doeth well."
[12:55] So we see that daughters don't marry
[13:00] right sons
[13:03] marry daughters are given in
[13:07] marriage right and so this is an
[13:10] important point to make and we see this
[13:12] actually all through the bible that
[13:15] daughters are given in marriage right so
[13:18] the so sons are the ones that have to
[13:23] take the risk
[13:24] step
[13:26] out make make the statement right and
[13:30] daughters have to be given. So someone
[13:34] is giving the daughter away. Of course,
[13:37] we understand if you think about a
[13:39] marriage uh ceremony, it speaks about
[13:42] this, but that's about all the further
[13:45] thought we give very often that it's
[13:48] just some formality that the preacher
[13:49] says that's based on some bygone
[13:54] era. But I want to suggest to you that
[13:57] it actually isn't. Many things that we
[13:59] do today, we've abandoned simple
[14:02] biblical truth to the point that we
[14:04] don't even know what someone's talking
[14:06] about when they talk about the truth.
[14:08] Even in the message, we've done the same
[14:10] thing. We've departed from simple
[14:13] biblical instruction and biblical
[14:17] knowledge to the point
[14:20] where, you know, I've spoke about this
[14:22] before. When I first started speaking
[14:25] plainly about the roles of men and women
[14:28] and husbands and wives, every church I
[14:30] went to to preach about it, it was like
[14:32] there was a spirit trying to knock my
[14:34] head off. And you could see people are
[14:36] just visibly uncomfortable because
[14:39] feminism has
[14:41] so penetrated into our minds and
[14:44] perverted us. And even the modern system
[14:47] of casual dating, though that hasn't
[14:49] fully
[14:51] uh uh come into the message, we have a
[14:54] slippery slope that we're going on.
[14:57] And again, we we can we can talk about
[15:00] why that is happening or or where that's
[15:03] coming from, but it's the simple truth
[15:05] that we need to be people need to be
[15:07] taught. It's not enough to just say,
[15:10] "Hey, you be led by the Holy Spirit."
[15:13] That's fantastic. The Holy Spirit sets
[15:15] teachers in the church. Amen. To teach
[15:18] the church to help to give them
[15:19] instruction. And you know, older people,
[15:23] you've come to the message. You received
[15:25] the truth. But there's younger people
[15:26] that need to be instructed. They need to
[15:28] be introduced to the message. We can't
[15:29] just assume the message upon our
[15:32] children. We have to we have to teach
[15:34] them. We have to instruct them. That's
[15:36] the that's the job of fathers. You say,
[15:38] "My pastor has to do it." You are the
[15:41] dad. You're the husband. It's your
[15:43] responsibility to do that. That's that
[15:46] should be something we are teaching our
[15:48] sons from the very beginning because
[15:50] you're doing it yourself. So your son
[15:52] knows one day I will lead a family. One
[15:54] day I will teach a family. One day I
[15:57] will instruct a family to understand the
[15:59] message because
[16:02] ultimately we can't lay it off onto the
[16:05] pastor or the ministry at the church.
[16:08] Ultimately, the Bible tells fathers to
[16:11] teach their children, to instruct their
[16:14] children. And so, if if that fails to
[16:17] happen, we c as as men, we can't point
[16:20] the finger at someone else and ask them
[16:23] to do it. We must do it. We must
[16:25] instruct. And we must instruct what we
[16:28] want in within our families. And that's
[16:30] why I say when when I'm when I'm going
[16:32] into this, I'm about to go into Numbers
[16:35] chapter 30. And I want I want I want you
[16:38] to look at this not as maybe it's
[16:41] something new in in in your mind. If
[16:44] you've been through all the Sunday
[16:45] schools before or you listen to my
[16:47] podcast, it wouldn't be new at all. But
[16:50] it might be new in your mind. But the
[16:52] reality is from the time our k our
[16:54] daughters are little, they should
[16:57] understand that they are to be given in
[17:00] marriage. And that doesn't mean just at
[17:02] the altar when the pastor asked you.
[17:05] That's just a formal expression of what
[17:08] should have been happening all along.
[17:10] It's not for our daughters to make up
[17:13] their own minds on their own without the
[17:16] authority and the instruction of their
[17:19] father regarding their love lives and
[17:21] their future. Amen.
[17:24] Numbers chapter 30 verse one. And Moses
[17:27] spake unto the heads of the tribes
[17:29] concerning the children of Israel,
[17:30] saying, this is the thing which the Lord
[17:33] hath commanded. Now again, this is this
[17:37] is what our modern world and modern
[17:39] society will say. This is just for
[17:42] Israel. This isn't for Christians. This
[17:44] is Old Testament. We're in the New
[17:46] Testament now. There's no greater sign
[17:50] of spiritual idiocy than that
[17:55] statement. that if someone says that to
[17:58] you, you can really bet in immediately
[18:02] that they are not believers in God's
[18:06] word. You can make that assumption very
[18:09] well. So when I say this, I'm saying I'm
[18:12] saying this just to beat the devil to
[18:14] the punch, which is that this is a
[18:17] principle of headship. When we find Paul
[18:21] saying the husband is the head of the
[18:23] wife in America, in American churches,
[18:27] in Western churches, headship means
[18:30] little more than just just a word that
[18:33] exists, but with no authority behind it.
[18:36] So this this what I'm about to read to
[18:39] me as I see this, this is the expression
[18:41] of what headship actually is. This is
[18:45] the thing which the Lord commanded. If a
[18:47] man bow unto the Lord or an oath to his
[18:49] soul with a bond, he shall not break his
[18:52] word, he shall do according all that
[18:55] proceeded out of his mouth.
[18:58] If a woman also bow a vow unto the Lord
[19:01] and bind herself by a bond being in her
[19:03] father's house in her youth and her
[19:06] father hear her vow and her bond
[19:08] wherewith she have bound her soul and
[19:11] her father shall hold his peace at her
[19:14] then all her vows shall stand and every
[19:16] bond where she bound her soul shall
[19:18] stand. So the scriptur is giving the f
[19:21] the father the final authority. If if
[19:23] the daughter makes a promise again this
[19:27] is about a vow unto the Lord. So if a
[19:31] father can break a daughter's vow to the
[19:35] Lord, how much more can he break break
[19:38] her vow natural
[19:40] vow, right? And so if even if he says
[19:45] nothing, that's his that's the decision,
[19:47] right? He's even if he voids himself of
[19:51] his responsibility of
[19:53] deciding, he's decided anyways, right?
[19:58] Numbers 30:5 But if her father disallow
[20:01] her in the day that he not any of her
[20:04] vows or of her bonds where she had bound
[20:06] her soul shall stand and the Lord shall
[20:08] forgive her because her father
[20:11] disallowed
[20:12] her. And if she had an allen husband
[20:15] when she bowed or uttered out of her
[20:16] lips wherewith she bound her soul and
[20:19] her husband heard it and held his peace
[20:21] at her in the day that she that he heard
[20:24] it, then her vow shall stand and her
[20:26] bonds she bound, her soul shall stand.
[20:28] But if her husband disallowed her on the
[20:30] day that he heard it, then he shall make
[20:33] make her vow which he bowed, and that
[20:34] which she uttered with her lips,
[20:35] wherewith she bound her soul of none
[20:37] effect, and the Lord shall forgive
[20:40] her. But every vow of a widow and of her
[20:43] that is divorced, wherewith they have
[20:45] bound their souls shall stand against
[20:47] her.
[20:49] Right? So
[20:52] headship speaks of being a decision
[20:54] maker.
[20:57] Even if you even if you hold your peace,
[21:01] even if you don't lead, even if you
[21:04] refuse to do it, God will actually
[21:08] ultimately hold you responsible and
[21:10] accountable for what goes on in your in
[21:13] your family. And so the point of all of
[21:17] this is fathers are supposed to be
[21:21] involved with all their children.
[21:24] with their wife. They're supposed to
[21:26] understand not none of this should be a
[21:28] shock or surprise because he's involved.
[21:31] He's inspecting his family. He's
[21:34] communicating with his family. He
[21:36] understands it's his responsibility to
[21:39] do good unto
[21:40] them. So again, as we
[21:43] read, a husband and a father can
[21:46] invalidate any decision his wife or
[21:49] daughter makes. And the other part of it
[21:52] is in America, we have some strange
[21:55] intermediate state. My daughter turns 18
[21:58] now. She's suddenly responsible for
[22:00] herself. She's outside of my headship.
[22:01] She's an adult. She can do what she
[22:03] wants to. Well, that's based on American
[22:07] law. But as Christians, we don't live by
[22:11] American law. We live by the word of
[22:13] God.
[22:15] And and so in the in the biblical way of
[22:19] doing things, there's no intermediate
[22:21] state between a father and a
[22:23] husband. It's under the headship of your
[22:27] father. And then when when the time
[22:30] comes and you've you are given in
[22:33] marriage through the process of
[22:35] courtship, engagement, marriage, once
[22:39] once your father gives you and that you
[22:41] stand before God's people and before God
[22:44] and you're joined together in a
[22:46] covenant, headship passes from the
[22:49] father to the husband. Right? There's a
[22:53] passing There's a passing of the of the
[22:55] torch. there's a passing of of that
[22:59] headship of the daughter. So a woman is
[23:02] to be under headship as we saw in the
[23:04] scripture. The only intermediate state
[23:06] is when she is a widow, right? If she's
[23:11] a widow, she makes her own
[23:13] decisions before the Lord and she's held
[23:15] accountable to them. But outside of
[23:16] that, a daughter or a woman is either
[23:19] under the headship of her father and
[23:22] then passed to being under the headship
[23:25] of her husband. And so when we talk
[23:28] about being given in marriage, that's
[23:29] the process. We haven't gone into detail
[23:32] in the process. We'll do that the next
[23:34] time. And we're just at the time to
[23:37] quit. So let's stand. We'll take a five
[23:41] minute break and then service will
[23:43] start. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we
[23:45] thank you so much for your word. We
[23:47] pray, Lord, that you'd write it on our
[23:49] hearts. As we look at this, Lord, may we
[23:53] each as individual believers, not just
[23:56] hear a word and and pass from one ear
[23:59] out the other, but may we take it if
[24:00] it's something new that we've heard. May
[24:03] we take the scriptures, may we study
[24:04] them, may we study the message, Lord,
[24:07] and and come to the revelation in our
[24:10] own hearts. And I pray Lord the bless of
[24:13] us the service that you be glorified in
[24:16] our midst Lord. We ask it in Jesus name.
[24:18] Amen. Amen. God bless you.
