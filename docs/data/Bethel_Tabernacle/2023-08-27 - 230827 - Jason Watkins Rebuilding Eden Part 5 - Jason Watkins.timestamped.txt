[36:52] brother right that's what I thought okay
[36:54] that's Rhett happy to have him here amen
[36:56] praise the Lord
[36:58] all right Genesis chapter 4
[37:00] and um we're going to just pick up
[37:03] couple of verses beginning
[37:07] let's well
[37:09] let's just read from verse one I think
[37:12] that'll be best
[37:15] and Adam knew
[37:17] Eve his wife
[37:19] and she conceived and bear Cain and said
[37:22] I've gotten a man from the Lord
[37:25] and she again bear his brother Abel
[37:28] and Abel was a keeper of sheep
[37:32] if you're ever discussing
[37:36] the original sin with someone
[37:39] you can point to that even Scholars and
[37:43] I have their notes personally
[37:46] well-respected Scholars point to this
[37:49] second verse and she again bear his
[37:53] brother and even they notice that it
[37:55] doesn't say she conceived again only
[37:59] that she bear again which brings the in
[38:02] all probability they were twins
[38:04] all right
[38:06] all right so just just a little FYI for
[38:09] you there
[38:11] verse 3 and in process of time
[38:15] came to pass that Cain brought of the
[38:17] fruit of the ground
[38:19] an offering unto the Lord and Abel
[38:23] he also brought of the firstlings of his
[38:26] flock and of the fat thereof
[38:29] and the Lord had respect unto Abel and
[38:33] to his offering
[38:35] but unto Cain and to his offering he had
[38:38] not respect
[38:40] and Cain was very Roth and his
[38:43] countenance fell
[38:45] and the Lord said unto King
[38:48] why art thou Wrath
[38:51] means angry
[38:52] why is thy countenance Fallen he had an
[38:55] attitude
[39:02] if thou doest well
[39:04] shalt thou not be accepted and if thou
[39:07] do us not well sin lieth at the door
[39:11] you're just not going to impugn God with
[39:14] unfairness
[39:17] because this is I want you to catch this
[39:21] is the son of his arch enemy
[39:25] yes God is so loving
[39:28] so kind
[39:30] so benevolent as brother Branham said
[39:33] that Fountain from eternity that flowed
[39:36] out of their the pureness of love the
[39:40] pureness of righteousness in its purest
[39:43] uncut form
[39:45] and that
[39:46] God so loved the world
[39:50] and does not even take pleasure in even
[39:52] the death of The Sinner
[39:54] and he wishes for all men to come
[39:57] that's the Bible
[39:59] as far as God's will is concerned he
[40:02] wants all men to be saved
[40:04] and he offers everyone a legitimate
[40:06] opportunity it he's so strong in that
[40:10] that he even tries to save the life of
[40:13] his arch enemy
[40:17] the enemy of all enemies who had
[40:19] rebelled and tried to stab him in the
[40:21] back take over his kingdom he's even
[40:23] trying to save his son
[40:27] so you're not going to impugn God with
[40:28] unfairness
[40:30] verse
[40:32] 7 again
[40:34] if thou doest well shalt thou not be
[40:37] accepted
[40:39] and if thou doest not well sin lieth at
[40:42] the door
[40:43] and unto thee shall be his desire and
[40:46] thou shalt rule over him in other words
[40:49] you can conquer him
[40:52] it'll be whatever you decide
[40:54] he's subject to you that's what he's
[40:57] saying see
[40:58] and unto thee shall be his desire he's
[41:02] subject to you and you can whoop him
[41:06] it's up to you
[41:09] all right all right
[41:10] let's pray
[41:13] father we thank you
[41:15] for your word this morning
[41:18] I thank you for your ready anointing
[41:20] that I already feel and you're already
[41:22] the teacher here this morning Lord we
[41:24] commit ourselves into your hands
[41:26] Lord
[41:28] per Lord you know father my heart is
[41:32] before you this morning in perfect
[41:35] discipline Lord I'm here to preach your
[41:39] word father and not take any thought of
[41:42] my own but be strictly an oracle of your
[41:45] anointing I commit it to you in Jesus
[41:48] name amen God bless you friends you can
[41:51] be seated
[42:00] foreign
[42:06] so you should have my um PowerPoint
[42:10] Josh
[42:11] and if you'll just put that title slide
[42:14] up for me
[42:15] it'll be wonderful and I'll take it from
[42:17] there I hope if my device works
[42:22] amen
[42:24] so I want you to notice these
[42:27] things as we just start reading our text
[42:31] you know here's a here's a really good
[42:35] point
[42:37] for Bible study all right there's a
[42:39] there's a way to study the Bible there's
[42:42] a there's a anytime you read it there's
[42:44] a blessing and when you're studying it
[42:47] there's good ways there's better ways
[42:49] and there's the best ways and I I have
[42:53] many years of studying it since a boy
[42:56] and one of the things that I
[42:59] realized very early on and I I've never
[43:02] and and this actually is part of the
[43:05] things I've learned over the years I've
[43:06] learned it again and again and again and
[43:08] never forget it and that is when Jesus
[43:11] said a couple of things he said that you
[43:14] know heavens and earth would pass away
[43:16] but not even a single punctuation
[43:21] of his word would ever pass away not
[43:25] even the not one word not even one
[43:28] punctuation not even a letter
[43:31] see and he used intentional Aramaic
[43:33] words to describe down to the smallest
[43:36] infinitesimal almost uh Point everything
[43:40] God has ever said can never be changed
[43:43] it cannot be countermanded it cannot be
[43:46] altered even God can't take it back or
[43:49] alter it or change it
[43:51] see so now we realize as the prophet has
[43:55] taught us
[43:56] God can do things that are not in his
[44:00] word he can do things outside of his
[44:04] word
[44:05] but what he can't do is violate anything
[44:08] in his word
[44:10] you see the difference
[44:12] he can do things he's Sovereign he can
[44:15] do things that are outside of what you
[44:18] have between these two leather covers
[44:20] but whatever's between these two leather
[44:23] covers he can't break it he can't annul
[44:26] it he can't do away with it he has to
[44:29] fulfill it
[44:31] and that's why brother random would say
[44:32] it very simply he said you know if you
[44:35] if you get a problem in your life
[44:38] anybody here ever had problems
[44:43] [Music]
[44:44] um
[44:45] and he said look here's a good piece of
[44:47] advice find you a character in the Bible
[44:50] who had that problem or something
[44:53] similar
[44:54] and observe what they did to get God's
[44:58] help and to get out of it and if you
[45:00] just do what they did God will have to
[45:02] operate with you the same way he did
[45:04] with them because he can't respect
[45:06] persons and he can't break his word see
[45:10] so he's even saying that to Cain look if
[45:13] you'll just do his Abel Abel has a
[45:16] revelation you notice you notice that
[45:19] when you take the analogy and let me
[45:22] just go real slow this morning because
[45:24] I've got to not lose you in the shuffle
[45:28] you remember how in the Bible when Moses
[45:32] came into Egypt
[45:34] and Moses had a sign and Janice and
[45:38] jambres copied it
[45:42] right
[45:43] and then Moses did a different sign in
[45:46] Janice and jambres copied it now they
[45:49] couldn't uh Brother Brad brother met
[45:53] somebody that screen is blinking on and
[45:55] off that's going to drive me nuts just
[45:56] turn it off if you can't eliminate that
[45:58] it's in it's in the device because it's
[46:01] not doing it here
[46:02] so there's something wrong with it just
[46:04] a loose connection perhaps
[46:06] so so he if but now there's a couple of
[46:09] differences first of all brother Madam
[46:11] said notice Moses did it first
[46:14] then they copied it so you have the
[46:17] original and then you have a copycat and
[46:20] you can't have a copycat without an
[46:22] original there's no way there can be a
[46:25] counterfeit American three dollar bill
[46:29] you can have Monopoly money or toy money
[46:32] that says that but there's no no no
[46:35] counterfeit U.S three dollar bill
[46:37] because there's never been a real one so
[46:40] a counterfeit has to be off of The Reel
[46:44] so when people say you know religion is
[46:47] fake and Christians are all Hypocrites
[46:50] well there's a ton of Truth in that
[46:52] except that you've got to differentiate
[46:55] between real Christians and
[46:58] impersonators of Christianity
[47:00] because you can't have an impersonation
[47:03] without an authentic so the very fact
[47:06] that you have a fake means you have to
[47:09] have a real whether you can identify who
[47:12] it is what it is how it works there has
[47:14] it has to exist you follow me
[47:17] you could actually make that into a
[47:20] mathematical equation
[47:22] you can actually
[47:24] Express that mathematically that's how
[47:26] scientists in physics they express which
[47:29] is my favorite science subject they
[47:30] express things in mathematical equations
[47:32] you can make anything turn anything into
[47:34] an equation
[47:35] and that's provable
[47:37] see so so it it strikes down the very
[47:40] idea that you know there there's got to
[47:45] everything is just fake and people can
[47:47] have that atheists often have that you
[47:50] know you can you can find these men
[47:52] these Talking Heads who are atheists and
[47:54] want the whole world to know it and you
[47:58] know one time I recently I listened to
[48:00] uh one by Dr Dawkins and I thought why
[48:03] would I listen to this to this Infidel
[48:06] but I I thought to myself I'm not afraid
[48:09] of a good question
[48:11] and I'd like to hear what his point is
[48:13] and and what boy would I have like a
[48:16] hundred questions for him
[48:19] he was so sure
[48:22] that there was no God but he spent an
[48:25] hour and a half telling just how unsure
[48:27] how everything got he was how everything
[48:29] got started and you don't know how many
[48:31] times they would ask him a question
[48:32] about creation he'd say well we don't
[48:34] know
[48:36] how that happened but we know it wasn't
[48:38] God
[48:41] so you know it wasn't God but you don't
[48:44] know
[48:45] how it happened
[48:48] and you can't explain it and and you
[48:51] know all he had was little pieces of
[48:53] empirical evidence but yet you know you
[48:56] could line up a Christian biologist
[48:58] right beside him and Christian
[48:59] biologists would just shoot his argument
[49:01] down and I've heard him do it
[49:03] I'm just glad I realized the world is
[49:06] full of impersonations of the real I
[49:09] just say Lord give me the real and let
[49:11] me be the real
[49:15] and whatever that costs me whatever I
[49:18] have to surrender whatever I have to
[49:19] lose whatever I have to give up let that
[49:23] mind which was in Christ be in me
[49:27] I would very much like to live forever
[49:33] but very much like
[49:35] what heaven is going to be
[49:38] and so you find that Moses comes first
[49:42] and brother Rand points that out he he
[49:44] came on the field with a sign in the
[49:46] hand
[49:47] administered to him by an Angel and
[49:50] immediately every church had their their
[49:54] man with oil in his hand and blood in
[49:56] his hand and this that and the other and
[50:00] you know the the man that had blood in
[50:03] his hand
[50:04] you know I don't even want to go there
[50:06] brother Branham interpreted that but I I
[50:08] don't want to get your mind sidetracked
[50:10] it's it's not pretty
[50:12] but we find that
[50:14] it in this case
[50:17] you can see
[50:19] that Cain
[50:20] comes first
[50:24] ahead of Abel
[50:26] but yet we know that Abel had a
[50:29] revelation Paul said that by faith Abel
[50:32] offered unto God so we know that the
[50:35] Apostle Paul teaches us that he had a
[50:37] revelation given to him by God that's
[50:39] what real faith is it's Jesus taught
[50:42] that you can't even have that you can't
[50:43] approach god well except through Christ
[50:46] and you can't know Christ except the
[50:47] spirit reveals him to you
[50:49] so you're locked out in every direction
[50:51] it's just the mercy of God friends oh we
[50:55] should just Rejoice today to say Lord
[50:57] Give Me Your Mercy I can't force you to
[51:00] save me but I'd very much like to be
[51:02] saved
[51:04] Hallelujah
[51:07] but you notice that he's only repeating
[51:12] the exact same pattern
[51:14] that Eve in her great error had done and
[51:19] that is she ran ahead of God
[51:22] she ran ahead of the revelation
[51:25] you see Satan offered her something she
[51:28] was already entitled to and would have
[51:30] come to
[51:31] but she brother I'm said she couldn't
[51:33] wait you can see that in the scripture
[51:34] you can read The Narrative she couldn't
[51:36] wait and she ran ahead and now you see
[51:38] that the product of her running ahead
[51:43] the product of her not following
[51:47] the word of God the line and Order of
[51:51] the word of God it's one thing to you
[51:54] memorize this whole book but if you
[51:56] don't get it lined up in your life and
[51:58] if your line doesn't operate in the line
[52:00] in order of it God's a god of order
[52:03] and he cannot get behind chaos that's
[52:06] why he wouldn't leave the Earth in chaos
[52:08] he was never going to leave it in chaos
[52:10] he was going to bring the chaos into
[52:12] order that's what the word is trying to
[52:14] do to your life today it's trying to
[52:16] take the chaos of sin that you were born
[52:18] in without hope without God but God rich
[52:21] and mercy is sending you his word to
[52:24] bring your life back into order so that
[52:27] you look like this
[52:29] that's the gospel that's what the Holy
[52:33] Ghost is given for you can't do it to
[52:36] yourself you'll get it wrong for sure
[52:39] you'll get it wrong
[52:41] just like Cain got it wrong he used all
[52:43] the common sense and reasoning he could
[52:45] and he got it wrong and it goes to show
[52:48] you that listen this is not in my notes
[52:52] can I toss it in without getting a brick
[52:54] thrown at me
[52:56] he learned a lesson that when parents
[52:59] get out of the line in order of God's
[53:00] word their offspring tend to follow that
[53:05] that's a Genesis principle
[53:08] can't go you can't get further back than
[53:10] that for Humanity
[53:13] so just just just put that in the back
[53:15] of your mind and ponder that
[53:18] God God grant that he will show you the
[53:20] deeper meanings of it
[53:23] on our last installment
[53:26] part four today's part five our last
[53:29] installment
[53:30] found us considering
[53:33] the story in Genesis we were considering
[53:36] the Genesis story of Abel son of Adam
[53:40] and we find him here in our opening text
[53:43] on the other side of the Fall
[53:46] after his family had been removed from
[53:50] the Garden of Eden and we find Abel
[53:54] longing
[53:56] for Redemption this is where this is
[53:59] where he this is why he's entitled for
[54:03] God to give him a revelation because you
[54:05] know the Bible makes that assurance that
[54:08] if you seek you'll find and speaking of
[54:12] God if you knock he will answer and
[54:14] Jesus gave a parable and said goodness
[54:16] gracious just an Earthly father with all
[54:20] kinds of flaws loves his children that
[54:22] if they ask him you know for bread and
[54:25] for fish he won't give them a stone and
[54:27] a snake
[54:29] he'll actually feed his children because
[54:31] he loves him and that's just human level
[54:34] imagine God who is that perfect fountain
[54:39] and there's something inside of Abel
[54:41] that we see him longing for Redemption
[54:44] and he moves by Revelation to bring a
[54:48] sacrificial animal that would be
[54:51] acceptable unto the Lord not just a
[54:53] sacrifice it happened because this had
[54:55] to be for Redemption it couldn't just be
[54:58] uh you know the the the the
[55:01] representation of his labors that's what
[55:04] Cain tried to bring Cain tried to bring
[55:07] the the crop of his labor I sowed and I
[55:11] tended and I farmed it and I grew it and
[55:13] here it is Lord and that's that's fine
[55:16] for certain offerings in the Old
[55:17] Testament but as we said here in the
[55:20] previous service that was not for
[55:22] Redemption because of what happened in
[55:24] the original sin you couldn't undo that
[55:27] with just works it had to be blood
[55:30] because of the kind of sin it was
[55:34] and so he we find him bringing not the
[55:39] not his not the uh reaping of his works
[55:44] but he brought to
[55:46] to God an innocent lamb
[55:50] and offered the life of that lamb on an
[55:53] altar and offered on a rock and that
[55:54] rock was Christ of course same Rock in
[55:57] the wilderness with Moses
[55:59] same Rock able Abel died on that rock
[56:02] which was Christ that's where I want to
[56:04] die
[56:05] oh my that's where Moses died Hallelujah
[56:09] whoever dies on that rock will live
[56:11] again
[56:12] Hallelujah and when you live again
[56:14] you'll never die again
[56:18] so it had to be a proper offering
[56:22] designed to appease the Judgment of the
[56:25] Lord even if only temporarily to try if
[56:30] possible to set things back in order
[56:34] between himself and his maker and we of
[56:39] course see his half-twin brother trying
[56:42] to impersonate this action through
[56:45] reasoning
[56:47] unwilling
[56:48] to come God's provided way his story
[56:52] would not end well
[56:59] once the Tree of Life as we've taught
[57:03] you in previous lessons
[57:05] once the Tree of Life
[57:09] had become sealed
[57:13] tree of life was Christ
[57:15] God Ran them out of the garden and
[57:17] guarded the way guarded the revelation
[57:19] with a flaming sword
[57:22] see
[57:23] Jesus was still swinging that sword
[57:25] still blocking the way when he was on
[57:28] Earth
[57:29] when he said except you eat the Flesh of
[57:31] the son of man they're trying to know
[57:33] they're trying to figure out God through
[57:35] him and he's he's literally blocking
[57:37] them
[57:37] see
[57:38] and so so we find that he does the same
[57:42] thing today so once Humanity found
[57:46] itself
[57:47] living under this shroud of mystery once
[57:51] the Tree of Life once the Tree of Life
[57:55] was sealed
[57:57] then man a shroud as it were a curtain
[58:02] came down upon his mind to where brother
[58:05] Branham talks about how that Adam lost
[58:07] the very Consciousness that he had ever
[58:10] had that kind of power and the gardener
[58:12] ever had that kind of life there's a
[58:14] veil that he couldn't see through any
[58:16] longer and he lost the consciousness of
[58:18] it and now man would have to live under
[58:21] a shroud of mystery of of you say what's
[58:24] the what's the shroud of mystery brother
[58:26] Jason well the probably the greatest
[58:28] shroud it covers what is the real
[58:32] meaning of life
[58:34] it's the question that is plagued
[58:36] Humanity for Millennia what is the real
[58:39] meaning of life why am I here what's it
[58:42] all about
[58:44] people have sailed the seven seas trying
[58:46] to find that answer people have ended
[58:48] their life because they couldn't find
[58:49] that answer they couldn't find
[58:51] satisfaction in any in any Pursuit
[58:55] see
[58:58] Abel knew that some kind of paradise had
[59:01] been lost
[59:02] something that not even his parents
[59:05] could explain to him
[59:07] and and in our study in our last lesson
[59:12] we found also remember how we showed you
[59:16] that
[59:17] that since it was Adam who broke the
[59:20] world only the second Adam could repair
[59:22] it
[59:24] and we we found happily that that to be
[59:28] the case because we discovered that that
[59:30] neither Satan nor Eve could break it it
[59:34] was after Adam fell that nature
[59:36] everything under him fell see and Eve
[59:40] actually all the way up till Adam opened
[59:42] her eyes she thought she had done the
[59:44] right thing thought she had done a good
[59:46] thing people often think that before the
[59:48] New Birth I'm a good person
[59:51] I'm an honest person I pay my taxes I
[59:54] don't cheat on my relationship I'm I'm
[59:57] an honorable person I'm a good old boy
[1:00:00] I'm a fine person and yet the Bible says
[1:00:03] there's none good not one
[1:00:07] not even a single one
[1:00:09] the only good one is Christ
[1:00:12] when the when when the Rich Young Ruler
[1:00:15] came to Jesus good Master Jesus said
[1:00:17] just a second now let's see if you
[1:00:19] really believe that because there's none
[1:00:20] good but God
[1:00:22] so is that who you're saying I am
[1:00:26] come on with that revelation don't just
[1:00:29] walk up here and give me some courteous
[1:00:30] greeting
[1:00:32] uh you you need to you need to have an
[1:00:34] experience here
[1:00:35] see
[1:00:36] so you know we we Rejoice because we
[1:00:40] realize that if that's the case in
[1:00:42] Genesis then it's the same today that if
[1:00:46] Satan couldn't break it then he can't
[1:00:48] break it now and if Eve's failure
[1:00:51] couldn't collapse God's plan then then
[1:00:53] your failure can't collapse his plan now
[1:00:56] and whatever position he saw of me
[1:00:59] before the foundation of the world
[1:01:00] there's not enough Devils I can't make
[1:01:03] enough errors to to remove myself from
[1:01:07] the position that I had in Christ before
[1:01:09] the world existed before I ever got here
[1:01:12] and made those mistakes
[1:01:15] foreign
[1:01:18] it really isn't
[1:01:20] you know the craving of a born-again
[1:01:23] child of God for fortune and glory in
[1:01:25] this world it's just not
[1:01:27] the new birth takes the desire of sin
[1:01:29] the Bible says that that he that's born
[1:01:32] of God hath no more conscience of sin
[1:01:35] see it just simply means his desires
[1:01:38] have been changed he knows he Wars
[1:01:40] against the flesh that still makes
[1:01:42] mistakes
[1:01:43] thank God we have an Advocate Christ
[1:01:45] Jesus that I actually can't sin not the
[1:01:49] real me I'm talking about the other me
[1:01:51] not the one born of Ed and Gene Watkins
[1:01:53] he sins all the time he was born in sin
[1:01:55] but I found out there was another Jason
[1:01:58] Watkins down inside
[1:02:00] that had never and would never and could
[1:02:02] never disbelieve God's word because sin
[1:02:04] is unbelief
[1:02:06] not don't confuse sin with the
[1:02:08] attributes of sin smoking drinking
[1:02:10] cursing dressing immorally acting
[1:02:13] immorally that's not sin that's the
[1:02:15] attributes of sin that's the results you
[1:02:18] do those things because you've not been
[1:02:19] converted so they're they're intrinsic
[1:02:22] to you they're germane they're they're
[1:02:24] gnats that come natural
[1:02:26] because you've got to fall in nature
[1:02:27] you're not fighting the greatest battle
[1:02:29] ever fought your greatest battle is
[1:02:31] having to go to work and pay bills
[1:02:35] but when you become born again you enter
[1:02:37] a whole new warfare level now that now
[1:02:39] you've got Next Level Warfare going on
[1:02:42] because now you've got an Insight man at
[1:02:44] war with the outside man and the inside
[1:02:47] man is determined to win
[1:02:51] I am determined to win I am determined
[1:02:55] to make this flesh subject to the word
[1:02:58] of God and whatever I got to do whatever
[1:03:01] I have to surrender and give up I say
[1:03:03] Let It Be oh God so be it unto me
[1:03:07] Hallelujah
[1:03:09] I fight with a fury
[1:03:12] the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence
[1:03:14] and the violent take it by force
[1:03:17] when it comes to my new birth I am a
[1:03:19] violent man I am against the devil I
[1:03:22] hate him I condemn his works I condemn
[1:03:25] him on my behalf on your behalf he's a
[1:03:27] liar
[1:03:29] you don't have to be in prison to him
[1:03:32] thank God
[1:03:37] so it's it's not a craving
[1:03:40] there's no more craving for
[1:03:42] the fortune and glory of the world if it
[1:03:45] if it means if the price I have to pay
[1:03:48] for that is spirituality
[1:03:50] or being pleasing to God
[1:03:53] now if you're just a church member
[1:03:55] you'll never
[1:03:57] you'll never succeed at that
[1:04:01] you'll you'll just
[1:04:02] you know you can be justified you can be
[1:04:06] Sanctified brother Brown says you know
[1:04:08] what will sanctification do he says well
[1:04:10] it'll make you stop blind it'll make you
[1:04:13] join a church and it'll make you a good
[1:04:16] neighbor
[1:04:17] and there's there's virtue in that
[1:04:19] there's nothing to say evil against that
[1:04:21] but it's not the new birth
[1:04:23] the new birth is when you've had a
[1:04:25] nature change
[1:04:26] see the new birth is when a gene of God
[1:04:29] in you that was in you before in you
[1:04:31] from the day you were born that Gene
[1:04:33] comes to life
[1:04:36] and so when you're born again you're
[1:04:38] there really isn't a craving any longer
[1:04:41] that craving for fortune and Glory at
[1:04:44] the cost of my spirituality is done
[1:04:48] done with that been done with that don't
[1:04:51] know why I chased it so long
[1:04:53] can't imagine why I chased it like I did
[1:04:56] oh my
[1:04:58] we seek a city today I do have goals
[1:05:03] I I I do have plans I haven't just
[1:05:06] become so Heavenly minded
[1:05:09] that I'm no earthly good
[1:05:12] I'm still trying to get ahead I'm still
[1:05:15] trying to secure my family nothing wrong
[1:05:17] in that I'm still trying to uh to to
[1:05:20] achieve whatever I can but but worldly
[1:05:24] success is no longer my goal I just look
[1:05:27] at it as whatever is a necessity but but
[1:05:30] I do have goals and I and I do want to
[1:05:33] graduate from this life I want a city
[1:05:36] whose Builder and maker is God where
[1:05:39] righteousness is supreme
[1:05:44] which that which is right
[1:05:48] is a daily occurrence
[1:05:52] so if this craving for the world is now
[1:05:55] gone
[1:05:56] you know you you could ask yourself my
[1:05:58] goodness how did I how did I get that
[1:06:00] brother Branham
[1:06:02] runs ahead and asks that question for
[1:06:04] you
[1:06:05] boy it's it's so great to have a prophet
[1:06:09] ask this question because now I can get
[1:06:10] an authoritative answer I'm not probing
[1:06:13] anymore I'm about to read you something
[1:06:15] you'll never have to probe or guess at
[1:06:16] it again
[1:06:17] brother Branham says in a thinking man's
[1:06:19] filter
[1:06:20] what made you desire it in the first
[1:06:23] place
[1:06:24] the city
[1:06:26] who's building makers got this land
[1:06:28] where righteousness this Purity this
[1:06:31] Holiness you couldn't have done that on
[1:06:33] your own you were born in sin
[1:06:36] and Paul says that anyone born in sin
[1:06:39] that their mind is enmity against God
[1:06:42] just like God put enmity between the
[1:06:44] Serpent's Seed and the and the and the
[1:06:46] woman's seed see so they can't cross and
[1:06:50] so the the your Fallen condition is
[1:06:52] enmity against God and can never agree
[1:06:54] with God and never accept God's plan
[1:06:57] you have to understand friends you can't
[1:06:59] just be good enough you're you're born
[1:07:00] in sin
[1:07:02] you're having you're born under a death
[1:07:04] sentence Jesus died at Calvary so that
[1:07:07] you through him can be released from
[1:07:09] that
[1:07:10] so so are well are there virtues to Good
[1:07:13] Works of course
[1:07:15] you do good you give God who cause men
[1:07:19] to give to you you you live this way you
[1:07:22] reap you sow good seed you'll reap good
[1:07:24] good crops there's all kinds of value
[1:07:26] and I that's why I've said even if there
[1:07:29] is no heaven and even if there is only
[1:07:31] this life I'd rather be a Christian
[1:07:34] because it's a way better life
[1:07:36] I don't I don't spend all my money on
[1:07:38] booze and drugs and fast living I get to
[1:07:41] keep it
[1:07:43] I don't wake up Monday morning hungover
[1:07:45] and almost get fired because I can't get
[1:07:47] out of bed I'm clear-headed my family's
[1:07:50] wholesome there's love and constant love
[1:07:54] between us I mean the Christian Life who
[1:07:57] wouldn't want to live that way my
[1:07:59] I don't have to worry about social
[1:08:01] diseases I don't have to worry about
[1:08:03] social anxieties I don't have to do any
[1:08:05] of that I can I can I can live what at
[1:08:09] least what God offered came just live
[1:08:11] like a Christian
[1:08:13] and you have a better life than being a
[1:08:15] sinner
[1:08:17] goodness gracious end up with every kind
[1:08:19] of disease and sickness and broke down
[1:08:21] and when you get disease and sickness
[1:08:23] which we all do including Christians at
[1:08:26] least a Christian has an advocate at
[1:08:28] least I have someone who I can go to and
[1:08:30] say would you heal me kind sir and he
[1:08:32] can say I certainly will here you go and
[1:08:34] I can walk out of a doctor's office and
[1:08:36] leave him scratching his head how are
[1:08:38] you well I just took an x-ray
[1:08:41] you were very sick and now you're not
[1:08:43] and it's gone I don't know where it's
[1:08:44] gone you can walk after they go I know
[1:08:46] exactly what happened to it
[1:08:49] so I'm the crazy one for being a
[1:08:52] Christian really
[1:08:58] brother Branham says what made you
[1:09:00] desire it in the first place
[1:09:04] here's why I love it that he's going to
[1:09:07] ask and answer the question
[1:09:09] what made you desire this is August 1965
[1:09:13] a thinking man's filter
[1:09:16] what made you desire it in the first
[1:09:18] place
[1:09:19] oh don't make me take off running
[1:09:22] because down in your soul there was a
[1:09:28] predestinated seed which was eternal
[1:09:32] life not that it had eternal life it was
[1:09:35] eternal life always laying in there
[1:09:39] always was in there Jesus said all that
[1:09:44] the father has given me will come to me
[1:09:48] there isn't any one of them going to be
[1:09:51] lost
[1:09:52] oh friends how hopelessly lost is any
[1:09:56] man or woman born into this Fallen World
[1:09:59] born into sin born under a death
[1:10:02] sentence cut off from God
[1:10:06] no no way to find him
[1:10:10] and no way to approach him if you could
[1:10:14] find him
[1:10:16] yet being a creature
[1:10:18] who's made in the image of God
[1:10:21] made in his very image it is in the DNA
[1:10:26] of every Mortal being who has ever lived
[1:10:30] to worship something
[1:10:34] you go back in the into Antiquity back
[1:10:37] into the cave paintings back as far back
[1:10:40] as they can track Humanity I don't agree
[1:10:42] with their numbers but they they have
[1:10:44] went back and found the original remains
[1:10:47] and at least to a degree and and brother
[1:10:52] Branham shows that they're always
[1:10:55] worshiping something
[1:10:57] you know the the Native Americans were
[1:10:59] worshiping the Sun the nature they
[1:11:01] didn't know exactly you know Hindus I
[1:11:05] went there to India on several trips and
[1:11:07] and we found a 4 000 year old stone
[1:11:10] carving uh brother Donnie and I were
[1:11:12] looking at it and it had the serpent
[1:11:14] seed and the original sin drawn out
[1:11:16] etched in stone
[1:11:18] let the devil try to do away with that
[1:11:19] one think probably wait a hundred tons
[1:11:22] and it was cut deep and it had survived
[1:11:24] 4 000 years it wasn't going anywhere
[1:11:28] and so you find that that it is
[1:11:30] intrinsic to humanity to pray to to
[1:11:33] mankind universally universally is
[1:11:37] driven to seek something higher than
[1:11:40] himself
[1:11:44] he's all the time looking for
[1:11:46] meaning
[1:11:48] he's all the time searching for truth
[1:11:51] he's all the time looking for purpose
[1:11:55] that's why the search can seem
[1:11:58] impossible you you can find people who
[1:12:01] are very sincere they try very hard
[1:12:04] to find truth they goodness they they
[1:12:08] they leave homes they leave careers they
[1:12:11] leave families they they they leave
[1:12:14] high-paying jobs they go on pilgrimages
[1:12:18] they they you know they they they they
[1:12:20] go they try all kinds of Western
[1:12:22] religions and all kinds of Eastern
[1:12:25] religions and far away mysticisms and
[1:12:28] Cults of all kinds and you know brother
[1:12:32] Branham called him wandering Stars
[1:12:35] wandering Stars
[1:12:37] Sons and Daughters of God who were men
[1:12:40] who were built to worship God you were
[1:12:43] you were you know I remember a story in
[1:12:46] in in the during the times of the
[1:12:48] Holocaust under Nazi Germany
[1:12:51] and it was not Corey ten Boom but it was
[1:12:53] another man who had been a survivor
[1:12:56] and he testified how that you know some
[1:13:01] hard-nosed guard decided to wail on him
[1:13:04] and and because he you know he knew he
[1:13:07] was a Jew and he starts wailing on him
[1:13:09] he says I'm God I'm God I'm God and the
[1:13:13] the Jewish man looked right and looked
[1:13:15] him dead in his eye and said you're
[1:13:17] correct you were built to be a god
[1:13:21] you were built in the image of God to be
[1:13:25] an amateur God and to rule and reign
[1:13:27] with God see
[1:13:29] and it literally
[1:13:30] that German Soldier he stopped he he
[1:13:33] went away thinking about that and it's
[1:13:35] so true friends that that's what that's
[1:13:37] what you are built as a human for and
[1:13:40] brother Branham said oh wandering Stars
[1:13:42] you go from cult to cult from church to
[1:13:45] church from this movement to that
[1:13:47] movement all wandering stars come home
[1:13:50] today
[1:13:52] come home they they search everywhere
[1:13:55] but yet they they never find that's that
[1:13:58] certain thing that they're searching for
[1:13:59] sometimes you'll see them later you'll
[1:14:01] come across them again or you'll see a
[1:14:03] news article about them and and they'll
[1:14:05] be much older and and and and they
[1:14:07] they're no closer
[1:14:09] they're no closer than before to finding
[1:14:13] truth and reason and purpose and they
[1:14:15] still don't know the answer and now
[1:14:17] they're they're spun out of control uh
[1:14:20] into a chaos they even even can be
[1:14:24] disillusioned with life itself
[1:14:29] I think this was the meaning that
[1:14:31] brother Branham had in the Patmos vision
[1:14:34] but he's teaching on the church ages and
[1:14:37] you remember there the voice of many
[1:14:39] Waters
[1:14:40] in the in the Book of Revelation and
[1:14:42] brother Branham says what is his voice
[1:14:45] it's the Judgment it's the voice of the
[1:14:47] ministers see and so brother Branham
[1:14:51] starts talking about a man
[1:14:54] drifting
[1:14:55] man or woman drifting on the sea of life
[1:15:00] it's a common phrase
[1:15:02] you know we and and brother Branham you
[1:15:06] know talks about how what a sad
[1:15:08] existence if if your life I just read
[1:15:10] one Wednesday night where he says don't
[1:15:12] just drift around
[1:15:14] have a purpose that but I can't find a
[1:15:16] purpose God has your purpose
[1:15:19] he has it waiting
[1:15:21] it's all ready to go it's it's boxed up
[1:15:24] and Rick got a big ribbon on it all you
[1:15:25] got to do is open it and say thank you
[1:15:28] Lord and then the Lord says now I can
[1:15:30] say happy birthday because you've been
[1:15:33] born again
[1:15:35] Hallelujah
[1:15:37] now you can have purpose and brother
[1:15:39] Branham says to the person who who never
[1:15:42] finds that he says what a horrible thing
[1:15:46] for a drifting Soul on the sea of life
[1:15:49] no pilot to guide him loose floating
[1:15:53] with the tides
[1:15:55] to hear the Roar
[1:15:57] uh you know he talks about the Falls if
[1:15:59] you ever lived there as I did in in
[1:16:01] Jeffersonville and they we we would see
[1:16:04] them all the time the Falls they had the
[1:16:05] Ohio River flowed down and and there's a
[1:16:08] great uh Falls there and and they would
[1:16:11] open that and blow a big horn and you
[1:16:12] had to get away from it and I grew up
[1:16:14] around that and had a strong current in
[1:16:17] that River because of it and and and he
[1:16:19] says you know to to know that you can
[1:16:22] hear
[1:16:22] the sound of those cataracts the sound
[1:16:25] of those Falls and know that you're
[1:16:28] drifting over and you're going to perish
[1:16:30] and there's nothing brother says what a
[1:16:33] horrible thing
[1:16:36] but hope is not lost
[1:16:39] because there's another River
[1:16:42] Hallelujah there's another River there's
[1:16:45] a River of Life friends oh do you want
[1:16:48] to flow on that River today
[1:16:51] Hallelujah it flows from eternity from
[1:16:55] that great Fountain we introduced you to
[1:16:56] in the very first installment of this
[1:16:58] series
[1:16:59] it flows from that great fountain in
[1:17:02] eternity Soul great
[1:17:04] so great a fountain of love that
[1:17:09] flowed from Christ
[1:17:11] that he as we said here and as we've
[1:17:14] said I'll repeat it today that so great
[1:17:17] of love that he had
[1:17:19] that he literally would take the penalty
[1:17:22] of his own law
[1:17:24] and suffer death himself come in the
[1:17:27] form of sinful flesh and Live Like A man
[1:17:29] among us
[1:17:30] and live out the perceptive sight of the
[1:17:33] word on your behalf which you could
[1:17:34] never do
[1:17:36] which ended up making him not just our
[1:17:38] atonement but our total satisfaction
[1:17:40] atonement's only half the story
[1:17:43] see atonement just means that he
[1:17:45] expiated all your sin he was a proper
[1:17:47] lamb worthy and when he gave his life
[1:17:50] that that removed all the sin charge
[1:17:53] against you that you were born with but
[1:17:56] now the there's still a perceptive side
[1:17:58] to this because the way your life then
[1:18:01] has to be line upon line precept upon
[1:18:03] precept
[1:18:05] so you have to still have to live it
[1:18:07] perfectly well that's a problem because
[1:18:09] I'm in a fallen body and I can't live it
[1:18:11] perfectly sure shooting I'll I'll make a
[1:18:14] mistake there's as hard as I'll try I'll
[1:18:16] grip my teeth I'll come to church and
[1:18:18] read my Bible but I'm bound to doubt
[1:18:20] somewhere I'm bound to get a little
[1:18:22] stumble somewhere so Christ Not only was
[1:18:25] he the atonement but he also was your
[1:18:29] propitiation he was also lived the
[1:18:32] perceptive side precept upon precept he
[1:18:36] lived a perfect life and God took his
[1:18:38] perfect life and gave you credit for it
[1:18:41] and took all your mistakes and piled
[1:18:44] them on Jesus and he died at Calvary and
[1:18:47] went to hell as a sinner
[1:18:50] that's that's the story that's the true
[1:18:53] story of the Gospel just in case you
[1:18:55] might have heard that the gospel is
[1:18:57] signing join a church and sign a book
[1:19:00] that's an impersonation of Christianity
[1:19:04] God the whole Christianity is all about
[1:19:07] God trading his life for yours
[1:19:09] and trading your life for his
[1:19:11] and that's not a metaphor and that's not
[1:19:14] a story and that's not a fairy tale
[1:19:16] that's that's literal
[1:19:19] that's literal you you literally live by
[1:19:24] the life of God living inside you you
[1:19:26] viscerally are internally you are a new
[1:19:30] creation in Christ Jesus and that's not
[1:19:33] a natural thing that's a supernatural
[1:19:36] thing you can't do it to yourself see
[1:19:39] but because of that day because that he
[1:19:42] was willing to do that because you know
[1:19:45] because of that day on Calvary now any
[1:19:48] man or any woman who seeks the right who
[1:19:51] seeks the pure who seeks the holy would
[1:19:54] be able to find their way back home back
[1:19:58] home say where back home to where I
[1:20:01] began in Christ back to where all was
[1:20:04] right and and whatever and whatever
[1:20:06] might be wrong will be made right
[1:20:09] Hallelujah we have the way home friends
[1:20:14] oh my a place where all is true where
[1:20:17] all is pure where all is Holy I remember
[1:20:20] years ago
[1:20:23] brother physical told us true story from
[1:20:25] his life as a Young Man hunting
[1:20:28] and the far
[1:20:30] north of the Canadian Rockies I've been
[1:20:33] there hunting myself
[1:20:37] the only place I've ever been in the
[1:20:39] Earth where you couldn't hear anything
[1:20:41] but the wind
[1:20:43] or maybe a a howling animal somewhere
[1:20:47] there was no other sound that you didn't
[1:20:49] hear an aircraft you didn't hear a
[1:20:51] highway
[1:20:52] you didn't hear anything you were just
[1:20:55] among the Pines or among the brush and
[1:20:58] you hear the wind blowing
[1:21:00] and you know I I I I was I was so much
[1:21:05] of a green one I couldn't believe it but
[1:21:06] Eugene is life-threatening to go with
[1:21:08] him into the Wilderness brother Eugene
[1:21:10] Braun and you know he just hands me a
[1:21:13] rifle and a compass and a radio and says
[1:21:17] you see that mountain I'm like yeah he
[1:21:19] goes okay I'm gonna go this way and you
[1:21:21] go that way and we'll meet for lunch on
[1:21:23] top of that mountain I was like
[1:21:25] okay so I'm gonna go from here and I'm
[1:21:29] gonna how will I oh you'll figure it out
[1:21:30] I'll see you on the Mountaintop that was
[1:21:33] it it was my guide in the wilderness
[1:21:36] [Laughter]
[1:21:41] I tell you what everything was fine
[1:21:43] until I went down a path
[1:21:46] and fortunately it was Daylight and I
[1:21:48] went down a path
[1:21:50] quite a ways and and I realized I had
[1:21:52] went into an area where I couldn't cross
[1:21:53] a river and I was going to have to
[1:21:56] double back and go back up and around on
[1:21:58] The High Ground
[1:22:00] and when I doubled back along my own
[1:22:02] path I saw my tracks and so it was easy
[1:22:06] just to follow my tracks and after I
[1:22:08] followed my tracks for 50 70 yards or so
[1:22:11] suddenly
[1:22:12] the side of my tracks is Wolf tracks
[1:22:17] and
[1:22:19] I'm being stalked
[1:22:22] now you have a rifle but you don't feel
[1:22:24] safe
[1:22:28] fortunately it wasn't a pack it was one
[1:22:31] Lobo it was one Lone Wolf who was
[1:22:34] following behind me
[1:22:36] and apparently when I doubled back and
[1:22:38] he smelled me or saw me or heard me he
[1:22:40] went off the trail because I could see
[1:22:42] that I had spooked him I'd as long as he
[1:22:44] stayed smoked anyway I made it to the
[1:22:47] Mountaintop
[1:22:48] and I walked on a walk and I walked and
[1:22:51] walked and it was starting to get dark
[1:22:52] and I and I'm on the mountain and I see
[1:22:55] a campfire and I walk and there's
[1:22:56] brother Eugene kicked back with his hat
[1:22:58] and his boots and a campfire going and
[1:23:01] Foods being cooked and oh my we sit
[1:23:04] there and as we sit there talking about
[1:23:05] the things of God and little light snow
[1:23:07] begin to fall and we just sit there
[1:23:09] rejoicing in nature and it was so
[1:23:12] wonderful
[1:23:13] and brother Ed tells the story
[1:23:17] about how that he was way back there
[1:23:21] hunting
[1:23:22] and alone because that's how you do you
[1:23:24] break up and you go in different
[1:23:25] directions you have a rallying point
[1:23:29] and he he found himself after many hours
[1:23:32] of hiking and
[1:23:34] he climbed a very high mountain and as
[1:23:37] he he said as I made the last step and
[1:23:40] stepped onto the the top of this
[1:23:43] mountain he said it and there standing
[1:23:46] before me was this large metal Tower
[1:23:51] he said my goodness here's this tower
[1:23:53] out in the middle of the Wilderness and
[1:23:56] it was just standing there
[1:23:58] wasn't even making any noise
[1:24:01] and he he knew it he knew it was powered
[1:24:04] because at the very top he could see a
[1:24:07] slow pulsing red light that would be for
[1:24:10] aircraft to not crash into it
[1:24:13] and he said as I stood there
[1:24:16] and I I looked up at that Tower
[1:24:19] that lone Tower in the wilderness and he
[1:24:21] said there it was
[1:24:23] against the backdrop of that gray wintry
[1:24:27] Canadian sky
[1:24:30] and he says I thought to myself
[1:24:32] that Tower
[1:24:34] is active
[1:24:36] and I it's TR it's receiving and
[1:24:39] transmitting obviously that's why
[1:24:41] they've got it out here they don't just
[1:24:42] put a heap of metal on a mountain and
[1:24:44] put a blinking light for no reason
[1:24:48] and he said I knew that it was some kind
[1:24:50] of communication Tower
[1:24:54] said it struck me that
[1:24:57] that Tower as I stood there and stared
[1:25:00] at it against that cold gray sky he said
[1:25:02] it occurred to me this thing is
[1:25:05] receiving
[1:25:07] information and voices and it's
[1:25:10] transmitting maybe it's relaying uh
[1:25:13] information and voices and colors and
[1:25:16] and and and and and and he says but you
[1:25:19] know he says I couldn't hear any of it
[1:25:24] he said although the the signal was all
[1:25:28] around me and even flowing through my
[1:25:30] body
[1:25:32] he said to me it was nothing it was
[1:25:36] silence he said because
[1:25:39] in order to catch that signal you had to
[1:25:42] have a radio
[1:25:43] and then that radio there had to be a
[1:25:46] crystal and that Crystal had to be set
[1:25:49] to a certain frequency it couldn't just
[1:25:51] be anything couldn't be random you had
[1:25:54] to dial in and if you had that receiving
[1:25:58] set then you could hear what was coming
[1:26:03] from the tower
[1:26:04] and he thought about himself you know
[1:26:07] the Bible says that the prophet asked
[1:26:09] the Lord says you know have they have
[1:26:12] they not heard
[1:26:14] you know Paul deals with that why is it
[1:26:17] people can hear the gospel
[1:26:19] and you can you can have a preacher
[1:26:22] preaching to you know 100 people and and
[1:26:26] some of them are catching it and some of
[1:26:28] them it's going right through them and
[1:26:29] it means nothing to them at all
[1:26:32] they don't hear the sound within the
[1:26:34] sound there's nothing responding down
[1:26:38] inside of them oh Hallelujah and he said
[1:26:41] you know he said uh and so Paul says but
[1:26:45] the prophet said have they not heard
[1:26:48] and he answers it Paul answers it from
[1:26:50] the words of the Prophet yay the his
[1:26:53] sound went into all the Earth
[1:26:56] and even though many of Israel heard it
[1:26:59] with him he was not well pleased because
[1:27:01] they didn't mix it with faith
[1:27:03] they just wanted to keep it as just some
[1:27:06] just some philosophy or some Doctrine or
[1:27:08] some teaching and they weren't
[1:27:10] interested in it becoming skin this this
[1:27:13] the the plan for this has always been to
[1:27:16] live behind flesh he didn't write it to
[1:27:19] say this he he wrote it in the stars but
[1:27:22] then he wrote it in a pyramid and then
[1:27:24] he wrote it in a book and now he's
[1:27:26] trying to write it in you
[1:27:28] that's why Christ was a prototype of
[1:27:30] what you're going to be a body like it
[1:27:33] under his glorious body
[1:27:35] oh and the books are closed for the last
[1:27:38] time the word will be flesh
[1:27:41] and he said I thought to myself you know
[1:27:44] uh here here I am
[1:27:46] their sound went into all the Earth
[1:27:49] but with many he was not well pleased
[1:27:51] they didn't mix it with faith on in them
[1:27:54] that heard it human I mean goodness
[1:27:57] gracious Humanity I think they would
[1:28:01] rather
[1:28:02] spend trillions of dollars on radio
[1:28:04] antennas to listen for aliens
[1:28:09] right here at the time when the trumpet
[1:28:12] of God is ready to sound
[1:28:14] when the gospel sound when the when the
[1:28:17] dead in Christ are ready to come when a
[1:28:19] shout has gone forward when a voice is
[1:28:21] echoing when a trumpet's ready to sound
[1:28:23] and the world doesn't hear it but I hear
[1:28:26] it
[1:28:26] I hear it I receive it dead I won't
[1:28:30] ignore it it's it's life to me
[1:28:35] it means nothing to the world but it
[1:28:37] means everything to me his family has a
[1:28:41] receiving scent I hear his signal loud
[1:28:44] and clear do you hear it loud and clear
[1:28:46] today
[1:28:49] I'm sorry for you if you don't hear it
[1:28:51] and I'm
[1:28:52] sorry for you if you don't want to hear
[1:28:55] it
[1:28:56] but I do
[1:28:59] I do
[1:29:01] that's why I preach why I preach I want
[1:29:04] to hear what he has to say
[1:29:06] I can't ignore it I don't want to ignore
[1:29:09] it
[1:29:10] I want to follow it with my whole heart
[1:29:13] I uh that's my desire I hope that's your
[1:29:16] desire today
[1:29:18] see
[1:29:21] I want to turn a corner
[1:29:24] in my
[1:29:26] sermon today
[1:29:28] I'm about to get every female's
[1:29:30] attention
[1:29:31] I'm going to turn a corner I want to
[1:29:33] preach on girl power
[1:29:36] look at these girls sitting up what huh
[1:29:38] [Laughter]
[1:29:40] come on sisters how about an amen I
[1:29:42] don't preach on girl power
[1:29:48] I want to deal with two
[1:29:50] Dynamic ladies
[1:29:53] incredible ladies
[1:29:55] bravery bravery it's not a word for it
[1:30:00] brother Jesus talks about one and
[1:30:04] brother Branham takes The Narrative of
[1:30:06] another
[1:30:07] and we've read it in our text
[1:30:10] how that Jesus said to them that the
[1:30:14] Queen of Sheba who she came from the far
[1:30:17] south
[1:30:18] to hear the words of Solomon she'll rise
[1:30:22] you're talking about girl power
[1:30:24] the Queen of Sheba will rise and condemn
[1:30:28] this generation
[1:30:30] of unbelieving men and women and
[1:30:32] unbelieving churches and preachers and
[1:30:34] governments every kind of thing she'll
[1:30:37] rise and condemn anyone who gave some
[1:30:40] flimsy worthless excuse oh it was too
[1:30:44] hard to do oh I just I wanted to do my
[1:30:47] own thing this queen risked her life
[1:30:52] and she came hundreds of miles across
[1:30:55] the Arabian Desert
[1:30:57] with Bandits and thieves who would have
[1:30:59] killed her ravaged her and slaughtered
[1:31:01] her in her guards and took everything
[1:31:03] and left her for dead in the sand
[1:31:06] she pressed through to hear the words of
[1:31:09] Solomon
[1:31:11] brother Branham also picks up and gives
[1:31:14] us tremendous prophetic insight to Rahab
[1:31:17] the Harlot
[1:31:19] laodicea thinks it knows something about
[1:31:21] girl power
[1:31:25] do you want to know what real girl power
[1:31:27] is
[1:31:29] here's some real girl power girls
[1:31:33] when the entire city of Jericho
[1:31:37] the king all the princes and every man
[1:31:42] in the Army was ready to fight against
[1:31:45] Jehovah one woman living along the wall
[1:31:49] caught a revelation
[1:31:53] that's girl power
[1:31:57] an entire city both of these
[1:32:00] strong women
[1:32:02] as brother Branham really unfolds only
[1:32:05] the way a prophet could
[1:32:07] how that they imagined
[1:32:09] that there must surely be more certainly
[1:32:12] certainly more than what they were being
[1:32:15] told
[1:32:17] they lived in the world hundreds of
[1:32:21] years apart and separated by different
[1:32:24] regions and
[1:32:26] different cultures of the world they
[1:32:29] couldn't have been more unalike
[1:32:33] the Queen of Sheba
[1:32:35] born into Royal station
[1:32:39] from a very young age she's taught to
[1:32:42] believe that God didn't really operate
[1:32:45] in power and demonstration that
[1:32:48] certainly he could well he could never
[1:32:50] be touched by the feeling of her
[1:32:52] infirmities
[1:32:54] say brother Jason how in the world can
[1:32:57] you know that because of Solomon
[1:33:00] who taught me
[1:33:02] that there's nothing new Under the
[1:33:04] heavens and whatever has been
[1:33:07] whatever is has been and will be again
[1:33:10] see so what she so so so you know what
[1:33:15] she was being told by her counselors
[1:33:18] is exactly what we View today
[1:33:23] I can see that happening today this is
[1:33:25] how God this is how God is viewed
[1:33:29] any time that it's it has anything to do
[1:33:33] with man-made organized religion
[1:33:38] so because that I can see today what you
[1:33:42] have with organized man-made religion
[1:33:44] that you know he's at he's at best well
[1:33:47] we believe in him but he's at best you
[1:33:49] know an impersonal being you know who
[1:33:51] only seeks a form of religious
[1:33:55] observation you see I'm I and and and
[1:33:58] and by that I'm not talking about say
[1:34:02] how do you know that because I I got
[1:34:04] eyes I can see
[1:34:05] now I'm not talking about what they say
[1:34:07] with their lips
[1:34:09] there's all kinds of people as we were
[1:34:11] preaching Wednesday who say a lot of
[1:34:13] things about God with their lips and it
[1:34:16] sounds really good and really appealing
[1:34:18] but I'm not talking about what they're
[1:34:20] saying with their lips I'm talking about
[1:34:22] what are they saying with their life
[1:34:25] the voice of your life is is what God is
[1:34:29] hearing see
[1:34:31] and so we we were showing that Wednesday
[1:34:33] night how many worship him with their
[1:34:36] lips but their life shows precious
[1:34:38] little difference after they claim to
[1:34:40] have met Christ
[1:34:43] Jesus talks about that in Matthew 15 8
[1:34:46] to 9 this people and this was Israel
[1:34:49] this is a holy nation but even even
[1:34:51] Israel draweth nigh unto me with their
[1:34:55] mouth and honoreth me with their lips
[1:34:57] but their heart
[1:35:02] is far from me
[1:35:06] therefore the consequence of that is in
[1:35:09] vain do they worship me now he's not
[1:35:12] saying they didn't worship he's just
[1:35:13] saying it don't count
[1:35:15] in vain do they worship me teaching for
[1:35:18] Doctrine the Commandments of men see but
[1:35:22] no real power no no impact of a life or
[1:35:26] no indwelling life consequently
[1:35:29] then there's no Liberty
[1:35:31] because only the Life of Christ you
[1:35:34] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[1:35:36] make you not set you make you free see
[1:35:40] and so so that when you only have a
[1:35:44] testimony of your mouth and of your lips
[1:35:47] but you have no impact in your life you
[1:35:50] have no indwelling of the Holy Spirit
[1:35:52] then you then you have no Liberty that
[1:35:55] those man-made religions I'm here to
[1:35:57] tell you the impersonation of
[1:35:59] Christianity cannot get you free from
[1:36:02] sin
[1:36:03] they can put you under a legal code and
[1:36:07] make you live a certain way but you'll
[1:36:09] fight against a all your life and in the
[1:36:11] end it still won't have given you the
[1:36:13] value of eternal life
[1:36:17] this young Queen
[1:36:19] was taught that God was little more than
[1:36:23] a disconnected being he didn't actually
[1:36:24] move in the Affairs of men this
[1:36:27] non-caring God
[1:36:29] simply didn't care
[1:36:32] all she would have in life
[1:36:35] was to perform her royal duties
[1:36:39] live out her days on the earth and go by
[1:36:42] the way of the grave
[1:36:44] no end to the monotony of life no hope
[1:36:48] for a brighter world where real love and
[1:36:52] real Harmony and true peace could exist
[1:36:56] between all peoples
[1:36:57] her whole life was confined to a form
[1:37:04] that lasted for years
[1:37:07] until she grew
[1:37:09] into a beautiful young woman
[1:37:12] like we have in here many in here today
[1:37:16] that was fine when she was a little girl
[1:37:19] but finally she grew and blossomed into
[1:37:21] a beautiful young woman who could think
[1:37:24] for herself
[1:37:25] now
[1:37:27] her girl power was starting to turn
[1:37:31] she could think
[1:37:33] for herself
[1:37:37] simultaneously
[1:37:39] the source of both her greatest strength
[1:37:41] and her greatest weakness
[1:37:45] because now she's more vulnerable
[1:37:48] than ever
[1:37:50] see
[1:37:52] say what what what determines it it
[1:37:54] depends on who has control of her heart
[1:37:58] not rocket science sisters
[1:38:01] it's not difficult
[1:38:04] it's it's about who has control of your
[1:38:08] heart
[1:38:10] see
[1:38:12] depending on if that's the true God
[1:38:14] depending on if it's your maker
[1:38:16] who has control of your heart
[1:38:19] or the God of this evil age
[1:38:22] who wanted who who for this queen
[1:38:26] he wanted to twist her off just like
[1:38:28] they do today
[1:38:31] twist girls off
[1:38:33] into modern striptease and
[1:38:37] an adulterous
[1:38:39] and just just so that evil men can gawk
[1:38:42] at them
[1:38:45] but if you fill your mind sisters you
[1:38:47] want a secret to real girl power
[1:38:51] fill your mind with God's thoughts
[1:38:55] and if you're willing to fill your mind
[1:38:57] with God's thoughts and your willing as
[1:39:01] Paul said to cast down imaginations and
[1:39:05] every High thing that exalteth itself
[1:39:08] against the knowledge of God if you're
[1:39:11] willing to bring into captivity every
[1:39:13] thought to The Obedience of Christ then
[1:39:16] thinking for yourself is wonderful
[1:39:20] see now you can Rage Against the plan of
[1:39:23] God
[1:39:24] you can women do it in Mass they hear
[1:39:28] the word of God for their life they rage
[1:39:30] against it I won't have it I won't do it
[1:39:32] I just won't do it well that road has a
[1:39:34] horrible ending
[1:39:36] you say oh
[1:39:38] that's the 21st century I can I
[1:39:45] I can think thoughts that are that are
[1:39:47] not influenced by Christ or the
[1:39:49] Antichrist they're just my thoughts
[1:39:53] but that's just not true
[1:39:58] that's just not true
[1:40:02] if you can reach a point listen
[1:40:06] if you could reach a point now think
[1:40:09] with me sisters
[1:40:11] if you could reach a point where where
[1:40:14] you have the mind of your creator
[1:40:16] working within you what better way would
[1:40:21] you imagine there would be of thinking
[1:40:24] for yourself because you would be able
[1:40:26] to think like him
[1:40:29] you would have his thoughts the creator
[1:40:32] of all the universe
[1:40:34] you're talking about girl power that God
[1:40:37] can use
[1:40:41] oh my
[1:40:43] see
[1:40:46] this is actually the truth as I said in
[1:40:48] the first of my sermon this is actually
[1:40:50] the truth that actually Satan wrapped it
[1:40:52] in a lie and hid it from Eve she that
[1:40:55] she would be like God if she did it his
[1:40:57] way but God already had that plan for
[1:40:59] her Satan offered it to her through a
[1:41:02] lie so what she was already entitled to
[1:41:05] would have she would have come to listen
[1:41:07] to this now Satan's worldly campaign
[1:41:13] Satan listen sisters
[1:41:16] Satan's worldly campaign of getting you
[1:41:20] to think for yourself is really it's
[1:41:24] Rich it's it's merely him trying to
[1:41:28] deceive you into thinking his thoughts
[1:41:32] that's all it is
[1:41:34] because the best way to think for
[1:41:36] yourself is to let the mind which was in
[1:41:39] Christ be in you
[1:41:41] so don't fall for it don't fall don't
[1:41:43] drink that Kool-Aid don't fall for that
[1:41:47] I've come a long way baby I can think
[1:41:50] for myself you'll go to hell thinking
[1:41:52] like that God is trying to save you from
[1:41:55] that
[1:41:56] God can use like he did these two very
[1:41:59] Godly women
[1:42:01] see in the end sisters brothers as well
[1:42:06] in the end
[1:42:08] if you think his thoughts the end of
[1:42:10] that is bondage
[1:42:12] and he has no other outcome but to
[1:42:16] destroy you
[1:42:18] you need to understand that his only
[1:42:20] outcome is to destroy you
[1:42:24] the world under this satanic
[1:42:27] influence
[1:42:29] I I probably won't get to that today I'm
[1:42:31] going to stop here in a minute
[1:42:33] the world under this satanic influence
[1:42:39] I hate
[1:42:41] to say this so crudely you forgive me
[1:42:45] but it Stacks loose women like cordwood
[1:42:52] piles them up
[1:42:54] piles of Filth that men don't even
[1:42:57] respect
[1:43:00] and would never imagine marrying a loose
[1:43:02] woman like that
[1:43:04] they become a dime a dozen
[1:43:08] and the men responsible are even worse
[1:43:15] how about you think this sister rejects
[1:43:17] Satan
[1:43:19] and let the mind of Christ be in you
[1:43:21] someone who really love you
[1:43:23] someone who really care someone who'll
[1:43:26] grow you into a royal lady real
[1:43:28] daughters real sons of the Living God
[1:43:32] and place you in a kingdom as a member
[1:43:35] of the royal family to rule and reign
[1:43:37] with Christ through ceaseless ages
[1:43:41] that's what is offered to you today this
[1:43:43] is the advantage this is the advantage
[1:43:45] of good parents
[1:43:49] if you have Godly Parents listen young
[1:43:51] people if you have Godly Parents
[1:43:54] who teach you the ways of right
[1:43:57] that is so rare
[1:43:59] you should be thankful be deeply
[1:44:01] thankful because not all children have
[1:44:03] that most do not
[1:44:06] see no one can give you the mind of
[1:44:09] Christ that has to come by New Birth but
[1:44:12] what a parent can do is teach you about
[1:44:15] him and as I was saying Wednesday raise
[1:44:18] you in a way that you should go so that
[1:44:21] down the road the Holy Spirit can
[1:44:23] already be a step ahead and can deal
[1:44:26] with your loved ones see so that this is
[1:44:29] the primary purpose of being a parent
[1:44:31] primary purpose listen young people the
[1:44:34] primary purpose of your parent is not to
[1:44:37] prepare you to live here but to go there
[1:44:41] that's the primary purpose anytime
[1:44:44] parents have that inverted they are
[1:44:46] failing in their commission all of their
[1:44:49] many good accomplishments
[1:44:51] notwithstanding but that's the most
[1:44:54] important part listen as I I I I'm
[1:44:58] getting ready to close
[1:45:00] I want to tell you something
[1:45:02] hell
[1:45:04] will be filled with young men and young
[1:45:09] women who will be cut down in the prime
[1:45:13] of their life in a tribulation period
[1:45:16] who were raised to believe that the
[1:45:20] greatest achievements in their life was
[1:45:23] social acceptance higher education
[1:45:25] greater station and position in the
[1:45:28] world they will die in the Millions
[1:45:36] they will die in the tens and hundreds
[1:45:39] of millions in Mankind's
[1:45:43] self-destructive act at Armageddon
[1:45:47] but I'm here to tell you
[1:45:49] there will be millions of young men and
[1:45:53] young women who get a hold of the word
[1:45:55] of God who have parents and pastors that
[1:45:58] tell them the truth who want who will
[1:46:00] escape the tribulation and who will live

[1:47:32] Lord just feeling the unction of the
[1:47:34] Holy Spirit to close right away
[1:47:38] I promised you I wouldn't take my own
[1:47:40] thoughts and so when I felt you say stop
[1:47:44] now
[1:47:46] ask the people to think about what
[1:47:48] they've heard today
[1:47:51] God is trying
[1:47:53] and he's determined and he's going to
[1:47:56] succeed
[1:47:57] in his plan
[1:47:59] to rebuild Eden
[1:48:02] that's what the gospel came to do that's
[1:48:06] why the message is here that's why God
[1:48:08] sent us a prophet
[1:48:11] because
[1:48:12] when the world
[1:48:15] was in chaos we've already seen this
[1:48:18] when the world was in chaos and darkness
[1:48:21] covered the face of the deep
[1:48:23] there's no light there was nothing it
[1:48:25] was just a chaotic volcanic twisting
[1:48:28] turning hurling through space thousands
[1:48:31] of miles an hour
[1:48:33] but God had a plan to bring it into
[1:48:36] order
[1:48:37] he was gonna set forth light and
[1:48:40] darkness he was going to set forth land
[1:48:42] and gonna separate the land from the
[1:48:44] water he was gonna begin to bring it
[1:48:47] back to order and he did every bit of it
[1:48:49] by his word
[1:48:51] he spoke and the Earth obeyed him he
[1:48:55] spoke like Jesus did in the winds and
[1:48:57] the waves obeyed him proved who he was
[1:48:59] he had been doing that since Genesis
[1:49:04] and on that Earth he built a garden and
[1:49:06] on that Garden he put his family
[1:49:09] he had a grand plan
[1:49:12] that he would fill the whole earth with
[1:49:14] his family he said to Adam and Eve be
[1:49:16] fruitful multiply replenish the Earth
[1:49:19] subdue it and have dominion
[1:49:22] this was his plan for his family
[1:49:25] sin came along and perverted his way but
[1:49:28] as a prophet said we come anyhow
[1:49:31] but we're born in sin we were always
[1:49:35] going to be here but we were supposed to
[1:49:37] come by a spoken word when we bypassed
[1:49:40] that theophany and we came straight to
[1:49:42] the Flesh and we were lost
[1:49:45] and that's why Jesus came to die on our
[1:49:48] behalf
[1:49:49] so that through the Life of Christ I can
[1:49:52] be made new
[1:49:54] and that the chaos of my life the chaos
[1:49:57] that I can't fix
[1:49:58] something that would give me real
[1:50:01] meaning and real purpose in life and not
[1:50:03] just chasing after Satan's sparkly Eden
[1:50:07] I don't want Satan's shiny things
[1:50:10] I want the glow of the Holy Spirit
[1:50:14] God is restoring Eden and you're a part
[1:50:18] of it friends today with your heads
[1:50:21] bowed you're a part of it
[1:50:23] you're a part of Eden
[1:50:25] God is looking to restore your life and
[1:50:28] restore the Earth and he even brings you
[1:50:30] both through Redemption with the exact
[1:50:32] same process

[1:50:48] Calvary and at the end of the Millennium
[1:50:51] there will be a holy fire that will
[1:50:54] baptize the Earth
[1:50:56] the bride of Christ all the family of
[1:50:59] God will be caught up into a higher
[1:51:00] Dimension a prophet teaches us we'll
[1:51:02] come up into heaven while the Earth is
[1:51:05] being burned over
[1:51:07] blowing away going back through its
[1:51:10] volcanic eruptions blowing away hundreds
[1:51:13] and hundreds of feet of of surface
[1:51:15] blowing it out into Smithereens and
[1:51:18] fresh virgin soil will come back down
[1:51:20] and we'll rebuild it as a headquarters
[1:51:23] for all the galaxies of all the universe
