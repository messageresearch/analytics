[7:40] thank you
[7:42] morning everyone
[7:43] God bless you let's stand and pray
[7:51] gracious father we come before you Lord
[7:52] and we ask that your presence would be
[7:55] amongst us Lord leading us and guiding
[7:58] us into all truth Lord I pray that you
[7:59] take your word and make it alive and
[8:01] real in our hearts Lord help us to get
[8:04] ourselves out of the way Lord that you
[8:05] would move and be glorified amongst us
[8:07] we ask in Jesus name amen
[8:11] and we're going to read from Isaiah
[8:14] chapter 4 continuing on the subject
[8:18] seven women take hold of one man
[8:21] and in that day seven women shall take
[8:23] hold of one man saying we will eat our
[8:25] own bread
[8:26] and wear our own apparel only let us be
[8:29] called by thy name to take away our
[8:30] reproach
[8:32] in that day shall the branch of the Lord
[8:34] be beautiful and glorious and the fruit
[8:36] of the Earth shall be excellent and
[8:38] calmly for them that are escaped of
[8:40] Israel may the Lord add the blessing to
[8:42] the reading of his word he could be
[8:43] seated
[8:45] so if you're if you haven't been here
[8:47] for the previous
[8:49] Sunday schools I guess go back and
[8:51] listen because
[8:53] I'm not going to spend a ton of time
[8:54] explaining what I have the last four
[8:58] different times but just to give a
[9:00] picture we're looking at a prophecy of
[9:02] scripture
[9:03] and we're looking at uh as brother
[9:06] Branham says many scriptures are dual
[9:07] prophecies and so if you look in the
[9:10] natural this of course is
[9:12] uh in many ways speaking of the hour
[9:14] when that Jesus prophesied in 70 A.D
[9:17] where not one stone would be left upon
[9:20] another of the temple and the men would
[9:23] be killed and and there would be women
[9:25] left and women would then need to find a
[9:29] husband and this is what they said we'll
[9:32] we'll deal with our own Provisions only
[9:36] just give us your name so we can be
[9:37] called by that but then you fast forward
[9:40] to the spiritual prophecy and look at it
[9:42] in the end times and you'll see that
[9:45] within this is the seed of feminism but
[9:48] not only that bigger picture than that
[9:51] is in that next portion of the the the
[9:53] the verse in verse two the branch of the
[9:56] Lord will be beautiful and glorious
[9:58] speaking of the bride of Christ who will
[10:00] be without spot or wrinkle or any such
[10:03] thing in the last days so looking at
[10:06] those two different two different things
[10:07] you have the the church world and then
[10:10] the true elected bride of of Christ on
[10:13] one side the church World saying we'll
[10:15] have our own Doctrine we'll have our own
[10:17] theology we'll have our own approach to
[10:20] the Bible only let us be called by the
[10:22] name of Christ to take away our reproach
[10:26] but the but then on the reverse side is
[10:28] God has sent his Vindicated word
[10:31] he's he's come on the scene he's he
[10:34] himself has come down with an open book
[10:36] ripped the seals off the book to make
[10:38] them known to us and then Vindicated
[10:40] that with Supernatural signs and wonders
[10:43] to show forth the very presence of
[10:46] almighty God in his bride and what and
[10:49] then what what this what is her response
[10:51] her response is to say just uh let's do
[10:54] our own thing and just let us be called
[10:57] by your name no this this the response
[11:00] of the Bride is
[11:02] amen thank you Lord and then from that
[11:05] the character of Christ is shaped and
[11:08] then from that you see God declares over
[11:11] her she's beautiful and glorious and the
[11:14] fruit of the earth is excellent from her
[11:16] so I'll just leave it at that there's
[11:18] there's many scriptures that everything
[11:19] that go into that but you can get that
[11:21] in Parts one two and three I believe so
[11:24] continuing on from last week again as I
[11:27] said this this might seem weird if you
[11:29] didn't listen to last week's Sunday
[11:31] school this leads directly into that
[11:34] so the feminization of the church we
[11:37] talked about the feminism feminization
[11:38] of culture we talked about the
[11:41] feminization process both in
[11:43] Civilization education and in science
[11:48] right so then we see that now we're
[11:50] going to see the impact on the spiritual
[11:51] side of things of what's happened
[11:54] because you see every denomination has
[11:56] gone into the gone into the place of
[11:58] where is the decline every denomination
[12:00] has made what was the start of it it was
[12:03] the start of first the opposite
[12:05] direction of the Reformation right when
[12:07] the Reformation started with Luther what
[12:10] what did it start with it didn't start
[12:12] with justification by faith it started
[12:14] with what is the absolute what is the
[12:17] final authority of the church the Bible
[12:21] the church is subject to the Bible the
[12:23] church has to be subject to the Bible
[12:25] not to its own traditions and its own
[12:28] internal Authority
[12:30] so what is the dot the downturn of every
[12:33] denomination is when it's it begins to
[12:36] say well uh I'm just going to put it
[12:41] this way they say well
[12:44] Jesus didn't say that Paul said it
[12:47] see what and what's what does that
[12:50] signify
[12:51] what does that signify is they don't ex
[12:54] no longer accept the inerrancy of
[12:56] scripture
[12:57] they believe that they can question and
[13:02] accept some things and reject some
[13:04] things what does it always start with
[13:06] women preachers
[13:08] the very first part spot of decline that
[13:11] takes place is saying women can also be
[13:13] preachers
[13:16] then again I'm not going to go in and
[13:17] prove that point we did in our last
[13:19] three services but that's the start and
[13:22] as soon as that happens liberalism
[13:25] comes in
[13:26] every denomination search the history
[13:28] look at it you'll find out that's
[13:30] absolutely right and so what do we have
[13:33] in today in our church
[13:35] world I should say not our local church
[13:37] necessarily but the church world is the
[13:40] church has been feminized and
[13:43] spirituality and worship has been
[13:45] feminized it's emotion-based it's touchy
[13:48] feely focused it's self-help center
[13:52] Jesus came to give me
[13:54] unconditional Emotional Love regardless
[13:57] of my sinfulness and the purpose of
[13:59] church is to make me feel better
[14:02] emotionally
[14:05] and it's not
[14:07] these are not the things that God that
[14:10] Christ came to do he came to bring
[14:12] Redemption he came to take the sins of
[14:15] mankind and Destroy them and destroy the
[14:18] works of the devil were literally in a
[14:21] war
[14:22] we're not here to have our emotions
[14:24] tickled into our have our feelings built
[14:27] up
[14:29] do those things come sure they come and
[14:31] they go but the word of God doesn't
[14:33] change the truth of God doesn't change
[14:35] the Warfare that we're facing doesn't
[14:38] change based on how we feel is still
[14:40] Warfare
[14:43] this is from David Murrow he says in
[14:45] today's Church the gospel is no longer
[14:47] about saving the world against
[14:48] impossible odds it's about it's about
[14:50] finding a happy relationship with a
[14:53] wonderful man
[14:54] which every woman wants to find that
[14:56] which I mean I guess today we don't even
[14:58] know if they're a woman or not as we've
[15:00] talked about
[15:02] um what is a woman the world doesn't
[15:04] have any clue what that is
[15:06] and so but anyways at any rate
[15:09] a woman wants to find a relationship
[15:11] with a wonderful man and that's a
[15:13] feminizing
[15:14] approach to the gospel is there there is
[15:18] there is fellowship
[15:20] with God and with the Lord Jesus Christ
[15:22] according to scripture
[15:24] it's it is a relationship but the focus
[15:27] is not that it's we were enemies
[15:30] and through the blood of the Cross were
[15:32] brought near and we have fellowship and
[15:35] we worship him it's not necessarily
[15:37] mostly focused on oh I have a
[15:40] relationship
[15:41] you see okay you're you're stumbling at
[15:45] that a little bit but there's a
[15:46] difference between focusing on mere
[15:49] relationship and fellowship it's two
[15:52] different things
[15:53] when you have fellowship with God and
[15:55] you're brought nearer by his blood there
[15:57] is a relationship but it's a that's not
[16:00] that's not it's not a happy relationship
[16:03] all the time is it
[16:05] it's not it's not like your human
[16:08] relationship with your husband or with
[16:10] your friend we use these terminologies
[16:13] but it's far beyond that it far exceeds
[16:16] any of those things if the main focus of
[16:19] the church is merely come and have a
[16:21] relationship with Jesus fantastic but
[16:23] what about the fact that your your
[16:25] enemies with God what if what about the
[16:27] fact that you need to be reconciled
[16:30] you can't be friends with Jesus unless
[16:33] you're reconciled unless you repent
[16:35] if there's no if if there's a gospel of
[16:37] just a relationship and emotions no
[16:40] repentance there is no relationship
[16:43] see this is what I this is the point I'm
[16:45] trying to trying to bring out here is
[16:47] the focus is emotional relationship the
[16:51] focus is not reconciling enemies
[16:55] the gospel is reconciling enemies
[16:59] so let's continue on from there true
[17:01] Womanhood is a beautiful reflection of
[17:03] the bride of Christ
[17:05] true manhood is a beautiful reflection
[17:07] of Christ
[17:09] see and and the the Bible has an order
[17:12] to this and this order has an impact on
[17:15] everything in your home your home should
[17:18] be a reflection of Christ and the church
[17:21] the church itself the local church
[17:23] should also be a reflection of of this
[17:26] the authority of Christ coming down
[17:28] right the authority of Christ the Bible
[17:31] says the head of every woman is the man
[17:33] the head of every man is Christ the head
[17:36] of Christ is God so there's a there's a
[17:38] directional Authority that's flowing
[17:40] down the same thing in a home and this
[17:43] in the same thing in a church
[17:46] so men and women we read this I think
[17:48] three times before but we'll do it again
[17:49] men and women are equal but they're not
[17:52] the same
[17:54] men and women are different at the
[17:56] cellular level every cell is marked as
[17:58] either male or female men have denser
[18:00] bones larger hands and greater muscle
[18:03] mass of course these things should be
[18:04] obvious but there's a great
[18:07] egalitarianism movement that goes on in
[18:10] our society and in the church world that
[18:13] tries to say there's no difference
[18:14] between men and women
[18:16] men and women can fulfill the same roles
[18:18] they can't
[18:20] because they're not made the same
[18:25] men tend to compartmentalize women tend
[18:28] to connect everything men are wired to
[18:30] lead women are wired to nurture or I
[18:32] would say influence
[18:35] Colossians 3 18 and 19 wives submit
[18:38] yourselves unto your own husbands as it
[18:41] is fit in the Lord
[18:43] husbands love your wives and be not
[18:46] bitter against them this is this this is
[18:49] speaking of the bitterness is if you
[18:52] look at that word it's speaking of
[18:53] ruling with rigor or like a dictatorship
[18:57] so husbands love your wives don't rule
[19:00] them like a dictator
[19:03] lead them with love
[19:06] wives submit so that's not a swear word
[19:10] our society think that that's a that's a
[19:12] bad word and women should not submit and
[19:15] that spirit will get will come over and
[19:17] get on Christian women that want to
[19:19] follow the word of God but Society
[19:22] pushes in a certain direction because
[19:24] media and everything else pushes against
[19:28] that and kicks against that and says
[19:31] this is a remnants from the old school
[19:34] patriarchy
[19:36] let's go back to the old school
[19:38] patriarchy but the Bible version of it
[19:44] from the Rapture brother Branham says I
[19:46] remember that night before I seen that I
[19:47] seen the preview of the Bride I stood
[19:49] there and seen a beautiful little lady
[19:51] just correctly dressed at things
[19:53] marching this way there was somebody
[19:55] standing by me in the vision and I seen
[19:57] they said the preview of the Bride I
[20:00] seen her go by they come on this side
[20:02] and went around
[20:03] I heard it coming up the church is
[20:05] coming up from this other side there
[20:07] come the Asian Church oh you talk about
[20:10] filth here come the European Church oh
[20:12] my and then I heard a rock and roll
[20:14] coming and it was Miss America the
[20:16] church and she didn't even have any clue
[20:19] on any clothes my
[20:21] she had papers like newspapers gray hold
[20:24] in front her dancing by rock and roll
[20:26] Miss America the church do you notice
[20:29] that
[20:30] she's not clothed in fine linen clean
[20:33] and white which is the righteousness of
[20:35] saints she's not closed in in the word
[20:39] what has she clothed in news
[20:42] current events
[20:43] politics
[20:45] that's what the modern American church
[20:47] has clothed herself with a connection
[20:50] with politics
[20:53] so then when them women pass by all
[20:56] doing all kinds of rock and things and
[20:58] short hair and painted faces and as they
[21:00] passed like that supposed to be virgins
[21:02] to Christ and when she passed like that
[21:04] I turned my head you know with this
[21:06] holding in front of me was disgraceful
[21:08] the back of them and then where there
[21:10] they was going like that and I turned my
[21:12] head to weeping like that
[21:14] then I heard something like Onward
[21:16] Christian Soldiers I looked and here
[21:18] come that Saint bunch of little girls
[21:19] just exactly the way they was all
[21:22] correctly dressed their hair hanging way
[21:23] down to their back smooth clean marching
[21:26] like this to the step of the Gospel she
[21:28] was the word they looked like one out of
[21:31] every nation I was looking as it as it
[21:34] has passed as they passed by and seen
[21:37] them pass by instead of going down amen
[21:39] they started going up Hallelujah
[21:43] so you see brother branham's vision
[21:46] he's typing the woman
[21:49] of today
[21:50] with both the bride so sisters you're a
[21:54] type of the Bride which is all of us
[21:58] and out in the world that's a type of
[22:01] the church you see the condition of the
[22:03] world it's reflected by the condition of
[22:05] the church it's been that way in every
[22:07] age
[22:08] and and what is it one one is filthy and
[22:12] one is clean
[22:13] it's a very different approach a very
[22:16] different Viewpoint that's taking place
[22:20] a different work completely different
[22:21] world view Titus 2 3 and 5. the aged
[22:25] women likewise that they be in Behavior
[22:27] has become with Holiness not false
[22:29] accusers not given to much wine
[22:31] teachers of good things that they may
[22:34] teach the young women to be sober to
[22:37] love their husbands to love their
[22:39] children to be discreet chaste keepers
[22:42] at home good obedient to their own
[22:44] husbands that the word of God be not
[22:47] blasphemed so this is Paul writing to
[22:50] Titus for Titus to give these
[22:53] instructions so these are the
[22:55] instructions that that ministers need to
[22:58] be giving to their Church
[22:59] and so what what is this what what what
[23:02] are we looking at this is just a you
[23:05] know this is a pretty good idea that you
[23:07] guys should should do we think it might
[23:10] work or do you think that maybe that
[23:12] he's giving instructions of this is the
[23:16] vision that God
[23:19] has for the family and for the home and
[23:24] for the church for aged women to to make
[23:27] to instruct
[23:29] the young people the young women
[23:33] so where in that does it say
[23:36] go get a career
[23:39] I'm just
[23:40] laying it out there where where is that
[23:43] to make it your vision I'm going to have
[23:46] a career and I'm going to pursue my own
[23:49] uh
[23:51] finances and life and everything
[23:55] is that God's vision
[23:57] is that the vision he's had I would that
[23:59] younger women get an education and get a
[24:02] career that's not what it says I'm not
[24:05] against education
[24:07] I'm not against getting an education I'm
[24:09] not against if you have to unless
[24:11] brother Branham said if you're what if
[24:13] your husband's sick and he can't can't
[24:15] work prop uh well then that's a whole
[24:18] different story but the point being is
[24:21] this is
[24:23] God's vision
[24:24] so if our vision is
[24:27] teaching our young ladies something
[24:30] different than this now understand
[24:33] there there's there's circumstances and
[24:36] situations but what I'm saying is this
[24:39] is the General Vision
[24:41] that Paul is teaching don't be offended
[24:43] by that don't be such a modern American
[24:45] that you're offended by the teaching of
[24:48] the word of God that you feel like gee
[24:50] boy he's going out on a limb I'm
[24:53] expositing to you the Bible
[24:55] if you don't like it you have to repent
[25:00] I'm not telling you weird and crazy
[25:02] things how could this preacher stand up
[25:05] there and say women shouldn't focus on
[25:07] an education and shouldn't okay you can
[25:10] get that but that should be that's a
[25:12] side
[25:14] vision of your life that's not the main
[25:16] direction that God is calling you to be
[25:19] if the word of God means anything to you
[25:25] First Timothy 5 14 I will therefore that
[25:28] the younger women marry
[25:30] bear children guide the house give none
[25:33] occasion to the adversary to speak
[25:35] reproachfully
[25:37] I'm offended
[25:41] I'm offended the the preacher is telling
[25:43] young women to get married and have
[25:45] children and lead the home
[25:48] that's the vision
[25:50] that's the direction that's Paul saying
[25:52] Timothy teach them this if they're going
[25:55] a different direction correct them
[25:59] oops
[26:01] sorry America
[26:03] sorry American Dream
[26:06] you're a false teaching we don't accept
[26:08] you and I I feel that there's a there's
[26:11] a great resentment to what I'm saying
[26:13] right now
[26:16] the question is do we take the word of
[26:19] God as our absolute
[26:21] or do we take culture
[26:24] and well that you don't understand our
[26:26] situation
[26:27] so do we have a culture outside of the
[26:29] word of God
[26:31] do we have a culture outside of the
[26:32] Bible
[26:33] well if we do then throw it in the trash
[26:35] can
[26:36] because we don't have
[26:38] this version of the Bible and that
[26:40] version of the Bible and this version of
[26:42] the Bible we have what Paul taught
[26:44] brother Branham taught what Paul taught
[26:47] I'm trying to point to you what brother
[26:49] Branham and what Paul taught
[26:52] if you don't like it then don't like it
[26:56] but we go by the word of God guide the
[26:58] house
[26:59] it's the word to manage the family
[27:01] Affairs to rule a household so under her
[27:05] husband a wife is to rule and manage the
[27:08] Affairs of the family
[27:10] that's God's Vision she's to be a
[27:13] homemaker we look at Homemaker and we
[27:16] think my goodness you know
[27:18] I'm so discouraged and I feel so
[27:20] terrible all these women have great
[27:22] careers and I'm just a I'm just a
[27:24] homemaker
[27:26] that makes me so angry
[27:28] that Devil he's a liar
[27:31] put them right under your foot and say
[27:32] that's a lie
[27:34] a woman that's a homemaker is the most
[27:37] highly exalted person on Earth
[27:41] that's the gr that's the greatest thing
[27:43] that our nation lost is a real Homemaker
[27:46] that stays at home raises their children
[27:50] feeds their family takes care of them
[27:52] don't think that missing a career
[27:56] is something that you're missing out on
[27:59] you are blessed and your family is
[28:02] blessed and your husband is blessed and
[28:04] your children are blessed why because
[28:05] you're following God's order
[28:07] many times
[28:09] many times you could look at and say oh
[28:11] we've suffered we've had difficulties in
[28:14] Trials because we don't have two incomes
[28:19] yeah
[28:20] you could say that
[28:22] but God is the great provider
[28:25] and you could say well I had many trials
[28:27] because I didn't go to I I uh
[28:31] I didn't go to work on Sundays and
[28:33] Wednesday nights you know I had
[28:35] you're obeying the word of God of course
[28:38] there's going to be trials and
[28:39] resistance and fights and the devil is
[28:42] going to come against you and it's going
[28:43] to be difficult in all of society as we
[28:45] said Satan has molded and shaped to
[28:48] society and a world where a woman at
[28:51] home is almost impossible but With God
[28:54] all things are possible if you put God
[28:56] first and Obey him it's up to him to
[29:00] lead you through and provide for you
[29:02] through every difficulty and trial that
[29:04] ensues because of that but there's so
[29:07] much that goes into this
[29:08] when a woman is at home versus at work
[29:10] when you're at work you're picking up
[29:12] the atmosphere of other people around
[29:14] you
[29:16] and you're picking up that atmosphere
[29:18] and you're bringing that home you say
[29:19] I'm strong I have I have the Holy Spirit
[29:21] okay yes that's true and so do I but I
[29:25] also worked worked full-time at some
[29:28] places where it was I was around
[29:30] Christians in some places where I was
[29:32] definitely not around Christians and the
[29:34] atmosphere was very different and the
[29:36] atmosphere I brought home was very
[29:37] different and you know that very well so
[29:39] a woman
[29:40] her role is to set that atmosphere at
[29:43] the home for the husband for the
[29:46] children the husband is to be a part of
[29:48] that
[29:49] but he's going out and coming back he
[29:51] should come into a place that Sanctified
[29:53] and the Holy Spirit is moving I know
[29:55] there's chaos especially when there's
[29:57] little kids but nevertheless
[29:59] nevertheless inside of that there's
[30:02] still the presence of the Lord
[30:05] surrounding all the chaos of family life
[30:07] that's a beautiful thing
[30:09] and setting that atmosphere if you're
[30:12] out in the workplace and coming home
[30:14] it's not you're not bringing the same
[30:16] atmosphere
[30:17] it's not the same thing
[30:19] and so the atmosphere Amy's going to
[30:22] hate me but when when she was working in
[30:25] the bank before we had children
[30:27] uh she was around all kinds of worldly
[30:30] people and the atmosphere was one thing
[30:33] when she was home with the children and
[30:36] not in that atmosphere anymore it was
[30:38] different
[30:39] it's just very different that's that's
[30:41] my personal testimony I believe that
[30:43] carries on though
[30:45] because there is an atmosphere and that
[30:48] atmosphere is critical and there's so I
[30:50] could go on and on about the importance
[30:53] of a mother in the home talk about the
[30:56] importance for the children the
[30:58] stability that it brings the strength
[31:01] that it brings mom is always there mom
[31:03] is a source of strength and and
[31:07] consistency
[31:09] there for children if Mom's out dad's
[31:12] out who's raising them
[31:15] Grandma and Grandpa okay that's good but
[31:17] it's still not the same
[31:18] it's still not exactly if you have a
[31:21] chance to be at home be at home you say
[31:24] it's impossible remember With God all
[31:27] things are possible
[31:29] obedience to him comes first
[31:34] choosing of a bride brother Branham says
[31:36] I know I'm not much of this modernistic
[31:38] taste of women working when I seen these
[31:40] women with these Uniforms on riding
[31:42] around in the city on motorcycles as
[31:43] police it's a disgrace to any City that
[31:46] will let a woman do that see see as many
[31:49] men that's without work it shows the
[31:50] modern thinking of our city it shows the
[31:53] degrading we don't have to have them
[31:54] women out there like that they ain't got
[31:56] no business out there like that amen
[31:59] that's the absolute truth
[32:02] that's not a position for a woman to be
[32:05] a police officer
[32:06] you all are looking at me like I'm crazy
[32:09] but I'm speaking the truth to you this
[32:11] is what this is what the prophets
[32:14] the prophet that thinks this if if
[32:16] you're a Bible believing Christian you
[32:18] should think it think it no matter what
[32:21] it's absolutely the truth
[32:24] when God gave a man a wife he gave him
[32:26] the best thing he could give him outside
[32:27] of salvation but when when one goes
[32:30] trying to take a man's place then she's
[32:33] about the worst thing that he could get
[32:34] a hold of now that's right
[32:36] now we see the spiritual application I
[32:39] know that's bad you think it's bad but
[32:41] it's the truth we don't care how bad it
[32:42] is we got to face up to the fact that's
[32:45] what the Bible teaches
[32:48] and he was to pass that way brother
[32:51] Branham says she got no business in a
[32:53] defense plant a woman's place is at home
[32:55] with her children
[32:56] and I had went sheet now if her husband
[32:58] is sick and she has to work that's
[32:59] different but Woman's Place is at home
[33:01] in the kitchen and when she leaves that
[33:03] she's out of her place exactly right
[33:08] can you say Amen
[33:12] or you don't you don't like this what
[33:13] what's going on
[33:15] okay it's old-fashioned
[33:18] but we need to go back to the
[33:20] old-fashioned Bible Way
[33:26] I'm just going to finish there
[33:28] let's stand and pray
[33:36] Heavenly Father we come before you now
[33:38] Lord and
[33:40] oh God we see the degradation of our
[33:43] society
[33:44] and even many Christian people wonder
[33:47] what what happened where did we go wrong
[33:50] it's so simple
[33:52] it's it's so obvious
[33:55] where we went on to anyone with
[33:57] spiritual understanding
[33:59] Lord and I
[34:02] though this world this culture these
[34:04] things around us have gone the wrong way
[34:06] we're not required as Christians to go
[34:08] the wrong way
[34:10] the Lord let us
[34:11] shape ourselves and shape what we teach
[34:14] our families and the direction that we
[34:17] give in our families Lord may it be
[34:19] shaped after the word of God
[34:21] and not after this civilization which is
[34:25] of Satan
[34:26] Lord we ask
[34:28] for your holy spirit to guide us Lord
[34:30] and teach us we ask that your Holy
[34:32] Spirit Lord would
[34:34] convict and correct our hearts Lord
[34:36] we commit ourselves and our ways to you
[34:38] we ask in Jesus name amen
[34:41] God bless you
