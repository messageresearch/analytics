[45:54] verse 20
[45:56] 25 ezekiel 36
[46:00] and verse 25 the bible says then i will
[46:03] sprinkle clean water
[46:05] upon you and ye shall be clean from all
[46:08] your
[46:09] filthiness and from all your
[46:13] your idols will i cleanse you a new
[46:16] heart
[46:17] also will i give you and a new spirit
[46:20] will i put within you and i will take
[46:23] away
[46:24] the stony heart out of you
[46:28] out of your flesh and i will give you a
[46:29] heart of flesh
[46:31] and i will put my spirit within you and
[46:34] cause you to walk in my statutes and
[46:38] you shall keep my judgments and do them
[46:42] you notice you can't do that with just a
[46:45] new spirit
[46:47] he said after you get the new spirit
[46:49] he's going to put his spirit in you
[46:51] it's his spirit that allows us to keep
[46:55] his statues
[46:56] amen let's go to second peter chapter
[47:08] one
[47:15] second peter chapter one
[47:20] let's start at verse three the bible
[47:24] says
[47:25] ii peter chapter 1
[47:28] verse 3. it says according as his divine
[47:32] power have given unto us
[47:34] all things that pertain unto life and
[47:38] godliness through the knowledge of him
[47:41] that have called us to glory and virtue
[47:45] whereby are given unto us exceeding and
[47:47] great
[47:48] and precious promises that by these you
[47:51] might
[47:52] be partakers of the divine nature
[47:55] having escaped the corruption
[47:59] that is in the world through lust
[48:02] amen may the lord have a blessing to
[48:03] reading of his word you can have your
[48:06] seats amen tonight by the
[48:10] grace of god i want to use for a subject
[48:12] of nature within you
[48:16] the nature within you
[48:19] and you know you know uh as a christian
[48:22] i i
[48:23] hear that so much you know you see
[48:25] certain things or certain things happen
[48:27] in church and
[48:28] it's a lot of times people say well it's
[48:30] just my nature you know
[48:31] that's just the way i am it's just my
[48:33] nature and you know we we say that kind
[48:35] of casually and
[48:36] you know especially doing service you
[48:38] know and
[48:39] you know the word of god may be coming
[48:41] and you may not be reacting
[48:44] and then you say well that's just my
[48:45] nature
[48:47] think about that would you want the kind
[48:50] of nature that doesn't react to the word
[48:52] of god
[48:54] so you need to get rid of that kind of
[48:56] nature
[48:58] amen and you need the nature of god amen
[49:02] you know when we think about the word
[49:04] nature
[49:05] nature deals with the basic the basic
[49:09] inheriting of characteristics
[49:12] and you know we have been uh called to
[49:15] inherit
[49:16] the nature of god
[49:18] [Music]
[49:20] but there's more to it than what we
[49:22] think
[49:23] there's more to the nature of god than
[49:25] just coming to church
[49:27] or just having enough ability to come to
[49:30] church
[49:30] because anybody can do that that doesn't
[49:32] mean the nature of god lies within you
[49:36] you know so we want to look at we want
[49:38] to look at the nature and the
[49:39] characteristics
[49:41] of things before we get into this
[49:42] thought good you know when i was
[49:44] thinking about a lion hallelujah
[49:46] and how a lion uh when we think about a
[49:50] lion
[49:51] we doesn't we don't think about the lion
[49:54] in his baby stages
[49:56] we always think about the power of the
[49:58] lion the power the roar the strength and
[50:01] the king of beasts
[50:03] we think about all those things but you
[50:05] know when that lion
[50:07] was a little cub it still had the nature
[50:10] of a full-grown lion hallelujah
[50:14] but it had to grow into all those
[50:17] characteristics
[50:18] it was lying there but as it grew
[50:21] hallelujah
[50:22] what it was began to come out amen and
[50:25] it didn't have to
[50:27] make itself be a lion it just was a lion
[50:30] it just is a lion hallelujah in
[50:33] troubled times it's a lion in hot times
[50:37] it's a lion when it's raining outside
[50:39] it's a lion
[50:40] when the sun is up it's a lion where the
[50:43] sun is going down
[50:44] it's a lion when it's being hunted it
[50:47] is a lion it is what it is
[50:51] by nature and nothing can change that
[50:54] hallelujah
[50:55] nothing can change that and you know as
[50:58] i look it i begin to think
[51:00] you know we don't see the different
[51:02] characteristics or
[51:04] the nature of a lion how many of you
[51:06] have ever seen a lion being keep be
[51:08] killed
[51:11] never seen a lion be killed you know i
[51:13] never see a lion die either
[51:15] amen only by the hands
[51:18] of another lion think about that
[51:21] hallelujah
[51:22] the lane is so powerful so strong
[51:25] the only thing that can kill it is one
[51:28] of the same nature
[51:31] and you know when you think about
[51:32] believers and and church and
[51:34] atmospheres hallelujah only you can stop
[51:38] the service
[51:39] from being something great in your own
[51:42] lives
[51:43] you have the power to make this a good
[51:46] powerful service or by your own nature
[51:50] you can jump into your same routine
[51:53] and you can do what you've always done
[51:55] and you'll get the same results like
[51:57] you've always had
[51:59] but to get something greater sometimes
[52:01] you got to do something different
[52:04] sometimes you got to break away from
[52:06] your nature
[52:07] you know like we say we talk about the
[52:09] lion being the king of the beasts hope
[52:11] y'all man i'ma take this off
[52:16] we talk about the lion being the king of
[52:18] the beast is not the fastest cat no
[52:22] he's not the fastest cat hallelujah by
[52:24] nature the cheater he is
[52:26] and you know the cheetah he could he
[52:28] could he could he could he could
[52:30] he could him and a lion can be chasing
[52:33] some prey
[52:34] and he'll outrun that lion every time he
[52:37] might even get there first
[52:39] but he can't stop the lion from taking
[52:40] his prey
[52:43] you know why because by its nature the
[52:46] lion is stronger
[52:47] it may be slower in that moment but that
[52:50] doesn't change what it is
[52:53] in church i want you to realize your
[52:55] trials and tribulation
[52:57] doesn't change who you are
[53:00] if god made you a child of god that's
[53:03] what's in you
[53:05] and normally your trials and your
[53:07] tribulation
[53:08] is trying to bring out the nature of the
[53:10] one
[53:11] that's inside of you and if the holy
[53:13] ghost is inside of you
[53:15] in those times the holy ghost will come
[53:17] out but if the devil
[53:19] is inside of you the nature of the devil
[53:22] will come out
[53:23] you know there's a man named uh kenneth
[53:25] kenneth copeland and there's a story
[53:28] where
[53:29] there was a man working with him he was
[53:31] a painter and you know he told
[53:33] kenneth you know he said man i so
[53:34] appreciate your ministry i just love you
[53:37] and
[53:37] i'm with you to the end you know you're
[53:39] just such a good man and
[53:40] i'm with you to the end and god is good
[53:43] and i'm with you to the end
[53:45] and that man seemed like he was a good
[53:47] christian
[53:48] but you know that same man went up the
[53:51] ladder
[53:51] and he started to fall and on his way
[53:55] down
[53:56] he said everything that didn't reflect
[54:00] what he was telling kenneth
[54:04] everything came out of his mouth showed
[54:06] that he didn't have the nature
[54:08] of a christian inside although he talked
[54:11] a good talk
[54:12] he walked a good walk but when he was
[54:14] put under pressure
[54:15] the real hymn began to come out you know
[54:18] we we
[54:19] look at that lion and we say man the
[54:22] king of the beasts
[54:23] you know when a lion roars just by its
[54:26] nature when it roars you hear that roar
[54:29] for over five
[54:30] miles
[54:33] a tiger's road is just as loud but it's
[54:36] not as loud
[54:38] as a lion why
[54:42] it's it's nature do you all know lions
[54:46] they sleep over 18 hours a day
[54:51] and if they hunt and they get they get
[54:54] really really full
[54:55] they can sleep up to 24 hours
[54:59] and you know you may like some of these
[55:00] crazy people i've been to
[55:02] a lion um jungle thing whatever you call
[55:06] it a safari yeah i said jungle thing
[55:10] i've been to safari and you know
[55:14] as you're going through that safari
[55:16] they're telling you stories of the
[55:18] characteristics
[55:19] of the lion and you know you you ride
[55:23] through
[55:23] and you see the lions just laying down
[55:25] and doing this they're not really really
[55:27] active or doing nothing
[55:29] and you know one day this man and his
[55:31] wife
[55:32] they came and the lions will sleep
[55:35] so he said you know what i'm gonna come
[55:37] back again and the lions will sleep
[55:39] and i believe it's the third time he got
[55:41] so sick of the lions being asleep
[55:44] he got out his car that was completely
[55:48] against what the people told you when
[55:50] you go to the safari
[55:52] they say never leave your car but you
[55:55] know what
[55:55] this man didn't understand the nature of
[55:58] a lion
[56:01] so he got his car you know i believe he
[56:03] was from china somewhere
[56:04] he got out of his car and he thought the
[56:07] lion was asleep
[56:10] and he began to pull out his polaroid or
[56:13] whatever it was
[56:14] and he began to take pictures
[56:18] and that lion which was supposed to be
[56:20] sleep lifted his head
[56:24] and this man is not in the comfort of
[56:26] his car anymore
[56:27] sad to say that man became lion meat
[56:32] because he did not understand the nature
[56:35] of the animal he had stepped to
[56:39] he was in his presence he saw it he even
[56:42] got close to it
[56:43] but he didn't understand the nature of
[56:45] the thing
[56:46] that he was coming in contact with in
[56:48] church i want to say
[56:50] don't play with the devil because you
[56:53] may think uh
[56:54] i can do this and i can do that but that
[56:57] nature
[56:58] will cause you to get destroyed
[57:03] he died and his wife died in the
[57:05] hospital trying to save him
[57:09] so church when you think about the
[57:12] nature of something
[57:13] the nature of it tells what it really is
[57:17] now i say all that to say so i can get
[57:18] into my thoughts
[57:20] i want you to understand the nature of
[57:22] something
[57:23] you know cause we could say uh a man is
[57:26] a man
[57:27] and he's identified by his nature
[57:31] so you have men walking around and they
[57:33] say well you know what i think i'm a
[57:34] woman
[57:36] they have to live a falsified life
[57:39] because his nature is the nature of a
[57:43] man
[57:44] so he has to put on nails and and
[57:46] dresses and
[57:47] and boots and change his hair and do all
[57:50] these things
[57:50] to suppress the nature of what he really
[57:53] is
[57:55] and vice versa and you know they say
[57:58] well
[57:58] i'm born this way yeah you are born a
[58:01] man
[58:03] hell yeah but they have to change
[58:05] themselves because the dna inside
[58:08] will come out of what you really are
[58:11] hallelujah
[58:11] and no matter you can take that lion and
[58:14] you can try to raise him as a pit bull
[58:16] he'll still come out to be a lion
[58:21] you can try to feed it some kimbles and
[58:23] bits it'll still
[58:24] be a lion you can put a chain on it
[58:28] put it in a dog house it'll still be a
[58:31] lion
[58:32] by nature and if you rub it the wrong
[58:35] way
[58:35] it'll roar just like it would if it was
[58:38] in the jungle why
[58:39] because it's a lion
[58:44] we're going somewhere now i'm talking
[58:46] about a lion because i want you to
[58:48] realize
[58:48] you're a child of god hallelujah
[58:52] and your nature hallelujah that's why we
[58:54] must be born again and i don't plan on
[58:56] being alone tonight
[58:57] that's why we must be born again
[59:00] because the nature you were born with
[59:03] doesn't reflect
[59:04] the promise of god
[59:07] being born in flesh came into the world
[59:10] speaking lies
[59:11] that is the wrong nature
[59:14] and if you don't get changed you don't
[59:16] get born again
[59:18] you will reflect the nature of the enemy
[59:22] and you can come to church you can sit
[59:24] here you can sing souls
[59:26] you can clap your hands but without the
[59:28] holy ghost you can only become
[59:30] what that nature is inside of you
[59:34] amen and we've seen people do that for
[59:37] years
[59:38] they come to church they clap their
[59:40] hands and they sing and
[59:42] they do all these things you know what
[59:43] that is that's called a routine
[59:48] but when it really is who you are
[59:51] that doesn't just happen in church
[59:54] i don't know about y'all but i sing in
[59:56] my car
[59:58] i sing in my house i've seen when i'm in
[1:00:00] walmart
[1:00:01] hallelujah why because i got the nature
[1:00:04] of a worshiper
[1:00:07] i got the nature of thanksgiving the
[1:00:10] nature of redemption
[1:00:11] the nature of grace the nature of joy
[1:00:14] the nature of faith all these things i'm
[1:00:17] talking about
[1:00:18] makes up the divine nature of god
[1:00:23] so who's inside of you what kind of
[1:00:26] nature is inside of you
[1:00:28] what's making you say amen tonight
[1:00:34] i mean a friend of mine we was talking
[1:00:36] about this covert 19 stuff
[1:00:41] in church don't be surprised there are
[1:00:44] some people
[1:00:46] who are not coming back to church
[1:00:52] when they made it where you could stream
[1:00:54] stream i'm trying to say the word right
[1:00:56] screen stream there it is thank you
[1:00:59] brother
[1:01:00] stream because it's in their nature
[1:01:06] they're happy to sit home they're happy
[1:01:09] to miss
[1:01:10] church and stay home and all these
[1:01:12] things streaming
[1:01:14] gave them the the right and the ability
[1:01:16] now
[1:01:17] to produce what's really inside of them
[1:01:23] and you may not understand this but you
[1:01:25] take brother jason
[1:01:26] brother matt mead or any other brother
[1:01:29] we'll tell you
[1:01:30] that service is good hello but you know
[1:01:33] that there are some people
[1:01:35] it's hard for them to get back into it
[1:01:37] why because they'd rather stream
[1:01:42] service is tight service is starchy
[1:01:45] for them hallelujah
[1:01:49] you know what i said one time at my
[1:01:50] church i said i said uh
[1:01:53] that we're in revival
[1:01:56] but then i stopped hallelujah i take
[1:01:58] that back there
[1:01:59] is no we i'm in revival
[1:02:02] hallelujah a lot of times we want to try
[1:02:05] to try to make one another
[1:02:07] feel how we feel and then we say we
[1:02:11] i'm we mad at the preacher we mad at us
[1:02:14] only
[1:02:14] we we no you are
[1:02:18] hallelujah so let's take away the we
[1:02:21] and what are you tonight
[1:02:24] what is your nature tonight hallelujah
[1:02:27] now i'm gonna move a little bit quicker
[1:02:28] hallelujah but you know church if we
[1:02:30] could go back to the beginning
[1:02:32] let's look at the nature we should
[1:02:34] really have
[1:02:36] her you know what god created
[1:02:39] everything he said it was good when he
[1:02:42] created man
[1:02:43] he created man in his likeness and his
[1:02:46] image
[1:02:46] so man had the nature of god
[1:02:51] in i want you to catch this where was
[1:02:53] that nature
[1:02:54] that nature was in his spirit hallelujah
[1:02:58] when adam walked around he thought like
[1:03:01] god
[1:03:02] in his spirit holy he walked like god
[1:03:05] where
[1:03:06] in his spirit hallelujah everything he
[1:03:08] saw he saw it through the eyes of god
[1:03:11] in his spirit he had the nature of god
[1:03:18] so much to sow god came and say i want
[1:03:21] you to name creation
[1:03:23] i want you to name this i want you to do
[1:03:24] this i want you to do that he could
[1:03:26] never
[1:03:27] be a god if he didn't have the nature of
[1:03:29] a god
[1:03:30] amen hallelujah
[1:03:33] and you will never be bribed if you
[1:03:36] don't have the nature of bride
[1:03:38] because remember in this climate we're
[1:03:40] in our promises
[1:03:42] holy in this time in this day that the
[1:03:45] bride his wife
[1:03:46] have made herself god had made us
[1:03:52] he laid it all out for us but the words
[1:03:56] say
[1:03:56] his wife have made herself ready
[1:04:00] that's the nature of the bride that's
[1:04:02] the nature of this end time believer
[1:04:04] hallelujah you are doing everything you
[1:04:07] can do
[1:04:08] to make sure you don't get left behind
[1:04:11] now we know it's by grace but god left
[1:04:13] something up for us to do
[1:04:16] yes sir you say brothers why would we
[1:04:18] say that
[1:04:19] because you know we like to say by
[1:04:21] nature
[1:04:24] if they bride they gonna make it
[1:04:28] holy if it's meant to be they gonna make
[1:04:31] it
[1:04:32] well you don't know that
[1:04:36] hallelujah if we just take that thought
[1:04:39] right there alone
[1:04:40] it looks like without a shadow of a
[1:04:43] doubt
[1:04:44] judas should have made it
[1:04:48] because you just look at him on the
[1:04:50] outside and you take the characteristics
[1:04:52] of his nature
[1:04:53] for that time he healed the sick he
[1:04:55] raised the dead he did all the things
[1:04:58] that the other men do holy but then when
[1:05:00] it was time for him to do something
[1:05:02] when it was time for him to press into a
[1:05:05] new life hallelujah
[1:05:07] he rejected it so the real hymn came
[1:05:10] out hallelujah where did that come from
[1:05:12] that came from the fall
[1:05:17] when adam fell already
[1:05:22] bible says we have become partakers of
[1:05:24] his divine
[1:05:25] nature think about that
[1:05:29] that should make you shout
[1:05:32] partakers of the divine nature
[1:05:36] of god
[1:05:41] how can i be a partaker of his divine
[1:05:43] nature without being a part of him
[1:05:48] but we've heard these things so much by
[1:05:51] nature
[1:05:51] it's gotten common to us
[1:05:54] yeah i've heard that i heard that plenty
[1:05:56] of times i heard i heard quotes i heard
[1:05:58] these things
[1:05:59] so much you know what i could preach
[1:06:01] this right here in the nomination
[1:06:03] and they'll jump and shout and turn the
[1:06:05] place upside down
[1:06:07] you know why because they never heard it
[1:06:09] before
[1:06:11] but they believe it
[1:06:15] we believe it and heard it before
[1:06:25] yeah i know that's how your face look
[1:06:26] behind your mask
[1:06:32] what is it about us that we don't even
[1:06:36] react to the word
[1:06:38] what is it about us that the power of
[1:06:41] god the nature of god
[1:06:42] has become common words to us
[1:06:47] i'm about to drop something on you heavy
[1:06:50] if you
[1:06:51] ever experience that level of god it'll
[1:06:54] change your life
[1:06:57] if you ever experience the supernatural
[1:07:00] divine
[1:07:01] nature of god it will change your life
[1:07:04] holy i guarantee you you will come to
[1:07:07] church different
[1:07:08] holy if you ever if you ever receive and
[1:07:11] experience hallelujah
[1:07:13] the unmerited blessings of god you can't
[1:07:16] just be a normal christian
[1:07:21] hallelujah glory
[1:07:27] oh my mama
[1:07:35] listen he said adam
[1:07:39] when adam hallelujah fell into sin
[1:07:44] his spirit got contaminated
[1:07:47] therefore his nature got contaminated
[1:07:51] church he was once walking with god
[1:07:55] he was once in the presence of god
[1:07:58] having communion and fellowship with god
[1:08:01] but when sin came in
[1:08:02] his nature changed so much to that the
[1:08:05] same god came down and he was afraid of
[1:08:08] him
[1:08:09] look god didn't do anything to make him
[1:08:12] afraid
[1:08:13] where did it come from the fallen nature
[1:08:18] if you are afraid to give your life to
[1:08:20] god
[1:08:21] you have a fallen nature
[1:08:25] if you are afraid to fully surrender to
[1:08:28] god
[1:08:29] and come in his presence you are
[1:08:31] operating
[1:08:32] under a fallen nature it's the fallen
[1:08:35] nature
[1:08:36] that makes us run from god is the fallen
[1:08:39] nature
[1:08:40] that makes us hide behind religion
[1:08:49] i'm in the message i go to a message
[1:08:51] church you'd be surprised how many
[1:08:52] people in the message
[1:08:53] but the message ain't in them
[1:08:57] they sitting in truth
[1:09:01] they shout when you shout sing the same
[1:09:03] songs you saying
[1:09:04] but by nature they don't love it
[1:09:08] it's just a routine oh my
[1:09:12] what you look he says
[1:09:16] look at adam's spirit before and after
[1:09:18] the fall
[1:09:19] before he had the nature of god what was
[1:09:22] that nature
[1:09:23] dominion hallelujah multiply subdue the
[1:09:27] earth
[1:09:29] church that's what's restored to us when
[1:09:32] we receive the holy ghost
[1:09:36] dominion subdue and multiply hallelujah
[1:09:39] he was naming creation and speaking to
[1:09:42] it
[1:09:42] but after he saw himself shameful
[1:09:46] he got scared what was he scared of
[1:09:50] he was scared of what he had become
[1:09:57] but who told him that god never told him
[1:10:00] that
[1:10:02] god never told him he was wicked you're
[1:10:04] silly now you diss you that
[1:10:06] nothing as soon as he stepped in god's
[1:10:08] presence
[1:10:10] he knew he was unworthy
[1:10:16] that's one thing about the devil the
[1:10:18] devil will
[1:10:19] will help you to see all of your flaws
[1:10:24] the devil will help you to see
[1:10:26] everything you're not doing right
[1:10:28] you say where's god how can it be god
[1:10:30] when god don't see it
[1:10:33] amen
[1:10:37] hallelujah am i right or wrong the
[1:10:40] prophet of god say
[1:10:41] god don't see your mistakes god don't
[1:10:44] see your flaws
[1:10:45] so who's showing it to us
[1:10:47] [Music]
[1:10:50] the enemy and if you succumb to it
[1:10:53] and you be beginning to believe that is
[1:10:56] what you are
[1:10:57] you will begin to produce the very lies
[1:11:00] that the devil are trying to get you to
[1:11:02] believe
[1:11:05] you say well brother jesus i made a
[1:11:06] mistake let's look at the nature of god
[1:11:09] of a person that makes mistakes
[1:11:13] look remember david tuck bathsheba
[1:11:16] uh uh and did nathan i believe was
[1:11:18] nathan nathan kingdom say david
[1:11:20] you know there's a man who had one sheep
[1:11:22] this other man had hundreds
[1:11:23] and he came and took the one sheep and
[1:11:25] david said where are you at i'm gonna
[1:11:26] kill him
[1:11:29] by nature david was a man
[1:11:33] who stood for what was right
[1:11:36] and in that moment he didn't even know
[1:11:38] he was hating himself
[1:11:41] oh my that's just like the devil he'll
[1:11:44] make you do something
[1:11:45] then come back and turn around and
[1:11:47] accuse you of what you did
[1:11:54] just like judas hallelujah so do you
[1:11:57] realize
[1:11:58] after he gave up the lord after he
[1:12:00] betrayed the lord he felt bad about it
[1:12:08] because any man in his right mind would
[1:12:11] never betray god
[1:12:15] oh my church listen
[1:12:19] from there the enemy what he does is
[1:12:22] hallelujah
[1:12:22] he'll push things in your mind and push
[1:12:24] things for you to think like he thinks
[1:12:26] when god doesn't even see it all he sees
[1:12:30] his blood hardly all he's think about
[1:12:32] this night you say when we sinners
[1:12:34] in god's eyes all he sees is holiness
[1:12:39] all he sees the righteousness of god all
[1:12:42] he sees is his nature
[1:12:46] he's like brother i did wrong last night
[1:12:48] who told you that god
[1:12:54] he's the accuser of the brothering
[1:12:57] but let's look at it with david when
[1:12:59] nathan told david don't get nervous i'm
[1:13:01] about to close
[1:13:05] and if you watch me and it's a little
[1:13:06] too much you take me off pause
[1:13:10] but you know church from there
[1:13:12] hallelujah
[1:13:13] you look at david he he he he realized
[1:13:16] they just say
[1:13:17] david that man is you look at the nature
[1:13:20] of god
[1:13:21] a man that did wrong a man that knew he
[1:13:24] was wrong
[1:13:24] what did he do he instantly repented
[1:13:30] he didn't try to reason with it he
[1:13:31] didn't try to say you know brother
[1:13:33] branham said honey
[1:13:34] brother brandon said that bathsheba knew
[1:13:37] david would come that time and she took
[1:13:40] a bath like that on purpose
[1:13:47] but david didn't david didn't make
[1:13:48] excuses
[1:13:50] david didn't say she knew i was down and
[1:13:51] she tempted me
[1:13:56] the nature of god was i'm wrong lord
[1:13:59] forgive me
[1:14:00] that's right lord created me a clean
[1:14:03] heart
[1:14:05] lord take not that holy spirit for me
[1:14:08] psalms 51 came out of that trouble holy
[1:14:12] son 51 came out of all that sin huh what
[1:14:14] was it
[1:14:16] in times of adversity in times of
[1:14:18] trouble what came out of david
[1:14:20] not more hate what was really inside of
[1:14:24] him began to come out
[1:14:26] think about the church what do you do
[1:14:27] when you're persecuted
[1:14:29] what do you do when you talked about
[1:14:31] hollywood do you look for a scripture
[1:14:33] to seek revenge god
[1:14:36] said he gonna make my enemies my
[1:14:40] footstool
[1:14:48] what do you say like moses said he told
[1:14:51] moses
[1:14:52] hold your peace and let the lord fight
[1:14:54] your battles
[1:14:56] think about it i love talking about
[1:14:57] david because you think about a man like
[1:15:01] david who had all the problems he had
[1:15:03] he reflected more and more of the nature
[1:15:06] of god
[1:15:08] through all of his trials hallelujah
[1:15:10] look he got a man
[1:15:12] trying to kill him for no reason just
[1:15:15] because he's been anointed
[1:15:16] my how often have we tried to kill one
[1:15:19] another
[1:15:20] just because god is using somebody
[1:15:23] we talk about when we see all these
[1:15:25] things and we don't know what's going on
[1:15:27] in their life
[1:15:29] a bunch of javelin through us
[1:15:36] but i'd rather be like david
[1:15:40] than saul a man who experienced
[1:15:43] the same anointing but he couldn't move
[1:15:46] into the nature of it
[1:15:51] that's the difference church a lot of
[1:15:53] people can experience
[1:15:54] the anointing of this end time word but
[1:15:57] they can't move into the nature of it
[1:16:01] you take balaam hallelujah and moses
[1:16:03] hallelujah
[1:16:04] both of them prophets but balaam
[1:16:06] couldn't reflect the nature of god
[1:16:09] like moses could amen
[1:16:15] you take hallelujah vashtine esther
[1:16:18] both of them queens but vast i couldn't
[1:16:20] reflect
[1:16:21] the nature of a queen when esther could
[1:16:26] she was a queen but she couldn't reflect
[1:16:28] the nature of a queen
[1:16:34] y'all getting me with this nature right
[1:16:38] but i want you to see if i can read this
[1:16:45] when the prophet talked about um
[1:16:51] ezekiel 36
[1:16:55] he said let's turn to it right quick
[1:16:59] ezekiel 36.
[1:17:11] verse 26 he says and a new heart
[1:17:14] also will i give you and a new spirit
[1:17:17] he said that new spirit is a new nature
[1:17:24] he said because you need a new spirit so
[1:17:26] that you can even get along with your
[1:17:28] own self
[1:17:31] because y'all knowing that the holy
[1:17:33] ghost or without the right kind of
[1:17:35] spirit
[1:17:36] people get on your nerves and you tell
[1:17:37] them about it
[1:17:39] so god has to bring in a governor
[1:17:41] hallelujah god has to bring in some
[1:17:43] controlling power
[1:17:45] when you're old man let me tell you this
[1:17:47] that old man
[1:17:48] he's still in you way down in you
[1:17:53] don't think for one bit oh i got the
[1:17:55] holy ghost i'm good
[1:17:56] i'll never be able to react like that oh
[1:17:59] no
[1:18:01] oh no hallelujah i was preaching on
[1:18:04] inspiration like i preached here
[1:18:05] and i would say look hallelujah god will
[1:18:08] do things in your life
[1:18:09] to bring up things and swipe it off that
[1:18:11] nobody else knew was in you
[1:18:16] and i probably you know i probably don't
[1:18:19] get no
[1:18:19] cool points or message points for those
[1:18:22] but i use the profit holy
[1:18:24] do we know that the prophet had a lying
[1:18:26] spirit inside of him
[1:18:34] that takes away that that takes away
[1:18:36] your deity spirit
[1:18:40] that takes away your godhead
[1:18:44] that even takes away hallelujah oh my
[1:18:47] this is gonna be just gonna be something
[1:18:48] that look church
[1:18:51] god couldn't use him because he knew
[1:18:55] he'd get in a place where he'd have a
[1:18:57] tendency to tell a lie
[1:19:00] so god allowed his taxes to get backed
[1:19:02] up for years and years and years
[1:19:04] years and years why because he had to
[1:19:06] raise that lying spirit up
[1:19:09] hallelujah nobody knew holy church
[1:19:12] and i want to tell you this with the
[1:19:14] holy ghost
[1:19:15] [Music]
[1:19:17] that spirit was inside of him at the
[1:19:20] same time he had healing lines
[1:19:22] same time he was doing miracles and
[1:19:24] signing wonders
[1:19:26] that little lying spirit was in him
[1:19:31] oh i got your attention i don't know
[1:19:35] they got all our self-righteousness
[1:19:36] going out the window
[1:19:39] if any man reflected the nature of god
[1:19:42] we could say it was that prophet
[1:19:45] all the 10 up million dollar checks and
[1:19:47] doing all that stuff still had a lion
[1:19:49] spirit inside
[1:19:53] but god said no that's not who he really
[1:19:56] is
[1:19:57] so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna put
[1:19:58] him in a position where i can deal with
[1:20:00] that lying spirit hallelujah
[1:20:02] and then he goes and tell him tell him
[1:20:04] i'm not here and then he walks out the
[1:20:05] back joe
[1:20:06] and the immediate has to come and check
[1:20:08] him
[1:20:09] minnie comes and say bill you know that
[1:20:11] wasn't quite right he said what you mean
[1:20:12] you know
[1:20:13] listen he says what you mean i wasn't in
[1:20:16] there right then
[1:20:18] still lying
[1:20:22] trying to justify it
[1:20:25] he was trying to say no i did really lie
[1:20:27] with his wife was telling him
[1:20:28] bill you lied and you know what stopped
[1:20:31] him he
[1:20:32] went off and he went off to his regular
[1:20:33] routine
[1:20:38] he went up to his regular routine you're
[1:20:40] gonna pray for somebody who needed
[1:20:41] prayer
[1:20:42] and he went to lay his hands with that
[1:20:43] person and god said get your hands on
[1:20:45] that person
[1:20:48] get your lying hands off of them
[1:20:55] i ain't badgering the prophet i'm just
[1:20:58] showing
[1:20:59] when the real nature of god is inside of
[1:21:01] you look church
[1:21:03] through a lying spirit hollya
[1:21:07] god used them even mighty amen
[1:21:11] holy when god showed him his mistake
[1:21:12] mistaking his way
[1:21:14] after god dealt with him he said oh lord
[1:21:16] i'm sorry he called the man up
[1:21:18] and he said you know i told a lot
[1:21:19] whatever blah blah blah and the man says
[1:21:21] hey
[1:21:21] bill i always have respect for you now i
[1:21:24] got more respect
[1:21:26] holy the man huh saw the nature of god
[1:21:31] through the prophet getting caught in a
[1:21:32] lie
[1:21:35] wow but we look at one another we'll say
[1:21:38] that was serpenty
[1:21:39] no that was god making his prophet
[1:21:42] perfect
[1:21:44] amen and it's the same thing with us we
[1:21:46] fall down
[1:21:47] hollywood but those things are for our
[1:21:49] good church
[1:21:50] from there you never heard of the
[1:21:52] prophet telling the lie again
[1:21:57] same thing with abraham hallelujah god
[1:22:00] knew
[1:22:01] he told abraham walk before me and be
[1:22:03] thou perfect
[1:22:04] the only way he could have the perfect
[1:22:06] nature of god
[1:22:08] is for god to get all those things that
[1:22:09] don't reflect him
[1:22:11] out of him so god how does he do it
[1:22:14] by walking holly first thing he does he
[1:22:16] walks into a trial
[1:22:18] and abraham says hey you my sister lying
[1:22:24] what is up with the seed of abraham
[1:22:26] everybody just telling lies
[1:22:30] is that what we're supposed to do
[1:22:36] is that how we get abraham faith let's
[1:22:39] lie
[1:22:39] first
[1:22:44] do you realize isaac did the same thing
[1:22:51] and then you come down nowaday prophet
[1:22:54] tells a lie
[1:22:56] but once god dealt with that spirit look
[1:23:00] look somebody was blessed off of the
[1:23:03] purging of god saint
[1:23:07] god making us whole god giving us his
[1:23:09] nature hallelujah
[1:23:11] church look holy god goes to the king
[1:23:13] and say look
[1:23:14] you better get that man back his wife
[1:23:16] and he says
[1:23:17] look he told me that was a sister you
[1:23:19] know the integrity of my heart
[1:23:21] god said that's why i'm keeping you from
[1:23:23] sinning against me
[1:23:25] but if you don't give him back you're as
[1:23:27] good as a dead man and what i want you
[1:23:28] to do
[1:23:29] i want you to go let that liar pray for
[1:23:32] you
[1:23:43] god knew after that abraham would never
[1:23:45] tell another lie
[1:23:50] am i in the book do you ever hear
[1:23:53] abraham lying again
[1:23:56] but it was still in the seat
[1:24:00] because we got to joseph
[1:24:03] remember he told don't tell them what
[1:24:05] kind of work y'all do
[1:24:08] don't tell them y'all hurt us and so
[1:24:10] forth or whatever
[1:24:12] but what this bro what's wrong with this
[1:24:14] bride
[1:24:22] you say brothers why are you going down
[1:24:23] this rock cause some of y'all telling
[1:24:28] lies
[1:24:31] that spirit in here
[1:24:36] but be quick to repent and get it right
[1:24:38] and reflect the nature of god
[1:24:41] because that's the true nature of god
[1:24:44] when you do wrong
[1:24:45] hollywood when you get caught up it's
[1:24:47] god doing it for your benefit hallelujah
[1:24:50] i know one brother hallelujah hey man he
[1:24:53] was
[1:24:54] and mind you when the prophet did this
[1:24:56] he was filled with the holy ghost
[1:24:59] but you know there were things before he
[1:25:01] got filled with the holy ghost that was
[1:25:03] in his nature
[1:25:04] god had to take out hallelujah he had
[1:25:07] premeditated
[1:25:08] murder in his nature
[1:25:12] we didn't read it we didn't heard all
[1:25:14] these stories but i want to zero in on
[1:25:16] it real quick
[1:25:17] you know hurling them boys beat him up
[1:25:20] and you know he went and got a shotgun
[1:25:21] on you
[1:25:22] boy you got to be oh you got have a
[1:25:25] rough spear you're gonna kill somebody
[1:25:26] with shock
[1:25:27] you're gonna shoot somebody with a
[1:25:28] shotgun
[1:25:31] that's somebody who ain't making no joke
[1:25:35] for y'all who brothers who dear hunt
[1:25:37] when you hit that deal with that shotgun
[1:25:39] like
[1:25:41] and the problem's gonna shoot some guys
[1:25:43] with it
[1:25:47] man but you know what
[1:25:50] because god knew one day he was really
[1:25:53] gonna reflect the
[1:25:54] real nature inside of him god just
[1:25:56] brought that up
[1:25:57] and swept it off
[1:26:00] hallelujah when he tried to go through
[1:26:02] it hallelujah
[1:26:04] he had he tried to go through it god
[1:26:07] jammed the gun every time church
[1:26:10] he had a spirit inside of him of suicide
[1:26:16] somebody talked to me all these things
[1:26:19] are recorded out of the prophet's mouth
[1:26:23] he had a spirit of suicide in him that
[1:26:25] was not the nature of god
[1:26:28] so god let all these things arise before
[1:26:31] he started using him
[1:26:33] so these things will never get into him
[1:26:34] again
[1:26:37] took his wife took his daughter he
[1:26:39] wanted to commit suicide
[1:26:42] sure but then church once he got into
[1:26:44] his commission hallelujah
[1:26:46] he'd be lost out of his mind but he
[1:26:48] never thought about killing himself
[1:26:53] he said he'd be in the field walking
[1:26:55] around saying i want to go home i want
[1:26:57] to go home
[1:26:58] now i want to kill myself
[1:27:04] the nature of god
[1:27:08] where was that coming from see church we
[1:27:11] need to look at our life a little bit
[1:27:13] and try to see
[1:27:14] what is god doing
[1:27:20] he says he give you a new spirit a new
[1:27:23] heart put
[1:27:24] he said he says i'll give you a new
[1:27:25] heart also will i give you
[1:27:27] and a new spirit will i put within you
[1:27:30] and i will take away the stony heart out
[1:27:33] of you out of your flesh and i will give
[1:27:35] you a heart
[1:27:36] of flesh and i will put my spirit
[1:27:39] within you see it ain't until we get
[1:27:42] hallelujah

[1:27:47] identifies that the holy ghost is now
[1:27:49] living in you

[1:27:53] do or you will do
[1:27:54] on your own and you know it ain't god
[1:27:58] amen what is it it's that fallen nature
[1:28:04] but the real power is not being able to
[1:28:06] succumb to it
[1:28:10] the problem of god said you can't stop a
[1:28:12] bird from flying over your head but you
[1:28:13] can stop it from building a nest
[1:28:17] you can't stop yourself from having bad
[1:28:19] thoughts but you can stop yourself from
[1:28:20] going through those thoughts
[1:28:24] it's all about a trial it's all about
[1:28:26] growing and so forth he says look
[1:28:28] he said god has put has put us each in a
[1:28:31] body
[1:28:32] to do certain things and i watch every
[1:28:34] little move every objective every motive
[1:28:37] because everything is governed by a
[1:28:40] spirit

[1:28:45] purpose
[1:28:46] there's a spirit behind this church
[1:28:48] certainly spear behind your home
[1:28:51] behind every building behind everything
[1:28:53] is a spirit
[1:28:54] motive and objective hallelujah what's
[1:28:57] your objective for coming to church

[1:29:52] and some of y'all succumbed to it
[1:29:54] you know but there's a rumor running
[1:29:55] around the message you know that's
[1:29:57] that's
[1:29:58] it haven't been out here a good little
[1:29:59] while it's some false doctrine
[1:30:01] you know it hadn't been out here a while
[1:30:02] but you know it's it's a doctrine going
[1:30:05] around
[1:30:06] that only black people shout

[1:31:00] rumor
[1:31:03] if i do that they don't think i'm out of
[1:31:04] character no they might think it's the
[1:31:07] nature of something
[1:31:10] david the one who lied and cheated and
[1:31:12] committed adultery and all these things
[1:31:14] when he saw the ark of the covenant
[1:31:17] coming back what's the nature of joy
[1:31:19] what's the nature of victory it is to
[1:31:22] dance
[1:31:25] ask yourself where was the last time
[1:31:28] your holy ghost
[1:31:31] your holy ghost your divine nature of
[1:31:34] god
[1:31:34] got so stirred up to you stood on your
[1:31:37] feet and shouted amen
[1:31:47] praise god for two nights but that
[1:31:48] should be every night
[1:31:53] every time you wake up you ought to be
[1:31:54] on fire for god
[1:31:56] you have to be thanking the lord holly
[1:31:59] because he didn't have to choose any of
[1:32:01] us
[1:32:01] but he did and against all our faults
[1:32:05] and failures
[1:32:06] god keep coming back giving us grace
[1:32:10] we get caught in live we get caught in
[1:32:12] loose we get caught in that god still
[1:32:14] come back with a hand of grace
[1:32:18] i heard this old this old saint praying
[1:32:20] one time and his prayer was so powerful
[1:32:22] man he was praying and he said lord when
[1:32:25] you come to me
[1:32:26] will you approach me one more time with
[1:32:28] mercy in one hand
[1:32:30] and grace in the other
[1:32:35] wow think about that church
[1:32:39] god has always given us mercy and grace
[1:32:45] and we can't get out of our own way
[1:32:48] no i ain't trying to make everybody be
[1:32:50] like me no
[1:32:52] what we want is the nature of god
[1:32:56] that's what we want we want the nature
[1:32:58] of god
[1:32:59] before i close what do we do you know
[1:33:02] the prophet i'ma give you some stuff at
[1:33:03] the prophet god
[1:33:04] the prophet of god said that this is the
[1:33:06] quietest place we'll ever be
[1:33:10] oh you gonna shout one day you better
[1:33:13] believe it you gonna shout one day
[1:33:15] and you're gonna look crazy
[1:33:19] you might wanna be all sophisticated and
[1:33:21] everything right now and
[1:33:22] you know i got an office job and you
[1:33:24] know and i
[1:33:25] nobody knows me and all that stuff that
[1:33:27] might be all right right now
[1:33:29] but one day you're gonna have to shout
[1:33:33] either gonna be because you made it a
[1:33:34] rapture or it's gonna be because hell's
[1:33:37] fire is burning you
[1:33:40] but one way or the other you go shout
[1:33:43] out and it ain't no matter what color
[1:33:45] the room is
[1:33:47] it ain't gonna be by black lives matter
[1:33:50] all lives matter
[1:33:51] only life they're gonna be madder in
[1:33:53] that moment is yours
[1:34:07] listen i'm i'm i'm trying to close
[1:34:10] because i think y'all got to adjust to
[1:34:11] my thought we're talking about the
[1:34:12] nature of god
[1:34:13] and we can look at let's look at david a
[1:34:15] little bit more you know
[1:34:16] saul was trying to kill him throwing
[1:34:18] javelins at him and all this stuff
[1:34:20] and david was just ducking david wasn't
[1:34:24] even seeking retaliation
[1:34:27] they were just ducking moving out the
[1:34:28] way how many of us we know somebody
[1:34:30] trying to kill us
[1:34:33] we'll keep going around that person
[1:34:38] david kept coming david kept coming
[1:34:40] around i'm not a man trying to kill him
[1:34:45] and david had so much of the nature of
[1:34:47] god
[1:34:48] god let an evil spirit come on saul
[1:34:52] and who drove the spirit off of him
[1:34:56] the nature of david was so compatible
[1:34:59] with god
[1:35:00] that when david played he drove off the
[1:35:02] spirit that god allowed to come
[1:35:08] that's when you got something inside but
[1:35:11] what i want to show you about the nature
[1:35:13] of god
[1:35:14] when you truly got the nature of god
[1:35:16] holy
[1:35:17] what does it produce it produces
[1:35:19] character
[1:35:23] power with characters fit to rule power
[1:35:26] with that character is satanic
[1:35:28] and you look church hallelujah sometimes
[1:35:31] what god will do
[1:35:32] is test your nature so you can see
[1:35:35] who you really are he'll let all the
[1:35:38] people that done you wrong
[1:35:39] all the stuff that got on your nerves
[1:35:41] put it right back in your hand and see
[1:35:43] what you're going to do with it now
[1:35:47] saul walks into the cave he's right in
[1:35:49] david's hands
[1:35:51] david could have followed him
[1:35:57] and david david david was a little angry
[1:36:00] you know david cut his skirt
[1:36:04] and then he repented
[1:36:07] that man just couldn't stop repenting
[1:36:11] every time you turn around david lord
[1:36:12] forgive me lord i'm sorry
[1:36:15] lord i'm just lord lord i ain't mean to
[1:36:17] do it oh lord i know he trying to kill
[1:36:18] me he didn't even say that david he said
[1:36:20] lord he trying to kill me david just
[1:36:21] said lord i'm sorry
[1:36:25] every opportunity he got and the man was
[1:36:27] trying to kill him he put him right back
[1:36:29] in his hands
[1:36:31] son tried to take the kingdom from him
[1:36:34] david said don't kill him please don't
[1:36:35] kill him
[1:36:38] you see the nature of god the nature of
[1:36:41] god doesn't seek out revenge
[1:36:44] the nature of god presses into a
[1:36:46] character that can't be explained
[1:36:49] hallelujah
[1:36:53] as i close listen church
[1:37:02] now when you're reborn
[1:37:06] you don't get a new spirit you get a new
[1:37:08] nature of that spirit
[1:37:10] it's the same spirit but a new nature of
[1:37:14] it hallelujah
[1:37:15] see and i use that to say hallelujah
[1:37:19] to combat the two soul doctrine yeah
[1:37:22] when they talk we got two souls and all
[1:37:24] these things you know adam had a soul
[1:37:26] here
[1:37:26] and then we got born again he got
[1:37:28] another soul uh uh um
[1:37:34] because the soul is the very essence and
[1:37:36] the presence of the man
[1:37:39] and when adam fell god never had to
[1:37:42] recreate another atom
[1:37:45] he didn't have to create another soul
[1:37:47] hallelujah all he had to do
[1:37:49] was take that soul of adam and put it
[1:37:52] back in the right atmosphere
[1:37:54] and it would reflect what it was when it
[1:37:56] was first created
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:37:59] not another soul but a redeemed soul
[1:38:06] so we'll have two we have one glory to
[1:38:09] god
[1:38:10] because he never through the fall he
[1:38:12] never created another man
[1:38:13] can you imagine hallelujah it was
[1:38:16] already a wild
[1:38:17] radical cadre digs and when i got the
[1:38:20] holy ghost
[1:38:20] it's two of us now
[1:38:26] y'all couldn't handle it y'all couldn't
[1:38:29] handle it
[1:38:31] we have two of us one on this side of
[1:38:32] the pulpit and one on this side of the
[1:38:34] puppy
[1:38:35] y'all couldn't handle it
[1:38:39] y'all wouldn't know what to do with it
[1:38:40] y'all couldn't handle it it'll be so
[1:38:42] much annoying again y'all
[1:38:44] masters will be doing this
[1:38:50] y'all know i'm just enjoying jesus right
[1:38:54] in my closing come on musicians when you
[1:38:58] reflect the character of god
[1:39:00] as you're living as you're going through
[1:39:02] you will have
[1:39:03] trial and tribulation but what is it
[1:39:05] doing is god
[1:39:06] purifying that nature
[1:39:10] joseph fought against lying he fought
[1:39:12] against jealousy
[1:39:14] you know like i was saying you you look
[1:39:16] at the jealousy joseph had to fight
[1:39:18] with his brothers
[1:39:21] am i right church let's look at it you
[1:39:24] know
[1:39:25] joseph has a dream he has a dream
[1:39:28] and his brothers get mad because he told
[1:39:31] him y'all gonna bow down
[1:39:33] right he said he has another dream he's
[1:39:35] like mom and dad are gonna bow down with
[1:39:37] y'all
[1:39:38] boy they hot now everybody in the house
[1:39:40] hot everybody mad
[1:39:42] but you know what the turning point was
[1:39:44] this was the tipping point
[1:39:46] see that what the brothers had he had to
[1:39:49] go from
[1:39:50] from jealousy to hatred
[1:39:54] and you know where the hatred came from
[1:39:56] one day i'm gonna take you brothers back
[1:39:58] holly you young guys i'm learning about
[1:40:00] this i'm gonna take your brothers back
[1:40:02] you one day joseph
[1:40:05] received a coat of many colors from his
[1:40:08] daddy
[1:40:09] and i want y'all to imagine what it was
[1:40:11] like
[1:40:13] he got that coat of many colors and he
[1:40:16] put that coat on
[1:40:17] he probably spit around like he was rick
[1:40:20] flair
[1:40:25] [Music]
[1:40:34] dad
[1:40:36] and all these brothers and sisters look
[1:40:38] at that they make me sick
[1:40:47] i knew i'd get y'all loosened up on that
[1:40:49] one
[1:40:54] if you ain't laughing you're probably
[1:40:55] saying it's my nature
[1:40:59] it's my nature to be me it's my nature
[1:41:02] to be mad
[1:41:05] it's my nature to me mug you and
[1:41:06] everybody else is laughing
[1:41:12] but church it went from jealousy to
[1:41:14] hatred because he come out there with a
[1:41:15] big old rick flair robe on
[1:41:18] like he in space mountain
[1:41:21] and he said you know what we're gonna
[1:41:22] throw him in the pit they threw him in
[1:41:24] the pit what was god doing god was
[1:41:25] perfecting his nature
[1:41:27] right he had to come through jealousy
[1:41:29] hallelujah
[1:41:30] then he went down he had to overcome
[1:41:32] slavery didn't get into potiphar's house
[1:41:34] he had to overcome a lust demon
[1:41:36] then from there he went to jail he had
[1:41:38] to overcome a lie
[1:41:39] and bondage oh
[1:41:42] and then one of one of the most hurting
[1:41:44] things hallelujah
[1:41:46] dealing with his nature he had to
[1:41:48] overcome being
[1:41:49] felt and feeling forgotten
[1:41:55] cause all that he did he was still
[1:41:56] forgotten
[1:41:59] but god was working on his nature amen
[1:42:01] in church from there
[1:42:03] joseph he begins to interpret his dreams
[1:42:07] and then
[1:42:07] i believe it was the butler got restored
[1:42:09] and the pharaoh has a dream everybody we
[1:42:12] know the story
[1:42:13] pharaoh has a dream and the butler says
[1:42:14] i remember my mistake
[1:42:16] there's a man in your jail who can
[1:42:18] interpret dreams
[1:42:19] harley so they go get him joseph look at
[1:42:22] joseph got cleaned up
[1:42:23] he got washed up put a robe on him and
[1:42:25] they dressed him up why
[1:42:26] to come into the presence of a king
[1:42:32] and we know the story joseph was
[1:42:33] restored joseph was put in position
[1:42:35] but what i want y'all to see is the
[1:42:37] nature of joseph
[1:42:40] now think about this everybody that ever
[1:42:42] did
[1:42:43] joseph wrong was not in his hands
[1:42:48] everybody from his brothers
[1:42:52] to the caravan that picked him up
[1:42:55] particle and part of his wife
[1:42:57] the the the the the lead jailer in the
[1:43:00] jailhouse
[1:43:03] even the butler forgot about him
[1:43:05] everybody was in his hands now
[1:43:08] but all joseph can say is what y'all
[1:43:10] meant for evil
[1:43:12] god did it to preserve life see that's
[1:43:15] the nature of god
[1:43:17] and i close with the scripture paul said
[1:43:19] for glory i glory in the things i've
[1:43:22] suffered not in my triumphs
[1:43:25] you hear palsy boy i shook off a viper
[1:43:29] i'm annoying it
[1:43:32] i preach all night somebody fell out and
[1:43:34] died and i went down and laid my hands
[1:43:36] on them and they came back
[1:43:37] up i know you hear paul testifying like
[1:43:40] that
[1:43:41] it's not the nature of god to boast
[1:43:43] right
[1:43:46] but he says if i glory i glory in all
[1:43:48] the things i've suffered
[1:43:50] that's the place i want to be
[1:43:53] now you can't fake that and be careful
[1:43:56] about saying amen
[1:43:57] because your trials can start tonight
[1:44:03] that's why we hear people praying about
[1:44:05] oh lord lord please
[1:44:06] give me perfect love we'll be praying
[1:44:08] about perfect faith
[1:44:09] oh lord give me perfect give me perfect
[1:44:11] why won't pray oh lord give your perfect
[1:44:12] love
[1:44:13] cause you got to experience perfect
[1:44:14] hatred
[1:44:16] it's the only way you'll love them get
[1:44:17] perfect if you experience the opposite
[1:44:20] hardly the prophet called the law of
[1:44:21] contrast
[1:44:23] amen so church let's reflect the nature
[1:44:27] of god
[1:44:28] what actions you know tonight i don't
[1:44:30] have to call a prayer line
[1:44:32] i don't have to ask you what's on your
[1:44:34] wall or what kind of movies you watch or
[1:44:36] what's at your house
[1:44:37] you know what you're doing you know
[1:44:40] which nature is dominating you
[1:44:44] you know so i don't have to do all that
[1:44:48] you know it's up to you to get it right
[1:44:51] let's pray let's pray
[1:44:57] let's pray let's buy these
[1:45:01] i love you lord

[1:49:00] good brother diggs appreciate that
[1:49:02] amen the nature and i i just began to
[1:49:05] think i was actually trying to find this
[1:49:07] quote and i think i found that i loved
[1:49:08] it so much
[1:49:10] you know when brother diggs was talking
[1:49:11] about that uh that lion that brother
[1:49:13] branham told her lies that god was just
[1:49:15] trying to get something out of him
[1:49:17] and he said you know bring that out of
[1:49:19] him and i thought of elijah i thought
[1:49:21] you know brother adam said the same
[1:49:23] thing he said elijah
[1:49:24] under the juniper tree and he said and
[1:49:26] there he was one day
[1:49:28] you know elijah just wanted to wanted to
[1:49:30] die much like jonah
[1:49:32] said lord i you took my father's you
[1:49:34] know what about me lord you know
[1:49:36] was so under assault from jezebel and
[1:49:38] brother branham says that there was
[1:49:40] elijah laying underneath the juniper
[1:49:41] tree
[1:49:42] and he said but god had to get his
[1:49:44] servant to that spot
[1:49:45] had to get him into such a low spot to
[1:49:47] where he just didn't value his life at
[1:49:49] all
[1:49:50] and he was so controlled so brother adam
[1:49:52] said what did he do he took him to the
[1:49:54] cave
[1:49:55] and he said and then there came a took
[1:49:57] him to the mountain in that cave and he
[1:49:58] said there came a fire
[1:50:00] and he says the bible says but god
[1:50:02] wasn't in the fire
[1:50:03] and he said then comes a wind and he
[1:50:06] said a great
[1:50:07] rushing mighty wind and he said but god
[1:50:09] wasn't in the wind then an earthquake
[1:50:11] came
[1:50:12] and you know what god was doing god was
[1:50:13] taking him through all those human
[1:50:15] emotions
[1:50:16] the fire you could feel it you could you
[1:50:18] could you could feel the heat the wind
[1:50:20] you could feel it the earthquake you
[1:50:21] could feel it
[1:50:23] and and the bible says but then came a
[1:50:25] still small voice
[1:50:26] and he said god was in that voice and
[1:50:29] brother branham said god was trying to
[1:50:31] get elijah
[1:50:32] past human emotions because he said
[1:50:34] human emotions is what got you
[1:50:36] underneath the juniper tree wanting to
[1:50:38] kill yourself elijah
[1:50:39] and little did brother elijah know it
[1:50:41] just be just a few chapters later he'd
[1:50:43] be raptured
[1:50:45] he'd be out of there he'd take it up in
[1:50:47] a cherry to fire amen and god said i got
[1:50:49] to get you
[1:50:50] past human emotion elijah amen to serve
[1:50:53] me i thought of this quote brother
[1:50:54] branham
[1:50:54] speaks about gold but it existed was
[1:50:57] what i thought about when you were
[1:50:58] preaching there
[1:50:59] and brother branham says i know you've
[1:51:00] heard this many times he said they beat
[1:51:02] the gold until the beater
[1:51:04] seeing his own reflection in the gold
[1:51:06] they beat all the iron pyrite
[1:51:09] the dross the dirt he said they'd beat
[1:51:12] it they'd pound it
[1:51:13] he said till they seen the reflection
[1:51:15] they just keep beating the dirt
[1:51:17] and he says till he till the till that
[1:51:19] goldsmith could see his own reflection
[1:51:21] he said it was like in a mirror beating
[1:51:23] it out now that's what the gospel does
[1:51:25] so many people don't like to be turned
[1:51:28] over and beat out
[1:51:30] well what the church needs tonight is a
[1:51:32] good old-fashioned
[1:51:34] holy ghost beating out amen beating out
[1:51:37] of the world and the things of the world
[1:51:39] that's what pentecost needs that's what
[1:51:41] our movement needs
[1:51:42] is a good old-fashioned gold turning
[1:51:45] beating
[1:51:46] until all the world is beat out of us
[1:51:48] and jesus christ is reflected
[1:51:51] you desire that tonight he says let me
[1:51:54] have just this handful of people here
[1:51:55] tonight fully considered the christ
[1:51:57] their lives dedicated to christ i could
[1:52:00] do more with that handful
[1:52:01] or god can do more rather with this
[1:52:03] handful of people here
[1:52:04] than you could do with the whole world
[1:52:06] council of churches toward the kingdom
[1:52:07] of god
[1:52:08] one man fully surrendered into his hands
[1:52:11] fully that's
[1:52:12] all god needs then he says but you see
[1:52:16] we're not willing to lay still and let
[1:52:18] him beat this side
[1:52:19] that side knock this out knock that out
[1:52:22] knock this idea out knock that idea and
[1:52:25] let jesus christ be reflected of us
[1:52:27] we see too many movies we got too many
[1:52:30] televisions
[1:52:31] we got too many other worldly amusements
[1:52:33] until the church
[1:52:34] has lost its taste to the people
[1:52:38] he says it's because the holy spirit
[1:52:41] moves out and something else moves in
[1:52:43] that's right friends i read that i said
[1:52:45] lord don't let me be named among that
[1:52:47] group let me say lord if you've got to
[1:52:49] beat it out of me
[1:52:50] amen how many could raise their hands
[1:52:51] and say lord no matter what you got to
[1:52:53] do turn me over lord
[1:52:54] amen let your image be reflected amen in
[1:52:57] me brother diggs
