TRANSCRIPT
========================================
they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the Blessed of the Lord and their offspring with them so when we look at this again we spoke before about the Millennium and the new heaven the new Earth the Millennium is not heaven right and so we have to rule with a rod of iron over the Nations so there's a there's a need for that but it is what what is termed as the Regeneration Jesus calls it that so it's it's a regeneration of cultures Nations uh civilizations and the Earth itself it's a process of regeneration leading up to the new heavens and the new Earth and so there's there's a glimpse of Heaven because for us we'll be there with an immortal body right so we'll we'll be there for an immortal body ruling over the Nations am and it's a foretaste but it isn't the final for us it's not full Redemption because there still will be a gathering of those Nations that will come forth and will fight against the camp of the Saints at the end of now Immortal Saints aren't going to be saved and then lost so it's got to be the Nations that we rule over they're the ones that are deceived and that will come against that and then the fire comes the great white Throne comes that and that is when the new Heaven and the and the new Earth is there and Redemption is complete so looking at this verse there's building there's planting in other words there's farming and it says the work there will will not be done for nothing it's not done in vain so in other words purposeless pointless so if you look at if you look at this and you see that there's work I want to point out the scripture that says the gifts and callings are without repentance and OB usually we take that to mean well while we're alive the gifts and callings are without repentance but I believe that that's not what that means I believe it really is God repents when we die we're no longer going to be what we're called to be before no I believe that if God called you to be the only I'll tell you this the only jobs that are going to be people be out of work is chiropractors doctors Physicians assistants nurses Etc anything that's dealing with needing the need for healing because it'll be complete right but outside of that I said I I believe even within that God will have a special uh call and purpose for those people like brother brandham he continues to be a leader when he's over there but he's not praying for the sick anymore right so there there'll be a place and there'll be a position every person you you and we'll look at the scripture not too in depth but a little bit is that there's a reward for each of us and what God made us to be here we'll continue to be that on the other side if you're an artist here you'll be an artist there if you are a teacher of God's word you'll be a teacher of God's word there what's that now yes we will still be learning we won't be infinite we'll never be infinite so there's always the capability for learning there you can never exhaust God you could never exhaust knowing god and even if you even if you were to take it at at some point in all of eternity we were we took it all in you still as a finite person you couldn't take it all in at the same time right you could only grasp this much because if we could take it all in at the same time all of God in at the same time then we're infinite too so there's no possibility of that so we'll still be learning and growing in understanding and revelation of God even in eternity and brother brandom talks about this the the type of person the type of character that you have when you die it's the same type of person and character that you'll have when you come up again a person that's a carpenter that loves to create things over here is going to be a carpenter and love to create things over there you know the rich man in Lazarus were the same men that lived after they died they were still the rich man in Lazar and Lazarus even though Lazarus was now the rich man and the rich man was now the poor man but they were still known by what they were on the earth incredible also if we think about it our resurrected bodies will have resurrected Minds so we'll be able to uh create and we'll be able to do things with our mind that we never could have IM can imagine doing now the things that we long to do and desire to do and can't get to it here there there'll be no hindrance to it I believe that the Lord designed us to do something he designed us with a purpose not merely just to exist not just to sit there and take it all in but to actually be a means of expressing him I me that was his original purpose for creation and every as we look in the in the purpose of redemption the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all so every person is given a spiritual gift to participate in the Plan of Redemption but even further than that we can take that as you God has designed you in a way to express an attribute that he had in himself so that doesn't end in fact this is the negative side of it that's the positive side of it so if you're if you're designed to express something here just imagine what you'll express over there um you know and and it's easy to take that in many carnal directions but I think when you look at it uh we all are desire if you if you have the Holy Ghost inside of you let's put it that way you're Desiring Holiness you're Desiring to be like God and so whatever he's created you and designed you everyone's designed with certain likes and dislikes you see that that and that develops in young in young children as time goes along and you see this one likes this thing this one likes that thing and they go that direction sometimes the devil can hinder a person can put a person in a place I never get to do the thing that I really dream to do maybe that's the case or or maybe you've had to surrender it for whatever responsibility you might have you've surrendered that to the lord well I believe the Lord will take will take that thing and and he will give that to you in its fullness that will bring joy and peace and happiness unlike it ever would here amen Wilbur Smith writes in heaven we will be permitted to finish many of those worthy tasks which we had dreamed to do while on Earth but which neither time nor strength nor ability allowed us to achieve in the beginning man was given the command to take dominion over the Earth and that that never stopped that's continued we're still commanded to take dominion over the Earth but unfortunately it's with the with the influence of Satan over everything with the influence of Satan and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it's overseeing and governing everything so no matter what you create it might it might be a net positive but there's going to always be some negative along with it because of because of we're under the tree of knowledge and we're we're cut off from the Tree of Life we would like to design things for the Tree of Life the only the only thing that comes from the the only source of the tree of life is him not you not me it's him he can operate that through us but we can't on our own human level create something after the tree of life that would cause people to eat from that tree metaphorically and live we can't do that just God creates that just God does that but when the curse is lifted we'll be able to continue this task remember taking Dominion was a prec curse Commandment that was given to us right so when the curse is lifted this the same thing has to take place only it won't be after the tree of knowledge it'll be after the tree of life everything that we will do everything that your hand finds to do and when I say this I'm talking about the creativity the inventiveness the the the all those things that go along with what he made us to be will be bursting forth and bringing forth in life and joy and for the glory of God Amen now it's mixed with you know even our best works that we do even our best sermons that we preach are tainted by our own sinfulness and the best sermon that you hear is Tainted by your own sinful see God through the foolishness of preaching it's not the the the word isn't foolish but the PE the vessels are foolish and weak but God through that still perfects his people which is incredible there will be a perfect society that will be built there will be a perfect civilization right now our civilization is all based on evil um fear racism everything else but there we won't have none of those influences will be there all that will be gone you know think of the new Earth in the same way Noah would have thought about the time after the flood where there's a destruction and we're going into something new is going to be formed on the earth only this time God isn't leaving it up to us like he left it to Noah and his sons what did they do they fell why because the Redeemer hadn't come Satan hadn't been bound up Satan the The Works of the devil hadn't been destroyed so God was showing to us again the futility of us doing it on our own there's no you know it it would be great if America became a Christian Nation again but it still would be under the curse because Satan is the prince of the power of the air doesn't matter how Christian it be it would become Satan is still going to put his way in there look what it did at the very beginning of our founding many good things some bad things but nevertheless is what is the result not it's not positive it's not a good thing that we have right now this is the result that's man that's the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil there's good and there's evil so think about think about this now we're told we only use 10% of our brain capacity so just compreh just imagine having access to 100% of your brain capacity we you can't you've never had it but there you're going to have 100% there'll be there'll be no degradation of your mind of your body so and and don't we think of it in such Heavenly terms well we'll have 100% of our mind and we'll just stand there in a cloud and worship for all time God wants worship for for us to be what he created us to be in total submission and surrender to him that's worship it's not just sitting in a church service there'll be plenty of that in heaven no doubt but the real thing that he wants to see is is us living a life of Kingdom Dominion on the earth uh let's go to the next scripture Jeremiah 31:3 the Lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yay I have loved thee with an Everlasting Love Therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee amen again I will build thee and thou shalt be built oh Virgin of Israel Thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make marry Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria the Planters shall plant and shall eat them as common things there's going to be dancing awesome there's going to be music there's going to be Vineyards there's going to be Farmers what do you do with with Vineyards I'll just leave that there you can make your own interpretation Luke 6:21 blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled blessed are ye that weep now for ye shall laugh amen this is a promise for us you're going to laugh and you're going to be filled filled by God Amen not just spiritually speaking but literally you're going to laugh and you're going to be filled with all good things by God now we weep over sin we weep over loss we weep over pain because of the trials of the life but over there we won't have any of that it'll just be laughter every tear will be wiped away from convinced and concerned brother brandom says now there is somewhere there I was there just as I am here looking back at myself I've had Visions I know what Visions are if that was a vision it was the strangest one I ever had and I seen the people ones that's gone on I seen them there the old was young and they were standing there human beings just like I am only without sin it was beyond Perfection Sublime you you just couldn't mention what it was and when I knew that I had to return back there was one thing that I would return to try to persuade people whatever you do don't miss it don't miss it don't miss it you can't afford to miss it everything else let everything else go but make ready for that see whatever you do amen don't miss we don't want to miss what God has planned for us I mean let's think about the logic let's just talk in logic terms right now right now how much what percentage of time is the next 20 years of your life compared to Eternity what percentage 0% zero so for a moment of doing whatever we want to do seeking pleasure that pleases the flesh we're going to trade that for eternity no way so that's why he says whatever you do don't miss it amen whatever it takes Get Your Heart Right with God make sure that everything is clean and clear in your ready to go there because if you miss it my goodness the pain the suffering and the sorrow you're going to face in torment it's horrible amen amen God is not just going to resurrect our bodies he's actually going to resurrect our works as well let's look at that 1 Corinthians 3:9 for we are are laborers together with God God you are God's husbandry you are God's Building according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another buth thereon but let every man take heed how he builds thereup for other Foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious Stones wood hay stubble so now the foundation is laid you can't lay another Foundation you can't rip it up and relay it it's been laid the word is final and whenever whenever whenever there's a building on top of that you got to return back to the foundation if anything leaves a foundation it's wrong so there people are going to build on top of it and and Paul is saying there's people that are going to build with gold silver precious stones but then there's also people that are going to burn build with wood hay and stubble verse 13 Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is if any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire so what's it speaking of Christians can live in such a way that you you're building you're sending your Works ahead of you you also can live in such a way where you don't you'll have no reward you'll be there which is wonderful but you'll have no reward so we have to take heed how we build and what we build because what we do now is what will be resurrected for us in eternity amen so again if your work abides you receive a reward for the work that you do Matthew 6:19 lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal treasure in Greek means the place in which good and precious things are collected and laid up we usually call that a bank account now we don't have treasure chests some people do but most people have bank accounts um it can also mean a treasury Storehouse repository or magazine verse 20 but lay up up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also so our heart will be where we send our treasure the things that are are well I mean if you really look at a literal sense of the word treasure simply means a form of money that you value the most so wherever you put your money that's where your heart is going to go so we actually can send our treasure into heaven amen how do you do that you don't send wire transfers there's no way to send a wire transfer but of course it's by giving giving of your money giving of your self to the Lord Lord so when we do that it's not merely an act that has no well it has an impact just on the person that receives no it has an impact on you and everyone H I feel like that's skipping I skipped one yeah I didn't put that in the PowerPoint so just blank that out for a minute Philippians 4:17 Paul says not because I desire a gift but I desire fruit that may abound to your account hm interesting so we have an account in heaven you know they have a bank account I don't know the I don't know the numbers yet and I I have no access but it's a trust fund that's there for you that you have access when you die now you you can start a trust fund here and your kids have access when you die but this trust account is one that you can make deposits in and that you actually get access to for all of eternity it it it never Fades away it never gets Rusty it never gets motheaten it continues for all of eternity and accumulation doesn't just stay stagnant at what you put it in there there's actually an interest rate that applies and it's way more than we can imagine Matthew 19:29 and everyone that has forsaken houses or Brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name's sake shall receive a h hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life amen so I want you to think about that for a second does anybody know what percentage rate return 100-fold is anybody have a guess I want to hear somebody guess something 100% nope that's getting closer it's 10,000% so let's back up you can make deposits in your account in heaven right it depends on your attitude it depends on your heart where ever you're wherever you're giving you could give out of obligation that might not end up there but if you're giving as a joyful Giver because you love the Lord with all your heart it's getting added to your bank account in heaven it earns 10,000% and you'll never you'll never lose that uh money that you've deposited there think about that for a second that's real I'm I'm not just making up hyper herbally a joke is it actual money over there no it's your reward you know it's you are faithful over one city rule over 10 cities I that may be that since we rule over the Nations I believe that may be a reality that you'll rule over cities and countries and state there's position of rulership over there and I know it's I know it's very spiritual to say I just don't I don't want to I don't want to do any of that I just want to be with Jesus well Jesus is telling you that you you have a reward that there's an actual reward there's a crown which a crown speaks of what a kingdom a kingship a rulership so there's going to be a rulership and we know that in the in the Millennium we'll be ruling over the Nations but even in the new Earth it speaks about the the the New Jerusalem but it also speaks about the Nations that bring uh their produce and so on and so forth and their wealth into the city so what you're doing now is impacting what you're doing there amen and I'll remind just of a principle that brother brandham has said the people that you think will be there now I'm I'm changing this into reward from being there to rewards but I want you to get the picture is he says the people that you thought for sure will be there may not be there you'll be surp a lot of surprises on the Judgment Day right he says that well I think the same thing goes here we think oh man you know this so and so Minister he did so much and he did this he's going to have this massive reward well he might not it it might be that little brother that was a prayer Warrior that just sat sat there and prayed everybody through to Salvation to the anointing in the service to deliverance and nobody knows anything about what he does except for God Amen and he'll be there sitting right next to the throne so you know we don't God doesn't account it the same way as we know he says be not many Masters because judgment is more strict for you he says greater is condemnation but it really means really speaking of judgment will be more strict for you because if you sin with your words my because you're leading people you're teaching people you're pointing them to Christ and if you're pointing them away even by accident there's going to be a strict judgment there amen so Lord help us let's let's stand Heavenly Father we thank you so much for your goodness and mercy we thank you so much for your word Lord I ask that you'd pray uh that you'd break it down into our hearts Lord that it would be more and more of a reality to us father pray you bless the the the music and the preaching of the word that you'd be glorified in our midst we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you [Music] you [Music] [Music]
