love me amen amen Hallelujah always happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight so just feasting on the word from this weekend I think we all probably are so thankful for the moving of the word and so much was said I could probably just spend all night just going going through it you know one thing that was said that was some a sister was coming to the prayer line just standing in the gap for a loved one brother Andrew said this is the time for the prodigals to come home I'll believe that with all of my heart amen I believe that the Lord is going to use the faith of his bride to bring them home amen so I'd like to take a thought on faith tonight if we could open up in our Bibles Romans the 10th chapter Romans 10 17. we'll start there we have three portions of reading just greet the visitors there and God bless you all I took a thought along the same lines last week when I was ministering away but the Lord kind of had me take a little different avenue with it tonight no matter what our thoughts are just looking for the Lord to be the leader of the service to guide the ship tonight amen I think you know every time I go to minister one of the very first things I pray that the Lord would go into each of your hearts that are going to be here tonight and would discern exactly what you have need of and then lay it on my heart and it's funny because it seems like I never know exactly which way the Lord wants me to go until the day before and you know at first that's really nerve-wracking but now that it's happened just about every time I can have a little bit of a peace about it so hey man let's go to the word Romans 10 17. amen So within Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God we're going to go over into Hebrews 11. Hebrews 11 we're going to read the first six verses Hebrews 11 1-6 it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the world were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered God unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that you should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen so one more reading there in the Book of Genesis all the way back Genesis 32 Genesis 32 and we're going to look at six verses there's 32 22-28 so we'll start at verse 22. and he rose up that night now this is Jacob when he was on his way back to his land he had you know he had that vision from the Lord that you need to go back to your land so he rose up that night and he took his two wives and his woman servants and his 11 sons and passed over the Ford jabbac and he took them and sent them over the brook and he sent over that he had and Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of of his thigh and the hollow of the Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breakth and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men and has prevailed so we see here Jacob fulfilling Hebrews 11 6 rewarded for diligently seeking him no matter what his past looked like no matter what his failures he had he didn't let any of those things hinders faith that night oh my let's just go to the Lord Heavenly Father Lord we just open up your word tonight father we pray that you would have preeminence in the service tonight father Lord I pray that I can just move out of the way I pray that Lord I can just find the mind of Christ Lord I pray that Lord you would anoint the speaker anoint the hears father to hear your word tonight father we're just all here in one mind Lord and one Accord just looking to draw a little bit closer to you father we pray and ask over these things we pray a blessing over the reading of your word Lord I pray that Lord I wouldn't be confined to my notes Lord I pray that you would be the the leader of the service father we ask all these things now in the mighty precious name of Jesus Christ amen I pray the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word just take your seats I'd like by the help of the Lord tonight to minister on faith by hearing faith we know that Prophet teaches us is a sixth sense something that rises above our natural ability to see or to feel or to hear something but it's a belief in something we know Hebrews 11 1 says that faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of Things Not Seen so Faith actually begins with a hope in something but when you have faith it's a step higher and the word evidence by definition is something that furnishes proof so Faith grabs hold of Hope and then makes it a reality so you know we use the five senses and we're going to get a little deeper into that in a minute to hope for something but we can't stay there because faith is a revelation personally to you and Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word so you beginning to Hope in something you begin to speak it words are thought expressed and when you get into the atmosphere of God he begins to express his thoughts to you Philippians 2 says let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus and then those thoughts of God are spoken through his body of Believers and then expressed through their life so the mind of Christ will become in you and then you express the mind of God through that amen it's not the power of positive thinking the prophet of God says it many times the right mental attitude towards every promise of God will bring it to pass so you take a mental conception of the need healing in your body salvation of a family member healing of your mind whatever it is and then you continue in it and because those promises to you are in the word of God it will absolutely manifest and come to pass because God's word cannot fail the prophet says that Revelation is one of the most vital things that you need to pray for not just at one point in your life but every single day and Faith Like I said is a revelation to each one of us personally brother Branham says here in 1960 the unchangeable God he says I can go on record for this tonight if any people will take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise that God ever made and claim it for yours he will bring it to pass if you'll take the right mental attitude towards it knowing that if God said so the promise is yours and it's your personal property the very minute you receive it that way then it has to come to pass for Jesus said the word is a seed that A sower seed sowed and a seed if it's germatized seed it goes into the ground and then the seed under the right conditions of the sun and the moisture will bring forth the life that's in that seed so is the so and so is the word of God he says if a person can take the word and place it in their heart and then give it the right amount of sunshine the right temperature not s-u-n-e says but s-o-n the right temperature of faith in there that seed and promise will live to you just as it did in the beginning to the one that it was given to because it's God's word and he's the same yesterday to today and forever and he cannot fail his word cannot fail so we find those promises in the scripture we we read them and then we anchor it down in US and we live it we just continue in it right just you just have to find the scripture that you need Jehovah Jireh Abraham needed something to sacrifice so he spoke the word to his two servants that God will provide for himself a sacrifice and then he just moved forward and then he manifested exactly what was needed amen so here the prophet of God is saying that when you take the word and then you place it in the in your heart you give it the right sunshine the right temperature it comes alive to you personally because why because God's word can't fail and the more that you dive into the word the more you ask for Revelation the more God's going to reveal to you in your heart and in your life that that promise is actually yours and you are a possessor of that promise amen there is a two-fold purpose of getting in the right temperature it brings forth the life of the seed in you and it bakes out all that stuff that it that doesn't need to be there so increase our faith by laying in the presence of the son brother random says that so many times in this last year of ministry by the year of the by the hearing of the word it adds the right amount of light on the seed in you and it begins to literally furnish proof of whatever desire you have in your heart as long as it lines up with the word amen and even greater than that your desires begin to match his desires because when you get in into that presence and stay there you are abiding Him scripture says that he abides in you so at whatever stage whatever stage of walk that you're in tonight you pray for the revelation of your life and then that second fold of that you you manifest that by hearing the word of God that begins to bake out that old life and that begins to settle something that Revelation because that seed that's placed in you that germanized seed that God placed in you from the before the foundation of the world it begins to grow and that right amount of light is going to grow and then all the weeds that are around that thing that God knows that each one of us have that thing be those things just Begin to Fall away because you're in the right amount of temperature not too much not too little just the right amount of temperature amen faith is a revelation brother random says here Revelation chapter 4 he says now the senses in the body is that right he knows that how many knows that six senses control the body we got a soul after you get through this the census is outside and that's the outer system see taste feel smell here and now in here there's two three four five attributes in the soul now you want to write them down the first one is Imagination the second is conscious the third is memory he says the fourth is reason the fifth is affection now did you get them all he says if you don't then let me let me know you got them all down see taste fuel smell hear the body that's that's the open to the body so the soul is Imagination conscience memory reason affection is the senses or the attributes like the senses of the soul and the soul catch this the soul is the nature of the spirit that's on the inside because the the because the soul only puts out an atmosphere of what's on the inside of you it takes the place of sanctification the soul sets the same category all right there everybody get that down now to this gate there's only one gate that's called self-will you're the boss of what goes in there and what does it do what is this the body must be washed the lab or Sanctified it here filled with the Holy Spirit and this becomes God's judgment seat again where God sits in your heart and if you do something wrong you say oh my I did something wrong see so when your nature is changed and you're filled with the spirit of God you can still do wrong that's in our nature that's just the flesh outer man that we take but the difference is that you get so convicted of it that you're you have that sanctification living on the inside of you so then you say oh God I did something wrong Lord forgive me of it and that's the first thing that you have in your heart Nothing Else Matters until you make that thing right with God because your Nature has literally changed it is a strange thing brother random says looking at the Unseen 1958 says it is strange thing that man who was made in the image and the likeness of God and was called of him to walk by faith believing that God is would choose to walk by sight instead of by faith after his makeup his being all that dwells in him was fashion and likeness of God and God is that great Jehovah who calls those things which were not as though they were and man made to live with God in this manner yet has he chosen to walk by his sight he says he wants to be our own he wants to be his own boss that's just in our nature he wants no one to tell him what to do that's just the nature of man it proved to be thus in the Garden of Eden when he lost his fellowship with God by choosing to go his own way not having rule over him but a man is made like a sheep and a sheep cannot find his way he says I'm told when it's lost it's totally lost and that's the way with man when he's lost he's absolutely helpless he must have a Shepherd to guide him and man when he chooses as the day goes on we find man continually getting worse choosing rather to walk by sight than instead of by Faith by the Unseen and when he does that listen when he does that he robs the inner man which is the soul and that's the Eternal part of man each one of us has an eternal part so you're robbing that Eternal part he says now man shall not live thy bread alone said the Lord but by every word that proceeded out them out of the mouth of God so that part of you that's calling out that you did something wrong that's calling out that you want to live a more holy life that that Eternal part calling out saying come home that your inner man our biggest enemy I hate giving credit to the devil I sure hate it I don't like to give him credit for anything our biggest enemy is not the devil it is not the devil at all it is ourselves I I just hate giving him the credit it's your flesh man that gets in the way so much of the time it's the inner man that's always warring with your carnal nature Paul teaches us about that he says that I do the things that I desperately don't want to do and I don't do the things that my very inner man wants to do and I just said man when he when I read that I'm just like that is me living there right there I I don't do the things that I desperately my inner man desperately wants to do but then those things that I don't want to do that my but my outer man somehow gets control of it those are the things that I end up doing and why is that it's because that nature is living it's still living right right beside you trying to have control of you yeah what happens it's your Fallen nature it's fighting with you even after you're born again of the spirit of God we literally Rob ourselves when we start walking by sight we we walk out of the plan of God and then we find ourselves on the basis of reasoning what happened in Our Minds when we hear the word of God spoken maybe it's incorrection then we don't stay with it we do exactly what Abraham did there with abimelech we start walking by sight we inject our own plan into God's plan because why because of that Fallen nature he told Sarah to lie and say that she was his sister and then when she would then when he's confronted with it he tries to justify his actions and say well you know she really is my sister but she's just my half-sister that I'm that I'm married to don't we always try to justify our actions and try to find a way around whatever we did wrong you know we heard the word preached at the Revival of the Revival meetings this weekend and something deep laid down deep within us is screaming Amen to every word right glory to God that's nothing but the truth but then we leave Monday and then we have the pressures of life and then we're not under that inspiration anymore then we leave and and the conviction that you had your on your heart somehow you know we start to reason it away and what is it it's not it's not that inner man reasoning in a way it's that outer man that outer flesh it's that enemy that's trying to reason that thing away from you whatever conviction that you had whatever thing that you had laid on your heart it's trying to reason it all away whatever Victory you had it's trying to reason it away but you stand on that promise of God whatever you had whatever experience and you stay right with it just like Jacob stayed with it he wrestled with it until he possessed it glory to God what happens the Sun the son was baking that besetting sin out of your life you were in the right amount of temperature and it was it was watering that seed in you you know we start to we start to justify like we're saying it's not necessarily maybe a sinful thing that I'm doing you know there isn't any Scripture that perfectly states that there maybe there's not a direct quote against it yet you had that conviction laid in your heart and what was it that was the Holy Ghost trying to bake that thing out of you he was reminding you of your position if he places conviction on you for something and it may not even seem like anything he knows what he's doing he knows your ends and he knows you're outs he knows your ups and he knows your Downs he knows all about you so he has something he has he has he has an eagle eye view to know that whatever it was maybe isn't affecting you now but later down the road it may be affecting you maybe it won't ever affect you but maybe somebody's watching your life and it'll affect them so we have to be because we're written Epistles red of all men so we have to be Sanctified we have to be cleansed always Washed by the Water of the word amen and you know when the Holy Spirit does convict you you know it's because Jesus loves us more than anything you know when we we correct our kids you know it's to teach them you know my one-year-old she doesn't know better than to run in the street so it's my responsibility to train her not to do that kind of a thing to correct her because why because if I don't correct her when there's no cars in the street and I'm not around one day or you know some something happens and she doesn't know not to run you know we can't really teach her that yet because she's only one but you know when she does to get to that point she'll run out in there and she could die God sees every part of our life he sees exactly what's going to happen at every single turn so he knows that maybe you know five years down the road that little besetting weight or that little seed that you're at that you're not going to squash in your life it becomes it becomes a tree and then that tree grows fruit and then that fruit falls off that tree and then there's more seeds and then there's more seeds and before you know it you don't even realize that now you're in this entire Forest of this besetting sin that was just a seed at one time in your life the Lord is calling us higher than that Saints he has a vision of you as a finished product when he when he came there in Hebrews in the 11th chapter he says Abraham staggered not at the promise of God because he had a vision of the finished product of him he sees the finished product of you it doesn't matter what you what what your past looks like it doesn't matter what sin it was in your life it doesn't matter God sees the finished product of you you come there and Joseph and his brothers and you you look at the story and you think man you know Judah the lion of the tribe of Judah is what the lineage of Jesus came from you know Judah in the Bible was the one who who had the idea let's betray let's betray let's let's let's let's send him off into into slavery you have all these brothers and then years down the road they get in this place in their lives and and they thought that their sin had caught up with him and and their sin they thought it was going to find them and Joseph me and me and my wife were just reading it the other night and Joseph comes there they don't they don't know it's Joseph and they're speaking in their tongue and he As an interpreter so he doesn't they don't know that he knows what they're talking about and he said remember when we sold our brother this is the sin this is what's going to take place and and but what happened was is Joseph at that time was going to extend a hand of Grace in there God is always willing to extend the hand of Grace Joseph is a perfect type of Christ always willing to extend a hand of Grace while we're still here before the Rapture comes there is a there is a hand of Grace in your life that he's extending he's extending that Olive Branch to say come back you know you may be you know uh you know 10 steps in the wrong direction but just take one little step back in the right direction and we're gonna you're gonna find your way back home and then you get you get later on in that scripture in that story and you look at you know what do you think that they went through all those years of that besetting sin and then when it caught up to him and they realized my goodness you know we sold our brother and and they thought he had died and now they come to this point where it was time to go and tell their father what had happened and they get to this point and they realize there there isn't even I couldn't find any scriptures where where they were scared to tell their dad the what had taken place they were scared to say that we that we that we sold our brother into Egypt all they were so excited that their younger brother wasn't going to die they said Joseph is alive and and there was just there was such a miraculous time so whatever happened in your life whatever happened to your past even a besetting thing that you maybe feel ashamed of or whatever the case is God doesn't care about the past because somehow he always takes broken things and he makes them beautiful he always can take the Crooked path he says there and then he makes it straight somehow God I hate to like I said earlier I hate giving the devil credit for everything though God has a plan so before the foundation of the world and this is not to just discredit sin in our lives but before the foundation of the world he knew each mistake he was gonna each mistake that we were going to make so then he crafted a plan that this was going to come out of this mistake somehow some way you he was going to take that mistake and he was gonna make something beautiful out of it I don't know how God is the orchestrator of it all but all he needs all he needs is a surrendered heart to say oh God Lord I'm Lord forgive me of whatever it is that I did Lord get me on that that straight path take away all that crooked things in my life and just get me on that straight path then he takes care of the rest oh he makes the the the the he makes the the gate beautiful again glory to God I am I did a men's breakfast a few months ago and the thought that the Lord had placed on my heart was in the bosom of God you know I took that thought there from John 13 where John was laying there right on the bosom of Jesus right after Jesus prophesies of his betrayal and he starts he starts asking him the question Lord he says Jesus is it I is it I Lord is it I that's that's betraying you my it should always be at the Forefront of our hearts to ask that kind of a question to the Lord is there something in me that's betraying the confidence that you have Lord God is there something is there some maybe besetting thing that maybe maybe it doesn't look like it's that big of a deal or maybe we reasoned it away maybe you know you know maybe we we started comparing ourselves to the world and maybe it didn't look like it was so bad because you know we're way much better way better off looking you know than than the world at this point but we don't compare ourselves to the world saints of God we compare ourselves to the word of God we compare ourselves to what God has ordained for us in our life amen like the prophet said there in in uh that first quote I read paragraph 222 in Revelation chapter chapter four my is is it something late in me that betrays your word is there some hindrance that's keeping me from moving forward in you you know I believe that really truly is everyone's Hearts desires tonight just draw closer to the Lord and to be more like him in every way to change our hearts to change our desires right you know but often time the biggest and I was saying this the biggest and the most exponential thing that you can do for the Lord is actually remove all the hindrances in your own life you know you maybe you want to you you want to speak to that mountain but maybe you have a speck in your life that God needs to get rid of first before you can speak to that mountain God has God has things orchestrated perfectly to make you perfect he she has made herself ready and brother Brandon we're going to get to this quote later but brother Benham will say that she has the materials here on Earth to make herself ready what is those materials it's the word it's the message of the hour to us today to wash Us by a clean word not some kind of formal go to church and we'll just say we went to church and you know that's it it's it's living by every word that God has told us to live by brother random says here in the contest 1962 now the enemy is going to study our strategy with the word Satan studied all that out so perfectly till when he came to Eve the best strategy that he could use with her was that to reason with the word now you never want to reason with God's word you just believe it don't try to explain it don't try to figure it out you cannot figure out God God is the word and it's just made to believe that's our strength is just accept the word and anyone knows that a seed in the right kind of ground will produce its kind so we take the word and then we produce the word Satan's cunning he's deceptive and he studies our strategy with the word just like he did did Eve and that's why we don't take we don't take anything from the word we don't add anything we don't subtract anything we just we do exactly what he said to do we say exactly what he said to say Amen the You Know The Enemy he's always trying to attempt he's always attempting to destroy the word of God in your life he's always trying to belittle your experience he's trying to explain away your healing maybe you had a victory this weekend in those Revival Services maybe something happened but he's trying to take that away from you you keep that Victory you take it because it really is your Victory amen he'll reason it away somehow but our job isn't to figure out something it's not to it's not to carve out some kind of our own plan like Abraham did it's just to take him at his word and just to strive forward with it the Lord might Place conviction but then we reason it away Paul says there we have a scripture for that Paul says there all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient so whatever it is maybe he placed on your heart it's actually him answering your prayer because when we we pray the Lord Lord I want to draw closer to you his answer back well maybe that thing in your life isn't it's not technically unlawful but it's really it's not expedient to your walk it's it's it's kind of going to become a besetting thing you know it's it's really it's hindering your walk with me and so I kind of want you to get rid of it and the Lord is a gentleman so he's just going to place it and then we have to with our own self-will we have to accept that and we have to move forward into it amen oh and just John just laying there on the bosoms asking is it I Lord is there anything late in me all those disciples is there anything in me look at the approach just such reverence such respect you know they weren't sure who was going to be the one that said you know it was going to be betrayed them but their hearts went out for him amen they had such a care and such a love form they didn't they didn't want it to be them their hearts their desires was with God is that your desire tonight is your heart is your desire to say is there something in me that betrays you Lord is there something in me that shouldn't be there is there something in me that trespasses your confidence I'll make it right Lord whatever it takes because I value your word I value everything that you had to say oftentimes I think we can even trespass his confidence without even fully realizing it if we can begin in the state of humility and actually seek after correction until there's nothing left to correct Lord is there something in me that Grieves your Holy Spirit anything Unholy Ephesians 4 says grieve not the Holy Spirit by which we're sealed by until the day of redemption and that's the attitude we can keep and the approach we can take that's where he wants to take us such a place of confidence in his word brother Branham says they're in perfect Faith he says when we are sinners alienated without God in the world in that muck of mud as I talked about this morning God came to us God sought you you never sought God no man can come to me except the father draws him first and God came down to me in that muck what you were and sought you and then he brought you out of it that ought to create a perfect love he says look what you was now look what you are hallelujah what did that something that loves you somebody that loves you can't you have faith in what he promised you then a real genuine love will create a confidence in his word Hallelujah he caught me when I was nothing and I'm still nothing he says but now I'm in his hand Hallelujah he caught me he loved me when I was unlovable he loved you when you was unlovable but he changed you just like that colored sister said that time in her testimony she said I'm not what I ought to be I'm not what I want to be but man I'm sure not what I used to be man I'm so glad for that he says if God when I was an alien loved me so much till he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence now listen here that gives me confidence that he wants to use me that gives me confidence that he wants to use each one of us here tonight he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in you he's seen something in you he says he had a reason to save you look at the people that's unsaved today look at the millions he could have took beside you but he took you he took you amen and no one can take your place it says it says you are in God's he says you're in God's economy no one can do it that's his love to you you are in God's economy what a promise of the word no matter what the situation or you know the circumstance he says it's governed by the love that creates faith so that love of God's word creates Faith because Faith cometh by hearing and when you hear the word of God then he can bake out those things and then bring that seed to life amen that quote is just so encouraging for me he's he's seen something in you and you know when we realize that he's seen something in you to overcome in the last days he's seen something that you are going to overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of your testimony and when we realize that it should give us such a determination to get so hidden in Christ Jesus not to say it or not to just you know preach it but to really live it amen means come into a place in our lives and Jesus where Jesus he's really is truly first and foremost in every Avenue a place where we have such confidence in his word that his Commandments and following everything he said do means more to you than anything a place where this message the message of the hour means more to you than anything because it's a word through a prophet given given to us to perfect us because God in his infinite wisdom and mercy gave us a word to take us home and then he placed you here in this day because he had confidence that you were going to overcome by the word by the blood of the lamb and by the word of your testimony glory to God In His Infinite Wisdom I heard a brother say attempt by the Tim Dottie said this at a at the men's meeting a couple years ago he says you know we try to quantify God you know we Abraham sat there you know in 25 years you know and if and this clock he used if you look at a clock on a his a year a thousand years is like a year for the Lord or is like a day for the Lord I think so he says if you look at a clock that really only took God six minutes to do that thing in Abraham's life we try to quantify the things in our life because all we are we're simple we're human beings and we have our trials we Face our tests we have these things that we go through and we try to quantify things but God is an infinite God he doesn't have quantity like we do he has everything he knows everything he is everything so if we place our faith in that and have a substance of that it will furnish the proof in your life and it will come by hearing hearing of the word except lifting that word in your life and then moving forward in that word amen you you hear quotes you you hear the word being preached like this weekend and you know it's the opposite of what the world would say it's it's not popular what was preached this weekend but something deep down in me just says amen it just makes me want to shout something deep down just says hallelujah what is that that's the right temperature getting on that seed in your life saying Amen to every word of God hallelujah Hallelujah what a what a humble heart it has to take to ask that question Lord is it I and then really mean it you know because he's always faithful and he's always going to do what what he says he's going to do and just answer your prayer you know my son my yes my son yes my daughter here it is you know you're living this way you're doing this thing yet I've called you to higher places than that to deeper depths now listen we all mess up none of us here tonight or across the internet waves are are immune from mistakes we all make mistakes even after we're born again of the spirit of God all he wants us to become is more humble and have confidence in his word and then he can take the testimony of whatever he brought you from and he can shake the gates of hell with it glory to God he can add the right amount of water from the word and cause to it cause that seed to grow just a little bit more speaking on faith tonight see he's got confidence in US whatever it is how hard it may be how ridiculous it sounds he wants us to have such confidence in him that he knows best you know and that's living a truly surrendered life in Christ and you know when a preacher says that to live a surrendered life it's not a cliche term it's not a far-reaching impossibility it's as simple as putting yourself in the presence of the son and then obeying every part of the word of God and then moving forward that's as simple as a full surrender is you you say Amen to the word and then you apply it to your life and then Faith by hearing will then grow that seed it'll bake away all those things that don't need to be there and then you'll grow into your Perfection one day that's all it takes Hallelujah it's gonna happen when you fall but I just want to encourage you tonight don't stay down stand up and keep on walking subject your mind to feed on the things of the word feed those senses with the right thing because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God you stay right with that that presence when you pray or when you get praise or when you get into that atmosphere brother Benham says it says it brings you into a different atmosphere that brings all your flaws to the surface it brings you to repentance and then when you are empty or you make the choice with your free will to break away from that or break away from a besetting sin in your life then he can put more light on that seed because maybe there's just there's 75 percent that he can get but there's still a little bit that he needs he needs to get full light on that seed he wants all of it gone he wants to break us from our own will Prophet God said there at the quote in the beginning there's only one gate and that's called self-will because he gave us free moral agency to choose we have to subject ourselves to that actual surrender so he can have first place his will is always first and foremost amen he knows best I love this quote perseverance brother bam says you've had things to happen you just knew it was going to be you didn't know what it was going to be but it was going to be that's Faith that's real Faith it's going to happen then when you when you know that it's going to be now Faith finds a source that others don't see wow his word is a sword the Bible said so in Hebrews 4 12 that it is a sword and it takes an arm of Faith to yield to wield that sword only Faith Can Do It hold that sword now brother Brandon here he's about to make a reference into that story in there in Matthew referring to the woman who had the demon-possessed child where she was a gentile she came to Jesus and um Matthew um she came out and she worshiped him crying said Lord help me but he said it is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table then Jesus answered sending to her o woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that hour that was a scripture and the prophet says she had many hindrances this little woman she had a daughter that was having epilepsy she was very very bad she had heard that Jesus healed epilepsy and he says now Faith cometh by hearing and that was her child so she was determined to get down somewhere and to hear Jesus now she had many hindrances just many hindrances but her faith didn't have no hindrances tonight people has a lot of hindrances he says your mind has a lot of hindrances but your faith there is nothing that can stand in its way because Faith knows no hindrances amen and this woman heard that there was something that could be done for her sick daughter demon-possessed the scripture says she wasn't going to let that little discouragement get in her way she had the right mental attitude towards the word she accepted what he said she humbered herself in his presence and then her faith was not stopped She had a determination to stay with it because there was a life on the line there are lives on the line in your life there are lives on the line in your life that are counting on you to stick with the word think about that friends there are there are people in your life that are counting on you to stick with the word because your faith is going to be what brings them into their change your faith because God works through his body so he places that Faith within us so then that takes all of the credit away from us but he uses his body here on Earth to manifest things so your testimony of what you do where you go how you act is going to prove to other people that this can be done here in the last age this can be done so you stay right with that word and you just keep moving forward know how no matter how hard it is or no money and how how much reasoning comes into play you stay right with the word because people are counting on us people are counting on you and your testimony to lead them into what God needs them to be because God will use you he's just waiting for a willing vessel to use God will use whatever willing vessel is willing to lay down their own will and then allow his will to be what is first place in their life glory god you see the Lord orchestrates things something sometimes just so beautifully to allow you to go through a certain circumstance just so that you have come to a place of unwavering faith and unwavering perseverance because Faith knows no hindrances so he drives you to a place where he can activate that faith that he put in you so then that just takes that takes me out of the picture praise God all I got to do is lift my hands and say blessed be the name of the Lord glory to God he drives you to a place that he can activate it glory to God let it be known and established in your hearts that when you pray the prayer of faith and you desire to draw closer to him his way of doing that will of doing that thing is divine and it's perfect and he knows what's best and sometimes that Divine will is a trial sometimes maybe he wants to take you through something so other people can see that you that this can be done maybe it's a testimony whatever the case is it could be a trial and if the devil if the devil never attacked us that would give me some red flags in my life that maybe maybe I'm just living a carnal life because the devil is not really worried about me the devil's not I want to be on the devil's radar I don't care what he uh what I have to go through for that I want to be on the devil's radar to know that my life is gonna crush his soul oh and he doesn't have a soul he's gonna crush his head one day glory to God Victory Day 1963 when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of God has found you and you found favor with God and God believes that you'll stand the test glory to God I'm going to read that one more time when you have a trial or test it shows the grace of God has found you you found favor with God and God believes that you'll stand that test Hallelujah how secure can you be when the seas are troubled when they're when they're not troubled just don't make a bit of difference he says as long as you know that he's laying right there what difference does it make let come whatever let come let go what may whatever it doesn't make a bit of difference says bless the Lord doctor says you're going to die with cancer just say glory to God quick trip home maybe you see they don't mind talking a group of doctors he said I read your book He's brother Ben I'm telling the story you know he he was talking to this group of doctors and he read his book on Divine Healing brother random says I guess he criticized it huh he said no sir I actually admit that you're right I said well thank you Dr Schoen he said he said brother Benham we have a record that when we tell a person that's got a malignancy or something that's going to kill him and also ready to burst or tubercular it depends on what attitude that they take if they get all tore up said they die right away but said if they take that attitude well dying is just part of living it's all right when I die said you know it almost retards the case it almost just negates the case he says I just thought if that mental I just brother Brown says if I just thought of that mental attitude taken like that what will it do when the Holy Spirit strikes that inner man glory to God he says certainly that's right if you can move into a spot into one of the one of the best surgeons and doctors there in the Southland he says if Mr Branham I can be proved a man if a man will move can move into a spot until even his own mind don't even know what he's got to think that he's got it and don't even pay attention to it said it wouldn't do it if he can't believe it that's true listen the right mental attitude towards it will bring now the mind won't do it now listen the mind isn't going to do it but if you give that man that attitude towards something that has got life in it oh then that life comes down and that life does it Hallelujah not your mental attitude oh that only brings you into the presence of him then he does it that's what you do your mind the five senses is all right as long as they don't deny God but when they go to denying God then you leave them alone God controls them that's the Creator glory to God it's not your mental attitude that's gonna do it it can start with that mental attitude but that just brings you into the presence of God and then he's the one that's going to do it glory to God thank you oh praise the name of the Lord he says in the God of this evil age is this all right tonight friends Hallelujah he says in the God of this evil age but inside of that spirit is a soul and it's controlled by one thing that's your free will you can accept what the devil says or you can accept What God Says and that determines what spirit is in there if it's the spirit of God it'll feed on the things of God and it won't feed on anything um this is just my comment can we say it together anything anything it won't feed on anything of the world Hallelujah Jesus said if you love the world or the things of the world it's because the love of God has not even entered into this inner part of you Satan has deceived you and man shall not live by bread alone but by every word out of the mouth of God building to something here but it's controlled by your free will amen the devil is always going to try to complicate things he's going to try to reason things down say well you know expect the best but prepare for the worst that's not Faith that's human reasoning that's the Devil's reasoning Faith finds a source that others don't see hallelujah how do you get there how do you find that Source by hearing the word of God by feeding your five senses with something that will feed that spiritual Sixth Sense and it'll depress play you go to church you do those things and then it takes you and it activates your faith that's laid within you it presents that that seed and it starts to grow and it starts to bake out those things and then it manifests the word in your life it will literally manifest the word in your life Hallelujah we start honoring God in every Avenue of our everyday life don't let God be in most places don't let him be in you know some of the rooms in your heart let him have everything Hallelujah let him be the savior of your life and the Lord of your life submit it to him brother random says here referring in the church age book referring to Ephesians 3 16. now according to these verses when a man experiences the depth of God in his life it is an actual personal experience of the spirit of God indwelling him and his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and the knowledge of God through the word but the depth of Satan will always be in that he will attempt to destroy this he will always attempt to make a substitute for the reality of God how will he do that he will take away the knowledge of the truth of God destroy the word by put putting forth his own word and brother Branham says in here in quotes yea hath God said Remember When brother Jason brought that out there in Genesis where the serpent deceived Eve in Genesis because he took away the lordship of God it started with Lord God and then the serpent took away one word added a little reasoning added a little discouragement added a little worldliness to something just enough to where it actually looked all right because it's still God it looked all right it appeared as if nothing was wrong but it was Satan destroying the word of God in her life it was Satan trying to take away your Victory it was Satan trying to discourage you from living right it was Satan trying to attempting to destroy the depth of God in our lives my goodness he will he is going and he will always try his very best to do that that's why we take this message that's that the lord gave us and we say Amen to every word hallelujah the enemy is attempting to destroy the life the the word of God in your life he'll try to do those things he'll try to take away your healing by reasoning out those things just like he'll try to have you justify your actions just like he did Abraham well what I'm doing isn't wrong or maybe there's no scripture against it yet you stand there convicted in your heart of that thing he's trying to steal away your victory the devil does not care if you have a mental understanding of Jesus or who Jesus is or take some worldly view of accepting him he fears the life behind the name there's a certain amount of overcoming that we're taught in the scripture to possess he that overcometh so there is something that we do have to do on our end and brother brother Jason shared this quote with the brothers one day and he says now there's going to be a bride there's going to be a wedding supper served in the skies here in the marriage of the Lamb 1962 paragraph 53 it says Thou just as sure to be as God is because it's his word and we know that those things are going to make up that bride is going to be his church and they're going to appear with him before him without spot or wrinkle they have listen they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready the message Hallelujah the holy spirit amen if you notice she has made herself ready so so many says if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me or drinking or gambling or lying or stealing I'll serve him but that's up to you see you got something too they that overcome shall end hear it all things she has made herself ready you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down see you see God could not push us through a little pipe pull us out the other end and then say blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got decisions for yourself I have to make decisions for myself in doing that that's how brother Branham says we show our faith and respect to God oh my our respects to God thanks be to God it shows me that the lord loves me when I'm going through something that's contrary to what you would think it would be but it shows me that I that the lord loves me because he places something in my life that he wants that he wants to show his word to me he let us glory in those trials he says they're so precious to me so when he blesses me with a trial oh my it's really hard to look at a trial like that sometimes but it gives us an opportunity to show our respects to God hallelujah we do have something to do on our end how do we overcome is it just some giant fancy words or maybe maybe I could compile the list of all the the best quotes and then you just start saying those quotes over and over and over again and then you just hope that it happens no we have we have a we start with that mental conception and then we have faith by hearing and by hearing of the word of God we plant that we know that seed's already been planted so then we allow it to grow in our lives and then it manifests the word in your life it's not some great hope that hopefully nothing bad is ever going to happen he overcame it by how how did Jesus overcome Satan in the scriptures he overcame it by the word it is written hallelujah what else is written I am the Lord that healeth all by the diseases that will keep Isaiah 26 3 a perfect peace Jehovah Jireh I'm your provider all of these things are your promises in the Bible that manifest to you when you hear the word of God you apply it to your life and then you move forward in it Hallelujah perfect peace is a place that knowing that I've already overcome it because he's living in me and in Revelation 1 17 and 18 he already overcame hell and death and the grave and he has the keys to it Hallelujah glory to God in me you might have peace I have overcome the world he says hallelujah you overcome by the blood of the Lamb that's already been shed and then by the word of your testimony Hallelujah even if every appointment you go to the doctor seemed like they think that it's getting just getting worse and worse and they want you to just keep coming back and back it does not matter because the word of my testimony is that it is already done that little baby is already healed and I'm standing on that promise that's all there is to it Hallelujah don't fret little child we walk by faith not by sight and Faith finds a source that others don't see oh my this quote has meant so much to me lately brother Dania may have even quoted it here remember when God counted you worthy to have a test don't fail to get this when you have a test or a trial it shows the grace of God has found you and God believes that you're going to stay in that test Hallelujah he did the very same thing by job Hallelujah God says he's in your hands but you don't take his life see God had confidence in job I mean then oh my precious wife she sent me this text last night and it just it meant so much to me oh she said she was driving home we had a doctor's appointment on Monday and most of you know the situation and you know we stand on faith but it does not mean that the discouragements don't come the discouragements are going to come the Mind battles are going to come right that happens and she said she was driving home from her parents from my parents and she was just really feeling down and discouraged and she was listening to Victory Day and she sent me this oh it means so much when when it looks like everything is God gone God is giving you a trial he's got confidence in you he doesn't have to baby you around you're not a hotbed plant a hybrid you're a real Christian Hallelujah God is giving you a test to see what you'll do about it amen no Matt no wonder Peter said these fiery trials why we counted as Joy it's more precious than gold how many times we him and all well well what if that or what if something gave you to overcome he just knows he put his trust in you Hallelujah he put his trust in you glory to God Faith cometh by hearing he placed you as a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ so you know when the doctor tells me that my unborn child has a hole in her heart tests positive for a condition that's going to kill her I stand as an overcomer and it's just the Lord saying you watch this I put my confidence in my children what about the Mind battles that come with it what about the playing thoughts they're gonna happen it doesn't matter he's got my word that's all he needs brother brother Donnie did that wonderful demonstration of just thinking about what's standing over the banisher of time he's got my word and he's going to stand on it you just watch devil you just watch whatever you're going through in your life you just stand on it because God's got this he's going to take control of whatever situation whatever mind battle whatever victory that you did have maybe this weekend or maybe maybe even tonight whatever victory that you have you have got that Victory it is already yours you already possess it you just keep moving forward in it you believe it you hear the word of God you put your faith in that and then you stand with it Hallelujah glory to God my Victory Day go listen to Victory Day when you get a chance Hallelujah my Victory Day is God's confidence in US glory to God when you come in when the when the Devil comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord will rise a standard against him no weapon formed against me shall prosper glory to God that's our Victory Day Saints grab a hold of it keep with it he says here it seems like the Christian Life if the fellow is not absolutely centered on Christ now that's the most important thing you got to be absolutely centered on Christ it seems like he holds so many disappointments but but those disappointments are God's Divine will happening for us so now it don't even seem like it would be that but it's God's way of doing things he lets us hit the river to see what we'll do Oh Glory to God when you hit the river what courage that ought to be for a sick person what courage that ought to be for a backslider he says to stay in the line of duty to turn yourself around to start back to start back it's God business to open up the Red Seas it's God's business you just speak and you move forward that's all you have to do glory god you stay in the line of duty Faith cometh by hearing God lets disappointments happen to show victory oh if we could only see that you see these things that seem so blurring so blurring to you and upsetting you their trials are things that stand still Focus your glasses on the word of God speak the word and move forward that's all there is to do it glory to God how do you have how do you grab hold of that determined Faith how do you how do you possess it Caleb you're talking about Victory and you're talking about faith and cometh by hearing and then faith is a substance how do you how do you take that thing and you grab hold of it brother remember says in the main thing Jacob he had dreams and visions and so forth but this is one time he could lay his hand on something and say that this is God and he was able to hold on to it onto it until the blessing comes oh if we could just do that we could find a spot where where we could see God whether it's in his word whatever it is recognize it's God and hold on to it until the blessing comes you wrestle it out with God God promised to do it God said if we'd seek we'd find ask it will be given knock it'll open every word is true when Jacob got a hold of something that he could look at to hold with his hands when he seen that it was God he would not turn it loose oh if Christians said in the unchangeable god 1960 oh if Christian Jim could do that lay your hold is something that's real catch a vision of God and see his presence hold on to it until God answers black back and that blessing what a Revival would break out here in Tulsa he said what a Revival would break out here in Bethel Tabernacle if we could take hold of that promise you hold on to it you stick with it no matter what form he comes in we have our ideas but God has a way of sending things to us and answering our prayers every time you remember there in Daniel 10 with Daniel Prayed and the vision broke forth he says Daniel I heard you from the very first day that you began praying 21 days ago but I had to battle with the Enemy to come and make my way here but rest assured everything is going to be okay everything is in control oh rest little bride it's all in control I've got it all I've already overcome it just rest just just stay right with the word just stay right with your faith just just keep hearing my word just keep saying Amen to all of it you just stay with it whatever it is whatever situation whatever it does not matter whatever he decides for my life he's Sovereign so he's going to decide it because he's Sovereign he knows best so I'm just going to accept it and move forward for it amen rest assured little bride he's working on his end Daniel was so weakened in that prayer and that can happen it happens to all of us we can sometimes feel so weak maybe so weak in our faith or so down or discouraged or mind battles or we don't have Victory or we got this or we got that amen amen but the hand of the Lord touches him and gives him strength from his to travail the Lord knows exactly what you need when you need it amen glory to God sounds so contrary you know maybe just tonight if you just all Saul stands to our feet tonight so many things about the scripture may sound so contrary to reasoning and even even just talking with a co-worker today about faith and she had this comment and I I told her you know Faith you know is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of thought not Things Not Seen evidence is something that furnish proof and then my and then she kind of piped up and she said oh and the the proof isn't furnished yet I said yeah the proof is furnished it's in the word that he healeth all my diseases so that's my that's my furnace proof that it's already done and she just said well that's kind of a backwards way of looking at it I said well yeah I guess it is but that's what the word says to do amen you stay with that maybe tonight you needed a little bit of encouragement you know you need you he knew you needed to hear his word to put the right amount of light or sunshine on your faith and bring it forth amen we started there we opened up with with Jacob just play with with whatever's on your heart actually let's let's uh what's that song I wanted to sing let me look at this song huh I give my mind I give my mind completely to you Lord you know that one when Jacob stands there Jacob's battle came you know he had the blessing of his father he experienced the supernatural many times in his life he came face to face with angels He had Visions he dreamed dreams then even leading up to his experience you see Jacob on this road faced with fear to see his brother after all these years because he knew that Esau had made that declaration to kill him and that's why Jacob was sent away and the Lord sends in that dream go back into the land of thy Kindred so we he had the message from the Lord go back into that land we have the message from the Lord amen we have that message he had his mission go back into that land we have our mission take God at his word we move forward with it then on his way scripture says that the angels of God met Jacob even after all that just a few verses later he was still a friend verse 7 and chapter 32 of Genesis says he was greatly afraid and distressed then in that fear he tries to come up with its own plan Saints tonight when when you do stand at that very Point Jacob did you have the word of the Lord I promise you every single time that fear and doubt they'll try their best to overcome you they'll explain away that Victory they'll they'll place a thought of that but let let those thoughts be fuel to the fire of the Holy Ghost that's in you let those thoughts be fire and fuel that if those thoughts are happening if those things are are trying to to get you to doubt something then something is real something is Something Is Anchored In You amen Jacob said and I Jacob said I'm I'm not even worthy of the least of thy mercies oh that's that's me I'm not even worse worthy of the least of thy mercies or all thy truth he says but he says deliver me I think every believer tonight can raise their hands and say identify with that I'm not even worthy of the least of thy mercies and thy truth that truth of the message you've given us I'm not even worthy of it Lord oh but Deliver Me Lord hallelujah glory to God we have these words we have the promises yet circumstances arise and we forget who we are and I'm here tonight to remind you of who you are I'm here tonight to remind you of your position it's all part of his divine plan finally Jacob gets so sick of himself and his fears and his mess-ups and his cowardly Behavior he finds himself alone with God no wife no son no daughter no distraction and he started wrestling it out and then this is where he says God he sees God face to face like the scripture says brother Branham says it beautifully there he walks differently after that but from that time he was a then in the in the first verse of the next chapter Jacob lifted up

tonight any testimonies any testimonies um during this trip the first time we landed at for our layover in Dallas Love Airport and I had had less than two and a half hours of sleep in 24 hours and I had drank some awful hot chocolate on the plane because I wanted to drink something warm and soothing but I didn't want to drink coffee and keep myself awake if I could go to sleep and then when we got to the airport I ate some junk food and all of a sudden I just I mean my brain was Jello I was getting body aches and my stomach is just churning and churning and churning and didn't want to accept even water um and then all of a sudden in front of hundreds of people my son Milo started praying for me and 30 minutes later it was like nothing had ever happened amen so the innocent faith of a child that hasn't been corrupted yet by the world you know that's the kind of faith that he wants us to have amen and um and then the other thing that happened I think I came in contact with somebody who had something uh right when I got here um and I started feeling it like the next day in my throat and I thought oh well it's just my sinuses because I always have sinus issues and the burning drainage and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse and by the time I got home got back that night I had full-on fever um chills body aches just awful and um to preface this you know the devil was trying so hard to stop me from getting to those services this weekend I mean everything was going wrong and just like brother Andrew Glover said you know your spirit and your flesh are ready to give up but something on the inside of the soul is you know and God was kind of quiet through all of it and I'm like Lord what's going on is this you know is this trip not your will what's what's happening and I thought no that can't be it you know why would the Lord want to stop me from hearing the word you know I've got to get there our plan plane leaves at 5 40. service starts at seven gotta get there and even you just uh feeling um tired on this drive there thinking well you know and then Milo falls asleep in the car and nobody's feeling great and I'm thinking well maybe we'll just skip this one service and it'll be okay and I and then I said no I am not doing it I am getting there because it was like the devil wanted me to be in a position where I couldn't even stream the services not even hear it because he knew that Saturday service I was going to get exactly what I needed to fight against what he had been doing to me in my mind for several weeks just non-stop just the doubt oh it really it's you can't be one of them do you remember what you did do you remember how bad you were I don't think so you know that kind of thing but I got exactly what I needed I'm free amen I have Liberty and I am living the Jubilee and you can't do anything about it and I'm not gonna do anything to offend my Lord amen and so the joy that came with hearing the word and that Blessed assurance that the Lord was with me and he wanted me to hear that and I passed it was like I don't know if that was a test but whatever it was I passed and I got there and I got what I needed and when I was um thinking about giving this testimony last night in the middle of the night I promise you this happened I thought Lord how am I going to explain this that would help other people because I have faith for lots of things in life but faith for my own healing has been an issue like I can pray for somebody else's healing and I have all the faith but for my own it's like again the devil gets in there and but okay I'm so when I was sick I prayed and the prayer was different because I had that Joy of that Blessed assurance and I fell asleep between 11 30 and 12 and at 2 25 I woke up and I was like oh my goodness my symptoms are gone um and I I mean I was healed and when I was thinking about how can I give this testimony and help somebody else who's having the same issue that exact scripture came to me which was um faith comes by hearing amen the devil did not want me to get there and get that Faith from hearing and it happened anyway thank you amen anybody else have a testimony tonight [Applause] this is something that kind of happened a while ago but I was telling it to someone the other night and I was like this is you know pretty cool so I'm going to share it but um I was driving home from work and I realized that I was out of gas I had like no gas and I was kind of on kind of a back roads and there are no gas stations and it was like broke at the time so I was like God put it on my heart to just start praying I was like Lord I'm broke there's like no gas stations I have no way to get gas so I sat there and watched the gas meter dial thing literally like go up wow thank God literally filled my tank up with gas in that moment so I thought that I would share that [Applause] probably have time for one more anybody have anybody have another one yeah uh this is uh kind of it might not mean a lot to a lot of people but it meant a lot to me um the other day I was driving down the road and the U-joint my truck blew up and um that's not a good thing and uh I I remember talking to brother Micah because he had just basically third pulled his truck back to working and I made a joke on on Sunday night when we went to the um to the yawns of the man you got another one of those I could really use one but uh anyways I I was thinking about it like man Lord I really need this what had happened is that when the the reason the U-joint failed is I'd had it repaired previously and the guys who had repaired it who put the new U-joint in it for me um had damaged it and then when they repaired it the repair failed and so it just blew all the U-joint up and it was a I was gonna have to get a new drive shaft is with the long and short of it was and um I was thinking like well I could try to repair this and even if the Lord fixed that part because in my mind I was like man if the Lord could just fix that part I could get new U-joints and I thought well even if you did that I was still gonna have to pay a bunch of money to get all the U-joints put in it and new bearings and stuff and um so I was like well I'm just gonna I'm just gonna order a new drive shaft and and move on well I'd ordered a drive shaft and then something said hey you need to double check because the the year that you ordered that for is wrong and I I got it a year off and so I canceled the order and when I got home and double checked it I had ordered the right one like well that's weird and when I went online to the to the online uh parts catalog a new listing popped up for a refurbished drive shaft that's exactly the same drive shaft that I had with all the bearings and everything put in it and the cost of it was exactly what the cost of having my old drive shaft get new bearings and stuff put in it so it ended up being exactly as if God had fixed my original drive shaft and it just meant a lot to me because it was it was uh I I you know it's it saved me a lot of money and I can get my truck fixed and it it I don't know it just meant a lot to me and the Lord kind of answered my prayer and get me to getting me my my truck fixed amen [Applause] I've seen that like seeing that whatever you have on your heart bro [Music] let's just sing one line [Music] [Applause] [Music] he is so good to
