Amen brother Josh is in the house Hallelujah [Music] amen happy to hear that brass blowing like that praise the Lord I'm going to invite you to First Kings this evening God bless you preach In The Name Of The Lord amen happy to be here in the house of God Amen told sister Debbie today in the afternoon I said man I'm so glad tonight is church and I said uh she said you're preaching I said yeah I said but I'm just going to be glad to be at church I know it doesn't matter who's preaching I'm just going to be glad to be at church I was glad when they said unto me let's go to the house of the Lord amen I I love church I love coming I love being around the people love hearing good preaching amen love singing and worship and praise and the feeling that we have of love one for another and a grand my my first Kings chapter 2 and I hope by the help of the Lord to carry on with my main title on the spirit of lawlessness this will be part three however I would very much like you to bear in mind tonight that I'm taking a subtitle are you ready for this an ordinary man all right praise the Lord let's read second Kings chapter one I I'm sorry um Second Kings chapter I'm sorry excuse me gentlemen First Kings chapter two I think that's what I sent you if it's not that's what we're reading First Kings chapter 2 and verses one through four praise God now the days of David grunai that he should die and he charged Solomon his son saying I go the way of all the Earth be thou strong therefore and show thyself a man and keep the charge of the Lord thy God to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his Commandments and his judgments and his testimonies as it is written in the law of Moses that thou mayest Prosper so there's going to be a benefit of it see that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and withersoever thou turneth thyself so you remember Sunday we were talking about the the principle of compound interest and we were making a spiritual connection you know that if if you start going the way of carnality the compounding interest of carnality will pile up and pile up and pile up and pile up until finally you know one it it it becomes one thing that's not so bad the next thing you know it's sin the next thing you know it's death I could have went there in the New Testament tonight but I'm I decided to start right here on David's deathbed sermon to his son Solomon but in in perfect Contra distinction if you start sowing the word of God in your life that has a compounding interest that will multiply exponentially and here's a beautiful beautiful part you want a good deal it'll multiply itself you don't really have to do anything just start eating on it and it'll start multiplying itself in your life and that's that's really what David is trying to get Solomon he's given Solomon long-range advice see and he's not really he's not you know he's not even touching on the on on things like you know Solomon you know be careful of this enemy and be careful of that enemy and you have to watch out for this in the government watch out for this in politics and here let me give you a lesson I've learned about this in battle and all this David doesn't feel the need on his deathbed to say any of that his only advice Solomon hears all I need you to know keep God's word follow his statutes and he will make sure you prosper as you go along the way and whatever happens don't worry about it because you just keep sowing to the word of God Amen and it's going to compound itself uh and I'm going to tell you something friends say why is that so so much on your heart because that's what we have been doing since 1963 when about five or six hundred people sat on Penn Street in Jeffersonville and heard a prophet with the opening of the seals the most Monumental thing since the days that Jesus and the disciples had walked the Earth the thing the church had waited on for 20 centuries and there's five or six hundred people in a little church that used to be a duck pond a mud just a swamp really and and here we are tonight and it's went around the world and it's found God's children and you're it and we're rejoicing say why are we still here because it's still compounding what what's it going to produce something good amen praise the Lord let's pray father we thank you for your word tonight thank you for this people gathered out in the midweek I'm so glad to be here with them Lord now we commit this to you right readily father we want you just to take it over lord and have your perfect will in your perfect way set human vessel aside Lord may you may you get glory in everything that's said in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated for I start preaching forget to seat you that's happened before not to me but I know I get a friend of mine who's a preacher and he got to preaching before he set the people down and he's kept going and the next thing you know he'd preached two hours and never set the people down and they respected him so much they just stood it definitely weren't in the South amen amen praise the Lord how many are happy to figure out that at the end of it all when you've done all that's been asked of you you're you're able just to say I was the Lord's unprofitable servant I tell you some friends I I ended with that Sunday and I thought to myself I need to make everybody go back in the church oh I I want to preach a whole sermon the Lord's unprofitable sermon servant because it sounds it sounds like oh man that's too bad unprofitable servant no it's fantastic it's wonderful because it means that all the pressures off of me Jesus Paid It All and all I can do is give my whole self to him and whatever he can use out of it I'll get full credit on the other side not a beautiful thing friends you know as because it you realize as I began to realize that I was always going to be that that I was always going to be that I was never going to be able to do anything and neither was I asked to to think about this you're not even asked to repay the debt Jesus Paid For You he's never even asked you to repay that you couldn't pay it anyway but you've never even been asked to repay that you've only been asked by the Lord to say he's knocking at your heart saying if any man will open I'll come in and then when he comes in he'll start bringing blessings and food and spiritual food in due season thanks sir and and I will sup with him and he with me how many would like to have a meal with the Lord wow and the beauty of it is in the Holy Ghost as we've we've quoted so many times in the in the Bible that you know there the promise of the Holy Ghost in the New Testament one of the great benefits would be that no one's going to have to you know cross the ocean and bring him bring him to us you know in in Jerusalem they had to Journey they had to go to this place they had to go to this place they had to go to this place when the Holy Ghost come he's going to be 90 even in thy mouth you're not going to have to go up to heaven and convince him to come down or cross a sea and bring him back you're not going to have to jump through rings of fire all you have to do is say father and right there that fast that close he's right there on the spot and that is the beauty of the Holy Ghost so we find then when David is coming and he is instructing Solomon it just it's it's moving to me I you know I I can relate to I can relate to Solomon as he's standing here hearing his father giving him these words you know and I mean it's you know and I and I got to experience a little taste of that standing the last time I got to stand at the bedside of my father and he was he was still at right at 80 years old just as sure of this gospel as he's ever been and he's he's admonishing me to press on and everything's gonna be all right it doesn't even matter how this is it's going to be all right and you know what he wasn't wrong it's all right amen and I am I am enjoying the fact that that even on his deathbed he held that confidence and here David is is is so sure of it that he's saying to Solomon you know here's the charge I want to give you Solomon verse two I go the way of all the Earth so now in this sense David is an ordinary man and I guess we all are Ordinary People we're born we live we die and no one's ever escaped it the only people who who that won't ever have to happen to we can look back at Enoch in the Old Testament as a type of a global bride we which are alive and remain I'm glad it says alive and remain because I'm not just alive I'm remaining Hallelujah when the trumpet of God sounds brother Bradham says it like this he says it doesn't matter what happens to this body he says if they if it goes to the Flames if it's eaten by lions if it my ashes are scattered to the Four Winds of the Earth the trumpet will sound and he'll know it's me oh I'll hear that trumpet and I'll come forth and all those elements will come back and nothing can stop it and so so we find that that as or you know this is I suppose that this is what connects all Humanity is that we are all born and we're aging toward an end and the only and that's what made Jesus so unique as brother Branham said there there had been many great men and moreover there had been many great men who died for a great cause he says but there had never been a man who could lay his own life down no one could take it from him he surrendered it and then that same person not a different person that same person could pick himself raise his self back up from the grave again that had never been happened had never happened Adam tried that Adam Adam stepped into sin to save Eve the problem of the first Adam was when he stepped into sin he got hung himself and he couldn't get back out but when the second Adam stepped in he stepped back out and then pulled his family out with him Hallelujah do you feel the pool tonight I've been pulled from certain death and now it's so certain I can never die it doesn't even matter what becomes of this body the trumpet will sound and he'll know it's me see and I'll raise as we were saying Sunday I'll come up with the same character I go down with that's why Resurrection morning holds no fear for me because I understand that principle that that if I die in the next minutes I'll come back up with the same love for God that I have right now I'll have the same Faith burning in my heart so it so then it really doesn't matter so then I'm really not an ordinary man I'm something more hahaha brother Branham says in possessing the enemy's Gates this is a this is just burned on my heart ever since brother Matt Smith talked about these Gates and it's just such a beautiful thought that he brought there and I just thought man I'm never going to let Satan you know they tried to shut Samson in that wasn't going to work my was it brother Caleb just talking about that recently brother Branham says possessing the enemy's Gates whatever you desire ask in my name and it shall be given you he's paraphrasing Christ in the scriptures a little while now watch out brother Ram says this a little while and the world now you already know the end will not see me but you'll see me but brother Brandon's gonna stick a little a little description in here a little while and the world the not seed the unregenerated seed see everybody has a seed of life nobody can god holds this Mystery of Life he's the only one who can give life so everybody everybody really is alive just like I was preaching and and I preached it here before and I've preached it uh in other places around the world how that man was made in the image of God and therefore that's what a man is is a man living after the image of his maker and I've said and I say that to young men especially how that manhood is not a gender it's an office you might be a male that doesn't mean you are ever will be a man because manhood be it speaks character and integrity and honesty and decency and morality man because he's made in the image of God that's a man see and so that's why brother Randall would say I've seen men six foot you know men 200 pounds and they didn't have even one ounce of man in them right so so this is the beauty of what the word of God does it makes it makes you know and that's why it says God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living soul as we've showed you in the Hebrew it means he became praying dirt he's built out of the dirt he's building in the animal kingdom as the highest order but he's the only one of all that Animal Kingdom that turns and prays no other animals do that so so now he's at a higher order he's building the image of God and as he's as he's living in the image of God this is what makes him uh really this is what makes him a human say If he if he's if he doesn't what makes him live according to the word of God the Holy Ghost what's that the life of God where's it at in you living through you well so if you don't have that are you not a human well Peter said you're a brute Beast so yeah I suppose you're Homo Sapien you're you're above the chimpanzee I get it I I understand that but you're still just in the Beast order you've not become because the human was a living Soul he he had breathed into him the breath of life and he became in the image of God's light and sin he now when sin comes that is marred brother Branham said sin come in and Mart his picture but here's the Catch You Came anyway but you were lost so then God comes in the sinful in the uh like sinful man he comes down in Christ and takes all the sin upon himself and he who knew no sin became sin and God judged him that's what a prophet said God judged him as a sinner and sent him to hell so you and I would never have to go that's the gospel say what's the gospel good news that God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son to take the penalty of sin and death and be sent to hell so you and I would never have to go so if a man goes to hell he sends himself there because he simply refused the provision that God made for him not to have to do that hell wasn't even built for humans it was built for the devil and his angels but the Bible says because it had to take in humans now hell the Bible says Hell hath enlarged itself see and so so we realized that this whole time now when we're when we're coming down to say well are you uh are you an ordinary human well I am in one sense an ordinary human I'm kin to all the human race I was born the exact same way that all humans are born if the Lord tarries I my life will end the same way as David said I go the way of all the Earth but we realize that when when God began to break the word to us in the end time we found out that the thinking in the ages had just always made it seem like that men would just whoever could make the choice to serve God then then then then then they became a son of God but we found out once the seals were open and all the mystery in the Mighty God was unveiled now wait a minute we found out it's it's it's more than that that it it's actually Jesus said concerning his family you having actually chosen me I've chosen you and you were chosen in me before the foundation of the world and you didn't become a son at an altar you only found out you had always been and by the Holy Ghost you're now cooperating in the vision no wonder I want to serve God no wonder I like coming to church because this body is being brought subject to the vision that's why that's how Jesus said for us to pray that as it is in heaven so let it be in the Earth see because that's first remember he said to Moses make the Tabernacle when you build this Tabernacle make sure you build it exactly like the one you saw in heaven don't deviate not even one ringlet different and you say man that's a lot of pressure on Moses well it's not because prophets brother random explain that that a prophet has an ability that when he sees a vision he can see it again forever it's like permanently photographed in his brain and and and so when he saw it in heaven there was no doubt he could reproduce it in the earth and then not only that God even gave him Blueprints and the blueprints made sense to the image that he had when he was there oh I'm so glad God has somebody called a prophet Hallelujah because this is an hour of such uncertainty we needed a sure voice so he says here whatever you desire asking my name and it shall be given to you a little while in the world the not seed the unregenerated seed so now he's not saying they're not human they don't have a seed of life simply he goes and he breaks the analogy he breaks down the analogy to say look a hen can lay an egg but if that if the hen has not been with the rooster and the egg's not fertilized it'll never hatch into a chick see and so it's one thing to have the seed of life it's another thing to have a germ of eternal life that is placed in you the day you were born because you say why was it placed to me the day I was born because that's the day you started out in time in the Earth as a human but you had always been in the mind of God and what happened is is that followed you here you understand it wasn't like God came down and did a micro surgery and said if they could get a strong enough microscope they could find it somewhere down it's not that kind of a seed it's what I once followed me here because I'm just extended into this time Hallelujah no wonder Jesus could say I come from God I go back to God rich in Mercy gives the whole world a legit opportunity to save themselves see it's it's a legitimate chance he gave it to everybody he'd be unjust to not but when it comes to this elect lady as John would call her it's all it's a whole different set of rules it's a whole different plan it's a whole different section in The Book of Life brother M used that word section it's the lamb section it's a it's a section of election see and so so we find out then that that that it's a it's all those names are in there and and when they get to the judgment really there's only one question that has to be answered is my name still there has it been blotted out say what about the bride she does she doesn't come to that Judgment at all she's Seated on the throne with Christ see because all her sins done went ahead of her and were met in Jesus see so when she gets there she's already been judged she's not going to suffer Double Jeopardy she's already been judged in Christ how did that happen because she allowed this to dominate her life and and this made her not ordinary this made her extraordinary are we shorting the word to extraordinary the bridge shorten it even more to extraordinary extraordinary it means you're extraordinary that you know you're not you're not you're not and and why is that because what look at what brother Brown said concerning when he's talking about the humanity of Jesus and he goes back to Solomon and he says just like Solomon was the son of David so David's in the fatherhood Solomon's in the sonship and and so he says that's the way Jesus was he says accept Solomon was just a man see he's a mere man he says but Jesus was a man plus I love that a man plus see he won and then he comes right behind he says he was the god man that's what made him the Prototype that's why he's a brand new type of human he's the beginning of the creation of God and there's a whole Kingdom coming behind it who are the continuation of that same creation say what kind of creation was it a spoken word say well well when do I get it you already got it if you're born again a Cycle's already started we got a Rapture in cycle shout voice trumpet why should you think that your your translation is any different it comes into your soul it makes you and your Soul's already in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus this body this mind this this this this it's still stuck here but it doesn't even matter this body could lay down and die today but the trumpet will sound a trumpet six thousand years you talk about compound interest this trumpet has been compounding interest for six thousand years ready to blow yeah it's gonna bring all the dead of all the New Testament era he's going to bring them all up say that's going to be one more trumpet this thing's got compounding in again since then see don't you worry it'll get you home this message has already put you on the road and it's already from glory to glory he's changing me I find then that I'm I'm an ordinary man yet I'm not ordinary I'm a seed that was fertilized with life before the foundation of the heavens and the Earth before the heavens and the Earth were even formed I've been quickened by the Holy Ghost therefore I the real me Am Alive forevermore so I thought Jesus said that he said it so you can say it behold I live forevermore you ought to just let the devil hear that come off your lips you're going to just raise up those hands and say because he lives I live forevermore because of that day on Calvary I live forevermore I I'm immune from prosecution I'm not subject to the devil anymore he can't force me to do anything I have power I've been given power over scorpions and serpents and over all the power of the enemy Hedonism refers to a family of theories all of which have and there's a number of them not going to bore you with the psychology of it all that because they all have uh one really they all have in common that pleasure plays a central role in them so they have psychological or motivational Hedonism they have um wow some of these words would even be hard for me to pronounce and so they have an ethical normative and ethical Hedonism and and they have a axiological Hedonism and and and it just the the the it goes on and on and on it goes where it stops nobody knows and so they even have a folk Hedonism oh boy but but really it's a it's a philosophical position in generally speaking in that happiness is is pursued and accomplished in this theory of thinking if this is how you think that happiness is the pursuit of pleasure and the running away from pain so so that's how they measure happiness that becomes the pursuit in fact is of everything they do think and say of everything they plan and dream and stage and and posture for and and they raise their kids to try to think like that that you you should you here's here's a great philosophy of Life Chase pleasure and avoid pain at all costs avoid anything negative and just Chase fun and you would be you'd be shocked at how pervasive that theory is especially among the intellectual Elite who disdained the idea that character only comes from suffering see that this was this was Dr Spock you know back in the 60s and 70s when he started you know changing the culture and you know don't don't discipline your children with whippings anymore you know don't don't use a corporal punishment and I forget the wording he used uh uh I thought of it today and but I I don't think of it often but it was it was all it was all it was it was all about denial and reward rather than rather than punishment and correction it's all about denial just deny them something don't actually whip them just deny them and then if they if they don't act bad then throw all kinds of gifts on them and it literally in the course of just a few decades ruined an entire generation and how did how did he get to that theory and how did a nation follow him in Mass they first had to disregard this now they shouldn't have done that because this is the owner's manual does the manufacturers Playbook you understand so this is your b-i-b-l-e they got a song like that I think we sing that in Sunday school and it's basic uh instruction before leaving Earth amen so and it's full of principles it's not just full of stories and histories and doctrines and teachings it's full of principles that aren't a lot of times they're not necessarily doctrines just like I said earlier when I said manhood is an office that's a principle that's not a Doctrine that's a principle you understand so there's principles like you know we we coin phrases you know that if you uh how how's the old saying go if you do this you spoil the child I forget now it's escaping my mind but spare the right there you go thank you spare the rod my son's going how did you forget that [Laughter] but if you spare the club I mean spare the rod you spoil the child brother Eddie never used a rod or a club he picked up whatever was closest to it it might be the mailbox chucked up out of the ground you just didn't know but whatever he did worked amen you know and so whenever whenever he didn't want to do anything he turned the assault off hurricane loose on us and sister Gene could give you 40 lashes before you could say wait mom amen that's a true story and so I'm I but I today stand thankful for every one of them ever last one of them I couldn't understand as a child you know that she would say I've gotta I gotta think down the road if I don't get this stop now what will this become see she understood compounding sin she understood that that compound interest in sin it might be this might be a small thing now the punishment might seem much worse than the crime but Mom's not looking she's looking at the compound I see what this will become I got to make sure I get it eliminated while while I can get it eliminated so and so so we find then that that this whole idea of just Chase fun Chase pleasure whatever way you can find pleasure and avoid sin you know I I was looking today and I I try not to get too wrapped up in it because I can get very melancholy watching it with a love for history and I go back and I I study history and I was looking today at the history of the Third Reich and you know it just caused me to again once again for the umpteenth time in my life as a student of History uh it caused me again to see the futility of every Tyrant or every strong man who ever lived who tried to dominate his fellow man through tyranny through oppression and none of them were ever true they if you go back and look at them all they started out with all these ideals and ideological oh it sounds like this guy's going to build a Utopia I mean that the whole reason they were trying to assassinate Lenin was because he betrayed the revolution and and the whole thing was now was supposed to actually bring freedom brought more tyranny than the monarch he had than the Imperial Czar had done and so all these people and all these young people are now disillusioned and the young woman takes a gun and tries to gun him down shoots three times he he survived but he was never healthy again never normal again ended up having a stroke and dying so she got him you know with kind of the the long shot and and so you know and they how many times they tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler and and all all kinds of tyrants if you look at the history they all had to worry about assassins and many of them did get taken out by people close to them you know we you know Shakespeare wrote a lot about that and that was the kind of a day that he lived in because you know everybody's gunning for the top guy and so the whole thing is sinful nobody nobody had if you if you look at Society they they were talking about how that I remember brother Branham said you know I went to see the remains of this great Monarch and those guys my arrogance was uh their arrogance was Indescribable and they just would kill people just for no reason no okay I think you should die today why I don't just I just don't like you go die and they would and then people would die by the by the tens of thousands genocide genocide is considered a phenomenon which means they really can't fully explain it it's like they know it shouldn't be what is it that makes man turn on fellow man and commit the most horrific almost Indescribable I was watching today a testimony of a young woman who was seven 16 17 and 18 and she was at Auschwitz she survived her and her mother with just sheer tenacity my goodness those two ladies were amazing and uh and and she was just she was it was the most detail I had ever heard she went back to visit had a hard time walking back to it she's got her oldest son and she's giving him details and and they killed your grandfather and grandmother here and here's where all your aunts and uncles died and your cousins and all of our town folk in our school my school Chums and I was the only Survivor and and you know and and so and and I just thought to myself you know how is it as brother Branham said when you go to look at what they've accomplished you have to dig down into the Earth to even find their Dusty old broken down remains and I mean you couldn't stand there in their presence and say Hey you know you dummy you don't even realize there's a God above you and you're nothing and then about 2 000 years they're going to have to dig down in the sand to even find your throne where you sit now or you would have killed you immediately for saying it but you'd have been right they they you know how many of them perished all of them you know how many ordinary men die all of them you know how many extraordinary family of God died none of them Hallelujah so you got something to live for you're not ordinary you're extraordinary you're part of the family of God you got a gene of the heavenly father down inside you and they're not going to have to come after Armageddon and dig down for my remains I'll walk out on the top of the ashes of it Hallelujah all men come to the same place and their wives get laid beside them and I was looking you know at the the whole dichotomy you know that was John Kennedy and and then after he died and then you know he's got a baby that's died and then finally Jackie O dies and they bury her beside him and then John Jr dies and it's all part of Prophecy where the Bible was going to take the name of Ahab out of existence and even and even talks about I remember when John Kennedy Jr you know crashed his plane with his wife and a friend into the ocean and you know when you go back to see The Offspring of Ahab and you look at his family and you see the mark because brother Brown talks he he took those at John Kennedy for to correlate Ahab and The Jezebel system behind him not Jackie but Rome but but Jackie was the one who had the connection from from Paris to Hollywood and and the and the whole nonsense and vulgarity became pervasive here until everybody had to have church women Pastors in churches wanted a hairstyle like Jackie Onassis like Jacqueline Kennedy and brother Branham talks about the correlations listen when a prophet connects those dots that's not an accident and when you go and you look at how and how John dies and how John Jr dies and you go back to the Bible and you look at the Heritage and the Bible says of him he sank down in his chariot he sat down in his chair both of them sank down in the Chariot they were riding in God is Not mocked there's never been a prophecy that hasn't come to pass to the latter it goes unnoticed by the world and even if it's noticed it's not cared about thank God you care thank God we care I care about the word I care about principles see so so since death then you know it's why we said here some some time ago Chris and I were talking about that on our church workout day where we were saying what's the point of life if you fail to gain eternal life I mean what's the real point you live you pay taxes you die you're probably sick about a third of the time and oppressed another third of the time and and and and whatever's left it's probably a make a man born of a woman is just a few days and full of trouble full of trouble see and you don't have to be alive very long to understand that that real life is not fair and it can be very very depressing you know if if enough things Daisy chained together that really just just steals all hope from you when people lose hope and and I just thought to myself wow you know he's saying you're not an ordinary no I'm not ordinary because I don't even I don't even mourn for the dead as others do I have a hope in Christ it doesn't say you know it doesn't say that I'm not sad at the loss but but I but I don't do it like the world does I got an extra measure I have a hope of the resurrection and I really believe that that's part of my whole psyche it's not just something I that I I think is true and I'm trying to make myself believe it no it's it's even more than Faith it's me it's part of me so I'm I I'm No Ordinary man I have the life of the Resurrection within me so I really am actually Death Proof and so I I really have only one purpose friends you say what is your brother Jason if you could name your greatest if you like David and and somebody said to you on your deathbed what what has been your greatest purpose in life I I would have all the things you know to say to my sons and to my grandchildren that my dad said to me that that a prophet said to him and said to me but but if you if the question is what would you consider your greatest goal in life and I would say everything else pales by far in comparison to a single goal that on that day I'll stand with those in the Book of Revelation and they stood around the throne and lived in an innumerable number lifted up praises and glory and stood around the throne I'll be around the Throne of my Creator that's my goal everything else is subservient to that every mode of every objective every plan short term midterm long-term every investment I make the whole compounding of my life is to get me there around that throne Hallelujah and so it's interesting I I was watching um you know some of the testimonies of them and the the generation today you know they have questions of that generation there that went along with Hitler like that and how could you have done it and the the children were caught up in it and the teenagers caught up in it and the old the middle age and the old and the elderly and everybody was just drunk with genocidal thoughts and of course it wasn't every single one of them there's great stories of heroism among the German people who did not agree with it and hit Jews and connived again committed treasonous acts against their own government because they they considered God a higher government and I believe God will have a place for them Hallelujah and I don't even know what denomination they might have been but I'm here to tell you blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy amen God will not forget that he has a book of remembrance of remembrance and but but in general generally speaking and they they have a question and you know they they ask one of the and he had been one of the Hitler's kids you know and they they're asking him and he says well you know he says I I can't answer and he says all I can tell you is it was a very terrible time he says it was a horrible time and here's an old man struggling to try to put into words how are you going to how do you account for what happened you were there please help this generation to understand that generation but yet that generation is no different than the then the then the uh the the uh the the terrible terrorism that we have today where they walk into crowded markets and blow up innocent people it's all ideology see it's all you can't you can't believe what ideology can make you do and and the and and to the world they don't understand how your ideology makes you live the way you live how do you live like that you're weird you're a cult no we're not how could I be weird or a cult when I espouse everything that's virtuous and everything that's just and everything that's decent and everything that's honest the only the only reason you look at me like that is because you're insane and not today I stand on the principles that the church has always stood on and so you know they they they actually had a panel of experts I'm going to try to stop a little early if I can they had a panel of experts doctor this and doctor that and doctor this and Dr that fine that's good but but they're going to try to answer this genocide this phenomenon and I I listened to them for quite a little while I didn't just give it a small listen I actually set for probably two or three hours just today going over these testimonies trying to get my mind wrapped around what their thinking is and the thing that I can tell you this the thing that left me astonished the most is how easy I answered the questions how quickly the answers to me were immediately obvious and they have to have an hour and a half to go through these long drawn out conflicted the whole thing was so jacked up by the time they got it done they didn't even know who was what and who was on First and what was on second no one knew who's on third and and you know they they they're they're they're trying to to figure this out and you know they got all these psychological theories they had three questions here was their three questions they were only trying to answer three questions at a big Summit here's all kinds of people we're only going to try to answer three questions we have the most imminent experts on our platform and we're going to take on these three perplexing questions that everybody seems to want to know why are some attracted to hateful and extreme ideologies so as soon as I heard that question I mean I mean of course of course the answer must begin with the you know with the overarching what the Bible calls the cruelty of sin that that accounts for a lot of it there's a lot of things in the world that seem so horrible and you just say and then the people want to blame God and they say to a Christian or preacher said how how did how does this happen if there's a God and I just simply say God doesn't do it it's the cruelty of sin let's get that first let's get that straight when God built the Earth it didn't have none of that you see and when it whenever a nation was keeping his his Commandments they didn't act like that and so so that's where it starts but but a really a more direct answer which is what they were looking for Why are some attracted to hateful and extreme ideologies and I just thought to myself you know that that it's because of the Fallen nature of man who's born in sin he's a brood Beast how about we start with that that never even near the end of the discussion that's not even part of the equation their brute Beast trying to figure out why other brewed beasts act like Brew beasts and nobody thinks to look in the mirror of God's word and go the enemy is me and and and and if I was converted and if Hitler had got the Holy Ghost he wouldn't have acted that way and it wouldn't have mattered what kind of childhood he had it wouldn't have mattered who his mentors were once the Holy Ghost comes in in five seconds you're a brand new creation in Christ Jesus all things are passed away and All Things become new see they had a second question why are others willing now this is I thought this was amazing why are others willing to take extraordinary risks to help neighbors or even people they don't know and they're that there's they they were doing that some Germans were committing treasonous acts and hiding people sometimes they get caught and then they get killed with them and and you and you had you know and and I thought so what what makes others willing to take extraordinary risk to help neighbors or even people they don't know well first of all we're going to start with that all humankind is created in the image of God and and and make decisions there's going to be an unwise virgin who are Sanctified Saints who are righteous people who aren't even born again of the Holy Ghost there there are people in the world who are going to gain eternal life because of a Kind deed they did and were a benefit to God's family say well how did they get so lucky they weren't lucky it's obvious that from some point in their life they started making decisions about good and compounding interest paid off that's not hard for me to figure out maybe many maybe some of them have the Holy Ghost who are born again and that's why they did it but maybe not all of them were but even even good people let me tell you some friends there's going to be Heaven is going to be thrown with millions of people who are not part of the Bride the bride lives in the Royal City but the whole world will be filled with nations of people who make decisions to refuse deep evil from a very young age and it just kept compounding and they grew up and became a decent human being I'm not talking about good old boys getting to Heaven not that's not what I'm suggesting but old boys generally don't get to heaven see because we're not talking about you know kind good-natured people who are just easy going and get drunk but they're still easy going I'm not talking about that I'm talking about people who built in the image of God know that right is right and wrong is wrong and God will have a place for him he absolutely will so compounding you know that it's so compounding here here what I was talking about at the beginning this compounding thing it's so compounding to people that they will not only risk their lives and did they'll knowingly risk their lives of their family then children if they get caught they're all gonna die so don't underestimate the power of compound goodness do good the Bible says that it's a direct commandment do good do that which is right in the sight of God for four thousand years people did right who weren't born again they didn't have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost wasn't given you understand but for 4 000 years for for fourth for I mean I mean Here Comes abimelech he's not even in Abraham's family he'll never be in Abraham's family he's not going to be part of the elected but he's not down there in Sodom and he's a noble King and he's he he prays and God talks to him and he's never gonna he's never going to understand who is who this Melchizedek was God there's no Covenant promise to to him but God spares him and cause him a a a righteous man I'm telling you something friends just remember that's why that's why I say to a lot of people sometimes you say I can't win them to the message well that's that's that's his election I mean that's that's the election that's the seed Gene is there or it's not that doesn't mean that that you can't lead them to Christ and they could find Heaven A Heavenly home that's going to happen to millions of people so always look to do good and always look to witness and and always you're going to try to fish for it to see if maybe a gene seed is laying there but if it's not tell them about the love of God and what he's done to you see so so we find then that that that you know that compounding good then becomes really becomes a bulwark against compounding evil and I mean that might be true in the that you could have I mean some of those German people had that evil family the next door to them or across the street so you just never know where you're going to encounter evil but that's why Jesus that Jesus was so strange to the Jews because they had never heard of a rabbi saying that that if someone steals your coat give him your cloak also and he they're hearing Jesus they'd always heard the the other Pharisees say it's an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and they had to have Sanctuary cities and people had to run for their lives and Jesus said but I say unto you forgive and do good to them which evenly mistreat you if you only do good to those who are good to you then what makes you different from a sinner see so so being a Christian is extraordinary you understand you're an extraordinary person the third question was why do societies fall that's probably the easiest one of all why have they always fallen that's what they should have asked you know I can look back as a student of history and they've always felt always and the thing that got him was because the sinful mind is enmity against God and can never agree with God and it's always going to choose evil and it always has and so the mind of Christ is passed on it's passed on an overwhelming majority especially among the intellectual Elite and they espouse the sin and perversions that are against God's word ah instead of the life principles that it teaches brother Brandon says this and I'm going to stop I'm going to close with this because here's what I want here's what I want to position myself for next time brother Brown says in the message one in a million not tremendous message brother Bradham comes with a Pulpit three different times he comes up and it's like little short 15-20 minute sermons then somehow I'm not sure what's going on I think it maybe it's because of the radio they had radio slots and then they go off the air then okay brother Benham come back and he comes back up again finally says okay this is my third time up here and uh but the people are still pulling but he says here in the very first of the three segments he says speaking of God he is supposed to according to the scriptures Return To Us in this last days in this type of ministry that will be after the baptism now watch he's going to go back to Azusa the the most recent Revival he says that will be this ministry that's coming that will be after the baptism of the spirit and speaking in tongues and Divine Healing and so forth these things the capping of the Pentecostal message is what we're speaking of today so you're taught well in this we don't when we say we're looking for the capping that's not at the neglect of the of what built to it but neither do we cabbage on on the building blocks we want to come to the completion you understand so we take all of it and we bring it all together in balance and harmony and so he and but but here's here's the real takeaway that the Azusa Revival was never going to be able to put a bride in a rapture and it was the and it was the last great gasp of the ages it was the last best thing and it was the it was the hail Mary and they they threw it and it landed and it was a great Revival and within months Satan was already dividing them they were already starting to denominate they're already starting to split up here and split up there and by the time brother Branham even got around them they were already so they were already as divided as we Baptists were and he spends all these years trying to get them together brothers were one where one were one until they finally just shut their doors because he won't side with this one he won't side with that and he said I've stood between him and tried to say we're one and nobody wanted to hear that and so the age closes out as as God's dealing with the church because the church comes to a point where and this is what a prophet taught us she is no longer the mouthpiece of God she had been through the ages but she reaches a point where she's no longer the mouthpiece of God she's kicked Christ out she's no longer the mouthpiece of God she brother Adam says she's her own mouthpiece and God will confound her through the prophet and the bride amen and that's why a bride under her Prophet is the final Voice or the final demonstration the last will and testament the last image that God is proving to a world of what it means to be extraordinary of what it means to be an elect of what it means to be back to the original like the original family so he says the capping of the Pentecostal message is what we're speaking of today this ministry of Christ now watch this this is a mouthful you ready to you ready to feel extraordinary this ministry the one he's speaking of this ministry of Christ himself impersonated among his people with the very same things that he did when he was here on Earth in his body the bride which is part of him doing the same things as husband and wife or King and Queen just before the marriage ceremony this can't be ordinary people what I just read to you can't be ordinary people yeah it's got to be ordinary plus thanks Mike he goes on now watch this I'm going to read you these two two paragraphs then we're gonna we're gonna hit the brakes pull the shoot and jump out this week the Lord willing I wish to speak on some of that out in our campaign here to kind of get acquainted he says the time and the hour that we're living if a person don't know now follow me close if a person don't know which way to go what to do or how to turn you're not walking by faith anymore that's easy I get that you get that if you if you don't know which way to go and what to do if if all the events of the world are leaving you bewildered and you don't know you don't know how am I supposed to be a Christian what do I do I see what's happening in the government what's happening in socialism what's happening in education what's happening in science what's happening in the earth I see what's happening and you know what do I do what do I do what I do the whole world the whole world is doing that they're they're going in circles trying to figure it all out they're not operating in faith they're running in fear but that's not for you that's for ordinary people who who have not uh given the time they should have given to God's instructions but to you who have loved his appearing you're supposed to be operating by faith see now watch he's gonna it's gonna get worse then you're not walking by faith anymore you're just guessing you're presuming presume is to advance without official Authority now here's a real question so if we haven't got the real official authority to know what God Said would take place in this hour how are we ever going to face this hour read it again if we haven't got the real official Authority in other words thus saith the Lord on the word to know thus saith the Lord no question no guessing this is what it is that's what the seven seal is doing this is what the message is this is the people it's calling see if you don't have an authoritative an official Authority if you don't have an authoritative word on that then then the world you're and here and here's what makes it worse if we if we haven't got the real official authority to know what God Said would take place in this hour in other words if we don't have thus saith the Lord then how are we ever going to face this hour here it is and we've got to face it I mean I'd like to give you a pass and say don't worry if you don't get it you just you just get a pass you want to face it no you're facing it every day you were facing it when you woke up this morning you're gonna face it tomorrow your children are facing it and so I ask you tonight where where are you getting your Authority from oh I hope you're not getting it from intellectualism I hope it's a fire breathing experience of the Holy Ghost that'll not only ratify and vindicate this message but it'll it'll migrate it from text behind skin and it'll make you a living word in the hour and that's how you will face it we've got to face it knowing by faith in his word the things that's supposed to be happening now here's the here's the here's three he names the condition of the Nations the condition of the people the condition of the church and so forth we've got to know that last paragraph we've got to know that and then how to walk out to face it if you don't know how to do that you're just what we used to call kind of haphazardly just jump in hoping it'll be here hoping this and hoping that and will it be but God don't love this Kentucky word God don't want us to do that could I say to you tonight in a hillbilly way God don't want us to do that he doesn't want you unsure he want he doesn't want you to see yourself as ordinary he wants you to not only see yourself as extraordinary but he wants you to take on the responsibility of what that entails and that is a life totally surrendered to God so that you become a North star to someone looking to find life that you become a guy you become a life to a dark world see we've got to know that we've got to know how to walk out to face it if you don't know how that you're just haphazardly see God don't want us to do that he wants us to know what he said about this day and then meet it by faith because he said it would be that way then we know your truth then because you haven't got some person's word for it you've got his word of what we must do and we're we're hoping that our heavenly father will grant this to us this week I'm here to tell you something friends every gate that held my soul from a sin Birth has been opened and I stand a free man tonight every gate of sin every order everything that made me an ordinary like all other men born in sin come into the world speaking lies everything that made me an ordinary man made you an ordinary woman ordinary man ordinary young person I'm here to tell you they're they're that all you've got to do is get the gate to open that gate that tries to hold that soul in an unconverted condition I'm here to tell you something friends Satan can't hold that on you you can go right out of that gate in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you can walk right into the promised land of the Holy Ghost and my soul is free it's already back home it's already over Satan it's already too late I love that I tell him all the time you're already too late I mean it's it's not just I get to say saying you're too late I just love adding that little bit no you're actually already too late which means you already didn't have a chance now you got less it's already too late I'm already in Heavenly places I have no unbelief say how do you know you have no unbelief because I have no desire for sin I have only one desire and my whole battle my greatest battle every fault and that I'm fighting is to bring my mind and my body my hands and my ears and my eyes subject to what's already happened within me and has made me an extraordinary person Hallelujah the effects of sin on these human realms are conquered My Flesh my body my spirit my mind are still held but I don't have to live held you just remember that today yeah your mind your body it's still in this Fallen State you're still dying in your Corporal body but I'm here to tell you I don't have to live like I'm held oh my that trumpet's going to sound it's near sounding do you believe that it's near to sounding once and for all no I'm not an ordinary man and we are not an ordinary people stand up all you extraordinary people of God who God has loved in an extraordinary way who has sent you an extraordinary word so that you can do extraordinary things in the last day the people who know their God are going to have that kind of a lifestyle they're going to do amazing extraordinary things things you know when you do something like that it's beyond you it's some it's some extra measure that you wouldn't have normally been able to do but somehow men have had tremendous heroics but like like brother Bradham said many good men died and many good men died for even a good cause but still they died like ordinary men and if they didn't die ready to meet God they went where all ordinary men who aren't ready to meet God go when they die say where is that where they all go why what's the common denominator they didn't know God in the opportunity God gave them life and a way to know God and that God made it so clear that even all they had to do was acknowledge Him in nature and not be a heathen and not worship the creation more than the Creator and have enough because and the whole reason for that was not because that heathenism didn't start out because of a lack of understanding it started out as a choice that when they knew God they chose not to worship him as God and they made to themselves four-footed creatures and reptiles and birds and all kinds of statues but there was a time when they knew God and they chose not to have they chose to just be ordinary people not me not me no no no way no way I am not here to be an ordinary man and go to the ordinary place where all ordinary Godless people go I'm gonna I've got a whole new world waiting on me I have made up my mind I have made up my mind I started with Jesus and I'm going through I'm going all the way I'm not sidetracking I'm certainly not backing up I'm not even going to stand still because if you stand still you start backsliding because the world's like a treadmill it's in motion constantly and if you stop progressing you'll start declining see you can't you can't do that you gotta you gotta constantly press toward this Mark Press means strain means stretch means reach see amen I can't go any further if I do I'll be in next time material we're going to have uh Brother Scott Smith with us this coming weekend and we're having our service that's going to be a it's going to be a regular

out and then and then we're going to uh have Brother Scott come out so so it won't it's not going to be some long drawn out thing we'll we'll be able to get everything done uh probably in about 40 minutes before Brother Scott is turned loose and that's pretty normal our Sunday mornings usually go about 35-40 minutes before I get going and so that it'll kind of run like a normal thing and then brother Scott will maybe take a few minutes maybe he thought maybe 10 or so minutes and finish up some comments he didn't have enough time for at the funeral and then he's just going to throw down and preach he's going to just say what he wants to about says Jan and then he's going to preach the sermon and so it'll kind of run a normal course and when we dismiss we'll have we're going to have a big
