[17:09] case you weren't ready
[17:10] so when i got out to come here andrew
[17:11] said i got a list from tony and i got a

[17:17] for the kid come on you could be seated
[17:18] got something special amen
[17:22] now my dad our pastor told us to do that
[17:25] he said a song leader that said if no
[17:26] one has a special
[17:28] you call somebody out of the audience a
[17:29] gifted singer to come up and sing so
[17:31] i'm just obeying the pastor here by the
[17:38] [Music]
[17:44] king
[17:48] [Music]
[17:58] um
[18:00] [Music]
[18:12] so
[18:14] [Music]
[18:26] just
[18:30] test test test can you turn that up just
[18:34] a little bit
[18:36] test
[18:39] well i haven't sung in a while and
[18:41] nothing like being put on the spot
[18:43] so y'all pray for me
[18:47] actually never sung this song
[18:51] in the church before we were practicing
[18:54] it
[18:54] and amariah sung it and uh
[18:57] so i didn't sing it but this has been on
[19:00] my heart pretty heavy
[19:01] so we'll try it
[19:06] key of d andrew
[19:13] they say sometimes you win some
[19:18] sometimes you lose some
[19:24] right now right now
[19:28] i'm losing man
[19:33] [Music]
[19:35] i've stood on this stage night after
[19:39] night
[19:40] reminding the broken it'll be
[19:44] all right right now
[19:48] oh right now i just
[19:52] can't
[19:53] [Music]
[19:56] it's easy to sing when there's nothing
[20:00] to bring me down
[20:07] but what will i say when i'm held to
[20:11] the flame like i am right now
[20:17] i know you're able and i
[20:21] know you can save through the fire with
[20:25] your
[20:26] mighty hand but even if you don't
[20:33] my hope is you alone
[20:37] [Music]
[20:42] they say it only takes a little faith
[20:46] [Music]
[20:56] little faith is all i
[20:59] have right now
[21:04] but god when you choose to leave
[21:07] mountains unmovable
[21:15] give me the strength to be able to see
[21:19] it as well with my
[21:23] soul i know you're able
[21:27] and i know you can't save through the
[21:31] fire with your
[21:33] mighty hand but even if you
[21:38] don't my hope is you
[21:42] alone i
[21:46] know the sorrow when i know the herd
[21:50] would all go away if you just say the
[21:54] word
[21:55] but even if you don't
[22:00] my hope is you alone
[22:05] you've been faithful
[22:08] you've been good
[22:12] all my days jesus
[22:16] i will cling
[22:19] to you come
[22:23] with me cause i know you're able
[22:30] i know you can't
[22:34] oh i know you're able
[22:39] i know you can save through the fire
[22:43] with
[22:43] your mighty hand but even if you
[22:48] don't my hope is you alone
[22:56] i know the sorrow i know the hurt
[23:01] would all go away if you just say
[23:04] the word but if you
[23:08] don't my hope is

[32:34] special singing wow
[32:36] man i was about to have a runaway in the
[32:38] back praise the lord
[32:40] amen nice to have you all here today i'm
[32:43] gonna have a beautiful day
[32:44] for aaron good to see you in your family
[32:46] again god bless you amen brother joel
[32:48] there you stand praise god brother
[32:51] good to have you here among us this
[32:52] morning praise god we're going to invite
[32:55] you
[32:56] into the scriptures this morning to the
[32:58] 17th chapter
[33:00] of luke i want to read just a familiar
[33:03] passage
[33:04] and just move right in
[33:08] to what the lord has been dealing with
[33:09] me on for quite a little while now
[33:12] and it's been coming
[33:15] more in pieces than it has up and that
[33:18] that that happens sometimes
[33:20] sometimes you're you're just the heavens
[33:23] open and the floodgates and it just
[33:25] falls on you and you just write out a
[33:27] whole sermon
[33:29] lock stock and barrel in a moment
[33:32] and then sometimes the lord just put a
[33:34] little piece here and there and you just
[33:35] keep making notes
[33:37] and you you keep adding because you you
[33:39] keep feeling the same inspiration
[33:42] and that's going to be the case for
[33:44] today and i think that's fitting because
[33:45] it's our first sunday
[33:47] uh in the new year praise the lord
[33:51] amen so i want to just
[33:54] really establish you know where we are
[33:57] and
[33:58] what we should be expecting i was
[34:00] listening in the back to brother matt's
[34:02] sunday school and i think that's
[34:05] was part of the labor at least of his
[34:07] heart was to really correctly identify
[34:10] uh where we are and because if you
[34:14] you remember brother branham talks about
[34:16] that when the bride recognizes who she
[34:18] is
[34:20] then there's something attached to that
[34:22] then that's the time
[34:23] when the enemy is completely defeated by
[34:25] her
[34:27] amen he's he's he's as thwarted by her
[34:30] as he was
[34:31] by jesus in the wilderness that that's
[34:33] when she
[34:35] can do the mighty works and so
[34:38] when she recognizes who she is satan
[34:41] will be powerless
[34:43] before her so you know in the same
[34:46] vein you you want to find out where we
[34:49] are in prophecy this is why brother
[34:50] branham would take a sermon
[34:52] modern events and teach us of really a
[34:54] principle that's not just a sermon
[34:56] that's a principle modern events are
[34:59] made clear
[35:00] by prophecy because you need to know who
[35:02] you are and you need to know
[35:04] what's up you need to know what is to be
[35:07] expected
[35:08] and you need to know how to go about it
[35:09] you need marching orders
[35:11] amen so i think that that's
[35:14] why every ministry brother branham talks
[35:17] about will be that's the first
[35:18] fundamental principle
[35:20] of a god called ministries it's based on
[35:22] the word of god not
[35:24] conjecture or opinions or thoughts or
[35:26] meanderings or ramblings it's actually
[35:28] based on the word
[35:30] because the heavens and earth will pass
[35:32] away but the word won't
[35:34] my word will fail your word will fail
[35:36] but his word can't
[35:37] fail amen so i want to be feeding on the
[35:40] body word of the son of man amen
[35:43] that's it it is that feeding that'll
[35:46] change your body
[35:47] it'll take us in the rapture
[35:51] praise the lord all right somebody help
[35:52] me which lafontaine is this
[35:56] solomon god bless you brother amen i
[35:58] wasn't going to take a stab at it i'd
[35:59] miss it
[36:00] amen micah good to see you young man
[36:02] praise the lord happy to have
[36:04] solomon brother micah here with us so
[36:07] you guys uh
[36:08] brother kenny found your house yet or uh
[36:13] hey man brother kenny amen we're working
[36:16] on it
[36:16] amen praise the lord so that's one of
[36:19] those times where i'm happy to be a
[36:21] conspirator
[36:22] amen praise the lord
[36:25] amen luke 17 very familiar to us
[36:29] want to just take um and let's
[36:33] let's start in verse 24
[36:38] i think would be a good place just for
[36:40] context
[36:42] for as the lightning that lighteneth out
[36:45] of the one part
[36:46] under heaven shineth unto the other part
[36:50] under heaven so shall also
[36:53] the son of man be in his day
[36:58] but first must he suffer many things
[37:01] and be rejected of this generation see
[37:05] and as it was in the days of noah
[37:09] so shall it be also in the days of the
[37:12] son of man
[37:14] they did eat now he's going to make a
[37:15] comparison to noah's day
[37:17] they did eat they drank they married
[37:20] wives they were given in marriage
[37:22] in other words they just were normal
[37:24] life it's life going
[37:25] on all right you know what happened they
[37:28] ran into a new year's day
[37:30] and then another one and then another
[37:32] one and this went on
[37:35] and he says that they did eat they drank
[37:39] they married wives they were given in
[37:41] marriage until the day that noah entered
[37:43] into the ark
[37:45] and the flood came and destroyed them
[37:47] all
[37:48] likewise also as it was in the days of
[37:51] lot
[37:52] here it is again normal life they did
[37:55] eat
[37:55] they drank they bought they sold
[37:58] they planted they builded you know
[38:02] they went to school they invested they
[38:04] had parties they
[38:06] had life they raised kids they took
[38:08] vacations all right
[38:10] but the same day that lot went out of
[38:12] sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[38:14] heaven
[38:15] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[38:18] it be
[38:19] in the day when the son of man is
[38:22] revealed
[38:24] let's pray father we're grateful to you
[38:30] lord in such a focused way this morning
[38:33] because we realize
[38:36] that we would we owe you everything

[38:42] we owe you a debt we could never repay
[38:45] father and and i'm i'm glad that the
[38:49] only thing you've asked

[41:45] in jesus name amen god bless you friends
[41:48] you can be seated
[41:53] brother kev we're going to hit a few
[41:56] scriptures here out of matthew we're
[41:57] going to first go to mark's gospel
[41:59] in the second chapter and just idle
[42:02] there for a moment i'll give you the
[42:04] verse
[42:05] momentarily
[42:10] it's a incredible day that we live in
[42:13] it's not
[42:14] a day that you want to underestimate
[42:16] this is a day that things are happening
[42:18] in the kingdom of god and in the world
[42:21] i mean things are happening so fast and
[42:24] they're not little small movements
[42:26] big things are happening even small
[42:29] things are big
[42:31] and because the stakes are so high and
[42:34] we realize that
[42:35] you know i i i want you to to
[42:39] try to i'm going to try to bring your
[42:41] mind into the into the vision that i've
[42:43] had for this sermon
[42:44] i want to i've titled it the greatest
[42:47] sign
[42:48] you know i want to say that the hour
[42:51] that we
[42:51] have arrived at we certainly haven't
[42:54] arrived here by
[42:55] accident you haven't just stumbled into
[42:57] this
[42:58] you haven't just you know i was just
[43:00] walking along
[43:01] actually that's not true the footsteps
[43:04] of the righteous are ordered over the
[43:06] lord
[43:06] and god doesn't wait till you get born
[43:08] again to start affecting that on your
[43:10] life
[43:11] you understand that from the day you
[43:13] were born as a child of god brother
[43:15] branham would teach us so clearly
[43:17] that you did not become a son on the day
[43:20] you repented you might have fell at an
[43:21] altar you might have
[43:22] an experience that any one of us could
[43:24] stand up in here today
[43:26] and say on this certain day this was
[43:29] happening
[43:29] and this was going on and god got a hold
[43:31] of me and from that day i have been a
[43:33] son or daughter of god that's actually
[43:35] a nice way to say it it gives you a
[43:38] little bit of clarity and helps you
[43:39] focus
[43:40] and helps you testify to somebody you
[43:41] know when did you come to the lord and
[43:43] you've got your testimony
[43:44] but really friends the larger uh 50 000
[43:48] foot view
[43:48] shows us that you were actually always a
[43:51] child of god
[43:52] and that that that really what happened
[43:55] on that day of conversion
[43:56] is you just started cooperating in the
[43:59] vision but it's a vision god has had for
[44:01] you
[44:02] before there was stardust and i you know
[44:04] that's my prayer
[44:05] that i pray for myself i pray it for my
[44:09] family i pray it for you and for your
[44:12] family lord
[44:13] i have one motive and objective in life
[44:16] and that is to reach the vision
[44:19] that you saw of me before the foundation
[44:23] of the world
[44:23] i don't want to come up short
[44:27] i don't want to be left of the target i
[44:30] want to hit
[44:30] the bullseye listen friends that's not
[44:33] just a
[44:34] psychology lesson striving for
[44:36] excellence i mean that's
[44:37] that's good too but this is a much more
[44:40] important thing
[44:41] just striving for excellence in business
[44:43] or striving for excellence in the
[44:44] community
[44:45] or you know striving for excellence and
[44:47] and and education
[44:49] you know this is more than that this is
[44:52] trying to
[44:53] to to equalize your your
[44:56] human life with all of your
[44:59] bumps and knots and warts
[45:02] with all of your weaknesses and failures
[45:05] and your doubts and your fears
[45:06] with all of your anxiety i get it and
[45:09] understand this god understands all that
[45:12] and and and but yet he has still got a
[45:14] purpose
[45:15] to bring you to the exact bullseye
[45:19] of the vision he has for you and that's
[45:22] really what your life is all about and i
[45:24] can't account for your neighbor
[45:28] i can't account for what's happening in
[45:30] politics
[45:31] fully i get i get it it's an event clear
[45:34] to me in prophecy
[45:35] but i'm simply saying it's madness to me
[45:39] you know but i i want you to know
[45:41] friends i i'm not here to try to qualify
[45:46] the what the how the why the reasoning
[45:48] or even to make sense of what we see
[45:51] going on in the world other than to say
[45:53] it's the end time
[45:55] but i but i am preaching to you today
[45:59] and to let you
[46:00] know that there is not a single thing
[46:03] that has or is or shall
[46:06] or can happen in your life but what god
[46:10] has a very distinct purpose behind it
[46:13] and you just need to ask yourself today
[46:16] am i
[46:17] in line with his vision is my life
[46:19] cooperating with his because if it's not
[46:22] oh man oh buddy
[46:25] let me tell you something i hope to
[46:27] convince you by the end of the sermon
[46:28] today
[46:29] you're going to want to have your life
[46:31] every minute detail of your life
[46:34] fixed in in synchronous harmony
[46:38] with god's plan for you
[46:43] it's interesting how that the world
[46:47] stumbles it it's not new that they
[46:50] stumble around in darkness and they
[46:51] can't make sense
[46:53] they can't answer the why you know
[46:56] these things have their humor and i'm
[46:58] i'm i'm i
[47:00] i don't know what i'm looking for when i
[47:01] do it but i've had some interesting
[47:03] responses
[47:04] and you walk in a store and here comes
[47:07] some salesman or
[47:08] floor lady or somebody coming along and
[47:10] and um
[47:12] you know say can i help you oh you know
[47:13] we're uh we're just looking you know and
[47:16] if there's anything if there's anything
[47:17] you need to know just ask
[47:19] and i wait for him to turn away and i go
[47:21] what's the meaning of life
[47:25] and generally i get i get a stun look
[47:27] like
[47:28] um well not that question but any other
[47:31] question
[47:31] you have and a lot of times you know the
[47:34] there's been a few times where it was a
[47:36] great conversation starter
[47:38] but it's it i find it um
[47:42] in one sense i get it completely but in
[47:45] another sense it all
[47:46] it never ceases to amaze me that how
[47:49] thick or how
[47:50] dull the hearing and the eyesight is of
[47:53] the
[47:53] of the average man who looks at these
[47:56] calamities in the world
[47:58] and just looks at him and blinks a few
[47:59] times and just just goes
[48:01] wow what's the world coming to and then
[48:03] right back to their
[48:05] treadmill you know but but you know the
[48:09] the believer has a
[48:10] a different kind of an idea than that
[48:13] because we realize that our life's not
[48:16] an accident and my life is not
[48:18] accidental
[48:20] and i i i'm here by a purpose and so i
[48:22] want to be driven
[48:24] by that purpose they got all kinds of
[48:26] books they write and
[48:28] little sayings and memes about a
[48:29] purpose-driven life
[48:31] my goodness they i don't think that you
[48:33] know what what man
[48:34] understands as important isn't it isn't
[48:37] it
[48:37] isn't it true that in the scriptures
[48:40] mankind humanity
[48:42] is warned to not think more highly of
[48:46] himself
[48:47] than is good or that he should that that
[48:50] what
[48:50] man calls great now i'm preaching to you
[48:53] today on the greatest sign
[48:55] what man calls great god calls
[48:57] foolishness
[48:59] that's the contrast and and what
[49:03] what man calls foolishness
[49:06] god calls great you know
[49:10] it's it it's i i i used to
[49:13] i used to tell my sons and i i didn't
[49:15] invent it i heard it and
[49:16] coined it and and and they would say you
[49:19] know
[49:20] dad you know let's do this and uh no i
[49:23] don't wanna oh come on daddy oh no
[49:24] no no please you know i say look here's
[49:26] how it's gonna work
[49:28] i do it you happy uh or no i said i said
[49:33] i don't do it me happy i do it you happy
[49:36] better me happy
[49:38] [Laughter]
[49:40] better me happy and so you know i
[49:44] i know how the world wants the world to
[49:46] go
[49:47] and i get it human people want to
[49:50] survive
[49:51] they want to prosper i understand that
[49:54] but it's it's such a it's such a sadness
[49:58] it becomes a profound sadness to me that
[50:01] that people trying to live and trying to
[50:05] succeed
[50:06] and going about it with no regard
[50:09] to their manufacturer
[50:13] and the manufacturer sent them a a
[50:17] a guidebook okay i built the world
[50:21] i put you in it i built you here's how
[50:23] you here's how you succeed
[50:24] and they go oh no no no no you know
[50:28] and they're not interested in that and
[50:30] by contrast
[50:32] i'm only interested in this like i mean
[50:35] isn't that true
[50:37] we're not weird i mean they're weird i'm
[50:40] i'm actually operating by the owner's
[50:42] manual
[50:43] and i to me that makes sense
[50:47] but you find even all the way back
[50:49] through history
[50:50] let's look at a few examples you know
[50:53] here come these pharisees and
[50:56] jesus is you know conducting his
[50:58] ministry and
[50:59] he's got his his disciples with him and
[51:03] you know they're they're they're doing
[51:05] certain things on a sabbath day
[51:08] and these pharisees trying to find fault
[51:10] they always do pharisees always
[51:13] you know pick at little things to find
[51:14] fault and
[51:16] you know you know what about this and
[51:18] what about that and
[51:19] and jesus here's his answer in mark
[51:21] chapter 2
[51:23] verse 25 brother kevin look at simple
[51:25] little verse
[51:26] and jesus look how he starts it out with
[51:29] mark
[51:29] 2 25 and he said unto them

[51:35] just that
[51:36] that whole statement have you never read
[51:39] what what are you guys you you're that
[51:41] thick have you never read what
[51:42] david you're sitting here asking me a
[51:44] question you should know the answer to
[51:47] have you never read what david did when
[51:49] he had need
[51:50] and was hungry he and they that were
[51:52] with him
[51:54] and jesus is standing talking about a
[51:55] question for the ages put those guys to
[51:57] complete silence
[51:58] hey you guys are are you that dumb
[52:01] you're questioning the action and my
[52:04] action is not contrary to the word have
[52:06] you never read the word

[52:13] should be an acceptable lifestyle that
[52:15] everybody should accept
[52:16] have you never read where have you never
[52:20] read where
[52:21] see look at look at matthew let's go to
[52:24] the gospel of matthew the 21st
[52:27] chapter brother kevin matthew 21
[52:31] and verse 16. now jesus is going to
[52:35] answer another question they're
[52:36] challenging him
[52:37] and he said he said unto them hearst
[52:41] thou
[52:41] what these say and jesus saith unto them
[52:45] yea have you never read out of the mouth
[52:48] of babes and sucklings thou has
[52:49] perfected praise
[52:51] oh i'm sorry you think that what we're
[52:54] doing is strange

[55:21] because i i can't even
[55:23] you know normally when you sit down on a
[55:27] doctor's table i mean

[55:50] and i can't even and okay let's move you
[55:52] over here uh pastor and he puts me up
[55:54] and he puts this machine
[55:56] you know and you know what what does the
[55:58] bible
[55:59] say about what's going on this political
[56:01] mike are you a doctor am i at a doctor's
[56:02] office where
[56:03] you know why don't you come to church
[56:04] and and
[56:06] and and it's and finally finally i just
[56:09] i just kind of put it i was as i told
[56:12] you
[56:12] when i started here this morning that's
[56:14] been coming to me in bits and pieces
[56:16] and this is almost kind of where it
[56:17] started this was maybe you know
[56:19] three or four weeks ago and this is kind
[56:21] of where it started
[56:22] and i kept he just kept every time i'd
[56:24] go in
[56:25] and he he wouldn't even ask me about my
[56:27] condition oh yeah we'll get to that
[56:29] uh but uh yeah i'm gonna charge you
[56:30] money for it we'll get to it in a minute
[56:32] but let me first
[56:33] let me get some free stuff off of you
[56:35] first
[56:37] and so uh you know he's asking about
[56:39] this thing in the world and this thing
[56:40] in the world and also this thing and
[56:42] what's going on in this
[56:43] nation and iran and the in the white
[56:45] house and the kremlin and china and
[56:48] i just and he says don't you think that
[56:50] those things
[56:51] are are signs aren't aren't those likes
[56:54] supposed to be epic signs of the
[56:56] of the end don't you think we're near
[56:57] the end and i said
[56:59] i said those those signs pale
[57:03] in comparison to luke 17.
[57:06] and he said luke 17 luke 17. i said have
[57:09] you never read
[57:10] i thought about jesus words have you
[57:12] never read
[57:14] jesus prophecy in luke 17 that as it was
[57:16] in the days of noah as it would be
[57:18] in the days of of lot and and how that
[57:22] jesus prophesied the lightning
[57:24] would travel from the east under the
[57:25] west and how that
[57:27] and how that in each age that there
[57:30] would be
[57:30] a uh that it would have to be a a
[57:33] rejection
[57:34] i started to i started to to note that
[57:36] for you uh
[57:37] go back brother kevin and let's look at
[57:39] the 24th
[57:41] verse again for as the lightning of luke
[57:43] 17 24 for as the lightning that
[57:45] lighteneth out of one part under heaven
[57:48] shineth unto the other part under heaven
[57:51] so
[57:51] shall also the son of man be in his day
[57:55] and of course you've got to be careful
[57:56] as a bible teacher that you keep the
[57:59] the the uh what god is doing with the
[58:01] gentiles and what he's doing for the
[58:03] sake of
[58:03] under the trumpets and i'm not trying to
[58:05] go down that way today
[58:06] because otherwise some things don't they
[58:10] historically they look like wow the
[58:12] gospel was already
[58:13] pretty far west and then suddenly
[58:15] revival jumps back
[58:17] east and falls in russia and then it
[58:19] falls in germany
[58:21] you know and and it should have long ago
[58:22] it was already crossed into
[58:25] into philadelphia it was already in
[58:26] america you know
[58:28] and now and now we're taught brother
[58:30] ramsey talks about
[58:31] you know in the the welch revival and
[58:33] all that but and and and the
[58:35] and the and the revival that fell in
[58:36] russia in different places and
[58:38] you got to understand that god's doing
[58:40] one thing when the lightning's traveling
[58:41] from the east to the west he's got one
[58:42] plan for the jews one plan for the
[58:44] gentiles amen
[58:45] is that clear so one works under the
[58:47] seals one works under the trumpets and
[58:48] you can't you got to keep them straight
[58:50] or to look like it's jumping back and
[58:51] forth
[58:52] and so so but then he says here verse 25
[58:56] so uh last part of verse 24 so
[58:59] shall also the son of man be in his day
[59:02] but
[59:03] first verse 25 but first
[59:06] he must suffer many things and be
[59:08] rejected of this
[59:10] generation now now that implies
[59:14] a rejection in at every time the sun
[59:18] goes a little further west there's a
[59:20] rejection of that age
[59:22] a little further rejection in that age a
[59:24] little further that's what makes it keep
[59:26] going further
[59:27] you understand and so every generation
[59:30] every age every the the be rejected of
[59:34] this generation and every time it
[59:36] arrives in a generation
[59:37] it's going to be rejected and it'll move
[59:38] on to the next generation well
[59:40] uh i'm here to tell you something
[59:42] friends you're the last generation
[59:45] you're the last generation that that
[59:47] this is we we have the greatest sign
[59:50] the days of noah have returned the days
[59:51] of sodom have a lot have returned and
[59:54] that's a half century ago you're so far
[59:58] into total blindness you're living in
[1:00:00] the age of impossibility
[1:00:01] you're in the last elements where god is
[1:00:03] separating out
[1:00:05] and and and and shaving it down say you
[1:00:08] know this one's jumping out and this is
[1:00:09] doing that and this one's saying that it
[1:00:11] doesn't matter it's supposed to be that
[1:00:13] way
[1:00:13] but there's also supposed to be a bride
[1:00:15] who says i believe
[1:00:16] more today than i did yesterday i'm more
[1:00:19] in love with god today than i am
[1:00:21] yesterday
[1:00:22] and that's not your superpower that's
[1:00:24] god's power
[1:00:26] dropping down upon your life we should
[1:00:29] be
[1:00:29] glad and rejoice to be able to see
[1:00:32] ourselves
[1:00:33] in the scriptures
[1:00:37] when i look in the scriptures and it
[1:00:39] shows how that family is to be acting
[1:00:42] and i see i
[1:00:47] i see a natural thing
[1:00:50] in my heart that when i read in the
[1:00:54] bible
[1:00:55] how the early church acted and reacted
[1:00:59] and how that they lived and the
[1:01:03] standards that they held and the beliefs
[1:01:05] that they held
[1:01:06] i'm sure it's true with you too i read
[1:01:10] it
[1:01:11] and there's an affinity and i go yeah
[1:01:15] that's how i like being that doesn't
[1:01:18] that's not a superpower of me that's god
[1:01:20] who's changed my heart
[1:01:22] who's given me a whole new nature and
[1:01:24] and and in fact is
[1:01:26] when i when i'm in my life going through
[1:01:29] my life
[1:01:30] and you know a lot of times you you
[1:01:33] better be an honest human being today or
[1:01:35] i'm
[1:01:35] you're going to really expose yourself
[1:01:36] as dishonest every time a human being
[1:01:39] it's not just vanity
[1:01:40] it's i don't know what it is
[1:01:41] psychologically but every time you walk
[1:01:44] past a mirror you stop
[1:01:45] okay come on
[1:01:49] [Laughter]
[1:01:51] i know maybe sometimes you look at the
[1:01:52] mirror and go oh
[1:01:55] but but you're always going to take take
[1:01:57] a stop you know
[1:01:58] i like walking past this mirror and i
[1:02:02] like walking past this mirror and going
[1:02:04] oh wait a minute hold on let me make
[1:02:05] sure okay let's see how i look
[1:02:07] oh yeah okay oh
[1:02:10] well i better change that sorry friend i
[1:02:13] can't go
[1:02:14] with you there anymore sorry i'm gonna
[1:02:16] have to what's wrong with you why have
[1:02:18] you separated well i went and stood in
[1:02:19] front of a mirror
[1:02:21] and the rest is history
[1:02:27] not true
[1:02:31] feel privileged that you like doing that
[1:02:34] feel privileged that when you read this
[1:02:36] paul said that's what paul said
[1:02:39] that he said there's a crown that's
[1:02:41] waiting me
[1:02:42] i've ran my race see paul's not here to
[1:02:46] run yours paul said i've ran mine
[1:02:48] and i have finished my course and from
[1:02:51] henceforth there's a crown awaiting me
[1:02:53] but hey hear paul's words today as paul
[1:02:56] says to you out of the bible
[1:02:58] not to me only but all of you all who
[1:03:01] love his appearing
[1:03:03] and i'm here to tell you feel privileged
[1:03:04] today if in your heart you
[1:03:06] love his appearing you love this message
[1:03:09] you love it's purity you love it's
[1:03:11] holiness
[1:03:11] you love what it's asking of you
[1:03:16] you know that i i remember hearing not
[1:03:19] too many years ago
[1:03:20] um i forget now who was doing it
[1:03:23] some radio preacher and he was doing a
[1:03:25] series on
[1:03:27] marriage and child raising and he said
[1:03:30] that they had recently completed a big
[1:03:32] study and a lot of data
[1:03:33] and you know there was the whole big
[1:03:35] concept of training up a child in the
[1:03:37] way that it should go
[1:03:40] because you know the bible doesn't just
[1:03:41] say raise children says train them up
[1:03:44] and i've i've i've had i've encountered
[1:03:47] lazy parents who don't want to do that
[1:03:50] and i just say well you're going to
[1:03:53] train them whether you want to or not
[1:03:57] your life is training them i don't care
[1:03:59] if you don't want to put in the time
[1:04:00] just
[1:04:00] understand you're training them
[1:04:04] they're watching how you live and how
[1:04:05] you act and how you react
[1:04:07] and you can't stop that so kick and
[1:04:10] scream all you want
[1:04:11] but that's the way humanity works and
[1:04:14] and so he was talking about how that you
[1:04:17] know there's this idea of training them
[1:04:19] up according to god's word
[1:04:20] which which tells you to train them
[1:04:23] which talks about a rod of correction
[1:04:24] which talks about discipline which talks
[1:04:26] about borders and parameters and ancient
[1:04:28] landmarks
[1:04:29] you don't move them and and and you want
[1:04:31] to make sure you do this and do that
[1:04:32] and then the whole other side was you
[1:04:34] know just leave them to their own
[1:04:36] devices and
[1:04:37] let them decide i mean little little did
[1:04:40] anyone imagine
[1:04:42] that in the 1950s and 60s
[1:04:45] when they were starting to preach that
[1:04:48] and just say just let them be who
[1:04:50] they're going to be
[1:04:51] little did they imagine that four and
[1:04:53] five-year-olds
[1:04:54] would be would just decide well i think
[1:04:57] i'm gonna be a boy today but tomorrow
[1:04:59] i'll be a girl
[1:05:02] and now the world who went with that for
[1:05:04] all these decades
[1:05:06] they're stuck and they just kind of have
[1:05:07] to go yeah that's a little weird but
[1:05:09] it's normal
[1:05:12] until now so many people have said it's
[1:05:14] normal that it's normal
[1:05:17] not normal with me not normal with the
[1:05:19] bible
[1:05:20] not norm with god's word see it's
[1:05:23] it's the highest form to to to not train
[1:05:26] your children in the ways of
[1:05:27] the lord is the highest form of of child
[1:05:30] abuse in existence
[1:05:33] because there's there's physical abuses
[1:05:36] that can take place
[1:05:37] and and the world is filled with very
[1:05:39] sad stories
[1:05:41] but but at the same time it's men and
[1:05:43] women who have overcome those physical
[1:05:45] abuses
[1:05:46] who have overcome a lot of those
[1:05:47] psychological abuses
[1:05:49] and have great testimonies how that they
[1:05:51] got past it and made something of
[1:05:53] themselves and
[1:05:54] training other people but i'm here to
[1:05:56] tell you something friends when a soul
[1:05:58] is so corrupted and so poisoned and so
[1:06:01] absent of anything about god
[1:06:03] that's a much worse case
[1:06:08] much worse case because it is not in a
[1:06:10] man the bible teaches us
[1:06:12] this is from the owner's manual now all
[1:06:15] right
[1:06:16] this manufacturer is letting you know
[1:06:19] that he didn't build you with the
[1:06:21] ability to guide your own life
[1:06:24] he gave you 10 senses to contact reality
[1:06:27] around you
[1:06:28] but those were never given to guide you
[1:06:32] see that that that a man needs a guide
[1:06:36] and that's the lord
[1:06:39] prophets need them husbands need them
[1:06:42] mommies need them teenagers need it they
[1:06:45] need a guide they need the holy ghost
[1:06:47] it's not in a man it's not even in his
[1:06:49] wiring it's not in
[1:06:50] it's not installed to guide his own way
[1:06:54] there's got there's got to be an
[1:06:56] over-the-air update by the holy ghost to
[1:06:58] come down and
[1:07:00] and create a new birth and then that
[1:07:02] life force inside you
[1:07:04] now you've got something that'll guide
[1:07:06] you and what is it guiding you say
[1:07:07] is it going to guide me to be a
[1:07:09] millionaire well it might or it might
[1:07:11] you might still stay a pauper but on the
[1:07:13] other side
[1:07:14] you'll have riches and treasures the
[1:07:16] world can't equal
[1:07:18] see so we don't measure our lives by
[1:07:21] succe by the
[1:07:22] world's standard of success what they
[1:07:25] call success is generally ruination
[1:07:30] and that is inarguable historically
[1:07:34] that that you know listen you say well
[1:07:36] if i just had
[1:07:38] a few million dollars there's there's
[1:07:40] people with many millions of dollars who
[1:07:42] jump out of 50 story windows
[1:07:46] many with many millions if i just had
[1:07:49] this many
[1:07:50] you know 100 000 likes and facebook
[1:07:53] friends there's many stars
[1:07:55] with millions of followers who
[1:07:58] overdose on drugs and check out
[1:08:02] you know there's lots of people who
[1:08:04] reach the pinnacle of success
[1:08:06] there's been rich men who were
[1:08:08] billionaires and
[1:08:10] and jumped out a window and in their
[1:08:12] suicide letter
[1:08:14] they discovered that the reason they
[1:08:15] killed themselves was because they were
[1:08:16] down to just a few million dollars and
[1:08:18] couldn't face it
[1:08:22] and these are these are true stories
[1:08:25] and so so you know i i i remember saying
[1:08:29] to this
[1:08:30] this very fine doctor and i said the
[1:08:33] greatest
[1:08:34] sign to the earth is that
[1:08:38] the ministry of the son of man returned
[1:08:42] and he was as clueless as to what that
[1:08:44] meant and so i got my work cut out for
[1:08:46] me you keep praying for me
[1:08:48] but that just stunned him stopped him he
[1:08:50] thought about that for a minute a son of
[1:08:51] man
[1:08:52] okay so the son of man is
[1:08:55] and he's looking for more answers and
[1:08:58] you know that
[1:08:59] that today friends is the greatest sign
[1:09:02] you can look at
[1:09:04] that the ministry of the son of man has
[1:09:06] returned
[1:09:08] when when that's true that means the
[1:09:11] gospel has come all the way west now
[1:09:14] and the next event is a body change the
[1:09:17] next thing is a translation
[1:09:20] and you say but but shouldn't it have
[1:09:22] come shouldn't it have come
[1:09:23] you know 10 years ago well we'd like for
[1:09:26] it to come
[1:09:27] 50 years ago my my sister jeans here
[1:09:30] today sitting in those meetings
[1:09:32] uh wanted it to come you know 60 years
[1:09:34] ago
[1:09:35] but well here we are here she is we're
[1:09:38] still standing
[1:09:39] i i know this i'm going to keep going
[1:09:42] because i i have already seen that it's
[1:09:44] real and i can't deny it i'd have to
[1:09:46] deny my own self
[1:09:48] i have seen the greatest sign i don't
[1:09:51] i don't need to worry about whatever the
[1:09:53] vatican or the kremlin or the
[1:09:55] white house or or the u.n or or china or
[1:09:58] beijing is doing i don't care
[1:10:00] it doesn't matter i've seen the sign
[1:10:02] i've seen his star
[1:10:04] hallelujah and i've already been
[1:10:07] resurrected into new life and i can
[1:10:09] feel myself being changed
[1:10:12] i can feel that my desires are not what
[1:10:16] they used to be
[1:10:17] this is the true uniting time and sign
[1:10:22] eagles gather together why do they
[1:10:24] because there's a carcass to feed on
[1:10:27] see and you know
[1:10:30] this is why that eagles need to gather
[1:10:32] together around the word
[1:10:34] you know as a and more so as we see the
[1:10:38] age going into darkness
[1:10:46] you know sometimes you feel like saying
[1:10:47] to the world
[1:10:50] have you never read have you never been
[1:10:52] taught out of the bible
[1:10:54] that that without this message of grace
[1:10:57] to
[1:10:58] to come on the earth that all
[1:11:01] all humanity including all their
[1:11:04] churches
[1:11:05] are are absolutely uh
[1:11:09] under a death sentence an inescapable
[1:11:12] curse and doom that he promised
[1:11:16] in malachi 4 it's incredible to me
[1:11:20] it takes my breath away that people
[1:11:23] just blow to pieces when you start
[1:11:25] trying to suggest
[1:11:27] that there's a prophet a gentile prophet
[1:11:30] according to malachi
[1:11:31] 4 5 and 6 that would have to come in the
[1:11:33] last days
[1:11:34] and people go nuts over that and without
[1:11:37] any regard to the purpose that he was
[1:11:40] coming
[1:11:41] lest i smite the earth with a curse
[1:11:44] and do you realize that if it were not
[1:11:47] for this message of grace that god
[1:11:49] has sent that message has fulfilled luke
[1:11:52] 17 30
[1:11:53] the earth would have long ago been
[1:11:55] destroyed and everything with it
[1:11:56] but i'm here to tell you god who is rich
[1:11:58] in mercy has fulfilled it
[1:12:01] and we are partakers and we are the
[1:12:03] benefactors of it today
[1:12:06] and and and you know malachi 4 itself is
[1:12:10] actually
[1:12:10] as i've preached many times is is a is a
[1:12:13] divine injunction
[1:12:14] you know to seal the family of god into
[1:12:17] the kingdom
[1:12:19] lest i smite the earth with a curse but
[1:12:21] i'll send elijah quickly
[1:12:23] and he'll come in on a short quick
[1:12:25] demonstration
[1:12:27] gather a bride of gentiles before the
[1:12:30] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[1:12:31] the lord
[1:12:33] and he'll get his mission done and go
[1:12:35] home and it'll perfect the bride and
[1:12:37] it'll just go
[1:12:39] now i know that over decades and decades
[1:12:42] and decades it doesn't feel like
[1:12:46] kind of feels like
[1:12:55] boy i never thought i would have kids
[1:13:00] wow well at least i'll never have
[1:13:02] grandkids
[1:13:03] oh okay i guess i will
[1:13:06] well they'll never go to school
[1:13:10] okay so they went to school
[1:13:15] you know i was i was looking very fondly
[1:13:20] maybe yesterday or the day before i
[1:13:21] don't remember exactly and
[1:13:23] actually came across it actually i think
[1:13:24] i was looking for something else that's
[1:13:26] what it was
[1:13:27] and i stumbled across a picture of
[1:13:30] brother eddie
[1:13:31] uh when he was 10 years old his 10 year
[1:13:32] old boy
[1:13:34] i sit there looking at that joyous
[1:13:35] little face of a 10 year old boy
[1:13:37] who would eventually be my dad and
[1:13:40] he's just 10 years old and he's just
[1:13:42] sitting there all full of hope and life
[1:13:44] and you know and uh
[1:13:47] brother eddie had that smile to the day
[1:13:48] he died he was always friendly everybody
[1:13:50] got around him always liked him he was
[1:13:51] just a
[1:13:52] gregarious jovial fun to be around
[1:13:54] person
[1:13:56] hadn't no had no natural enemies and
[1:13:59] accept the devil and uh
[1:14:02] and i thought wow dad here
[1:14:06] here here you are on a in a picture
[1:14:10] that that snap shotted it just snapshot
[1:14:13] it a moment in history
[1:14:14] it just history was meandering along and
[1:14:17] here's a little boy sit down in front of
[1:14:18] a camera and a camera went click
[1:14:19] and froze that right there and history
[1:14:21] just kept going and that picture just
[1:14:23] froze
[1:14:24] and and it'll never come it'll never
[1:14:26] come back to that and it kept on going
[1:14:29] and i thought now here you are
[1:14:33] and my youngest
[1:14:37] grandchild is older than you were which
[1:14:42] means
[1:14:43] your youngest great
[1:14:46] granddaughter is now
[1:14:50] older than you were in that picture
[1:14:55] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:14:56] life ain't very long
[1:14:58] i know sometimes it just feels like
[1:15:03] but it's not it's zooming
[1:15:06] it's moving so quick you you'll get
[1:15:09] astonished
[1:15:10] you young people will be astonished if
[1:15:12] the lord continues to tarry
[1:15:13] i'm here to tell you something life
[1:15:15] isn't long
[1:15:16] it's over quickly make the most of it
[1:15:19] give your heart to the lord now
[1:15:21] live for him because the life that's
[1:15:23] coming is a very long one
[1:15:25] hallelujah that's the one we're aiming
[1:15:27] at friends that's the one i'm
[1:15:29] encouraging you to believe in today
[1:15:31] make your life count for that life this
[1:15:33] life means very little
[1:15:35] only what you do for god even lasts it
[1:15:38] has no other purpose
[1:15:40] but to prepare you and train you for the
[1:15:43] next world and that's why i say
[1:15:44] this life is not even about this life
[1:15:46] it's only about the next one coming
[1:15:50] you know we have so many counterfeits
[1:15:52] and and
[1:15:53] but but but you know sometimes
[1:15:56] uh i i use as as a lead-in i sometimes
[1:16:00] i'll use that as a lead-in line
[1:16:02] you know witnessing to somebody to talk
[1:16:04] about counterfeits because
[1:16:06] i love that brother branham was such a
[1:16:07] simple man that he he'd put forth these
[1:16:10] little anecdotal things and you just
[1:16:11] kind of go hmm wow
[1:16:12] i mean you can't even argue with it it's
[1:16:14] just too shallow it's too simple
[1:16:16] he just hit his talk you know he'd hit
[1:16:18] he'd talk about
[1:16:20] you know you know if you if you see the
[1:16:23] cows
[1:16:24] you know laying under the tree just
[1:16:26] laying in the shade and
[1:16:27] you know doing what cows do and he said
[1:16:30] they're just laying there
[1:16:31] he said line out of the water boys you
[1:16:34] ain't going to catch nothing
[1:16:36] because if they're not eating the fish
[1:16:38] ain't eating
[1:16:39] because all nature runs in continuity
[1:16:43] and you want to you want to come in here
[1:16:44] and argue with william branham against
[1:16:46] the seventh seal and he just hits you
[1:16:47] with that
[1:16:48] take your water out of the line you're
[1:16:49] not gonna catch any fish you're like
[1:16:53] okay but that's true he's making a very
[1:16:57] simple point
[1:16:59] making a very simple point and and i
[1:17:02] and sometimes i would talk about
[1:17:03] counterfeits and brother branham would
[1:17:04] just say just as simple as anything
[1:17:08] oh you know people say oh you know all
[1:17:11] the hypocrites all the all the
[1:17:12] all the falsity in the christian church
[1:17:15] and brother branham would say well
[1:17:17] you can't really have a counterfeit
[1:17:19] unless you got a reel
[1:17:21] and it's like yeah i mean it's
[1:17:25] it's an inarguable point the counterfeit
[1:17:27] couldn't exist there's no such thing as
[1:17:28] a counterfeit three dollar bill
[1:17:31] in american currency anyway because
[1:17:33] there's never been a corresponding
[1:17:35] real one you understand and so
[1:17:38] the very so watch the very fact
[1:17:42] that there is a counterfeit proves
[1:17:45] without ever seeing it it proves there's
[1:17:47] a real somewhere
[1:17:50] with all the counterfeits you know but
[1:17:52] but i like to say to somebody yeah the
[1:17:54] world is filled with counterfeits but
[1:17:56] hey
[1:17:57] what if you could have something that
[1:17:58] was back to the original again
[1:18:00] what do you want that what if you could
[1:18:02] have something that could really make
[1:18:03] this book come alive
[1:18:05] in your home and in your life and in
[1:18:06] your children and then people start
[1:18:08] wow they've never you realize that in
[1:18:11] mass friends
[1:18:12] people in churches today they're they're
[1:18:15] preaching from empty wells they're
[1:18:17] firing blanks as brother ernie says
[1:18:19] you give them just a little bit of the
[1:18:21] revealed word and it's
[1:18:23] it's like astonishing to people
[1:18:26] don't hesitate i'm here to tell you
[1:18:27] something today you know not you do not
[1:18:29] have to back up
[1:18:30] every teaching in this message is
[1:18:33] incontrovertibly proven
[1:18:34] in the bible it's that you can't contend
[1:18:37] with it because it's from genesis to
[1:18:39] revelation
[1:18:40] tell somebody about it don't be afraid
[1:18:43] study it learn it you have the words of
[1:18:47] eternal life to give out
[1:18:49] you have back to the original again that
[1:18:51] you're not offering them a counterfeit
[1:18:53] you're offering them
[1:18:54] something that can reproduce the
[1:18:56] original
[1:18:59] the bible and i'm i'm going to run out
[1:19:00] of time here quickly let me come to a
[1:19:02] second thought that's
[1:19:04] included in this and it's inescapable
[1:19:09] you know the bible and we won't take the
[1:19:11] time to i'd slow myself down and i've
[1:19:13] just got a few minutes left
[1:19:15] and i'll i'll enlarge on this so i'm
[1:19:17] just going to touch it today and we're
[1:19:18] going to close
[1:19:21] the bible talks about
[1:19:24] people who will forsake the truth at the
[1:19:28] end time
[1:19:30] that what you see happening doesn't
[1:19:32] catch
[1:19:33] god off guard at all and shouldn't even
[1:19:35] by any means amaze you
[1:19:38] the scripture is very clear and i'll go
[1:19:39] into the scriptures with you next time
[1:19:41] that it that just that the language is
[1:19:44] so descriptive you almost get a visual
[1:19:47] of people who've done it it's so
[1:19:49] accurate
[1:19:50] that they actually turn around and begin
[1:19:52] to oppose it
[1:19:54] and actually they don't just leave it
[1:19:56] saying i can't live it
[1:19:58] you know and that's that's not a the end
[1:20:01] of the world
[1:20:02] because brother branham said hey i would
[1:20:04] much rather face god
[1:20:06] as a sinner than face him as a hypocrite
[1:20:09] say don't whatever you do don't be a
[1:20:11] hypocrite
[1:20:12] if if you don't got the real goods fall
[1:20:14] at an altar and
[1:20:16] talk it over with god you have a right
[1:20:19] you have a divine right every child of
[1:20:21] god brother ram says has a god-given
[1:20:22] right to have a conference with god
[1:20:25] nobody can deny you that no devil can
[1:20:28] stop that
[1:20:30] you understand it's given to you a
[1:20:32] divine right
[1:20:33] when you were born built in the image of
[1:20:36] god you have a right to have a
[1:20:38] conference with god
[1:20:40] you don't need a pass an invitation you
[1:20:42] don't need a code
[1:20:44] you don't need nothing you you no
[1:20:46] passphrase
[1:20:47] you you you have the right to go to your
[1:20:49] knees
[1:20:50] bow your head humbly approach the maker
[1:20:53] of the whole universe
[1:20:55] you have the privilege to a direct
[1:20:57] audience
[1:20:59] say how would you like to get in to see
[1:21:00] the pope what a secretary
[1:21:03] why would i want to go see that i want
[1:21:04] to go see the main man
[1:21:08] he's not even a good secretary
[1:21:09] [Laughter]
[1:21:12] takes all the credit himself man give me
[1:21:14] the give me the real person
[1:21:16] you have access to that
[1:21:20] and the bible talks about how that this
[1:21:23] will take place in numerous places and
[1:21:25] that's why i'm not going to try to go
[1:21:26] down the trail of the scriptures today
[1:21:30] but as it comes on down
[1:21:33] it talks and then it changes gears and
[1:21:35] the apostle starts talking to the church
[1:21:37] about
[1:21:38] make sure that you have fervent love one
[1:21:41] for another
[1:21:44] that that that element of love is going
[1:21:46] to be
[1:21:47] paramount you just don't know how
[1:21:51] paramount that you have that
[1:21:54] fervent love i'm gonna tell you
[1:21:56] something friends as this thing gets
[1:21:58] darker and darker and you say it can't
[1:21:59] possibly get darker oh it it can
[1:22:03] it can get monumentally darker we don't
[1:22:05] know what all
[1:22:06] we'll have to face we're still in the
[1:22:08] middle of a global pandemic
[1:22:10] we don't know what tomorrow holds i i
[1:22:13] remember saying to you at the very
[1:22:14] beginning of this thing hey
[1:22:16] when this one's over there'll be five
[1:22:17] more behind that one
[1:22:19] and when those five there'll be ten more
[1:22:20] behind that one the world's burning down
[1:22:23] it's the end of all things brother
[1:22:24] branham says don't even
[1:22:26] bother writing new history books ain't
[1:22:28] going to be nobody around to read them
[1:22:31] we're going home friends hallelujah
[1:22:34] it's homegoing time and i'm so thrilled
[1:22:36] to be a part of it
[1:22:38] i'm so glad it's come in my generation
[1:22:40] say oh i'd like to have an easier
[1:22:42] generation
[1:22:43] well how would you define easier what
[1:22:46] what
[1:22:46] what's what's your definition of great i
[1:22:48] want to come into the
[1:22:49] most perfect image of god to me that's
[1:22:51] the greatest grandest
[1:22:53] most a wonderful privilege that i could
[1:22:55] ever hope for
[1:22:56] is that i get the opportunity to become
[1:23:00] just like jesus christ and i don't even
[1:23:03] have to worry about being able to do it
[1:23:06] he's doing it through me by the word
[1:23:09] that i'm feeding on
[1:23:10] and you can rely on the word it is
[1:23:13] working
[1:23:14] i'm here to tell you it's working he's
[1:23:16] doing more in you than you know
[1:23:21] and here we are oh my
[1:23:25] and and sure enough now they've already
[1:23:27] got one that's even more contagious and
[1:23:30] they're hoping against hope that that
[1:23:32] the vaccine they won't have to start
[1:23:34] from scratch that this vaccine will
[1:23:35] well uh head that one off too and it's
[1:23:37] much more contagious than the one that
[1:23:39] already seems like enormously contagious
[1:23:44] and what do you where's your goals what
[1:23:49] do you
[1:23:49] hope to accomplish by staying
[1:23:52] right i mean why would i want to own buy
[1:23:55] a house that's burning down
[1:23:59] you think you can i could convince you
[1:24:01] to do that
[1:24:03] and yet the devil has a lot of success
[1:24:06] in convincing us
[1:24:09] and invest more in this world invest
[1:24:11] more in this world why
[1:24:14] when i go in front of the mirror i think
[1:24:17] i'm okay until i walk by the mirror and
[1:24:18] go oh let me see oh man
[1:24:20] wow i need to make some changes
[1:24:26] let the word do that to you
[1:24:30] could i give you that advice today let
[1:24:33] the word
[1:24:33] do that to you stand in front of it read
[1:24:37] it
[1:24:37] it's a mirror it'll show don't whatever
[1:24:40] you do
[1:24:40] don't make the mistake that the apostle
[1:24:42] warned us about
[1:24:44] by saying people come into church
[1:24:47] and they hear the word of god preached
[1:24:51] and it shows them really who they are
[1:24:54] and what manner of man they are and
[1:24:56] where their deficits are and where their
[1:24:58] problems are
[1:24:59] and they rejoice in it while they're
[1:25:01] under that atmosphere do you know why
[1:25:03] that's not
[1:25:04] that's not accidental do you know why
[1:25:06] that happens
[1:25:07] because the preaching of the gospel
[1:25:10] drives back demons the preaching of the
[1:25:13] gospel cast out devils
[1:25:15] you can come in this into this building
[1:25:17] with your mind set on being a sinner
[1:25:19] and hear the word of god preach and
[1:25:21] suddenly you're not sure if you should
[1:25:22] be
[1:25:24] that's not an accident that's magic
[1:25:26] that's supernatural
[1:25:28] see that's real man that's not harry
[1:25:29] potter magic that's real magic
[1:25:32] you understand it drives back spirits of
[1:25:34] unbelief
[1:25:35] so that then the holy spirit can come
[1:25:37] and start dealing with your heart he's
[1:25:38] not going to stand there
[1:25:39] and put up with the devil he's going to
[1:25:41] drive him back he
[1:25:43] the holy spirit's going to going to say
[1:25:45] to the preacher and it might not even be
[1:25:46] in the preacher's notes
[1:25:48] and the holy spirit's going to go going
[1:25:50] to cast a a scripture into his mind and
[1:25:53] give him an inspiration
[1:25:54] and he'll leave his notes and start
[1:25:55] preaching why is that happening
[1:25:57] because god's fighting a devil for your
[1:26:00] life
[1:26:01] and he's standing there and the devil's
[1:26:02] trying to resist it and god turns to his
[1:26:04] servant says
[1:26:05] preach this say the out of the bible and
[1:26:07] the preacher comes off of his notes and
[1:26:09] you never know a thing about it
[1:26:10] and he starts preaching under
[1:26:12] inspiration and that demon starts
[1:26:13] getting driven back
[1:26:14] because you start believing it and god
[1:26:17] starts pouring it on
[1:26:18] i say pour it on lord pour it on lord
[1:26:20] pour it on lord
[1:26:23] that's what the power of the gospel is
[1:26:25] to do is to drive away
[1:26:26] demon spirits
[1:26:30] the mistake comes when after god
[1:26:34] does that and you don't see it it's
[1:26:36] happening in a dimension you can't see
[1:26:38] but it's happening
[1:26:40] demons howling and screaming it's
[1:26:43] happening
[1:26:44] the holy spirit running them off out of
[1:26:46] your life it's happening
[1:26:48] what happens is the apostles said
[1:26:51] then you get up you get dismissed in
[1:26:53] jesus name
[1:26:55] the song leader sings a few more songs
[1:26:57] while the people slowly trickle out
[1:26:59] and you go right out that door and the
[1:27:02] bible says
[1:27:03] and you forget the kind of man
[1:27:06] that the word showed you you really were
[1:27:10] and you get thinking i'm okay
[1:27:14] and those and the holy spirit just says
[1:27:16] well
[1:27:17] and those demons come right back along
[1:27:19] yeah buddy you're fine
[1:27:20] come on man you didn't need all that
[1:27:23] anyway
[1:27:28] let that demon keep doing that and he
[1:27:30] will come on buddy
[1:27:32] all the way to hell that's where he's
[1:27:35] trying to take you
[1:27:38] but you don't have to go there i'm so
[1:27:41] glad
[1:27:42] that god rich in mercy made a way for
[1:27:45] you understand this principle friends
[1:27:47] god will never send a man to hell who
[1:27:48] don't want to go
[1:27:50] and i don't want to go there i want to i
[1:27:52] look at the stars i'm like david i look
[1:27:54] at those galaxies and
[1:27:55] all those auroras and i look at those
[1:27:58] nebulas and i
[1:27:59] i just say that vast expanse and i want
[1:28:01] to be a part of that kingdom i know
[1:28:03] that's going to be used someday
[1:28:05] lord i want to be a part of it i don't
[1:28:06] want this shallow little life here
[1:28:09] this life let them have whatever they
[1:28:11] chase it chase it jason go ahead but not
[1:28:13] me
[1:28:14] not me i'm i'm chasing this i'm chasing
[1:28:17] eternal life
[1:28:18] i've seen the greatest sign that the
[1:28:20] world should ever see
[1:28:21] it's become a part of me
[1:28:24] [Music]
[1:28:26] that divine love is going to be so
[1:28:28] important
[1:28:31] because and i'm going to say this and
[1:28:33] close i i got to stop
[1:28:36] come on back matt bring your team
[1:28:40] let me just make this couple of comments
[1:28:42] i'll enlarge on this don't
[1:28:44] think you won't get the whole seven
[1:28:46] course meal on it
[1:28:49] because the lord's still cooking it this
[1:28:52] is a little appetizer
[1:28:57] i just want to say this and we'll stop
[1:28:59] whatever you're choosing son
[1:29:04] the bible say why why would the
[1:29:07] why would the apostle
[1:29:10] go to all this trouble to describe
[1:29:14] men in the end time turning away and
[1:29:16] doing this and doing that and
[1:29:18] everything turning upside down and then
[1:29:21] he would like flip the script and go
[1:29:23] now you're going to need this fervent
[1:29:24] love
[1:29:27] because say does the bible say that yes
[1:29:30] it does
[1:29:31] and the bible also says that in the last
[1:29:34] days
[1:29:37] some a lot of things are going to happen
[1:29:40] in the last days
[1:29:42] that have that are not unique in history
[1:29:44] but they're unique in the fact that
[1:29:45] they're going to be amplified to a level
[1:29:47] they've never been amplified
[1:29:50] where men will be heady and high-minded
[1:29:53] traitors see
[1:29:58] lovers of self
[1:30:02] more than lovers of god
[1:30:06] and so now here comes the apostle to say
[1:30:09] when you start seeing
[1:30:10] all of this turmoil happening you're
[1:30:12] going to need fervent love
[1:30:15] because the world is going to love
[1:30:18] itself
[1:30:20] and this is what this is what
[1:30:25] makes you stumble
[1:30:28] anytime you stumble you stumble i
[1:30:32] stumble
[1:30:33] come on we stumble thank god for the
[1:30:35] blood
[1:30:38] but why do you stumble
[1:30:42] because you're loving yourself more
[1:30:45] you've got that thing that you like you
[1:30:48] want to do it
[1:30:49] you're enticed by it and you know it's
[1:30:52] contrary to god's word
[1:30:55] but you do it anyway you know what you
[1:30:56] just did you loved yourself more than
[1:30:58] you loved his word
[1:31:00] because his word told you don't do that
[1:31:03] you're almost home lay aside
[1:31:06] the weights and sins but i kind of like
[1:31:08] that sin that and that weight you know
[1:31:10] we're pretty
[1:31:11] pretty good friends no lay aside
[1:31:14] because you're you're at the point of a
[1:31:16] race now where you can't walk anymore
[1:31:18] you have to run
[1:31:20] you have to run you cross the finish
[1:31:21] line you need to be running
[1:31:25] parents are ineffective parents because
[1:31:27] they love themselves more than their
[1:31:28] children
[1:31:32] i'm not trying to come to the end of my
[1:31:34] sermon and lock you all down
[1:31:35] i just want to say that that happens
[1:31:39] parents are not always effective as they
[1:31:43] need to be because they put their own
[1:31:46] desires above
[1:31:47] the needs of training up their children
[1:31:49] in the way that they should go
[1:31:53] and if and if you're like that you never
[1:31:54] had kids
[1:31:56] and if you were never going to have kids
[1:31:57] you should never got married
[1:31:59] that's truth stop loving yourself
[1:32:03] start loving his word so i'm going to
[1:32:06] make this choice for my life well
[1:32:09] if it's a choice if it's an opportunity
[1:32:11] god has given you take it
[1:32:13] goodness well he'll bless you in it make
[1:32:15] sure it's his word
[1:32:16] but don't love yourself so much that you
[1:32:18] take it and you kind of you won't go
[1:32:20] look in the mirror on that anymore
[1:32:22] because you know if you looked in that
[1:32:23] mirror you go um wow
[1:32:26] brother branham said people would do
[1:32:28] that memory preachers
[1:32:29] he said preachers who sit in their study
[1:32:33] and they come across a scripture that
[1:32:36] talk about these signs shall follow that
[1:32:38] believer they come across the scripture
[1:32:39] baptizing in jesus name
[1:32:40] and brother branham said quickly they
[1:32:42] turn the page because they
[1:32:44] they don't want to read what's there let
[1:32:46] me get over here okay i can read this
[1:32:50] don't do god like that
[1:32:54] don't do his word like that
[1:32:58] you you've not only seen the greatest
[1:33:00] sign that was to strike the world you
[1:33:03] are
[1:33:04] the greatest sign
[1:33:05] [Music]
[1:33:07] absolutely i could there's so much more
[1:33:09] i want to say on that but i'm going to
[1:33:10] stop let's stand
[1:33:14] have fervent love one for another
[1:33:16] friends
[1:33:18] this is the hour where we're going to
[1:33:19] need it
[1:33:21] is the hour of perfect faith
[1:33:24] that could only come because god gave us
[1:33:26] a perfect word
[1:33:28] the greatest sign i i wish i could
[1:33:32] persuade the whole world
[1:33:35] you know i guess god hasn't given me the
[1:33:37] burden
[1:33:38] like he gave a prophet to persuade the
[1:33:40] whole world i just wish i could persuade
[1:33:42] this whole city
[1:33:43] that god has placed me in to say
[1:33:47] come into the doors at 2608 mossy oaks
[1:33:51] road
[1:33:52] i want to show you the greatest sign of
[1:33:54] the end time
[1:33:56] right here they are people living
[1:34:01] impossibly living standards that are
[1:34:04] impossible to live
[1:34:06] except god is doing it through it's too
[1:34:09] outside the mainstream it's too off the
[1:34:11] beaten path
[1:34:12] but i'm here to tell you that's the way
[1:34:14] god's family has always been
[1:34:16] amen i want you to bow your heads with
[1:34:19] me
[1:34:20] and i'm just trying to feel my way along

[1:34:46] get my mind around this burden of the
[1:34:48] word for the people that you've been

[1:45:52] interest you're serving his
[1:45:56] i want to before we go
[1:46:00] uh we had a special prayer request come
[1:46:02] in last night and
[1:46:05] you know in one sense it's a sad thing
[1:46:07] because it's the departing of a loved
[1:46:08] one
[1:46:10] but brother brad's mother passed away
[1:46:12] last night and she's been
[1:46:14] sick and she was elderly it's not wasn't
[1:46:16] unexpected
[1:46:18] but you know brother brad he said to me
[1:46:21] he said brother jason he said i've been
[1:46:24] witnessing to them for 33 years
[1:46:28] and you know i i felt like in my heart
[1:46:32] i only had one possible response to that
[1:46:36] i said brother brad i would hold that
[1:46:39] faith in my heart till the day i died
[1:46:42] and i said brother baby said you take
[1:46:44] that faith to your grave even if you
[1:46:47] never see it happen
[1:46:48] he said on resurrection morning he said
[1:46:51] that faith will still be burning in your
[1:46:53] heart and god will have to answer to it
[1:46:55] then
[1:46:56] aren't you glad for that and i said
[1:46:58] brother you believe it
[1:47:00] you that's not a battle i have my
[1:47:02] mother's long ago
[1:47:04] uh given her heart to the lord but
[1:47:05] here's here's
[1:47:07] here's brother brad my mother's long ago
[1:47:08] been a believer here's brother brad
[1:47:10] believing for
[1:47:11] more than three decades and then see his
[1:47:13] mother depart
[1:47:14] and even the last couple of years and
[1:47:18] slipping away slowly but
[1:47:21] how many will pray for our brother today
[1:47:25] now there's no no need to pray for her
[1:47:27] she's gone on
[1:47:29] but i want to pray for his faith i want
[1:47:32] i want brother brad to feel the promise
[1:47:36] of the holy spirit
[1:47:38] i want him to feel the surety of the
[1:47:40] word of god
[1:47:41] to say i have not run in vain i have not
[1:47:44] prayed in vain
[1:47:45] i have not believed in vain how many
[1:47:48] will do it
[1:47:50] and you think now what i want you to do
[1:47:52] i want you to put brother brad's image
[1:47:53] in your mind
[1:47:54] as we pray because i don't i don't
[1:47:57] it's it's you know when god keeps a
[1:48:00] promise like this where are you going to
[1:48:02] find
[1:48:02] sadness in it i mean you know there's
[1:48:05] i remember saying to a young woman one
[1:48:07] time
[1:48:09] she wasn't sure about her mother and in
[1:48:11] fact is it it looked for all
[1:48:14] practical purposes that wouldn't be a
[1:48:16] whole lot of hope there
[1:48:17] but this girl was a christian and i said
[1:48:20] sister
[1:48:20] we're not talking about basing something
[1:48:23] on
[1:48:24] her inheritance you don't have any but
[1:48:25] you do
[1:48:27] so you've got an inheritance use your
[1:48:29] own inheritance and say lord i said i'm
[1:48:31] tell you right now
[1:48:32] if this was my mama and she was on
[1:48:34] deathbed dying as an unbeliever i said
[1:48:36] i'd claim her
[1:48:36] immediately i wouldn't even blink think
[1:48:39] twice pass go do nothing
[1:48:41] i'd make a claim i'd raise my hand to
[1:48:43] god and say i claim her
[1:48:45] as my reward all based on my inheritance
[1:48:49] for god's kingdom somewhere at some
[1:48:51] level somehow
[1:48:52] i'm going to tell you i believed it then
[1:48:54] that was almost 20 plus years ago i
[1:48:56] believe it today
[1:48:58] even more so i have a vested interest
[1:49:00] actually
[1:49:01] in believing that how about you
[1:49:06] let's bow our heads before we go
[1:49:08] [Music]
[1:49:09] father i i hope that
[1:49:13] something that i've said and i believe
[1:49:16] it
[1:49:16] i i don't just hope it i actually
[1:49:18] believe
[1:49:19] lord that brother brad is receiving the
[1:49:22] strength of the word and the promise of
[1:49:24] god's word
[1:49:25] they got to take a journey lord he just
[1:49:27] came back from a journey and sister
[1:49:29] rebecca
[1:49:30] there's been sadness in that family so
[1:49:32] lord
[1:49:33] as as his extended church family
[1:49:36] we're lifting them up before you for
[1:49:39] strength today
[1:49:40] we're lifting them up before you for
[1:49:42] faith today
[1:49:44] lord we're believing father that you'll
[1:49:46] go with them on this journey
[1:49:47] provide for their needs lord uh and
[1:49:50] and and above all things may our brother
[1:49:53] go into an atmosphere
[1:49:55] where there no doubt be sadness and
