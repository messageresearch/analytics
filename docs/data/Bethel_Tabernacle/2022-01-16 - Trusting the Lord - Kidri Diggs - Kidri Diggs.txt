of what you called us to be we bless your name in the name of jesus christ we pray church amen amen praise the lord if you have your bibles let's go to first samuel chapter 30 first samuel uh chapter 30. i made to the brothers in the sound booth i may have a scripture or quote i forgot to send to you but i know you guys are quick on the trigger so i know you'll probably catch it first samuel chapter 30. um let's just let's just break into let's start at verse three well let's just start at verse one the bible says and it came to pass when david and his men were come to zig lag on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the south of zig lag and smitten zlag and burned it with fire and had taken the women captives that were therein they slew not any either either great or small but carried them away and went on their way so david and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive then david and then david and the people that were with him lifted up their voices and wept and they had no and wept until they had no more power to weak my that's what you call mourning right there they say and david and david's two wives were taken captives a hennano a hindu norm the jezreelite and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and david was greatly distressed for the people's spake of stoning him because the soul of all the people were grieved every man for his son and for his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lord god oh my let's go to um first kings first kings chapter 17. first kings chapter 17 to make the reading show let's go to um let's start at verse 11. and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little all in the curse in a cruise and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die and elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but make make me there for a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son my that's a great request verse uh um psalms chapter 37 verse 3. psalm 37 verse 3 the bible says trust in the lord and do good so shall thou so shall thou dwell in the land and verily thou shall be fed delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee thy desires the desires of thy heart commit thy way unto the lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass amen lord bless reading of his word you can have your seats you know today by the by the grace of god i want to use for a subject something very familiar to us but sometimes i think we need to hit the refresh button amen you know you have with a computer you have a computer it has everything there but sometimes a little uh uh a little something may get inside that they call a virus or something it may get inside you have to clean it and refresh everything that it that it needs is already there you just got to get all the junk out the way so sometimes serving the law we got to hit the refresh button there's nothing wrong with god and let me tell you sometimes there's nothing wrong with us but just the way we're perceiving things and sometimes you have to come and and just hit the reset button or refresh and and and whatever you're dealing with start all over from there but today my subject by the grace of god is trust in the lord hallelujah trust in the lord how many can say amen to that you know it takes a person to trust in lord to to be able to trust in god you got to have faith in god amen you know and the reason why i i read these scriptures is if we could just take psalms 37 the bible says delight thyself in the lord and he'll give you the desires of your heart now he's not saying come to church because it's a duty he's not saying sing songs because everybody else is singing he's saying let this be a part of who you are you know delight yourself in the things of god and he will give you the desires of your heart even when it don't look like it's it's moving according to your favor you have to delight yourself in the law hey man you know as as a as i look at the scripture let's just back up to david you know in the book of psalms you know david then went out to battle you know and and everybody he went to pretty much god gave him the victory but this time church the enemy snuck in while he was fighting hallelujah isn't that just like the devil when you serving god doing your best the enemy coming sneaking and trying to take your children he'll come in and mess up your job he'll come in and try to mess up relationships he's very sneaky while you're in position doing what you're supposed to do but one thing we got to realize about this scripture hallelujah the bible says nobody was harmed hallelujah amen church that's the place we got to be in the devil can do things things can happen but ultimately god is in control so we have to have a mindset as long as you can pray about it everything is all right hallelujah as long as you can pray about it at any time any moment god can change the situation but you know what what what's what's strange to me is that david was a man of the god's very own heart and the people knew that the people knew that david was a god-fearing man david had men of war standing behind him but in this moment not only was david affected but everybody that followed david was affected and now they're looking to blame somebody because wives have been captive children have been captive and all the different loved ones have been taken captive and the only one they could blame they're saying david we got to blame you because we're following you i thought god was in control hallelujah how often do we look for something to blame when we're supposed to be trusting in the lord holy are any of us bold enough to say god why are you doing this i blame you god don't we realize everything that happens is for our good but what happens is the reason why we can't see it because we're too busy looking at the clouds we're looking at the clouds but the knowledge of having experience with god there should be something in your life to encourage you to go beyond the clouds that's what the bible says the bible says the uh the people that david was leading all those those great men and and soldiers who stood by side they wept and they cried so much until they got in their minds and in their thoughts to got back to david that they wanted to kill david can you imagine how david felt all the sacrifices he's done for them all the wars he's fought for the people of god now these people he's loved are ready to turn their back on how do you think a pastor feels when you stay home do you think a song leader feels when he's singing and worshiping you just sitting there like [Music] oh my this stuff is for you hallelujah what god is doing is for you amen and you know uh one thing i love about david david although he was he had many experiences and he was a man of war david knew how to wait on god david knew how to trust in the lord no matter what it looked like can you imagine both of his wives are gone children being taken captive no doubt people in this camp that he loves children that probably came up and said oh hey king david killed him that he knew by name they were taken so david was hurting too but the consolation of it is church the bible says nobody was harmed oh hallelujah you take a loved one a child or a family member whoever goes out in the world to us it looks like they're in a bad situation but the bible says nobody was harmed why because god is shaping and molding hallelujah to fit his will we have to stop looking at things through a natural eye hallelujah god is in control amen and you know church let me read you let me read you a quote real quick hallelujah you know you know as i was thinking about uh trust and you know how we got to have faith a level of faith and trust now this quote i'm going to read i forgot to send it to you brothers but it's in the message of the the the junction time uh 56 it's going to start at paragraph 36 but i'm going to kind of break in at the end of it trust in the lord everybody say with me trust in the lord now i'm feeling i'm gonna throw i'm gonna throw a fastball at you real quick and i'm gonna throw this to the people who are at home who should have been here real quick reason why some people didn't come this morning because of the rain they were looking at circumstances and situations and they let circumcision situations stop them hallelujah from reaching their goal hallelujah when some of us were like hey it's raining but hey i got to go i got to get there it's raining but you know god is in control hallelujah i'm going to trust in the lord we're not trusting in our vehicles we're not trusting in the in how good we can drive what we're trusting is that our god is our protector hallelujah but if you're not careful you'll get an economy and you put your trust on your own human ability that's what some people did this morning they put their trust in their own human ability well i don't drive good in the rain i thought we were trusting in the lord still love you now don't cut me off i know some of you say man this is live i wish i could skip this part too bad hallelujah but you know it's too often church we live in the realm of the five senses when god is trying to get us to live in the realm of faith holly in the supersense amen you know let me read this church he says at the last part of this quote he says god reveals himself the way he wants to to to to people he wants to listen to that god reveals himself the way he wants to to people the way he wants to now let me explain to you how god revealed himself to me now when my parents got saved hallelujah they came into this message they were they were going to church in the basement of one of the saints house because it was all new and fresh i think 1984-83 something like that it was new and fresh and they didn't have a church so they was coming out of pentecost to church amen so they was meeting in one of the saints basement and you know my mom used to say hey son you're going to church with me i say who church who church what that is church no not me i'm good she said okay i'm gonna pray for you and she go every every time security goes to say son you come to church she always mess with me because i'm the youngest everybody else grown she said son you go to church i say i ain't got it in the way she said it doesn't matter what you got to wait because in my mind i'm thinking i got to come like this and now that i'm converted i love coming like this hallelujah hallelujah i got a revelation hallelujah that i'm a king son hallelujah so if i'm a king son i want to look like it i love looking like royalty you know sometimes i have to church i go into the store just dress like this now i could be a doctor lawyer a businessman but when i get behind the counter they say how was church today hallelujah it's the representation amen but back to my story you know uh and i'm not saying you got to wear a suit i say i like to oh yeah you know but uh she's coming she say son you're going to church today say no i'm good and she just keep coming keep coming say we're going to go to church tonight i'll say i got in the way she said you can wear what you got on i said come on mama what kind of church is that she said you can come as you are let's clear that up that's what people love to say they love to use that say well god says come as you are amen come his dial amen but he's saying that but he's really meaning come but don't remain in that condition hallelujah that's what too many people do they come to church and they never get converted they never get any joy they never get any healing they never grow in god but they in church yeah we want you to come as you are but we want you to change we don't want you to remain in that condition we want you to grow in grace did you hear me church when you come to church what is god doing he's helping you to grow in grace what we're experiencing this morning is a level of grace get brother matt my jacket just now i felt the devil swing at me in the spirit hallelujah but she keep going on and she said son you going to church going to church like now i ain't going i ain't going so she just prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed for me now he says we get into this quote i hope you guys can find it but he said god reveals himself the way he wants to to people he wants to now my mom her way of god revealing himself to me was for her to keep asking me to come to church and maybe i'll hear something the preacher is saying and i'll get converted but god's way that he was gonna introduce himself to me was to allow me to get cancer in my brain [Music] hallelujah he reveals himself the way he wants to holy church i never made it to the basement hallelujah as many times they had church i never made it there but god in his sovereign way he was he was basically hallelujah he had a plan which my mom didn't really understand but she had to trust in god hallelujah so she prayed and prayed and kept praying god says okay i'mma get him there but i'm gonna give him the way nobody's expecting hallelujah i'm gonna allow him to have cancer in his brain and what cats is gonna do cass is gonna bring up one of my attributes hallelujah because i placed in him before the foundation of the world a revelation called jehovah russia and it took cancer to bring that piece of god out that was there hallelujah it took character hallelujah to reveal the goodness of god in my life but if you're not trusting in god you panic oh lord my job's gonna die no this is just the introduction hallelujah so god introduced himself through the to me by the way of by the way of cancer isn't that something god used something that the devil thought was strong and used it to make me strong because you know what hallelujah just like david them even though i had cancer nobody was hurt i got stronger in grace god introduced himself hallelujah and not only through cancer my faith was quickened hallelujah because i had to i in life i had to learn personally myself to trust in god because they said okay now you got to take cause you got you got a brain tumor it's running through your body we gonna get what we can get y'all to heard this testimony before but i i believe it's for somebody amen he says he said she said they said the doctors say hey uh we need him to do chemo and radiation because once we start the cutting the cancer is going to spread hallelujah so they they they acknowledge the cancer they begin to tell a story about if you don't take this this is gonna happen you don't take that just go have it all the stuff they were telling me is in the natural realm but my mother trusting in god she comes into the room with the word hallelujah she comes in with the message hallelujah and now she's trusting in god how she's introducing me into the scripture she's introducing me to isaiah 53 hallelujah let me tell you something the word of god will never return to you lord if you speak the word it has to accomplish what that word was sent out for can i get amen hallelujah i'm talking to you children of god when you speak the word it has to accomplish what you spoken for amen are we not god's people hallelujah did we not have a messenger that came and restored the power of the spoken word back in the church hallelujah so when we speak we have to learn to just sit back and wait and trust in god and let him finish hallelujah the work now it might not look like it's anything taking place but we're not dealing with looks hallelujah some of you may look at your spouse and be like man i got the beautifulest thing in the world and somebody else may be looking at your spouse like what in the world they seeing them we're not dealing with looks we're dealing with compatibility in church we are compatible with the message of the seventh church age angel hallelujah we are compatible with the opening of the seals no they're not closed they're open hallelujah we're compatible amen with the revelation of the seven church ages and let me tell you some church there's another church age amen hallelujah they're looking at me oh my god he's off on the scripture he says there's another church age yes we're living in it what is it it's called the bride age hallelujah church we're living in the eighth day amen we're not stuck in light of the sin anymore we're living by our desire we delight ourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart that's the age that's the day that's the time the bride is supposed to be living in church we have to catch it god sent the messenger and he gave us a paradigm shift we're not living in a huddle a church age holding a wicked church now we're living alone with god remember he comes in he says i no longer call you church but i call you what pride it was a separation let me get off this why am i going this way hallelujah i don't want to go here amen but it's your pull somebody's happy about what god has revealed amen but church what looked like a a mess was really god put me in position to shake my tree he shook my tree hardly he allowed me to have cancer in my brain but that was the best thing that could ever happen to me one thing i want you young people to know i won't i won't uh those of you who are struggling the lord it's best to listen while you can listen because if god gets to whipping you he gonna give you an experience you'll never forget hallelujah church now i probably would have never had to experience cancer if i just went to church [Music] because i got i had several invitations several invitations and i knew it was true because i seen my mother's life change when she came in this message she probably never sees us but we just get a whipping for breathing wrong you know some of our keys is we go in the store and they see something they want they be like and we were like bobby jessica no no no no we got we got bible name sharon rose don't you do that marion don't you do that still unconverted spirits with that powerful name hallelujah but we'll see somebody else kid in a store acting crazy falls all on the ground and we're not doing anything she'll just look at us if you ever get that in your mind you see i'm gonna be on you like zorro no no and then it comes so fast it's like the good the bad dog before you know you didn't pop out power like what did i do but i seen the compassion of god coming alive when she got converted through this message hallelujah she had a little bit more grace a little bit more understanding hey i want you to understand if you got a parent that talks to you and try to see where you're coming from don't take that kindness as a weakness what they're trying to do they're trying to meet you halfway but what happens sometimes kids hallelujah they buff up a little bit y'all know what y'all talking about and this and that blah blah blah i'm going through those and you go dude it's like no child if you want i can shut you down all the way down but because we have grace and abundant grace we try to extend that grace come on parents hallelujah but look church god introducing himself and my mama got to trust in the lord and know that god is going to bring me through this the greatest thing hollywood that affects us in our homes and whatever else we're doing in the economy of god is fear hallelujah fear you know some of you didn't confess fear over your life you said not me brother not me in in natural conversations you might say something like well it's my anxiety i can't because my my anxiety you know i you know i i try to do this and my anxiety do you realize you're claiming an evil [Applause] you're spirit fear over your life i've heard ministers and preachers claim anxiety fear that's what this whole thing a covet is about fear got the whole world in fear honey living in an atmosphere of fear people walking around with mass and now they're double master next thing you know they're gonna be walking around with ski masks on why because the atmosphere of fear let me explain something by the grace yes people are getting sick but the spirit hasn't changed it's still the same old spirit what's making this stronger fear hallelujah they say oh i'm going out i'm gonna be double masking oh we gotta get a k-54 now whatever they call us new masks man's got got titles and names now hallelujah oh my yeah we rendered to cedars what is caesars but like i told a friend of mine if i forget my mass you know what i'm living by god is my protector hallelujah but you know what reasoning nowadays where people take the scripture and reason with god being my protector i say yes god my protector and then they'll come back and say but yeah you don't want to tempt the lord i'm tempting god by asking him to protect me hey do what do whatever you pass to tell you don't follow brother diggs hallelujah because it's an individual journey what i'm saying is don't live in fear you've got to trust in the lord hollywood church where do we see whether we see the scripture where man lost his faith and trust in god holy in the book of genesis amen i believe they had faith in god they listened to the voice of god god would come down in the cool of the day they never were afraid they trusted in god they had their lives in god's hand they could stand before god naked and not be ashamed because they knew god would never harm them but as soon as they got from behind the word and did the wrong thing god in his faithfulness came down like he always did god never changed but they lost their trust in him they lost their faith in him what was it it was fear fear was one of the what oh my fear was one of the first attributes manifested in the garden because they went from having service and worshipping the lord to now listen listen to what they say about god they're they're giving an expression to god that's not even worthy of any action he's ever committed they said god says adam adam where i vow and then they say we heard your voice and we were afraid well let me ask you something did his voice change his voice didn't change what changed their position in christ holy so their position in christ hallelujah changed the outlook on the mercy and grace of god that he had given them and a lot of times the life you live is what makes you afraid of approaching god [Applause] if you're not careful the devil keep you off into that holy because you got fear and that's a tool that satan lou uses from day one of the book of genesis he let fear come on the people and fear was the very thing that kept him separated from god's presence but it wasn't god it was them even though they messed up god would remain faithful hallelujah and he always kept coming even think about a church they could be an adulterer they eve committed adultery they took us a forbidden act and god and his faithfulness still came down and called their name how many of us we were in bars drinking and smoking and some of us cussing and lying and cheating and stealing and in that condition god still called our name isn't he faithful god doesn't let the conditions of your life stop that seed from coming to life and i'll be the first one to say if god saved me he can save anybody hallelujah i had my first experience with god like i was just saying when i had cancer you know i was 15 years old so you can't tell me as a teenager god ain't dealing with you it's whether you want to surrender or not hallelujah and let me say this parents don't be like job the reason why job went through he went through hallelujah went through what he went through is because he had fear in his life look he was offering a sacrifice every day why because he was afraid you said brothers what are you talking about listen through the interpretation of that scripture through a vindicated prophet he said the very thing job feared came upon him and you notice what job offered that sacrifice he said pre-adventure one of my children may sin in a heart prevention one of my children may speak against you lord i'm gonna keep this token of the blood here so the very thing that was motivating him was fear oh my what if he was just stood back and trust the lord and say lord whatever your will is whatever your will is let it be we don't pray we don't pray like that because we don't want the struggle because you know some of us we gonna fight and fight and kick and scream but y'all know the holy spirit is like a bounty hunter you ever seen them all cowboy pictures hey i know somebody about to cut me off why you keep talking about tv and television cause you got one but you you know in those old pictures the sheriff or the bounty hunter he would have a picture of that person and he wasn't going to get that person without a reward being offered first so what he'd have the picture he'd find the person and say look i'm so-and-so i'm a bounty hunter i come to get you and look this is what you we know what you did now there's two things you can do there's two things gonna happen here you can come quietly just let me cuff you up and we go back together or i can pistol whip you tie you up and drag you behind this horse but either way you coming now some of us came quietly but some of us some of us had to be beaten whip tied up i believe duct tape was invented for some of us dragged but then you got back to the place where you could be held accountable think about the church all god is trying to do is get us to a place where we can be held accountable and once you're held accountable hallelujah there's two things that becomes a weapon in your hand that'll give you power unlimited power hollywood y'all listen to me good there's two things that you possess we possess as people that can give us unlimited power and status with god the prophet of god said let me let me finish reading holly hallelujah listen let me finish reading this quote and i'll get back to it he says uh god reveals himself the way he wants to to the people he wants to it's his sovereign will he hardens who he hardens and justifies who he justifies it lays in god's hands not in my hands on your hands it lays in god's hands to what he will do the bible said do you realize that honey now listen this is this is i believe you guys got this this is a life story amen 51 he says now there's a perfect will and a permissive will and i feel that if god here on the platform can show me things that has been and in the rooms and so forth he's able to tell me just where he wants me and what he wants me to do but if i feel as long as i've got it all hooked up you ever felt like that he said as long as i feel like i've got it all hooked up i feel like then he won't pull his hand on it he won't put his hand on it as long as i'm doing it now i'm finna give you a weapon pay attention holly i'm i'm gonna give you something today that's greater than an atomic bomb i'm gonna give you something that's faster than a uzi hallelujah he says and that's the way it is he's saying that's the way it is anything as long as you're going to do it if someone talks about you and they talk they they talk back about them you talk back about them god can't fight your battle you're fighting it yourself see just let loose and let him do it what does that mean if you let loose and let him do it what are we doing trusting in the lord he said and just hit him a weapon and just commit it to him some of y'all ain't catch that weapon that's a weapon anybody can hold that's right a five-year-old in here can operate in that weapon a teenager in here can operate in that weapon uh a mourning parent can operate in that weapon he says don't fight it yourself just commit it to god what does he mean how do you commit it you pray about it and say god i gave it to you in the same illustration in a different message he said what does a a farmer do he plants the seed and then he just waits he knows what he's planted and then he just waits hallelujah if he goes back and dig it up it'll never grow what is he doing when he digs it up he's putting his hands on it commit it and leave it alone just understand hallelujah and know what you planted and in your spiritual vision there is something you ought to be looking for once you committed to god are you with me church i know this message is kind of personal this morning but that's the way it has to be hallelujah christmas is over with we're no longer under the mistletoe it's back to real life again no more jingle bells hallelujah says committed to him the greatest weapon that i know of of a christian today is a communal god when you can when you can do nothing about it just commit it to him and god will take care of it and in another message i ain't got time to read it he said the greatest weapon is a communal and a confession and a confession i'll say it again as a confession young people you want to know how to overcome that thing that's bothering you confess it to god say lord this thing is out of control in my life i need your help amen because god can't touch it until you tell him you don't want it no more you know the prophet god said god is not a brute he's not going to force you to do anything he wants you to have enough confidence in him to hallelujah give him that pornography hallelujah he wants you to have enough trust in him to give him that anxiety i feel a spirit of fear why are you afraid did you know the devil is telling you say it's just your nerves he's a liar god came to give us peace hallelujah you can't sleep at night we're going to rebuke that demon today satan is a light that's your bed that's your house you got a right to have whatever you need six seven eight hours of sleep without a nightmare oh yeah i told you you pull i'll preach you quit i'll stop you resist i'll turn into a hell a communal and a confession listen church don't get nervous i'm about to close listen as we look at the scripture and the reason why i read first kings elijah was sort of like on the run and god told him go by this way and i got a raven there uh can i remember did he even tell him he was a raven he said go that way and i'll sustain me now he had just finished a alpha act of the supernatural amen he said it ain't gonna rain till i call for it and rosie spoke that a spirit of fear came on oh my god now let me ask you a question was he not a prophet after that he was still a prophet now what i'm saying to you you may have used god man's use you supernaturally and things have happened but now you're in a shaky area that doesn't mean you're not a child of god holy you could be in a stinky situation that doesn't mean hallelujah that your status has changed in the kingdom of heaven oh yeah even though he's just saying ain't gonna rain to i call for it jezebel said i'm gonna kill you he's like we're running from his life and just shut up the heavens that fear is something else boy hallelujah look church let me go back a little bit dude we're dealing with this fear a little bit i don't know why we keep going there but god trying to break the spirit of fear in here this morning church look at it job hallelujah the thief that came upon him through the interpretation of the of the prophet of god he said it was what he feared but let's look at how god looked at him when satan came and he said uh uh uh he's walking to a fro and the lord says satan what are you doing here he said i'm just i'm just walking around trying to test somebody i'm walking around here trying to mess up somebody moment but god had everybody protected whoa think about it church satan is walking around your family but he can't do nothing but what god allows and you're going through something god has allowed it what does that mean he's in control hallelujah because satan can't put his hand on it unless god allows it so if god allows it there is a purpose hallelujah church and now job the devil comes he says hey he says he said have you considered my servant have you considered my servant job satan says of course i have i want him bad because he looks like he's happy serving you family in order everything good finance is just like a blessed you know what i i've been i've been trying to get to him and he says but you protecting him you got a hedge around him i can't get to him yeah i know tony with me tony i feel like damn damn hallelujah think about that church holy if it's any area in your life that's messed up right now god gave permission that's if you're a child of god now because i don't i don't when i tell my testimony i don't go back and say the devil gave me cancer if i do that i i'm confessing that he had control over my life hallelujah no god is in control we trusted in the law but let's look at it everybody all right i know some of y'all watching time and if you one of them people got on a digital watch and you got it set to a certain time i'm gonna tell you right now when it stop beeping i ain't gonna hear it so let your alarm go off hallelujah i just do that as a kid in church i get tired of the preachers like man this man gonna preach all day all night man let me set this thing at one o'clock right when one o'clock coming all of a sudden i want to give god some praise can't remember one time the preacher ever heard my alarm never why because he was in a different atmosphere amen the people of god when we come to church we're looking for the lord and where is he he's high and lifted up that's where we belong church hallelujah but look church amen everybody all right getting a little bit more of your own boy praise god but listen church for those of you who don't know me i'm family this ain't no special service we act like this all the time but yeah every time we get together it's like this hallelujah i ain't just a crazy one all of us crazy because it's your pool that's making me act like this hallelujah y'all think i'm doing this by myself no it's all you crazy people with me hallelujah some of you want to jump up and say hey man brother jax but you got fear in your life you'll be like oh my god i shouted this morning did you see me i shouted trust me if you

change again hallelujah we'll be in the presence of newness and freshness forever [Applause] i ain't gonna wait till that happen i'm gonna smile my way into that [Music] hallelujah church we got something to be grateful for hallelujah god has given us a new year hallelujah we've overcome uh uh uh covet 19 hallelujah we've overcome covert 19 and a half let me hear this real quick dodgers are so confused i heard on the news i said the barbershop the other day i heard the doctors come on and say that the amara kron or whatever now they give you the transformer names moroccan optimus prime the morocco whatever you call it it has reached its peak we don't think it can infect anybody else these people are comical but sickness has been around here since eve stepped behind stepped from behind the word has mankind continued to live and we will continue to live but what we have to realize is there is an agenda with us there's an agenda you have to make sure you keep your eyes on the word holy prophecy and dual prophecy has been fulfilled amen hallelujah you know what the prophet talked about hallelujah a woman a man running the world and so forth she having a purple dress he said it could be the catholic church or it could be a natural woman hallelujah well let me tell you something both of those have happened [Applause] has let me see past tense has happened holy the catholic church is running the world julia and kamala harris hollywood when joe biden got sick they turned the world into her hands and whatever she said had to happen hooray it has happened prophecy has been fulfilled make sure you're trusting in the word that's what i'm trying to tell my family loved ones church members we don't have a lot of time to go where we gonna go out of this people thought michael jackson was crazy when he went across went across the sea and they just filmed them wearing a mask now all of us walking around with masks and times have changed so much to what wasn't normal is normal now three years ago brother i couldn't walk in the bank with a hoodie and a mask on [Laughter] y'all laughing but that real talk as soon as i walk in there's a black man in here with a hoodie and a mask we don't know what he's thinking now they don't know what i'm thinking and they let me come in with a mask and a hoodie and they give me money [Applause] y'all see how crazy our world has gotten if you get caught up in the fear of all this stuff you realize you'll lose the simplicity of the word coming to pass hallelujah church it's like it's it's it's it's like what the prophet of god said when it came down to job and he said that the very thing job feared came upon him but that's what job feared but look at how god thought about job hallelujah god told satan have you considered my servant job there's nothing like him in all the earth god didn't see fear that was job making all that stuff up god saw a man that could overcome the battle hallelujah and that's what he sees at us amen he lets us go through things because he know we can overcome the battle you can overcome that sickness hallelujah you can overcome that financial battle you can overcome that trial in your body you can overcome it amen you can overcome that pain of your past you can overcome it you can overcome that hurt that you've gone you can overcome it oh my i got to quit because i feel like preaching hallelujah oh my but remember in the old church look elijah he one minute he's closing up the heavens there's no rain next minute he's running for his life god said go over here and i'ma i'mma sustain you he goes over there god sends a raven hallelujah ain't even a bird that has any kind of spiritual type god you something raggedy huh oh my god use something that'll never have any spiritual application of good in the kingdom to sustain his prophet oh my god can do what he want to do because remember hallelujah i believe it was a raven and it was a dove hallelujah on the ark amen hallelujah the raven went out and went wow and the dove came back why because the dove was a clean bird it was a type of spiritual things now god is going to use hallelujah this black dark raven hallelujah to help out a spiritual thing that's what he may do hallelujah he'll let the dark areas of your life and times of your life to become a spiritual thing in this dark time of elijah's life where he's feared everything god use the raven not a dove he can do what he want to do but then god says go over here and i'm gonna sustain you but then the brook dries up all this stuff happens now god told him said go down this way i got a woman she gonna help you out y'all know i'm paraphrasing but look when he gets there the woman ain't got enough but just for herself so what does elijah do he has to trust in what god said because he go by his natural eyes she only got enough for what two cakes one for her one for her son and she told him that he like hey give me something to eat she said all i got is enough for me and my son we're gonna eat it we're gonna die now if if he was in a carnal rim he'll be like but lord you told me to come here you told me you was gonna sustain me we're not dealing with what we can see in the natural realm we're dealing with the promises of god if god said it he can fulfill it if god told you to wait on him you wait on him if god told you to commit it to his hands and he'll take care of it commit it and don't look back hallelujah church you're talking about trusting in the lord i remember my younger days as a christian hallelujah things are just tight things are still tight financially i'm talking about and you know bruh man i can remember where i was working and i couldn't pay my car insurance i was paying my mortgage out paying everything else but that car insurance was so that was that was a battle i was like man lord i just need this i need that you know what god told me don't you miss paying your tithes i'm telling god i'm in need he telling me don't you miss paying your time so i say okay lord i don't pay my tithes forget about the insurance this month so now i got to commit that to god and trust in the lord so i committed it to the lord and now the devil's like look at you demi you can't even go to church you ain't got no insurance you know what i told the devil i'll say what having insurance got to do with me going to church i ain't advising nobody to do this you got to be god doing something in your life now it was a dark moment seemed like but god was encouraging me he said go on to church i got you so we jumped in the car and we rolled out i drove to church like i was in that maserati not one day one month then after that the taxes came up so you got to pay your taxes i can't pay the insurance i'm gonna pay my taxes that voice come back and say don't you stop paying your tires i pay my tires forget about the taxes now the sticker expired everybody else stick a green mine blue they know i'm

tags we got some police officers i didn't roll with tony [Music] and some of you didn't roll with kevin you know what they do hallelujah this man was on my bumper so hard i almost said you button your seatbelt that's how close he was church but trusting in the lord he was behind me hallelujah we're going up a hill he got from behind me and put the lights on the person beside me and i went on the church praise god hallelujah he is a protector we have to trust in him and one morning i was out delivering newspapers hallelujah it's like four in the morning man and they put this trickery sign up where you can't make a left turn i've always made left turns right here and all of a sudden i can't make a left turn that's just like satan you're used to doing something and then he put a little twist in it that'll make you guilty hallelujah that's for the young people you used to doing something but then satan to put a little twist in it that's what makes it wrong that little twist make it wrong stop it church i make a left turn the police officer pulls me over pulled me over got the lights on me i don't have no insurance my tags are expired i don't have a registration he comes up to the car he says license and registration [Laughter] i had no registration but i had a license and i'm shaking like all shakeout and before he could take it something came over him and he looks in the car he sees the newspapers in the back he said man you know what i'm sorry he started apologizing for stopping me he said i'm sorry i ain't man you out here working trying to make an honest living and i'm sorry for even stopping you man you have a good day didn't write a warning didn't write a td right nothing holly what was happening god was showing me hallelujah in the darkest moments he's there

brand new tags and gave me a receipt and i didn't give her no money church i grab that stuff so fast and walk up out of there welcome i ain't wait till i got down the street i put that thing over right there just in case they tried to take it i put it on right there church i got him i caught you tomorrow i gave god some praise when you can't do it if you trust in the lord god will take care of it hallelujah and by god's grace when you overcome in the realms of faith you don't have to go through that battle again hallelujah because he's a protector amen real quick before i close what time it is oh jesus jesus listen trust trust comes in two formats in the format of a verb and in the format as a noun let's look at trusting god in the format of a noun we know that now there's a person place a thing amen but we're trusting what a person we're not trusting i think we're trusting a person what are we trusting hallelujah trust means as a now assured reliance on the character hallelujah we're trusting the character of god hallelujah god can never be defeated he can never come up short hallelujah if you need joy he gives you joy if you need peace he gives you peace that's just who his character is that's what we're trusting hallelujah he says trust amen reliance on the character ability strength hallelujah god's ability with god all things are possible look at your situation right now why are you trusting him because all things are possible amen what are we trusting in his strength amen god can never be defeated holy hezekiah trusted in the lord he took the letter and spread it out before the lord amen and say god the king of syria is saying don't trust in you and the lord said he will not come into the kingdom he said one angel and the angel destroyed the whole syrian army why because that's his strength that's what we're trusting in hallelujah it says or as a noun now or truth of someone or something do we have truth [Music] so when you apply the word to your situation you're trusting in the truth of god's word he says by stripes you're healed that's truth if he says you're the head and not to tell that's truth if he says bring to my storehouse first and see if i won't open the windows he says prove me and then the verse of that he says i see if i won't rebuke the devour i'll take care of that very thing that's hindering your finances [Music] see this is reality to me amen because i fight so hard just to stay afloat at at the camp meeting the youth meet y'all had at the end of it brother donny was picking up his granddaughter and we was walking past each other like hey bro how you doing i'm doing all right i said how you doing he said man i'm just trying to stay above water i said you i say i'm spitting it back out but i'm still swimming hallelujah hallelujah don't you feel like that sometimes you feel like the enemy is trying to take you down and you got a little water in your mouth spit it out and keep on choking hallelujah don't quit don't stop don't give up holy look for that second wind we're we're trusting in the ability and strength of god we're trusting in the character of god what is this trust this trust is in the great one himself oh man i'm about to close don't get nervous oh my that was as a nerve that was as a noun as a verb a verb is something that's put into action come on oh my if you trust in god you got to put in action that's why we talk about a communal that's why we talk about a confession hallelujah put it into action confess that thing to god say lord i'ma just trust in you you ever been there where no matter what you were thinking you couldn't change it all you could do was say lord this is for you hallelujah oh my church i've been there hallelujah i've been there and still there trusting in the lord oh my it seems like you get a credit card paid off getting mobiles coming you got to use the credit card all over again trust in the lord oh my oh i guess i'm the only one that happened to you go ahead pal says a verb it means listen to this as a verb trusting in god it says to rely on the faithfulness the truthfulness hallelujah this is the one i like it says all the accuracy wow hallelujah if something is in action if it's in action it has to be accurate hallelujah roy if we're trusting in god that means he's accurate he's not going to hit and miss it's going to be exactly what you need hallelujah what god will do will be exactly what you need oh my oh you got up there praise god it says accuracy of to believe oh we believe in church we sing the song all the time holy believe the only way you can believe is if you put your trust in him hallelujah it says to commit a man from this day forward whatever's going on in your life whatever adversity you trust in god how by committing it to him commit or place in one's care wow i put my family in your care i put my job in your care i put my health in your care i put my truck in your car my car in your care my house and your care my job everything yo i put my hair in your can come i don't know on y'all but i feel like dancing i know some of these young people want to help me out today hallelujah oh my church church there's an old quartet song we sing but we don't sing it as much but there's a whole quarter song it says talks about worship service and it says this is just a rehearsal when we get to heaven we're going to really sing this is just a rehearsal when we get to heaven we're gonna really sing hallelujah when we get to heaven we're gonna really see hallelujah when we get to heaven let me let me i'm feeling in church holly i'm feeling the grace of god hallelujah i feel that if i walk out of here trusting in him everything is going to be all right everything is going to be all right can we give god a wave offering that everything is going to be all right hallelujah you say we broke things i ain't got it don't worry about it god got it amen he says a place in one's care to place confidence whoa that's where i'm closing church davis trust was an action confidence what did david do harley all of his wives were gone children were gone but he had trust in god to place confidence that everything was all right how did he why was he confident the bible says that david encouraged himself that's when you got confidence in god you fall back on what he's done hallelujah you fall back and you say lord i remember when hallelujah church when things get tight hallelujah i fall back and i say lord i remember when the police stopped me i remember when when the clerk gave me something free i remember and you let those testimonies encourage you to keep trusting in the lord david encouraged himself and he waited for the lord to tell him to go did he go and get everything that belonged to him amen that was just a mere test and there's some things we're going through that's just a mere test some tests are longer than others and what i'm finding out sometimes the length of the test determines your attitude [Music] he know you ain't there yet so he let that thing linger and linger and linger especially with dealing with people the ultimate test when you're dealing with people is for you to come out of that test with perfect love especially in your church especially in your family when you can love someone unconditional no matter what they didn't did for you one time my pastor dropped the bomb on the church he says hey we all say we forgive somebody and then you say well i forgive i forgot i won't forget but then you come and you become a christian and you say well i i got to forgive because god wants us to love everybody he says whenever you see that person and whatever they did to you comes back to your memory you ain't forgave them oh oh look like we didn't hit a little spot there no no i didn't forgave them i just don't deal with them you don't deal with them because every time you think about it you think about what they did to you you got to conquer that thing you got to give that to god and say lord take this out of my heart that when i see them i can just appreciate them as a brother or sister no matter what they did prime example jesus christ saying father forgive them for what they did and then turn right back around and place them back in the covenant that's what you call some forgiveness oh my let the same people you love crucify you kill you amen then turn back around and say i'ma give them another day of grace anybody trusting in the lord church it ain't gonna get no better down here as far as living in this world it ain't gonna get no better things are gonna get tougher we got to trust in the lord let's not try to reason ourselves around the scripture no let's meet it head on and if there's something you don't understand don't try to reason away just put it in god's hands and wait on the lord don't discount it ah that just came from brother matt you know brother matt i always hit those kind of issues god use them that way because he wants to deal personally with you because he knows you can't stand to hear brother matt talking about that issue so god gonna anoint brother matt to talk about that issue every time you come to church because he's trying to get you to conquer something hallelujah anybody growing in christ trust me hallelujah i ain't got it all made up hallelujah i ain't got it all put in every position but i'm crying out lord help me come on musicians come on i'm sorry for going so long hallelujah but it's a new year we got 11 more months hallelujah god has been good to us church let's not slow up let's keep pressing let's keep pushing hey man y'all know god is doing something special in this church hallelujah put your shoulder to the plow if you can't be a part of it pray for it hallelujah pray for the ministry pray for the young people pray for the parents because one thing about satan whatever avenue he can attack he's going to ask god for permission hallelujah but one thing about god god is so confident in his in his children and in what he's placed in us he'll let the devil have it he'll say go ahead i ain't worried hallelujah i don't know if y'all know this psalm but let's get into it a little bit my hallelujah belongs to you [Music] my hallelujah belongs to you my hallelujah belongs to you one more time my hallelujah belongs to you everybody say you deserve

sunshine i believe the rays started shining down in this building before those rays came out amen brother diggs the word came amen and healed the people amen praise the lord it's so incredible brother diggs what you were speaking on um just in devotions yesterday uh me and rachel was just driving to charleston going to get some church supplies and and rachel was just sharing me with me a january 13th little book that she has streams in the desert that she uh she reads from and it's just so incredible what was spoken today because brother diggs was talking about how that your trials and the tests that god put you through that it was cancer even brother dick said i don't say that was the devil who gave that to me but god his mom wanted him to go to his church so god put cancer in his life and god what god did was god took what the devil just as joseph said what you meant for evil god is used for good yeah and so what god can do is he can take the satan doesn't realize it that the very attacks that he launches on god's family is the tool that god uses to bring strength to your life i mean it's so powerful just felt i wanted to read this this was so good it quotes romans 8 you can display it on the screen romans 8 37 and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us says this is more you can you can make that full screen and then command plus so zoom it in make it full screen first though before you do that i want everybody to be able to read that listen what he says he says this is more more than victory this is a triumph so complete that we have not only escaped defeat and destruction but we have destroyed our enemies and won a spoil so rich and valuable that we can thank god that the battle ever came how can we be more than conquerors you ever thought about that you're more than conquerors how can you be more than a conqueror we can get out of the conflict a spiritual discipline that will greatly strengthen our faith and establish our spiritual character temptation is necessary to settle and confirm us in the spiritual life it is like the fire which burns in the colors of mineral painting or like winds that cause the mighty cedars of the mountain to strike more deeply into the soil our spiritual conflicts are among our choicest blessings and our great adversary is used think about this to train us for his ultimate defeat what is god going to use us to train us to defeat the devil the attacks the devil launches in our life he says the ancient figurines had a legend that every time they conquered an enemy the victor absorbed the physical strength of his victim and added so much to his own strength and valor so temptation victoriously met doubles our spiritual strength and equipment it is possible thus not only to defeat our enemy but to capture him and make him fight in our ranks listen to this the prophet isaiah speaks of flying on the shoulders of the philistines these philistines were their deadly foes but the figure suggested that they would be enabled not only to conquer the philistines but to use them to carry the victors on their shoulders for further triumphs just as the wise sailor can use a headwind to carry him forward by tacking and taking advantage of its impelling force so it is possible for us in our spiritual life through the victorious grace of god to turn to account the things that seem most unfriendly and una unfavorable and to be able to say continually the things that were against me have happened to the furtherance of the gospel listen it goes just a little bit further it says a noted scientist observing that early voyagers fancied that the coral building animals instinctively build up the great circles of the atal islands to afford themselves protection in the inner parts has disproved this fancy by showing that the insect builders can only live and thrive fronting the open ocean and the highly aerated foam of its resistance resistive billows so it has been commonly thought that protected ease is the most favorable condition of life whereas all the noblest and strongest lives prove on the contrary that the endurance of hardship is the making of the men and the factor that distinguishes between existence and vigorous vitality in other words the difference between just existing and thriving and i believe god wants us to thrive he says hardship makes character second corinthians 2 14 now thanks be unto god who always leads us forth the triumph with the anointed one it's so amazing is what i just the lord i heard brother diggs begin to speak and he got this david at ziklag and david goes and it's incredible because if you read that entire story he loses everything god says go and you'll recover all david pursues and he goes and recovers all whips the philistines they get all their wives all their children and they get everything back they that the devil had taken from them but they're not just gonna get what the devil took but the bible says david also took all their treasure all their money all their goods and what were they they were spoils of war so when the bible says you're more than a conqueror because god will send you through difficulty and when you come out of that difficulty you won't just have what you lost through the trial but you'll have more than you started with oh you ought to give god a praise offering this morning say lord hallelujah [Music] i'm gonna trust you how many can say lord i'm gonna trust you you know what you're doing you were god for a long time long before i came on this earth and you know what you're doing you believe that the lord knows what he's doing in your life amen we're gonna take uh just sing the song here before we're dismissed go in the fear of god amen enjoy that sunshine and we'll see you
