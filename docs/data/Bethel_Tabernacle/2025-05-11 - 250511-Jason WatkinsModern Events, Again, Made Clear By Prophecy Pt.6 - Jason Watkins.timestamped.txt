[3:26] 40some years ago, he came into my life
[3:28] and changed it and I was born again. Of
[3:33] course, that's when the battle started.
[3:36] The devil said, "Oh yeah." The Lord
[3:38] said, "Yeah, he's mine." Let's pray.
[3:42] Father, we thank you,
[3:44] Lord, for your goodness and mercy this
[3:46] morning.
[3:48] Father, we do thank you for godly
[3:49] mothers.
[3:51] And Lord, as we set aside today as
[3:54] Mother's Day, may we honor them every
[3:56] day of our life, Father.
[3:58] And father, as we gather together in
[4:00] your name this morning,
[4:03] pray that you'd overlook our faults
[4:06] and see our needs today. Pray that you'd
[4:09] bless each and everyone in attendance,
[4:11] those that would hear over the stream.
[4:14] Father, we just want to draw closer to
[4:16] you. We love to see prophecy fulfilled,
[4:19] Father. And as your word says, you just
[4:22] bring it to pass regardless of what we
[4:24] think about it. I'm so thankful for
[4:27] that.
[4:28] As we gather the tithes and offerings, I
[4:30] pray that you bless the cheerful giver.
[4:33] Lord, all that are in attendance, I pray
[4:35] that you would look upon the hearts.
[4:38] Lord, you see the need there. The most
[4:41] important need is more of you, Father.
[4:44] Bless your people this morning. We pray
[4:46] in Jesus' name. Amen.
[4:52] Amen. Won't you turn to your neighbor
[4:55] this morning and just say, "God bless

[30:51] Sister Jean for a mother, you get a
[30:52] little mini sermon every time you call
[30:54] her.
[30:55] And so she don't take much like a little
[30:59] like a little Energizer Bunny. Just give
[31:01] her a little whine and and she'll take
[31:02] right off. And we got to talking about
[31:04] the the end times and the day the hour
[31:06] that we live in. And my I had to alter
[31:09] some of my preaching notes. Amen. Praise
[31:12] the Lord. Well, today is an amazing day,
[31:16] not only for the occasion of Mother's
[31:19] Day, but uh some amazing things have
[31:21] happened since the last time I stood in
[31:23] this pull pit.
[31:24] Wow. So, we're going to be talking about
[31:26] that a little bit um as we go along
[31:29] today. And I I just wanted to wish all
[31:31] of our mothers a wonderful, wonderful
[31:34] Mother's Day. I told her, I said, "You
[31:35] know, Sister Mom, it's um it seems right
[31:39] and wrong to to call you today and say
[31:42] happy Mother's Day because every day is
[31:43] Mother's Day."
[31:45] And she said, "That's right." She said,
[31:46] "That's what brother Brandham said.
[31:47] Every day was Mother's Day." I said,
[31:48] "Well, if it wasn't for Mother's Day,
[31:51] there wouldn't be anything. Would be no
[31:52] people. Wouldn't be nothing." So, thank
[31:55] goodness for mothers. Amen. Praise the
[31:58] Lord. Um, also just a quick reminder,
[32:02] um, while I have your attention about
[32:04] our weekend coming up
[32:06] next weekend, our special weekend there,
[32:09] we're going to have a kind of a a
[32:11] wonderful evening of singing and
[32:13] fellowship u both in here and then a
[32:16] little bit of uh refreshments in the
[32:18] fellowship hall. and uh the brothers um
[32:21] and the sisters will have been working
[32:23] very hard to put all that together. We
[32:26] we we we have to have it closed down
[32:28] today. We're sorry about that. We're
[32:30] just not ready. It's getting some
[32:32] renovations. And I just want to say that
[32:34] some of the renovations are actually our
[32:37] long-term permanent renovations. So,
[32:39] we're definitely underway. It's not all
[32:41] just temporary. There's a number of
[32:43] things in there that are temporary. Um,
[32:45] but we actually went ahead and put the
[32:47] permanent roof on it. And, uh, we're
[32:50] getting some long-term permanent
[32:52] furniture for it. Don't know if it'll be
[32:53] here. Um, there's a little bit of a
[32:55] shipping delay, so we may not have that.
[32:58] But, Amen. We'll have plenty of tables
[33:00] and chairs for everybody to sit. And we
[33:02] don't know how much company's going to
[33:03] come. We haven't really announced it
[33:05] out, but some people have heard and
[33:07] about it. I guess we talk about it here
[33:09] in the pull pit. So, it kind of uh, goes
[33:11] out that way. And then some of you
[33:13] others have invited friends and family.
[33:16] Amen. I want to um give a greetings this
[33:18] morning to Pastor Ibuka there um in uh
[33:22] in Nigeria and uh I think this this is
[33:25] their evening service and he told me
[33:27] they had plans to stream this service if
[33:30] the connection for them is good. It can
[33:33] be a little dicey there. So, amen.
[33:36] Praise the Lord. Pastor, if you're on,
[33:37] we greet you in the name of the Lord. If
[33:39] you can't make the live, Amen. then you
[33:42] perhaps you'll catch the archive. And so
[33:44] he wanted to have some thoughts for me
[33:47] on some of the events that have happened
[33:49] and transpired. I said, well, I'm going
[33:51] to be saying some about that in the
[33:53] service on Sunday, which is today. So, I
[33:57] want your undivided attention. We're
[34:00] going to go into some areas today and
[34:02] we're going to continue in our series.
[34:04] How about that? I mean, right in the
[34:06] middle of a series, uh, where event, you
[34:09] know, historical events are being made
[34:12] clear. And it's interesting. I was
[34:15] telling Chris, we were on our walk
[34:17] yesterday and and I said, you know, it's
[34:20] amazing to me that I I had been talking
[34:24] to the Lord because to cover, you know,
[34:27] the past events like we did uh last time
[34:30] where we actually went back into the
[34:31] ancient world, you remember that? And we
[34:33] brought you up through through that that
[34:36] great chapter there in the Old Testament
[34:37] and showed how that that what we see in
[34:41] history is determinate. It's
[34:43] determinate. It's not just u random.
[34:46] There's no accidents. There's only Gods.
[34:49] And so we realize that everything is
[34:51] running according to the plan that God
[34:53] had long before the foundation of the
[34:55] world. And so, you know, we're we're
[34:58] going to kind of pick up there a little
[35:00] bit today and bring it quickly more into
[35:02] the New Testament era. There's no need
[35:05] to just linger back there. I only did
[35:06] that so you could get the point. So, you
[35:08] could see that history and prophecy uh
[35:12] overlay. And uh the history is because
[35:14] of the prophecy, not the other way
[35:17] around. And so uh and we prove that
[35:20] because the prophet prophesied about six
[35:23] different nations and a couple of the
[35:25] events were in the past. Some of them
[35:27] were happening right then and some of
[35:29] them were in the future and they hit
[35:30] right on the head exactly like the
[35:32] prophecy said they would. So we're, you
[35:35] know, we're going to come and look at
[35:36] the New Testament era. And again, we're
[35:39] not uh this is not a a study on the book
[35:42] of Revelation per se. We're re we're
[35:45] referencing Daniel and and Ezekiel and
[35:47] Revelation and the Gospels and different
[35:50] places, but it's not an intensive verse
[35:53] by verse breakdown. Uh we're just
[35:55] looking I'm just trying to establish the
[35:58] principle which brings us to the modern
[36:00] day. So said all that to say this. So I
[36:03] was talking to the Lord. I said, "Lord,
[36:05] you know, that's not hard to do for me.
[36:08] Um, I've studied it my whole life. And,
[36:10] uh, I teach on it online, uh, for the
[36:13] last several years. And so to to to pick
[36:16] out all of these things that have
[36:17] happened in the Old Testament, that
[36:19] happened in the New Testament era, uh,
[36:21] you know, I can I can do that off the
[36:22] top of my head without even needing
[36:24] notes. I've done it so much. And so I
[36:27] said, "But Lord, what about, you know,
[36:29] we're we're trying to say, but what
[36:31] about modern events?" And I said, you
[36:34] know, we we had the opening of the seven
[36:36] seals. I can point back to that. We, you
[36:39] know, we we know that this is a time or
[36:41] an age or a a season of the bride's
[36:44] ministry. It's the ministry of the son
[36:46] of man. The word is made flesh. Again,
[36:48] we've reiterated that, reiterated that.
[36:51] We we've talked about that. You know,
[36:52] we've taught on the on the on the
[36:55] trumpets and the vials and different
[36:56] things like that. And I always enjoy
[36:58] that. And you know, I remember some of
[37:01] the points that I was making when we did
[37:03] a series on the vials cuz the the the
[37:06] vials are an escalation of the trumpets.
[37:08] The trumpets and the vials go hand in
[37:10] hand. They correlate. And the trumpets
[37:13] is God's dealing with Israel in world
[37:16] events, which which connects two world
[37:18] events. It's not u the seven trumpets is
[37:21] not a lesson on world events. It's a
[37:24] lesson on God preserving and restoring
[37:27] Israel during world events.
[37:30] And world events are happening because
[37:32] of he's working to restore his people
[37:35] in the in the interim. He's, you know,
[37:38] and while that's going on simultaneously
[37:40] under the seals, he's bringing a bride
[37:42] through seven church ages. And and you
[37:45] know, we've talked about that before and
[37:46] Brother Brandham said they all happen
[37:48] right in the end at a in a cluster. And
[37:50] uh and so we've been looking at that
[37:52] very carefully. And a lot of times
[37:55] people read the uh the the the vials and
[37:57] they say, "My goodness, what a what
[37:59] terrible things." But understand that
[38:03] that the vials, and I thought this was
[38:05] an important point I wanted to make this
[38:07] morning, that the vials are poured out
[38:10] in the tribulation period
[38:13] in their fullness.
[38:15] But bear in mind, they're also poured
[38:17] out in the earth partially. Right.
[38:19] Every time a a church age messenger
[38:22] speaks to the gentile church and they
[38:25] reject it, a temporary judgment falls.
[38:28] So that vial partly cracks open. See?
[38:32] And so so so this is why brother
[38:34] Brandham would would say, you know,
[38:36] these things can happen between the
[38:37] sixth and seventh church uh sixth and
[38:39] seventh seal, sixth and seventh trumpet.
[38:42] And you wonder, well, how's that? I
[38:43] thought that the sixth uh seal was the
[38:46] tribulation. Well, it is. But you have
[38:48] to understand that the that the the that
[38:51] the punishment that the judgment of that
[38:53] that that vial and that trumpet
[38:56] partially opened up before uh even the
[39:00] prophet came on the scene.
[39:02] See so so you realize that before even
[39:05] the ministry of Elijah which comes down
[39:07] in a little interval of time uh to catch
[39:10] to perfect a last day brideg. So, you
[39:14] know, the thing to remember is that when
[39:17] you see that partial judgment happening,
[39:20] whether it's in the New Testament
[39:21] Gentiles or among the the New Testament
[39:25] era of the Jews who are blinded,
[39:28] or whether it's to the world, to the
[39:29] foolish virgin, to the remnant,
[39:32] that it that it comes to cause
[39:34] repentance.
[39:36] And that's big. It doesn't come to
[39:39] punish. It comes to cause repentance.
[39:42] Amen.
[39:43] And the the amazing thing is is that
[39:46] when God is pouring it out in the
[39:48] tribulation period, not just in the
[39:50] tribulation period, but even under its
[39:52] partial fulfillment, instead of
[39:54] repenting, people curse God.
[39:56] Yeah. Amen.
[39:57] And they miss the whole purpose of it.
[39:59] It's actually God rich in mercy trying
[40:02] to partially warn the people before it
[40:04] comes in the tribulation.
[40:07] And that's what preaching does. That's
[40:08] what the preaching of the gospel does.
[40:10] It's not because preachers have it in
[40:12] for you and we like preaching hard
[40:14] things. We don't. Those things up tear
[40:16] our insides up. Uh but it's because that
[40:19] the Holy Spirit is trying to get uh
[40:22] repentance and he's trying to bring us
[40:24] back to our senses. That's what the
[40:26] gospel is for.
[40:27] Amen.
[40:28] So in these ways, we we appreciate what
[40:31] God has done in our day. And and so I
[40:35] you know I
[40:38] today I I want to look at some of these
[40:41] things and take you through quickly New
[40:44] Testament times and we're going to hit
[40:46] some things that we're are familiar to
[40:48] us and I want to make some points a
[40:50] little bit what I'm making now. I'm
[40:51] almost getting ahead of myself. I'm
[40:52] trying to hit the brakes because I
[40:54] haven't even read my text. But you're
[40:57] going to see my my my fox's tail is on
[41:00] fire this morning. So, we're we're
[41:02] trying to uh run through the Philistine
[41:04] fields and burn them down. Amen. Praise
[41:06] the Lord. And if you got any Philistine
[41:08] fields, I want to set them on fire.
[41:09] Praise the Lord.
[41:11] Amen. And burn them out of your life
[41:12] completely. That's what the gospel comes
[41:14] for. But uh you know, it it is a it is a
[41:18] beautiful thing what what God is doing
[41:20] and I look forward uh to what we have
[41:23] today and what's coming in other in
[41:25] other sermons. This will not complete
[41:27] the series today by any means, but I
[41:29] want to catch this epic moment because
[41:32] you know that was that was so ironic to
[41:34] me that I was saying, Lord, but what
[41:37] what epic event. I can go back and look
[41:40] under under the trumpets and vials and I
[41:42] can see four 200 million demon chargers
[41:47] released at Euphrates to drive the Jews
[41:49] back to the homeland. I can get that. I
[41:52] can see and we're going to talk about
[41:53] that briefly. We're briefly going to
[41:56] talk about the one prior to that under
[41:57] the fifth trumpet in fifth vial. You're
[41:59] going to find where uh a star falls from
[42:02] heaven.
[42:03] Yeah.
[42:03] And that's Lucifer. And he's given the
[42:05] key to the bottomless pit. And that's
[42:07] happening right at the turn of the 20th
[42:09] century cuz it's prior to the woes.
[42:11] Yeah.
[42:11] See, uh and and so I can say, Lord, I
[42:14] can point to all that, but and yes, the
[42:16] seals are open and yes, the ministry of
[42:18] the son of man. And yes, but Lord, what
[42:20] what what am I going to point to as the
[42:22] most epic event? We're going to talk
[42:24] about Trump. What would I say? Is he the
[42:26] last is he the final last trump? I don't
[42:28] know,
[42:33] you know. Uh and then two days later,
[42:38] the world is stunned.
[42:40] The whole world is stunned. And Sister
[42:43] Mom was commenting to me on our call
[42:45] this morning. She said, "You know
[42:47] something?" She said, "Have you seen the
[42:49] the headlines of all those people there
[42:52] that were in in at the basilica there?
[42:55] How many? I forget how many. Tens of
[42:57] thousands." And she says, "They're
[42:58] they're jumping for joy and they're
[43:00] jubilant and they're they're shouting
[43:02] and glorifying." And she said, "And they
[43:04] don't know, but the bride is around the
[43:06] world shouting and glorifying God, but
[43:08] for a completely different reason.
[43:11] The same cause, but a different a
[43:12] different meaning behind it." Oh, what
[43:14] an hour that we live in, friends.
[43:18] Amen.
[43:18] So, so God bless you today. We're going
[43:20] to stand you back to your feet before I
[43:22] just keep right on going.
[43:25] And uh so just a reminder about our
[43:27] weekend coming up next weekend. And uh
[43:30] we hope you like the u temporary
[43:32] improvements we've made to the
[43:33] fellowship hall and the permanent ones
[43:34] that we're making. And so we're we're
[43:37] definitely squarely back underway again
[43:40] in our renovation. We're uh we're just
[43:42] trying to get things up and rolling
[43:43] again. So, be in prayer. What God can
[43:46] have you to do to help. Amen. We're all
[43:48] in this thing together, friends.
[43:50] Praise the Lord. All right. Uh
[43:53] Revelation this morning, I want to um
[43:56] let me see. Um
[43:59] I think I What which one did I send you
[44:02] guys?
[44:03] Uh the the scripture that we're going to
[44:05] read today.
[44:07] Six. Six. Uh eight, I think, or nine,
[44:10] didn't I? Yeah. Seven. Okay. Very good.
[44:13] Yeah. Correct. All right.
[44:16] Get my all my ducks in a row and
[44:20] Amen. all my butterflies flying in the
[44:22] same direction.
[44:27] Revelation 6:7.
[44:31] And when he had opened the fourth seal,
[44:34] I heard the voice of the fourth beast
[44:37] say, "Come and see." And I looked, and
[44:41] behold, a pale horse, and his name that
[44:44] sat on him was death, and hell followed
[44:47] with him. And power was given unto them
[44:51] over the fourth part of the earth, to
[44:54] kill with sword, and with hunger, and
[44:56] with death, and with the beast of the
[44:59] earth. Let's pray.
[45:03] Father, we are marking this day as as as
[45:07] as almost Father, a milestone. Not
[45:11] almost, but definitely a milestone,
[45:14] Lord. And I could not help but ponder
[45:16] the ramifications of it for these number
[45:19] of days. Even as I stepped onto the
[45:22] landing, Lord, to walk onto the
[45:24] platform. And I thought, Lord, I'm
[45:27] walking onto this platform today under
[45:29] another milestone. Something that we
[45:31] have looked for that's been on the
[45:33] books, Father, for decades. and the
[45:36] while the world just sees it as a
[45:37] surprising turn, they have no no idea
[45:41] the the the height and depth and breadth
[45:43] of what it means. Father, I pray for
[45:46] your mercy today as we look into your
[45:48] word. I commit myself into your hands
[45:52] and ask your blessing to be upon us now
[45:55] as we look at it very carefully and Lord
[45:58] uh very humbly in Jesus Christ's name.
[46:01] Amen. God bless you friends. You can be
[46:04] seated.
[46:27] when last we left off, we were speaking
[46:32] about the six kingdoms there. We we read
[46:34] it out of the Old Testament and how that
[46:38] there was prophecy concerning these six
[46:40] kingdoms. And one of the if not the last
[46:44] point that we concluded with and I
[46:46] thought that it was worth repeating
[46:48] today is that we looked at a span of
[46:53] time. We looked over six kingdoms.
[46:56] Kingdoms that had been very powerful in
[46:58] their day. Kingdoms that had had great
[47:01] grandeur. Um and and we we and they
[47:05] covered a span of three centuries, a
[47:09] little more than three centuries, and
[47:12] involved somewhere between 5 and a half
[47:14] to 10 million people. And that, of
[47:17] course, that's just as I remember when I
[47:19] was doing my research, that's at the
[47:20] peak uh with all of their peak
[47:23] populations recorded. It's not to say
[47:26] every single human every single human
[47:28] that lived over 300 years in those in
[47:31] those uh kingdoms would probably um
[47:34] impact that number quite a bit. But but
[47:37] in their peak adding them all together
[47:39] and it's a little bit difficult with
[47:41] ancient history because the records
[47:43] aren't quite as good. But we found that
[47:46] the closest estimates put it between 5
[47:49] to 10 million over three centuries. and
[47:52] all of those people and all of that life
[47:54] and all of those families and all of
[47:56] those jobs and careers and governments
[47:58] and politics and kings and palaces and
[48:01] armies and wars and battles and
[48:03] vacations and taxes and everything.
[48:05] Three centuries worth of of 5 to 10
[48:08] million people and God summed it up in
[48:11] 32 verses of a single chapter in the in
[48:15] in one book of the entire Bible.
[48:18] And that was impactful to me. And you
[48:21] know we brother Brandham when he
[48:24] preached leadership I it's always been
[48:27] one of my favorite sermons there in
[48:29] Cavina one of the it was actually his
[48:31] last text sermon full text sermon he
[48:34] preached communion there in Tucson uh is
[48:37] the very last but this as a full text
[48:39] sermon he preaches leadership where he's
[48:42] com contrasting Moses with Pharaoh and
[48:46] uh and and you know we were we were
[48:48] talking about the whole premise was the
[48:50] difference between Moses uh end and
[48:54] Pharaoh's end. And yet in life they had
[48:57] very contrasting life. Moses had every
[49:00] opportunity for riches and and treasures
[49:03] and glory and fame and fortune and he
[49:05] could have had all of that. But the
[49:07] Bible talks about, brother Caleb was
[49:09] actually talking about that this
[49:10] morning, how that, you know, Moses when
[49:13] he looked upon the suffering of of of
[49:18] Israel, that's that doesn't mean he
[49:21] didn't see the riches of Egypt,
[49:23] right? Amen.
[49:24] But he made a conscious decision looking
[49:28] at Egypt, looking at the treasures. And
[49:31] Paul said that Paul mentions that you
[49:34] know Moses was not unaware of the
[49:38] opportunity that laid at his feet. He
[49:40] was not unaware of the treasures and the
[49:43] riches and the fame that he could have.
[49:45] But we realize that looking at that he
[49:48] turned his gaze toward suffering, toward
[49:52] hardship. And you say, why would anybody
[49:55] in their right mind turn away from
[49:58] fortune and glory to suffering and
[50:00] hardship? And the only reasonable
[50:03] explanation is that the is that the
[50:06] hardship joined him to a family
[50:09] and riches and glory joined him to a
[50:12] family. And Moses was deciding which
[50:16] family do I want to be identified with?
[50:19] And that's a choice that we all make
[50:21] today. You're here identifying because
[50:25] there's only two families according to
[50:26] the gospels. Jesus said that that that a
[50:30] that a man went and sowed seed and then
[50:33] later an enemy came. There was only the
[50:35] Lord of the harvest and the enemy
[50:37] and one swed weed and one swed tears and
[50:40] there wasn't, you know, we got all kinds
[50:42] of nations and all kinds of ethnicities,
[50:44] but at the end of the day, it's the
[50:46] family of God. It's the seed line of
[50:49] Christ or it's not. It's the world. It's
[50:51] the children of the wicked one. It's the
[50:53] children of the enemy. And the whole
[50:55] world today is deciding what what family
[51:00] do they want to be identified with. And
[51:04] Moses was saying, I will let go of all
[51:07] of this riches and treasures and glory,
[51:10] and I'll take the way with the despised
[51:13] family.
[51:14] Amen.
[51:15] The family of hardship. Because do you
[51:17] think Moses is regretting that decision
[51:19] today?
[51:20] Amen.
[51:21] Do you think Pharaoh's probably
[51:23] regretting his decision today?
[51:26] Because the Bible talks about how he
[51:28] descended down. And can you imag and and
[51:31] I this this just blew my mind last time
[51:32] we were talking about it because it was
[51:35] it's hard to to grasp that that the that
[51:40] the sense of suffering and loss and f
[51:43] and the the impossible finality of what
[51:47] must be in the minds of those people who
[51:51] leave this world and descend into the
[51:54] pit. Yes.
[51:55] And you I I would say to you today that
[51:57] you cannot imagine the the the uh the
[52:01] unimaginable finality
[52:04] that there's nothing you can do now and
[52:06] it's over and there's no coming back
[52:09] from that. And Pharaoh so bad
[52:13] was that upon his mind that he actually
[52:16] took comfort that he wasn't there by
[52:20] himself
[52:21] that other sinners and ungodly who he
[52:24] knew to be ungodly as he was was there
[52:27] with him. Can you imagine what state of
[52:30] mind that you would have to suddenly be
[52:32] in that the that your comfort is is
[52:37] comforted in the fact that well all of
[52:40] us sinners are all in this together. I
[52:43] don't want to be in all of that
[52:44] together.
[52:45] Hallelujah. I want to be I want to make
[52:47] the choice Moses made. And we didn't
[52:49] even mention brother Brandham comes to
[52:51] the rich young ruler. We didn't even
[52:52] talk about him. But I'm afraid that that
[52:56] that a life, you know, um that that ends
[53:00] up there, a life that descends into that
[53:03] pit can only be described as one
[53:07] ultimately crowned with unimaginable
[53:11] bitterness, un inconsolable sadness and
[53:15] resignation to its fate. We see that in
[53:18] Daniel 7. We see that in Matthew 25. We
[53:21] see that in Revelation 20. No one, as
[53:24] I've said to you so many times again and
[53:26] again and again, no one's crying foul at
[53:28] the judgment bar. There's just a
[53:30] resignation. There's a taking ownership
[53:32] that I had a chance, I blew it, and it's
[53:34] over. And now, the one the one
[53:36] description that always gets me is that
[53:39] people will nash their teeth.
[53:42] And and I know that real nashing of
[53:45] teeth comes when the bitterness is so
[53:49] intolerable. when the bitterness of what
[53:52] could have been and what you missed out
[53:55] on. And I think that somehow when they
[53:57] see their fate versus our fate, the
[54:00] nashing of teeth, the bitterness, the
[54:03] loss, the sadness, the missed
[54:05] opportunity. Oh, friends, don't be part
[54:08] of that crowd.
[54:10] You want to be on that day with your
[54:11] hands up around the father's throne
[54:13] rejoicing, saying, "I'm so glad you
[54:16] called and I'm so glad I answered.
[54:21] We we tied it back to twin altars in the
[54:24] book of Genesis and how that Cain and
[54:26] Abel it all started from there and how
[54:29] that brother Brandham had showed us that
[54:31] you're going to worship something and so
[54:34] so you know um you're going to worship
[54:38] something
[54:39] and that's a statement that brother
[54:41] Brandham would make often.
[54:44] Uh it's a a dire statement. You're going
[54:47] to worship something. It's a determined
[54:49] statement. It's a definitive statement.
[54:51] It's a last will and testament. It's a
[54:53] final decree kind of a statement. And no
[54:56] matter what you think about it, it's a
[54:59] prophetic declaration and quite
[55:01] unbreakable.
[55:02] Amen. Amen.
[55:04] Quite unbreakable.
[55:06] You're going to worship something.
[55:10] It's one that cannot be avoided.
[55:14] And so when we when we look and let's
[55:18] have my PowerPoint, brothers,
[55:21] I'll turn off and turn back on.
[55:26] We were covering these four gentile
[55:29] kingdoms. We brought you there. The
[55:32] lion, the bear, the the leopard. In one
[55:34] other case, it's a goat. And then you've
[55:37] because it just depends on which prophet
[55:38] is describing it. In one case, it's an
[55:40] eagle instead of a lion. and another and
[55:42] so then you've got but always the fourth
[55:44] one is this is this incredibly terrible
[55:47] creature.
[55:48] So whether it's a lion or an eagle or
[55:51] whether it's a bear or ram or whether
[55:53] it's a leopard or a goat, the fourth one
[55:55] is undeniably something different.
[55:59] And he he has in one place he has iron
[56:02] teeth and he there's no one that can
[56:04] stand before him. And we we we know that
[56:08] this paralleled history perfectly. We're
[56:11] here in Daniel. This was the vision, the
[56:14] dream of Nebuchadnezzar with the head of
[56:16] gold and the the breastplates of and
[56:18] it's all silver and it comes down to
[56:20] bronze and then goes down to iron and
[56:21] then goes out into the feet of the
[56:23] fourth kingdom is a mystery. And the
[56:26] fourth kingdom is left a mystery that it
[56:29] would take a prophet to unlock
[56:31] definitively. Now, you've got all kinds
[56:34] of Bible teachers and students comparing
[56:36] verse with verse, and they hit and miss,
[56:38] and they hit quite a bit and miss quite
[56:40] a bit.
[56:41] And what I find is is that is that they
[56:44] hit on some of the obvious stuff, but
[56:46] the parts that they miss on are some of
[56:49] the most consequential things.
[56:52] The whole world is looking for an
[56:54] antichrist and trying to avoid it. And
[56:56] nobody knows that they just set it on a
[57:00] throne.
[57:01] Amen. Amen.
[57:03] They're they're looking for unity and
[57:06] they're trying to bring all of their
[57:08] organizations and denominations
[57:10] together. Sister Jean was just telling
[57:11] me about this new movement that made
[57:14] headlines where they're they're
[57:16] gathering of all denominations and
[57:18] they're saying, "Come down to the river.
[57:19] Come to the ocean. Come wherever." And
[57:21] they just had one. And I think they had
[57:23] 7,000 people from various denominations.
[57:25] Doesn't matter what you believe. We're
[57:26] all going to come and get baptized. All
[57:28] right.
[57:30] And you can see that that the whole
[57:32] thing of union and the whole thing of
[57:34] conglomeration and the whole thing of
[57:36] coming together and the whole thing of
[57:38] uh in the name of unity and the whole
[57:41] world is looking for that because
[57:43] they're looking for peace and safety.
[57:45] Yeah.
[57:46] But and and all of their Bible teachers
[57:48] who are students comparing verse with
[57:50] verse are saying this is the ticket.
[57:52] This is the way. This is how we go
[57:54] forward. This is how we'll survive. And
[57:56] they don't realize that that's actually
[57:59] a trap.
[58:00] And the prophet said it's a trap. It's a
[58:03] death trap. Denominationalism will lead
[58:05] you to the mark of the beast.
[58:07] Amen.
[58:08] See, so there's two things notable that
[58:12] brother Brandham talks about
[58:15] and and and of things that will lead you
[58:18] that will lead the world to the mark of
[58:20] the beast. One is denominationalism
[58:24] and the other is rock and roll music.
[58:26] Amen.
[58:28] Amen.
[58:29] Worldly music.
[58:31] Because remember music wasn't in in the
[58:34] creation. Music predated creation.
[58:37] Yeah.
[58:37] They were all there was already music
[58:39] and worship
[58:40] and musicians and song leaders prior to
[58:44] prior to Genesis. See? And so God God
[58:48] was already receiving worship before we
[58:51] find that Genesis verse one chap uh
[58:55] chapter chapter 1 verse two begins now
[58:58] in the beginning he created the heavens
[58:59] and the earth. So and brother Brandon
[59:01] talks about he created angels and then
[59:02] they begin to worship him. So you have
[59:05] to be so careful about the kind of music
[59:08] that you listen to. This is exact
[59:10] because music is supernatural.
[59:12] It predates creation. And you have to be
[59:14] very why do you think it makes you move?
[59:17] Your body intrinsically has a rhythm to
[59:20] it. And and when that certain rhythm and
[59:22] that certain beat and actually people
[59:24] who who study the science of music
[59:26] understand the beats and I don't
[59:28] understand it all. Uh I' I've looked at
[59:30] it a little bit, but it's it's
[59:32] interesting. They can take the same
[59:33] song. I I saw a man uh do it just the
[59:36] other day and he just took the song
[59:38] Jesus loves me. This I know for the
[59:41] Bible tells me so.
[59:42] Amen. And he just started talking about
[59:44] putting it on this certain beat. Jesus
[59:46] loves me. This I know for the Bible
[59:48] tells me so. It's very mundane. And so
[59:50] he just says now we just change up the
[59:52] beat and the rhythm. Then it's Jesus
[59:54] loves me and the and the and the beat is
[59:56] coming around. This I know. And he said
[1:00:00] and then it's a beautiful little song
[1:00:01] that children he said now let me just
[1:00:03] alter it again. And then it's and then
[1:00:05] suddenly the beat is different and it's
[1:00:07] the same song and then he alters it
[1:00:09] again and it literally it looks like
[1:00:11] something that you find out in the world
[1:00:13] like they took the lyrics of that song
[1:00:15] and made a horrible worldly song out of
[1:00:17] it.
[1:00:17] Amen.
[1:00:18] See and all they did was change beat and
[1:00:21] rhythm and and so that kind of stuff. So
[1:00:25] so if you'll notice in brother
[1:00:26] Brandham's vision that they were
[1:00:29] following a witch dancing to the beat of
[1:00:32] rock and roll. Yeah.
[1:00:33] And that's a that's a general term.
[1:00:35] Brother Brandham is just using rock and
[1:00:37] roll because that was the early ages of
[1:00:40] worldly music.
[1:00:41] Now it's metamorphosis into, you know, a
[1:00:44] dozen different uh genres. It's all the
[1:00:46] same thing. It's all led by the devil.
[1:00:48] Amen.
[1:00:49] And you know, so so you you even I mean
[1:00:52] they don't realize that they're
[1:00:54] following a pi piper. They're literally
[1:00:56] in a trance of a siren song being led to
[1:00:58] the rocks. Yeah.
[1:01:00] So when you find, you know, Homer and
[1:01:03] different ones writing of these things,
[1:01:05] those aren't accidents. These are things
[1:01:07] that humanity has understood.
[1:01:10] Amen.
[1:01:10] That that that e even even in his Greek
[1:01:13] mythology that that people were
[1:01:15] shipwrecked because of singing.
[1:01:18] Yeah.
[1:01:19] Amen.
[1:01:19] See, and they write a story about the
[1:01:21] pied piper. is all part of uh mankind's
[1:01:25] who he doesn't realize how connected he
[1:01:28] is to the spiritual world. A lot of them
[1:01:31] think there is no such thing as the
[1:01:32] spiritual world. It's more real than
[1:01:34] this world.
[1:01:36] Amen.
[1:01:36] There's a realm beyond this realm. You
[1:01:38] don't even see it. You nothing you have
[1:01:40] to contact it. But it is very
[1:01:42] influential.
[1:01:43] Yes. Amen.
[1:01:44] And it will guide your life. Young
[1:01:46] people be careful. We're living in a day
[1:01:49] where digital media consumption, I mean,
[1:01:52] unless you're going to, let's just be
[1:01:53] honest, unless you're going to go live
[1:01:55] in a commune, you're going to have a
[1:01:57] screen in front of you somewhere.
[1:01:59] I mean, to even operate in business, to
[1:02:01] even be in school, to even do anything,
[1:02:03] everything has went that way. We used to
[1:02:05] worry about a picture show or a
[1:02:07] television in our house, and we carry
[1:02:10] them around in our pocket.
[1:02:12] See, and and I'm not preaching against
[1:02:14] that stuff. I'm simply saying Paul knew
[1:02:16] we lived in the world and he knew we
[1:02:18] couldn't go out of the world. Someday we
[1:02:19] will. But but while we're in the world,
[1:02:22] we don't abuse it. We we keep a line of
[1:02:25] separation and keep the blood of Jesus
[1:02:27] to over your mind and over your heart.
[1:02:29] You need to pray pray constantly. Lord
[1:02:31] God, protect my mind. Protect my heart.
[1:02:34] God, clean my spirit. That's what the
[1:02:36] advantage of coming to church does.
[1:02:39] It's what reading your Bible does. What
[1:02:40] praying does.
[1:02:41] Amen.
[1:02:42] It's cleaning. It cleans your mind,
[1:02:44] cleans your spirit.
[1:02:46] I've seen people I've known it. I've
[1:02:48] seen it many times.
[1:02:49] Yeah.
[1:02:51] People who were not actually born again,
[1:02:54] but just came to church every week,
[1:02:56] two and three times a week, and they
[1:02:58] stayed living a clean life.
[1:03:00] And as soon as they quit coming to
[1:03:01] church, they went straight into the
[1:03:03] world. Amen.
[1:03:04] What What did that because they were not
[1:03:05] born again, but coming into church two
[1:03:07] to three times a week kept washing them,
[1:03:10] washing them, washing them, and it would
[1:03:12] refocus and repurpose them. And they and
[1:03:14] they would live a a varying degree of
[1:03:16] sanctification. Uh and there and brother
[1:03:19] Brandham called it living off the spirit
[1:03:21] of the church.
[1:03:23] So I I'm not against that. I'm happy. If
[1:03:26] you're not born again, I'm glad you're
[1:03:27] here. I wish I wish you'd come every
[1:03:30] service and let me wash you. Let me
[1:03:32] clean you up. Amen. And let me keep you
[1:03:34] near the well of water of life so that
[1:03:37] the that the Holy Spirit might get a
[1:03:39] hold of your heart one of these days.
[1:03:41] Amen.
[1:03:44] This is why we run a church like a
[1:03:46] hospital. We don't require people to be
[1:03:49] born again to come here.
[1:03:50] Amen.
[1:03:51] We only require decency and respect.
[1:03:54] And anyone who wants to come and hear
[1:03:56] the word of God is welcome to as long as
[1:03:57] they come decently and respectfully.
[1:04:01] Amen.
[1:04:02] So, so we realize then that
[1:04:06] that that these these kingdoms it was
[1:04:09] left as a mystery and
[1:04:13] students comparing verse with verse.
[1:04:15] This is exactly why brother Brandham
[1:04:17] said to unlock these mysteries like the
[1:04:20] mystery of the fourth kingdom, the
[1:04:23] mystery of redemption itself. Paul
[1:04:25] called it a mystery.
[1:04:26] Amen.
[1:04:26] Amen. the mystery under the seven seals.
[1:04:30] So the mi the mystery of the of the book
[1:04:32] of life, the mystery surrounding
[1:04:33] election, marriage and divorce, baptism,
[1:04:36] the original sin.
[1:04:38] Amen.
[1:04:38] That it would take more than just a
[1:04:41] student comparing verse with verse.
[1:04:44] Though that's good,
[1:04:45] that can hit. But like I said, a lot of
[1:04:48] the things they miss are the most
[1:04:49] consequential things. And so it would
[1:04:52] take somebody more than just a student
[1:04:54] comparing verse with verse. Though
[1:04:56] that's good, it would take someone with
[1:04:58] prophetic insight.
[1:05:00] Prophetic insight. Listen, God had
[1:05:03] already sent reformers and that had not
[1:05:06] brought the restoration.
[1:05:09] God had already sent brilliant men under
[1:05:11] the my under the man age. Men like
[1:05:13] Luther, men like Wesley, men like
[1:05:14] Calvin, men like Knox, great brilliant
[1:05:17] men, men like Pink, men like uh uh uh
[1:05:21] Scofield and and and men like Dr. price
[1:05:24] and great great scholars and had not
[1:05:27] brought the mystery and had not unlocked
[1:05:30] the seven seals. It took somebody with
[1:05:32] prophetic insight who actually had very
[1:05:34] little formal education to get in the
[1:05:37] way.
[1:05:40] I don't understand why people can't see
[1:05:43] the simplicity of God in that. Amen.
[1:05:47] So, we realize then that
[1:05:51] that this this white horse writer, let
[1:05:53] me let me do one quick thing here. See
[1:05:55] where I'm see where I want to pull up
[1:05:57] first. All right. So,
[1:06:02] so we we find then that it tracks all
[1:06:04] the way in this mystery. Fourth kingdom
[1:06:06] of course is Rome. And it once it gets
[1:06:08] into the feet, it's going to be mingled
[1:06:12] iron and clay. It started out gold and
[1:06:14] it comes down to finally clay, iron and
[1:06:16] then iron and mixed with clay and it
[1:06:18] goes all the way out to the two big
[1:06:20] toes.
[1:06:22] And the the next event is a stone is cut
[1:06:26] out of the mountain of God without hands
[1:06:29] and rolls and strikes it in the feet
[1:06:32] showing what age that's going to happen
[1:06:34] in. Not in the head. It strikes it in
[1:06:36] the feet and destroys it. And then and
[1:06:39] then from there the millennium is on.
[1:06:41] But so so we're looking then
[1:06:44] chronologically at the two big toes and
[1:06:47] it's not going to go past that. Now
[1:06:48] brother Brandham shows that the two big
[1:06:51] toes were represented in Nikita Cruchef
[1:06:56] in one and Dwight David Eisenhower in
[1:06:59] the other
[1:07:00] because one means iron, one means clay.
[1:07:01] And how do you make that up? How's that
[1:07:04] an accident? One means clay, one man.
[1:07:06] They're both world leaders.
[1:07:08] And you've got one standing at the UN
[1:07:11] striking the podium with his shoe.
[1:07:14] Not his watch, not his not a
[1:07:15] handkerchief. He pulls his shoe off. I
[1:07:18] read his testimony myself in his memoirs
[1:07:22] uh translated into English. And Cruchef
[1:07:24] says, "I don't know why I did that."
[1:07:28] Amen.
[1:07:28] He said, "I have no idea. I didn't even
[1:07:31] know I did it till they told me I did
[1:07:33] it." That's his words.
[1:07:35] He said, "I just wanted to pound on
[1:07:37] something and make a point." And he
[1:07:38] said, "I just reached around for
[1:07:40] something and he said, "I guess I
[1:07:41] grabbed my shoe and started pounding
[1:07:43] it."
[1:07:45] And and then he had to put it back on.
[1:07:47] So, here's a man that somehow went out
[1:07:50] of his rational thinking, didn't even
[1:07:53] know he did it.
[1:07:55] Amen.
[1:07:56] You think they won't take the mark of
[1:07:58] the beast and not knowing that they're
[1:07:59] doing it?
[1:08:01] Let me tell you something, friends.
[1:08:03] History is controlled by the
[1:08:04] supernatural.
[1:08:05] Amen.
[1:08:06] And prophecy gives us understanding of
[1:08:08] what has been and what will be and what
[1:08:12] is right now. Thank God
[1:08:15] because I already know my future is
[1:08:18] bright.
[1:08:19] Amen.
[1:08:20] I want to know about today. What do I
[1:08:22] need to do while I'm still here, Lord?
[1:08:25] How do I serve you? How do I serve your
[1:08:27] people? How do I go forward and gain
[1:08:30] glory for your wonderful name?
[1:08:33] Amen.
[1:08:35] So, so the big toes now it doesn't mean
[1:08:38] now catch this is an important point.
[1:08:41] It does not mean that the rapture had to
[1:08:45] come with Kruef and Eisenhower.
[1:08:48] What it was simply meaning was is that's
[1:08:50] the final order that's going to lead all
[1:08:52] the way out.
[1:08:53] And by the that order won't change.
[1:08:55] It'll be iron and clay mixed. It'll be
[1:08:59] these two superpowers going headtohead.
[1:09:01] And brother Brandham talks about Russia,
[1:09:04] an iron curtain and China. He says,
[1:09:06] "Watch red China, a bamboo curtain." He
[1:09:09] said, "Now don't be afraid of them. Just
[1:09:11] watch them."
[1:09:11] Right?
[1:09:12] Because they inform your thinking. And
[1:09:15] so you've got Russia and China, and then
[1:09:18] you've got the United States, and you've
[1:09:20] got Rome. And I'm sorry if the United
[1:09:23] States gets offended at that, but please
[1:09:25] tell me how our entire Supreme Court,
[1:09:28] twothirds of our Congress and more than
[1:09:29] half of Trump's cabinet are Roman
[1:09:31] Catholic.
[1:09:33] And there would have been a time when a
[1:09:35] Catholic would have never held a seat in
[1:09:37] government at all.
[1:09:39] When Jimmy Carter brought the Pope over
[1:09:41] here in the 70s, I read an article
[1:09:44] saying he was welcomed. Whereas in the
[1:09:47] days of Abraham Lincoln, he wouldn't
[1:09:48] have even been snuck in the back door.
[1:09:51] He's welcomed in the front lawn with
[1:09:53] hundreds of reporters and the whole
[1:09:55] world to see.
[1:09:56] Yes. Amen.
[1:09:57] You think that's an accident? That's not
[1:09:59] an accident.
[1:10:01] That's history being controlled in real
[1:10:04] time by prophecy.
[1:10:06] Amen.
[1:10:07] Amen.
[1:10:10] So we when we look through
[1:10:13] the ages, I want to keep moving. I'm
[1:10:14] gonna get slowed down. So this is very
[1:10:17] familiar to us. I thought I'd give you a
[1:10:19] screen that's very familiar. Shows our
[1:10:22] our St. Paul and Irenaeus and Martin and
[1:10:25] Columba and Luther and Wesley and
[1:10:26] Elijah. And a lot of times we'll have
[1:10:29] and I in one of my slides coming up I've
[1:10:31] got it Elijah and you say why don't you
[1:10:34] just put William Brandham. Well, a
[1:10:36] couple of reasons because first of all I
[1:10:38] want the world to know that we're not
[1:10:40] following a man. We're following an
[1:10:43] office that was put into the earth and
[1:10:46] there was a prophetic office anointed by
[1:10:48] the spirit of Elijah, not the Tishbite.
[1:10:51] The spirit of Elijah is the Lord Jesus
[1:10:53] Christ.
[1:10:54] It operated in the Tishbite and then
[1:10:56] came on Elisha, then came on John and
[1:10:59] then come on a on a gentile messenger in
[1:11:02] that little interval of time between the
[1:11:04] sixth and seventh seal and the sixth and
[1:11:05] seventh trumpet. See? And so we and it's
[1:11:08] just dropping him down because it's
[1:11:11] going to take more than just students
[1:11:14] comparing verse with verse. It's
[1:11:16] bookended with prophets Paul and Elijah
[1:11:20] because in in in the beginning of the
[1:11:23] early church, the mystery of Christ is
[1:11:26] made known and they've got the full
[1:11:28] abstract title deed and they're
[1:11:31] literally ready and perfectly qualified
[1:11:33] with the token to go to the rapture. The
[1:11:35] only problem and the reason they can't,
[1:11:37] the only reason they can't is because
[1:11:39] the seed had to go into the ground and
[1:11:41] die. Jesus said that otherwise it abides
[1:11:43] alone. He was never intending just to
[1:11:45] take that first 20-year church. He he
[1:11:48] wanted to get he wanted to get Irene's
[1:11:50] day and Martin's day, Columbus's day,
[1:11:51] Luther's day, Wesley's day, my day, your
[1:11:53] day.
[1:11:54] Yes. Amen.
[1:11:55] So, he's been 2,000 years filling up the
[1:11:58] role. Now, not only that, but you have
[1:12:01] to realize that, and I'm not teaching on
[1:12:03] this today because it would take the
[1:12:04] rest of the service. I I'm going to get
[1:12:06] to it in a little in other lessons, but
[1:12:09] you realize that brother Brandham
[1:12:11] operated as a prophet because he's born
[1:12:13] a prophet,
[1:12:14] but he's operating prior to the the
[1:12:18] anointing of Malachi for Elijah. He's
[1:12:21] operating as Revelation 3:14. He's the
[1:12:24] messenger to the Leodysian church age.
[1:12:26] And he's born out of season. He gets
[1:12:28] there late to the party. He's not even
[1:12:30] born when Isuza Street hits.
[1:12:32] And he says, "By the time I got among
[1:12:34] them, I found out they were just as
[1:12:36] broke up as we Baptists were."
[1:12:38] So he spends his what he later would
[1:12:40] call background trying to pull them
[1:12:42] together. He said, "I never took neither
[1:12:44] side. I stood between them and said,
[1:12:45] "Put my arm around them all. We're
[1:12:47] brethren." He knew their doctrine was
[1:12:48] wrong. He tried to tried to solve it. It
[1:12:51] it wouldn't work eventually. that would
[1:12:54] that was not going to continue because
[1:12:56] that ministry with that anointing could
[1:12:59] not brother Brandham said the church
[1:13:01] cannot go in the condition it's in and
[1:13:04] it cannot get any better.
[1:13:06] It would take uh it would take another
[1:13:09] level. It would take next level. And
[1:13:11] that's what this opening of the seven
[1:13:13] seals were because that wasn't William
[1:13:15] Brham. That's Christ in the spirit of
[1:13:17] Elijah coming down under the prophecy of
[1:13:20] Malachi 4 to anoint a messenger who's
[1:13:22] already in the earth.
[1:13:24] Amen.
[1:13:26] Brother Ram said it's very clear that
[1:13:28] the seventh angel is already standing in
[1:13:31] the earth when the mighty angel
[1:13:33] descends.
[1:13:34] Hallelujah.
[1:13:35] So we realize that he's a dual role.
[1:13:38] He's he's a he's like Paul. He's a
[1:13:40] dispensational angel. He's not just a
[1:13:42] prophet. We have New Testament prophets,
[1:13:45] but he's a dispensational messenger like
[1:13:47] St. Paul, like Moses was. See, like John
[1:13:50] was. So, so you find these these
[1:13:53] dispensational changes all down through.
[1:13:55] I'm not teaching on that today either.
[1:13:56] All right. So, then I know I sound like
[1:13:59] him, but I'm not.
[1:14:01] So, then we come here, and I I know it's
[1:14:04] a little bit of small print. I I had to
[1:14:06] fit a lot of it in, but this is all just
[1:14:09] uh um rehearsal to us anyway. Yeah.
[1:14:12] So, Revelation 6:2, "And I saw and
[1:14:15] behold a white horse." And you can see
[1:14:17] that it was the anointing of the lion to
[1:14:19] counter it. And of course, the the white
[1:14:21] horse rode for the first three ages.
[1:14:24] Brother Brandham taught us through
[1:14:25] Paul's time, through Irene's time,
[1:14:26] through Martin's time. So, he rides all
[1:14:29] the way through Ephesus and through
[1:14:30] Smyrna in and into uh uh Per I mean um
[1:14:34] um what's my third age, Jay? Uh
[1:14:38] Sardis. Yes. Thank you. No, no, no. Uh,
[1:14:39] Pergamus or Pergamus is four. Yeah.
[1:14:41] Okay. Let me go back. I got to make sure
[1:14:44] I'm right. Yeah. Correct. Pergamus.
[1:14:46] Amen. Got you, buddy.
[1:14:50] So, Pergamus. And uh and so, so we find
[1:14:54] out then that that that white horse
[1:14:56] rider, Brother Brandham said, he rides
[1:14:57] through those first. Then, of course,
[1:14:59] you're going to go to the red horse
[1:15:00] under Columbus,
[1:15:02] and you're going to find that Revelation
[1:15:05] 6:4. From there went out another horse
[1:15:06] that was red and this was during the age
[1:15:09] of Columbus a very long time and uh it's
[1:15:11] under the ox because he's now
[1:15:13] slaughtering the Christians. He's got a
[1:15:15] sword in his hand. You can see the horse
[1:15:17] rider here. The first one he has a bow
[1:15:19] but no arrows. And I could not no matter
[1:15:24] no matter how I worded my prompt uh all
[1:15:28] of this stuff I did myself except these
[1:15:30] images down here at the bottom. And I
[1:15:32] tried every kind of of of LLM and I
[1:15:35] said, "No, don't make him a divine
[1:15:38] person. It's not Jesus. It's the
[1:15:40] Antichrist." Every time it spit it back
[1:15:42] to me and he had a halo
[1:15:45] every single time. And I thought, "Yeah,
[1:15:47] because the whole world, these students
[1:15:49] who com who just compare verse with
[1:15:51] verse think that white horse is Christ."
[1:15:54] And brother Brandham said, "I used to
[1:15:55] think that too, but I realized it's not
[1:15:57] Christ. It's Antichrist. It's a
[1:16:00] deceiver.
[1:16:02] He looks like Christ. See, but he's a
[1:16:04] deceiver. And so then he jumps off of
[1:16:07] his white horse, climbs on his red
[1:16:09] horse, he's given a sword and a crown.
[1:16:11] And then of course we go into the black
[1:16:13] horse, and this is the man age now. And
[1:16:16] Revelation 6:5, "And I beheld, and lo,
[1:16:18] black horse." And so, and he's got
[1:16:19] balances in his hand. And so on and on
[1:16:22] and on. Not I'm not trying to get slowed
[1:16:23] down teaching all this. I'm just
[1:16:24] rehearsing this for us. Is that all
[1:16:26] right? Amen.
[1:16:28] So we we find then that under this man
[1:16:31] age it's going to go in the man age uh
[1:16:34] you see the man at the top. Now as you
[1:16:37] can see I have a a distinct line at the
[1:16:39] end of Wesley and Elijah and a distinct
[1:16:42] line at the black horse and the pale
[1:16:44] horse and and it looks like and then
[1:16:46] above that the man and the eagle are
[1:16:49] very distinct. What I'm not showing on
[1:16:51] this slide, which I will show when I do
[1:16:54] a blow up of just the last two ages,
[1:16:57] when we when we zoom in. We're not doing
[1:16:58] it today. But actually, the man age runs
[1:17:02] all the way to the opening of the seals.
[1:17:04] Amen.
[1:17:06] It's manage, not the eagle age. The
[1:17:08] eagle age comes under Elijah. The eagle
[1:17:10] age comes under Malachi 4. The eagle age
[1:17:13] comes under the spirit of Christ opening
[1:17:16] the seven seals. See, so actually this
[1:17:19] is why brother Brandon would say in many
[1:17:21] respects that Leodysa meaning prior to
[1:17:24] the seals could be in many respects
[1:17:27] considered just an extension of the
[1:17:29] sixth age of Philadelphia. Now why is
[1:17:31] that so? Because we know that at the end
[1:17:35] of the Philadelphiaian age an open door
[1:17:38] was set. Now a door is always Christ and
[1:17:40] it's an open door. So now it's a brother
[1:17:42] Brandham taught us it's a it's the
[1:17:44] beginning it's the beginning of a
[1:17:46] restoration of the deity of Jesus Christ
[1:17:49] and it comes after Wesley's gone
[1:17:51] obviously because it's a because Wesley
[1:17:54] died a trinitarian so he's already gone
[1:17:57] off the scene so it's right near the end
[1:17:59] after Wesley's gone it's in that lap
[1:18:02] time that bleeding time where these
[1:18:04] things don't end like that they blend
[1:18:06] and they lap over almost like a a a
[1:18:09] relay race with the baton on and they're
[1:18:11] one is running and the other one takes
[1:18:13] off running and the this one's still
[1:18:14] running and there's an there's an
[1:18:16] exchange and then this one slows down
[1:18:18] and goes off the track and that one
[1:18:19] takes off for the finish line. So that's
[1:18:21] what you're seeing which is not
[1:18:22] reflected here. So we we find then that
[1:18:26] that that
[1:18:28] he would that it's a a restoration and a
[1:18:31] beginning of the restoration. It's not
[1:18:33] the opening of the seventh seal but it
[1:18:35] is a beginning to restore the deity of
[1:18:39] Jesus Christ. This is why brother
[1:18:40] Brandham in one of his earliest sermons
[1:18:42] if not his earliest one in 1949 what's
[1:18:45] when you go to the table what do we have
[1:18:46] the deity of Jesus Christ because this
[1:18:50] is this is the this is what brought the
[1:18:52] oneness and people started saying no
[1:18:53] he's not three gods of course they went
[1:18:55] off into the ditch of oneness and
[1:18:57] brother Brandham said yeah you're wrong
[1:18:58] you're wrong as the trinitarian but for
[1:19:00] different reasons and so it took the
[1:19:02] seventh seal to identify the family of
[1:19:04] God in the godhead it took the opening
[1:19:07] of the seventh seal that's why brother
[1:19:08] Brandham taught us. You as a bornag
[1:19:11] again child of God, you are part of
[1:19:14] God's godhead.
[1:19:15] Amen. Amen.
[1:19:16] Find that in the average Sunday morning
[1:19:18] pull pit.
[1:19:20] Find that with students comparing verse
[1:19:22] with verse.
[1:19:23] It's only a prophet under prophetic
[1:19:25] insight can grasp that. See,
[1:19:27] because it's he would say Christ is the
[1:19:30] beginning of the creation of God. You
[1:19:33] are the continuation of that same
[1:19:36] creation.
[1:19:37] It's Mr. Jesus. dismisses Jesus.
[1:19:39] Amen.
[1:19:40] I still got you.
[1:19:42] I'm waiting for smoke to come out of
[1:19:43] ears. I want to make sure. You stay with
[1:19:45] me. I I don't want to see you in there
[1:19:47] blinking like, "Wait, what?" So, I'm
[1:19:49] trying to go slow. In fact, I haven't
[1:19:51] used a lot of slides because I think I
[1:19:53] can explain it better and let you use
[1:19:54] your own imagination.
[1:19:56] So, so we find out and you don't got to
[1:19:58] remember everything I'm saying now. I'm
[1:20:00] just walking you through it a little
[1:20:01] bit. I'm just walking you through modern
[1:20:04] events made clear again in prophecy.
[1:20:07] Amen.
[1:20:08] So we realize then that that Wesley's
[1:20:11] gone and so quite naturally then you're
[1:20:14] going to start to get what would later
[1:20:17] become what we would call the Isuza
[1:20:20] revival and we called it Pentecost now
[1:20:23] and we call it that. I call it that.
[1:20:26] Brother Brandham called it that. It was
[1:20:28] what they called themselves.
[1:20:30] But of course brother Brandham
[1:20:32] had enough understanding and taught us
[1:20:34] very clearly. Okay. In one way, and this
[1:20:38] is brother Jason's word, to call a Zuza
[1:20:40] Pentecost is a misnomer because
[1:20:44] Pentecost was what they had at the early
[1:20:47] church and that's what's restored.
[1:20:49] That's what Paul had. That's what Peter
[1:20:51] had. And that's restored only under the
[1:20:53] seventh seal. So, it's not the long
[1:20:55] awaited restoration. It's a it's a third
[1:20:59] element of a four stage restoration of
[1:21:02] the bride tree that began in Luther went
[1:21:05] into Wesley and comes as a third stage
[1:21:07] of restoration. This is exactly why some
[1:21:10] people they conflate in error they they
[1:21:13] m they mix up three works of grace
[1:21:16] because they say well it it's it's like
[1:21:18] the message is the fourth work of grace.
[1:21:20] It's not. You're you're conflating the
[1:21:23] works of grace which are always three.
[1:21:25] You're conflating that with the
[1:21:27] restoration of the bride tree, which is
[1:21:28] four.
[1:21:29] Amen.
[1:21:30] So, but but what that is of revival
[1:21:33] would eventually become, although no one
[1:21:35] knew it at the time, it would eventually
[1:21:37] become the shuck.
[1:21:40] Amen.
[1:21:40] It would put Christ out and reject the
[1:21:42] seven seal.
[1:21:43] Amen.
[1:21:44] And finally put out its prophet
[1:21:46] messenger. And brother Brandham said
[1:21:48] Pentecost, meaning that re th the the
[1:21:51] remnants of that great revival could not
[1:21:54] receive the seals. Now, so I said all
[1:21:57] that so you understand and able to grasp
[1:21:59] this next screen. So, we're going to see
[1:22:03] that I've got it pretty much here like a
[1:22:05] line of demarcation and it's not quite
[1:22:07] that that that neat. Uh there's a lot of
[1:22:10] blending and we'll we'll break it down
[1:22:11] when we take a closer look at it. But
[1:22:14] here's something that's strange. You
[1:22:15] remember when brother it's not strange
[1:22:18] anymore. You remember when brother
[1:22:19] Brandham talks about that Russia when
[1:22:23] they had their revolution and Linen came
[1:22:26] in for the second time. He failed the
[1:22:27] first time, but he comes back for a
[1:22:29] second try and he takes it and they
[1:22:31] actually execute Nicholas and his
[1:22:33] family.
[1:22:34] And uh how many remember some history
[1:22:35] lesson here?
[1:22:36] Amen.
[1:22:37] And they they chose communism. And
[1:22:39] brother Brandham said the reason that
[1:22:40] they chose communism was because they
[1:22:43] rejected the Holy Ghost when it fell.
[1:22:45] Yeah.
[1:22:46] Amen. And for years I wondered I thought
[1:22:49] huh when how when did when when did the
[1:22:53] Holy Ghost fall in Russia? And I found
[1:22:56] out that the Holy Ghost revival struck
[1:22:58] in Armenia which was part of the Russian
[1:23:00] Empire and spread and and burgeoned
[1:23:04] beautifully and it actually it actually
[1:23:08] started around 1890. And the zar at the
[1:23:11] time was Alexander II. And he actually
[1:23:16] had some moral fiber about him obviously
[1:23:18] because he actually allowed it to
[1:23:20] flourish.
[1:23:22] But here but but when he but here's two
[1:23:24] things that happened pretty close. He
[1:23:27] passed away and his son which was
[1:23:31] Alexander III predating pre previous
[1:23:34] coming he come just before Nicholas.
[1:23:37] Alexander III
[1:23:39] started preaching Russification
[1:23:42] and he did not because what had happened
[1:23:44] among the Armenians now get your
[1:23:47] thinking caps on is that that revival in
[1:23:50] Armenia a Holy Ghost revival. So it it
[1:23:53] it was genuinely a Holy Ghost revival.
[1:23:56] Brother Brandham called it that.
[1:23:57] Amen. But what it done was is it started
[1:24:00] spurring a spirit of nationalism
[1:24:03] among the Armenians and they wanted to
[1:24:05] have suddenly their own identity. They
[1:24:07] wanted to have their we're not exactly
[1:24:09] Russian and and Russification is like no
[1:24:11] no no no no we're not having a
[1:24:13] nationalist spirit. You're you're going
[1:24:15] to belong you're going to be part of
[1:24:16] Russia. You're Russian. You're Slavic.
[1:24:19] Don't don't go getting this people's
[1:24:21] rights thing.
[1:24:22] Amen.
[1:24:24] See, because Leodysa was just starting
[1:24:26] to blend in. And Leodysia means people's
[1:24:28] rights.
[1:24:29] Yeah.
[1:24:30] And it literally it was a revival that
[1:24:33] was sent by God, but a a a sidebar or a
[1:24:37] consequence or a byproduct of that
[1:24:40] revival was a nationalism spirit. You
[1:24:43] have a president today, and I don't
[1:24:45] going to make a whole lot of this. You
[1:24:47] have a president today who swept into
[1:24:50] office and broke all records, winning
[1:24:53] popular vote, winning electoral vote,
[1:24:55] winning all the swing states, control of
[1:24:58] both houses of Congress, and it's all on
[1:25:00] a nationalist agenda.
[1:25:02] Make America great.
[1:25:04] Say, are you for it or against it? I'm
[1:25:06] for making anybody great that wants to
[1:25:07] be great. I just know I This is my
[1:25:09] great.
[1:25:12] This is my great.
[1:25:14] You say, "But aren't you an American?"
[1:25:16] Oh, no. My America died a long time ago.
[1:25:21] Oh, I I love America. I love what it
[1:25:24] used to be. I love what it was founded
[1:25:26] to be. Uh but but we realize that what
[1:25:29] they stand for today is not what I stand
[1:25:31] for. Not at all. On neither side. And
[1:25:35] and so so they're all either Republicans
[1:25:37] or they're demonrats. And so you take
[1:25:40] your pick which side of the aisle you
[1:25:42] want to be on. I just going to choose
[1:25:43] Jesus. I'll vote for him. He voted for
[1:25:46] me at Calvary. I'll vote for him now. I
[1:25:48] can't lose.
[1:25:49] That's right.
[1:25:51] So, actually what happened was was the
[1:25:55] Armenian revival because the the open
[1:25:59] door was set at the end of Philadelphia.
[1:26:03] That set a revival off in Russia from
[1:26:06] 1880 all the way through. And then when
[1:26:08] Nicholas, I'm sorry, when Alexander III
[1:26:11] got a hold of it, he started clamping
[1:26:13] down on he started crushing that
[1:26:14] nationalist spirit. And and as he's
[1:26:18] doing that, he's hindering the real Holy
[1:26:20] Ghost fililled people.
[1:26:22] Yeah.
[1:26:22] The ones who are really the ones who are
[1:26:24] we're not talking about the the
[1:26:25] political movement that came out of
[1:26:27] that. We're talking about the actual
[1:26:29] revival pe the revived people.
[1:26:32] And he started crushing it. in in fact
[1:26:34] is by the time you then when he goes off
[1:26:37] the scene, Nicholas takes over, Nicholas
[1:26:39] continues his purge and finally in 1903,
[1:26:44] Nicholas finally the death nail to it
[1:26:46] that that revival was he confiscated all
[1:26:49] their churches in 1903 and effectively
[1:26:52] ended that revival. Well, what did it
[1:26:55] do? It just simply it went from 1880 to
[1:27:00] 1903. I know this is small but but when
[1:27:04] he crushed it then it went across the
[1:27:06] channel and it fell in Wales and it
[1:27:08] became the Welsh revival
[1:27:10] and the Welsh revival lasted night 1904
[1:27:14] and 1905. So you got an Armenian revival
[1:27:17] from the early 1880s finally ending in
[1:27:20] 1903 because an open door set at the end
[1:27:23] of Philadelphia and now you've actually
[1:27:25] crossed over into Leodysian age. Now
[1:27:27] you're into the 20th century. Amen.
[1:27:31] And now that revival is put down, but
[1:27:33] can you stop God? No. Because he's he's
[1:27:36] working on something.
[1:27:38] He's working on prophecy. He's
[1:27:40] eventually going to get to California.
[1:27:42] He's eventually going to bring a
[1:27:44] prophet. He's eventually going to come
[1:27:46] down with an open book. He's eventually
[1:27:48] going to perfect a bride and redeem us
[1:27:50] and take us home.
[1:27:51] So, this is an accident. This is not
[1:27:54] accidental. This is God. This is history
[1:27:57] controlled by prophecy. Amen.
[1:28:01] And the Welsh revival ends in 1905
[1:28:04] effectively. And what happens? Is that
[1:28:06] the end of it? No. It comes all the way
[1:28:08] across the pond and it lands all the way
[1:28:10] on the west coast on and they have an
[1:28:12] Isuza Street mission. And it was such an
[1:28:14] outpouring there because it keeps
[1:28:16] building. And it was such an outpouring
[1:28:17] there that that newspaper articles
[1:28:20] recorded that the fire department was
[1:28:23] called because the neighbors thought the
[1:28:25] building was engulfed in flames. That is
[1:28:28] a bonafideed verifiable fact.
[1:28:31] And and they came because they're they
[1:28:33] got a report that the building is
[1:28:35] engulfed in flames and it was just the
[1:28:37] glory of God.
[1:28:39] Amen. These are the kind of times where
[1:28:40] brother Bradom says, you know, they were
[1:28:42] in those meetings and they're having a
[1:28:44] house meeting. And he said that there's
[1:28:46] a sister and she's up in the middle of
[1:28:48] the floor and she's going around and
[1:28:50] around under the Holy Spirit and some
[1:28:52] bad people drive by and shoot through
[1:28:54] the windows and and absolutely should
[1:28:56] have pumped her full of bullets and not
[1:28:58] one of them harmed her.
[1:29:00] See, the these are the times and and you
[1:29:02] and you get men you you know before uh
[1:29:06] the year 1900, you've already got men
[1:29:08] like Parnan Lake and and Grant. There
[1:29:11] are and and then you get Seymour and
[1:29:12] Seymour's actually preaching the
[1:29:14] experience two years before he gets it.
[1:29:16] They laugh at him because they said,
[1:29:17] "Your wife's got it. You ain't even got
[1:29:18] what you're preaching."
[1:29:20] And then finally one day, Daddy Seymour
[1:29:22] gets it himself and he's speaking in
[1:29:23] tongues. And now and now and now it's
[1:29:25] on. And then out of there, you're going
[1:29:27] to get Bos the Bosworth brothers. You're
[1:29:29] going to get Smith Wigglesworth over in
[1:29:30] England. Uh, you know, he's all revived
[1:29:32] and and then you're going to have Arthur
[1:29:34] Pink coming up out of those some of
[1:29:35] those movements. That's more of a
[1:29:36] Baptist uh fundamentalist movement Pink
[1:29:39] was. But it's but it's a revival that's
[1:29:41] sweeping everywhere.
[1:29:43] And it starts in 1906. So you've got
[1:29:46] 1800 to 1903, then 1904 to 195, and then
[1:29:51] 1906, the Isuza Mission Revival begins.
[1:29:54] And that is going to run all the way to
[1:29:57] 1963
[1:29:58] when they put Christ out of the church.
[1:30:03] But is the church done? The church is
[1:30:05] just starting
[1:30:06] and and a bride, an infant bride was
[1:30:09] born. Now listen friends, uh because but
[1:30:13] I want to say but wait, there's more.
[1:30:18] So now I don't have it on the slide
[1:30:20] today
[1:30:22] and because I didn't want to overt tax
[1:30:24] you with information. I want to just
[1:30:26] explain it in overview. I'm not teaching
[1:30:28] on it. I'm just explaining everything
[1:30:30] and believe me I'm just hitting
[1:30:31] highlights.
[1:30:33] So now
[1:30:35] when you come to all of this happening
[1:30:36] right here,
[1:30:37] yeah,
[1:30:37] you've got an Armenian revival. Why is
[1:30:40] God why why now? Why perfectly? Why does
[1:30:44] it have to be 1880 into into the 20th
[1:30:48] century, 1903 and then 1904, 1905 and
[1:30:51] then 1906 and then it's sweeping?
[1:30:54] Because what's happening is is while
[1:30:59] while the church ages are rolling for
[1:31:02] the Gentiles
[1:31:04] and seals are unfolding, first seal,
[1:31:06] second seal. Now, we didn't know that.
[1:31:08] We didn't know it was a charting of the
[1:31:10] history until the seals were open and
[1:31:11] then we looked back and went, "Oh, it
[1:31:13] was a charting the early church under
[1:31:14] the white horse and then the martyrs
[1:31:16] under the red horse and then the dark
[1:31:17] the black horse under the dark ages."
[1:31:19] Now we get it.
[1:31:20] Well, see the trumpets are doing the
[1:31:22] exact same thing. They're and that's
[1:31:23] what Moses and Elijah are going to
[1:31:25] reveal. Just like a prophet came to us
[1:31:26] and revealed what was happening under
[1:31:28] the seven seal under under all the seven
[1:31:30] seals. And we're like, "Wow." And what
[1:31:31] does that do? It encouraged our faith.
[1:31:33] Now we understand the history and I
[1:31:35] understand the future because the
[1:31:37] history hit. I know the future will hit
[1:31:39] and I understand what's happening now.
[1:31:41] So I have no fear.
[1:31:43] I my my head my heart is not troubled
[1:31:45] with fear. Perilous times are not
[1:31:47] putting me in fear because I know what's
[1:31:50] happening.
[1:31:52] Amen.
[1:31:52] I the book has been opened to us
[1:31:55] and we have the mind of Christ. And so
[1:31:57] our hearts are not failing for fear like
[1:32:00] the world.
[1:32:01] Amen.
[1:32:03] Satan cannot deceive us because we have
[1:32:06] the word opened to us.
[1:32:08] Amen.
[1:32:08] And when you have the word opened to
[1:32:10] you, Satan has no chance to deceive you.
[1:32:13] See, because that that the word that's
[1:32:14] when it's really open to you, that's the
[1:32:16] word is a person. It's Christ born in
[1:32:18] you and he's revealing his word to you
[1:32:20] through a prophetic ministry. Oh my
[1:32:22] goodness, friends. If I thought that
[1:32:24] this was just the doctrinal teaching of
[1:32:25] a hillbilly, I I would almost be
[1:32:27] embarrassed to tell anybody about it.
[1:32:29] But when I can tell them that the
[1:32:30] blinded eyes are open and the lame walk
[1:32:32] and the deaf hear and the dead are
[1:32:34] raised and the secrets of men's hearts
[1:32:36] are made known and there's signs in the
[1:32:38] heavens and in the earth and and and and
[1:32:40] there and it's indisputable all all
[1:32:43] through history.
[1:32:44] You can't do that. That's what that's
[1:32:46] what Dr. Davis argued brother Brandham
[1:32:49] against. He said, "Billy, you're just a
[1:32:51] boy. You're not even educated. You're
[1:32:54] going to pray for kings."
[1:32:56] Billy, what's gotten into you? you come
[1:32:58] to your senses, young man. Uh, and he
[1:33:00] said, "Well, Dr. Davis, all I know is
[1:33:02] that's what he told me. I'd pray for
[1:33:03] kings and monarchs." Did he? Yep.
[1:33:05] Amen.
[1:33:06] Have those families, the royal family of
[1:33:08] England testified. Absolutely. It's on
[1:33:09] record. He was there and prayed for the
[1:33:11] king and he was healed.
[1:33:13] I mean, friends, these things weren't
[1:33:14] done in a corner. It went around the
[1:33:16] world.
[1:33:17] People can say what they want and try to
[1:33:19] deny it now, but 70 years ago, all the
[1:33:22] living witnesses knew it was true.
[1:33:25] Not going to argue with dingdongs. want
[1:33:27] to try to say they know better now than
[1:33:29] the people who lived back then. Give me
[1:33:31] a break. I don't know whether to be more
[1:33:32] insulted of what you're saying or or to
[1:33:34] be more insulted that you think I would
[1:33:36] believe it.
[1:33:37] My goodness. I can read the record of of
[1:33:39] his peers. I can read the record of the
[1:33:41] men who didn't even agree with his
[1:33:43] doctrine but knew he was a godly man.
[1:33:45] That's a man who went 33 years and never
[1:33:47] had an accusation brought against him.
[1:33:49] Not women, not money, not popularity,
[1:33:51] not none of that. Try to do that today
[1:33:54] in the modern TV evangelist. Amen.
[1:33:57] My goodness gracious. Don't let me get
[1:33:59] started.
[1:34:01] So, so we find that. So, while that's
[1:34:04] happening under the church ages and
[1:34:06] under the seals, the trumpets are
[1:34:08] unfolding the history. It's God
[1:34:10] corraling Israel. If now you it you we
[1:34:13] don't have as clear a picture. We only
[1:34:15] get little spots where we can see it.
[1:34:17] two of the spots that we see pretty
[1:34:19] clear is is under the fifth and the
[1:34:24] sixth trumpet. And the vial always
[1:34:26] connects to the trumpet because they run
[1:34:28] parallel. And when we go back when we go
[1:34:31] back all the way and we see that there
[1:34:34] under the fifth when you've got those
[1:34:36] 200 million chargers
[1:34:39] who have been released from the river
[1:34:40] Euphrates.
[1:34:41] Amen.
[1:34:42] Amen.
[1:34:43] Amen.
[1:34:44] Amen. I don't want to I don't want to
[1:34:46] get get myself out of order because it's
[1:34:48] real easy to do. All right. So, so I I
[1:34:52] meant to say I meant to say the the
[1:34:54] sixth the sixth trumpet, sixth vial, the
[1:34:56] fifth one. Now, here's here's another
[1:34:58] one. Brother Brandham gives us a clue on
[1:35:00] the fifth one because under the fifth
[1:35:03] trumpet and the fifth angel sounded. I
[1:35:05] saw a star fall from heaven under the
[1:35:07] earth and to him was given the key of
[1:35:09] the bottomless pit. And he opened the
[1:35:12] bottomless pit. And there arose a smoke
[1:35:13] out of the pit as the smoke of a great
[1:35:15] furnace. And the sun and the air were
[1:35:17] darkened by reason of the smoke of the
[1:35:19] pit. And there came out of the smoke
[1:35:21] locust upon the earth. And unto them was
[1:35:23] given power as scorpions of the earth
[1:35:25] have power. It was commanded them they
[1:35:27] should not hurt the grass of the earth,
[1:35:28] neither any green thing. You see, demons
[1:35:31] aren't interested in the grass and green
[1:35:32] things. They want to torment people,
[1:35:35] neither any tree, but only those men
[1:35:37] which have not the seal of God in their
[1:35:38] foreheads. And and to them it was given
[1:35:41] that they should not kill them, but that
[1:35:42] they should be tormented five months.
[1:35:44] And their torment was as the torment of
[1:35:46] a scorpion when he striketh a man. And
[1:35:48] in those days men shall seek death. Now,
[1:35:51] all of that under the vial is going to
[1:35:54] be played out in full in the
[1:35:56] tribulation.
[1:35:57] But what we what we are privy to is that
[1:36:00] the star that fell from heaven ties back
[1:36:03] to Isaiah 12. How art thou fallen from
[1:36:06] heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning.
[1:36:09] So, Brother Brandham tied it back there.
[1:36:11] So now we know what's happened and and
[1:36:13] we know when this is because all of this
[1:36:15] is before the first woe and the first
[1:36:17] woe is coming in about another 10 years
[1:36:20] after Isuza. So the first world war
[1:36:23] hasn't even happened yet until around
[1:36:25] 1914 15 16 17 18. It starts it starts
[1:36:28] heating up in Europe. Then America gets
[1:36:30] involved and on and on and on it goes.
[1:36:32] But that hasn't happened yet. So this is
[1:36:34] prior to the World War I. So, this is
[1:36:39] right around the turn of the century.
[1:36:41] And what you find happening is is that
[1:36:44] Satan is cast down to the earth and he's
[1:36:47] given like a temporary power. It's how
[1:36:49] brother Lonnie used to explain it. Like
[1:36:50] a temporary power, he's unlocking the
[1:36:53] bottomless pit.
[1:36:55] This isn't even the 200 million million
[1:36:57] horses yet. That's still coming. That's
[1:36:59] even going to be worse. But he's given
[1:37:01] to open the bottomless pit. He's given a
[1:37:04] power. And when he opens the bottomless
[1:37:07] pit, demons come out. And brother
[1:37:08] Brandham would say later, Brother
[1:37:10] Brandham in his language would say, "The
[1:37:12] lid has been torn from hell and demon
[1:37:15] powers are streaming into the earth."
[1:37:17] Amen.
[1:37:18] So why? So now what you see, why do you
[1:37:21] think they could even have a World War
[1:37:23] I? Why do you think that women could
[1:37:26] begin to bob off their hair in 1912?
[1:37:29] That's called the bob. That's where it
[1:37:31] came from. and and and and
[1:37:34] chorus girls gave way to flappers and
[1:37:36] then flappers and brother Brandham says
[1:37:37] every generation got worse.
[1:37:40] And so so you see this is not
[1:37:42] accidental.
[1:37:43] The whole age began to be corrupted.
[1:37:46] Men's minds and churches begin to
[1:37:48] compromise. Demon powers are streaming
[1:37:50] into the earth. The bottomless pit has
[1:37:52] been opened.
[1:37:53] Amen.
[1:37:54] And demon powers are now causing evil
[1:37:56] throughout the world. And the world is
[1:37:58] starting to go off a cliff.
[1:38:01] and prophecy. So many prophecies are
[1:38:03] running in at the same time. In the last
[1:38:05] days, knowledge shall be increased. Men
[1:38:07] shall run to and fro and knowledge shall
[1:38:08] be increased. And I had another slide I
[1:38:10] didn't even show you where it just shows
[1:38:12] a meandering like a little meandering
[1:38:14] stream of invention and and progress and
[1:38:17] and all of a sudden it hits right about
[1:38:18] this time and it just goes zoom and it
[1:38:21] takes off in the industrial age and we
[1:38:23] go from agrarian. Those are not
[1:38:25] accidents. Amen.
[1:38:27] These things are being controlled by
[1:38:29] prophecy.
[1:38:31] You understand friends? It's being
[1:38:33] controlled by prophecy.
[1:38:35] And so, so what what's happening then?
[1:38:37] World War I is going to serve to start
[1:38:39] Israel on the on the return. They're
[1:38:41] trapped behind the Ottoman Empire.
[1:38:42] They're going to get out of there.
[1:38:43] They're going to level off in central
[1:38:45] Europe. World War II is going to come.
[1:38:47] It's just going to keep getting worse
[1:38:48] and worse and worse. So, why is God
[1:38:51] bringing these revivals? Why does he set
[1:38:54] an open door at the end of la of
[1:38:56] Philadelphia and start revivals prior to
[1:38:58] the 20th century? It moves into the 20th
[1:39:01] century. It keeps going. It's in Russia.
[1:39:03] It's in England. It's in California.
[1:39:06] Because when the enemy comes in like a
[1:39:08] flood, when the enemy gets a key and
[1:39:10] unlocks the bottomless pit and demon
[1:39:12] power starts streaming, God raises a
[1:39:15] standard
[1:39:17] to combat what what Satan is being
[1:39:20] allowed to do. He's being allowed to do
[1:39:23] it.
[1:39:23] Amen.
[1:39:24] Amen.
[1:39:26] See, he's being allowed to do that.
[1:39:28] That's right.
[1:39:30] So, and and and and I've got to break
[1:39:32] off. And so, so we're coming all the way
[1:39:34] out to the bride's revival in 1963 and
[1:39:37] all the way out to 2025. And I'm not
[1:39:38] dealing with the bride's revival today.
[1:39:40] We'll get to that in other coming
[1:39:42] lessons in this same series, no doubt.
[1:39:44] Lord, Lord willing.
[1:39:45] Amen. So, when we come to we come
[1:39:49] through all of the 20th century and I
[1:39:52] I've got to I've got to come to the I've
[1:39:54] got to I've got to get to the one more
[1:39:56] thing.
[1:39:58] And so, so we're we come all the way
[1:40:00] through the the Leodysian age and Isuza
[1:40:05] is born and it starts and brother
[1:40:06] Brandham comes in. He's one born out of
[1:40:08] season. They finally reject him. World
[1:40:11] War II comes because why? Because angels
[1:40:14] I'm sorry. Yeah, you have angels
[1:40:16] controlling the four winds in the book
[1:40:18] of Revelation and they're given a
[1:40:21] command. Wipe it out, destroy it.
[1:40:23] They've got the winds of judgment and
[1:40:25] war. But an angel ascends out of the
[1:40:28] east shows who it is. It's a it's it's
[1:40:31] absolutely Christ because he's got the
[1:40:33] seal of the living God. And only the
[1:40:35] Holy Ghost can give you the seal.
[1:40:37] And the one who can seal and the one who
[1:40:40] arises out of the east. And what is he
[1:40:42] doing? He says, "You've got to stop
[1:40:44] while we're already in the middle of of
[1:40:46] of the woes." Yeah, I know. But you got
[1:40:47] to you got to pause. Well, you
[1:40:50] understand that all of this history has
[1:40:52] been going and going. Yep. And we were
[1:40:54] given a commission to let's go ahead and
[1:40:56] get woe one, woe two, and woe three and
[1:40:59] and clean the earth off of fallen man so
[1:41:01] we can start a millennium. Yep. Yep. I
[1:41:03] know you're right. It's all my plan. I
[1:41:04] know you got a commission, but I've got
[1:41:06] an authority to tell you to pause.
[1:41:08] Amen.
[1:41:09] So, what do you want us to do? I want
[1:41:11] you to pause World War I. I just want
[1:41:14] you to pause the first woe. Well, what
[1:41:17] what what great event should we use to
[1:41:19] pause it? No. Don't Don't really do
[1:41:21] anything anybody can point to. Just stop
[1:41:23] it.
[1:41:24] Yeah.
[1:41:24] Amen.
[1:41:25] And World War I just stops. And nobody
[1:41:27] knows why.
[1:41:28] Yeah.
[1:41:29] And they asked the Kaiser, "Did you
[1:41:30] surrender?" No.
[1:41:32] They asked the the king of England,
[1:41:33] "Why'd you stop fighting when it was
[1:41:34] over?" Who said? Well, they said. Who's
[1:41:36] they? Well, uh, we don't know. Yeah.
[1:41:40] But anyway,
[1:41:41] everybody stop shooting.
[1:41:43] Amen.
[1:41:44] And it just it just ended.
[1:41:46] And that's a mystery to this day. They
[1:41:49] do not know who, what, how, when, or why
[1:41:52] it stopped. But it stopped exactly on
[1:41:55] the 11th month, 11th day, and the 11th
[1:41:57] hour
[1:41:59] of the day. Because because now you're
[1:42:01] coming into Revelation 11. Friends, you
[1:42:03] can't invent this stuff out of a
[1:42:05] hillbilly's mind. This stuff is the
[1:42:07] scriptures. This is a one with prophetic
[1:42:10] insight that has that has put all these
[1:42:12] pieces together and they fit.
[1:42:15] They fit perfectly.
[1:42:17] And so it it can't start again. And then
[1:42:19] and then finally and then when
[1:42:21] everything's in place, then World War II
[1:42:23] can begin. And under the second woe and
[1:42:25] the second woe say, well, the second wo
[1:42:27] is over. It's not.
[1:42:29] World War II's over in 45. Yeah, but
[1:42:31] that the world the World War was only
[1:42:34] part of the woe. It wasn't the woe. The
[1:42:36] woe doesn't end. The second woe doesn't
[1:42:38] end until the bride is gone and Moses
[1:42:40] and Elijah are on the scene in
[1:42:42] Revelation 11. And it says, "Now the end
[1:42:44] of the second woe, behold, the third woe
[1:42:46] cometh quickly." There's only 42 months
[1:42:48] in the whole thing and the whole world
[1:42:50] goes up in smoke.
[1:42:52] Amen.
[1:42:53] Hide me in the rock, Lord Jesus.
[1:42:57] So, you see, I I think I think I think
[1:43:00] I've accomplished if I've accomplished
[1:43:02] nothing else. I think I have convinced
[1:43:05] you. You should be convinced by ancient
[1:43:08] history, by New Testament history, by
[1:43:11] modern history that you can that that we
[1:43:13] can actually relate to that history is
[1:43:17] controlled by prophecy. It's not
[1:43:20] accidental. God is in control of it all.
[1:43:24] Now, now let me let me show you
[1:43:26] something else. All right.
[1:43:30] So, here is Yes, sir. So, here was the
[1:43:34] decision by the press
[1:43:38] before the thing.
[1:43:40] Yeah,
[1:43:42] I I screenshotted that when I read that
[1:43:46] the other morning, I think. And uh on
[1:43:48] the 7th, I think that's maybe the 7th. I
[1:43:51] don't uh actually it says Tuesday, April
[1:43:53] 22nd. My bad. But I but I just saw it
[1:43:56] and it says John Yep to Newsmax. Almost
[1:43:59] no chance of US pope.
[1:44:02] Almost no chance.
[1:44:05] They interviewed um
[1:44:09] US Bishop
[1:44:11] Robert Baron. He's newly appointed by
[1:44:13] Trump. He's the White House Commission
[1:44:15] on Religious Liberty. He's part of that
[1:44:18] part of that commission.
[1:44:19] Newly appointed by Trump. US Bishop
[1:44:21] Robert Baron. He was at the Vatican
[1:44:25] while the conclave was going on. And he
[1:44:27] was right before it started. He got
[1:44:28] there, you know, a week out and they're
[1:44:29] gathering and they're already starting
[1:44:31] their politics and he's moving among
[1:44:33] them because he's a bishop and he's
[1:44:34] moving in those circles and he comes
[1:44:37] back and he's testifying and CBS had
[1:44:40] this recently that this was before it
[1:44:42] all went down and he and he and he he
[1:44:45] came he came back quoting Cardinal
[1:44:48] George of Chicago. Now Cardinal George
[1:44:51] uh was very famous, very loved and 1937
[1:44:55] to 2015. He passed away in 2015. So this
[1:44:58] Robert Bishop um Bishop Robert Baron is
[1:45:02] testifying they're saying do you think
[1:45:04] there can be an American pope and he
[1:45:07] says you know I rem he says I and he's
[1:45:10] quoting his old friend my old friend
[1:45:12] Cardinal George said it like this until
[1:45:15] America goes into political decline
[1:45:18] there won't be an American pope
[1:45:21] so there was a there was a rhyme to the
[1:45:23] reason
[1:45:26] he said and Baron goes on to say
[1:45:30] if America is kind of running the world
[1:45:33] politically, culturally and
[1:45:35] economically, they don't want America
[1:45:37] running the world reli re religiously.
[1:45:41] I think there's some truth to that that
[1:45:43] we are such a superpower and so dominant
[1:45:47] that they don't want also to give us
[1:45:50] control over the church. Amen.
[1:45:53] So, is America going to decline
[1:45:57] politically? Not until it's destroyed.
[1:46:00] Is it going to decline as a world power?
[1:46:02] It's absolutely not. According to
[1:46:03] prophecy, until it's annihilated. See,
[1:46:05] and brother Brandham saw that in his
[1:46:07] seventh vision.
[1:46:08] And you let me let me tell you
[1:46:10] something, friend. He saw visions that
[1:46:12] came to pass. Exactly.
[1:46:14] And and I have heard the silly nonsense
[1:46:17] argument about Hitler and I'm like,
[1:46:21] okay, first of all, you're wrong. It
[1:46:23] just shows me you're not a very good
[1:46:24] historian. But but I get that the
[1:46:27] margins are close. I understand it's
[1:46:29] 1933. He's he's he's about to be the
[1:46:32] chancellor. It's already a given. So for
[1:46:34] William Brandham to say he'll become
[1:46:35] chancellor of Germany, you say, "Oh, see
[1:46:37] that's not a prophet." Well, that
[1:46:39] doesn't explain Mussolini
[1:46:41] uh dying um a disgraceful end. It
[1:46:45] doesn't just it doesn't explain Hitler
[1:46:46] dying a mysterious end.
[1:46:48] It doesn't explain how that Nazism and
[1:46:50] and fascism fell into communism
[1:46:53] and are swallowed up by Catholicism. And
[1:46:55] we see it.
[1:46:57] It doesn't explain the immorality of
[1:46:59] women.
[1:47:00] I mean, all you got to do is go back to
[1:47:02] the middle of the 20th century and women
[1:47:03] wore skirts.
[1:47:04] Yeah.
[1:47:05] And men wore long pants.
[1:47:07] Yeah.
[1:47:08] Only boys wore shorts. You know, do you
[1:47:10] know? Do you know? This is why Brother
[1:47:12] Brandham didn't call it a sin for a man
[1:47:14] to wear a pair of shorts. He said,
[1:47:16] "You're a sissy."
[1:47:17] Yeah.
[1:47:19] It's not a not not a matter of
[1:47:20] sinfulness because a man's body is not
[1:47:22] sacred like a woman. But he said,
[1:47:24] "You're a sissy." And I thought, "Where
[1:47:26] where's that coming from?" And I went
[1:47:27] back and studied it and turns out that
[1:47:30] back in the day, boys were not allowed
[1:47:33] to wear long pants. You look at old
[1:47:34] pictures, they're in these little
[1:47:36] breaches, nose, knee things. And the the
[1:47:38] graduation where they get to be so proud
[1:47:41] they get to go in public for the first
[1:47:42] time in britches. I'm a man.
[1:47:45] Amen.
[1:47:46] And and that's what separated men from
[1:47:48] boys was boys wore little kneelength
[1:47:51] shorts. Now that's completely different.
[1:47:53] The thing that some men went wear today
[1:47:56] is not even that. They're wearing their
[1:47:57] wife's underneath garment.
[1:48:00] And I investigated that as well. And
[1:48:02] sure enough, shorts like that were part
[1:48:05] of a woman's underneath attire. She wore
[1:48:07] it under her skirt.
[1:48:09] And now, not only do women go out in
[1:48:11] their underwear, men wear their
[1:48:12] underwear and go out in this.
[1:48:14] Amen.
[1:48:15] Oh, get me out of this, Lord.
[1:48:19] Well, it's a truth. Anyhow,
[1:48:21] and actually, it's the Boy Scouts of
[1:48:23] America who actually because they put
[1:48:26] their their Brad, what do they call the
[1:48:29] clan leader? The the the pack leader,
[1:48:30] what is his name? scout master. Those
[1:48:33] guys started wearing shorts and and that
[1:48:35] was way back when it first started. And
[1:48:38] then suddenly men started going, "Well,
[1:48:39] that's kind of looks pretty nice and
[1:48:41] fashionable." And it became a thing.
[1:48:43] Yeah.
[1:48:44] So So William Brandon wasn't wrong. I
[1:48:47] just want that clear.
[1:48:49] He wasn't wrong when he said, "You're a
[1:48:51] if you wear shorts." Only little
[1:48:53] boys did that.
[1:48:55] You're just a child. You're not even a
[1:48:57] man. A man puts on bridges. Yeah.
[1:49:00] And if you're wearing shorts like worse
[1:49:02] than worse than knee length, then you're
[1:49:04] you're wearing a woman's underneath
[1:49:06] underwear.
[1:49:08] And and and that's why and then and then
[1:49:11] it flips over and a woman who puts on a
[1:49:13] pair of pants is worse than a woman who
[1:49:15] goes out in shorts even though in shorts
[1:49:17] she's indecent.
[1:49:18] Amen.
[1:49:20] Because a woman said to Brother Brandon,
[1:49:21] "Brother Brandon, I don't wear shorts. I
[1:49:22] wear slacks." He said, "That's worse.
[1:49:25] In shorts, you're just indecent." As if
[1:49:27] that's not bad enough. But but to wear a
[1:49:30] garment pertains to a man is an
[1:49:31] abomination to God. Not only is it
[1:49:34] wrong, but it's nasty and stinky and
[1:49:36] filthy to God.
[1:49:38] Amen.
[1:49:38] That's the truth.
[1:49:41] Let me tell you something. You know what
[1:49:42] I'm doing right now? I'm making modern
[1:49:44] events clear in prophecy.
[1:49:47] This is a consequence of Satan unlocking
[1:49:51] the bottomless pit. And demon powers are
[1:49:53] streaming into the earth. and you get
[1:49:55] under the influence of those demon
[1:49:56] powers cuz the lid's torn from hell.
[1:49:58] Resist it, brothers. Resist it, sisters.
[1:50:01] Let's be decent, godly people. We're
[1:50:04] close to the end time.
[1:50:06] Hallelujah.
[1:50:07] Amen.
[1:50:08] That was free. That's not on my notes.
[1:50:10] It's not on my PowerPoint.
[1:50:14] But I'm making modern events clear by
[1:50:16] prophecy. I might as well.
[1:50:19] So, we're not going to decline
[1:50:22] politically. So the thought is there's
[1:50:24] no possibility or there's no chance of
[1:50:26] an American pope. They've had I think 27
[1:50:29] different popes since the Declaration of
[1:50:31] Independence. 20 or 27. I don't
[1:50:33] remember. I've looked at so many
[1:50:34] numbers. But and and there's it's always
[1:50:36] no way. Well, it was an Italian until
[1:50:38] John Paul who was Polish. And then you
[1:50:41] had um the German guy. I forget what his
[1:50:44] name was. And then you had Francis who
[1:50:46] was South American. And this guy, the
[1:50:48] the current pope is Chicago. Now watch
[1:50:51] what brother Brandham says here. All
[1:50:53] right. Because what you saw on the eth
[1:50:55] was modern event made clear in prophecy.
[1:50:57] Everybody good?
[1:50:58] You still can you give me a little more
[1:51:00] time?
[1:51:00] Come on. This is Brother Jason. I don't
[1:51:02] I don't wear you out, do I? Come on.
[1:51:04] I usually we're standing up by now, but
[1:51:06] give me about 15 more minutes. All
[1:51:08] right. Don't Don't be a spoiled
[1:51:09] American. Poor thing.
[1:51:11] So
[1:51:14] So I can I can hear those saints in uh
[1:51:17] uh in Nigeria screaming, "Amen.
[1:51:21] Praise God.
[1:51:23] So, Brother Brandham says this. Now,
[1:51:25] watch. Let me show you some more events
[1:51:26] made clear in prophecy. 1954.
[1:51:31] This is 71 years. This has been on the
[1:51:33] record. This has been on the books for
[1:51:36] 71 years.
[1:51:37] Amen.
[1:51:39] Acts of the Holy Spirit. I believe one
[1:51:41] of these glorious days when this United
[1:51:43] isn't it amazing. He calls it glorious.
[1:51:45] Yeah.
[1:51:46] But for a different reason. Like Sister
[1:51:48] Jean said, they were shouting and jump
[1:51:50] jumping. We're shouting and jumping, but
[1:51:52] for a different reason.
[1:51:54] One of these glorious days when this
[1:51:56] United Confederation of Churches goes
[1:51:58] together and the new pope is brought out
[1:52:02] of the United States and put over there
[1:52:05] according to prophecy. Then they'll form
[1:52:08] an image like unto the beast. And I tell
[1:52:10] you, the true church of God will be
[1:52:12] drove together.
[1:52:14] Amen. the real true believers out of the
[1:52:17] ones who have came out of Methodist,
[1:52:19] came out of Baptist, come out of her my
[1:52:21] people,
[1:52:22] Presbyterian, Pentecostals, Nazarene,
[1:52:24] Pilgrim, Holiness, the the ones who stay
[1:52:27] in that will take the mark of the beast.
[1:52:29] Full stop.
[1:52:31] If you're caught in a denomination when
[1:52:33] the bride leaves the earth, full stop.
[1:52:36] You take the mark of the beast.
[1:52:38] And many people are going to find out.
[1:52:40] They said, "Oh, Brother Brandham, I'll
[1:52:41] get out then." He said, "No, you won't.
[1:52:43] You'll only find out you've already been
[1:52:44] marked.
[1:52:45] Yeah. Amen.
[1:52:46] See, so you're never going to hear come
[1:52:48] up if you don't hear come out. The real
[1:52:51] true believers of Methodist, Baptist,
[1:52:54] Presbyterian, Pentecost, and Nazarian,
[1:52:56] pilgrim, holiness, whatever they be,
[1:52:58] will go together and cemented by the
[1:53:01] love of God. That'll make the body of
[1:53:04] the Lord Jesus Christ. All the believers
[1:53:06] and agnostics and shallow-minded will be
[1:53:09] cast to one side. They'll go right on
[1:53:11] into the Confederation of Churches.
[1:53:15] 71 years ago.
[1:53:16] Yeah.
[1:53:18] He comes
[1:53:21] to 1958. So now we're 67 years ago. What
[1:53:25] about the Catholic? They want to unite
[1:53:27] the whole world under one. Catholicism.
[1:53:29] What about the Protestant? He wants to
[1:53:31] unite them all under one under the
[1:53:33] Federation of Churches. Just as wrong
[1:53:35] and black as the Catholics are, it's the
[1:53:38] same old lying devil. It's true. That's
[1:53:42] a fatal mistake.
[1:53:44] Amen.
[1:53:44] Catch it, friends. That's a fatal
[1:53:47] mistake. What do they want? They want
[1:53:51] them all to be a federation of churches.
[1:53:54] We're all under one head. As long as I
[1:53:57] can be the ruler. Catholics want them
[1:54:00] under one head. Pope can be the ruler.
[1:54:04] Russia wants them all under one head so
[1:54:06] communism can be the ruler. UN wants
[1:54:08] them all under one head so we the United
[1:54:11] States can kind of be the boss because
[1:54:13] we're the biggest nation. It's all
[1:54:17] the same devil.
[1:54:19] Amen.
[1:54:20] The lid's been torn from hell, friends.
[1:54:22] It's all the same devil.
[1:54:25] And every nation in the world is
[1:54:28] controlled by the devil. So the Bible
[1:54:31] says here we have no continuing city but
[1:54:35] we seek one to come. How many seekers do
[1:54:38] I have here today? I seek one to come.
[1:54:42] Amen.
[1:54:44] Now he comes to 1960. So where are we?
[1:54:46] 65 years out now.
[1:54:50] Conference. Listen. Thus sayaith the
[1:54:53] Lord. Repent. This is in Chicago.
[1:54:58] The pope is from Chicago. Yes,
[1:55:00] this is in Chicago 1960. Listen, thus
[1:55:03] sayaith the Lord, repent. I predict
[1:55:05] three curtains in the name of the Lord.
[1:55:07] There will be one called the Iron
[1:55:09] Curtain, which will be Russia. Watch red
[1:55:11] China. There'll be a bamboo curtain.
[1:55:12] That'll be the bamboo curtain. They're
[1:55:14] horrible. But watch that purple curtain
[1:55:17] that's rising in the United States and
[1:55:19] over the world. The Roman Empire. The
[1:55:22] crulest of them all. Remember in the
[1:55:26] name of the Lord, get away from it. Come
[1:55:30] away from it. Anything that's attached
[1:55:32] to it, flee to the rock, for the coming
[1:55:35] of the Lord is at hand. We need a
[1:55:38] conference. I need a conference to talk
[1:55:40] these things over with God. The church
[1:55:44] is at the end of her road. All right, I
[1:55:47] said that was conferences with Chicago.
[1:55:48] This next one is 61. Micah the prophet
[1:55:50] in Chicago.
[1:55:53] Let me tell you now, here we are a
[1:55:56] little closer. Let me tell you, thus
[1:55:58] saith the Lord, you better repent.
[1:56:01] Chicago, your hour is close at hand.
[1:56:03] Repent. Come, believe, cuz there will
[1:56:06] come a time that you'll cry for this and
[1:56:08] it won't be there. You won't receive a
[1:56:11] real, so there will be a false one give
[1:56:12] you. Jesus said, "I come in my own name.
[1:56:15] You receive me not. Another one will
[1:56:17] come and you'll receive him." Remember,
[1:56:19] I quote his words. It's on tape on
[1:56:21] record.
[1:56:24] He comes in the fourth seal. Now we find
[1:56:27] out here that this Satan after being
[1:56:31] kicked out of heaven incarnates himself
[1:56:33] in the beast and now he is a beast and a
[1:56:36] Christ false prophet and now beast and
[1:56:40] given the name of death and hell follows
[1:56:42] him fully Satan on his throne. Oh my.
[1:56:46] See, they didn't know. They knew that
[1:56:49] the pale horse rider that death followed
[1:56:51] him, but they knew his name meant death,
[1:56:54] but no one knew what to correlate that.
[1:56:57] Is it a death by a disease? Is it, you
[1:57:00] know, are these horsemen going to bring
[1:57:02] plagues or is it going to be a nuclear
[1:57:03] holocaust? What's it going to be? And it
[1:57:05] took a prophet to identify it and said,
[1:57:07] "It's denominationalism."
[1:57:09] And it's the Federation Confederation of
[1:57:11] Churches building an image to the beast.
[1:57:13] See, and you got a false prophet. Watch.
[1:57:16] And now beast and give the name of death
[1:57:18] and hell follows him fully. Satan on his
[1:57:21] throne. Oh my. On the earth. He is Satan
[1:57:25] representative on the earth. That he now
[1:57:28] is the head of the kingdoms of the
[1:57:30] world. The very same kingdoms that he
[1:57:32] offered to the Lord Jesus Christ. So, so
[1:57:36] now he's got a representative.
[1:57:38] Brother Brandham in the fourth seal is
[1:57:40] teaching on the on the false prophet. He
[1:57:42] said he says the kingdoms that he
[1:57:44] offered to the Lord Jesus in Matthew 4,
[1:57:45] Satan now becomes a full king. Now this
[1:57:48] happens later on he is false prophet now
[1:57:51] he will become beast. So he's talking
[1:57:53] about that Satan has his representative
[1:57:56] in the false prophet and you realize
[1:58:00] that and I don't have it here on on my
[1:58:03] slide but let me just refer to it. So,
[1:58:07] brother Brandham talks about how does
[1:58:11] the false prophet persuade
[1:58:15] billions of people.
[1:58:17] Yeah.
[1:58:17] Amen.
[1:58:18] To go into the tribulation under a
[1:58:21] mirage of a confederation of churches
[1:58:23] and image to the beast. And brother
[1:58:25] Brandham says he prophesies them right
[1:58:28] into it.
[1:58:29] Amen.
[1:58:31] So by feeding on his false word, they
[1:58:34] take a false doctrine. They believe a
[1:58:36] lie and they follow him right in
[1:58:39] thinking it's peace and safety thinking
[1:58:42] it's the answer and it's it's a death
[1:58:44] sentence. It's a trap. If a false
[1:58:47] prophet pope by his preaching, that's
[1:58:50] what makes him false cuz he's preaching
[1:58:52] false doctrine. And if he can absolutely
[1:58:55] cause people to go into a tribulation,
[1:58:59] cannot God send us a messenger and by
[1:59:01] the preaching of that word, cause a
[1:59:03] bride to gather around the carcass of
[1:59:05] the word of God and not go in a rapture,
[1:59:08] not go in a tribulation, but go up in a
[1:59:09] rapture, I say yay and amen. If a false
[1:59:13] prophet can preach them into it, a true
[1:59:15] prophet can get me out of it.
[1:59:17] Hallelujah. And that's where that's what
[1:59:19] I'm preaching about today. You're
[1:59:21] living. You are a modern event made
[1:59:24] clear
[1:59:24] in prophecy.
[1:59:28] And they said it couldn't happen.
[1:59:31] There's no way. Not as long as America's
[1:59:34] a political entity. It didn't matter
[1:59:36] that William Brandham is on the record.
[1:59:38] 71 years out, 67 years out, 65 years
[1:59:42] out, 64 years out. He's on record again
[1:59:44] and again and again warning them. Oh, it
[1:59:47] can't happen. William Brandham, you must
[1:59:49] have missed it.
[1:59:52] And he missed it only until this
[1:59:54] happened.
[1:59:57] Amen.
[1:59:58] And even our president said, "We're very
[2:00:01] happy." We're very surprised, but we're
[2:00:03] very happy.
[2:00:06] The whole world was surprised.
[2:00:08] And the whole world is jumping and
[2:00:10] rejoicing. And a bride is jumping and
[2:00:12] rejoicing.
[2:00:13] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[2:00:15] We have this has been on the rec on the
[2:00:18] books for 71 years. Today is a different
[2:00:21] day than when you sat here and heard me
[2:00:23] preach a week ago.
[2:00:25] It's different than what you heard
[2:00:26] Wednesday night. We have crossed another
[2:00:29] line. This is a milestone. This is a
[2:00:31] marker that we have been looking for.
[2:00:33] And brother Brandham said, when you see
[2:00:34] that, that's when that brings the true
[2:00:37] believers together. And it takes the how
[2:00:39] do he how do he say that? the the the
[2:00:41] agnostic, the the critic, and all of
[2:00:43] these uh shallow people, and it just
[2:00:45] brushes them aside. And I just say,
[2:00:48] Lord, uh save everybody you can, but I
[2:00:50] want to be in that number.
[2:00:53] I want to be in that number.
[2:00:55] Hallelujah. And you know, it it's it's
[2:00:58] interesting. Uh
[2:01:03] wow, I didn't know that. Yeah. So, wow.
[2:01:06] Okay, let me read let me read that.
[2:01:08] Brother Matt just sent that to me. Uh so
[2:01:10] the prophecy is December 19, 1954. Pope
[2:01:14] Leo born September the 14th, 1955.
[2:01:18] Pope Leo was born nine months almost to
[2:01:20] the day after brother Brandon prophesies
[2:01:22] a pope coming from the USA.
[2:01:24] Amen.
[2:01:25] And his name is Leo.
[2:01:27] Yeah.
[2:01:27] And he takes the name Leo. Let me let me
[2:01:29] see if I I don't know if I put any Yeah.
[2:01:32] There were Here's my last slide.
[2:01:35] Most you've na most used names of the
[2:01:37] pope 23 times. John counting the twice
[2:01:40] that it was uh put together with John
[2:01:43] Paul. Benedict was 16 times, Gregory 16
[2:01:46] times, Clemets 14, Innocent was 13, Pas
[2:01:51] 12, on down and on down. Leo was 14
[2:01:53] times with it had been 13 and now it's
[2:01:56] 14. It's interesting because I started
[2:01:59] to put the quotes in here today, but I
[2:02:00] just I said I can't. It's going to be
[2:02:02] too much. But brother Brandham said he
[2:02:05] and I've got the quotes if if we we'll
[2:02:07] read them next time where he said he
[2:02:09] came Christ came under the virgin and
[2:02:12] we've been going through the ages of
[2:02:14] cross fishes and he said he comes back
[2:02:16] under Leo the lion and it's king the
[2:02:18] king Leo the lion the king of Judah for
[2:02:21] millennial reign and here you've got a
[2:02:23] pope and guess what else guess what else
[2:02:26] I I thought to myself
[2:02:28] what have past Leos have past Leos been
[2:02:31] involved in prophecy.
[2:02:35] It was It was a of all the It wasn't one
[2:02:38] of the 23 John's. It wasn't one of the
[2:02:41] 16 Benedicts. It wasn't one of the 16
[2:02:44] Gregories or the 14 Clements or the 13
[2:02:46] Innocents. When Martin Luther nailed his
[2:02:49] 95 thesis to the door there of the of of
[2:02:53] the church, you know who was on who was
[2:02:55] a pope? The 10th.
[2:02:58] The 10th. Leo the 10th. Right. When
[2:03:01] Martin Luther, you've got a Leo on the
[2:03:03] And guess what? Guess who the Guess who
[2:03:06] the 12th and 13th Leos were? The 12th,
[2:03:10] he was what's amazing is he was the pope
[2:03:14] under the ministry of the sixth church
[2:03:17] age messenger of Philadelphia, John
[2:03:18] Wesley. And this pope, the 12th one, was
[2:03:22] known for his piety. He believed in
[2:03:25] moral clean living because why? Even
[2:03:28] though he's a pope, there's a messenger
[2:03:30] that bringing sanctification to the
[2:03:32] world. And even the pope is under the
[2:03:34] influence of that. And then the 13th
[2:03:37] one, the 13th one is the pope on the
[2:03:40] throne right right at the time when the
[2:03:43] the revivals are striking Armenia and
[2:03:45] striking Wales and striking and coming
[2:03:48] across to 1904 and 1905. He's he's a
[2:03:51] pope until 1903, right when the the
[2:03:54] Armenian revival is over. And then it
[2:03:57] jumps to Wales. And then it jumps to
[2:04:00] Isuza. And then it comes along. And now
[2:04:03] we've got a prophet. And the seals are
[2:04:04] open. And he's gone. And we're here. And
[2:04:07] 71 years later. And Leo's back on the
[2:04:09] throne.
[2:04:10] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[2:04:12] You are living in prophecy. You are
[2:04:15] living. You're walking in the words of
[2:04:17] scripture. Everything is planned.
[2:04:20] Everything is fine. Everything is in
[2:04:23] order. We are rejoicing today because we
[2:04:27] know I know that the one who started all
[2:04:29] of this, will finish it, is finishing
[2:04:32] it, started it, managed it, finishing
[2:04:35] it, and my future is bright and your
[2:04:38] future is bright. Oh, let's stand to our
[2:04:41] feet, friends, and rejoice in the in the
[2:04:43] word of the Lord. This is what God has
[2:04:45] done in our day.
[2:04:49] Oh, my about 15 minutes over. You all
[2:04:51] right?
[2:04:52] Amen. And amen. Brother Andrew, I want
[2:04:54] to sing. This is the day the Lord has
[2:04:57] made.
[2:04:59] I will be glad and rejoice in it.
[2:05:03] Is this the day?
[2:05:04] Are you glad and rejoicing, friends?
[2:05:10] Believe it or not,
[2:05:15] looked right at you at 111, Sunny.
[2:05:20] Believe it or not, all I did today was
[2:05:23] scratch the surface.
[2:05:25] I give you my word. All I All I had time
[2:05:28] for was to just scratch the surface.
[2:05:30] Just hit some highlights. My I spent
[2:05:32] three years covering the book of
[2:05:34] Revelation verse by
[2:05:38] verse. It's work of a thousand days,
[2:05:40] actually a little more. And me and a
[2:05:43] team of other brothers went through it
[2:05:44] every day on the air for 365 days a
[2:05:46] year. We were on the air every day and
[2:05:49] we covered it all. And I promise you
[2:05:51] today, you've sat here and heard
[2:05:52] probably a 90-minute sermon and all I've
[2:05:55] done is just hit the surface. Amen.
[2:05:58] Just hit the tops of things. I if if if
[2:06:01] we if I wanted to and I don't feel
[2:06:03] particularly led to, but if I wanted to
[2:06:06] really go down into the nitty-gritty,
[2:06:07] friends, you would literally see that
[2:06:10] not just the high things are controlled
[2:06:12] by God. Even down in the intricacies,
[2:06:15] every aspect of your life, God wants to
[2:06:19] put his hand on. Amen.
[2:06:21] Every aspect, everything that involves
[2:06:24] you, everything you think and do and
[2:06:26] say, every every feeling of good and
[2:06:30] every feeling of righteousness that you
[2:06:32] long for, I'm here to tell you, God
[2:06:34] wants that more for you than you could
[2:06:36] want it for yourself. He's in control.
[2:06:39] Amen. Let's bow our heads before we
[2:06:41] sing, before we change and clap our
[2:06:43] hands. Father,
[2:06:46] Lord, I come to the end of the sermon
[2:06:48] today and I I I I did my level best,
[2:06:51] Lord. There was a lot to cover and a lot
[2:06:53] to say and a lot to think about. And I
[2:06:56] pray, master, that I've given the people
[2:06:59] enough to chew on. They'll go away and
[2:07:00] think about these things and realize,
[2:07:02] Lord, if they could just realize that
[2:07:05] the greatest event, the greatest
[2:07:08] fulfillment of prophecy in the modern
[2:07:11] day is the people themselves. the
[2:07:14] believers who are believing against all
[2:07:18] odds in spite of a a darkness that
[2:07:21] covers the whole earth and a gross
[2:07:23] darkness on the minds of all humanity
[2:07:26] and the whole world spinning Lord into
[2:07:29] chaos and headed hurling
[2:07:32] hurling towards a tribulation
[2:07:34] unstoppable un unchangeable
[2:07:37] it can't be stopped it can't be delayed
[2:07:40] it's moving forward at a pace father
[2:07:42] according to prophecy Now, I pray,
[2:07:45] Master, that today you will let it grip
[2:07:48] our hearts in a way that maybe it hasn't
[2:07:50] before, young and old alike, boy and
[2:07:53] girl, male and female, married, single,
[2:07:55] everyone, that we'll have a greater
[2:07:58] appreciation today. And when we see our
[2:08:00] our life and no matter what it holds,
[2:08:02] we'll realize God's got this. God's got
[2:08:06] this. God's got me. God's in control. My
[2:08:09] life is in his hands. Lord, I'm thinking
[2:08:13] on my heart right now of a a poor young
[2:08:16] lady in a bad situation. The devil
[2:08:19] trying, Lord, to give her every kind of
[2:08:21] affliction. And Lord, we know her
[2:08:23] through her family. She's a daughter of
[2:08:26] Sister Angela uh Heth and Lord Caitlyn
[2:08:29] and she's suffering and the enem is
[2:08:31] attacking her and she's got a rough road
[2:08:33] to to to go already, Lord. And so I'm
[2:08:36] praying and asking mercy for her. I
[2:08:37] wrote it down and wanted to mention it,
[2:08:40] Lord. And I'm I'm asking prayer for
[2:08:42] Caitlyn right now that Lord God, you
[2:08:44] would help her from on high. Be
[2:08:46] everything that she needs from you,
[2:08:48] Lord, in this in this time of trial in
[2:08:50] her life. Master, I commit her into your
[2:08:52] hands. And I commit these people into
[2:08:54] your hands. and all who heard this word
[2:08:56] today. Lord, may there be a uh something
[2:09:00] that happened in our heart that we
[2:09:02] realize that a new shift has happened, a
[2:09:05] new milestone has now been passed. And
[2:09:08] we're moving now, Father, toward a a a
[2:09:11] certain a certain conclusion. It is just
[2:09:13] as certain. It's not uncertain. It's
[2:09:15] very certain. And it's made more
[2:09:17] certain, Lord, today. These events are
[2:09:20] made certain to us by prophecy. I commit
[2:09:23] it to you in Jesus name. Amen. Let's
