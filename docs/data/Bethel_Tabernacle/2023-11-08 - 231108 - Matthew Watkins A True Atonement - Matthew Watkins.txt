the house of the Lord I wasn't to use this but I forgot to put on my lapel that's all right God bless you you love the Lord Jesus tonight amen happy to be in his house amen Ephesians chapter 4 if you have your Bible we go straight to the word amen Ephesians chapter 4 Brothers I did send you some slides if you just have that up and ready that would be awesome Ephesians chapter 4 we're just going to read a um scripture from here and then another portion in Zechariah amen praise the Lord Zechariah Chapter 12 amen praise the Lord trust that you came with a hunger amen upon your heart just to receive from the Lord and hear from the Lord Lord just um really weighing my heart burdening me heavy for this thought I'm to preach here and so I just um been looking forward to being able to come here tonight and just waiting to see what the Lord will do don't really have a really put together thought just more things uh put together notes but just things really upon my heart and so I just want to be able to express them I pray that just trust that you'll pull on the word of the Lord amen and believe that the Lord can speak to you amen that's a that's a that's important because the Bible says you've got to mix the word with faith and so the Bible says he that cometh to God must first believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that dig diligently seek Him amen so you first got to have faith to say Lord I believe you could speak to me amen how many will raise a hand and say Lord I believe you can speak to me amen tonight and I want to hear your voice amen wanted to hear the voice of the Lord amen Zechariah 12 first we'll look at Ephesians chapter 4 and let's just begin reading here at verse 11 and he gave some Apostles and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so how long will these gifts be in operation until then that we henceforth notice this be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in weight to deceive but speaking the truth and love that's important May grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from who the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body under the edifying of itself in love you notice that in both places in Ephesians speaking the truth in love and then he goes on in verse 16 and says where every joint's going to supply the entire body everything's going to work the Bible says the effectual working in the measure of every part not just the preacher not just the Deacon not just the pastor but every part so you see in the body there's a there's a role for everybody to play and the Bible says Mak an increase of the body unto the edifying notice that of its s in love verse 17 this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darken being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past filling what an amazing place to get to to where your past filling did you know you can get to that place we all can get to that place to where we're past filling these are Gentiles this is who he's speaking of don't walk as other Gentiles walk right who being past filling have given themselves over into lasciviousness to work all in cleanness with greediness verse 20 but you love this verse have not so learned Christ amen but you have not so learn Christ if so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that you put off concerning the former conversation the old be that you put off let me read that again verse 22 that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness wherefore putting away lion speak every man truth with his his neighbor for we are members one of another be you angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth amen but that which is good to the use of edify that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be you kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you Lord Jesus Lord I just bow my head God just now and surrender Lord I completely surrender my vessel my thoughts Lord the things that you've burdened upon me Lord even today Lord as you begin to deal with My Heart Lord in such a special way Lord I just asked you then Lord and I ask you again now Lord help me Father tonight Lord as I stand Here Lord as an unworthy tool Lord I I've can say here honestly Lord I'm the least amongst anybody to stand here and to be able to speak Lord I pray God that you would help me right now Lord I pray that you would help me communicate father what you've placed upon my heart in a way that would be effective Lord that would bring change Lord that's our true desire Lord Jesus that you would bring change from the inside and the innermost part of our being be with us now Lord God As We Just Surrender and yield to you as we feel Lord your and be sensitive to your spirit I pray God you'd help every single person that's here me the speaker them the hearer we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can be seated tonight I'm struggling on where to begin I just have so many things the Lord has just uh burdened me with and I don't know uh really even as I stand here right now I don't have a real continuity or clear Direction uh but I just believe I I rest because I know that that's how the Lord intended this to be here tonight and so I you just pray for me as I just begin to just labor here and just pour my heart out as I just minister to you I'm speaking here tonight and I've titled this a true atonement I want you to look at Zechariah Chapter 12 if you could quickly um Zechariah Chapter 12 very familiar scripture and we didn't read itans let's look here just for a moment in in Zechariah 12 and let's just read a few verses here uh from verse one the burden of the word of the Lord for Israel saeth the Lord which stretches stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth and forth the spirit of man within him behold I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in The Siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem and in that day notice this you're going to see these words a lot in this in the chapter 12 and chapter 14 and in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it in that day there it is again saith the Lord I will Smite every horse with astonishment and his rider with Madness I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah and will Smite every horse of the people with blindness verse six and in that day I will make the governors of Judah like a hearth of fire among the wood uh verse eight in that day he says it again verse 11 and in that day and so you see that the Lord here in in in Zachariah and I'm just going to speak here just for a moment what an incredible time that we're living in I mean unbelievably uh unprecedented like nothing we've ever seen before really what we see happening in our world today in the land of Israel and then beyond Israel not even just the nation of Israel what they're facing and what they're processing uh their in their own nation is very uh it's incredible because it's such a contrast to what we here in the west see in our civilized modern world where it looks like the entire world has turned their back back against Israel what an anointing listen friends this isn't just something that's just happened overnight this is prophetic what you're I believe truly what we're seeing I don't know that's the culmination of the of World War III and and the and the beginning of the you know the tribulation period and a Rapture hey I'm all for it sign me up if this is what this is about then praise God I I'm right here right in line for it I don't know if that's what this is but we know that this is prophesied we we read about this in Zechariah chapter 12 13 and 14 and it covers such a broad scope uh of of of the of the of of the just in those three chapters it covers just a broad scope of Prophecy and we know that there's actual events these aren't uh generic things that you read about here what I love about the Bible is that the Bible is very specific these are things that are actually going to take place on a very real way and it prophesies actual event uh in the world it talks about uh how that there will be an entire Confederacy uh an entire world Army a world nation that something will come to unite the world against this little bitty tiny nation of Israel right and the scripture says that they would come under they would come under the anointing of this that it would be a unification you know and I don't have time and I'm not really going to teach on this here tonight but I'm just going to go as the Lord leads me it's incredible because I was just reading today in in brother bam in the Feast of the trumpets and it begins to talk about how that uh how that that that all of these these uh spirits that were Unleashed at the river Euphrates these um uh you know these demon Spirits these Chargers he said were released against Israel and and he talks about how that they were released under the six seal and we all know this very well that that that six seal is a tribulation seal and you you say well we're not in the tribulation period well that's right we're not in the tribulation period you see we got to understand and if you study the message you realize that brother Brandon preached and taught that there was an actual happening or a real taking place of that six seal that tribulation period but yet even before that six seal there was a pre-tribulation anointing that was released from that seal into the atmosphere a pastor spent uh many sermon series upon that preaching on the vials and the plagues and so we know brother bandam talks about the the you know the first six seal the first six seals are covered in Revelations chapter six and in Revelation six you have all six seals you just have the don't have the seventh seal uh you know but here uh how many knows what the the seventh seal is it's the coming of the Lord but we know the coming of the Lord is an actual event that takes place the the Rapture the the the Advent of Christ the actual uh second coming but we know that that coming had uh multiple phases to it and there was a revelation given of the seventh seal listen friends I truly believe the seventh seal is open here tonight now though the coming of the Lord hasn't physically happened yet we know that the coming of the Lord started with a shout that would gather a bride around a message and it would come in a shout a voice and a trumpet can you say Amen tonight and we know that brother bham says that what what the trumpets are to Israel the seals are to the Gentiles and so the prophet of God would begin to teach us and show us how that under Revelation 6 there was uh six seals but the seventh seal was left off and in fact you turn your Bible over to Revelations chapter 7 and there's no seventh seal you don't find the seventh seal until Revelations chapter 8 because the prophet said that there was he called it uh uh a a an interval of time and he said Revelation 7 was between the sixth and the chapter 6 and chapter 8 in other words between the Sixth Seal and the seventh seal there would be an interval of time Revelation 7 which the prophet of God said was to Israel it was the calling of the 144,000 right and so we know that that that even though this hasn't taken place yet in time chronologically yet yet the seal was open and the anointing of that pre-tribulation six seal literally Came Upon the heart of Stalin ikan Hitler and brother bam said what was those plagues that came to that trumpet that sounded all the all the seven trumpets sound under the Sixth Seal you say brother mat well this isn't making sense brother bam said the sick seal is the Tribulation seal we're not in the tribulation oh God I hope we're not in the tribulation period yet but yet we know that even though the six seal happening of the tribulation period hasn't taken place yet because Mercy still here there's a gentile dispensation still going there's still the calling out of the Bride that's still happen happening right now brother bandam said what is this this is the Feast of Pentecost right and the prophet of God said when did the Feast of Pentecost start it started on the on the on the on the uh uh in the book of Acts when when God poured out the Holy Ghost upon the church what was that that was the Feast of Pentecost and brother bham says that that Feast last all the way through all seven Church ages so all the way there's a feast of Pentecost from Ephesus all the way to the AG that you're living in you say when does it end brother bam said it ends with the calling out of the Bride now that's not the calling of you or your soul that means when God takes the Gentile body off of the Earth the Pentecostal Feast is over and then the prophet says then what's next is the Feast of atonement brother Bron picks it up and he says notice the Feast of atonement is not a it's not a feast of to slay the lamb again can you say Amen it's not a feast to slay the lamb he says but it's to grieve over the the lamb that was slain he says because under that Feast of atonement those Jews will look upon him who they've pierced and they'll mourn you can't imagine that now the arrogancy that the Jews have now and the way that they talk about Jesus and the way they talk about Christ my goodness friends listen that's just the blindness that God put in their hearts but one day he's going to send two prophets and those prophets are going to preach the same message that you have preached to you tonight listen friends Moses and Elijah in Revelations 11 they won't preach a different message they won't preach something new they'll actually be preaching the message of the hour and the Bible says that that they'll receive the sealing of the Holy Ghost oh my brother and my sister if the message that J that Moses and Elijah will preach will seal the 144,000 what do you think it'll do to a gentile believer who preaches the message of the hour the true atonement it'll seal you to the day of your Redemption H Hallelujah and so brother bam says what was it those two prophets Moses and Elijah that that that prophetic Ministry would turn the hearts of the fathers back to the children it would be the ministry of Elijah and Moses that would do this brother bam says it's literally who they were I just read it today he talks about Elijah Elijah was never killed and he says so he's got to die Moses was never killed Michael the Archangel disputed with Satan over the body of Moses brother Adam says why because he was never buried he was he never mortally died he still got to die that's why the prophets in Revelations 11 will have to die and their body lay in the streets but you say brother M could it really be as brother Brandon was just hearing him say this today they say brother bam you say could it really be Moses and Elijah and he says well look on in in in in Mount Transfiguration there was Moses and Elijah with Jesus Christ and so so what was this this was a it was a spirit let me get back to my thought here tonight it was a spirit that was released under the sick seal and it went into the atmosphere listen friends the world you live in is literally under the anointing of a tribulation seal amen that's why the Bible that's why the brother Bon would prophesy and say I prophesy to you in the name of the Lord the world will go completely insane amen wow you're living in it wake up you're living in it I don't care how good South Carolina is down in the South how good it is in the South how we're the Bible bound how we're a Christian Nation founded on judaic Christian values listen friends that's a that's a day of History that's yesterday that's not today people are living on the Mirage or a memory of the past I'm here to tell you right now the world has gone completely insane it is drank the it is ingested the spirit of the sick SE that's why you see the the hatred for Jews hatred for the for the little land of Israel doesn't make sense doesn't make any sense the only way it could make sense is that it was prophecy being fulfilled that's right you believe that tonight it doesn't make any sense you couldn't put a rational reason why would the world you see the world uniting mobs and protest all around the world they had to shut an entire airport down in Russia when the refugee Jews had flown out of Israel and flown to Russia they had to shut the airport down because there was thousands of protesters ready to mob and assault these Jews who are running from refugees from Israel from the war how you say oh my goodness brother Matt that listen friends I'm going to tell you there's only one way how and that's because there's a spirit of destruction brother brandom says before God could ever destroy the world they have to get into the spirit of destruction first amen and so the world that you live in today is getting into the spirit did you know brother brandom said that he says before God could ever destroy the world they would have to fall under the spirit of destruction that's why that that that that's exactly why you live in a world full of hatred hatred senseless hatred yeah amen I thought about this today I thought it it doesn't even make sense it's it's just s senseless hatred listen friends the world that you live in that you rub shoulders with every single day is a short-tempered uh a toxic hateful uh listen friends there's a kindness is a thing of the past in the world we live in amen do you believe that anybody believe that here tonight am and so it would it would have to be this way the world is getting under the spirit of destruction and listen friends I'm just here to go ahead and preach this to you tonight if the world can get into a spirit of destruction under a sick seal how much more can the bride of Christ come under the anointing of the seventh seal under the seventh messenger with a Rapture anointing to change our bodies I say before God can ever change our bodies we got to come under the anointing of a seven seal the coming of the Lord to say Lord I don't want any of this hatred and Malice in the world I don't want any of the spiritual uh Lady of SE a world that I live in God I want an anointing of the Rapture to come and indwell my body indwell my mind Lord Jesus so what would it be it would be a even even prophesy this is what Zechariah prophesies here and you notice this it's the it's the you see it in in it appears 16 times times and in in verse 12 and verse 13 he keeps saying this in that day you notice there in your Bible look at Zechariah Chapter 12 again and he says in that day all the prophets would talk about this and say the day of the Lord they would the Bible refers to this over and over the day of the Lord this is the day of the Lord this means the day of judgment meaning when the Lord judges amen now we already had a a a we already had a supernatural Cloud up here and then brother bham says what did you notice when You' seen that it was the white wigged one supreme deity in Authority judging right hello and so we know this was Christ judging when the Lord would establish his throne uh the then listen friends God has allowed a period of time for man ands and kingdoms to rise and ru rulers to rise and Kings to rise both great and small but there's coming a time when the day of man is over and the day of the Lord begins Hallelujah he's allowed man to live his time there's a day when God allows Satan to be the prince of the power of the air but that day is coming to an end one day can you say Amen that there there is a time there's an allotted time when God allows Satan to be the God of this world amen but there's coming a day yes sir when he dethrones Satan the Bible calls it the day of the Lord It's referred to 16 times it's when there was when Christ returns as the Supreme judge now let's look at it verse one uh chapter if you look at Zechariah Chapter 13 turn in your Bible if you could just here for a moment I want you to look at this here with me and so Zachariah chapter 13 just one chapter over and verse one I got to get off of this because it's not it's just a foundation for where I really want to go so uh let's just read this here and in that day notice there it is again and in that day uh let me pull up the full yes uh shall be a fountain open to the House of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for in cleanness and it shall come to pass in that day that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land and they shall no more be remembered and I also will cause the prophets and the unclean Spirit to pass out of the land and it shall come to pass notice this here he he continues to go on uh we're just going to skip through some of this but I want you to notice this here it speaks of the siege of Israel that means an entire Gentile Army that surrounds we were just there me and brother Jason uh then brother Travis and our wives were just there in Israel and we got to go there to the to tell megiddo the hill of megiddo literally where the battle of Armageddon will take place it's incredible to me when I was watching when we was just standing there looking and we went out to the Outlook there in that little city and you could just see this Mass just this Valley that is the valley of Armageddon and and it's just this massive Valley this flatland with these mountains on this side and mountains on this side and you just seen for as far as you could see just a a a a flat land uninhabited just out in front of you maybe a road out in the middle and I just sat there and thought to myself and thought my goodness imagine imagine one day coming very soon little did I know just a month later Israel would go be be in war and I thought to myself standing there I thought isn't it incredible as we looked at that to think the Bible prophesies that God will bring all the nations of the earth to this field Amen to this one g geographical GPS location now notice here God says I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling in other words this isn't going to be a random happening or a random event God wants to make sure it's clear I'm the one calling the shots here amen as I stood there and looked I thought it was incredible here was the great battle of Armageddon that's going to take place and brother bandham says that great battle of Armageddon will simply be the Final War the final battle from the war that started in the Garden of Eden and so through that battle that starts in Eden and yet through all the way down through history there's been a war that's been waging you've been caught in the middle of it but the prophet of God says the final battle will take place in the battle of Armageddon and it will be a it will be a glor Global Army a a a global you want to talk about anti-Semitism anti anti Zionism the Semitic people the hatred for the restoration of the of the nation of Israel you want to you think that it's hatred right now imagine the entire world will turn their back on that even this nation listen friends they talk the the the the the the Bible shows you this nations in Revelations chapter 13 it'll speak like a dragon one day today and that gentle lamb that that gentle oh we just listen friends they the rulers of this world don't even realize it that they're under a pre-tribulation anointing that will eventually lead them to turn their back on that little nation of Israel yeah amen how many believe that here tonight and so there's a there's a there's a a a a a a an escalating this is what has to happen we know this that these kind of things must happen there's got to be an escalation of hatred for the Jews something has to take place because the Bible said it would amen you say do you I don't I don't like it I don't want it but I can't stop it right amen and people can't stop it even those that will stand against them can't stop it because they're under an anointing and so there would be such an extreme hatred for this tiny little small nation that sits in the Crossroads of the world this little bitty nation of people why why does why do you think do you think it's the Jewish life do you think it's their language is it Hebrew that they hate is that what causes the hatred is it the way that they dress is it the way that they look is it the color of their skin it must be racism it must be just they hate the tone listen friends there's one reason why the hatred could come to that level I'm going to tell you why because God set his love for that little nation and the devil hates what God loves oh friends do you realize why why all hell is against you cuz God has set his love on you listen friends when all hell rushes in you ought to you ought to take you ought to rejoice and say God that must prove you've got a lot of love I might not feel like I'm much Lord but you must think an awful a lot about meall and the Bible says here it will it will that the entire world will come against them even in chapter 12 it goes into detail to the attack of all the worldwide United Nation Army and it talks about how Israel be will be invaded it's it's it says here it's the burden notice this in verse one the burden the burden of the word of the Lord this is what God is saying this is this is important here Zachariah begins and says this is a burden from the Lord it's a message from the Lord It's directly from the Lord this isn't zachariah's message Zachariah is just the messenger yes amen you know what they did with Zachariah they murdered him y Jesus tells us that in Matthew 23 they hated the prophets why because the prophet is who the word of the Lord comes to listen you won't you won't have any hatred from the Devil as long as you don't have the word of the Lord but when you have the word of the Lord and you preach the word of the Lord you speak the word of the Lord you take a stand for the word of the Lord Jesus said they hated me they're going to hate you too and so it's a burden he says the burden the the the the word of the Lord concerning Israel and and he and he says here's what's going to happen it's going to be a this this burden means a weighty revelation it's it's a revelation this is this is a this is like Jesus talked about woe unto them this is something burdensome this is something heavy and then he goes on to say I will make I will make Israel notice this from god notice the prophecy what you're seeing here is God you see God in action through prophets through priests through Kings through people but now you're seeing God himself in action amen okay and God is saying I'm going to be the one orchestrating this there will be people that will be players but I will be in control there will be rulers that will be players or actors in this drama Satan actually will be the prime actor oh yeah little does he know why did Brother Adam say when would Jesus When God says I'll bring all the nations of the earth as I sat there and looked at that field and I was talking to brother Travis I said isn't incredible that God says I'll gather all nations to this field and you say why would God do this to bring all and he goes on and zachar says because I'll have them all in one place to pour out my wrath upon them amen God says there's going to be players but God is going to be the director yes amen God is the one doing this that's why from verse two to verse 9 you read these statements God says in verse 2 Zechariah 12 God says in verse two behold I I personal pronoun I will do this behold I will make Jerusalem verse three I will strike verse four I will open verse six I will make verse N I will set verse 10 I will pour what is he saying here in the first person you don't find this anywhere else in the Bible God is saying I want you to catch this this is something that I'm going to be doing this is Sovereign this is this is God saying I'm going to be the one in control of the future of the world oh can you say Amen let me say this the the civilization is not some random thing that's like a clock wound up that God just wound up it's just going through time and one day the wrong person will will push the wrong button and all the world will end and all time will end listen friends that ain't how God runs things amen God knows the specific day hour minute hallelujah amen and he's making this clear in Zechariah Chapter 12 I I want to remove all possibility of you wondering how human history will end there's not going to be any mystery the world is not going to come to an end by some great random event or some Collision some great environmental catastrophe and eventually global warming will just cat the catch the atmosphere on fire and everyone's going to burn or some comment from the you know stratosphere is going to implode the world Listen friends it's not going to be some random event it's not going to be something that goes wrong are you catch are you hearing me tonight it's not going to be something that just mishap just a mishap that happens and everybody's listen that's how people run their lives they the anxiety and the nervousness that the the the world is completely drunk with is because they have no Revelation and when you have no Revelation everything is uncertain yes amen it's uncertainty that produces anxiety it's uncertainty of what's going to happen that produces fear at the Bible prophesies and said men's Hearts will actually fail to and say I'm so glad I've got a revelation I'm so glad I've got a stability I've got an answer to the devil's question there's nothing uncertain about my life everything has already been mapped out planned out orchestrated to [Music] God we're not going to be blasted you know into some tiny bits because of some comment or some asteroid but let me say it this way God says the ending of all time time is clearly defined in scripture amen and here's how it's defined I will I will set I will pour I will bring amen God's saying you know who's going to bring the world to the to its conclusion me not Putin not Biden not Trump if he gets reelected I'll say that again not Trump if he gets reelected listen there will be players there will be actors but it will be God listen I just want to tell the devil tonight you don't control my life in fact you don't have any levers of my life in your control you don't have any Avail you don't have access to the buttons that control my life my life is surrounded and shielded by almighty God and God pulls the levers and God pushes the buttons that's why I can say Lord it doesn't matter what happens to me I may breathe my last breath here on this side it's because you chose that exact moment at that exact time and you know best lord the devil doesn't say when my life ends brother bandham said that the devil can't even touch you can't take you until God's finished with you we ought to get a resounding amen and so it's this hatred that comes uh the the the description of the Bible says all the nations of the earth will gather against Jerusalem and Judah against the people of Israel and so the Bible talks about this and talks about it says it's a cup of of trembling this this this word cup is I can't pronounce the uh the the the word that that the the the the uh Hebrew word here but it's not like a cup like a like a cup of coffee but it's a cup it's it's because a cup like that is something that someone drinks from but this is something that the the the the Bible uses this word here and it says that it's a not just a coffee cup but it's actually a large Basin Amen in other words all the nations of the Earth have drunken of the wine of her fornication it's not just a little anointing that comes upon the nation of America but it actually engulfs the entire world globally do you know that that is the power of a spirit a spirit can bring an anointing globally not just to one person but to many that's why the Holy Ghost is the same in America as it is in Africa the Holy Ghost is the same in Africa as it has in as as it is in Russia and the same spirit that comes upon the world in the end time is The Same Spirit that's anointing Russia it's anointing China it's anointing America the Bible says they have all drank from the wrath of her fornication can you say amen amen and so this is this is the age that you live in it's an age of hatred it's an age of inclusion where you have our group and our people and our click and our Circle this is where denominationalism forms from the same exact Spirit of unity is upon the denominational church that's why it's called The Binding of the tears because they have to have something to unify them something to be identified with can can I turn a corner here tonight something to be identified with but it's the same Spirit a spirit of hatred you know I I just I just hear today just just hearing God's Prophet talk about Divine love and I thought you know Divine love is something so different than human love because human love is fleeting it's emotional you love when it's good but you don't when it's not but Divine love is a love that's not not conditional it's not it's not constrained or controlled by exterior circumstances and so God says God says while the world has dranken from a from a basin of hatred amen I'm going to give a basin of divine love I'm going to send gifts to the body now listen they not not evil things these are good things things to encourage things to strengthen amen why does God send gifts to the body not to tear down but to build up you ought to never use your gift to tear down that's not why God gave it to you he gave it to build up he gave it to to to strengthen it's what we read here in our in our Bible in our opening text in in in Ephesians to where every joint Supply and so we live in an age where the Bible the scripture talks about that they'll be heady high-m minded amen right amen how many here believe right now you you you live under the Fulfillment of that scripture where they're heav high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God doesn't mean they won't be lovers of God you see a uh one of the most binding Spirits is a religious spirit oh yes Amen to say I love God but I don't want his word but I'm here to say Lord I want your word I want all of your word not just some of it listen friends not just a part of it but all of it amen as brother brandham says it won't just be the they won't just point you to one part of the word but the whole word the entire so God says I'm going to send gifts and it's incredible to me because you know brother Bron preached this in Romans 12 and he talks about the diversities and the varieties of gifts even in Romans 12 it says let ministers wait on their Minister and teachers wait on their teaching and those that exhort wait on their exhortation and so God clearly says in Romans 12 there's diversities people are different not everybody's the same amen I'm going to turn a corner here so just stay with me here just for a moment but you know human nature carnal nature Fallen nature that you still have after you're born again I said carnal nature Fallen nature human nature that you still have well I'm filled with the holy ghost from the head of my from my head to my toes man it comes out of it comes out of my mouth I'm overflowing with the with the Holy Ghost come on that's fine that's good praise God for it you still live with a sticky nature and in that sticky nature if you're if the the if in that I'm just going to move on let me keep going you know what it is about Fallen nature you know what you know what people like people like everything to be in their box right and anything that's outside of their box uh it's lesser than good we'll just call it that less than ideal but people listen the Bible speaks clearly about diversities of gifts teachers we just read it in Ephesians chapter 4 and he gave some teachers a prophets Apostles evangelists pastors for the edification of the body not the tearing down not to give place to hatred and bitterness and Malice and envy but the Bible goes further didn't we just read about it to be kindly affectionate one towards another but people do you realize this is what makes up a cult that's what makes up a coat is one culture only room for your favorite and your preference oh boy it's quiet in here did you hear that this is what makes up a cold I'm just telling telling you read it right from Brother Google if you want when you only have room for your flavor or your kind or your idea or your purpose listen friends I'm just going to go on and say a lot of things that we call uh sinful and wrong and right really just are our preferences I'm not I'm I'm not here I'm here to preach to you there's things that are clearly wrong and clearly right but if we're not careful we get so clammed down and narrow-minded that we put anything outside of how we were raised how we grew up but God is a god of variety God is not a God who cuts anyone out let me just goe and preach to you there are no orphans in God's family there are no outcasts in his family there are no rejects in his family in fact God doesn't put anybody out we put people out we cut out anything and every everyone that's not like us doesn't talk like you look like you this is really where racism is this is it's the same exact Spirit you say brother man where in the word are you going it's the same exact spirit that you're seeing in Zechariah 12 that comes upon the entire world because they won't unify because they won't be different because they want to be different they won't come under order they won't come under the Harmony the same Rhythm and many people think that the biggest listen I'm just going to go and preach here for a moment I just reading from my notes God makes everyone different I'll go a little bit further and can I bring it down just a little bit more not everybody's the same not everybody thinks like you not everybody thinks the thoughts that you think not everyone has the same perspective that you have not everybody is the same uh listen not everybody preaches the same if we're not careful we think that the only one who's preaching is the man who's got the the the foam cover filled with Slava or he's not red-faced or he's not yelling and screaming listen I you obviously would know that's I've got a preference I prefer preaching I I prefer spitting and screaming and red face yelling but God didn't make everybody that way amen amen hello God didn't make everybody some people are are you know you know what what can cause so much confusion and so much disharmony is Unity is not all of us agreeing on everything I'm just going to go ahead and preach because I'm out here on a limb and I got one option I'm just got to keep going Unity is not all of us agreeing on everything you might disagree with me I'm positive I'll disagree with you you might not share the same exact opinions that I do does that put me out and you in or me in and you out nope so people say oh well you know we've got we've got problem with intellectual intellectual people uh you know because brother bandom had so much to say about intellectual preaching and I'm all I'm against it brother Brandon was against dry-eyed intellectualism but listen friends there's been as many spitting screaming slobbering Dynamic Fireball preachers that have stood behind pull pits and led lives of adultery the problem has not been the preference the problem has been they haven't been filled with the Holy Ghost hello the problem is not the type of person ality because I've learned there's different personalities and people are different and people look at things different and people view things different I got a question it doesn't matter what I think or what you think it only matters really right what God thinks amen and so so not all of us are the same people from the South are different I don't care what you say than people from the north Amen brother Ken he ain't from there anymore people from the East are different than people from the West take my word for it right brother Matthew very different my father-in-law told me when I first moved to Arizona I was 18 years old he said Matt you got to get to you got to learn something because I just wanted after church I wanted to go over to people's house and fellowship and have lunch and spend the day together people weren't like that out there the church got over and they were G man back to their cars all to their different locations he said you got to realize people in Arizona are a lot like the cactus they're real sticky don't get too close they're different now not all of them are like that there's some born no I'm just kidding I really mean not all of them are like that you go into different parts of Arizona they're not that way you go into certain Southern Parts more towards the desert listen people are different people from the East are different than people from the west and there's good about them and there's bad about us and there's positives about them and negatives about them and there's positives about the south and believe it or not some negatives about the south Amen in fact it would be our area that would be called The Rebel State and you think that doesn't pass on down to people to have a rebellious re rebel against Law and Order right amen all right you true Saif Southerners you got to say Amen to the word of God it's true anyway listen not not all people are the same H there's different flavors there's different foods it even gets bigger when you look at different countries amen different countries people approach things different do you know in China when I was in China in 2014 whatever it was do you know that over there it's a good thing when the church splits because it means your church has grown to such a size that you're going to have attention from the government so you actually have to go in and split the church and one Pastor takes one group and another Pastor takes another group imagine trying that here in the States but in China it's a good thing the church in chind doall when it split it got over 200 people two brothers Pastor got together got with the minister and said let's pray God gives a finds he sends the right man which one of you out of all these brothers to to to lead the other Church they split the church down the middle half the church went down to a church about 30 miles down the road One Church of the north one Church of the South wow it's different it's a different Playbook try to play by our Playbook over there and say well you know you the the word of God is clear listen the word of God is clear but there's differences in varieties and applications okay Lord this is what you wanted me to preach now does that mean that God is only going to Rapture the people out of the South or the people in the United States of America they asked brother Bon that question we got to live in Tucson we got to live in Indiana does everyone got to move move listen friends this is this is the thinking that's upon carnal nature and so do does it mean that God only loves people from this place or or this country or does it mean the that the bride of Christ around the world will all act the same talk the same even look the same listen they don't all look the same and certain cultures I visited in certain countries the way that that they dress it's modest there's modesty they're dressed according to the message of the hour but there's differences and so God never intended to make us all the same Amen to look the same hello somebody he didn't want us to all look like Southerners I know some of us believe that that that that that we should but that's not how God intended he didn't ever let me just go further and say he doesn't even want every Church to look like each other amen amen he doesn't want this church to match another church and that church to match another church and that would do everything the same way I'm afraid if we're not careful that's what's happened in the message is everybody has a benchmark and they all try to be like this one or be like that one or look like this one or look like that one whatever happened to The Sovereign body the local assembly being led by the holy ghosten amen if we're not careful we lose our sovereignty of local bodies and I'm afraid even live streaming services that's been great we do it I love it thank God for it but listen friends God Satan will take any of these things and pervert them in such a way I've watched it happen and to where you have you have you have preachers preaching to a YouTube audience because the pastor of this church I've heard it myself I'm preaching only here locally but I've heard it myself how One Pastor was telling another Pastor how that he had got up that Sunday and blasted this other Pastor because of what that Pastor said to his pull pit that he streamed his service and he heard what that meant so he got behind his pulpit and I'm just thinking where are the people in all this they might as well dismiss and go home if this is what it's really became about if we're not careful we become no different than the Republicans and the Democrats I'm just going to preach it if we're not careful we become no different than Republicans and Democrats and groups over here clicks over here denominations over here brotherhoods over here what happened to the body of Christ I heard one brother saying I thought it was so powerful he said you know it's just how you tune an instrument you don't tune that guitar to a tuning pick and then take that guitar and you go over to the piano and then you tune the piano to that guitar that was tuned to the tuning pick then you take that piano and you tune the organ to the piano that was tuned to the guitar that the guitar was tuned to the tuning pick then you take the organ and you tune it tune the mandolin to the organ that was tuned to the piano to the guitar that's not how you do it you say well I wouldn't they work because there's always going to be subtle differences what you do is you have one absolute Hallelujah you have one absolute the word and everybody's tuned to the word and when you're all tuned to the word you'll get the same result you'll get the same manif estation you get the same Holy Ghost and so was God just going to send was God going to make everyone look the same act the same all churches all preachers will be the same you ain't called you ain't even anointed if you're not yelling in your voice decimal doesn't reach over 80 well send me that quote brother send me that scripture where does it even say it in the Bible listen to what the word of God says here turn up my PowerPoint if you could listen this is what the word this is what the word preach means the mark 16:15 he said unto them go you into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature this is the word Caruso to be a Herald Proclaim properly to Herald to Proclaim this is why brother brandom says you can live a sermon louter than you can preach a sermon cuz your life can Proclaim something and affect somebody that my sermon can never touch it means to announce a message publicly and with conviction persuasion to be a Herald to officiate as a Herald to Proclaim after the manner of a Herald always with suggestion of formality gravity and Authority which must be listened to and obeyed I didn't hear screaming I didn't hear getting voices over 80 decimals say brother Matt why are you harping on that because I'm here to tell you there's a spirit in the world that comes upon the entire nation that if we're not careful we get under the same order of the unification of the world we all got to be the same look the same act the same talk the same when God is a god of varieties and not everybody is the same amen not all churches are the same you ever go overseas how many here raise your hand have you've been overseas been on a missionary trip not to not to Canada that's not even overseas how many has been on a missionary trip okay good then you would know I'm preaching this and I'm not just making this up not all churches look like our churches in the USA brother math that just means they haven't caught the Revelation they need to close those churches up they need to get on live stream take video take cameras take pictures look like us dress like talk like us act like us sing the same songs we sing uhuh that's not what it's not God's church amen and so does it mean that the bride of Christ were around the world well listen of course it doesn't mean that because what God was going to send to dress the bride it wasn't going to be a Southern Culture it wasn't going to be a northern culture in fact it wasn't going to be an American culture can you say Amen today but what would dress the bride would be the word and it would be a culture from above it would be a Heavenly language it would be a Heavenly dress code it would be a Heavenly tongue it would be varieties of people with different skin types with different languages in different countries but all LED under the same Holy Ghost then what would be the same it would be the same gospel message that was resounded and delivered at Pentecost would be preached throughout the entire bride amen can I get a loud amen here tonight listen the prophet of God says in Ephesian Church age that is her standard that's the pattern there is no other pattern what God did at Pentecost would be the pattern until the church ages in God will not change so it Loose I got to move on the the the the the the so the spirit and the bride would say come so her message would be the same I'm not saying that you change the message I'm not saying it's this church over here that believes it this way and we believe it that way and that's not what I'm saying amen amen I'm saying that there's people that are different God didn't make us all the same and that's the way God designed itah let's hear how brother Brandon dealt with people that didn't believe like him not that this is the anointed ones at the end time not that we disagree with you brother to be different many of you here might be trinitarian preachers yeah we don't want to be angry with you we love you it's amazing to me that a prophet could have love for a trinitarian preacher who believes in three Gods whether he knows it or not and yet we can stomp out stifle out and talk so disparagingly of another brother who believes the message but might see something a little different than what you see amen amen we love you if we didn't if I didn't believe that I'd never leave this church till I got down there on my knees and said God make me right a trinitarian preacher and yet it's okay for us to talk disparagingly about people who don't believe like us I don't want to be arrogant listen I love this he says I don't want that arrogant selfish spirit mixed up with mine me neither Brother Brandon I want my spirit I love this I want my spirit to be pure and clean Brotherly Love holy with the Holy Spirit oh how many just identify with that and say I don't want that arrogant SE selfish spirit I want my spirit to be clean I want it to be holy before God if someone does anything wrong to me that's all right and though I might have the right to to get back at them I don't want that in my life oh God help us to get back to this kind of spirit to where we care about the spirits that we have in our life I don't know about you friends I'm just going to be honest with you when I read those words I I I nearly collapsed I was just cried and cried my eyes out I said God there's so many things that I could say I don't want that in my life and I I look at things in my life and I sometimes friends I'll be honest with you I look in the mirror and I hate who I am oh yeah I believe that any single one of us could could say that and say I don't like who I am I don't like how I act sometimes sometimes I'm temperamental sometimes I'm selfish oh come on somebody be honest here tonight sometimes I say the wrong thing sometimes I lose my temper but I'm saying tonight I don't want that in my life I want to be clean of that jesusall though I might have the right to get back to them I don't he says I don't want that in my life I want to have love I want to be ready to correct with love with love that absolutely answers out yonder for it I don't mean to be different Methodist Baptist Catholic Presbyterian whoever you are I don't say these things to be different to be Arrogant with you if I did I'm a hypocrite and should be down here at this altar praying through to God but I say it it's because of love and I see where you're going now I don't say this in myself and saying I'm presuming I give you thus saith the Lord that is the truth and I love you for those things did his love stop him from saying the cutting hard things he had to say no it didn't stop him but his attitude and his Spirit was clean before God and it was love that constrained him to say it listen in birth pains 1965 if I'm make mistakes forgive me I'm not a theologian I don't criticize theologians theology is all right it's what we need but sometimes I criticize the condition that we've gotten into that doesn't mean to any certain individuals it's just the message amen can I go further I wish that it wasn't mine to give it tears me apart you mean this was the disposition of a true prophet of God he didn't come with that message of Wrath and destruction he didn't come there licking his chops oh I can't wait to get out there and just that wasn't the true that wasn't the evidence of a true that wasn't the spirit of a true Prophet hello he says it tears me to Pieces because you know how you feel of your own children don't you hate to give a don't you hate to have to give a child a scolding balling out or something though I'm a parent too and I know what it means and I trust you forgive me God's power to transform if somebody would come to me something contrary I would kind of just argue and argue and argue with them and when they didn't see it my way I'd get on WhatsApp and i' paste it to this person and to that person and to that person and say oh that brother's just going under intellectualism he's just a dry-eyed b you know Reformed Baptist he don't even believe the message brother bham said something contrary I would kind of misunderstand it myself I wouldn't want to criticize what anyone says we're not to criticize each other I'm not guilty of doing that I thank the Lord I have criticized sin and unbelief but no individual person see I don't we are brothers I love this and sisters striving we are coming down to where sister Florence came yesterday morning we all got to come that way and it's not my purpose to try to criticize a brother or sister that wouldn't agree with you amen I'm afraid as one brother said so perfectly we have the message of William brandham but we don't have the spirit that William brandom delivered it in I see a lot of this I should hear a lot of this amen as one brother said we have the message he preached but I'm afraid we don't have the spirit in which the messenger gave it brother bam says that in the church age book it's got to be the message and the spirit of the message it's got to be set in the spirit of Christ Hello friends it's not my purpose to criticize a brother or sister that wouldn't agree with you no be it far from me to do that I don't think you'll ever find a tape that I called anybody's name on which I felt many times the person was wrong but that's between them and God but what is wrong in the way of sin and misunder understanding sometimes is not even sin it's just misunderstandings of people and I think I think I think each one of us has a right to express ourself to our own understanding amen oh God help us to have that kind of an attitude I think each one of us has a right to express ourself to our own understanding but you see what a cult does is it cuts off anyone who doesn't line up with my understanding amen all right we'll keep going the way to have Fellowship I'd rather have a church listen just a moment I'd rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other and with Christ I'd rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church amen amen now that might sound hard in a Pentecostal group but I would rather have it where there is gifts they'll fail where there is gifts they'll bring confusion where there is gifts they can be questioned but when there is love it is perfect that's right and if you had perfect love you'd have perfect gifts that's right so work first with love that brings fellowship and fellowship brings gifts amen and a Pentecostal Church the spoken word the original seat is just as bad listen to what he identifies with the Pentecostal church because brother bandham always stood no matter oh my goodness I just went way back I'm sorry we're not going to repeat these as brother brandham uh uh says this is this is it he always stood between two things I was just hearing the token message last night and brother Brandon begins to talk about how that we've made Thanksgiving a tradition and he talks about how that one he says everything's just became a tradition anymore and he says I was watching a Billy Graham meeting and he says I watched as they as Billy Graham gave the altar call and he says I watched a bunch of boys up there around the altar punching each other in the arm laughing cutting Co giggling hollering then praying brother Ram says that's not how you come to the altar of God you don't come giggling and laughing and hooping and shouting and hollering but he's preaching on the token to be identified with your lamb and he says when you come to the altar you're coming to die yeah amen and so brother random hits against that that that that that that that uh that take towards towards a confession a repentance to where it's just made light of and he says he says people can pray for healing oh God heal me of this heal me of that he says but when it comes down to real repentance real self- sacrifice real dying out to oneself all they don't want anything to do with that and he says but then Thanksgiving has become a tradition and he says I'm going to put it in your lap when you come to the altar in a dry-eyed confession it's just a tradition yeah amen and so the prophet of God identifies always between two groups the Pentecostal group and the Baptist group you say well which one was he identified with right down the middle of the road amen and whether you to accept this or not I can show it to you in the message brother brandham said he drew from both groups they both had a truth both were in ditches and I don't want to be in neither one can I get a hearty amen listen what brother ad says in Pentecost church is just a bad just as bad a bunch of jumping and shouting and speaking in tongues and things like that you say brother mat you preaching and againsts jumping and shouting my goodness you know me I'm not preaching against that amen but listen to what he says sh shouting and speaking in tongues when it comes down enough temper to fight a buzle and turn you out of their congregation you take a person that speaks with tongues enough temper to fight a buzo and talk about the neighbors and everything like that why you call that the Holy Ghost come on Amen it cannot be no sir speaking in tongues oh you say oh you going to speak in tongues you might but listen friends you may never speak in tongues you may may never speak in tongues you may never you may never dance in the spirit but here's what you better not miss you better not miss that life that changes your temper cuz you can have all of the jumping and shouting and and rejoicing or better have the love of Christ down in your heart that'll make you encourage one another not talk about each other the marriage of the Lamb the Holy Ghost is meekness joy peace longsuffering goodness gentleness patience Faith the Holy Ghost that's the fruit of the spirit that the Holy Spirit bears in the Church of the Living God sweetness man it's not just good old southern people that are sweet no Holy Ghost filled Christians are sweet amen amen and humbleness humility love one for another longsuffering friends I'm afraid sometimes we've left off the main thing we've majored on these things but we've left off the main thing Amen brother says if a Brother's going wrong don't just beat him or something or something another go after him and see if you can get him back don't wait for the preacher to do it you do it somebody else preacher can't do it all neither can the deacons everybody's a member of the body of Christ should go after one another you you mean go after them on text to another person right you mean go after them on Facebook and write a subliminal post that's directly talking about them but not really calling out their name that's not what he means we got if we got the spirit of Christ in us he taught the great Parable they left the 90 and n and went after that one that's what we're supposed to do but we say oh let them go we never should do that you should be gentle forgiving longsuffering that's the fruit of the spirit amen hello church amen the thing is the church has went on without went off without God they've went off without they found out the fruit of the spirit has left the church long this is getting in the spirit this is getting in the spirit this is the message 1961 getting in the spirit I know what it means to get in the spirit brother means when I get to dancing and I get to shout I get to rejoice and and speaking in tongues I'm really in the spirit you might be but you might just be in an emotional workup and not in the spirit of at all amen amen in the message get it in the spirit brother bandam says the church is left off found out the fruit of the spirit has left the church longsuffering some of them with enough temper why it would fight a buz saw and talk about the Holy Ghost why the fruit of the spirit is love joy longsuffering yes about suffered brother brandom says suffered yes about two minutes that's all and away they go so longsuffering fruits all dried up if I only look down tonight and look here in this city look for the lastest is Abraham's Covenant confirmed I'm going to get through these and then we're going to close is that all right is that all right look for the last three month come on I haven't preached in probably three months give me a little bit of Grace here tonight if I only look down tonight and look here in the city look for the last three remember I'm only long winded depends on who you compare me to it's all relative look for the last three months where I've been Across the Nation and see the falling away of the churches the indifference of the pastors see the indifference among the people who come out look like fishes and loes and the first little thing got enough temper to fight a buzzle and indifferent nasty the Pentecostal people ministerial you brother Matt you don't you must not know what righteous indignation is I'm telling you what you don't know what righteous indignation is I just got Godly Zeal listen friends brother bam says the Zeal of the hour is to say I'm sorry I Repent Lord hello Ministerial Association wants to draw me out of the ring the Ministerial Association wants to draw me out of the ring just because I led a man on the platform that wasn't baptized the way they thought he ought to be baptized oh such indifference oh such indifference because God doesn't make everybody the same God doesn't make us all the same listen friends if we're not careful we get to a place to where we cut everybody off that doesn't see it Like Us think like us talk like us I'm talking about message Believers oh yeah I'll go a little bit further and say even in churches we we're not careful we make our own circle of friends and our own Circles of clicks that ought not to be in this church we ought to be one body I said one body to where every joint supplieth and if you see one going off you ought to go after him Lord just begin to deal with my heart so strong I'm going to close the Zeal of the hour brother brandham says is to repent is to repent that's the Zeal of the bride the spirit of the age is my rights the spirit of the age is a spirit of destruction we talked about it the spirit of the age is one that's weak wimpy sissies amen hello that's the spirit of the age but that's not the spirit that you're under the anointing of the age that the bride gives is an eagle anointing to rise above all of the spirits that are in the in the fourth dimension and that were Rel released under the sick seal you say brother matth they're in the world that doesn't mean you got to ingest them that doesn't mean you got to give them place that doesn't mean you got to give them place in your heart we ought not make an excuse for anything we ought not make any excuse for anything in our personality of how we were raised or what we went through anything that's contrary to the word of God we ought to repent amen and say God change me I don't want that in my life Lord that's the spirit of the of the age and so so notice this here I'm just going to I'm just going to preach this here I printed out some things the Lord was just giv me just this afternoon in in my vehicle as I just begin to pray just begin to talk to the Lord and I just begin to say Lord I I and my own heart these words kept just coming back to me back to Gethsemane go back to Geth the Lord just begin to deal with my heart even as I prepared for this message as I was listening to the Token not what I preached here tonight but I'm just here at the end uh brother BR talks about being identified with our atonement you know what it means it means to be identified with a dying out to oneself back to our sacrifice back to to real genuine love if we read in Ecclesiastes chapter 4 grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby you're sealed unto the day of your your Redemption then he goes right after that he goes right after that and start saying don't walk as G other Gentiles walk with tattling and back bitings and Malice and hatred these things shouldn't be named amongst us listen friends I'm just going to say this we have the example from a prophet of God a true Prophet on how to be a man can I get an amen I said we have an example of a true prophet of what it means to be a man and he wasn't a but he also wasn't a chauvinist he also wasn't an arrogant person he also wasn't a hotty attitude person in facts you knows it's been said many times brother the Billy Paul said the greatest miracle was that you couldn't tell his enemies from his friends yeah amen amen amen we have the example from a prophet on how to not be a jellyfish not be a compromise you think brother bandom compromised with those trinitarians when he got to run trinitarians he just sort of put his Doctrine to the side and said you know I just sort of sort of be a chameleon and any group of in no that's not what the prophet of God did he took a stand for the word of God we have the example of what it means to have a stand for the word of God you don't have to be a jellyfish to have love you don't have to be a compromiser to have love can I get the church to give me an amen here tonight come on I need them right here at the end you don't have to be listen friends you don't have to be a jellyfish or a compromiser or a weakling without a backbone to still have love one for another we have the example of a prophet who could take a stand not be a bad not be a compromiser not be a jellyfish but still a Man Who Loved a man who was gentle a man who was kindly affectionate you say the sign of the son of man was the ministry of discernment of heart I truly believe that but I believe there was more to the sign of the son of man than just the ministry to discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart I believe we've seen more in a prophet of God I believe we' seen the maturity of the nature of Christ in a human being and I say God don't just give me the message give me the spirit of the message oh don't just give me doctrines give me a life give me something that's real give me something that breathes something that's real something that can touch something that can feel something that can reach out sir amen not arrogant not hay musicians could you come not temperamental but real friends I want the real thing I don't know about you here tonight as you stand your feet with me but I want the real thing I want the thing that really changes my nature if all my Revelation make makes me arrogant then I don't want it if all my Revelation makes me angry I don't want it hello if all my great stoop and all my Great Heights of Revelation and all the all my understanding if all of it makes me as bitter and boastful if it doesn't make me love my enemy then what good is it but I'm here to preach to you and tell you the true Gospel of Jesus Christ will make you love your enemy the true Gospel of Jesus Christ will make you a gentle person the true love the true Gospel of Jesus Christ will make you love one another amen even when it seems impossible the true love the true Revelation doesn't give you bitterness or hum and contriteness and love can you bow your heads with me here tonight I'm afraid sometimes as the prophet of God says we've accepted a church Spirit but not the Holy Spirit I thought about this today every head bowed every eye closed and maybe nothing I've said here will mean anything to you but maybe just just give me this one this one minute life has a way life that the life that you live has a way of wearing your patience down come on I I know it's not I'm not the only one has a way of wearing your patience down wearing you thin wearing your tolerance thin even to where even in your own heart as a Believer born of the spirit of God you know deep down inside of your heart there's something there Lord that's not like you there's something there Lord that I can't find in the the word is not identified in the nature of Christ I can't justify that thing I can't I can't give it I can't I can't put any kind of excuse to it I know there's things in my life things in my flesh oh brother Matt that I just I won't free of I I say like the prophet of God says I don't want that in my life how many honest hands could go up before the Lord mine up and sayl I don't want that arrogant cruel cruel-hearted that Spirit of temper I don't want that in my life Lord say brother Matt is there a cure can it be cured is there an answer to my bitterness is there an answer to my temper oh my brother I got hope for you tonight there's hope there's an answer to that there's a cure for that Spirit of anger there's a cure for that bitterness there's a cure for that temper it's the true atonement the true Holy Ghost that's been restored back to you where you could really take on the spirit of the Lamb that nature not a nature to say give me my rights but that nature of the Lamb to say I'm going to lay down my rights I'm going to become a true sacrifice oh that runs so contrary to the world but it's in the nature of the seed that's down inside of you I just want to say by an uplifted hand to say God give me that true give me that true real thing Lord that changes give me the fruits of the spirit Lord give me that I I want all of it God not just part of it I don't ever want to settle for any part of my Humanity I want to say like David said in Psalms 51 I wonder if you could pray that prayer David says create in me a clean heart amen created me I love that word because it's so special cuz David realize Lord this isn't something I can manufacture I've tried it in all my best efforts I've tried to give myself a Clean Heart Lord but I'm going to use a word that only applies to the Creator create in me a clean heart Jesus and here's another word I want to pray and I want you to raise your hand if you uh resonate renew the right Spirit Within Me oh God renew the right Spirit Within Me Oh god listen friend that's a prayer I can't pray for you you got to pray it for yourself you can raise your hand and that's wonderful that you identify but if you really want it if there's really something down inside of you you've got to ask the Lord and say God I'm praying like David create in me a clean heart renew a right Spirit within me take not your Holy Ghost take Not Your Spirit Away From Me Lord renew the right Spirit oh God you can do it Lord Jesus I believe it with all my heart as I close here tonight Lord you can do it I believe with all of my heart there's a bomb in Gilead there's a cure for sin there's a cure for sin nature I want it Lord I strive for it I raise my hands and say I want it Lord Jesus give me the compassion that you have for this for the man that's dying for the sin sick world give me a True Heart of Love I'm not a compromiser I'm not wanting to compromise with sin but give me true compassion give me true love give me a true nature of meekness gentleness of spirit give it to me Lord I want it I seek it I desire it Lord God give me a nature Lord that's one like a lamb not a bous boisterous arrogant proud but give me that Meek gentle kind loving sweet humble all those words Lord I'm praying because it's my desire I raise my hand and say Lord It's my desire to take upon the nature of Christ I want to be identified with My Sacrifice he was a lamb that gave himself he was a lamb who had all the right in the world to live but gave up his right God and I'm asking tonight let me be identified with that true atonement of Christ where I can say the right things think the right things do the right things I want my character to be molded like kids God you didn't just send us a word just to make us excited I'm excited tonight Lord you didn't give us a word just to shout I'm shouting but that's not the only reason that it was sent it was sent to give us the literal life of Jesus Christ the very nature of the token comes upon the believer and I raise my hands with every individual here and say give it to me Lord I accept my token I want to be identified with My Sacrifice I'm not going to be ashamed of it tonight Lord I'm going to be in honesty in honesty and contriteness I'm going to say Lord I'm wrong I'm sorry I Repent oh can you do it friends can you really do do it can you stand before the Lord and say God I Repent I'm going to start right here I Repent of my attitude I Repent of my spirit I Repent of my arrogance I Repent of my pride I don't want it Lord I'm letting it go right now I'm asking Lord give me the nature of Christ as your Prophet said even if I've been done wrong give me a love that can look past that can forgive and forget Lord Jesus Oh in a world of hatred how we need the love of God I pray it come over this entire body of Believers here in Buford Lord I pray it father for my family I pray it for my children I pray it for myself Lord I pray it for one another may we all pray

and and renew a right Spirit within me we're going to have a testimony here if you have one amen we'll take time just for a couple then we'll let you go brother JD has a special one from Sister Amy he wants to give amen so this is a testimony from Amy this happened on Saturday um at the Youth Camp I'm just going to read what she says during the day I was feeling off very weak tired and shaky and felt my heart racing I went back to our room to rest hoping that that would do the trick it didn't change much so I got ready to head down to the cameras get the cameras ready for service sister Ruth chatted with me a little and decided to call Meredith who wanted to check me out before service she took my blood pressure a couple times which was alarmingly high uh 220 over 120 well above stroke levels sister mer has made the call to have me stay back from service and rest and rehydrate my blood blood pressure and heart rate came down to 170 over 90 so I went ahead and went to bed I was streaming the service I made it through all the preaching and about half of the prayer line when I noticed I was feeling badly again I turned the service off to go to sleep at some point after that I don't know when I startled awake to my face feeling tingly and my lips starting to feel numb my first thought was I wonder if this is what the start of a stroke feels like I should probably call someone but but don't remember anything after that I woke up later when people started coming back after service and one of the first things Jason told me was that Sister Sarah had gone and stood for me in the prayer line when I told the testimony to sister Rachel she she said she'd been streaming the service as well and towards the end she suddenly had the thought that something horrible was going to happened to be in my sleep she immediately rebuked Satan and prayed for me as I began to real realized fully what had happened and how how God had intervened I remembered an experience that I had two weeks prior to Camp that gave me the Fuller picture I was home alone with Addie and I was looking I was looking at her thinking of a trip that we have planned for Christmas time a thought was dropped into my mind that I wouldn't go on that trip because I would die before that I didn't say anything but was shocked Addie completely unaware out of the blue started asking me questions about dying and suddenly started crying saying mommy I don't want you to to die I asked her where that came from she said it just popped into her head we immediately rebuked Satan out loud and went to prayer uh she says I've seen both a cardiologist and primary care doctor the cardiologist said my heart looked good he didn't see anything that he was worried about and my doctor said that it's likely that I had a TIA a mini stroke lasting less than 5 minutes but that there is nothing that they can do to test for it as there was no damage so we thank the Lord for for sparing Amy's life we're so grateful for that spiritual warfare was taken place devil was mad about what was happening that camp but we got the victory amen thank god sister Amy's here tonight they're doing the camera but thank God for that amen anybody else got a testimony something they want to share quickly yes brother John I want toy feeling my eyes uh I'm waiting on complete clearing up I expect to see it anytime and I and I also want to testify that you leading up to Camp you know um I've been having trouble that week with my eyes just not being clear and the stigmatism all that and I just Lord you know I'm Healed I'm I believe your word I'm waiting just you know it's it's it's mine I accepted it your word word is true and and I was thinking on the uh that week leading up to Camp you know I have to drive up in the dark you know and um it's harder to see in the dark I woke up that morning for camp and we were driving up in the dark and I was like wait I can see really well and the Lord touched my eyes for
