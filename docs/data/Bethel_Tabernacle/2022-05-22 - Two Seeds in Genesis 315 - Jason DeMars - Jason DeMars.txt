TRANSCRIPT
========================================
morning everyone god bless you we can stand and pray and we'll read our scripture heavenly father we just come to you now lord and we're so thankful for your goodness for your mercy to us lord i just pray that you'd guide and direct our hearts in the word lord we pray that the anointing of the holy spirit would come upon each one of us lord that we would lord receive from you this morning keep your hand on us lord we we need you every every hour every moment so we're looking to you this morning we ask in jesus name amen amen god bless you i'm going to be speaking on serpent seed um looking at the two seeds in genesis 3 15 and if you have the you have the powerpoint brother it should be in the email so we have a just to set the scene we have a strange story in the book of genesis about trees that can give eternal life or or death about a talking snake see something that seems somewhat incongruous and unusual based on uh a thorough reading of the entire scripture so let's with that in mind we'll read our opening scripture and we'll go from there genesis 1 26 and 27. as they're pulling up the power point i'm just going to go ahead and read if you want to grab that in your bibles and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and verse 28 and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so here we see god setting the setting the vision of what he has for his creation now this is of course the pinnacle you got it thank you i don't have control over it so you're just going to have to follow along the pinnacle of his creation is when he created man and here we understand he created them in spirit form understanding that potentially they were all they were going to be in bodily form but when he says make that when they're going to come after his own image his own likeness we understand that's in spirit form okay and so when man was to replenish himself he was to replenish himself after his own kind genesis 1 11-12 so if you forward through that enough you'll get to that and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good this is god's principle of reproduction it's not just in trees and herbs of the garden it's in everything all life the seed is in itself and it's to come forth after it's kind so god made what did he what did he do he made something off of himself he made an offspring so if if he was god who is spirit he made a spirit being off of himself but even further than that what did he do he made someone with his nature right his characteristics they were man is supposed to be a reflection of god himself so when he says to multiply and replenish the earth god's vision isn't just multiply and replace punish human beings it's multiplying his own life on the earth all the other creation there's no there's no connection like this yes god god made them god has a purpose for all of them but only mankind did he say you're made in my image and likeness and being made in his image and likeness they have a special place a special purpose that was to reproduce god's own life little gods right little little elohim you know that sounds like a strange statement but if you understand you know to our modern way of thinking in theology to say man was made to be a little g.o.d first time i heard brother branham say it my brain went what coming from a background in theology but as you understand jewish history it's very clear that the term elohim doesn't only apply to yahweh there's lots of different orders of being that receive this title elohim even the angels themselves receive this title of elohim so them us us being made in his image would of course be an extension of him of his own life and we would be little gods perfectly scriptural so that was what just to reproduce in the earth we're going to keep this going so that the earth is filled up all the seed come forward and then god is all in all he's perfectly manifested on a perfect earth this is god's purpose and intention all right so but he said something there in genesis 2 verse 9 and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so let's let's let's comment on it this way scripture is to be taken literally okay we don't take a scripture and read it and say it's all figurative some scripture can be figurative and some and most scripture is literal how do we know the difference context the context tells us whether we take it literally or whether whether we take it figuratively and a huge thing to understand when we're looking at the book of genesis and a huge red flag is when people look at genesis as figurative and they take it and they say oh creation's not literal evolution is true and they'll take take it a million miles there wasn't a real adam and eve a literal adam and eve it's just a figure figurative for mankind and they go on and on and on and on about this dismissing the power and authority of scripture this is not our intent that wasn't brother branham's intent but we look at the scripture and i think it's very clear and easy to understand that this is allegorical for something it's not really clear without revelation what it is allegorical about but it's clear trees that are that are good for food we get that trees that are pleasant to the site that makes sense tree of life in the midst of the garden and tree of knowledge of good and evil what exactly would that be what kind of fruit would that produce why is it spoken of as being in the midst of the garden the other ones are pleasant to the site and good for food but this these ones are in the midst of the garden what does that mean what does that look like i'm not going to answer that right now i'm just sitting before you what is this what's what's happening here genesis 2 16-17 and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die it is it should be a very strange scripture it should make us stop and say what's going on i'm just saying of course i'm looking at everybody here you're message believers you probably most of you grew up in the message it's not strange to you but i'm trying to bring this out to somebody that may not have heard it before or help you to be able to present it in a way to people that have never heard it before but this should just it should just arrest us immediately and say wait a minute what's happening this seems more like a a movie or something or or ancient mythology then it seems like scripture scripture is so practical so real so about our lives what in the world is a tree a magical tree that can make you die or a magical tree that can give you eternal life so could it be figurative of course it could be figurative does the bible speak about them the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is there context in scripture that we could say ah the the authors of scripture also saw it as figurative absolutely next slide revelation 2 7 says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god this is jesus speaking his promise to the church and he says if you overcome i'll give you the tree of life and that tree of life is still in the midst of the paradise of god so where is it right so we understand the story of the fall god placed god placed a fence and an angel guarding the tree of life so that man wouldn't go to that tree of life and eat it and live where is it in turkey syria iraq israel is there a little literal place of real estate that we could know as the paradise of god that man does not have access to that if he went there an angel would a sword of an angel would crush you and stop you from going in no there's no literal place like that it's a it's a figure of speech what it what is what does it mean that he's going to give us to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god speaking of eternal life living in eternity in the new heaven and the new earth what was god's purpo again what happened what what literally happened you know we have the story we have the tree of life they didn't eat of the tree of life they ate of the tree of knowledge they fell they're blocked from going to eat of the tree of life in in in the garden of eden the paradise so what what actually happened they sinned and they separated themselves from god so what was earth supposed to be earth was supposed to be combined with heaven it was a place where god would dwell with man and live with man that's what adam and eve's experience was and they lost that fellowship that fellowship was broken by sin and so what is jesus saying here i'm going to give you to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god he's telling you it's going to be restored which we understand that's the whole purpose of history of redemption is he's going to redeem not only his people his elect but he's going to redeem this earth so you have a perfect people living on a perfect earth that's what jesus is saying he's not saying that there's going to be a little literal tree where we go pick literal fruits that are going to make us live for eternity he is the tree of life he is the one that we eat of and live so does it speak is the tree of life spoken in scripture figuratively 100 it is jesus uses it here figuratively so we can go back and look in genesis chapter two and chapter three and say this these tree these two trees are not literal trees they are figurative trees all right genesis 3 14 and 15 says and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed thy offspring and her offspring it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel we're going to come back and go over that in more detail but i want to look at the at um what the lord says to eve genesis 3 16 says unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and then i desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee so strange we have god saying in the beginning multiply and replenish the earth then he says don't eat of the tree of knowledge then he says there's two offspring that are going to have enmity with each other then he goes forward and tells the woman that you're the you're going to be your reproductive process is going to be under a curse so one of these things doesn't fit and we've proven already it's figurative it has to be figurative so what does it mean then is could it be connected together these things could the context of context of scripture inform us about what it means to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil yes yes it does so when when i say we believe scripture we're not making scripture into a bunch of figurative nonsense and we're dismissing the authority of scriptures what i'm saying is scripture interprets itself right scripture interprets itself and so if there's something that doesn't seem to fit you don't major on that and then minor on everything else if there's a broader context in the scripture then we have to look at that broader context and if there's something that doesn't seem to fit then we have to look at what doesn't fit in the context of the rest of scripture same thing that we do when you look at let us make man in our own image or matthew 28 19 father son and holy spirit we don't take one or two scriptures and reinterpret the rest of the bible we look at those scriptures and say amen i believe that that's the truth how do i understand this in the context of the rest of the bible so when we see a tree of knowledge of good and evil how do we understand that in the context of the rest of the bible well the rest of the bible tells us that god is going to multiply his image on the earth we know that the devil is already his enemy so the devil is going to come and fight that and block that how does he block that he's got to inject something that's not an offspring of god into that humanity something that's so close that there's the seed of the serpent and the egg of the woman could mingle together in order to stop the purpose of god on the earth but satan's so foolish to re to to miss the fact that he was playing right into god's purpose because there has to be something that's sinful sick polluted in order to experience the fullness of who god is all right now let's look at the serpent he wasn't a snake he became a snake but he wasn't starting a snake now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we meet we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as elohim knowing good and evil so looking at this verse i want to read to you what uh bible commentator adam clarke wrote in the late 1800s about the serpent he's so before we get to that place the word for serpent is the word nakhash and if you look in the scripture it's spoken of it's interpreted many different ways it's spoken of as brass it's spoken of as uh fetters or like what we would call handcuffs it's spoken of as an alligator hippopotamus many many different ways that the word nakhash is spoken of and so we understand that the context of scripture informs us what exactly a nakhash is it also can mean a snake but again the context of scripture informs us what it is otherwise you couldn't go from a a crocodile down to a brass fetters that doesn't make sense so obviously you you get you derive its meaning from scripture in the context so adam clark writes this that whatever one whatever this nakhash was he stood at the head of all inferior animals for wisdom and understanding i think you can go on to the next screen gideon and i'll have that there two that he walked erect for this is necessarily implied in his punishment on thy belly i.e on all fours shalt thou go three that he was endued with this gift of speech for a conversation is here related between him and the woman that he was out for that he was also endued next screen the with the gift of reason for we find him reasoning and disputing with eve five that these things were common to this creature the woman no doubt having often seen him walk erect talk and reason and therefore she testifies no kind of surprise when he accosts her in the language related in the texts and indeed from the manner in which this is introduced it appears to be only a part of a conversation that got that had passed between them on the occasion yea hath god said etc had this creature never been known to speak before his addressing the woman at this time and on this subject it could not have failed to excite her surprise and to have filled her with caution though from the purity and innocence of her nature she might have been incapable of being affected with fear so my goodness this is quite the profound statement that adam clarke is using let me break it down in really simple terms he said the serpent was upright on two feet he could speak and he could reason and this was normal this is what was experienced continually by both adam and eve that the serpent was able to do this wasn't a snake it was an upright creature that had similar capabilities to adam and eve only it wasn't made in the image and likeness of god apparently was made in the image of man so just as brother branham says in 1954 questions and answers number one and the serpent was not a reptile the curse made him a reptile he was just like a man he walked upright and he was with this woman out there and she committed this adultery and brought forth her first son which was cain the nature of his daddy all right i just have a few more minutes and i want to close on a good point because i'll have i'll have i'll continue this the next time so let's see go to the next screen and then the next one after that yeah so god's command to them is multiply and replenish the earth then god commands them not to eat of the tree of knowledge then god puts enmity between two genetic lines then god curses the birth process and puts eve's desire towards her husband so all of all of these things are clear obvious clues i i find it very interesting two things in the message that you share with people that elicit very emotional responses and that's the godhead and serpent seed and it's it's it's strange because uh i understand the trinity because it's like it's basically saying your whole world view is needs to be refined and that's a shock it was a shock for me serpent seed seems weird very weird it was weird to me the first time i heard it but as you examine scripture it becomes more and more obvious we haven't even covered a quarter of what i'm going to cover in the future but you see just from the beginning of the book of genesis and surrounding context a small surrounding context of scripture is quite obvious that the original sin produced two genetic seed lines he's going to put enmity between two seed lines then the story continues in genesis 4 5 and and on and the whole story what is the story up through verse chapter 10 basically it's two seed lines in enmity against each other from the very beginning cain kills abel if that's not a immediate clue you're not even reading and then continuing on it speaks of two different seed lines doing two very different things one's calling on the name of the lord and one is setting up their own kingdom and their own cities and their own their own vision of life right and then you come and you see these two seed lines mixed together and god says well this is this is not right i'm going to bring judgment upon it and start over again so um scripture is so beautiful and once you un can unlock the key of serpent seed you you really unlock many many things throughout the scripture so let's stand we're going to dismiss heavenly father we thank you for your word we thank you lord that you revealed it to us lord and in this day lord that you took a humble humble man of god lord and you you vindicated his ministry so clearly and then you brought these incredible truths to us lord lord truths that they are incredible they're they're they're amazing they're wonderful to feed on but it's truth that has actually changed our lives and is still changing our lives and ultimately is going to change our bodies lord just continue to unfold yourself to us make yourself more real to us bless the service lord the worship the preaching of the word may you be glorified may you be the center of our hearts and all things in jesus name amen god bless you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
