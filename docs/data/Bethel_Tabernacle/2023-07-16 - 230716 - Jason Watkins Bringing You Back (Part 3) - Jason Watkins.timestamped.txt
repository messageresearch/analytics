[41:18] got it say Amen
[41:21] what man is he that desireth life
[41:25] and loveth many days that he may see
[41:28] good
[41:30] that's a pretty good question
[41:31] keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips
[41:35] from speaking guile now he's he's
[41:37] answering the question all right start
[41:39] look at it again what man is he that
[41:41] desireth life and loveth many days that
[41:44] he may see good who all wants that
[41:46] all right here's how you do it keep thy
[41:49] tongue from evil and thy lips from
[41:52] speaking guile depart what else can you
[41:54] tell me David depart from Evil and do
[41:57] good seek peace that's a proactive word
[42:01] seek peace and pursue it see
[42:06] the eyes of the Lord are upon the
[42:09] righteous and his ears are open unto
[42:13] their cry there's an advantage you guys
[42:15] are being a friend of God
[42:17] the face of the Lord is against them
[42:20] that do evil to cut off the remembrance
[42:24] of them from the Earth
[42:27] father we thank you for your word today
[42:30] I pray now that you will help me Lord as
[42:33] I want very much to be able to deliver
[42:36] this third and final installment as it
[42:39] appears to me at present to be and I
[42:42] commit myself into your hands for
[42:44] service in Jesus name amen God bless you
[42:47] as you're seated
[42:49] I'm going to invite you as you're seated
[42:51] to turn with me to the Book of
[42:53] Revelation chapter 19.
[42:57] and you'll see that is going to be
[43:00] seemingly strange but you'll see how it
[43:02] all ties together in the end
[43:10] Revelation chapter 19 we're going to go
[43:13] verses 1 through 10.
[43:17] and after these things I heard a great
[43:20] voice of much people in heaven saying
[43:23] Alleluia salvation and glory and honor
[43:28] and power unto the Lord our God
[43:32] for true and righteous are his judgments
[43:35] for he hath judged the great which
[43:39] did corrupt the Earth with her
[43:40] fornication
[43:42] and hath of ended Avenged the blood of
[43:45] his servants at her hand and again they
[43:49] said Alleluia and her smoke rose up
[43:52] forever and ever
[43:55] and the Four and Twenty elders and the
[43:57] four beasts fell down and worshiped God
[44:00] that set on the throne saying amen
[44:04] Alleluia and a voice came from the
[44:09] throne um start again and uh and and a
[44:12] voice came out of the throne saying
[44:15] praise our God all ye his servants and
[44:20] ye that fear Him both small and great
[44:25] and I heard as it were the voice of a
[44:28] great multitude and as the voice of many
[44:31] Waters and as the voice of Mighty
[44:34] thundering saying Alleluia
[44:37] for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let
[44:41] us be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[44:45] him for the marriage of the Lamb has
[44:48] come
[44:49] and his wife hath made herself ready
[44:53] and to her was granted that she should
[44:55] be arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[44:59] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[45:02] of the Saints
[45:04] but he saith unto me and he saith unto
[45:06] me right blessed are they which are
[45:09] called unto the marriage supper of the
[45:13] Lamb
[45:14] and he saith unto me these are the true
[45:18] sayings of God
[45:19] and I fell at his feet to worship him
[45:22] and he said unto me see thou do it not I
[45:26] am thy fellow servant and of thy
[45:29] Brethren that have the testimony of
[45:31] Jesus worship God for the testimony of
[45:35] Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy
[45:40] beautiful reading and you'll notice here
[45:44] that
[45:45] this is the time when we talk about
[45:47] bringing you back
[45:49] you know this is the time of redemption
[45:51] of all things and you can look through
[45:55] the word of God and you will find
[45:58] especially in Revelation you know it's
[46:01] not the first time you hear a group of
[46:03] people gathered around in heaven
[46:05] screaming praises to God you you get
[46:08] that in numerous places all through the
[46:10] Book of Revelation they're all uh but
[46:13] but here is an expanded view because now
[46:16] we're we're at the end and everything is
[46:19] wrapping up and he's he's finally put
[46:22] down the Antichrist system he allowed it
[46:24] to battle all through you know those
[46:27] first three chapters cover the the the
[46:30] seven Church age history of the Church
[46:33] of the New Testament everything that
[46:36] happens to the church happens in those
[46:39] first three chapters don't ever lose
[46:43] sight of that I'll say that again
[46:45] everything that happens to the New
[46:48] Testament bride happens in those first
[46:51] three chapters now say well what's
[46:53] chapter four and a door is open in
[46:55] chapter five a closed book and a call
[46:57] for a worthy one you know you go off
[46:59] into six and seven and eight and nine
[47:01] you're going to pick up the seals and
[47:03] you're going to pick up all of these you
[47:04] know various things you're going to come
[47:06] into Revelation 10 and a mighty Angels
[47:08] descending with a rainbow over his head
[47:10] and a prophets on the earth and the
[47:12] bride John representing a bride say my
[47:15] goodness what's all of that and then you
[47:16] you find places at the beginning of
[47:18] chapter 11 you see her in chapter 12 you
[47:21] you see the battle that's been that's
[47:23] still raging you go all the way over you
[47:25] find the message in Revelation 18. come
[47:28] out of her my people you find you know
[47:31] all of these these places after those
[47:34] first three chapters but brother Branham
[47:37] shows us in Gabriel's instructions to
[47:39] Daniel that everything after chapter 3
[47:43] God is everything that he's going to do
[47:45] is in it to the Gentiles it's in
[47:48] chapters one two and three but now he's
[47:51] going to begin to ex to show the world
[47:53] how he pulled it off how he did it how
[47:56] he accomplished it and so that's why you
[47:59] know the the Book of Revelation can't be
[48:02] studied chronologically exactly it's
[48:04] it's it's very much crisscrossed and
[48:07] back and forth and you to you you'll be
[48:10] reading one place here in early chapters
[48:12] and it'll stop and you'll have to go
[48:14] four five six seven chapters over to to
[48:17] even understand how it carries on and
[48:19] finishes out and then drop back about
[48:21] Midway that'll explain both sides and I
[48:24] mean the whole thing you really have to
[48:26] study it carefully that's why you know
[48:28] the work that I'm I'm compiling right
[48:30] now though the work we finished some
[48:32] time ago on the entire Book of
[48:34] Revelation a verse by verse study well
[48:37] it's called the work of a thousand days
[48:39] it literally has taken that long to go
[48:41] through it verse by verse and we're
[48:43] compiling it now for people who would be
[48:45] interested we're trying to create a
[48:46] study guide as a as a companion study
[48:49] guide and uh we have podcasts planned
[48:52] and different things like that all right
[48:53] enough but but anyway
[48:55] I've said all that to say this you're
[48:58] finding yourself in a position where
[49:00] you've got the the the the full scope
[49:03] you've got all of God's family and
[49:05] everybody is hollering notice they're
[49:08] hollering Alleluia not Hallelujah
[49:11] All Through the Bible you find the term
[49:13] Hallelujah and only in Revelation 19 do
[49:17] you find uh A Difference A variation
[49:21] that instead of an H it's an a say oh
[49:23] it's just in Translation it's actually
[49:25] not just in Translation it's on purpose
[49:27] Dr Scofield picks that up brother
[49:30] Branham talks about that and and you'll
[49:32] find that that the reason that they're
[49:35] saying Alleluia is because now it's not
[49:40] just Lord you've been with us hallelujah
[49:42] you've helped us hallelujah you've been
[49:45] you've been among your people glory to
[49:47] God you've got us out of trouble here
[49:49] you've taken a sinner you know you've
[49:50] taken us in a Rapture and we got all and
[49:53] all of these things hallelujah
[49:54] hallelujah but now he has actually
[49:57] finally finally put down the Antichrist
[50:00] completely he has destroyed her and now
[50:04] everybody switches the word and it's
[50:06] Alleluia because you have vanquished our
[50:09] enemy forever
[50:13] there's such tremendous rejoicing over
[50:16] God's judgment because of all that has
[50:19] happened and and is happening uh to that
[50:22] system we we hate to see death and
[50:24] destruction the Lord takes the Lord
[50:26] doesn't even take pleasure in the death
[50:29] of a sinner who has reviled him the Lord
[50:31] doesn't take pleasure in that
[50:33] he gives every man and woman an
[50:35] opportunity nobody comes to this life
[50:37] without an opportunity a legit
[50:39] opportunity a valid not a facetious
[50:42] opportunity
[50:43] it's not that God entraps anyone and
[50:46] it's all fixed everybody according to
[50:49] the laws of election
[50:50] everybody gets a chance
[50:53] even Cain got a chance amen even Judas
[50:58] got a chance
[50:59] hold on Judas think about this son
[51:02] you're going to betray the son of man
[51:04] with a kiss there's no coming back from
[51:06] that Judas are you sure that's what you
[51:09] want to do Cain uh you're you're never
[51:13] going to get the revelation of your
[51:14] brother you're not ordained to that
[51:16] however if you'll just emulate his life
[51:18] and respect him and show respect I'll
[51:20] make a way for you too
[51:23] see so nobody can impugn God for if her
[51:26] injustice people march in the streets
[51:28] all the time for legitimate Injustice
[51:30] and not all of it legitimate but a lot
[51:32] of it is but there's going to be nobody
[51:34] crying foul at the Judgment bar because
[51:38] everybody's going to know because he's
[51:41] Discerning the secrets of their heart
[51:42] and putting it on a TV screen a
[51:45] stretched across the sky
[51:47] and nobody can cry foul or Injustice
[51:50] there and so it's not that that the
[51:54] people are rejoicing in death and
[51:56] destruction of people but they're I tell
[51:59] you I'm going to be very happy to see
[52:01] that system
[52:02] destroyed that system of antichrist that
[52:06] has plagued God's family oh hallelujah
[52:10] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and the
[52:13] and the beauty of it is we didn't go
[52:15] through it all but if you if you can't
[52:17] keep reading on down you we came down I
[52:19] think it was to verse 8. because it is
[52:22] this destruction of the Antichrist
[52:26] system and the marriage of the Lamb are
[52:30] joined together and now they're
[52:32] rejoicing Alleluia because the marriage
[52:34] of the Lamb has come God destroying the
[52:37] system is part of the marriage
[52:39] Hallelujah say I'm already being
[52:41] invisibly united you're right and he's
[52:43] already putting down the Antichrist
[52:46] system
[52:48] and the Rapture of the church and the
[52:51] tribulation ending in the oh my when we
[52:54] said come to that time Friends of the
[52:56] Millennium all is peace forever more
[53:00] Hallelujah and then after that the devil
[53:02] must be loosed for a little season and
[53:04] then finally even he's annihilated from
[53:06] that and all sin is completely gone out
[53:09] of existence oh my what a time I tell
[53:12] you something friends our future is
[53:13] bright
[53:16] don't ever underestimate what God has in
[53:20] stores Paul said for them that love him
[53:27] one man has said a rather famous man
[53:30] would surprised me he actually had a a
[53:34] number of wise sayings it's interesting
[53:37] because he almost single-handedly you
[53:40] know corrupted uh the the minds of men
[53:43] and especially women and even men
[53:45] through style and fashion was Versace
[53:48] but he had a way of looking at life that
[53:51] was notable
[53:52] and he makes this statement he says I am
[53:54] not interested in the past except as the
[53:58] road to the Future
[54:00] so in other words I'm not living in a
[54:02] rearview mirror
[54:04] you know because we all know we've got
[54:06] failures
[54:07] don't live in that
[54:09] come up out of that go forward rise up
[54:11] go forward say well this happened to me
[54:14] and that happened to me if you stay
[54:15] there and cry over it you'll die crying
[54:17] over
[54:18] Hallelujah don't let that you're you're
[54:20] a human building the image of God meant
[54:24] to soar in the heavenlies don't let the
[54:26] enemy say but I I got to learn from the
[54:29] past good that's a good usage of
[54:31] remembering the past we remember the
[54:34] lives of all these people and Paul said
[54:36] it's for our examples see so yes learn
[54:40] from the past but don't get stuck there
[54:42] human beings are so notorious for
[54:45] getting stuck at events in their past
[54:47] that are long ago past
[54:49] and they're just hung there and they
[54:51] can't move forward
[54:52] I'm gonna tell you something friends
[54:54] every every one of every every funeral
[54:57] we just preached a funeral of our
[54:58] wonderful little sister Zoe and and
[55:01] every one of them all the way going all
[55:03] the way back to a couple years ago when
[55:05] we had all those funerals in a row I'm
[55:07] here to tell you brother Caleb says to
[55:09] Joy you remember she's not behind you in
[55:11] the past she's ahead of you she has went
[55:14] ahead of you brother Eddie has went
[55:16] ahead of me he's not back there I'm not
[55:18] going to live back here he's he's gone
[55:20] ahead of me
[55:22] he just literally jumped me and now he's
[55:24] there and I oh my friends what an hour
[55:27] that we face
[55:30] don't live in the past
[55:33] go forward everything is forward
[55:38] what are you
[55:41] here's a good question we're talking
[55:42] about bringing you back what are you
[55:44] coming back to
[55:45] at the end of it all
[55:51] you know mentioning my dad I have such
[55:53] good memories we were such friends and
[55:55] we traveled and
[55:58] I mean by the time I was probably 17 or
[56:01] 18 I had already been in all 48 lower
[56:05] States I'd been on every U.S Interstate
[56:08] in the nation at least once
[56:11] say how in the world how did you travel
[56:13] that much well we worked together and uh
[56:16] you know I got my education I got
[56:18] driver's ed
[56:20] I started driver's ed at nine years old
[56:25] amen I was I was homeschooled to say I
[56:28] thought you went to public school oh I
[56:30] went there too but I was homeschooled
[56:32] and how to live and how to be a man how
[56:35] to be honest I had parents who taught me
[56:37] those things
[56:39] amen
[56:41] and I I can think back over all of those
[56:44] memories and
[56:46] for me they just bring a smile to me
[56:49] because I realize he's went ahead of me
[56:52] and I've already seen him on the other
[56:54] side the Lord showed me I went into a
[56:55] dream saw him waved at him he waved back
[56:58] I know he's there
[56:59] and and I I sat up in my bed it was so
[57:04] real I set up in my woke up in my bed
[57:05] sitting up waving
[57:09] and it was brother Eddie he was out at
[57:10] some distance I could tell it was him
[57:12] because of the way he weighed brother
[57:13] Eddie didn't do these
[57:16] it's fine for a sister but come on men
[57:18] put that hand up there
[57:21] Amen brother Eddie put that hand up he
[57:23] didn't he didn't play around brother Ed
[57:25] he's going to raise his hand he raised
[57:26] his hand
[57:28] and he did this like that stepped out of
[57:30] a forest that distance and I saw him and
[57:32] I thought it might be him and he went
[57:34] and I went
[57:38] Hallelujah
[57:40] I know I'll get over there and I'll say
[57:42] that was you wasn't it yep
[57:44] hahaha
[57:46] he was young
[57:50] but but you know I
[57:53] when I think about
[57:55] the his life really
[57:58] the only thing of that really mattered
[58:02] we had lots of good laughs and memories
[58:04] and brother Eddie loved to laugh and
[58:05] tell a joke and love to hear a good joke
[58:08] but he the things that he instilled
[58:11] about the love of God and the belief of
[58:14] this word and the unmovable absolutely
[58:19] Rock of Gibraltar faith in this message
[58:22] and its messenger have held me
[58:26] uh immovably held me
[58:29] and though I'm going to tell you those
[58:31] are the things that count
[58:34] those are the things that really matter
[58:36] you say did he make mistakes of course
[58:39] he did I know his mistakes he knew mine
[58:41] when I stood there at his bedside we
[58:43] didn't need to apologize to one another
[58:45] we didn't need to try to forget bygones
[58:48] we we could hold hands and say I'll meet
[58:50] you on the other side and he looked at
[58:53] me said however this turns out son it'll
[58:56] be fine
[58:57] that's the way he always says it'll be
[58:59] fine
[59:02] so it's it's what we do for Christ it's
[59:05] it's only it's only what you do
[59:09] with eternal value
[59:12] I really hope that's reaching you today
[59:19] what so what are you coming back to at
[59:21] the end of it all when you stand on that
[59:25] day to give an account of your life
[59:28] to The Giver of your life
[59:33] it's hard for young people to feel the
[59:35] impact of that
[59:37] I get it I was young
[59:40] and it's hard to when you're
[59:42] 1718 even in your 20s and even early
[59:46] married and raising kids it was still
[59:48] hard for me to grasp
[59:50] the importance of
[59:52] giving an account for your life
[59:55] to The Giver of your life when it's all
[59:57] over
[59:59] give me my PowerPoint Brothers
[1:00:02] hey man let's go ahead oh goodness
[1:00:05] let's go ahead and get started
[1:00:08] the bride triumphant
[1:00:11] bringing you back part three the bride
[1:00:13] triumphant
[1:00:16] this
[1:00:17] diagram picture whatever you want to
[1:00:19] call it I apologize that I couldn't get
[1:00:21] it bigger than that
[1:00:23] but it's called the blocks of weeks it's
[1:00:26] basically as you can see
[1:00:29] you know 52 weeks on each row so each
[1:00:33] row represents a year of your life
[1:00:37] and it goes all the way down to 90 years
[1:00:39] old there you can see here's 85 and it
[1:00:42] goes on down to 90. there's your life
[1:00:47] if you live to 90
[1:00:49] . if you actually make it to 90 your
[1:00:53] life is just one set of blocks on a
[1:00:55] screen
[1:00:58] so now I'm hoping
[1:01:00] we can all but especially young people
[1:01:02] can get an idea of
[1:01:05] whether your life is short or long
[1:01:08] here's the key it's limited
[1:01:11] fixed
[1:01:13] all right that's that's the big point
[1:01:19] a 90-year human life in months each row
[1:01:22] is 36 months which so each row equals
[1:01:26] three years
[1:01:27] so you can see where you start at Birth
[1:01:29] you get about where the second one is
[1:01:31] there's your 30th birthday now right
[1:01:34] there is where I am I'll be 60 in August
[1:01:36] and here's turning 90 right down here in
[1:01:39] the bottom corner our church matriarch
[1:01:41] sister Gene
[1:01:43] she would be I guess uh
[1:01:45] somewhere somewhere back in right along
[1:01:47] in here
[1:01:48] hey man I hope she lives to be 190.
[1:01:51] but I hope I hope we're all on the other
[1:01:53] side by then she will live to be 190.
[1:01:57] she'll live to be a thousand at least
[1:01:59] while they measure time
[1:02:01] don't forget the Millennium is not
[1:02:04] eternity the millennium's still in kind
[1:02:05] it's a thousand years so I will still be
[1:02:09] alive in the 24th century
[1:02:12] you will see the 27th century you will
[1:02:14] be alive
[1:02:16] in the 28th Century you will be see

[1:04:44] and I saw a clip of his interview and
[1:04:46] they're saying because it hit the
[1:04:48] headlines because in the in the in the
[1:04:51] scene whatever the movie was he broke
[1:04:53] down crying for real he was supposed to
[1:04:55] cry it was in the script but he actually
[1:04:57] broke down for real
[1:04:58] and they said wow that was that that
[1:05:01] something hit you he goes it did
[1:05:03] and they said you know his his line that
[1:05:06] made him break down was he's that he's
[1:05:08] in a conversation with another friend
[1:05:10] who's old
[1:05:11] and he says you know I've arrived at
[1:05:13] this age Without Really knowing how I

[1:09:20] wisely
[1:09:22] see
[1:09:24] I I use this just just to try to help
[1:09:27] especially the young people get some
[1:09:29] perspective
[1:09:31] that life is limited
[1:09:38] brother Ernie used to always say
[1:09:40] remember brother any Villanueva but I
[1:09:42] gotta go faster
[1:09:43] but I don't want to go fast
[1:09:46] if I have to if I need a part for I will
[1:09:47] just sit with me okay you good
[1:09:51] brother Ernie Villanueva told me that he
[1:09:53] had a dream that affected him as a young
[1:09:55] man when he first came to the Lord
[1:09:57] and he it never left him the impact of
[1:10:00] it was on his life for until his life
[1:10:02] was over
[1:10:03] and he said I had a dream brother Jason
[1:10:05] one day I was standing at the Judgment
[1:10:07] bar off to the side watching
[1:10:10] and he says I was grateful that I didn't
[1:10:12] have to go in front of that judgment boy
[1:10:14] said I knew I'd pass from Death to life
[1:10:16] and he says I'm standing off watching
[1:10:18] the procession and every time someone
[1:10:21] stepped up man woman boy girl didn't
[1:10:24] matter whenever they stepped up
[1:10:26] he said the king spoke to them from his
[1:10:29] throne and he had only this question
[1:10:33] what did you do
[1:10:36] with the time you had
[1:10:39] when you knew I was coming
[1:10:44] and he said one by one they bowed their
[1:10:46] head and walked off
[1:10:48] no reply what did you do
[1:10:52] with the time you had
[1:10:54] when you knew I was coming
[1:10:59] that's a question that occupied brother
[1:11:01] Ernie's mind constantly
[1:11:03] what drove him to go around the world
[1:11:05] win souls to Christ into his dying day
[1:11:08] are there any probably one more souls to
[1:11:10] Christ than anybody I've ever met on a
[1:11:12] one-on-one not talking about preaching
[1:11:13] from the pulpit but one on one
[1:11:18] brother Branham says in the message
[1:11:20] things that are to be I love that title
[1:11:21] he said it means so much nowadays Church
[1:11:24] means so much to us to see ourselves
[1:11:26] positionally placed in Christ
[1:11:28] because he was getting old
[1:11:31] and he said as I see the sunset of My
[1:11:33] Life coming up
[1:11:34] and he said it means so much to see
[1:11:37] ourselves positionally placed in Jesus
[1:11:39] Christ now if we are those attributes of
[1:11:41] God we cannot live by Creeds we cannot
[1:11:44] live by denominationalism
[1:11:46] we must live by the word because the
[1:11:49] bride is part of the bridegroom like any
[1:11:51] wife is part of her husband and when a
[1:11:53] child of God when that predestinated and
[1:11:55] he says that's a bad word to use
[1:11:59] but it's when that predestinated it's a
[1:12:02] bad word to use but it's God's word here
[1:12:05] in the in God's Bible it is a Bible word
[1:12:08] the knowledge of God
[1:12:10] can predestinate and make everything
[1:12:13] work to his honor
[1:12:15] when that predestinated seed now watch
[1:12:18] this when that predestinated seed that
[1:12:21] was
[1:12:22] that that you was to be
[1:12:25] and God called you and that little Eagle
[1:12:29] of a seed in there did you know you had
[1:12:31] an eagle seed
[1:12:32] heard the word of God
[1:12:35] it would it will when that happens he
[1:12:37] said it will build word on top one word
[1:12:41] on top of the other on top of the other
[1:12:43] on top of the other it'll not mix with
[1:12:47] any Creed
[1:12:49] it'll be a vessel built from the from
[1:12:52] the ground up
[1:12:54] it'll be built by the word of God
[1:12:57] you know religious Creed
[1:13:00] it's it's interesting that you know the
[1:13:03] the real believer won't won't mix with
[1:13:05] that won't tolerate it won't mix with it
[1:13:08] we try to
[1:13:09] persuade people to come from it
[1:13:13] but you have to be careful friends
[1:13:15] because you know standing up and saying
[1:13:18] we're not done we're non-denominational
[1:13:21] look the devil doesn't mind you holding
[1:13:24] that sign up
[1:13:26] it doesn't bother him a bit see
[1:13:31] we know that there are far more
[1:13:34] implications even than religious Creed
[1:13:38] so it's not just about I mean I'm going
[1:13:40] to say sure I won't I won't you know go
[1:13:43] along with religious Creed I want the
[1:13:44] pure word the word only
[1:13:47] but but it's not but remember that the
[1:13:50] Bible says of itself it testifies of
[1:13:54] itself that that it teaches you that to
[1:13:59] know him is life not even know the word
[1:14:03] the Bible itself says that it's not to
[1:14:07] know the word
[1:14:08] but to know the author to know him is
[1:14:12] life it's not it's so fine we don't hold
[1:14:14] to religious Creed but what is it that
[1:14:17] you are holding to
[1:14:19] is it something that's really real and
[1:14:21] then it's even more than just religious
[1:14:23] Creed my what if it's political
[1:14:26] what if it is political
[1:14:28] the message has made
[1:14:31] made us Politically Incorrect decades
[1:14:33] ago
[1:14:35] get used to it long before it was
[1:14:37] Unthinkable and made people cringe
[1:14:41] the family of God is always in every era
[1:14:43] they've been politically incorrect
[1:14:45] because they don't go along with the
[1:14:47] times
[1:14:49] you know I I heard uh at brother Samuels
[1:14:52] meeting on Saturday Brother Ray made a
[1:14:53] statement he said you know young boys
[1:14:55] young girls how should you dress and
[1:14:57] conduct yourself he said it's super
[1:14:59] simple it's not hard he said whatever
[1:15:01] you see the world doing don't do that
[1:15:05] you see the world you see these women
[1:15:07] dressing the way they dress okay sister
[1:15:09] don't do that Brothers you see the way
[1:15:11] men are don't don't be like that see
[1:15:13] it's not hard it's not rocket science
[1:15:17] the message has certainly you know I
[1:15:19] remember to my regret to my regret I
[1:15:22] remember growing up and always trying to
[1:15:24] avoid making people cringe or feel
[1:15:26] awkward but I mean today to cringe is
[1:15:30] everywhere
[1:15:31] I mean you can't do anything without
[1:15:33] somebody cringing or feeling awkward I I
[1:15:37] wish I wouldn't have wasted so many of
[1:15:39] my weeks in hiding
[1:15:43] be brave
[1:15:45] I wish I wouldn't have wasted so many of
[1:15:47] my weeks in hiding
[1:15:50] I thought sister Debbie and I were
[1:15:52] talking about that eulogy that brother
[1:15:53] Caleb paid to his daughter and there was
[1:15:55] all of his brothers all those First
[1:15:57] Responders they they're almost as many
[1:15:59] of them as everybody else they'd come to
[1:16:01] support him to support a brother and
[1:16:03] show solidarity Caleb so brave bravest
[1:16:07] eulogy I've ever witnessed
[1:16:09] to have something so tragic that it goes
[1:16:13] off the scale and there he stood still
[1:16:16] through tears admitting I don't
[1:16:19] understand that but I know I know he
[1:16:21] loves you I know he's true and he he
[1:16:23] stood for the word
[1:16:24] unashamedly
[1:16:27] Hallelujah I thought what an impact
[1:16:29] should I be not talking about that
[1:16:30] brother Caleb what an impact
[1:16:33] that would have to have
[1:16:35] on all of those First Responders
[1:16:39] to see him stand there and glorify God
[1:16:41] in the most painful moment of his life
[1:16:44] it's just a joy with him in the family
[1:16:46] with him
[1:16:49] I wish I wouldn't have wasted sister
[1:16:51] Debbie made that comment he said Caleb
[1:16:52] is so unashamed everywhere he goes
[1:16:55] everywhere he preaches everywhere he
[1:16:56] talks on the street no more where he is
[1:16:58] he's unashamed of the gospel of Christ
[1:17:03] the world we live in today I say I wish
[1:17:06] I wouldn't have wasted so many weeks in
[1:17:08] hiding because the world we live in the
[1:17:11] world that our children are coming up in
[1:17:13] the world that our
[1:17:15] teenagers our young teenagers and even
[1:17:18] our older senior youth who are beginning
[1:17:21] their journey through life as adults you
[1:17:25] know in this world
[1:17:27] um
[1:17:28] where it's hardly you know whether it's
[1:17:31] right or or or normal or not just not
[1:17:36] insane
[1:17:39] that's the world we live in well you
[1:17:41] you're trying to find something normal
[1:17:45] you're actually straining and you have
[1:17:47] to look near and far just to find
[1:17:49] something not crazy
[1:17:52] that's the world our children and our
[1:17:54] teenagers and our senior youth are
[1:17:56] coming up in
[1:17:58] and Satan's pressure on us is always you
[1:18:01] know oh you need to follow the mob the
[1:18:04] crowd
[1:18:05] Satan's pressure it's a mob Satan's
[1:18:09] pressure on us is always to adjust our
[1:18:12] thinking
[1:18:15] to adjust our thinking
[1:18:18] I want to say this to you don't do it
[1:18:22] don't adjust your thinking
[1:18:24] he wants us to adjust our thinking on
[1:18:26] child raising
[1:18:28] he wants us to become more politically
[1:18:31] correct
[1:18:32] he wants us to be he wants us to be more
[1:18:37] politically correct on the difference
[1:18:39] between men and women and the positions
[1:18:42] they hold in God's economy
[1:18:45] God has it spelled out very clear
[1:18:49] there is no ambiguity in his word
[1:18:52] concerning the position of a man in the
[1:18:55] position of a woman and how to raise a
[1:18:57] child and how a marriage should operate
[1:18:59] and what a nuclear family should look
[1:19:02] like
[1:19:03] don't give in to that political garbage
[1:19:06] don't give in to that social agenda
[1:19:09] we're not hearing sound I don't give in
[1:19:11] the political correct I don't give any
[1:19:13] religious Creek good for you but what
[1:19:15] about all the rest of it you're living
[1:19:16] in a mad world and there's only one
[1:19:19] answer there's only one mind and that's
[1:19:21] the mind of Christ
[1:19:23] reject that nonsense
[1:19:26] they know nothing of how to raise
[1:19:28] children they know nothing of how to run
[1:19:30] a marriage they know nothing about those
[1:19:32] things they've gone insane
[1:19:36] and the Bible predicted they would
[1:19:39] it's only the bride of Christ I'm going
[1:19:41] to tell you something friends
[1:19:42] it's only the bride of Christ who has
[1:19:44] the mind of Christ
[1:19:47] these things apply to the believer
[1:19:50] don't just think they apply don't think
[1:19:52] I'm preaching to the world today I'm
[1:19:53] preaching to you
[1:19:55] actually I'm preaching more to you
[1:19:57] because you're the target
[1:19:59] you understand he Satan already has the
[1:20:02] herd obedience
[1:20:04] he already has heard obedience in the
[1:20:06] world and they're all following his his
[1:20:09] pied piping
[1:20:10] it's only the but remember it's the
[1:20:13] Bride of Jesus Christ that stops his
[1:20:15] Advance it's the bride that holds up the
[1:20:17] word and says you will not come any
[1:20:19] further than this not as long as I'm
[1:20:22] here on the earth I'll resist you
[1:20:25] and I'll Hold You from taking your ride
[1:20:27] on that fourth horse
[1:20:29] you can ride you can have at it when
[1:20:31] we're gone but while I've got kids here
[1:20:33] while I got grandkids here while I go to
[1:20:36] church here we're going to preach the
[1:20:37] unadulterated word of God
[1:20:40] we're going to compel you to believe it
[1:20:42] and compel you to follow it
[1:20:47] I'm happy to be in that group of God's
[1:20:50] elect I'm happy
[1:20:51] I'm a happy man in this position to
[1:20:54] uphold the word of God brother random
[1:20:55] says when that predestinated seed that
[1:20:57] was to that you was to be
[1:21:00] and God called you in that little Eagle
[1:21:02] of a seed I read this already
[1:21:04] there heard the word of God
[1:21:07] see it will build on top one word on top
[1:21:09] the other one on top the other one on
[1:21:11] top the other one
[1:21:13] so he he actually says that you should
[1:21:15] ask God
[1:21:18] yeah you want victory
[1:21:20] I'm gonna give you a magic formula
[1:21:23] I'm sorry Aladdin's formula won't work
[1:21:25] to open the treasure
[1:21:27] rooms of God
[1:21:29] you can say open sesame all you want it
[1:21:32] won't work
[1:21:33] there's no magic in incantation except
[1:21:36] the one you're about to hear that came
[1:21:37] from a prophet
[1:21:39] and he says ask God
[1:21:42] ask God to pile word on top of word on
[1:21:47] top of word on top of word until you
[1:21:49] become into the full stature of a son or
[1:21:53] a daughter of God hallelujah those are
[1:21:56] the magic words you need Lord power word
[1:21:58] on top of word on top of word push out
[1:22:02] all the world and the political and
[1:22:04] social nonsense
[1:22:07] but see that that's assuming you're a
[1:22:09] believer of the word which is
[1:22:11] and and we're not talking about mental
[1:22:14] acceptance as I've said to you before
[1:22:16] there's a vast difference between
[1:22:17] agreeing with true Doctrine and having a
[1:22:19] revelation of Jesus Christ made plain to
[1:22:22] you
[1:22:23] the big difference the difference to be
[1:22:26] noted see so so believing the word is
[1:22:29] receiving the word into your life
[1:22:30] otherwise it won't do you very much good
[1:22:33] to invoke those words even though
[1:22:35] they're Supernatural words
[1:22:37] although it was coined by an
[1:22:39] authoritative messenger sent from God
[1:22:41] himself won't do you any good
[1:22:44] even though I've read you the words of
[1:22:46] the signifying angel
[1:22:48] that you read in Revelation 1. a
[1:22:52] signifying angel
[1:22:53] a prophet from the future
[1:22:56] this is what John
[1:22:58] was was caught forward to the to the
[1:23:01] Lord's Day
[1:23:02] see
[1:23:04] and he was given this signifying Angel
[1:23:06] this Prophet from the future who was in
[1:23:10] fact as he was so much like the Jesus
[1:23:12] John knew that he kept falling down
[1:23:14] trying to worship Him
[1:23:16] see
[1:23:17] but a faithful prophet
[1:23:20] kept redirecting his worship back to God
[1:23:22] away from himself as any true Prophet
[1:23:25] would do
[1:23:26] see
[1:23:27] and so that's that's how true Prophet
[1:23:30] would so when you see in Revelation you
[1:23:32] know all through the 22 chapters
[1:23:35] of this you know that that this anointed
[1:23:38] tour guide was going to take John
[1:23:41] through of course John represented the
[1:23:42] bride you know John represented the
[1:23:45] bride who and and and because the Book
[1:23:48] of Revelation is the bride's book of the
[1:23:50] last day because it came back after all
[1:23:52] the apostles were gone that's why they
[1:23:53] don't quote from it it's the bride's
[1:23:55] book of the last day it had all the it
[1:23:57] showed all the history it told the
[1:24:00] future which would end up being the
[1:24:01] history it told the history before the
[1:24:03] history it happened
[1:24:05] and that includes a Last Day message
[1:24:07] coming to take the last day bride and
[1:24:10] perfect her and bring up all the
[1:24:12] Sleeping Saints
[1:24:14] amen
[1:24:15] so so it's uh it's John who represents a
[1:24:19] bride who would literally be those who
[1:24:21] are alive and remain at the very last
[1:24:24] stage and that it's to those who this
[1:24:27] mystery will be revealed to
[1:24:32] and in this case of course it's the word
[1:24:35] of God
[1:24:36] that does all your thinking
[1:24:38] and all you're doing
[1:24:42] does he
[1:24:44] does he have that position in your life
[1:24:48] that he does your thinking he does your
[1:24:51] doing
[1:24:52] he does your responding
[1:24:56] how do you respond to the word of God
[1:24:58] how are you responding to it today what
[1:24:59] thinking of Christ
[1:25:03] see the key
[1:25:05] is in seeing the true word of God
[1:25:11] is a person
[1:25:13] that's the key
[1:25:16] that's the real key to seeing that you
[1:25:19] know we're not we're not talking about
[1:25:20] mere Doctrine
[1:25:22] on the text of a page
[1:25:26] we're talking about a person of the word
[1:25:30] Christ revealed to you personally
[1:25:34] you know whether it's religious whether
[1:25:38] it's social whether it's
[1:25:41] political I mean what if it is social
[1:25:44] there's a social agenda are you willing
[1:25:46] to are you willing to stand out in
[1:25:49] Social unpopularity
[1:25:52] are you willing to get dislikes
[1:25:57] if if Zuck will ever release dislike
[1:26:00] icon are you willing to have dislikes
[1:26:03] I'd like to have a gazillion of them
[1:26:06] so you don't want people to like you
[1:26:07] know I want people to love me so I can
[1:26:08] win them to Christ but not at the
[1:26:10] expense of my faith
[1:26:14] not here to compromise with the devil I
[1:26:17] don't need an Armistice or a treaty with
[1:26:19] him I want him dead
[1:26:21] and I wonder I want it to start in me I
[1:26:23] want him out of my life and I want him
[1:26:25] out of your life
[1:26:26] Hallelujah
[1:26:28] so ask God I would say to you today if
[1:26:30] you see it as a person and not just as
[1:26:32] text if you see it as a person then ask
[1:26:35] him say pile word on top of word what
[1:26:38] are you saying Lord give me more of you
[1:26:39] more of you more of you more of you
[1:26:42] less of me
[1:26:44] say where do I start brother Jason we'll
[1:26:46] start with agreeing
[1:26:48] not right there and say Lord I'm no good
[1:26:51] but if you'll come into my life right
[1:26:53] now I promise I'll give you my whole
[1:26:54] heart my whole mind I can't live in the
[1:26:58] past I've made too many failures but
[1:26:59] I'll go forward
[1:27:01] Hallelujah
[1:27:04] he says God is able

[1:27:11] that Crave in our heart that we want to
[1:27:13] see something how many in here once more

[1:28:08] oh I gotta I gotta okay I'm gonna turn
[1:28:10] the corner for home all right
[1:28:14] it was unbelief in the
[1:28:16] in Genesis
[1:28:18] in the Garden of Eden
[1:28:20] that demonstrated its
[1:28:24] catastrophic effects
[1:28:28] and all they did was accept one
[1:28:31] little tiny three-letter word
[1:28:35] that was contrary to the original word
[1:28:39] the word not you shall not that's not
[1:28:42] what God Said in the day you eat you
[1:28:44] shall surely die and the serpent said
[1:28:47] You shall not surely die
[1:28:51] and one word I'm here to tell you
[1:28:53] something friends we must not
[1:28:57] underestimate this as a principle
[1:29:00] don't let the devil alter your thinking
[1:29:03] even one iota one jot one Tittle one
[1:29:07] mark one punctuation don't let him
[1:29:10] poison your mind with religious Creed
[1:29:14] political Creed social Creed I don't
[1:29:18] care who it is what it is in whatever
[1:29:20] form don't underestimate the power that
[1:29:23] Satan can get in your life
[1:29:25] by by looking at any word of God too
[1:29:29] lightly
[1:29:31] oh it doesn't matter it does oh it
[1:29:33] matters
[1:29:35] say well that's just an old book well it
[1:29:37] still matters well that's just a prophet
[1:29:39] well that's just brother Brandon's
[1:29:41] opinion you're going to go to hell
[1:29:42] thinking that
[1:29:44] you'll certainly go in the tribulation
[1:29:45] thinking that I promise you
[1:29:48] because that's the message that was sent
[1:29:51] to give us a body change how you gonna
[1:29:53] get it if you disbelieve it or water it
[1:29:55] down there is no such thing as message
[1:29:58] late
[1:29:59] [Applause]
[1:30:01] there's no such thing
[1:30:04] you don't move the ancient landmarks
[1:30:06] that's the pressure that's upon us I
[1:30:08] resist that pressure
[1:30:10] we stand on the ancient landmarks of the
[1:30:13] word of God
[1:30:15] and we're not moving for political
[1:30:17] agenda we're not moving don't let your
[1:30:19] mind get poisoned by those things
[1:30:23] nor should you underestimate what God's
[1:30:25] word when it's believed can do for you
[1:30:27] I'm here to tell you can deliver you it
[1:30:30] can heal you it can raise you up it can
[1:30:33] rebuild you it can bring you back
[1:30:36] Hallelujah
[1:30:38] to every say to what to everything God
[1:30:41] ever imagined for you to be
[1:30:43] he had a vision of you say today power
[1:30:46] word on top of word bring me back to
[1:30:48] that Vision that you had of me before
[1:30:50] the foundation of the world
[1:30:53] never underestimate God's desire
[1:30:56] the desire of his heart and what he
[1:30:58] wants to do for you
[1:31:00] and through you
[1:31:01] and what he wants to bring you to
[1:31:06] say can you tell me what it is I
[1:31:08] actually can
[1:31:09] it's the same vision he has for himself
[1:31:14] I mean that's why the all his vision was
[1:31:16] the kingdom that's why that's why kings
[1:31:19] in the Bible would say said to this one
[1:31:23] I'll give you to the half of my kingdom
[1:31:27] the king wasn't saying to Esther I will
[1:31:31] I'll split the kingdom 50 50.
[1:31:35] and we're going to need to have a you
[1:31:38] know a contract in case we get a divorce
[1:31:40] and we're going to start divvying up
[1:31:42] everything now
[1:31:43] 50 50 is the world's way
[1:31:46] yeah see
[1:31:47] it wasn't to half the kingdom wasn't
[1:31:50] didn't mean that that the king would
[1:31:52] Grant to the queen to the half of his
[1:31:54] kingdom meant that she would have all of
[1:31:57] it and he would have all of it and they
[1:32:00] would have all of it because they would
[1:32:03] become one
[1:32:05] and that's the real measure of this word
[1:32:08] that's why devils are afraid for you to
[1:32:11] get this in your heart today when you
[1:32:13] become one with the mind of God then
[1:32:15] every demon is subject to you and that's
[1:32:18] where Jesus said I have given you power
[1:32:20] over all the power of the enemy
[1:32:25] they asked Billy Paul one time said
[1:32:27] brother Billy why do we not see the kind
[1:32:29] of miracles on scale that were in your
[1:32:31] daddy's Ministry he said I'll tell you
[1:32:33] what the problem is he said the problem
[1:32:35] is that nobody lived as consecrated as
[1:32:38] my daddy
[1:32:39] here to taste something friends there's
[1:32:40] power in prayer there's power and
[1:32:43] dedication there's power and
[1:32:45] consecration I say Lord by a word on top
[1:32:48] of word on top of word bring me back to
[1:32:51] the vision you had of me
[1:32:55] Christ restores back to the original
[1:32:57] image in this age
[1:32:59] and whether it comes just before the
[1:33:02] body change or after the body change
[1:33:03] what difference does it make
[1:33:06] one of the day Prophet said we'll sit
[1:33:08] down
[1:33:09] under a tree on the other side and think
[1:33:11] about all the nonsense we worried about
[1:33:13] on this side so you'll sit down under a
[1:33:16] tree and just laugh
[1:33:18] first thought that'll go through your
[1:33:20] mind when you cross over glad a prophet
[1:33:23] could tell me that first thought that'll
[1:33:25] go through your mind when you cross over
[1:33:26] is why was I ever worried
[1:33:30] Hallelujah
[1:33:33] you understand friends that God is
[1:33:35] bringing you back to an image I should
[1:33:37] be done in 10 minutes don't run out the
[1:33:39] door I said that last time nine people
[1:33:41] went out
[1:33:43] give me 10 minutes
[1:33:46] stop running in and out
[1:33:48] don't do that young people teenagers
[1:33:50] don't do that
[1:33:52] don't run in and out
[1:33:54] go to the bathroom get a drink of water
[1:33:56] come in here and sit down
[1:33:58] stay here
[1:34:00] if you have to go out fine but my
[1:34:03] goodness sometimes that door looks like
[1:34:04] a looks like a herd of cattle going in
[1:34:06] and out
[1:34:09] say is that in your notes no but it's in
[1:34:11] my heart
[1:34:13] stop doing that it disrupts people
[1:34:15] around you disrupts the Holy Spirit it
[1:34:17] disrupts the flow of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:18] you're grown-ups I get a baby has to go
[1:34:20] out of course because they're a baby
[1:34:23] I get sometimes people on medication I
[1:34:25] get elderly people I understand that
[1:34:28] not saying you can never go out I've had
[1:34:30] to go out but I'm going to tell you
[1:34:31] something when I was raising kids they
[1:34:33] went before church and they didn't go
[1:34:35] again until after church unless I was
[1:34:37] convinced it was an emergency
[1:34:40] and they knew not to ask unless it was
[1:34:42] an emergency
[1:34:45] and being boys I could go in to stand
[1:34:47] behind them and make sure it was an
[1:34:48] emergency
[1:34:51] and if it wasn't oh
[1:34:56] [Laughter]
[1:34:58] I say that to loosen you up just a
[1:35:01] little bit
[1:35:03] but Moses built the Tabernacle
[1:35:06] I want you to catch this I'm just making
[1:35:08] my last couple of points I probably will
[1:35:11] just have to uh
[1:35:13] go over 10 minutes I'm going to try not
[1:35:16] to
[1:35:18] so Moses built the Tabernacle from a
[1:35:22] finished product in heaven
[1:35:25] the one he built on the Earth was a
[1:35:28] replica of the finished one God built in
[1:35:31] heaven
[1:35:33] and he told Moses make sure you make
[1:35:35] this one thy will be done in earth as it
[1:35:38] is in heaven
[1:35:40] thy will be done in this earth
[1:35:43] as it is in heaven
[1:35:46] the Tabernacle that he sees me as in
[1:35:48] heaven he's trying to get this one to
[1:35:50] look like that one
[1:35:52] that's what the Christian walk is all
[1:35:54] about it's not about you deciding what
[1:35:56] you will do and not do and what you'll
[1:35:58] believe and where you'll go and what is
[1:35:59] not about that it's about coming into it
[1:36:01] and it's already finished I'm here to
[1:36:03] tell you that Temple is our of you of
[1:36:05] that image is already there it's all you
[1:36:08] already have a representation
[1:36:11] just like the New Jerusalem we we find
[1:36:13] that Brethren shows it's already built
[1:36:15] the gates of gigantic Peril are already
[1:36:17] hinged and the ones who built it stand
[1:36:20] there and awe and and the only thing
[1:36:22] it's waiting is for its Believers and
[1:36:24] it's redeemed and it's family to throng
[1:36:26] its streets I'm here to tell you he's
[1:36:28] able to get you finished because your
[1:36:31] representation is already finished say
[1:36:34] why is he doing this in my life and why
[1:36:35] is he doing that and why won't he Grant
[1:36:37] this to me why won't he give me that
[1:36:38] give me that because he's looking at a
[1:36:40] blueprint
[1:36:42] and he's trying to bring you back to
[1:36:45] that image
[1:36:48] so your buildings this is why you're
[1:36:50] Building Supplies come down from above
[1:36:52] we preached almost some time ago
[1:36:54] he all good things come down from above
[1:36:56] the father of light so it's good it's
[1:36:58] good material he's just trying to get
[1:37:01] you to choose it
[1:37:03] choose to accept could I say this in my
[1:37:06] closing statements
[1:37:07] please
[1:37:09] start
[1:37:10] choosing to accept his better idea
[1:37:15] for you
[1:37:19] it's all good everything that comes down
[1:37:22] from God
[1:37:24] it's all good
[1:37:26] no matter what it looks like now
[1:37:30] that's why I read Psalms 34 what man is
[1:37:33] it that desireth life and loveth many
[1:37:35] days that he may see good it's the man
[1:37:38] who will depart from Evil and seek peace
[1:37:40] and pursue it and and and and watch over
[1:37:43] his tongue and watch over his lips and
[1:37:45] speak no guile
[1:37:47] so what is it you want out of life
[1:37:49] I realize when I hear famous people who
[1:37:52] are old and decrepit and they're about
[1:37:55] to die and they get asked the question
[1:37:57] what do you think about life after death
[1:37:59] oh I don't believe in life after death
[1:38:00] so what do you believe no this is it so
[1:38:03] how do you feel about that I'm mad as
[1:38:05] I'm mad as anything but they use the
[1:38:07] other word
[1:38:08] why because I you know I love my life
[1:38:11] and I like living and I don't want it I
[1:38:13] don't want it to end I'm so glad today
[1:38:16] that I can say my life won't end he that
[1:38:20] believes on the Lord will never die
[1:38:23] Hallelujah brother Branham said that
[1:38:26] Jesus was saying that I go and prepare a
[1:38:29] place that where I am you can be also
[1:38:31] he's saying to his disciples that life
[1:38:33] is not ended in death that that the next
[1:38:36] world is just a continuation of this
[1:38:39] same life
[1:38:40] hallelujah oh that's the life I want
[1:38:44] God gives us every opportunity he gives
[1:38:47] every opportunity Humanity to live in
[1:38:49] the Earth the way God made it
[1:38:52] I want to say this to you he's
[1:38:54] unchanging
[1:38:56] and maybe I could
[1:38:58] I'm looking at my last line on my notes
[1:39:00] you're okay
[1:39:02] looking right at it I got four four
[1:39:04] lines ahead of it
[1:39:05] he's unchanging
[1:39:09] he has a single vision
[1:39:12] to move you to perfection
[1:39:15] and let me just
[1:39:17] tell you he's unrelenting
[1:39:24] I'm sorry if I made that sound like some
[1:39:27] great promise
[1:39:29] I mean it as a warning
[1:39:31] he has a vision of you
[1:39:33] and he is unrelenting
[1:39:36] until you accept it
[1:39:40] perfection
[1:39:41] say well I I'm not sure that what he
[1:39:45] would think of as Perfection as what I
[1:39:47] would think of his view is so much
[1:39:50] higher than yours
[1:39:52] you're a fool to not trust him with your
[1:39:56] life
[1:39:57] say he can see over the next Mountain
[1:39:59] that I can't see he can see over all the
[1:40:01] mountains
[1:40:02] you can't see
[1:40:03] he can see beyond areas you can't even
[1:40:06] see the you can't even see the Galaxy
[1:40:08] you live in and it's one of the smallest
[1:40:11] and you're lit I was telling Sunday
[1:40:12] school class today Earth is a little
[1:40:15] constellation of planets on the outer
[1:40:17] ring of the Milky Way we're not even in
[1:40:18] the center
[1:40:20] we're like way away in fact is that if
[1:40:23] you were NASA says that if you were to
[1:40:25] saw this the other day NASA says if you
[1:40:27] actually this made me think about the
[1:40:29] new you know in when the new city and
[1:40:32] there'll be no night there
[1:40:34] and and NASA knows that if we were in
[1:40:37] the middle of the Galaxy
[1:40:39] he said when you look up at this is an
[1:40:42] astrophysicist he said when you look up
[1:40:43] at the sky
[1:40:45] you can see maybe three maybe four
[1:40:46] thousand stars
[1:40:49] he said if you lived in the center of
[1:40:51] your own little Milky Way
[1:40:53] he said you would see hundreds of
[1:40:56] thousands of stars and they would be so
[1:40:59] bright that there wouldn't be night it
[1:41:01] would be always day
[1:41:05] Hallelujah there's more stars in the in
[1:41:09] the universe than there are grains of
[1:41:12] sand on every beach in the entire world
[1:41:19] and it's ever expanding oh you wonder
[1:41:22] why I say our future is bright friends
[1:41:24] live for that
[1:41:26] and the Very God that created all of
[1:41:29] that and Earth is just a little pet a
[1:41:30] little speck and the god that spun all
[1:41:33] that has that waiting for you and I
[1:41:36] I would say his idea of me is much more
[1:41:39] perfect than my idea of me and his plans
[1:41:42] for my life would be much better if I
[1:41:44] just followed them
[1:41:48] sometimes I know that that they're
[1:41:50] working and moving in our lives in ways
[1:41:52] that I don't know maybe we would
[1:41:54] interpret as Troublesome maybe sad or
[1:41:57] maybe difficult but I really think that
[1:42:00] a lot of times that those kinds of
[1:42:01] things that that are troubled in our
[1:42:03] lives and difficult you know we're
[1:42:05] talked about we're told not even
[1:42:07] thinking that fiery trials I'm telling
[1:42:09] you what a lot of times I find it is
[1:42:12] is God seeing a vision of you and
[1:42:14] looking at you in real time and saying
[1:42:17] I'm going to have to tear that loose
[1:42:19] from him
[1:42:20] he's not going to lay it down she just
[1:42:22] won't lay that down I'm going to rip it
[1:42:24] and it ain't gonna feel good
[1:42:26] I'm going to tell you something friends
[1:42:27] he's unclogging us
[1:42:30] that's what he's doing the the purpose
[1:42:32] the purpose is flow the purpose is so
[1:42:35] that you can walk around on this Earth
[1:42:37] and be a conduit to him that that you
[1:42:40] are literally the word of God made flesh
