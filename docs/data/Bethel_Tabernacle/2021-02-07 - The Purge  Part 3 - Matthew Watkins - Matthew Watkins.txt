do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] if you have your bible this morning amen daniel chapter nine the pre-service music still playing guys if you all wanna kill that amen you love him this morning daniel chapter 9 and we just want to begin reading here at verse 27 amen verse 27 daniel chapter 9 verse 27 and he shall confirm the covenant for many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease and for the over spreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate matthew chapter 24 just one more scripture and i'll have you be seated i want to reference where jesus references daniel 9 matthew chapter 24 and one verse verse 15 when you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place who so readeth let him understand you can be seated this morning i'd like to continue on with the topic we've had we've titled the purge i think this is i forget what part it would it is you'd have to look at it and i'd like to come to some of what the prophet of god says and brothers i did send you you will have to go back and find it it's i didn't send it today but it's the covenant should be called the covenant broken it's a document you could just display that whenever you get that up that's fine i'd like to to us to go into some of the things that we've been going through things that the prophet said about tribulation and about the end time and i believe it's a good topic right now to discuss on a lot of people's minds and so i'd like to just look at this maybe fresh one time as i heard it said to me that this covenant that is spoken of the book of daniel has already passed us and that we are the same brother believe that we are uh currently in the tribulation right now and that it's already taken place and so um it's shocking that some people can believe that but you know you're you're you all of us we would we would look at something like that and maybe ridicule it and think how could someone believe that well don't forget you're we're all susceptible to believe things that aren't true and we're all susceptible for our mind uh to to go off and down rabbit trails that god never intended us intended for us to uh romans 9 chapter romans chapter 9 verse 27 if you want to hold that in your bible just keep that open there so it's spoken he says and he shall confirm do you have did you did you guys find that good if you want to display that and just bring it over that'd be good i want you to read what brother branham says here when you ask that question you know when we speak of and you've heard it i'm sure many times mentioned the covenant that's going to be broken uh you know between the catholic church and the jews and we've it's been discussed over coffee and many times in in in fellowship settings and even over the pulpit and so let's just bring some clarity to it here this morning so that you can uh have something that that you are established upon truth so we put up first what is it and we read the scripture there in daniel 9 and he shall confirm the covenant i have highlighted in green the important pertinent things that would connect to other verses in the bible and so he says he shall confirm the covenant for with uh with many for one week and in the midst of the week the middle of the week calls the sacrifice and oblation to cease over spreading of abominations he shall make it desolate so what is this covenant notice what brother branham says here he says notice and i hope you could see that in the blue there yep notice in the last one half of daniel's week the people makes a covenant this prince makes a covenant with rome makes a covenant with them no doubt for the wealth for catholic and jews hold the wealth of the world that's in 63 in the first seal a few sentences later brother branham says this and after the church is taken away rome and the jews will make a covenant with one another the bible said that they would with the holy people and now notice they'll make it because why this nation is going to be busted and the rest of the world that's on the gold standard is busted you know that if we are living off the taxes due bills for 40 years from now he says if we are living all the taxes due bills for 40 years from now where are we at there is only one thing can happen that's to call in the currency and pay off the bonds and we can't do it wall street owns them and wall street is controlled by the jews the rest of it is in the vatican and the jews has got the rest of it in wall street with the commerce of the world we can't call it in now i want you to remember as you're reading these read the first go scroll back up i'm sorry uh down to the keep going down down down this one right there notice the first words and after the church is taken and after the church is taken so we have to remember context is key timeline is really key because when does this take place after the church is taken does that mean there's things that can lead up that you start to see a foreshadowing of it absolutely you can but to assert that it's already taken place then then we have missed the coming of the lord because this happens after the church is taken you're following he says and then there's only one thing to do the catholic church let me make sure this is where i want to read yes and he says and then there's only one thing to do the catholic church can pay it off she's the only one who's got the money and she can do it and she will do it and in doing this to get it she'll compromise with the jews to make a covenant and when she makes this covenant with the jews now remember i'm taking this from the scripture and now when she does this and makes this covenant we notice in daniel 8 23 and 25 he will cause craft to prosper and craft is manufacturing in his hand and he makes this covenant with the jews and in the midst of this three and a half years he breaks his covenant as soon as he gets the thing wrapped up and gets the money of the jews tied up and when he does that oh my oh my so i want to just point out here when you have this and you can get these this document from me i want to say also to those on the internet those who have emailed those in this church have asked me for a document i apologize i haven't sent it the reason is intentional um myself and brother jason amar's i haven't contributed yet uh to it but are working on an article that covers this entire topic of tribulation uh for the elected before the rapture and is there going to be persecution and tribulation and so we're authoring that now so i don't want to i don't want to send out anything until we have that done and then you have that final document there's been people quite a few have asked me for that so i just want to say when you have these uh scroll up if you could scroll up yep keep it right there so when you have these uh these comments that are so direct there is no absolutely no need for speculation right none amen now we like to speculate what if over coffee you know what about what brother brandon said here this is there's no need to speculate you have it right here directly the prophet of god saying this happens after the church is gone there's no room for speculation i want to make that emphatic you may say yeah brother matt we get the point but you you won't believe how many people don't get the point there's no room there's no need the bride brother branham said will already be gone not just spiritually physically she'll be out of here amen and so listen to what brother branham says about it this is so direct i don't this is this brother adam leaves no wiggle room here go down to the next quote and this prince in that time is to make a covenant with daniel's people which is the jews that's when the bride is taken out now she won't see it not only will she not experience it she won't even see it in other words we won't be here to watch this take place will we be here to see california i don't know will we be here to see this we've asked those questions many times here's what we could say about this we won't see it right so you say brother matt when does this covenant take place let's scroll down jeremiah 30 verse 7 alas for that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of jacob's trouble but he shall be saved out of it read the verse again it's very important for that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of jacob's trouble but he shall be saved out of it listen to what matthew chapter 24 now listen what he says here for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be that's the words of jesus referencing jeremiah 30 jacob's trouble amen he says the last of the day is great so that none is like it jesus picks it up in matthew 24 this is great tribulation such as not such as was not since the beginning of the world of this time no no no shall ever be so what's very evident when you read this that this takes place during jacob's trouble which is the great tribulation period this takes place during that time not before not after but during that time and so there's let me say this there's no salvation during this time there's none no no way to get saved at this point notice what he says here but he in verse in verse 7 he shall be saved out of it who is he not you not me he shall be saved jacob this is who he's pointing to jacob shall be saved out of it the jews will be saved out of it but we won't be here salvation at this point at this place that jesus is prophesying speaking of is already over for the gentile dispensation is finished and so you say brother matt what is the gentile dispensation that's what's happening right now that's what's been happening since the book of acts until the the fullness of the gentiles be come in what is the church ages it's the fullness of the gentiles that's why people who say we are out of the seventh church age don't realize they are saying we are out of the gentile dispensation because the seven church ages are the the gentile dispensation amen but he shall be saved out of it the he is jacob israel the bride the elected is clearly clearly not here during this time because why we have a type of joseph before he reveals himself to his brethren he he dismisses his his wife away he in fact the bible says he says let no man be in the room dismiss everybody so there's no one that's there that's pertinent to the story except his his brethren are you following that this morning genesis 45 verse 45 you can scroll i got it there then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried calls every man to go out from me and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brethren if you're here you've missed the rapture if you're here then you've missed the rapture because there is no more rap there is no the catch in a way has already happened for god's family so it's clear that this happens after the fullness of the gentiles otherwise known as the church ages i want to staple that in your minds because that's important when you study the church ages otherwise known as the fullness of the gentiles remember that the fullness of the gentiles otherwise known as the church ages because that's what it's speaking of when you read in your bible until the fullness of the gentiles be come in notice what brother branham says here in the in the church age book the ephesian church age thus scroll down guys scroll down uh uh go up go up i didn't know i had romans good there it is for i would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to israel until until junction until the blindness when will the jews eyes be open will we see that no we'll be out of here we'll be gone until the fullness of the gentiles be come in there's your stopping point thus the whole of the church is brother branham in the ephesian church thus the whole of the church ages is god the whole of it is god dealing with the gentiles and calling out a gentile bride to himself that makes the church ages and the fullness of the gentiles the one and the same thing wow exact same thing so what you can see uh and i think i have the chart there this is the chart and you can uh there it is there so what you can see very clearly from this chart draw my brother branham himself he draws this chart himself when he teaches daniel 70 weeks you can get a hold of this picture it's really good if you have it blown up and high-res and you can see it and so remember brother adam asked the lord before he preaches the daniel 70 weeks the brother branham asked the lord to guide him and he said i don't want to make a mistake you know hold guide me even when he drew this chart uh brother branham is going to preach this and the holy spirit gives him this inspiration to draw this before he preaches daniel 70 weeks and we're not really getting into daniel 70 weeks here this morning but notice what he says here the moment he starts the 70th week or seven years each week representing seven years the church is gone uh you have the chart you should have the quote above that maybe gideon yeah scroll zoom in right there to that so that they can see it real well the moment he starts the 70th week or seven years the church is gone now listen i'm quoting again recording so you won't forget this is what the holy spirit put upon my pen while i was writing and scroll down just so you can see that uh zoom in and scroll into that chart just for a minute so the bride isn't here during this time that's that's what's clear you can you zoom and blow that up blow it up blow it up more right there so can you see that real well notice how how you have at the top the raptured saints scroll down just a little bit getting more to the middle you have the seven church ages right there and then brother branham has lines put stopping points so they really you know i'll just say this with all due respect a lot of the speculation is just a lack of study a lot of the speculation people has just a lack of doing the harder work of going back and digging up and finding out for yourself what did the bible say and what did god's prophet give us clarity on that and when you don't do that and you take brother said and this sister said and this man said and i heard this preacher say you're going to end up in a either i don't i don't really know or sometimes we have fear and we stay away from these subjects because it's too complicated it's really not it's really not so it's clear brother and listen to what he says here you say the church has to go through the persecution we've read this many times a man who chooses a wife i have this down below a man who chooses wife don't put her through a lot of punishment he's already found grace to her has found grace with him so he says here in questions and answers let me rush through this real quick now in the last part the 70th week the last part of it will be during the time of tribulation period so it's clear that this happens during when is this covenant broken when does the when does the breaking of the covenant happen it's clear it happens during the 70th week of daniel which is the last week uh in and it's in the middle of the week he says now in the last part the 70th week the last part of it will be during the time of the tribulation period after big word after the rapture of the church then here is the three and a half years here that it will be confirmed to them again by the prophets see moses and elijah revelations chapter 11. so daniel 9 verse 27 we ran that we we read that earlier uh daniel 9 27 it's it's a reference and referring directly to a prince but not the messiah prince daniel 8 refers to the messiah prince this prince is the roman prince the the the catholic church so daniel 9 27 is referring directly to the prince from rome not the messiah prince he is the antichrist he's not christ he's the antichrist he's the opposite so the seven year covenant that the bible talks about is is the covenant the deal no matter if you want to read what brother adam talks about he talks about that deal brother matt talks about that agreement and that deal this is the self and same thing the covenant the deal the agreement the arrangement you say when is that i'm watching for that to take place then you're watching to miss the rapture because you won't see it take place could you see the leading up of that you absolutely can um and so in the first half of this 70th week the first half of that last week two prophets have a ministry right amen everybody going to get a pulse check here amen so during that last half of that 70th week two prophets have their ministry you'll find that in revelations chapter 11 and in the second half after that covenant is broken the antichrist will reign for 42 months and and and that's in revelations 13 if you want to if you want to read about that so during that time uh of persecution when the antichrist is reigning there will be martyrs jewish martyrs not christian martyrs not believers but jewish martyrs who will have to give their life uh to seal their testimony and as a fulfillment of the second part of the even what brother adam refers to if you go and study the fifth seal and so brother branham says this in the 70th week of daniel well god did with the well god did with the jews just exactly what he said he would do in them 69 years it was 483 years but 69 weeks and one week left one week is yet determined gabriel's instructions to daniel and the antichrist will make a covenant for them last seven weeks and in the middle of it in the midst of it he'll break that covenant turn them into catholicism the abomination will spread over the whole thing like that and then the end shall be the end of all in of all time and so brother madam carries that same exact thought in the fifth seal and you're going to see this right here also now watch they have to be martyred by the antichrist we just come through and notice in his last ride where he breaks his covenant when he breaks that covenant with them jews down there and there she's gone now we have a lot more i'm not going to read this last quote just to save time but what's very clear to me when you read this is that this has not happened yet this has not happened yet in any way in any shape in any form you say how do you know that brother matt because salvation is still here mercy is still here the holy ghost is still here are you glad for that it's mercy i love how brother tim pruitt says it is mercy over mercy no mercy no mercy's still here it's amazing and i'll just take my last five minutes here just to say this it's amazing how quickly if we're not careful i'm gonna need more than five minutes but i'm the song leader today so just give me grace just for a couple minutes um it's amazing because conspiracy and you you've you we live in such an age you can mute that we live in such an age of conspiracy and you know you've talked to i'm sure you know you've had someone even me myself have looked at things and someone has sent you something in an email or document or text and you've got to watch this and you know you've got to see this and all the proofs out there and they give you all the links to all the websites that it that proves the conspiracy and uh and you know conspiracy theories let me let me just say have have been around forever been around forever it's not the inner the age of the internet has exasperated them uh but they've been around for for millennia for ages conspiracy has in fact conspiracy is very real the theory is that you believe something that you can't prove necessarily but you connect dots and so conspiracy theories have been given have been put on steroids especially in this generation of research and google and google has helped that with their own algorithms if you watch a very good documentary that brother jason demar sent me called the social dilemma and if you haven't seen that i'd recommend it it's really good watch with your teenagers and your children especially but it talks about the engineering and how the algorithms specifically find what you believe you believe in the world trade center was an inside job they're going to give you everything they possibly can and results and advertisements to cultivate that not to disprove it but to cultivate it because they know that that's how you what you want to see so it's curating your news based upon algorithms of things that it thinks you want to read or want to uh want to study out and so there was a book a really good book i was studying actually this just this morning really good book called the death of expertise it's by a man an author named tom nichols and i'm just going to read a paragraph that he says he says conspiracy theories are a way for people to give context and meaning to events that frighten them without a coherent explanation for why terrible things happen to innocent people they would have to accept such occurrences as nothing more than the random cruelty either of an uncaring universe or an incomprehensible deity for many piecing together threads to form a narrative of blame brings a measure of comfort a place to locate our rage or find some kind of grand purpose even if nefarious for the brokenness of our world and so often times i've i've seen and you watch even things that brother branham said and things about i'm not gonna go into specific topics but we were if we're not careful we're more prone to this probably than anybody to believe there's some greater evil taking place and you say brother matt why is that because the world is evil and because there is a lot of evil that takes place and there is a lot of conspiracy theories that have proven out to be true and the bible is filled with conspiracy theories david cons had a conspiracy to kill a a woman's husband who he had had adultery with and so uh we we we can see this that there's evil in all humanity we know that and so we we look down and you say brother matt why is it why why is why why are people so susceptible to it one of the reasons is because conspiracy is we live in a world where it's possible where it's highly possible uh and and so there's many many way more conspiracy theories that have been debunked and disproven than have been true that's a fact there's been way more and there's been some very violent and destructive you say conspiracy theories are harmless that's not true go read the news go look at pizzagate where people almost got killed i don't think anyone died in that but where people almost got killed because of a conspiracy that someone had put out there on the news um about a about something with hillary clinton we won't even give it credit here today but they've been and so the the world uh the world the the world that we live in conspiracy is possible we re we just mentioned that that corruption and cover-ups are possible and probable in the world that we live in jesus was the re was was in the midst of a conspiracy to kill him to take up a murder plot against him so we know that that mischief and corruption and evil and secret plots of evil are very real but you notice that even today in our generation that we live all new there's been a total lack of trust and a complete loss of trust in in anything you read in the media from news and it doesn't matter what outlet it is and a lot of it is merited because news has been uh has been so tainted by the left liberal media that you almost don't believe anything and you say why are christians more susceptible to look at conspiracy because a lot of the left-leaning media has specifically targeted christians right come on this ain't taboo to talk about here today it's amongst all of us they've they've targeted uh christians and so if anybody's gonna be a little bit more susceptible to look into things and believe things um it would be it would be christians it's the all information there's a complete lack of trust and we've had political leaders that have been exposed for conspiracy and exposed for corruption constantly we have no lack all of our institutions that we have that we had trust in one day we've lost all trust in them and it's because of evil and corruption and i'm not protecting i'm not defending it i'm not saying you should have faith in it i don't have any faith in it whatsoever because i know that it's the it's the uh the it's the entire world the bible says has drank of her cup of of fornication and so there is no good outlet there is no uh balanced and fair media as they say there is no such a thing and so it's amazing because i was reading just some comments from this individual he was saying he said when i was a kid news basically claimed came in three forms curated every morning in our three chicago newspapers at night from anchors with with the big three news networks and news radio stations and if you wanted to find information about a specific person or place or thing you throw thumb through your copy of the official encyclopedia britannica or you drive to the library and look through periodicals on microfilm today we seek our own experts we can read the first few results in google which probably were paid advertisement yeah because the first few spots of google are paid not organic search they are paid search they are paid to give you when you type something to give them this first above everything else whether you realize that or not that's a fact and so we we let me just keep reading here which probably ended up so he says or scan articles posted by others on social media or rely on email newsletters or podcasts and so you know uh there was a senator famous senator senator ben sasse who speaks of this and he talks about just how corrosive of an impact this distrust has caused in the world and he says in the process we've obliterated the gatekeepers who helped to ensure that information was important and reliable we've erased the distinction between news and opinion my goodness that's absolutely the truth and we're losing the habits that could help us make calm considered decisions when it comes to consuming news were miles wide and an inch deep that was ben sasse really really good and so there's also as we said there's this constant uh you know and and if you're not careful conspiracy theory appeal to your own pride they appeal to your own human fallen pride because there's a pride within all of us that want to know everything or want to believe uh that we know everything and we have every answer and every question and we have all the information when we don't it's clear we don't right i don't think sometimes we're intellectually honest about our own intellectual deficiencies yeah we're not some people be honest with ourselves we don't have the humility to admit it sometimes that we're not experts in everything we're not i'm not i'm an expert in my field that i've tried to be as much of an expert as i possibly can to be a professional but there are certain things i would never pretend to tell a doctor who studied for years at a college and who has degrees in medicine and who has diagnosed patients and looked at cases after case after case it would be arrogant of me to suggest that i through a google search can now know more than he does about about that disease or that problem in my health does that mean that google hasn't helped a lot of people and no i'm not suggesting that at all but sometimes we need to be more intellectually honest and so conspiracy theories they appeal to vanity to pride and uh everyone's just got to be in the know and everyone wants to be in control and we want to have this the the answers the secrets that everybody you know wants and so we know what happened to to this you know to 9 11. we know what happened over here and you could name conspiracy after the conspiracy after conspiracy and and so what's amazing you say brother matt why is this important because i believe as a believer we live in what's true not what could be true not what's possibly true we live in what's true listen to philippians 4 8. the bible says paul says whatsoever is true and whatever is honorable think on these things you know what people when they come to me with a conspiracy theory and they oh did you see this and you watch this video and you watch how they pieced it all together here and all they've connected all the dots i just go yeah i mean maybe i don't know maybe and you know what after that moment i probably will never process that again in my mind amen but some people can become consumed by that believers can become consumed where it's all they look at and all they study and all they talk about is the next conspiracy taking place let me just give you what paul said whatsoever things are true there's a reason he said that what so there's a reason why paul said also uh and i'm trying to think of the word myths and fables and he says don't even give ear to endless genealogies and and myths and fables could there be a truth to them there could be but don't give your time to that it's corrosive to your mind it's corrosive to your own faith some of the most conspiratory people i've ever met are some of the most faithless people because conspiracy leads to a degradation of faith in anything wow and you don't you just get to the point to where you start questioning everything in your reality that's happened around you and even some uh you know who and sad it's really sad and i feel sorry for them some people who get in you know fantastical uh stories of of these you know conspiracy the and things that have happened that's it yes first timothy i had it here first timothy 1 4 talks about silly myths or fables uh in first timothy 1 4. if you want to write that down and so i read a a ed stezzer who's a professor at wheaton college and he has a they have a magazine called christian in the day he says when you share such fake news and conspiracy theories you are simply bearing false witness this is a sin and it's time to repent pretty strong and so you say brother matt what do we need we as believers more than anybody need wisdom we need wisdom over the information that we take in and we give out we don't have any time we really are over time i apologize let's stand to our feet i didn't really get get get time to do that justice and then maybe the next time we'll pick that up let's bow our heads lord thank you father for your word it's truths lord it's truth lord that we can hold on to that we could that can stabilize our lives lord in an unstable world we pray father that you would anchor it down into our hearts lord may you be in the worship the music the singing the ministering of your word we ask you to bless us now this morning in jesus name amen
