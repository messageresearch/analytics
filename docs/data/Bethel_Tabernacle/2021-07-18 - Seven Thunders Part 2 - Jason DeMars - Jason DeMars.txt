TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning everyone let's stand let's pray heavenly father we just come before you and ask you look take your word lord and speak it to our hearts i pray that you'd help me to get myself out of the way lord that you would speak to your people lord be glorified we ask these things in jesus name amen amen let's read that scripture exodus 24 16 and 17 and the glory of the lord abode upon mount sinai and the cloud covered it six days and the seventh day he called unto moses out of the midst of the cloud and the sight of the glory of the lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of israel may the lord have the blessing of the reading of his word he could be seated so if you recall the picture of the cloud that appeared in the mysterious cloud that appeared in the magazine it was february 28th and so we know that the the smiths brother george and sister rebecca did the research and found that brother branham was not there he was in houston february 28th he was not there in the arizona desert and so everyone went we're freaking out over here because there's a problem but the reality is there is no problem the reality is that brother branham did say it was a few days before and a few days after and if you follow along how brother branham talks he says a feud a few a few years ago it was 25 years ago so he he is a man that lives in different dimensions and time is somehow a little cloudy and murky to him so but he says a few days before a few days after well if we look at it with specificity think he was hunting march 7th okay so that is in our western way of looking at it that's seven days after the cloud appeared all right but that's not how days were counted in the bible if you remember jesus was to be three days and three nights the jewish mindset is even a part of the day counts as a full day and they called it three days and three nights you can look at that in the book of esther they spoke that way then they did in the way in the time of jesus so you count friday one saturday talking about jesus friday one saturday two sunday three that's three days in the jewish or middle eastern way of reckoning it's it's it's funny it's the same it's it's different in in the united states when you want to say you're on the first floor that's like the ground level right and the second floor that's the first level in you go overseas and it's like zero which is the ground level one first floor second floor and it goes like that we count it differently so i'm we're confused so then we go to the bible and read it that way and we're confused so here we see mount sinai god comes down on the mountain and six days he abides on the mountain and then on the seventh day he speaks to his servant all right but when he wants to come and bring the opening of the seven seals it isn't seven days it's actually eight days if you count from february 28th the way the jewish mind counts to march 7th it's eight days which makes perfect sense because this is this is forwarding us into a new dispensation no not an eighth church age it's putting us into that eternal word of god not it's the bride age but it's not an eighth age right it's into that new world that new life just how brother branham talks about in the heavenly heavenly home of the earthly bride right so we thank the lord for these things eight days later the cloud comes down eight days later god speaks to his servant showing there's something it's a new creation it's a it's a new phase of redemption for the bride it's not a confusion the world wants it to be confusion right the devil wants it to be confusion but to the bride it's a beautiful revelation let's look at the next slide i think i control it here uh let us want to look at some different quotes about the seven thunders i think the last time i did this was on a wednesday night and i just wanted to continue on now even even though this is sunday school but looking at the seven thunders and i mentioned it before that because of people's past history in the around the message there's like a ptsd that happens and it can be it can be any any topic it can be your pastor your husband spiritually speaking uh or i mean a number of things where people have been hurt and damaged by a certain thing in the message and because of that they sort of create a wall around that topic and it's like we just don't go there and it's a great danger because god has something there it's not like it's not like brother branham avoided the topic you know even when he says it's a mystery it won't be it won't be known until a later time absolutely but then he goes on to explain what that means and so it shouldn't be a taboo topic it's actually something that's supposed to raise our faith up higher not damage our faith damage the way we're looking at it if it damages our understanding then let it damage our understanding and and be corrected to look at it the way god looks at it and i think some of the times people are so scared this guy's talking about seven thunders he's bringing a new revelation uh not bringing a new revelation looking at what brother branham said and want to understand exactly what he said in the context of scripture and i'm not even bringing you something different than what your pastor's already preaching we're just looking and reviewing this topic so this is in super sign 1962 long before he preaches the seals what not a year but nine months i guess let us work lord for we know we haven't much more time to work we see time closing in soon we're looking for the angel that will set his foot on the land and on the sea and raise up his hand and swear by him that lives forever and ever time shall be no more said at that time the mystery of god should be finished we understand now father that's god's threefold mystery has been made known to us and we understand and we're looking now for those seven mysterious thunders that came out from heaven in the book of revelation that was sealed on the back side of the book so 1962 we're waiting and looking for the seven thunders so god had already placed something in his heart we're seeing what god is doing right now there must be a seven thunder mystery coming forth to be revealed you go on to the next one for me all right so standing in the gap this is a year later so after the seals have been broken and then we got over in the bible and showed that there would be a seventh angel's message and at the sounding of the seventh angel's message all the mysteries of god would be made known then come seven mysterious thunders all right let's keep going thunders are to bring us rapturing faith and then there's this is in the first seal and then there's coming forth seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all that's right and i believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it there's something we got to step farther we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we've got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and we swept up out of this earth and we'll find that after a while the lord willing find where it's written i like that it's not written at all and we're going to find where it's written sounds like you're talking in riddles yeah that's how god does all right you're not going to be able to read that bless your heart if you can and i remember when he swept down there in that big light standing yonder at the bottom of the river this is in this is in the morning before he preaches is this the sign of the answers so again this is the morning before that so he already has had the vision he knows what's coming so this is what he's speaking and i remember when he swept down there in that big light standing gander at the bottom of the river in 1933 in june when he said as john the baptist was sent forth and forerunned the first coming of christ i send you with the message to the world to forerun the second coming of christ and i want you to notice his language and around around the world she's went she who the message when revival fires had been built for 15 years on nearly every mountain divine healing across the nations and the power and restoration and now i believe she again she the message she is ready to strike that final climax yonder to bring forth a faith that will rapture the church into glory so in other words the message is going to go into a cl is going to reach a climax this is before he brings out is this the sign of the answers he knows what's coming he knows that he's going to get a revelation about the seven seals maybe doesn't know every detail about it at that point in time for sure he doesn't but he's saying some things i'm trying to let you know there's a final climax to what that's coming the message amen final climaxy honor to bring forth a faith that will rapture the church into glory and she is laying in the messages in other words a foundation is being put forward a foundation of messages that he's preaching is being put forward so that the climax can come and we're really at the end time we've talked about it and everything but the thing has moved upon us now yeah yes all right so revelation is only given to the elected bride of jesus christ luke 8 10-13 and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to others in parables riddles that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of god all right so we talked about that before in daniel chapter 12 it's verse 10. you can refer back to that it's it's important to understand that that in daniel 12 will you josh will you pull that up let's flip over to the scriptures and pull up daniel 12. and i'll just read from eight then through ten and i heard but i understood not then said i o my lord what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end so the understanding of the revelation is closed and sealed up until the time of the end then we see verse 10 many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand so there is what are they going to understand they're going to understand what was sealed to daniel in other words there's going to be an opening of the word amen in the end time and the wise will understand that opening of the word and the wicked will not understand the opening of the word but notice what's said before that many shall be purified and made white and tried you know you you you look at that series brother branham preach the seals he started it out god in simplicity what did he talk about in that sermon the bleach right the bleach that which purifies sends it just obliterates it sends it back to its original elements put that ink in in bleach it sends it back to its original elements it's destroyed it's demolished doesn't even exist anymore and so then then he goes and preaches on on the breach and he says this is the most sublime verses in the scripture talking about redemption there's a redemption that took place in 1963 because of the opening of those seals that didn't take place when he died at calvary that didn't take place when the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost he took jesus christ the one who was slain in 1963 took that book and broke the seals one by one and because of that what happened the full effects of the blood of christ could be upon us and then all the other ages it was imputed also to them they without us could not be made perfect why because the opening of the word has come broken that forth now it's the bleeding word look at what brother branham said in indictment when they rejected the passover lamb the paschal lamb when they rejected christ the passover lamb was not effective for them anymore now it was only to the blood of jesus christ now in this day they've crucified the word of god the son of god a second time as he's manifested before the people and they reject it and call it the works of the devil says they've crucified it again it goes from that blood to the word and the word alone amen so what does that mean the blood is not useless for us anymore well i don't think you can find not useful for any uh for us anymore you can't find that right in the message so what is he trying to say is that blood the effectiveness of the blood goes away from what it was before and goes into only what the word it's by the washing of water by the word bring that scripture up again many will be purified and made white and tried the wicked won't understand the wise will understand why do you think that those words are put together it's not a mistake it's not just random order many will be purified and made white and then what happens for them when they're purified and made white they receive a understanding a revelation of the open word that's the revealing of the open word let me back up and put that more clearly what washes them and makes them white the word what word the fully restored revealed word that was sealed away and hidden since the time of of daniel and before things that were hidden were not known amen were revealed in this day and through that revelation what happens to you and i we're purified made white and tried and what is it what is the difference what is the difference the wise understand the wicked don't understand oh it's all about intellect now no it's revelation it's a disclosure disclosure of what the word who's the word jesus christ so it's a revelation of jesus christ that cleanses and purifies the bride what did we read in 1st peter before we're waiting for what salvation ready to be revealed apocalypses unveiled in the last time amen this this what and what is that what it's the oh it's the seven thunders bringing forth the opening of the word what is that what is that it's the message it's the message what is what is that disclosure to us it's the message why do we need the message it's to bring to full fruition everything that jesus talked about and everything that paul talked about jesus prayed for oneness amongst his believers so god's answer was he sent a message to restore us back to the word and how do we get one with each other and with him amen by the word it's not it's not by politics it's not by unifying with each other first and foremost it's unifying with him all right let's go back to the powerpoint but if our gospel be hid it is let's go there next one yeah but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost if our gospel be hid what is the gospel what is the gospel is there seven gospels two gospels is there is there two ways three ways no jesus is the only way and who is jesus jesus is who he says he is he is as he has manifested manifested he says where i am there will my servant be also he doesn't say where my servant is i'll just follow him around wherever he goes no in other words as i manifest and declare myself my servant comes and follows me wherever i am right that's important we we want a jesus that we can just carry around in our pocket and say my jesus wouldn't do that who is your jesus i have no idea because he's not the jesus that's declared himself who is god who is god who who who should i say is sending me i am that i am i'm supposed to say that to them i i am that i am has sent me that sounds strange just say that i am i in other words it could almost be say i become i become who i become in other words i manifest myself and as i manifest myself you need to recognize that and put your faith in that that's the tricky part all through history man has said oh we like that other version of you in jeremiah's day they didn't know they didn't know nothing about god in jeremiah's day that's just their interpretation of who god is based on what they read in jeremiah's day but now we have john the baptist well i don't like john the baptist he's odd he's weird he doesn't do it like the rabbis and so forth he bothers me that's your problem that's not god's problem well i don't i don't like these disciples they're not what i would think of as educated men of god god doesn't care what you think well i don't i don't like this german monk stand up who does he think he has to tell all the dignitaries of the world that they're wrong in their understanding god sent him to do that i don't like this hillbilly from kentucky he has his grammar is terrible i don't i can't even hardly understand what he's saying yeah god don't care he doesn't care about your feelings or your thoughts he says i'm declaring myself in this day will you accept it will you receive it or will you turn your back on it that's that's a fact god vindicates who he is in each day and the children of god love it and rejoice in it and give thanks god places oh in every age what did he do what did he say about jesus they they stumbled at the stumbling stone oh that's not very nice we want a nicer god that doesn't make a stumbling stone in front of people go with the rest of the world and make up your own gods why do we want to do that man always wants to do that make his own nice comfortable god so that he can it can be easy and fine for him what is it it's god's of mental conceptions that people don't make a god of stone or gold or wood anymore they make a god after their own conception they've they've quote unquote evolved so something better well god is standing there i'm here i'm proving myself brother branham in the rapture message says god comes down from heaven and stands in front of groups of men and declares himself just as he ever did and they say could never be god that's up to you that's up to your choice but you're going to answer to that god who created the heavens and the earth and who manifests himself through his word and is faithful to his word it might not come the way that you think it should come that's what's that's why we need repentance because our thoughts are not the same as god's thoughts but if we repent and we turn to him we can receive what the mind of christ so our gospel is hid it's him hid to them that are lost so what do we need to declare to people the gospel what is the gospel the good news it's the death burial and resurrection of jesus christ absolutely and that he ascended too right we shouldn't stop at the death burial and resurrection he's not walking around on earth he ascended all right let's keep going then what did he do then he said at the right hand of god to make intercessions and then what did he do the holy ghost came back let's keep going we got to keep going got to keep moving well now i'm a catholic well here god sends martin luther oh no stop stop stop stop i'm done i'm good don't give me any more really why do you want to stop there because i mean i think you know what god did before is just fine you when you when you stop moving with god yeah you're left alone and god keeps moving so you fast forward then keep going you don't stay a lutheran when john wesley brings his message what happens then you're not following god does that mean they go to hell i mean probably it's not ultimately up to me but i want to know that i want to be found following the word in its fullness i don't want to follow something from a pastime a past age i want to follow them today then god sends a hillbilly and it confounds the world amen but yet if it's hid it's hid to who those that are lost so we preach what continuing the full word every day every age it's not that it's a new word it's not a new word it's pointing us back to the fullness of this word what they had in part in other ages we have in fullness today god's eagles of this day respond to that word they love it they're not stumbled by it they don't need a watered-down version they don't know we need a weaker version they want this strong meat well they're babies they're this i i get all that we should start our children and and help them learn the abcs we should continually be bringing in foundations to all of us because if the foundation gets destroyed we even if we have a foundation laid we should still maintain it right brother brad that we vacuum it right we clean it up if it gets a crack in it we fill it in we get somebody to come in and look at and say oh man well let's take care of that foundation why because we know everything else is is based upon that so we keep working on the foundation but we don't stop on the foundation we have to have the whole thing why because we're living in the age of what strong meat we're living in the age where god is calling a bride to perfection he's not calling us to be drinking milk in fact even in the first age paul paul was chastising the people and say you should be on strong meat by now instead you're just drinking milk milk is for babies so we need to be we need to be in the place where the foundation is there it's maintained but yet we know we've got to finish the building of this house amen and what what is the building of this house it's the full word we need to declare the full message that's when i when i first started working with iranians i thought well we just got to preach the gospel to them it's it's uh they don't know any they don't know anything better yeah of course we preach the gospel but why would you do that apart from the message you you you lay in serpent seed right away preach preach them about serpents he'd preach to them about the necessity of the blood being shed because of sin but then you don't stop there you've got to get him almost immediately to the opening of the word you don't leave that until two years later why because because that's the that's it's not the age for that it's not the time for that we're not living under billy graham's message we're not blinding the people in sodom we're living under something different it's an opening of the word that's to bring maturity i barely got even three or four slides there so let's stand up we'll continue next time i speak on seven thunders heavenly father we just come to you lord and we're so thankful for the word i pray that you just continue to lay it into our hearts father build our faith may it rise higher deeper in the things lord that you have for us in this day lord may we continue to feast on eagle food father commit each one to you lord we ask that you be glorified in the in the in the songs and the worship and and in the preaching of the word today lord may each one get themselves out of the way that you'd be glorified in jesus name amen amen god bless you
