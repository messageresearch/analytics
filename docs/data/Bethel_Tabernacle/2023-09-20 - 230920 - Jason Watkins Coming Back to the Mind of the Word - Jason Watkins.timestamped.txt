[32:20] and the singing and it was just
[32:22] wonderful I I was this afternoon
[32:25] almost feeling you know I don't know

[32:29] because the devil was battling me and
[32:33] the very thing I'm going to preach on
[32:34] tonight so there you go
[32:36] amen so um I I kind of caught that and I

[32:46] and I tell you it works like magic amen
[32:49] I just feel so eager to move into this
[32:52] lesson tonight I actually uh get to
[32:55] continue on in my family Series tonight
[32:57] I my plan was always as I announced to

[33:03] but scheduled it and allow for that this
[33:06] month so I'm just now getting to it amen
[33:09] praise the Lord I want to take the
[33:11] thought coming back I want you to catch
[33:13] I'm saying this because I'm going to
[33:15] tell you what I titled it
[33:16] what I decided to title it 51-49 then
[33:20] I'm going to give you the 49 that lost
[33:22] out
[33:23] but I decided to title it coming back to
[33:27] the mind of the word and I almost titled
[33:30] it don't change the default settings of
[33:34] the word
[33:35] [Laughter]
[33:37] I did too it was a little bit nerdy and
[33:41] that's kind of me but uh or geeky I
[33:43] guess I'm more geeky than I'm nerdy amen
[33:46] right right sweetheart amen but
[33:49] um the one coming back to the mind of
[33:52] the word that's how it struck me when
[33:53] the Lord reigned it out of the heavens
[33:55] on me a couple of days ago like to just
[33:58] report that we had a wonderful time at
[34:01] the meetings in Swansea and the Lord
[34:03] moved very mightily it was wonderful to
[34:06] see some familiar faces up there
[34:08] and uh but I also know you had a
[34:10] wonderful time here sister Debbie told
[34:12] me when I got home I said my I was
[34:13] feeling sorry for for the Mac because I
[34:15] I knew there was going to be a lot of
[34:17] people out of town I had a group of them
[34:19] up there with me brother JD and Sister
[34:22] Amy were still away Brother Brad and
[34:24] Sister Sarah hadn't got back yet and my
[34:26] wife said it you couldn't tell she said
[34:28] if it was thin said it felt like a camp
[34:30] meeting
[34:31] and I said wow let me jump online and
[34:33] hear that and so I did and um man right
[34:37] I've got right into the middle of it or
[34:39] not in the middle I was about a third of
[34:40] the way through and brother Matt called
[34:43] me and I said hey I can't talk I'm
[34:45] listening to a preacher
[34:49] and so then I got back to it again later
[34:52] on and he called me again and I said
[34:55] this is the second time you have
[34:56] interrupted me from hearing a really
[34:58] good sermon
[34:59] hey man so
[35:01] I really enjoyed it and I could hear you
[35:03] all rejoicing you can always hear
[35:05] Brother Luther but I could hear
[35:07] everybody rejoicing that was really
[35:09] amazing I know you had a good time and I
[35:11] can tell you we had a wonderful time up
[35:13] in the Columbia area with brother Benny
[35:15] Perry it's been years since I've kind of
[35:19] renewed an old acquaintance with brother
[35:20] Benny it really did my heart good number
[35:23] of preachers there representing the
[35:25] Columbia churches so we just had a grand
[35:27] grand time word amen uh Ephesians
[35:32] chapter 6 welcome home to Brother Brad
[35:35] and Sister Sarah amen I thank brother
[35:38] Jason and Sister Amy came in and then
[35:41] they got drugged back to the camp
[35:43] brother Matt and sister Rachel led a
[35:46] team of our of our team members and
[35:48] workers to go take a fresh tour to kind
[35:52] of get the logistics and everything with
[35:54] our Our Youth Camp is coming up rapidly
[35:58] amen and so they went uh to get a good
[36:01] jump on that and make sure we've got
[36:03] everything in preparation so
[36:06] perhaps I would imagine they're not
[36:08] going into the camp till dawn's early
[36:10] light so they're probably streaming
[36:12] tonight say God bless to all of them
[36:15] amen second I'm sorry I keep determined
[36:18] to go to Peter Ephesians chapter 6 verse
[36:22] 10. and here I am
[36:27] but I'm determined
[36:29] greed
[36:31] Ephesians first
[36:39] oh yeah here we go
[36:43] that's actually a plagiarism of Dale
[36:46] Smith I already say that one time it's
[36:47] funny hey Manny Ephesians 6
[36:51] 10 verse 10.
[36:56] amen finally my brethren
[37:00] be strong in the Lord oh here we go this
[37:03] is why I wanted to read this one first
[37:06] finally my brethren be strong in the
[37:09] Lord and in the power of His might don't
[37:11] forget we're working on our family
[37:13] Series tonight
[37:14] finally my brethren be strong in the
[37:17] Lord
[37:18] and in the power of His might
[37:21] so that's simply telling you that don't
[37:24] just have strength but use it
[37:28] don't don't be passively strong be
[37:31] actively strong here here's why see
[37:34] here's what you need to do put on the
[37:37] whole armor of God that you may be able
[37:40] to stand against The Wiles of the devil
[37:43] for we wrestle not against
[37:47] flesh and blood
[37:48] but against principalities against
[37:51] Powers against the rulers of the
[37:54] darkness of this world boy there is a
[37:57] lot of powers of darkness in this world
[37:59] Amen
[38:01] against spiritual wickedness in high
[38:04] places
[38:05] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[38:08] of God that you may be able to withstand
[38:12] in the evil day
[38:14] and having done all to stand
[38:19] and therefore having your loins gird
[38:22] about with truth and having on the
[38:25] breastplate of righteousness and your
[38:29] feet shod with the preparation of the
[38:32] gospel of peace this is a lot
[38:36] I mean this is a lot Paul is serious
[38:38] about this
[38:39] above all as if he hasn't already piled
[38:43] a bunch on you above all taking the
[38:46] shield of faith wherewith ye shall be
[38:49] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[38:52] the wicked don't think he ain't going to
[38:55] shoot a mansion my goodness this is this
[38:58] is how you survive that all right
[39:01] and and this is how you get victory
[39:04] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[39:07] sword I love this one and the sword of
[39:10] the spirit which is the word of God and
[39:14] he goes on there with praying always
[39:16] with prayer and supplication uh First
[39:18] Peter chapter 5.
[39:26] laughs First Peter chapter 5
[39:30] and I just want one quick verse here
[39:34] verse 8. first Peter 5
[39:38] and verse 8.
[39:40] be sober
[39:43] be vigilant
[39:44] because your adversary the devil
[39:47] as a roaring lion walketh about
[39:52] seeking whom he made devour
[39:55] I don't read anything and hear where he
[39:57] takes a vacation
[39:59] I don't read anything nothing I've read
[40:02] in Paul's warning advice and admonition
[40:06] and Peter's warning and advice and
[40:09] admonition suggests even remotely to me
[40:12] that you might get a break from this
[40:17] this is a constant Warfare amen let's
[40:22] pray
[40:23] father we thank you for your word
[40:25] tonight
[40:27] and I'm grateful to you for this
[40:29] opportunity to cover this lesson tonight

[40:35] personal way just I Lord we just I hate
[40:38] the devil I just be honest I hate him
[40:40] and I'm gonna really enjoy standing Lord
[40:44] and watching him kicked off into the
[40:47] Lake of Fire good riddance and goodbye
[40:50] forever and Lord I make no bones about
[40:53] that I want to see him destroyed I want
[40:56] to see the kingdom of God underway Lord
[40:59] oh my that's what we live for father now
[41:04] while we're here we need to be battle
[41:06] ready Lord because we are certainly
[41:09] going to be battle challenged father I
[41:12] we you've given us a word that is Battle
[41:16] tested and is proven Lord that it can
[41:19] bring victory that it can meet the
[41:21] challenge of the devil Anytime Anyplace
[41:24] under any condition or circumstance so
[41:28] I'm asking for your help tonight Lord
[41:30] that we might be instructed from your
[41:33] word in Jesus name amen God bless you as
[41:36] you're seated
[41:51] foreign
[41:58] the greatest battle ever fought
[42:03] brother Branham takes a theme of
[42:05] spiritual warfare
[42:08] between God's power
[42:11] and Satan's power
[42:14] and it's you know it's something that uh
[42:18] thank you brother Matthew it's something
[42:20] that
[42:21] the spirit of God felt very passionate
[42:24] about and brother Branham took quite a
[42:26] lengthy sermon you know to really come
[42:30] into this with both feet and he's he you
[42:33] know we've been working on the series uh
[42:37] in our men's uh prayer meeting I think
[42:39] we just recently finished it
[42:42] nearly six hours of teaching on the
[42:47] spoken word is the Original Seed
[42:49] and this is all similar in theme and
[42:52] brother Branham is working on how that
[42:56] we are to go about Warfare there is I
[42:59] want to First say this that this is a
[43:02] battle as brother Branham points out
[43:04] that there are only two Powers
[43:07] um and two kingdoms in this universe you
[43:11] have God's power of life and you have
[43:14] God's power of death now I'm going to
[43:17] give it the old Notre Dame try tonight
[43:19] to stay in a teaching mode
[43:21] um and we'll see how it goes my voice is
[43:23] a little bit raw and I'm trying to let
[43:25] it rest up first so I'll be back good
[43:27] for this weekend so it just works out
[43:30] perfect actually brother Branham I heard
[43:32] him saying the same thing in greatest
[43:34] battle he said I've just come in for
[43:36] meetings my voice is really you know
[43:38] hurting and he said so I just want to
[43:40] teach tonight but he didn't he didn't
[43:42] stay teaching and so I don't know how
[43:45] this would go but anyway we're gonna try
[43:48] I really want to and I want to watch my
[43:50] time very studiously so so I'm going to
[43:53] have to go very very quickly through
[43:55] these points to get to the real burden
[43:57] of my heart but these two Powers we find
[44:00] that this battle that we are facing is
[44:04] started in heaven brother Brandon that's
[44:06] one of the very first things behind the
[44:08] fact that there are two Powers uh God
[44:11] and the devil and one is life and one is
[44:15] death and they're both battling for
[44:17] control of God's kingdom Satan wants it
[44:21] uh and God's determined he ain't going
[44:23] to get it and so you know the battle
[44:25] starts in heaven of all places brother
[44:27] Branham emphasizes that it didn't start
[44:29] in the earth it started in heaven now I
[44:31] can't by any means I would love to take
[44:34] this over into Revelation 12 because
[44:36] that's really you know the the it's
[44:39] going to speak about the battle that
[44:41] started before uh Adam and Eve were even
[44:44] ever in the Earth or before there was an
[44:45] earth it spilled over into the Earth and
[44:49] brother Branham talks about makes a
[44:51] number of statements that you know in
[44:52] one place he says God and Satan decided
[44:55] uh to mutually agree upon a battlefield
[44:59] where are we going to fight and since
[45:02] the the the battle since the war was for
[45:06] the control of the kingdom and since the
[45:10] kingdom is God's family hello Kingdom
[45:14] see the Bible says that he hath made he
[45:17] hath made Revelation 1 6. he hath made
[45:20] us Kings and Priests see and so the
[45:24] oldest manuscripts say that he hath made
[45:27] us a kingdom
[45:29] see so we're a kingdom of Kings and
[45:32] Priests and might say a little bit more
[45:34] on at least on the priest aspect of it
[45:36] here in a moment but we find that
[45:39] brother Branham said the agreement was
[45:41] made that the Battleground for control
[45:44] of the Kingdom would be waged in the
[45:48] mind of mankind the mind of humanity so
[45:52] this is exactly why Satan can come and
[45:55] try to put a evil thought in your mind
[45:58] and make you feel like a hypocrite for
[46:01] thinking it but you know it you can't
[46:04] keep a bird from flying over your head
[46:06] but you can sure prevent him from
[46:08] building a nest on your head
[46:09] and so this is why we have to actively
[46:13] constantly cast down vain imaginations
[46:16] these are things that infect the spirit
[46:18] man that's where the mind is and we're
[46:20] not talking about your gray matter we're
[46:22] talking about the Mind as a man thinketh
[46:25] in his heart so is he say well I thought
[46:28] that's the soul remember friends the
[46:30] soul is the nature of the spirit
[46:33] all right it's a part of you you're born
[46:36] with a fallen nature thank God there's a
[46:38] gene of God that comes to life in the
[46:40] old Nature's annihilated and now your
[46:44] mind has a new nature to think about God
[46:47] and but we realize that it's uh it's
[46:50] it's in a no man's land where you it's
[46:54] it's a phenomenon really where you've
[46:57] literally got two different kind of
[46:58] people walking around in one body
[47:01] that's uh that's a paradox how that how
[47:04] is that even possible and we had to have
[47:06] a Prophet come and explain how Paul is
[47:09] breaking that down that you you know
[47:12] yours your spirit where your memory your
[47:15] reason your conscience your affection
[47:17] your imaginations are those along with
[47:20] your sight your senses all of that is
[47:24] all still in a fallen condition your
[47:26] imagination your conscience your memory
[47:28] your affection your reasoning but now
[47:31] you've got another inner voice you've
[47:33] got a new nature which is Zoe the life
[47:36] of God and now there's a battle before
[47:39] you're born again your battle is only
[47:42] with legalism
[47:44] you're you're living a legalistic life
[47:47] because you don't want to go to hell you
[47:49] don't want to miss the Rapture you know
[47:50] to do right you know it's God's word
[47:52] therefore you have a desire and you
[47:55] fight to do the right thing uh but but
[47:57] that is so exhausting and you know it's
[48:01] so much easier if you just go ahead and
[48:04] are willing to die and be born again and
[48:07] then you've got the inner the help of
[48:09] the Inner Man
[48:10] see you put him in the control tower but
[48:13] now that does bring really a greater
[48:16] battle in fact is it brings the greatest
[48:18] battle ever fought but it's a sum
[48:21] positive the summation is a is a net
[48:24] gain because you're because greater is
[48:27] he that's in you than he that's in the
[48:29] world so you're better off fighting the
[48:31] greatest battle with the new birth then
[48:34] a lesser battle without it
[48:37] makes sense
[48:38] so be you born again
[48:41] see and then even when we're born again
[48:44] then we have all of these admonitions to
[48:46] cast down vain imaginations let the mind
[48:49] which was in Christ let his thinking
[48:51] work through you think his thoughts
[48:53] agree to it uh not only agree that it's
[48:56] true but agree to act on it see
[49:00] so this is all what that whole sermon
[49:03] was about how that it started in heaven
[49:05] with Michael and his angels fighting
[49:07] against Lucifer and his angels and he's
[49:09] cast into the Earth and it fell on human
[49:11] beings and the Battleground now for this
[49:14] war is the human mind where decisions
[49:18] are made and so there's where you know
[49:22] you have to start out that's where a new
[49:24] birth starts you first in your mind you
[49:27] have to accept the word of God and and
[49:30] that's why brother Brandon would say see
[49:32] if he can just get that mind to agree
[49:34] with him then then it annihilates that
[49:38] old sinful nature because you're you're
[49:41] not you don't you want you refuse to
[49:43] reason the word you hear it and the Holy
[49:46] Spirit anoints you he helps you he comes
[49:50] upon you opens your under the eyes of
[49:52] your understanding and then you're like
[49:55] the men on the road to Emmaus you're
[49:57] begging him to stay
[50:00] amen you don't want to be without him
[50:03] anymore see and so that's that's how the
[50:06] pattern works and then God begins to
[50:08] grow in your life and so you know that
[50:12] that mind that accepts the word of God
[50:15] by faith but because you're a free moral
[50:19] agent and you have free moral agency you
[50:22] can
[50:23] refuse the word of God you can just say
[50:27] it ain't for me
[50:29] or you can say well that's a really nice
[50:32] idea and it would be a good lifestyle I
[50:36] think I'll go ahead and adopt some of
[50:38] the principles of the brother random
[50:40] called them the fine qualities of Jesus
[50:43] and now to our shock and dismay to those
[50:47] of us who are born again
[50:49] the overwhelming majority of the world
[50:52] choose the other thing
[50:54] we scratch our heads how can you do that
[50:57] if you only understood what a glorious
[50:59] thing it is to have God living in you if
[51:03] I could if I could just open my heart
[51:05] and my mind and put it in you and you
[51:07] could see for just a moment it's just
[51:09] like if you could go to heaven brother
[51:10] Brandon went there and he said I come
[51:12] back he said I could never be the same
[51:14] for if you're not born again tonight oh
[51:16] if I could just get you to taste it for
[51:18] a minute you'd never want to go back to
[51:21] fighting the Battle of legalism again
[51:26] as we said the
[51:28] the fine qualities of Jesus are just
[51:31] that they're very fine they are very
[51:33] good for life if there was no Heaven
[51:35] I've made this statement unequivocally
[51:37] if there was no heaven and no eternal
[51:39] life I would still live the life of a
[51:41] practicing Christian because it's safer
[51:43] it's healthier it's more blessed it's a
[51:47] better life uh and and I avoid all of
[51:51] the pitfalls that try to kill me and
[51:53] make me ill and disease me and Destroy
[51:56] and take my money and take my marriage
[51:58] and take my children I'd much rather I'd
[52:01] much rather live the life of a Christian
[52:03] and so so we find out that you know this
[52:06] is a tremendous war and so the enemy
[52:09] then so so we find that given if I'd say
[52:12] it like this given that the Holy Spirit
[52:15] directs you know his Prophet to identify
[52:20] the mind uh as the battlefield where
[52:24] spiritual warfare takes place and and we
[52:27] can see that God God's word I mean it's
[52:30] all through the scripture and then in
[52:31] this day God anoints the prophet to go
[52:33] back and pull it out to you again and
[52:35] call it the greatest
[52:39] the greatest battle
[52:41] so God's word obviously places a
[52:46] tremendous a tremendous importance and
[52:48] you can read it we're not going to go
[52:50] through all of the places we can read we
[52:52] might refer to them and we already
[52:53] referred to a number of them such as
[52:55] letting the mind was in Christ be and
[52:57] you let the word of God dwell in you
[52:58] richly cast down vain imaginations bring
[53:01] anything that's contrary to God's word
[53:03] subject to the word amen remember all of
[53:05] that add to your faith virtue add to
[53:07] your virtue knowledge add add add for
[53:10] these things being you and abound they
[53:11] make you that you shouldn't either be
[53:13] Barren nor unfruitful right they
[53:15] actually can get you to the point where
[53:16] you never fall
[53:18] I'll take that wow that's a deal
[53:24] but you got to fight and you got to put
[53:27] you got a strap on the armor and you got
[53:28] to use it
[53:30] you got to equip yourself and you're
[53:32] never you're so so you can imagine that
[53:35] the enemies
[53:36] strategy then since he can't confront
[53:40] you directly on the word
[53:43] because he knows you believe it
[53:45] he can't he just can't come at you and
[53:48] try to get you to doubt this because
[53:50] you're my whole confidence is in it
[53:53] so he knows that he's real crafty and
[53:55] he's real smart so his strategy is I re
[53:59] is to relentlessly attack your mind
[54:03] since he knows that's where the battle
[54:06] is and since he also knows you actually
[54:09] can't pray him out of there because it's
[54:12] his god-given right
[54:14] God this God agreed the Battleground
[54:16] would be the mind so you can't say Lord
[54:19] please make him stop putting bad
[54:21] thoughts in my mind I'm sorry you say
[54:24] the Lord will say I can't do that I've
[54:27] already made a deal with him that that's
[54:28] the Battleground well Lord what can I do
[54:30] about it put on Armor
[54:33] it's not rocket science strap up come on
[54:36] Amen
[54:38] and so you're going to fight so he he
[54:43] can't take the word directly he knows
[54:45] you believe it too strongly so he wages
[54:47] a constant Battle of of misdirection
[54:51] distraction and what I'm just going to
[54:54] call
[54:55] busyness
[54:57] see
[54:58] anything that he can do to keep you from
[55:02] putting on the whole armor or casting
[55:05] down or praying without ceasing or
[55:08] coming to the house of God or reading
[55:10] your Bible and praying anything he can
[55:12] do to get you to get in a world to where
[55:16] you're making bad decisions which only
[55:18] exacerbate a problem and give him a
[55:20] better opportunity like a vicious cycle
[55:22] and he gets you on a Merry-Go-Round of
[55:24] failure after failure after failure next
[55:26] thing you know you're laying face down
[55:28] in the ground and and and and and we we
[55:31] roll you over and we pick you up and say
[55:33] what happened and you know you don't
[55:34] even know
[55:36] I felt so spiritual Sunday
[55:39] wow how what happened to me
[55:42] thank God I got a Wednesday night I can
[55:44] kind of get in here and get cleaned
[55:45] often
[55:46] you know come on oh yeah I'm a Christian
[55:49] that's right you are
[55:52] so it's all about coming back
[55:56] to the mind of the word
[56:00] in everything that's a that's such an
[56:03] important Point how that Satan is just
[56:06] going to attack you that way so
[56:08] relentlessly again and again and again
[56:11] you know I I I I read an article and I
[56:15] just want to mention a couple of little
[56:17] things tonight I don't have time I'm not
[56:19] a news man I'm not here to give you a
[56:20] science lesson or a psychology lesson
[56:23] but
[56:24] I read on a couple of Articles recently
[56:26] I just want to make a one or two
[56:27] comments from them and I I read one
[56:31] article very recently about you know
[56:34] they they they had a group of people
[56:37] I forget the I don't know if it was Gen
[56:40] X or gen Z I don't remember which but I
[56:43] think it was gen Z and they were saying
[56:45] you know can you give us a list uh it's
[56:48] very recent you might have seen it
[56:50] yourself they wanted a list of what was
[56:53] normal
[56:54] 20 to 30 years ago but is not now
[57:00] what was normal 20 to 30 years ago but
[57:04] is no longer normal
[57:06] and there was a whole list of them I
[57:09] only picked out three that that were
[57:11] remarkable to me I had such an affinity
[57:13] with and one person says I remember as a
[57:17] kid
[57:17] 20 to 30 years ago it was normal as a
[57:21] kid staying outside literally all day
[57:25] foreign
[57:29] yourself so
[57:33] we were we were pretty much free to do
[57:37] as we wished yeah
[57:39] we didn't have cell phones
[57:42] and we're just expected to check in at
[57:44] least once
[57:46] I remember that and I remember not
[57:47] checking in and getting the what for
[57:49] from Sister Gene
[57:53] and so but but you know we we're
[57:56] expected to check in and it's amazing
[57:58] that parents could even allow that you
[58:00] know I wandered all over my neighborhood
[58:02] and other neighborhoods and got on my 10
[58:04] speed with my friends and would ride for
[58:06] miles
[58:07] but parents didn't have the same dangers
[58:09] to worry about and and and kids knew how
[58:13] to really play without all the
[58:16] technology
[58:17] and that that that is so abnormal today
[58:20] to play without Tech
[58:22] but they actually knew how to play
[58:25] without technology and and they knew how
[58:29] to socially interact without social
[58:32] media
[58:34] only a couple of few decades ago here
[58:37] was another one uh and I and I'm taking
[58:40] don't anybody say Amen you you'll
[58:43] embarrass yourself
[58:45] watching television for an ouch watching
[58:48] television for an hour and not seeing 24
[58:52] minutes worth of medicine commercials
[58:59] I went wow
[59:01] I remember hearing a preach one time
[59:03] saying that
[59:04] those medicine commercials if you keep
[59:07] watching they'll almost get you to
[59:08] believe and you can't live without that
[59:10] stuff
[59:12] the third one I picked up
[59:15] and he says and this one really touched
[59:17] my heart he said back when Sundays were
[59:19] actually observed
[59:23] a few decades ago back when Sundays were
[59:26] actually observed well I remember this I
[59:30] remember as a child that stores were
[59:32] closed and commerce just didn't happen
[59:36] for many of us it was and Still Remains
[59:40] a day that reminds us of our faith for
[59:44] others it was a day to commune with
[59:46] family over a meal of pasta and
[59:49] meatballs and and and and and and sauce
[59:52] or gravy depending on your version of
[59:54] Italy it was it was lovely and we still
[59:58] honor this time-honored tradition I just
[1:00:01] thought wow that was that that should
[1:00:04] have never been lost
[1:00:05] I'm going to tell you something as a as
[1:00:07] a as a global population not just
[1:00:10] America but finally America Two
[1:00:14] we lost something
[1:00:16] America and the world lost something
[1:00:19] when they stopped taking one day
[1:00:23] to honor God and come together and stay
[1:00:27] with family and have spiritual food and
[1:00:30] natural food and I tell you something
[1:00:33] friends if you've lost that get it back
[1:00:37] take it back do whatever you got to do
[1:00:40] get it back that is a Monumental thing
[1:00:43] this is what I mean you know the fact
[1:00:47] that we don't have these things normally
[1:00:49] anymore is evidence that Satan fights us
[1:00:52] with busyness distractions
[1:00:55] you know because a memory can attack you
[1:00:57] directly so he uses all of these things
[1:00:59] I read a Surgeon General warning that it
[1:01:02] is recent
[1:01:04] and um it was a very interesting article
[1:01:09] if I can get to it here yeah
[1:01:12] and it was just several months ago and
[1:01:14] the U.S Surgeon General
[1:01:16] uh warned in a new advisory
[1:01:20] that that this is the Surgeon General
[1:01:22] now this isn't a message preacher okay
[1:01:25] this is the Surgeon General himself
[1:01:27] he's warning that widespread social
[1:01:30] media use among kids and teens poses a
[1:01:34] significant I want to underscore that
[1:01:37] word
[1:01:38] it's it poses a significant mental
[1:01:42] health risk
[1:01:44] that needs to be addressed immediately
[1:01:50] and it's it's on fire I mean technology
[1:01:54] now has already went to the next level
[1:01:56] AI has blowed the world up and changed
[1:01:58] everything see
[1:02:00] social media is used almost universally
[1:02:04] now this is a global number with up to
[1:02:06] 95 percent globally
[1:02:09] 95 percent of Youth between ages 13 and
[1:02:12] 17 report using it the Surgeon General
[1:02:15] warned in his new advisory
[1:02:18] um
[1:02:19] that let's see
[1:02:21] such advisories are and here's the
[1:02:25] reporter this is this is the reporter
[1:02:27] making this comment and he's saying
[1:02:29] these kinds of advisories from the
[1:02:32] Surgeon General when when the man
[1:02:34] himself comes forward and makes a public
[1:02:36] statement that he's the reporter is
[1:02:39] saying you need to understand that these
[1:02:42] kinds of things are as a matter of
[1:02:44] course
[1:02:46] reserved for significant public health
[1:02:50] challenges
[1:02:51] and they only do it when he's got
[1:02:54] something so urgent that it requires the
[1:02:58] nation's immediate awareness and action
[1:03:02] these are people at the head of IT are
[1:03:04] afraid where this is is headed and that
[1:03:07] it's already already deeply
[1:03:10] and so he's he goes on to say according
[1:03:13] to his the this report it says
[1:03:16] substantial review of the available
[1:03:19] evidence on the impact of social media
[1:03:23] this is a substantial review the report
[1:03:27] says that social media use in kids and
[1:03:32] teens
[1:03:33] can result in both a heightened
[1:03:36] emotional sensitivity
[1:03:39] which that can lead to lower life
[1:03:42] satisfaction
[1:03:44] and we've seen that everybody is in the
[1:03:47] instant gratification mode
[1:03:49] and you can't you can't hardly and and
[1:03:52] it's not just kids it's on adults
[1:03:55] you can't even hardly take a breath see
[1:03:58] and so where I'm saying to you tonight
[1:04:01] this is the devil's tactic and sometimes
[1:04:05] you have to just shake yourself and stay
[1:04:07] I need to get back to the mind of the
[1:04:10] word
[1:04:11] rather than the mind of this Tech or
[1:04:14] that Tech or this social strata or this
[1:04:17] political Hot Topic or this well you
[1:04:20] know I I you need the mind of the word
[1:04:25] and a majority of adolescents report now
[1:04:28] here's something that he also
[1:04:30] acknowledges
[1:04:31] a majority he's he's acknowledging to
[1:04:33] say that there can be a good side to it
[1:04:36] now I thought that's curious because how
[1:04:39] does anything from the Tree of knowledge
[1:04:41] of Good and Evil I guess you know to
[1:04:43] find out that it's good I get like this
[1:04:46] this is and I'm got a good use for it
[1:04:48] you know this is and I've got a good use
[1:04:50] for it but nonetheless it's it's still
[1:04:54] got death Associated this has no death
[1:04:58] associated in it
[1:05:00] so am I crazy for saying we need more of
[1:05:03] this and less of this am I crazy
[1:05:08] see
[1:05:09] and so he says the majority of
[1:05:11] adolescents report that social media
[1:05:13] helps them feel now then I understood
[1:05:16] you crafty devil now listen close I know
[1:05:19] your spiritual Minds will catch this
[1:05:21] a majority of adolescents report that
[1:05:24] social media helps them feel more
[1:05:27] accepted
[1:05:29] like they have people who can support
[1:05:32] them through tough times like they have
[1:05:35] a place to show their creative side this
[1:05:38] is 58 67 71 say this and more connected
[1:05:43] to what's going on in their friend's
[1:05:45] life that's 80 percent according to the
[1:05:48] report and I just thought to myself how
[1:05:50] is it
[1:05:52] that this
[1:05:54] that this is is is not these things that
[1:05:58] they list here what were they feeling
[1:06:00] more accepted support in tough times
[1:06:03] showing a creative side expressing
[1:06:06] themselves in creative ways connected
[1:06:09] you know to friends and family and I
[1:06:12] thought to myself how is it that this is
[1:06:17] not coming through the dynamic of a
[1:06:20] nuclear family
[1:06:24] it's coming through social media and
[1:06:26] somehow that's a good thing
[1:06:29] am I nuts
[1:06:31] and and he's saying well it is a good
[1:06:34] thing that they have all of these I'm
[1:06:36] going you got to be kidding do you think
[1:06:38] that's a good thing you're saying that
[1:06:42] they have to have that because they
[1:06:43] don't have this they don't have nuclear
[1:06:46] family they don't have token applied
[1:06:48] homes wake up America wake up word wake
[1:06:51] up search in general
[1:06:53] well you needed to come out with there
[1:06:54] is a report that there's not enough
[1:06:56] Bible reading in homes
[1:06:59] there's not enough family sitting across
[1:07:01] the table praying
[1:07:03] and breaking bread together
[1:07:06] see
[1:07:08] so I mean my goodness I mean this should
[1:07:11] be this should be part of the alarm that
[1:07:14] this back door way is what I call it you
[1:07:17] know for them to get the positive
[1:07:19] reinforcement that they need uh as they
[1:07:22] grow is not coming through wholesome
[1:07:25] family life but is coming through some
[1:07:28] substitutionary way from the Tree of
[1:07:31] knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:07:33] why are good grief you don't even know
[1:07:34] who's on the other end of that chat line
[1:07:39] just because they show you a picture
[1:07:40] well they already know that don't mean
[1:07:42] nothing
[1:07:43] it might not even be the gender of the
[1:07:45] person they show you you don't know
[1:07:47] nothing about that person and that's
[1:07:49] where you're getting your help through
[1:07:51] tough times
[1:07:53] really
[1:07:55] uh that's that that that's where you're
[1:07:58] you're feeling more accepted
[1:08:01] I mean that should have been
[1:08:03] red lights he should have had that above
[1:08:05] the other thing
[1:08:07] yeah I'm not I'm not dissing on the
[1:08:09] Surgeon General I appreciate his concern
[1:08:12] so still social media
[1:08:14] can he he says so still even with those
[1:08:17] advantages which I already don't think
[1:08:19] are advantages
[1:08:21] uh tell the president I can't take the
[1:08:23] car in
[1:08:25] it still social media
[1:08:30] use can be potentially harmful I'm
[1:08:32] thought you think leading to or
[1:08:35] exacerbating Eating Disorders low
[1:08:38] self-esteem depression and these are all
[1:08:42] according to rigorous studies from the
[1:08:45] surgeon general's office and he cites
[1:08:48] them all I'm not going to give you the
[1:08:49] citations
[1:08:50] so he says at this time now here's
[1:08:52] another thing that took my breath away
[1:08:54] he says at this time we do not yet have
[1:08:57] enough evidence to determine if social
[1:08:58] media is sufficiently safe for children
[1:09:01] and adolescents
[1:09:03] and we must acknowledge the growing body
[1:09:06] of research about potential harms
[1:09:08] increase our Collective understanding of
[1:09:10] the risk with social media use and
[1:09:12] urgently take action to create safe and
[1:09:14] healthy digital environments that
[1:09:16] minimize harm and Safeguard children's
[1:09:17] adolescents mental health as well as
[1:09:19] being critical stages of development and
[1:09:23] I you know it's I'm thinking to myself
[1:09:25] I'm glad that they're noticing they need
[1:09:28] to do something about it but you know
[1:09:31] he's just saying since we're now he goes
[1:09:35] on to say and I applaud him for it since
[1:09:37] we don't have all the evidence in which
[1:09:40] I that grinds on me because I'm thinking
[1:09:43] are you kidding look at the young person
[1:09:46] from the 50s to now
[1:09:49] look at the look at the nuclear family
[1:09:52] what it was before
[1:09:54] 1956 and the nation turned its back on
[1:09:57] God for the last time
[1:09:59] I I've shown graphs here on the screen
[1:10:01] where you you had crime and families and
[1:10:05] and low divorce rates and and and you
[1:10:08] know stay-at-home moms and all these and
[1:10:10] all of a sudden right after 1956 it
[1:10:14] doesn't just start going like that I
[1:10:16] showed a graph where it went like this
[1:10:18] yeah
[1:10:19] and it just took off like a rocket yeah
[1:10:23] and you have teenagers with such social
[1:10:27] anxieties and prescription medications
[1:10:30] are flying and brother Brandon said in a
[1:10:33] in a time where we have such plenty and
[1:10:36] you'd think that it would be almost
[1:10:37] Utopia but it's the exact opposite of
[1:10:40] that how much more evidence they need
[1:10:42] are they going to wait another 50 years
[1:10:44] and say wow it's probably a bad idea and
[1:10:47] he's saying you know it's since we don't
[1:10:49] know we should take action I applaud him
[1:10:51] for that but but he doesn't tell that
[1:10:54] here's the action to take
[1:10:58] it's just we need more time to have
[1:11:00] studies and you should probably limit
[1:11:01] the interactivity I'm here to tell you
[1:11:04] something friends it's not about
[1:11:05] limiting it's about creating a love
[1:11:07] affair for this over that and you don't
[1:11:10] have to take it or remove it or set up
[1:11:12] legalism you'll have young people who
[1:11:15] say I want to go to church I want to
[1:11:16] read my Bible I want to pray I want to
[1:11:19] have family
[1:11:21] all it takes is the Holy Ghost come back
[1:11:23] to the mind of the word tonight
[1:11:28] see
[1:11:30] so we need to return what does it mean
[1:11:35] brother Jason to returning returning my
[1:11:38] thoughts to the mind of the word I
[1:11:40] thought about that as a statement
[1:11:42] because that's how it came to me
[1:11:44] when it when the sermon began to develop
[1:11:46] in my mind
[1:11:49] and I just wrote a few I things down
[1:11:52] that it meant to me and I'm trusting
[1:11:55] it'll help you to have clarity
[1:11:59] you know to return my mind
[1:12:02] to the thoughts of the word
[1:12:06] means to turn my thoughts away from
[1:12:10] say oh he's going to name something he's
[1:12:13] going to go down a bullet list and
[1:12:15] clothesline us to death
[1:12:17] I'm actually not going to do that I'm
[1:12:18] going to give you such an all-inclusive
[1:12:20] statement you can make your own list
[1:12:23] how you like that
[1:12:25] this is the Kinder gentler version of me
[1:12:29] tonight
[1:12:30] not the maniac you had in the Pulpit
[1:12:33] here last Wednesday
[1:12:38] to return my mind to the thoughts of the
[1:12:40] word
[1:12:41] means to me
[1:12:43] to turn away from things that are not
[1:12:47] the word
[1:12:48] say what is that well whatever it is
[1:12:52] right that are not the word
[1:12:54] you need some more of that
[1:12:57] you need some more turning away
[1:13:01] proactively
[1:13:03] not just thinking of a beautiful thought
[1:13:05] I should do that
[1:13:07] or even just sitting here tonight saying
[1:13:09] amen you need to make some you need to
[1:13:10] put on some armor you need to take the
[1:13:13] sword which is the word see
[1:13:16] so that means that in the in the
[1:13:19] day-to-day things to think about
[1:13:22] and we have a lot of day-to-day things
[1:13:24] to think about
[1:13:26] life is busy
[1:13:28] and that's the devil's he plays in that
[1:13:30] see with distractions and busyness
[1:13:35] so I apply it
[1:13:38] to think and decide when I when I'm
[1:13:41] gonna take my day-to-day things that I
[1:13:44] have to think about I'm going to apply
[1:13:46] the word that is to say I apply it to
[1:13:49] think and decide correctly for every
[1:13:53] decision I make and every action I take
[1:13:56] I proactively work it out what is the
[1:14:00] way of the word
[1:14:02] in this decision or this action
[1:14:07] and and that's not a light thing and you
[1:14:10] you have to
[1:14:12] have to do that
[1:14:14] I'm here to tell you the Holy Ghost
[1:14:16] tells you to do it he won't do it for
[1:14:19] you
[1:14:20] this is something you have to decide to
[1:14:23] do
[1:14:26] and you know after 60 years of
[1:14:29] being a wrecking ball and limiting the
[1:14:32] blessing of God on my own life I've
[1:14:34] decided to just retire and give him full
[1:14:37] control
[1:14:40] so what have you learned after 60 years
[1:14:42] that right there that's what I've
[1:14:43] learned I've just decided that whenever
[1:14:46] I'm making decisions that I'm not
[1:14:48] Consulting his word and whenever I'm
[1:14:50] going in my own way and I forget
[1:14:53] I'm a good guy I love the Lord I'm a
[1:14:55] real Christian but sometimes I just get
[1:14:57] busy and forget
[1:14:59] you know like David wanted to bring the
[1:15:01] ark back great thing but he never
[1:15:03] consulted the prophet Nathan he
[1:15:05] consulted captains and guards and and
[1:15:07] and rulers and Nathan the prophet was
[1:15:10] right there
[1:15:11] see
[1:15:12] and so I I just decided that I'm gonna
[1:15:16] I'm gonna spend more of my brain power
[1:15:19] to try to figure out how do I how do I
[1:15:22] eliminate the world's thinking and I'm
[1:15:25] talking about sinful thinking I'm just
[1:15:27] talking about whatever's not the word
[1:15:29] you get me
[1:15:31] how many's with me
[1:15:33] why don't you retire now don't wait till
[1:15:35] you're 60. just retire now and say okay
[1:15:38] I'm gonna take your advice Pastor I'm
[1:15:40] just gonna from this day forward I'm
[1:15:42] going to consider the word and
[1:15:43] everything I think and everything I
[1:15:46] decide to do
[1:15:47] this is the prayer that I pray you know
[1:15:50] coming back to the mind of the word I
[1:15:55] don't know about you but that's the
[1:15:56] prayer I pray whenever I have found
[1:15:58] myself recovering from some spiritual
[1:16:01] stumbling or or maybe just when I'm
[1:16:04] trying to renew myself from stagnation
[1:16:07] or carnality I say to myself come back
[1:16:10] to the mind of the word
[1:16:12] oh you you can't believe how rapidly you
[1:16:16] can undo weeks and weeks of the devil's
[1:16:19] planning and maneuvering and get you
[1:16:21] into the certain place and spring the
[1:16:23] Trap and and five seconds of caught
[1:16:26] turning back to the word and undo all of
[1:16:28] his plans
[1:16:29] oh you have the power to to put on the
[1:16:32] helmet of salvation and the shield of
[1:16:34] Faith Hallelujah you have that ability
[1:16:36] friends use it
[1:16:41] sometimes you know it's something as
[1:16:43] simple as trying to plot my own course
[1:16:46] or make a life decision but without
[1:16:49] seeking his perfect will first
[1:16:51] ah no ma'am I'm okay I'm sorry I'm sorry
[1:16:54] I knew better than to wear this thing
[1:16:56] uh call okay
[1:17:00] sorry I forgot I forgot I knew there was
[1:17:02] a reason I should wear my Apple watch
[1:17:04] and I'm preaching
[1:17:05] and it doesn't have a Pentecostal
[1:17:08] blocker button
[1:17:10] and so
[1:17:17] a lot of times we're making these
[1:17:19] decisions without seeking his will first
[1:17:21] and come on you know as well as me more
[1:17:23] often than not we just make a a mess out
[1:17:26] of things
[1:17:27] and it'll just keep being a mess I can
[1:17:29] hear I'm here to tell you tonight by
[1:17:31] experience you can take my word for it
[1:17:32] it'll just keep getting Messier until
[1:17:35] you finally go down to your knees and
[1:17:37] raise up your hands and surrender and
[1:17:38] say Lord please just take over enough of
[1:17:42] me already my goodness
[1:17:45] Hallelujah
[1:17:46] you know bring me back bring me back
[1:17:49] lord to the perfect mind of Christ bring
[1:17:52] me back to your word and all things can
[1:17:55] that be a desire of your heart tonight
[1:17:56] friends can you really look at the
[1:17:59] larger picture and say Lord God bring
[1:18:01] bring me back to your word in all things
[1:18:06] in all things
[1:18:08] with the insanity of the world and
[1:18:11] goodness friends everything steals our
[1:18:14] minds away from the word of God doesn't
[1:18:15] it
[1:18:16] doesn't it it robs you every day it just
[1:18:19] sucks the spirituality but I'm here to
[1:18:22] tell you that what I'm preaching on
[1:18:23] tonight what I read to you from Saint
[1:18:26] Paul and if you go to listen to brother
[1:18:28] Brandon's practical brother Branham has
[1:18:30] a whole practical thing a list of things
[1:18:32] you can do that he relates back to
[1:18:33] scriptures I'm here to tell you it's the
[1:18:36] cure for what ails you
[1:18:38] I want you to know that tonight it's the
[1:18:40] absolute cure for what ails you you are
[1:18:43] you you know I I want to make this point
[1:18:45] I've had this point in my in my mind for
[1:18:49] a number of weeks and I I said it uh to
[1:18:53] myself and I've already said it to
[1:18:55] several people that I felt that it could
[1:18:57] help them
[1:18:59] you know you you are never you're never
[1:19:02] going to be able
[1:19:04] to grasp and take a hold of
[1:19:08] and and really get the benefits of
[1:19:12] following the message of the hour
[1:19:13] without a new birth
[1:19:18] you're missing out on on the bigger
[1:19:20] benefits see
[1:19:22] ing I mean you you can get good
[1:19:24] direction for Your Life by the message
[1:19:27] of the hour because it's all scriptural
[1:19:29] based you can get good life principles
[1:19:31] from the message of the hour because all
[1:19:32] it is the restoration of the word with
[1:19:35] all the debris of man-made theology
[1:19:37] moved aside that's what the message is
[1:19:39] two thousand years of church annity
[1:19:41] piled this under so much debris and the
[1:19:44] message just digs it out and gets back
[1:19:46] down to virgin virgin print that's what
[1:19:49] it is it's not a new gospel it's just
[1:19:51] the restoration of this
[1:19:53] see and and you can you can you can
[1:19:55] absolutely uh get some direction for
[1:19:58] your life and even without a new birth
[1:20:00] and some good principles for life even
[1:20:02] without a new birth but to reap the
[1:20:04] large benefits of having the mind of
[1:20:07] Christ that says Amen to every word
[1:20:10] you'll just never see those
[1:20:13] without a real surrendered heart and
[1:20:17] life
[1:20:19] saying Amen to every word of God
[1:20:21] requires deep resolve it not only that
[1:20:24] it it it it it brings a faith that is
[1:20:28] born of deep relationship with the Lord
[1:20:31] and it literally opens the windows of
[1:20:33] Heaven for you to build you literally
[1:20:36] have the ability to build your life into
[1:20:39] a Garden of Eden
[1:20:43] it doesn't matter what should befallen
[1:20:44] you or how much of a head start you

[1:20:50] how tripped you've ever been how how
[1:20:53] disadvantaged you've ever been I don't
[1:20:56] tell you something friends I've seen
[1:20:57] people go for decades and decades and
[1:20:59] decades and be midway through their life
[1:21:03] story and everything is chaos and
[1:21:06] wreckage and burning heaps behind them
[1:21:10] and give their life to God and God turn
[1:21:12] their life into a garden in three or
[1:21:15] four months
[1:21:16] just months God can erase 50 years in
[1:21:21] months
[1:21:22] Hallelujah I want to say to you young
[1:21:24] people don't even wait for him to need
[1:21:26] to do it that way make that decision now
[1:21:31] it's you know you you can make your life
[1:21:34] a Garden of Eden sure trials are going
[1:21:36] to come of course you know not every
[1:21:39] moment while we're marching design feels
[1:21:43] like a Garden of Eden right Believers
[1:21:46] not true
[1:21:48] I mean let's just be honest we have to
[1:21:51] be honest that not every moment marching
[1:21:53] distance just because I gave my life to
[1:21:55] the Lord for the rest of that actually
[1:21:57] makes you a Target
[1:21:59] but again it's a sum positive at the end
[1:22:01] of the day you have a net gain by doing
[1:22:03] it
[1:22:04] you're you have a net gain to have the
[1:22:07] Holy Ghost and fight the greatest battle
[1:22:09] ever fought then to not have the Holy
[1:22:11] Ghost and fight a lesser battle
[1:22:13] it's a Net game and so you know not but
[1:22:17] not every day we readily admit that that
[1:22:19] not every day marching you know in the
[1:22:22] in the admonition of the Lord
[1:22:25] feels like a Garden of Eden not every
[1:22:27] day you know and sometimes even many
[1:22:30] days
[1:22:31] you can go through as as Believers you
[1:22:33] can go through many reasons and and and
[1:22:36] you can actually walk many days through
[1:22:38] what feels more it's a Garden of Eden
[1:22:40] feels more like a wilderness
[1:22:42] feels more like I'm in a desert what are
[1:22:44] you talking about a Garden of Eden but
[1:22:46] I'm here to tell you even in the midst
[1:22:48] of Trials and troubles even if you're in
[1:22:51] that kind of a place the same faith that
[1:22:54] you had in the garden you'll have in the
[1:22:56] desert
[1:22:57] Hallelujah the same faith that you have
[1:23:00] in the garden you will have in the
[1:23:02] wilderness the same resolve that you
[1:23:04] have in good times it's still with you
[1:23:06] in the bad times
[1:23:09] the same determination that you have
[1:23:11] that you feel when blessings are pouring
[1:23:14] out is the same determination when you
[1:23:17] can't remember your last blessing
[1:23:22] I've been there I know what I speak of
[1:23:25] and all my trials and troubles today
[1:23:27] friends I find myself very honestly more
[1:23:31] determined today to press to the kingdom
[1:23:33] than I ever have before because I have
[1:23:36] found that the Lord is trustworthy
[1:23:39] The Trials come the troubles come the
[1:23:42] Wilderness part the Lord had to have a
[1:23:45] Wilderness part
[1:23:46] of his journey the church
[1:23:49] of Christ has had a Wilderness Journey
[1:23:52] for seven Church ages
[1:23:54] for 2 000 years but all the faith all
[1:23:58] the peace and all the trust remains with
[1:24:01] you no matter what there's nothing like
[1:24:05] being born again of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:11] brother Branham I want to come to this
[1:24:13] uh just just for a minute and I'm not
[1:24:15] going to get to my other part that's
[1:24:17] okay because I want to stop in four
[1:24:18] minutes
[1:24:20] so I'm going to read this quote and
[1:24:21] we're gonna stop and I'll pick it up at
[1:24:23] my next Family series
[1:24:26] let me just give you a little bit of
[1:24:27] background brother Adam comes to the
[1:24:28] seven Church ages and he's reading
[1:24:31] in the Book of Revelation where he hath
[1:24:34] made us Kings and Priests
[1:24:36] and without teaching on that tonight
[1:24:38] because it's an in-depth study I just
[1:24:41] want to say that your
[1:24:44] your
[1:24:45] um
[1:24:47] the the very grounds
[1:24:50] of your kingdom Authority
[1:24:53] is grounded in the fact that you're a
[1:24:57] priest
[1:24:59] amen
[1:25:00] remember do we agree Jesus is the king
[1:25:03] of all Kings
[1:25:05] but yet Melchizedek said thou art a
[1:25:07] priest forever
[1:25:10] and again I don't have time to go
[1:25:12] teaching on that tonight Melchizedek
[1:25:13] that story there in Genesis is the
[1:25:15] perfect type of the bride's ministry as
[1:25:17] brother Branham taught us so many times
[1:25:18] it's a type of the Bride the word made
[1:25:21] flesh in the ministry of the son of man
[1:25:23] but but it's all about being a priest
[1:25:25] because we're Kings toward Humanity
[1:25:30] remember brother Adam said God didn't
[1:25:31] make the Earth for him to rule he made
[1:25:34] the Earth for man to rule
[1:25:36] and the god rules the universe and in
[1:25:39] the Millennium we will be a kingdom of
[1:25:42] Kings and Priests
[1:25:44] and so we'll have a kingship Authority
[1:25:47] of of the king we will be the executors
[1:25:51] of his will will be the enforcers of his
[1:25:53] word will be the Sowers of his seed
[1:25:56] and and we're just talking about in the
[1:25:58] Millennium is just while it's still here
[1:25:59] on Earth because that's just a honeymoon
[1:26:01] but then we finally get to go home after
[1:26:03] the honeymoon uh and and and and that's
[1:26:06] not limited to the Earth see because
[1:26:09] what what God created was not just an
[1:26:12] earth he created a universe
[1:26:14] and worlds and worlds of Worlds and
[1:26:17] don't you think for a minute it's there
[1:26:19] just to look at and be pretty
[1:26:22] God has that for a reason of the
[1:26:24] increase of his kingdom there shall be
[1:26:26] no end of the increase of it
[1:26:29] so it's a Perpetual increasing they they
[1:26:32] say that they can't find the borders and
[1:26:36] parameters of the universe they think it
[1:26:38] may be even ever expanding and I just
[1:26:40] say that's good because an
[1:26:42] ever-expanding kingdom is going to need
[1:26:43] to never expanding universe
[1:26:46] but but that's how we're Kings but we're
[1:26:50] but the authority of our kingship what
[1:26:52] makes it look what legitimizes our our
[1:26:54] Authority is that we're priest unto God
[1:26:58] and brother Branham talks a little bit
[1:27:01] about priests and I if there's a lot
[1:27:03] more than what's in this quote but again
[1:27:04] I'm not going to go into that tonight I
[1:27:07] made next time probably will
[1:27:09] but brother Branham says in the seven
[1:27:11] Church ages
[1:27:13] he has made us priests
[1:27:15] did you ever know
[1:27:17] what a priest is now don't lose sight of
[1:27:20] this fact because I'm closing right here
[1:27:21] don't lose sight of this fact
[1:27:24] is that God has called you to be Kings
[1:27:27] right now
[1:27:29] and you say well what what's the job
[1:27:31] description what does that entail it
[1:27:34] means that you are to take authority
[1:27:36] over sin
[1:27:38] over the world over the Flesh and over
[1:27:42] the devil
[1:27:44] that's a lot of responsibility
[1:27:48] but I can tell you that you will never
[1:27:50] successfully do that outside of a a new
[1:27:53] birth because that's what empowers you
[1:27:56] and be a willingness to be a priest
[1:27:59] first
[1:28:01] uh a king over the world and sin and
[1:28:05] flesh and the devil Jesus said I've
[1:28:08] given you power over all the power of
[1:28:09] the devil because remember your power is
[1:28:11] original
[1:28:13] brother Branham said Satan's power is
[1:28:15] actually just a perversion of God's
[1:28:16] power
[1:28:17] you don't actually have any original
[1:28:18] Power did you know that
[1:28:20] you don't have any original Power it's a
[1:28:22] perversion of God's power you actually
[1:28:24] have authentic God power
[1:28:26] right so that's why Jesus could say I've
[1:28:29] given you power over all the power of
[1:28:31] the enemy in other words he's saying
[1:28:32] I've given you the kind of power
[1:28:34] that is more powerful than the power
[1:28:37] that the enemy has
[1:28:38] that makes sense don't lose sight of
[1:28:40] that next time he challenges you
[1:28:42] and and so we are Kings over flesh over
[1:28:47] sin over the world and over the devil
[1:28:50] because we are priest unto God
[1:28:53] because we intercede
[1:28:56] for the world for our family we lift up
[1:29:00] praises to God in worship we correct
[1:29:03] errors we we hear somebody say there's
[1:29:06] no such a thing as Divine Healing and we
[1:29:08] say no friend that's not true see I'm
[1:29:10] I'm I'm praising God I'm praising him to
[1:29:13] say that's not accurate let me teach you
[1:29:15] oh it's baptism and father Son and Holy
[1:29:17] Ghost no no sit down let's open our
[1:29:20] Bible see I'm being a priest
[1:29:22] see now watch here's another facet of it
[1:29:25] that's really going to hit home you
[1:29:27] ready
[1:29:28] seven Church ages 1954.
[1:29:31] he has made us priests
[1:29:33] did you ever know what a priest is what
[1:29:36] his office is
[1:29:38] a priest is to make sacrifice that's one
[1:29:43] to make intercession
[1:29:46] that's why he says
[1:29:48] and he quotes first Peter
[1:29:50] 2 9
[1:29:52] where it calls us a royal priesthood
[1:29:56] a holy nation
[1:29:58] of peculiar people see and then you'll
[1:30:02] notice that the prophet inverts the
[1:30:04] order and he says a holy nation peculiar
[1:30:07] people royal priesthood
[1:30:09] so your royal priesthood is is what is
[1:30:13] the authoritative Foundation of your
[1:30:15] kingship and the foundation of your
[1:30:17] priesthood is that you're To Be A
[1:30:19] peculiar people
[1:30:21] and a holy nation and that makes you an
[1:30:24] acceptable priest unto God
[1:30:28] offering hidden woman that comes to God
[1:30:31] enters into the veil that's a
[1:30:33] prerequisite that's the new birth
[1:30:36] if you want to be a king over the flesh
[1:30:39] the world the sin the devil then you've
[1:30:43] got to be a priest and if you want to be
[1:30:44] a real priest you've got to enter in
[1:30:46] Beyond the Veil where the Shekinah is
[1:30:49] what is it now
[1:30:51] spiritual sacrifices that is and he's
[1:30:54] going to name some categories he's going
[1:30:56] to give you some practical ways so you
[1:30:58] can really get it get your mind wrapped
[1:31:00] around what it means to be a priest
[1:31:03] because everybody loves power everybody
[1:31:05] loves Authority I'm a king I got power
[1:31:07] come here devil hold on
[1:31:09] you got to get the priest's part fixed
[1:31:11] first yeah see now otherwise the devil
[1:31:14] will laugh at you
[1:31:17] what is it now spiritual sacrifices that
[1:31:20] is here's one of them the fruit of our
[1:31:22] lips giving praise to his name
[1:31:25] so it you know I I witnessed it tonight
[1:31:28] I witnessed it Sunday you know a song
[1:31:30] leader comes up and starts singing and
[1:31:33] worship starts out across the building
[1:31:35] that's spiritual sacrifice see you could
[1:31:38] be using your pipes at a football game
[1:31:40] but you're instead you're here in church
[1:31:42] lifting praises to God that's why it's
[1:31:44] so that's why it's so embarrassing if
[1:31:47] the if the song leader has to Prime you
[1:31:49] and pump you
[1:31:51] see that that's not a priest all right
[1:31:54] brother I'm going to keep dealing with
[1:31:55] it he says
[1:31:56] now here's another facet of it all right
[1:31:58] here's one the fruit of our lips
[1:32:00] praising giving praise to his name
[1:32:03] now watch this when a little confusion
[1:32:06] comes in the church
[1:32:09] you don't run over to one side and pout
[1:32:16] you know if you do you need to get over
[1:32:17] yourself
[1:32:19] yeah he said when a little confusion
[1:32:21] comes in the church you don't run over
[1:32:23] one side and pout now if you are
[1:32:27] you sure ain't a priest
[1:32:29] see what I do brother Branham you pray
[1:32:32] through
[1:32:34] spiritual sacrifice the fruit of our
[1:32:38] lips giving praise to his name what's
[1:32:41] the spiritual fruit of my lips I'm
[1:32:43] praying through there's a confusion I
[1:32:45] don't pout I use my lips to pray through
[1:32:50] because why I'm a spiritual priest but
[1:32:53] they did me wrong right but you're a
[1:32:55] priest
[1:32:56] but I got a right to defend your priest
[1:33:00] but they need to get a peace of mind
[1:33:01] you're a priest
[1:33:03] somebody needs to die get a deacon
[1:33:05] you're a priest
[1:33:07] see
[1:33:10] you pray through the fruit of our lips
[1:33:12] giving praise to his name see what I
[1:33:14] mean while you say I just don't feel
[1:33:17] like going to church but you're a priest
[1:33:20] it's your duty you've got to be there
[1:33:25] you see listen friends Paul Paul talks
[1:33:28] about assembling yourselves more
[1:33:29] deceived the day approaching the evil
[1:33:32] day approaching so people who have
[1:33:33] slacked on their Church attendance
[1:33:34] either don't see the evil day
[1:33:36] approaching or they just don't they just
[1:33:38] don't have enough Faith to obey a
[1:33:40] prophet
[1:33:41] listen coming to church
[1:33:43] you're not coming here to get saved
[1:33:46] you're already saved you come here to
[1:33:49] get strength
[1:33:53] right you come here to get strength not
[1:33:56] to get saved you're already saved and
[1:33:59] you're you're in church everywhere you
[1:34:01] go but you come here with the Saints and
[1:34:04] the worship and the singing and the
[1:34:06] preaching to get cleaned up and
[1:34:07] tightened up and adjusted and
[1:34:10] strengthened
[1:34:12] John
[1:34:15] so so he says
[1:34:18] you say I I don't feel like going to
[1:34:20] church but you're a priest it's your
[1:34:21] duty you've got to be there well I just
[1:34:23] don't feel like taking a part in the
[1:34:25] service but you're a priest making a
[1:34:29] sacrifice
[1:34:32] a spiritual sacrifice when you see a
[1:34:36] Time coming that everybody blaspheming
[1:34:38] and saying these things and doing things
[1:34:40] wrong what do you do walk away
[1:34:43] you're supposed to stand there with a
[1:34:45] spiritual sacrifice saying the blood of
[1:34:47] Jesus Christ cleanses from all sin makes
[1:34:50] me a new creature in Christ Jesus and
[1:34:53] it's the power of God unto salvation I
[1:34:56] believe it
[1:34:57] what he says when you're confronting
[1:34:59] Blasphemous ways you say listen I
[1:35:01] believe in the power of God
[1:35:04] that
[1:35:06] this is what the Surgeon General needed
[1:35:09] to publish I thought that to myself this
[1:35:11] quote
[1:35:12] this is what this quote would do the
[1:35:14] nation in the world more good than all
[1:35:16] of his
[1:35:17] ten hun a thousand reports this is what
[1:35:20] he needs to publish this is what this is
[1:35:23] what the bride needs to keep our our
[1:35:25] assemblies moving to keep the Holy
[1:35:29] Spirit moving in our assemblies this is
[1:35:31] what we need to say I'm a spiritual
[1:35:33] priest this is what homes need
[1:35:36] this is what families need this is what
[1:35:39] this is what our this is what parents
[1:35:41] need to make sure that is in place that
[1:35:44] that the home is a place of spiritual
[1:35:46] sacrifice if it's not come back to the
[1:35:49] word
[1:35:50] if your assembly is God confusion come
[1:35:53] back to the mind of the word
[1:35:56] if your feelings have been heard cast it
[1:35:58] down come back to the mind of the word
[1:36:00] see
[1:36:02] this is exactly what the Lord
[1:36:06] uh needs to hear and that's when he can
[1:36:10] come in and do the most magical things
[1:36:12] that you more than you could even think
[1:36:15] to ask
[1:36:17] amen
[1:36:18] God bless you all you Kings and Priests
