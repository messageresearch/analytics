========================================

e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e you know and we that I don't have the quote here but you know we we can follow this seed line throughout the Bible right you know he talks about Abraham's seed that it would come down and that that God would choose Abraham to be begin building this the seed line in in the nation of Israel that it would you know come down through Seth and through through Mo through Noah and then through down to Abraham and I you know in thinking about that you know we I know this is kind of simplistic concept but you know so often times it is simple um you know the Bible says every seed would bring forth out for its own kind and that by your fruits you would know them the way you can tell that Abraham was the seed of God and was a child of God is because Abraham did what God did right if you take if you you know if if you tell hey I've got this really really bizarre chicken it doesn't seem to behave the way a chicken should behave it's really aggressive and VI aggressive and vicious and it's Giant and it doesn't look like a chicken but I found it in the barnyard and we go over there and it's this giant you know wingspan six feet wide Brown feathers white head 4 inch hook Beacon massive Talons I'm going to go sorry dude that's not a chicken that's a bald eagle I don't care what Barnyard you got out of that's not a chicken right and you know if if if we have an orchard and we plant an orchard we have a hundred pear seeds and then one of our pear seeds Sprouts into a tree that grows apples I'm not going to say well this is some sort of par seed that mutated into an apple tree I'm say no someone at the packing plant mixed up and put a per an apple seed in there right the apple seed you know we can we can judge the what the thing is and what the origin of it is by what it produces so if the original if we can look back in the first thing the Bible says about God is that he spoke and brought forth and that he believed his own word right then the the marker of the children of God are going to be that they're going to believe his God's word too right that's the marker that's why when Abraham the Bible says that Abraham staggered not at the promise say that Abraham staggered not Abraham staggered plenty right there was a lot of times where Abraham fell flat on his face you know and it's and it's funny you know know especially in a talking about lineage and how you know the children do exactly what the father does you know Abraham goes and lies about Sarah being his sister or being his wife to AMC and then he has the son Isaac who then goes and lies about Rebecca being his wife to AMC and you know it's the it's the in the same thing and then and then Isaac's son Jacob first thing he does is he lies about who he is Dees his and calls himself his brother you know he's a liar and then then and then Jacob's son Joseph goes and lies to Pharaoh about what his family does for a living because he doesn't he's too ashamed to say that they're Shepherds so here we have a whole family of liars generation after generation after generation of people who are deceitful liars and God chose them right God chose them not because that they were perfect people not because that they would be you know Flawless or because that they wouldn't have massive personal failures you know in in some sense maybe he chose them because they would have personal failures right right because then maybe if they could recognize their own failure they could recognize that they needed God's help to begin with right Perfect People perfect people who don't think they have a problem are never going to reach out for help right you know that's the I know it it's kind of funny you know that's what they say the first step you know AA alcoholicas that's the first step of of getting better is that you admit that you got a problem right this is very simple and yet so many times people don't want to do that they want to look at their life and say I have a problem I'm clearly not aligned with the word of God they'll find every excuse as to why that they're okay they'll find every excuse as to why that doesn't apply to them or or why they're they're all right but they they don't recognize that they have a problem and so then they'll never get they'll never get saved they'll never get they'll never get delivered of of anything and so here's God you know and then it then it also scratches you know it's kind of a bit of a head scratch right that you know the Bible says that Abraham staggered not at the promise but wasn't Hagar supposed to be their carnal humanistic workaround to the promise that they didn't understand how it would how it would function so Sarah was like hey here's my maid servant Hagar we'll fulfill the promise that way well it kind of sounds like Abraham staggered at the promise a little bit didn't it right but that's not what God saw that's not God's view of things that's not how God saw things from a human perspective you might say that but from God's perspective Abraham staggered not why because there was a seed of God on the inside and that's what God was looking at right there was a piece of God inside Abraham it's another this is a another quote brother Brand's talking about the same thing about God believing his own word and he says um uh says and do you know that how how did God make the Earth this Earth that you're sitting on this morning people don't want to believe in faith how did God make the Earth he spoke it amen you see he spoke and the world came into existence and this world this morning is the spoken word of God uh spoken word of God and he believed his own word watch it and if God and if you're an offspring of of him and God is in you he will believe his own word though it can't be seen felt taste or anything you'll believe it see what I mean in other words if you have a part of God inside of you right the piece of God that's inside of you is going to do what God does and believe the word of God right it can't not and if there's something inside of you that's believing the word of God then it's going to come to pass no matter what you may or may not think or feel or do at any given point right there's something inside of you that's going to bring forth you know it might require particular environment it might require a particular time and place but it's going to manifest right it has to and so you know we we we carry on you know that here's this seed line continuing on from from Abraham it goes down through and and because God spoke that there would have to be this this this this lineage right that would ultimately terminate in in Christ that no matter how shaky things might have gotten the word was going to was going to find a way to be manifested right that here it is through through and that it would you know what's interesting you know we we talk about um you know time and I don't this is a rabbit hole I don't want to go down but um you know even like physics we talk about you know the in the modern world physicists have figured out that time and space are are actually linked directly that you can you know Einstein talked about this through relativity that fast you move through space low move you move through time where even with um GPS satellites they're moving so fast they actually have to um basically adjust the clocks on GPS satellites because they don't tick at the same rate as clocks on Earth um because they're moving through time differently right they literally will move if you if you just take a a clock from the earth and put it up in space and spin it around the earth fast enough eventually they'll the clocks will get out of time because if they're moving through time at a different rate well you know I guess my point in this is that when you're talking about time as a physical Dimension and you're talking about a God who is above time and can see all of time time isn't what to God what it is to us right for us time is a win and for God time can be aware right like when when God does something now and you know if if God does something now the the manifestation of it might not be to our perspective until 10 years later but it happened then right that's how a lamb could be slain before the foundation of the world right because because time isn't isn't the same right God God is outside of that when God does things things it's outside of what we think of as cause and effect and and the here and now right and so for God when he speaks this word about a seed lineage he can see that word going through the timeline from here to here and it's perfect all the way through even if it has to go through places that people don't normally expect right here it is that that word that seed is going to is going to manifest and as it manifests and and goes through time that that word is slowly unraveling and and growing and and and bringing to pass what the original intent was that there would be a savior right because that was this the the the prophecy in Genesis chapter 3 that there would be a a that that there would be a uh a um that the that the woman's seed would bruise the head of the serpent and that it was a it was a particular person right well on the on the road to get there it's gonna it's going to go through people like Hagar or uh through I'm sorry not Hagar um Rahab right it's going to go through people like Ruth it's going to go through people like David you know of all people right it's going to go and it's like well these people aren't they're not good people from a human perspective right David David the the lecherous adulterous murderer who killed his one of his dearest friends who was nothing but loyal to him over you know over an affair and yet that's that's the that's who the Bible says that Christ would be the the son of David of all people right he couldn't he couldn't have been the you know couldn't have been the the son of of anybody else right couldn't have couldn't have why why not the son of of uh of Boaz right why not the son of Boaz it's only like couple Generations previous and we could have got to there but no it had to be the son of David right and you know this is just something to keep in your pocket we'll get back to that um so then we you know we fast forward and eventually we get down to we get down to to Mary and then we asked the question about why does the prophecy mention a woman's seed because traditionally we always think of the man being the one carrying the seed and the woman not and being you know the manifestation of that she brings forth the seed of the man but how is it that a prophecy would talk about a woman's seed right the only way that could happen is if a woman were to Bear a child that didn't involve a man h a virgin conceiving and not like what the Catholics teach where it's literally you know Mary's uh egg but Mary had a seat of God inside of her that when the word came to her she said so be it amen that's the that's the truth and that seed inside of her brought forth life right it was the woman's portion of God that brought forth Christ when she said amen to the word of God yeah right and so likewise today you know it's very lovely to to talk about Mary doing this these things but too many times people want to put that off on Mary or somebody else and don't want to recognize themselves in the picture don't want to put themselves in the picture and say well no but I do the same thing that's me too right there's another Mary in this day who say when the word of God comes to us we say Amen to the word of God and the same seed of God in us was the same seed in go of God and Mary and it'll if if that seed brought forth Christ then it will do the same thing in your life right if you say Amen to the word of God then the seed of God inside of you will bring forth the same life that Mary brought forth right it has to that's the only way it can work right no matter how hard you try no matter how hard you you know you you take that apple seed and you plant it no matter what ground you plant it in if it's conducive to life at all it's going to bring forth an apple tree no amount of changing the dirt is going to turn that apple seed into a pear seed right no amount of changing your set of circumstances going to change whether or not there's a that the seed of God inside of you brings forth anything other than God right and you know we we look at the you know and you know we talk you know know that the God and and Satan chose before the foundation of the world they were going to have a battle there's this Great War in heaven between Good and Evil that the Battleground for this war was going to take place in the human mind and in the human soul why on Earth would would that be the the the place that conflict would make sense right why would that be the place that that the battle would take place well it's because you know the disagreement is that Satan is saying to to Satan's argument is to God is no matter if you give people free moral agency that no matter how perfect you were to you could make them right no matter how perfect you could make them and no matter how perfect and beautiful and lovely the circumstances you would put them in I will find a way to corrupt them right that Satan no matter how perfect your spoken word is I will find a way to twist it right that's Satan's argument that's Satan's claim and so that's and so that's what God does right he makes a perfect world he makes a perfect Eden he makes a perfect people how could be who could be more perfect than those made in the image of God right they're absolutely Flawless and yet Satan found a way to corrupt them and then God's counterargument is Satan no matter how corrupt you could make them and no matter how corrupt you could make my children and no matter how corrupt and defiled you could make my world I will always find a way to perfect them right no matter how that's why God could choose Abraham that's why God could choose Isaac and Jacob and that's how God could choose us right that's how God could choose an imperfect people because it's there's no miracle in saving people who don't need saved right there's the the miraculous and the glory of God comes through saving people who really need it right it comes through saving people who are imperfect and and and even though they might fail and even though from the outside it looks like there's there is staggering there is no matter what no matter how bad things get no matter what the the the Earth that the seed is placed in no matter what your flesh might do or say no matter how corrupt your flesh might be there's something on the inside of the inside that says Amen to the word of God no matter how bad I st stumble and fall there's going to be a a a longing and a and a drive and a push to manifest the word of God right that for our day that there's going to be life come forth and so we're going to we're going to strive for that no matter how many times and no no matter how badly we fail there will always be a a a striving for Perfection a striving for towards becoming what God had intended us to be so that's we'll get you out two minutes early let's stand and have a word of prayer father Lord we thank you for this morning and this opportunity to maybe say something encouraging to the people Lord we ask that you would take the things that I would say in the hearts of the people and that you would anoint them that you would be with them with us through the day and

would be pleased to meet us here Lord and so father that we would worship you not just with with our you know clapping of hands and singing of songs and with instruments Lord but with our lives that our lives would be a living worship that everything we would do and say would be bring glory to your name that we wouldn't just simply be some lip service or some some song service Lord but that we would be a life lived according to your word there would be a constant thirst and a constant drive to be made perfect by Your Word we ask these things in the name precious name of the Lord Jesus
