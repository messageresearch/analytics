brother brad gonna give us some special hey man come on our brothers hey let's get in my hand man good morning saints good to be a christian ain't it amen first time i ever heard this song it moved me so much i just said i am identified with that and with the words in that song i mean it moved me like no other song man don't you just love it when the lord touches your heart amen i just wanted to read a scripture real quick this morning matthew i believe 28 20 says teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen aren't you glad for that brother branham said in the unwelcome christ he said let this morning be the morning that i'm going all the way for christ now i've got to get there [Music] started on this journey many years ago [Music] i've seen a lot of things while traveling to and fro [Music] well i've been through the storm [Music] and sometimes all i try to do it just seems to be in vain but one thing i know for sure i'm gonna get my starry crown [Music] cause i've done come this far and i just can't turn around [Music] with the things i have to do you may not understand but my main concern that i'm in the master's [Applause] i'm place all the way [Music] well i could care less [Music] [Music] cause i made the lord a promise that if he would lead the way [Music] loose and let it all go now cause i've made up in my mind but i'm going all the way [Music] listen to these words satan comes around [Music] playing with my mind [Music] but i've got a job to do [Music] i can't afford to waste my time [Music] where he pretends to be my friend and he pretends to be so kind [Music] my [Music] [Applause] i'm going all the way [Music] [Applause] what the world may do [Music] cause i made the lord a promise that if he would lead the way i told him i'd follow and after all that i've been through i'd be a fool to turn it loose and let it all go now cause i've made up in my mind i'm going all the way i'm going all the way i'm going all the way [Applause] hey man stand with me man i think the lord deserves another hand amen how many minds and hearts are ready for the word amen this thing because he lives and i can face tomorrow because he lives [Music] i can face tomorrow [Applause] [Music] because he lives [Music] all fear is gone [Music] the future [Music] and life is worth the living just because he lives offering this morning [Music] my future [Applause] is worth the living just because [Music] [Music] because he lives [Music] all fear is gone [Music] [Music] my [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] great you all in the name of the lord today amen beautiful day we are thankful to the lord for his grace and his mercy and our lives amen amen praise the lord you know brother branham said that the beauty of any church is the character of its people i'm looking at a very beautiful congregation today let's pray [Music] lord we're so grateful to you now i've got a duty before me and i've got to preach and i don't have time lord to let my emotions get all in the way lord but i'm in my heart i'm just so grateful just so grateful what a beautiful people what a beautiful atmosphere i've stepped into lord father we're so often such terrible sinners and you're so merciful and kind to us to help us cleanse us today lord give us fresh anointing start with the start with me go all the way through the congregation we fail you too often lord and we don't want to see that in our lives father that's why we come to church it's why we have the word oh my am i so glad for that because i know that it has power it has power lord to bring us to that position in christ has power to make us what we need to be i have no power lord but your word has all power so we're grateful to you help us today lord may you be kind and affectionate toward our needs we commit ourselves into your hands i'm thoroughly satisfied that i have your will in the word today i have your mind captured what a thing what a thing to be able to capture the mind of god and know his will for the moment lord i completely surrender myself into your hands my gratitude is i find i'm insufficient in my words to express my gratitude to you for your word in this hour for your love and kindness to us we commit ourselves into your hands lord we believe that you do all things well amen we commit now lord the remainder of this service and the balance of our day into your hands in jesus name amen amen god bless you friends we're going to look right in colossians this morning amen praise the lord you love him my i sure love him amen praise god we had a number of requests for luther did those get prayed over i sent them to you and brother anthony did you get those okay we'll i'll take them when i uh when i after we read our text amen they came in to me um all right let me get booted up here yeah i'll get those so we're finding um in colossians chapter four today one short simple verse amen colossians chapter 4 you have it say amen one verse verse 5 walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time and i had um these requests that came to me brother kenneth johnson writes my wife's aunt cheryl has asked that we pray for her family they were visiting tucson when their vehicle broke down their truck has been thorough has been through thousands of dollars of repair over the past three weeks and they have run out of funds and the mechanics still don't know what is wrong with it they are asking that god would intervene in this situation my i've had the lord do that for me so many times friends so many times i've learned i constantly tell people you got car trouble lay hands on your car pray for it physically man i've done it you don't know how many times i blew an engine one time i was out of town murfreesboro tennessee how many hours away is that and uh lost a motor and uh i mean completely it i'm not saying in my opinion i too it went to the shop and they said sorry sir you're gonna need a new engine that's just let go well i have any money for a new engine and i had to get home i laid my hands on that truck and in the name of jesus i prayed for it and drove it all the way home sold it a year later and i still see that truck driving it's still on the road that thing may run until the till the rapture amen it's already running on supernatural power anyway and so so you know and then i i had another car one time where it gave up the ghost and and i i i was just gonna send it to the junk pile and i just said you know i i just laid hands on that car and i said lord i don't know what to do i'm poor i have no money and my family had little children man offered me just out of the blue just offered me 500 cash money for and it was a sled and you know it it was an old pontiac and so it was already well let me not let me not condemn gm lovers hey man amen that car i love that car it's very pretty but uh it was it was a thing wouldn't fall out of a tree it had a grenade motor in it and so it uh but the lord the lord will do that so how many gonna pray i don't know what these these people's names are but this is her um his brother kenneth's wife it's her aunt cheryl so i'm going to pray you can't imagine the faith i'm going to pray with amen i want you to pray with that same faith sister chastity says please have the church pray for me i woke up with the uti symptom this morning very painful um sisters know how to enter in onto that of all ages amen um i got a praise report from my sister-in-law uh karen white what did i do with it uh oh yeah here we go please report that mama seems to be doing a whole lot better this sister debbie's mother um she didn't seem he's doing a whole lot better just pray she keeps getting better and better until she can walk on her own again amen i have just you know i mean the she's if she goes home tomorrow she's going to be a happy person and uh the christian never dies but i just might take her tonight for all i know but none of our lives are guaranteed we're guaranteed to live until the lord's finished with us but hey i mean i've just felt in my heart that wow she should have some more years left in her and we love her and i want to see the lord bring her back to a good quality of life so we pray for that as well amen praise the lord all right we've read our verse let's just pray over these needs and we'll let you be seated father in the name of the lord jesus christ we're sending prayer to this situation lord i'm not there to lay my hands on that truck but i've seen what you'll do lord i laid my hands on vehicles multiple times and watched you come on the scene now father we're we're as it were we're joining with you and joining with them and our faith now lord heal this truck yes heal this truck lord we don't need mechanics to figure it out you know what's wrong lord bless your children you promised you'd be a present help in time of trouble now lord we're asking this in jesus name we're asking for our own sister chastity today lord that you lay your hands of healing upon her father and may she be well this very day we thank you for touching our sister linda lord and we're asking humbly lord keep it up would you just keep going with it lord bring her back to strength and help father we ask this of thee and bless the reading of your word and the hearer speaker and hearers in jesus name amen god bless you can be seated amen all right make sure i didn't miss anything um well um okay so i was trying to actually figure that out and i'm not sure okay there it goes a little further all right all right all right yes sir all right i think but the digs maybe had it put back anyway praise the lord oh you love the lord my we want to just get into his word today i'm very glad to be at this portion of it i'm we're we're continuing to work on you know what is the church of god and uh this would be i think part five um that i've ministered here we ministered a little bit of it in in phoenix last weekend the lord is just seeming to bless my heart and thank you for the tony uh continuing to bless my heart in it we've been on it since actually uh the latter part of last year we started on it before our watch nights are not our watch night but our communion and foot washing service on the last night and we've carried on into this new year and uh the lord has more to say um i thought i might finish it today i don't know i don't think i will we're not gonna try i'm just gonna go to an allotted time and then we'll pull the shoot and stand on the brakes and amen we don't well i never like to over tax your mind because then you forget things that you get over sponge and you you lose what the main thing i wanted you to remember and uh you know i remember years ago many years ago when i was just starting out uh brother biscuit giving me some advice as a young minister and he said you know he's always over the years he was always astonished to see such a lack of wisdom in some ministry that when it's obvious the people are done they're saturated they can't and they just keep going keep going keep going keep going and like brother dale says there's no death worse than being drugged to death amen so we don't want to drag you this morning but we do want to look into the word of god amen so i ended last time and i uh in part four by reminding you that you know we have choices to make um you know and god does things for us and he has intent for our life and god god intends good for his family do you believe that he doesn't intend evil god sometimes the world looks upon that so upside down god doesn't take pleasure in uh in corrective measures he does it out of love because he's trying to make you into a better uh version of himself all right and so you know i was i was testifying to the brothers uh in the in the men's breakfast yesterday are there somewhere i don't remember i ministered too often i never remember where i say things but how that you know i was thinking along the lines of this sermon and in my in my quest you know to be to be everything that god wants me to be and i i don't want to excuse me i don't want to find myself coming up short of everything god intends do you know you can do that see god can have a will for you but brother branham is very clear on that you can actually uh lose out and the bible calls it forsaking your own mercies and a lot of times god can have something for you you remember when the prophet in the old testament comes before the king i think it was elisha i believe and he he says to the king he says you know take your your bow and arrow and your quiver of arrows and strike it on the ground and he and the king just you know he's he's so lukewarm amen he's gonna obey the prophet okay he's a prophet i guess i better obey him but he's so lukewarm in his life that he just whacks the ground three times and stops and lays it down okay i obeyed you i obeyed the letter of what you said you said do it i did it now what and the prophet was angry and said oh you should have struck the ground five or six times because you were poised to completely eliminate the enemy and now all you're going to get is three victories you struck it three times you're gonna get three victories what the king couldn't realize is is that his actions were a message to god on what he thought about god's word how he respected god's prophet standing in front of him excuse me my medication chokes me up in the morning i apologize and so you know your zeal matters it's not just being pleasing to god it can help you see but when you live a lukewarm life that's that's not just unpleasing to god because first of all it's insulting to him after all he does for us see as as if you are able to sustain your life and bless yourself uh but god you owe god everything and that he has given you the greatest treasure the pearl of great price and has given you the word not only just a word but the word of the hour i'm going to tell you something friends our life should be a constant rejoicing to god should never take him for granted never be nonchalant when the word comes to speak to you don't don't undervalue what god is trying to do in your life we're speaking on kingdom principles today and i've said to you last time and times before that there should be kingdom principles to every facet of your life because i proved you and i don't i'm not going to do it again today i've proved it several times we are in a kingdom atmosphere that this that this seventh seal has opened has now begun the age of the kingdom and it is going to culminate with you being changed into bodies like the kingdom but right now our minds should already be thinking kingdom thoughts our our activities to god should already have kingdom obedience kingdom zeal because i'm here to tell you god has kingdom power available to you amen i'm preaching the most dangerous sermon satan ever didn't want you to hear i'm trying to get you to understand that you're in a kingdom now and that your kingdom children and and and satan wants to keep you uh unaware of that he wants to bog you down and fog up your mind so that you lose sight of that and you start living like an earthling you start living like a laodicean and that's not why you're here amen so so i i showed you how that calvary proved the lord's intent and desire for fallen man i don't think god needs to prove anything else once jesus because of that day on calvary god should have nothing to prove to you he shouldn't have to prove that he loves you amen amen he shouldn't have to prove that he hears your prayers he shouldn't have to prove and demonstrate and shake you and quiver you and show signs in the heaven and and in the earth and and make all kinds of things so you would so you go well i guess he really is thinking about me and really loves me calvary proved that completely [Applause] improved god's intent for your life it proved that his desire for you is to live in victory so i ended last time by telling you that the only choice to be made is yours because you already know his amen the world is designed by satan to take away from you all things given by god and intended for your good i want to make that statement again the world that that is designed by satan he's the god of this age that's unique he never was that it's this age paul made that clear brother branham when he preaches god of this evil age brother branham goes into paul's language and says paul here is showing you you have arrived uniquely the church has never faced this hour where satan is the god of the age see you are now living in satan's eden this is why god would need to bring kingdom authority to you and go ahead and start pulling you into kingdom power and kingdom thinking and kingdom kingdom zeal otherwise you won't survive satan's eden you might make it in heaven you might make it in a rapture but you'll trip and stumble over the line and barely you know you'll fall down on your face and just have to extend a hand over the goal line to get to get credit for it i don't want to do that i want to charge over the line i want to be running full steam hallelujah the world is designed by satan to take away the world order is designed i don't mean the earth i mean the cosmos the world order is designed by satan to take away from you all things that are given to you by god that are intended for your good the word is here as a countermeasure for you to live by see and and may i say not just live by but i want to introduce you i'm going to change one word and i'm going to introduce a whole new level to you by just changing one word i'm even going to shorten the word no i won't shorten it same same amount of letters it's not just for you to live by but live in amen i'll explain that brother brown i'm going to use brother brethren to explain what i mean by that here in a minute understand this that satan has a playbook with your name on it i i said to the teenagers particularly but it really goes to everyone that when satan comes and brings a thought to your mind just understand there's a plan with that thought he doesn't he's not just you know just you know he's not it's not a fishing expedition just trying to give you a thought trying to give you a thought trying to give you thought he's got a plan if he can get when that thought comes if he can get you to take it already know he's got this big plan behind that see and so satan has a playbook with your name on it and it's a plan his playbook is a plan for how to take you out of the game now he doesn't have to kill you he can't kill you until god's done with you you're immortal amen but his plan is to take you out of the game it's he doesn't have to kill you all he's got to do is just eliminate you from operating any power of god against him amen and he's that's all he needs if he can just bring your life under under certain trials or certain anxieties or certain entertainments or certain pleasures or certain visions or certain goals or certain objectives certain motives even if the goals plans objectives aren't sinful in and of themselves if you you actually have the ability because you're made in the image of god you can take something that's not sinful and make it sinful because it's anything that that in the pursuit of you lose sight of your main reason for being here and having life to begin with amen please remember that young people remember that as you pursue careers in education and friends and family and marriage and everything all virtuous things no problem people think brother branham was against education that is not correct brother branham was against education becoming a detriment to your faith see said that you just understand that education civilization just so you get it just so you know it's all over the devil heaven will have civilization it'll have education brother brandon said it's an education so much higher a civilization so much beyond this one uh that it this won't even even be comparable now i hope i got everybody's attention please i've spent a lot of hours many many many hours please keep me give me your undivided attention i'm not a long preacher so you owe it to me all right so the word is here is a countermeasure he's trying to do anything he can to to eliminate you from operating the any power of god against him now i said to you that you don't his word is a counter-measure not just to live by but to live in i'm understanding gee that this that this is good i'm going to cycle it off and then cycle it back on you should work by the george all right so let's have my powerpoint uh up on the screen i'm trying to go very studiously and methodically today and trying to trying to keep the order of things all right so what is the church of god part five let's see if i can advance all right kingdom order in how many things marriage finances friendships education life [Music] there should be a kingdom order that you live in a kingdom order in every facet of your life remember the composer knows the end from the beginning that i love this sermon one of my favorite from shalom 1964. remember the composer knows the end from the beginning he knows all about it that's the reason he could write it there now i'm showing you how to not just live by not merely by but in all right he that's the reason he could write it here correctly now you must begin with him you must begin if if you want to hear a symphony you must begin with him like in the music at the symphony you you listen you know what it says it's it's going to be what the symphony is see and then you begin to listen at the music and you know what it is so you know just about here's where certain certain things take place now it's got to change all right now this is an important instruction because you're not there to just be entertained when you go and you hear a symphony or you know you go to an opera whatever it's very helpful if you know the story behind it and you know the changes in the music and you can actually sit there and anticipate a coming change and and and you know what you know what you're doing you've entered in you're not just a spectator you see you're not just hearing music you're actually now participating in it this is how your christianity is amen this is how your life in the holy ghost should operate see you know god you know the sheep music you've read it you know where the changes are coming when you come to church and you hear a certain angle you know where god's headed and you cannot even before the preacher can say it sometimes you're already rejoicing amen how many times i've seen people get ahead of the preacher because they know where this is going because they've studied it in contra distinction come on on this you can also go to church and hear the preachers start going down the line and you kind of go oh boy okay i know where this is going amen but even that's for your good see watch and you know what it is so you know just about here's where certain certain things take place now it's got to change so that's another advantage in the sheet music because brother brennan said we're not just building a wall we're building a building and sometimes there has to be a junction and a turn and if you miss that you'll just go on off building a wall that's what denominations have done that's what organized religion does it just keeps going this is what we believe we're set okay let's just start laying brick and then they get down to a prophecy and the prophecy says hang left and they just keep on going and some of them been building those walls for four five six seven eight hundred years and they never got any of the building built because they just built one wall and they never caught the next messenger said you should have turned back there see all right so you this is your life you can't just you're not just going through life going through it god has markers that he wants you to pay attention to and make changes remember therefore you're good people wonder why their life gets into chaos and they don't take the time to look at how far off of god's kingdom principles they're out in the field somewhere and they've lost their bearings they don't even have the north star guiding them anymore they're just going in circles what's wrong with my life what's happening in my children i don't understand my marriage i don't understand my finances i don't understand my church what's going on and all you're doing is going in a circle going a circle going in a circle you're unstable it's a sign of double-mindedness your faith has not become settled on the word that god puts you here for a purpose and he has a purposed plan for your life and the only way you'll know his success that he desires for you is to walk in that plan and that requires that you stay in constant contact you have to stay in prayer you have to stay in church you have to stay in your bible you have to stay in the tapes you have to hear you have to you have to fellowship with god prayer is not just prayer is not sitting on santa claus lap giving him your list prayer you go somewhere in prayer prayer you're somewhere else it takes you to another place where you have fellowship with almighty god see this is what brings control in your life this is what gives you power over your own spirit because your spirit's not con not converted your spirit is managed eventually it'll be changed you'll get a theophany but this spirit was not given to you by god it was only permitted by god because of the because of the principles of life see father met mother and child was produced that's nature all right so you're born in a fallen nature so this spirit that you have is not it it has to be brought subject to the word amen so this is why the bible says whatsoever things are pure think on these things whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report think on these things what do i do with vain imaginations cast them down don't entertain them get control of your solomon said that a man with no control over his spirit is like an unwalled city where the enemy can just come in and out and there's nothing to keep the enemy out he's walking in the middle of the night and wreck everything kill people in their sleep see and so you know when you we we a lot of times if we're not careful we just put things off too well you know like brother branham said you know i was i was i was irish on my dad's side and so he had a hot irish temper like sister dorothy i'm only saying what her grandson said okay i've got authority i'm only saying i'm only repeating don't shoot the messenger and so but and brother branham that that bent that bend in his in his strain caused him to have a hot temper he took a rifle and tried to kill boys with it tried to murder him and the mercy of god spared him 15 bullets snapped and then as soon as the boys were out of danger all all shells fired wasn't remington's fault it was the holy spirit's fault see and so so we find brother matt was talking at the men's breakfast yesterday about you know the young man that had the his his mother on his mother's side his dad on his daddy's side he was irish because his brother branham's brother and this is his nephew and he had he he was arrogant he even when he was wrong the young man he wouldn't apologize for anything he hurt his fiancee's feelings and did something terrible and he wouldn't repent he was like you know stuck he's like i'm not apologizing to you you know he had some chauvinistic idea of mannett i don't know but brother branham talks about that was in the mother's side that german strain he said they just won't apologize they're not they won't be cordial they're not friendly they won't even respond you they're condescending not the germans as a people because you take people like brother gerd wrote a walden brother marcus becker who we know here was some of those wonderful people in the world but what makes them like that the holy ghost made them like that and so brother branham says now to the husband to the to the dad which is his brother says now look at your side look at your side of the family all of them killers drunks shoot shooting cutting fighting and he said but you're not like that he said why the holy spirit took that see and he said to the mother now your family is arrogant and uppity and they won't repent won't apologize but you're not like that what did that the holy spirit see that you you now have the holy spirit strain you're not living by your natural strain amen there's value in letting the holy ghost control your life and and and so that's why brother brown says we live after the life of our rebirth the land of our rebirth see i don't i don't live here the way i was born i've been changed amen we sing about it i've been changed i've been reborn now all my life has been rearranged what a difference it makes when the lord has his way amen and so you know we we we talk about strains and habits and well and then a lot of times people people can blame their habits on well this happened to me in my childhood uh this i'm only like this because what somebody did to me but just remember this friends that what whatever kind of spirit is is controlling you brother branham said habits are spirits say oh i can't you know um i have a habit of of lusting no you don't have a habit of lusting you have a spirit of lusting that's anointing you now maybe it got its inroad somewhere back in your life but god has sent a word for you to conquer that say oh you know i i got angry no you didn't get angry you fell victim to a spirit of anger oh i'm just depressed no you're under the anointing of a spirit of depression but whom the son makes free is free indeed you have you have the word to govern your kingdom life amen so brother branham goes on so glad for a prophet man i wouldn't know none of this stuff if it wasn't for william branham watch this now to anybody else that don't know nothing about what they just walked in and sat down it's just a bunch of nonsense rattling noise but the one who knows what it is see isn't amazing that this is to you is is poetry to another it's rattling noise to you this is a symphony one of the greatest pieces of work ever to others it's just a noise they can't make heads or tails of it they misinterpret the intention of the author and everything all right but to the but the one who knows what it is it's beat out with the music see that when brother branham saw those sainted bunch of little girls they were marching to a beat something like onward christian soldiers the false church was also marching to a beat of rock and roll because the the the trinity doctrine and rock and roll are the two things civil and ecclesiastic powers on this nation that will that that influences the world see so so the three unclean spirits like frogs in the book of revelation so that trinity doctrine is the religious angle that lead that connects people to rome which is connected to ancient babylon amen that's rudimentary but then rock and roll is the spirit that connects all of the all of the people socially and i can tell you as a world traveler american worldly music rock rap country whatever it is it it joins all nations and every culture i've ever been in ever ever have ever been i've been in all of them six of the seven continents and i'm here to tell you that that ungodly music rhythm and beat makes the whole world brothers and sisters see that's why we have to be careful in our worship service god christian lyrics does not a christian song make amen remember remember music and worship were not in creation they predate creation before god ever created the earth music and worship already existed in heaven it didn't get created in creation it was already there satan was the uh the the conductor of it lucifer was oh keep getting pulled off but it's important stuff so it's beat out with the music drummed out with the notes it's trumpeted with the trumpets it's strung on the harp it's played with the violin it's beat on the bass this is your life it's sounded by the trumpets it's beat on the drums onward christian soldiers marching as to war and one group went off the abyss and brother branham said the awfulest screams you ever heard but that other group instead of going down they started going up i'm here to tell you there's a kingdom rhythm there's a kingdom beat to the word it's got a kingdom people marching in the rhythm of the gospel and satan is already descending and you are already ascending see it's the order of things and so the whole thing together in rhythm now watch this and it makes the drama till you can close your eyes and live in it see so this kingdom word is not just to live by otherwise it's just a denominational list of do's and don'ts it's a box it's not just to live by it's to live in see this is why my angle of pastoring doesn't try to force you into a box of living by rules but i'm trying to get you to live in something i'm trying to get you to enter into a shekinah presence that's among us that's here to be a guide to your life man could close his mortal eyes to earthly sight and live in the presence of jesus christ now you're not going to live very effectively in the presence of jesus christ unless you close your eyes to earthly mortal sight it's like the bible says you know resist the devil and he'll flee from you amen great everybody loves that one but everybody forgets the first part of it submit yourselves unto god resist the devil and he'll flee from you no one has ever successfully resisted the devil until they first submitted themselves to god resist the devil is not not a a spell it's not an amulet you wear it's not a it's not a a charm it's a principle of god's word submit yourselves to god resist the devil and he will flee from you watch same principle man could close his mortal eyes to earthly sight and live in the presence of jesus christ when you see his word being beat out in the great symphony that we're living in now changing you must begin in the symphony the only thing you can do if you're in the symphony then you start you begin to get into the rhythm oh i i tell you as a as a pastor sometimes can i darken that as a pastor sometimes say what is what is what are you doing what's this sermon really about i'm trying to get you in a rhythm amen i'm trying to get your life to match the rhythm of this i'm trying to sink you synchronize you with this so that your life looks like this remember friends this the whole purpose of this is to not be needed amen when you're in a rapture and you're in glory you won't need this say my bible this is your third bible this is the third bible this is the third iteration the first one was in the stars the second one was in the pyramid this is the third one brother branham said when the books are closed for the last time the word will be flesh the whole purpose of this is to get behind your skin and live a lived life that's why jesus didn't carry a bible he was the word amen all right when you become part all right that's the way um yeah okay well right here that's the way you do you don't stand off and look at it you get into the rhythm of it how do you get in there you're born into it into the rhythm of the word when you become part of that word you have to become part of the word to know god's symphony see it's not learned intellectually all right his symphony is when it's playing oh i love that his symphony is when it's playing you understand you're marching with the beat of the time so his symphony god has a symphony operating not when you're just standing afar off you might even be believing it but you're just looking at it amen you might even believe god sent a prophet you might even believe everything i'm preaching but until you actually be willing to step forward and get into it then it's not a symphony yet not for you see that's he says you're marching with the beat of the time this is what the devil don't want you're watching for it the works that i do shall you also greater than this shall you do these last days oh my the great changing over the time we get into the beat beat of the word see find his purpose the hour that we're living get into the rhythm of it how he does it how he does it get into the rhythm of it how he does it i'm gonna i'm gonna give you a few examples i hope you got seat belts on today i'm gonna get this isn't ambiguous god has very clear examples we're about to look at some of them amen it's only gonna be for believers if you're not a believer feel free to check your email or think about a job tomorrow because i'm going to go into some things that are just for believers but they're very specific on what it means to get into the rhythm of it all right not just have a mental ascent and believe it saying amen means let it be in every facet of my life that's what saying amen means it's not just mental agreement so he says we get into the beat of the word for find his purpose the hour that we're living get into the rhythm of it how he does it if you get into the word you find out how he did it at the beginning we're gonna find out how he does it amen now you won't hold that against me will you i'm not telling you how i do it i don't know if yeah if i make you into me you're going to be a wreck i'm i'm going to show you how he does it how many believers will obey how he does it all right two-thirds of you thank you all right the rest of you you check your email or think about a job tomorrow all right if you get into the word you find out how he did it at the beginning then you know how he's doing it all the time wow that's so easy if you find out how he did at the beginning then you know how he's doing it all the time you know why because he doesn't change amen now take that down gee and get ready for some scriptures all right so let me make my adjustment here all right now you remember last time or time before i don't remember now and i told you we we comment about how people i get it i totally get it i'm the same way we love high octane preaching we love deep dark lofty mysteries and you know rocket fuel burning styles and but some you know space shuttle stuff uh you know uh spacex stuff you know but but when it comes back down to earth where i think i said you know where the rubber tires of the space shuttle meet the road of the runway see then then you know that that's a landing strip and here's where it can get a bit tough or as the book of revelation let me let me use let me use its description it gets a little bitter in our belly all right so as i said you're welcome to be excused if you're not a believer because this is only going to be for believers all right so gideon let's start with we're going to start with a kingdom order for a church now i'm only going to read one there's so many i could read i'm only going to touch on one because the one i felt anointed to touch on weeks ago psalms 100 give me psalms 100 g man and we're gonna just catch these first five verses now what are we on kingdom order for a church all right all right read along with me it's right here on the screen sit in church like a knot on a log it's oh i'm sorry i'm sorry all right let me try it again verse one come to church in a crabby mood all your lands why are y'all laughing what's so funny this is a kingdom order for a church okay i'm not i don't think i can get that one give me go to verse two gideon i'll give up verse two all right let's try verse two serve the lord with sourness come before him with a stinky attitude what am i doing wrong okay serve the lord with gladness come before his presence with singing verse 3 know ye that the lord he is god it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pasture verse 4 enter into his gates with hallelujah and into his courts with hallelujah be thankful unto him and bless his name amen amen for the lord is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations in case you didn't get a chance to obey that today how many would it like to raise up hands and say thank you lord thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy in my life let's look at some kingdom order in our home you afraid of that one get in let's go to the next psalm psalms 101 we'll catch these first three verses i will sing of mercy and judgment this is in the hole now you're going to see that in a minute i will sing of mercy and judgment unto thee o lord will i sing i will behave myself wisely in a perfect way oh when wilt thou come unto me i will walk within my house with a perfect heart how do you how do you how do you accomplish that verse three i set no wicked thing before my eyes i hate the work of them that turn aside it shall not cleave to me oh that ought to be a determination in our heart to say it will not cleave to me i'm not here to be part of the world i'm here to be different than the world i need my home to be different than the world we need our church to be different than just a standard christian so-called church we're here with the living presence of the living god among us see let's look at kingdom order walking the earth among our fellow man let's stay in that same psalm get him we're going to catch verses 4 4-7 i believe a froward heart shall depart from me i will not know a wicked person who so privately privately slandereth his neighbor him will i cut off him that hath a high look and a proud heart will i will not i suffer this is this now this is this is who the friend kind of friends you should have see mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land that they may dwell with me he that walketh in a perfect way he shall serve me he that this is god now speaking to the church you say i don't know if i want to be like that i'm reading you how god said he is so make your choice you don't want to be like him okay but if you want to be like him he says mine eyes shall be upon the faithful and they that they may dwell with me he that walketh in a perfect way he shall serve me he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight amen amen you know so so what would the opinion of your neighbors be is that the kind of life you live what about your work associates what about your your school chums would that be the opinion they have of you when they say you're different do they mean you you girls just always wear dresses and you boys just don't do this and all that do they miss means some some set of rules or do they mean something more than that they'll say there's something about you that's different something that should be in you that creates a craving for them brother rome was giving his testimony here he is in a non-religious family no no inclination to any of that his whole life any and he meets a young sister from canada at a church in georgia mississippi and there's just something about her and he's like wow now they they never became romantic don't think that it just some they became friends and there was something in her life that said you know what it was a deep started calling to a deep he didn't even know he's the son of god there was a seed done in there and her life she had no clue she was living a christian life she and suddenly she's got he you know they talk on the phone and she's got brother brandon playing in the background i wish i wish more boys would call more girls with brother brandon playing in the background and you know where he started who's that she wasn't shy you know where it ended up hey turn that up they're talking hey turn it up how you been today yeah turn it up yeah turn it up yeah you've been good yeah i've been good i mean the whole and now then it goes that's a see she's seeding something in his heart and now he can't get to mississippi and so you know what he does in savannah his home he starts listening to tapes he doesn't even know oh anything about a message church he calls voice to god says i i we i need somebody that preaches according to william branham they said the closest church to you is in beaufort south carolina pastor jason watkins go there he shows up here he's ready to be baptized you know what did that prophet's voice it affected a young lady see and and and that's that's the best way if you want to affect your friends affect them by letting the word live through you see if you're let me say something to you if you're not doing that young person then you say oh i i care about this person i want to see if i can win them you're hindering them amen you're actually blocking you're effectively blocking god because god won't operate in triangles it's not you and her and him it's not sister it's not you and him and god god god would assembly turn away and walk away from that until you get yourself out of the way and let god speak to that person otherwise you're in the way hindering the situation amen amen so so we find then that that we let's go to colossians brother gideon uh colossians chapter four this is our text this is where we read our text am i good on time i'm not too good but i'm okay okay all right i'm only gonna go so far i won't i won't try to won't try to press it here's our text colossians 4 5. is this good kingdom principles kingdom life verse 5 colossians 4 5 walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time now this this this term redeeming the time is from a very specific greek word i'm not even going to attempt to pronounce it it's like 20 letters long but it means buy up time it means make the most of time see so that's from bible knowledge commentary and and the ivp bible background commentary if you want the reference it means to buy up the time redeem the time buy it up make the in other words not that you can purchase more time but use your time wisely make the most of the time we've we preached you here some some weeks ago back last year that that time time is the most valuable thing in the world time is more valuable than money amen you can make more money but you can't make more time see and so too often we forget that this life is temporary and actually very brief amen amen we forget that too often and and and in doing so we fail to organize our limited supply of time effectively amen let's look at it again in ephesians five get in ephesians five and we'll catch verses 14 through 17. wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give the light see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time now you already know what that is redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be you not unwise but understand what the will of the lord is remember brother branham was showing us that in shalom you've got to know him to know his will you got to enter into the symphony see so now there's two distinct parts leave that up leave uh leave verse 16 up gee uh redeeming the time because the days are evil so there's two distinct parts to see here involving time i'm going to cover them easy all right firstly there is a command for redeeming of time amen it's not just a mere recommendation it's actually the second time paul uses it this is a kingdom principle for all of those in the kingdom you need to make sure that you're using your very brief and limited supply of time effectively how do i do that by letting god have control of it you shouldn't spend one word i remember years ago and it's not in my notes it comes to my mind must be the lord i remember years ago brother doris tidwell when he he's dead and gone now but when his wife died and he was still alive and brother doris came and preached a wonderful man brother terry tubal's dad but james did was dad michael tidwell some of you younger ones know michael but it was his grandfather and brother dars came and brother dars was just preaching and he started talking about regrets and his wife had just been gone maybe a few months and he just stopped and started to tear up and he said you young couples he's an old man now he said don't ever say a a hard word to that mate he said you can't believe the regret you have he said don't ever waste a moment don't ever fail to say i love you don't ever fail to show your affection he said life is so over so quickly and there's no way to go back and fix it amen so finally so firstly there is a command for redeeming the time now this usage of this word time is actually used in a way to to evoke a consideration of your priorities you still with me is this easy all right i'm not going too fast i hope so the the usage of this word time is to evoke a consideration in within you of your priorities all right secondly it is it is brought home by the following by usage of the following term because the days are evil amen so like daniel who when daniel looked around in his life and looked at the world and looked at egypt and i mean israel in captivity daniel said i started studying the books of prophecy i started reading back through and he said i learned by the study of books i learned by the prophecy of prophets that so that 70 years are determined and that that this captivity should be over in 70 years because daniel's not the one who gave the prophecies jeremiah said you'll be there 70 years and now they're daniel looked at that now you say well you know he was bored and had nothing to do no no daniel knew that the hour of their deliverance was getting close and he thought i need to go and see exactly how close we are and when he did he said we're only going to be here 70 years wow we're getting ready to go home and everybody else is like you're crazy we're prisoners here we'll never get out of here alive no no no i'm telling you we're getting ready to leave here i can look at modern events made clear by prophecy and i can tell you we're getting ready to leave here hallelujah amen like daniel we study prophecy and we understand that there is to be at the end time a raging conflict between good and evil and so the apostles thought then that we read here his thought is that we have a participating responsibility in this conflict redeem the time because the days are evil so we've been identified that we're near we're at that time we're in this kingdom time it's a it's a it's a global titanic spiritual warfare between good and evil and the the apostle paul is trying to get us to understand we're supposed to have a participating function we have a responsibility to be kingdom saints to operate kingdom power to have kingdom thinking not not thinking according to my strain in my family or my past life or what happened to me you know or what the devil and my fear and my anxiety nonsense friends we're kingdom people the devil has no power to hold you unless brother brethren says he has no power the jesus took every power from him and the only thing he's got left the only weapon he has left is if he can get you to doubt your weapon this is psychological warfare you need to win it see if you allow satan to get by with it friends i'm going to tell you something if you allow him to get by with it he'll fill up your life with any and all things to mute your awareness to blunt your awareness of this spiritual reminder that you are to redeem the time you're to buy it up you're to use it wisely because it's got a limited supply and we're almost home see we're we're warned to be alert to his lurking therefore it matters what we give our time to it matters as to the course and direction we set for our lives so the reference to time here is something then it's uh i think you'd all agree it's a bit more uh than just observing uh standard earth time that you measure on a calendar or a wrist watch you know since the days of the upper room in the book of acts the family of god measures where time is measured to god's family as kingdom time see prophetic time because after all i'm not i'm not an american i don't operate solely on eastern standard time i mean my whole life isn't isn't based on utc minus five you know i'd be whatever the coordinated universal time is for wherever you live i'm a child of the king i run on kingdom time see i operate my life on kingdom time i set my life's priorities according to kingdom time see and so and and david has taught us that the king's business requireth haste let me say to you today if there's some spirit got you bound you need to get free now you don't need to wait you need to get free now you need to hurry hurry and get on with god's kingdom plan and quit chasing your own dreams see oh can i have the 12 more minutes and i'll let you out at the top of the hour gideon let's go to proverbs 6 and we'll just catch a few verses here 9 through 11. how long proverbs did i say 6. proverbs chapter 6 verses 9 10 and 11 how long wilt thou sleep o sluggard when will thou arise out of thy sleep yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding over the hands to sleep so shall thy poverty come as one that travaileth and thy one as an armed man i think that must have been brother eddie's favorite verse in the whole bible he used to say that to me and anybody will listen all the time you know i i i think and i think in plan in kingdom time that's how i operate i think about kingdom time you know that's how we should do it i can tell you that's god's intention that's his purpose for you to do it we hear so much and about brother branham would say and you've heard it i know you've heard it as many times as i have probably that that if the the the the the tree of life that started in the book of acts if it ever puts forth another branch they'll write another book of acts behind it amen amen that's what he said write another book of acts behind it see so the bride is to write another book of acts because we have the same kingdom message you have the same token that paul was preaching you've been restored to the same abstract deed that paul had you've got the same jubilee that they enjoyed in the upper room see but to remember this friends please remember what i'm about to tell you if you forget everything else i've said the book of acts that you read in your bible is a chronicle of accumulated accomplishments amen see the book of acts was written only because the apostles acted you get me kingdom accomplishments that began with the outpouring of the holy ghost in the upper room at jerusalem are now a continuation of god's kingdom on earth only now it's in the church amen it's in a pride it's in his body so writing a book of acts for the omega church writing a book of acts hear me when brother branham says the church will write a book of acts behind it writing a book of acts behind this omega church was never intended by brother branham to be an assignment it's a living testimony it's not just something you do it's what you are and that lives itself out and that's a book of acts see it's a it's a book lived uh it's it's it's the lived actions of the last day bride lived out in faith victories over the enemy how many want them it's victories over the enemy where we have allowed christ to accomplish his will in our everyday walking talking life i just say that's for me lord that's i'm right i'm not waiting to write a book of acts i'm already writing a book of acts see amen you're either writing a book of acts or you're writing a book of laodicea amen so when a prophet makes that statement about this bride writing another book of acts behind it it's not a bride waiting for something to fall out of the heavens it's not some new revival to break out your mission today should you choose to accept is to add to your chapters yes amen glory daily right now any time you say amen you're adding to your chapter any time you have a decision to make and here's a decision the enemy wants here's a decision your fallen spirit wants but here's what god wants and you say nope amen that's a book of acts when you say god hold on i you don't know what i've dealt with what i've been through i'm going to stay over here for a while that's the book of laodicea see that's a book of your fallen life and you're not to live by that you live the life of the land of your rebirth where jesus is the king see so not waiting seed not waiting for you to become a perfect christian don't wait on that not waiting for the stars to line up in your life not waiting for some extra blessing to come down on you from god amen amen i'm going to give you a clue i'm going to close with the testimony this and i'm just going to read it to you it's beautiful and i thought it would help you amen we we all know that paul talks about you know you're transformed into what you gaze at what you feed on you become what you gaze at you're transformed into that see so now where's your priorities how often do you turn on a tape in your vehicle or on the job or at night or in your home how often do you sit for hours and just let god speak to you how often do you spend time in prayer for a little while see so this is a mirror and paul said the problem is people come to church they they look in the mirror of god's word and god shows them really what they are wow i got a lot of work to do oh oh man i didn't know he knew that wow you mean i okay lord okay you help me jesus i'll do my best amen this is a mirror and paul said the problem is people leave the church you'll leave here today i promise you well you won't stay here all day people leave this building and completely forget the manner of person that showed them they were when they were in this anointing i see where i'm at i see where i need to be i see what it's going to take to get from here to there okay lord i'm in and then they leave now what was my laodicean plan what was i doing okay which where let me see okay and and they never think about god's plan again until next service if they happen to make it amen all right so here's the testimony of a man doing just that he's looking in the mirror and the man in the mirror said to him i love this man i love this hey you need to you need to get to writing chapters in your life of the book of acts man thought wow something for you to say you need to do it right now a man in the mirror said you need to do it you need to do it right now what what chapters said the man gazing back the chapters you've been writing in your book of acts since the day the lord entered your heart amen i i don't have too many chapters he said so pick up the pace said the mirror get a move on said the mirror well every time i start accomplishing things for the lord i i always end up getting sidetracked well said the mirror don't do that don't do that run the race you really think i can sure you can run the race well i i'm way behind run faster when we're going to stop giving god our excuses i'm way behind we'll run faster what are you waiting on what are you waiting on get moving get running by this time the mirror was screaming there's not another revival coming the time is now look man come on your book of acts already has some chap already has some passages recording it add to them add to them just just go just start just run the finish line is in sight hurry up you've still got time hurry hurry hurry you've still got time the man stood there blinking the mirror's screaming what are you standing here gazing into this mirror get moving so you know what happened you know what happened i i said okay i grabbed my bible i ran out the door got my truck drove here and started preaching you know what i'm doing i'm adding chapters to my book of acts because that man said get a move on hurry up and i said well i i get sidetracked well stop getting sidetracked i don't have that many chapters we'll speed up we're almost home this is kingdom authority this is where we are my friends stand in the mirror of god's word today stand here feet with me and say lord god it's not too late for me i've still got time i want to write new chapters i don't need to wait on anointing i don't need to wait for a perfect atmosphere i don't need to wait for the stars to line up i don't need another revival i can start right now right now lord i can start writing new chapters in my life how do you believe that oh my brother andrew brother anthony sweep over my soul sweep over my soul sweet spirit sweep over my soul listen friends i know you thought i was meaning no it was meaning me i hope it was meaning you i hope you were seeing yourself in my testimony stop standing idly and gazing into the word of god you see what it's calling you see what you need in your life you know you're honest before god won't you bow your heads with me right
