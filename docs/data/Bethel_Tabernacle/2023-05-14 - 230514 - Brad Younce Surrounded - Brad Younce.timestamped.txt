[7:42] good morning God bless you I wanted to
[7:45] just make up
[7:47] quick few words of announcement to you
[7:50] amen we had a
[7:53] wonderful first Sunday school class here
[7:55] this morning so uh
[7:57] I hope to see
[7:59] um definitely seeing a bigger crowd here
[8:01] than when I walked out this morning so I
[8:03] really want to encourage you I'm putting
[8:05] my whole heart and a lot of time and
[8:07] effort into it and so I would highly
[8:10] encourage you to try to make these
[8:13] classes we'd like to see it turned
[8:14] around not just for the time that I will
[8:16] have it but I'd love to see a full full
[8:19] church for the Sunday school and the
[8:21] main service amen you know we don't
[8:24] they're not it's not long and we don't
[8:26] keep you and where are you amen we get
[8:29] out in time we have a wonderful
[8:30] afternoon of Fellowship
[8:32] so I would like to just encourage you to
[8:34] make the effort plan ahead and try to
[8:37] start making the central classes because
[8:39] I'm going to go into some areas that
[8:41] I've had a lot of requests for and I'm
[8:43] looking forward to it I'm also going to
[8:45] do it on an occasional Wednesday night
[8:47] through now from now through June but I
[8:50] have to limit myself to about 30 minutes
[8:52] and I'm under strict doctor's orders not
[8:56] to exert myself so it's not preaching
[8:59] it's teaching and I was getting a little
[9:01] laughed at this morning that I've kind
[9:03] of moved into that and we determined
[9:06] that my problem is the Holy Ghost amen
[9:08] so that's a good problem to have amen I
[9:11] told him I said I was trying to you know
[9:13] you know bring it back and and um I'm
[9:17] not gonna I'm not gonna call any names
[9:19] but her initials are sister Ruth said
[9:21] that she said well you can't you can't
[9:23] limit you can't pull the Holy Ghost down
[9:25] you can't I said well then my problem is
[9:27] the Holy Ghost amen so we determined
[9:29] that was a good problem to have amen I
[9:31] appreciated that so um I went early this
[9:35] morning
[9:36] um the doctor actually wanted to meet me
[9:38] on a Sunday morning she came in to look
[9:39] at my eye again and she said it's doing
[9:42] good and it has it's making progress
[9:44] there's still some pressure in the back
[9:46] of the eye pushing and so she added now
[9:49] a a fourth medication of eye drops to
[9:52] put in my eye to try to reduce that so
[9:55] I'm on multiple antivirals steroids and
[9:58] now this fourth one and um
[10:01] so I covet your prayers I apologize for
[10:04] the sun shades but I I'm not supposed to
[10:06] let a whole lot of light into my eye I'm
[10:09] not supposed to be in the Sun and even
[10:11] these lights here in my screen trying to
[10:13] look at a screen is very difficult so
[10:15] this helps and actually helps quite a
[10:17] bit man when I drive I have to put on
[10:19] another pair and I'm like three pairs of
[10:21] of glasses going down the road it's
[10:23] funny but amen but I see fine it's just
[10:26] um it's just like driving in it at night
[10:30] again but I'm I'm loving uh the Lord for
[10:34] his mercy and I thank you for your
[10:36] prayers and please keep praying prayer
[10:38] Works amen so keep them coming uh as I
[10:43] said she said probably two to six weeks
[10:45] and so I'm just going to try to take the
[10:48] whole six weeks and we've swapped out
[10:51] um the main service and so we'll be
[10:53] using the team for that amen next week
[10:55] the Lord willing will have brother Diggs
[10:57] preaching the main Sunday morning
[10:59] service so we'll be looking forward to
[11:00] that I felt very LED of the Lord this
[11:03] morning to have brother Brad take this
[11:05] morning and the Lord was working on his
[11:07] end as well so I'm looking forward to

[44:01] my life

[44:21] rock and now
[44:24] shall my head be lifted up above my

[52:17] by the blood of Jesus Christ
[52:19] oh Holly we're surrounded we're
[52:22] protected on all sides
[52:25] oh it's like Aaron when he entered into
[52:27] behind the veil
[52:29] when you come in behind the veil through
[52:32] the doors and we enter the sanctuary we
[52:35] enter the presence of God's glory
[52:38] his glory is surrounding us
[52:41] oh hallelujah we're at Shekinah Glory
[52:44] what happens in the Shekinah Glory fire
[52:48] is down falling down behind the veil
[52:51] let's close off the veil from the world
[52:54] and watch the Fire Fall Among Us
[52:58] oh it's a dark day we're living in
[53:02] the pressure of this darkness is so
[53:05] pressing down upon us
[53:07] sometimes we feel like we can even lose
[53:09] our minds
[53:11] I'm so glad it says in the evening time
[53:14] there shall be light
[53:18] that's our hope we're surrounded by
[53:20] light we're like we're like the children
[53:22] of Israel down in Goshen
[53:26] surrounded it was dark in Egypt but they
[53:29] had the light
[53:33] oh
[53:34] it seems that the enemy is surrounding
[53:37] you and coming in for the kill God will
[53:39] send reinforcements
[53:41] what happened to Samson
[53:43] he went into the into Gaza
[53:47] this shows the mercy of God to Samson

[53:53] the city the people in heaven says
[53:56] Samson is here lock the gates don't let
[53:59] him out they had him surrounded
[54:04] so they thought this Tooty little man
[54:07] walks to the gates and picks up the
[54:09] gates and carries them to the top of the
[54:11] mountain
[54:14] one day he was surrounded by a thousand
[54:17] Philistines
[54:21] the anointing of God hit him
[54:26] he had a Nazarite vow
[54:31] what happened to those Philistines every

[55:11] the donkey could see the angel
[55:14] blocking his way every time he tried to
[55:16] go that that donkey bump up
[55:19] against that angel
[55:20] and you can manage that donkey can talk

[1:02:21] there's a firewall around you
[1:02:28] well JD
[1:02:30] there's firewalls on these computers
[1:02:33] they keeping stuff out
[1:02:35] they're protecting the data
[1:02:40] we got a firewall is better than that
[1:02:43] because sometimes things do get through
[1:02:45] those firewalls
[1:02:47] but we got a firewall that nothing can
[1:02:50] go through
[1:02:52] it
[1:02:56] Hallelujah
[1:02:58] that word fire means altar fire
[1:03:03] Hallelujah
[1:03:05] we're altar fire
[1:03:08] Cain and Abel
[1:03:12] was going to bring their sacrifices up
[1:03:15] to the altar
[1:03:16] Cain his revelation
[1:03:20] understanding
[1:03:22] was that the fall was caused by fruit
[1:03:25] so he brought the best he had
[1:03:27] here you go Lord boom
[1:03:30] there's my best
[1:03:34] Abel
[1:03:36] he knew it was fruit
[1:03:40] get what I'm saying
[1:03:42] he knew it was fruit that caused the
[1:03:44] fall
[1:03:46] oh but by Revelation he knew it was
[1:03:48] lambskins that came to redeem them
[1:03:51] I don't know how he knew it
[1:03:54] because when Adam and Eve fell God
[1:03:57] killed a lamb and threw the Skins down
[1:03:58] behind the bushes says get dressed and
[1:04:01] they come out bloody
[1:04:04] so Abel knew something
[1:04:07] that the lamb covered their sin
[1:04:11] so here come Abel he come dragging out
[1:04:14] his best
[1:04:17] he come dragging his best up through the
[1:04:19] aisles of the church
[1:04:21] with a rope around around his neck pull
[1:04:24] this thing in a rock in the other hand
[1:04:26] grabbing that lamb and dragging him up
[1:04:28] there to the altar
[1:04:31] oh you could if you could hear that lamb
[1:04:33] speak he was probably saying not my will
[1:04:36] but thy will be done
[1:04:39] oh Hallelujah Abel picking up that lamb
[1:04:42] and throwing it up on the altar
[1:04:45] taking that rock and start hacking the
[1:04:47] blood hacking the neck of the blood
[1:04:49] squirting out everywhere
[1:04:51] all over him
[1:04:53] oh he was covered by the blood
[1:04:56] all over the altar
[1:04:59] and the last words you could hear that
[1:05:01] lamb say before he died it is finished
[1:05:08] and God has so much respect on that
[1:05:12] sacrifice that the fire fell out of
[1:05:15] heaven
[1:05:16] and consumed it
[1:05:21] what sacrifice we're given
[1:05:25] are we Justified are we Sanctified are
[1:05:28] you filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:05:31] I will go further than that you can be
[1:05:34] filled with a holy ghost have it on
[1:05:36] field on your flesh and spirit every day
[1:05:37] and still die go to hell
[1:05:41] but you gotta have that Holy Fire When
[1:05:45] God says you're a perfect upright man or
[1:05:48] woman
[1:05:49] you've been anointed by the Holy Fire of
[1:05:52] God
[1:05:57] Hallelujah
[1:06:00] you don't Elijah on Mount Carmel
[1:06:03] Oh Glory we know a story
[1:06:07] it ain't going to rain for three days it
[1:06:09] ain't gonna rain until I call for it
[1:06:11] God finally says okay let's go it's time
[1:06:13] for Showdown
[1:06:14] well he tells Ahab you go get your
[1:06:16] prophets of Baal I want you to meet me
[1:06:18] on top of Mount Carmel
[1:06:20] foreign
[1:06:22] God's going to approve by fire who he
[1:06:25] was
[1:06:28] Elijah he comes to the people he said
[1:06:30] how long halt
[1:06:33] ye between two opinions
[1:06:36] how long will you go from one side to
[1:06:38] the other
[1:06:39] they were serving Baal when it was
[1:06:41] convenient then they'd go back to God
[1:06:43] when it's convenient to serve God they
[1:06:45] were back and forth a bunch of
[1:06:47] wishy-washy people kind of reminds me
[1:06:49] what's going on in the message today
[1:06:51] oh
[1:06:52] is this message right is this message
[1:06:54] wrong is this message right brother Brad
[1:06:57] him a false prophet was he a true
[1:06:59] Prophet wishy-washy people no backbone
[1:07:02] about them
[1:07:06] how long will you halt between two
[1:07:09] opinions
[1:07:13] he's I tell you what you do
[1:07:16] if the Lord be God follow him
[1:07:21] if brother Branham be God you follow him
[1:07:24] thank you
[1:07:27] no disrespect to the prophet
[1:07:29] you know what I'm saying
[1:07:31] foreign
[1:07:33] and the people answered him not a word
[1:07:36] they do the same things today
[1:07:38] there's too many fence Sitters in this
[1:07:40] message
[1:07:42] you either on God's side or you're not
[1:07:46] the offense ain't on nobody's side
[1:07:51] if you want to say it whose side your
[1:07:53] defense if you're sitting in the middle
[1:07:54] of the fence you're on the devil's side
[1:07:55] and will you are God
[1:07:56] because in this message there ain't no
[1:07:58] fence sitters
[1:08:03] Elijah says let them there forgive us
[1:08:06] two bullocks
[1:08:07] choose one I'll choose one
[1:08:10] I'll address it you dress it
[1:08:13] and call ye up on the name of your gods
[1:08:17] go ahead and call upon your two Soul God
[1:08:21] go ahead and call upon your true God
[1:08:22] religion
[1:08:24] go ahead and call upon your tape
[1:08:26] recorder
[1:08:30] Hallelujah you said what in the world
[1:08:32] this God do is surrounded I ain't got a
[1:08:34] clue
[1:08:40] brother Brown said it when it come to
[1:08:41] the place Elijah says let us prove who
[1:08:45] is God
[1:08:46] the fiery God our God is a consuming
[1:08:50] fire let the goddess answers
[1:08:54] by fire that's what I say tonight
[1:08:57] let the goddamn answer by fire the Holy
[1:09:01] Ghost and Fire let him be God
[1:09:09] so Elijah said unto the prophets
[1:09:11] go ahead get your Bullock put it up on
[1:09:14] the altar but put no fire under it and
[1:09:17] I'll do the same thing
[1:09:19] Elijah knew that these prophets or Baal
[1:09:22] were known for a man to be under the
[1:09:24] altar they would act like they praying
[1:09:27] for fire to fall down a man would be
[1:09:29] under the altar to light it
[1:09:33] so Elijah says I don't want no man under
[1:09:36] that altar
[1:09:38] I don't want
[1:09:40] I don't want nobody on that organ
[1:09:43] try to work stuff up or on that piano or
[1:09:46] on that drums
[1:09:48] because people get under some kind of
[1:09:50] emotion and think they got the fire
[1:09:55] cause we know in the New Testament as
[1:09:58] they were preaching the word the Holy
[1:10:00] Ghost Fire fell upon them
[1:10:04] foreign
[1:10:07] so why they do
[1:10:10] they just thought the prophets of bell
[1:10:11] thought this is going to be an easy task
[1:10:14] this all be fun
[1:10:16] because they knew what they did
[1:10:19] they knew how they tricked the people
[1:10:22] but like you knew he said no
[1:10:24] you ain't gonna have nobody under light
[1:10:26] in the fire
[1:10:27] if a fire is going to be lit it's going
[1:10:29] to be lit by God no man can light your
[1:10:31] fire
[1:10:33] it takes one
[1:10:36] and they took the Bullock which was
[1:10:38] given them and they dressed it
[1:10:40] and called on the name of Belle from
[1:10:43] morning until noon
[1:10:46] my
[1:10:48] have we been known to do that
[1:10:52] have we been known to get up in the
[1:10:53] morning and call on our God till noon
[1:10:57] oh Bale hear us
[1:11:00] but there was not there was no voice
[1:11:02] voice nor any that answered and they
[1:11:05] leaped
[1:11:06] upon the all leaped upon the altar which
[1:11:09] was made
[1:11:10] oh they got so fired up they were
[1:11:12] jumping back and forth
[1:11:14] jumping over the altars
[1:11:18] oh they got Ray really got into worship
[1:11:20] it puts a lot of us a shame
[1:11:24] they worship a God that wasn't real
[1:11:27] we worship a god it's real
[1:11:30] my God is real for I feel him in my soul
[1:11:34] [Applause]
[1:11:35] Hallelujah
[1:11:38] all we feel is presence surrounding us
[1:11:40] and I feel it right now
[1:11:43] if you don't feel it where you're
[1:11:44] sitting come on up here a little closer
[1:11:48] they always say the fire falls up front
[1:11:51] somebody told me it's gonna be on the
[1:11:53] front row the other night
[1:11:55] I don't see them
[1:11:57] but I expect to hear their amens
[1:12:02] Hallelujah
[1:12:07] and it came to pass at noon that Elijah
[1:12:09] mocked him and says cry aloud for he's a
[1:12:12] god
[1:12:15] he might even be talking to someone
[1:12:18] aren't you glad
[1:12:20] that when you want to talk to our God
[1:12:23] it don't matter who he's talking to
[1:12:26] he can do it all at one time he's
[1:12:28] talking to every one of us this morning
[1:12:30] each one is how a different need God is
[1:12:32] speaking to you
[1:12:35] either he's talking or he's pursuing
[1:12:38] oh he might be on a journey
[1:12:41] anybody decided to go to go to Myrtle
[1:12:44] Beach
[1:12:45] he might be down in Florida somewhere
[1:12:48] if our God does take a vacation we know
[1:12:50] we can get him
[1:12:52] 24 hours a day seven days a week
[1:12:59] Elijah said if he truly was God either
[1:13:01] he'll answer you
[1:13:02] Elijah making fun of him
[1:13:05] come on where's your fire
[1:13:13] and they cried aloud even more
[1:13:17] and cut themselves after manner with
[1:13:19] knives and lances till the blood gushed
[1:13:22] out of them
[1:13:25] have we praised and worshiped that much
[1:13:29] Hallelujah help us Lord
[1:13:32] and it came to pass when the midday was
[1:13:35] passed they prophesied until the time of
[1:13:38] the Eden sacrifice
[1:13:40] around three o'clock
[1:13:42] in the afternoon
[1:13:43] but there was neither voice nor answer
[1:13:46] nor any of that regarded
[1:13:49] Lord I can imagine the devil down in
[1:13:51] hell
[1:13:53] he's probably back there laughing
[1:13:56] he no doubt has him a big pizza
[1:14:01] got him a can of Mountain Dew
[1:14:03] enjoying this
[1:14:05] because they know there was no way that
[1:14:07] fire was going to fall on that altar
[1:14:10] wow the devil knows
[1:14:14] the devil know who has true fire
[1:14:17] don't tell me he knows who you are
[1:14:22] Hallelujah
[1:14:24] hips in here watching people
[1:14:27] that don't if they don't get their lives
[1:14:29] straight they're headed for hell
[1:14:32] a come on
[1:14:36] many people sit in our churches
[1:14:37] unconverted
[1:14:40] I don't see how
[1:14:41] when the presence of God is moving Among
[1:14:44] Us like it does that an unconverted
[1:14:46] person can just sit there and leave this
[1:14:48] building the same person
[1:14:50] I don't see how
[1:14:52] we're going to be held accountable one
[1:14:54] day over opportunity after opportunity
[1:14:57] after opportunity that God is
[1:15:00] giving us been right here Among Us
[1:15:04] and we just deny it
[1:15:08] I can imagine hell is going to be harder
[1:15:10] for people like that
[1:15:13] even those same people's blasphemed this
[1:15:16] message
[1:15:21] those that's affected and says they're
[1:15:23] free
[1:15:24] they ain't free
[1:15:27] first thing they do when they leave this
[1:15:29] message they get more bound up they were
[1:15:31] within it they go after women cut their
[1:15:33] hair and they look like the world the
[1:15:35] men starts drinking and partying how's
[1:15:36] that free you're under the bondage of
[1:15:38] the devil
[1:15:40] I'd rather be a slave than Jesus Christ
[1:15:43] because I know that's how I'm getting
[1:15:45] out of here
[1:15:51] I like what brother Andrew said last
[1:15:52] time he was here I'm going to use it
[1:15:55] I'm here I might as well preach
[1:16:02] they have no representation in heaven
[1:16:05] no Holy Ghost no fire vindicating them
[1:16:12] those peoples left the message say they
[1:16:14] got a move of God
[1:16:15] we'll issue a challenge
[1:16:18] we'll issue a challenge if God be God
[1:16:21] God will prove it
[1:16:24] pray a sick person up here and you pray
[1:16:27] for them
[1:16:29] bring a blinded person up here and you
[1:16:32] pray for them and see what happens
[1:16:36] we'll issue a challenge
[1:16:39] this ain't for you all
[1:16:41] stinking people on the internet
[1:16:51] and brother
[1:16:53] Jason these ministers lay hands on them
[1:16:54] Watch What Happens
[1:16:58] I've seen it done
[1:17:00] I've seen the death able to hear the
[1:17:03] dumb speak all by a prayer
[1:17:09] you do that let's see where who God
[1:17:11] vindicates
[1:17:14] but I I'm here to tell you he won't
[1:17:16] vindicate you
[1:17:18] he's Vindicated this message around the
[1:17:21] world seven times
[1:17:23] that Pillar of Fire as he dropped and
[1:17:25] seen in the meetings a picture was taken
[1:17:27] of it
[1:17:29] there's your Vindication you showed me a
[1:17:32] picture with a pillow fire over your
[1:17:34] head
[1:17:38] I seen the I've been in meetings where
[1:17:40] the pillar of fire has been present
[1:17:43] and people's actually seen it
[1:17:47] I've never seen it
[1:17:49] a pillar of fire but I actually have
[1:17:52] felt the very presence of it like it
[1:17:54] bumps up against you when it goes by
[1:17:58] y'all know what I'm talking about you
[1:18:00] see the same thing brother Jack
[1:18:02] the power of God so strong
[1:18:06] we had we was down in Texas at a family
[1:18:08] camp
[1:18:10] it was Saturday night brother Ron
[1:18:11] Spencer was preaching it's supposed to
[1:18:12] be in a big prayer line after service
[1:18:16] but brother Ron got the preaching and
[1:18:17] you could just feel the way it was
[1:18:18] building up
[1:18:20] laughs
[1:18:22] he says I'm not having a prayer meet
[1:18:24] we're not having a prayer line we don't
[1:18:27] need one tonight the presence of God was
[1:18:29] in that building so strong
[1:18:32] it was no longer we all stood upon our
[1:18:34] hands I'll be up on our feet raised our
[1:18:37] hands lay our hands on each other I
[1:18:40] don't think we were five seconds into
[1:18:42] that prayer that the pillar of fire
[1:18:44] dropped down brother Ron Fisher said
[1:18:46] he's Seated on the people
[1:18:50] those people that were sick were healed
[1:18:55] you don't need a prayer line
[1:18:58] those help we've been in where we see
[1:19:00] them help
[1:19:01] but the pillar of fire is Among Us right
[1:19:04] now
[1:19:06] oh can you feel the effects of it
[1:19:11] Hallelujah
[1:19:14] Elijah said it to the people come near
[1:19:17] come near unto me
[1:19:21] and all the people came near unto him
[1:19:23] and he repaired the altar of the Lord
[1:19:33] he said I've got to repair the word
[1:19:37] I've got to take these people back to
[1:19:39] the faith of the fathers
[1:19:42] Hallelujah
[1:19:43] he grabbed the first stone faith is a
[1:19:46] substance
[1:19:49] we go on and on to the last Stone of the
[1:19:53] rapture
[1:19:55] brother Brandon getting our hearts ready
[1:19:57] turned us back to the Faith of Our
[1:19:59] Fathers
[1:20:00] so that's what Elijah was doing he had
[1:20:02] to repair the altar
[1:20:04] Elijah took 12 Stones according to the
[1:20:06] number of the tribe of Israel
[1:20:08] unto whom the word of the Lord came
[1:20:12] Israel shall be my name
[1:20:16] Hallelujah when he made the altar he dug
[1:20:20] a trench
[1:20:22] why in the world is he digging a trench
[1:20:24] for
[1:20:25] I can imagine the prophets over there
[1:20:27] they're laying on the ground by now
[1:20:28] they're wore out
[1:20:30] tired
[1:20:32] what is he doing
[1:20:34] he'll just say hey
[1:20:36] I want you go get me
[1:20:38] some water
[1:20:41] filled up with water in the sea I want
[1:20:43] you to bring it I want you to feel it
[1:20:46] all of the altar fill up the trench
[1:20:49] that's the first pull
[1:20:52] he says go do it the second time the
[1:20:55] second pool
[1:20:58] he says go do it the third time third
[1:21:01] pull
[1:21:04] brother sister did his third pool hour
[1:21:06] the fire will vindicate us
[1:21:10] in this third pool the fire will fall
[1:21:13] down
[1:21:17] who is at this third time that's when
[1:21:19] the Dynamics will strike the mechanics
[1:21:24] and the water ran round about the altar
[1:21:27] he filled the trends also with water
[1:21:30] they had put 12 barrels of water
[1:21:32] on this sacrifice
[1:21:38] and it came to pass at the time of the
[1:21:41] offering of the Eden sacrifice that
[1:21:43] Elijah the prophet just came near
[1:21:46] and said
[1:21:49] Lord God of Abraham
[1:21:51] Isaac and of Israel
[1:21:55] he didn't say Jacob
[1:21:59] Jacob had a name change
[1:22:01] he said all Israel
[1:22:03] let it be known this day that thou art
[1:22:06] God
[1:22:08] and that I am thy servant that I had
[1:22:11] done all these things at Thy Word
[1:22:15] what took the prophets of Baal all day
[1:22:18] to try to do
[1:22:23] Hallelujah Elijah walks up there
[1:22:27] Hear Me O Lord
[1:22:30] hear me
[1:22:32] that these people may know that thou art
[1:22:35] the Lord God and thou has turned their
[1:22:38] heart back again
[1:22:42] no sooner than he said those words
[1:22:46] then the fire of the Lord fell down and
[1:22:50] consumed the birth offering
[1:22:55] that word consumes to devour
[1:23:00] burn up
[1:23:03] oh God burn me up this morning
[1:23:07] May that Holy Fire come down and consume
[1:23:10] me
[1:23:13] Hallelujah
[1:23:15] fire fell and consumed that sacrifice
[1:23:20] because it was pleasing to God and he
[1:23:22] accepted it
[1:23:26] does he accept you today
[1:23:30] if he don't find out what hinders you
[1:23:34] from being accepted
[1:23:37] there's something
[1:23:39] there's something that's hindering you
[1:23:40] consuming fire
[1:23:42] God's Gonna prove with
[1:23:46] he's going to prove who his true bride
[1:23:48] is
[1:23:50] and it's proved by that fire
[1:23:53] same fire that fell in the Tabernacle in
[1:23:56] the wilderness
[1:23:59] that same fire that was at the beginning
[1:24:01] that said let there be light
[1:24:04] that same fire that Moses sent at the
[1:24:06] burning bush
[1:24:07] that same Pillar of Fire that fall
[1:24:10] children of Israel fought out in out of
[1:24:12] Egypt
[1:24:13] that same Pillar of Fire when Paul was
[1:24:15] on his road that that same Pillar of
[1:24:18] Fire had knocked him down who are you
[1:24:20] I'm Jesus that same Pillar of Fire is
[1:24:24] sitting beside you brother Gideon
[1:24:29] recap and just touch it
[1:24:36] oh Hallelujah
[1:24:41] let's change gears just for a minute and
[1:24:43] you can put up second Kings chapter six
[1:24:47] and do 14.
[1:24:49] we know the story there
[1:24:51] the king of Syria kept wanting to trap
[1:24:54] the king of Israel
[1:24:56] and he was saying Elijah would tell the
[1:24:59] king hey don't go that way there's a
[1:25:01] trap set for you
[1:25:04] there's a trap set for you every time
[1:25:06] the yard Syrian Army come up
[1:25:09] no king of Israel
[1:25:11] he didn't do it just one not once not
[1:25:14] twice but many times was the king of
[1:25:16] Israel's life saved
[1:25:19] all because Elisha knew what the King
[1:25:23] was thinking in his bed chamber
[1:25:26] God knows what you're thinking even
[1:25:28] right now
[1:25:31] it's like oh lord it's getting 12 30.
[1:25:34] I got food in the crock pot over here
[1:25:40] he knows what you're thinking
[1:25:44] laughs
[1:25:50] we're out
[1:25:53] he knows exactly what you're thinking
[1:25:58] and the King says what's going on
[1:26:02] who is tell the king where I'm at
[1:26:07] boy if we could if we could just listen
[1:26:08] to that voice sometimes
[1:26:10] you'll be driving along going to you
[1:26:12] going to your happy place
[1:26:15] and you might go the same route every
[1:26:17] day
[1:26:18] but one more decided I'm gonna go this
[1:26:20] way
[1:26:21] and unbeknownst to you there was a car
[1:26:24] wreck right here that God was protecting
[1:26:26] you from
[1:26:29] the devil likes to set traps for God's
[1:26:31] people
[1:26:35] if we just saw the leading of God what
[1:26:37] he'll take us around
[1:26:39] what will we avoid
[1:26:45] he's like where is this Elisha at then
[1:26:47] oh he's down in the city of dots Dawson
[1:26:52] and he says therefore sit he thither
[1:26:55] horses and chariots and a great host
[1:26:59] they came by night and can pass the city
[1:27:04] and when the servant of the man of God
[1:27:06] was risen early and gone forth Behold a
[1:27:10] host can pass the city with horses and
[1:27:13] chariots
[1:27:15] and his servants got kind of nervous
[1:27:19] a last master
[1:27:21] how shall we do
[1:27:25] and the answer says fear not
[1:27:27] for they that be with us are more than
[1:27:30] they that be with them water
[1:27:33] relationship unless you had to heaven
[1:27:37] what representation Elisha had in heaven
[1:27:41] don't worry
[1:27:43] there's more here
[1:27:45] there's more here than any devil
[1:27:49] Hallelujah
[1:27:52] oh if people can really see what follows
[1:27:54] a believer
[1:27:56] these signs shall follow them that
[1:27:59] believe
[1:28:02] we are the Bride of Jesus Christ if he
[1:28:05] could just open up our eyes today and we
[1:28:08] can see what's live along these walls
[1:28:11] [Music]
[1:28:13] you know Elisha probably could have got
[1:28:15] out here and
[1:28:16] looked it out out there
[1:28:19] say you know what servant
[1:28:22] it looks like I'm surrounded
[1:28:25] it may look like I'm surrounded
[1:28:29] he could have sung the song if it looks
[1:28:32] like I've surrounded I'm surrounded by
[1:28:34] you
[1:28:37] as service is why in the world are you
[1:28:39] talking about all he could see was the
[1:28:42] devils
[1:28:43] all he could see was a sickness
[1:28:46] all he could see was the line vanities
[1:28:54] oh Hallelujah you know when that Army
[1:28:57] surrounds the city
[1:28:59] oh that King sin is cherishing his
[1:29:01] horses
[1:29:02] and what that meant when they sent the
[1:29:04] carrots and the horses it was to show
[1:29:06] their great power
[1:29:07] there's wanting to scare the inhabitants
[1:29:09] of the city
[1:29:10] bring Elisha forth
[1:29:13] but I can imagine God looking down on
[1:29:15] that
[1:29:17] and kind of laughing
[1:29:20] oh look at all them horses and chariots
[1:29:22] that devil thinks he's so powerful
[1:29:27] he thinks he's so powerful
[1:29:33] oh the devil thinks he's so Paris
[1:29:35] brother Matthew powerful
[1:29:37] he released 200 000 000 demons out of
[1:29:40] pits the hell against us
[1:29:45] you know Muhammad Ali when he when he
[1:29:47] was a he when he fought
[1:29:50] he fought one fight I can't remember his
[1:29:51] name but where he that guy punched him
[1:29:54] hard
[1:29:55] and it got round after round
[1:29:58] Muhammad Ali finally got up there
[1:30:00] whispered in his ear
[1:30:01] is that all you got
[1:30:07] can you imagine brother Luther how that
[1:30:09] boxer felt
[1:30:12] he had given Muhammad Ali everything he
[1:30:15] had
[1:30:18] I could imagine God telling the devil is
[1:30:21] that all you got
[1:30:26] if Satan comes against you
[1:30:28] come here devil
[1:30:30] he might have you in a headlock
[1:30:33] he might be punching you
[1:30:37] grab his ear

[1:30:43] come on
[1:30:46] come on Hallelujah

[1:31:06] got
[1:31:11] Hallelujah
[1:31:14] is that all you got devil
[1:31:19] there's more for us than against us
[1:31:24] Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee
[1:31:29] open his eyes and the Lord opened his
[1:31:33] eyes to the young man and he saw and
[1:31:36] behold
[1:31:38] the mountain was full of horses and
[1:31:42] Chariots of Fire
[1:31:46] round about Elisha
[1:31:54] that's what the devil sees
[1:31:57] where he sees you he sees our host of
[1:32:01] fire around you
[1:32:05] it don't matter what he afflicts you
[1:32:07] with there are surrounded by Holy Fire
[1:32:15] oh you know that same fire
[1:32:18] was a charity one day when Elijah and
[1:32:20] Elisha was gone across Jordan
[1:32:24] Elijah says what do you want Elisha he
[1:32:26] says I want a double portion of your
[1:32:28] spirit
[1:32:31] while they were walking along here come
[1:32:33] a sound of a whirlwind
[1:32:36] that Holy Fire come down and split right
[1:32:40] down between Elisha and Elijah picked up
[1:32:43] Elijah and carried him home
[1:32:47] Elisha says I see that I want that
[1:32:51] double portion
[1:32:57] these chariots are surrounding us this
[1:33:00] morning that one day between six and
[1:33:02] nine o'clock
[1:33:05] those same chairs that carried Elijah
[1:33:08] those same character horses are right
[1:33:11] here in this building it's going to
[1:33:13] sweep down and pick you up and carry you
[1:33:16] on in
[1:33:19] Hallelujah
[1:33:23] Supernatural fire is a definition for
[1:33:26] this fire this is the same fire that I
[1:33:28] went Ultra fire this is another
[1:33:29] definition it took me this long to get
[1:33:31] back here
[1:33:35] Supernatural fire
[1:33:38] accompanying theophanes
[1:33:43] that was a definition of fire
[1:33:45] Supernatural fire accompanying theophany
[1:33:51] that Pillar of Fire
[1:33:55] is Supernatural you know sometimes
[1:34:00] it ain't because I'm somebody
[1:34:02] because I'm not
[1:34:04] I'm a nobody
[1:34:06] but ever so often when I'm administered
[1:34:08] in a church basically does it mostly
[1:34:10] here
[1:34:12] that the glory of God is in the building
[1:34:14] it gets hazy somebody's probably been in
[1:34:17] Services where it's been hazy you can't
[1:34:19] hardly see the people in the back
[1:34:22] that's the presence of God it's right
[1:34:25] here that's your kind of Glory
[1:34:28] can you feel him
[1:34:30] can you feel his presence
[1:34:33] Hallelujah
[1:34:38] brother said he seen that Syrian Army
[1:34:40] All Around Dothan it backed up
[1:34:44] he says my father is the servant this is
[1:34:46] look out there what a great number why
[1:34:49] we're surrounded
[1:34:52] he just looking with his natural eyes
[1:34:54] with everything seems to go wrong
[1:34:58] when they point a finger at you and say
[1:35:00] this and that
[1:35:02] the doctor says you can't get well
[1:35:06] that's just a natural thing for you to
[1:35:08] think and you'll say oh my This Is the
[1:35:10] End
[1:35:12] but Elisha says there is more with us
[1:35:15] than there is with them
[1:35:19] he looked over again and says well I
[1:35:21] don't see nobody and he said God open
[1:35:22] this boy's eyes
[1:35:24] and as soon as God did something here it
[1:35:28] is get it when God opened his spiritual
[1:35:31] sight all around the prophets the chairs
[1:35:34] of fire and angels of Fire
[1:35:39] that they outnumbered the Syrian Army by
[1:35:44] the thousands
[1:35:51] the mountains was on fire
[1:35:54] oh if God could open up our spiritual
[1:35:57] eyes this morning and see these walls
[1:35:59] are on fire
[1:36:04] the angels of God in Camp about those
[1:36:07] who fear Him
[1:36:13] just the same tonight he says I wonder
[1:36:15] what would happen if man here tonight
[1:36:17] had the power to strike across their
[1:36:19] eyes and say look stand it around this
[1:36:22] Tabernacle tonight
[1:36:28] I love this next line
[1:36:31] he says look standing around this
[1:36:34] Tabernacle tonight and if you've seen it
[1:36:38] he said you would be a member here for
[1:36:41] the rest of your life
[1:36:45] if you knew I was standing among you you
[1:36:49] would want to go to no other Church
[1:36:52] you will follow no other religion
[1:36:55] because they don't have what we got
[1:37:04] you know sometimes you can't see it with
[1:37:06] your natural eyes
[1:37:09] but you can feel the impulse of it
[1:37:12] bro Steve we feel it
[1:37:16] it's that Sixth Sense
[1:37:18] that tells you something is near
[1:37:26] faith is a substance of things hoped for
[1:37:29] the evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:37:35] no man has seen God
[1:37:41] but we sure do feel his presence
[1:37:44] even yesterday when I was telling his
[1:37:46] presence all day long
[1:37:48] I am so peaceful
[1:37:50] [Music]
[1:37:51] I said Lord why can't we stay like this
[1:37:54] forever
[1:37:56] but we're human beings we can't
[1:37:58] I would love to
[1:38:02] Brown says this Elijah probably didn't
[1:38:06] even see it itself
[1:38:09] wow he probably didn't see the angels in
[1:38:12] the cherished himself
[1:38:13] but he knew they was there
[1:38:16] oh we might not see him but we know
[1:38:19] they're there brother Travis
[1:38:21] they're here
[1:38:25] but Elisha was conscious they were there
[1:38:29] we're conscious they're here
[1:38:31] I can see it right here feel it right
[1:38:33] here
[1:38:34] there is on things unseen things in this
[1:38:38] building this morning there's a host of
[1:38:40] heavenly angels
[1:38:43] they're with us
[1:38:49] we're beginning Fellowship says did I
[1:38:51] think that whenever this Soul leaves
[1:38:53] this body we go into another house made
[1:38:57] with hand not made with hands we go into
[1:39:00] the presence of God and they're
[1:39:01] Tabernacle with him in the presence of
[1:39:04] Lord Jesus
[1:39:05] omniscient omnipresent Heath He Is We
[1:39:10] Are when we go into that into our new
[1:39:13] Tabernacle over there because he said
[1:39:15] we're two or three are gathered together
[1:39:18] I'll be in their midst
[1:39:21] one two three God's here
[1:39:31] then he's bound to be here this
[1:39:34] afternoon
[1:39:36] it's his word
[1:39:37] [Laughter]
[1:39:41] in our prayer meetings
[1:39:43] we might have six or eight or ten
[1:39:46] last week we had five
[1:39:49] it didn't matter
[1:39:51] the presence of God still come down
[1:39:53] Among Us
[1:39:56] so now you Brothers need to come to
[1:39:58] prayer meetings
[1:40:00] that was free there too he didn't pay me
[1:40:03] to do that
[1:40:06] he he
[1:40:11] can't seem but there's something about a
[1:40:13] Christian soul
[1:40:15] when man realizes when he's in the
[1:40:17] presence there he's standing in the
[1:40:19] presence of something
[1:40:21] [Music]
[1:40:24] that he can't see
[1:40:30] he says we know there's radios going
[1:40:32] through here right now
[1:40:34] there's television going through right
[1:40:36] now if we had receivers we could pick it
[1:40:38] up all kinds of things going through
[1:40:41] this building
[1:40:44] but it's in another world
[1:40:46] and so is there's angels of God placed
[1:40:50] around in this room watching this
[1:40:53] afternoon
[1:40:59] he's watching you
[1:41:05] the Angels Our God are encamped about
[1:41:08] those who fear Him Jesus is all present
[1:41:12] all the time watching over us
[1:41:21] we're surrounded
[1:41:22] says a servant
[1:41:24] why do you keep reading these quotes
[1:41:27] because they're good
[1:41:29] because I couldn't think of these
[1:41:32] I just use them we're plagiarizing
[1:41:34] mother Matthew
[1:41:36] God opened his boy's eyes when his eyes
[1:41:39] come open the mouths was on fire the
[1:41:40] angels of fire character fire sure he's
[1:41:42] here and when the Christian Believers
[1:41:44] can breathe can't believe that presence
[1:41:50] is here right now
[1:41:53] sitting together
[1:41:56] seated here in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:42:00] Jesus
[1:42:04] fellowshipping he says amen around the
[1:42:09] word of God
[1:42:10] the Holy Spirit here taking the word of
[1:42:14] God by vision
[1:42:16] and moving it out there into every heart
[1:42:21] as the word is going forth every
[1:42:24] believer receiving it
[1:42:28] we could stand and claim our god-given
[1:42:31] privileges
[1:42:36] that's the the time that God can ever
[1:42:40] take that Wishbone out of you
[1:42:48] I don't know what people's gonna think
[1:42:49] of me if God comes on me and I jump up
[1:42:51] and shout
[1:42:54] if I jump up say Amen to the preacher
[1:42:57] what's the people behind me gonna think
[1:43:00] God's here to take that Wishbone out of
[1:43:03] your back
[1:43:06] and put a real old-fashioned gospel
[1:43:09] backbone into you
[1:43:14] somebody who will stand for the truth no
[1:43:17] matter how dark it gets
[1:43:24] I think I busted my lip
[1:43:27] the Bible says
[1:43:30] the angels of God are encamped about
[1:43:33] those
[1:43:34] that believe
[1:43:37] that fear him and he'll deliver them
[1:43:44] God made an unconditional Covenant
[1:43:47] this is infallibility of God's spoken
[1:43:49] word
[1:43:51] and I sent this to the brothers
[1:43:53] last week two weeks ago
[1:43:55] he hooked it into Jesus Christ
[1:43:58] bear it's anchored there's no slipping
[1:44:02] no sliding there's no way of it getting
[1:44:06] away
[1:44:08] what is it is hurt by God above by the
[1:44:13] Son of God beneath
[1:44:16] it's a pathway
[1:44:21] it's a traveler's way from Earth to
[1:44:24] Glory
[1:44:27] and you can't fail
[1:44:30] look he says there's a great company of
[1:44:33] angels up and down here
[1:44:35] ascending and descending picking up the
[1:44:39] weary and the sick healing their bodies
[1:44:42] showing Visions Mighty signs and wonders
[1:44:45] can't fail it can't slip it can't slide
[1:44:49] you're safe
[1:44:54] Hallelujah
[1:44:57] it's hooked around the heart of God
[1:45:02] hooked around the Son of God down here
[1:45:07] and we're brought into it through the
[1:45:10] Son of God we Ascend to him
[1:45:15] there's an open line
[1:45:19] we have a direct line to the throne room
[1:45:28] he'll give his angels charge over thee
[1:45:31] and the angels of God are encamped about
[1:45:34] those who fear Him
[1:45:37] in Revelation the book of symbols
[1:45:40] brother Brown says the angels are
[1:45:42] encamped around us
[1:45:47] they don't go back to Heaven they are
[1:45:50] with you through life
[1:45:58] every day they are here
[1:46:02] the angels of God are compassed are
[1:46:04] camped about those
[1:46:06] they don't go back to heaven
[1:46:09] they Camp there they're sent on a
[1:46:11] mission to watch you
[1:46:14] you know sometimes you know before you
[1:46:17] got saved
[1:46:19] Lord I should have been dead
[1:46:22] I should have drowned it in the ocean
[1:46:26] but my angel was protecting me
[1:46:29] because he had a commission
[1:46:31] laughs
[1:46:32] that angel is here with you right now
[1:46:37] they might be 75 people 80 people if
[1:46:40] they're that many
[1:46:41] I know it they're at least 75 angels in
[1:46:44] this building right now
[1:46:48] not counting the ones that's lying the
[1:46:50] walls
[1:46:56] Hallelujah every now and then though
[1:47:00] one of them angels will bump into you
[1:47:04] and you'll send a charge to you like a
[1:47:06] battery
[1:47:07] oh if you talk about God he'll come near
[1:47:10] you
[1:47:14] you know it's truth people sit and
[1:47:16] you'll still sit and talk about awful
[1:47:17] things talk about a movie they've
[1:47:19] watched and talk about
[1:47:22] demons and stuff and you start feeling
[1:47:24] pressing in
[1:47:30] that's what happens when you talk about
[1:47:31] Jesus
[1:47:33] remember Tony on the phone the other
[1:47:34] morning
[1:47:36] and we're just sitting there talking and
[1:47:37] it's just start out with business then
[1:47:40] all of a sudden he got over to God
[1:47:43] and he just mentioned how he's getting
[1:47:44] sick of the devil
[1:47:47] I'm tired of it I told you I'm gonna
[1:47:48] preach a sermon on that one night tired
[1:47:50] of it we're tired of what the devil does
[1:47:53] to us
[1:47:55] talk about the goodness of God and what
[1:47:57] God does to you and I'm sitting there
[1:47:59] driving down the road and I said brother
[1:48:00] Tony the presence of God is right here
[1:48:02] in this truck
[1:48:04] when you talk about God he's going to
[1:48:06] come around you

[1:48:26] he's here
[1:48:28] he's right here
[1:48:31] God is real as we say he is something
[1:48:34] ought to declare him
[1:48:35] if we could just open our eyes and you
[1:48:37] can see God
[1:48:41] oh Lord let me skip
[1:48:44] the very in question answering
[1:48:47] Jeffersonville the very Lord Jesus that
[1:48:49] was back there in the days of the
[1:48:51] Apostles is right here right now
[1:48:55] and he is just winding up at the end of
[1:48:59] the Gentiles a great move is going on

[1:50:59] going to read this like this ain't got
[1:51:01] nothing to do with it
[1:51:03] but brother Brown says in the rise of
[1:51:05] the Sun
[1:51:07] all these Easter bunnies and ceremonies
[1:51:09] and big churches and finderies will fail
[1:51:12] and pass away until that church both
[1:51:15] Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of
[1:51:19] God that moved him to do those things
[1:51:21] that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so
[1:51:25] will the bride
[1:51:29] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:51:32] do
[1:51:33] shall he do also
[1:51:38] this is probably why I was going to read
[1:51:39] this
[1:51:42] I'll give
[1:51:44] get hard of my Dynamics
[1:51:48] [Laughter]
[1:51:51] his mechanics that the world will not be

[1:52:08] is standing right here to give you a
[1:52:11] charge
