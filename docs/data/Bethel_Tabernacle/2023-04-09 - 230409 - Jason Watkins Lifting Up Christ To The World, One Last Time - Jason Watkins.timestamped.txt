[25:12] Sister Sarah a hand.
[25:16] [Applause]
[25:17] [Music]
[25:46] I stood there as they tried. him for
[25:50] crimes he hadn't done.
[25:54] No one else believed it, but I just knew
[25:59] he was the one.
[26:02] And I slid back into the crowd trying to
[26:07] go unseen.
[26:09] But when Pilot cried out, beat him. He
[26:14] pointed straight to me.
[26:19] My friends, they all cheered me as I
[26:23] took the whip in hand,
[26:27] placing stripes upon the back of this
[26:32] guiltless man.
[26:34] The way he turned and looked at me from
[26:38] my mind I can't erase.
[26:41] And I'll never forget
[26:45] the look on his face.
[26:51] He said, "I'm doing
[26:54] this for you
[27:00] and I will still love you when you're
[27:04] through.
[27:06] I'm doing
[27:09] this for you.
[27:14] Though it took me by surprise
[27:17] when I saw love in his eyes. He said,
[27:21] "I'm doing
[27:23] this for you."
[27:29] I had taught Mount Calvary
[27:32] with hammer and nail.
[27:36] It became my duty to crucify this man.
[27:42] And I saw my friends gambling for his
[27:46] robe by my side.
[27:50] But I couldn't tear away
[27:53] as he looked into my eyes.
[27:57] [Music]
[28:00] Oh, Father, forgive them. I heard him
[28:04] cry aloud,
[28:07] "Behold the King of Kings."
[28:10] Someone marked from the crowd. But then
[28:14] the ground shook and the thunder rose as
[28:17] he gave up the ghost.
[28:20] But until the day I die, the thing that
[28:24] I'll remember most,
[28:30] he said, "I'm doing
[28:33] this for you,
[28:38] and I will still love you when you're
[28:42] through.
[28:44] I do
[28:47] this for you.
[28:52] Though it took me by surprise
[28:55] when I saw love in his eyes. He said,
[28:59] "I'm doing
[29:01] this for you."
[29:06] The sacrifice that day
[29:09] at Calvary
[29:13] was the Father's perfect plan to set men
[29:18] free.
[29:24] He said, "I'm doing
[29:27] this for you,
[29:32] and I will still love you when you're
[29:36] through.
[29:39] I'm doing
[29:41] this for you."
[29:44] [Music]
[29:45] Though it took me by surprise
[29:49] when I saw love in his eyes. He said,
[29:53] "I'm doing
[29:55] this for you."
[29:59] Though it took me by surprise
[30:03] when I saw such love in his eyes.
[30:08] He said, "I'm doing
[30:11] this for you.
[30:21] [Music]
[30:23] [Applause]
[30:33] Amen. Let us stand. Amen. Let's sing the

[35:13] all. Amen. Have you heard the news? He
[35:16] has risen.
[35:19] Oh, that is the true shot heard around
[35:21] the world. My that has changed the
[35:24] course of human history. Amen. Because
[35:26] he lives, I can face tomorrow. Can face
[35:30] whatever the devil throws at me because
[35:32] he lives. All fear is gone.
[35:35] Amen. Because I know. See, and the Bible
[35:37] tells me that I can know that you can
[35:39] know. See,
[35:40] so we don't have to be wondering today.
[35:43] There's no guessing at it. We know who
[35:45] he is. We have revelation of his name.
[35:47] We have a revelation of his person. We
[35:49] know who we are.
[35:51] Because he has revealed to us his
[35:54] identity. And when he did that, when the
[35:56] mighty God was unveiled, there was the
[35:58] bride. Amen. She had been there all
[36:00] along, unnoticed. Amen. But praise the
[36:02] Lord. That was the great mystery that
[36:04] Paul spoke of that the world has
[36:07] constantly missed the mark and stumbled
[36:09] over that Christ in you the hope of
[36:12] glory. So because it seems like they
[36:15] oversimplify it and I get God's hidden
[36:17] and revealed in simplicity but let me
[36:19] tell you something when that God in
[36:20] heaven comes down and starts living
[36:22] through human lives my things can get
[36:25] quite complicated. Amen. But that's why
[36:27] we have the mind of Christ.
[36:30] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you
[36:32] today. We're wanting to just remind you
[36:35] today um that next week uh we will have
[36:40] special revival meetings with brother
[36:42] Andrew Glover. He'll be here for us
[36:45] Saturday night and Sunday morning. We
[36:47] have a youth event going on on Friday.
[36:50] Amen. At the Urban Bruce. So, we're
[36:52] hoping that all of you young people have
[36:54] got all your uh RSVP in and your menu
[36:57] items. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. And
[37:00] so we want to we want to make sure
[37:01] you're you're wellfed naturally and
[37:04] spiritually. Amen. So then brother
[37:06] Andrew will be coming uh to preach two
[37:08] revival services for us here in the
[37:10] church on Saturday and Sunday next week.
[37:15] You ready for that? My we haven't had
[37:17] brother Andrew ever. I don't think have
[37:19] we never we have
[37:21] we have at one time. Okay. Don't tell
[37:23] him I said I forgot that. Okay.
[37:27] And don't any of you people on the
[37:28] internet tell him amen. Amen. Praise the
[37:30] Lord. So, we're happy then to have Amen.
[37:33] have him coming again. God bless to all
[37:36] of our visitors. Uh number here today,
[37:38] too many to start naming. I'm going to
[37:40] have to name Noah, although he's not a
[37:42] visitor. Everybody turn, stare at Noah.
[37:44] Wave at him, Noah. Come on, wave at him.
[37:46] Noah.
[37:50] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[37:55] Amen. Happy to have him here today and
[37:58] all the different ones of you. Praise
[38:00] the Lord. We're going to invite you to
[38:01] Revelation chapter 5 this morning. Amen.
[38:06] I think that's all the announcements I
[38:07] had. There's a number of families
[38:09] traveling. So, uh quite a few. So, just
[38:11] be in prayer for them. Amen. Half my
[38:14] tribe is overseas. Amen. Matthew's up in
[38:17] Canada. And uh John and Martha and Chris
[38:20] and Katie and Uriah are over in Europe.
[38:23] Amen. And so, um, we got a special
[38:25] prayer request we're going to pray
[38:27] today. Um, well, they got off the plane,
[38:29] got through the airport, got on the
[38:31] trains, and, uh, lo and behold, when
[38:33] they got off the train, Sister Martha's
[38:35] luggage was gone. So, they don't know
[38:38] why. Now, fortunately, she had all of
[38:39] her electronic, her phone, her passport,
[38:42] her wallet, everything on her person.
[38:44] But, uh, Amen., she might have to go
[38:46] shopping. Oh, man. But, no, seriously,
[38:51] she she wants that back. and uh
[38:53] especially I think it's my suitcase. So,
[38:57] so we want to be praying. Amen. And then
[39:00] uh and you know, Sister Dave and I
[39:01] encouraged them to say, "Listen,"
[39:03] because we were remembering, you know,
[39:05] Wednesday night when all those
[39:06] testimonies were going on and uh how
[39:09] many testimonies we heard of things that
[39:11] were impossibly lost and just were
[39:13] found. Amen. Or God just returned them.
[39:17] You know, I still don't know how to
[39:18] explain my garage door opener. I'll go
[39:20] have to go to the other side and say,
[39:21] "Lord, was that thing just I wasn't
[39:24] noticing. I happened the wrong color in
[39:25] my mind cuz it's not there." And I said,
[39:28] "Lord, I just can you just make it be
[39:30] here?" And suddenly it was there.
[39:34] It's all I can know. It's all It's all
[39:36] It's all I know. It's all I can say.
[39:38] Don't get me outside and ask me anything
[39:40] else. That's I've told you all I know.
[39:41] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh we want
[39:45] to go into the word of God today. And I
[39:50] I desire to take this title um lifting
[39:55] up Christ to the world one last time in
[39:59] history. Amen. It's a little bit of an
[40:02] interruption of my series I've been on.
[40:05] And that's all right. I don't get to
[40:06] choose that. But I've had to go very,
[40:09] very carefully to make sure that I had
[40:12] the Lord's perfect mind. And I believe
[40:14] we're set to go this morning. All right.
[40:17] Revelation chapter 5
[40:20] and we'll begin uh at verse 11. We'll
[40:23] run 11 through 14.
[40:27] Now, I don't have a PowerPoint today.
[40:29] However, I've already notified the
[40:31] booth. Amen. That we're going to get a
[40:33] workout in the scriptures today. Will
[40:34] that be all right? Amen. Brother Brad
[40:37] got so scared he ran him all of us to
[40:38] get a water to stay make sure he could
[40:40] handle it. Amen. So, we're we're gonna I
[40:43] sent him a I sent him a list today. It's
[40:45] not a horribly long list. Hey, Brad. So,
[40:47] it's Yeah, it's good. Amen. You'll be
[40:49] all right, buddy. Amen. All right. And I
[40:51] beheld and I heard the voice of many
[40:54] angels. Look at this scene. Round about
[40:57] the throne and the beast and the elders.
[41:00] And the number of them was 10,000 times
[41:04] 10,000 and thousands of thousands. Now,
[41:07] that's a a way of writing in the Aramaic
[41:11] and the Greek of just saying it was an
[41:13] innumerable company. We couldn't even
[41:15] put a figure to it. It's just thousands
[41:17] of thousands. All right. So, all right.
[41:20] So, watch.
[41:22] Saying where they were all saying. You
[41:24] want to see a church in one mind and one
[41:26] accord.
[41:27] All right. Here we go. Saying with a
[41:30] loud voice, worthy is the lamb that was
[41:34] slain to receive power and riches and
[41:37] wisdom and strength and honor and glory
[41:40] and blessing. That's quite a bit. Verse
[41:42] 13.
[41:44] and every creature which is in heaven
[41:46] and on the earth and under the earth and
[41:49] such as are in the sea and all that are
[41:51] in them heard I saying John wasn't going
[41:54] to be shouted out here. He wanted to
[41:56] make sure his voice was heard. Blessing
[41:58] and honor and glory and power be unto
[42:02] him that siteth upon the throne and unto
[42:05] the Lamb forever and ever. And the four
[42:09] beasts said, "Amen." and the four and 20
[42:12] elders fell down and worshiped him that
[42:14] liveth forever and ever. Oh my. Let's
[42:18] pray. Father, we're thanking you for
[42:21] your word today. And already I feel your
[42:24] anointing coming upon me, Lord. And I
[42:27] just ask now that you deliver this word.
[42:29] Let it be delivered as you delivered it
[42:31] to me. Bless all of those in our midst
[42:33] today. We're missing much of our Bethl
[42:36] family, but so we pray your blessing on
[42:38] them wherever they may be. And Lord,
[42:40] today we find that the enemy trying to
[42:43] come in and upset, Lord, a a wonderful
[42:46] trip that's been well planned. And here,
[42:49] Sister Martha loses her luggage. Lord, h
[42:52] who in this building could doubt, you
[42:55] could just simply materialize it. Lord,
[42:57] we've just seen you do so much, Father.
[43:00] And and and Lord, you've just constantly
[43:02] done it. And we're asking that that
[43:04] luggage, Lord, be returned to her. We
[43:06] ask these things and these favors and
[43:08] blessings in Jesus name. Amen. God
[43:11] bless. You can be seated.
[43:17] Now, I have so much ground to cover. I'm
[43:19] just going to have to start in straight
[43:21] away. So, I covet your undivided
[43:23] attention. And if you're moving about uh
[43:26] going in or out, that's which is normal.
[43:28] That happens in transition. So, and
[43:31] you're gathering your things. I just
[43:32] want you to try to focus on my voice and
[43:34] pay as much as close attention as you
[43:36] can because things are popping even
[43:39] right as I stand here. And I I want you
[43:42] to notice that the results of what can
[43:45] happen when everybody is in one mind and
[43:49] one accord. I want you to notice that in
[43:52] this heavenly crowd here that John is is
[43:56] caught up into in Revelation five, he
[43:59] sees a beautiful scene. Now, it's
[44:02] beautiful for a number of reasons.
[44:05] Number one, uh that I can think of is
[44:08] that in Revelation 5, you have all of
[44:10] this great host. You have all of these
[44:12] innumerable angels. You have the four
[44:14] and 20 elders. You have John standing
[44:17] there. You have a Thanks, sir. We have a
[44:19] strong angel representing a prophet in
[44:21] our day call. He's going to call for a
[44:23] mighty angel to come and and take the
[44:25] book and loose the seals. And that's
[44:27] going to be the most climactic moment uh
[44:30] in 2,000 years of Christian church
[44:32] history. Uh a complete return, a
[44:36] complete uh as brother Jason was saying
[44:38] today, that re in front of all of those
[44:40] words, it's God restoring back. God
[44:43] bringing something back. And and if and
[44:46] if he's bringing it back, then it's
[44:47] obvious that it's not still there. It
[44:49] had to be brought back. That should be
[44:52] clear. So So we it should not puzzle us
[44:56] that we find the world uh Christianity
[44:59] in a catastrophe. We find north of
[45:02] 33,000 different denominations, ideas,
[45:05] movements, groups, organizations, both
[45:08] independent
[45:10] denominational and non-denominational.
[45:13] But there's yet there's only one truth
[45:15] and there's only one way and there's
[45:16] only one Jesus.
[45:18] There's only one word.
[45:20] And so you can you can see how helpless
[45:23] how helpless mankind is if somebody
[45:28] doesn't turn on a light
[45:32] because in light is life. You see and
[45:35] the whole world is the problem that they
[45:38] have is death is death. see that you're
[45:42] you're you're dead. You're twice plucked
[45:44] up. You then the world doesn't realize
[45:46] that she's poor and miserable and naked.
[45:50] And brother Brandham said the most
[45:51] tragic part is she's blind. So she
[45:54] doesn't know.
[45:56] So God has so ordered it that he through
[46:00] his family. You hear through his family
[46:04] would be the final voice to the final
[46:06] age. Now, that's not every one of you
[46:08] getting up in this pull pit and doing
[46:10] what I'm doing right now, but that is me
[46:13] doing what you do every day out on the
[46:15] streets. Our life is a living voice.
[46:20] When John I want you to notice that when
[46:22] when John
[46:24] begins to say, "Everybody heard me say,
[46:29] you know something, friends, the John
[46:33] that was not new to John. John did that
[46:37] because that's how he lived in the
[46:39] earth. His voice, he was a written
[46:41] epistle. He knew that the apostle had
[46:44] said, "You're a written epistle read of
[46:46] all men." And John took that to heart
[46:48] and lived every day. And his life was a
[46:51] living voice to the world. An epistle
[46:54] read of all men.
[46:56] So it's not just in your words. It's not
[46:58] but it's in your chasteed conversation,
[47:00] which is your lifestyle.
[47:02] You cannot get around holiness, friends.
[47:05] You're never going to get around
[47:06] righteousness. Claim what you believe
[47:08] all you want, but but the but the proof
[47:11] is in the manifestation. You you say, "I
[47:15] have a revelation." Well, then show me
[47:17] say, "I know Christ. Then show me that."
[47:22] That's this is exactly why the Greeks
[47:25] when they in their in Greek philosophy
[47:28] that if you can come up and quote
[47:30] something or give an exhortation or
[47:33] write an essay then they'll say okay you
[47:35] know it but the Hebrews are completely
[47:37] different that's not how they measure
[47:39] they never measured uh knowledge by
[47:42] intelligence they measured knowledge
[47:44] when you could produce it
[47:46] when your life became what you are
[47:48] saying they say now he knows Jehovah
[47:52] He's a He's a This is how Abraham became
[47:55] a friend of God. Imagine that being
[47:59] called the friend of God. So close that
[48:01] even God said to his other accompanying
[48:04] angels, "Can we hide anything from
[48:06] Abraham? I can't even keep my my most
[48:10] trusted secret. I can't keep it from
[48:11] him. Abraham, I'm going to tell you what
[48:13] I'm going to do." Oh my. That's not the
[48:16] revelation that that Sodom got. All they
[48:18] got was God went down there and took out
[48:21] the unwise virgin and said, "Run for
[48:23] your lives."
[48:27] So, we find that in this great scene,
[48:31] you find that you had all of these
[48:33] innumerable angels. You had the 120 140
[48:36] the uh the 24 elders. You had the the
[48:39] strong angel, the mighty angel, John
[48:41] representing the bride. You had the four
[48:44] living creatures. You had all of these
[48:45] things at the time when the seals are
[48:48] being opened. What you do not have is
[48:52] the accuser.
[48:55] Satan is nowhere in Revelation 5. Why?
[48:59] Because once those seals have been taken
[49:01] and broken and the word has now been
[49:04] brought back to the people and they've
[49:05] eaten the book, then there now you have
[49:08] returned. There is now therefore no
[49:11] condemnation to them which are in
[49:13] Christ.
[49:15] You cannot be accused. He will not hear
[49:17] it. You cannot be indicted. You cannot
[49:20] be brought up on charges. You have
[49:22] complete diplomatic immunity
[49:28] from judgment.
[49:30] You are above the law
[49:33] because you're in Christ who fulfilled
[49:35] the law.
[49:37] You see, it's not something unfair.
[49:40] Christ fulfilled the law. Amen.
[49:42] You're in Christ.
[49:44] So now with Christ, when he ascended,
[49:46] you ascended. See? And so, so we find
[49:50] that now he's saying with a loud voice,
[49:52] worthy is the lamb that was slain. No
[49:54] wonder because
[49:57] John had lived a life exactly like what
[50:01] you're hearing. And he said, "Blessing
[50:05] and honor and glory and power." They all
[50:08] heard me saying, I want to ask you today
[50:11] on this Easter Sunday that he has risen.
[50:17] People say, "Oh, Calvary was enough."
[50:21] Really, so you don't need the
[50:23] resurrection.
[50:25] Oh. Oh, well, yeah, of course. Okay.
[50:26] Okay. The resurrection, too. Okay. What
[50:28] about the ascension?
[50:30] Okay. Well, the ascension, too. What
[50:31] about what about when he came back down
[50:33] in the upper room
[50:35] and filled all the house
[50:37] and lived in their lives and proved he
[50:39] was alive when he went through the book
[50:40] of Acts? What do you think the book of
[50:42] Acts is?
[50:43] People deciding to do good deeds. It's
[50:45] not that. It's not people trying to be
[50:47] Christians. It's people who are filled
[50:49] with the life of God.
[50:53] So much so that sinners looked at their
[50:56] life and said, "We need a name. We're
[51:00] going to call you guys Christians
[51:04] because you are so similar to Christ.
[51:10] See,
[51:12] so they've got all kinds of names. They
[51:14] Today's the day of name calling.
[51:16] I don't care what they call me. They're
[51:19] going to call me gone.
[51:21] I know that. That's all I care about.
[51:23] They'll call me gone one of these days.
[51:26] Hallelujah.
[51:28] So it's important that you see this
[51:30] heavenly setting. We find that that it's
[51:33] important that you understand that
[51:36] Revelation 5 and Revelation 4
[51:40] are the same event. I'm going to show
[51:42] you that just in a minute. We're going
[51:43] to go to Revelation 4. But I I I want to
[51:46] make the point first because if you
[51:49] don't see this connection,
[51:53] then you're left with brother Brandham
[51:55] saying very accurately, mind you, that
[51:58] the church goes up at the end of chapter
[52:01] 3 and is not seen again until she comes
[52:04] riding out on white horses in chapter
[52:06] 19.
[52:08] And from once the bride goes home, the
[52:10] gospel under the trumpets, under the
[52:12] seventh trumpet goes to Israel. And
[52:14] you're saying, 'Well, goodness gracious.
[52:16] Well, what about Revelation 5 and
[52:18] Revelation 10 and all? I thought this
[52:19] was all about the bride. It is. Brother
[52:21] Brandham shows us that in Revelation
[52:24] five, yes, the church goes up at the end
[52:27] of chapter three because that's the last
[52:30] age. And there's not an eighth age for
[52:32] the Gentiles. Once she leaves at the end
[52:35] of the seventh age, the gospel, the
[52:37] anointing, that eagle anointing, flies
[52:39] east, picks up two prophets, Moses and
[52:42] Elijah, and takes the Holy Ghost message
[52:44] of the hour to to the 144,000. And they
[52:47] become believers like you are a
[52:49] believer, right?
[52:50] And they get born again like you're born
[52:52] again. And they're part of the first
[52:53] resurrection, like you're part of the
[52:55] first resurrection.
[52:57] And they go up and they'll be in the
[52:59] millennium, the unwise virgin or not.
[53:02] She gets saved from destruction in the
[53:04] end, but she's not born again at any
[53:06] time. She's granted eternal life. She's
[53:08] had a work of the Holy Ghost in her
[53:10] flesh and in her spirit, but she's not
[53:12] passed from death to life. Otherwise,
[53:13] you won't see her at the judgment in
[53:15] Matthew 25. It' be impossible.
[53:17] Otherwise, Jesus broke his word because
[53:20] whoever's believed on him has passed
[53:21] from death to life and can never come
[53:23] into the judgment. John 5:24. So the
[53:25] very fact that she's standing and you
[53:27] see the the the the question today,
[53:29] listen friends, the question today h has
[53:33] never been will I stand at the judgment
[53:35] seat of Christ. We all Paul said will
[53:38] stand at the judgment seat of Christ and
[53:40] give an account of our deeds whether
[53:42] good or bad. The question is not not
[53:44] ever been will I. The question is what
[53:47] position will I be when I'm there?
[53:50] I will either be in front of the throne
[53:52] being judged or I'll be seated with him
[53:54] on the throne judging.
[53:58] Say, "Well, what makes the difference?"
[54:00] The people seated on the throne with
[54:02] him, all of their sins went ahead of
[54:04] their arrival and were met in Christ
[54:06] when he showed up with his bloody body.
[54:09] Hallelujah. And that atonement, all my
[54:12] sins were in him. Even sins, you say,
[54:15] "Even sins I hadn't even committed yet."
[54:17] You hadn't even been born yet.
[54:21] Hallelujah.
[54:23] The ones who stand before the throne
[54:25] being judged are those whose sins follow
[54:28] them. Trust me, they follow you.
[54:33] No amount of good deeds gets that off of
[54:36] you.
[54:37] You can't earn eternal life like that.
[54:40] See,
[54:42] you're it God's looking at the heart.
[54:43] Your heart response. How did the foolish
[54:46] virgin get in? Because of their heart
[54:48] response to the word at whatever level
[54:50] God revealed it.
[54:53] So, so if you're not careful, so brother
[54:56] Brandham comes back to Revelation 5. So,
[54:58] he says, "So, what what are we seeing
[54:59] here?" Yes, the church went up at the
[55:02] end of chapter 3. That's for sure
[55:04] because we don't have an eighth age and
[55:05] we don't need an eighth messenger. But,
[55:08] but brother Brandham says, "Now here in
[55:10] chapter five," and I'm paraphrasing the
[55:12] prophet. You can go into the seals and
[55:14] get it yourself. He says he's showing
[55:16] here how he did it. How did he pull it
[55:19] off? How did he get that last day bride
[55:23] when she was so broken, so blind, so
[55:27] naked, so miserable, no way to go in a
[55:30] rapture in her condition and no way to
[55:32] improve because she kicked Christ out.
[55:35] So how did he do it? Revelation five is
[55:37] going to show you that a strong angel
[55:39] stood on the earth and called for a
[55:40] mighty angel and a mighty angel came and
[55:43] opened the seals and sent grace down to
[55:45] his bride.
[55:48] So chapter five is showing how he did
[55:50] it. So then so then the point you have
[55:53] to realize is is chapter 4 is the
[55:57] opening scene to chapter 5. Don't lose
[56:01] sight of that. See Revelation 4 1:3. I'm
[56:05] just going to show you this. We're going
[56:06] to catch catch these three verses and
[56:08] then we'll jump to uh chapter 5 and I'll
[56:10] show you the continuity.
[56:12] Revelation 4:1. After this, I looked,
[56:16] and behold, a door was opened in heaven,
[56:19] and the first voice which I heard was as
[56:21] it were of a trumpet talking with me,
[56:23] which said, "Come up hither, and I will
[56:25] show thee things which must be
[56:27] hereafter." And immediately I was in the
[56:30] spirit, and behold, a throne was set in
[56:32] heaven. Look at this now. So he comes
[56:35] up. He a door is opened. He's caught up.
[56:38] And when he's caught up, he sees a
[56:40] throne set up. Amen. All right. A a a a
[56:45] throne was set in heaven. And one, not
[56:48] two, not three.
[56:51] Sorry, trinitarian friends, but when
[56:54] John saw him on the throne, when John
[56:55] saw the throne room of God, there was
[56:57] only one throne.
[56:58] And there was only one seated on that
[57:00] throne.
[57:00] See?
[57:02] All right. So, and he that sat upon
[57:09] And he that sat was to look upon like a
[57:12] jasper and a sardan stone. So, there's
[57:14] no question who this is. And there was a
[57:16] rainbow about the throne in sight
[57:19] likened to an emerald. We don't have
[57:21] time to break those stones down, but you
[57:22] can see it's certainly Christ. So, now
[57:25] watch round about the throne in sight
[57:27] like into an emerald. Revelation 51.
[57:31] And I saw in the right hand of him that
[57:33] sat on the throne.
[57:36] So you see it's the same scene. He's
[57:38] caught up into a throne room scene and
[57:41] he's describing and says his he had
[57:43] Jasper and Sard and rainbow was about
[57:45] his throne and all these different
[57:46] things were going on and then he comes
[57:48] in. Translators added it made that a
[57:50] fifth chapter hundreds of years later
[57:52] and John didn't have that in his in his
[57:54] letter.
[57:55] It's the same scene. And I saw in the
[57:56] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[57:59] a book written within on the backside
[58:01] and sealed the seven seals. So, so you
[58:04] can see that that chapter. So now I can
[58:08] say with author prophetic authority that
[58:12] yes the church goes in a rapture in time
[58:15] at the end of the seventh age. But how
[58:18] did he pull it off when it was
[58:20] impossible for that to happen? Chapter 4
[58:23] and chapter five tell me a door that's
[58:26] Christ. A door is always Christ was
[58:29] opened a revelation and I was caught up
[58:32] into a mystery and and what did the
[58:34] mystery revealed? One seated on the
[58:36] throne.
[58:38] Hallelujah. See verse two, Revelation
[58:42] 5:2. And I saw a strong angel proclaim
[58:45] with a loud voice, who is worthy to open
[58:48] the book and to loose the seals thereof?
[58:49] No man in heaven, nor in earth, nor
[58:51] under the earth, was able to open the
[58:52] book, neither to look thereon. And I
[58:54] wept much, because no man was found
[58:57] worthy to open and to read the book,
[59:00] neither to look thereon. And one of the
[59:03] elders,
[59:06] one of the elders,
[59:08] you know, John himself was an elder. And
[59:12] one of the elders, I mean, is he hearing
[59:13] from his theophony?
[59:15] And one of the elders saith unto me,
[59:18] weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe
[59:20] of Judah, the root of David, hath
[59:22] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[59:24] the seals, seven seals thereof. Oh,
[59:28] cheer up, little bride. It's the
[59:30] father's good pleasure to give you the
[59:31] kingdom. Stop crying, bride. Doesn't
[59:34] matter. You know, you've heard from your
[59:37] theophony. There's there's a happy land
[59:39] waiting on us. Amen.
[59:43] So this this this idea now of being
[59:46] lifted up,
[59:48] see my my title is lifting lifting up
[59:51] Christ to the world one last time in
[59:55] history.
[59:57] And in order for Christ to be lifted up
[1:00:03] by people coming in contact with you,
[1:00:07] you have to be lifted up.
[1:00:10] You have to see him out above the ages.
[1:00:13] What you have to see more than the ages
[1:00:15] could see. You have to see it's more
[1:00:18] than Luther and Wesley and Isuza
[1:00:20] revival. Those are all parts of the
[1:00:22] restoration of the bride tree. You
[1:00:24] scarcely do away with any one of them
[1:00:25] because they're all part of the
[1:00:26] restoration. But I'm here to tell you
[1:00:28] something, friends. Now, the fruit is in
[1:00:31] the top of the tree and the presence of
[1:00:33] the sun is shining on it to ripen it.
[1:00:35] Amen.
[1:00:37] This is how you're going in a rapture.
[1:00:40] Hallelujah. Because the seed that is in
[1:00:42] you, as brother JD was saying today, the
[1:00:44] seed that is in you, where did that come
[1:00:46] from? That didn't that's not something
[1:00:47] somebody gave you or you went and
[1:00:49] acquired it yourself. This came from
[1:00:51] God. That gene, you were in Christ
[1:00:54] before the foundation of the world.
[1:00:56] Amen.
[1:01:00] So when he is lifted up, he said that if
[1:01:03] I be lifted up, I'll draw all men to me.
[1:01:06] I promise you, he's not. He has no plans
[1:01:11] and no prophecy to show up in this day
[1:01:15] and go get crucified again.
[1:01:18] So, how do you imagine he's going to be
[1:01:20] lifted up to draw all men?
[1:01:24] If it's not you and I, then who is it?
[1:01:29] When I look in the scripture, I see that
[1:01:32] John carrying on what he had been used
[1:01:35] to doing. I love that, friends. You
[1:01:38] know, you you can see the old old habits
[1:01:40] are hard to break. You can see those
[1:01:43] standing there in Matthew 25 and they're
[1:01:46] they're trying to claim their works, but
[1:01:49] their heart was full of iniquity, which
[1:01:52] means they knew they knew they knew what
[1:01:54] they really were. You know, they're
[1:01:56] they're you say, "Why would they do
[1:01:57] that?" Because they were used to doing
[1:01:58] that.
[1:02:00] They They had been doing that their
[1:02:01] whole life in the earth, going to
[1:02:03] church, playing like a Christian.
[1:02:06] See, like like the old advertisement,
[1:02:09] the guy says he comes on in a white coat
[1:02:11] and he goes, "I'm not a doctor, but I
[1:02:13] play one on TV."
[1:02:15] And somehow that's supposed to embibe
[1:02:17] you with confidence. And the guy's just
[1:02:20] an actor. He don't know the first thing
[1:02:21] about medicine. See, and so I I don't
[1:02:24] want to stand up here and say, "Uh, I'm
[1:02:26] not actually a Christian, but I play one
[1:02:28] on Sunday mornings."
[1:02:31] And so this is what they were used to
[1:02:33] doing. They had been doing that their
[1:02:34] whole life. Quite naturally when they
[1:02:36] get in front of the throne, they're
[1:02:37] going to try to say, "Hey, wait a
[1:02:38] minute. Look at all of our works. But
[1:02:40] this time, they don't realize that the
[1:02:42] king uns
[1:02:49] the unwise virgin who get eternal life.
[1:02:52] Those kind of the bride, the unwise
[1:02:53] virgin of various categories. It's some
[1:02:56] somewhat ambiguous all the various
[1:02:58] categories. There's five or six of them
[1:02:59] there that brother Brandham hints to.
[1:03:01] you understand that they they're very
[1:03:05] happy to find out that they're getting
[1:03:06] life. They're very happy. And I'm glad I
[1:03:09] did those things, but I I really don't
[1:03:12] remember doing them. You see, because
[1:03:15] their their life of goodness was just so
[1:03:19] automatic.
[1:03:21] It was just so automatic. They were
[1:03:24] humble people and merciful people and
[1:03:27] gracious people and and and and and and
[1:03:30] the king knew that and he can't condemn
[1:03:32] them because you say what's going to
[1:03:34] condemn sin. Well, what's sin? Unbelief.
[1:03:37] But you can't disbelieve what you don't
[1:03:39] know.
[1:03:40] So they can't he can't convict them of
[1:03:42] sin otherwise they go to hell.
[1:03:44] See? So but they they followed him in
[1:03:47] their heart. Their heart responded to
[1:03:49] the word in every way he revealed it.
[1:03:52] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:03:54] Oh, I'm so glad to know, friends, I I
[1:03:57] made this statement here some time ago.
[1:03:59] Not everyone that goes in the
[1:04:01] tribulation is going to hell. There's
[1:04:03] going to be some people saved out of
[1:04:04] that thing. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:04:07] See, so it's the whole idea of lifting
[1:04:12] up Christ out of history. That's why
[1:04:14] brother Brandon would take those kind of
[1:04:16] titles, lifting him up out of history.
[1:04:19] You know, Brother Brandon would take a
[1:04:20] title, the identified Christ of all
[1:04:23] ages.
[1:04:25] See, he would come to the pulpit and he
[1:04:27] would say, "We're going to preach on the
[1:04:29] unveiling of God." And then he hits he
[1:04:31] hits the evangelistic trail and he he he
[1:04:34] adds to the title, "This is the mighty
[1:04:36] God unveiled."
[1:04:38] My he he's he's trying to prove a point.
[1:04:40] He's trying to show the people what has
[1:04:42] happened in the day and hour. And
[1:04:44] they're sitting there blind. But but
[1:04:46] there are a few. Brother Renham said
[1:04:48] there in Chicago, he said in a prayer,
[1:04:49] he said, "Lord, now we don't know who
[1:04:52] all is your." He said, "I don't know who
[1:04:54] all is your children, but I know by that
[1:04:56] vision the other day, remember the
[1:04:57] preview of the bride."
[1:04:59] He said, "I know by that vision there's
[1:05:01] some of them out here, and all I'm doing
[1:05:03] is casting seed. I'm just casting the
[1:05:06] seed. It'll find the right bedding
[1:05:08] ground and you'll water it and it'll
[1:05:10] come forward." And and that was such a
[1:05:11] comfort to the prophet
[1:05:16] lifting him up out of history,
[1:05:19] lifting up Christ to the world
[1:05:23] one last time
[1:05:25] in history. You are that people. I hope
[1:05:29] you absorb that today. If you will, then
[1:05:33] my mission is accomplished. I I can tell
[1:05:36] you that that has become the
[1:05:38] allconsuming
[1:05:40] desire. I think about it day and night.
[1:05:44] Lord, less of the world, more of you.
[1:05:48] Less of the world, more of you. Less of
[1:05:51] the world, more of you. I want to get
[1:05:53] say how far till I can get none of the
[1:05:55] world. And all of him. I I go to I wake
[1:05:59] up thinking about it. I go to sleep
[1:06:00] thinking about it. I go to my knees
[1:06:02] thinking about it. I I go in my office
[1:06:04] thinking about it. Lord, more of you.
[1:06:07] Oh my.
[1:06:09] To lift him up in history. Emma Lazarus
[1:06:12] wrote her uh poem, the called the new
[1:06:15] Colossus. And you know, it's it's it's
[1:06:18] uh on the on the plate there at the on
[1:06:21] the on the platform, the foundation of
[1:06:22] what we call the Statue of Liberty
[1:06:26] uh donation to us from from the French
[1:06:29] people. And Emma Lazarus wrote a poem
[1:06:32] called the New Colossus. and it took off
[1:06:34] and went viral before there was such a
[1:06:36] thing. And and uh you know they call her
[1:06:39] Lady Liberty. Actually her her real name
[1:06:41] is the mother of exiles.
[1:06:44] And she says these very inspirational
[1:06:46] words Lazarus in her poem. This is just
[1:06:49] a fragment of it. It's a message to the
[1:06:52] world. Keep ancient lands your storied
[1:06:56] pomp, cries she with silent lips. Give
[1:07:01] me your tired, your poor, your huddled
[1:07:04] masses yearning to breathe free, the
[1:07:07] wretched refues of your teeming shore.
[1:07:11] Send these, the homeless, tempest tossed
[1:07:14] to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden
[1:07:18] door.
[1:07:22] You know, it's not the only time that
[1:07:27] such inspirational
[1:07:29] words have come. Prophets who were
[1:07:32] caught up into great atmospheres of God
[1:07:34] came back and could scarcely put into
[1:07:37] human language the things that they had
[1:07:39] saw. Even Paul said, "I can't even
[1:07:41] things that I s that I heard are not
[1:07:43] even lawful to speak."
[1:07:46] See,
[1:07:47] now you know what? This is just Brother
[1:07:49] Jason. When I look at that and I go, hm,
[1:07:52] so what is in the law that's unlawful to
[1:07:56] say? There's a lot of things in the law
[1:07:57] unlawful to do. But what's the one thing
[1:08:00] that I know of in the law that's
[1:08:02] unlawful to say? And that's the very
[1:08:05] thing Jesus said, I and my father are
[1:08:09] one.
[1:08:10] And they took up stones to stone him.
[1:08:12] And prophet alludes to that. When you
[1:08:14] say, I and my father are one, that's
[1:08:15] when they take up stones to stone you.
[1:08:17] And Paul was caught up to the third
[1:08:18] heaven much like what John saw and
[1:08:21] heard. No doubt heard. Oh, oh, like you
[1:08:24] read in the book. You have been called
[1:08:26] like he wrote Paul wrote in Hebrews 12.
[1:08:28] No wonder he could write. You've come to
[1:08:29] Mount Zion, to the city of the great
[1:08:32] king, to the souls of just men made
[1:08:34] perfect to an innumerable host of
[1:08:36] angels. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And Paul
[1:08:38] said, I heard things that aren't lawful
[1:08:40] to say. I'm here to tell you, I just
[1:08:42] wonder if if we if we have our
[1:08:44] representation there saying he and I are
[1:08:47] one. He and I are one. And Paul said, my
[1:08:50] goodness, it's not even lawful to say
[1:08:52] such a thing. And that was the mystery
[1:08:54] that he tried to bring back to the
[1:08:56] church. She is him.
[1:09:00] The prophet didn't pull that out of thin
[1:09:02] air. He got that from the apostle.
[1:09:05] She is him.
[1:09:07] She's a continuation of him.
[1:09:12] You find in Isaiah 6, a great lifting
[1:09:15] up. And in Isaiah 6, Isaiah here being
[1:09:19] caught up into the same throne room as
[1:09:22] John. It's beautiful when you go into
[1:09:23] the Old Testament, you get certain
[1:09:25] passages and then you go over into the
[1:09:27] book of Revelation and you get a little
[1:09:29] more detail or maybe get a little more
[1:09:30] detail here and something's left out
[1:09:32] here. You know, you you you come to
[1:09:34] Ezekiel's promise of in the millennium
[1:09:37] and Ezekiel talks about the tree of life
[1:09:40] that it'll be there for medicine.
[1:09:43] Wait, what? In the millennium? Why we
[1:09:46] need medicine? And you don't really know
[1:09:48] until you get over to John. And when
[1:09:50] John writes it, he says, "It's for the
[1:09:52] healing of the nations. It's to keep
[1:09:54] peace. It's not sick bodies."
[1:09:57] See? So, so you you know you you you see
[1:10:00] John, he goes into chapter 21 and he
[1:10:03] sees a river of life
[1:10:06] and it's flowing from the throne and on
[1:10:08] either side is is the singular tree of
[1:10:10] life. So, what does that even look like?
[1:10:12] There's one big tree spanning a river
[1:10:14] flowing from the throne. Where? What do
[1:10:16] you mean? What does that even mean? What
[1:10:17] does that look like? And you don't even
[1:10:19] really know till you go back into
[1:10:20] Ezekiel and Ezekiel lets you know that
[1:10:23] it's actually flowing from underneath
[1:10:25] the throne. So, it's a river of life
[1:10:27] issuing from under the throne. And on
[1:10:30] either side of this river are trees
[1:10:33] plural because it's not just Christ. No
[1:10:36] wonder it's on both sides. It's he and
[1:10:38] her. It's Mr. and Mrs.. It's a many
[1:10:40] membered bride. Hallelujah. Oh, what a
[1:10:43] our future is bright on this Easter
[1:10:45] morning, friends. Our future is bright.
[1:10:50] Oh my.
[1:10:52] So, he sees here Isaiah 6:1. You good?
[1:10:55] Yeah.
[1:10:57] Isaiah 6:1.
[1:10:59] In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw
[1:11:02] also the Lord sitting upon a throne high
[1:11:07] and lifted up and his train, his skirts,
[1:11:11] his garments filled the temple. It
[1:11:15] doesn't that's why it doesn't surprise
[1:11:16] me. And in fact, as um uh Matthew Henry
[1:11:20] alludes to that same thought that isn't
[1:11:23] it curious that when oh my don't get me
[1:11:26] preaching on this when Ruth is laying at
[1:11:29] the foot of Boaz and what does she say?
[1:11:32] He wakes up and she says pull your skirt
[1:11:35] over me.
[1:11:36] What was she doing? She was asking for
[1:11:38] marriage. Hallelujah.
[1:11:40] Oh and he said daughter you've been more
[1:11:42] faithful. I'll grant your request.
[1:11:44] Hallelujah. And when John when when
[1:11:46] Isaiah sees him, he's high and lifted up
[1:11:49] and his skirt, his train fills the
[1:11:51] temple.
[1:11:54] Above it stood the seraraphim. Each one
[1:11:56] had six wings. Look at this scene. With
[1:11:58] twain he covered his face. That's see.
[1:12:01] And with twain he covered his feet. With
[1:12:03] twain he did fly. And brother Brandon
[1:12:05] breaks it all down about humility and
[1:12:06] flight and and uh and and and the honor
[1:12:10] to God. standing and one cried unto
[1:12:11] another
[1:12:13] and said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
[1:12:17] of hosts, and the whole earth is full of
[1:12:21] his glory." And the post of the door
[1:12:24] moved at the voice of him that cried,
[1:12:27] and the house was filled with smoke,
[1:12:29] very much like the upper room experience
[1:12:32] of chapter 2 and Acts chapter 2 and Acts
[1:12:35] chapter 4 again. See? And so so so we
[1:12:40] find out that the post of the door
[1:12:42] moves. So so when so let me say it like
[1:12:45] this. So when he is lifted up in
[1:12:49] holiness,
[1:12:51] when his when his voice can go by the
[1:12:56] Holy Ghost through his family to the
[1:12:59] world, I'm here to tell you when you are
[1:13:01] that person, that's when he will move in
[1:13:05] your temple as well. Hallelujah. The
[1:13:08] post of the door was moved in the
[1:13:10] temple. I want him to move in my temple.
[1:13:13] What's the What's the key? Give me the
[1:13:15] key. Give me the secret. Make him high
[1:13:17] and lifted up. Lift him up.
[1:13:21] So, how do I lift him up in your life?
[1:13:25] This is the meaning of Easter. He rose
[1:13:28] up.
[1:13:32] Verse five. Then said I,
[1:13:35] woe is me. Now watch what this will do.
[1:13:38] For I am undone. Here's what the spirit
[1:13:41] of God will do to a worshipper.
[1:13:44] Then said I, woe is me, for I am undone
[1:13:47] because I am a man of unclean lips.
[1:13:49] There's an honest confession from a
[1:13:51] prophet.
[1:13:52] I mean, you you're not going to go in
[1:13:54] here and find one record of Isaiah ever
[1:13:59] transgressing God's word. Never. No
[1:14:02] record of it.
[1:14:05] But you know why God brought him in
[1:14:06] here?
[1:14:08] Because he he was enamored with the
[1:14:11] king.
[1:14:13] And there was a little bit of thing in
[1:14:15] his heart where all of his confidence
[1:14:17] was in King Hezekiah.
[1:14:20] And and and uh and and I mean Uzziah,
[1:14:23] I'm sorry. And so he says, "Is that did
[1:14:26] I get that right?" Yeah. King King
[1:14:27] Uzziah. And so when King Uzziah
[1:14:30] had a fatal flaw, you know what his
[1:14:33] fatal flaw was? He had a temper.
[1:14:36] He had uncontrolled temper and he
[1:14:39] couldn't keep it in check. And he goes
[1:14:41] into the house trying to do God a
[1:14:43] service without it being his will. Tried
[1:14:45] to step out of his calling. He was a
[1:14:46] king, not a priest. And he tried to
[1:14:48] offer sacrifice. And the loyal priest
[1:14:50] tried to stop him. And he turned red in
[1:14:52] the face. And he got angry and is ready
[1:14:55] to kill people. And the Lord because
[1:14:58] that was sin. And so the Lord struck him
[1:15:00] with the sin disease, leprosy. And we
[1:15:02] find out that he never got healed and he
[1:15:04] died.
[1:15:06] And that blew Isaiah's mind. This man
[1:15:09] that he had had such confidence in when
[1:15:12] he saw his human side. It shook him. And
[1:15:15] so God said, "Come in here and let me
[1:15:16] show you what you should have been
[1:15:17] looking at all along."
[1:15:20] See, the bottom line is friends, it's
[1:15:24] not my brother or my sister, but it's
[1:15:27] me, oh Lord.
[1:15:30] Standing in the need of prayer.
[1:15:32] You can take your pitchforks and burn
[1:15:35] them.
[1:15:37] We're not pitching it on to one another.
[1:15:38] We're not here judging one another. I'm
[1:15:40] so glad that spirit does not exist in
[1:15:43] this church.
[1:15:44] And if it did, I would have shot it a
[1:15:46] long time ago.
[1:15:47] Hallelujah. We're all for one and one
[1:15:49] for all.
[1:15:51] And and we're we're we're geared in
[1:15:53] mercy and we're geared in grace. And I'm
[1:15:55] I the Lord has allowed me to gear you
[1:15:57] like that. And I'm so glad cuz I might
[1:15:59] stumble and I'd want your grace and I'd
[1:16:01] want your mercy and you might stumble. I
[1:16:03] promise you you'll have my grace and my
[1:16:05] mercy.
[1:16:08] And so he's he sees God lifted up. And
[1:16:12] when he does, then said I, woe is me,
[1:16:14] for I am undone because I am a man of
[1:16:16] unclean lips.
[1:16:18] and I dwell in the midst of a people of
[1:16:20] unclean lips. For mine eyes have seen
[1:16:22] the king,
[1:16:25] the Lord of host. So this is when sin
[1:16:31] will be seen for the sin it is.
[1:16:35] When you
[1:16:37] are willing to come into the presence of
[1:16:40] God,
[1:16:41] lifting him up in your life, amen,
[1:16:44] then I'm here to tell you, you'll be a
[1:16:47] light. You'll be a voice and people will
[1:16:50] be a blind people who can't see sin for
[1:16:53] sin. They call right wrong and wrong
[1:16:55] right. That's the that's the plague on
[1:16:57] the last day that mankind would lose the
[1:16:59] natural im ability, the natural
[1:17:02] intrinsic ability to to discern between
[1:17:05] right and wrong. And he would take
[1:17:06] something for 20 centuries that's been
[1:17:08] called wrong and say, "Oh, no, we were
[1:17:10] all wrong there. It's just right now."
[1:17:12] And everything that that that was right
[1:17:15] and things to stand for and bring it
[1:17:17] over here today and call you every name
[1:17:19] in the book because you're living right.
[1:17:23] It's madness. It's insanity. It's
[1:17:25] mental.
[1:17:27] And and how's the world ever going to
[1:17:29] recover from it? Listen, friends, the
[1:17:31] only way is when Christ can be lifted up
[1:17:33] in your life and you see your own sin
[1:17:36] and then you God comes to your rescue
[1:17:38] and then you can be a rescue to the
[1:17:40] world around you.
[1:17:42] That's what Easter is about. He has
[1:17:44] risen. So I have risen.
[1:17:48] The blind world can't see their sin. And
[1:17:50] that's the tragedy that we see today
[1:17:53] among humanity.
[1:17:55] Prophets saw them going over a cliff,
[1:17:57] plunging into an abyss, hypnotized by a
[1:18:00] witch, lost in a trance of worldly music
[1:18:03] and Satan's Eden.
[1:18:06] But look what can happen when sin is
[1:18:09] made clearly
[1:18:11] to a worshipper.
[1:18:14] When you are willing to live in such a
[1:18:16] way in your worship to God, because
[1:18:19] that's what your life is. It's a worship
[1:18:21] to God. When you're willing to lay aside
[1:18:24] every weight and sin that doth so easily
[1:18:26] beset you and run the race with
[1:18:28] patience, then you are a lightbearer.
[1:18:32] You have a lightsaber.
[1:18:36] Hallelujah.
[1:18:37] You got a much greater force than Lucas
[1:18:40] ever thought about. Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:18:45] I'm glad at least he admitted that he
[1:18:47] got his concept out of the Bible. He
[1:18:48] admitted that publicly.
[1:18:51] Verse six. Now look at the result. When
[1:18:55] you own when you own it. Then flew one
[1:18:57] of the seraraphims unto me, having a
[1:18:59] live coal in his hand, which he had
[1:19:01] taken with the tongs from off the altar.
[1:19:02] He laid it on my mouth and said, "Lo,
[1:19:05] this hath touched thy lips, and thine
[1:19:07] iniquity is taken away, and thy sin is
[1:19:10] purged." So how will he be made clear?
[1:19:14] Who who is going to identify sin and
[1:19:17] take a clear stand of separation?
[1:19:20] Separation not just from godliness to
[1:19:23] ungodliness. Let me give you a little
[1:19:25] more defined picture. How about fervent
[1:19:29] Holy Ghost life versus lukewarm
[1:19:31] Christianity?
[1:19:33] Well, that cuts a little closer, don't
[1:19:35] it?
[1:19:36] You know, you know it it's it's all
[1:19:38] about I'm in a church. Well, is he in
[1:19:40] you? That's the question.
[1:19:43] If he's in me, I'm always in church.
[1:19:45] I am the church.
[1:19:47] Hallelujah.
[1:19:50] I was listening to a song the other day,
[1:19:52] some worship song. I truly don't
[1:19:53] remember the name of it.
[1:19:56] Um, don't even remember why I was
[1:19:57] listening to it, but I was taken. It
[1:19:59] wasn't a video. I was just listening. It
[1:20:01] must have came up on my autoplay.
[1:20:04] and and and and and
[1:20:06] I have no idea even what the song was
[1:20:08] and that's fine because I don't know who
[1:20:09] that was and I make no judgment about I
[1:20:11] don't even remember the song but I just
[1:20:12] remember what put me to thinking as I
[1:20:15] was driving along and they kept talking
[1:20:18] about they kept repeating the name Jesus
[1:20:21] and it was a song that just said that
[1:20:23] over and over and I can think of several
[1:20:24] songs that are like that and it wasn't
[1:20:26] any of those that I had ever heard
[1:20:28] before but they're but you know they're
[1:20:30] constantly repeating the name Jesus and
[1:20:33] every few bars Jesus Jesus and a few
[1:20:35] more bars Jesus and a few more bars
[1:20:37] Jesus.
[1:20:38] And and I you can imagine in my mind
[1:20:41] thinking about lifting him high, lifting
[1:20:44] him up to the world this last time in
[1:20:46] history because this is the last time in
[1:20:47] history. The ages are over. There will
[1:20:50] not be another age.
[1:20:52] See now the age the ages are over but
[1:20:55] the age the last age is still going on
[1:20:58] because he still has mercy and he's
[1:21:00] still saving and he's still calling.
[1:21:02] That's what brother Brandham directly
[1:21:03] said.
[1:21:04] See, the ages are over, but thank God
[1:21:06] the age he's still calling.
[1:21:09] He's calling until we leave here.
[1:21:12] See, so so I I think about how many
[1:21:15] times the name Jesus I I got to
[1:21:18] thinking. I thought, you know, how sad
[1:21:19] it is how many times the name Jesus or
[1:21:23] Jesus Christ
[1:21:26] is spoken in the world. I thought about
[1:21:29] what what a what an impact this world
[1:21:32] has been under on this name Jesus
[1:21:36] Christ.
[1:21:38] I mean, you know, coming from one
[1:21:41] obscure
[1:21:43] itinerate preacher,
[1:21:46] no degrees, no home church,
[1:21:50] didn't need to carry a Bible because he
[1:21:52] was the word.
[1:21:54] rejected by all of the religious
[1:21:57] denominations of his day. All of the
[1:21:59] independent spiritual movements rejected
[1:22:01] him. The people heard him gladly.
[1:22:05] See, but the h the hierarchy they they
[1:22:08] wanted to kill him. They wanted to call
[1:22:11] themselves sons of Abraham. The JD was
[1:22:13] on today. When they said we we be of
[1:22:17] Abraham, Abraham is our father. Jesus
[1:22:19] didn't contend with that. He didn't deny
[1:22:21] that. Well, it wouldn't have done him
[1:22:23] any good because he they could go right
[1:22:24] in and pull out their family records. My
[1:22:26] daddy, his daddy, his daddy, his daddy,
[1:22:28] his daddy, his daddy, d Abraham, and
[1:22:31] they could prove it. See, so Jesus, he
[1:22:34] said, "I know you're Abraham's children.
[1:22:35] However, now let me talk about another
[1:22:37] version of you." See, there's another
[1:22:40] you. There's there's a you and there's
[1:22:42] another you. And he said, "This other
[1:22:45] you seeks to kill me. I know there's a
[1:22:48] part of you that's Abraham's seed, but
[1:22:50] there's something else down inside you
[1:22:52] that seeks to kill me. And Abraham
[1:22:54] didn't do that. I'm sorry. Abraham
[1:22:56] rejoiced to see my day. You're the
[1:22:58] opposite of Abraham. You're
[1:23:00] anti-Arabham.
[1:23:02] And that made them even more mad.
[1:23:03] See,
[1:23:05] we can't apologize for the truth.
[1:23:08] Some are most are going to get mad. They
[1:23:10] always have. But some are going to find
[1:23:12] life. And that's the ones I'm trying to
[1:23:14] find. And that's the ones I'm trying to
[1:23:15] lift up Christ to. See, and so you think
[1:23:19] about the global impact.
[1:23:22] Think about, you know, uh the true
[1:23:25] global impact of that name and who it
[1:23:29] represents. Whole nations.
[1:23:31] We speak of history just briefly
[1:23:34] for 2,000 years. whole nations who
[1:23:38] refused it. Though at one time perhaps
[1:23:40] mighty empires or dynasties and have
[1:23:43] been relegated in history today to
[1:23:46] second or third tier countries if they
[1:23:49] survived at all.
[1:23:52] On the other hand, nations who honored
[1:23:54] th that name of Jesus Jesus Christ,
[1:23:58] although they began small, rag tag,
[1:24:02] humble like America when when in her
[1:24:06] colonial days when her founding fathers
[1:24:08] stood for God and what was true
[1:24:12] or Israel when they became a nation in
[1:24:14] 1948 and they're just a humble little
[1:24:17] rag tag. I'm here to tell you, but when
[1:24:19] they honor that name of Jesus, what
[1:24:21] happened? They rose to world dominance.
[1:24:25] A little bunch of of patriots rose to
[1:24:29] world dominance.
[1:24:31] A little nation, a little sliver of
[1:24:33] land, completely surrounded by enemy,
[1:24:36] hostile to their even their existence
[1:24:39] and the sea at their back. And yet
[1:24:41] they're an unmovable force and strike
[1:24:44] terror. They strike terror in the hearts
[1:24:47] of those nations around them.
[1:24:51] One would think this nation could see
[1:24:53] that.
[1:24:56] I think about all the uses of that name
[1:24:59] around the world to defeat Satan's
[1:25:01] kingdom. I mean, we're talking about
[1:25:02] down through centuries, friends. We're
[1:25:04] talking about centuries of this
[1:25:06] Christian church that have defeated
[1:25:08] devils left and right at the name of
[1:25:11] Jesus.
[1:25:13] At that name, every knee shall bow,
[1:25:15] every tongue shall confess. That's the
[1:25:18] name we're trying to lift up high.
[1:25:19] Easter's not a holiday to us. Easter is
[1:25:22] a memorial. He rose from the grave and
[1:25:26] because he lives, now I can live.
[1:25:28] Brother Brandham said, you know, he rose
[1:25:30] from the grave and that's great for him,
[1:25:32] but what good does that do me? He rose.
[1:25:35] Okay, fine. But how does that help me?
[1:25:37] See, unless I can find a way to become a
[1:25:40] part of him. My goodness. Oh, I'm just
[1:25:44] trying to stay focused here today. I
[1:25:46] want to try to get finished.
[1:25:51] I think about all of the misuses of that
[1:25:53] name.
[1:25:54] Yeah.
[1:25:56] All of the uh
[1:26:00] misrepresentations
[1:26:03] of that name,
[1:26:06] especially in religious circles. What a
[1:26:08] misrepresentation. And I don't want to
[1:26:10] get going down that trail either. I
[1:26:13] think about the nonchalant way it is
[1:26:15] said these days, Jesus Christ.
[1:26:18] I think about all that it stood for in
[1:26:21] prophecy in the Old Testament
[1:26:24] and what it manifested here on earth
[1:26:27] wasn't done in a corner. When when God
[1:26:30] demonstrated his life, he didn't just do
[1:26:32] it in a corner. This thing has went
[1:26:33] around the world. when he demonstrated
[1:26:36] his presence in our midst in this day
[1:26:38] with a prophetic ministry. I'm here to
[1:26:40] tell you that wasn't done in some
[1:26:42] corner.
[1:26:43] That was done out in the open
[1:26:45] in the mainstream.
[1:26:48] See, and it was always unchallengeable.
[1:26:51] Sure, they can jump up now and run
[1:26:54] around trying to challenge something
[1:26:55] after the man's long gone. Not even here
[1:26:57] to He They never tried that when he was
[1:26:59] alive.
[1:27:00] They didn't live to tell about it if
[1:27:01] they did. That's right.
[1:27:04] Nobody who ever challenged a prophet.
[1:27:06] That never ended well in all the Bible.
[1:27:08] That never ended well. See,
[1:27:11] so he's already vindicated to us.
[1:27:13] There's no there's no question. We're
[1:27:14] not even interested in their questions.
[1:27:17] They wouldn't believe our answers
[1:27:19] anyway.
[1:27:20] See, but how that he identified himself
[1:27:24] in his church, which is us, which is the
[1:27:27] believers around the world. How he
[1:27:30] identified himself in his church. And
[1:27:32] how did he do it? How did he do it? By a
[1:27:35] divine revelation of his name,
[1:27:39] of the name of God,
[1:27:41] of the mighty God unveiled.
[1:27:45] He comes forth and says, "Now, now
[1:27:47] Christ is the mystery of God."
[1:27:51] Yeah.
[1:27:52] Revealed.
[1:27:55] And he goes on to show how that it's God
[1:27:58] in expression. So that by the time he
[1:28:00] comes to the end of that sermon and
[1:28:02] others like it, you're standing there
[1:28:04] going, "Wow, now the bride is the
[1:28:07] mystery of Christ revealed." See, so
[1:28:11] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:28:13] His family is the mystery of him
[1:28:15] revealed.
[1:28:17] And th this is the order that God has
[1:28:19] done it by a divine revelation of his
[1:28:20] name. After 2,000 years, after 2,000
[1:28:24] years of walking in the midst of seven
[1:28:27] golden candlesticks, to come down to
[1:28:31] this last day, Easter 2023
[1:28:35] and the name of Jesus is mostly a mere
[1:28:39] byword in the streets.
[1:28:44] To live, to see the day.
[1:28:48] You are the last generation that will
[1:28:51] ever be on the earth. You're the
[1:28:53] generation upon whom the ends of the
[1:28:55] earth have come.
[1:28:57] And to live to see the day that the
[1:28:59] modern church has just made him
[1:29:02] basically a hipster.
[1:29:04] He's even cool.
[1:29:06] He's hip.
[1:29:10] My
[1:29:12] a name so precious.
[1:29:15] Oh Lord, help me.
[1:29:18] A name
[1:29:20] so precious that it saved the entire
[1:29:25] world from sin
[1:29:28] only now to be a porative in the middle
[1:29:33] of some swearing tirade
[1:29:36] when someone is angry.
[1:29:39] A name, a name expressing a name that
[1:29:42] expressed all the love of God for
[1:29:46] humanity. And it's used mostly now to
[1:29:49] express anger or contempt.
[1:29:52] How did this happen?
[1:29:58] What does it mean to us? What is that
[1:29:59] name? What does Easter 2023 mean to you?
[1:30:04] I I never thought we would be here.
[1:30:07] There's no preacher alive thought we'd
[1:30:09] be here. Brother Brandham didn't think
[1:30:11] we'd be here.
[1:30:13] We are here and we're still fighting the
[1:30:16] greatest battle ever fought. And I just
[1:30:18] say, I'm going to fight on.
[1:30:20] And if he comes in the morning, then
[1:30:22] I'll be fighting when he comes. And if I
[1:30:25] lay more loved ones in the grave, I'll
[1:30:27] just pick up my sword and go back to
[1:30:29] fighting. Hallelujah. And if Brother
[1:30:31] Jason passes off the scene, you keep
[1:30:33] fighting. You keep swinging a sword cuz
[1:30:36] someday we're going to gather around
[1:30:38] Father's throne.
[1:30:40] Hallelujah.
[1:30:43] What does it mean to us in 2023? What
[1:30:47] should it mean to us?
[1:30:50] What does it mean to God? What do you
[1:30:51] think it means to God?
[1:30:54] I think it means everything to him.
[1:30:57] I think that name means everything to
[1:30:59] him. in fact is the only thing that God
[1:31:02] values above his name is his word.
[1:31:04] That's right.
[1:31:05] See Psalms 138 verse two, I will worship
[1:31:10] toward thy holy temple and praise thy
[1:31:15] name for thy loving kindness and for thy
[1:31:19] truth. Can you say amen?
[1:31:21] For thou has magnified thy word above
[1:31:24] all thy name.
[1:31:26] See, now don't get this. This doesn't
[1:31:29] mean that one's pitted against the
[1:31:31] other. It's not a conflict.
[1:31:33] You understand it? Just try to
[1:31:34] understand it like this. The name has
[1:31:36] changed down through time. God has used
[1:31:38] various names. He's had to have seven
[1:31:41] compound redemptive names just to
[1:31:42] describe what he's doing in the Old
[1:31:44] Testament and what Jesus would would
[1:31:46] would be. And then and then and then we
[1:31:48] find out that the name the name will
[1:31:50] actually change again in the new heavens
[1:31:52] and the new earth. He'll get a new name.
[1:31:54] See, but the word has never changed.
[1:31:57] Amen.
[1:31:58] The word never changes. From ages to
[1:32:01] ages, he's still the same.
[1:32:03] So his his his name, the only thing that
[1:32:06] that he can uh uh appreciate above his
[1:32:09] word is his name. I mean above his above
[1:32:11] his name is his word. See? And in his
[1:32:15] word, in the mystery of his word is his
[1:32:17] name is revealed.
[1:32:19] So so, so Jeremiah 15:16, look at these
[1:32:22] verses. I'm going to try to hurry. If
[1:32:23] you'll give me Can I get those 21
[1:32:25] minutes till the top of the hour?
[1:32:28] Amen. I hope we're keeping it
[1:32:29] interesting to you.
[1:32:32] This is Easter, so I should be able to
[1:32:33] get a little OT. Hey.
[1:32:36] Oh, what a beautiful Jeremiah. Thank
[1:32:39] you. I'm going to hug you in in glory.
[1:32:42] Thy words were found, and I did eat
[1:32:46] them. And thy word was unto me the joy
[1:32:50] and rejoicing of my heart. For I am
[1:32:53] called by thy name, oh Lord God of
[1:32:57] hosts. Oh, every morning, every evening,
[1:33:00] I crave it. Every morning, every
[1:33:02] evening, I eat upon it. It's the joy of
[1:33:05] my life. It's my everything. He is my
[1:33:07] everything.
[1:33:09] Hallelujah. Who who wants to lift his
[1:33:12] name up today?
[1:33:14] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:33:16] John 17:6,
[1:33:18] second favorite chapter in the gospels
[1:33:20] behind chapter 15 only. John 17:6, I
[1:33:24] have manifested thy name unto the men
[1:33:28] which thou gavest me out of the world.
[1:33:30] Thine they were, and thou gavest them
[1:33:33] me, and they have kept thy word. You see
[1:33:37] how those two things go together? He
[1:33:40] manifested his name, and they kept his
[1:33:43] word. Amen.
[1:33:45] So, this isn't a magic trick for you to
[1:33:49] win your lost family members. Just
[1:33:51] magnify his name in your life.
[1:33:53] It's not a magic trick. It's not hocus
[1:33:55] pocus. The Bible The Bible's not a book
[1:33:58] of incantations and spells. That's
[1:34:00] witchcraft. You put a crucifix around
[1:34:03] your neck, that's not on magic amulet.
[1:34:06] You understand? It's not none of that
[1:34:08] stuff. This isn't about This isn't like
[1:34:10] I said the other day, I don't I don't
[1:34:12] want to think that I got to wait till
[1:34:14] the dead in Christ rise and that's some
[1:34:16] kind of cosmic jump jumper cables to
[1:34:18] finally give me faith to change. I want
[1:34:20] to be walking toward my change every
[1:34:22] day, every hour. Hallelujah. I'm already
[1:34:25] feeling my change
[1:34:28] from glory to glory. It's changing me.
[1:34:35] What will
[1:34:37] be the result of it all in the end
[1:34:41] when we have the end of all things?
[1:34:45] The end of time itself
[1:34:48] at the end of the millennium
[1:34:50] when it's all said and done and and it's
[1:34:53] it's the end of of time. It's the end of
[1:34:56] the seventh seal. It's the end of the
[1:34:59] plan of redemption. The kingdom is
[1:35:02] surrendered and all the offices that God
[1:35:04] was going to work through are now
[1:35:06] fulfilled. And the Bible opens with
[1:35:08] chapter 21 of Revelation for the first
[1:35:10] time. Now God himself will dwell with
[1:35:16] his family. No more offices. Those
[1:35:18] offices were surrendered in 1
[1:35:20] Corinthians 15. This is God all in all,
[1:35:24] through you all, above you all, in you
[1:35:26] all. What a day. What a world
[1:35:29] where everything that's remaining will
[1:35:32] be God in manifestation and there won't
[1:35:34] be no sin and sickness and sorrow and
[1:35:37] even the devil will be gone and sinners
[1:35:39] gone. Hallelujah.
[1:35:42] Oh my. Makes this Easter worth it to me.
[1:35:50] Either
[1:35:52] you'll be there
[1:35:55] or you won't.
[1:36:01] What does this Easter mean to you
[1:36:06] today?
[1:36:08] Could I say to you in the immortal words
[1:36:10] of St. Paul today, while it is yet
[1:36:13] today, harden not your hearts
[1:36:18] as they did in the provocation
[1:36:20] who perished in the gains of Kora went
[1:36:23] after the error of Balum. You know what
[1:36:26] Balum was? You know what the error of
[1:36:27] Balum was? Mingling with the world.
[1:36:31] Calling this nonsense of so-called
[1:36:33] Christianity today something we can be
[1:36:36] kind of, you know, involved with. You
[1:36:38] cannot be involved with that. That's a
[1:36:39] feast of Bale Por. And God never even
[1:36:41] forgave them for that.
[1:36:43] Slaughtered them for that. They Israel
[1:36:45] was to be separate.
[1:36:47] Yeah. Your your your your your goal is
[1:36:49] to open their eyes to their plate. To
[1:36:53] say stay on that course. I get it.
[1:36:56] You're a good person, but stay on that
[1:36:59] course. You're going to head into a
[1:37:01] tribulation, and I won't be here to help
[1:37:02] you. I'm trying to help you now. I'm
[1:37:06] trying to show you the light, a better
[1:37:09] way. You might reject me. I have to take
[1:37:11] that chance.
[1:37:13] I can't sit on the throne in glory and
[1:37:16] see you come up to the to the throne and
[1:37:18] be judged and condemned for iniquity
[1:37:20] when I knew I had the opportunity to
[1:37:22] tell you.
[1:37:32] Make your calling and election sure.
[1:37:36] So in our text where we opened in
[1:37:38] chapter 5, we see this great gathering
[1:37:41] of agents that
[1:37:43] they all worked in tandem all
[1:37:46] harmoniously
[1:37:47] for John to stand there and see all of
[1:37:49] this scene. This was the culmination of
[1:37:51] work of thousands of years. this is what
[1:37:54] God had been doing and got it all the
[1:37:56] pieces put together and brings John up
[1:37:58] to show him now look at what we've
[1:38:00] accomplished. See, and so so we find
[1:38:04] that to bring John to this place
[1:38:07] literally was a culmination of a
[1:38:09] lifetime of growth and purpose. You
[1:38:11] know, Brother Brandham talks about
[1:38:13] angels that accompany you through life.
[1:38:16] And brother Brandham says it like this.
[1:38:17] There are angels that are assigned to
[1:38:20] you and they're with you through life.
[1:38:23] They go with you. And he said, "They
[1:38:24] don't go back home.
[1:38:26] They don't go back home. They stay with
[1:38:28] you and they accompany you through
[1:38:30] life." See, that's what God does for his
[1:38:33] children. See, now he may commit you to
[1:38:36] suffering as he did Job. He may commit
[1:38:38] you to death as he did Paul. That he
[1:38:40] said his love is proven in election that
[1:38:43] he elected you of no merit of your own.
[1:38:47] See, so if he never done another thing
[1:38:48] for me, he's already done more than I
[1:38:50] could ever repay.
[1:38:51] See?
[1:38:52] So, I don't worry about trials. I don't
[1:38:55] I don't get all, you know, I I can see
[1:38:57] Peter saying, you know, rejoice. These
[1:38:59] things, even the fiery ones are for your
[1:39:02] good. Listen, friends, can I help you
[1:39:05] with trials?
[1:39:12] I know sometimes things can just seem
[1:39:15] impossible
[1:39:17] and unbearable. Could I remind you?
[1:39:22] You're going to be alive for a long
[1:39:24] time.
[1:39:27] You've not even got off the front porch
[1:39:29] yet.
[1:39:32] I don't care how bad your trial is. It
[1:39:34] ain't going to matter in 40, 50,000
[1:39:36] years.
[1:39:38] It ain't going to matter.
[1:39:41] You're going to be alive for a long
[1:39:44] time. Centuries.
[1:39:47] centuries.
[1:39:49] Just tell the devil so and move on.
[1:39:53] What is What is this trial? I don't even
[1:39:55] care. Yeah, it's hard. Okay, fine. But
[1:39:57] it doesn't matter. I'm going to be alive
[1:39:59] for centuries. I'm just getting started.
[1:40:04] Hallelujah.
[1:40:06] That's what Easter means to me.
[1:40:10] Oh my. Where do I stop? I want to finish
[1:40:14] so bad. Let me just keep going. I got 13
[1:40:17] minutes. You promised me.
[1:40:21] Not to mention those who said preach on.
[1:40:23] I said well.
[1:40:27] Oh my. Let me see what I can skip. So So
[1:40:30] we find then to bring John
[1:40:33] to this to this culmination. It was a
[1:40:35] lifetime of growth and purpose. Angels
[1:40:38] had accompanied him hearing from his his
[1:40:41] theophony perhaps hearing one of the
[1:40:43] elders for sure. And you know the elder
[1:40:46] trying to get him to say amen to the
[1:40:48] word. Stop crying. Re you notice
[1:40:51] everybody around you is rejoicing. John,
[1:40:53] you notice all all the angels. All you
[1:40:56] got to do is accept it. Don't worry. You
[1:40:58] think you're going to make some noise.
[1:40:59] You wait till you see those 24 elders go
[1:41:01] off. You wait till you see these angels
[1:41:03] innumerable start shouting and singing.
[1:41:06] And John, when John caught the
[1:41:08] revelation, he says, "Ain't nobody going
[1:41:09] to outshout me. All the everybody in the
[1:41:12] earth and under the earth and everywhere
[1:41:13] in heaven heard me saying blessing and
[1:41:16] glory and honor and praise.
[1:41:19] Hallelujah.
[1:41:21] Oh my anointings of beast powers had
[1:41:25] operated down through the ages.
[1:41:29] The bride of Satan and the bride of
[1:41:31] Christ coming to a predestinated climax
[1:41:36] inexraably.
[1:41:39] Don't you think you can get out of it?
[1:41:41] Don't you think? I mean, this is
[1:41:42] inevitable. This can't be reversed. It's
[1:41:46] impossible to stop it. It's impossible
[1:41:48] to prevent it. It is inescapable. It is
[1:41:51] unstoppable. It is unavoidable. You
[1:41:54] can't not fight. Fight or die.
[1:41:58] Hallelujah. God's looking for warriors
[1:42:01] of the faith.
[1:42:03] None of us knew it would be this
[1:42:06] deceptively insane.
[1:42:08] sin being classed globally as normal.
[1:42:11] Are you kidding me? None of us knew, as
[1:42:13] I said earlier, none of us knew we'd be
[1:42:14] here this long. But I'm determined to
[1:42:17] press harder than ever before. The
[1:42:19] harder it gets, the more I press, the
[1:42:21] darker it gets, the more I turn on the
[1:42:23] light. Hallelujah. The more the more I'm
[1:42:26] worried about my loved ones, the more
[1:42:27] light I let in so I can let out.
[1:42:31] Hallelujah.
[1:42:32] You know, I I'm determined to press m
[1:42:35] You know, maybe you don't. And could I
[1:42:38] say to you today that I'm so sorry for
[1:42:41] you?
[1:42:42] If you don't, could I plead with you
[1:42:45] today and tell you that spring is here?
[1:42:51] It's Easter.
[1:42:53] He's coming soon.
[1:42:55] Could I plead with you today, He's
[1:42:57] coming soon.
[1:42:59] Oh, hallelujah. Make ready. Make ready.
[1:43:03] You know, I sit often and I imagine what
[1:43:05] my life will be over there. Do you ever
[1:43:06] do that?
[1:43:08] I do it all the time. You know, my
[1:43:11] teachers used to call it daydreaming.
[1:43:15] I didn't care. I was thinking about God.
[1:43:18] That's the truth. Thinking about God as
[1:43:21] a boy and sitting daydream.
[1:43:26] You know, I I have to confess that I
[1:43:28] don't if I could say it to you like
[1:43:30] this. It's not the splendor,
[1:43:33] uh, the beauty, the riches. Those are
[1:43:36] all foregone conclusions. I get that.
[1:43:40] The position in the royal family of God.
[1:43:44] I mean, how awesome is that?
[1:43:48] Bride to the lamb, king, uh, queen to
[1:43:51] the king.
[1:43:53] Say, you don't you don't ponder those
[1:43:54] chiefly. I think about them. I'm glad
[1:43:56] for them. But I far more often ponder
[1:44:00] the enraptturing feeling to me of just
[1:44:04] sitting in the middle in the middle of
[1:44:07] that big world, that big new world
[1:44:11] somewhere deep in the heart of nature,
[1:44:14] just drinking it into my soul.
[1:44:19] All troubles are gone forever.
[1:44:23] I don't ever have to come back here and
[1:44:25] do this again.
[1:44:26] I'm free.
[1:44:29] Soaking in the cleanness,
[1:44:32] the unending shity of it all. The peace,
[1:44:36] the tranquility, the end of struggling
[1:44:38] nature, and me a beneficiary of that
[1:44:43] ending.
[1:44:45] To be able to worship God and
[1:44:48] talk things over with him. You ever just
[1:44:50] think about that? Some of these days
[1:44:53] when time is gone and there's no there's
[1:44:56] no pressure on my schedule, I can just
[1:44:59] say, "Jesus,
[1:45:01] could we just walk out into the
[1:45:02] wilderness and let me just talk to you
[1:45:03] for a couple years? I just want to tell
[1:45:06] you everything I wanted to tell you when
[1:45:07] I was in the earth and I prayed, but I I
[1:45:10] just want to hear you. I just want to
[1:45:11] say it in your presence again. I'd like
[1:45:13] to re repeat. Could you bring to my
[1:45:15] memory every prayer I ever prayed, every
[1:45:17] worship I ever did, and let me just
[1:45:19] rehearse it to you right here and right
[1:45:20] now?
[1:45:21] Oh, you say that's that's nonsense. The
[1:45:23] the the unhurriededness of it all.
[1:45:27] Unhurried by life, unhurried by
[1:45:30] vexations.
[1:45:33] To be completely unhurried, to be
[1:45:35] completely unharried. Similar words.
[1:45:40] To be completely unhared
[1:45:45] of all stress, all anxiety, all cares.
[1:45:48] Completely unharnessed.
[1:45:53] living in a world that is unblenmished,
[1:45:56] untainted, unpolluted, and my life
[1:45:59] uncontaminated.
[1:46:02] Friends, now here's the real heart of my
[1:46:05] message with my last seven or eight
[1:46:06] minutes.
[1:46:08] My life there finally at last
[1:46:13] uncontaminated.
[1:46:16] Say by what? By anything.
[1:46:20] I think about a message of grace that
[1:46:22] came to me in this day that made all
[1:46:25] this clear to show me my way home. You
[1:46:29] know, uh you don't have to put it up,
[1:46:30] Brother Brad. I'm just going to read it
[1:46:31] quickly. Psalms 23:2, "He maketh me to
[1:46:34] lie down in green pastures." You know, I
[1:46:36] love Brother Richie when he came here.
[1:46:37] He said, "This message of grace are my
[1:46:39] green pastures." I just said, "Amen."
[1:46:42] Amen. Amen. Listen, friends, we haven't
[1:46:44] always, you know, we we've we're like
[1:46:46] David.
[1:46:48] We've got successes.
[1:46:50] I mean, here's the beauty of it. David
[1:46:53] fought with lions and he fought with
[1:46:56] bears.
[1:46:58] And you know the beauty of that? He came
[1:47:00] away unscathed, unharmed, uninjured.
[1:47:03] He fought Goliath of Gath and
[1:47:05] slaughtered him.
[1:47:06] And David have a mark on him.
[1:47:08] Goliath never got a shot off. Goliath
[1:47:11] never made the first move. He he didn't
[1:47:13] even raise a spear. David ran toward him
[1:47:16] and killed him.
[1:47:18] See, and oh, I I I I just tell you in my
[1:47:22] heart today, I just say I believe we've
[1:47:24] we've reached a time where it's time to
[1:47:26] look for five smooth stones.
[1:47:28] Hallelujah. I want to say, Lord, give me
[1:47:30] my five smooth stones. I got some wool,
[1:47:33] some bears and lions and and giants that
[1:47:35] I want to slay in my life.
[1:47:40] Now, he didn't slay all of his Goliaths.
[1:47:43] Bathsheba was a Goliath he didn't slay.
[1:47:48] Uriah was a worse Goliath he didn't
[1:47:50] slay. Numbering the people was worse
[1:47:52] still.
[1:47:54] Tens of thousands of people died because
[1:47:56] he did that.
[1:48:00] But you know something?
[1:48:02] None of that removed David from his
[1:48:06] position in Christ. And I've slayed some
[1:48:10] Goliaths and I've killed some lions and
[1:48:13] I've killed some bears and I got away
[1:48:15] scot-free. And there were some Goliaths
[1:48:17] I didn't do so well on. And some stories
[1:48:20] I'd rather not tell you and disclose
[1:48:21] today. And you got some of those same
[1:48:23] stories, too. But I'm here to tell you
[1:48:25] on that side, I will be uncontaminated
[1:48:27] by any of it. I'll be unpolluted. I'll
[1:48:31] be unmoved. I'll be unchanged. I'll be
[1:48:34] everything he envisioned me being before
[1:48:37] the foundation of the world. And none of
[1:48:41] this life and my failures combined, it
[1:48:43] won't matter.
[1:48:45] [Music]
[1:48:46] Hallelujah.
[1:48:47] And all the annals of heaven today, that
[1:48:50] same David is unimpaired by those
[1:48:53] failures. That's what I'm resting in for
[1:48:55] me. That's the great thing that I think
[1:48:58] about. Say, what is your biggest thought
[1:49:00] of heaven? Sitting there clean. Amen.
[1:49:04] My original life from the mind of God on
[1:49:07] display.
[1:49:10] I'll be unaltered.
[1:49:12] Isn't that glorious?
[1:49:14] I want to read you this last quote here.
[1:49:17] Brother Brandham says,
[1:49:21] he says, you know, and from the rejected
[1:49:23] king, and he's telling the story about
[1:49:26] going beyond the curtain of time. And
[1:49:27] I'm not going to tell you the whole
[1:49:28] story. You know it well. You can go get
[1:49:29] the tape. It's really a good version of
[1:49:31] it.
[1:49:33] But he I just want to write write these
[1:49:35] two lines here as it's starting to
[1:49:37] happen to him and he's laying in the bed
[1:49:40] and and he's had a night of probably
[1:49:44] fitful sleep knowing him and his wife is
[1:49:47] laying next to to him beside him and
[1:49:49] he's in the bed. This is real life.
[1:49:52] Aren't you glad we had a prophet who
[1:49:54] lived real life? Amen.
[1:49:55] And he he sat up in the bed and he said,
[1:49:59] "I put my arms behind my head and just
[1:50:01] kind of set up on the pillow like anyone
[1:50:02] would do." And he said, "I thought, hm,
[1:50:05] Bill Brandham, 50 years old, if you're
[1:50:09] ever going to do anything for the Lord,
[1:50:11] you better get moving." Here's a man who
[1:50:13] done been around the world multiple
[1:50:14] times, had led millions to Christ, had
[1:50:18] been the spearhead of all of those tent
[1:50:19] revivals. He's he's widely credited as
[1:50:22] being the spearhead of it all.
[1:50:25] other great ministries came out from his
[1:50:26] ministry.
[1:50:29] Bill Brandham, if you're ever going to
[1:50:31] do anything, you better get moving.
[1:50:35] He says, "Now," he says, "It's like I I
[1:50:39] heard someone singing." He said, "That
[1:50:42] old song." And he's he's asking about a
[1:50:44] brother so and so used to sing that
[1:50:46] song, Beyond the Curtain of Time. And he
[1:50:49] said, "Like I I could hear it singing."
[1:50:52] And he said now, he said something
[1:50:55] started talking to me and said, "Oh,
[1:51:00] you're just starting. Press the battle.
[1:51:04] Press the battle." Now, he's already
[1:51:07] been around the world. He's 50 years
[1:51:08] old, been serving God for decades. And
[1:51:11] he says, "And I don't want you to miss
[1:51:12] this, and I don't want you to miss it
[1:51:14] today." He said, "It has changed me. I
[1:51:18] can't be the same, brother Brandham,
[1:51:20] that I was. And I looked and I heard
[1:51:24] something keep saying, "You're just
[1:51:26] starting." That's why I said to you a
[1:51:29] while ago, you're going to be alive for
[1:51:31] a long time. You're just starting. Press
[1:51:35] the battle. Keep pressing.
[1:51:40] Oh my. People worry about so many
[1:51:42] things. I'm here to tell you all that
[1:51:44] matters is I'm pressing the battle. This
[1:51:47] Easter means more to me in 2023 than it
[1:51:50] did in 2022. Hallelujah. I I I I don't
[1:51:53] ever want to see another one. But if I
[1:51:55] if I do, I'll still be pressing.
[1:51:58] I'll be pressing harder then than I am
[1:52:01] today. Say, I don't think that's
[1:52:03] possible. You just wait till you get
[1:52:04] there. And this world is one more year
[1:52:07] evil and dark and black. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:52:09] Friends, you're going to find a courage.
[1:52:11] You're going to find something down
[1:52:13] inside of you. a dynamics anointing the
[1:52:16] mechanics and this bride will rise in
[1:52:19] glory and brother Brandham said it'll
[1:52:21] call the sleeping saints for hundreds of
[1:52:24] years thousands of years it'll call them
[1:52:26] from the grave
[1:52:29] I'm looking for it any day
[1:52:31] how about you friends are you willing to
[1:52:34] lift him up in history today let's stand
[1:52:38] oh I stopped I think got 20 seconds
[1:52:42] oh praise the name of the Lord.
[1:52:46] Hallelujah. Sister Ruth, did you happen
[1:52:49] to hear that? Okay, that's all you need.
[1:52:51] If you can hear it, I think I think I
[1:52:54] can sing it. I think most of the some of
[1:52:55] us know it. Brother Eugene
[1:52:58] taught it to us years ago. He has
[1:53:00] forgiven me.
[1:53:02] My sins have been washed from his memory
[1:53:06] by the blood of the lamb of Calary.
[1:53:12] He has forgiven
[1:53:16] me. Oh, he
[1:53:21] has forgiven
[1:53:24] me.
[1:53:26] My sins have been washed from his memory
[1:53:33] by the blood of the lamb of Calary.
[1:53:41] Oh, he
[1:53:44] has
[1:53:45] forgive.
[1:53:47] I think you got it now. Oh, he
[1:53:51] has. Sing it. Forgive
[1:53:55] me.
[1:53:57] My sins have been washed from his
[1:54:01] memory.
[1:54:04] Oh, by the blood of the lamb
[1:54:09] of Calary. Glory.
[1:54:12] Oh, he
[1:54:15] has. Oh, I think you got it now. I think
[1:54:18] you got it. Let's sing it. Oh, he
[1:54:22] has

[1:54:34] Oh, by the blood of the lamb of Calary.
[1:54:42] Oh, he
[1:54:45] has.
[1:54:47] Again, let's really get it good now. Oh,
[1:54:51] he
[1:54:52] has. Come on, raise up those hands.
[1:54:55] Worship with me now. Oh, my sins have
[1:55:00] been washed. Yes, Lord. Oh hallelujah.
[1:55:05] Oh by the blood of the lamb of calary.
[1:55:12] Oh he
[1:55:15] has
[1:55:17] forgive again.
[1:55:20] Oh he
[1:55:22] has
[1:55:24] forgiven
[1:55:26] me.
[1:55:28] My sins have been washed from his
[1:55:32] memory.
[1:55:34] Oh, by the blood of the lamb.
[1:55:39] Oh, my that precious blood.
[1:55:43] Oh, ye
[1:55:44] have
[1:55:46] forgiven.
[1:55:48] Just keep playing that for me, sister.
[1:55:50] Bow your heads with me, friends around
[1:55:52] the church today.
[1:55:55] Oh Lord God, you've forgiven us of so
[1:55:57] much. You've set us on high. Lord, we
[1:56:01] want to lift you up high today. It's
[1:56:04] been a grand day, Lord. I I was so
[1:56:06] enjoying, Lord, the confirmations to my
[1:56:08] heart as I heard brother Jason in his
[1:56:11] class today. So many points I thought,
[1:56:13] wow, what a foundation to launch from.
[1:56:16] Lord, it thrills our hearts to know what
[1:56:18] you've done in this hour, and we want to
[1:56:20] be a part of it. Lord, I want to be a
[1:56:22] part of it. I want to lift you up out of
[1:56:25] history. I want to lift you up to the
[1:56:26] world this one last time.
[1:56:30] Time will go on, Lord. The bride will be
[1:56:32] taken home. The dead in Christ will rise
[1:56:36] for hundreds of years. She'll stand
[1:56:38] among us. We which are alive and remain
[1:56:40] will be changed in a moment in the
[1:56:41] twinkling of an eye.
[1:56:44] We'll be c we'll be caught up together.
[1:56:46] We'll have a little time of fellowship.
[1:56:49] Prophet said a month or so. They were 40
[1:56:52] days, Lord, after you raised from the
[1:56:54] grave. And we often look at that time, a
[1:56:57] month or so, 30, 40 days, somewhere in
[1:56:59] that area where Lord, we're going to
[1:57:02] we're going to embrace one another all
[1:57:04] down through the ages. Wow, what a what
[1:57:06] a reuniting. What a time, oh God. Oh,
[1:57:11] today, Father, we can come together and
[1:57:13] we we enjoy one another's fellowship.
[1:57:15] just this little mly crew here today
[1:57:19] around the world. Just little assemblies
[1:57:21] everywhere. But but we're one voice of
[1:57:23] the lamb of God, the bride, the queen of
[1:57:26] Christ. Oh master, help us today.
[1:57:30] Help us today, Lord God, to realize our
[1:57:33] calling and our position. Let us make it
[1:57:35] sure, Lord. Don't let it be. Don't let
[1:57:38] it be that some would miss it. Don't let
[1:57:42] that be. Father, I commit this service
[1:57:45] into your hands today. The the regular
[1:57:47] assembly here, visitors among us, those
[1:57:50] streaming, those who are away who'll get
[1:57:52] it later perhaps on an archive. Lord,
[1:57:55] let it become a living reality to us.
[1:57:58] Oh, I've so enjoyed, Lord, these last
[1:58:02] couple of days thinking about this,
[1:58:04] actually a week almost probably three or
[1:58:06] four days pondering this thought, adding
[1:58:09] a little here, a little there.
[1:58:12] Oh, master, how good it was to study it.
[1:58:14] How good it felt, Lord, to have you come
[1:58:17] and just say, say this here and say that
[1:58:20] there, and put this right here, and
[1:58:21] bring that down right here, and bring up
[1:58:23] this scripture and pull in this quote,
[1:58:25] and say it like this. No, God, I stand
[1:58:28] here today, my heart full of rejoicing,
[1:58:31] full of rejoicing because I I sense that
[1:58:34] the people have believed your word,
[1:58:36] Lord, I sense a great spirit of welcome
[1:58:39] to your word today. Now I commit it into
[1:58:42] your hands, Father, in Jesus name. He
[1:58:46] has forgiven
[1:58:50] me.
