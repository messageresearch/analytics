[5:26] &gt;&gt; Star is called
[5:29] standing
[5:30] have a word of prayer this morning.
[5:34] Father, Lord, we come before you,
[5:38] Lord, with
[5:39] our hearts open, Lord, that we could
[5:43] come together for this small this little
[5:45] Sunday school, Lord, that have a few
[5:47] thoughts, few notes put together, Lord.
[5:49] But if you could have something for the
[5:52] people through me, maybe encourage some
[5:55] people, encourage people here and
[5:58] online, whoever would be listening, they
[6:01] might be able to take something from it,
[6:03] draw strength from it to know where they
[6:05] stand and be able to move forward in
[6:09] your word. We ask these things in the
[6:10] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[6:13] All right. Um, I want to read this
[6:16] morning,
[6:17] um, Ephesians chapter 6. And I'm
[6:20] continuing my thought. I I started, I
[6:22] guess last time I did Sunday school. Um,
[6:25] I think I titled the last one, um, the
[6:28] road to conquest. And I wanted to, as a
[6:30] subtitle today, I wanted to take the t
[6:31] the topic of
[6:34] um, so we want to read Ephesians chapter
[6:38] 6 and we'll start at verse 10.
[6:43] And it says um Ephesians chapter 6:10.
[6:45] It says, "Finally, my brethren, be
[6:46] strong in the Lord, the power of his
[6:48] might. Put on the whole armor of God
[6:50] that you may be able to stand against
[6:51] the ws of the devil, not against flesh
[6:54] and blood, but against principalities,
[6:55] against powers, against the rulers of
[6:56] the darkness of this world, against
[6:58] spiritual wickedness in high places."
[7:00] Now, I want to again just sort of update
[7:02] your my point from last time, which is
[7:05] where it says, "For we wrestle not
[7:06] against flesh and blood, but against
[7:07] principalities, against powers, and
[7:08] against rulers of the darkness of this
[7:10] world." That is not
[7:13] saying we wrestle not period right it is
[7:16] an act he's Paul is indicating that we
[7:17] are actually actually legitimately in a
[7:20] real very real conflict it's a very real
[7:22] war it is in fact the most real war
[7:24] right like you know we think it's not an
[7:26] analogy to war if anything the physical
[7:29] wars and conflicts that we see around
[7:30] the world are an analogy to what's going
[7:33] right they are they that is the the
[7:35] natural reflection of what's truly going
[7:37] on in the spiritual world
[7:40] and so therefore We need to take this
[7:42] very seriously. We need to take it and
[7:44] sort of approach it and and much of
[7:46] what's going to apply to to real war and
[7:48] and real physical, you know, or to
[7:50] physical war and physical conflict is
[7:52] going anything else more so to your
[7:55] spiritual life and the way you approach
[7:57] your spiritual um spiritual battles. But
[8:00] u moving on, it says in verse 13,
[8:03] "Wherefore take on you the whole armor
[8:04] of God that you may be able to withstand
[8:06] in the evil day, having done all to
[8:09] stand. Stand therefore, having your
[8:11] lord's girth, and having on the
[8:14] breastplate of righteousness, and your
[8:16] feet shaw with the preparation of the
[8:17] gospel of peace, above all, taking the
[8:19] shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be
[8:21] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[8:23] the wicked, and take the helmet of
[8:25] salvation, and the sword of the spirit,
[8:27] which is the word of God. Y'all can be
[8:29] seated. Um, so I want to take
[8:34] um see if this is on. Can y'all can you
[8:37] put my PowerPoint up, Ca? Brother Caleb,
[8:39] I'd appreciate that. Um, I want to take
[8:41] a moment and kind of focus in on verse
[8:43] 16 here where it says, "Above all,
[8:44] taking the shield of faith, wherewith
[8:46] you shall be able to quench all the
[8:47] fiery darts of the wicked." So, um, I
[8:50] have a picture up here. This is a a
[8:52] modern
[8:53] recreation of a Roman legionary, which
[8:56] would have been the sort of most common
[9:00] infantry soldier of the day in which
[9:02] this verse was written. Um, and I want
[9:05] you to notice that shield that he's got
[9:07] holding up. That is I think the the more
[9:10] the technical term for that type of
[9:11] shield is called a
[9:13] it's a big bulky sort of square
[9:16] silhouette shield. Um, and he can hide
[9:19] his entire body behind that thing
[9:21] &gt;&gt; just about. Right. And
[9:25] that shield is like the lynch pin for
[9:29] the entire Roman military. The Roman
[9:31] military.
[9:33] the the known world like everything that
[9:35] they ever set out to conquer they
[9:36] conquered pretty much. Um and that
[9:39] shield is basically the one of the key
[9:42] fundamental principles of it. Um because
[9:48] uh if this is going to work. It might
[9:50] not. Let me see if it
[9:53] Oh, it the clicker is dead. Um if you
[9:55] could advance that slide for me,
[9:56] brother. That is how the Romans deploy
[10:00] that shield. Okay. You don't just march
[10:02] out there with one guy and try to and
[10:06] you know you can do okay. But when you
[10:08] get a group of guys and they're all got
[10:10] their shields linked up like that
[10:13] of what's called the test formation.
[10:14] It's the Latin word for turtle,
[10:17] &gt;&gt; right? You get everybody linked up like
[10:19] that. You're not breaking through that,
[10:22] right? That is impenetrable. You can
[10:23] take fortresses that way because you can
[10:25] shoot arrows at them, but you're not
[10:26] going to hit anybody, right? they that
[10:30] the and what that requires in order to
[10:33] it requires a level of training, a level
[10:36] of discipline, but above all it requires
[10:38] a level of unity amongst your troops,
[10:41] right? Everybody in there has got to
[10:44] treat the guy next to them like their
[10:46] life depends on it because if it because
[10:48] it really does. Anybody goes down in
[10:50] that formation and now you have a giant
[10:52] gaping in your group that who knows
[10:55] what's going to come in there, right?
[10:56] you're going to everyone suffers when
[10:58] one person goes down.
[11:00] And so in order to do this, you have to
[11:02] have a spirit of unity and and of
[11:04] uniting amongst your people. And that
[11:07] truly actually if you study Roman
[11:09] culture and and their history, the
[11:14] recognition that each individual
[11:17] is weak on their own, but united they
[11:20] are strong. that philosophy ran up and
[11:24] down crossways up, you know, forward and
[11:27] backwards through Roman society.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; Everything in in, you know, as a Roman,
[11:33] you're you know, the the nation of Rome
[11:36] came first because because the group
[11:38] came first. You pri you you
[11:40] deprioritized yourself and your own
[11:42] individual because as long as you take
[11:44] care of the group, the group will take
[11:45] care of you, right? Rome came first. And
[11:48] so, you know, this is this is the whole
[11:51] the whole culture,
[11:53] uh, brother Kevin now. Um, could my the
[11:56] clicker There we go. So, this is sort of
[11:59] a drawing of a Roman magistrate. Um, I
[12:02] guess technically it' be a magistrate's
[12:03] guard, but um, either way, it but the
[12:06] indication that what I want to point you
[12:07] to is the thing he's holding, right?
[12:10] That is the Latin word for that is
[12:11] fascis.
[12:13] That is a it's obviously an axe, but
[12:16] it's got it's around the axe handle.
[12:19] You've got sticks that are all bound
[12:20] around it tightly because the the notion
[12:23] here and this was this the fascis was
[12:26] for the Roman magistrates. It was the
[12:28] symbol of the Roman magistrate's power.
[12:31] It was the symbol of his authority
[12:33] was the the symbolism here is that the
[12:36] each individual stick is easily broken.
[12:40] But when you bind it all together, no
[12:42] one can break that, right? I mean, even
[12:44] in the in the in the Bible, right? A
[12:46] three-fold cord is not easily broken.
[12:48] And when there's unity and so the the
[12:50] magistrate's power did not come from
[12:53] individual ability to do anything, but
[12:55] what it was speaking to is he was one
[12:57] individual in a whole system of Roman
[13:00] authority that yeah, you could oppose
[13:02] him, but you're not just opposing him.
[13:04] You're opposing the whole organization
[13:06] of the Roman Empire. And so this is
[13:10] where you know that
[13:13] is the core that's how Rome conquered
[13:15] the world
[13:17] &gt;&gt; right they I mean they just they they
[13:19] they were unstoppable because everybody
[13:22] was working in unison they had a a unity
[13:24] amongst um their society
[13:29] and when you have unity because you know
[13:31] unity
[13:33] no military is going to function
[13:35] &gt;&gt; right unity you have to have solidarity
[13:37] You have to have unity. Everybody has to
[13:38] be working in cooperation. The worst
[13:42] thing, like the most fatal thing to a
[13:44] military is infighting and dissension
[13:47] and disunityity, right? You break
[13:49] people's cooperation and they're done as
[13:53] it's over, right? Because now you're not
[13:55] fighting an army. You're fighting a
[13:57] group of individuals and each one can be
[13:59] picked off and nobody and and they don't
[14:01] care because you know who cares? He's
[14:03] just some other guy that I happen to be
[14:05] sharing a uniform with. But when you but
[14:08] when when that's your battle buddy and
[14:09] he goes down and now your life depends
[14:11] on it. Well,
[14:13] it's a whole different um uh mentality
[14:16] that you don't leave people behind. And
[14:17] and you know that's it's
[14:20] you know the every individual in the
[14:22] Roman military was seen as valuable.
[14:24] They weren't just uh that's that's why
[14:27] Caesar was able to take over as as the
[14:29] dictator because he treated his his
[14:31] soldiers like and they in turn treated
[14:34] Caesar like he was God.
[14:37] So
[14:38] you know this is you know this the idea
[14:41] of of unity and and and um never of of
[14:47] casting aside anything that would
[14:49] separate you from your from your group.
[14:53] That's how Rome conquered the world.
[14:56] [snorts]
[14:57] Um, and they didn't just conquer it in,
[15:02] you know, the classical era. They didn't
[15:04] conquer it thousands of years ago. If we
[15:06] could advance one more,
[15:09] that is the mace,
[15:13] US House of Representatives.
[15:15] I don't know if you can see that. It's
[15:16] kind of a small picture, but that is a
[15:18] fascis.
[15:19] It's not not like, you know,
[15:21] metaphorically. It is literally a
[15:23] fascis, you know, explicitly. The only
[15:25] difference is instead of an axe head
[15:26] sticking out of the top is a eagle with
[15:29] a globe,
[15:30] &gt;&gt; right? And so the and and if we could
[15:34] advance once more and there's probably
[15:37] the end of my slideshow. Oh, there we
[15:39] go. That's Abraham Lincoln. Now, you
[15:41] can't really see maybe you can in this
[15:43] picture, but under on his throne, under
[15:45] his hands are two fascis.
[15:49] They're you can't really see it. They're
[15:53] right here and right here if you you
[15:57] know you can find that picture and I'
[15:59] I've been to the Lincoln Memorial and
[16:01] you can see it really good there and
[16:03] that's what it is it's and you know
[16:04] Lincoln's whole presidency was the
[16:07] uniting of America right you had Civil
[16:09] War broke America and it was after
[16:13] stopped saying the United States are and
[16:15] started saying the United States is
[16:17] right it was before before the Civil War
[16:20] it was the United states are doing this,
[16:22] right? you say are you know a group of
[16:23] people are doing something but a group
[16:26] of people is that doesn't make any
[16:28] that's not grammarical but when you the
[16:31] the point there is after Lincoln
[16:35] is when the United States truly became
[16:37] bound together right Lincoln's famous
[16:38] for he's quoting scripture but he said a
[16:40] house divided cannot stand what happened
[16:43] under Lincoln the the American
[16:45] interpretation of the Supreme Court or
[16:47] of the US Constitution radically shifted
[16:49] after Lincoln because it completely
[16:53] see the Constitution and where the the
[16:56] sovereignty lies, right? It's not with
[16:58] the states, it's with the federal
[16:59] government and as one bound singular
[17:01] individual organization, not 50 separate
[17:05] organizations that happen to share a
[17:08] proximity, right? It's not the United
[17:10] States are we don't do that anymore. Is
[17:15] it's on your money. If anybody has a
[17:17] dollar in your pocket or a nickel in
[17:19] your pocket, pull it out. What does it
[17:21] say on there? E plubers unum right of
[17:24] one or one of many, right? One out of
[17:27] many. So here, you know, this the the
[17:30] Roman mentality of un die with a Roman
[17:34] Empire,
[17:36] &gt;&gt; right? The spirit of Rome has just kept
[17:39] on progressing, right? Every I think I'm
[17:42] done with the PowerPoint. Um
[17:46] uh thank you. Um all that it never quit.
[17:49] It never went away. It didn't stop.
[17:54] It's even to this day. It's just
[17:57] continued to progress. And now
[18:01] in the last day, we know that this that
[18:03] the spirit of the antichrist, the way
[18:06] would come to power was be as a great
[18:07] unifying force. Right?
[18:10] Now what's interesting
[18:13] is
[18:15] if you you know you study you study
[18:17] politics um
[18:21] uh you know you look at the political
[18:23] situation now one of the number one
[18:25] things that everybody seems to say
[18:26] whether they're left right independent
[18:28] whatever everybody says well the big
[18:30] problem facing America is the
[18:31] disunityity right everybody everybody's
[18:33] nobody can agree on anything
[18:37] so what's happening here is you have a
[18:39] spirit of disunityity amongst the
[18:41] people, right? People are are very um
[18:44] broken and scattered. And what that does
[18:47] is it starves people, right? If you want
[18:50] to if you want to feed someone poison
[18:53] hungry first and then they're not going
[18:55] to ask two questions about what you just
[18:56] fed them, right? If you break people up
[19:00] and you drive a wedge, drive wedge after
[19:02] wedge after wedge between the people,
[19:05] the minute somebody comes along with a
[19:07] unifying message, nobody's going to ask
[19:10] where the axe head is sticking out,
[19:13] right? All they want is to be unified.
[19:16] All they because everybody knows as long
[19:17] as everyone's got wedges between us,
[19:19] we're going to get broken. And so the
[19:21] same thing, so that's the antichrist
[19:23] spirit is to be a unifier. Um this is
[19:26] from
[19:28] um 1954 the mark of the beast. Uh this
[19:32] unites a time that church and state will
[19:35] unite together and Protestant and
[19:36] Catholic will throw their things
[19:37] together to fight communism. And it's
[19:40] exactly playing in the hands of what God
[19:42] said right here. And you Protestants
[19:45] laying yonder, sound asleep, reading a
[19:46] love story magazine instead of your
[19:48] Bible, out gatting around somewhere to
[19:51] some kind of a part in prayer meeting
[19:54] somewhere or fussing at one another
[19:56] about little old petty things that don't
[19:58] matter that much. You ought to be on
[20:00] your knees somewhere if you know what
[20:03] eternity meant.
[20:05] And so here's
[20:08] I and I guess I want to, you know, make
[20:10] a a point here. If this is world right
[20:14] the whole world is driving towards this
[20:16] great unifying right then doesn't that
[20:20] sort of you know doesn't that tell us
[20:22] that if the if Satan's plan for the
[20:24] world is always so close to the real
[20:28] thing that it would deceive the very
[20:30] elect if it were possible if that's the
[20:33] also imply that the the plan of God is
[20:35] also to unify his people right you know
[20:39] when Paul's saying take up the shield of
[20:41] faith
[20:42] What he's saying, he's not just saying
[20:43] you as an individual take up your shield
[20:45] of faith. What he's saying is employ the
[20:47] tactics of the Roman legion as a
[20:49] spiritual tactic. Don't just go
[20:54] face it with your brothers and sisters
[20:55] with your shields locked.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Don't just go make sure you have a
[20:59] united church, a church family that
[21:02] you're fighting with or or not fighting
[21:05] against, but um on the same side as,
[21:08] right? be be a united fighting force
[21:11] because if you don't, you're going to
[21:12] get you're going to get isolated and and
[21:15] and and
[21:26] God in your church, gossip about your
[21:29] brother,
[21:30] &gt;&gt; say something negative about your
[21:32] sister,
[21:33] &gt;&gt; you know, if you want to if you want to
[21:35] look look in the at the Tower of Babel
[21:39] I think it's Genesis chapter 13.
[21:42] They were they were had one unified all
[21:45] operating with a united people and God
[21:47] said he couldn't withhold what they
[21:49] wanted when they were united. That's
[21:52] sinful fallen people and God couldn't
[21:56] stop them until he broke their unity.
[21:59] Okay. If that's the case, how much more
[22:02] so when when God's
[22:05] people come together with the same level
[22:06] of unity, that's why you get them at the
[22:08] day of on the day of Pentecost in one
[22:10] mind and one accord, you get this
[22:11] spectacular move of the spirit. And the
[22:14] key there is the unity of the people,
[22:16] right? If you want to if you want to if
[22:19] you want to absolutely kill the move of
[22:22] the spirit in your church, [crying]
[22:25] start bickering about people.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; Start getting an attitude about your
[22:28] brother or your sister. Start finding
[22:30] fault with everything in the everyone in
[22:32] the church,
[22:33] &gt;&gt; right? start start you know really
[22:36] focusing in on the you know the faults
[22:38] and failures of the people that you
[22:40] share a pew with
[22:41] &gt;&gt; you do that and you will absolutely
[22:44] of the spirit in your church
[22:46] &gt;&gt; it will be you you you won't I mean look
[22:49] when there's
[22:51] when there's that level a certain level
[22:54] of of um distrust amongst the people
[22:57] around you that you share a church with
[22:59] when you're not going out of your way to
[23:01] build those connections to build a heart
[23:03] connection with the if you're not doing
[23:05] that and you can't and there's there's
[23:08] no heart um you know there's no u
[23:12] there's no love in the church right and
[23:14] it's not you know there's there's a
[23:15] certain kind of love where like yes yes
[23:17] you know we we share a church and I love
[23:19] them very much but I certainly wouldn't
[23:20] do anything for them you know I
[23:22] certainly wouldn't go out of my way to
[23:23] help
[23:25] you know it's just
[23:28] you know there there's got to be some
[23:30] you got to put some wheels on your on
[23:32] your love, you got to put some wheels on
[23:34] on to that. You got to go make it active
[23:38] for it to mean anything.
[23:40] But when you do that and now everyone's
[23:42] got, you know, in one, that's when the
[23:45] spirit can operate. If you don't, if you
[23:48] just if it's you pay lip service to
[23:51] unity, you pay lip service to to your
[23:54] brothers and sisters and and and
[23:57] um you know, the needs in the church,
[24:00] then you know, you share a but you don't
[24:05] really share a common cause, right?
[24:08] You're not you're not really you're all
[24:10] just kind of standing around looking in
[24:12] the same direction. You're not really
[24:14] united. You're not you're not your
[24:16] shield of faith isn't covering your
[24:17] brother. You know, when you if your
[24:20] shield of faith is covering your
[24:21] brother, that means that when he has a
[24:22] failure, you stand in the cover that
[24:25] &gt;&gt; you know, help my brother.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; You don't, oh Lord, let me kick him out
[24:30] of the group. He's a liability.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; No, you don't do that.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; You lift him up when he goes down. You
[24:36] grab him and pick him back up because as
[24:38] much as he needs you, you need him.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; When your brother falls, you don't kick
[24:43] him to the curb.
[24:44] so he can stand and and defend you when
[24:46] you fall.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Right? No one's going to be perfect. I'm
[24:50] not going to be perfect. You're not
[24:51] going to be perfect. We're all going to
[24:52] make a cataclysmic mistakes. We're all
[24:55] going to be lying flat on our back at
[24:57] some point and desperately need the
[24:59] grace of God in our life at some point.
[25:02] And it's going to be the people around
[25:03] you help you back to your feet that
[25:06] you're going to depend upon. And if if
[25:08] you have a whole church that nobody's
[25:10] willing to do that, the people go down
[25:11] and they don't come back up. Amen.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[25:17] So,
[25:19] that's where we need to be. We need to
[25:20] be united. We need to uh we need to have
[25:24] it's not like I said, it's not just
[25:26] taking on the shield of faith. It's it's
[25:29] taking on the shield of faith and using
[25:31] it using it in the in in in a united
[25:34] fashion. And that's when it becomes
[25:36] really truly powerful.
[25:39] [snorts]
[25:41] We look at the in Matthew chapter 13. Um
[25:45] the parable of the tears. Um
[25:49] I'm sorry. Uh the Tower of Babel is not
[25:50] Genesis 13. It's Genesis 11. But the
[25:53] parable of the tears in Matthew 13
[25:55] 24-30.
[25:57] And I'm sure we're all familiar with it.
[25:58] I'm not going to take the time to read
[26:00] it. Um well, I guess we can. um
[26:05] put he forth unto them, saying, "The
[26:06] kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man
[26:08] which swed good seed in his field." Um
[26:11] and while a man slept, his enemy came
[26:12] and swed tears among the wheat and um
[26:15] went his way.
[26:17] When the blade was sprung up and brought
[26:19] forth fruit, then appeared the tears
[26:21] also.
[26:23] So the ser uh householder came and said
[26:27] unto him, "Sir, did uh not thou sow good
[26:30] seed in thy field? from whence then hath
[26:33] it tears?
[26:35] Said unto them, an enemy hath done this.
[26:37] The servant said unto him, Wilt thou
[26:39] then that we go and gather them up? But
[26:42] he said, Nay, lest while you gather root
[26:45] up also the wheat with them. Let both
[26:48] grow together until the harvest. And in
[26:50] the time of harvest, I will say to the
[26:52] reapers, gather ye together first the
[26:54] tears, and bind them in bundles to
[26:56] gather the wheat unto my barn. So here
[27:00] we have at the end. So this is a parable
[27:01] of the end time, right? This is when
[27:03] when when
[27:05] the, you know, we're separating the the
[27:07] the sheep and the goats, so to speak.
[27:10] It's going to require a binding
[27:12] together. It's going to require a
[27:14] uniting, a gathering together that
[27:16] there's going to it would require a
[27:17] spirit. Don't be don't be mystified when
[27:20] you see the church world uniting and
[27:23] everyone coming together
[27:26] because that's the binding of the tears.
[27:28] Of course they have to gather together.
[27:30] Of course they have to group together.
[27:31] If they didn't, then you're going to
[27:34] have them interspersed with the wheat
[27:35] and the tears together, right? But it's
[27:38] going to require and so and at the same
[27:40] time that the tears are being bound
[27:42] together, so is the wheat.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; At the end, there has to be a pulling
[27:46] together and a uniting together.
[27:49] Um
[27:51] Benjamin Franklin's famous for saying
[27:53] that, you know, after they signed the
[27:54] Declaration of Independence, he said,
[27:55] "Gentlemen, we must all hang together or
[27:57] most assuredly we will all hang
[27:59] separately."
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Right? Um if you don't
[28:05] with your
[28:06] fellow Christians, you will be bound.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; You're going to be bound one way or the
[28:12] other. You either get bound together
[28:13] with your fellow Christians or your
[28:15] fellow believers, or you'll be bound
[28:16] with the the tears. But you're you're
[28:19] not going to get away from some sort of
[28:21] being bound, right? You're going to be
[28:22] in one group or the other. Oh, that's
[28:26] why you gather together even more so as
[28:28] you see the day approaching. You know,
[28:30] do your utmost to to
[28:35] fight to have common ground with your
[28:37] with the people you share a church with,
[28:39] right? If you, you know, look
[28:45] expects every single group of people to
[28:48] never have a disagreement or a
[28:50] misunderstanding or um conflict or
[28:55] I don't know, just clashes of
[28:56] personality. We're all different people.
[28:57] We have come different personalities and
[28:59] it's supposed to be that way. You're not
[29:01] necessarily going to get along with
[29:03] everybody off the bat. You have an
[29:06] obligation to fight to figure out how to
[29:07] do so, right? do and it's you're not
[29:10] fighting them, you're fighting the devil
[29:11] who's trying to drive a wedge between
[29:13] you.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; Find a way to bind together with the
[29:16] people, even the people that you just
[29:18] really can't stand. Work even harder to
[29:20] be friends with them, right? Because
[29:23] because
[29:25] that's what's going to bring you want
[29:27] you want to rushing mighty wind move
[29:29] through your church, do that.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; Right? Find a way to lay aside your
[29:32] petty differences.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; So what if they disagree with you on
[29:35] something?
[29:36] &gt;&gt; So what if they disagree with you on
[29:38] some point of doctrine? get the right
[29:39] spirit and the doctrinal stuff will work
[29:41] itself out.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[29:45] Um I've got to wrap up here, but I I do
[29:48] want to make one final point. Um, and
[29:50] maybe this is what I'll I'll maybe touch
[29:52] on this next time, but
[29:56] um,
[29:57] [crying]
[29:59] one of the things that, you know, you
[30:01] look at the sort of the the the world
[30:03] today,
[30:05] like you say, in this era of of
[30:06] unifying, one of the major and I
[30:08] mentioned, you know, there would be a
[30:09] spirit of division in the land so that
[30:12] the spir when the spir when a a spirit
[30:14] of false unity would come, it would it
[30:15] would be appealing to people.
[30:19] If you're following politics, especially
[30:21] sort of like the really bleeding edge of
[30:22] politics, the stuff that you don't
[30:23] really necessarily see stuff that's
[30:25] going on sort of in the in the u on the
[30:28] fringes, the stuff that's going to
[30:30] become policy in five years, but no
[30:32] one's ever heard of right now. Um what
[30:35] you see on out there is amongst young
[30:38] people especially the absolute
[30:41] resentment that you have of young people
[30:45] young men 30 18 to 30 years old towards
[30:47] older generations is mindboggling. I
[30:50] don't think there's ever been a period
[30:51] in in human history in which the younger
[30:53] generations had this level of resentment
[30:55] towards the older generations. It is
[30:57] mindblowing how extreme it is.
[31:01] And in that environment,
[31:06] you when this when that's the that's the
[31:10] stage for for for the final, you know,
[31:14] chapter of the world, right? like the
[31:15] the final chap, you know, the the grand
[31:17] finale of
[31:19] um of history is
[31:25] one in which there's such
[31:27] intergenerational
[31:29] resentment and bitterness.
[31:31] I cannot
[31:34] separate from that the idea the the the
[31:36] the fact that the prophecy of Malachi 4
[31:39] that would be the prophet for this day
[31:42] was specifically addressing
[31:45] iting the hearts of children and fathers
[31:48] &gt;&gt; that parents and and that specifically
[31:51] Malachi 4 that we hang our entire
[31:55] everything on that prophecy was
[31:58] specifically addressing returning hearts
[32:00] of children to fathers and fathers of
[32:02] children and in this day and age
[32:05] intergenerational bitterness is so
[32:07] extreme I cannot uh separate those two I
[32:10] I just can't
[32:12] when So look, if you are in the older
[32:16] generation, it is if you really want to
[32:19] fulfill the message of Malachi 4, find a
[32:21] way to build bridges to the young
[32:22] people. Find a way. That is, I mean,
[32:26] that's the message of Malachi 4 right
[32:27] there. Put it in a I mean, literally.
[32:30] And likewise, if you're a young person,
[32:32] find a way to build bridges to the older
[32:34] generations. That's how you fulfill the
[32:36] prophecy of Malachi 4 in a real
[32:38] practical sense,
[32:39] &gt;&gt; right? Not to say say that, you know,
[32:41] obviously there was William Brandon who
[32:43] fulfilled the prophecy. If you want to
[32:45] carry that message, if you want to play
[32:47] that prophecy for the age out, find a
[32:50] way to do that because that's the spirit
[32:51] of what you what you're dealing with is
[32:53] disunityity
[32:55] and specifically of intergenerational
[32:59] um uh disunityity, right? And I'll I'll
[33:03] I'll read um and I'm going to reread
[33:07] this. This is something I read
[33:08] previously. This is from a message
[33:09] called oneness in 1962. Now the first
[33:12] man and first woman in the garden of
[33:13] Eden was in perfect harmony with God. So
[33:15] much that God could come down at any
[33:18] time he desired and talk lip to ear with
[33:19] Adam and Eve. Now that is perfect
[33:21] oneness. God and his creation. God
[33:23] speaking.
[33:25] And they were so perfect in harmony with
[33:27] God till they were one with God. God and
[33:30] his family was one. And this is what I
[33:32] want to highlight. any man and his
[33:34] family, a correct, good, noble, obedient
[33:37] family is one with another. Any family.
[33:40] And if there's something in the family
[33:42] that moves them apart,
[33:45] the family's broken somewhere. They
[33:47] should all be one. Father with mother,
[33:49] mother with father, children with
[33:51] parents, parents with children, all in
[33:53] agreement. Okay. So, I will finish with
[33:56] that. Let's stand and have a word of
[33:58] prayer.
[34:01] Father, Lord, we come before you this
[34:05] for the word that you've given us and
[34:07] the opportunity that we have to meet
[34:08] together in this place. ask that you
[34:11] would be mindful of us and the as we
[34:13] progress through the service as the
[34:16] worship service would commence that the
[34:17] people would be able to cast aside any
[34:19] of the burdens of the world, the burdens
[34:21] of their mind and focus solely on you
[34:23] and worship of your holy name and you'd
[34:27] be pleased to come down and dwell with
[34:29] us and walk amongst us and impart us you
[34:32] unto us the word of life through the
[34:35] preaching of the word. We ask these
[34:36] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[34:37] Christ. Amen.
