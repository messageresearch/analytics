family appreciate that um it's just a privilege to to serve him tonight isn't it amen let's get right into the word uh turn in your Bibles to Genesis the 32nd chapter um you might hear a few familiar things tonight if you heard my Sunday school a few weeks ago but it's mostly all new material so it's all right amen the Lord sometimes does that when I'm studying he'll reignite my heart on something he gave me for a Sunday school and maybe change some things and uh make it a little bit more preach amen hope that's all right we have two scriptures we'll be reading from uh Genesis 32 and then Ephesians chapter 1 so we're going to start at verse one in Genesis 32 familiar story and Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him and when Jacob saw them he said this is God's host and he called the name of that place mahanahan and Jacob sent his Messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of seir the country of Edom and he commanded them saying thus shall ye speak unto the Lord Esau thy servant Jacob has saith thus I have sojourned with laan stayed there until now and I have oxen and asses flocks and men's servants women servants and I have sent to tell the Lord what I may find Grace in thy sight and The Messengers returned to Jacob saying we came to thy brother Esau and also he cometh to meet thee and 400 men with him then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the people that was with him in the flocks and the herds and the camels into two bonds bands and said if Esau come to one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall Escape and Jacob said oh god of My Father Abraham and God of my father Isaac the Lord which Sayes unto me return under thy country and to thy Kindred and I will deal well with thee I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies and of all the truth which thou has showed unto thy servant for with my staff I passed over this Jordan and now I have become two bands deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of Esau for I fear Him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children and and thou set I will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered and let's move down to verse 22 he says and he rose up that night and he took his two wives and his two women servants and his 11 sons and passed over the four jaac and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent them all that he had and Jacob was left alone that's an important scripture and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breth and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto them what is thy name he said Jacob and he said thy name shall no more be called Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men and Hast prevailed and Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou Dost ask after my my name and he blessed him there and Jacob called the name of that place pineal for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved amen let's move over to Ephesians the first chapter Ephesians chapter 1 and we're going to start at verse three amen give you a moment to turn there Ephesians 1 and verse three it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ Heavenly in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his Gra wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself aren't you glad for that that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are in Earth even in him in whom we have obtained an inheritance an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise that's an important one which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of our purchased possession under the praise of his glory amen let's just bow our bow our heads this this evening Heavenly Father Lord God we just come before your throne this evening Lord father there's nothing that I could say Lord Jesus that would help a single person but Lord You're Here father and we know that Lord when you're here Lord it it makes everything all right Lord I just pray that you could minister to our hearts father God set me aside Lord Jesus help me be a conduit for the people to Lord receive your word from Lord God anoint my lips Lord anoint your text Lord father just anoint everything in this service tonight Lord may it all be for the glory and for the honor of of you Lord Jesus we love you now and we commit it all to you in Jesus name amen God bless you tonight um I'm taking a title tonight of the unconditional thanks bro the unconditional Covenant and I'd like to uh sub if I could subtitle it insight to Victory insight to Victory my heart has been fixed these past several weeks on the grace of God through Jacob's life amen Jacob was a man that was absolutely ordained in the scriptures to carry out something important in God's plan amen we all can agree with that but there are so many instances in his life where he fell so short anden brother brandom says this in the identified masterpieces of God 1964 he says we got one we must keep in harmony with that's God and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word remains God and always will be God because God is in his word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the person of the Son of God now we find that after he found this great marring it looked like had been you and I and we'd put all the time and effort we'd kick the thing over and just let it go but not God he was not willing to let that thing go to ruin aren't you glad for that that's the love of God aren't you glad for that no wonder the poet says brother brandom says would we with ink the ocean fill and were the Skies of parchment made and every stalk on earth a quill and every man ascribed by trade right the love of God would drain the ocean dry or could the scroll contain the hole though stretched from Sky to Sky see it's the love of God the prophet said after man had fallen and deliberately opened the door to the enemy and come in and marred him and set death in him still God was not willing willing this be defeated he came down he started all over again he was going to make that man again I want you to notice this brother bom says he put Adam on a covenant do this and not this this not that touch not handle not taste not but we find out when he started again he started with Abraham and in Abraham he started him on an unconditional Covenant Hallelujah now not if you will but I have I've already done it I've blessed you and your seed and so forth after you it was an unconditional Covenant then we find out that he based on Abraham and give him the Covenant unconditional the promise it was it was an unconditional guarantee not if you will but I've already done it thanks be to God he's already done the work so that means that he just has to mold our lives so that he he can get us to perfectly agree with the work that he's already done amen hallelujah that's why you can get down into Jacob's life where we read and you can see his human nature and you can see how he kept he was failing and and he and he lied and he was a Shyer and and he had fear rule over his life even in this chapter but God had a plan all along Amen to bring him into complete submission it was an unconditional promise there was nothing that Jacob could do to not be a part of that Covenant because it was unconditional Hallelujah I'm so thankful for that then he came brother Benham says to the Patriarchs we come next in the Old Testament as we get down here he displayed the foundation of the work now we're going to go through some things in Isaac's life we're going to go through some things in Jacob's life those are the four Patriarchs Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph amen and now Abraham represented faith we know that brother bam says because Abraham was Faith he was the great faith because he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief you know when he when we'd say the chips is down and everything's against us he still held on to God then we have Isaac he says which was beloved Son which represents love because Abraham being a type of God as Isaac was offered Genesis 22 we find out that he carried the wood up the hill and everything portrayed Christ foreshadowed him and then the ram came and was offered in instead and now that was Faith love and a little bit further down the prophet says now Jacob which means supplanter and that's Deceiver and we realize that Jacob's life really represents Grace because it was the grace of God all the time with Jacob amen you know and I made this point in in the Sunday School a few weeks ago and it so struck me people have experiences with God all the time in their life all throughout their life and I honestly believe that they are real and true encounters with God you can look at Jacob's life you know God came to him several times supernaturally at bethl he gave him a vision of angels descending and ascending into heaven and and God spoke to him he said Jacob I'm with you and and I'll be with you and I'll keep you and I won't leave you and and your descendants will be like the dust of the earth Jacob was even reminding him of that promise when he was when in the scripture we read and what more could someone need than an experience like that amen God coming supernaturally in a vision and telling you these words but see it wasn't what God had ordained for him yet it wasn't enough because Jacob hadn't yet fully surrendered himself to God's perfect will in his life amen he hadn't come face to face with God yet and it hadn't caused him to walk differently amen but you see it was all the time the workings of Grace in his life I love this scripture it was really it's part of really the core of my of my thought tonight Galatians 3:26 for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you has been baptized into Christ have put on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond nor free there is neither female nor male male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus and if ye be Christ then ye are Abraham's seed and hes according to the promise see so those that have been baptized into Christ spiritually baptized and died to the things of the world are heirs according to the promise the unconditional Covenant promise that God made to Abraham hallelujah amen Jacob you know he had workings of Grace in and throughout his life you know and God was really with him at all those points in his life you know when when we see there you know he was at bethl and then he was with with his father-in-law laan for those 14 years and then when he ran from laan we see all these instances where God is with Jacob but you see there's a real difference and I want you to notice this tonight there's a real difference between experiences with Christ and having an experience that changes your nature amen that's why the prophet teaches us in this Muran Church age he says away with experiences but he doesn't say it doesn't stop there he says away with experiences as your measuring line amen so in other words experiences are important even the experiences that you have before you're born again of the spirit of God are still important otherwise God would not have written about those experiences that happened in Jacob's life those experiences that happened in Peter's life before Pentecost those things are important but until you get baptized into the spirit of Christ then you need to have a face-to-face experience with him Hallelujah in that sermon brother Eno said the whole of our problem there in the church age book is that people repent of our of their sin that's important amen you baptize and they baptize in Repentance but then they never go and receive the Holy Ghost sure you know Jacob had experiences of God but none of them had been enough to affect a real change in his life amen until you have an experience that allows you to match up with this word then you have not come face to face with God in your life amen you know they experien that Peno was one that God could could finally break him of his own will amen I want God to break me of my own will I know I've got the Holy Ghost but I still got some of my own will that grips me and I want him to break me of it amen who's with me tonight I want to I want to be broken Lord I want to I want you to lead and guide every aspect of my life glory to God you look back on things that God does in your life and you know you you you and as as a Christian you know that it was Christ it was the grace of God working in your life you you know it even before you had an experienced you you know wow like you think back on that that had to be God that saved me from that situation or that changed this there because he has ordained you amen there is a seed placed on the inside of you that a specific point in time there's going to shine a light amen the light of the word and it's going to bring it to life amen and then you're going to have Hallelujah that if face to- face experience God is a patient God because he works outside of the realm of time amen sometimes we're impatient because we work in time but God works outside of time he sees the finished product thanks be to God glory to God he has a greater plan for then than for you to stay the way that you are amen then to let that old nature rule you like they like Jacob did or like Peter did he he he's you to something greater he has ordained you to not live in defeat every day as a Christian he has ordained you to live a Victorious Life in Jesus Christ I know many times we have Falls and failures and things that happen in our life but God has ordained you to be victorious in this day brother B would say that that when the time comes it would be so close to Christ CU why we're we're in the word we're we're constantly just oh we're constantly repenting because we want to be right with God all the time amen we we want to make sure that we're living in his perfect will glory to God you know I was I was studying for this last night and brother the Lord just placed on my heart to put this in here from the church age book it's in that sman church age brother Ram says it is not the person that comes predestinated it is not the person that comes pred destinated eternally from God now watch this it is the word or seed that is it way back there to far back from the human mind to grasp the Eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated in Romans 9:13 and neither was born and neither had done good or evil see it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and God brought bought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed amen Jacob alone had the seed and that is why he had respect to the birthright and the Covenant of God Amen you read that story with Jacob and Esau and you wonder it's because Jacob there was something inside Jacob that his whole life his whole life even before he had that experience there was something inside I want that birth right glory to God and he says he says if you are true seed then you will hear the word the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age Hallelujah you see how clear the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you you know he says again not Jesus was the royal seed he lived in a human body and when the spirit called to him the manifested the word manifested thought he went to the Jordan and was there baptized in water amen he went down to the water amen upon obeying the word the Holy Spirit came upon him and the voice said this is my beloved Son hear ye him the voice did not say this has become the son Jesus was the son the Holy Ghost positioned him as the son before them all then having been filled thus and the patterns the same pattern holds at Pentecost and after he went in demonstrated power receiving the full revelation of God and from God for that day amen I have no doubt in my life that in my and I have no doubt that many people in their lives have encounters with God genuine experiences with God I have no doubt about that but the dividing line is whether your life matches the word after you've had that experience it is absolutely pivotal that you look if my life does not match up with the word then I need to have another experience and this time this experience needs to match the word hallelujah did you go back to your old ways after you had that experience that's the problem brother bam said is that they had this experience and they repented all their sins and that's good for the past but now you need something for the future that's why you get the Holy Ghost baptized into your soul because then you can walk with Christ daily Hallelujah glory to to God you know Jacob could say before pineal that I am I am bloodline I'm C Gene of Abraham amen you know I'd have no doubt that he probably met his grandfather Abraham and he watched the working of God through his life and and through his his father's life Isaac and and and Rebecca no doubt that Isaac and Rebecca would probably love that story would probably tell their love story of how God supernaturally brought them together amen I I love that story you know growing up I I just I just imagine that Rebecca would tell Jacob the story how it was one day like any other day that Rebecca was down by the well tending to her family's business when a man came down by the well and this man had camels and and there was something about this man as he as he walked up maybe maybe she could sense that he was a follower of maybe the same Jehovah or you know but how Rebecca felt felt so compelled to go above and beyond what he had asked of her amen the prayer that elaser had prayed was not only will you let her give me water but will you let her give my camels water and something deep down all that deep calls and it responds something deep down says I want to give more I want to feed your camels too Hallelujah Rebecca was being water tested that day Hallelujah what was going to be her reaction amen something about being at the well that day was different because God had orchestrated a servant of Abraham to go and look for a bride for his son Hallelujah and it was going to be based on her reaction on her response that the servant that day would know that this is the one because eler himself was a servant he knew the he knew the heart of a servant he knew what the character of a servant's heart looked like and he prayed that prayer and he asked God let it come to pass amen he knew this is the one to whom my master was seeking amen you know it reminded me of the story there in judges when Gideon was in preparation for that great battle you know if familiar with the story God had prepared this Mighty Man of Valor to to take on an army and to defeat the midianites amen but God had kept dwindling down that Army amen we he started with north of 32,000 men but God had kept making that number smaller and smaller amen and finally God told Gideon he said take them down to the water this is how I will choose the ones that will stand and fight for me in the battle amen he was going to water test those soldiers and it would be based on their reaction to the water it was going to be how they conducted themselves around the water that God would choose who would stand and fight with Gideon I want you to catch that tonight I know it's a simple thing but catch that it would be based on the reaction to the water how they conducted themselves and friends tonight how you conduct yourself around the water of the word is so vital these things are types they happen in the word and when he comes to the the water in the scriptures types the words the Waters of life and how you react to the Waters of life when it's ministered to you even when it's hard even when it's a correction even when you need to change your life how you react is important because it shows what's on the inside of the inside amen hallelujah the Bible says straight is the gate straight isn't like a line straight is a narrow passage of water water is the gate amen water is the gate to the to the Waters of Life Hallelujah you know he's looking for men and women to be water tested not a manufactured thing you know Rebecca's actions at the well that day just reflected something that was already down in her heart down in her soul amen I love that scripture it judges 74 but the Lord said to Gideon the people are still too many bring them down to the water and I will test them for you there then it will be that of of whom I say to you this one shall go the same shall go with you and of whomever I say to you this one shall not go the same shall not go so he told Gideon part of his plan but he said I'm going to be the one that tests them so all Gideon had all his instructions were were go and complete this task and he did what God Said but he had no idea how how they were going to lap the water or how they were going to drink he had no idea exactly what was going to take place and God didn't tell tell him which ones or which way or or any of the fine details amen he just said I will test them and whomever I say and I and I can just think because I'm human like Gideon was that maybe he saw the majority it was 9700 and he saw man that's that's going to be my battle he must have wanted to send those 300 he he must they must have had something in their life that that just wasn't ready but no God picked those 300 men amen from 10,000 soldiers that went down to the water that day 97 of 100 of them did not go to battle thans God's ways are higher than our ways you know he he knows what's going on in the inward parts of our hearts and the inward parts of our souls he you know those 300 men had conducted themselves a certain way they partook of it a certain way you know may not have it may not have been the way that that Gideon would have thought you know it may it may it may not been the the way that we would think today you know but maybe maybe I just had I don't have any quotes on this this is this brother Caleb maybe they maybe the majority you know knelt down their knee in a certain way I don't know why that they did it the way that they did but God obviously saw something in the way that they responded to the water and he sees the way that you respond to the water of the word he sees your reaction to what's being ministered he sees your reaction to when you read the scriptures he sees the thoughts that go through your mind the thoughts in the tense of your heart amen he knows those inward parts of you amen he knows you know and you know God he's looking for his bride like little Rebecca there at the well to display their true nature you know if you go back and you read about Rebecca her family put the decision into her hands and something had risen in her heart and I believe it was some faith that God had placed there to know that this was something important I need to go with this messenger I need to go now I can't wait you know because you read down even just a few days you know the the eler came I know we're all familiar with the story but Bible stories are amazing amen glory to God she watched eler deliver the message from the master and there was something so real about it there was something so genuine he he he told he told her family about how my master and and his son and how he has all these things prepared and how you're going to be his bride and how you just need to come with me and and and and and he was a trusted servant amen you know and and elaser he didn't waste any time he came to find a wife for his master's son and by faith Rebecca walked into the love of her life amen I want to Beth answered and said the thing proceedeth from the Lord Lord we cannot speak unto thee good or bad behold Rebecca is before thee take her and let her go and be thy Master's son's wife and um I'm just going to skip down verses 54 and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and carried all night and they rose up in the morning and he said send me away to thy master and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days at the least 10 after that she shall go and he said unto them hinder me not seeing that the Lord had prospered my way send me away that I may go to my master catch this let the damsel abide just a few days it seems like a pretty fair request amen he he's about to take the Beloved daughter of this family obviously she she did a lot for this family if she was down by the by the the well that day she was a hard worker in the family they were they were loved anybody loves their daughter you know you don't want their you don't want her leave amen so it seemed like a pretty fair request am mean all of this had happened so quickly but you see the bridegroom was waiting amen and the supper was prepared and the servant knew that that this this she can't stay even if it's just a slight chance that she'll somehow change her mind she needs to come back with me now amen something maybe maybe he thought in his mind something may happen to her on the journey I don't know I need to have her with me when I'm when I meet my master son am he had to make sure he completed that task he was convincing her to come I want you to notice this this struck my heart because that's why we preach the gospel amen that's what the messenger is sent to accomplish is to convince the bride to come but the problem with convincing someone to do something is the devil can convince you to do a lot of things amen he's the master of persuasion amen he he you know he he he he he's beening doing this a lot longer than any of us have and he knows how to trick our minds and he knows how to say well why don't we just say Abide a few more days how why don't we say Terry a little bit longer why don't we say let's wait a little bit longer I'm not fully ready to surrender this thing in my life I'm not fully ready to give this thing up because he's the master of deception he's the master he's the he has the art already he wrote the book amen so you know when God places something on your heart to do something you need to surrender that thing right then you need to let God come in and sweep out the house in your life Hallelujah that's what pastor does when he's up here that's what brother Matt these brothers do they come up here to convince you to come how did Rebecca know that this was right how how did she know there was something in her she had to take a step of Faith amen and we can do all the convincing we can do we can't give you anything I have nothing to offer you all I can do is tell you about one who has everything to offer all I can do I is Proclaim listen if you follow me if you listen to the words that I'm saying they're words of life and you're going to meet your bridegroom and there's going to be something there that that you've never had before I realize that you're going to have to leave back your family I realize that you're going to have to leave everything you've ever known Rebecca but if you come with me oh bride if you come with me oh oh I've got a message from a prophet that says that we're going home and this is the only way Hallelujah to be baptized amen hallelujah into the spirit of Christ hallelujah hallelujah elzer had nothing in himself to offer her but he could bring her to someone that did I love the way brother bam says it he says I I just I can't tell you all about it but I know it works amen that's you you get up here I tell you my experiences I tell you I'll tell you all the word that I know I'll tell you everything that I know but I I can't tell you all of it I don't know how it's going to work I don't know how we're going to be translated I don't know but I believe it and if you come with me you're going to go with me hallelujah hallelujah she could have stayed or she could have gone but it was worth it when she took that step of Faith she just knew the Bible says the wise shall understand all she had to go on was this testimony and the E evidence that he brought with her you know thinking I was thinking about this you know that's all the Israelites had to go on when Caleb and Joshua came back was a testimony of Two Men And if you remember the giant grape uh the giant grapes that they had that it took two men to carry some on a pole there was evidence there was a testimony but they took the majority's testimony amen this stuff this stuff is real saints of God there there was evidence of their promise this is the promised land this is this is what we've been waiting for all the land flowing with milk and honey ah but I can't get past this thing in my life oh you can you can overcome anything oh God gives you his spirit and I a mountain is a mountain still even after you've been born again but God moves those mountains amen he he moves those mountains of doubt in your life he can do that amen but you've got to be baptized into the spirit of God you've got to allow him to indwell you John 14 he the spirit of TR truth indwelling inside of you Hallelujah we've got more evidence than they had amen we've got the the countless testimonies of thousands and thousands thousands and thousands we've got the words of a prophet who went beyond the curtain hallelujah oh he went beyond the curtain Hallelujah aren't you glad for that aren't you glad you can BR play and and you can hear the words of a man who who went beyond the curtain of time Hallelujah he saw something that I know that I'm longing for he saw it he tasted of it and now I believe his word and I'm following him all the way hallelujah praise God catch this saints that the decision was left up to her I just I just love the words she says I will go I will go and just to finish this story Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the even tide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming and Rebecca lifted up her eyes when she saw Isaac she lighted off the candle the camel think of it how glad Rebecca when when you behold your bride your bridegroom how happy you're going to be Hallelujah that you made that decision CU it's a decision that you have to make that you made that decision oh I'm going to follow all the way Hallelujah and I I just love it because not only did she lift up her eyes but Isaac lifted up his eyes amen oh Saints brother Matt was talking about it on Sunday oh the the the this book it's it's it's written for us it's written because he didn't want heaven without us oh he brought Heaven down I love that song he didn't want it all without us he created it all so that we could be in fellowship with him so that we could spend eternity with him he did that because he loves you he did that because he wants to talk with you he does the trials and things in your life because he knows the true character comes that way thanks be to God oh Hallelujah scripture says 2 Timothy 4:8 there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me on that day and not only to me but unto all those who love his appearing how glad you're going to be saints of God when the dead in Christ shall rise I was just thinking about it the other morning I'm thinking I'm going to be standing in the kitchen and I'm going to see Zoe come and it's just going to be something so unexplainable amen it's going to be it's going to be him bringing us to where he's always wanted us to be oh he's going to bring that unconditional Covenant to to fruition he's going to bring it to pass glory to God you know many many people and I made this point in in my Sunday school many people believe it you know it's not just believing it with with your words it's those that go all the way with it it's those that allow that Bel belief to be more than words in your mouth that allow it to go from your mouth into your heart and from your heart into your life and in your life to your family and your work and every aspect amen I I we've got things in our life that we need to surrender to God he needs to be in every aspect not because he's trying brother Jason made that point not because he's he he's trying but because that's how he's going to get you where he needs you to be Hallelujah it's it's more than just repeating words and and and going to church and listening to tapes it it's an experience it's life altering it's life changing amen and you know I had made that point but Rebecca had to leave everything you know she had to leave her home she had to leave her parents she had to leave her family she had to leave her duties she had to leave listen the comfort of what she's always known sometimes you have to leave the comfort of what you know amen even in even baptized Born Again Christians sometimes need to leave the comfortability of what you've been doing every day because God wants you to take a different turn he wants you to go further with him he's constantly trying to get you to rise up higher amen it's all going to be worth it brother renom says in the fifth seal he says notice Rebecca when the servant of Abraham elzer when he came to get Rebecca she she she mounted upon a camel and the Very camel that she watered she rode this camel to meet her unseen bridegroom the very thing she watered was the thing that took her to her future home and husband catch that Saints it's the same thing today the very thing that the church is watering that is the seed the seed of the word it's the very word that becomes alive and Carries us to our unseen bridegroom oh the message isn't just some book it's not just some tape it's the living reality of Jesus Christ to me oh when I listen to something it's almost like he's sitting across the table and he's opening those words of life to me that's what it is for you Hallelujah every time you open the book Hallelujah I want to be the kind of believer that stood by the water that day and wanted to go further I want to feed more than just you I want to feed everything in my life I want to give it all to you you Jesus Hallelujah getting back to Jacob here for a moment you know until each individual has that encounter with God and doesn't leave that place until they walk different it's only then can the nature of Christ truly Rule and reign in your life and then the evidence displays itself in your life in your everyday walk your listen your attitude changes those things that you once struggled with maybe certain things that you once walked close to the line with amen those things amen they start aligning with the word of God it doesn't always happen overnight Saints sometimes God is working to get you where he needs to be but the moment he places something on your heart that's the moment that you need to act on it amen and it's when that experience matches up exactly with the word exactly what was it with Jacob in verse 24 I had said and Jacob was left alone as simple as that is that verse is so powerful because I want you to notice his family came we read that his family came with him all of his servants everybody in Jacob's life all of his possessions everything was with Jacob but but Jacob was left alone because having that experience doesn't happen with you and and somebody else it doesn't happen with you and your parents it doesn't happen with you and your spouse it doesn't happen with you and your friend it doesn't happen with you and your girlfriend you and your boyfriend it happens with you and God Alone amen God gives us those things he gives us families he gives us spouses he gives us friends and I'm thankful for those things amen but it has to be you and God Alone it has to be done alone Jacob was an eagle and when that eagle gets to a point man that clock is working against me he was an eagle and then that eagle gets to a point in his natural life for it to start spreading its wings the mama eagle takes it up there always watching over it but she lets it start flying on its own in the atmospheres of life amen and I believe that God is looking for us to take flight Amen brother bom says and he's talking about the eagle nature he says you get up there where you trust God to believe him for healing to believe him for salvation you believe him for the Holy Ghost you believe him for everything trust him your Eagles you're you're you're you're child of God you believe like God does wow what a statement you believe his word because why because you've been feeding on his word you've been fed by the Holy Ghost the word and then you can fly oh I love that that's in the Feast of trumpets 1964 I love that because you believe his word because you've been feeding on his word amen later on in that sermon he says there shows that we've got to come again with that same spirit that was on John he introduced the Messiah he was greater than all the prophets he introduced it and we've got to come to a place again to something that's going to introduce the Messiah that's what the message came to do to introduce the Messiah Hallelujah and how will the Messiah the people that believes him knowing the people that's believing him know it unless they're constantly in the word to know Daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know they shall know their God now now how shall he appear in the last days to bring the people back to his word so that the bride will know her husband and he'll know her mate the revealed word that's why it has to happen the way that it did that's why you can't just read the words on the page it has to become a living reality because it has to change your life if you just read it like a book from page to page it's never going to affect change in your life but when you apply it when you listen to The Prophet's words when you hear it then you recognize it then you can act on it and then God can change you from glory to glory amen he goes on to say this and as the eagle stirreth her nest in 1958 and flutter over her Young young he says well you know she watched because once in a while one gets out of order kind of goes Topsy Turvy you know gets to floing around and and can't get his balance again and the prophet says I sure believe in grace aren't you thankful for Grace then mother Eagle Jehovah Eagle you know what she does she flies right down and she catches him on his wings and bears him right back into Grace again that's the way she does it that's the way the mother Eagle does don't be scared to do some flopping some trying some pressing some taking God his word you can't go wrong you're not going to hurt yourself you ain't going to hurt yourself say well he might let me hit the ground them little Eagles don't worry nothing about it they see Mama all the time they're having a Pentecostal Jubilee just having a big old big time flopping anything they're having a big time you you don't be scared you're you're G to you might mess up every once in a while but you'll know the change has set in because you won't be able to leave yourself in that messed up condition oh I know I fell today Lord but I don't want to stay Fallen I don't want to stay that way Lord Lord fly me back up into Grace again forgive me Lord with a contrite heart Lord I come to you oh and he flied you right back up into Grace again hallelujah it's a clear change in your life that Vision that Jacob had you know God had told him about his lineage and how they were going to be like the sand of the sea and you know what he was what he was doing was he was giving Jacob insight to his victory he was giving him insight to his future and you know wow that was a mighty experience I've never had a vision you know I've had some things that were really Vivid in my life and the Lord really corrected me on things amen I hope we all have but I've never had a Vision like that but I would imagine that my that would be quite an experience to have something like that amen but Jacob didn't come face to face until four chapters later at the pineal experience this time it was it was tangible amen this time it was a revelation it's not until you come to that critical place in your life where where Christ has gotten you into a place and you are willing to surrender all of it amen you're willing to have your name changed amen even though because you know even though Jacob was always ordained to that Jacob's life still reflected that old character but this time it was different it was it wasn't just the surface level it wasn't surface level religion I don't want surface level religion I don't want to just hear a nice psychology sermon I don't want to just hear oh that was that itched my ears a little bit that was great no I want to I want to hear something that changes me I want the pastor to get up and correct to me I want him to say no you need to do something different you need to live higher than you're living you need to change this you need to go further with Christ amen because that'll affect change in your life it's got to be more than just a bethl experience experiences with God are great and I believe whatever experience that you have is great but if you come face to face with God and I believe that even if you have come face to face that God will still give you experiences all throughout your life amen and you'll know that it's real because it matches the word aligned perfectly with everything it says hallelujah glory to God your thought patterns change everything about your life changes amen glory to God because why because you've got his Spirit living in you now amen you know I was listening to the prophets a couple weeks ago and and he was talking about John the Baptist I think he actually was quoting another Minister but he said you know talking about John the one who had in the Bible who who they said receive the holy ghost in the in the womb of his mother amen the one who baptized Jesus in the Jordan he was the one who watched the Holy Spirit descend like a dove and he had gotten into a point in his life in prison brother bham says that his Eagle Eye had gotten filmed over down there in prison sometimes those pressures in life whatever it is Trials circumstances whatever it is sometimes they film over your eyes a little bit amen and that does not mean that you're not a Believer saints of God that just means that God has a little growth to get you from don't ever let the devil lie to you amen if there's a desire in your heart oh then then he's still there glory to God a man who was a witness this a man who was a witness he witnessed Jesus amen yet he got into this trial in his life and and his eagle eyes got filmed over and he said you know he had this brother ROM said he like Elijah he had this breakdown and when he was under the juniper tree you know John had that breakdown in prison and he was a high-pitched Prophet them nerves on edge then his eagle eyes got filmed over he said go see if I've been wrong ask ask him if he is the one or another do we look for another one John sent his disciples when he was in prison say are you the one or or do we look for another one the one who baptized him the one who saw the spirit of God descend like a dove because what happened he says Jesus never sent any book to say now here's to have patience when you're in jail or so forth what did he say what did he tell him he said just stay and watch this afternoon's meeting and then go show John the lame walk and the blind see take this testimony with you oh I've got the testimony the L same walk the blind see spiritually I was blind spiritually I was dead but now I see amen I've been healed in my natural body I've been healed in my spiritual body oh but now I see God has brought me from a place where I was to now where I am and I want him to take me further Hallelujah glory to God sometimes you you read these things and you know it helps you recognize our human nature a little bit amen cuz we all we've got it you know and it helps us to understand the things that we go through in life Prophet says this and this all right tonight amen I I just I have a lot of quotes but quotes are awesome he says in letting off the pressure he says this old Eagle he gets crusted over his face and head when he gets old can hardly eat he gets poor his mouth won't shut right gets almost blinded and when that crust gets to a certain point a spot over his head they say he flies up way in the air and he sits there and he beats his head against that rock knocking the crust off if he can and he rolls his eyes and looks back and he beats the crust oh it must come off it's got to come off if it don't he's going to die he's got to get the crust off his face and his mouth and he'd beat his head one way and then another when he it against that rock until the crust comes off then he screams and he throws his wings back and forth and rejoices because he knows he's going to get new feathers he knows he's going to eat his vitamins again he's going to refresh he's going to renew his Youth and I thought what a wonderful thing that is for the eagle oh but I know a rock a man that can come in and be and be until all the doubt is gone he said until the worries and until the cares of Life are gone and to beat the crust of Sin from around him until the blood has Sanctified his soul and then eternal life can come in and sure come in he's can get back and let off the pressure because eternal life is sure saints of God when you got crushed in your eyes let me tell you about a man named Jesus Christ oh he can beat the crust off of your eyes oh he can beat the sin it says he can beat the muck he can beat all that nonsense out of you he can beat the doubt he says there's mountains of doubt he can beat it off in your life Oh Glory to God and he can take you back and you can renew your youth again oh sometimes after a situation after a trial after a circumstance God knows what you went through so what did he do he takes you up high he gets you to beat off that crust that he renews your youth glory to God hallelujah thanks be to God until the blood of Jesus Christ can come in into that Soul he says God thanks be to God it's the grace of God in these examples and in our life you know we're I'm not nobody special we're not nobody special but it's the grace of almighty God in our life that placed a seed and through the process of this life he ordained us to something greater I don't know why he chose me oh but I'm thankful he did I don't know why I look at myself I don't know why oh but thanks be to God amen you know to see how how Rebecca she had lived in a foreign place it was just an ordinary girl living an ordinary life yet one day at the well that she would often visit one day it was the same well she had always gone to came a messenger and she recognized that his message was something that resonated in her heart glory to God and she followed the testimony of that messenger all the way back to her future husband Hallelujah to Bear a son by the name of Jacob amen who would later be called Israel after he submitted his life to God so he could bear a son named Joseph so Joseph could be a perfect type of Christ then and Jacob had a son named Judah and our precious Lord Jesus was the lion of the tribe of Judah Hallelujah thanks be to God I love how all these scripture ties together so perfectly amen God had this un unconditional Covenant it was the grace of God all the time he says you know you are in that Galatians your Christ your your you are Christ's Heirs of that promise and I I think just if just for a moment we can forget about everything else you know Jacob had all of his Affairs to tend to you know in the start of that chapter when he was walking you know he he had a plan amen he had he had a situ in his life he was he was on a mission to go back you know and his brother was there he hadn't seen his brother in a long time the last time he saw his brother was when he fled for his life amen and and so and and so he had all these things no doubt going on in his mind he had a lot of situations amen we've got a lot of situations I know I get it we have work we have we have school we have these situations but can you just for a moment stop all those things and get alone with God and allow him to come in and saturate your mind saturate your spirit for a minute and just let him change you let him change you I know yeah I believe that you've all had an experience with God but tonight could be a fresh experience tonight can be something where you can tangibly grab a hold of Amen you know this was just a pit stop for Jacob and we read that in the text but it was possibly the most important pit stop in his entire life anything that ever happened until and and he wasn't going to leave that place until God had blessed him I believe it's sometimes in those in those things when we're presented with a choice that God wants us to step out in faith and walk towards his promise I think it was in the quote of the day today brother Brandon would say you know as a as a prophet you'd think that God gives me all the direction everything but he says a lot of times he leaves me where I just need to walk by faith I have to I have to really trust God I have to really pray I have to you know he's he's not telling me where I need to go so I have to really consecrate ourselves sometimes you get into that situation God is looking for you to take a step of Faith towards the word take a step of Faith towards whatever it is that you that you need in your life take a step of Faith toward it amen had she waited you know maybe her family would have tried to persuade her differently or maybe the devil would have offered some alternative no doubt that probably would have happened but she trusted the word of that messenger and was rewarded greatly and I just I just want you to just as just a me you don't let the the cares of Life distract you not just now not just tonight but don't let the cares of Life distract you from getting an experience every morning every day and I know sometimes it's really hard to to get up in the morning I know I know it sometimes just it's hard to do that but allow God to change you a little bit more every day day every single day amen don't let the devil keep you so focused on the natural things I am probably worst of all I get focused on the natural things and this and paying this and and going here and and getting that and I just get too hyper focused we get that way but just stop for a second and say God created me to be in His image and I'm going to trust him for all of it amen don't miss the most important Pit Stop you know in in in Gideon's life 10,000 soldiers had remained but God had predes had predestinate a few he foresaw that it was going to be just a few hundred that he was pulling out of that number you know and I I really believe it doesn't mean that you're not going to struggle at times amen because when Gideon came I love this we're we're coming down to a close in just a few minutes but Gideon had come into a point after God had weaned down his army and it was only 300 men and his eagle eyes had gotten filmed over just like John's had Gideon Gideon was afraid this Mighty Man of Valor he was afraid and you know what God did God met him right there he he met him right there just like he did John the Baptist and he said in judges 77 and the Lord said unto Gideon by the 300 men that lapped will I save you and deliver the midianites into thy hand and let all other people go every man unto his place so the people took the victuals in their hands and the trumpets and he sent all the rest of Israel every man un his tent and retained those 300 men and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley and it came to pass that same night that the Lord said unto him arise and go down to the host for I have delivered into hand but verse 10 of Judges 7 if thou fear to go down go thou with pure of thy servant down to the host and catch this he says now and thou shalt hear what they say and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go unto the host so then he went down with Pura his servant under the outside of the Armed men that were in the host and the midianites and the amalik sites and the children of the East lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude and their camels were without number and as the Sand by the seaside for multitude the enemy was out was was without number they were overwhelming I believe you get overwhelmed sometimes in things in your life amen but when Gideon was come behold there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow and said behold I dreamed a dream and low a cake of barley bread tumbled in the host of Midian and came into a tent and smote it that fell and over turned it that the tent lay long and his fellow servants answered and said there is nothing else save the sword of Gideon and the son of joash a man of Israel for into his hand hath God delivered Midian and all the host and it was so when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and the interpretation of that he worshiped and returned to the host of Israel and said arise for the Lord has delivered you delivered into your hand the host of Midian what was God doing there he was giving Gideon insight to his victory he gave him a promise he gave him his word you're going to conquer your foes but he knew that this was a time of great travail for Gideon and his army so he met him right there he knew the Mind battles that Gideon was having so he said if you do fear I give you my word but but if you do fear go ahead and raise up and I'm going to do something Supernatural in your life oh and he sent him down oh saints of God you might not have caught it but this was Supernatural he went down into the host of the enemy's camp and two of the enemy soldiers testified of their defeat one had a dream and one had an interpretation of a dream and a man by the name of Gideon heard that and he heard that that was the Declaration from the Lord God that he was giv him insight to his victory Oh Glory to God you could have insight to your victory tonight he sees every thought he sees every mind battle he sees every trial in your life and he's here tonight to give you insight to your victory he understands your frustrations he identifies with what you're going through I don't care what it is he identifies with what you're going through he knows about it and he's here to give you a helping hand in it Hallelujah you know God does some pretty amazing things for his children he really does never forget the amount of blessings that the Lord Jesus pours about in your life even the things that you don't realize that he does he does a lot in your life amen amen the God we serve is faithful thinks of everything because we're his thoughts amen glory to God let's just stand to our feet this evening bring your team bro and just play whatever's on on your heart I don't have any any songs on my heart tonight so just whatever you feel L I believe that Ephesians 1 that we read about our opening text that this is blueprints you wanted some insight to your victory tonight this is blueprint Victory the earnest of that inheritance that you have the Bible teaches is the Holy Ghost amen it says that he chose you from before the foundation of the the world I want you to I want you to think of not this as just a words on a page this is a love letter that he wrote to you he predestinated you according to his will which made us accepted in the Beloved nothing we did Amen in whom we have Redemption oh thank God for Redemption through his blood something he did for us amen the Forgiveness of all all your sins according to the riches of his grace he made known unto you listen to
