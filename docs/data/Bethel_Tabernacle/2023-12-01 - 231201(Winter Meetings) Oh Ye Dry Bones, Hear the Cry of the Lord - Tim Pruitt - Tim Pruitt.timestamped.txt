[34:55] going on so um see F to kep them keep
[34:58] them in so just remember of them in
[35:01] prayer if you'll turn with me to Ezekiel
[35:03] CH
[35:04] 37 I want to read from verse one amen
[35:09] Ezekiel 37
[35:11] verse1 the hand of the Lord was upon me
[35:15] and carried me out in the spirit of the
[35:18] Lord and set me down in the midst of the
[35:21] valley which was full of Bones and
[35:24] caused me to pass by them round about
[35:27] and behold there were very many in the
[35:30] open Valley and lo they were very
[35:34] dry and he said unto me son of man can
[35:37] these bones live and I answered oh Lord
[35:40] thou knowest and again he said unto me
[35:43] prophesy upon these bones and say unto
[35:45] them oh ye dried bones hear the word of
[35:48] the Lord thus saith the Lord God un
[35:51] these bones behold I will cause breath
[35:55] to enter into you and you shall live and
[35:58] I will lay senu upon you and will bring
[36:02] up flesh upon you and cover you with
[36:04] skin and put breath in you and you shall
[36:07] live and you shall know that I am the
[36:10] Lord so I prophesied as I was commanded
[36:14] and as I prophesied there was a noise
[36:16] and beholding a shaking and the bones
[36:19] came together bone to his bone and when
[36:22] I beheld L the news and the flesh Came
[36:26] Upon them and the skin covered them
[36:29] above but there was no breath in them
[36:32] and he then he said unto me prophesy
[36:34] unto the wind prophesy son of man and
[36:37] say to the wind thus said the Lord come
[36:40] from the Four Winds o breath and breathe
[36:43] upon these slain that they may live so I
[36:46] prophesied as he commanded me and the
[36:49] breath came into them and they lived and
[36:51] stood up upon their feet an exceeding
[36:54] great Army amen amen godess you you can
[36:57] be
[36:58] seated
[37:00] amen my it's uh great to be here back
[37:04] here in Buford again and amen have this
[37:07] time of Fellowship together amen great
[37:11] to see you sister Debbie God bless you
[37:13] we hadn't seen her amen see son she does
[37:17] have favorites she came out to hear me
[37:20] tonight so anyway we're we're glad for
[37:24] that you know that you're recovering and
[37:26] do better we prayed for you amen and we
[37:30] know that the Lord is a provider for
[37:32] every need that we have in the body and
[37:36] we thank God for that now tonight I am
[37:39] going to take a text here from these
[37:42] scriptures that we have read and I'm
[37:45] going to speak on all ye Dry Bones hear
[37:50] the word of the
[37:51] Lord and as we look upon the this
[37:55] scripture tonight tonight I I know there
[37:58] are many descriptive words within the
[38:01] Bible that describe the last age in its
[38:04] move of God and what we see in this
[38:07] passage of Ezekiel is the word of the
[38:09] Lord bringing
[38:11] restoration and it looks hopeless as you
[38:15] you read there they were not just bones
[38:18] but they were very dry you know and and
[38:22] in fact when he asked the prophet is
[38:24] asked can these bones live he actually
[38:27] had to refer back to God and say Lord th
[38:30] knowest but you see the word the Lord
[38:34] restores he's a restoring God Amen and
[38:37] God is doing much more than restoring
[38:40] Doctrine in this day although he has
[38:43] certainly um an important part of what
[38:47] God is doing in this last days but God
[38:50] is also restoring
[38:52] homes he is also Healing The Sick So PR
[38:56] for restoring health he is um he's
[38:59] restoring our pouring out the the
[39:02] original outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[39:05] he's restoring a book of Acts Church
[39:08] he's restoring homes and marriages and
[39:11] reuniting families you said well my
[39:14] problem today brother Tim is my job well
[39:17] you know this economy is not too good
[39:19] well you know he is a god who's
[39:21] concerned about every
[39:23] situation well my problem is my Health
[39:26] well God is a restorer of
[39:29] health and it don't even make it a
[39:31] difference if you're age today remember
[39:33] God is a restorer irregardless of age
[39:37] you know it was Abraham who received
[39:40] restored Health when he was a very old
[39:43] man and then God healed Sarah when she
[39:46] was past 90 because God has no limits on
[39:50] him amen and as far you ask is there
[39:54] anything too hard for the Lord
[39:57] now you know God's Prophet would rush to
[40:00] the bedside of a 90-year-old Bill da and
[40:04] see God come on the scene and heal him
[40:07] so that he would live years after that
[40:09] you see there's just no limits on this
[40:13] God no matter how far you have strayed
[40:17] or how de deep down you have gone in sin
[40:20] or what wickedness you have committed
[40:23] this God is a restorer amen no matter
[40:26] how bad off your family is or how far
[40:28] away they stray from God no matter how
[40:31] bad it looks they may be a houseful of
[40:35] infidels unbelievers but this God is a
[40:38] God that can reach further down than
[40:41] what you can look up amen he can bring a
[40:45] restoration when only bones are left
[40:48] because he is a God who said I will
[40:51] restore sayeth the Lord when we think
[40:55] about the the the the restoration of
[40:57] Israel in this day the land was a a very
[41:01] dry and a desolate place it had long
[41:05] went back to thistles and and Briars and
[41:08] its inhabitants had been dispersed
[41:11] throughout the world but the word said I
[41:14] will restore and God looked upon the
[41:17] valley of dry bones and said these bones
[41:21] hear the word of the Lord and the and
[41:23] they will become a great and a mighty
[41:25] Army and and God's word is brought about
[41:28] his
[41:29] restoration until today the nation of
[41:32] Israel is a mighty Army and a thriving
[41:35] Nation yes with great expectation in the
[41:39] hearts of many as they look for the
[41:41] Messiah to come that's right now when
[41:44] you look upon this and you see the
[41:46] natural fulfillment you know if they are
[41:49] being restored so is her spiritual
[41:53] counterpart the bride is reaching her
[41:56] fulfillment even ahead of them because
[41:59] we have to get out of the way before
[42:01] they can receive their Messiah and we
[42:03] are actually Advanced Beyond in
[42:06] restoration we have we have advanced
[42:09] beyond what Israel has and because we
[42:12] have seen the
[42:13] Messiah amen we have come back to the
[42:16] original atonement we have healing in
[42:19] our midst salvation in our midst the the
[42:23] Holy Ghost every part of the outpour of
[42:26] the Holy Ghost is with us in this hour I
[42:29] say what a privileged people we are Amen
[42:32] to have heard the word of the Lord I'm
[42:35] looking upon people today amen that that
[42:39] has HT it that were dry bones that
[42:44] lived many of you sitting right here
[42:46] tonight were dry bones that the word the
[42:50] Lord brought to life dry bones that
[42:53] lived amen and I'm also looking upon on
[42:56] some that are here that are still dry
[42:58] bones amen but the word of the Lord is
[43:01] still going to bring forth and bring to
[43:04] life amen even those who have just been
[43:07] Justified or Sanctified or gathered with
[43:09] the s new and the the flesh has come
[43:12] upon them but there today is the wind of
[43:15] the Holy Ghost that is coming from Glory

[43:45] matter who they are amen this word can
[43:48] find them he will find every
[43:51] predestinated seed he will not leave one
[43:54] of his behind
[43:56] that's amen amen it don't matter how far
[44:00] they've strayed that's right and look
[44:01] like they've turned down their day of
[44:03] grace and the mercy that was given to
[44:05] them this is a god of not just Second
[44:08] Chances but third chances and fourth
[44:11] chances and F Chan this is a God who

[46:07] on amen that's a truth now another of
[46:11] these descripted words promis and
[46:14] restoration is the latter rain the
[46:17] latter rain brings to harvest all the
[46:21] seeds since
[46:22] Genesis and it is here that seeds are
[46:25] are sown by both sers and they will both
[46:30] come to maturity the tear and the wheat
[46:33] will both come to maturity in this age
[46:35] because of the outpouring of the latter
[46:38] rain he tells us in Hosea 6 and one what
[46:43] he will do in Israel as a natural nation
[46:46] and as upon the bride as a spiritual
[46:49] Nation So reading from Hosea 6:1 he says
[46:52] come and let us return to the Lord for
[46:55] he torn and he will heal us he has
[46:58] smitten and he will bind us up after two
[47:01] days he will revive us and in the third
[47:04] day he will raise us up and we shall
[47:07] live in his
[47:08] sight amen now from hosea's time a
[47:12] prophecy that that now Israel is is well
[47:17] into the third day in other words it's
[47:18] been 2500 years or more since Hosea
[47:22] spoke these words you know a thousand
[47:25] years be a day and in the third day they
[47:27] have they have compassed 2,000 years and
[47:30] now they're here where as Hosea has
[47:33] prophesied after two days he will revive
[47:36] us in the third day he will raise us up
[47:40] and we shall live in his sight amen then
[47:43] we shall know if we follow on if if with
[47:47] we with seal go on to know the Lord that
[47:51] his going forth is prepared as the
[47:54] morning and he shall come unto us as the
[47:58] rain and as a latter and former rain
[48:01] upon the Earth notice how he says he
[48:05] will come yes as unto us as the rain as
[48:09] the latter and former rain up on the
[48:13] earth now brother bam tells us in spoken
[48:17] words Original Seed he said what's the
[48:19] matter now she's waiting for the latter
[48:21] rain now he's right here on the cusp of
[48:24] the Mysteries of the seven seals being
[48:26] open and the latter rain to fall and
[48:30] that he says now she's waiting for the
[48:32] latter rain that's when she produces her
[48:35] fruits I hope you get her then the kind
[48:38] of seed you have planted in your field
[48:41] will be the kind of crop you will reap
[48:44] if the denominations wants more members
[48:46] are going to get it that's what they've
[48:48] gotten Pentecost once more Pentecostals
[48:51] that's what they're going to get right
[48:53] but the word is going to produc Sons and
[48:56] Daughters of
[48:57] God Amen watch look at that great latter
[49:01] rain that's supposed to be done how they
[49:03] would run over the wall and leap over
[49:06] and how there would be an army coming
[49:08] amen just wait a minute the kind of crop
[49:11] you'll get is the kind of seed you put
[49:13] in your
[49:14] field so aren't you glad that the son of
[49:17] man went forth in this day sewing
[49:21] seed so that there could be Sons and
[49:24] Daughters of God God in this age that
[49:27] would be sons of the word offspring of
[49:29] the word not offspring of denomination
[49:32] but a word Offspring amen this latter
[49:36] rain or this outpouring here in the
[49:38] seventh age is an outpouring of the
[49:41] spirit amen that has brought back sons
[49:44] of God back to the promised land of the
[49:48] Bible they are return with wave after
[49:51] wave after wave and they are taking the
[49:55] land and the dry bones are coming to
[49:58] life until ultimately the dry bones of
[50:02] the Saints of The Seven Ages also Will
[50:04] Rise by the word of this prophecy amen
[50:09] son of man can these bones live the
[50:13] instruction comes
[50:15] speak
[50:17] prophesy and prophesy again yes amen
[50:22] there's a principle I want you to get
[50:24] from the words of Jesus that I'm going
[50:27] to look at um here a a principle Matthew
[50:30] chap 11 and verse 12 maybe you can turn
[50:33] in your Bible or they can put it on the
[50:34] screen Matthew 11:12 for and from the
[50:38] days of John the Baptist until now the
[50:42] Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence in
[50:46] other words used
[50:49] force and the violent or the strong take
[50:52] it by
[50:54] force now notice it's a principle that I
[50:58] I want to get to you because you cannot
[51:02] be lukewarm about this right you cannot
[51:05] be complacent every man every woman
[51:09] every boy every girl has to put on the
[51:12] armor and fight in this battle this is a
[51:16] battle for our
[51:19] lives even in service today is not just
[51:23] the preacher that has to bring has to
[51:26] bring the word you got to help me
[51:29] preach amen you got to respond you got
[51:32] to do your part you have to create an
[51:35] atmosphere around you so so that someone
[51:38] next to you will start believing and and
[51:41] be able to receive something from God so
[51:45] from the days of John the Baptist until
[51:48] now the Kingdom of Heaven suffered
[51:50] violence are used to force and the
[51:53] violent the strong take it by force you
[51:57] see there are things you must do there
[52:01] are parts that you must play in
[52:04] this God wants you to participate in his
[52:09] work this is not a denominational
[52:11] meeting where you just are a spectator
[52:15] and come and just to be entertained for
[52:18] a little bit you're here to to
[52:22] participate in his work he said to like
[52:26] to those little women there Mary and
[52:29] Martha roll away the stone amen he could
[52:32] have spoke that word and broke that
[52:34] stone into a million slivers but he
[52:36] didn't he called for weak Little Women
[52:39] to step up and roll away the stone and
[52:43] when they did their part god did his
[52:45] part amen you've got a part to do also
[52:49] you must stand there and speak the word
[52:52] and prophesy and prophesy
[52:56] [Applause]
[52:57] again now some of the translators say
[53:00] this is one of the most difficult
[53:02] passages of scripture to to translate
[53:05] because the uh the words used in Greek
[53:07] they had to translate them back to
[53:09] Hebrew and then and then to English to
[53:11] get the meaning from them because it was
[53:13] so difficult to translate and this is
[53:16] the translation they came up with from
[53:19] the moment John stepped onto the scene
[53:23] until now the realm of Heaven's kingdom
[53:27] is bursting forth and passionate people
[53:31] have taken hold of its
[53:35] PowerAll amen so from the moment John
[53:39] stepped on the scene until now the realm
[53:42] of Heaven's kingdom is bursting forth
[53:45] and passionate people have taken hold of
[53:48] its
[53:49] power and I just want to say from the
[53:52] days of our Forerunner our John the
[53:54] bapti
[53:56] amen this Elijah he has used force and
[53:59] even now we must use
[54:02] Force the realm of Heaven's Kingdom
[54:05] bursted open under that Ministry and
[54:07] those that are passionate have taken
[54:10] hold of its power amen I I hope there's
[54:13] someone here tonight that has a passion
[54:15] that has a drive that has a Zeal a
[54:19] zealousness for this
[54:21] message amen young people old people
[54:24] didn't matter what age you are married
[54:26] whatever single it that matter of
[54:29] zealousness yes yes people who won't
[54:33] quit who won't stop who won't back up
[54:37] who won't Retreat amen who will not give
[54:40] up the land Who Won't Give Up on a
[54:42] promise of God Amen but one that will
[54:45] take it by force stand Toe to Toe with
[54:48] the devil and say give it

[55:15] Forerunner how many believes that we've
[55:17] had a John the Baptist am amen this
[55:20] Elijah from the days of this Elijah he
[55:23] used Force and we must use
[55:27] Force demons fell by
[55:31] force the maniac fell by force it was
[55:36] not William Brandon but it was the man
[55:39] that that the maniac was contesting it
[55:41] was God's word the devil had contested
[55:45] and it's not you that the enemy has come
[55:47] again it's the word that he come against
[55:50] and this battle is not that you are in
[55:53] is not your battle it's the Lord's
[55:56] battle amen and it's not a flesh and
[55:59] blood battle it's a spiritual
[56:02] [Applause]
[56:06] battle blind eyes and deaf ears came
[56:09] open by
[56:11] force you know it wasn't too long ago I

[56:28] testimony that came out of there where
[56:30] brother brandham was there preaching in
[56:33] a Little Rock and they took him to that
[56:35] to that Death School and not just a few
[56:38] not just one or two but

[57:09] wrestle it from God but the lamb had
[57:12] been in battle for this book The Lamb
[57:15] got all bloody by doing it amen he
[57:19] wrestled the inheritance from the grip
[57:21] of Satan's claim and he claimed the book
[57:25] for
[57:27] us and now passionate people have taken
[57:30] a hold of his power I'm going to tell
[57:32] you what we are armed with a powerful
[57:34] word
[57:36] tonight yes the sword of the king is
[57:39] back in the hands of men amen amen amen

[58:17] commandments that was Israel getting Ten
[58:20] Commandments and as brother bradam
[58:23] received the king's sword that was the
[58:25] receiving the king's sword and it's back
[58:27] in the hands of man again the power of
[58:30] the word is in your mouth for the way
[58:34] you handle a sword is by the
[58:37] mouth amen but how did those bones live
[58:40] they live by the word the Lord spoken by
[58:42] the mouth of a
[58:45] man that's the way dead bones live
[58:48] that's how they come to life yes now

[1:03:00] Paul's gospel with the same word and the
[1:03:03] same power amen you know when when that
[1:03:07] happened with brother brandom that
[1:03:09] caused waves after waves of Glory when
[1:03:11] the angel appeared to him many he got
[1:03:13] swept up and moved moved by the power of
[1:03:15] God it just didn't just affect brother
[1:03:17] brandom it affected other Ministries as
[1:03:20] well oh yeah you see the wave of God is
[1:03:24] not just about a prophet that's right
[1:03:26] although that is very much involved it's
[1:03:29] a very integral important part of it an
[1:03:33] angel of God came to the prophet an
[1:03:35] angel of God came to you as
[1:03:37] well yes so there was wave after wave
[1:03:42] after wave as the Holy Ghost be to be
[1:03:44] poured out and it would be poured out
[1:03:47] upon such men not not only brother
[1:03:50] brandom but there would be others like
[1:03:52] that would try to pick up and and and
[1:03:55] ride on the wave of that outpour men
[1:03:57] like Jack Cole and or
[1:04:00] Roberts am man and and they would ride
[1:04:04] on the wave of that outpouring I'm I'm
[1:04:06] what I'm trying to tell you is that you
[1:04:09] also must ride on the wave of that
[1:04:14] [Applause]
[1:04:15] outpouring amen now Jack Co was an
[1:04:18] assembly God preacher he had attended uh
[1:04:22] some of brother B Bron's meeting he had
[1:04:24] some doubt in his heart he didn't
[1:04:26] believe what he was seeing was
[1:04:28] real he spoke about how he was in a
[1:04:30] meeting and he watched brother Bram
[1:04:32] prayed for a blind man and brother
[1:04:35] bradam told him that he was healed but
[1:04:38] because he had no eyeballs it would take
[1:04:41] three days for them to form but in three
[1:04:44] days he would be able to see and Jack
[1:04:47] Cole thought ah anybody can say that you
[1:04:50] know the blind man will leave and go
[1:04:51] home nobody ever know that he whether he
[1:04:53] received his healing or not anybody can
[1:04:55] say that and his brother bradam leaves a
[1:04:58] platform he stops and speaks to Jack and
[1:05:01] says what are you so skeptical
[1:05:03] about you're a preacher yourself you're
[1:05:07] sick too but you're sickness because you
[1:05:09] run down from so many Revival meetings
[1:05:11] but don't be skeptical about this God's
[1:05:14] got a work for you to do too well Jack
[1:05:17] was was thrilled by those words but he
[1:05:20] waited three days for that blind man for
[1:05:23] the blind man before he was convinced
[1:05:25] sure enough on the third day eyeballs
[1:05:27] had formed in the man's head and by
[1:05:31] evening he could see as good as anybody
[1:05:34] Hallelujah and that so inspired him that
[1:05:37] he got under that anointing and begin to
[1:05:40] believe God and rode on the wave of
[1:05:44] Divine
[1:05:45] Healing these men would tap into
[1:05:49] Heaven's
[1:05:50] outpouring amen they knew you could sit
[1:05:52] though right under the flow of the
[1:05:53] spirit right in the spout where the
[1:05:55] glory was coming out and miss
[1:05:58] it because of unbelief or unconfessed
[1:06:03] sins yes Jack had to be stirred from his
[1:06:07] unbelief in order to start believing
[1:06:10] once he started believing then the power
[1:06:12] began to work for him and healing
[1:06:15] Miracles started to take place and then
[1:06:17] he too would ride on that Divine Healing
[1:06:20] wave you said well brother Tim I don't
[1:06:23] have any unconfessed sins I'm not a
[1:06:25] sinner or maybe you didn't go out and
[1:06:27] rob a
[1:06:29] bank maybe you hadn't murdered somebody
[1:06:32] but every one of us deal with a measure
[1:06:34] of unbelief in our
[1:06:37] heart you got to come passionate about
[1:06:40] what you have amen and when you come to
[1:06:43] the house of God get rid of your
[1:06:46] unbelief and these men knew you could
[1:06:48] not W ride on this wave with unbelief
[1:06:52] and unconfessed sins in your life
[1:06:56] amen Jack would say and give testimony
[1:07:00] about this and and maybe this will give
[1:07:02] you a key to some of to some of you for
[1:07:04] your healing he said you just can't let
[1:07:07] Envy malice and strife come in your
[1:07:09] heart and that thing will rob you from
[1:07:12] the thing that God has for you it will
[1:07:15] take the blessings of God right out of
[1:07:17] your
[1:07:19] life know you can have every kind of all
[1:07:21] kinds of things I don't know what your
[1:07:24] hang up is you can have a spirit of
[1:07:26] possessiveness that you possess your
[1:07:29] wife and your kids and you hold them
[1:07:31] under bondage or some kind of spirit of
[1:07:34] jealousy or envy and that evil spirit
[1:07:37] will keep you from the glory of God as
[1:07:39] it comes to the
[1:07:42] church maybe maybe some of these things
[1:07:44] aren't outward sins but they're inward
[1:07:46] hidden things there are things that we
[1:07:49] wrestle with because of our flesh when
[1:07:52] you come in the presence of God you want
[1:07:54] to examine Yourself clean yourself up in
[1:07:57] his presence and let him deal with your
[1:08:00] unbelief in your life yes that's the
[1:08:03] trth so Jack said you can let envy and
[1:08:05] Malice and strife come in your heart and
[1:08:07] that thing will rob you from the thing
[1:08:09] God has from you will take the blessings
[1:08:11] of God right out of your
[1:08:14] life and he and he tells he said how
[1:08:17] much have I heard this in the healing
[1:08:19] line that people say I I don't
[1:08:21] understand sister so and so uh don't get
[1:08:24] healed and then and if she doesn't get
[1:08:27] healed well then nobody get healed
[1:08:29] because she's a saint of God well how do
[1:08:32] you know he is he
[1:08:33] asked maybe man looks on the hour ped
[1:08:36] but God looks on the heart you don't
[1:08:38] know what sister so and so's got in her
[1:08:42] heart quit judging yourselves by by
[1:08:45] yourselves judge yourself by him the
[1:08:47] perfect one you've heard it hundreds of
[1:08:49] time their sister so and so and she's an
[1:08:51] invalid she doesn't get healed nobody
[1:08:54] get healed I can't go by sister so and
[1:08:57] so there's only one thing I can go by
[1:08:59] and that's this book that he's promis to
[1:09:02] heal all of my diseases take away all my
[1:09:05] iniquities he said a host of angels
[1:09:08] encamp around those that fear the lord
[1:09:10] he didn't tell me to pattern my life
[1:09:12] after sister so and so he told me to
[1:09:14] pattern my life after him said be you
[1:09:17] therefore perfect as I'm perfect
[1:09:19] somebody said brother Co do you believe
[1:09:21] you can reach Perfection yes and you can
[1:09:24] reach Perfection you don't even know
[1:09:26] your own wife's heart because you look
[1:09:29] at her faults all her shortcoming you
[1:09:31] don't know your own husband's heart you
[1:09:34] don't know the thoughts that run through
[1:09:36] his mind what right do you have to stand
[1:09:38] up and say if God don't heal him then
[1:09:40] nobody will get
[1:09:41] healed then he then he tells how he was
[1:09:44] at a meeting down in Texas one time and
[1:09:48] on the way home a Pastor said I I just
[1:09:51] don't understand you know you prayed for
[1:09:53] a woman tonight in the church she is the
[1:09:57] worst drunkard in this town and
[1:10:00] everybody knows she's a habitual
[1:10:02] drunkard and she sat down the Altar and
[1:10:05] gave her heart to God and you prayed for
[1:10:06] that after that and she dropped her
[1:10:08] crutches and went all over the building
[1:10:11] praising godall now tell me why God will
[1:10:14] heal somebody like that when there's a
[1:10:17] sister in my church with a Waterhead
[1:10:19] baby and she's a Deacon's wife and they
[1:10:21] pay their tithe and they come to church
[1:10:23] and there's not a more Godly couple in
[1:10:25] the world than that couple why is it
[1:10:27] that God don't heal that baby and I said
[1:10:30] to the pastor I said look I don't know
[1:10:31] her
[1:10:33] life he said but I do he said no you
[1:10:36] don't oh yes I do he said she's the only
[1:10:38] woman he's the only man that I can put
[1:10:40] uttermost confidence in my church and
[1:10:43] look what they have to go through
[1:10:44] carrying that Waterhead baby at 8 years
[1:10:46] old and can't walk and great big head
[1:10:49] and little bitty body and that child
[1:10:52] cries all hours of the T night that
[1:10:54] mother has to be up with it now you tell
[1:10:56] me why God won't heal that baby so I
[1:10:59] don't know her heart you don't either oh
[1:11:01] yes I do so he said they said no more
[1:11:03] about it but the next morning in the
[1:11:05] prayer line the spirit of God got to
[1:11:07] moving and the sister stood on her feet
[1:11:10] with tears rolling down her cheeks and
[1:11:12] said I've missed God said I I have
[1:11:16] murmured and complained because God gave
[1:11:19] me a Waterhead baby you see a lot of
[1:11:23] times people murmur and complain against
[1:11:26] God because of the grab bag of
[1:11:30] Life maybe you lost your wife or your
[1:11:33] husband or or you've been through a
[1:11:35] divorce or maybe somebody did something
[1:11:37] to you that was wrong or or the church
[1:11:39] failed you or the pastor didn't come to
[1:11:41] see you when you thought he should
[1:11:44] have and you developed a bitterness in
[1:11:47] your
[1:11:47] heart you know you see you've got to
[1:11:51] deal with sin no matter what it is if
[1:11:54] you want the blessings of
[1:11:56] God Amen that sin will keep you from the
[1:12:00] house of God keep you from The
[1:12:02] Fellowship of
[1:12:04] Believers amen it'll keep you from the
[1:12:06] presence of almighty God and the
[1:12:08] blessings that should follow and should
[1:12:11] flow your over your life I know what
[1:12:14] bitterness will do Amen brother amen
[1:12:16] bitterness and a heart turned against
[1:12:19] God happened to a lady because she
[1:12:22] couldn't have a baby and she held it in
[1:12:25] her heart until it continued to grow and
[1:12:27] it drove her
[1:12:28] insane she took her life that's what
[1:12:30] bitterness will do you got to deal with
[1:12:33] sin no matter what form is in if you
[1:12:37] want to ride on the wave of God's glory
[1:12:39] if you want the benefit of his healing
[1:12:41] power if you want to see God move for
[1:12:44] your family if you want God's blessings
[1:12:46] on your life you got to deal with sin no
[1:12:49] matter where it comes from what form
[1:12:52] it's in that's it might come from the
[1:12:55] gossip of somebody else who had
[1:12:57] bitterness in their own heart against
[1:12:59] the church or against the pastor as to
[1:13:02] why you don't attend church yourself and
[1:13:05] the reason why you don't have any
[1:13:07] confidence in the ministry but it's
[1:13:09] sin yes could be bitterness against a
[1:13:13] parent oh yes maybe a broken home or
[1:13:16] maybe you were sexually abused but it
[1:13:20] hindered you and it bound you from
[1:13:22] moving on with God and even receiving
[1:13:25] the Holy Ghost and being a Christian
[1:13:28] that you know you ought to be and and
[1:13:29] then that bitterness begins that root of
[1:13:32] bitterness begins to defile many oh yes
[1:13:36] oh yes it'll work right quietly right in
[1:13:39] your home and it'll defile your kids and
[1:13:41] there'll be an attitude in the home
[1:13:43] against God and then you wonder why they
[1:13:46] straight away uh-huh I tell you right
[1:13:49] now if I were you and I wanted to ride
[1:13:51] on this wave of the glory of God I would
[1:13:53] start right now saying God Purge
[1:13:55] me Lord I would start right now saying
[1:13:58] let the blood cover me Lord amen wash
[1:14:01] away this unbelief this doubting this
[1:14:03] criticism in my life let me be pure
[1:14:06] before you yes Lord because only the
[1:14:09] pure and heart shall see God you want to
[1:14:12] see God tonight you want to see God in
[1:14:14] these meetings amen only the pure and
[1:14:17] heart so sanctify your life yes
[1:14:20] Lord It's Time let the blood flow over
[1:14:24] and this pastor told Jack said well I
[1:14:27] don't know a more saintly couple than
[1:14:29] this woman and her husband with the
[1:14:31] Waterhead baby he's my he's a deacon in
[1:14:34] my church and they pay their tithe
[1:14:36] Faithfully they've stood by me in
[1:14:39] difficult times but here this next
[1:14:41] morning she stands up and says I have
[1:14:44] missed God I have murmured and complain
[1:14:48] because God gave me a Waterhead baby let
[1:14:51] me just correct a little something here
[1:14:53] first of all God doesn't send
[1:14:56] sickness sickness is of the devil God
[1:15:00] didn't cause your children to
[1:15:02] stray Satan did that God didn't cause
[1:15:06] you to be born in a dysfunctional family
[1:15:09] you can't blame God for what your
[1:15:11] circumstances of Life are you got to
[1:15:14] realize that this we are living in is
[1:15:17] not the Millennium it's a world of sin
[1:15:20] and unbelief and doubting and fear and
[1:15:22] dark
[1:15:24] amen unfortunately we weren't born none
[1:15:26] of us in God's Eden this ain't the
[1:15:29] Millennium that's right you were born in
[1:15:32] Satan's Eden and you got to overcome
[1:15:35] it amen and God has confidence in every
[1:15:39] predestinated seed that matters not what
[1:15:42] circumstance or situation they brought
[1:15:44] up been brought up under they're going
[1:15:46] to come through anyway like that woman
[1:15:49] at the well the Devil Couldn't do enough
[1:15:52] to stop a predestinated seed because
[1:15:55] there was a Divine appointment for her
[1:15:58] life am Hallelujah it would cause Jesus
[1:16:01] to go out of his way by Samaria yes and
[1:16:05] wait on her to come that's right send
[1:16:08] his disciples
[1:16:09] away brother Brandon said about it said
[1:16:12] she probably wasn't a bad girl she's
[1:16:14] probably sold by her father for monetary
[1:16:18] reasons started out with that kind of
[1:16:20] life but you see no matter what the
[1:16:24] devil can't hide a predestinated seed
[1:16:27] from his
[1:16:28] God he came to seek and to save that
[1:16:31] which is lost he's here today to uncover
[1:16:35] the mud and the Darkness of your life so
[1:16:38] that you can ride on the wave of God's
[1:16:41] glory this woman said I blam God in my
[1:16:44] heart nobody ever knew this the pastor
[1:16:47] didn't know it my husband didn't know it
[1:16:50] I've been bitter against God I found
[1:16:53] fult with the pastor now here it comes
[1:16:55] out and she said brother I want to ask
[1:16:57] you to forgive me in my heart I
[1:16:59] criticize you cuz you did not pray the
[1:17:02] prayer of faith to make my baby
[1:17:05] well I'm pretty sure the man had prayed
[1:17:08] many prayer of faith but because of
[1:17:10] unconfessed sin in her life she could
[1:17:12] not receive that blessing she was asking
[1:17:15] for faith comes by the by the person who
[1:17:19] has been prayed for it is the man that
[1:17:21] healed you or even in his faith that
[1:17:24] healed you it's your faith in Touching
[1:17:27] God through that man's prayer you got to
[1:17:32] believe
[1:17:34] amen and she said at home I've
[1:17:36] criticized everybody in this church in
[1:17:38] my heart not outwardly in my but in my
[1:17:42] heart here's here's the reason I wasn't
[1:17:45] healed such and such in the church this
[1:17:47] is the reason why you know my kids went
[1:17:50] astray such and such in the church the
[1:17:52] pastor this this that and he said down
[1:17:54] on the inside of me he said I've been
[1:17:57] one of the most bitter people that ever
[1:18:00] was and this morning I prayed through
[1:18:03] and said if God never heals my baby

[1:32:45] gospel is here by the opening of The
[1:32:48] Seven Seals it is returned to us back to
[1:32:51] the very gospel that Paul
[1:32:53] preached Pentecost could not preach that
[1:32:56] ausa street failed Amen brother BR would
[1:33:00] tell them in their 50th Jubilee why pen
[1:33:03] why I think Pentecost fell it's because
[1:33:05] they didn't go far enough with God they
[1:33:08] stopped with speaking in tongues and
[1:33:09] didn't press on amen amen even in your
[1:33:13] life with just revealing the mystery
[1:33:15] amen even in your walk Christ has to be
[1:33:18] made real to you yes
[1:33:22] you say well I I know predestination and
[1:33:25] serpent seed and I can out debate the
[1:33:27] best but I want you to know this I want
[1:33:30] to ask this do you know Jesus that's it
[1:33:32] that's it do you really know Jesus do
[1:33:35] you know the power of his resurrection
[1:33:37] do you know the quickening power of the
[1:33:39] life of God that will Quicken your
[1:33:41] mortal body and make it subject to the
[1:33:43] word of God that will cause you to live
[1:33:46] an overcoming life it's it's not knowing
[1:33:48] his Doctrine it's life it's knowing him
[1:33:50] that is life
[1:33:52] Pentecost sought the gift and not the
[1:33:54] giver and we received the gift of the
[1:33:57] word and many have got the form of the
[1:33:59] letter but left the spirit far behind
[1:34:02] amen that's the truth what will the full
[1:34:05] word do it brings a people to full age
[1:34:08] yes to maturity yes Hebrews 5:13 says
[1:34:13] for everyone that uses milk is
[1:34:15] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[1:34:17] for he is obeyed that means he is
[1:34:19] unskillful he's inexperienced right you
[1:34:23] know prior ages drank the milk of the
[1:34:27] word in the age of justification that
[1:34:30] was a word but it was just
[1:34:32] milk Wesley still milk sanctification
[1:34:37] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[1:34:39] ausa Street drank the milk of emotion
[1:34:42] and gifts and that excited the human
[1:34:45] spirit and its emotions but it was still
[1:34:49] milk yes amen but verse 14 of Hebrews 5
[1:34:53] said but strong meat remember the strong
[1:34:55] take it by force amen but strong meat
[1:34:59] belonging to them that are full age even
[1:35:02] those who by reason of use have their
[1:35:04] senses exercised or their perception
[1:35:08] invigorated to discern both good and
[1:35:13] evil full age yes there's a people
[1:35:16] coming to full age that's why this is
[1:35:19] called the bright age it's the marriage
[1:35:22] age it's the time of marriage it's the
[1:35:25] Rapture age it's the climax it's the
[1:35:27] grain age it's the hardest time is a you
[1:35:31] see it's the age that goes into the
[1:35:32] Garner
[1:35:34] yes truth brother full
[1:35:37] age see the Bible said in 1 Corinthians
[1:35:41] 13:10 but when that which is perfect has
[1:35:43] come and the the word perfect here is
[1:35:47] full age amen when the word comes to its
[1:35:51] fullness
[1:35:52] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:35:54] away with now let me just
[1:35:58] say then having just
[1:36:02] part is done away with because when you
[1:36:07] have the fullness you have it all amen
[1:36:12] yes amen that's it come on yes want to
[1:36:15] go back over that again the word perfect
[1:36:17] here is full age when the word comes to
[1:36:19] its fullness then that which is in part
[1:36:23] is done away with so then just having
[1:36:25] part is done away with because when you
[1:36:28] have the fullness you have it all yes
[1:36:33] amen amen now of course we've used that
[1:36:36] scripture to do away with emotion or
[1:36:38] gifts of the Spirit today we don't want
[1:36:41] tongues or gifts of the Spirit we don't
[1:36:43] want emotion you know yeah so they don't
[1:36:45] deny justification but they've but but
[1:36:48] they've even reduced sanctification just
[1:36:51] except accepting a bunch of rules it's
[1:36:52] just a
[1:36:53] law they're afraid they might get a
[1:36:55] little emotional or something you say
[1:36:58] well that's because we're growing up
[1:37:00] brother Jim we're full age because we're
[1:37:02] mature now this this jumping up and down
[1:37:04] and trying to speak in tongues is over
[1:37:06] with and I
[1:37:07] agree I agree jumping up and down like a
[1:37:11] kid and trying to speak with tongues is
[1:37:12] over
[1:37:13] with it's not the evidence of a spirit
[1:37:16] filled life it's not what we're seeking
[1:37:19] after we're not trying to speak with
[1:37:22] tongues that's all over with the full
[1:37:25] word has come in a manifestation and
[1:37:28] with the full word all of
[1:37:31] it all of it is here amen and if you
[1:37:37] ever get born of the word you will be a
[1:37:40] tongue speaking acts 238 screaming
[1:37:43] yelling younging because that's the only
[1:37:45] kind the word can bring
[1:37:47] [Applause]
[1:37:49] forth amen Hallelujah so when I was a
[1:37:52] child I spoke as a child we had
[1:37:54] childishness in ages past I understood
[1:37:57] as a child and that's true they didn't
[1:37:59] have full understanding I thought as a
[1:38:02] child but when I become a man I put away
[1:38:05] childish things let me give you an
[1:38:06] example right I read a I read a a book
[1:38:10] of one of the Pentecostal fathers um
[1:38:13] from isusa Street John G Lake many of
[1:38:16] you may have heard of him he was he died
[1:38:18] in the 1930s he was called an apostle
[1:38:20] disci South Africa he was a great man of
[1:38:23] Faith but he understood as a child when
[1:38:26] the spirit broke forth in a camp meeting
[1:38:28] in
[1:38:29] 1916 spiritual fire broke out there was
[1:38:33] a man that was up during the night
[1:38:35] reading his Bible and he saw that the
[1:38:37] apostles baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:38:39] Christ and and then they turned to
[1:38:41] another place and saw they were B
[1:38:43] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:38:45] he read another place everywhere in the
[1:38:48] Bible in the New Testament in the book
[1:38:50] of Acts who were all baptized in the
[1:38:52] name of Jesus Christ and he went running
[1:38:54] through the camp of that bunch of
[1:38:56] trinitarians spreading the word that
[1:38:58] there was one God righten and you were
[1:39:00] to baptize in his name yes of course
[1:39:03] later they made a denomination out of it
[1:39:06] right but John G Lake understood as a
[1:39:09] child and he said now listen to him
[1:39:11] listen to him today there's a lot of
[1:39:14] questions about baptisms and some are
[1:39:16] taking Peter's words in the book of Acts
[1:39:19] but I'd rather believe the words of
[1:39:21] Jesus more than anybody else's words and
[1:39:25] he said to baptize in the name of the
[1:39:27] father and of the and and the Son and
[1:39:30] the Holy Ghost so I'll just take what
[1:39:32] Jesus
[1:39:33] said how could he do that he was a child
[1:39:37] right right amen he was mature in his
[1:39:40] thinking amen he ought to been mature
[1:39:43] enough to know that scripture cannot
[1:39:45] fight scripture and that Peter also had
[1:39:48] the words of
[1:39:50] Jesus
[1:39:51] all right when he said repent every one
[1:39:53] of you and be baptized in the name of
[1:39:55] Jesus Christ for remission of sin and
[1:39:57] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:39:59] Ghost but but John G Lake thought as a
[1:40:02] child and he spoke as a child and when
[1:40:04] he did he spoke foolish things amen we
[1:40:08] don't have to speak foolish
[1:40:10] things we can speak as mature adults as
[1:40:14] a mature church we know that word
[1:40:17] doesn't fight words amen amen scripture
[1:40:20] doesn't fight scriptures quote don't
[1:40:23] fight
[1:40:24] quotes amen that's amen somebody here
[1:40:29] the other day you know I I shared a few
[1:40:31] things and and then and they in turn you
[1:40:33] know you know you know sent a bunch of
[1:40:36] other quotes I said hey I love quotes
[1:40:40] you can't hurt me with
[1:40:43] quotes amen I love every one of them yes
[1:40:47] but they got to be placed correctly yes
[1:40:50] that's the truth amen so you see we know
[1:40:54] that word don't fight word scripture
[1:40:56] don't fight scripture quotes don't fight
[1:40:58] quotes but you must find the continuity
[1:41:01] of it all you just can't build a
[1:41:03] Doctrine on one
[1:41:05] quote
[1:41:08] Amen brother Bram tells us at the
[1:41:11] opening of The Seven Seals Revelation 10
[1:41:13] the full word is to be born into
[1:41:15] manifestation again Vindicated by the
[1:41:17] spirit of God in the full strength as it
[1:41:19] was when he was on the earth manifesting
[1:41:22] the same way doing the same things that
[1:41:24] it did when it was here on the earth
[1:41:26] amen J Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same
[1:41:29] yesterday today and forever Luke 17:30
[1:41:31] in the days as it was and the days of
[1:41:34] Sodom when the son of man be revealed
[1:41:35] himself it be the same thing we are in
[1:41:38] the day when the full word has been
[1:41:42] revealed and that's the wave we are
[1:41:46] riding on yes yes amen well our is not
[1:41:51] on speaking in tongues
[1:41:53] anymore that's right but we can still
[1:41:56] have speaking in
[1:41:58] tongues because it's in the word and
[1:42:01] this is a day when just having part is
[1:42:03] done away with that's
[1:42:07] right are you with me well we don't need
[1:42:10] that brother Tim that's not what Paul
[1:42:12] said he said in 1 Corinthians 145 I
[1:42:15] would that you all spoke with tongues
[1:42:17] but rather that you
[1:42:19] prophesied well we prophecy either well
[1:42:22] that's another
[1:42:23] story so then when he concludes his
[1:42:26] discourse you know when he he says you
[1:42:28] know I I'd rather have you yes gifts are
[1:42:30] wonderful whatever but but without love
[1:42:33] what does it Avail yes and love is a
[1:42:36] very basic element of God it's it's his
[1:42:38] nature so without the nature of God what
[1:42:40] is it if we speak in tongues to prophesy
[1:42:42] or know all the
[1:42:44] Mysteries but when he sums it all up he
[1:42:47] says wherefore brother C to prophesy and
[1:42:51] forbid not to speak in tongues amen amen
[1:42:54] amen well our emphasis brother Tim is
[1:42:57] not on Divine Healing and that Great
[1:42:59] Divine Healing move is over well that
[1:43:02] might be right but as long as we got
[1:43:04] needs in this body we need Divine
[1:43:07] Healing yes sir and it's part of the
[1:43:12] word sure the emphasis is on having the
[1:43:15] fullness of the word but with the full
[1:43:18] word comes the fullness of his power
[1:43:21] that's right so the full word is to be
[1:43:24] born in manifestation again and
[1:43:25] Vindicated by the spirit of God in full
[1:43:28] strength as it was when he was here on
[1:43:31] the
[1:43:32] earth Hallelujah doing the same things
[1:43:36] it did when he was here on the earth you
[1:43:38] see the son of man is revealing himself
[1:43:43] today in bright F that's right that's
[1:43:47] right and the living will not preva vent
[1:43:51] amen this is the only age that will not
[1:43:54] prevent there was other ages that
[1:43:57] prevented from taking the full and
[1:43:59] complete Authority but we are in the
[1:44:01] days of the full age where we take it by
[1:44:06] force Hallelujah now Ephesian AGS lost
[1:44:09] their first love and they were losing
[1:44:11] out that's right I'm talking to people
[1:44:16] today who will have their first
[1:44:19] love yes amen did you hear what I said
[1:44:23] they lost their first love I'm preaching
[1:44:26] to people tonight that will have their
[1:44:29] first love amen amen yes sir amen now
[1:44:34] some of you it's not there but I have a
[1:44:38] promise for you it's being restored amen
[1:44:41] you can have your first love
[1:44:44] again amen you can have a fresh and up
[1:44:47] to-date experience with God again
[1:44:51] yeah absolutely the theasian age lost it
[1:44:53] but you can regain it cuz this is the
[1:44:55] hour of restoration amen like a seed
[1:44:58] that is planted and begins to
[1:45:00] deteriorate and the life changes form
[1:45:03] from seed to sprout and even so Ephesus
[1:45:07] would deteriorate and she loses her
[1:45:09] first love and and by and and then there
[1:45:12] was another reason why they were not
[1:45:13] raptured and then there there were other
[1:45:16] names that were on the book that were
[1:45:18] not yet
[1:45:19] manifested the Earth and one by one the
[1:45:22] early church was laid in the ground they

[1:50:13] with his
[1:50:15] word

[1:50:21] the principle of a scripture anoint the
[1:50:23] sick with oil prayed the prayer of faith

[1:51:23] it must accomplish what he sent it to do
[1:51:26] amen yes sir they have thust sayeth the

[2:06:21] subject to the word of God oh if we

[2:06:27] it's all over when you realize every

[2:06:32] Affliction is subject to the word of God
[2:06:34] you just speak the word my servant will
[2:06:37] get well am amen
[2:06:39] amen amen that was Jesus word was enough

[2:06:49] you just say the word my servant will
[2:06:52] live yes amen his word still delivers
[2:06:55] amen amen this word that he's left
[2:06:58] behind on printed Pages a part of him
[2:07:00] when you accept it by faith into a
[2:07:02] spirit full life he said that his word
[2:07:05] was life and if and he said If any man
[2:07:08] have not the spirit of Christ he's none
[2:07:10] of is there it is he is life spirit and
[2:07:12] he is life that is exactly what the word
[2:07:15] is and that's exactly what Jesus is he
[2:07:17] is the word so when a spirit born spirit
[2:07:21] filled man in faith takes the word into
[2:07:24] his heart places it upon his lip what
[2:07:27] that is the same as deity speaking Every
[2:07:30] Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand

[2:10:36] know what you thought we entered into
[2:10:37] but we have entered into yes sir that
[2:10:40] kind of ministry we're way up the road
[2:10:42] soon the coming of the Lord Jesus and
[2:10:44] we've got to have Rapture and faith in a
[2:10:46] church that can be changed in a moment
[2:10:49] in the twinkling of eye to go out or we
[2:10:51] won't be there but don't worry it'll be
[2:10:54] there Hallelujah don't worry brother
[2:10:57] Jason it'll be there don't worry brother
[2:11:00] Matt it'll be there amen that's the
[2:11:02] ministry we're entering into and we got
[2:11:05] to have rapturing faith in a church that
[2:11:09] can be changed in a moment in a
[2:11:11] twinkling of an eye to go out or will
[2:11:14] not go but don't worry it'll be here
[2:11:16] it'll be there and when the power of
[2:11:19] this church
[2:11:21] Rises it'll bring its Brethren when the
[2:11:24] power of that church Rises it'll bring
[2:11:26] its Brethren and the power of that
[2:11:28] church will bring the other Brethren and
[2:11:30] there will be a general Resurrection
[2:11:33] amen hallelujah when the power rises in

[2:11:51] Brethren and they will call their
[2:11:53] Brethren and then there will be a
[2:11:55] general resurrection of all the Seven
[2:11:57] Ages now we're in this end time end of
[2:12:01] this time each man has looked at the end
[2:12:03] of his Junction for the coming of Christ
[2:12:06] but they got a lot to look forward to
[2:12:09] the return of the Jews and the flying
[2:12:11] saucers and the sky and all things that
[2:12:13] we see but we're at the end we are here
[2:12:16] now they knew the church was to receive
[2:12:19] power that would work in the church the
[2:12:22] same works of Christ because as a shadow
[2:12:25] becomes deeper and deeper and reflects
[2:12:28] more you can take a shade further away
[2:12:30] from the shade the least reflection you
[2:12:32] get of the shade and while the shade
[2:12:34] gets closer and closer to the tree the
[2:12:36] the shade is made the same thing and
[2:12:39] then in other words the negative becomes
[2:12:41] a positive now the spirit of God has
[2:12:43] worked under justification under Luther
[2:12:47] sanctification under Wesley baptism of
[2:12:49] the Holy Ghost under Pentecost and here
[2:12:51] it is in the last day performing and
[2:12:54] doing the very same things it did when
[2:12:55] it was in Christ what is it Christ and
[2:12:58] the church has become
[2:13:00] one and as soon as they connect together
[2:13:05] that last
[2:13:07] link hey you may be here tonight the
[2:13:10] last
[2:13:11] [Applause]
[2:13:12] link amen you may be the very one that
[2:13:16] needs to get on board and start hi in
[2:13:18] this wave of glory amen and as they as
[2:13:22] soon as they connect together the last
[2:13:24] link she'll go through the sky shouting
[2:13:28] and up will come Wesley Luther and all
[2:13:30] the rest of them back in the days there
[2:13:32] he that is first will be last and he
[2:13:34] that last to be first then will come the
[2:13:36] resurrection we're at the end time
[2:13:39] that's what the Holy Ghost does the Holy
[2:13:41] Ghost by justification just a light
[2:13:43] shadow of it San Holy Ghost by
[2:13:45] sanctification a little deeper shadow of
[2:13:47] it the holy goes by baptism of it a a
[2:13:50] deeper Shadow now the Holy Ghost by the
[2:13:52] restoration of its very person being in
[2:13:55] here forming signs and wonders like he
[2:13:57] did in the beginning Glory going to call
[2:13:59] me a Holy Roller anyhow you might as
[2:14:01] well get
[2:14:03] started all I asked is when the last
[2:14:05] time you were called a Holy
[2:14:07] Roller Amen brother Bron preached the
[2:14:10] whole sermon on why I'm why I am a Holy
[2:14:14] Roller amen then then in Elijah in a
[2:14:16] meal offering he said that and this is
[2:14:19] after that that he comes along he said
[2:14:21] that during the days of Luther we live
[2:14:23] by justification during the days of
[2:14:25] Wesley we live by sanctification the
[2:14:27] church becoming the minority in the days
[2:14:30] of Pentecost we have lived down through
[2:14:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[2:14:34] restoration of the gifts now we're
[2:14:36] really in the minority the coming of the
[2:14:37] Son of God here they believe by faith
[2:14:40] here they shouted under sanctification
[2:14:42] here they spoke in tongues as a gift but
[2:14:44] now the negative and the positive the
[2:14:45] cap is coming on the pyramid it is the
[2:14:48] end time when Christ and his church is
[2:14:52] so much alike till it's going to call
[2:14:54] the Dead from the Methodist Lutheran and
[2:14:57] all back there and there will be a
[2:14:59] resurrection those that fell asleep in
[2:15:01] the first 2 third fourth fifth sixth and
[2:15:03] seventh watch will rise one of these
[2:15:05] days to meet Jesus in the sky the hour
[2:15:08] has
[2:15:10] arrived
[2:15:12] hallelujah amen now listen as long as
[2:15:15] God's got a church he's going to have
[2:15:17] somebody
[2:15:18] that's that's got the Holy Ghost
[2:15:20] marching with it amen intellectuals will
[2:15:23] rise but God's got a minority somewhere

[2:45:53] that question in in in the gospels if
[2:45:56] you say to this mountain and brother
[2:45:59] Brandon couldn't couldn't figure that
[2:46:00] out how is that possible he didn't say
[2:46:03] if he said he said no if you say yes and
[2:46:06] he and and he he's struggling all that
[2:46:12] time is g a revelation
[2:46:15] said when you know the secrets to
[2:46:18] people's heart you think that's you that
[2:46:21] knows that when you're able to predict
[2:46:23] this and say that and prophesy and this
[2:46:25] comes to pass and know this about that
[2:46:27] person you think that's you doing that
[2:46:29] and brother brandom called it said no
[2:46:31] Lord that's not me that's you and he
[2:46:34] said I thought right then that any child
[2:46:37] of God how many children of God we got
[2:46:39] in here tonight any child of God all you
[2:46:41] had to do was be willing to live up
[2:46:44] there in those fears with God and it
[2:46:46] wouldn't be you thinking it wouldn't be
[2:46:48] you speaking it it would be God thinking
[2:46:50] it and speaking it through you yes is
[2:46:53] that what you desire tonight friends
[2:46:55] that's the freedom that you're entitled
[2:46:57] to why shouldn't you have it am you're
[2:46:59] entitled to it Christ purchased it for
[2:47:02] you Hallelujah that's what the Holy
[2:47:04] Ghost is given
[2:47:06] for amen my goodness I better sing some
[2:47:10] more before I start
[2:47:11] preaching you know something that really
[2:47:14] struck my heart night I thought about
[2:47:15] brother Tim just mentioned it now you go
[2:47:18] back there and you you go back into 2
[2:47:21] Samuel and Samuel records the words of
[2:47:23] King
[2:47:24] David and that's where David come down
[2:47:26] there and said you know I I I ran
[2:47:28] through a troop and I leapt over well
[2:47:30] he's not saying I could do it he said I
[2:47:32] did do it yes I did do it I'm telling
[2:47:35] you I've done it yes and if you go right
[2:47:38] up above that you'll read why David said
[2:47:40] he could do that he said because I kept
[2:47:42] your word I walked in righteousness and
[2:47:44] you judge me by my righteous heart I
[2:47:47] kept your statutes and that's that's why
[2:47:50] I could do that let me tell you
[2:47:51] something friends don't run away from
[2:47:54] the
[2:47:54] enemy because the presence of God might
[2:47:57] be waiting on you in that troop the
[2:47:59] presence of God might be waiting on for
[2:48:01] you at that wall oh I say we are to
[2:48:04] charge forward and take everything back
[2:48:07] that the enemy has ever taken from us
[2:48:08] how many believe it that
[2:48:10] way oh my Eli Elisha was so troubled
[2:48:16] that the king he said take your arrow
[2:48:19] said aim it out
[2:48:21] Eastward and the King did so and he said
[2:48:23] now shoot and he shot and he said you
[2:48:26] have victory over Syria and he said now
[2:48:29] take the take the quiver and strike it
[2:48:31] on the ground and the king one two three
[2:48:33] and
[2:48:35] stopped and the prophet was so angry he
[2:48:38] said you should have struck it five or
[2:48:40] six times then you could have
[2:48:42] annihilated your enemy completely
[2:48:44] completely instead you're only going to
[2:48:46] get three victories now that's a sad
[2:48:48] case because there was nothing the king
[2:48:51] could do about it you know why cuz
[2:48:52] Elijah Elisha died that's right there's
[2:48:55] no way to come back and read couldn't go
[2:48:57] back to the grave and say Elisha oh
[2:48:59] please come back and and tell me to do
[2:49:01] it again this time I'll strike five or
[2:49:03] six times you have an advantage tonight
[2:49:05] friends the Holy Ghost is still alive
[2:49:08] the Holy Ghost is still alive and he's
[2:49:10] in this building tonight and if you only
[2:49:12] ever struck three say Lord give me
[2:49:14] another
[2:49:15] chance oh strike till my enemy is
[2:49:19] completely
[2:49:21] destroyed oh blessed be the name of the
[2:49:24] Lord that's just that's our testimony
[2:49:26] tonight say Lord I want to strike that
[2:49:29] enemy till he's
[2:49:31] completely destroyed in my
