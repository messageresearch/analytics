deliverance and expose The Works of the enemy we commit ourselves to You For Your Glory we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord want to bring up that you have it up already thank you brother Mark we'll go directly to the word I'm calling this uh overcoming depression part two uh part one I think was over two years ago so I'm sure you all perfect recall so I'll be going over a lot of things that I covered back then but with a little bit different uh angle and this will be part two probably of a number of them going forward so let's look and we're going to read Proverbs 12 verse 25 then you'll be able to have your seats anxiety in the heart of man causes depression but a good word makes it glad amen may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word amen so I'm to understand this is a nogo this morning okay all right I won't be walking around you know me I'll have to it'll be tough to stay stationary yeah the handheld if I want to start moving around I'll grab the handheld but the likelihood of that is not good sure appreciate brother Matthew's Sunday school this morning um what a blessing it was and how fitting it was tying into what I wanted to talk about this morning now going into it just to lay the groundworks God is a great healer and a deliverer and we want we are going to we're going to look into the scriptures and into the message and show this clearly Welcome to our guests forgot that appreciate you being here may God bless you um but I want I want to look at depression I want to look at the age that we're living in and the unique circumstances that we have around us and I want to look at the remedy that God gives to us through the scriptures God Is A Healer amen and at the same time God gives us keys to this Warfare because it is a it is a spiritual warfare and if we just treat it as thank you we need Deliverance oh I'm depressed I I need Deliverance I'm depressed I need Deliverance you'll keep you'll have you'll get healed and then you'll come back for another reason then you'll get healed and you'll come back for another reason and I say that because this is not this is a there is Specific Instructions from the scripture of how to handle these things amen and of course we understand mental health is is constantly surrounding us it's in the news it's in schools yeah and it's pushed and thrust Upon Us on Tik Tok on Facebook Instagram reals everywhere they're talking about their version of what mental health is and even that in itself is a great danger and we'll talk about why that is brother brandham says in letting off the pressure it's just a builtup pre pressure it's the age we're living in a neurotic age where people don't know what to do where they're going and the doctors don't have the answer for it because the psychiatrist is being doctored by the psychiatrists so they have not the answer but there's some answer surely somewhere where could we where where we could deal on it for hours but I was just thinking that God has the answer if they could just set in place like this takes off the pressure see with people who are entered into eternity we're not going into it we're already in it that's right amen all right yes sir I got abundant water now I want to start by saying there is real trauma that people go through that can result in long-term impact upon mental health There's real depression there is real anxiety there is also a real living Supernatural God that heals and delivers and gives us the keys to walk in overcoming power overcoming power is not just being pressed through a straw it's not being just well God healed me that sure that's a start but overcoming power is knowing how to defeat the enemy and keep his punches off you and even turn it into an offensive attack against the devil amen and so I I never want to diminish what someone's going through There's real demons am let's just put it that way there's real demons that people are suffering through and there's real dark places that people's minds go to and it is real but it's not more real than God and it's not more real than the word of God Psalm 34 ver verse 15 the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open unto their cry the face of the Lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth the righteous cry and the Lord hears and delivers them out of all their troubles the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and save such as be of a contrite spirit praise the Lord so that's someone with a broken heart that's someone who is suffering they're they're sad they're in sadness they're in depression they're they're they're facing anxiety they're anxious and and the Bible says the Lord is near them the Lord comes near to them you don't have to think I'm alone God's abandoned me you actually have the word on it that when you're facing that God is near you all you have to do is call upon him Lord help me and save me yes and deliver me and he'll do it amen Psalm 69:20 reproach has broken my heart see a broken heart again and I'm full of heaviness and I look for some to take pity oh my but there was none and for comforters but I found none my goodness well today there's all kinds of people that will take your pity for a fee you can keep going and keep going and keep going for a fee and they will have all kinds of pity and they will have all kinds of quote unquote Comfort okay I don't want I don't want you to think I'm against a psychiatrist I don't believers who are social workers psychiatrists and God can use them but not if they follow what the world is telling them to do and what the the unbelieving ungodly University is telling them to do God brings Deliverance by people that care and that love people and I don't stand here and say well Psy psychiatrists and social workers and counselors are just evil they do it because they want to help but there is a system look at that and there is a program and Satan is involved in it and there's a great danger in in all of that and you know we can look and say we're super spiritual we got the baptism of the Holy Ghost we don't have any problems are you nuts the Holy Ghost is the start of the Warfare the Holy Ghost is the beginning of of troubles but it doesn't have to be a continuation of troubles you've entered into the Warfare as a babe in Christ when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you don't have to stay there you don't have to stay in a position of weakness all right I will praise the name of God with song and will Magnify Him with s Thanksgiving so here here the psalmist is saying I was alone no one was there to comfort me as a different age but there was no one there to comfort him sometimes we feel like that I'm alone no one understands no one can comfort me so what's the next step psalmist praise the name of your God with a song Magnify Him with Thanksgiving you can't stay unhappy long when you're giving thanks to God when you're remembering the great things that he's done for you this also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bulock that that has horns or hoofs the humble shall see this and be glad and your heart shall live that seek God for the Lord hears the poor and despise not his prisoners he heals the broken in heart and binds up their wounds amen you see God Is A Healer God is a deliverer and we that is that we have to start as Christians we have to start with that understanding whatever we're going through whatever situation we're facing however we feel we start with this God is a living God he's near you when your heart is broken all you have to do is call upon him and he will deliver you amen say Why didn't it happen instantly you know that better than that you know better than that God's not a vending machine God has a season and a purpose and a plan Jo job went through what he went through God didn't just snap his fingers the minute he said oh this is hard to deliver me from this there's a purpose there's a plan there's something that's God's doing you say I don't know what it is I I my heart is broken why doesn't he just step in now I don't know none of us know right amen but we do know the character of the one who is allowing us to go through this we know that he loves us we know that he wants want something even better for us as I was with Moses 1951 do you believe with all your heart that God will make you well oh heavenly father I pray you'll take this demon away from this woman come out of the woman in the name of Jesus Christ look lady you've been bothered a long time haven't you mental nervous depression is that right demons something haunts you and scares you is that right you accept me as God's Prophet raise up your hands and say thank the Lord for my healing go off the platform and forget all about it be well amen amen he's a Healer in faith Africa report are you the patient patient lady yes all right do you believe do you believe that God will reveal your troubles to me that's all I can do by the gift is that right now look you're a Believer filled with the spirit and now look you have a nervous condition a strain which is due to the time of it is with you and then another thing is you got a stomach trouble is that right that's right and your nervousness has caused the stomach trouble which is an ulcer in the stomach causes uh souring and so forth and swelling and sometime flurrying of the heart and your mental conditions and that you feel strained and upset all the time depressed is that right and many times Satan has told you you've crossed over the line and all those is that right but he's lied he's lied Jesus Christ has healed you do you believe that go eat what you want to eat then in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ bless you all right man so you see he is a Healer that lady had all those TR Troubles Down the Line believe it started with what was in her mind the anxiety and depression she was facing was bringing this upon this upon this upon that but God was mindful of her he knew what she was going through and he touched and healed her and delivered her amen amen in Hebrews chapter 2 1957 brother Bram says the Bible said he ascended on high and gave gifts unto men there was an atmosphere hung over the Earth of Darkness of Gloom of death and weary the prayers couldn't come up because the atonement wasn't made but he broke through that Veil he opened up the way he broke the veil of sickness he broke the veil of sin he broke the veil of weary he broke the veil of depressed he broke every Veil and made a highway for the wayfaring man walking up the King's Highway amen God's word is what brings us healing thinking back on the first uh verse that I read anxiety in the heart of man causes depression but a good word delivers him from it amen what is that good word you could say it's positive well yes it is I believe it's this word right here God's Living Word revealed to our hearts brings healing yes amen a prayer line will do it laying hands upon the sick a gift of the spirit will do it the Holy Ghost in you in your home asking God will do it but more than that God actually has the remedy for us if we'll see what it if we can see what it is right in the scripture it's so simple now looking at this I want to go a little bit deeper into the problem that we're facing in this age and the atmosphere that is around us we know we're living in a nervous age brother bandam says traveling around from Nation to Nation I find that everyone seems to be nervous and the psych WS are filling up and the people are down the street there seems to be so much anxiety and rust just as hard as they can that they don't have courtesy even one for another and I've noticed it amongst all people amen amen we're living in an age that's plagued with anxiety and depression people are constantly facing demons that take their minds to dark places they even know it they may not be Christians but you say are you as to a young person teenager are you facing demons they'll say yeah really I'm facing demons they don't know anything about what that actually means but they they know that they're facing facing demons and it's taking people's minds into very dark places and we're living in this atmosphere and we have a mind too amen and people become plagued with anxiety Then that anxiety develops into depression that depression turns into dark thoughts of self harm even harming others we see that people become so uh uh traumatized in their own minds that they want to go and shoot up a school or whatever it is that they put the blame on in the 1950s and 1960s they say it was considered very rare for anyone to be suffering from depression in America under 1% almost negligible the amount of people that actually suffered from major depressive disorder or whatever they want to call it now in America we have 15% of the young people aged 12 to 17 and 8% of adults that are suffering from major depressive order and now they tell us one in five Americans suffer from a me mental illness 70% of Americans suffer from some form of anxiety this is the age the neurotic age that brother brandham told us about and it's only increasing now it's it's very strange that the awareness of Psych Psychiatry and mental illness has gone up exponentially and the occurrences of mental illness has gone up exponentially wow this is demonic forces breaking out upon the people and the ultimate purpose of this is to prevent people from repenting and turning to Christ and living for him amen it is a spiritual war the devil does not want to be C Christ to be manifested in his people again and he's sending every demonic Force against us and though the world is being impacted by it the purpose of it is to hinder us and I want to say especially the younger Generations uh my kids and th those those ones that are in their 20s 30 early 30s and and under this is a scorge upon mankind that has happened Beyond this specific atmosphere of mental health awareness uh the enemy has created a world that creates a great deal of Uncertain certainty after Co it's very clear that the government is continuously and constantly deceiving the public it's not hard you don't have to be a conspiracy theorist anymore to understand this I'll leave it at that social media leads to fear of missing out and anxiety over not having the perfect life just like so and so has the perfect life perfect example is recently uh there was a woman who did a Tik Tok and she was crying over the fact that she uh had to make a cake for herself cuz she was a single mom and I had to make a cake for my own birthday and she's crying on the Tik Tock weeping cuz that way my kids can be happy and for singing Happy Birthday to me her H her ex-husband comes on and says this woman doesn't even have custody of the our children then everybody comes along and says this guy is abusive oh my they're all nuts this is social media that is social media that is social media it is a front it's not real no not well some people do but no it not everyone's posting every meal that that they're having some people eat craft macaroni and cheese some people eat ramen noodles some people they've got to stay home and work believe it or not you can't just be on continual vacation very rare people that do that even retired people sometimes stay home and don't even get dressed for that day it's not very glamorous but we think oh everything is just man amazing and uh if we don't have oh so and so's here that that one's over here my heart's palpitating why why don't I ever get this yeah you're in a delusion we're in a this is a it's a fake created World a good things can come of it certainly but what what the devil does within our minds is dangerous young people use their phones to bully one another things they would never say face to face they say uh on the phone old people use their phones to troll and mock one another and and so no wonder we're living in such an atmosphere but then it even gets worse that's just that's just on that level amen now we have to have a hyper awareness and we have to diagnose ourselves with mental health health issues and we have to be fixated on am I happy I'm am I happy am I I don't think I'm happy okay and we're fixated on it as though it is an end and of it in and of itself everyone's gives themselves their own diagnosis I'm this I'm that you're identifying yourself with a diagnosis based on Tik Tock Facebook re article you read a social worker you talked to your friend who is really well educated in psychiatrist and Psychiatry and again I'm not here here to put blame on any individual person people want to help but unless it's by the word we have a problem and we're going to be back with a problem Oh My and we identify ourselves as such and such I'm a this I'm ADHD I'm this I'm that I have PTSD I have this and we go on and on you are not your diagnosis you are not that thing you are not your you are not the depression you are not the anxiety It's actually an enemy that you have to battle against and then this is the atmosphere the world has then we offer you a solution go to a therapist and again they want to help and in some cases they can but often uh the therapist encourages the people to ruminate and think about and never really move on from what happened amen the public school hospital social workers will ask questions that lead people down a deceitful Road and they're trying to help but the deceitful road is I'm seeking after this ever elusive happiness that we're supposed to live in all the time right amen even on Apple Health open up your Apple Health app and they'll ask you what's your state of mind and we should think about our thoughts and we should identify ourselves with our thoughts if you know how the devil works you should know how dangerous that is the devil speaks to us into our minds and so we have to be careful to remember that at all times if it's against the word it's not of God it's from the devil and now we've produced a generation in the into the workforce that they have to take time off for mental health oh I'm just I can't get any work done because I've just got some mental health issues I'm dealing with okay real or perceived it's real okay it's real but it's because there's a there is a worldview and an overarching system that Satan has put in place that is deceiving people you you if if if they if you go to the hospital and if there's any concern that there's mental health issues they give the the National Institute of Mental Health gives the practitioners a list of questions to go through I don't even want to read them because there's kids here but they want to and if it's a kid they will separate that kid from their parents parents go away now I'm going to ask you about these very dark thoughts that you may or may not be having well I didn't have them before but now I do and maybe they were struggling many young people are because of the atmosphere that they're put in and that they're raised under and this this uh situation is not just at school it's not just on Tik Tok is how parents are raising their children as well and we have to be careful not to fall for pop psychology nonsense you know a CH child having dark thoughts that would get these five questions asked for them would have the seeds planted in their minds for even darker and worse thoughts and when they're in therapy and when they're with social workers and even sometimes as parents there's this need they're constantly indoctrinated to think about how they feel and that any things off you're not happy there's a problem and parents raise their children oh my kid's not happy well when I was growing up I wasn't even consulted about much of anything I was told what's going to happen and you know I don't think we should be uh disconnected from how our children are feeling however we shouldn't be governed by how they're feeling and that's the that's the problem that we're facing with is everything must be governed by how I'm feeling and what my mental health situation is well what if the whole picture of what mental health means is perverted and is of Satan what if that whole teaching about that is not of God what if God has a different program amen our our feelings how we feel about something becomes our absolute becomes our final Authority raise children based upon how they feel things like spanking or making decisions on their behalf that's abusive I'm traumatized because my mom spank me I am not traumatized because my mom spanked me brother Charles say many times his mom spanked him and and he was spanked probably a lot harsher than I was spanked and and we thank the Lord because these things of discipline and consequences for our actions are are critical and this is not about raising children but I guess I'll just say it is children we have boundaries children's need boundaries as well and if they cross cross them they have to first have this kind of consequence and as they get older the natural consequence instead we deliver them from everything because God got to be is my child happy are they H oh again there's nothing wrong with knowing that but there is a problem when that's how we govern everything instead of seeking up to raise them in the way they should go we raise them up with a false understanding of even what produces happiness if they want to wear makeup if they want to get earrings they want to disrespect mom Ah that's fine makes they're they're happy you know it's not going to work for this Dad disrespect mom nope it's not happening if they want to disobey their consequences regardless of tears and sorrow and sadness be sad be sorrowful Godly sorrow leads to repentance and we can't deliver our children from all consequences but that's what this therapeutic approach to raising children has done deliver them from consequences do everything for them let them dictate everything in the home because their happiness is our absolute okay well what what is this produced we can see the fruit of it oh yeah the first generation in America of children raised so incredibly gently and what do they do they hate their parents because of all the terrible childhood trauma that they faced they had the PS4 not the PS5 they they gave me craft macaroni and cheese they didn't take me out for sushi every day what I wanted they're spoiled rotten that's the problem they didn't get a spanking it's the first generation of children that don't want to have children can you imagine that they don't want to have children and they mock people that do want to have children why would you want to have children you were raised so gently it should be the should have been the greatest experience of your life right children raised with all kinds of psychotherapy have become a generation of young adults full of Despair in the most unhappiest and depressed Generations ever young adults are not prepared for jobs to live on their own or to be responsible even in the remotest way they need safe safe spaces and time off to take care of their mental health and I I don't want want to denigrate anyone that might be raised in this situation and that are facing these things God has a Deliverance but you have to repent and you have to come and look at this situation the way God looks at it and not the way you've been taught and uh indoctrinated to look at it they've been taught and and you can't blame them they've been taught and it's been emphasized you have to considerately constantly consider your mental health and your state of happiness and you have to allow your feelings to dictate the terms of everything in other words they've been taught to be led by their human Spirit which is governed by the desires of the Flesh and this overarching approach to life causes them to see everything Through The Eyes of victimhood and a lack of personal responsibility amen amen I want to look and examine Ecclesiastes for a little bit because I think this directly has to do with the situation we find oursel in today Ecclesiastes 1 vers one the words of the preacher the son of David King in Jerusalem vanity of vanity sayeth the preacher vanity of vanities all is Vanity what prophet hath a man of all his labor which he takes Under the Sun the word vanity in Hebrew means emptiness it figuratively means something transitory or unsatisfactory the word vain means empty worthless pointless lacking value unsatisfying amen so understand God made everything good he didn't intend for work to be vanity he didn't tend for companionship to be vanity he didn't intend for anything to be meaningless but because of sin things have become vanity things have become vain God made everything good and when everything was completed he said it was very good but sin marred it and now things are vain the Bible says it's made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who subjected the same in hope so even even the the what the meaninglessness that you find God was going to turn around and and and solve all that so I want to look at this word in the sense of meaning L when you say vanity of vanities it's talking about meaning or purpose it's meaningless so why is it meaningless Jeremiah 179 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it so because of sin our heart is governed by evil desires and those evil desires do what what we cause us to seek after pleasure for the sake of pleasure itself let's look further in Ecclesiastes all things verse eight All Things Are full of Labor man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing verse 13 and I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under Heaven this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith so what Solomon is saying here is my conclusion of looking at everything I've done is Vanity of vanity so he's starting with his conclusion but he's going to then go through the Book of Ecclesiastes and tell you how he arrived at that point amen so first he's saying I became a scholar I'm studying everything under heaven to become an expert at it I have seen all the works that are done under the sun and behold all is Vanity and vexation of spirit I commune with my own heart saying Lo I'm come to Great Estate I'm very wealthy and I've have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem yay my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge and I gave my heart to no wisdom and to no Madness and Folly I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increases knowledge increases sorrow so here he's trying to find meaning in wisdom and he Fe finds out as he studies every natural thing he comes to the end is this is Vanity and vexation of spirit it Ecclesiastes 2:1 I said in my heart go to now I will prove thee with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this also is Vanity so he said okay now I'm going to seek after every pleasure that I can possibly seek after and what is the result what did I find out it's vanity it's meaningless I said of laughter it's mad and of Mirth what does it do I sought in my heart to give myself un wine yet acquainting my heart with wisdom and to lay hold on to Folly till I might see what was good for the sons of man which they should do under he the heaven all the days of their life thank you Solomon we don't have to figure that out yourself everybody Solomon has already discovered that drinking too much alcohol is no good he was way richer than you he was richer than the richest people on the planet planet today he had everything that he could possibly dream of and Beyond and his results are as this is crazy I made me great works I builded me houses I planted me Vineyards I made me Gardens and Orchards I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruits I made me pools of water to water there with now you think it's just this he he literally made lakes that fed into lakes which fed into lakes and he surrounded them by with fruit uh uh fruit uh Orchards so that those pools of water would then uh feed in and water the the trees he bought slaves and maidens he had servants born in his house he had POS great possessions of Great and Small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me I gathered me also silver and gold and the peculiar Treasure of kings and of the provinces i g me men singers and women singers and the Delights of the sons of man as musical instruments and that of All Sorts he got the best musicians he got the best music he got the he got the best farming he got the best uh uh uh Orchards he got the best slaves he got the most wives he got the most concubines I mean what else could he do he got the best wine what was the results so I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me and whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them I withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoice in all my labor and this was the portion of all my labor then I looked on all the works of my hands that my hands had wrought and on the labor that I had labored to do and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no profit Under the Sun for what what hath man of all his labor and the vexation of his heart wherein Heath labored Under the Sun for all his days are sorrows and his travail grief yay his heart takes not rest in the night this also is Vanity so we see seeking after Happiness by becoming a scholar it's vanity seeking after happiness that's the end that we're talking about it's it's not saying that there's there's there's no good in work there's no good in wisdom he's saying seeking after that to find meaning by seeking after that is meaningless seeking after Happiness by by going after Central pleasure sex food alcohol he says it's vanity am seeking ha H Happiness by giving yourself over to work work completely vanity of course Solomon encourages finding wisdom he encourages working he en encourages enjoying the the fruits of your work good food nice home Etc he encourages finding companionship but he discourages us from seeking to find meaning in them as an end in and of themselves let's look at the Tanakh oh I didn't include it did I let me see no I'm going to read directly from Ecclesiastes 12 13 and 14 this is what conclusion Solomon comes to the end of the matter all having been heard so this is the results of all his searching all his studying all his examination what is it the end of the matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole man for God shall bring every work into the Judgment concerning every hidden thing whether it be good or whether it be evil now in the KJV it says the whole duty of man and many other translations say the whole duty of man but the Hebrew doesn't include the word duty this says this is the whole man in other words the whole man is what what is his purpose what did God Place us here for to fear God and to keep his Commandments this is the whole man so if a if you want to be a whole person what should you do fear God and keep his Commandments that is man's purpose that is man's function that is the place that man finds his meaning when he himself is wrapped up in the purpose of God that's where he finds happiness you never will find happiness by seeking after happiness how many times have you thought that new pair of shoes you need to get that new laptop that you work so hard and saved for you'll become happy that new piano then I'll be happy and it's like sand you're grabbing sand with your fingers open where is it where is that happiness happiness is not coming from things happiness is not coming from situations in life I've seen people who've had the most miserable lives be the happiest people that I've ever met and we all know in our society we we have so much stuff we have so much wealth and people are not happy if the if if if the if having stuff and having the best food and the best whatever resulted in happiness then we would be overflowing With It in America but we are not then they'd be overflowing with it in Europe they're not either we're the most depressed Society on Earth it isn't the ones that are poor that are the most depressed they have their struggles too everyone does but what is it when we have taught every everyone to seek after happiness as the end and of itself and is the most important thing we have destroyed the minds of people and until they get the Holy Ghost and their mind is even baptized with the Holy Ghost they can never really come to that place of peace and contentment amen I encourage everyone to listen to the sermon life in 1957 by brother brandham I'm going to read an extensive quote from this and I'm doing that and taking up time to do that because it is absolutely incredible and perfect along with what we're talking about all right if we're and I don't bring it up there because um I want I want to take my time he says if we're rejoicing over the world and the evil things our minds and our souls are inspired by below Boogie woggie dances heart heartaches drinking and all these other things that we run after it's from below but if we rejoice in the spirit that we have eternal life and we raise our emotions to God and praise him then we have joy then we have joy Jesus said that your Joys might be full but not full of the perverted life but full of eternal life above so you can see it depends on what you look at now just for instance for the psychology part of it psychiatric now let's notice just a moment the psych view here is the picture of Christ and here is an electric fan it depends on which one I look at see if my emotions is moved this way or my emotions is moved that way if I look at that and long for that and desire that my emotions is set towards the fan but if I look this way my emotions and desires is set that way that's the reason Jesus said whoever whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with already in his heart see it's where your emotions is set where your thought is and then we can Rejoice on because that we are children of the promise on that great Eternal Church of God who has Christ's own promise it can't fail that's right the world thinks we're crazy oh this is life whoee remember that story that brother bham tells women half-dressed drunk drunk and partying and so this is life my goodness he said I'm this this day to see a young lady who went to a psychiatrist she's 35 years old never smoked never drank in all her life a very fine girl her people are Christians her father is a doctor and she she gave her life to Christ in the early stage and what did she do she goes out and she finally gets to a place to a college where she was teaching and a psychiatrist there he sit down to talk to her and he said do you mean that you never been kissed by a boy she said not one time in all my life you mean you've never had a little drink and been in a party never said girl you don't know what you're missing now him being a psychiatrist he swung the girl's mind until now she has become so evil and so bad till she don't even want to hear the name of Jesus spoke to her in her presence and even her father and mother can't even see her no more and she has lost her mind and this next week will'll go to the institution for shock treatment it's because that she turned her thought thoughts from Christ unto what that psychiatrist was moving her mind and that's what we're here for this morning is to move your mind and your thinking from the things of the world unto the things of God which is eternally and that's what preaching is for is to pervert the thinking to a higher and better and to the place where Christ is until you become converted then your mind reaches for those things which are above now but life in this other Place gets to this girl they're thinking she might take poison at any time sure life becomes so miserable that type of life until they kill themselves take poison and everything now but God in his great economy for mankind has made man in the way that he wanted man to be he made him to thirst now you see another place that he's getting to first he's talking about where is your F Focus where is your mind going now he's coming on why is that important because he made us to thirst and you see that this poor girl I'm I'm just going to dramatize in a minute she grows up in a Christian Christian home her parents are godly people she goes off to the university she begins to take some college courses and in the college courses they they bring her to a teacher who turns her mind around on psychology and using psychology attacks her Christian virtue and because now he sets her mind on a different way of thinking and approaching life right now what what's happened she's gone on into depression so what good was the learning about Psychiatry she was fine to begin with she went to learn this other way what is it science civilization education are all of the devil and brother Bram says it's making the people like ragweeds all right did you notice what David said here said my soul thirsts for thee oh I love that as in a dry lands where there's no water just imagine said my soul is so thirsty God I'm thirsting for you just like I was in a land where there was no water he must find water or perish my soul is thirsting for thee now God made Man With The Thirst that's a part of the H human being is his thirst but God made The Thirst in man to thirst for God Amen just what Solomon said obey God fear God and keep his Commandments made us to thirst for God and the devil has perverted it and make it a thirst for his kingdom for the world do you get it The Thirst in man is Godly for God made the man to thirst but thirst for God amen and how dare some of you would be so little to try to quench that blessed thing of Thirst by trying to satisfy that with drinking and smoking and television and running and carrying on and reveling around trying to satisfy that Godly thing that God put in you to thirst for him you are polluting the fountain that God has placed in you to receive his spirit and you're drowning it with the things of the world and they do not satisfy and they will never satisfy and that's the reason you put put a pistol to your brains to blow them out is because that things that go go the way they do and the world is on the great suicide and a perversion and a homosexual and the crime is in the land the way it is is because you're perverting the very thing that God give you and trying to satisfy it with the evil of this world take that blessed holy spirit that God placed The Thirst in your soul to call for and you satisfy it with an the nightclub somewhere no wonder you got a headache the next morning you'll take a case of beard and go to your house and sit down and drink it try to satisfy that Godly thirst that God put in your soul to thirst after him and take the devil's slop and try to satisfy The Thirst that God put in you to thirst after him how can you receive anything but Eternal separation from the presence of almighty God when he made you to thirst after him and David surrendered himself and said my th soul is thirsting like I was in a dry land where there's no water I thirst for thee Oh god there you are David said I seen thee in thy sanctuary and my soul Soul thirst for that power there you are that's the difference that's what makes the difference is The Thirst that God give you is you satisfy it with water all right now again I'm going to repeat what brother Matthew brought this morning is sometimes we're satisfying that thirst it's not so black and white we're not watching pornography we're not watching some something horrible but we're watching something that is not Redeeming the the time it's just for the pure sake of entertainment now is it is it okay to watch things for the sake of entertainment if it's a Godly thing I think so but when that becomes the focus when we focus on the game when we focus on another thing besides on Christ we're going after happiness from something that is like sand seeping through our fingers we're we're never to try to satisfy our thirst with the things of the world even if it's something that is maybe in the middle and it's not so bad even that can be bad because it isn't the right thing it's a thing it might be bad it might be good but it isn't the thing that we're supposed to be going after the person that we're going after Satan has inserted something into this generation to pollute it so terribly we cannot even stand another generation to go further where we've come to the world's atmosphere young people are raised in the entertainment World plunges them into this garbage pop psychology it blames everything on the parents it breaks relationships and ruins homes leads them further in despair this is the world that our kids are surrounded by it's Satan's Gospel of psychology in the classroom in the home on social media let's focus on our mental health to the point where we're crippled by it you know that's you realize that that's what's happening you have focused on you to the point where you are crippled by you how could you ever find happiness by trying to I found happy you know I've really achieved Victory I'm I'm Tony Robbins I F I found Happiness by focusing on my happiness you know i' I've been a stay-at-home mom and I really been focused on you know serving my husband and my children but you know I decided I decided I'm going to focus on me and everybody's like you go girl come on really they do you've seen it I'm going to focus on my happiness and you're going to become the most depressed person that we know next we do is we train children to find the trauma in their life this trauma happened because my dad did this this trauma happened because my mom said this hey every parent here has made mistakes and lots of them there's no perfect parent except for our heavenly father the rest of us got problems and we make mistakes and we say dumb stuff and guess what a real child that's raised up with the Bible as the absolute forgives and moves forward I mean you you you hurt your six-year-old feelings who they who can forgive and love you better than that little one it's incredible but what have we done we've undone forgiveness we've undone deliverance and healing and we've caused people to say so un soul is bad to me growing up therefore I am like this I'm sorry you're not a victim as a Christian you are you have victory in Christ no matter what somebody did to you you don't have to live in bondage to what they did to you you are not what they did to you you are a son of God or a daughter of God you are free and you don't have to be haunted by that anymore amen I have I have much more to say by that but time is getting short and I really need to get on to Philippians chapter 4 we'll cover that those things in the next time I preach because this is really I want I want to spend the last 15 minutes or so going on this because this is God's remedy amen and as I'm approaching this this is not just inspiring words this is the Bible it's a command to you just as Deuteronomy 225 is a command to you this is a command to you and I'm just I'm I'm trying not to overemphasize this but I can overemphasize this is if you want to be free from the oppression that the enemy is putting on on you put this into practice you will be free you will have Victory and the devil will be running in fear from you when you wake up in the morning be careful for nothing it literally means don't worry about anything am but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God so what Paul is speaking about to the Philippians in this is peace peace is a lot better than happiness happiness is elusive sometimes I'm happy sometimes I'm not the more I think about it the less I am that that's really not the end and of itself being finding fulfillment or peace in Christ is much more valuable than being happy happy will come and go it's up and down it's here and there sometimes we're supposed to be sorrowful there's a in in every there's a season for everything a time to laugh a time to mourn all of these things is part of the human condition you're not supposed to cry at a wedding you're supposed to cry at a funeral these are different things that we go through it's it's it's normal we've all experienced it on some level or another in different ways that's normal but you can find peace and meaning real purpose no matter the circumstances now the devil will try to take that away from you that's why we need this do not worry about everything pray about everything yeah so we have two things going on they're both in the mind and they're both done in secret place and they're both engaging actually the same thing the soul Faith or unbelief Faith or unbelief what is what is worrying is simply unbelief it's seeing circumstances and engaging in your imagination in unbelief towards the circumstances and then you feed that and then it becomes a pattern and then there's a well-worn pattern in your brain of worry anxiety and fear I am a worrier would you shut up devil are you identifying as a sinner as you are you're identifying I'm an unbeliever I'm sorry I'm not doing that anymore don't worry about anything if is a command from the word of God so when we're engaging and worrying we're disobeying our heavenly father so what am I supposed to do instead pray about it oh that doesn't seem like very uh mysterious Revelations coming forth from the pulpit pray about it am I don't care what it is or what it isn't it's very simple worrying engages the same thing that prayer does just going NE another Direction instead of using the imagination your your soul right your soul that's the nature of your spirit it's either Faith or unbelief right and that that Soul has inlets it works through inlets of the spirit and so it uses those inlets and so if those are all clogged up by what the psychologists and the social justice Warriors and the the victim mentality and all that stuff is being put before you how can you not worry about anything God go if God says it it's brother brandham says this if God says it he has to make a way for it to be so first get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you'll never be able to do this without Christ's in you the hope of glory so start with that is you need a nature change if your nature is still the old nature and the nature of the world you can use psychology good psychology to fix yourself but that isn't the transforming power of God Amen you can be right back in the same position later the transforming power of God makes us subject to the word so pray about everything tell God what you need and thank him for what he's done this is so simple but the reality is the devil gets our eyes off of that we start to worry this this this this this could happen this could go this way what if this happens why did this person say this why did all these things come to our minds stop slow down don't worry pray amen then trust God and thank him that he's given you the answer already because he has given you the answer all right and the peace of God or then the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus many times I looked at this and saw what a what a wonderful verse I want the peace of God to that passes all understanding to keep me but I forgot that it's connected to this verse so you can't expect verse seven to come to you if you're not doing verse six so you verse six verse 7 comes this is not a magic wand this is doing what God has said to said to do again I spoke before God Is A Healer and a deliverer you come to the platform of depression God will heal you you go back with the same habits in your mind you'll come back again to be delivered from depression for something else the purpose of the Bride is to come to maturity to be Overcomers so that we can walk in faith never doubting and be delivered and not have to experience these things yes ups and downs come but we have we have the ammo in our gun to fire at the Devil it's a peace that passes all understanding that means it's a peace that actually doesn't even make sense considering the circumstances and that peace will keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Christ Jesus he doesn't stop there finally Brethren finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things so Paul is telling us this is what you need to think about if you want peace you need to be thinking about the right things if you're thinking about things with anxiety fear and worry you won't have peace amen and remember this is not just a human thing this is a spiritual battle and warfare the devil is trying to rob you of Peace he's trying to take away your Authority in Christ he's trying to make you useless for the kingdom of God Amen and and God is giving us tools to fight the enemy so we you have to guard what your thoughts what you allow yourself to think about you can't stop the birds from flying by but you can keep them from roosting we hear that that means you control your thought life you don't say I have no control over this if you're in Christ you do if you're not in Christ I can agree with you but if you're in Christ you have control and you you have power and you have authority to take dominion over your thoughts yes amen those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you and I want you to understand that walking in victory has to do with not just thinking it's also doing amen amen when we sit and ruminate about our thoughts and our hurts and our pains and what people have done to us what ends up happening is you're creating an atmosphere around yourself of unbelief of bitterness amen of anger ultimately you become in our society today I am the victim of what other people did to me and then what's the next thing you do you run from church to church to find somebody that's going to live up to your expectations and no one can live up to your expectations because your expectations are wrong because in your mind you're the victim you're not an overcomer you're a victim so and so did me wrong and so and so everybody has been done wrong everybody has been hurt in church in the nicest church with the nicest people someone's going to hurt you okay so what what how are you going to handle it yes amen are you going to be a victim are you going to be a gossip or are you going to do what the word says Paul says that part of having God's peace again it says and the God of Peace it could just as well be translated then the God of Peace shall be with you so if you in other words flip that around if you want the God of Peace to be with you the things that you've heard and learned and received don't do them so if you're not walking on obedience to the word you can't expect expect the peace of God to be with you if you're trying to do your own way with your own thinking you we we'll pray for you to have peace certainly but it's not coming it'll be temporary it won't be a real lasting transformation do it's not in thinking it's in doing all right musicians if you'd come I got a lot more material which I expected I would I'm going to skip to the last portion this is what Paul is telling us and this is the way to victory over depression don't do not engage your mind in worry when anxious and worried thoughts come treat that as an enemy that's a foreign combatant he's not welcome here he's going to be he's going to be shock on sight amen instead pray worship give thanks to God for the answer in faith father these worried thoughts are coming to me I cast them down in the name of Jesus Christ Lord this is the situation I'm feeling concerned about would you come would you move in that situation would you would you heal would you give wisdom would you would you protect us whatever it might be and then we say thank you God for healing for delivering for protecting then the next thing the enemy is not going to give up he's going to come back and he's going to try to give more thoughts then you just say I remember that time I was sick and laid down in the hospital God delivered me from from death oh my how he how how the Holy Spirit came and showed me those things how we start to think about the the blessings oh my look at the wonderful children God is bless me with and how they're growing and the F the the the family of God I have around the things that you can be be thankful for th those are the things that you should start to think about anything that's excellent and worthy of Praise think about that then next Jus you have to make sure you're doing you're walking in obedience you're putting into practice the things that you've learned and heard from the messenger of the age in the word h then the God of Peace will be with you amen again I I just I want to [Music] uh I just want to say to those maybe maybe you're listening in maybe you're not here maybe you're listening in and you've been raised up in this Society that's valued your feelings and your happiness above the truth above real healing and real Deliverance I'm not I I'm never trying to talk down to anybody that would be suffering in their minds and in their hearts but I'm trying to give you the right way of looking at the world yes Through The Eyes of almighty God there's always healing there's always Victory if if if you if if your eyes are on focused so focused on yourself then why don't you do something for someone else amen why don't you stop thinking about yourself and go serve someone who's been broken just like you have there's countless stories women who are in prostitution their whole life sold into prostitution as little girls they get they get delivered uh someone comes to help them a missionary comes overseas baby comes to help help them what what happens what happens they end up serving the very people that they were before and what are they they're they're full of joy they're full of Peace they're full of Happiness why because it's not about not about us it's not about what we're feeling or thinking we're here to live for others we don't earn our eternal life by living for others but if you have eternal life if you're a possessor of eternal life you will live for others eternal life is living for others amen giving out the devil will try to take you into depression he'll make you run from church run from fellowship run from talking to other people stop listening to brother brandom stop listening to sermons stop having devotions and on and on and on he'll he'll put you into conflicts and and you'll just turn into a gosp and become a victim instead of handling with the way the word word says resolve your conflicts with the person directly amen just talk about it it's fine what's be that's that's much better than going down this line and turning yourself into a victim of your circumstances that's not scriptural God wants to heal you and deliver you more even more than you want to be delivered and maybe the problem is well I was delivered once but now it's come back maybe you haven't put the word to practice maybe you haven't let's keep the devil's punches off of us now let's not just say well the devil's got a Punch coming and just stand there with our with our hands down I mean if Mike Tyson is coming to punch you you better put your hands [Music] up you don't stand and let the devil beat on you you keep the punches off and you learn to punch back because you're not a victim you're an overcomer that's right not in your own power but in the strength of the Holy Ghost in you he's not pressing you through a pipe right he's giving you the keys to walk in Victory let's stand Heavenly Father we thank you so much for your word we thank you so much for your light for your life we thank thank you for your healing power Lord father I just pray for anyone who's suffering in their mind and their emotions Lord I pray that you would supernaturally move upon them Lord and heal them and deliver them Lord give them the strength Lord for all of us help us to battle the enemy in our thought life not to engage in worry and fear and anxiety but to treat it like an enemy and to follow what your word [Music] says to by the power of the Holy Ghost control our thoughts upon the word upon thankfulness upon prayer we we we give ourselves to you Lord we know surely that the enemy will come in like a flood every time I preach something like this the Devil comes in like a flood but we we're so thankful to know by Your Word
