[7:38] Yes, sorry I was on the wrong part. So,
[7:40] second Peter chapter 1 and verse the
[7:43] first uh eight verses. It says, "Simon
[7:45] Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus
[7:47] Christ, to them that have obtained like
[7:51] precious faith with us through the
[7:53] righteousness of God and our savior
[7:55] Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be
[7:57] multiplied unto you through the
[7:59] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,
[8:02] according as his divine power hath given
[8:05] unto us all things that pertain pertain
[8:08] unto life and godliness through the
[8:10] knowledge of him that hath called us to
[8:12] glory and virtue, whereby we are given
[8:17] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[8:19] great and precious promises, that by
[8:21] these ye might be partakers of the
[8:24] divine nature, having escaped the
[8:26] corruption that is in the world through
[8:28] lust. And besides this, giving all
[8:31] diligence, add to your faith virtue, and
[8:34] to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge
[8:37] temperance, and to temperance patience,
[8:39] and to patience godliness, and to
[8:42] godliness brotherly kindness, and to
[8:45] brotherly kindness, charity. For if
[8:47] these things be in you and abound, they
[8:49] make you that ye shall neither be barren
[8:52] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[8:55] Lord Jesus Christ. Let's just pray.
[8:57] Heavenly Father, we just thank you for
[8:59] the word, Lord, this morning. Just a
[9:01] little lesson that we have on our
[9:02] hearts. We just pray that you'd just
[9:03] come and speak to our hearts this
[9:05] morning. Open us up to hear your word.
[9:07] We love you. We just commit all these
[9:08] things to you in Jesus Christ's name.
[9:10] Amen. God bless you. You can be seated
[9:12] this morning.
[9:14] I'm just taking a a a second part or
[9:16] part two the to a thought I took a few
[9:19] weeks ago on the maturing of sons and
[9:21] daughters. And just to catch a few
[9:23] highlights from the last time to help
[9:24] with some foundation, we started talking
[9:26] about the maturing process that takes
[9:29] place in a believer's life when they're
[9:31] born again. And I was just typing some
[9:34] natural examples of how babies or
[9:36] children um as they grow and develop,
[9:39] they don't have the capability to handle
[9:42] objects the way that maybe someone is
[9:45] older can. Um very simple tasks like
[9:48] basic hand eye coordination, um
[9:50] dexterity in their fingers and in their
[9:53] their control, their their fine motor
[9:55] skills because those muscles just
[9:58] haven't developed yet. And I was typing
[10:00] that in scripture to Hebrews where Paul
[10:03] describes being able to um get past the
[10:06] the milk of the word and and getting to
[10:09] a maturity level where we can begin to
[10:12] eat the strong meats. Amen. Of of
[10:14] revelation in our life. And I had made
[10:16] the example because
[10:18] um you know it's it's vital to to to
[10:21] discern the stage that that you're in
[10:23] and that people are in. and with proper
[10:25] discernment and prayer, you know, we we
[10:27] ought to be able to help each other out
[10:28] on the walk that we're on. Amen. Um, and
[10:30] I have some natural examples I want to
[10:32] look at and type them to some spiritual
[10:34] things. This is a very natural example.
[10:36] A few days ago, um, you know, I was just
[10:38] spending some time with with Joy and
[10:40] Lana, and Lana's in this stage right
[10:42] now. She's so excited to learn about
[10:45] everything. And so Joy was teaching her
[10:48] how to write an uppercase A and then a
[10:51] lowercase A. And so she watched, we
[10:53] talked about that last time, she
[10:54] mimicked. So she watched Joy draw the
[10:57] uppercase A and then she did it and she
[10:59] did a really good job and she followed
[11:01] suit. She did, she wrote it just like
[11:03] Joy did. But then she got to the
[11:04] lowercase A. And if I should have put an
[11:08] example up basically [music]
[11:11] what it looked like
[11:17] and it was a circle and a line but it
[11:21] looked like a queue. It looked a little
[11:22] different and you know she watched the
[11:25] correct way to do it and then she tried
[11:27] to do it herself. And the cool thing was
[11:29] is that she was she was so proud of
[11:31] herself. And you know, kind of an
[11:34] important point is is that even though
[11:37] it didn't exactly resemble what it was
[11:39] supposed to, she did try her very best
[11:41] and she made steps towards learning. She
[11:44] she watched the right way to do it,
[11:46] right? And then she tried and it wasn't
[11:48] exact. And I I talked to Joy because,
[11:50] you know, as a dad, you're like, "Well,
[11:51] no, you want to do it this way." And Joy
[11:53] uh the teacher in her, she was like,
[11:55] "You know, actually a lot of kids her
[11:56] age do an upper or a lowercase A like
[11:59] that. It looks like a Q. So that's just
[12:01] normal the stage of development that
[12:03] she's actually in. And even though it
[12:07] wasn't exact um you know uh something I
[12:11] just I thought at this point you know
[12:13] eventually she will be able to write the
[12:16] lowercase a properly. It's just
[12:18] important that she's looking at the
[12:20] right thing. Amen. It's important that
[12:23] she's being shown the right way to do
[12:25] that. The more she practices the better
[12:28] it'll be. Um, and I had taken some time
[12:30] on on kind of that note last time and I
[12:33] mentioned how important it is for
[12:35] believers to have, you know, good
[12:37] examples of other believers in our life.
[12:39] People that people that really manifest
[12:41] the fruit of the word, you know, and and
[12:44] we ought to always lean more towards the
[12:46] word than the world. Amen. And uh the
[12:48] more the more we lean in our lives
[12:51] towards the world and worldly behaviors
[12:54] and worldly atmospheres, the more we can
[12:56] be influenced by that type of thing. I
[12:59] want to go through this quote here
[13:00] because I talked on it last time
[13:03] um about virtues, but I want to start.
[13:06] So we talked about the sermon brother
[13:09] takes this text that I wrote uh read
[13:11] this morning. He takes that in the
[13:13] stature of a perfect man. And we um
[13:15] talked a little bit about that last
[13:16] time. I'm going to we're going to go
[13:19] through some quotes this morning, but
[13:20] we'll start with that foundational
[13:22] element because we kind of mentioned it
[13:24] last time and it's kind of small, but
[13:28] it's all right. Uh that's my fault.
[13:30] First, he says, "First, you must be born
[13:32] again, and then when you're born again,
[13:35] you have faith. You believe the word.
[13:37] Until you're born again, you'll argue
[13:39] against it. If you're just religiously
[13:42] inclined and you got a little human
[13:43] knowledge that you should do right,
[13:45] you'll never be able to agree upon the
[13:47] word of God. You'll never do it. You've
[13:50] got to be born again. And born again, it
[13:52] produces faith. All right? Then after
[13:54] you get faith, this right here, f a t,
[13:58] faith, then you're just in position of
[14:01] growing. Amen. And he goes on to say in
[14:04] the next one, he says, "Now a lot of
[14:05] people go up to the altar and pray and
[14:08] say, Lord, forgive me." and a great
[14:10] experience of sanctification comes upon
[14:12] them and things then you have a great
[14:14] time get up to the altar shouting you go
[14:17] back and say bless God I got it no you
[14:20] just started to a place now where you
[14:22] can grow you ain't done nothing yet see
[14:25] the only thing you done is just laid the
[14:27] foundation so he begins to to bring this
[14:30] foundation out he says now you're going
[14:32] to build a house and you pour the
[14:34] foundation say boy I got her see you got
[14:37] the foundation to build your house on.
[14:40] Now, you got to build a house. Now,
[14:42] there's where the thing comes in this
[14:44] morning. We're going to talk about now.
[14:45] All right, a house. The foundation is
[14:48] first. What is the foundation of
[14:49] Christianity? Faith in the word of God.
[14:52] That's your foundation. Then you can
[14:54] begin to grow. Then you start to begin
[14:56] to add to this foundation. And he says,
[14:58] "Now, building a house, you put your uh
[15:01] you put your uprights and everything
[15:02] else." Brother Wood and some of these
[15:04] carpenters and contractors could tell us
[15:05] how you build your house. But I'm going
[15:07] to tell you how to build your spiritual
[15:09] house where God can dwell. He wants to
[15:12] dwell in you. He wants to make you like
[15:15] himself. He wants you to be reflected
[15:18] reflecting rather his being. He wants
[15:21] his being to be reflected in your life.
[15:23] So he he's going to type out and this is
[15:25] kind of a a really good teaching on
[15:27] that. He says that's where you begin to
[15:29] grow. You can put that down for just a
[15:30] minute. [snorts] That's where you begin
[15:32] to grow. He he wants to make us like
[15:35] himself. And I, you know, that's just a
[15:37] really important point. He wants to make
[15:39] us like himself. He wants to reflect his
[15:42] being.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; And you know, what does that entail? You
[15:44] we look at the life of Christ and the
[15:46] fruits he bore. You know, we look at the
[15:48] prayer life that that Jesus had. He even
[15:50] had, you know, he was a busy guy, but he
[15:52] still Jesus God in flesh still had to
[15:54] separate himself from the world. He had
[15:56] to go up in a mountain. He had to get to
[15:58] himself because he he knew that there
[16:01] was such a
[16:03] an atmosphere in the world that you have
[16:05] to withdraw yourself from to be able to
[16:07] get into that place. And then you look
[16:09] at his ability, Jesus's ability to
[16:11] overcome with the word. And he wants us
[16:13] to possess those very very same things.
[16:16] The [snorts] very next thing the prophet
[16:19] talks about here, and I think it's on
[16:21] the next slide, is virtue. And I thought
[16:23] this was really powerful. He says um
[16:25] then after we lay the foundation
[16:27] secondly you add to your foundation. You
[16:29] add to your faith. First you have faith
[16:31] then you add you add virtue to your
[16:34] faith. This is the next column. Pour
[16:36] your foundation then to your faith add
[16:37] virtue. Now right there knocks a lot of
[16:41] us down. Yes sir. Yes. Add virtue to
[16:44] your faith. Now that doesn't mean living
[16:46] a virgin life you know like the woman or
[16:48] a man or so forth. That doesn't have
[16:51] anything to do with it. The Bible said,
[16:53] we read over there in the book of Luke
[16:54] where it said, "Virtue went out of him."
[16:58] That's right. If we're going to be like
[17:00] him, we must have virtue, then we must
[17:04] have it to be like him. Is the first
[17:06] song that I ever loved in the hymns, one
[17:08] of the greatest was to be like Jesus.
[17:10] Well, if I'm going to be like Jesus,
[17:13] I've got to have virtue and a pass that
[17:16] it can pass forward from me to the
[17:19] people. Because virtue went out of him
[17:22] to the people. Virtue. And before you
[17:24] can let it out, you've got to have it
[17:26] first. You haven't got it. It won't come
[17:28] out. There's nothing for it to come out
[17:31] of. Amen. And the next slide I think it
[17:34] is he says what if someone tried to draw
[17:37] virtue out of us and the check would
[17:39] return insufficient funds. See no none
[17:43] there to draw from that the check is
[17:45] bounce. And then he catch this here. He
[17:47] says somebody looking at and I spoke on
[17:49] this last time and this is kind of some
[17:51] of the notes that I that I wanted to get
[17:53] back to. He says somebody looking at you
[17:56] as a Christian and tomorrow seeing you
[18:00] out there carrying on like a sinner.
[18:01] There's not much virtue that can be
[18:03] drawn from that. See? Right. So, you
[18:06] know, we talked last time about the bear
[18:08] being bearers of fruit and how your life
[18:10] preaches a sermon and and your life is
[18:12] on display to the world. And if we're a
[18:15] uh if we're the type of people that are
[18:18] always trying to, you know, make excuses
[18:21] maybe to live life closer to the edge,
[18:23] you know, it can really show where we
[18:25] are spiritually. Um, you know, I don't I
[18:28] don't want to be like that. I want to
[18:29] live as close to the Lord as I can. And
[18:31] I want to have an excuse to do that.
[18:33] Amen. And just another simple analogy
[18:35] this morning, first Peter, he says,
[18:38] "Wherefore laying aside all malice and
[18:41] guile and hypocrisies and envys and evil
[18:44] speakings." So in that scripture,
[18:46] because the theme is is the maturing of
[18:49] sons and daughters this morning, right?
[18:51] So, but I wanted to stop and make a note
[18:53] on this verse cuz sometimes we don't
[18:57] even realize that we're stuck in a place
[19:00] because
[19:02] well, let me just read this. I wanted to
[19:04] It says laying aside all envys, you
[19:07] know. So, we're talking about growing
[19:09] and sometimes I think it's it's
[19:11] important to stop and appreciate where
[19:13] you are right now. I if you ever watch a
[19:17] baby that's drinking its milk, they are
[19:20] completely satisfied in what they're
[19:22] doing. You ever just see a baby, they
[19:24] want the milk and then once they have
[19:26] it, they're so content. They don't care
[19:28] about anything else. They don't care
[19:30] about any they don't care about
[19:32] tomorrow. They they don't have any uh
[19:34] anything else in their mind. They've got
[19:36] the milk. And sometimes I think we can
[19:39] get in these unhealthy habits of
[19:41] envying. You know, envying maybe where
[19:43] other people are. You know, envy is just
[19:46] being discontent with with yourself,
[19:48] being discontent with what we have. And
[19:52] you know, if you remember, you know,
[19:54] those that are married, you remember the
[19:55] honey honeymoon stage of marriage.
[19:57] Everything is fun, right? It's exciting.
[19:59] It's new. It's an adventure. And it's
[20:01] the same thing with our spiritual walk.
[20:03] There's this phase where we're drinking
[20:05] the pure milk of the word, right? Where
[20:08] everything is fresh and new and
[20:10] exciting. And [snorts]
[20:12] we have to remember to stop and enjoy
[20:15] the word that God is giving you in the
[20:18] season that you're in because we're all
[20:20] in different seasons. Amen. We're all in
[20:22] this. We're all growing into the
[20:25] fullness into the maturity that God
[20:27] wants us to be in. Amen. And we all may
[20:29] be in different stages. And that's okay.
[20:32] As long as you know you are where God
[20:34] wants you to be. Amen. So we have to
[20:36] always come back to that and say God are
[20:38] am I where you want me to be
[20:40] spiritually? Do I need maturity in my
[20:43] life? And whatever you want for me,
[20:46] Lord, help me to drink in that.
[20:47] Sometimes we're in a place where he's
[20:50] giving us the the the meat of revelation
[20:52] in our lives. But sometimes you're you
[20:54] need to be in a place where you're you
[20:58] need some simple things. The Lord is
[21:00] going to give you some milk because
[21:01] we're not going to be able to get these
[21:03] depths of revelation in our life if
[21:05] we're stumbling at simple areas, right?
[21:07] We're not going to be able to you want
[21:09] to have you want to soar into the depths
[21:11] of revelation, but what about the simple
[21:13] areas where God maybe is wanting to get
[21:15] you to get rid of this stumbling block
[21:17] in our in our lives or in our hearts? He
[21:19] wants to you can't you can't forget to
[21:22] enjoy the season that you're in and have
[21:24] discernment to know where you are spirit
[21:27] spiritually. Amen. Amen.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; You know, I used to think that it was um
[21:31] that that it would be some kind of a
[21:33] feeling of achievement when I would
[21:34] reach certain milestones. You know,
[21:36] maybe um when I would get to preach a
[21:38] certain number of years or or maybe
[21:40] being married a certain number of of
[21:42] years or, you know, h having my own home
[21:44] for a certain amount of time. And I
[21:46] think those things are well and good,
[21:47] but if you really dive into it, it's
[21:49] almost a form of envy if you're always
[21:51] looking to what's next
[21:53] &gt;&gt; because you're not ever enjoying where
[21:55] you are right now. If you're always if
[21:57] you're always looking down the road,
[21:59] what about right here right now? God is
[22:01] doing something in your life right here
[22:02] and right now. He wants to give you
[22:04] revelation in where you are at
[22:06] currently. And he will do that. But if
[22:09] you're always looking to the down the
[22:11] road now, we always, you know, there's
[22:12] you make sure that you're you're uh you
[22:15] have to have spiritual foresight. That's
[22:17] an important thing. You need to make
[22:19] sure that you are continuing to grow and
[22:21] continuing to mature. But if you're
[22:24] always looking down the road, you need
[22:26] to make sure to Lord, what are you doing
[22:28] in my life right now? Where where can I
[22:30] grow right now? I I I maybe I'm in a
[22:33] place where I need some some milk and I
[22:36] need you to feed it to me, Lord, because
[22:37] I don't even know where I'm at or what
[22:39] I'm doing. You know, I have this note
[22:41] here in in a few minutes, but Joy and I
[22:43] were talking about and there's this
[22:45] babies have this this uh reflex that if
[22:48] you give them too much food up to a
[22:51] certain age, if you give them a big too
[22:53] big of a bite or if you give them too
[22:55] much food, they actually have a natural
[22:57] reflex God gave them that where they'll
[22:58] spit that food out, right? Because they
[23:01] know that their bodies can't they don't
[23:03] know, but it's just a natural reflex.
[23:04] They'll spit it out. And the same thing
[23:06] happens in our life is, you know, maybe
[23:08] God is trying to give you a little bit
[23:09] of food and he knows you can't
[23:11] spiritually digest certain things yet.
[23:13] So, he's going to give you a little bit
[23:14] at a time. Amen. And so, enjoy what he's
[23:17] giving you and take in what he's giving
[23:19] you and then continue to progress and
[23:21] continue to move on. Amen.
[23:23] Um,
[23:29] and spiritually, you know, speaking, you
[23:31] can't can't skip the milk,
[23:34] [clears throat] right, and go right to
[23:35] the meat. [music]
[23:38] There's important nutrients.
[23:40] Um [music]
[23:43] the next verse in that in that verse
[23:46] that we read second Peter I believe it's
[23:49] the second chapter it says as newborn
[23:51] babies desire the sincere milk of the
[23:56] word that ye may grow thereby.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; So God does want us to grow into mature
[24:03] believers. He want he does want to
[24:06] unveil more of himself to us. But if you
[24:08] think about a little child, you know,
[24:11] you wouldn't want to give um I had just
[24:14] thought about this yesterday. You
[24:15] wouldn't want to give a, you know, a
[24:16] little child, especially that's one or,
[24:18] you know, one and a half, you wouldn't
[24:20] want to give them something sharp,
[24:21] right? Because they wouldn't know how to
[24:23] handle it. You give a baby knife because
[24:26] of what stage they're in, they're going
[24:27] to want to put it in their mouth and
[24:29] that you can't do that. They're going to
[24:30] they're going to harm themselves with
[24:32] the sharpness of that blade, right? But
[24:34] the wonderful thing about maturing is th
[24:36] those sharp objects. Once they can be
[24:38] handled properly, they serve a wonderful
[24:41] purpose, right? It's what we use to open
[24:44] things with packages and gifts. And as
[24:46] that little child develops, you begin to
[24:48] teach them how to handle sharp objects.
[24:50] And eventually, they'll be able to use
[24:52] it for themselves naturally,
[24:54] spiritually, when we're nurtured by the
[24:56] milk of God's word. And we can lay aside
[25:00] some of those immature behaviors. So
[25:02] there he talked about four or five
[25:03] specific things in that last verse. Um
[25:06] he's trying to rid us of those immature
[25:08] behaviors and maybe it's a little bit of
[25:10] envy towards our brother or our sister
[25:13] or you know envy is a form of
[25:15] discontent. Maybe discontent with where
[25:17] you are. Paul says being content finding
[25:20] myself to be content in whatever I have
[25:22] whether it's plenty or whether it's
[25:24] none. So making sure that we can lay
[25:26] aside that envy. Um or guile. Guile is
[25:29] another one that they mentioned which is
[25:31] when you try maybe try to deceive people
[25:33] or even maybe deceive yourself into
[25:36] thinking that you're further along than
[25:37] you really are. Maybe you need to step,
[25:39] you know, step back a little bit and
[25:41] say, "Lord, you know, I feel like I'm
[25:42] not progressing. Lord, is there
[25:44] something in my life that's displeasing
[25:45] to you because I want to continue to
[25:47] progress?" Now, that's an important
[25:49] question. Amen. Um the serpent, just for
[25:52] an example, the serpent used guile to
[25:54] deceive Eve, right? because there was a
[25:55] lot of truth in what he was saying but
[25:58] the intent was negative. Right? So
[26:01] that's another one. Or another one it
[26:03] would be these immature behaviors.
[26:05] Hypocrisy. And that's a big one. The
[26:07] practice of pretending to have moral
[26:10] standards, beliefs or principles that
[26:12] one does not actually possess. So
[26:15] someone who says one thing but then does
[26:18] another. Right? someone who says they
[26:20] love the Lord but maybe their their
[26:22] actions aren't proving that or maybe
[26:25] there's something you know there we
[26:27] don't want to be hypocrites nobody wants
[26:29] that right but sometimes you know we
[26:31] have to really search out our heart and
[26:33] if there is some form of that in your
[26:35] heart you know you're you're saying one
[26:38] thing but then your life is not lining
[26:39] up then what's missing here Lord help me
[26:42] to know what's missing so that I can
[26:43] continue to progress right amen see
[26:46] because God God looks at our
[26:49] and and he knows he knows we have a
[26:52] sinful nature, right? He knows that
[26:53] we're predisposed to immature things
[26:57] like that. But the point is
[27:00] &gt;&gt; because he knows that he has made a way
[27:03] to get past those things, right?
[27:05] Sometimes it just takes a little bit of
[27:07] humility, stepping down from our pride
[27:08] and saying, "Lord, well, I did I messed
[27:10] up or I said this or I did this. Lord,
[27:12] help me to to to move past that." Amen.
[27:16] Um,
[27:20] he knows what stage we're at and he
[27:22] knows what we can spiritually digest.
[27:25] Um,
[27:27] and and as he begins to as he begins to
[27:31] reveal things to us and as as we begin
[27:33] to to get more revelation in our lives,
[27:37] um, you know, something that maybe at
[27:40] one point
[27:42] in our spiritual walk, we couldn't
[27:44] exactly handle it like like that baby
[27:47] that couldn't handle the knife. Maybe we
[27:49] couldn't handle it or or we couldn't
[27:50] appreciate its full value. That's that's
[27:52] a better way to look at it. We couldn't
[27:53] appreciate the full value of a
[27:55] revelation that God is trying to give
[27:57] you in your life. But as you begin to
[27:58] progress and mature in your life, you
[28:00] begin to put value. Wow. Lord, thank you
[28:03] for showing me that. Lord, thank you for
[28:05] bringing me from this place that I saw
[28:07] that I had this maybe behavior or I saw
[28:10] that I had this guile or I saw that I
[28:12] had this hypocrisy. Thank you for
[28:14] showing that to me, Lord, and then
[28:16] correcting me of it. Amen. Amen.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; Um,
[28:21] and God begins to see, just like you
[28:22] can't give the new baby strong meat, God
[28:24] begins to see that we're able to handle
[28:27] the word with more maturity, right? That
[28:29] we're able to yield our members a little
[28:31] bit more than we used to. And then God
[28:34] begins to give you more of his word. He
[28:36] begins to show you how to handle it
[28:38] properly and unwrap the word in your
[28:40] life. Amen. Um,
[28:46] so that begins to help us develop to
[28:50] this next stage that Peter talks about,
[28:53] brother Brandham talks about in the
[28:55] stature of a perfect man, which is godly
[28:57] knowledge, which I think this is
[28:59] probably I'm going to stop here in just
[29:00] a minute here, but um, this quote is so
[29:03] good. He says
[29:05] um, it might be on the slide. I'm not
[29:07] sure if I put this one up. Now there
[29:09] will be another thing on this knowledge
[29:10] that we might speak of godly knowledge.
[29:13] He has the Bible in the in this day lost
[29:17] its meaning. See a lot of people tell
[29:19] you that that the Bible doesn't exactly
[29:21] mean that. If God watches over me and
[29:24] corrects me in my life and if I'm a son
[29:26] of God he does that. He does you that
[29:28] way. Sons and daughters when you do
[29:30] anything wrong he corrects you right?
[29:33] Then if God is so particular about you
[29:38] and that he watches over you and
[29:40] corrects you, how much more has he his
[29:43] word which is your example which is
[29:47] himself. Amen. In the beginning was the
[29:49] word. The word was with God and the word
[29:51] was God. He says and then made flesh and
[29:53] dwelt among us. The word is the
[29:56] revelation of Jesus Christ. Uh the Bible
[29:59] said so Christ being revealed in his
[30:01] word. And if he has watched over you
[30:03] when you transgress these laws, he
[30:05] condemns you for it. How much more has
[30:08] he watched over his law that condemns
[30:10] you? Amen. And he says, he says, I
[30:14] believe in genuine Holy Ghost knowledge.
[30:17] Holy Ghost knowledge will punctuate the
[30:20] word with amen. When you get these
[30:22] things that seem to contradict
[30:24] themselves in the Bible, you sit down
[30:26] and study it out and prayerfully like
[30:27] that. And the first thing you know, the
[30:30] Holy Spirit begins to move in. And after
[30:33] a while, you see it ties together. There
[30:35] you got it. See the knowledge. So that
[30:39] going into now this knowledge, this next
[30:41] this next spiritual building block. What
[30:43] does it mean to punctuate the word?
[30:45] That's the end of the slides. Thanks,
[30:47] brother. Uh what does it mean to
[30:48] punctuate the word with with an amen? It
[30:51] means that as the Lord reveals himself
[30:52] to you and he takes you through these
[30:54] seasons of growth and maturity,
[30:56] sometimes that means that he brings you
[30:58] into a place in your life or in your
[30:59] heart where maybe you've been doing or
[31:02] saying something wrong or maybe it's
[31:03] people that you've been associating with
[31:05] and the Holy Spirit begins to move and
[31:07] show you that it's time to leave those
[31:10] things behind, right? Because God wants
[31:12] to take you further. Amen. There's this
[31:14] quote and I don't have it here, but he
[31:16] said it says if there's a thirst for
[31:18] more of God, then there's got to be more
[31:21] of God to fulfill that thirst. Right?
[31:24] So, if there's a thirst for more of God
[31:25] in your life, he's an ever ex brother
[31:27] Jason says, he's an ever expounding God.
[31:30] You know, there's no way we could ever
[31:32] fully grasp him. So, there's always
[31:34] going to be more of God for you in your
[31:35] life. Amen. Um, [snorts]
[31:37] and he wants to take you further, but
[31:40] he'll never do that. He'll never he'll
[31:42] never he'll never continue to progress
[31:44] you if we're too stubborn to give up
[31:46] these things. Amen. So So punctuating
[31:48] the word with an amen happens when the
[31:50] Lord shows you the right steps to take,
[31:52] the right path to go down and you listen
[31:55] and you heed the word and then your life
[31:57] begins to slowly measure up to the word,
[32:00] right? Amen. We begin to start
[32:02] reflecting him. Like brother Benham
[32:04] said, we begin to start reflecting his
[32:05] life in our life. Um
[32:10] let's see. I just have another minute or
[32:12] two here.
[32:14] I'll just finish with this. He says,
[32:17] um, "Will you take that? Will you take
[32:20] us that's nothing but a wild gourd?" He
[32:22] says, "An notthead." See, there's
[32:23] nothing to us for we're dead in sin and
[32:26] trespasses. We're in all these kinds of
[32:28] condition. And then we oursel can
[32:31] prostrate ourselves, give ourselves up
[32:34] until God takes his transfusion tube,
[32:37] the name of Jesus Christ.
[32:40] And you actually there's a part of you
[32:43] that actually takes you you take part in
[32:46] this because prostrating means that we
[32:48] lay ourselves out on the ground face up
[32:51] and and in reverence or in submission.
[32:53] So we lay our we lay down those habits.
[32:56] We lay down our desires and then he says
[32:59] that the life of Christ transfers into
[33:02] us. Then we can have this kind of faith
[33:04] that Christ had. And he he makes this
[33:06] comment, Christ's faith was not based in
[33:09] those Pharisees or Sadducees or in their
[33:12] kettles and pots and pans and washings.
[33:14] And this contrast that he makes with the
[33:15] Pharisees, the faith that the Pharisees
[33:17] had was not a genuine faith because they
[33:20] didn't prostrate themselves. They had
[33:22] pride mingled in, right? They they knew
[33:25] everything. They they they had the law,
[33:28] but they couldn't be taught. And when
[33:30] when you prostrate yourselves, it's a
[33:32] sincere act of humility, an act of
[33:34] submission. But for them, it was a show.
[33:37] And Jesus discerned their heart in that.
[33:39] He discerned the the reality that was
[33:41] living in their hearts. It was works. It
[33:43] was the law of God, but it didn't have
[33:45] the spirit of God. And that's the vital
[33:48] thing is the spirit of God then makes
[33:50] the law manifest in your life. It lives
[33:53] in your members and then it's lived out
[33:56] through our lives. Because what happened
[33:58] with them is is they had the law and
[34:00] they tried to live it themselves without
[34:02] the spirit bringing forth the law. And
[34:04] if you do it that way, and a lot of
[34:06] times people can get in that way, they
[34:07] get they live it as a church member and
[34:09] they they see the message and they they
[34:11] can say it intellectually, oh, that
[34:13] makes sense. But unless they get that
[34:14] person living on the inside of their
[34:16] soul that can actually live out of them,
[34:19] then then they're doing it the way of a
[34:21] Pharisee would do it. And we'd never
[34:23] want to live like a Pharisee would.
[34:25] Amen. All right, let's pray. Heavenly
[34:27] Father, we just want to thank you for
[34:28] the uh just this little lesson this
[34:30] morning. We just pray that you just be
[34:32] with the musicians as they come out.
[34:33] Lord, may your spirit just come and
[34:35] speak to our hearts and Lord, just uh
[34:37] help us today. We pray in Jesus name.
[34:39] Amen.
