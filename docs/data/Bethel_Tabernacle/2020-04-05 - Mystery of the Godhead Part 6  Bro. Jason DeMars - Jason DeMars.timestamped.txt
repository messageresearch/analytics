[1:38] [Music]

[3:02] our half-hour Sunday school now and I'm
[3:05] going to be covering mystery of the
[3:08] Godhead part six and before we do that
[3:12] we're gonna pray
[3:14] gracious father you're the same
[3:18] yesterday today and forever
[3:20] you never change you always remain the
[3:25] same Lord and therefore we understand
[3:27] that you are completely sovereign you
[3:31] are in control of everything that
[3:33] happens and you have a purpose in
[3:36] everything that happens and Lord whether
[3:40] the this this thing is of course that's
[3:45] going around the world is from the devil
[3:48] you do not bring sickness and yet it was
[3:52] your purpose to permit it Lord and it is
[3:57] part of your great program for your
[3:59] church for your bride to produce
[4:02] something in us Lord for your glory and
[4:06] we're confident in that and we just say
[4:09] Lord we submit ourselves to you we ask
[4:13] that you would do with us as you will
[4:15] guide us direct us protect us keep your
[4:19] hand upon us and go before us
[4:21] continually father and and just work
[4:25] those things within our soul out which
[4:28] are necessary Lord nothing happens by
[4:32] chance your hand is upon this whole
[4:35] thing
[4:36] to glorify yourself and to work
[4:39] something out in our lives that we would
[4:41] be more like Jesus Christ so we commit
[4:43] ourselves to you in this time in Jesus
[4:46] name Amen so we're gonna continue on and
[4:51] looking at the last verse that we
[4:54] covered in our last Sunday school 2nd
[4:57] Corinthians chapter 4 verse 6 for God
[5:01] who commanded the light to shine out of
[5:03] darkness has shined in our hearts to
[5:05] give the light of the knowledge of the
[5:07] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[5:11] so I just want to encourage everyone if
[5:14] this is your first time listening to
[5:18] this series go back and listen to the
[5:21] other ones although it makes sense now
[5:24] it'll make more sense if you watch the
[5:27] other five so we see here this word face
[5:32] in the Greek espresso pwned and we look
[5:37] at this Pro so pone means front towards
[5:41] the view or face theologians over time
[5:47] during the church early church age
[5:51] period started to change the meaning of
[5:54] this word into the word person but that
[5:59] is not correct the original meaning in
[6:01] the Greek is quite different Jesus
[6:07] Christ is the face that God is hidden
[6:12] behind and revealed through so we are
[6:17] the were given the knowledge of the
[6:20] light of the glory of God in the face of
[6:24] Jesus Christ so light and glory are then
[6:31] hidden behind Jesus Christ but not just
[6:35] hidden revealed also so he he hides
[6:40] himself behind the face of Jesus Christ
[6:45] that which is toward the view it's
[6:47] similar to the word image
[6:49] but with a different connotation image
[6:55] is that which is making that which is
[6:57] invisible made visible face is is a
[7:01] similar thing that it's like saying
[7:03] someone has hidden behind this in order
[7:08] to reveal himself through that there's
[7:10] an actor acting through a mask through a
[7:14] face this face is Jesus Christ so it's
[7:19] the the glory of God
[7:21] what's the glory of God the shin in
[7:24] Hebrew its Shekinah what is that
[7:27] that's the logos that supernatural light
[7:30] that began to form in the very beginning
[7:34] that is made visible to the world
[7:39] through Jesus Christ now okay today we
[7:43] don't see Jesus Christ do we he's seated
[7:47] on the throne he's interceding we're
[7:50] unable to see him face to face there'll
[7:53] be a day we do see him face to face we
[7:55] can't wait for that day we're living our
[7:57] life for that day but we don't see him
[8:00] face to face now so how is Paul writing
[8:02] here two Corinthians who never saw Jesus
[8:05] and says you're the light of the
[8:08] knowledge of the glory of God is seen by
[8:12] you in the face of Jesus Christ well we
[8:16] have his name he lived upon this earth
[8:19] he was preached we have his nature what
[8:23] he was like what Jesus is like is not
[8:25] different than what God is like it's the
[8:27] very same nature only made visible but
[8:31] then go further than that what is our
[8:33] what is our hope what is our hope of
[8:36] glory well we're hoping we're looking
[8:39] for something that we don't have the
[8:41] hope of glory
[8:42] what is it it's Christ in you the hope
[8:46] of glory so what is it today how do how
[8:49] is Jesus Christ made visible today how
[8:52] do we see the light of the glory of God
[8:53] Christ in you Christ in his bride
[8:57] so how has he made visible in the bride
[9:01] man so God changed his face he didn't
[9:09] change his nature but he changed his
[9:12] mask he went from that invisible spirit
[9:16] to that logos that supernatural light
[9:19] then he became flesh in Jesus Christ
[9:25] it's not too Pro soap owns it's not
[9:28] multiple persons as they try to say it's
[9:32] two masks actually it's three masks if
[9:35] we want to look at it completely Father
[9:38] Son and Holy Ghost that's three
[9:39] different masks that God took on and
[9:41] there's a bigger picture to go on that
[9:43] as well but and we'll get into that
[9:45] later but let's look at this Alister
[9:48] McGrath theologian and historian pretty
[9:52] tremendous popular scholar in the
[9:56] denominational world he's writing in
[9:59] this about the doctrine of Tertullian
[10:02] one of the early church fathers the
[10:04] first one to use the word Trinity
[10:06] okay so understand he's the first person
[10:09] that used the word Trinity did he mean
[10:12] three persons three separate and
[10:14] distinct and Co eternal persons let's
[10:17] look what he says this is Alister
[10:20] McGrath writing the term person
[10:22] literally means a mask such as that worn
[10:25] by an actor in a Roman drama at this
[10:28] time actors were masked to allow the
[10:30] audience's to understand which of the
[10:32] different characters in the drama they
[10:33] were playing the term persona of us came
[10:37] to have a developed meaning along the
[10:40] lines of the role that someone is
[10:42] playing it is quite possible that
[10:44] Tertullian wanted his readers to
[10:46] understand the idea of one substance
[10:48] substance three persons he says persons
[10:52] 3 personas that's different it's not the
[10:55] same thing one substance three persons
[10:58] to mean that the one God played three
[11:02] distinct yet related roles in the great
[11:04] drama of human Redemption behind the
[11:07] plurality of roles three roles lay a
[11:10] single actor the complexity of the
[11:13] process of creation and redemption
[11:15] did not imply that there were many gods
[11:18] three gods simply that there was one God
[11:21] who acted in a multiplicity of manners
[11:24] within the economy of salvation three
[11:29] roles that God played Father Son and
[11:32] Holy Spirit one person he said there are
[11:36] three persons that's not what Tertullian
[11:38] was saying two trillion was saying three
[11:41] personas which is completely different
[11:43] it's the role that an actor played we're
[11:47] perso pone if we saw that word before
[11:50] that's also been turned into person
[11:52] speaks of the mask so one speaks of the
[11:56] mask the other speaks of the role that's
[11:58] being played so there's a there's see
[12:00] see the distinction there between those
[12:02] two things very close but different so
[12:08] we're gonna go back and we're gonna
[12:09] finish the second part of the Athanasian
[12:12] Creed now this is what is accepted by
[12:15] all major denominations all the Catholic
[12:19] churches etc this is the main Creed it
[12:22] came in about the the fifth century it
[12:25] was put together the the the historian
[12:29] athenais shish who lived in the 300s he
[12:31] did not write it they wrote it and
[12:33] dedicated it to him because he was such
[12:35] a defender of trinitarianism okay so
[12:38] Athanasian wrote that we went through
[12:40] the first part of it which is about the
[12:41] Godhead the second part now is about
[12:44] Christ and you're gonna see in here
[12:46] there are some things in the Athanasian
[12:49] Creed that are very strange there and
[12:53] there's some things that are close to
[12:56] being true and now and I'm I'm gonna
[12:58] read through it and then we're gonna
[12:59] talk about it but its necessary for
[13:02] eternal salvation that one also believe
[13:05] in the incarnation of our Lord Jesus
[13:07] Christ faithfully in other words you
[13:10] have to believe it the way we teach it
[13:11] if they believe it correctly according
[13:14] to our understanding otherwise you can't
[13:16] be saved now this is the true faith that
[13:19] we believe in confess that our Lord
[13:21] Jesus Christ God's Son is both God and
[13:24] human equally no problem
[13:27] he is God from the essence of the Father
[13:30] begotten before time okay so now they're
[13:34] separating they're saying there's two
[13:37] there's there's two persons God the
[13:40] Father and the son their separate button
[13:44] before time so he's he is you and then
[13:47] he says and he's human from the essence
[13:49] of his mother born in time we're gonna
[13:53] address that momentarily completely God
[13:56] completely human find no problem
[13:59] with a rational soul and human flesh no
[14:02] problem equal to the Father as regards
[14:04] divinity some error there less than the
[14:07] father as regards humanity absolutely
[14:10] although he is God in human yet Christ
[14:13] is not two but one he is one however not
[14:17] by his divinity being turned into flesh
[14:19] but by God's taking humanity to himself
[14:22] sure he's one certainly not by the
[14:25] blending of his essence but by the unity
[14:28] of his person for just as one human is
[14:30] both rational soul and flesh so to the
[14:33] one Christ is both God and human so
[14:40] three significant events of Jesus life
[14:43] if we look at that who Jesus is through
[14:47] that lens we'll start to understand the
[14:50] big picture better I would I would say
[14:53] regarding that last portion of the
[14:56] Athanasian Creed is is that what they're
[14:59] what they're doing is they're creating
[15:01] their own pigeonhole and this is that
[15:07] this is exactly how we have to view
[15:10] things and also what we are the points
[15:13] that we argue from so then we're gonna
[15:15] argue from these points and of course
[15:17] everyone logically has to agree with
[15:18] this because we're starting here and
[15:21] what as Christians we're saying is we
[15:23] need to start from here we don't start
[15:27] from the creed and then go from there we
[15:29] start from the scripture itself and go
[15:33] from there and so when when you start to
[15:37] see that you start to see that there's a
[15:40] a worldview that they're putting on top
[15:43] up they put in the early church they put
[15:45] it on top of the Bible okay and they
[15:48] said this is how we have to see things
[15:50] through this see the Bible through this
[15:53] lens and if you don't see it this way
[15:56] you're a heretic and we cast you out now
[15:58] I'm gonna back up a second and say that
[16:02] did you realize that this was politics
[16:07] this was politicians that orchestrated
[16:11] and controlled these councils that's
[16:14] indisputable history they were not holy
[16:17] ghost Christians that felt that did this
[16:19] they weren't this didn't even come as a
[16:22] result of prayer this came because
[16:25] politicians saw Christianity is growing
[16:29] who was behind the politician what
[16:33] spirit Antichrist spirit even even in
[16:37] the year 90 Don is saying the spirit of
[16:40] Antichrist is already working he's
[16:45] already at work and so what about two
[16:47] hundred and fifteen years later 225
[16:50] years later is he stopped working no he
[16:54] continues to work and we look and see
[16:57] the Nicene council Constantine says
[17:00] Christianity is splitting up into two
[17:02] and this is gonna split up my empire
[17:05] well God split up his empire anyway but
[17:09] this is splitting up I my empire and
[17:11] I've got a unite everyone otherwise this
[17:12] is gonna become a war looking at it from
[17:14] political side we can't have two
[17:18] versions of Christianity going on well
[17:20] what he did created thousands of them
[17:23] they didn't wait on the Holy Ghost
[17:25] they didn't pray they didn't seek the
[17:27] Lord a politician said bishops come here
[17:30] we have to make a decision who has the
[17:33] right doctrine is it Arius or is it the
[17:38] Trinitarians
[17:39] who is correct about this and remember
[17:42] who writes the history the one that wins
[17:47] and who controls who's now the bishops
[17:52] the
[17:53] side that wins and they have politicians
[17:57] behind them to enforce that no and so
[18:02] what happened what happens is slowly any
[18:04] holy ghost pastor is ousted he's
[18:09] arrested and then who comes in his place
[18:10] a Trinitarian bishop what happens to the
[18:16] writings of the previous pastor and the
[18:18] different Holy Ghost men of God during
[18:20] those times in the fire do we have a
[18:23] really reliable history of Christianity
[18:26] I doubt it I very much doubt it we have
[18:30] hints and glimmers of it here and there
[18:34] okay so then we come to that stage where
[18:37] they're where they're bringing this this
[18:39] council they put together what it is and
[18:43] this side wins the other side is cast
[18:45] aside well guess what about a hundred
[18:48] and thirty-five years later a new
[18:51] Emperor arises and guess what he don't
[18:53] like the Trinity so what does he do he
[18:59] does the same thing the Trinitarians did
[19:01] and he'd opposes the bishops he'd
[19:05] opposes everyone that he possibly can
[19:07] and he puts in their place Aryan bishops
[19:11] and pastors that's a whole nother issue
[19:13] I don't want to get into it it's it's
[19:16] that there are none it's a
[19:17] nontrinitarian belief that puts Jesus as
[19:20] begotten before time but he was an angel
[19:22] and not God and they have some aspects
[19:25] that they understand correctly and they
[19:27] have a lot of aspects they understand
[19:29] incorrectly but that's not my purpose
[19:33] here is to show this what spirit was
[19:35] behind that if you say that was the
[19:40] Spirit of God orchestrating those things
[19:41] we under your view of what the church is
[19:45] and what who Christ is is incorrect
[19:49] Christ didn't never moved by politics
[19:53] why did he do what did Jesus do when he
[19:56] came he rebuked politics he rebuked
[20:00] religion he stood outside and he said
[20:03] come to me what did his
[20:07] Bibles do they came behind and they made
[20:10] deals with politics they said we better
[20:12] obey God rather than men you can kill us
[20:15] you could throw us in prison but we're
[20:17] gonna have obeyed God and we're gonna
[20:18] have nothing to do with this politics
[20:21] and they preach the word and they said
[20:24] come to Jesus he's the one that saves
[20:26] they made no deals with politicians they
[20:29] made they made no work to use politics
[20:34] to further the gospel they did not do
[20:38] that
[20:38] that's Antichrist spirit that does that
[20:40] what spirit was working at the Council
[20:42] of Nicaea any Christian should be able
[20:47] to recognize it was the spirit of
[20:49] Antichrist that is not a radical idea if
[20:53] even if you're a Protestant you should
[20:57] realize that you should understand what
[20:59] spirit if you're a Protestant do you
[21:00] believe that a bishop should be in
[21:02] charge of a hundred different churches
[21:05] in a metropolitan area no you don't
[21:07] believe that and yet that's what the
[21:09] Council of Nicaea did and they also made
[21:12] Jesus a second person of the Godhead a
[21:15] second co-equal Co eternal person and
[21:19] then as it continued on we have the
[21:21] Council of Constantinople what did they
[21:23] do there it was run by a pret an elder
[21:25] of the city who was not even a Christian
[21:29] and and you can you can do the research
[21:32] yourself find out what else what other
[21:34] doctrines that they put in place as
[21:37] mandatory for the church at those
[21:39] councils wasn't just Trinitarian
[21:42] doctrine it was many other things that
[21:44] 90% of Christians say that's Antichrist
[21:47] that's against God and yet they want to
[21:50] take the other part of it too come on
[21:52] believers come on Christians are we
[21:54] Bible believers forget you say but I
[21:58] know people that are nice I do too
[22:00] probably nicer than me but I know people
[22:04] that they're good Christians they're
[22:05] solid this they're the they teach the
[22:07] Bible they do this this is between you
[22:10] and God
[22:10] has nothing to do with what your friend
[22:14] believes your pastor believes it is
[22:16] about you and God in this book
[22:20] what is true I'm not asking you to
[22:23] abandon something I'm asking you simply
[22:26] to embrace this and let God lead your
[22:30] path the scripture is the final
[22:33] authority and we have to come back to
[22:36] the scripture and how does God speak to
[22:39] the church and deal with the church
[22:41] through history he does not work through
[22:44] councils he does not work even through
[22:47] pastors per se of course he works
[22:50] through pastors I'm not saying that but
[22:52] the word of the Lord does not come to
[22:54] the pastor says surely the Lord God will
[22:58] do nothing except he reveals his secrets
[23:01] to his servants the prophets through the
[23:05] church ages in all the Bible we only
[23:08] have one place that shows us a prophetic
[23:11] viewpoint of the church age that's in
[23:16] Revelation chapter two and three it
[23:19] speaks of seven different periods of
[23:21] time and each of those periods of time
[23:24] the letter is written to the Angel of
[23:26] the church it's not written to an
[23:28] heavenly angel what need do they have of
[23:30] that it's written to the pastor or the
[23:33] bishop or really the messenger of the
[23:36] age so the messenger to Ephesus the
[23:41] messenger to Sardis the messenger to
[23:44] Thea tyre or the messenger to
[23:45] Philadelphia the messenger to Laodicea
[23:47] and then that messenger is to bring that
[23:50] message to the Church of that age and
[23:52] then he that has an ear to hear let him
[23:56] hear let him hear
[23:59] I'm not trying to decrease chin eyes
[24:00] anybody I'm not trying to tell you turn
[24:03] against this person turn against that
[24:04] person I'm saying turn to Christ Christ
[24:08] is the word boy will never never quite
[24:14] get to this but I'm gonna just speed
[24:15] through a couple things the birth the
[24:17] baptism and the crucifixion of Jesus
[24:20] Christ are three significant event
[24:22] events in his life that reveal who he is
[24:27] if you understand them correctly in the
[24:30] Bible then all the Greek philosophy to
[24:33] Trinity
[24:34] arian box that they want to put you in
[24:36] easily slides away the false doctrine of
[24:40] the Trinity seeks to force us in those
[24:42] into those boxes that were drawn up 400
[24:45] years after the death of the Jewish
[24:47] apostles so let's look at the birth of
[24:50] Jesus this is something that we know
[24:53] every Sun comes from the genes of his
[24:56] father and mother every son issues forth
[24:59] from his father and mother every son has
[25:02] the has the nature front of their father
[25:06] and mother by genetics we all are born
[25:10] in sin and shaped an iniquity why
[25:13] because her mom and dad was and on to
[25:16] the original progenitors and so that's
[25:20] not just our nature that are the color
[25:22] of our hair the color of our eyes what
[25:26] our face looks like it's that's even to
[25:28] our personality that's even to the
[25:31] things that we like and dislike it
[25:34] accounts for our nature as well Hebrews
[25:39] 7 9 and as many as I may so say Levi
[25:43] also who receive tithe paid tithes in
[25:46] Abraham so Levi was in Abraham his
[25:52] great-grandfather and so that that what
[25:56] Abraham did was accounted to Levi on the
[26:00] on the positive side on the negative
[26:03] side is whatever Adam did is accounted
[26:07] to us as well Hebrews 2 10 and 11 for it
[26:11] was fitting that he for whom and by whom
[26:13] are all all things exist in bringing
[26:16] many sons to glory should make the
[26:17] founder of their salvation perfect
[26:18] through suffering for he who sanctifies
[26:21] and those who are sanctified all have
[26:23] one source that is why is not to shame a
[26:26] shame to call them brothers we come from
[26:28] one source I want to back up and go
[26:31] before I close here and say what was
[26:34] God's original purpose for man and woman
[26:37] that he created them for what were they
[26:41] he said I'm gonna make you in my image
[26:43] and likeness what does that mean it
[26:47] means that
[26:48] God was now gonna have offspring that
[26:51] were a perfect reflection of his nature
[26:53] so we could say and be very scriptural
[26:58] about it is that these were sons of God
[27:01] so what is it it's a it's a god race not
[27:06] race as in color of skin but in other
[27:08] words it's a group of people that are to
[27:11] be the a reflective of the nature of God
[27:13] that are to be God on earth
[27:17] no they're not God but the life of God
[27:22] is to be in them and expressed through
[27:25] them so that when you see them you're
[27:26] seeing God okay so that's you know in a
[27:32] sense we look at that and see and we say
[27:34] even the humanity the human nature of
[27:38] Adam and Eve was what was to be God
[27:44] again not the eternal God not the
[27:46] Creator we're not talking about New Age
[27:51] mysticism we're talking about the life
[27:53] that's coming forth if you're a son you
[27:57] have the life of your father you're a
[27:59] daughter you have the you get what I'm
[28:02] saying and so that life is in you in
[28:06] your to express and manifest the life
[28:10] that's in you which is for Adam and Eve
[28:14] that was God so there to express the
[28:17] life of God they have divine life in
[28:20] them they have divinity within them oh
[28:24] now you're saying they're God they can
[28:26] create no there's the only path to
[28:32] expressing God is not enlightenment its
[28:35] submission and surrender and today it's
[28:38] repentance it's giving your and a
[28:41] continual repentance we're not talking
[28:44] about some mystic viewpoint we're
[28:47] talking about Scripture and the life
[28:50] that's to be expressed so that the life
[28:52] of the sons of God is God himself
[28:59] acts 20:28 take heed therefore unto
[29:02] yourselves and to all the flock over the
[29:04] which the Holy Ghost has made you
[29:06] overseers to feed the Church of God
[29:08] which he has purchased with his own
[29:11] blood Wow
[29:16] so God purchased the church with his own
[29:20] blood but I thought God was a spirit so
[29:24] here we can understand the birth of
[29:26] Jesus when Jesus was born that Creed
[29:30] said that he was human because of his
[29:32] mother if he was human because of his
[29:35] mother what would he be then he would be
[29:39] a sinner because his mother was sorry
[29:41] Catholics Mary was a sinner she said she
[29:45] had need of a savior and so she would
[29:51] have given that sinful nature to Jesus
[29:53] Christ God had to bypass that completely
[29:57] otherwise it wouldn't be the blood of
[29:59] God it'd be the blood of Mary it's not
[30:02] the blood were not saved by the blood of
[30:03] Mary we're not saved by Jewish blood
[30:07] Gentile blood were saved by the blood of
[30:10] God well you say God doesn't have blood
[30:13] only humans have blood what was the life
[30:16] what was the genetics what was the DNA
[30:19] whose DNA did Jesus have coursing
[30:22] through his veins not Mary's he had the
[30:27] blood of God the life and genetics of
[30:31] God were in him so that from the very
[30:33] time he conceived that was God in the
[30:38] womb at the same time that was a man
[30:43] that was the that was the son of God he
[30:47] he had a time that he began he was the
[30:51] beginning of the creation of God brother
[30:53] Branham says when did he begin in the
[30:54] wombs of a virgin bloom of a woman he
[30:58] God creating himself in human flesh God
[31:03] in the first born but also God in the
[31:08] many sons which come to glory they come
[31:10] to different ways
[31:11] so it's the it's the very life of God
[31:14] that was in Jesus the very genetics the
[31:18] very DNA of the almighty himself was
[31:22] there I feel like that's a terrible
[31:24] place to close there's much more to say
[31:27] but you just be gracious to me and we'll
[31:30] continue this next time and let's pray
[31:34] father we just come to you Lord and
[31:36] we're so thankful for the truth of your
[31:39] scripture we love the word and we ask
[31:42] that you'd shake our hearts and minds by
[31:44] it Lord we know we're saved by the blood
[31:47] of God we also know that you're a spirit
[31:50] that you are the Creator that you're not
[31:54] limited by a body of flesh and yet you
[31:59] pour yourself into a body of flesh that
[32:01] you might be made seen and manifested
[32:05] amongst the world Lord and you were
[32:08] manifested in fullness in the first born
[32:12] and you're manifested in every son which
[32:15] comes to you
[32:17] Lord we we need more of you reveal
[32:21] yourself more and more Lord we
[32:23] understand that this isn't just human
[32:26] teaching Lord but it takes a revelation
[32:30] from the Spirit of God into each heart
[32:33] lord please quicken yourself into us
[32:36] Lord that you know that your the fruits
[32:39] of your spirit would be manifested and
[32:41] displayed within we commit ourselves to
[32:43] you in the name of Jesus Christ amen god
[32:47] bless you
[32:57] what a resurrection that that was and
[33:02] water resurrection this is to be
[33:05] quickened from the dead to be made alive
[33:08] in Christ Jesus but God Quinton house
