========================================

let's uh stand and we'll have a word of prayer and read a scripture dear father ask that you would come down to this in our little service your father that you would take these few words that i have that's real simple simple little thought that you put on my heart and that maybe it wouldn't help the people father to fight the devil when they leave the church doors that they would be able to combat this wicked day a little bit more effectively and just these few simple words father you would be able to touch the needs of the people that have father we ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and while while we're standing we'll go ahead and read a scripture um turn to the book of matthew chapter 23 and verse 23 and uh wait for all right wait for y'all to turn and uh this is woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cumin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought you to have done and not leave the other undone you all can be seated um so i'd like to now take well first of all um the section my title for this morning is the weightier matters of the law um that's my title but maybe as a as sort of like a theme maybe like a topic kind of um just sort of the the the what i had in my mind um was this idea of carnality versus legalism there's always kind of the the the grand struggle of any christian i i particularly like the depiction of this in pilgrim's progress when pilgrim is uh or when christian is is crawling i believe was through the valley of shadow of death and on one side was legalism and the other side was was i forgot what they called it in the book but effectively legalism and carnality and one wrong step up to one side or one wrong sex with the other they both go down to the same pit um and but that's always kind of the the struggle of the christians to not go off one side of the other to always remain that keep that balance um but i would like to turn to um uh isaiah chapter one and we'll start at verse one um i apologize i already apologize to josh this morning i'm gonna be jumping all over on the scriptures so uh y'all don't have to turn i got it all on my tablet here so um uh well i'm sorry not verse one verse seven i apologize um ah there we go it says your country is desolate your cities are burned with fire your lands strangers devour it in your presence and it is desolate as overthrown by strangers and the daughter of zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers as a besieged let's see here and the daughter of zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers as a besieged city now personally i thought when i read this my wife was very thought it was ever so funny because i thought it was notable that god even thought that living on cucumbers was some sort of judgment um which i can't stand cucumbers which i thought really blessed my heart um so uh going on verse 9 except the lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant we should have been as sodom and we should have been like unto gomorrah and then it's verse 10 it says hear the words of the lord you rulers of sodom give ear unto the law of our god you people of gomorrah to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me saith the lord i am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts and i delight not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he goats when you come to appear before me who hath required this at your hand to tend my courts bring no more vain oblations incense is an abomination unto me and new moons and sabbaths the calling of assemblies i cannot away with it it is iniquity even the solemn meeting your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth they are a trouble unto me i am weary to bear them and when you spread forth your hands i will hide mine eyes from you yea when you make many prayers i will not hear your hands are full of blood and so when i read this it so struck me because here's god even going down the line even the sabbath he was like don't why are you bothering like everything that you do that is supposed to be these are commandments that i told you to do i told you to uphold the sabbath i told you to have all these sacrifices i told you to do you know have holy convocations right that your solemn assemblies coming to church is pointless right this entire thing that you're doing is completely pointless because you have so backslidden your lives are so completely like contrary to everything that even when you try to do something holy and righteous it's it's a stink right it's just it's it's a it's a it's a pollution you know um and then i kind of want to jump down to malachi chapter one um and uh i'll wait for josh to to get it and we're gonna go verse one on this one for real this time actually no it's not it's chapter 8 for six okay i had all this stuff i was uh putting this together at about five o'clock this morning so uh i'm a little bit off on some of my remembering what all i put in what all i left out okay malachi chapter 1 verse 6 a son on earth his father and a servant his master if then i be a father where is mine honor and if i be a master where is my fear saith the lord of hosts unto you o priests that despise my name and say where and have we despised thy name you offer polluted bread upon mine altar and you say where and have we polluted thee in that you say the table the lord is contemptible and if you offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and if you offer the lame and sick is it not evil offer it now unto thy governor will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person saith the lord of hosts so here again is god being like even so you're you're bringing me sacrifices they were supposed to bring you know obviously the best of the flock the best of what they could you know god demanded the best and then bring him sick crippled lame sacrifices you know when i read this initially i was like wow that is kind of like church people because you know it's i mean think about it why would they offer god a lame sacrifice because the nice ones had some value to them right you're not going to bring god the perfect lamb you could take that to the market and sell it for something no one's going to buy a crippled one right no one's going to want the blind and and diseased one right it's not worth anything so they're not they're they're they're bringing god the the off-cast and the remnants because it's it's too inconvenient to bring god anything more than that and so people i mean this is exactly what p what people are doing today when you know you you know you bring god some sort of half-hearted praise right or or the the the life that you're leading is kind of just mediocre or you know um uh even better when people will straight up skip church to go to work right i mean we can't bring god the good lamb that's got some market value that's worth some money in my pocket you know can't bring god you know a few hours on a wednesday night that's got some market value right so the and so this is this is kind of how i always read this um check my time here um and so this this is kind of i would say the carnality side of this right people not living up to just being [Music] uh maybe irreverent or um [Music] uh just having a a disregard for holiness just not caring being laxed being lazy and being uh just insincere and and just giving god the the bare minimum for what purpose i don't even know what why would you bother at that point you know almost be better off to just not god might respect you more um because at least then you're not you're being honest right you're you're because i mean if you bring god some lame sacrifice not only are you not being a christian you're also lying about being a christian right so don't do that um so i want to jump down to matthew chapter 23 and we'll um this one for actually for real is verse one yeah then spigel uh spake jesus to the multitude and to his disciples saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses seat all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do not ye after their works for they say and do not for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be born and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers right so you get this is this is the other side of this right you get people who will happily you know berate people about any flaw or failing that they see in their life you know always looking down their nose at people always being you know when some struggling teenager comes into the church and then uh my child would never act like that like oh really right like most of the time they actually are just they're smart enough to do it when you're not looking um the you know it's it's the it's this this this constant um uh it's it's a what it really speaks to is it's a love of self because you're looking at what i can do right what what me and i can do and um and i if i want to skip down to verse 13 here it says but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for you neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you devour widows houses and for a pretense may make long prayer therefore you shall receive the greater damnation woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you can pass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made you make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves that's pretty harsh you know you know as much as as much as people want to complain about brother branham being harsh on a lot of the denominational world i mean it's not much any harsher than what brother brother jesus himself had to say right you know jump down to uh verse 23 for me is where we read uh for our text um woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cumin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these you ought to have done and not leave the other undone so here's jesus pointing out that the weightier matters of the law beyond paying your tithes is judgment mercy and faith right like he's and notice he said do do the things that they're saying to do don't don't be you know acting like what they're telling you to do isn't important it is right having you know having the church order side of things is important we need those things because otherwise you become disrespectful but if you're doing it at the cost and completely neglecting the the the judgment mercy and faith well that's the more important stuff you know it says in verse 24 you blind guys with strain a gnat and swallow a camel woe into you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you make clean the outside of the cup end of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess right legality is so much harder to deal with because it's on the outside where no where no one can see that there's a problem but on the inside it's full of extortion and excess right thou blind pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also um and uh we can want to and so this is this is jesus kind of showing like we've already said you know there's this there's a if you go down the road of of legalism you're going to end up in almost a worse spot than in carnality because i think this is you know for me that i've always felt this way and i you know brother brandon even talks about how there ain't no devil like a religious devil um the problem with the with a legalistic spirit is that it's almost impossible to get rid of right it really takes the power of god to do it because the sinner has no idea he's a sinner and you hardly can't convince him that he is right what are you gonna do right you try to convince him that he's got a problem he's like oh yeah but like i am so detailed and meticulous and in my conducting of my affairs i pay tithes on these tiny little spices right these insignificant little things i'm even dotting all my eyes and crossing my t's how can you say that i'm a sinner it's like well um let's so i'm gonna jump back up to isaiah chapter one and this time we're going to go to verse 16. and so where we left off reading this is when god is basically saying you know i don't no more incense no more sabbath none of that this is all pointless stop it you're just polluting my throne room with this foul stink right um and so he says in verse 15 and then you spread forth your hands i will hide my eyes from you yea you make many prayers i will not hear your hands are full of blood verse 16 wash you make you clean put away the evil doings from before mine eyes cease to do evil learn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the widow come now let us reason together saith the lord though your sins be a scarlet they shall all be white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool if you be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land but if you refuse and rebel you shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it and so here's i find this interesting that here's god just absolutely rejecting all of their their worship services and their church and their sacrifices and their incense and all these things that they were doing and at the core of it the the thing that they were doing was failing to do well they were failing to seek judgment they were failing to relieve the oppressed and they were failing to judge the fatherless right that this is it wasn't even so much it doesn't mention in this that they were even bringing polluted sacrifice right like in in malachi that's what the problem was that's what god said but in this they were basically failing to relieve the oppressed be good to the people around you right be judge the fatherless be when when there when there are people who who don't have anybody else and the widows and the orphans amongst you the the people in need in your own church you turn your nose up and walk away and won't even lift a finger to help anybody right how how this is you the sacrifice means nothing because you're you're failing to um you're failing to uphold the goal that the sacrifice was trying to get you to in the first place right the the you know if um i guess you know in in uh malachi when it says talking about the sacrifices the lame sacrifices right and how they're bringing polluted sacrifices when i read this i immediately think in my mind of um uh let me pull it up here of hebrews um hebrews 13 or hebrews chapter 13 verse 15 says by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name but but so so this is this is paul saying by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name right so we you know we think okay we're going to come into the into the worship service and we're going to praise and we're going to really sacrifice you know when it's on a wednesday night and you're tired and you're miserable and nobody wants to nobody wants to you know clap their hands and have any kind of energy but you're giving forth all that you got even if you're completely dog tired and all you can manage is to barely raise your hand and oh you give all you got but it's all you got right you're giving your widows might because all you've got is is you've worked hard all day right but you're gonna do the best you can even if it's miserable that's that's that's the that's the sacrifice of praise right and that's wonderful and you should do that however but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifice god is well pleased right obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you and then um we look at romans chapter 12 and verse 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercy by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god for i say through the grace given to me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith so here's if you're going to present your body as a living sacrifice it's you know it is part of it is coming in and and sacrificing or giving offerings you know when they pass the plate and things like that those are the sacrifice and those are truly are sacrifices however the harder sacrifice and the sacrifice that god is is well pleased in is sacrificing your pride you know putting that thing on the altar because that that's the tough one right because you know when you when you when you sacrifice in that worship service or you put that money in the plate that's a temporary thing right you can get more money you know the worship service is only 30 minutes long right that's over soon it's quick but sacrificing your pride is the thing you do for the rest of your life right that doesn't stop you know and verse 9 it says love let love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love and honor preferring one another not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord rejoicing in hope patient and tribulation continuing instant in prayer distributing to the necessary necessity of the saints given to hospitality bless them which persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep be of the same mind one towards another mind not high things but condescends to men of low estate be not wise in your own conceit recompense no man evil for evil provide these provide things honest in the sight of all men if it be possible as much as life in you live peaceably with all men dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath and if you that that phrase plays under the wrath it means give place to the wrath of god right not not your own wrath but god's wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirsts give him drink for in so doing thou shall he calls a fire on his head be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good and so this is this long thing of everything in there is a sacrifice to do it hurts sometimes your flesh doesn't like it it really is not comfortable to look somebody in the eye who just royally just wronged you in every way that you can think and to look in the eye and love them anyways and be nice to them and help them in their time of need right like you want to take someone i mean how many people how many stories can you sit there and think to yourself of people who straight up stole from their own family and then god is saying yeah those people you're supposed to put your arm around them and love them anyways and help them anyways even though you know they're stealing from you ouch that's hard that's a sacrifice that's why that's why god is saying that's the one that i am well pleased in right because that's the one you know you know it's not not to make light of of the sacrifices that we do a lot of the times those are important those are the small things that we got to do but sometimes there are things you know to bless them which persecute you oh that one really hurts um you know and and i mean but everything i mean you could spend a lot of time which i don't have on every one of these but just just to love people to to to net to be guard yourself against being a grouch you know when your day has been completely turned upside down and you're miserable and you know you're you're just really enjoying the little rain cloud that's over your head um you know and and you're i'm just gonna sit here and you know well don't don't do that it's a sacrifice it's a sacrifice to walk away from that you know and and and to and to love people even when it's you're feeling miserable that's the sacrifice that god is looking for that's the sacrifice of the christian life because ultimately that's what christ came to do right so just a few as i wrap it up here um just a few closing comments the reason legalism seems to be the worst issue is that the sinner is blinded to his sin by his own religious fig leaf covering right you get to hide behind your religion say i'm not a sinner i go to church wrong and secondly the entire point of the sacrifices altars ceremonies and holy convocations was to point to a god whose entire purpose was to love humanity who had rejected him right that was the whole point of all the things that they were trying to do the sacrifices all that was foreshadowing for a christ that would come and love people who didn't deserve it and to love the people who wronged him his purpose of being was to forgive the people who had tortured him to death church form without the love and kindness of god is nothing more than a 90 pound bag of wet salt so that is a little note for me there's a story of a in the in the concentration camps of germany there's one one in particular which the jews is a work camp slave labor work the poor jews to death camp and they would there was a as a cruel joke there was a big sign over the front door that said hard work will set you free because by that they meant hard work will kill you faster right and they on their first day when they stepped off the train they had a 90 pound bag of wet salt they had to pick up and carry to the other side of the camp and it's not like 30 yards it's like a mile right which is hard hard miserable work and a lot of them have shoes on their feet and they're walking through knee deep snow and it's miserable and they're about dead when they get there and then the guy at the other side of the camp says all right now go drag it back and put it back where you got it why because the whole point was because at least if you're growing crops or something it might be miserable slave labor and it's hard work but if you're growing crops you still have that tiny little consolation that the hard work that i'm putting in is producing something right there's a little life that's growing out of that but to make someone drag around a 90-pound bag of salt for nothing and literally put it back where they started is to say you're going to we're going to work you to death and there's not even going to be any life that comes out of it no growth whatsoever and that's what legalism does to people it shackles them to a burden that will work them to death and they will never see the first ounce of growth no spiritual growth whatsoever right and it is it is it is that is why no matter as much as it's almost we it's a temptation right if the bait didn't taste good it wouldn't be part of the trap right satan puts legalism out as a as bait because there's a something in our flesh that kind of likes it but at the end of the day all it is is a trap and so i i mean it is it is better even though it's hard to make that sacrifice to make that sacrifice and and you know when you see somebody doing something wrong to not be ready to stone them to death verbally you know um you got to kind of kill your pride and kill your flesh a lot and that that burns that's the sacrifice but i guarantee you it's a whole lot better than dragging a pound a spiritual burden that will kill you that'll work you to death dragging it around and will and you will have no growth and uh that's that's where we gotta quit so thank you all for listening we'll stand and have a word of prayer your father thank you for this opportunity to speak a little word to your your people father ask that you would take these words that i would have and stitch them together into something that would help the people father and that my kind of scattered brain thoughts would be able to be useful to them that your spirit would have gone forth and water the the seeds that i've planted father and we ask these things in the name of jesus christ amen [Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] you
