========================================

[Music] every anxious thought that steals my breath it's a heavy weight upon my chest as a lie awake and wonder what the future will hold help me to remember that you're in control you're my courage when I were in the dead of all night you're my strength cause I'm not strong enough to win this fight you are greater than the battle raging in my mind I will trust you Lord I will fear no more I will lift my eyes I will lift my cares and I'll leave them there when the wind and waves are coming you shelter me even though I'm in the storm the storm is [Music] instead of night night [Music] [Music] you are greater than the battle raging in my mind I will trust you Lord I will fear no more girls [Applause]
