========================================

this morning and he's happy to be in the house of the Lord not necessarily come to hear me or any brother but we couldn't expect to hear from the Lord this morning let's all uh let's all stand have a word of Prayer father we just thank you for this time we have to come together once again Lord not knowing how many more times we'll have this opportunity but God may we take full advantage of it Lord may you just come down in this little lesson this morning and father and may you anoint my lips anoint her ears father give us stuff for our strength for our journey Lord we'll place it in your hands in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles I'll read First Corinthians 29 chapter chapter 29 verse 10 through 12. should have it on the screen wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation and David said blessed be thou Lord God of Israel Our Father forever and ever thine O Lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the Victory and the Majesty for all that is in the heaven and in Earth is thine thine is the kingdom of Lord and thou are exalted as head above all both riches and honor come of thee and thou reignest over all and in thine hand is power get that in thy hand is power and might and in thine hand is to make great and to give strength unto all and in Philippians 4 13 He says Paul says I can do all things through Christ which strengthen me may God bless the Lord you have your seats put a title to this I was was put in be in God's hands hands signify power signifies Authority because we know when Jesus died he arose up and extended into the right hand of God not that he is on the right hand of God but he set it up as the authority he had the power so Jesus standing on the right hand of God he has all power all because of what he had done he had came on the earth he had died he accomplished what he came for here roses sent it up and came back down and then he appeared to disciples because Jesus said told right before he extended back up he says I've been up there I've come back now all power belongs to me he's I have all power of all Heaven a power of all Earth is on me he didn't get less power he got more power so what happened when he got God's power did God lose his power God didn't lose no power because there's not three Gods all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church so what what that gives us today we got more power we have all the power because in Matthew 28 18 Jesus said unto them saying all power everything everything is given unto me in heaven and earth so what are you going to do he says I've got the power so I'm going to give it to you so go ye therefore to all the world be baptizing teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and the son of the Holy Ghost go ye and taught the world and preach the gospel he's telling them teaching them to observe all things of whatsoever I have commanded you he said I have told you so what this is what you're going to do Lo I'm with you alway even unto the end of the world Jesus took all of God's power and gave it to you that's what happens when you come back on the day of Pentecost all that God was he poured into Christ like I said many God all that Christ was important to the church that means you have all the power so the power has been transferred to you God in you now it's when you say I can do all things through Christ who strengthened me now these hands are going to take these hands are going to do what you tell them to do if you don't tell them do nothing he's just gonna be she's going to sit here but if you take your hand says pick up that fork and dig in that plate and take a bite that's what your hands are going to do scratch your head your hand's going to do it whatever these you have power over your hands so what are you going to say to your hands today no you get on your phone play games why you got a game controller what's in your hands these hands were once used for the devil's work they used to smoke you tell it Go didn't grab your cigarette smoke grab you a drink take you a little drink whatever whatever the devil told us to do with our hands is what we did with it but now they're used for God God says I Want You To Worship me we rate we say hands you're going to raise up you're going to worship God we're being God's hands you get excited you want to clap your hands take your hands that's what God is using your hands whatever is in your hands God's going to use it Hallelujah if we completely surrender to God he can use our hands to lay them on the sick and cast out devils your hands is God's hands but we have to Humble ourselves therefore the my under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time but we try to do too many things our way we try to use our own hands to accomplish things we try to use our own intellect to get things accomplished but he can't use us until we realize we're nothing but Ralph says in Wild little Bethlehem God don't do it that way he takes something that's nothing so that he can show himself to be Mighty that he can if he had took a high priest or a well-trained man in the days when he was calling the apostles if he took debt instead of the ignorant unlearned fisherman who couldn't even write his own name they could have said oh that you see your education paid off but God took a man who couldn't even write his name and that he could take something that he could get into his hand something that he could make something out of to show that he's God would he get to a place that we realized that we're nothing they then get in God's hands and he can mold you and make you the way he wants you to be but as long as we go around and feel like we're important then you'll never get nowhere you can't even get in the hands of God Until you realize you're not important let's realize that this morning we're not important but we have the power in our hands so what power do you have is it your own power I don't want my own power my own power ain't gonna do nothing under my own power I can't speak I can't speak sickness to go away on people I can't cast out Devils my own power without without him I am nothing but in that it's in thy hand you have a choice of what you want to do you have life or death being presented to you it's what you choose God is just requiring a complete surrender to him you can't be in the world and God you can't have both right it's what's in your hands that gives you power what's in your hand if you want God to use what's in your hands what's in there is it your phone or some kind of game controller can God use that what's in your hand what was in the hands of Moses it was a stick most people just all they see was a stick Moses come up to the burning bush Moses like I can't do nothing God finally got you there after 40 years finally got you because 40 years before that he had tried to do it on his own he tried to he tried he took his matters into his own hands he was going to conquer Egypt it didn't work but when he got in front of the burning bush God said what's in your hand I'm going to use what you got Mo said that's just a stick he said throw it on the ground it turned to a snake he just picks it up and turns to a rod God says now you're ready go conquer Egypt that was what Moses had in his hand guard what do you have in his he had an ox goat it was used for prodding cattle as I was used for under under shamgar the man he would prod cattle Glory try not to get too excited here bro Jason told me to teach by the letter he said teach Let it Fly so I'm trying not to I'm gonna let him do the preaching but under just sham guard it was just an ox gold well he got tired of 600 flips got tired of listing stealing his food every year he said I've got to do something's got to happen so I'm going to place this I'll go into the hands of God and see what God will do with it what happened when when that father he said I can't take it no more I can't do I can't do nothing I can't do nothing on my own to fight these Philistines but God's power come in him and he slayed 600 600 of them what about Samson he took it to Samson he just had a Jawbone we know what happened he was hit a thousand Philistines upon him and he just looks over and sees a Jawbone laying on the ground a normal Jawbone you couldn't whoops a thousand people you hit you'd hit across a soldier's helmet one time it is shattered yeah brother ramp said there was a thousand of them Samson was just a little bitty little thing but the spirit of the Lord is what was big God always takes the foolishness he takes the foolishness of preaching that's what we do brother Caleb every time we get up here we're a bunch of fools we're fools for Christ he takes the foolishness of preaching what we're used by God remember to say God always takes the foolish and the ignorant things like that to do his work you see he takes something that's nothing all at once Here Comes those Philistines and surrounding him to kill him he took the Jawbone of a mule that was laying there picked up the Jawbone of that mule and the spirit of the Lord came upon him what's in your hand Samson at first he looked like an old Jawbone laying there the first lick he would have hit it with a burst into a thousand pieces over top of one of those helmets when a thousand rushed upon him and he beat every one of them to death that was when the spirit of God Came Upon him I like this next statement it popped out at me he said if we could only be jawbones in the hand of God [Music] what could God do with us if he could just get us in his hands let our hands be his hands what would happen Lord let me David with a sling just a slinging day of his hand he just had to protect sheep when animals come and tactic he just picked up a stone he would kill kill the animals but what happened when he got into the hands of God a big Philistine devil said it up there cursing God in Israel they said I can't take this her brother Ram said and Witnesses he got the thing to working right he got it going around and around but David had something to do all he had to do was just get it started God would do the rest that's what we had to do we got to get it started if you need healing get it started if you need Deliverance get it started just get it started let God do the rest there's power in your hand to defeat the Devil Robert said when you get to Faith in Jesus Christ Working In Perpetual perpetual motion in your soul something is going to take place sin and sickness will get away from you Devils will scatter like Roaches on a floor wow Devils will scatter like Roaches on the floor in the summertime when the light is turned on Hallelujah so here you come he says I'll meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel and he begin to swing that slingshot around and the Holy Ghost shot that rock right up that Philistine and killed him David took his own sword and cut his head off took Goliath's so on sword and cut his head off and then he held it up and then he says come on boys Hallelujah he says come on all we got to do is get it started and let God do it come on boys he said we are in the hand of God Victory Is Ours that's my cry today it's come on young people come on middle-aged people come on old people Hallelujah come on boys Victory Is Ours how many wants victory what's in your hand just ask yourself all you got to do is just give it to God just let God let go and let God I always wonder about that statement just let go let God it's easy and not really it's not really easy what happened when Jesus had five thousand to feed he said feed these people so he ain't got nothing but a few little fishes and a few little loaves that might have fed brother Chris it might just fed me I might have shared with you but when God got a hold of it it fed 5 000 people and then had 12 basketballs left over power that's what's in God Jesus is saying you have power you have the Holy Ghost it gets all over you what happened to Peter at the gate beautiful Peterson I have no Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give to thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk he had a power from somewhere was he he's be he was beating God's hands Hallelujah you lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we've seen so much happen right here Wednesday night prayer cloths being prayed over what happens when the brothers come up here and we all laid our hands up on top of one another it was God's hands praying over those cloths when you come up here you get prayed for no matter who it is as soon as that man lays hands on you it's God laying hands on you if we just get the faith we come up here and we say I've already received it because I know God's hands is on me God is praying for me not just a man because like I said we can't do nothing Hallelujah says so with the laying hands on the sick if he says we're anointed to do so from God our hands represent God's hands that's the only hands he has is ours and we pray for the sick he has no voice tonight but our voice he says he has no hands but our hands he's had he has your hands that's whose hands it is goodness he has no hands on Earth but mine and yours his voice on Earth Is Ours our voice is given to him that's why we preach the gospel we believe it's not just us don't you brother Caleb we believe it's not just us standing up here because it's just us it's nothing it's a mess but with God what comes out of here what do you take out that door with you it's the Holy Ghost speaking through us you are in good hands you know they Allstate Insurance now you're in good hands with Allstate we got something better than that we're in good hands hallelujah our lips

God is in his people Jesus says I'll be with you I'll be with you even in you until the end of the world Hallelujah so what can you use today what can we do today we're in God's hands because Jesus
