[41:04] [Music]
[41:16] commend uh everyone that made all of
[41:19] this possible
[41:20] and i want to give you just a brief
[41:22] three four minute testimony and i'm not
[41:24] really going to go into to the details
[41:26] of it because i'd need 30 to 40 minutes
[41:29] but
[41:31] you have
[41:32] uh
[41:33] i'm trusting that you've had an
[41:34] enjoyable time
[41:37] and uh
[41:38] enjoying one another enjoying the
[41:40] ministry enjoying the presence of the
[41:42] lord
[41:42] we this whole camp has been purposed for
[41:46] the benefit of the youth amen i'm happy
[41:49] that i got i'm glad they let me come
[41:51] amen and i'm glad that other pastors and
[41:54] senior ministers much older than me like
[41:57] i'm not going to call his name but his
[41:59] initials are mike walls
[42:00] and and uh not much older brother mike
[42:04] but we we we kept laughing we kept
[42:06] looking at each other laughing at john
[42:09] and uh and saying and burley saying they
[42:11] were old i thought you guys are puppies
[42:13] what are you talking about amen so
[42:17] but we have so enjoyed it and i just
[42:20] want to give you
[42:21] this testimony brother matt mentioned
[42:23] this earlier
[42:24] in the meetings that it's almost
[42:27] unbelievable if i would start to tell
[42:29] you how the enemy has fought this camp
[42:33] and it's it's your it's been impossible
[42:36] really i can i'm here to tell you what
[42:38] has been pulled off here was beyond
[42:41] impossible somebody else had to be in
[42:43] control
[42:44] amen that means and i want you to
[42:46] realize that means he loved you and knew
[42:49] you'd be here and wanted the word to go
[42:51] forward without hindrance i think the
[42:53] lord deserves a hand today
[43:03] and you know as i was as i was driving
[43:06] this morning an inspiration struck me
[43:08] almost wish i could preach it today
[43:10] but
[43:11] you know
[43:12] during um
[43:14] world war ii which was actually the
[43:16] second woe in the book of revelation
[43:19] had to come world thought that they
[43:21] think they know what that's about it was
[43:22] it was only about god getting israel
[43:24] back into their homeland
[43:26] and preparing them for messiah but one
[43:30] of the things that was notable when i
[43:31] started thinking about all everything
[43:33] that we overcame as a team and i'm not
[43:36] going to go down the list today but just
[43:38] trust me the list is long and there were
[43:40] a number of impossible situations that i
[43:43] just didn't see how it could be done
[43:45] and yet in ways i cannot explain to you
[43:49] if you needed me to i couldn't explain
[43:52] that certain things happen and they just
[43:54] happened and i don't even know how they
[43:55] happened but they happened and it went
[43:57] off and here we are
[43:59] and i thought about how that during
[44:01] world war ii and the allied and axis
[44:03] powers clashing
[44:04] and you know it's it's it's notable in
[44:07] history the invasion of normandy
[44:09] uh when the allied forces under dwight
[44:12] eisenhower stormed the beaches
[44:15] at omaha and utah and sword and the
[44:17] different beaches and the axis powers
[44:20] were dug in and i mean they were dug in
[44:23] and they they had almost every kind of
[44:26] weapon imaginable to stop the allied
[44:28] advance because
[44:30] what the allies needed to be able to do
[44:32] was establish a beach head if they could
[44:34] get a toehold and get landed and and
[44:36] marshall their forces then it was then
[44:39] it was as churchill said it is not the
[44:41] the end the beginning he said it's not
[44:43] even the beginning of the end he said it
[44:45] is perhaps the end of the beginning
[44:47] because from there they could march in
[44:49] through france and cross through belgium
[44:51] and into europe and into the rhineland
[44:52] and and and move axis forces back
[44:56] but
[44:57] but but the axis forces knew that if
[44:59] they can just stop them from getting
[45:02] that first initial beachhead landing
[45:05] then they can they can either prolong or
[45:07] maybe even force the allies to just try
[45:09] to have a peace and i thought about how
[45:11] the enemy has taken this first youth
[45:14] camp this very first one for bethel
[45:16] tabernac and we're just a small seaside
[45:19] church
[45:20] 120 couple people counting youngins and
[45:23] and and there was really no way to do it
[45:25] and the enemy has fought us and fought
[45:27] us and fought us but god in this first
[45:30] year has established a beachhead
[45:32] amen
[45:35] and from here
[45:37] i believe we can push on to the coming
[45:39] of the lord
[45:40] i i sent you i hope you got it i sent
[45:42] you a little message from my heart to
[45:44] yours on the uh on the camp text i hope
[45:47] you got that if you d if you didn't ask
[45:49] somebody to show it to you just a few
[45:51] words from from my heart to yours and i
[45:54] thought about all of these weapons that
[45:56] the axis powers were wielding
[45:59] they had knives and bayonets they had
[46:02] m184
[46:03] slash 983 bayonets i mean these were
[46:06] nasty bayonets they had they had
[46:08] submachine guns they and they had
[46:11] stenmark twos and they had uh fg-42s and
[46:14] they had machine guns they had
[46:16] uh they had mg08s mg34s mg-42s to try to
[46:21] mow down the advancing allies
[46:24] they they had they had rifles and and
[46:27] they i don't even can't even pronounce
[46:29] some of these names they had mousers and
[46:31] they had they had lee infield marks and
[46:34] fortunately the allies were the only
[46:36] ones smart enough to use winchester
[46:38] shotguns the only ones that had them but
[46:40] they had anti-tank weapons they had
[46:43] panzer fall 60s and and and and they had
[46:46] grenades and they had it had number 75
[46:49] hawkins grenades and number 82 gammon
[46:52] i'm sorry those are english they had
[46:54] they had m24 wow style hand grenade and
[46:59] and they had land mines and they had
[47:01] glassman 43 anti-personnel mines they
[47:04] had flame throwers
[47:05] flamethrower 41s they had they had they
[47:08] had uh you know uh all of these things
[47:11] and even they had explosive charges and
[47:14] you know what they called their
[47:14] explosive charges
[47:17] sdkfz-302 goliath
[47:21] amen
[47:23] but god had a purpose
[47:24] and he was done with that movement it
[47:26] was accomplished against purpose and god
[47:28] was erased all of that but fortunately
[47:31] he had a superwife who remembered it all
[47:34] amen and sister amy was like no this is
[47:36] what we're going to do no this is what
[47:37] we're gonna do and and i'm here to tell
[47:39] you and sister rachel my my own
[47:41] daughter-in-law and all of the other
[47:43] ladies and brothers behind and behind
[47:46] every good man was a better woman
[47:47] probably
[47:49] and
[47:49] and it and and you know but
[47:52] regardless of all of that
[47:54] none of it
[47:55] could have been possible
[47:57] if it weren't for you
[48:00] and i i i want to salute you
[48:04] young people god bless you for your
[48:06] stand god bless you for your courage and
[48:10] and and as great as that is
[48:13] none of it at all with all of those
[48:15] teams and all of that leadership and you
[48:17] coming and all of us gathering and
[48:19] preachers preaching brother branham said
[48:21] i can he said no matter how anointed i
[48:24] can be in the back he said if i come out
[48:27] and there's resistance he said god won't
[48:29] move
[48:30] brother john could have prayed and
[48:32] fasted for 40 days and come out here at
[48:34] 110 pounds but if you were resistant to
[48:37] the word god wouldn't move
[48:39] i'm thanking you that you moved i'm
[48:42] thanking you that your hearts were open
[48:44] and above all the teams and above

[48:47] their wives behind them above you and i
[48:50] there was one great one among us

[56:24] think we'll go right to the scripture
[56:27] good morning
[56:30] bethel tabernacle youth camp here we are
[56:33] we've come down to this
[56:34] are we going to run together well
[56:37] are we going to finish strong
[56:39] are you going to work with us
[56:41] i mean you pull really hard and god give
[56:44] brother john discipline from behind the
[56:46] pulpit i just want to say what he wants
[56:49] to say to you
[56:50] and then we all have to go
[56:52] but let's just bring our thoughts our
[56:54] strength
[56:56] you probably didn't get a lot of sleep
[56:57] last night i didn't either so we're all
[57:00] in this together
[57:01] but it's not by our might
[57:03] or by our strength
[57:05] it's by the spirit of god and we want to
[57:07] speak this morning on the rising
[57:08] generation and i believe i'm speaking to
[57:10] some of them first corinthians chapter
[57:13] 15
[57:14] verse 49
[57:20] i believe
[57:21] young people can take the meat of the
[57:24] word and
[57:25] go a little bit deeper
[57:28] so here we are paul speaking in verse 49
[57:31] and as
[57:32] we have borne the image of the earth
[57:35] earthy
[57:37] i want you to notice the rest of the
[57:40] verses we're going to read the shall the
[57:43] all it includes all of us and it's so
[57:46] positive as we have bore the image of
[57:48] the earthy we shall also bear the image
[57:52] of the heavenly
[57:54] you are going to make it right
[57:57] now this i say brethren that the
[57:59] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[58:01] kingdom of god neither does corruption
[58:03] inherit incorruption behold
[58:06] paul said i show you a mystery
[58:09] we shall
[58:10] not all sleep
[58:12] but we shall
[58:14] all be changed
[58:16] is that what the bible says
[58:18] we're not going to leave any of you out
[58:20] we shall all be changed in a moment
[58:23] let's all say a moment
[58:25] in the twinkling of an eye
[58:28] at the last trump for the trumpet
[58:31] shall sound
[58:33] and the dead
[58:34] shall be raised incorruptable and we
[58:37] shall be changed
[58:40] how many realize that could happen
[58:42] during this service right now
[58:44] how many realize brother branham could
[58:46] come walking through that back door
[58:49] how many of you have loved ones in your
[58:51] church or family that have passed away
[58:53] that you know are believers they could
[58:56] come walking brother jason right up the
[58:57] stairway come walking out behind this
[59:00] curtain come sister deb right back there
[59:02] wouldn't that be wonderful i mean i
[59:04] would certainly wake up some of you
[59:07] amen
[59:09] you talk about a last service that we
[59:10] would have as we would see these things
[59:13] we're living in the time of the
[59:14] resurrection young people this is the
[59:17] very next event for the bride of christ
[59:20] is for the resurrection
[59:23] but before that change
[59:25] god's bringing
[59:27] messages to you
[59:28] to prepare your heart to be ready
[59:32] thank you jesus
[59:35] verse 53 for this corruptible
[59:38] must put on in corruption and this
[59:41] mortal must put on immortality
[59:44] so when this corruptable no matter how
[59:46] young you are or strong you are all of
[59:49] our bodies and even our minds and our
[59:52] brains are passing away and it's
[59:54] corrupting
[59:57] when this corruptible shall have put on
[59:59] incorruption and this mortal
[1:00:03] shall have put on immortality
[1:00:06] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[1:00:08] that is written
[1:00:10] death is swallowed up in victory
[1:00:12] o death where is thy sting
[1:00:15] oh grave where is thy victory
[1:00:18] the sting of
[1:00:19] death is
[1:00:20] sin
[1:00:21] and the strength of sin is the law but
[1:00:23] thanks be to god
[1:00:25] which giveth us the victory through our
[1:00:27] lord jesus christ
[1:00:29] thanks be to god who giveth bethel
[1:00:31] tabernacle youth camp and all of us
[1:00:34] together the victory
[1:00:36] we have the victory
[1:00:38] not we will have it you have it it's in
[1:00:42] you
[1:00:43] [Music]
[1:00:45] so what are what's some of the final
[1:00:46] words
[1:00:48] in verse 58 that we're going to hear
[1:00:50] after
[1:00:51] the closing remarks after all of this

[1:03:02] that there's something laying right
[1:03:03] ahead for us
[1:03:05] and brother branham in the message a man
[1:03:07] running from the presence of the lord
[1:03:10] said remember i believe i'm prophesying
[1:03:12] great joys lays ahead believe it that's
[1:03:16] right many saturn hearts will be made
[1:03:19] great mysteries will be made clear and
[1:03:21] people who are sad will be turned into
[1:03:25] joy

[1:03:34] into the heart of the matter
[1:03:36] you can see them as they're looking over
[1:03:38] the heart of the person
[1:03:41] and and we've spoken along with brother
[1:03:42] burley and brother cadre and brother
[1:03:44] jason we've we've linked our
[1:03:47] gifts together for you to be servants
[1:03:50] on on restoration and we've seen even
[1:03:53] throughout these last months how god has
[1:03:55] brought a theme now
[1:03:57] of restoration and how it's just
[1:03:59] continuing and last night we were
[1:04:01] speaking about the spiritual
[1:04:03] contractions trying to understand the
[1:04:05] thirst and the
[1:04:07] spasms and the groanings of what you
[1:04:10] have been going through as young people
[1:04:12] and then just directing your hearts to
[1:04:14] the booths now just as we leave our the
[1:04:17] campground this afternoon and all of us
[1:04:19] will
[1:04:21] and i prayed with my wife
[1:04:23] before the meetings and as we came into
[1:04:25] this services that every single person
[1:04:28] that came on to this campground as you
[1:04:31] drove in that when you drove out that
[1:04:33] you would be changed
[1:04:35] and i believe for some of you that has
[1:04:38] happened
[1:04:39] and i believe for all of us we're better
[1:04:41] christians
[1:04:42] this afternoon
[1:04:44] than when we came onto the grounds
[1:04:47] prayers have gone for you and the
[1:04:49] restoration now of your booth is now
[1:04:52] comes back to your consecration it comes
[1:04:55] back to your personal dedication to the
[1:04:58] lord it's not for the crowd now we're
[1:05:01] we're gonna leave the camp and the 400
[1:05:03] people are so and this afternoon we're
[1:05:06] going to have fathers and mothers and
[1:05:08] pastors and grandparents picking us up
[1:05:11] and driving us back to the airport and
[1:05:13] buses and in cars and summon airplanes
[1:05:16] as i just checked my flight and i think
[1:05:18] it's okay for tomorrow morning but here
[1:05:20] we are speaking to a rising generation
[1:05:24] and uh thank you brothers maybe you can
[1:05:26] just leave it on a slide number one as i
[1:05:29] just come now into the service for the
[1:05:32] rising
[1:05:33] generation are you ready for this
[1:05:36] remember miracles do happen
[1:05:38] and i believe i'm i'm standing in the
[1:05:40] midst of a miracle
[1:05:43] in first corinthians chapter 15 that we
[1:05:46] read
[1:05:48] we heard about the resurrection
[1:05:51] and there's two risings that i want to
[1:05:54] focus on
[1:05:55] this morning and that is number one the
[1:05:58] bride is rising
[1:06:00] now listen really fast with me
[1:06:03] the bride is rising
[1:06:06] but one day the sleeping saints are
[1:06:09] going to rise
[1:06:11] they've been sleeping they've been
[1:06:13] laying in the ground they've been
[1:06:15] waiting for you and i to come to our
[1:06:19] placing
[1:06:20] they've been waiting for the last one
[1:06:23] and there's been years of gone by you've
[1:06:25] had grand great grandparents and
[1:06:27] grandparents and fathers and mothers and
[1:06:30] now and and people around you and now
[1:06:33] there has to be a generation rise up
[1:06:36] that realize we are not in a going down
[1:06:39] generation but we are in a rising
[1:06:41] generation
[1:06:43] when jesus stood in front of the tomb of
[1:06:46] lazarus
[1:06:47] and said lazarus come forth there was so
[1:06:51] much power and authority in that voice
[1:06:55] that if he would have said come forth
[1:06:58] every dead person would have come out of
[1:06:59] the grave
[1:07:01] come forth
[1:07:03] but he spoke specifically he spoke his
[1:07:06] name and lazarus walked out of that
[1:07:08] grave
[1:07:10] and he was stinking after four days
[1:07:12] and that was the duty of christ the
[1:07:15] messiah
[1:07:16] how many is thankful for the holy ghost
[1:07:18] how he speaks to us but how many know
[1:07:21] what jesus then said to the people
[1:07:22] around the family the people he said
[1:07:25] loose him
[1:07:27] and let him go
[1:07:29] take off those grave clothes take off
[1:07:32] those those dead things and that is our
[1:07:34] responsibility to one another as we
[1:07:37] leave this campground when we go back
[1:07:39] home to our families and our jobs our
[1:07:41] schools and churches we have a
[1:07:44] responsibility
[1:07:45] god does his part right but we have our
[1:07:48] part
[1:07:49] and young people it's time to rise
[1:07:52] and step up into your calling
[1:07:55] you're not babies you're not children
[1:07:57] and we're not going to handle you with
[1:07:59] kid gloves no more we we're very earnest
[1:08:02] today i think it's a time to be sober
[1:08:06] hello

[1:08:09] sleeping like the foolish virgin it's
[1:08:12] time to wake up

[1:08:18] slumbering and slipping the bible says
[1:08:20] they all slumbered
[1:08:22] but at midnight there came a cry
[1:08:25] and that has already happened now where
[1:08:27] god has awakened now the bride of christ
[1:08:29] some of you already going to sleep here
[1:08:31] amen did y'all stay up late last night

[1:08:42] his sword drawn and standing in front of
[1:08:44] us saying go forward

[1:13:40] lives that we believe

[1:13:46] where the rubber meets the road
[1:13:49] and at school and in your family and

[1:14:20] never been before
[1:14:22] you've never you don't understand you've
[1:14:24] never been there you feel like like the
[1:14:27] mother eagle is kicking you out of the
[1:14:28] nest and you and you're turning around
[1:14:30] saying what are you doing and why is it
[1:14:32] so prickly in this nest it's god telling
[1:14:34] you it's time to fly
[1:14:38] stop fussing
[1:14:40] stop singing those old songs and you
[1:14:42] know done somebody wrong song and
[1:14:44] talking about your hurt and your wound
[1:14:47] and your brokenness it's time for you to
[1:14:49] believe the word of god
[1:14:52] and in the bible there was a prince
[1:14:54] called mephibosheth
[1:14:56] and she was a prince that was wounded
[1:14:58] from a little child when jonathan and
[1:15:00] saul were killed in the message they
[1:15:03] wounded a young prince
[1:15:07] but as the years went by and david now
[1:15:10] came to his place of anointing and
[1:15:12] kingship he said is there anyone of the
[1:15:14] family of jonathan that's alive and they
[1:15:16] said yes there's prince mephibosheth
[1:15:20] but he lives far away in lotabar
[1:15:23] out of cell range he lives in a far
[1:15:25] desert place he's hiding from you and
[1:15:27] david said go get him
[1:15:30] and mephibosheth walks in
[1:15:32] on his crutches and on his troubles and
[1:15:34] complexes thinking david's going to have
[1:15:36] him destroyed oh i finally got the
[1:15:39] prince that's been hiding
[1:15:42] but that wasn't what was in david's
[1:15:44] heart that that's not what's in god's
[1:15:46] heart to destroy you he's here to
[1:15:49] elevate you and promote you
[1:15:57] you all know the story david brought him
[1:15:59] to the king's table said i want you to
[1:16:01] be around me around the king's table
[1:16:05] and so there was always times that
[1:16:06] mephibosheth would come walking in he
[1:16:08] would come a little early because
[1:16:10] there's a little bit of embarrassment
[1:16:12] and shame sometimes
[1:16:14] when you've been hurt and when you're
[1:16:15] wounded and he'd come in like this his
[1:16:18] legs whether it was crutches or i don't
[1:16:20] know if they had wheelchairs and he
[1:16:21] would put the
[1:16:23] crutches under the seat
[1:16:25] sister paris and
[1:16:26] he would just sit down at the table like
[1:16:28] this
[1:16:29] i don't know whose cell phone this is
[1:16:30] but it's got a nice cover and ten
[1:16:32] dollars in the back
[1:16:35] praise god i'll just take this cover off
[1:16:37] him
[1:16:38] is that for starbucks money
[1:16:42] oh it's not your phone okay
[1:16:46] and everybody's walking in and all the
[1:16:48] people's walking in they're all happy
[1:16:50] and sitting at the table mephibosheth's
[1:16:52] just sitting down at the table and david
[1:16:54] comes walking in
[1:16:56] the king and mephibosheth is just tears
[1:16:58] coming out of his eyes because when
[1:17:00] you're all sitting around the table
[1:17:03] we're all the same
[1:17:05] you can't see my lameness you can't see
[1:17:07] what's going on but i'm just glad to be
[1:17:10] here
[1:17:11] and david is there and his presence and
[1:17:13] it's so wonderful to be around the king
[1:17:15] and isn't it wonderful
[1:17:17] to be the king's kids and a daughter of
[1:17:19] god and a son of god who thinks that's
[1:17:22] wonderful and
[1:17:23] you cannot see the lameness under the
[1:17:25] table it's all under the blood it's all
[1:17:28] behind you
[1:17:37] leave the past behind you
[1:17:40] and rise jump out of the nest
[1:17:43] and let the wings of faith
[1:17:45] carry you into god's will for your life
[1:17:48] and don't be ashamed of it don't be
[1:17:50] ashamed of what god's done for your life
[1:17:52] you're not going to flat fall flat on
[1:17:54] your face
[1:17:56] and if you do what are you gonna do
[1:17:59] you just get back up again you brush
[1:18:01] yourself off you get the mud off and you
[1:18:04] keep pressing on that's a rising
[1:18:06] generation
[1:18:13] god's asking some of you to step out of
[1:18:15] your comfort zone
[1:18:17] and to move from the carnal to the
[1:18:19] spiritual he's asking you to move
[1:18:22] addresses from the earthly to the
[1:18:25] heavenly
[1:18:26] i'm speaking very clearly i hope you're
[1:18:28] listening good
[1:18:30] move
[1:18:31] from being so carnal and moving to being
[1:18:34] more spiritual it's time to check out
[1:18:36] from this world
[1:18:38] it's time to check out from this world
[1:18:41] it's time for the saints that are
[1:18:43] sleeping to rise
[1:18:46] hallelujah
[1:18:48] luke chapter 17 speaks about the coming
[1:18:50] of the lord we don't have time it speaks
[1:18:52] about two will be in a bed one will be
[1:18:54] taken and the other left how many's
[1:18:56] heard that before
[1:18:58] okay so we don't need to turn to it two
[1:19:00] in a bed
[1:19:01] one will be taken and one will be left
[1:19:04] so it wasn't a homosexual lifestyle
[1:19:06] because one left
[1:19:09] is everybody being spiritual
[1:19:11] wake up
[1:19:13] you don't need the ministry to always be
[1:19:15] speaking about relationships to get into
[1:19:17] the service
[1:19:19] you're old enough to take some of these
[1:19:20] things now two in a bed one will be
[1:19:23] taken and one will be left that's got to
[1:19:25] be you
[1:19:27] two will be grinding at the field and
[1:19:29] working one's gonna be taken and one's
[1:19:31] gonna be left the one that's taken that
[1:19:34] is you
[1:19:38] two will be in a field
[1:19:40] one will be taken one think about how
[1:19:43] close of a relationship it would be to
[1:19:45] be in the same house
[1:19:47] to be in the same bed
[1:19:49] one has a walk with god one has their
[1:19:52] own private booth
[1:19:54] one has their own consecrated life and
[1:19:56] the very person brother matthew that's
[1:19:58] right next to them
[1:20:00] is not where they should be
[1:20:05] we sing when we all get to heaven
[1:20:09] but it is an individual walk with god
[1:20:14] malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 speaks about a
[1:20:17] generation that would receive a word
[1:20:20] prophet
[1:20:21] that's number one number two their
[1:20:23] hearts would be turned
[1:20:26] turn from the world turn from the things
[1:20:29] of this life
[1:20:31] i was going to say denominations but
[1:20:33] most of you don't even know what the
[1:20:34] denomination is that was 30 years ago in
[1:20:37] the message
[1:20:39] hello
[1:20:40] from conventions and youth meetings it
[1:20:42] was come out of her come out of
[1:20:44] denominations most young people don't
[1:20:46] even know what you're talking about
[1:20:48] brother cadre that's not the nations
[1:20:51] that they need deliverance from in the
[1:20:53] prayer line last night and personal when
[1:20:55] young ladies come up and young men just
[1:20:58] i could ask all the ministers was there
[1:21:00] one of them that say i need help to come
[1:21:02] out of the baptist denomination
[1:21:06] brother mike can brother mike just stand
[1:21:08] to your feet he's our senior
[1:21:10] elder brother mike was there any of the
[1:21:12] young ladies are young men that said i
[1:21:14] need deliverance from the catholic
[1:21:16] church and the
[1:21:18] say it loud
[1:21:20] any of these brothers
[1:21:22] the young people of today you're living
[1:21:24] in another generation
[1:21:26] but there are a lot of nations
[1:21:28] that are trying to capture our young
[1:21:30] people and it's time to rise out of that
[1:21:40] i'm asking this morning where is the
[1:21:42] generation that will go in the rapture
[1:21:45] where are you
[1:21:49] are you hiding in despair
[1:21:51] are you in a cave of despondency
[1:21:54] are you always depressed and talking
[1:21:56] about somebody hurt you
[1:21:58] are you always so wounded that a friend
[1:22:01] left you and you get thumbs down
[1:22:08] you all know what i'm talking about
[1:22:10] 30 years ago they would have said what
[1:22:12] are you talking about every single
[1:22:14] person here probably knows what i'm
[1:22:15] talking about like dislike
[1:22:18] right
[1:22:19] i don't care if there's 648 of this but
[1:22:22] jesus gives you this
[1:22:25] you follow christ
[1:22:35] i'm speaking my last sermon this morning
[1:22:37] to you the last generation
[1:22:40] this is what's on our hearts you are the
[1:22:43] generation that's going to make the
[1:22:44] change
[1:22:46] you are the generation that paul talked
[1:22:48] about brother branham talked about
[1:22:50] midivold and sages they would have loved
[1:22:53] to have been at this camp service
[1:22:57] do we recognize our day
[1:22:59] and its message that there will be a
[1:23:01] generation
[1:23:03] believers that are alive and remain
[1:23:08] they're going to take a hold of a word
[1:23:10] they're going to latch a hold of it and
[1:23:12] the word
[1:23:13] will take them in a rapture
[1:23:16] the rapture is a catching away
[1:23:19] it's already started
[1:23:22] and remember in matthew 25 the 10
[1:23:24] virgins
[1:23:25] the bible says in verse 5 they all
[1:23:27] slumbered and slept
[1:23:29] but there came out a word and the bible
[1:23:31] says they all arose
[1:23:34] so the rapture is arising
[1:23:37] it is arising
[1:23:40] and the call of the message causes a
[1:23:42] rising
[1:23:43] in the individual
[1:23:45] it's time to rise
[1:23:46] up
[1:23:48] i think brother caleb campbell where are
[1:23:50] you at this morning
[1:23:51] had that yesterday
[1:23:52] [Music]
[1:23:56] it's time to get up
[1:23:58] it's time to wake up oh i'm sleepy i'm
[1:24:00] tired it's time to wake up
[1:24:04] it's time to stir yourself
[1:24:07] it's time to get stirring and get active
[1:24:10] because we're living in the final acts
[1:24:14] the final act of an age
[1:24:17] the bride is making ready to go and god
[1:24:20] is putting the final touches on his
[1:24:23] master pieces
[1:24:25] there's been camps camps
[1:24:28] brides brides churches churches
[1:24:31] generations young ladies young men but
[1:24:34] one day there's going to be a generation
[1:24:40] there's going to come a sweep over us
[1:24:48] there's just in a twinkling of an eye
[1:24:50] everybody twinkle your eye just like
[1:24:52] this
[1:24:53] no don't look to either side of the room
[1:24:55] you know
[1:24:56] but you just twink your eye like that's
[1:24:57] how fast it's going to happen you shall
[1:24:59] be changed
[1:25:01] let's turn to first thessalonians we
[1:25:03] need this and this miracle
[1:25:05] we're walking in a miracle right now
[1:25:07] look up
[1:25:08] for your redemption drawleth nigh yes
[1:25:11] first thessalonians chapter 4
[1:25:14] i'm just going to read one verse but you
[1:25:16] can read maybe write this down some of
[1:25:18] you are writing notes that's very good
[1:25:20] very good
[1:25:22] first thessalonians chapter 4 is the
[1:25:24] rapture chapter verse 16.
[1:25:26] the bible says for the lord himself
[1:25:31] and we got the lion of the tribe of
[1:25:32] judah up there all right first
[1:25:34] thessalonians chapter 4 verse 16. for
[1:25:37] the lord himself let's say lord himself
[1:25:40] shall descend from heaven
[1:25:43] with a shout
[1:25:45] that's number one right
[1:25:47] with the voice of the archangel number
[1:25:50] two
[1:25:52] and with the trump of god
[1:25:54] and the dead in christ shall rise
[1:26:00] that's what we're looking for the
[1:26:01] resurrection
[1:26:03] is a real event it's the hope of the
[1:26:05] church
[1:26:06] and i have quotes for what i'm saying to
[1:26:08] you it's the hope of the church
[1:26:11] is the coming of the lord
[1:26:13] so before the great and dreadful day of
[1:26:15] the lord god's going to send a prophet
[1:26:17] that will literally turn the hearts of
[1:26:19] the last day children back to the faith
[1:26:23] and i i thank god for the hickory bible
[1:26:25] tabernacle choir and how they they sang
[1:26:28] that song with passion
[1:26:29] and that god has lit your flame i hope
[1:26:32] some of you god has lit your flame
[1:26:35] i heard some of you sisters rejoicing
[1:26:37] and responding
[1:26:38] last night
[1:26:41] don't ever be embarrassed
[1:26:43] in the presence of god
[1:26:45] just learn
[1:26:47] to know
[1:26:48] that that is the place
[1:26:51] that's a safety place
[1:26:53] when i walk out of airplanes many times
[1:26:56] and you'll see right on the wall the jet
[1:26:58] way brother jason it said this airport
[1:27:00] is a safe place that means if you're
[1:27:02] going through times of trouble or if you
[1:27:04] feel
[1:27:05] danger in your life you can come to this
[1:27:07] place talk to somebody
[1:27:10] talk to staff talk to
[1:27:12] an airline talk to somebody this is a
[1:27:15] safe place if you're abused
[1:27:19] if you're being handled wrong
[1:27:22] this presence of god
[1:27:25] is a safe place
[1:27:26] learn to run in there learn to let go
[1:27:29] learn to let off the pressure learn to
[1:27:32] lift these hands let's try it right now
[1:27:33] let's all lift these hands it's some of
[1:27:36] you are very tired some of your
[1:27:39] take these hands
[1:27:41] and lift them up
[1:27:44] for i have not the strength
[1:27:48] near enough
[1:27:51] and then you start just
[1:27:52] this is a safe place
[1:27:56] i just heard yesterday of another church
[1:27:58] in the message
[1:28:00] and it's just high level things where
[1:28:03] young boys are being mishandled
[1:28:06] sexually
[1:28:07] that just does something to me it
[1:28:09] touches a raw nerve
[1:28:11] not just one two three up to five
[1:28:15] you want to see the blood boil of a real
[1:28:17] man of god
[1:28:18] is when you hear about that happening
[1:28:20] and people trying to cover it up and
[1:28:22] condone it
[1:28:24] that's not the message i don't care who
[1:28:26] it is
[1:28:27] what church it is
[1:28:28] [Applause]
[1:28:37] when that's all that we've preached for
[1:28:40] and lived for is to strengthen our young
[1:28:42] people strengthen our families
[1:28:45] and for a spirit to come in and people's
[1:28:47] trying to cover it up
[1:28:49] trying to sanction it because they're
[1:28:51] related to the pastor
[1:28:53] this is just yesterday i said god
[1:28:55] rebuked that thing
[1:28:57] that is not the holy ghost that is not
[1:29:00] the nature
[1:29:01] of the word there needs to be a rooting
[1:29:03] out
[1:29:04] and a repentance
[1:29:06] that's why there's a lack of revival in
[1:29:10] the message
[1:29:11] is because young people hear what we've
[1:29:13] heard this weekend and they go back home
[1:29:16] and go back to places that is hiding sin
[1:29:23] we our young people deserve better than
[1:29:25] that
[1:29:26] [Applause]
[1:29:36] you're god's children
[1:29:38] in first thessalonians chapter 4 verse
[1:29:40] 16 we see this just quickly the shout
[1:29:43] the voice and the trumpet brother
[1:29:46] branham said in the rapture message
[1:29:48] december the 4th 1965 the word rapture
[1:29:51] in the bible is not even used at all
[1:29:54] but the bible said caught up being
[1:29:56] caught up
[1:29:58] and that's in first thessalonians that
[1:30:00] was later down in that chapter it's the
[1:30:02] order of the great rapture that will
[1:30:03] take place in the last days three things
[1:30:06] that has to happen before the lord
[1:30:08] himself appears are you listening
[1:30:10] quickly
[1:30:11] shout voice a trumpet has to happen
[1:30:15] before jesus appears
[1:30:17] jesus does all three of them
[1:30:19] when he's descending
[1:30:22] i'm reading from a prophet a shout
[1:30:24] it's the message going forth
[1:30:26] the living bread of life bringing forth
[1:30:29] the bride
[1:30:30] so if jesus does all three of these
[1:30:33] things as he descends and the shout is
[1:30:36] the message
[1:30:38] we have a right to say this morning
[1:30:41] the message the rapture has already
[1:30:43] began
[1:30:45] it's a catching away it's something to
[1:30:48] gather the people together a shout
[1:30:52] and then a trumpet
[1:30:53] the trumpet is with the sound of a truck
[1:30:56] a voice i'm sorry i'm just trying to go
[1:30:59] quickly
[1:31:00] and skipping over but he said what is it
[1:31:02] a shout out voice and trumpet a shout
[1:31:04] it's the message to getting ready the
[1:31:06] second is the voice of the resurrection
[1:31:08] the same voice let's all say same voice
[1:31:11] with a loud voice not a whisper but in
[1:31:14] john 11 when he called lazarus from the
[1:31:17] grave getting the bride together the
[1:31:20] resurrection of the dead and to be
[1:31:22] caught up with it watch the three things
[1:31:24] the
[1:31:25] the next was a trumpet shout voice and a
[1:31:29] trumpet the sound of a trumpet what does
[1:31:31] it call a trumpet calls and he's talking
[1:31:34] about the feast of the trumpets a
[1:31:35] pentecostal feast and the feast of the
[1:31:37] trumpets he goes on but a trumpet is to
[1:31:40] announce a calling together
[1:31:42] that's what we've had this weekend also
[1:31:44] spiritually we have been introduced in
[1:31:47] the month of october to the feast of
[1:31:49] tabernacles
[1:31:51] but before the feast you've got to have
[1:31:53] a booth
[1:31:56] do i have your attention
[1:31:57] you've got to get personal and private
[1:31:59] the rapture is a stirring
[1:32:02] friends this is not the time to fall
[1:32:04] back
[1:32:05] i'm giving you these final words
[1:32:08] this is not the time to fall back
[1:32:10] you cannot fall back it's time to step
[1:32:13] up like going up a ladder
[1:32:15] come on young people step up
[1:32:17] [Applause]
[1:32:20] matthew chapter 9 is an illustration of
[1:32:23] the scripture
[1:32:24] one of the illustrations of jesus
[1:32:26] matthew 9 verse 18 we're not going to
[1:32:29] turn to it of a maid a damsel a young
[1:32:31] girl a teenage girl maybe or a young
[1:32:34] girl the bible says maiden where jesus
[1:32:37] raised her from the dead
[1:32:39] they all said she was dead
[1:32:42] listen to me
[1:32:44] are you listening
[1:32:46] they all said she's dead
[1:32:48] and jesus said no she's just sleeping
[1:32:52] and you know what the bible says they
[1:32:53] laughed him to scorn
[1:32:55] he was seeing one thing and they were
[1:32:58] seeing another it's time that we turn
[1:33:00] our eyes upon jesus and stop talking
[1:33:02] about the death and speak about the
[1:33:04] resurrection
[1:33:10] so where do you have your eyes this
[1:33:12] morning
[1:33:14] are you looking at all the death and the
[1:33:16] problems
[1:33:18] or you have your eyes on i'm with you
[1:33:20] jesus she's just sleeping
[1:33:22] and just speak the word he got everybody
[1:33:24] out of the house
[1:33:25] and in just a few moments she was
[1:33:27] walking around
[1:33:29] oh thank god she can go to lunch
[1:33:33] praise god it's been extended from 2
[1:33:35] o'clock to
[1:33:36] 5 5 30.

[1:33:58] doing okay
[1:33:59] there was a dead boy being brought out
[1:34:01] of the city of name
[1:34:03] it was a widow the mother his mother was
[1:34:05] a widow that means the boy had lost his
[1:34:07] father and it was the only child
[1:34:10] and jesus saw everybody crying and
[1:34:12] weeping and he said you know what

[1:34:42] phrase we've heard for many many years

[1:37:02] going up
[1:37:13] you want to stay in a tribulation that's
[1:37:15] up to you
[1:37:17] you want to go to a hell
[1:37:19] where brother branham said a burning
[1:37:21] literal hell would be like electrical
[1:37:24] wires going through you
[1:37:27] come on friends the first five minutes
[1:37:30] of when the rapture happens is going to
[1:37:32] be glorious for the bride but it's going
[1:37:34] to be torment for those in the message
[1:37:38] that have been in this type of
[1:37:39] atmosphere and missed the rapture
[1:37:42] there ought to be some zeal in your
[1:37:44] heart i will not miss the rapture
[1:37:47] [Applause]
[1:38:06] you may be seated let's give the
[1:38:07] microphone to brother paul what do you
[1:38:09] have to say it's time to lay aside every
[1:38:11] way
[1:38:12] and the unbelief that you came to camp
[1:38:15] with
[1:38:16] the sin that is holding you down i'm
[1:38:19] speaking to young ladies and young men
[1:38:21] it might be as small as a little
[1:38:23] lipstick thing or a little you know
[1:38:24] you're painting your fingernails shame
[1:38:26] on you
[1:38:28] we're supposed to be a bride we're not
[1:38:29] to look like the world
[1:38:40] who are you trying to impress living a
[1:38:42] double life
[1:38:43] living a double standard god knows all
[1:38:45] your hinder parts and your naked parts
[1:38:48] say i've done good this weekend nobody
[1:38:50] knows and i'm going to go right back
[1:38:51] yeah you go back
[1:38:54] but there's another generation
[1:38:56] that's going to take these messages and
[1:38:58] take this atmosphere
[1:39:00] that god knew that's why satan fought
[1:39:02] this camp so hard is because there was a
[1:39:05] blessing for you there was a revival for
[1:39:07] you there was a message for you
[1:39:16] as the days have gone by now
[1:39:20] as the weeks have gone by as the months
[1:39:22] have gone by in years now
[1:39:24] many people are becoming a victim
[1:39:27] to exactly what the devil planned and
[1:39:30] what he schemed and what he devised for
[1:39:32] this generation he planned an excellent
[1:39:36] diversion plan
[1:39:38] i've got to distract the people from the
[1:39:40] word
[1:39:42] a year and a half ago that's what was in
[1:39:44] satan's laboratory some of you thought
[1:39:46] it was out of wuhan china or whatever
[1:39:48] you think but it was a diversion from
[1:39:51] satan to take you away from the word
[1:39:56] and to get your mind on shutdowns
[1:39:59] masks
[1:40:00] vaccinations
[1:40:03] testing data science
[1:40:07] you can get quiet all you want to
[1:40:09] he got your mind on numbers and virus
[1:40:12] counts and politics
[1:40:14] trump or biden
[1:40:16] [Music]
[1:40:18] it's not going to be the democrats that
[1:40:20] get you in a rapture it's not going to
[1:40:22] be the republicans it's not going to be
[1:40:24] the independence it's going to be thus
[1:40:27] saith the lord
[1:40:40] some of you in your churches were just
[1:40:41] coasting along
[1:40:43] and this virus came out of nowhere
[1:40:46] the sickness it was on television it was
[1:40:48] on media it was even in message purpose
[1:40:51] oh the sickness the virus the death
[1:40:54] but let me say this today
[1:40:56] it was not the government that shut down
[1:40:59] churches
[1:41:00] spiritually
[1:41:02] it was not local health officials
[1:41:05] that caused the coolness
[1:41:08] and the death
[1:41:10] to be stripping away revival from the
[1:41:13] people there's not one person that can
[1:41:16] claim an excuse
[1:41:18] for backsliding
[1:41:20] there's not one believer
[1:41:22] that can give an excuse of of worldly
[1:41:25] events or school or officials you can
[1:41:27] get so upset at the officials no
[1:41:31] backsliding is not an option for a son
[1:41:35] or daughter of god
[1:41:38] and i encourage you
[1:41:43] my wife said the more they clap the
[1:41:44] longer you preach
[1:41:46] so
[1:41:47] i love you clapping i really do but i'm
[1:41:49] working in a miracle right now
[1:41:52] don't become a statistic
[1:42:00] you are the church
[1:42:02] of today
[1:42:03] tomorrow has arrived
[1:42:06] and god has raised up young people
[1:42:07] globally
[1:42:10] globally i'm speaking this in south
[1:42:12] carolina
[1:42:14] but brother john has personally
[1:42:15] witnessed in the last six months
[1:42:17] throughout all the united states and
[1:42:19] then in europe that we've traveled and
[1:42:20] then globally speaking to young people
[1:42:24] there is a group
[1:42:25] of young men and women that are ready to
[1:42:28] serve
[1:42:30] they have been trained right
[1:42:33] their attitude is right
[1:42:36] their character is right
[1:42:40] they don't speak condescending
[1:42:44] they handle with care
[1:42:48] they speak the truth in love
[1:42:52] because they came from the womb of the
[1:42:54] message
[1:42:56] that old fighting spirit is not even in
[1:42:59] them
[1:43:00] and that's a whole message
[1:43:02] there were old fighters that fought and
[1:43:04] through the wilderness and they had to
[1:43:06] be that way they feraled the field for
[1:43:08] us
[1:43:09] but brother branham talked about the
[1:43:11] sons
[1:43:12] of the old fighters
[1:43:14] it was that generation that made it into
[1:43:17] the promised land
[1:43:18] and you can say what you want think what
[1:43:20] you want but you have to acknowledge
[1:43:24] that you are in another season
[1:43:26] and another time another era
[1:43:29] and you are living in a generation that
[1:43:32] god had in his mind a certain caliber of
[1:43:34] young men and young ladies older ones
[1:43:37] younger ones alike i'm not making ages
[1:43:39] here this is a generation it's not just
[1:43:42] young people
[1:43:43] joshua and caleb they were older caleb
[1:43:45] was older when he said give me my
[1:43:47] mountain
[1:43:48] he was 85 years old my father is 80
[1:43:51] years old but i'm i'm not speaking to
[1:43:53] you in a way to
[1:43:55] push you down i'm saying this is your
[1:43:57] time to rise
[1:44:03] are we doing okay
[1:44:05] i want to give a warning brother burley
[1:44:07] gave some mornings i want to give a
[1:44:08] warning
[1:44:10] media
[1:44:12] obsession
[1:44:13] is a disease
[1:44:16] i'm speaking to young people the message
[1:44:18] some of my closing remarks media
[1:44:20] obsession is a disease
[1:44:23] it clouds the mind
[1:44:25] it clouds the spirit
[1:44:27] and it opens up the gates of the soul
[1:44:30] to wrong spirits
[1:44:32] some of you young people need to listen
[1:44:34] really good right now
[1:44:38] media obsession
[1:44:40] is a global pandemic
[1:44:42] it's the greatest global pandemic
[1:44:45] and covid is not the greatest coveted
[1:44:48] pandemic sorry it is a covert pandemic
[1:44:51] but it's not the greatest pandemic
[1:44:53] that's in the world cove it is not
[1:44:58] brother john has seen it
[1:45:00] media obsession is a virus
[1:45:03] it's a disease of devices
[1:45:07] electronic devices
[1:45:09] where young people are becoming digital
[1:45:13] addictors they're addicted
[1:45:15] to digital devices
[1:45:17] not drugs not alcohol not pills not
[1:45:21] gaming even though some young people and
[1:45:23] parents
[1:45:25] are more into gaming than the word of
[1:45:27] god then you wonder why your young
[1:45:30] people are the way they are it's time
[1:45:32] for fathers to arise
[1:45:34] mothers to arise ministers to arise the
[1:45:38] church to arise
[1:45:44] even science will tell you my my time is
[1:45:46] gone
[1:45:47] that dopamine is a chemical in the brain
[1:45:50] that is released through chemical
[1:45:51] devices but the holy spirit has sent
[1:45:54] another wage another wave and another
[1:45:56] surge of the holy spirit we've heard
[1:45:58] enough about it in the last year another
[1:46:00] wave another surge of this crazy virus
[1:46:03] it comes in and it'll go out and we've
[1:46:05] heard about these waves and these surges
[1:46:07] but i want to announce to you today
[1:46:08] there's another wave there's another
[1:46:10] surge it's called the holy ghost it's a
[1:46:13] powerful sudden forward motion then it
[1:46:17] goes upward then it goes out then it
[1:46:20] goes in and then it's going to take you
[1:46:22] away one day it's a supernatural force
[1:46:25] like the waves of tide that comes in and
[1:46:28] goes out this wave of the holy spirit
[1:46:31] that is moving and we've all heard about
[1:46:33] cases and restrictions and lockdowns and
[1:46:36] social distancing and we've we've said
[1:46:38] it already masks and vaccines and you
[1:46:40] know are you vaccinated are you not
[1:46:42] vaccinated have you been tested that's
[1:46:43] enough or not

[1:46:48] death is striking the land sickness is
[1:46:50] striking the land but so is another wave
[1:46:53] of the holy ghost
[1:46:55] it's a global surge in the youth of this
[1:46:57] message
[1:46:59] it's a worldwide wave of god's
[1:47:01] quickening power it's back on display we
[1:47:04] saw it last night hallelujah we see it
[1:47:07] right now

[1:47:41] you all going to give me a few more
[1:47:43] minutes

[1:47:47] the rising generation you've been liking
[1:47:49] to sheep
[1:47:52] sheep bethel tabernacle youth camp
[1:47:58] this is
[1:48:00] this is the body language of the holy
[1:48:02] spirit this weekend
[1:48:06] he's been reaching for you
[1:48:08] that's wonderful
[1:48:11] let this be
[1:48:12] something how a person can be going
[1:48:14] astray
[1:48:16] and that god is going to make you
[1:48:17] profitable in your life i'm speaking now
[1:48:20] to the rising generation you might have
[1:48:22] come into this camp unprofitable but god
[1:48:25] is going to make you profitable
[1:48:27] all we like sheep have gone astray
[1:48:30] we have turned everyone to his own way
[1:48:32] and the lord hath laid on him the
[1:48:33] iniquity of us all i have gone astray
[1:48:36] david said like a lost sheep
[1:48:38] seek thy servant for i do not forget thy
[1:48:40] commandment and we look at going astray
[1:48:43] some of you were in this condition
[1:48:45] coming to camp that you it means to air
[1:48:47] or wonder
[1:48:48] to stagger
[1:48:50] to wonder about the wandering of the
[1:48:52] mind
[1:48:53] mentally morally this is
[1:48:55] going astray
[1:48:57] this is what it means
[1:48:59] and the believer is typed as sheep all
[1:49:02] the bible says we was astray
[1:49:04] away from the shepherd
[1:49:06] and away from the fold
[1:49:09] and god has been encouraging us to come
[1:49:11] back come back
[1:49:14] and then god gives you patience for
[1:49:17] other sheep to mature and come to their
[1:49:19] place so it creates an atmosphere like a
[1:49:21] team
[1:49:22] that i i have now patience for others
[1:49:25] from unprofitable now god's going to
[1:49:27] make you profitable from a slave
[1:49:31] to not much eternal good
[1:49:34] in your life a freedom to a prophet to a
[1:49:37] blessing
[1:49:38] to contributing to the body how many you
[1:49:40] want to be a con contribution
[1:49:43] i wanted to introduce you to chris
[1:49:48] you all laugh but some of you look like
[1:49:50] this
[1:49:51] on thursday night
[1:49:54] this is chris
[1:49:56] he was lost for six years brother jason
[1:50:02] this is another picture of chris isn't
[1:50:03] that wonderful
[1:50:05] you want to post that this afternoon
[1:50:07] on your
[1:50:08] status i mean this is in australia even
[1:50:11] the kangaroos
[1:50:13] are looking at him saying what's wrong
[1:50:14] with you
[1:50:16] god bless you
[1:50:18] look at this this is what he looked like
[1:50:20] when he was caught
[1:50:23] and so when he was caught there was an
[1:50:25] australian sheepshear
[1:50:28] that had set a record for clipping sheep
[1:50:30] and he realized that this this
[1:50:33] this guy's life is endangered
[1:50:36] this this gigantic sheep named chris
[1:50:40] had been found he could barely walk he
[1:50:42] was
[1:50:43] remember you and me are like sheep
[1:50:46] but from this
[1:50:48] sheep that was lost
[1:50:50] when he was found the wool that was from
[1:50:53] his
[1:50:54] that had grown it yielded 30 sweaters
[1:51:00] i was going to have 15 sister stan and
[1:51:02] 15 brothers stand and sweaters
[1:51:05] he was profitable
[1:51:07] but he was lost
[1:51:10] it's incredible so he started to shear
[1:51:13] this was the champion
[1:51:15] man sharing
[1:51:18] he had to be sedated brother chris
[1:51:23] because the cruelty of animals division
[1:51:26] it took 45 minutes to remove
[1:51:30] 18 inches 47 centimeters of fleece i
[1:51:33] want you to look at that because that's
[1:51:34] going to mean something 88 pounds
[1:51:37] of 45 minutes
[1:51:42] and this man said i don't think he'd
[1:51:44] been shorn before and i think he's five
[1:51:46] or six years old i wouldn't say it's
[1:51:48] high quality but you wouldn't expect it
[1:51:50] after so long in the bush
[1:51:53] but this chris he was br they're bred
[1:51:56] for especially for their rule they need
[1:51:58] to be they need to go to church
[1:52:00] regularly
[1:52:05] they need to go to church regularly
[1:52:09] or they can have trouble
[1:52:11] going to the bathroom
[1:52:13] and can develop serious medical issues
[1:52:19] oh my
[1:52:20] are you all thinking about this
[1:52:23] young people go through things if we
[1:52:24] don't go to the house of god and get
[1:52:26] shorn we have issues
[1:52:28] we might be just fine but you start
[1:52:30] having trouble in this certain area
[1:52:33] yeah it's desperate
[1:52:36] the average australian fleece
[1:52:39] takes approximately three minutes let's
[1:52:41] all say three minutes
[1:52:43] how long did it take to shear chris
[1:52:46] that's how long it takes when you're out
[1:52:49] of the spirit
[1:52:51] when you're not living where you should
[1:52:53] it takes a long time but just a few
[1:52:55] moments in his presence just an opening
[1:52:58] song just you know somebody gives a
[1:53:00] scripture and they're right there
[1:53:02] that's how it ought to be after you
[1:53:03] leave this camp just a few minutes
[1:53:06] brother branham talked about this about
[1:53:08] wool and lamb in the dove listen look
[1:53:10] you ought to listen to that message
[1:53:12] maybe this next week and how a sheep
[1:53:13] just lays there forfeits its rights this
[1:53:16] is chris
[1:53:18] after he was shorn
[1:53:20] a little bloody
[1:53:21] it hadn't happened before
[1:53:23] look at this rule 88 pounds
[1:53:27] and god is
[1:53:28] likening you and i to sheep that have
[1:53:30] gone astray
[1:53:34] i'm trying to click this brother matthew
[1:53:35] and it's not clicking so
[1:53:37] the miracle needs to continue help me
[1:53:40] out brothers
[1:53:43] what a photo
[1:53:44] is that beautiful
[1:53:46] this is chris chris needs help
[1:53:52] just keep clicking brothers
[1:53:55] you know he was found
[1:53:57] just a few kilometers from a farm
[1:54:00] he wasn't way away he was very close
[1:54:04] it wasn't like he was thousands of miles
[1:54:06] away some of you thought you were real
[1:54:08] far away and you've been brought very
[1:54:10] close
[1:54:12] god found you found your heart
[1:54:18] and you can see this how he had suffered
[1:54:21] things
[1:54:22] and he would have died within weeks
[1:54:24] brother jason the reason god allowed
[1:54:26] this weekend is because god knew if some
[1:54:28] of you wouldn't have been here there
[1:54:30] would have been trouble ahead
[1:54:32] so god fought through all of the
[1:54:34] unbelief so you could be here to be
[1:54:36] healed
[1:54:38] he was shy he was shaking
[1:54:42] this is shrek shriek or shrek this is
[1:54:44] our last person i'm going to introduce
[1:54:46] you to
[1:54:48] this this young person had held the the
[1:54:50] record for years before chris
[1:54:53] he was hiding in a cave
[1:54:55] they found him hiding in a cave
[1:54:59] next slide

[1:55:03] you know sheep look so different when
[1:55:05] they're shorn

[1:55:10] when god really works in our hearts amen

[1:55:23] commission we are commissioned
[1:55:25] to feed the lambs come down to their
[1:55:28] level
[1:55:29] and whatever it takes
[1:55:31] from going astray to being profitable
[1:55:34] what do you feel like that this sheep
[1:55:36] felt like after the wool was taken off
[1:55:38] what do you all feel like
[1:55:41] when all this wool and all this stuff is
