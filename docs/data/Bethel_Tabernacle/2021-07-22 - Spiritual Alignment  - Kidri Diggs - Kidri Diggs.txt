for us brothers and sisters i mean it just it makes us realize how much he loves us amen [Music] when he told you you're not good enough when he told you you're not right and when he told you you're not strong enough you put up a good fight when he told you you're not worthy when he told you you're not love when he told you you're not beautiful that you'll never be enough [Music] fear he is a

trouble you'll forever be alone when he told you you should run away you'll never find a home when he told you you were dirty and you should be ashamed when he told you you could be the one that grace

grace in his mercy fear is a liar false evidence is appearing real that's all fear is amen fear is only a perversion of strength so we thank god for revelation what he's given us let us all stand and we'll go for the lord in prayer amen i got a request for us to pray for sister abby uh she abigail she lost her her dog had to put him down so it's she's taking it kind of hard so we want to be mindful of that and pray for her and a friend of mine has her name is kesha she has to have some uh her shoulder looked at we know that god is in the mending and healing business so let's just any other prayer requests you can acknowledge it by uplifting hand if we want to stand in the gap for anyone we'll stand in the gap right now let's pray lord jesus father we lift our hands to you lord and we know that you're a soul and slaughter you're you're a friend beyond friends you're a comfort beyond comfort lord so lord we just ask father you just touch our precious sister right now a lost lord father we know how these things may be very sentimental very touching lord and no one knows lord what she's going through but lord we know that you know all things and lord god we pray father you would just be a comforter to her lord and to move all hurt and pain out of the way and lord for keisha lloyd who has to go to the doctor for her soldier her shoulder lord we know that you can change things before any results or any tests ever go forward so lord we plead the blood of jesus christ right now lord we plead the work of isaiah 53 lord that we're by your stripes were already healed and lord you know the the intent and the thoughts behind each and every hand that is raised to you tonight lord we just need you as an intercessor in our lives lord lord you will just make your find your way lord to that trouble to that problem lord and you take your seat on the throne lord and bring everything under subjection to your will and your way father whether we understand it or not let it be according to your divine pleasure lord we pray that you bless those who are hearing lord at the sound of our voice lord both present lord and those who may be streaming lord you're still the same god and we ask father you just move in a mighty way and lord bless the word father just move all flesh aside lord that you would speak to your creation afresh in the wonderful name of jesus christ we pray and we thank you let church say amen amen if you have your bibles let's turn to um saint john chapter one saint john chapter one let's start reading that verse eleven and from there we're gonna go to second peter chapter 1. john 1 and 11. the bible says he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as receive him to them gave he power to become sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen second peter chapter one for me verse of scripture let's um start at verse five now let's back up to four it says whereby are given unto us exceeding and great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brother kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of the lord jesus christ amen the lord blessed are you love his word you can have your seats amen tonight by god's grace i want to use for a simple thought if i may spiritual alignment spiritual alignment you know uh i think it's very important in the day we end for us as believers to make sure that we're solid on the word you know that we're not just taking a man's word for it but we're we're in our bibles we're studying our message and our life is aligned with the word of god because many times people hear the word but their life is not lining up with the word therefore it's no good what you're hearing amen so uh our whole duty is to be in check be lined up with the word of god and you know uh what's so special about our day god sent a word to make sure we were in line with his thoughts to make sure we were in line with what is preceding us a rapture amen you know so if we stay with what god has come and revealed to us you know you ask the question how can i miss it i'm in line with it amen i'm lined up right with the word so everything that comes after that should happen in my life you know because what i was thinking today that you know when we think of the word of god we think of the promises of god amen but one thing i want you to understand every word of god is a promise hallelujah it's not just you know you you look at a something in a certain statement or you say god said he'll do this but no every word hallelujah that proceedeth out of the mouth of god is a promise because he can't change it he can't take it back so whatever he said it has to come to pass so church the prophet of god said to us that when it comes to the word of god if you just take that same word and align yourself with that word you'll get the same results why because god can't change god can't lie god came out to his word god can't make no mistakes hallelujah so if we line up with the word it'll come out like it always does hallelujah but when you think of in alignment hallelujah you know this is kind of for the brothers but sisters will give you a little 101 of what it means to be aligned you know you take a car you know and you got fresh you got four fresh brand new tires and you know uh they look nice and they shiny and and they fit the car looking so good but if those tires are not aligned and they're not balanced you have a rough ride you can be driving a 600 000 mercedes benz but if those tires are not aligned the ride will be just as rough as a 30 000 wrangler jeep why because it's the alignment that makes the ride smooth wow and you wonder why we don't see god in our lives like we are too it's simple get in line with the word hallelujah you get in line with the word and things will smooth out things will ride alone like it's supposed to hallelujah you know when things are alive right you can hear them bump and sometimes you don't even feel it [Music] in alignment you know when your car is out of line what happens it wears down the wheels faster than they have to be and you could be driving and ignoring it driving and ignoring it but then it'll come a time where your car will start to pull a certain direction simply because it's out of line and as a believer or as a christian per se if your life is not in line with the word of god holy your flesh will begin to pull you in a direction in which you're aligned with hallelujah you're not just out there freelancing no you're in line to go a certain direction but this is the question is it god's way or is it your way hallelujah amen the alignment is no good without the proper balance oh hallelujah so you say oh brother diggs i know the prophet said this the prophet said that you got to have the right balance in the scripture for all of it to be smoothed because if you got that alignment and no balance your ride will still be rough hallelujah glory but you know god is coming he's sent his word just to get us to line back up and if i could run ahead a little bit hardly remember to profit his vision where he saw the church of the u.s and she was being led by a witch she was in line she was in step hallelujah but she was following a witch ma and she didn't even realize harley that she was marching to the beat of a witch hell yeah but then the prophet being able to see a true alignment he could say to that church get back his step line back up with the word so what god has come to do he sent a word for us that we can line back up with and be right in the channel of god that's why i read the scripture where it say to those who could receive god them he those are able to become the sons and daughters of god see he's giving us power to become something see this word it's not just here to tickle our ear no it's power to become something and that's what happens when you align with the word is god doing something in your life in alignment but how does god feel when you get underlined and you know church that car all four wheels have to be in line together because you can have the front two in line and the back two like this and the ride will still be wobbly hallelujah nice car but if it's not aligned right it'll still be wobbly church that goes for anything with wheels it can be attractive if it's not aligned hallelujah and that balance that ride will be rough it could be a wagon whoa it can be a motorcycle bike whatever hallelujah it has to be balanced and aligned so church as believers as those of us in this message of the hour we have to have the right spiritual alignment we can't follow things just because it sound good it has to have the right balance in it amen remember when the prophet preached marriage divorce and i'm not going to go into the doctrine of it but he said you got some who go this far that way and then you got some who go too far this way he said if there's a scriptural question it has to be a scriptural answer hallelujah so when you have questions that are scriptural look for it in the word of god don't wait for somebody to tell you what it means but no align yourself with the word you know as i was thinking about this thought and i ain't gonna be too long y'all know i'm about to close but as i was thinking about this thought i was thinking how god in the simplicity of who he is daily he's trying to keep us in line with the word simple he'll tell you go pray what is he doing he's keeping you in line with the word holy even if he even if god is requiring some worship and praise out of you he's trying to keep you in line with who he is why so he can stay close in your life because when you get out of line god lifts up and goes another direction oh my i'll give you an example of that god told in in in the book of uh samuel i think samuel 1 and 15. he told samuel samuel he told saul he said saul i want you to go down there and kill all the amla guys i want you to kill baby mother uh father ox cow every killer everything wipe it out everything that hamlet kites ever touch wipe it out don't have mercy on nothing my commandment to you is wipe it out but saul's problem was that word came through a man it came through a man whose name was samuel harlan but samuel got the word from where god and and we can see right now what's happening with people they're getting out of line man hallelujah thinking that the word william branham had came from him no it came from god so we're not aligning with branham's thoughts we're aligning with god's thoughts and saul he lightly esteemed what the prophet brought to him because he was looking at flesh and although he went out to do what god said he did it partially you think about how often we hear the word of god and we perform it partially god i came i pray brother man i preached a message called spring cleaning hallelujah and you know when you spring cleaning the first thing you got to do you got to sweep your house sisters know what i'm talking about you got to sweep your house you started to gather up things that you don't have any use for things that been in the closet for months and months and they just taking up space you know uh uh one thing i realized church you can build a 400 000 house but if nobody never stays in that brand new house it'll develop cobwebs hallelujah brand new it'll develop cobwebs if you never turn the water on hungry the pipes will get rusty if you never flush the toilet hallelujah it stands to get clogged up so everything about it has to be used or filled one point or the other you can't just have a house that's never been used hallelujah and you know what i think in this hour where it's time out for just good church members what is god getting usury out of your life amen because remember look at the simple alignment he had three men he gave one five talents he gave one two and he gave one one now he gave them according to their ability now he knew that the one who had five could bring back five more god will never give you more than you can handle wow and some of us feel like we're in a whirlwind he won't give you more than you can handle so i say to you right now if you're in a whirlwind stand on your feet and say god is on my side hallelujah if i'm in a whirlwind that means god put me there if i don't confess god put me there i'm giving the devil control over my life are you with me and that goes with anything we do as believers we have to align ourself with the scripture to know that nothing can happen to us except god allows it and y'all hear me say that so often hallelujah because it's a revelation to me so i look at things a little bit different you know some breakdowns just happened that that happened i'd be like oh oh lord what you feel to do in times past before i got the revelation before i realized the alignment harley things was happening you know what i'd say this is the devil how often we do that everything is not the devil hallelujah and if it is the devil god is using him so it's really not the devil the devil can't even be himself the devil's being used by ow the devil's being used by god the devil said oh look what i did i did this i did that and god said no i'll let you hallelujah it's like going to uh uh for those of us brothers who have young boys and say when your boy was five or six and he'd be like come on daddy let's race and you know you can beat them so you go out there and race them and you beat them and you beat them and you be like oh oh who i can't make i can't make it and he wins he was like ah daddy i beat you ah i beat you and you like yeah right because you know you have you know what kind of ability you have inside of you and you know that at that age that child is not fast enough to be able to beat you hallelujah so what i'm saying in this age the devil is not strong enough to be able to beat you hallelujah holy if we are aligned with the right word amen think about the church holly the prophet of god he said when jesus christ gave his life everything that adam lost is restored amen everything is restored what god-like characteristics god like nature what was adam before the fall he was in line with god wow he was so much in line with god god brought creation to adam and he said you name everything why because he knew adam would not venture out in some strange area he would say only what god would say hallelujah and now all of that has been restored unto us but let's go back let's go back um saul right quick god said go down there kill everything wipe it out kill the baby the mama the husband the the the sheep the oxen kill king egg kill it all and it looked like it looks like god is uh very unmerciful but no god always has a purpose in everything he does and now he gives that commandment and and saul goes out he heard the word come back from samuel he's like okay i'm going to do it he goes down there to the amalekites he wipe out everything that's not pleasant to the eye don't that sound like some of us god said get rid of this get rid of that and we'd be like well lord they i got it under control if you had it under control god wouldn't let it be heard in your ears to get rid of it holy a lot of times we hear things that are coming direct to us and we look and see who else is in the church who god talking to you oh i see anthony here he must be talking to anthony i see jd here he might be you can't be talking to me must be talking to him he can't be talking like he must be talking again again kate be talking to me that's what we do we uh what's that word we uh deflect we always deflect when god brings a word to bring us in line but we deflect we were like no lord i'm good i'm good can you imagine that you and i all of us we having a one-on-one with god and we tell god i'm good i couldn't even fix my mouth to tell god i'm good because if he's bringing a word for me to get in line i'm like help me lord i can't see what you see and sometimes god will bring a word for what you're about to face down the world down the road and if you're not receptable to it hallelujah when you get there you hit it like a brick wall because you may have thought that word wasn't for you now if i ask the question tonight how many of us can say that all of the word is not for us it's for all of us you say well the the preaching you're here preaching about a promiscuous woman you were like not me i'm married i got my husband i ain't doing none of that but what if you didn't have that husband you'd be in the same boat that woman was in hollywood so really that word is a word of grace to you because you're not fulfilling it right now hallelujah so church when you think about when you when you look at a uh saul saul goes down there and he saves a little bit of this and he saves a little bit of that and then he tries to get real spiritual with his alignment and he says you know what i'm going to keep these sheep i'm going to keep these oxen and you know what we're going to do we're going to sacrifice it unto the lord god didn't say go down there and prepare me to sacrifice why don't we do that god try to deal with us and we try to get more spiritual in god can you see this man try to get more spiritual than god god didn't ask for a sacrifice he said go down there and wipe it out basically god was saying ain't nothing down there i won't kill it all it's a hindrance to me so he begins to uh save a little bit of this and save a little bit of that and then the worst thing he could do he even spared the life of the king amen this man was out of lying bad you know how you can tell your card in line sisters i'm finna give you a lesson this is how you know your card line tonight when you're driving home if you let the steering wheel go and it doesn't stay in a straight line if it goes to a hard right or hard left it's definitely out of line just go home and tell your husband say honey we need to set an appointment with my car out of line you say how do you say how do you know you say well i turned the steering wheel loose and it ran wild on me oh that's how you know somebody's not where they're supposed to be the first opportunity they get to stay home hallelujah called coleman 19 they went hard right and we hadn't seen them since out of line and then they say oh brother i'm gonna stay home and i'm gonna watch it on the on the owner streaming oh my they out of balance i ain't saying you ain't got the vehicle i'm saying you got to be balanced and you got to be aligned because if you turn that thing loose and it just runs wild man you let that mess around hit somebody or run off the road but if you turn it loose if you have an opportunity just say for instance this church bethel bethel decides to uh come to south carolina we have joint meetings and some of y'all can't make it and you say man that's my opportunity to go to the movies you better take your alignment but if you align right you do everything you can to make sure you get something from that and this is the time we should be in we shouldn't be looking for breaks we should be looking for more of god in every area of our lives i've been preaching on influence and you know i i what i did with the message influence i put on a board a stream of every s every app cnn fox news everything you could everything that comes with a smart tv and you say brother i don't have cable i don't have this network no you got the apps and everything you need is on the app hallelujah and you say well brother jesus i'm not being influenced yes you are hello all of us have just come out of the biggest influence that the world has ever seen covert 19. everybody in this room was influenced by it you say not me yes she was i guarantee you to this day you got a mass somewhere in your vicinity don't tell me you wasn't influenced why did you do it because it was word it was a degree it was a word that went out and it said you can't come in the store without an ass you can't come to this restaurant without a mask you can't even have church without a mass what was happening he was being influenced by the virus but it's your attitude whether it's a long-term effect or not hallelujah great because you could fall under the influence of something and not feel the full effect of it hallelujah and i fell in the influence like you and different different people a lot of other people but you know what i thank god cause i never got used to it amen hallelujah sister amber there'll be times where i'm going in a store and i don't have my mask and i get right up to the door and the people looking at me like i'm crazy i'm like what's going on oh man got no mass i had to walk and don't be at walmart you got the wall scene like a mile all the way back to your car why because the whole world has been influenced by this particular thing everybody jumped in line in a worldly alignment hallelujah and some people got so aligned with it that they forgot about the spiritual alignment holly hey man it's easy to get aligned with the things of the world and forget that god has already answered this question god has already told us hallelujah that black stripes were healed god has already told us if we partake of any deadly thing it will not harm us isn't it the word of god so why are we so fearful a couple months ago we all were hungry we dropped into a carnal alignment you know what it was how he was called republican or democrat and we aligned ourselves by which team we're on when god had already sent a spiritual alignment and told us watch russia don't worry about all these politics i was in a church i was preaching and i said i made a statement i said i wouldn't mind if trump get another four years and you know they was looking at me like i was crazy why because i was first a black man and they have all these different movements but then when i said that it was like a man because it's considered to be a red state but then it turned into a blue and i told him i said say just put your hands down i said put your hands down i'm not saying that for the reasons you think my reasons are not political i say i could take another four years of him because he's the funniest president we ever had and he's always got something crazy to say that's not political they say oh oh oh mr trump do you think do you think joel will joe will attract the big crowd out here in connecticut or wherever he says no joe only attracts flies [Music] [Applause] [Music] who would love four more years of that [Music] let me move on but you know saw see you can't you can't stay with that stuff too long people get offended get the right alignment no matter who the president is one thing i want you to realize it's god's choice i don't know about you but i'm team jesus hallelujah so it don't matter who get in office my team always wins hallelujah we're never in a recession because god is never lacking anything church let me move on he says look he takes he takes back uh all the cute nice things and you know that's what we do we'll keep the things that's close in our vicinity that we don't think is harming nobody and god has told you plainly get rid of it line yourself up get rid of it hallelujah you know why i'm on here and i'm talking about influence you know uh uh parents it'll be uh uh you're due to your job to check your children's phones out don't just assume that they're not doing anything if they don't have the holy ghost what else can they do but be pulled into something that they shouldn't be pulled into this new stuff called tick-tock that's not just about dancing you thought that was just about you no it's one that's just a hook they got all kind of sexual things all kind of lustful things all kinds of things on it but they hide it under the umbrella of something that seems like it's not that bad but if you're not a parent that's checking up on these things your child will take a hard right and i'm old school why does a 12 year old need a cell phone anyway i'd be like you ain't got no job what you need a phone ball i can't i i gotta talk to my friend you see them at school tomorrow if what how many hours they be in school somebody tell me i can't even remember eight hours if y'all if eight hours ain't long enough to see that person something wrong you'll be there at school eight hours with them and you tell me you gotta come home and talk to them too man something right about that but you know what we do we get influenced we get a hair where you know someone so uh someone so got their child phone and you know hey you know i got i got to keep in touch with them and this and that well let me ask you something when you was the age who how does your parents keep in touch with you amen oh i know you had a beeper you had a pager yeah yeah yeah used to stop to the phone move every time they call you well mom yeah mom i'm at recess through that scene you see i know we laughing but you see how carnal things have gotten hurt we're being influenced hungry by the tactics and the and the the the the generalizations of the world and we're just going right along with it when we're supposed to be able to see these things and stop it in its tracks i ain't saying being fanatical but i'm saying hollywood some things need to be questioned hallelujah i know you're going to say well you know i got to deal with basketball yeah do what's best for your house by no by all means don't do what i do in mine do what you need to do in yours hallelujah but at the same time make sure you're aligned with what god wants you to do [Music] because me being in line with god hallelujah might mean no 12 year olds can't have no phone in my house but again the alignment in miles might mean that 12 year old can go get a job so move according to the convictions of your spiritual alignment amen but anyway saul comes saul comes back and now he's saying you know uh uh he did what the lord wanted samuel comes down there he says hey did you do what god said he said yes i did everything he says what is this bleeding of the sheep out here i hear sheep over here uh uh making fusses and nars and everything and this and that and he said well i did what god told he said no you didn't you did not god told you to go down and kill everything and you know what king hey guys go back and read it he was standing over there in the corner thought he was hiding but the word saw him hallelujah the word sorry but it still remain the same somebody has to be able to carry out what god has said no matter who get hurts somebody in the church has to be able to keep the word of god and samuel sitting there hallelujah look at that egg and he says just as you have made a mother motherless so will your mother y'all know i'm dramatic but i can just imagine being out of it like yeah that's how that's how you do it that's how you keep the word of god it might not look right but that's how if god said kill him you kill him amen samuel wiped him out and it wasn't even samuel's commission he told saul to do that don't get nervous church the prophet of god said when you won't be led by the spirit of the lord you'll be led by an evil spirit and he said right there the spirit of the lord left saul and an evil spirit came simply because he would not align himself with the word of god and he still thought he was good he still considered himself to be the king like everything was good till he found himself oh boy this is rich y'all pulling real good some good stuff coming to me you know he found himself you know sitting in church getting colder and colder we used to could have fellowship with samuel samuel ain't around no more but he's still king now he's still king but his life ain't the same no more what's happened it was that hard left and his life got so bad hallelujah that he lost the touch of god he lost the inspiration to god he got so bad that that false alignment led him in the arms of a witch don't play with disobedience him by simply not doing keeping the commandment of god not lining up with the word of god led him to the destiny of fellowship with a witch a man who once prophesied spoken tongues and walk with the people of god and now he's fellowshipping with a witch and i'm gonna say this one time and i'm gonna move on what do you think is gonna happen to the people that have left this truth they're not going to something greater it's leading them into a hard right or hard left remember the vehicle is no good without the proper balance and alignment they say oh y'all follow a man no i said the proper balance oh my and the spirit of god left him from that point an evil spirit came it was so bad he couldn't sleep at night demons jump on him he can't sleep at night he said bring me somebody that gonna fresh me bring me somebody that's lined up with god they brought him david oh my what did they bring they brought a man that was anointed by the same prophet's hands had the same horn of oil poured over his head by the same prophet oh my whoa what was happening it was now a paradigm shift hallelujah god was moving away from sorrow and putting david in that seat hallelujah but you know what i love about it david was not prepared for it he couldn't rely on how good he looked he couldn't rely on how good his clothes was when david was anointed he didn't even have time to take a bath hallelujah his brothers was all afreshed you know they probably put a hat on some good sprays i don't know they probably had on some brute they thought they were rugged and they come before the king and god said no no no no no no no they will not align with my word what did he say he said i want a man out of my very own heart he wasn't worried about how fresh he was his clothes and how how good he smells i know i want somebody who's gonna line up hallelujah and we know david had plenty of failures plenty of faults what was that alignment he could always repent hollywood he always found himself getting back hardly in alignment when he went to the left or to the right david always repented what did i do that brought him back to two thirty seconds you know what two thirty seconds is right two thirty seconds hallelujah or four thirty seconds hallelujah it's it's it's it's it's the it's the width of the rubber left on your tire yeah when you got two thirty seconds you still good when you hit four thirty seconds it's time for you to be looking for some more tires if i'm saying it right but i know people who drove from here to florida with wire coming out their tire thou shall not tempt the lord thy god you as a brother that's faith yeah oh i said like this you got to know god with you when you're doing stuff like that hallelujah because the prophet did drive his car down the road with one light and he knew he had one life but he got pulled over and the man told him you better fix that he said i was but the garage closed holiday but church you look now saul needs to be refreshed and god sends a man to refer look now this i want you to catch god sends a man to refresh him with the same anointing he once my god had ain't a different god it's the same god hallelujah we say i gotta get this preacher i gotta get that preacher to pray for him get this get that now it's the same anointing but where's your faith and i'm not taking away that some people have gifts but in this case david was now the anointed king and what was saul saul was once the anointed king but the difference is david could stay in line amen hallelujah so much so to that when saul got so much out of line hallelujah he found himself doing things that he wouldn't ordinarily do david saw kill his thousands david killed his tens of thousands so kill his thousands david kill his tenza saw him kill his thousand david kill his tents a thousand saucy know what they're like threw a javelin at david for only going to do what he asked him to do song was the one who told him to go kill him and now he made it man cause he did a good job you see what happens when you get out of line gonna use somebody right in your church and the spirit of jealousy will rise up actually said why are you jealous when this is your brother or your sister you got the same god let me move on i don't spend too much time with that but you look god because david was in line he could stay spiritually aligned god could continuously used him to the day he died even through his mistakes and boy did he get when i said hard left he did a hard left a u-turn ran a light stop sign everything david did all kind of stuff david david david was the equivalent of doing a hundred and fifty in a 35 mile pounds on he was reckless driving but god knew that wasn't in his heart so god gave him mercy because whenever god showed him you know he's talking to nathan we know the story he's talking to nathan he'd say david there's a man who had uh x amount of sheep in this one man had one sheep and this man who had so much came and took this man once she david said i'mma kill him i'ma kill him this is a hit-and-run i'mma kill him and then they didn't say david it was you you were drunk that night you was the one who did it he was like oh my god i have sinned now see what's happening he's getting back in line he's falling on his leaves he's not pushing it off like saul it was the people i can't go back yeah i know cove it over but them people at that church i'm so sick of hearing that then people at the church and they said this and them people them people that you know think about them people at walmart think about them people that outback when you go in there and how they look at you and how they talk about you but that don't stop you from eating your steak and potato but when it comes to church i just can't go back there no more [Music] you can find some hair in your food and go back the next week that was that was just an honest mistake and don't get somebody to deal you'll forget all about it oh they gave me a free meal like we used to say back in the day chad please let me read you something i'ma get out your way listen i i sent you these quotes brother you should have them on the email but this this is in the message um restoration of the bride tree why is it important to stay with the revealed word because it keeps us in line which keeps us close to god because god is what his word and as long as we are in line with the word god is always near somebody talk to me now we got to believe that listen he says this is in uh uh restoration laboratory paragraph 133 he says now if the court writes out a word it is certain it's a certain thing a penalty he said do so and so all right now that's the word of the court and the law of the court enforces the word of the court so if there's a word that the court writes side they say uh uh 12 o'clock 12 o'clock noon every day nobody can have on blue shoes that's a law they make that a law every time they catch when any of us 12 o'clock with blue shoes on there'll be a penalty right because that's the law of the court and you have to uh uh suffer those consequences of breaking that law but if you align yourself with that law you can never be touched talk to me church in the speed limit 75 and you stay 75 you'll never get a ticket hallelujah why because you're in line hallelujah you've lined yourself up holly oh dude your car can go faster but you stay in line to protect yourself hallelujah that's why the world has been given to us to protect ourselves hell yeah not to put us in bondage harley not to make us seem different no to stay under god's protected hand hallelujah we have the word of the court and what was it come out of her my people verse 31 34. he says 134 he says and god speaks something and that is a law if god speaks something it's a law he said and the holy spirit is here to enforce it god somebody oh my i'm going to encourage myself brother matt god says in his word if i bring to his storehouse first if i pay my tithes and offerings that i am blessed and you know what that is a law and the holy ghost has to enforce it amen if i am in line with that word hallelujah so you know what it don't matter what my bank account looked like the law says i am blessed amen amen and everything i need i've already got it because i'm blessed why because i'm spiritually aligned wow says rebecca you can look at your account right now and say negative 200 that don't mean nothing because god's word is a promise he can take away that madness and put a plus there at any time hardly before you leave service you might get a cash out because it's a law hell yeah the bible said let the weak say i am strong that's a law you just got to say it holy in matthew 7 chapter he says ask hallelujah and what it shall be given seek and ye shall find knock and the door shall be opened what is that it's a law don't be afraid to ask don't be afraid to seek don't be afraid to knock it's a law just line yourself up he said if you ask anything you ask the father anything in my name i will do it so tonight when you pray pray in the name of jesus christ line yourself up with that word [Applause] because the scriptures say anyone that asks it receive it anyone that seeketh shall find anyone that knock it the door shall be opened unto them oh my i feel encouraged he says the holy spirit is here to enforce that law and then behind it the prophet says amen wow for the believer you have to be ordained to do so and it takes a believer you got to have the badge of believer somebody says you don't have power no but we got authority hallelujah that's it not power but authority we ain't got enough power to do nothing what is it we got authority oh my let me move on let me get out y'all way listen i want to read this and i'm gonna close which am i being aligned with god's word this way he's coming out the message of god proving his word somebody say amen god doing what proving his word holy so what i mean god is basically saying whatever i said i can prove it god told me oh my how many ever had to prove your word before it's like you go on a job you get hired you got to prove that you're able to do it hallelujah listen um we're here at um paragraph 85. this isn't um i'm proving his word listen he says but abraham didn't stagger anywhere at all of unbelief he believed that god was able to perform that which he had promised what is the promise whatever god said in his word and we got to believe god is able to do any of it or let me say all of it hallelujah he's able to perform that which he promised that god will prove his word no matter how long it took but instead of getting weaker each time like we are prone to do he got stronger all the time if it didn't happen today tomorrow it will be a great america how many of us think like that oh i prayed about this but these didn't happen yet you know what he's doing he's setting you up for a greater miracle hell yeah he said if it didn't happen today or tomorrow will be a great america because it's one day older that was that was god that was god and abraham for he knowed that god proved all his word to be so if his children would only take his word so he can prove it by you how does god prove his word he proved this word by you holly hallelujah so if you get in line with the word god will always prove you oh my i hope y'all caught that he said if his children will only take his word so he can prove his word by you that's the only way he can prove his word he doesn't prove it to unbelievers they can't be proof they are believers but it's not to be it's not to unbelievers it's not for unbelievers he said it's to him that believe and if he can find something who will believe his word he will prove his word by you and sometimes sickness listen to us now and sometimes sickness and things happen to us that way that god can prove himself i'll predict i'm going through this i'm going to do that god is wanting to prove himself say oh i got an issue with this god is wanting to prove himself he will let sickness come so he can prove he let kovac come shut down the world so he can show he's bigger than the shutdown [Music] glory god drop down drop down to 115 same message paragraph 115. he says and as long as you are in the line of duty keeping god's word doing just what he told you to do marching by the orders of god you've got a right to say to that mountain be moved hallelujah you can make a mountain light up hallelujah with the orders of god in your life did you hear that you can make a mountain line up hallelujah with the orders of god in your life and if there's a mountain in your way hallelujah and you're in the line of duty hollywood how does that mountain lines up it gets out the way wow so it may not be in your direct path that mountain will have to take a hard left or hard right to be in line with the orders of god while you're on duty hallelujah glory to god see that's why he said if all these things is second peace i'm closing come on musicians that's why he said he said if all these things be in you and abound you will never be bearing nor unfruitful amen why because you're in line as long as they're virtue there's patience there's brotherly kindness there's knowledge there's temperance holy there's godliness all you're in line with all these things there's a spiritual alignment going all the way up to charity you'll never be barren nor unfruitful why am my closing what makes the earth bring forth grass what makes the earth bring forth life and seed what keeps it going it's simple the earth gets back in line with the sun there's a fall there's a winter spring and then when summer hits everything's in line and it starts to come forth hallelujah into a harvest amen and as long as everything is in a line like it's supposed to supposed to do the sun will always bring forth that of itself because it's the sun it's the power of the sun being in line with creation that brings forth life no matter how cold the winter was [Music] it can't stop it once it's in line and no matter where you come from no matter how many sins you may have committed if you ever get back in line with the sun hallelujah i promise you you'll bring forth what's inside of you amen tonight you got a need of god holy find your scripture line up with it and i guarantee you god will fulfill what that scripture is hallelujah remember there's a woman the prophet talked about who aligned herself spiritually with the word of god she said lord i can't let my baby down like this eyes just like that shoot her mic what was she doing she was lining herself up with the word she said i'm just like that shooter my now where's my elijah whoa and her getting in place means that the rest of the scripture had to come to pass and if you ever get in place scripturally the rest of the scripture has to follow you hallelujah let's get spiritually in line let's stop looking for excuses church this is my prayer you know i you like i was saying social media and and all these things i'm you know i'm i'm i'm i'm putting back you know stop spending so much time idle time [Music] so much instagram so much twitter so much facebook so much fox news so much cnn so much youtube so much do so much that let's get back into that alignment church it'll work because whatever's in you is going to come out and you know a lot of times and the lord's been showing us to me a lot of times i'm speaking to you the reason why you can't hear me because you got all that other stuff going on you got all them other things going on but if you quiet that down and you're in tune hallelujah with the great physician hallelujah and it's symphony hallelujah every beat you know hallelujah when when when when you got a good ear hallelujah you can even hear the symbols being tapped amen the conductor can hear all that [Music] that's why he stands there he knows everybody's place he knows exactly where they're supposed to hit and he may be doing us and you you don't even realize the people that are in the back you don't even realize he knows everybody's key he knows everybody's cue he knows how it's all supposed to be in harmony and when you're not doing what you're supposed to do he'll do like this point you out hallelujah and just help you get back in pace and once you get back in he'll tell everybody else come on and then it goes oh my god maybe god has his one on one body somebody tonight but he wants to let you know you're not all by yourself hallelujah this is god symphony hallelujah he wants everybody spiritually aligned tonight [Music] we align with god symphony he's the great composer don't worry about the next man you just play your part maybe all god wants you to do is just tap [Music] maybe you're the one that's knocking maybe somebody else is supposed to be seeking maybe somebody else is supposed to be asking but it's all the law of god just do your part you know brother brandon was talking to a woman he said brother brother i did i didn't fast out and prayed i did everything i still can't cast this demon out he said no your part is too fast to pray let somebody else cast out the amen hallelujah let's pray [Music] bow ahead say man maybe you got something in your life that caused you to take a hard right or a hard left and you know you're not in line just ask god to be merciful tonight say lord bring me back on the right path lord that you could have your way with me that i won't wear myself out trying to go down this road but it'll be smooth and balanced because i'm in your will that's what we want to be hallelujah will you say lord keep me in your providence lord let's pray lord jesus father we are your people we're the sheep of your pastor lord lord we pray father that we'll all be able to see you lord in every aspect of our lives and we'll always want to be in line with the law
