[48:35] speaking for brother brother blue there
[48:37] in Green Pond and so you would just want
[48:40] to be remembering brother blue amen and
[48:42] and his health and just that whole uh uh
[48:46] situation there but my dad went there to
[48:48] be an encouragement brother Maurice
[48:49] asked him so uh we just believe that
[48:52] amen the Lord is everywhere ain't that
[48:55] awesome about God he can be anywhere
[48:57] all the time amen and the Bible says

[50:04] are you going to do your part amen and
[50:06] pull on the gift I can promise you
[50:08] brother Ronnie's asked the Lord what
[50:10] would you have me speak and he could do
[50:12] all the preparation prayed and and got
[50:15] himself out of the way but uh that's not
[50:17] the only part but brother brandom said

[56:08] and we just pray that the Lord's been
[56:10] faithful and been with you through this
[56:12] week and
[56:14] amen amen if you have your Bibles turn
[56:16] to the Book of Romans the 10th chapter
[56:18] we thank brother Jason for the that's
[56:20] what I'm missing I knew I was missing
[56:22] something for the opportunity to speak
[56:24] here once again of course to bring
[56:26] readings from our home church and
[56:27] brother Wayne and the
[56:28] Saints Romans the 10th
[56:31] chapter the 8th
[56:35] verse but what saith it the word is nigh
[56:39] thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart
[56:43] that is the word of faith somebody say
[56:46] the word of faith Word of Faith the word
[56:48] of faith which we preach that if Thou
[56:51] shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord
[56:54] Jesus
[56:58] from the dead Thou shalt be saved for
[57:01] with a heart man believeth under
[57:02] righteousness and with the mouth
[57:04] confession is made unto
[57:07] salvation for the scripture sayith
[57:09] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[57:11] ashamed for there is no difference
[57:13] between the Jew and Greek for the same
[57:15] Lord over all is Rich unto all that call
[57:18] upon him for whosoever shall call upon
[57:20] the name of the Lord shall be
[57:22] saved how then shall we call upon him
[57:26] call on him in whom they have not
[57:28] believed and how shall they believe in
[57:30] him of whom they have not heard and how
[57:32] shall they hear without a preacher and
[57:34] how shall they preach except they be
[57:36] sent as it is written how beautiful are
[57:38] the feet of them that preach the gospel
[57:39] of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good
[57:42] things but they have not yet all obeyed
[57:45] the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who hath
[57:47] believed are report so then Faith cometh
[57:52] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[57:55] God Amen you may be seated tonight as
[57:57] God will bless this word to us I know
[57:59] that's a familiar scripture to us so
[58:01] then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[58:05] of the word of God uh tonight I just if
[58:08] we have a title uh would just speak
[58:10] tonight on a pure language like to speak
[58:13] on a pure language and so we read this
[58:15] in the scripture that our faith uh is
[58:18] the gospel which we preach right this is
[58:20] a Word of Faith which we are preaching
[58:22] and uh we can say a lot of different
[58:24] things that might encourage us in a lot
[58:25] of different ways but when there's a
[58:27] Word of Faith preached it it it actually
[58:29] moves mountains it actually changes
[58:31] situations and it's not it's not just
[58:33] mind over matter but there is an element
[58:35] of strength God bless you brother Joe
[58:36] it's good to see you there's an element
[58:38] of strength that comes from having faith
[58:41] in something that is greater than
[58:42] whatever you're going through right so
[58:44] we can have faith in in sickness and we
[58:47] can have faith in our disparity and we
[58:48] can have faith in our sorrows but that
[58:51] is never that is never going to amount
[58:53] to a victory but if we could have faith
[58:55] in something that will lead us out of
[58:57] those sorrows and out of those
[58:59] situations then that's where our faith
[59:01] should be planted is that right let's
[59:03] just turn to the Book of John the 8th
[59:05] chapter we'll take a little bit of time
[59:06] here in these scriptures if that's okay
[59:08] and I know uh they'll just probably
[59:10] follow along with me so uh the eth
[59:13] chapter and the 36th verse if the son
[59:15] therefore shall make you free you shall
[59:17] be free indeed and I know that you're
[59:20] Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me
[59:23] because my word hath no place in you W
[59:26] and I speak that which I have seen with
[59:28] my father and ye do that which you have
[59:31] seen of your father right now my word
[59:34] had no place in you is not speaking to
[59:35] this church tonight but he's talking to
[59:37] a group of Pharisees that are claiming
[59:39] to be looking for the coming Messiah but
[59:41] there he is standing to them speaking to
[59:44] them there they are looking for truth
[59:46] and truth is actually speaking to them
[59:48] and they don't recognize truth standing
[59:50] in their midst and he said my my my word
[59:52] have no place in you I remember some
[59:54] time ago brother Brad that they had that
[59:56] bod's exhibit across you know United
[59:58] States and we went there to the bod's
[1:00:00] exhibit and went into the they actually
[1:00:02] have all of these cabers that were were
[1:00:04] taken so that you could see the how how
[1:00:06] Magnificent the human body is put
[1:00:08] together and we went into this chamber
[1:00:10] where the heart laid brother Joe I
[1:00:11] wanted to see the heart and I believe
[1:00:13] what the prophet said but I wanted to
[1:00:14] see it with my own eyes and there in
[1:00:16] that chamber that heart is dissected
[1:00:18] into just millimeters and sure enough in
[1:00:20] the center of that heart there is a
[1:00:22] place there there's a there's a little
[1:00:23] space about the size of a button and
[1:00:26] that place is not touched by your own
[1:00:28] blood but it's actually capsulated
[1:00:30] inside of your heart muscle I know
[1:00:31] there's probably some medical
[1:00:32] professionals but that's the way I
[1:00:33] understood it when I read about it
[1:00:35] online that there's a place there and
[1:00:37] actually your blood just circulates
[1:00:38] around it and there's a place within
[1:00:40] there that is not tampered and brother
[1:00:41] bam said that place was put there by God
[1:00:44] for his word to have a dwelling place
[1:00:46] and I'm thankful tonight that this
[1:00:47] scripture is not talking to me but I
[1:00:49] have a place within me where that word
[1:00:52] can abide you know brother B would say
[1:00:54] we did not come we did not be become
[1:00:56] seed by rebirth but we were seed and
[1:00:58] therefore were reborn for only the elect
[1:01:01] can be reborn because we were seed is
[1:01:04] the reason we could be quickened in
[1:01:07] nonseed there is nothing to Quicken
[1:01:10] aren't you glad that you've been
[1:01:11] quickened tonight aren't you glad this
[1:01:13] word has a place in you they answered
[1:01:15] and said to him Abraham is Our Father
[1:01:17] and Jesus said to them if you were
[1:01:18] Abraham's children ye would do the works
[1:01:21] of
[1:01:23] Abraham but now you seek to kill me a
[1:01:25] man that had told you the truth which I
[1:01:28] have heard of God this did not Abraham
[1:01:30] ye do the Deeds of your father then and
[1:01:32] then he's he's telling them who their
[1:01:34] father is right you do the Deeds of
[1:01:36] their father then they said unto him we
[1:01:37] be not born of fornication we have one
[1:01:39] father even God and Jesus said to them
[1:01:41] if God were your father ye would love me
[1:01:46] for I proceeded forth and came from God
[1:01:48] neither came I of myself but he sent me
[1:01:51] why do you not understand my speech even
[1:01:56] because you cannot hear my word now he's
[1:01:59] speaking to them in the same language
[1:02:00] they're all talking the same language
[1:02:02] right whether it's Aramaic or or or
[1:02:04] Hebrew they're all speaking the same
[1:02:05] language in this conversation but he's
[1:02:07] telling them you're not understanding
[1:02:08] what I'm saying even because you cannot
[1:02:11] hear my word ye are of your father the
[1:02:13] devil and the lust of your father you
[1:02:16] will do now those some pretty strong
[1:02:17] words to to say to a group of Pharisees
[1:02:20] but he's telling them now what was the
[1:02:21] works of their father the devil right
[1:02:23] the The Works of the devil in the
[1:02:24] beginning was to hybrid the word to to
[1:02:27] to mix the word to mix it with an idea
[1:02:29] or mix it with theology The Works of the
[1:02:32] devil in the beginning was to hybrid
[1:02:34] that word to Eve right so that was the
[1:02:35] works of their father and the lust of
[1:02:38] your father you will do as he was a
[1:02:39] murderer from the beginning and Abode
[1:02:41] not in the truth because there is no
[1:02:43] truth in him when he speaketh a lie he
[1:02:46] speaketh of his own for he is a liar and
[1:02:48] the father of it and because I tell you
[1:02:51] the truth ye believe me not there some
[1:02:55] powerful words
[1:02:56] here he is telling them the truth he is
[1:02:58] truth he's the embodiment of Truth and
[1:03:01] because he's speaking to them truth they
[1:03:03] cannot believe him they can't take him
[1:03:05] at his word and because I tell you the
[1:03:08] truth you believe me not and which of
[1:03:09] you convince me of sin and and if I say
[1:03:12] the truth why do you not believe me he
[1:03:16] that is of God heareth God's words ye
[1:03:20] therefore hear them not because ye are
[1:03:22] not of God I'm thankful tonight that we
[1:03:24] hear God's words I'm thankful that we
[1:03:26] have a place there provided where we
[1:03:28] have recognized there's a greater
[1:03:30] Authority than us there's a voice of
[1:03:32] truth that has come into our life and we
[1:03:34] recognize that because there is a place
[1:03:36] prepared for that truth to abide in
[1:03:38] there amen and and I I don't think we
[1:03:40] should take that for granted tonight to
[1:03:42] say I I I just I just I recognize that
[1:03:44] we're not where we want to be Brother
[1:03:46] Brad we're not where we want to be but
[1:03:48] we're not what we used to be we're not
[1:03:51] where we where we want to be in our our
[1:03:52] vision but we're not where we used to be
[1:03:54] and I think we ought to just encourage
[1:03:55] enourage ourselves tonight in the word
[1:03:57] to say we see this as the truth and
[1:04:00] that's not for everybody else out there
[1:04:02] but it's to an elected seed that God ha
[1:04:04] for ordained before the foundation of
[1:04:06] the world that you might see this as a
[1:04:09] living reality I just want to patch you
[1:04:11] on the back tonight and say good job
[1:04:13] you're still here you're still serving
[1:04:15] you're still pressing on even though the
[1:04:17] trials have come but nothing can shake
[1:04:19] you from this truth because this truth
[1:04:22] was put there before the shaking time
[1:04:24] came before the burden came came before
[1:04:26] The Sickness came this truth was already
[1:04:28] deposited within you right but there's
[1:04:31] something to this understanding he's
[1:04:33] saying how come you cannot understand me
[1:04:34] and I believe everybody in here probably
[1:04:36] understands English and I know my
[1:04:37] English is broken but you understand the
[1:04:40] speech of what I'm saying right but to
[1:04:42] understand the meaning of it to
[1:04:45] understand what I'm really saying now I
[1:04:46] could say something I I'm sure down here
[1:04:48] in in South Carolina probably got some
[1:04:50] saying brother Brad probably got some
[1:04:51] sayings in Tennessee that he could say
[1:04:53] and I wouldn't know what he was talking
[1:04:54] about
[1:04:56] you know we go back down there in the
[1:04:57] holler and it's finer than frog fur and
[1:04:59] I'm I'm completely lost about what we're
[1:05:01] talking about
[1:05:03] now but you see there's a difference
[1:05:05] between just speaking the same physical
[1:05:07] language and understanding a language
[1:05:09] that's being spoken there's a difference
[1:05:11] between just the speech of what you're
[1:05:12] hearing and understand the meaning of
[1:05:14] what's coming behind it right and that
[1:05:16] meaning that understanding can only come
[1:05:19] by Revelation right so then Faith cometh
[1:05:23] by hearing and hearing by the word word
[1:05:25] of God I'm sorry if I'm moving a little
[1:05:27] fast but I got too much content so I'm
[1:05:29] just cutting through it that's okay
[1:05:31] hearing comes by the word of God so the
[1:05:34] only way you can really hear something
[1:05:35] is to understand it now there's a lot of
[1:05:38] churches that'll read a lot of scripture
[1:05:39] but are they understanding what they're
[1:05:41] reading but it takes a a select group of
[1:05:44] people to be given Revelation to
[1:05:47] understand what those words mean right
[1:05:49] we could say it like this it's a
[1:05:50] Heavenly language it's something Beyond
[1:05:53] just reading the text or reading the
[1:05:54] scriptures if it was just just reading
[1:05:56] the scripture uh brother Luther it would
[1:05:58] have been over 2,000 years ago because
[1:06:00] they had the same Scrolls that we have
[1:06:01] today so it's just not a matter of
[1:06:03] reading through this but for 2,000 years
[1:06:06] men have tried to understand what these
[1:06:09] words mean they have tried to put into a
[1:06:12] a revelation or an understanding or a
[1:06:14] reality about what these words mean but
[1:06:16] I believe we live in an age where all
[1:06:18] things are are are have come to pass all
[1:06:21] things are made truth all things have
[1:06:23] been made light there's a man that came
[1:06:25] that turned turned on the light to this
[1:06:26] word and now we can see it as it is and
[1:06:30] understand it as it was spoken in the
[1:06:31] beginning is that all right now now it
[1:06:34] takes some training to do this right it
[1:06:37] takes an ability to to to get under a
[1:06:40] tutorship man would say this in
[1:06:42] handwriting on the wall uh speaking of
[1:06:45] Daniel here and quickly being in a
[1:06:46] modern place the Bible said he called in
[1:06:48] all of his suers and astronomers all of
[1:06:51] the Bishops the doctors the popes the
[1:06:53] Cardinals and so forth and I tell you
[1:06:56] gentlemen I have given you the privilege
[1:06:57] to preach and to do what you wanted to
[1:06:59] do now interpret for me that on the
[1:07:02] wall I would not want to be in their
[1:07:04] shoes brother
[1:07:05] Joe now I've given you all of this
[1:07:08] leeway and now comes your time to shine
[1:07:11] there's a message on the wall interpret
[1:07:13] it for me but just as it was then so it
[1:07:17] is now they wasn't used to the
[1:07:19] supernatural they know nothing about it
[1:07:22] they didn't know how to interpret
[1:07:23] unknown tongues they know nothing about
[1:07:25] a Heavenly language they were
[1:07:27] dumbfounded they know nothing about it
[1:07:29] and they all just stood there remember
[1:07:32] this is the bringing in of the Gentile
[1:07:34] Kingdom and it has to come out under the
[1:07:36] under and it has to come out under the
[1:07:38] Supernatural and it'll go out under the
[1:07:40] supernatural but these Bishops and
[1:07:42] Cardinals and great doctors could not
[1:07:44] interpret the supernatural they know
[1:07:47] nothing about it they look through all
[1:07:48] of their books of art they could not
[1:07:50] find nothing that would compare with
[1:07:52] that and you see spiritual Things Are
[1:07:55] spiritually
[1:07:56] understood let me write that down
[1:07:59] spiritual things are spiritually
[1:08:02] understood and then they were all
[1:08:04] Disturbed and they didn't know what to
[1:08:06] do they didn't know what to do and they
[1:08:08] spent their whole life training for this
[1:08:10] moment right all the books amen all the
[1:08:13] books and all the schools if we started
[1:08:15] right now I don't care how young you are
[1:08:17] you could not catch up to them because
[1:08:19] they had spent their entire life and
[1:08:21] their father's life before them trying
[1:08:22] to understand the things of God but yet
[1:08:24] when it came to his Supernatural event
[1:08:26] they could not explain it they they did
[1:08:29] not know how to explain a paradox right
[1:08:32] there was something Beyond them that
[1:08:33] they could not put their hands on it
[1:08:34] because they couldn't with their
[1:08:35] intellect and and their their education
[1:08:38] explain what those words were they stood
[1:08:40] there dumbfounded but yet there was one
[1:08:42] among them that was not educated in the
[1:08:44] same schools that they were educated in
[1:08:46] but he was educated by a higher
[1:08:48] authority in those classrooms that they
[1:08:50] said in and he understood what was on
[1:08:53] that wall right that same King had dream
[1:08:55] dreams right and he had dreams and he
[1:08:57] said you know if you're really spiritual
[1:08:59] men you tell me what I dreamed and you
[1:09:01] tell me the interpretation of it they
[1:09:02] said that's impossible but yet there was
[1:09:04] a man there that was gifted of God that
[1:09:07] could do the very Supernatural among
[1:09:09] them and not only tell them what they
[1:09:11] dream but tell them what it meant it
[1:09:13] would take a Divine Prophet to do that
[1:09:15] it would take a godsent word Prophet to
[1:09:18] vindicate God's Authority in that age to
[1:09:20] do those works is that right so a a
[1:09:23] supernatural language is not just
[1:09:25] something that's openly spoken but it's
[1:09:27] something that only some people
[1:09:30] speak now we can teach English class
[1:09:32] tonight I'm not going to be the guy to
[1:09:33] teach you broken English as it is but
[1:09:36] how many in here are bilingual there
[1:09:37] anybody in here bilingual speak I heard
[1:09:38] brother Matt actually on the job
[1:09:40] speaking some Spanish to some some
[1:09:42] workers earlier this week and I actually
[1:09:45] I had to go look outside the door to
[1:09:46] make sure I had the right guy but it was
[1:09:47] in fact him speaking Spanish now if I
[1:09:50] brought everybody in here tonight and I
[1:09:52] said brother Matt's going to teach us
[1:09:53] how to speak Spanish I don't think he'd
[1:09:55] probably sign up for the job right
[1:09:57] because there's a native language and
[1:09:58] then there's a language that we can get
[1:09:59] by in right there's a language that we
[1:10:01] kind of dabble in a little bit and we
[1:10:03] probably say things backwards and
[1:10:04] they're probably laughing at us while
[1:10:05] we're saying it
[1:10:08] and you know it it it causes it causes a
[1:10:11] lot of frustration when you don't
[1:10:13] understand the language I don't know how
[1:10:15] many if we have a new some new people or
[1:10:17] some new folks off the street maybe and
[1:10:18] you start coming in here and it took a
[1:10:20] minute to understand what was being
[1:10:21] preached cuz it was all new to you right
[1:10:23] it was it was something foreign almost
[1:10:25] like what what does this mean and what
[1:10:26] do these terms mean and you see it's a
[1:10:28] language being spoken and and it's
[1:10:30] almost like a code right it's almost
[1:10:32] something that everybody next to you
[1:10:34] understands what's happening and you
[1:10:35] feel why don't I understand what's
[1:10:36] happening right because they speak a
[1:10:37] different language than you
[1:10:39] speak and it causes sometimes
[1:10:41] frustration or confusion I don't know
[1:10:43] how many of us have been overseas but if
[1:10:45] you go overseas and you're riding in the
[1:10:46] car whether the Matt you've been
[1:10:47] overseas and you're riding in the car
[1:10:49] and you're maybe driving to church you
[1:10:50] don't know where you're going cuz you
[1:10:52] don't speak the language they just told
[1:10:54] you to be in the lobby this certain
[1:10:55] certain time and there you are and then
[1:10:57] they pick you up and then you get in the
[1:10:58] car and they're speaking and they're
[1:10:59] talking but you have no idea where
[1:11:00] you're going cuz you don't understand
[1:11:02] the language and you just pray there's
[1:11:03] an interpreter there when you get there
[1:11:05] that understands English and they could
[1:11:07] be taking you to another country they
[1:11:09] could be taking you and you don't know
[1:11:10] if they hated the service or they liked
[1:11:12] it or if you're going to eat or you
[1:11:13] don't know anything about it because
[1:11:14] you're confused because you don't speak
[1:11:15] the language right and when you get back
[1:11:18] home you're so glad that you can hear in
[1:11:20] the airport well sometimes you're glad
[1:11:21] that you can understand the language
[1:11:23] that's around you say oh I'm almost home
[1:11:25] my they're speaking my language
[1:11:27] right there's the people that are
[1:11:29] speaking my language and if you get out
[1:11:32] amongst the wrong people for sometime it
[1:11:34] won't be your language at all and you
[1:11:35] won't understand what they have to say
[1:11:37] and you feel out of place and you feel
[1:11:39] frustrated and you'll feel why am I here
[1:11:41] but when you get amongst people that
[1:11:42] speak the same language that you speak
[1:11:45] you're almost home you recognize I'm
[1:11:47] back on my ground I'm back on my turf
[1:11:50] this is where I belong this is my native
[1:11:52] language and maybe you were born out in
[1:11:55] the World somewhere and you spoke a
[1:11:56] totally different language than you do
[1:11:58] tonight but when you came home there was
[1:12:00] a native language there that you
[1:12:02] understood the meaning of it you
[1:12:04] understood the power of it you
[1:12:05] understood that it had a a a superior
[1:12:09] authority to any other language out
[1:12:11] there it's the language of the word
[1:12:14] right this is where this is where Satan
[1:12:16] got into God to try to get into God's
[1:12:18] kingdom was to by division right n we
[1:12:22] could go we could take the time to read
[1:12:23] the quotes we understand it was nimrod's
[1:12:25] Tower of Babel right brother Ram says
[1:12:27] that's where denomination started
[1:12:28] because they all spoke one language
[1:12:30] going into that room and they all walked
[1:12:32] out every man speaking his own language
[1:12:34] and now you had fellowship with somebody
[1:12:36] you couldn't fellowship with
[1:12:37] anymore maybe it was your brother maybe
[1:12:39] it was your father maybe it was your
[1:12:41] sister but you walked into that room
[1:12:42] speaking the same language and by man's
[1:12:45] Wisdom trying to understand the of God
[1:12:48] it divided
[1:12:50] them you can go back and read your
[1:12:52] scripture to study these points but it
[1:12:54] Nimrod was the start of denominational
[1:12:56] Works in mankind because that's where
[1:12:58] division took place and that's how we
[1:13:00] recognize where the devil's at work he
[1:13:03] hates when brothers are in unity the
[1:13:05] devil absolutely hates when we can speak
[1:13:08] the same language in one Accord and in
[1:13:10] one mind so his his root cause is to
[1:13:13] cause us to divide amongst one another
[1:13:15] and get a get a get a get a an angle
[1:13:18] against this brother an angle against
[1:13:19] that sister I appreciate you brother Joe
[1:13:21] coming in tonight I know you're
[1:13:22] pastoring and to come in and just have
[1:13:24] that you tonight where we can we're
[1:13:26] we're together there's not different
[1:13:28] different isms and different schisms but
[1:13:30] we're together we should be United more
[1:13:33] than ever underneath this message and if
[1:13:35] we're still worried about this Doctrine
[1:13:37] or that Doctrine or that Doctrine all
[1:13:39] we're doing is fighting with each other
[1:13:41] and we're not fighting the devil we're
[1:13:42] fighting against this and fighting
[1:13:44] against that but we're not fighting
[1:13:45] against the devil and let me say tonight
[1:13:47] that your only enemy is the Devil
[1:13:50] Himself it's not you it's not you it's
[1:13:52] not me we are not each other's enemy but
[1:13:54] the enemy tonight we need to fight is
[1:13:57] the Devil
[1:13:59] Himself and if we're not we're not even
[1:14:01] at ABCs yet we haven't even come out of
[1:14:04] kindergarten yet we need to recognize
[1:14:06] that there is a real enemy and it's not
[1:14:09] your sister it's not your brother it's
[1:14:12] not
[1:14:14] me the devil is at
[1:14:17] work to recognize that that is his
[1:14:19] desire is to divide to kill steal and
[1:14:24] destroy that's his
[1:14:26] desire to recognize that is a long way
[1:14:30] it's something more than just reading it
[1:14:31] on a paper but it becomes a reality by
[1:14:35] Revelation so then Faith cometh by
[1:14:39] hearing hearing uh we'll skip through
[1:14:42] some of this he says that's the way it
[1:14:44] was issued in and it was condemned that
[1:14:47] head of gold was issued in by image
[1:14:49] worship and forced to it ended up in a
[1:14:50] supernatural handwriting uh a
[1:14:53] supernatural language that only
[1:14:55] Supernatural understanding could
[1:14:57] understand it let me read that again it
[1:15:00] ended up in a supernatural handwriting a
[1:15:03] supernatural language that only
[1:15:06] Supernatural understanding could
[1:15:08] understand it that's the way the Gentile
[1:15:10] Kingdom issued in and it'll go out the
[1:15:13] same way that's right by Supernatural
[1:15:15] Works Supernatural interpretation he
[1:15:18] says you know what I'm talking
[1:15:22] about watch you you'll notice this when
[1:15:24] you go back and listen to it tape this
[1:15:25] week how many times brother Braham says
[1:15:26] you know what I
[1:15:28] mean do you see it you see what I'm
[1:15:31] saying do you know what I mean now we
[1:15:32] understood the language he was speaking
[1:15:34] but did we understand the meaning right
[1:15:36] we understand the meaning of the thought
[1:15:37] he was teaching he says oh you know what
[1:15:39] I'm talking about the working of the
[1:15:41] supernatural oh how marvelous aren't you
[1:15:44] happy tonight you believe in the
[1:15:46] Supernatural oh yes you believe in the
[1:15:49] Supernatural now there's a language that
[1:15:51] comes with this Supernatural that not
[1:15:52] everybody else speaks right we can get
[1:15:54] into this uh brother man will call it in
[1:15:56] a quote the eagle language right and we
[1:15:58] could put ourselves in that chicken yard
[1:16:00] of that uh that barnyard where the
[1:16:02] chickens are all squawking around and
[1:16:04] chirping around and there's that odd
[1:16:05] duck in there that eagle that doesn't
[1:16:07] understand what everybody's squawking
[1:16:08] about because he doesn't speak that
[1:16:09] language now he can try to speak that
[1:16:11] language but it's not really in him to
[1:16:13] speak it it's not really in him to be
[1:16:16] involved with the chickens and it's not
[1:16:17] really in him it doesn't make sense to
[1:16:19] him he doesn't understand it I remember
[1:16:20] when I was just about this young man's
[1:16:22] age we went to a funeral of this sister
[1:16:24] sister that uh relation to this sister
[1:16:27] that was Catholic and the first time I
[1:16:28] ever been in a Catholic church and there
[1:16:30] we go into this Catholic church and they
[1:16:33] have this whole thing that's been
[1:16:34] programmed for like 2,000 years right
[1:16:36] since they started 1900 and something
[1:16:38] years and every funeral is done the same
[1:16:40] way well I have no idea because I've
[1:16:41] never been in a Catholic church so they
[1:16:43] know when to stand up and when to sit
[1:16:45] down and what to do and what to say and
[1:16:46] how to do this and I I'm kind of
[1:16:48] scratching my head brother Chris cuz the
[1:16:50] guy up there is not even speaking
[1:16:51] English he's speaking in Latin but yet
[1:16:53] everybody's knowing what to do I said
[1:16:54] surely not everybody in here speaks
[1:16:55] Latin am I the only one in here who
[1:16:57] doesn't speak
[1:16:59] Latin but they knew what to do because
[1:17:01] they understood the Motions of of of of
[1:17:04] where they were at right they understood
[1:17:06] this is the time for this and this is
[1:17:07] the time for this and this is this time
[1:17:09] they didn't understand what he was
[1:17:10] saying but they understood what they
[1:17:11] what they were supposed to do at that
[1:17:12] time right I just didn't fit in when do
[1:17:16] I stand up or when do I sit down I'm so
[1:17:19] confused but I thank God that I found a
[1:17:21] home where I fit in I thank God that I
[1:17:23] found somewhere that I understand and I
[1:17:25] doesn't matter if I'm on Q or on time or
[1:17:27] on key but I'm in the Supernatural
[1:17:30] language because I have heard from my
[1:17:32] theophany I have heard from another
[1:17:34] language in another land that told me
[1:17:37] this reality is going to change your
[1:17:39] body I'm waiting for it any moment any
[1:17:41] time it's a reality to me I believe just
[1:17:44] under one of these anointings one of
[1:17:46] these days we're just to step a little
[1:17:47] higher open the door we've never opened
[1:17:50] take God at a word we've never taken him
[1:17:52] at before and your mortal body shall be
[1:17:55] changed I don't believe it's a fairy
[1:17:57] tale I believe it's a reality I believe
[1:17:59] that's more sure than the ground I'm
[1:18:01] standing on tonight I believe that's
[1:18:03] more sure than this piece of wood
[1:18:05] tonight that God's word will never pass
[1:18:08] away heavens and earth will pass away
[1:18:10] but his word shall never pass
[1:18:14] away he that heareth my words that's us
[1:18:18] tonight you've heard it haven't you have
[1:18:20] you heard the shout come out across your
[1:18:22] life this is the word of God and this
[1:18:25] age saying come out of her my
[1:18:28] people we've heard it we recognize this
[1:18:31] this is not a chicken language this is
[1:18:32] an eagle
[1:18:33] language that's why we didn't get along
[1:18:35] brother Gideon out in the chicken yard
[1:18:37] is because we didn't not we didn't speak
[1:18:39] chicken we didn't understand that cluck
[1:18:42] brother B said all that clicking and
[1:18:44] clucking it didn't make sense to us why
[1:18:46] because we are from another land and in
[1:18:48] our land we don't speak chicken we're
[1:18:51] Eagles
[1:18:54] and how did we recognize that because
[1:18:56] when we heard that Mama Eagle cry there
[1:19:00] we were just thinking this was just it
[1:19:02] this was just the chicken yard there's
[1:19:03] got to be there's there's got to be
[1:19:05] something there's got to be some way out
[1:19:06] of this and then we heard the Mama's cry
[1:19:09] come across the Barnard I recognize it I
[1:19:12] hear it I understand it it's a
[1:19:14] supernatural tongue that cried over your
[1:19:17] life oh don't let the devil tell you
[1:19:19] that you just might as well give up
[1:19:20] you're already overcoming him by being
[1:19:23] here tonight you're already overcoming
[1:19:25] him by staying with the
[1:19:27] word oh don't let the devil take your
[1:19:29] ground you're still here you're still
[1:19:32] you would have given up but you're still
[1:19:33] here why are you're still here because
[1:19:36] something greater in you has brought you
[1:19:38] here above all of the chaos of the world
[1:19:41] you have every reason in the world not
[1:19:43] to be here but you're
[1:19:45] here we've seen too much if we wanted to
[1:19:48] go by man's laws I could have gave up
[1:19:50] because of that I could have gave up
[1:19:51] because of that I could have gave up
[1:19:52] because of that but you're still here
[1:19:54] tonight
[1:19:55] right because something in you is crying
[1:19:58] out something some deep in you is crying
[1:20:02] out for something greater and there's a
[1:20:04] deep responding back to you speaking the
[1:20:07] same
[1:20:08] language he understands your cry I might
[1:20:12] not understand your heart's cry but he
[1:20:14] understands it he understands that
[1:20:16] language and he speaks it back to you a
[1:20:20] supernatural language must be
[1:20:22] supernaturally taught right ye are of
[1:20:25] God little children and have overcome
[1:20:28] them because greater is he that is in
[1:20:29] you than he that is in the world they
[1:20:31] are of the world therefore speak they of
[1:20:34] the world and the world heareth them but
[1:20:38] we are of God and he that knoweth God
[1:20:43] heareth us and he that is not of God
[1:20:46] heareth not us hereby we know the spirit
[1:20:49] of truth and the spirit of error this is
[1:20:50] a powerful subject here because this is
[1:20:53] the spirit trying to divide the church
[1:20:54] church and hereby we can recognize the
[1:20:57] spirit of truth and the spirit of error
[1:20:59] by speaking the language of the
[1:21:02] word a word language no this is not just
[1:21:05] for the popes and the Bishops and the
[1:21:07] preachers it's a word language brought
[1:21:10] to the people that the people could
[1:21:12] speak the language of the
[1:21:15] word oh
[1:21:17] my when you're in a conversation with
[1:21:19] somebody you're just trying to make that
[1:21:21] conversation work right like you know
[1:21:22] you're trying to say you want this paint
[1:21:24] black and are you understand what am I
[1:21:25] saying this word right am I
[1:21:26] understanding that it's a bilingual
[1:21:28] conversation right but when you get out
[1:21:30] with a with you know when you get back
[1:21:32] in the
[1:21:36] hood and you're around all the homeboys
[1:21:39] you don't have to say much they just
[1:21:41] understand you you can laugh and they
[1:21:43] understand exactly what you're saying
[1:21:44] you can you can be back on Mama's table
[1:21:46] somewhere and and you and your brother
[1:21:47] can have a conversation that you know my
[1:21:49] mom used to say what are you guys
[1:21:50] laughing at we don't know but there's a
[1:21:51] conversation happening there because
[1:21:53] there's a relationship Beyond just what
[1:21:55] you see feel taste touch right it's a
[1:22:00] supernatural conversation taking place
[1:22:02] and that's why you feel more Kindred
[1:22:04] around certain people you feel like we
[1:22:05] we came from the same place we came from
[1:22:08] the same we came from the same section
[1:22:10] of Heaven We Came From the Same Cloth
[1:22:12] right you're you're from my
[1:22:14] hood I speak your language I understand
[1:22:18] what you're going through I understand
[1:22:20] that this world is not our home I
[1:22:23] understand that there is a des eration
[1:22:25] in a cry to get out of here there is no
[1:22:28] satisfaction in this world that will
[1:22:30] ever take away that desperation there's
[1:22:33] no drug no alcohol no sin no disparity
[1:22:36] trust me let me tell you young people
[1:22:38] you don't have to go through it it's not
[1:22:41] there the satisfaction is not there
[1:22:44] trust me when I say you don't have to go
[1:22:46] down that road you don't have to bear
[1:22:48] those scars the satisfaction is not
[1:22:50] there the only place true satisfaction
[1:22:53] exists is under the anointing of the
[1:22:55] hour when it's not you anymore but
[1:22:57] there's a supernatural being that has
[1:23:00] come down into your life that's what
[1:23:03] satisfies every old person here ought to
[1:23:05] be saying amen cuz you know that's the
[1:23:07] truth you know there's no satisfaction
[1:23:10] out there in the world why would we not
[1:23:11] fight for our young people and say there
[1:23:13] is a hope here in the word there's a
[1:23:16] place of Solace there's a place of Peace
[1:23:19] you don't have to go through those mind
[1:23:21] battles you don't going to have to go
[1:23:22] through that depression there is a place
[1:23:24] in the
[1:23:26] word where perfect peace
[1:23:30] exists you don't have to go down that
[1:23:32] road there's a satisfaction here there's
[1:23:36] a language that understands you here and
[1:23:37] you you may come to me you may come to
[1:23:39] brother Matt brother Joe and say I got
[1:23:40] these situations and this issue and
[1:23:42] maybe we don't understand you but
[1:23:44] there's somebody who does understand
[1:23:46] you I feel like it's the biggest
[1:23:48] frustration of young people today I just
[1:23:49] feel like I'm not understood I feel like
[1:23:51] nobody understands what I'm going
[1:23:52] through nobody understands the battle
[1:23:54] I'm having in my mind and then we
[1:23:56] isolate and then we draw away cuz we
[1:23:59] feel like we're not being understood and
[1:24:00] maybe as a man we failed you and maybe
[1:24:03] as a pastor we failed you but but but as
[1:24:05] a god he's never failed
[1:24:07] you as a god he's never not understood
[1:24:11] where you're at because he's been right
[1:24:12] where you're at he's walked through
[1:24:14] those
[1:24:15] shoes and he knows our heart's desire he
[1:24:18] knows the groanings that are within us
[1:24:20] and he's telling us come out of the
[1:24:21] chicken yard amen hear the eagle cry
[1:24:26] hear the eagle language he said oh but
[1:24:28] that eagle he just talked
[1:24:30] different he understood it
[1:24:34] different I thank God brother
[1:24:37] Luther because when I heard the eagle
[1:24:40] cry for 2,000 years men have debated
[1:24:45] about what this means about what this is
[1:24:48] but in my time in my day in my age
[1:24:52] someone came to teach me
[1:24:54] what this word means someone came to
[1:24:57] teach me how to speak a supernatural
[1:24:59] language and it wasn't just a a I guess
[1:25:02] is what this means but a Vindicated thus
[1:25:04] sayeth the Lord this is the mind of God
[1:25:07] this is what this means this is the
[1:25:09] absolute and if we don't have an
[1:25:11] absolute we're just absolutely guessing
[1:25:13] we've got to have an absolute in this
[1:25:15] word to know what he said and that it
[1:25:18] was for
[1:25:20] us it is for you yes it is for your
[1:25:23] situation this word has come down in
[1:25:26] your
[1:25:27] life to change your
[1:25:30] situation brother B want say this I'm
[1:25:32] skipping through some quotes but I hope
[1:25:34] you're you're you're tracking with me he
[1:25:36] says there about Jesus coming to the
[1:25:37] maniac of gadera right and there this
[1:25:39] man was tormented with spirits and there
[1:25:42] was a legion of spirits inside of him
[1:25:45] and yet when when Jesus went to speak to
[1:25:47] him those Spirits spoke through him
[1:25:49] those Spirits don't have a voice box but
[1:25:52] when Jesus came to talk to them those
[1:25:54] Spirits use that man's voice box to
[1:25:56] speak to Jesus right what do we have to
[1:25:59] do we recognize you're the Holy One Of
[1:26:01] God what do we have to do with you well
[1:26:04] those Spirits don't have a voice box
[1:26:05] Brother Brad but they used a man's voice
[1:26:09] box to speak the devil's
[1:26:12] language that's a powerful portion right
[1:26:15] here you go home and study it out where
[1:26:16] brother B talks about what the devil's
[1:26:18] language is oh I'm never going to make
[1:26:20] it oh this promise isn't for me I might
[1:26:24] as well give up there's too much I don't
[1:26:27] understand I've been hurt too bad I this
[1:26:29] sickness is too great I'm too nervous
[1:26:31] I'm too anxious I'm too depressed I'm
[1:26:33] too down in the dumps who's speaking
[1:26:35] that
[1:26:38] language it's not
[1:26:40] you why would you put a curse over your
[1:26:43] life you would never curse yourself and
[1:26:45] say I'm never going to make it but
[1:26:47] there's something else using your voice
[1:26:49] to say those
[1:26:51] words identify where it's coming from
[1:26:53] the Lord Lord didn't say that to you the
[1:26:55] Lord did not SE vindicate this message
[1:26:58] and bring it down in your age to tell
[1:26:59] you you're just not going to make it no
[1:27:02] that's the devil's language and the
[1:27:04] devil is using a voice box to to get his
[1:27:07] language out I say tonight we close the
[1:27:10] door to the devil and we say no more
[1:27:12] will I allow the devil's language to
[1:27:14] come forth out of these lips to come
[1:27:17] forth Out of This Heart come out of this
[1:27:19] mind when you have the thought you
[1:27:21] recognize it reject it it's not the
[1:27:23] Lord's thought it's not your thought
[1:27:25] it's from
[1:27:28] Hell he's looking for somebody that he
[1:27:30] can get to speak not me not
[1:27:35] today but we'll overcome him by the
[1:27:39] word the word is nigh thee even in thy
[1:27:45] mouth so I think this brother Matt if if
[1:27:49] the devil can use a man come on and the
[1:27:52] devil can use a voice box and the devil
[1:27:55] can so fill a man that that that man
[1:27:56] will just speak what the devil's word is
[1:27:59] then I believe we were designed for a
[1:28:00] purpose to be used to speak a voice on
[1:28:04] the inside of us and I believe if the
[1:28:05] devil can use a man then God can also
[1:28:07] use a man I believe if the devil can
[1:28:10] speak through a man then God can also
[1:28:12] speak through a man if we recognize
[1:28:14] where the authority of our speech is
[1:28:16] coming
[1:28:18] from a man can be so full of God till it
[1:28:21] would be God speaking through him you
[1:28:23] tell me how it can ucky Prophet would be
[1:28:25] able to speak the things that he
[1:28:28] spoke it would have to be God you tell
[1:28:32] me how a preacher up here service after
[1:28:34] service after service will tell you what
[1:28:35] you were
[1:28:37] thinking when you were by yourself when
[1:28:41] you were in your prayer closet you
[1:28:42] thought alone but you
[1:28:45] weren't when you were running from God
[1:28:47] and you thought you were alone but you
[1:28:49] weren't how could How could a man say
[1:28:52] those things to you he surrendered
[1:28:55] himself right brother Bram said the
[1:28:57] greatest gift that I have is surrender
[1:29:00] why because he knew there's something
[1:29:01] greater that wants to use my voice
[1:29:04] there's something greater that wants to
[1:29:06] use these lungs right we can turn to
[1:29:09] Joshua 1 but you know it be strong and
[1:29:11] very
[1:29:12] courageous that word do not be dismayed
[1:29:16] you know what dismayed means
[1:29:20] intimidated do not be intimidated by the
[1:29:23] Giants that are in your land because the
[1:29:25] word that I have given you is greater
[1:29:27] than the giants that are in your land do
[1:29:29] not be intimidated by whatever whatever
[1:29:31] the medical world calls it but the the
[1:29:33] word I have already given you is greater
[1:29:36] than whatever science will name it you
[1:29:38] have already overcome by the word that I
[1:29:40] have put in your mouth the word is nigh
[1:29:42] thee even in thy mouth right I believe
[1:29:45] there's some language changing taking
[1:29:47] place tonight that we're changing how
[1:29:48] we're talking because we've got to have
[1:29:50] a language change in order to speak the
[1:29:52] supernatural
[1:29:54] the word itself
[1:29:57] Supernatural through these eyes we
[1:29:59] understand the natural how could this be
[1:30:01] how could that how could that bone heal
[1:30:02] how could that bone set how could how
[1:30:04] could that heart be broken now you know
[1:30:05] there's probably some doctors or you
[1:30:07] know we we related to some or know some
[1:30:09] but is there any medical in here yes
[1:30:12] yeah yeah that's right you've never
[1:30:14] healed a bone in your life You' set one
[1:30:17] but the healing takes place inside right
[1:30:20] something had to be already programmed
[1:30:21] to heal that bone and we think well
[1:30:23] that's just that's just science but you
[1:30:26] tell me what
[1:30:27] doctor could come in and rewire a broken
[1:30:32] heart see there's more than just these
[1:30:34] physical attributes taking place but
[1:30:36] there's this Supernatural
[1:30:39] work nobody can go in and rewire a
[1:30:42] broken heart L it come from the one who
[1:30:44] made the heart see we're not just
[1:30:47] dealing with the muscle of the heart
[1:30:49] we're dealing with the thoughts and
[1:30:50] intents of the heart and no doctor can
[1:30:53] touch that
[1:30:54] but God alone has access to that
[1:30:57] Dimension and only he can come in and
[1:30:59] heal a broken
[1:31:01] heart I could preach till I'm out of
[1:31:03] spit and not fix a broken heart but just
[1:31:07] one moment with the King just one moment
[1:31:10] with the one who designed your heart and
[1:31:12] all of that ache and all of that pain
[1:31:14] and all of the wha ifs and the wise and
[1:31:16] the scars and just a can I get a witness
[1:31:19] tonight in just a moment just one
[1:31:21] interview with him can change it
[1:31:24] everything in your life can change all
[1:31:25] of the hurt all of the questions all of
[1:31:28] the heartache just one moment in his
[1:31:30] presence can take all of the questions
[1:31:32] away I know what I'm talking about
[1:31:34] because I've met that one I've had that
[1:31:36] interview where I could not explain my
[1:31:38] way out of a situation but meeting him
[1:31:41] changed everything about it I walked out
[1:31:43] a new man a fresh man why because I had
[1:31:45] an interview with the one who designed
[1:31:49] my
[1:31:50] heart as a man thinketh in his heart so
[1:31:54] is he so it's more than just this but
[1:31:58] there's another thinking capacity
[1:32:00] there's another understanding right he
[1:32:02] says when you're certain of anything
[1:32:04] there's one sound that you can be
[1:32:05] certain of and that is God's voice God's
[1:32:09] word is
[1:32:11] certain looking for a surrendered vessel
[1:32:13] to speak his
[1:32:14] language if somebody would just come and
[1:32:17] teach us how to speak this
[1:32:21] language if I could go to a class
[1:32:26] if there was an
[1:32:27] app there was something that I could
[1:32:29] just learn this language
[1:32:31] from what is the language of Hebrews
[1:32:36] 4:12 you ever thought about it how would
[1:32:38] brother brandom go to Sweden or Puerto
[1:32:42] Rico he can't even speak English and yet
[1:32:45] he
[1:32:47] hears in his language the thoughts and
[1:32:50] intents of their hearts so what what is
[1:32:54] the language of the heart what is the
[1:32:56] language of the word is it English
[1:32:58] English is not is not even close to
[1:33:01] being Superior enough to be the language
[1:33:02] of the word I thank God because I don't
[1:33:04] know that I could have mastered another
[1:33:05] language but I'm glad that the word came
[1:33:07] in proper English his hatte OES and
[1:33:10] don'ts and Carries because I understand
[1:33:13] that but it's not just confined to
[1:33:16] English it can't be how would he go
[1:33:18] overseas and all of these things come to
[1:33:21] pass but it would have to be a
[1:33:22] supernatural
[1:33:24] understanding a language of discernment
[1:33:27] right we could just stop here for a
[1:33:29] second and just talk about this the
[1:33:30] first two polls right first poll second
[1:33:35] poll but the third poll now in the
[1:33:37] second poll he turned and started
[1:33:40] Discerning the the thoughts and intents
[1:33:42] of the heart right there would be
[1:33:43] somebody come up and say you feel that
[1:33:44] presence there you feel that there oh
[1:33:46] this is where you're at you're here for
[1:33:49] your mother she's in Illinois who's
[1:33:52] telling them that what language is it
[1:33:54] coming down in you see with that gift of
[1:33:56] discernment was working there that God
[1:33:57] put there before the foundation of the
[1:33:59] world but then in another phase that
[1:34:02] discernment gift changed and it started
[1:34:04] Discerning another heart it started
[1:34:06] Discerning the Heart of Jesus Christ and
[1:34:08] telling us what Jesus Christ was
[1:34:10] thinking about
[1:34:12] you telling us what that what Jesus's
[1:34:15] heart really thinks about you and in
[1:34:17] that third pole face he was telling the
[1:34:19] church this is what God's saying about
[1:34:21] you this is what God feels for for you
[1:34:24] this is what God is going to do for you
[1:34:26] this is what God has promised to you
[1:34:28] what language was that coming in it was
[1:34:30] the language of a supernatural word
[1:34:32] coming down the changing of
[1:34:34] dispensations we're in the third
[1:34:36] dispensation where God's thoughts have
[1:34:38] been revealed I know the thoughts that I
[1:34:40] think towards you they are thoughts of
[1:34:42] good and not of evil to give you an
[1:34:45] expected and why because he already
[1:34:47] knows what's at the end and he knows
[1:34:49] what he's thought about you we're not
[1:34:51] guessing at this but a Vindicated word
[1:34:54] Prophet has come in our age to tell us
[1:34:56] what God Almighty thinks about us
[1:35:00] hallelujah we're not wondering we
[1:35:06] know we know it it's a Vindicated truth
[1:35:10] because it is not given unto you unto
[1:35:13] them to know the mysteries of the
[1:35:15] kingdom of the heavens but to them it is
[1:35:16] not given but to you it's
[1:35:20] given but Tony it makes me want to shout
[1:35:26] why because in this life I'm nobody
[1:35:29] nobody would have thought me worth a
[1:35:30] dime nobody would have bet on me nobody
[1:35:32] would have put their money on me but God
[1:35:34] Almighty saw me where I am tonight and
[1:35:37] he put his reputation on me he put his
[1:35:40] name on me and he said they will
[1:35:42] overcome by the word of the
[1:35:47] Lamb what is it it's the language of the
[1:35:50] Lamb you've got to understand the
[1:35:52] language
[1:35:55] amen amen you've got to understand God's
[1:35:58] language is hidden in plain sight
[1:35:59] brother says you said you recall the
[1:36:01] beginning of the message of this book
[1:36:02] studying the actual revelation of Jesus
[1:36:05] himself in the church and his work in
[1:36:07] future ages and then I mentioned this is
[1:36:09] out Exposition then I mentioned that it
[1:36:10] takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[1:36:13] Revelation or we will fail to get it
[1:36:17] bringing these two thoughts together you
[1:36:18] will see that it won't take just an
[1:36:20] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[1:36:22] book real
[1:36:24] it is going to take the operation of the
[1:36:27] Holy Ghost that means this book cannot
[1:36:29] be revealed to anyone but a special
[1:36:32] class of
[1:36:35] people where you at church a special
[1:36:38] class of
[1:36:39] people it seems exclusive but it's
[1:36:42] election exclusive he's elected it this
[1:36:44] way a special class of people it will
[1:36:48] take one with prophetic Insight it will
[1:36:50] require the ability to hear from God
[1:36:53] it will require Supernatural instruction
[1:36:56] not just a student comparing verse with
[1:36:58] verse though that is good but a mystery
[1:37:00] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[1:37:02] it never becomes clear how we need to
[1:37:05] hear from God and lay ourselves open and
[1:37:07] become yielded to the spirit to hear and
[1:37:11] to
[1:37:12] know the Mysteries have been revealed
[1:37:16] the book is
[1:37:17] open the seals are
[1:37:20] broken it's been revealed we're not
[1:37:23] waiting on anything
[1:37:28] else what would it be if I spoke uh
[1:37:30] let's pick some crazy language that
[1:37:31] hopefully nobody in here speaks what if
[1:37:33] what if I what if I spoke uh
[1:37:38] Zulu it would do no good for me to
[1:37:40] preach this sermon in Zulu to you today
[1:37:43] because you don't understand
[1:37:45] it right it would do no good for me to
[1:37:48] greet you outside in Zulu why because
[1:37:50] you'll never greet me back the point to
[1:37:52] a conversation is two people speaking
[1:37:55] the same language that's why we love
[1:37:57] Fellowship so much it's two people
[1:37:59] speaking the same language it would do
[1:38:02] no good for me to instruct you how to
[1:38:03] speak a language that nobody else
[1:38:05] understands just ask a rocket scientist
[1:38:07] he'll tell you it's not fun nobody
[1:38:09] understands what you're saying why
[1:38:10] because they don't understand that
[1:38:11] language but God came down in a common
[1:38:13] people language that is commonly
[1:38:16] understood but he's not just wanting to
[1:38:18] speak it he's wanting a
[1:38:22] conversation brother he's wanting us to
[1:38:24] speak back to him he's wanting us and
[1:38:27] how could we yet speak back this
[1:38:28] heavenly language less we understand it
[1:38:31] l we understand what he's preaching to
[1:38:33] the church this is the age I believe
[1:38:36] when this this pure word is being
[1:38:37] restored if if the brothers would turn
[1:38:39] me to
[1:38:44] Zephaniah the third chapter ninth verse
[1:38:47] for then will I turn to the people a
[1:38:50] pure language that they may all call
[1:38:53] upon the name of the Lord to serve him
[1:38:56] with one consent for then will I turn to
[1:38:59] the people a pure language somebody say
[1:39:02] all that they may
[1:39:05] all call upon the name of the Lord amen
[1:39:08] to serve him with one consent so when is
[1:39:12] this going to come down into into
[1:39:14] practical application when is this when
[1:39:16] is this prophecy going to be fulfilled
[1:39:17] in in our midst I believe it's happened
[1:39:20] already in this age I believe we're
[1:39:22] waiting for it to happen I believe this
[1:39:24] prophecy has become fulfillment in this
[1:39:26] age that we're living in that God has
[1:39:28] restored a pure language to the church
[1:39:31] not a language of confusion but a
[1:39:33] restored language not a new language a
[1:39:35] restored language not a reformed
[1:39:37] language but a restored language a
[1:39:40] language of Purity that only God himself
[1:39:43] would speak and would understand it's
[1:39:45] not written it's not it's not it's not
[1:39:48] something we can go learn at a class but
[1:39:50] it's by Revelation and Revelation only
[1:39:52] for two Thousand Years men have
[1:39:54] dissected this spent their lifetimes on
[1:39:56] one chapter and you think that we're
[1:39:58] going to figure it out just in a few
[1:39:59] years of study
[1:40:02] no but there came an instructor in our
[1:40:05] age you know there's a lot of languages
[1:40:08] that have gone extinct right that nobody
[1:40:10] speaks today anymore there's probably
[1:40:12] maybe some Native American language
[1:40:14] right here in this area that almost
[1:40:15] nobody speaks anymore because it's just
[1:40:16] going extinct
[1:40:18] right but you know there's one language
[1:40:21] that has gone extinct natur natural
[1:40:23] language that has gone extinct and been
[1:40:25] brought back to life and that's the
[1:40:27] Hebrew language the Hebrew language
[1:40:30] nobody was allowed to speak for years
[1:40:32] hundreds of years nobody was allowed to
[1:40:34] speak the the Hebrew language the only
[1:40:37] place you could find the Hebrew language
[1:40:38] was in religious text the only place you
[1:40:40] could find it was on Old Scrolls and
[1:40:42] only a few people could read it and
[1:40:43] nobody was allowed to speak it so what
[1:40:45] happened brother Luther it became a dead
[1:40:47] language it actually was verified
[1:40:51] extinct that there nobody that speaks
[1:40:54] Hebrew anymore so it's an extinct
[1:40:56] language exactly what the Catholic
[1:40:58] Church desired was for nobody to really
[1:41:00] read the Scrolls they wanted to go to
[1:41:01] the Latin book I'm sorry for stepping on
[1:41:04] some toes here but that's where it
[1:41:05] originated if you go back and do the
[1:41:07] history of it and they caused the Hebrew
[1:41:09] language to be extinct because Satan
[1:41:11] hates God's people Satan hates those
[1:41:16] people and so he caused their language
[1:41:19] to go extinct but do we hear Hebrew
[1:41:20] today yes because something took place
[1:41:23] that brought that language back to a
[1:41:25] speaking language and in the late 1800
[1:41:28] there was a man by the name of elaser
[1:41:30] Ben Yehuda and he had an inspiration
[1:41:33] that he would restore the Hebrew
[1:41:34] language back to a practical language
[1:41:37] and everybody thought he was crazy
[1:41:38] brother Matt nobody thought he could do
[1:41:40] it but he had an inspiration from God
[1:41:42] this is God's people this is God's in in
[1:41:46] their world this is God's
[1:41:48] language we're going to restore it back
[1:41:51] and so we got some funding behind behind
[1:41:53] him and some other people to believe in
[1:41:54] it and and and at the turn of the
[1:41:56] century he began to get some backing
[1:41:58] into it and and and and knew that well
[1:42:01] the goal is not just for me to speak it
[1:42:04] but we've got to have a civilization
[1:42:06] that speaks
[1:42:07] it amen we've got to have a community
[1:42:10] that speaks it doesn't do just good for
[1:42:13] me to speak it but you know what I find
[1:42:15] interesting brother Matt you probably
[1:42:16] encountered this that when you go
[1:42:18] overseas that that what makes the best
[1:42:20] interpreter is one who can switch his
[1:42:21] thoughts he can think in English or he
[1:42:23] can think in Spanish and he can actually
[1:42:25] change his thoughts but you see there's
[1:42:27] a native thought that you think in maybe
[1:42:29] some of you have learned German and
[1:42:30] you've learned you've learned Spanish
[1:42:32] and you've learned different language
[1:42:33] but there's a native thought that you
[1:42:34] thinking and this man elzer knew that it
[1:42:37] we have to get a people that think in
[1:42:40] the Hebrew language and so he spent his
[1:42:43] life scrolling over these Scrolls and
[1:42:44] bringing this back and and and by
[1:42:46] inspiration taking this word means this
[1:42:48] and this word means this and bringing it
[1:42:49] into the modern Century right of all
[1:42:51] these things that weren't there when
[1:42:52] these scroll written and translating and
[1:42:54] just pouring his life out over going to
[1:42:56] school to be a linguist you know what
[1:42:58] happened he he had he had the vision
[1:43:01] we've got to have a civilization and
[1:43:03] April 11th
[1:43:06] 1909 he was funded to start T
[1:43:11] Aviv and they marched out from Jaffa I
[1:43:15] think it was a civilization of people
[1:43:18] set up some tents and that's where Tel
[1:43:20] Aviv in modern day Society began because
[1:43:22] a man man had a vision that there would
[1:43:24] be a community of people I need
[1:43:26] mechanics that speak it I I need I need
[1:43:28] shop owners that speak it I I need I
[1:43:30] need moms that speak it I need
[1:43:32] everybody's thoughts to change to this
[1:43:34] language and in this city we will only
[1:43:36] speak this language all right all right
[1:43:39] April 11th 1909 I thought that was
[1:43:41] pretty powerful Gideon how long does it
[1:43:43] take for an anointing to go across the
[1:43:44] world just a few days April 11th 1909
[1:43:48] Tel Aviv began I believe that we are the
[1:43:51] first and the natural comes later right
[1:43:53] the spiritual happens first and the
[1:43:55] natural comes later the word Tel Aviv is
[1:43:57] found in the scripture right it's the
[1:43:59] White
[1:44:00] City it means the new old
[1:44:03] land a Hill spring Tel aiv and the
[1:44:06] scripture is found in Ezekiel the thir
[1:44:08] chapter where he eats the
[1:44:11] book it was the city the port city where
[1:44:14] Solomon imported all of the materials to
[1:44:17] build the temple The Cedars of Lebanon
[1:44:19] came in through Tel Aviv in the
[1:44:20] scripture all of those the the the
[1:44:23] stones that the builders rejected and
[1:44:24] all of those materials came through that
[1:44:27] Port City of Tel Aviv right if you go
[1:44:29] back and in the scripture and that's
[1:44:30] where the first second temple were built
[1:44:32] was through the port city of Tel Aviv we
[1:44:35] find that in Ezekiel 3 then the spirit
[1:44:36] took me up and I heard behind me a voice
[1:44:38] of a great rushing saying blessed be the
[1:44:41] glory of the Lord from his place this is
[1:44:43] coming from Tel Aviv so Tel Aviv begins
[1:44:47] to thrive and begins to it P continue to
[1:44:50] grow and and there's communities moving
[1:44:52] in and families moving again now they're
[1:44:53] seeing a generation come in and they're
[1:44:55] teaching that generation how to speak
[1:44:57] Hebrew
[1:44:58] language and in 1921 it became an
[1:45:01] official
[1:45:03] Township you write these numbers down
[1:45:05] and go back and read them in 1921 it
[1:45:08] became an official
[1:45:10] Township and in
[1:45:13] 1933 Tel Aviv became an officially
[1:45:16] recognized city in the world in
[1:45:20] 1933 as I was with John the Baptist so
[1:45:23] shall I be with
[1:45:25] you what happened in 1933 to us a
[1:45:29] restoration came our way something came
[1:45:32] from another world and came down to
[1:45:34] where we were and it wasn't an extinct
[1:45:36] language anymore but it taught us how to
[1:45:39] speak a Heavenly language my message
[1:45:42] will forerun the coming
[1:45:44] Christ there's too much here I'm not
[1:45:47] making this up it's Vindicated by
[1:45:49] somebody way greater than my intellect
[1:45:51] this message has been and thoroughly
[1:45:53] Vindicated to come down and teach us
[1:45:56] God's
[1:45:58] language how could you speak a language
[1:46:00] of Faith let you know lest you know what
[1:46:02] God's word says about it how could you
[1:46:04] say how could you speak to a mountain
[1:46:06] lest you speak
[1:46:09] Mountain but somebody would have to come
[1:46:11] and show you the way this is how it's
[1:46:15] done I will forun this by telling you
[1:46:18] how to speak it and generations will
[1:46:20] come after me and their thoughts
[1:46:23] their thoughts will begin to speak this
[1:46:26] language hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:46:30] we've arrived we're here I don't speak
[1:46:33] denominational clock I understand this
[1:46:37] language I speak the language of truth I
[1:46:40] speak the language of understanding it's
[1:46:43] a
[1:46:44] supernatural understanding that has come
[1:46:46] across my
[1:46:50] life Hallelujah
[1:46:53] why would I worry when Giants come
[1:46:55] calling my name I don't speak their
[1:46:59] language you Lord I've been given
[1:47:02] another language an interpreter has come
[1:47:05] and told me how to understand this
[1:47:08] language oh friends we could take the
[1:47:11] time to go through this you know the
[1:47:12] Redemptive names nobody nobody connected
[1:47:14] that with
[1:47:16] healing what a teacher had to come the
[1:47:19] spirit of Truth had to come why do you
[1:47:21] not believe me I truth but you see there
[1:47:24] was no place in them to receive it but
[1:47:27] in you thank God but in you there's a
[1:47:32] receptor built in you that when this
[1:47:34] flashed across your
[1:47:36] life let me say brother Joe in this age
[1:47:39] it was more than just that camera lens
[1:47:41] that was flashed across but that Pillar
[1:47:43] of Fire also flashed across my life and
[1:47:47] I have heard from a supernatural
[1:47:49] voice he did not just come to teach me
[1:47:52] how to argue and quote War back and
[1:47:53] forth it taught me how God
[1:47:58] speaks to understand God is his own
[1:48:02] interpreter so then who came in this
[1:48:07] age it would have to be the one who
[1:48:09] wrote the language to teach you how to
[1:48:11] how to speak that language for 2,000
[1:48:14] years men have guessed at this but we
[1:48:16] are speaking the language of the word
[1:48:19] tonight I've
[1:48:20] heard I heard a voice
[1:48:24] what voice the language of the
[1:48:27] word has come down into this age to
[1:48:29] teach us the authority of where we're at
[1:48:32] can I say this we're in adoption
[1:48:34] language what language was Joshua
[1:48:37] speaking when he told the son to stand
[1:48:38] still it was way more powerful whenever
[1:48:41] natural language he was speaking but
[1:48:42] there was a language of faith and
[1:48:44] recognition and of adoption Authority
[1:48:46] we've gone beyond just just those three
[1:48:48] gates but we're walking in adoption land
[1:48:52] and we have been commissioned to speak
[1:48:55] don't cry speak don't Smite it speak
[1:48:59] speak
[1:49:02] speak I'm a man under Authority when I
[1:49:05] say go they go when I say move they move
[1:49:07] I recognize you're a man under Authority
[1:49:09] if you would just speak the word it
[1:49:11] shall be
[1:49:15] done who is it that's talking to you
[1:49:17] it's not some
[1:49:19] man but God has come down into your situ
[1:49:22] ation instead if you could just speak
[1:49:25] the
[1:49:27] word amen you're man under
[1:49:30] Authority I'm a man under Authority if
[1:49:34] you just speak to this situation it
[1:49:35] shall be done the very same hour the man
[1:49:38] servant was made whole right a language
[1:49:41] of Revelation a language that we're not
[1:49:45] now let me make something clear we're
[1:49:46] not all to speak with tongues right
[1:49:49] Bible makes that very clear we're not
[1:49:50] all to dream dreams we're not all to
[1:49:52] prophesy those things are for the
[1:49:53] edifying of the church and they're given
[1:49:55] to those that God can God can use right
[1:49:57] and every man has given a portion
[1:49:59] according to his faith correct okay
[1:50:01] doesn't make me less because I don't
[1:50:02] speak in tongues can I just share a
[1:50:04] personal testimony we we okay you know
[1:50:06] what I I kind of thought this for a long
[1:50:08] time I thought well if I really spoke in
[1:50:09] tongues and you know I I'd probably feel
[1:50:11] like I have the Holy Ghost well then it
[1:50:12] happened and you know what I still had
[1:50:13] the same complex that I didn't have the
[1:50:15] Holy Ghost that I had before it
[1:50:17] happened is that okay that's good
[1:50:20] brother then I thought well if I was an
[1:50:22] interp I'd have it you know what Brother
[1:50:24] Brad I had a I had a I had an instance
[1:50:26] where I spoke in tongues and interpreted
[1:50:27] exactly what was going on in somebody's
[1:50:29] life without ever knowing them or
[1:50:30] knowing their name and I still had the
[1:50:33] same complex of not having the Holy
[1:50:35] Ghost so it's not measured by those
[1:50:37] things it's measured by the word now I
[1:50:41] believe in speaking in tongues I believe
[1:50:42] in dancing in the spirit I believe in I
[1:50:44] don't don't take away what I'm trying
[1:50:45] trying to preach here I believe in the
[1:50:47] moving of God I say let God move I say
[1:50:50] let the spirit flow through the pews I
[1:50:52] say stay from the back to the front let
[1:50:54] God
[1:50:55] move don't bind him down with your
[1:50:57] theology or Creeds or what abouts you
[1:50:59] know what I think if we would just let
[1:51:01] go of ourselves enough I believe there's
[1:51:03] more gifts and potentials laying in the
[1:51:05] church than we recognize I believe the
[1:51:07] gifts that you're wondering about
[1:51:09] they're already in you but you've got to
[1:51:11] let yourself go long enough to let God
[1:51:13] move in that gift you think it's easy to
[1:51:16] get up here and preach no you've got to
[1:51:17] let yourself go so God can move well
[1:51:21] same for you in your worship you've got
[1:51:23] to let yourself go and let God
[1:51:26] move we
[1:51:28] okay but the devil too long has bound
[1:51:31] down the church to say you've got to
[1:51:32] look like
[1:51:35] this no Paul makes it very clear we
[1:51:38] don't all do those things this is not
[1:51:40] the language of what I'm talking about
[1:51:41] but what we will do is say Amen to the
[1:51:46] word right what's the evidence of the
[1:51:48] Holy Ghost well there's a lot of answers
[1:51:50] I could give you but one of them is say
[1:51:52] say Amen to the
[1:51:55] word I don't mean you have to be as
[1:51:57] vocal as me but your heart has to
[1:52:00] respond to the word and say that's
[1:52:03] nothing but the truth that's nothing but
[1:52:06] the truth you tell me brother Chris what
[1:52:08] language was it that hadti W could speak
[1:52:10] in that little
[1:52:13] cabin way more powerful than English
[1:52:15] language but something more more more
[1:52:18] authoritative than just English came
[1:52:20] down into that room let's just start
[1:52:22] here what language do squirrel
[1:52:27] speak something greater than just
[1:52:30] English but an authority a word of
[1:52:33] authority a a word of restoration a word
[1:52:37] of
[1:52:38] Resurrection a word of creation we'll go
[1:52:42] there it's in the word that's the
[1:52:46] language that we're being taught here
[1:52:47] not just how to out out teach a Baptist
[1:52:50] what good is that going to do anybody
[1:52:52] but the language of a lifechanging word
[1:52:54] is laying right here in this book if
[1:52:57] only we could look at the pages and
[1:52:59] understand it but yet he came in this
[1:53:01] age and showed us the way to speak this
[1:53:05] word now I've used my lips to speak a
[1:53:08] lot of things in this life a lot of
[1:53:10] things that I should be held accountable
[1:53:12] for but thank God for grace and thank
[1:53:15] God he taught me how to speak another
[1:53:17] language that changed my perception of
[1:53:19] who I am who you are who you are who
[1:53:23] everybody is why because I'm now seeing
[1:53:25] it through the lens of the
[1:53:27] word a Heavenly
[1:53:30] language the old things
[1:53:35] passed you're a new
[1:53:40] creation can I say you're New Creation
[1:53:43] tonight that means whatever you did
[1:53:45] yesterday doesn't
[1:53:48] count when did your mercies renew
[1:53:52] this morning you're a new creation your
[1:53:56] Mercy's renewed so what you thought
[1:53:58] about this before is not being held
[1:54:00] accountable to
[1:54:02] you I can prove it I can prove it to you
[1:54:04] because in that little room had he right
[1:54:07] used a language that was more powerful
[1:54:09] than her broken English but she said I
[1:54:12] claimed the lives of my two boys and
[1:54:13] brother brandom said that they were
[1:54:15] there in the corner making
[1:54:19] fun making fun of what was going on in
[1:54:21] the C and yet in that moment when the
[1:54:24] holy spirit moves there ain't no power
[1:54:27] strong enough to stop it when God moves
[1:54:29] on the scene I don't care where they are
[1:54:32] what they're doing how high they are
[1:54:34] when God moves there is no power great
[1:54:37] enough but he will have his seed he will
[1:54:40] redeem his bride he will redeem them
[1:54:43] back oh but they blasphemed they were
[1:54:45] laughing in the face of the prophet
[1:54:52] a greater language than your natural
[1:54:54] understanding but a supernatural
[1:54:56] language well I bless God I know the way
[1:54:58] that predestination works well
[1:55:00] apparently we
[1:55:03] don't well it's got to be will and it's
[1:55:05] got to be this is a supernatural
[1:55:07] language and God is not bound by what we
[1:55:10] understand or what we think or what's
[1:55:11] got to fit in our jigsaw puzzle but God
[1:55:13] is God and he will do the miraculous
[1:55:16] amongst us because we have been taught
[1:55:19] to speak
[1:55:21] miracles
[1:55:23] amen I was at a little church four or
[1:55:26] five years ago and the pastor came up
[1:55:28] there was a there was a prayer line
[1:55:30] going up and the pastor came up he said
[1:55:31] I want to pray for my children I have
[1:55:33] eight of them and and they're and and
[1:55:35] four of them are serving the lord and
[1:55:36] four of them are out in the world and I
[1:55:37] want to call them by name he said I want
[1:55:40] to start with my oldest one he said I
[1:55:42] want to call his name before the Lord we
[1:55:44] prayed before the Lord he said I don't
[1:55:46] know where he's at this was in a little
[1:55:48] village in Alaska the only way to get
[1:55:51] there is a little jump
[1:55:53] plane if it's snowing you can get there
[1:55:55] by a you know if it's snowing you can
[1:55:58] get there by a jet ski but you're not
[1:55:59] just going to roll up to this Village he
[1:56:02] said I don't know where he's at I don't
[1:56:03] know where he's at right now this
[1:56:05] Village is only about 800
[1:56:07] people he said but I am commissioning
[1:56:09] the Lord and he spoke words that were
[1:56:13] greater than any man's words they
[1:56:16] weren't worked up they weren't puffed up
[1:56:17] he just said I commissioned the Lord
[1:56:19] after my son and I went we we we
[1:56:22] rejoiced with him we praised with him
[1:56:24] and as a man we know there's no way we
[1:56:26] could do that and there were there some
[1:56:27] more people came for prayer and more
[1:56:28] people were coming and brother Matt I
[1:56:30] just I just uh we leaning back and we
[1:56:32] were just worshiping the Lord you know
[1:56:33] how it is in that anointing and just
[1:56:35] praising the Lord and all of a sudden
[1:56:36] this sister who was the pastor's wife
[1:56:38] began to cut loose and she was doing
[1:56:39] somersaults around the room screaming
[1:56:41] and I saided go bless God she got a
[1:56:43] blessing but then I noticed that cut
[1:56:45] through the back door there was a young
[1:56:47] man that came in and he stumbled in he
[1:56:50] was drunk he was red-faced he didn't
[1:56:52] know where he was and he leaned his head
[1:56:53] against the wall and he began to sing
[1:56:55] heavenly father I appreciate you wow and
[1:57:00] I just thought it was some town drunk
[1:57:02] but then I recognized that was his
[1:57:04] mother that was his father's prayer
[1:57:07] brother Matt not 20 minutes after we had
[1:57:09] prayed for that young man he came in the
[1:57:11] back
[1:57:14] door don't tell me God doesn't know
[1:57:16] where they're at and he doesn't know
[1:57:17] their name he doesn't know just where to
[1:57:18] find them and how to get them back into
[1:57:21] the fold yes
[1:57:22] I went back to that church just last
[1:57:24] year that man is still serving the lord
[1:57:27] Faithfully attending the church four or
[1:57:29] five years later don't tell me God can't
[1:57:31] do it because I've seen him do
[1:57:34] it you know the testimony of Justin wear
[1:57:37] brother Wayne was preaching there at
[1:57:39] that at at that church brother Tims
[1:57:41] church and there that young man came
[1:57:43] that sister came through right said I
[1:57:46] want to call my brother it's time for
[1:57:47] him to come
[1:57:49] home and through their United fa brother
[1:57:52] Tim and brother Wayne and the brothers
[1:57:53] began to pray and that little girl's
[1:57:55] Faith reached into another realm greater
[1:57:57] than the English
[1:57:59] language and that man woke up in his bed
[1:58:01] somewhere was terrified he missed the
[1:58:04] Rapture scrambled to church ran over
[1:58:06] stop signs his truck never moved again
[1:58:08] after that night but he made in the
[1:58:10] house of God in his pajamas and
[1:58:12] surrendered his heart to the Lord and
[1:58:14] now he's a standing man in the church at
[1:58:16] evening light Tabernacle is he not can

[1:58:49] can I was in Mexico last July and we had
[1:58:52] a service and at the end of that service
[1:58:54] some people came up for prayer and this
[1:58:56] mom came up for her son I didn't
[1:58:59] understand what she was speaking but we
[1:59:00] spoke the same language Hallelujah we
[1:59:03] ENT into prayer for her and she said I
[1:59:06] claim it in the name of Jesus and walked
[1:59:08] back to her
[1:59:09] seat we we started man the Holy Ghost
[1:59:12] poured out they turned into like brother
[1:59:14] Bram said a dancing party there's people
[1:59:16] dancing all over in the spirit and just
[1:59:17] rejoicing these people don't have money
[1:59:19] they don't have they don't have the
[1:59:20] things that we have but doesn't stop
[1:59:22] them from praising the Lord you know

[1:59:42] hugging this man and the pastor came
[1:59:44] over to me just tears in his eyes he
[1:59:46] said that's the
[1:59:47] boy 12 years he's been out of church 12

[1:59:59] city where we were having church at this
[2:00:00] school and made his way in there also
[2:00:03] drunk also staggering around and
