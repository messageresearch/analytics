amen the lord is our refuge isn't he amen the bible calls him a covert from storm it's a stormy age a stormy world and so we sure appreciate the lord taking care of us amen god bless you all today amen and we want to just take a few moments hold up a second uh we want to i want to show you a couple pictures from yesterday and give you a little bit of a report um uh are you ready gideon um let me just let me just say this first so i was able to go over to cherokee on friday and do a little bit of recon and uh what that's it's gonna be amazing how it turned out and uh the lord taught me so much in that because i i was able to sharpen my vision on i knew what i wanted to do but how to go about it that was what i was really waiting my vision was clear and it's undaunted and remains crystal clear that i i really have a vision to work deeply into the cherokee tribal nation to let them know what god has done in this day amen raised up a prophet right from among their own people and they meant brother branham's grandmother a full-blooded cherokee right off the reservation and uh that's a lot brother branham said that that's what gave him that love of the wilderness was his native heritage and so you know they're they're unaware of that and there has never been that i'm aware of and i think i would be aware of it my mom would certainly be aware of it my dad but there has not been a real um that kind of an approach to that particular native american nation and so we were able to go there sister debbie and i and i did a little bit of recon we met brother jack i call him brother jack and he's uh he's actually teaches at a baptist sunday school amen so amen brother donald we got to hook another baptist amen praise the lord god to get his eyes to come open to see that what he has is awesome but there's more amen so you know if you've got a seven course meal don't sit one thing in front of me i want the whole seven course meal i'm appreciative of what's in front of me amen but i want i want all that god has and there's something about it you know when you when when you first began to respond to that eagle scream you just you there was a longing as brother kenny was singing there you know there's there's a deep cry something there's got to be more there's got to be more and i've heard that testimony from so many people who came from um you know their life as a christian in in denominational systems they were already loved the lord already believed god had already accepted christ but they just knew somewhere somehow there's got to be more than this and as soon as they heard that eagle scream wow a deep calling to a deep so we're trusting in that i realize that that i can't go as fast as i would like to go i mean i'm i just wanted to go in and just go i just want to go knock on the gates at the reservation and say i want to see the chief and i want to see the council i just wanted to go in and drop a bomb it's not going to work like that and so talking to them and meeting with with jack who's full-blooded there's only about 600 remaining on that on those tribal lands um where that are pure pure blood um and the rest have have intermarried and different things like that there's only a little more than 600 maybe according to to jack that's how many are there that's remaining and i just began to witness to him man i liked him a whole lot him and his wife and they seemed to take a shine to sister debbie and i and we started talking very easy and and i just began to kind of give him a little bit of my vision uh you know and just told him i said you know the the the cherokee nation you know those are real americans and and they're they're even unaware that god you know rose a prophet among their people bit of you know the the divine power and the miracles and the things that took place and the era that he lived in and the testimonies of all the uh famous you know uh religious leaders of his day and the things they testified about him and said you know and even to this day some of those great some of the greatest um some of the some of the leading uh religious leaders that we have today declare openly that william branham had by far the greatest supernatural gift and was a humble godly christian man and uh and uh and and that that's what the people who testify who knew it and know it authoritatively say about it and i said and he said well and and just uh telling a few little things from his ministry and even in my own ministry from overseas and different things like that and the miracles we've seen it really you could tell my wife and i we could we both left there feeling so informed on how we're going to approach this and it turns out that actually uh brother george i don't think i've said this to you yet turns out you had the exact model that's going to work perfectly and brother george you know has uh rented a pavilion you're going to see it here in a minute it's in the cherokee park you're going to see streams of water and rivers that i played in as a kid sister debbie i said honey as soon as you see it you're going to remember and she said my goodness how many times my daddy had us up here and she said i played right out there and and she remembered it immediately and when i was there on friday you're going to see some a few shots of pictures and videos there it was early on a saturday morning no one was really there there's one or two people walking around but when i was there on friday families were there you know with picnics and the kids were the rivers on both sides at least one side his stream is weightable there were kids out there waiting all up and down at people fishing on both sides and so what we're going to do is i realize that talking to jack and gail that you know i'm not going to be able to just go to the to the main thing i can't even i'm gonna have to build some relationships i gotta build some rapport we gotta we gotta meet some people we got a social network as it were we gotta shake some hands and so we're gonna we're our plan is to go there uh on i think it's saturday the 18th i believe and we're going to have music and we're going to bring in some food and we're just going to see what the lord will do with that if it's nothing more than just meeting and greeting and getting people to understand and begin to build a little bit of rapport jack told me that he absolutely you know will get me into uh on to the on to the reservation and and he thinks it's perfectly doable that i could probably go right into the council meeting of the elders and pour my heart out to them uh so we're gonna we're gonna start small and we're gonna take a few steps because there's it's unquestionably i have a burden to do it amen brother eddie had a burden sister gene has a burden um and uh i i want to do it i i it's never been done the way that i envision it and that's what we want to do brother stephen and sister emily are actually flying in there to bring instruments and we're going to play music and some of our musicians from here going and uh so if you want to go and bring your kids they can play in the river you can bring some fishing poles you might need a fishing license i don't know you might be to go to walmart when you get to north carolina and buy you a one-day fishing license but people were were fishing both sides the one on this side is a little deeper and a little more fast moving and it looked like anglers were over there they were letting the kids fish over here but you could do either one and we've got to go in don't know where that's coming from gee is that my microphone you think amen i don't i don't know okay all right all right we'll just see make sure to all make sure all other mics are off all other mics are muted except this one and that way we'll cut it down to the process of elimination and so so we're i'm going to show you just a few pictures of what the park looks like bear in mind this is an early saturday morning there's really no one there but it'll give you some idea of what you're going to see when you come right g-man let's see the pics if we can make it work so i put that one on purpose because i just want to see that smile kills me every time so uh there's sister debbie and i where i tell her i said honey you can get away with anything because that smile will get you off the hook amen and so um that that's the in the background there and that's that's one side of the river there's actually in this direction a whole another the river goes down both sides like a little island you actually have to cross over walkways to get to it next there's the one of the walkways you have to go how that smile you have to walk over that i have to keep concentrating here you have to walk over that that gangway there's like four or five of them and there's a one there's the number one pavilion brother george in the background okay next one g uh here is our number two pavilion now i i i made some notes that that i'm gonna need to take my handheld blower because the park is not it's not kept as good as i would like to see it we're gonna blow everything off and uh clean it up a little bit it's got power as you can see those lights are actually on and uh we're gonna maybe take some of those those paper table top cloths that you see the sisters do out here and they have rubber bands that go and make them wrap around for the win um we might we might grill some stuff we might order in some pizzas that's still being debated uh let's see i think we have a couple video shots still got another still picture gideon i think i have one more that's the that's the number two you can see the river this is the weightable side where all the kids were playing all right getting let's see the couple video shots i got volume i may i may not be talking i don't remember maybe i'm just taking a panorama i thought i was headed some words but it's okay if all they're seeing uh this is the waitable side this is where kids were playing everywhere on the far side it gets a little deep but um this just kind of pans around the park that's looking back at number one or no i think that's number two pavilion right there and then the other river you could see it on that far side right there um all right do i got one more video clip maybe yeah there's one of the walkways and this is we're just panning straight around that's the waitable side i don't know if the camera will come all the way around you couldn't see the river a little bit till you walk over near the other side and then it comes into good view i think that's the number two pavilion where we'll be meeting so that'll give you an idea yeah let's see if it goes on around yeah there there's the other side now that there's actually fat no that's the bank on the other side you can't see down in there's a fast moving uh river right there probably 20 feet wide that's the side that a lot of fishermen were fishing so if you want to have a nice little time in cherokee it's a popular tourist destination and maybe even take your family up for a day in advance on friday and and tour around and then saturday uh morning we'll be in the park um picking and grinning amen and singing and and fellowshipping and just having a good time as many of you as want to go are welcome to go as few if we just have a we've got a few musicians going that we know of and anybody else want to bring your kids for a nice day my we used to go up there as kids all the time kids love that place so uh it's awesome now i said all that and i got a caveat all right so the caveat is this that we may have to push the dates back and if we have to push them back too far it'll get cold in the mountains and we'd have to push it off to the spring so i need you to pray and the reason is is because there's a lot of fear up in that area over covid and um they're actually some of the schools it's not that they're spiking so bad in fact is some of the gale who works in the school said it doesn't even make sense they'll let two they'll send two kids home because they tested positive and they'll let their siblings who live in the same house come so go figure she said it's just ridiculous and some of the school zones are saying we're gonna we're gonna shut down others are still open and but jack did say to me that that they they will keep me informed and we've got to make a kind of a a go or not go decision pretty soon let me just say that as of today i'm still planning to do it on september the 18th but it could be that i'll have to come back and say things are starting to lock down and they won't even jax that they won't even let you in the park and even if they would nobody will even come he said because everybody is is afraid so i hate that covet devil you know it's just trying to get in the way of things so how about we pray and to say lord help us to have an opening there so that we don't have to wait i know the devil would love to cancel it but we're going to try to to have that but i will keep you posted week by week as i'm in contact with gail and jack and and gail being in the school system she has a real good feel for what's going on and jack knows what happens uh on the reservation because if the chief shuts it down it's shut down and even because that is even cherokee the city is part of the tribal reservation but it's where everybody can go it's their tourism area the other section is uh is gated and you you can only get in there by invitation uh unless you have unless your card carrying so that's the where jack will have to try to get me in so we pray for that friends we hope to do that on saturday the 18th of september amen praise the lord let's stand back to our feet this morning thank you for that time i will uh be studious on my sermon this morning i realize i've already took it taking quite a bit of time but i want to go into a thought that the lord put on my heart uh actually uh from the sermon i got this sermon wednesday night from brother brad's sermon my goodness what what a what an awesome job our brother did i i went back in the back office and i said brother brad i made so many notes i already got sermons off of that i'm gonna and i'm gonna preach on it so i've been thinking about it all week and i want to speak to you today on a single title called opportunity amen opportunity i want to look at job chapter 14 and we're going to go in one verse the book of job right before psalms the last book before the book of psalms job 14 and we're going to just read the opening verse and then we're going to go to a little place a little easier to find over in romans 8 but let's look at job 14 and verse 1. man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble amen let's read it again man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble now if it's man born of a woman i'm pretty sure that would include everybody so i'm pretty sure that nobody is exempt from the the second half of that verse amen man that is born of a woman is of a few days and full of trouble i want to look at romans chapter 8. and in romans chapter 8 we're going to begin at verse 12 romans 8 and verse 12. therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh ye shall die but however however having said that see if you live to the flesh you shall die but however if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body guess what good news you shall live now i would ask anybody to give me more polar opposites between dying and living there's not anything more polar opposite than dying or living amen then could i suggest to you there would be nothing more polar opposite than living by the flesh or living by the spirit amen amen are you half dead are you half alive so you can't live half to the flesh and half to the spirit if you live to the flesh you die if you live to the spirit you live amen all right let's look on verse 13 or i'm sorry 4 for verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear not you no not you a lot of people have not you say praise god amen many have but you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear you have received not everybody has but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we we say to god you're my dad amen you're my dad amen so we might be brothers from a different mother but we have the same father amen so let's look at it again for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself that one that helps you to live the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god well since all that's true if children then heirs and if we're heirs we're heirs of god amen and joint heirs with christ now you know you know why that's important because you can be an heir and not have any not have uh gotten any inheritance see it doesn't necessarily mean that anything's been distributed to you as an heir of god that's what that word means you are an heir but that doesn't mean you've got anything but as a joint heir with christ it means you actually it literally means that you are standing beside of christ and he is reaching into the father's treasure chest and you are reaching right beside him you are joint heirs with christ amen if here it is if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together is that your desire amen let's pray master we thank you for your word and i commit myself into your hands now in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated amen wait for all the transition amen all right now i'm speaking to you today on a single word opportunity and i think that i've been able in paul's letter to the romans in this eighth chapter i think that i have shown you tremendous opportunity amen i mean could i offer you any greater opportunity than to say how many would like to have eternal life how many would like to know that you've passed from death unto life you're safe you're home free you can never be condemned you can never be accused of sin before god you are completely bought purchased signed sealed and as far as the word of god you're already in heavenly places in christ jesus now i don't know about you but i think that would be far superior news than saying hey guess what i'm looking through your stuff and found you won the lottery you're 50 million dollars richer i found a ticket you haven't turned in yet guess what you got 50 million dollars say wow i wish that was me i'm giving you something that makes that seem like peanuts like peanuts that's nothing that'll that'll you you know some people have so much money there they'll never be able to spend it the antichrist will end up with it anyhow you see so jesus would say don't lay up your treasures here where thieves and robbers can get in and steal it from you where corruption and rust and moth can get in and but lay up treasures in heaven where there are no thieves there is no corruption there nothing can ever take i'm offering you something today that is so glorious and guess what you get to keep it you get to keep it nobody can take it from you even you can't forsake it even you can't lose it that you're that you have the ability not only in the world to come but you have the opportunity if you'd like it if you want it amen amen i can't force you to take it god won't force you to take it but he offers you an opportunity today to be free of the bondage of your fallen flesh and live righteously live holy wake up smelling the the air of cleanness be able to lay your head on your pillow at night and be content i'm offering you the joy of the lord i'm offering you the the oil of gladness some of you need it i'm here to tell you some of you need it not because you're a bad person but because life has really piled on you and you need the oil of gladness guess what i'm a delivery man today and i assure you that god will pour on you the oil of gladness in this service if you want it amen amen if you want it come on it's up to you amen i'm preaching on opportunity today there's never been a greater opportunity man that's born of a woman and we read in our opening text man say what if i don't take god's deal okay here's your life man born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble so there you go there you go america there you go beaufort there you go world there you go bethel tabernacle it's not rocket science there's no smoke and mirrors i i don't i'm not i'm not trying to whip up music i'm giving you an alternative you're born under a death curse christ offers you to do away with that it's really that simple the gospel is really that simple accepting the in faith in christ and and what was accomplished for you that day on calvary and reading about how that god came down to live inside of his church and those men standing there amen and jesus ascended up into the cloud probably one of the most supernatural things they'd ever seen now he had given them instructions very clear instructions that weren't complicated didn't take a law degree didn't take a college education and he said simply this go in terry until you be endued with power okay well what do we do you just go terry i know that but i mean when we get there what do we do you just wait but i mean what do we what do we do yeah you just wait yes well how do i know that that'll work because it's a promise and i'm telling you have i ever lied to you no jesus you've never lied then go into the city and wait on me i'll be alone just wait on me i will keep my word well how how are you going to do it don't worry i'll keep my word what's it going to look like don't worry amen as brother brad was preaching god's got this god's got this he just said to them go stand still in upper room i got this i'll be along when you're coming just wait till i get there and when i get there it'll be worth the wait now the beauty say well man in this rapid age you're going to tell me to wait actually the good news is today that i have better news for you today you have the opportunity to hear better news from me than those men heard from jesus so that's pretty cocky no it's not not once you understand what my news is you'll it'll go oh yeah right say what's your news you don't have to wait there's no more waiting why'd they have to wait because it had to be the 50th day there was 10 days left it only been it only been 40 days since its resurrection so prophecy couldn't be broken but guess what you don't have to wait you don't have to wait 10 days you have to wait 10 hours you have to wait 10 minutes you don't have to wait 10 seconds you can have the indwelling life of christ living inside of you pouring blessing on you giving you overcoming power how many want overcoming power my goodness i walk around in this sinful world and i'm sorry but i can't relate to the garbage that this world loves and feeds on it to me it's a vexation of spirit and i'm constantly going to bed saying lord cleanse my mind cleanse my heart and i'm constantly waking up every morning saying lord your mercies are new every morning and i need to avail myself because i don't want to walk around contaminated amen i don't amen i'm going to take my opportunity amen and jesus gave them an opportunity said now go and wait now you know the curious thing there was paul said that more than 500 people were standing there and heard jesus christ say that amen go and wait until you be endued with power and after 10 days there was only 120 left out of above 500 people amen say what happened to other people i don't know say what do you know i know what happened to the 120. well how do you know that because i've had the same experience i can't tell you why the other ones didn't wait i can't tell you why they didn't take the opportunity i can't tell you today why people don't take the opportunity i can't tell you today why god offers to heal you of any disease and sickness and yet i've met people who don't want to be healed i've met people who have gotten trapped in psychological trap they love the pity and you begin to talk to them about healing they get an attitude yeah i i i don't understand why people continue to feed on the poisons of the world they're not happy they're all the time sad they're all the time stressed out they're all the time banging their head and i say i got a remedy for that oh i don't want that i don't understand that i don't get that i love freedom i love liberty i love cleanness i love purity if you don't i don't get you but i'm i'm telling you i'm giving you an opportunity today is that if you'll just forget the your trials and just give them to christ don't worry he'll fix it i don't care what the problem is he can fix it in a day when when when what ought to be happening is you ought to be getting more on fire many are getting colder and colder say why is that happening easy answer amen the love of many because the love of the world the love of many shall wax cold amen amen because people enjoy the world more than they want the liberties and the joys and the happiness and you say you don't know what kind of trials i've been through you don't know how many what i've been through don't give me your trials i promise mine have probably been more i'm in a leadership role my life is on the line my soul is on the line i can be held accountable to god for every word i say to groups of people tell me you live under that amen tell me you've lived a day under that i've got a target on my back the devil hates me my picture hangs in hell on the most wanted most wanted poster some guys i was listening to a preacher one time he said man i heard some bad news i said oh brother what happened he said i found out the devil hates me he hates me i said that's bad news he goes no that's good news i'm just kidding it's good news i'm glad he hates me listen friends you know i i i br brother branham talked about it i could talk about it i i was you know 26 years you don't do this 26 years and not have scars and wounds and deep deep deep deep wounds and scars and it takes a toll and i'm not it takes a toll on you mentally it takes and i'm a baby compared to some like you get some pastors who have been more than double that i don't know how they're alive and and and so you know it comes back to sometimes what i what i've had to say here before i said here i made this statement you know and boy in this age it's it just it just needs to be said almost every service that sometimes my best advice to you is you say your best advice surely you're about to say i need to pray more well that's good advice but that might not even be your best advice well i need to read my bible more you man you can never read your bible too much that's excellent advice but sometimes people can't get the deliverance that reading their bible brings they can't get the freedom and the joy and the happiness that prayer brings because they can't get over their self and they're too jacked up and too complex and too mad and too hurt do you know that paul addressed that do you know that the apostle said listen i think it was paul might been one of the other apostles and he said listen i got a remedy for when you're feeling sorry for yourself he said consider christ jesus who suffered such a contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be weary and faint in your own mind unless you think you've got a big problem here was jesus completely innocent never done wrong thought wrong spoke wrong of anybody was there only to help and give his life was there to heal their sick and feed the hungry and raise the dead and was there to go about the bible says he went about doing good and they they murdered him and not he said well that's pretty bad that's that's a that's nothing that they that they murdered the bible says that when he when he was suffering that he would see his seed and and he would be content with his murder amen he would actually rejoice you know why because he knew he was getting you so getting murdered wasn't jesus main problem you know the thing that made him cry in another language you know the thing that maybe he he was so in such agony that his blood separated and and his sweat looked like blood and that's a medical condition that is only brought on by the most extreme almost unimaginable stress that can literally make your your sweat look like blood you say because everybody hated him no because they were beating him no he'll see his seed and he'll be happy actually when he got murdered the bible said that that god committed him to that that it actually you ready for this it actually pleased god to bruise him that way he said i thought god loved him he did do you know the thing that broke jesus heart more than anything was that even god forsook him amen and he went to calvary as a man and died and said eli eli la masa boxing being interpreted my god my my god you've been with me my whole life you're all i care about i live i've not even come to do i i'm not i it's written about me in the scrolls i've come to do thy will that's the only reason i'm here and you've left me and he who knew no sin became sin and took on all of your sin though he had never done it you did it you made the choices to do it you still make those choices to do it but every sin you've ever committed and every sin you will ever commit are met in christ on calvary and then we're going to think we're having a hard trial then just consider him who endured such a contradiction of sinners against himself that god on purpose traded him for you that he suffered all of that so you could have eternal life and then you think you've got a problem you don't have any problem you don't even have that much problem you know all you you know what you've got at worst a few days and full of trouble a few days in full of trouble and christ jesus offers you the ability to go to a world where you'll never have trouble again and you won't grow old and nobody will hurt your feelings and you'll never get hurt and you'll never have sorrow and you'll never have pain and distance will mean nothing and time will mean nothing and you won't have to pay bills and you won't owe taxes and you won't have stress and there won't be no anxiety and your neighbor across the street won't be blasting music that you hate and you and you won't have to put up with cigarette smoke coming out of a motel you won't have to sit at a stoplight and hear awful things you won't have to you won't have to constantly turn your head brothers you're going to a land where it's all pure where you can just wake up and be free hallelujah i don't got to battle anymore i'm here to tell you i'm offering you an opportunity today amen offering you an opportunity and he said all you have to do is go there and wait on me you know we are the sum of our experiences amen which in turn are largely the sum of our choices come on let's admit it we're talking about opportunity today we are the sum of our choices we're the sum of our experiences and our experiences are very largely the overwhelming lion's share of your experiences or based on choices you've made or might even be making now see you might be sitting there today and can't wait for brother jason to hurry so i can get back to that thing i like even though it's poisoning you and even though i'm giving you the words of life you're in a hurry see and listen i i how you know that brazilian i've sat in churches without the holy ghost before and think man i wish he would hurry that game comes well let me let me move on so we are the sum of our experiences which are largely the result of our choices and they're they're the sum of our choices either either direct or indirect right amen now you say brother jason why is that important that it's it's either direct our direct choices or are indirect the circumstances of our life that's important because even the things that happen to you that were not your choices we've got those i'm i'm sympathetic with you on that i've got some too i've got things that happen to me that i don't know why that got to happen to me why did that happen to me what did i do to deserve that i wish that'll never happen to me that caused me a problem in

seed and it grows a crop and you'll have a harvest amen it's a harvest you can't decline the wages of sin did you know sin pays wages and you can't refuse them you know why you know what the wages of sin are death you've got the opportunity to avoid that amen amen you've got the opportunity people lose sight of the fact don't lose sight of the fact young men young women married single even the middle and the older even it still applies to all of us everything you do is a seed everything you say everything you think it's going to grow something you hold on to a hurt hold on to an attitude
