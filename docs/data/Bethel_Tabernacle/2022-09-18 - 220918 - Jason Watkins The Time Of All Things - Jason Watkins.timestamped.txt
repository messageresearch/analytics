[0:00] And our spirits shall sorrow no more.
[0:04] Not a sigh for the blessing of rest. Not
[0:08] a sign for the blessing of rest. My
[0:11] goodness. My goodness. My goodness. Uh 1
[0:14] Peter chapter 4. Let's read and we'll
[0:16] let you be seated. Going to catch verses
[0:18] 3-7.
[0:25] Yes.
[0:29] For the time passed of our earthly life
[0:32] may suffice us to have wrought the will
[0:35] of the Gentiles when we walked in
[0:37] lasciviousness,
[0:38] lust, excess of wine, rellings,
[0:41] banquetings, and abominable idolatries.
[0:45] Boy, we had a pretty rough past, didn't
[0:46] we?
[0:48] Amen. None none of us good. Not one.
[0:51] Amen.
[0:52] Amen. We ought to just say, "Thank God
[0:54] for grace
[0:56] and mercy.
[0:57] Amen. Cuz we were all stinkers. Amen.
[1:01] Verse four. Wherein they think it
[1:04] strange that you run not with them to
[1:06] the same excess excessive riot, speaking
[1:09] evil of you. Who shall give account to
[1:13] him that is ready to judge the quick and
[1:16] the dead? For for this cause, for for
[1:19] this cause was the gospel preached also
[1:22] to them that are dead, that they might
[1:24] be judged according to men in the flesh,
[1:27] but live according to God in the spirit.
[1:30] I love this next verse, the seventh
[1:32] verse. But the end of all things is at
[1:35] hand. Be you therefore sober and watch
[1:39] unto prayer. I want to take a title
[1:42] today, the time of all things. The time
[1:46] of all things. Let's pray. Father,
[1:49] we thank you for your word this morning,
[1:52] Lord. And we are humbled to be here and
[1:55] master, I've just felt such a nearness
[1:58] to you this morning. Such an anointing
[2:00] upon the word and such the the word that
[2:03] has already gone forth, Lord, and the
[2:05] songs that have gone forth. how I could
[2:07] how I heard confirmation after
[2:09] confirmation after confirmation, Lord,
[2:12] even even to the degree that I I I was
[2:15] forced to uh to literally turn the
[2:18] Sunday school class off in my office
[2:20] because it it was just so so right in in
[2:24] step, Lord God. And I just thought, my
[2:26] goodness, the anointing of the Lord is
[2:29] is here today to bring this word to the
[2:31] church. Oh God, help us today, master,
[2:35] to be believers of your word. Bless us
[2:38] one and all as we do our best now, Lord,
[2:41] in service to you in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:44] God bless. You can be seated.
[2:47] Happy to still have brother Anton uh
[2:50] with us this this morning. And uh I I
[2:54] would try his last name, but it's
[2:55] Lithuanian, and I'd butcher it sure as
[2:57] anything. But I know that you've enjoyed
[3:00] his fellowship. We had him yesterday. A
[3:03] number of the brothers got to meet him
[3:05] there. Really good in the uh Saturday
[3:07] morning men's breakfast Bible study. Had
[3:10] a good time in the word yesterday. My
[3:12] sure appreciate all the brothers who are
[3:14] able to make it out on that uh on those
[3:16] Saturdays. We do that every other every
[3:18] other week or we try to anyway best we
[3:20] can. So I want you now to uh let's go to
[3:24] second Thessalonians. You'll put that up
[3:26] for me. May I please? and uh 2
[3:29] Thessalonians chapter 2. And I want to
[3:31] continue on now. And I I just want to
[3:35] say that, you know, you're you just to
[3:38] kind of give you a little bit of
[3:39] background, you know, the the the church
[3:42] there in that early uh Ephesian age,
[3:46] that that alpha church, they certainly
[3:49] believed that the coming the second
[3:52] coming of Christ was imminent upon them.
[3:55] Now, it was imminent in the mind of God
[3:58] when Jesus said to John, "Behold, I'm
[4:00] coming. I'm coming quickly. I'm coming
[4:02] soon." That he was not being facitious.
[4:06] That wasn't a joke. You have to
[4:08] understand that that a thousand of your
[4:10] earth years is just a day to him.
[4:12] Sister, happy to have you here. God
[4:13] bless you. See you too also. See, I'm
[4:15] still seeing visitors. So happy to have
[4:17] these different ones here with us. And
[4:19] uh and so we we find that it was just,
[4:23] you know, to to to God saying, you know,
[4:26] I'm coming. Now, we've looked at it as
[4:28] 2,000 years. We've had 20 centuries.
[4:31] We've had seven church ages. But God the
[4:35] Father always knew he was going to have
[4:38] seven church ages. And yet would still
[4:40] say, "I'm I behold, I come quickly
[4:43] and my reward is with me." He knew it
[4:45] would be 2,000 years in earth time, but
[4:48] he would still say, "I'm coming soon."
[4:51] And and that was constantly the message.
[4:54] And another apostle in another place
[4:56] says, "The one who who's coming will not
[4:59] tarry."
[5:00] See? And so so you have to understand,
[5:03] you've got your perspective, and you've
[5:05] got God's perspective. when God is
[5:07] giving that promise out using his his
[5:10] prophet from the future who's John's
[5:12] tour guide through the day of the Lord
[5:15] and the events leading up to it. You
[5:17] know, he said, you know, take this
[5:19] message to them. Behold, I'm coming
[5:20] quickly. Behold, I'm coming soon. Have
[5:23] everybody get ready and in in the mind
[5:25] of the Lord. It was only a couple days.
[5:28] I'll be there in just a couple days.
[5:30] Tell them everybody to get ready. Now,
[5:32] in our time, sure, it's taken 20
[5:35] centuries. And brother Brandham alludes
[5:36] to the fact that, you know, he's not
[5:38] going to let the church know that. They
[5:40] didn't realize that because because
[5:43] every age he's wanted them to believe
[5:45] the eminency of his coming that it's
[5:47] immediate. And so he, brother Brandham
[5:50] talks about that. I don't remember the
[5:51] exact language. I don't have it in front
[5:53] of me, but he alludes to that how that
[5:54] it would have I think the word he used
[5:56] it may have discouraged them that to
[5:58] know that no, he's not coming in my
[6:00] lifetime. and and and so we realized
[6:03] that that that that that many were
[6:05] running around. There was a lot of, you
[6:07] know, confusion as the as the early
[6:10] church began to slip and began to recede
[6:12] and began to backslide. You say, "My
[6:14] goodness, you shouldn't talk about the
[6:16] early church like that." I'm not talking
[6:18] about the elected family. The elected
[6:22] family has always stayed true to what
[6:24] God has revealed. I'm talking about the
[6:26] age, the age of the church. it began to
[6:29] backslide and as a whole began to
[6:31] backslide and the age with it. And so
[6:34] remember that in in in every age you had
[6:37] the true church and the false church.
[6:39] All right? So but even we find that the
[6:42] that the the gatherings of the true
[6:45] church that we find that the mysteries
[6:48] begin to fade and they begin to lose
[6:51] their understanding and that came from a
[6:54] relaxing. That's what that's what
[6:56] Ephesus, you know, uh goes goes on to if
[6:58] we start breaking down those words. And
[7:00] so we find that they begin to relax and
[7:03] they begin to backslide and Paul warned
[7:05] them about that. And Paul talks about,
[7:07] you know, that I I fear after my
[7:10] departure. You know, grievous wolves
[7:12] will come in among you, not sparing the
[7:13] flock. And you know, you you find you
[7:16] find John having to write and say, you
[7:19] know, anyone who will not confess that
[7:22] Jesus Christ has come in the flesh,
[7:24] that's Antichrist. Cuz the spirit of
[7:26] Antichrist, everybody in the modern day
[7:28] is worried about the Antichrist in the
[7:30] tribulation. They're totally unaware the
[7:32] Antichrist has been here for 2,000 years
[7:35] working in the Christian church. The
[7:38] spirit of Antichrist, the Bible says,
[7:40] which already doth work in the churches.
[7:42] So you you had him you had you know you
[7:45] you hadnosticism and the gnostics rising
[7:48] up and they they wanted to deny the
[7:52] physical incarnation of God in Christ.
[7:55] Now they had a reason for that. It
[7:57] wasn't just you know that that they were
[8:00] ignorant of the word. What the reason
[8:02] they were teaching that is because they
[8:05] did not want to um believe that God came
[8:10] in the flesh. Because if they believed
[8:12] that God came in the flesh, then that
[8:15] was an example of how they should live
[8:17] as men in the flesh,
[8:19] that Jesus was a prototype. He was the
[8:21] beginning of a brand new type of human,
[8:24] the beginning of the creation of God.
[8:26] And and if and if they could
[8:28] disassociate God from actually living as
[8:30] a human, then they did not need to
[8:33] practice holiness. They could live
[8:35] however they wanted and they could still
[8:37] claim to believe in the Lord Jesus
[8:39] Christ. So they're doing it today and I
[8:42] want to tell you that's not a new
[8:44] doctrine.
[8:45] It's not new to say I'm a Christian but
[8:48] I still want to live how I want to live.
[8:51] And and that's why you know John begins
[8:54] writing letters. If you won't confess
[8:56] that he came in the flesh then you're
[8:58] antichrist. It proves that you don't
[9:01] want the life you don't want to live the
[9:04] lifestyle he lived. So you you do that
[9:07] uh in a slick way by just saying, "Oh,
[9:10] he was an angel. He was not a human or
[9:12] he was an apparition or he was some
[9:13] form, but he was not actually a human
[9:16] man." Ianius tore them to pieces over
[9:18] that his militant way. Brother Brandham
[9:20] said he didn't mince words at all. If
[9:22] you go into his writings, uh he
[9:24] literally just called them the sons of
[9:25] Satan.
[9:27] He didn't play. And uh that's why
[9:29] brother Brandham chose him as that
[9:30] second messenger. Fact is he was the
[9:32] last messenger to have a clear
[9:34] understanding of the godhead. Brother
[9:36] Brandham teaches us and so it began to
[9:38] slip away during those times and you
[9:41] have apostles writing letters to the
[9:43] churches saying hey listen you need to
[9:45] earnestly contend for the faith once
[9:48] delivered. We're starting to slip here.
[9:50] Things are starting to go sideways. uh
[9:52] you know, apostles are starting to get
[9:54] martyed and killed and you know, James
[9:56] was put to the sword and Paul's been
[9:58] taken prisoner and John got sent to a
[10:00] prison camp and you know, and all of
[10:02] these different things and Thomas, we
[10:04] understand, was murdered, you know, in
[10:05] in Asia and and so so you're you're
[10:08] starting to see these things happen and
[10:11] and the church is saying, "But isn't he
[10:13] coming? Isn't he coming?" Yeah, he was
[10:14] coming.
[10:15] Yeah. Amen. But we know that that men
[10:19] men begin during that time where it's
[10:21] starting to, you know, the apostles are
[10:24] starting to die off. Confusion is
[10:26] starting to come in. False church is
[10:28] starting to make its way. The
[10:29] nostnostics are starting to invade. And
[10:32] people like Ananas and Safh
[10:35] who are make believers are sitting in
[10:37] true churches.
[10:38] Amen.
[10:40] See, so so then you you find that many
[10:43] of them begin to preach strange heresies
[10:46] and strange doctrines and they begin to
[10:49] lead whole households. The Bible says
[10:50] lead whole households and and and silly
[10:54] women and and and and and saying and
[10:56] then some of them were saying, you know,
[10:58] attacking Paul and saying, "Oh, he's an
[11:00] impostor." And they were attacking John.
[11:02] And John writes a letter saying, you
[11:04] know, there's a pastor up here in
[11:06] another church and he doesn't even
[11:07] receive me anymore. And and he as far as
[11:11] he's concerned, I'm anathema, but I'm
[11:12] going to go up there and I'm going to
[11:13] deal with him. And John did, you read
[11:16] the history and and Paul, you know, he's
[11:18] falsely accused of all these things. And
[11:20] th this was a time when the church was
[11:22] starting to slip away from that those
[11:24] early years of purity
[11:26] and men were starting to rise up saying
[11:28] the resurrection must already be passed
[11:31] because we know that he should have
[11:33] already been here. He he promised us he
[11:35] would be here. And so here here's the
[11:37] new doctrine. The resurrection is passed
[11:39] already
[11:42] because they're looking at Peter, right?
[11:44] The end of all things is at hand.
[11:47] They're looking at at at at another
[11:49] apostle saying he won't tarry. And now
[11:52] there's So now they conclude, "Wow, it
[11:55] must already be passed. We there now we
[11:58] we're going to have to have a new
[11:59] doctrine and figure out, you know, how
[12:01] are we going to get in? It must not be a
[12:02] corporal coming. It must be some kind of
[12:04] spiritual thing."
[12:06] See, so these things aren't new. You see
[12:09] these doctrines surface today. They're
[12:11] not new. the these are just these are
[12:13] just microwaved and reheated
[12:16] uhnosticism.
[12:20] I hate to burst their bubble. I just,
[12:22] you know, but I get, well,
[12:25] I I don't get pleasure in what they're
[12:28] doing, but I I I I do enjoy uh, you
[12:31] know, see men who are so puffed up in
[12:33] their knowledge and all of their false
[12:35] teaching and I just say, "Look, what
[12:36] you're saying isn't novel or new
[12:39] and and you know, because I I study the
[12:42] history and I go back to the original
[12:43] writings and that's what I do. It's what
[12:45] I love." And so, I've been doing it for
[12:46] years. So, it's it's hard to get those
[12:48] things past me because I'm I'm always
[12:50] correlating prophecy not to scripture,
[12:53] not to just prophecy, but into the past.
[12:55] And I think any student of the Bible is
[12:57] good to do that, a student of the of the
[12:59] word. So, so we we find that that th
[13:02] this was what was going on. And Paul has
[13:05] to come along here now and start to
[13:07] correct some of this teaching. He says,
[13:08] "Now in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2,
[13:11] referring to the day of the Lord, now we
[13:13] beseech you, brethren, by the coming of
[13:15] our Lord Jesus Christ,
[13:17] and by the gathering together unto him,
[13:20] that ye be not soon shaken in mind."
[13:23] See, so why did he have to say that?
[13:25] It was obviously happening.
[13:27] See, he's not just making, you know,
[13:29] there's no nothing in the Bible that's
[13:31] that's that's pointless. All right? that
[13:33] you be not soon shaken in mind or be
[13:36] troubled, neither by spirit, nor by
[13:38] word, nor by letter as from us, as that
[13:41] the day of Christ is at hand. Let no man
[13:43] deceive you by any means, for that day
[13:46] shall not. Now, he's not arguing against
[13:48] Peter.
[13:49] He's not saying, "Hey, Peter was wrong
[13:51] and I got to fix it." That's not what's
[13:53] happening here. He's attacking these men
[13:55] who are saying, you know, it's all
[13:57] passed into something spiritual now.
[13:59] Paul's trying to bring everybody back to
[14:01] re to common sense and say listen let no
[14:04] man deceive you by any means for that
[14:06] day shall not come except there come a
[14:09] falling away first and that man of sin
[14:11] be revealed the son of predition. Now
[14:14] there there's there's no way they could
[14:17] have known what this was going to look
[14:19] like in 2022.
[14:22] Amen.
[14:22] Did Paul Well, I don't know. We'll find
[14:24] out someday. I do know that he was
[14:27] caught up to the third heaven and saw it
[14:28] and heard things he couldn't even wasn't
[14:30] even allowed to say.
[14:32] And brother Brandham says God doesn't
[14:33] tell his prophets everything, but
[14:35] neither does his prophets tell the
[14:36] people everything.
[14:38] See,
[14:40] so he says, "For that day shall not come
[14:41] except there come a falling away first,
[14:43] and that man of sin be revealed, the son
[14:45] of predition, who opposeth and exaltth
[14:48] himself above all that is called God, or
[14:50] that is worshiped, so that he is God,
[14:52] siteth in the temple of God, showing
[14:54] himself that he is God." In other words,
[14:56] it the the it's it the the the
[14:59] resurrection, the rapture can't come
[15:02] until Satan fulfills his desire that
[15:07] Isaiah prophesied where said, you have
[15:10] said in your heart, I will ascend. I
[15:13] will be like the most high. And Paul is
[15:16] saying until Satan is able to accomplish
[15:18] that, God's not going to, you know, do
[15:20] an end around or sucker punch him and
[15:23] pull us out of the way. God's going to
[15:24] let him fulfill. God's going to give him
[15:27] 6,000 years to complete his Eden.
[15:30] Amen.
[15:31] Just like God had 6,000 years. And so th
[15:34] this is why brother Brandon would come
[15:36] into scriptures like this and others and
[15:40] talk about that that day of darkness.
[15:42] And brother Brandon would take sermons,
[15:44] you know, like the God of this evil age,
[15:46] or he would take something like Satan's
[15:47] Eden, and he would go back to Paul's
[15:50] letters, and he would prove to say the
[15:52] day Paul was talking about is now.
[15:57] That what you're looking at in the
[15:59] modern 20th and 21st century is you are
[16:03] now looking at modern events made clear
[16:05] in prophecy.
[16:08] Because it had to go through seven ages.
[16:10] that had to complete 6,000 years. Satan,
[16:12] it took him that long to get his to get
[16:15] Satan's Eden ready. And and guess what?
[16:18] Here you are.
[16:20] So, I'm here to tell you today, you are
[16:22] living in the time of all things.
[16:25] We're not standing back waiting for
[16:27] years and years and decades of prophecy.
[16:30] You are now living in the time of all
[16:32] things.
[16:33] Well, let me give you some good news.
[16:35] This is the time of the overcomer. This
[16:38] is the time of total victory. This is
[16:40] the time of perfect faith. And you're
[16:42] living in it and you have access to it.
[16:45] It's here.
[16:48] Amen.
[16:51] Verse four, who opposeth and exaltth
[16:53] himself above all that is called God,
[16:56] or that is worshiped, so that he as God
[16:57] sitth in the temple of God, showing
[16:59] himself that he is God. Verse 5,
[17:00] remember you not, that when I was yet
[17:03] with you, I told you these things, and
[17:06] now you know what withholdeth, that he
[17:08] might be revealed
[17:11] in his time. For the mystery of iniquity
[17:14] doth already work, only he who now letth
[17:18] will let until he, that's Christ,
[17:21] and the bride,
[17:22] be taken out of the way. Amen.
[17:24] And then and then now now you're coming
[17:27] over into chapter 11 and they kill two
[17:30] prophets. And and as brother Matt was
[17:33] talk teaching this morning, I literally
[17:35] had to turn his class off because I
[17:36] couldn't believe what I was hearing. He
[17:38] was literally using lines out of my
[17:40] notes verbatim.
[17:43] And I wrote to him and I said, "Did you
[17:44] break into my house last night? Did you
[17:46] hack my computer? What in the world? You
[17:48] thief." So I just turned him off. That
[17:50] was got rid of him.
[17:54] I've never had to do that. And so, so,
[17:58] so we find that, you know, he he says
[18:03] this is what withholdeth. And and
[18:05] there's where brother Brandham
[18:07] interprets how that the the gent the
[18:11] Jews brought the gospel to the Gentiles
[18:13] and the Gentiles take it back to the
[18:15] Jews. And he'll do and brother Brandham
[18:17] interprets that. He said he'll he'll
[18:19] have Moses and Elijah to go forth and
[18:22] take this very message that you Gentiles
[18:26] are loving and it's changing your life
[18:28] and he's going to take the same message
[18:30] which is going to produce the same faith
[18:32] in those elected Jews and that's going
[18:34] to that Amen. that's going to bring a
[18:36] perfect faith that's going to bring the
[18:38] same token, the same Holy Ghost and
[18:41] they're going to be born again.
[18:44] Amen. See, and this explains why when
[18:47] you come to the 14th and 15th chapter,
[18:50] you find, you know, especially chapter
[18:52] 15, you find the the 144,000 and the
[18:55] foolish virgin, the remnant of the
[18:57] woman's seed. You find them all singing
[18:59] and one's got the song of Moses and
[19:01] another's got the song of the lamb and
[19:02] the ones who have the song of Moses
[19:04] identifies them as 144,000 and they're
[19:06] in the millennium. The ones who have the
[19:08] song of the lamb, which is Christ, don't
[19:10] go in the millennium because that's the
[19:12] foolish virgin.
[19:13] And they have to abide under the altar
[19:15] of God in a paradise waiting out the
[19:17] thousand years. You say, "Well, why
[19:19] they're both there together? Why does
[19:20] some get to go and others don't?" Well,
[19:22] they're all leaving this realm. Thank
[19:25] God.
[19:26] They're going they're they're entering
[19:28] into a realm of paradise. And so, but
[19:30] you find it's because that the 144,000,
[19:34] they're in the millennium with us
[19:35] because they're born again like you are.
[19:38] Amen.
[19:39] See, he that letth will let until he,
[19:41] Christ in the bride, be taken out of the
[19:43] way. And then the eagle anointing lifts
[19:45] up, flies east, picks up Moses and
[19:47] Elijah, and the gospel goes to the Jews.
[19:50] And then they they murder them, and they
[19:52] martyr them. The 144,000 are martyed.
[19:55] The prophets are martyed. The f the
[19:56] foolish virgin are all martyed. And then
[19:58] grace is completely gone. There's no
[20:01] more blood in the earth. All the
[20:02] redeemed are now dead and killed. And
[20:05] then the Bible says, "And the the end of
[20:07] the second woe, behold, the third woe
[20:10] cometh quickly."
[20:11] Amen.
[20:12] See, and it wraps up very fast. And so
[20:15] so so you you you find that prophecy
[20:18] moving at a at a perfect pace. Now, I'm
[20:22] I'm I'm dropping these nuggets to you,
[20:25] and it's it's it's definitely augmenting
[20:27] what you heard this morning if you were
[20:28] here in the Sunday school class. Hope
[20:30] you were. And and and and the reason
[20:33] that these things are so important is
[20:35] because it strengthens the reality of my
[20:39] title, the time of all things.
[20:43] Which means there's no more time for
[20:46] playing church.
[20:48] There's no more time for you to stay
[20:50] bound.
[20:51] This is the time of victory.
[20:53] This is the time of total freedom.
[20:56] This is the hour when the power of the
[20:58] word is so strong, if you'll take it,
[21:00] it'll change everything about you.
[21:04] This is the time when sickness can will
[21:07] lose its hold and even your body at the
[21:09] molecular level will be changed.
[21:13] Oh, I'm here to tell you something,
[21:15] friends. If you're sitting a long time
[21:17] sick in your body, you are to stand up
[21:19] and claim victory today. If you've got
[21:21] an oppression, if you've got a trial, if
[21:24] you've got some plague, I say I'd stand
[21:26] to my feet and say, "Today, I am free
[21:29] from that." And I declare it in the
[21:31] presence of God.
[21:34] Hallelujah.
[21:35] Doesn't matter what it is.
[21:37] Doesn't matter what the need is. This is
[21:39] the time of all things. This is the time
[21:42] when every child I have is claimed under
[21:44] the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. This
[21:46] is a time when Satan can't hold us any
[21:48] longer.
[21:50] Glory to God.
[21:53] Hallelujah.
[21:56] Thank you, Jesus.
[21:58] This is the time of supreme power
[22:01] invested in the bride.
[22:02] That's right.
[22:04] See? And then verse eight,
[22:07] then shall that wicked be revealed whom
[22:11] the Lord shall consume with the spirit
[22:14] of his mouth. And I I don't want to go
[22:15] into all this breakdown. shall destroy
[22:18] um how much do I want to shall let's not
[22:21] let and destroy with the brightness of
[22:23] his coming even him whose coming is
[22:27] after the working of Satan with all
[22:28] power and signs and lying wonders with
[22:30] all deceivleness of unrighteousness in
[22:32] them that perish sad story isn't it
[22:36] because they received not the love of
[22:40] the truth
[22:42] that they might be saved
[22:46] Receiving
[22:49] doctrinal teaching alone, even correct
[22:52] doctrinal teaching alone, is not in and
[22:56] of itself what gives you eternal life.
[22:58] Amen.
[22:59] Because that's the secret Satan knows.
[23:02] He doesn't care how religious you are.
[23:04] You need to go to church, but that
[23:06] doesn't bother him.
[23:08] See, you you you need correct teaching.
[23:11] But he doesn't care how right you are in
[23:13] your doctrine.
[23:14] Because here's what he know. If you
[23:16] don't have a love for that truth,
[23:18] if that truth isn't everything to you,
[23:21] if that word isn't a person of Christ
[23:23] who you love and whom you adore and whom
[23:27] you want to give your whole life to, oh,
[23:29] you're still sitting in your sins, my
[23:31] friend. And I'm offering you today to
[23:34] say, "This is the time of all things.
[23:36] This is the time of perfect love. This
[23:38] is the time of the token.
[23:40] This is the time when you can when you
[23:43] can reach out by faith because you've
[23:45] recognized your day and its message and
[23:48] you recognize who you are and your
[23:51] position in the word. And you have a
[23:53] right to make a claim. And I want to
[23:56] tell you in the time of all things, you
[23:58] have all rights.
[24:00] It's in your inheritance. You have a
[24:03] right to the power of God. You don't
[24:06] need anyone's permission.
[24:09] I'm here to tell you, they've had all
[24:10] kinds of camps of this and camps of that
[24:12] and and and emotional this and emotional
[24:15] that. And all they did, all they did was
[24:19] when you got into their camps, they told
[24:20] you what you could believe and what you
[24:22] couldn't believe. And they told you, you
[24:24] know, whether they were very emotional
[24:26] or didn't believe in emotion, they told
[24:28] you you could have this and all you got
[24:30] to do is name it and claim it or over
[24:31] here, no, it's gone. It's a day's past.
[24:33] You can't have that thing. I don't need
[24:35] anyone's permission to believe every
[24:38] word. I don't need anyone's permission
[24:41] to believe in the power of God. I don't
[24:44] need anyone's permission to operate the
[24:46] gifts of the spirit.
[24:48] It's my inheritance.
[24:53] And I'm in the day of all things.
[24:58] It's all revealed to me. It's all open
[25:01] to me.
[25:03] Amen.
[25:07] Verse 10.
[25:09] Oh, I'm sorry. Verse uh yeah, verse 10.
[25:16] Verse 11. For and for this cause
[25:20] God shall send them strong delusion
[25:23] that they should believe a lie
[25:26] that they might all be damned who
[25:27] believed not the truth
[25:29] but had pleasure. So it shows where
[25:31] their love was. Right. Yeah.
[25:33] Their love wasn't in the truth. They had
[25:34] pleasure in unrighteousness.
[25:37] Amen.
[25:38] So you can see
[25:41] it's not about
[25:44] believing or disbelieving teaching.
[25:47] It's a love for God's word
[25:50] or a pleasure in unrighteousness.
[25:53] And and and you know so so so th this is
[25:57] how these how these things become
[25:59] identified. See, and and we don't judge
[26:02] uh motives. We're not supposed to do
[26:03] that because you don't know what's in a
[26:05] man's heart. I get that. We we can judge
[26:07] behavior.
[26:09] We certainly can judge behavior, but I
[26:11] don't I don't try to judge motives. I
[26:12] don't know what's in a person's heart.
[26:14] All I can do is read the scripture and
[26:16] say to myself, "Oh, when he appeared, I
[26:19] loved him."
[26:20] As Paul said, not only for me also, but
[26:23] for them who love his appearing. And
[26:24] when he has appeared in this day, I'm
[26:27] sorry if you don't, but I love his
[26:29] appearing. It's my life. Hallelujah. Is
[26:32] it your life today?
[26:36] And God has moved down in among us.
[26:40] Amen.
[26:41] Amen.
[26:41] Amen. God has moved among us.
[26:44] And we can see it.
[26:46] We We know his presence is here.
[26:51] That they all might be damned who
[26:53] believe not the truth, but had pleasure
[26:56] in unrighteousness.
[26:58] Now, Revelation chapter 1
[27:03] 1:3, the revelation of Jesus Christ,
[27:05] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[27:06] servants things which must shortly come
[27:08] to pass, shortly. And he sent and
[27:11] signified by his angel unto his servant
[27:13] John. Now, this same signifying angel,
[27:16] John tried to worship him two or three
[27:18] times because he was so much like Christ
[27:21] that John had been around Christ. And
[27:24] when he saw that spirit so manifested in
[27:27] this prophet from the future that he
[27:30] tried to fall down and worship him and
[27:31] the prophet kept having to stand him up
[27:33] and say, "Don't worship me.
[27:35] I'm just your brother. I'm just a fellow
[27:37] servant. I'm one of the prophets." So
[27:39] this signifying angel, this tour guide,
[27:41] this prophet from the future.
[27:44] He's giving him this message and and he
[27:46] says verse two, who bear record of the
[27:49] word of God and the testimony of Jesus
[27:51] Christ and of all things that he saw.
[27:54] Blessed is he that readeth and they that
[27:56] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[27:59] those things which are written therein.
[28:02] Here it is again. For the time is at
[28:04] hand.
[28:05] Now John, understand this. John has been
[28:10] transported to the day of the Lord.
[28:13] Yeah.
[28:13] To the judgment day. That's the day of
[28:15] the Lord is the day of judgment. Go back
[28:16] all through the Old Testament. That's
[28:17] what it it's referring to. The great day
[28:19] of the Lord,
[28:20] the great day of God when he's going to
[28:22] come with and take vengeance and set up
[28:24] his family in a millennial world.
[28:27] So now John is going to be given a tour
[28:30] of 2,000 years where God's going to show
[28:34] him and write it in a book full of
[28:36] symbols how he how he did it. Say, "You
[28:41] mean how he's going to do it?" No. No.
[28:42] No, no, no. How he did it? Remember,
[28:44] John's already called all the He's
[28:46] transported all the way to that time.
[28:49] He's standing there. Don't think of time
[28:50] linearly like you do. You get trapped
[28:52] up. God's not bound by that. A prophet
[28:54] could stand here and look at your life
[28:56] and go into your past and stand and and
[28:58] tell you what you prayed in a prayer
[29:00] or what a doctor said to you in a
[29:02] hospital room or the color of clothing
[29:04] you were wearing. And then he can come
[29:05] right here and go in on into your future
[29:07] and say you'll be in a car and you'll
[29:08] call it this way and this this very
[29:10] thing will happen.
[29:11] So, so don't don't get trapped by the
[29:13] classical models of space and time.
[29:16] You understand? God's not bound by any
[29:18] of that stuff. He built it.
[29:20] He moves in and out of it. Moves forward
[29:22] and backwards of it.
[29:23] And it's all re it's all right now to
[29:25] God. There is no yesterday or tomorrow.
[29:27] It's all now.
[29:30] And so John is is brought forward. And
[29:32] there's where he shows him the ages.
[29:34] Yes, it's going to be the future of the
[29:36] ages, but then he goes immediately from
[29:38] chapter 3 into chapter four and five.
[29:40] And brother Brandham shows now John is
[29:42] being showed. The church went up at the
[29:44] end of chapter 3. Now John is going to
[29:46] be showed in chapters four and five and
[29:48] onward how God did it.
[29:51] How he pulled it off. This is how he did
[29:53] it. And he sent a messenger. He had
[29:55] stars in his right hand and sent them to
[29:56] each age and they caught it and ran with
[29:58] it. And then and then you're going to
[30:00] see how that the there were seals
[30:01] operating and there was a white horse
[30:03] and and there was a lion and you got all
[30:05] these symbolism and it's going to show
[30:07] how that it was Christ and the
[30:08] antichrist fighting all the way along
[30:09] until it gets down to the to the time of
[30:11] the end.
[30:13] And at the time of the end he would
[30:14] visit the earth with a prophet who would
[30:16] catch the last remaining message
[30:18] and that would gather a bride from
[30:20] around the world and form her into the
[30:22] living image of the living God. Oh my
[30:28] So he says, "For the time is at hand."
[30:32] Then we then we let's look at that's the
[30:34] first of it of that of that prophetic
[30:37] book. Then we go to the last chapter,
[30:39] chapter 22, verse 6. And he said unto
[30:42] me, "These things are faithful and true.
[30:46] And the Lord God of the holy prophet
[30:48] sent his angel to show unto his servants
[30:52] the things which must shortly be done.
[30:54] Behold, I come quickly.
[30:58] Blessed is he that keepeth the saying
[31:01] of the prophecy of this book. So now,
[31:05] not only did he assure the church that
[31:08] it would he would come quickly and come
[31:10] soon at the beginning, but now he's
[31:14] standing in chapter 22 at the end of it
[31:16] all. And he's saying, I mean, it's going
[31:18] to represent 20 centuries. And he's
[31:21] standing at the end of it going,
[31:23] "Behold, I come quickly." From that
[31:25] perspective.
[31:26] Yeah. Amen.
[31:27] Amen.
[31:29] So don't be weary and welloing. You'll
[31:32] reap if you faint not. Don't faint.
[31:35] Don't faint. Be strong in the Lord.
[31:38] He who you look for will suddenly come
[31:40] to his temple.
[31:42] Oh my.
[31:45] Here's the important part of that verse.
[31:47] Verse seven. Behold, I come quickly.
[31:49] Blessed is he that keepeth the saying of
[31:51] the prophecy of this book. Keep the
[31:53] saying of it. See, and I, John, saw
[31:56] these things and heard them. And when I
[31:57] heard them, when I heard and seen, I
[31:59] fell down to worship before the feet of
[32:00] the angel, which show me these things.
[32:02] So, here's this prophet from the future.
[32:05] Then said he unto me, "See thou do it
[32:07] not, for I am thy fellow servant, and of
[32:08] thy brethren the prophets, and of them
[32:10] which keep the sayings of this book,
[32:12] worship God." And he saith unto me,
[32:14] "Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
[32:16] this book, for the time is at hand.
[32:19] The time is at hand.
[32:22] Now we go on because now you watch. Now
[32:25] watch how the tribulation period starts
[32:27] to set in. Verse 11. He that is unjust,
[32:30] let him be unjust still. This is the
[32:33] scripture brother Brandon would go to
[32:34] every time when the bride is gone. Now
[32:37] let he that is filthy be filthy still.
[32:39] No one is saved. No Gentiles are saved
[32:43] in the millennium. They already have in
[32:46] the in the tribulation. They already
[32:48] have salvation in Christ. Now, they're
[32:51] not redeemed. They're not born again.
[32:53] Matthew 25 proves that. They've got to
[32:54] come there and be granted eternal life.
[32:57] But they do have a saving faith in
[32:59] Christ. And they're they're they're
[33:02] righteous. And that you say, "How do we
[33:04] know who that is?" It's not hard.
[33:06] They're righteous.
[33:08] The Bible calls them saints, which means
[33:11] sanctified ones.
[33:13] Amen. It's not church people who don't
[33:16] live sanctified lives. That's not
[33:19] foolish virgin.
[33:20] Amen.
[33:21] It's never been. It never will be.
[33:23] It is saints. It is righteous. And the
[33:26] king said unto the righteous, and the
[33:28] righteous said unto the king.
[33:31] And these were saints. These were
[33:33] sanctified ones.
[33:35] See? So, so we find that he says, "He
[33:39] that is unjust, let him be unjust still.
[33:41] And he which is filthy, let him be
[33:44] filthy still. And he that is righteous,
[33:47] let him be righteous still. And he that
[33:48] is holy, let him be holy still. And
[33:51] behold, here it is again. I come
[33:53] quickly, and my reward is with me to
[33:55] give every man according to his work
[33:56] shall be. I, Jesus, have sent mine angel
[34:00] to testify. Verse 16, I'm sorry,
[34:02] Jeremiah. Verse 16. I, Jesus, have sent
[34:04] mine angel to testify unto you these
[34:06] things in the churches. I am, who are
[34:09] you? I am the root and the offspring of
[34:11] David and the bright and morning star.
[34:13] And the spirit and the bride say come.
[34:15] And let him that heareth say come. And
[34:18] let him that is a thirst come. And
[34:21] whosoever will let him take the water of
[34:24] life freely. This is the time of all
[34:27] things when a bride is seated in
[34:31] authority speaking in the voice of the
[34:33] king. The spirit and the bride say come.
[34:37] This is the bride being the final voice
[34:40] to the final age saying, "Whoever wants
[34:43] some of this water,
[34:45] [Applause]
[34:46] come freely."
[34:50] See, you're the one who you are the only
[34:52] ones that the the the bride seated here
[34:57] scripturally speaking is the only ones
[35:00] with authority to to dispense eternal
[35:03] life.
[35:04] Amen. for redemption. I'm not talking
[35:07] about people who can get saved with a
[35:09] saving grace in the in the works of
[35:11] Calvary. You you have to separate that
[35:14] be because it some of them are well I'll
[35:16] get to it in a minute. I don't want to
[35:16] get ahead of myself. But but we find
[35:19] that that that's why when some years ago
[35:22] I think maybe uh see I was ministering
[35:24] in oh where was I at? uh in in Ontario
[35:28] and the Pope Pope Francis, you know,
[35:31] with all of his superstardom, he had
[35:34] just sent out a decree and uh he you
[35:38] know, he was he was going to I forget
[35:40] the word Jubilee with Jubilee meant
[35:42] freedom.
[35:44] It meant you can go free. Now, this is
[35:46] this is the Jubilee and the and the and
[35:48] basically it was a it was just a a sales
[35:51] pitch to get everybody to come back to
[35:53] the mother. Yeah.
[35:54] Yeah. Amen.
[35:55] But it was a jubilee and he pronounced a
[35:57] jubilee to the world. And I was at that
[36:00] minister and the minister's meeting and
[36:02] the brothers asked me said, "Brother
[36:03] Jason, what do you think about the
[36:05] pope's jubilee announcement?" I said,
[36:07] "It's illegitimate."
[36:09] Amen.
[36:09] They said, "Wow, that's a strong word."
[36:11] I said, "Of course." I said, "Only the
[36:13] bride of Christ is authorized to offer
[36:15] Jubilee. She's the only one with
[36:17] authority to to to give you a word
[36:19] that'll set you free
[36:21] from every sin and and wipe out
[36:24] everything in your old past and make you
[36:26] a brand new creation in Jesus Christ.
[36:29] I'm here to tell you today, I'm offering
[36:31] you a jubilee.
[36:34] Hallelujah.
[36:37] All right, let's go. Um, Brother Caleb,
[36:40] oh, thank you. Title screen, please.
[36:42] Back one back. All right, let me power
[36:45] up here.
[36:46] So, the time of all things. All right,
[36:50] now watch and I'm I'm trying to watch my
[36:53] uh watch the clock there. So, just stay
[36:55] with me. All right, you good?
[36:58] So, um brother Brandham comes along
[37:00] here. The seven church ages. Now, the
[37:03] book of Revelation,
[37:05] how it's made up, and Daniel ties in
[37:08] with it. Isaiah ties in with it. uh all
[37:12] the Old Testament ties in with it. Let
[37:15] me make a quick adjustment. All the Old
[37:17] Testament uh ties in with it and it's
[37:22] the book of of the revelation of Jesus
[37:25] Christ. See the book of the revelation
[37:27] of Jesus Christ. And then in there there
[37:31] is seven churches, seven plagues, seven
[37:35] seals, seven trumpets.
[37:38] Now, a trumpet
[37:40] represents war, a seal, a mystery
[37:44] unfolding, and a plague is what follows
[37:47] every war. And by God's help, and with
[37:51] the book of history, catch that line,
[37:54] he's going to prove by history.
[37:57] See, he's going to place these modern,
[38:00] he's going to place modern events of the
[38:02] day and historical events in prophecy.
[38:06] All right. So he says, "And by God's
[38:09] help and with the book of history, I can
[38:12] prove to you that we're living at the
[38:15] seventh trumpet for the seventh plague
[38:18] and the seventh seal to be opened and
[38:20] the seventh vial to be poured out when
[38:22] the sixth one sound will get on that
[38:24] maybe the sealing away on Friday night."
[38:28] He says, "When the first world war," Now
[38:30] look at him go back and tie that sixth
[38:32] trumpet under that sixth seal which is
[38:34] tribulation. Yeah.
[38:35] And he's going to he's going to go back
[38:37] to the start of the 20th century. You
[38:40] say, "Does that make sense?" Of course
[38:41] it does. That's when the three woes
[38:44] that's when the three woes would have
[38:45] came and swept mankind from the earth.
[38:47] But an angel rose out of the east with
[38:49] the seal of the living God. Proved it
[38:51] was Christ.
[38:52] He rose out of the east and Christ is
[38:54] the only one who has conceal you.
[38:56] And he says, "Wait, wait, wait. I I know
[38:59] that this is prophecy and it's just
[39:00] going to go boom, boom, boom, boom. But
[39:02] you got to hold up. You got we got to we
[39:04] got to pace this because I got I got
[39:07] children who have got to be sealed. Some
[39:09] of them aren't even in the earth yet.
[39:10] And so we can we can go with the first
[39:12] one and then you got to stop it and then
[39:14] we can move the second one and let it go
[39:15] and let it go and let it go and then we
[39:17] got to stop it. See, you remember when
[39:20] brother Brandham look away at Jesus
[39:22] and he says, "Now I got to you're going
[39:25] to see some strange things.
[39:27] You're going to, he said, I don't mean
[39:28] anything sinful, but you're going to see
[39:30] me start dropping back.
[39:33] He says, now you've seen the third pole.
[39:36] It's been vindicated. There was there
[39:39] were squirrels created twice. There was
[39:42] Hadty, right? There there was the fish
[39:45] given brought back a resurrection. There
[39:47] was the storm. There was his own wife.
[39:49] You know, before the doctor's hand
[39:51] touches,
[39:52] it'll vanish. and she waddled up in
[39:54] waddled into the office with a tumor the
[39:57] size of a game ball and and carefully
[40:01] got up on a table and laid out with a
[40:04] big swelled place. And when the doctor's
[40:06] hand went to touch it, it vanished.
[40:08] Hallelujah.
[40:10] It vanished.
[40:12] Like boom, gone.
[40:15] And before the doctor's hand touched it.
[40:18] And a doctor was a witness. and X-rays
[40:21] are witness.
[40:23] I tell you, this thing wasn't done in a
[40:24] corner, friends.
[40:28] Brother Brother Charlie tells that we
[40:31] ate those squirrels. And his testimony
[40:33] was not one of them had a navl.
[40:38] Amen.
[40:39] Not one of them had a belly button
[40:42] because they weren't born. They were
[40:44] created. Right.
[40:47] See,
[40:48] and so so we find that that that these
[40:51] things are moving along and and he's
[40:54] he's going to show that how this all and
[40:57] and so brother Brandham's point is now
[40:59] it's almost like we have been thrust
[41:02] forward ahead of history. And so now we
[41:03] got to drop back. Wait a minute. We got
[41:05] to and brother says we got to let this
[41:06] other catch up.
[41:08] What other? Well, there's politics and
[41:10] science and education and technology and
[41:13] social issues and church and ecumenical
[41:15] and the sellout and the Roman church and
[41:17] and denominationalism. It's got to all
[41:19] start to catch up because God's got to
[41:21] run this all together. We got to stay in
[41:23] we got to keep it all together. And so
[41:26] here you go in the book of Revelation
[41:27] and those walls are just going to sweep
[41:29] man from the earth and the angel rises
[41:31] up and they don't know to this day who
[41:33] stopped World War I.
[41:34] Amen.
[41:36] And that war, I didn't bring I didn't
[41:38] bring a history lesson here today. I I
[41:40] got one I could give you on World War I.
[41:42] It's astonishing. I can't wait till I
[41:44] can sit down with Brother Teddy and we
[41:45] can go over it. Brother Teddy's my
[41:46] history buddy, man. Wow.
[41:48] What a prodigy. And so, uh, and so, uh,
[41:52] Brother Teddy, you're going to enjoy it,
[41:53] man. I got some World War I data.
[41:55] Probably won't blow your mind, but it
[41:56] blew mine. And, and and and it was
[41:59] unprecedented on the scale the world had
[42:01] never seen.
[42:03] They had never seen global war on that
[42:06] scale.
[42:07] Amen.
[42:08] And it was prophecy.
[42:11] And so God is regulating and he's
[42:13] holding and stopping it, waiting. It's
[42:14] got to go peace meal. A piece at a time.
[42:16] A piece at a time. All right. Back to
[42:18] our quote. I can't get sidetracked.
[42:19] Don't let it be up here all day because
[42:20] I get I love that stuff. All right. Now
[42:23] watch. Let's let's go back. All right.
[42:24] When the first world war, why that sixth
[42:28] trumpet sounded according exactly
[42:30] according to the time God spoke it. So
[42:32] now you've got tribulation
[42:34] already starting in the earth, but it
[42:36] gets paused and it gets governed and it
[42:40] gets regulated cuz then a second wo is
[42:42] going to come several decades later and
[42:44] Germany and Nazi Germany is going to
[42:46] rise and they're going to go off with
[42:47] Ikeman and Hitler and go after the the
[42:50] Jews. See? And so this is all when say
[42:53] why do you study all that? Because it
[42:55] lets me know God's in control.
[42:58] He's perfectly in control. And I was
[43:01] preaching that Wednesday. There's
[43:02] nothing out of cater.
[43:04] He's in complete control of world
[43:07] events.
[43:10] So you see here, so now exactly
[43:13] according to the time God spoke it,
[43:15] exactly geographically following the
[43:18] seal before that and when the mystery
[43:19] was revealed in there for the baptism of
[43:22] the Holy Ghost. See there's Isuza coming
[43:25] in for the mystery of the baptism of the
[43:27] Holy Ghost. And the people then how the
[43:30] church did not move up and those who
[43:33] were moving refused to walk in light and
[43:35] went back. See, and the plague was open.
[43:40] That screen's not on. If I could get
[43:41] that on, please. And the plague was
[43:43] opened at that time and poured out upon
[43:47] the earth which was influenza.
[43:50] Now, there's a swine flu epidemic. See,
[43:53] that happened in 1918, right at right at
[43:55] right at the end of the war. All right,
[43:58] watch. Which was influenza that killed
[44:00] all the people as it did the thousands
[44:02] times thousands.
[44:05] All right. Now, so he's he's identifying
[44:09] modern events made clear that we have
[44:13] arrived where John was told that this is
[44:17] the time of all things.
[44:19] Amen.
[44:20] The time of all things is at hand. And
[44:23] John stood there at the end 2,000 years
[44:25] in advance standing at the end looking
[44:27] at it take place.
[44:29] And he's trying to worship a a human
[44:31] prophet. He's hearing the final voice to
[44:33] the final age. He's hearing behold I
[44:35] come quickly. He's hearing it's the time
[44:37] of all things. And what John was hearing
[44:39] and seeing and experiencing. You you not
[44:42] it's not that you have just come to it.
[44:45] It's that you are it.
[44:48] You are that bride he was seeing. You
[44:51] are that voice he was hearing.
[44:53] Hallelujah.
[44:54] Amen.
[44:56] Thank you.
[44:57] See,
[44:58] so he he he moves on here. All right,
[45:01] let me keep up with myself. All right,
[45:05] so now he comes here to the uniting sign
[45:09] and time shortly after the seals.
[45:12] Uniting sign in time.
[45:15] All right. What did he say in Malachi 4
[45:18] would restore? restore back the original
[45:20] Pentecostal faith back to the people.
[45:23] Love this quote. I love it. Love it.
[45:24] Love it. Listen, here's what's been
[45:27] restored. You ready? The original
[45:30] Pentecostal faith. Now, we're not
[45:32] talking about Isuza. Isuza is a small
[45:35] piece of it.
[45:37] Isuza is a piece of it just like
[45:39] justification and sanctification.
[45:41] Brother Brandham said the age didn't
[45:43] seem to have the power and that as
[45:44] Leodysia dawned, it did. The church
[45:46] didn't have the power it really needed
[45:47] to have. So God restores power, adds in
[45:50] some more fuel and and restores the
[45:52] gifts of the spirit to that are and but
[45:54] then it took a prophet like Paul after
[45:56] the gifts hit the church, then Paul's
[45:59] got to come along and set it all in
[46:00] order cuz everybody was running and
[46:02] everybody had a tongue and everybody had
[46:04] a prophecy.
[46:05] Say, why are they doing that? Cuz that's
[46:06] what happened on the day of Pentecost.
[46:07] Woo! We got it.
[46:09] And but but but as Pentecostal babies,
[46:12] they couldn't handle it. And it took
[46:13] Paul to divide it and set it and place
[46:16] it in order. Amen.
[46:17] Amen.
[46:19] And and Isuza pours out and you get a
[46:21] bunch of Pentecostal babies. But it took
[46:23] Elijah to come here and set the thing in
[46:25] order
[46:26] and show how the gifts operate.
[46:29] Amen.
[46:30] And they do operate.
[46:32] And they ought to operate.
[46:34] I'm here to tell you they ought to
[46:36] operate.
[46:37] And we have gifted people in this
[46:39] assembly.
[46:40] I you know, Sister Jean, who we all miss
[46:42] so terribly, I wish she would be home
[46:44] yesterday. Sister Jean has has the gift
[46:47] of both uh prophecy and interpretation.
[46:50] And I've heard it on multiple occasions
[46:52] and be spot on and come with a with a
[46:56] with an interpretation that's such
[46:58] fluent German uh it would impress sister
[47:00] Katherine and brother Anton because her
[47:03] she doesn't know a word. She barely
[47:04] knows English.
[47:06] But suddenly she's speaking fluent
[47:07] German.
[47:09] Sorry, Mom.
[47:13] And I've heard it and it's been true and
[47:15] it's been accurate and it exposed sin
[47:17] and it's happened multiple times. We
[47:20] have those things operating here. We
[47:21] have gifts of dreams in this church. We
[47:23] have gifts of interpretation. We have
[47:25] gifts of wisdom operating here. And we
[47:27] believe in those things.
[47:29] Hallelujah. I'd like to see it. I'd like
[47:31] to see it with more confidence.
[47:33] I'd like to see this is the time of all
[47:35] things when all of the not just the
[47:38] gifts of the spirit, but the fruits of
[47:40] the spirit. Amen.
[47:42] Hallelujah.
[47:43] Amen.
[47:43] With an understanding of the word and
[47:45] bring it all. I'm I'm not interested if
[47:47] you can if you can speak in a in a in a
[47:50] in a in a tongue of men and angels, but
[47:53] if you don't have love, you're
[47:55] worthless.
[47:59] You can give your body to be burned, but
[48:02] if you don't have love, you are of no
[48:04] value.
[48:05] Hallelujah. Is that the scripture?
[48:09] Hallelujah. See, so he says here, what
[48:14] is it? It's back to the people with this
[48:18] is what's in our day. The same
[48:19] Pentecostal message, the same
[48:22] Pentecostal sign, the same Pentecostal
[48:25] evidence, the same God,
[48:28] the same power,
[48:31] the same teaching,
[48:34] everything. Everything.
[48:36] Everything.
[48:38] See, look at it again. The same
[48:41] Pentecost, the same Pentecostal message,
[48:43] the same sign, the same evidence, the
[48:46] same God, the same power, the same
[48:48] teaching, everything exactly with the
[48:50] vindication of the same pillar of fire
[48:52] that struck down Saul on the road to
[48:54] Damascus is among us today. Doing the
[48:58] same things he did in that day. What was
[49:01] he doing? Uniting.
[49:04] This is a uniting time. and sign. The
[49:09] power of the risen Christ is among us.
[49:12] This is the time of all things.
[49:16] Oh, it ought to fill us with courage,
[49:18] friends. It ought to fill us with joy
[49:20] today to realize I'm not waiting. It's
[49:22] not a pie in the sky. It's not somewhere
[49:24] of a rainbow. It's happening.
[49:28] Amen.
[49:29] It's happening all around us.
[49:31] Thank you, Jesus.
[49:33] So, he says, why watch now in paradox?
[49:36] He goes on 1965.
[49:40] See, let me let me just make some
[49:42] comments before I jump to that one.
[49:45] So, we have entered into a time
[49:47] prophetically
[49:49] that is called the time of all things.
[49:54] A ll.
[49:56] This is the consummation
[50:01] of all the ages. Amen.
[50:04] This is all the sevens. Sevens are
[50:06] completion. This is all the sevens. The
[50:10] seven age, seventh age, seventh seal,
[50:13] seventh trumpet, seventh vial.
[50:16] Hallelujah. You believe it?
[50:19] And the seventh messenger, the the
[50:21] seventh the seventh time that the bride
[50:24] and now she's back to the first time.
[50:26] The Alpha and the Omega are now in in in
[50:29] lock step and with the same Pentecostal
[50:32] sign and the same Pentecostal power and
[50:35] the same Pentecostal teaching and the
[50:37] same Pentecostal God.
[50:39] Amen.
[50:40] See,
[50:42] so we've come to the perfection. Let me
[50:45] say like this. We've reached the perfect
[50:46] perfection.
[50:48] Rather redundant, but we've reached the
[50:50] perfect perfection, the full
[50:53] consumation. Got to say it like this and
[50:55] I'm going to deal with that term
[50:56] consummation because brother Brandham
[50:58] uses it about 90 times.
[51:01] This is the time of the full
[51:02] consummation
[51:04] of the entire plan
[51:08] and everything that's been being lived
[51:10] out peace meal and step by step age by
[51:14] age you have arrived at the
[51:16] conglomeration of it all. This is the
[51:19] consummation of everything.
[51:23] Watch paradox 1965. Why do we have to
[51:26] accept organizations and so forth that
[51:30] will write off of the book? See, it
[51:34] becomes a thorn in the flesh. And here
[51:37] at the end time, we meet the thing again
[51:41] face to face. My what a quote. We meet
[51:43] the thing again face to face. It's up to
[51:47] Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, and
[51:49] what more?
[51:50] You you can't go on. You've got to come
[51:54] back. Look at this language to the
[51:57] entire full gospel.
[52:00] It was made all of this. It was made for
[52:03] the full man
[52:05] by a complete God who was made man who
[52:08] was made flesh and dwelt among us. So
[52:11] whatever version, whatever version of
[52:14] the gospel you choose, it is to bring
[52:17] you to the full returned image of the
[52:21] prototype.
[52:23] Whatever version you want to say is
[52:25] true, I only got one thing I need to
[52:28] know. Does it restore you back to the
[52:31] prototype? Are are you living like
[52:34] Christ? Is that power? Is that
[52:36] sincerity? Is that love? Is that life in
[52:39] your life? Amen.
[52:41] See,
[52:43] because it's supposed to reproduce his
[52:45] life in every way. The same dedication,
[52:48] the same faith, the same power. Listen,
[52:51] friends, this goes for message ranks as
[52:53] well.
[52:54] Amen.
[52:55] This isn't just Methodist, Baptist,
[52:57] Presbyterian, and Catholic. This goes to
[52:59] message ranks as well.
[53:02] Whatever version of the message you want
[53:04] to say is true, I just want to know,
[53:06] does it restore you to the prototype?
[53:09] Does it bring you back to the beginning
[53:11] of the creation of God? And your life is
[53:14] a continuation of that same creation.
[53:18] So, I've got quotes and scriptures. I
[53:20] don't care how many quotes and
[53:21] scriptures you've got. I want to know
[53:23] does the life match?
[53:25] [Applause]
[53:26] Hallelujah.
[53:31] So, he says here, he goes on in u modern
[53:34] events made clear.
[53:37] Now he's going to come to a scripture
[53:40] that Jesus refers to and I think uh I
[53:43] believe St. John 14. Except you eat the
[53:46] flesh of the son of man, drink his
[53:47] blood. Brother Brandham comes to it here
[53:49] and he he quotes it. Except you eat the
[53:51] flesh of the son of man and drink his
[53:53] blood you have no life in you. So now
[53:57] remember that that you've got three
[53:59] categories. You've got the iniquitous
[54:02] church that is cast in and cast into the
[54:05] tribulation and refused at the judgment
[54:08] bar. Remember they tried to get in on
[54:09] their works.
[54:10] Yeah.
[54:11] Try to say, "We preached in your name.
[54:13] We did all these mighty things in your
[54:14] name." And he'll say, "Depart from me,
[54:16] you workers of iniquity." See, because
[54:19] you knew your life didn't match. And
[54:22] you're trying to force me to let you in
[54:24] by doing works. And you know, you can't
[54:26] get saved that way. Yeah. Works.
[54:29] Salvation doesn't come from what you do.
[54:30] It comes to from what you surrender to.
[54:33] You can't save yourself. Only God can
[54:36] save you. And you've got to accept the
[54:38] word that was sent for that purpose.
[54:40] See? And so you've got the iniquitous
[54:42] church who are separated like goats. Uh
[54:46] and they accept neither the body nor the
[54:48] blood.
[54:49] Amen.
[54:51] Except you eat the flesh of the son of
[54:54] man and drink his blood. They reject the
[54:56] word and the life.
[54:58] Yeah. Amen.
[54:59] They don't have either of those.
[55:00] All right. The unwise virgin, they
[55:03] receive the body of the flesh. They
[55:05] received that day on Calvary.
[55:07] They absolutely know that's the son of
[55:09] God. And they from a sincere heart
[55:11] repent of their sins and put their faith
[55:13] in the atonement of what that day
[55:14] produced. They absolutely receive the
[55:16] flesh and the body. They receive the
[55:18] word as best they understand. But what
[55:21] are they missing? The blood. Cuz that's
[55:22] the life. That's the new birth. Amen.
[55:25] See, that's why it's a the message
[55:27] brought us a bleeding word.
[55:30] Because you have no access to the
[55:32] chemical blood of Jesus.
[55:35] You can't. Who's got that?
[55:37] You got it at home.
[55:38] Does the Vatican got it? Is it in
[55:40] Jerusalem somewhere? Brother Brandon
[55:42] said that chemistry ran down the cross
[55:44] and fell onto the earth and claimed the
[55:45] earth for God. Claimed the earth for the
[55:47] millennium.
[55:48] Just a little secret thing that nobody
[55:50] noticed. And God was watching that blood
[55:52] run down. Okay, it's mine now. It's mine
[55:54] now, Lucifer. It's mine now. I baptized
[55:57] it under Noah. I put my blood on it. My
[56:00] blood touched it. And now I'm going to
[56:02] sanctify it and I'm going to burn it
[56:04] with a fire because he said he's going
[56:05] to restore the earth the same way he
[56:07] restored you through the water and
[56:10] through the blood and through the fire
[56:12] and it's going to make a new heavens and
[56:14] a new earth.
[56:17] Hallelujah. That's how you come back to
[56:19] life.
[56:20] He's redeeming the earth the same way he
[56:23] redeemed you.
[56:25] As brother Bradam taught us in the
[56:26] future home.
[56:29] So if you want to be redeemed, you got
[56:31] to come the way the earth comes.
[56:34] Can I flip it on you?
[56:36] Flip the script. If you want to if you
[56:38] want to be redeemed, you got to go
[56:40] through the same process the earth's got
[56:42] to go through because you came out of
[56:43] the earth.
[56:44] See, you're not going to get a shortcut.
[56:46] You're not going to get an end around on
[56:49] on sanctification.
[56:51] You're not going to get an end around on
[56:53] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You're
[56:55] not going to get an end around on
[56:56] accepting the flesh, eating the flesh,
[56:59] and drinking the blood. See, you don't
[57:01] have access to that chemical blood. And
[57:03] but and so so then how do I get the
[57:05] blood? Cuz it's the blood that the the
[57:08] Bible says if we walk in the light as
[57:10] he's in the light, we have fellowship
[57:12] one with another. And the blood of Jesus
[57:14] cleanses us from all sin. But you don't
[57:16] have any access to that chemistry. But I
[57:19] do have access to it in this form.
[57:22] It is a bleeding word. Why is it a
[57:24] bleeding word? It's got life in it.
[57:26] Whose life is it? God's life. I'm eating
[57:28] on God's life. How does it give you
[57:31] life? Because I love it and I believe it
[57:33] and I surrender to it.
[57:36] It's not just education to me.
[57:38] Come on.
[57:39] It's not just knowledge.
[57:41] Amen. Yes, it is.
[57:43] See, so the unwise virgin received the
[57:46] body of the Lord enough for salvation
[57:48] from destruction.
[57:50] She has certainly accepted the Christ of
[57:52] the Bible for all she understands. And
[57:54] she lives a clean, sincere life before
[57:56] God. And they're judged to be righteous
[57:59] by the king. That's Matthew 25 if you
[58:01] want to go to read it. But she never got
[58:03] the life of the blood for a new birth.
[58:05] She's not born again. That's why she's
[58:06] there.
[58:08] Jesus promised us faithfully in the
[58:10] fifth chapter of John that if you've
[58:13] passed from death to life, you will
[58:14] never come into the condemnation. You'll
[58:17] never stand the judgment. You'll be
[58:18] seated on the throne with Christ. You
[58:20] know why? Cuz your sins went ahead of
[58:22] you and were met in Christ.
[58:24] Oh, some men's sins go before them and
[58:26] some men's sins follow them. Don't be
[58:28] don't leave this building today with
[58:31] your sins following you cuz they'll
[58:33] follow you all the way to the grave and
[58:35] they'll follow you all the way to the
[58:36] judgment and they'll catch up to you
[58:38] standing there and you don't want to be
[58:40] standing there when your judgments crash
[58:42] into you when your sins crash into you.
[58:45] Send them forward.
[58:48] Let them be met in Christ today.
[58:51] See,
[58:54] so she never got the life of the blood
[58:56] for a new birth. She couldn't come all
[58:58] the way in the word. She wasn't ordained
[59:00] to it. This is what separates us. This
[59:02] what separates the bride of Christ. See,
[59:05] so the bride of Christ, scripturally
[59:08] speaking, it is the it is the scriptural
[59:11] bride of Christ are the only segment of
[59:15] humanity that have received both the
[59:17] flesh and the blood. Except you eat the
[59:20] flesh and drink his blood, you have no
[59:23] life in you.
[59:25] Amen. no eternal life in you. See, so so
[59:29] we have believed the report. All right?
[59:32] So we have eternal life dwelling within
[59:34] us. Uh we have had a gene that has been
[59:38] activated by God placed in us when we
[59:40] were born into the world. We have
[59:41] believed the report.
[59:43] Amen.
[59:44] We have been washed by the water of the
[59:46] word.
[59:47] Four people.
[59:49] We have believed the report.
[59:51] We have been washed by the water of the
[59:53] word. We have been filled with the
[59:55] spirit.
[59:58] We don't Fred Mullins on you.
[1:00:02] We have been filled with the spirit.
[1:00:06] Hallelujah.
[1:00:08] Thank you.
[1:00:09] Amen.
[1:00:10] Amen.
[1:00:12] This group and this group alone are the
[1:00:14] gentile group of the last day that he
[1:00:15] promised this power to. These and these
[1:00:18] alone are the ones who know the fullness
[1:00:21] of their God and will do great exploits.
[1:00:23] As we studied on in our study yesterday
[1:00:25] in the men's Bible study breakfast, it's
[1:00:28] God doing the great exploits and he's
[1:00:30] going to do the great exploits through
[1:00:32] his family who know their God at the end
[1:00:35] time.
[1:00:38] This is the group. You are the group.
[1:00:41] You are the group uh defeating every
[1:00:43] devil.
[1:00:44] You need to say that about yourself. I
[1:00:47] don't care how how negative the devil
[1:00:49] wants to make you feel about you. You
[1:00:51] need to claim the word. I am the group
[1:00:54] that is putting every devil under my
[1:00:56] feet. I'm defeating every devil. I'm
[1:00:59] rising up in the perfection for a body
[1:01:01] change.
[1:01:04] Amen.
[1:01:05] It is this selected group who are
[1:01:08] entitled to the precious promises that
[1:01:10] Peter spoke of.
[1:01:12] That by these promises, these precious
[1:01:14] promises,
[1:01:16] you become partaker.
[1:01:18] You become a partaker.
[1:01:20] You actually get some of it. You don't
[1:01:22] just stare and look at it. You actually
[1:01:24] you're a joint air with God, but now
[1:01:26] you're you're you're an heir of God with
[1:01:29] a gene of God before you're born again.
[1:01:31] You're already an heir of God, but you
[1:01:32] differ with nothing from a servant
[1:01:34] because you're born in sin just like
[1:01:36] everybody.
[1:01:37] So you're an heir of God, but you have
[1:01:38] no allotment. But when you're born
[1:01:40] again, now you step up beside Jesus, and
[1:01:42] now you're a joint heir with Christ,
[1:01:44] reaching into the same treasure
[1:01:47] because he was the son. He was the
[1:01:49] elected son. I was in him. I'm an
[1:01:52] expression of him. Hallelujah.
[1:01:55] So, so we find then that he says here,
[1:01:59] we're at the end of denominations.
[1:02:02] Aren't you glad
[1:02:04] the wheat's taking shape, but what's the
[1:02:07] matter with the wheat now? I've been
[1:02:09] I've been preaching on this. What's the
[1:02:10] matter with the wheat now?
[1:02:12] Now, he's not talking about Pentecost
[1:02:15] anymore.
[1:02:16] Amen.
[1:02:17] He He's had a lot of pretty rough things
[1:02:19] to say about them.
[1:02:20] Oh, yeah. Amen.
[1:02:21] He's had a lot of rough things to say
[1:02:23] about what you Baptists have become. And
[1:02:25] he said, "I know cuz I used to be one of
[1:02:26] you."
[1:02:27] And he said, "You Pentecostals, and look
[1:02:28] what God has done to you, and look what
[1:02:30] you've become." And he and and and and
[1:02:33] you you Methodist. And he said, "You
[1:02:35] used to shake and shout under the power
[1:02:37] of God, and now you you call it a devil,
[1:02:41] and your your sanctification is gone."
[1:02:43] John Wesley' roll over in his grave if
[1:02:45] he was still in his grave,
[1:02:48] which he's not.
[1:02:51] But now he's not talking about them. Now
[1:02:54] he's coming to us.
[1:02:57] See, we're at the end of denominations.
[1:02:59] The wheat's taken shape. But what's the
[1:03:01] matter with the wheat now? It must lay
[1:03:04] in the presence of the sun to ripen
[1:03:08] before the combine comes before the
[1:03:10] combine picks it up.
[1:03:15] And so, you know, they I I grew up
[1:03:18] through that whole thing. grew up
[1:03:20] through this message. Grew up at the
[1:03:21] tabernacle, grew up among the family
[1:03:23] members, know them all, friends with
[1:03:25] them all for years, watched it happen,
[1:03:27] watched this camp rise up, and this camp
[1:03:29] rise up. And this camp told us what we
[1:03:30] could believe and what we couldn't. And
[1:03:32] this camp told us what we believe and
[1:03:33] what we couldn't. And and our we were
[1:03:35] all coraled and and it was all it done
[1:03:38] was do the very thing the opposite of
[1:03:39] what brother Brandham said when that
[1:03:41] when that pyramid was the top was torn
[1:03:43] off and brother Brandham said, "Now stay
[1:03:45] and look on this." And he said, "And I
[1:03:47] went away west." And he said, he said,
[1:03:49] "And one went this way and one went that
[1:03:51] way and one went this way, but a very
[1:03:53] few stayed and did what I told them to
[1:03:55] do. Stay and look on this open word
[1:03:57] because what's coming is going to blow
[1:03:59] your mind." And they all ran with this
[1:04:02] and they ran with that and they good
[1:04:04] men. Uh and and and in every case,
[1:04:06] barring none, in every case, they ran
[1:04:08] with partial truth.
[1:04:10] And then the enemy gets in it and next
[1:04:12] thing you know, you got super preachers
[1:04:13] and super doctrines and super camps and
[1:04:15] super this. And brother Brandham warned
[1:04:17] us not to be chase supers.
[1:04:19] And he warned us in the seventh seal,
[1:04:21] don't make yourself odd. Just be a
[1:04:23] humble Christian.
[1:04:24] When God's got ready, he'll she'll
[1:04:26] reveal it. And I It's not about an angel
[1:04:28] coming down to whisper it in your ear.
[1:04:30] It's about happening in your life. When
[1:04:32] God is ready, it'll happen.
[1:04:36] You'll know it cuz you'll be it.
[1:04:40] See, and but but we didn't do that. And
[1:04:44] then and then I grew up through the
[1:04:46] counterrevolution,
[1:04:47] you know, then the counterrevolution
[1:04:49] rises up and oh, we got to go back to
[1:04:51] emotionalism and I watched them and I
[1:04:54] watched preachers come in and jump up on
[1:04:56] the pull pit and and dance on top of it
[1:04:58] and dance on tables and break chairs and
[1:05:00] run the aisles and fall off and break
[1:05:02] their legs. And I watched young people
[1:05:05] who were told, "You got to come up here
[1:05:06] and have an emotion." And I was one of
[1:05:08] them. And we were weeping and crying and
[1:05:10] snotting and blubbering. And there was a
[1:05:12] few who got the real thing, but the
[1:05:14] majority left all of that and went right
[1:05:16] back to the world.
[1:05:18] Say, "How do you know that?" I was one
[1:05:20] of them.
[1:05:21] Amen.
[1:05:23] That that large group, my wife and I
[1:05:25] grew up in that large group, probably
[1:05:27] 20ome young people. My wife and I to
[1:05:30] today, with the exception, well, in and
[1:05:32] actually in our group, we're the only
[1:05:35] ones
[1:05:36] Yeah.
[1:05:37] that are serving the Lord.
[1:05:38] Amen.
[1:05:40] fervently at this level.
[1:05:42] Amen.
[1:05:43] And and I watched them and I and I
[1:05:45] watched I watched women shake and shout
[1:05:48] and run and hair come down and spin
[1:05:50] around and speak in tongues. I watched
[1:05:51] men run all over the place.
[1:05:54] And you say, "Was it a bad thing?" No,
[1:05:56] it was fine. It was a good thing. I'm
[1:05:57] not I'm not opposed to that.
[1:06:00] Amen.
[1:06:01] Don't get me wrong. I'm not opposed to
[1:06:03] that. Good grief. Bethl Tabernacle,
[1:06:06] you're my witness. I jump up and down. I
[1:06:08] scream and holler, turn red, wave my
[1:06:10] arm, spit to the fifth row. I believe in
[1:06:13] emotion. I don't think anything's dead
[1:06:15] or to go and be buried.
[1:06:18] I tell you what, if you're feeling down
[1:06:20] today, shake Brother Jack's hand. You
[1:06:22] won't feel down in in about 30 seconds.
[1:06:24] I'm here to tell you, this thing's real
[1:06:27] and I believe it has life in it.
[1:06:31] I'm only pointing to what men tried to
[1:06:34] do
[1:06:36] and man with good motives and good
[1:06:37] objectives. And here's my message.
[1:06:39] Looking back at almost 60 years old and
[1:06:42] born and raised in it my whole life.
[1:06:43] Here's my message. You never needed to
[1:06:46] do that.
[1:06:48] You never needed to do that.
[1:06:50] All you ever needed to do was what a
[1:06:52] prophet said. stay here in the presence
[1:06:56] of the sun and be ripened and that'll
[1:06:58] turn you into the living word. You never
[1:07:02] had to try to run ahead and make it
[1:07:04] happen. You can't make it happen. You
[1:07:06] can't force God into in to run ahead of
[1:07:09] himself. And neither can you slow him
[1:07:11] down.
[1:07:13] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[1:07:14] We have arrived at the hour of all
[1:07:16] things, the time of all things, the day
[1:07:19] of all things. And I'm not looking for
[1:07:21] another super camp or another counter
[1:07:23] revival. I'm not looking for any
[1:07:25] revival. I'm looking for the coming of
[1:07:27] the Lord.
[1:07:30] Say, you're not looking for another
[1:07:31] revival. No, the next revival goes to
[1:07:33] Israel.
[1:07:34] Say, what about your revival? I'm in it
[1:07:37] right now. I'm in it right now. It's
[1:07:40] happening.
[1:07:42] [Applause]
[1:07:45] There's not another rain coming. If
[1:07:47] another rain comes on wheat that's in
[1:07:49] that's mature, it ruins the crop.
[1:07:52] Oh, hallelujah. There's another revival
[1:07:54] coming under Moses and Elijah. But I'm
[1:07:56] looking for the coming of the Lord.
[1:08:00] Hallelujah.
[1:08:03] That's right.
[1:08:06] I hate that clock.
[1:08:21] So, Brother Benham says,
[1:08:24] "So, so so we realize friends,
[1:08:28] and boy, nobody better go
[1:08:31] out of here and say, "Brother Jason is
[1:08:34] against emotion
[1:08:36] or brother Jason's against deep
[1:08:37] teaching." Goodness, gravy train. I love
[1:08:41] it all.
[1:08:43] Yeah. I don't see how anybody could
[1:08:44] accuse me of that.
[1:08:46] Why? No.
[1:08:49] No. Nothing happening. There's times I
[1:08:52] feel like blowing up through the roof.
[1:08:53] Like brother Eddie said, I want to blow
[1:08:54] through the roof and land out in the
[1:08:55] road.
[1:08:56] Run them down the road screaming like a
[1:08:58] maniac. Afraid they put me in jail. I
[1:09:00] believe in the power of God. I want you
[1:09:02] to believe in it.
[1:09:03] I believe in the freedom of the spirit.
[1:09:05] I want you to believe in it.
[1:09:06] I believe in the teaching. I believe in
[1:09:08] the correct teaching and understanding
[1:09:10] of the deep mysteries of God. They give
[1:09:12] me stimulation
[1:09:14] by revelation.
[1:09:18] I'm just simply telling you what I
[1:09:19] observed in history growing up in this
[1:09:21] message.
[1:09:22] Amen.
[1:09:23] Good men on both sides.
[1:09:26] The re the the doctrinal revolution and
[1:09:29] the counterrevolution of emotion. Good
[1:09:32] men, sincere men, good people. God.
[1:09:35] People were born again under those
[1:09:37] movements.
[1:09:38] People were born again under those
[1:09:39] movements.
[1:09:40] You understand? That's not my point.
[1:09:43] My point is you didn't need to chase
[1:09:46] that.
[1:09:47] You didn't need to go running after
[1:09:48] that. You didn't need to do it then. You
[1:09:52] don't need to do it now.
[1:09:54] The the what the bride needs is to lay
[1:09:56] in the presence of the sun.
[1:09:59] You say, "How long we got to lay there?
[1:10:01] Till my body changes.
[1:10:04] Yes. Amen.
[1:10:06] Amen.
[1:10:06] Say, "We've been laying there a long
[1:10:07] time." Yeah. And I'm way further down
[1:10:09] the road now. I know a lot more, believe
[1:10:10] a lot more, and have had a lot more
[1:10:12] experience. And I'm more I'm more
[1:10:14] convinced today than I've ever been.
[1:10:16] Why? Because I've dedicated myself to
[1:10:18] laying in the presence of the sen.
[1:10:21] Amen.
[1:10:23] See?
[1:10:23] Hallelujah.
[1:10:26] And so, Brother Brandham says here,
[1:10:30] "If you give me 15 minutes, I'll only
[1:10:32] take 20."
[1:10:34] Okay.
[1:10:36] Brother Brandham says,
[1:10:39] "Gabe, they know I they know I normally
[1:10:41] quit by now, so this is unusual." Amen.
[1:10:44] So, uh, you good, brother Anton? Oh, no.
[1:10:46] I know you're good. Yeah. Praise the
[1:10:48] Lord.
[1:10:50] So, so brother Brandham says here in the
[1:10:53] Philadelphiaian age,
[1:10:57] oh, I'm just skipping so much you can't
[1:10:58] imagine.
[1:11:00] The question would perhaps arise. Now,
[1:11:02] the question he's talking about is if
[1:11:04] you go read in the Philadelphia age and
[1:11:07] it's it's starting to forecast the end
[1:11:10] time and it's this this language of
[1:11:12] urgency and it's like, oh my goodness,
[1:11:15] things are really starting to get tight.
[1:11:16] And brother Brandon picks it up here.
[1:11:18] question would perhaps arise.
[1:11:20] Is there another age beyond this? If if
[1:11:24] there is another age beyond this one,
[1:11:26] why the urgency? Good grief, you're only
[1:11:28] in age six. Got a whole another age. Why
[1:11:31] the urgency? See, the answer lies
[1:11:35] herein. The last age will be a short
[1:11:38] one, a quick work of consummation.
[1:11:42] Amen. One of the 90 plus times brother
[1:11:44] Brandham uses this term.
[1:11:47] It would be a quick work of
[1:11:51] consummation.
[1:11:53] Now
[1:11:56] take take that down Jeremiah. I'm I'm
[1:11:58] that's just going to keep slowing me
[1:11:59] down. I want to I want to come and
[1:12:02] finish.
[1:12:05] So we have to ripen. See,
[1:12:09] it's all about ripening
[1:12:12] to have these promises in full
[1:12:13] operation.
[1:12:15] You say, "Do you want, Brother Jason,
[1:12:18] more of the supernatural power and the
[1:12:20] signs and wonders and the gifts?"
[1:12:22] Absolutely. But if you don't ripen,
[1:12:25] you'll mess it up.
[1:12:26] That's right.
[1:12:27] See,
[1:12:29] we need to be ripened into the so that
[1:12:32] we can have the full title of Mrs. Jesus
[1:12:34] Christ.
[1:12:35] Amen.
[1:12:36] So you're you're and I said this I said
[1:12:39] this I can't remember if I've said it
[1:12:40] here. I've been preaching on the road a
[1:12:41] lot. But I I said it I've said maybe
[1:12:44] I've said it here. It bears worth bears
[1:12:47] repeating that you're never going to be.
[1:12:49] You say I'm the final voice to the final
[1:12:51] age. Okay fine. I got a gene of God.
[1:12:53] Great. Wonderful. So do I.
[1:12:55] I love it. I'm glad. That's not I'm
[1:12:59] going to make a point though to you. I
[1:13:00] want you I want you to This is just
[1:13:01] Brother Jason asking you to think about
[1:13:03] it.
[1:13:04] Okay. You're you're the final voice.
[1:13:06] That's your elected position. You got
[1:13:09] all the tools. You've got a gene of God.
[1:13:11] You got a message of the hour. You got a
[1:13:12] prophet. You got an anointing. You got
[1:13:13] the end of all things. You got the
[1:13:15] restoration of all the gifts and the
[1:13:17] restoration of all the spirits.
[1:13:18] Amen.
[1:13:19] All the spirits of Christ. All the gifts
[1:13:21] of Christ. All the power of Pentecost.
[1:13:23] All the original signs, all the original
[1:13:25] teaching, all of the original, all of
[1:13:26] it.
[1:13:27] Amen.
[1:13:27] You've got everything. There's nothing
[1:13:29] God has left you short of.
[1:13:31] That's right.
[1:13:33] But you're never going to be an
[1:13:35] effective final voice
[1:13:37] without this maturing
[1:13:39] that comes from spending your days in
[1:13:44] the presence of the
[1:13:45] sen.
[1:13:47] Amen.
[1:13:49] Say it again. You're never going to be a
[1:13:51] very effective final voice to the final
[1:13:55] age without this maturity that comes
[1:13:58] from spending your everyday life near
[1:14:01] the sun.
[1:14:02] Hallelujah.
[1:14:04] Amen.
[1:14:05] No matter, hear me, Bethl Tabernacle.
[1:14:09] No matter how intellectually sound you
[1:14:13] understand the deep teachings of the
[1:14:15] word,
[1:14:17] no matter what kind of emotional
[1:14:20] experience you've had, I'd like to have
[1:14:22] them all,
[1:14:23] but no matter what kind you've had, even
[1:14:27] even the true outpouring of the real
[1:14:32] blessing of the Holy Ghost,
[1:14:35] without your willingness to lay aside
[1:14:38] the world and all of its carnal affairs
[1:14:42] to keep yourself constantly renewed
[1:14:45] daily in fellowship and all through each
[1:14:48] day. You you're if you don't do that,
[1:14:51] then your effectiveness to operate the
[1:14:55] power of the kingdom like the saints in
[1:14:58] the book of Acts, it will be
[1:15:00] proportionately hindered
[1:15:03] and muted.
[1:15:05] Amen.
[1:15:06] That's my message to you.
[1:15:08] It doesn't matter. We have the the best
[1:15:11] teaching far and wide.
[1:15:14] We have the best anointing preacher
[1:15:16] team. My goodness, you're talking about
[1:15:19] a ministry team extraordinaire.
[1:15:21] Bethl Tabernacle, you are blessed of
[1:15:23] God.
[1:15:24] It leaves me astonished at the quality
[1:15:27] of ministry. Even our brothers, even
[1:15:29] some of our young men who are just
[1:15:30] starting out already in the third pole
[1:15:32] ministry already dividing, rightly
[1:15:35] dividing aunder. Hallelujah. the power
[1:15:38] of God moving behind it. I'm learning
[1:15:40] things listening to them.
[1:15:41] Amen.
[1:15:43] Have all of that. But unless unless
[1:15:46] you're constantly renewed daily in
[1:15:48] fellowship all through each day, your
[1:15:50] effectiveness to operate power of this
[1:15:53] restored power of this kingdom to do
[1:15:56] that like the saints in the book of
[1:15:57] Acts, you're going to be hindered. Your
[1:16:00] your your final voice is going to be
[1:16:02] muted. And I'm here to tell you
[1:16:04] something, friends. This is the time of
[1:16:06] all things. It's no time to have your
[1:16:08] arrows of deliverance blunted by the
[1:16:11] devil.
[1:16:12] You don't need your testimony muted in
[1:16:15] front of your children. Let me tell you
[1:16:16] something, Dad. Let me tell you
[1:16:18] something, Mom. You don't need your
[1:16:19] arrows of deliverance blunted.
[1:16:22] You don't need They need to be razor
[1:16:24] sharp.
[1:16:26] Hallelujah. That your family needs
[1:16:28] arrows of deliverance.
[1:16:31] Oh my. Come on, my ministering brethren.
[1:16:33] We can't have our arrows blunted by
[1:16:36] Leodysa. Your arrows are arrows of
[1:16:38] deliverance. They got to be fired true.
[1:16:42] Hallelujah. They got to be shot with
[1:16:44] deep sincerity. They must pierce the
[1:16:46] heart of the enemy.
[1:16:48] Amen.
[1:16:49] And put him down.
[1:16:53] Put him down.
[1:16:56] Your arrows need to be sharp. Your aim
[1:16:58] needs to be true. Your sincerity needs
[1:17:01] to be deep. Your dedication before God
[1:17:05] and your lifestyle needs to be so
[1:17:07] sincere before God. There's no muting of
[1:17:10] your testimony. There's no blunting of
[1:17:11] your arrows. There's no none of that.
[1:17:14] It's a sharp arrow of deliverance. It's
[1:17:17] got to drive to the heart of the enemy
[1:17:19] for our young people, for our marriages,
[1:17:21] for our ministry team. We got to see the
[1:17:23] devil put down.
[1:17:26] I want to tell you today, put him down
[1:17:28] today. Put him down in your marriage.
[1:17:31] Put him down in your home. Put him down.
[1:17:33] Don't let him stay alive.
[1:17:36] You have arrived at the time of all
[1:17:39] things.
[1:17:42] Let's stand. You warriors of the faith.
[1:17:46] This is the hour of all things.
[1:17:50] This is the time
[1:17:52] when no when every spirit
[1:17:55] must be taken under your control
[1:17:58] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:18:02] glory of God. How many want that today?
[1:18:06] Say Lord God sharpen my arrows. You want
[1:18:09] to wave a hand to him today. Sharpen my
[1:18:10] skills Lord increase my eyesight. Give
[1:18:14] me more dur end endurance. Lord God help
[1:18:16] me to be strong. Let my target, let me
[1:18:19] fire true. Let me shoot true. I don't
[1:18:22] want to I don't want to miss the target.
[1:18:24] My children are too valuable. My
[1:18:26] grandchildren are too valuable. Your
[1:18:27] children are too valuable. Your
[1:18:29] grandchildren too valuable. My marriage
[1:18:31] is too valuable. Yours is too valuable.
[1:18:33] This church is too valuable. We got to
[1:18:36] aim correctly. We got to fire.
[1:18:40] Without hesitation,
[1:18:42] the enemy needs to be put down.
[1:18:46] put down.
[1:18:48] You shouldn't have to fire four or five
[1:18:49] arrows. You shouldn't need four or five
[1:18:51] sermons. You shouldn't need a five night
[1:18:54] revival meeting. You should take this
[1:18:56] one arrow of deliverance today and slay
[1:18:58] him in your home and slay him in your
[1:19:01] life and say, "I'm done with carnality.
[1:19:03] I'm done with Leoa. I'm going to lay in
[1:19:06] the presence of the sen daily. I'm going
[1:19:08] to have a fellowship daily, hourly."
[1:19:12] Sure. Sure. You're going to work a job.
[1:19:14] Sure, you're going to go to school.
[1:19:16] Sure, you're going to pay bills. You're
[1:19:18] going to take vacations. You're going to
[1:19:19] have recreation. You're going to all
[1:19:21] we're going to have the functions of
[1:19:23] living. But every hour, I'm going to do
[1:19:25] all of those things under the sunlight,
[1:19:27] under the presence of the soom in my
[1:19:30] life. And everywhere I go and everything
[1:19:32] I do and whatever I'm doing is going to
[1:19:35] bring honor to him.
[1:19:38] Oh, this is the desire of my heart,
[1:19:40] friends, to see the power of God moving
[1:19:44] correctly,
[1:19:46] in balance, in maturity, in fullness.
[1:19:52] Hallelujah.
[1:19:54] Father, we love you today.
[1:19:56] We love you today with a great love,
[1:19:58] Lord.
[1:20:00] We worship you today. We surrender to
[1:20:02] you fresh today,
[1:20:04] Lord. There's not a day goes by it
[1:20:07] doesn't matter how surrendered I feel
[1:20:10] when morning's early light comes. I go
[1:20:12] to bed. I close my eyes and the the
[1:20:16] darkness the night takes me and I I I
[1:20:19] drift off thanking you.
[1:20:23] Thanking you.
[1:20:25] Thanking you, Lord, for your love, for
[1:20:28] overlooking all of my mistakes and for
[1:20:30] caring enough about me to send me your
[1:20:33] word. Oh, and I wake every morning with
[1:20:36] the sense that yesterday is gone. Now
[1:20:39] today I need more. Today I need more
[1:20:42] than I had yesterday. Cuz now the day is
[1:20:44] more evil than it was only 24 hours
[1:20:47] previous.
[1:20:49] Help us today. Lord, let this message
[1:20:52] today go near and far. It It seems to be
[1:20:55] the It seems to just have been such an
[1:20:58] arrow of deliverance for me to study it
[1:21:00] and to preach it here today. I feel so
[1:21:03] satisfied in my spirit. It's what I've
[1:21:05] been struggling and trying to come to in
[1:21:07] sermon after sermon after sermon,
[1:21:09] preaching them here, preaching them away
[1:21:11] in other assemblies. I come back here
[1:21:13] today and it just seems to crystallize
[1:21:15] in front of me. Oh, we love you for
[1:21:17] that. Lord, help us today. Oh God, there
[1:21:22] is no doubt in this church where we
[1:21:24] stand on the power of God. There's no
[1:21:26] doubt where we stand on the on the full
[1:21:28] Pentecost. We're not well. There's no
[1:21:30] doubt where we stand on the pillar of
[1:21:32] fire in our midst. There's no doubt
[1:21:34] where we stand on our perfect faith in a
[1:21:37] perfect operation of perfect gifts in a
[1:21:39] perfect Christ, a perfect spirits of
[1:21:41] Christ, perfect gifts of Christ. We
[1:21:44] absolutely endorse them, love them,
[1:21:48] operate them, believe in them, spread
[1:21:50] the news near and far. We believe, Lord,
[1:21:53] to that we need to rightly divide the
[1:21:56] word.
[1:21:57] We believe that we're not here for
[1:21:59] conflict only with the devil. I'm here
[1:22:02] to put the devil under my feet. Lord, we
[1:22:05] love your servants from yester year.
[1:22:07] Many of them gone on now. They they drew
[1:22:10] aside camps. They had good hearts, Lord.
[1:22:12] Many of them, the certainly the
[1:22:15] majority, there's always unbelievers and
[1:22:17] make believers, but the majority of
[1:22:19] those men on both sides of that, Lord, I
[1:22:21] grew up watching their lives. I know
[1:22:23] they were sincere. I know that they were
[1:22:25] only trying to hasten the day. I know
[1:22:27] that. I I I acknowledge that. I was
[1:22:29] there. I was a young man watching it all
[1:22:32] around me.
[1:22:35] I've seen it all over the world. I've
[1:22:37] I've traveled the world. You've blessed
[1:22:38] me. I've I've took this message to all
[1:22:41] the continents of the world, save one.
[1:22:45] And a host of countries I could name.
[1:22:47] and believers in jungles and believers
[1:22:49] in mountains and believers in in poverty
[1:22:53] and believers setting pretty and and and
[1:22:56] in uh and in uh uh developed countries
[1:23:00] and and underdeveloped countries and
[1:23:02] first world countries and third world
[1:23:04] countries, red, yellow, black and white.
[1:23:06] I've ministered among them all.
[1:23:11] And we've been here, Lord, far longer
[1:23:14] than we thought we would be.
[1:23:15] Amen.
[1:23:17] But here we are.
[1:23:19] So I say, "All righty then, then I'm
[1:23:22] going to press the battle."
[1:23:24] And we love, we love what has happened.
[1:23:27] We love how you've guided this bride.
[1:23:29] Yeah, sure. She was an infant bride. She
[1:23:32] stumbled and toddled and fell over a
[1:23:33] bunch of times. We did. It's true.
[1:23:37] There's things that came up out of the
[1:23:38] late 60s, the 70s, the 80s, the 90s into
[1:23:41] the into the 21st century. I don't think
[1:23:43] we can be proud of everything that the
[1:23:45] bride has supposedly stood for. But one
[1:23:47] thing I know, the Lord, the the word of
[1:23:50] God has this seal, the Lord knoweth them
[1:23:52] that are his.
[1:23:54] Hallelujah.
[1:23:55] And let everyone who names the name of
[1:23:57] Christ depart from evil. And that's been
[1:24:00] my motto, Lord, my whole life. I want to
[1:24:03] depart from evil. That's the thing. I
[1:24:05] want to be into you. I want to I want to
[1:24:07] be filled with your spirit. I want to be
[1:24:09] an overcomer.
[1:24:12] And we stand here today. I'm not about
[1:24:14] to go back. By no means. I've laid in
[1:24:17] the sun too long. I'm not coming back
[1:24:20] here to chase supers. My goodness. I'm
[1:24:22] way more grown up than that. I saw the
[1:24:24] folly of that. I'm not here to chase
[1:24:27] countercultures and chase
[1:24:28] intellectualism or chase emotionalism. I
[1:24:31] didn't have to do it then. I don't have
[1:24:33] to do it now.
[1:24:34] What I have to do is be daily
[1:24:36] surrendered to you every minute, every
[1:24:38] hour. you will live through us as you
[1:24:41] choose.
[1:24:43] We thank you, Lord. I thank you for a
[1:24:45] church that's alive.
[1:24:47] I thank you for these people. Lord, I've
[1:24:50] preached to many of them for decades
[1:24:53] now. Some of them less than that, but
[1:24:56] right away, Lord, as believers, they
[1:24:58] they immediately come in and they
[1:25:00] immediately catch up. It's shocking how
[1:25:02] fast they jump into the rhythm of Bethl
[1:25:04] Tabernacle. We're a church that believes
[1:25:07] in the divine power of God. We believe
[1:25:10] in a living word. We believe in
[1:25:12] discernment of spirit. We believe in
[1:25:14] rightly dividing the word of God. We
[1:25:16] believe in the power of the risen
[1:25:18] Christ.
[1:25:19] We've seen the the sick healed
[1:25:22] incurably. We've seen young people
[1:25:24] filled with the Holy Ghost and it's
[1:25:25] still happening. I've laid my hands on
[1:25:28] the blinded eyes and seen them come
[1:25:30] open. We've cast out devils. Lord, we've
[1:25:32] set people deliverance, not touching
[1:25:35] them at all, just preaching to them. And
[1:25:37] while I yet spake these words, the Holy
[1:25:40] Ghost fell on them.
[1:25:42] We see and believe and long for more of
[1:25:44] the book of Acts.
[1:25:47] But we also know that that book of Acts
[1:25:49] was more than just signs and wonders.
[1:25:52] That book of Acts identified and
[1:25:54] separated law from grace. That book of
[1:25:56] Acts identified false anointed ones.
[1:25:58] That book of Acts served an indictment
[1:26:00] on the age.
[1:26:02] We believe all of it, Lord. And I thank
[1:26:05] you for it. I thank you for this
[1:26:08] assembly. I thank you that when I come
[1:26:10] out here, not just me, Lord. When these
[1:26:12] ministers, they come out here and stand
[1:26:14] in this desk, the anointing falls on
[1:26:17] them, I sit astonished at the things I
[1:26:19] hear. This church, Lord, hears the word
[1:26:22] of God preached under a great anointing.
[1:26:25] What a privilege we have. How great you
[1:26:28] are to us. What a heavenly father you
[1:26:30] are.
[1:26:31] Oh, lamb of God. We pray for people and
[1:26:33] they're healed.
[1:26:35] We preach to people, they get delivered.
[1:26:38] Hallelujah. We spread the gospel around
[1:26:40] the world. We do missionary work. We
[1:26:42] missionary our own hometown. We
[1:26:44] missionary right in America and abroad.
[1:26:49] I say all that, Lord,
[1:26:52] to say because I want to I want to name
[1:26:54] it all because I want you to I want to
[1:26:57] have it named what all I love you for.
[1:27:01] I love you for these things. I love you
[1:27:05] for these things. How in the world I
[1:27:08] stand in the position I do, Lord, as the
[1:27:10] spiritual head of it all, it astonishes
[1:27:12] me, Lord. I I How in the world you
[1:27:16] haven't kicked me to the curb years ago,
[1:27:19] oh, reaping so much better than I ever
[1:27:21] sowed, but yet it's the love of God. How
[1:27:24] can I explain it? I can't explain it.
[1:27:27] All I know is I want to strive harder.
[1:27:29] Hallelujah. I want to sing on that shore
[1:27:32] someday, Lord. Someday I'll stand there.
[1:27:35] I'll sing on that beautiful shore.
[1:27:39] Hallelujah.
[1:27:40] We love you for that today. Help us one
[1:27:42] and all. Lord, bless us now mightily as
[1:27:45] we sing and worship you. Lift up praises
[1:27:47] to you for the word that we've heard
[1:27:49] today. I pray that your your arrows of
[1:27:52] deliverance would continue to anoint
[1:27:54] rain down Lord and water the seed of the
[1:27:57] word that has been placed in our hearts
[1:27:59] today. We commit it to you in Jesus
[1:28:02] name. Amen. Let's sing Brother Anthony.
[1:28:05] God is good
[1:28:08] all the time.
[1:28:10] [Music]
[1:28:12] Put a song of praise in this heart of
[1:28:17] mine. God is good
[1:28:22] all the time.
[1:28:24] All the time.
[1:28:25] Through the dark
[1:28:27] night,
[1:28:28] his light will shine. God is good.
[1:28:35] God is good
[1:28:37] all the time.
[1:28:38] All the time.
[1:28:40] Come on now. Sing it. If you're walking
[1:28:45] through the valley

[1:32:40] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:32:43] Don't you love him?
[1:32:46] Oh, I love him with a pure love. My
[1:32:48] goodness, we're unworthy of him, but I
[1:32:50] sure love him.
[1:32:52] My friend, what a privileged people we
[1:32:54] are. You've received the whole council
[1:32:56] of God. Live in it. Rejoice in it. Have
[1:33:00] victory in it. This is the time of all
[1:33:02] things. Don't let the devil hold you
[1:33:04] back from anything. Why would you take a
[1:33:07] substitute from Leodysia for your
[1:33:10] happiness and your joy? Why would you
[1:33:12] take a substitute that's going to go
[1:33:14] down in ash and cinder? This whole world
[1:33:17] is going to ash and cinder.
[1:33:19] There's nothing you're going to acquire
[1:33:21] here that's going to survive. The only
[1:33:22] thing you're going to take with you is
[1:33:24] your character.
[1:33:26] Brother says, "Death changes nothing.
[1:33:29] Whatever you are, when that when the
[1:33:31] Lord calls your name, pulls your card,
[1:33:34] that's what you are. I tell you
[1:33:35] something, friends. I figured that out
[1:33:37] years ago. And I I decided I decided I
[1:33:40] didn't want to be me anymore. I wanted
[1:33:41] to be him.
[1:33:43] I knew he lived in heaven. And if I
[1:33:45] wanted to be there, I just have to have
[1:33:46] his life. Amen. You love him.
[1:33:50] Turn around and shake hands with
[1:33:52] somebody. Greet him in the wonderful
[1:33:54] name of the Lord. We're going to let you
[1:33:55] go and be dismissed. Brother Anthony
[1:33:57] will sing you happy. You can stay here
[1:33:58] and clap and sing and Amen. And uh and
[1:34:02] enjoy the Lord. I want you to make sure
[1:34:03] you make our visitors welcome. Uh
[1:34:05] especially brother Anton, our visitor
[1:34:07] from Lithuania.
[1:34:09] It's hard to describe how Sister Debbie
[1:34:10] and I feel about Brother Anton. He's a
[1:34:12] dear, dear, dear friend. And he was in
[1:34:16] our home 15 years ago with brother
[1:34:17] Nikolai. And and uh my goodness, he's
[1:34:20] been a faithful, loyal friend and loyal
[1:34:24] to Christ all these years through thick
[1:34:26] and thin, through good and bad. Satan's
[1:34:29] fought him and buffeted him like he has
[1:34:30] me and you. But you know what? Like me,
[1:34:33] like you, he's still standing.
[1:34:35] I'm still standing. You're still
[1:34:37] standing.
[1:34:38] Don't you love that?
[1:34:40] Doesn't matter what the devil has been
[1:34:41] able to do. I'm still a believer.
[1:34:45] Amen. Let's bow our heads and I'll
[1:34:46] dismiss you in prayer. Father, we love
[1:34:49] you today. We thank you for your word.
[1:34:50] Thank you for these people. Bless our
[1:34:52] visitors, Lord, and those streaming.
[1:34:54] Father, we commit all of these words
[1:34:56] into your hands now as the people go.
[1:34:58] May the love of God go with them. May
[1:35:00] the Holy Spirit, even in days to come,
[1:35:04] may you bring back to their remembrance
[1:35:06] the things they heard here in the Sunday
[1:35:09] school class today and in the regular
[1:35:12] main service. May they remember it,
[1:35:14] Lord. And may the Holy Spirit bring it
[1:35:16] back to their remembrance. And do it,
[1:35:19] Lord. Would you do it in a way that it
[1:35:21] becomes a living experience to them?
[1:35:23] That it's not just something they
[1:35:25] remember. Oh, like a aha moment. No, but
[1:35:28] an actual living experience.
[1:35:31] May that's how it's a revelation. It
[1:35:34] becomes a living experience. May you
[1:35:37] grant it to him, Lord. We commit it to
[1:35:38] you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:35:41] God bless you, friends. Been wonderful
[1:35:43] to preach to you today. Sorry I uh I uh
[1:35:47] preached more like Matt and went long,
[1:35:48] but
[1:35:50] I'm just kidding. The whole team's been
[1:35:52] working on him to get him to But you
[1:35:55] know, sometimes brother Matt's got so
[1:35:56] much to say.
[1:35:58] And so I come buckled up every time.
[1:36:00] Praise the Lord. Amen. I'm just going on
[1:36:02] with my son a little bit. I wouldn't say
[1:36:04] that to the other. Well, I might, but
[1:36:07] but I love the family of God. Amen. And
[1:36:10] I sure appreciate what God has done.
[1:36:12] Appreciate what he's doing in all your
[1:36:14] lives. Amen. God bless. You can be
[1:36:15] dismissed in Jesus name.
