========================================

foreign everyone God bless you Let's uh let's stand and read the scripture continuing on the subject of seven women take hold of one man we're going to look at Isaiah 4 is one and two and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel let's pray Heavenly Father we want to dedicate this time to you Lord and For Your Glory we ask that your Holy Spirit would come and take your word and make it alive in our hearts father we we just commit ourselves to you commit the Sunday school and the service to You For Your Glory we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you can be seated so I'm not gonna take the extra time to go into this we've done that in the first three times so um skipping past that we read Proverbs 31 um to finish and made some few comments about that and I'm not going to read it again but I'm just going to bring some bullet points forward from this and I think you know this is the virtuous woman that the Bible is speaking about it's giving it's giving a a picture of her character her attitude and her approach towards her family um and it isn't it isn't necessarily to say Hey you gotta I mean run all kinds of small businesses out of your home and this things but but but the idea is the character that goes behind all of this and the attitude that's behind all of it that goats goes towards the family young men this is who you should be looking for in a spouse young ladies this is what you should be preparing yourself for you know people that are that are uh you know in different stages of life and you're experiencing salvation maybe in your 20s or 30s young ladies this is what the Holy Spirit wants to shape you and mold you into right and and there's so much more but this is this is obviously the picture of in relation to your family to your children to your husband so The Virtuous Woman She's trustworthy it says she seeks wool and flax in other words she's she's planning and providing uh for the future she willingly works with her hands she plans ahead and provides a variety of foods for her household she Rises early in the morning to prepare a meal for the family she works along with her husband to exp expand the household business says she considers a field buys it plants plants a Vineyard she inspects the things her household is producing and will do what it takes to make sure that it is quality she works on providing clothing for her family she has a heart to provide for the poor she doesn't fear the various seasons of life because she makes Provisions for them and she trusts God God through them she prospers from hard work and so does her family her husband is honored because of her she not only supplies for the needs of her family she makes additional materials and sells them she's strong strong and honorable woman she is wise and kind she is not idle or lazy her focus is not on outward Beauty and charm but on the character produced by the fear of the Lord now you read that and go that's very intimidating again the point is not that you need to do follow all these points exactly if you if you did God bless you the point is the character and the attitude and the heart that is behind each of these things that that character and that heart towards your family that's what God wants to shape into a Godly lady so looking at this and you say well the times were very different when we're talking about the Proverbs 31 Woman they were the society was different the culture was different correct it was that's then that's the point that's why I'm trying to say the point I'm making is it's about the character that's behind each of these points it's a proverb right it's a proverb so it's it's it's painting a picture for you of what wisdom and godliness looks like I mean you you can go to the scriptures in Proverbs and you can see one verse answer a fool according to his folly next verse answer not a fool according to his folly you say that's a direct contradiction the Bible is contradicting itself no no it's a proverb and it's it's showing that there are circumstances where you don't answer a fool according to his folly and there are circumstances that you should right because it's speaking about character and there's thousands of different circumstances and situations where these things can can line up and the same thing goes for when we're looking at The Virtuous women there's lots of different circumstances but the characteristics of the woman that come from these basic premises are there as principles for us to follow and to go through so cultures do change but the word of God does not change and the character of Christ does not change you know we started out you know most the majority of history is agrarian societies divided into land owners and lower classes that's basically what the world was up until the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s before before the Industrial Revolution the husbands and wives roles were clear obvious Undisputed you know today's day and age uh if we suddenly were forced back into we have to survive no one's going around saying I think I'm a woman well I think I'm a man because they're not they're not worried about such nonsense they're worried about simply I am this I must survive I have I have to do these things I need a man's help the man says I need a woman's help right there's there's no there's no need to have disputes about this now in Upper classes if you look at upper classes in in throughout Europe and and the culture that they had within the the aristocracy what was it all kinds of perversion all kinds of sexual perversions happening why because again the roles were only forced on them because all they did was live off the work of other people right they lived off the work of the other people and what their land could produce so the roles were were used and were there because of what Society looked at Judea judeo-christian values nevertheless they had all kinds of perversion there because of that very reason is they sat lazy on the rear ends other people working for them right and so that's what almost everybody all of us are doing that very few people work with their hands in today's society the majority in America the majority of society has a easy lazy job and whether you're a man or woman hardly matters so and that's say that was Satan's goal and intention with all of these things science civilization and education of this world are all of the devil now that doesn't mean we shouldn't seek and pursue wisdom from from the Bible and from the message of the hour that doesn't mean we shouldn't learn how to be engineers and learn how to and be the very best construction workers and engineers and photographers and etc etc and seek to improve ourselves that way that doesn't mean that but there is a system in this world and it should be so clear in brother branham's day you could say it was in seed form and everybody's going brother Branham what's the big deal about education and Science and civilization well now it's so clear it slaps across the face every day you wake up out of bed you know most universities are simply places to put forward and high schools and elementary schools and middle schools and Junior High and it's just a place to put forward prop communist perverted propaganda into young people's minds to pervert and twist their minds into the world's goals and and direction that's that's very clear civilization our our government and all that goes into the government's control on the world you know this is easy to get on a rant so Lord protect me the government same thing it's all together of the devil and it's seeking to put forward Satan's Eden and push forward Satan's even science is the same thing we don't even know what science is we're just supposed to trust it now science is mostly just like the oldest profession in the world now is whoever is the highest bidder that's what the results you'll you'll put forward it's not questioning things and coming to con and testing it and coming to conclusion no don't do that if you do that we'll cancel you and we'll say you're a dangerous conspiracy theorist that's what the world is they don't even and so science civilization education are clearly following Satan's program and pattern in order to combat what God is doing on the earth see that's that's what the devil's doing he's not he's not just randomly throwing something out he knows that God was going to combat his program with a bride that wouldn't fail with a bride that's going not going to fall like Eve fell he knew because he can he can read the scriptures and he knows them as well as we do probably better he could see that there's going to be a bride without spot and wrinkles so what does he do hundreds of years before that's going to come he starts a process he doesn't know exactly when it's going to come so he starts a process and what is that process oh he's going to give an industrial revolution you say oh that helped many things and that that uh that made life much better for everybody well it's the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it's not God's perfect will it's not the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil I'm sorry y'all is not God's perfect will it's God's permissive will and what does it bring it doesn't bring life it brings More Death these are principles you've heard brother Branham say this for years and years I'm just trying to to spend some time on bringing it out and really showing it where where it comes out in history so then you know we have the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s birth of industry and the birth of the middle class you say that's a wonderful thing more people experience Prosperity more people experience a good life what is a good life what is prosperity you say you're you're defining it from outward terms you're defining it from the terms that the world would look at it as and that's not God's vision and that's not God's purpose so the birth of Industry the birth of the middle middle class rules start out clear and they get muddier and muddier for example what what when industry was born do you think the the industrialists were concerned about Labor conditions how many people had their jaw eaten away from them because of mercury poisoning their bones eaten away and what did did it make the industrialists quit doing that no not until all the governments of the world said hey everybody's dying stop you have to stop you have to you can't do that anymore and it and and that's the that's the reality is the industrialists their purpose was money and it was gain and so their purpose was not to help the world or improve the world their their desire was gained and so you can go on and on and on and on about all the poisons and things that were put into into the world and what happened was they put women in in the working in the plants and they put little tiny children working in the plants was that good for the home life was that good for home life no no it was not good for home life it was horrible and you see the proliferation around the world of little children on the streets during this time period little kids no Mom and Dad dad's dad well they might have a mom and dad dad's drunk and mom's working all the time dad comes home and when when dad comes home he beats the Daylights out of all of them and this you can read about this history around the world this is the result of the Industrial Revolution horrible then next we go to the age of mass production the the lines are further blurred we go into World War II World War One and the times proceeded in World War one man goes off to war a woman has to take take his place at the plant what happens there well this goes off into another subject but what does woman do she puts on pants Hollywood comes about at this same time she puts on makeup she Bobs her hair because her hair is going to get caught in the machinery all these things was this God's plan and purpose was this what God wanted to accomplish in the world no the very time that he's going to call a bride and set all these things in order right before that the Devil comes on the scene and raises up a World War One to do what to degrade the woman you say it killed all these men it was it was a very purposeful attack on Womanhood this is what was happening from the very beginning it was attack on the family and it was attack on what it means to be a woman now we've reached its Zenith they don't know what a woman is they won't say what a woman is and if you do you're dangerous that's in this civilization that's in this science that's in this education it's Satan's Eden it's reached a Zenith I don't I don't foresee of a way that it can go further and go worse except for into making pedophile legal that's the only step that's left then we get after the age of mass production the digital Revolution now the lines are what lines are there there's no lines anymore it's a total perversion total Destruction annihilation of the society and the the values of the Christian and Jewish faith so then we have the three waves of feminism so first wave is promotion of equal contract and property rights for women and the opposition to chattel marriage and ownership of married women and their children by their husbands however by the end of the 19th century activism flipped it changed its focus primarily on gaining political power particularly the right of women's suffrage and you can go into this and you can argue make an argument and I don't want to get dragged down on this and say some of these things were good some of these things were bad we know what brother Branham says about women's right to vote we used to get a little bit uh worried when we would say that and and Flinch a little bit because we think what is everybody going to think I think we can now really see what brother Barham said this is the end result in our country of making uh pure democracy where anybody can vote men can vote women can vote this country was founded it was supposed to be the head of a household that owned property could vote right then what did it become anybody can vote and when when you get a pure democracy what's the result is chaos utter chaos it's always been that way France is a little bit ahead of us look what France is resulting in it won't be long that we're we'll be in the same nonsense situation liberal democracy that's the worst form of government in many ways and so again I'm getting I'm going out I'm trying not to go too far off but you see I believe brother branham's point is exactly right the woman gets the vote and it brings it to a place in our country not that women are unintelligent that's not what's being said that's the opposite of what's being said it's it's talking about God's program this can we can go on and on about this topic from a logical scriptural standpoint Etc I'm just going to leave it there second wave of feminism is women's Liberation challenging the cultural and legal validity of the patriarchy and social and sexual hierarchies used to control and limit the legal and physical independence of women in society again what what is what is happening here is it's pushing against God's word you know you say it you just go out and yell patriarchy in the public and my goodness everybody's gonna lose their minds but it's exactly the right way it's exactly the scriptural way man is the head Adam was formed first then Eve right God's original intention though they were co-equal they had two different purposes Man was created to be a leader to take the hits to love to serve to provide the woman was created to be an influencer and a helper in this Vision in this process that God has the third wave of feminism is freedom of sexual and bodily expression fighting sexual harassment and continued expression of women's rights by dismantling any gender roles whatsoever yep that's the purpose egalitarianism they wanted everything right there men and women are exactly the same we see the absurdity when we got these men going into women's sports and their horrible athletes I've repeated this every time I think I've spoke but on this they're horrible athletes and they go to these Elite women athletes and guess what happens they demolish them easily why because man is stronger woman is a weaker vessel it doesn't say she's a dumber vessel so she's a weaker vessel her bodily she's weaker it's that's obvious to anyone with common sense but this is what this is the result and the process and the program that Satan had when he started his feminism when he started the changing of society and the development of technology that was his goal let's banish all gender roles and all we can go into how how this is impacted on the church so here's the reality men and equal men and women are equal but they're not the same and they don't have the same role what men and women are different as at the cellular level every cell is marked as either male or female men have denser bones larger hands greater muscle mass men tend to be more aggressive and as a result have a greater tendency to be attracted to conflict and competition and thus leadership women tend to be attracted to nurture nurturing and relationship building then tend to compartmentalize women tend to connect manner wired to lead women are wired to nurture and I would say influence First Corinthians 6 9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind so here we see this term effeminate culture has been feminized the portrait of man is self-centered dopes led by wise powerful women painted by Hollywood the deadening of Manliness from video game addiction watching being addicted to watching sports and the proliferation of estrogens in food water and clothing all these things have led to the feminization of our culture brother Branham says there's a perversion in the food supply see where am I at I think I can get through this but it's gonna I'm gonna have to go fast brother Jason mentioned it and I thought man he's he's going into my material already for Sunday school last week he said did you read this this is from uh and knoweth it not did you read this here this month's Readers Digest that men and women of this day little girls from 20 25 years old is in menopause that you go through the change of life in the middle age of life according to science between 20 and 25 it used to be around 30 or 35 in my age in my mother's age a woman never struck menopause still she was 40 or 45 what is it it's through science and the food and the hybrids it's perverted the whole human body totally become a bunch of a massive corruption well if the physical being corrupted isn't the brain cell in that physical being hmm and in thirst he says but the way they are on the street today haircut like a man wearing men's clothes and then men turn around wearing women's clothes and a haircut like a woman see it's a perversion the whole thing your food is perverted your life is perverted your thirst perverted your desire is perverted it's a day of perversion so this is just one thing there's many things brother Brandon mentions vitamins and minerals I'm just going to mention this because it's direct to me it's directly connected to this topic estrogen is everywhere soy is a plant estrogen so it isn't every snack so he's in baby formula soy is in vegetable oil it's in in vegetable oils in every snack it seems like it's in meat and dairy Productions it's in tap water in bottled water BPA it's the same thing it's in Plastics phthalates and lotion makeup laundry Products plastic wrap birth control pills are in our water supply when when there's excess estrogen testosterone is suppressed so think about that when suppressed from Young ages of development it leads to the feminization of boys I hate talking about this with a doctor in front of me [Laughter] but it is this is absolutely the truth what you whether you how old you are how young you are whatever you are when when you consume too much estrogen your testosterone levels immediately are going to lower do you think this is a mistake do you think that the devil didn't know what he was doing over the past 50 years human sperm counts appear to have fallen by more than 50 percent around the globe according to an updated review of medical literature it brings an increased risk of breast and cervical cancer weight gain fibroids in the uterus fatigue Etc in large breasts in men high blood pressure blood clots all these things it's it's it's absolutely a perversion and this this is an attack I mean look at what the Satan has attacked he's attacked the civilization at the very courtroom at the very very Foundation he's attacked education at the very Foundation he's attacked science at the very Foundation he's attacked the food supply at the very foundation and he's put the most powerful government on the on the planet in control of most of the food supply and the rules of food it's no wonder that when I go overseas on a mission strip and start eating fast food or anything and I immediately start to feel better fast food Popeyes I can't eat Popeyes here but I go overseas and I can eat it because I I have it I have all kinds of different allergies when I and they are all inflamed when I eat Popeyes here but when I go over there no problem I mean I get fatter when I eat Popeyes but it'll make me sick you see what I'm saying so this this perversion in all of these different areas that the devil has placed there is for this purpose is to attack the home and he knows if he destroys Womanhood he destroys the whole thing if a woman goes out and she's immodest and she dresss immodestly and a man's just gonna follow along this nonsense if you don't have the Holy Ghost and he's going to go along and what's going to be what's going to results be well I don't want to speak too plain but but the reality is it's going to destroy the home and there's not even going to be a home left my brother teaches in a public school almost all the kids have broken homes almost all the kids he says it's a wonder that they can even show up to class let alone get a good grade and there's no control he can't he my bro my brother is in a fairly I'm sure he's not listening but he's a it can be an intimidating person he cannot control one of them kids that's the society this is what they're being trained to this is what they're raised up in my brother is 6'2 and he's a Stern person and not one of those kids will listen to a word that he says he just has to take roll call the entire class and that's not just his school that's many many teachers and many many places if they can just be alive by the end of the day they're happy they can't teach kids aren't learning you go on and you you you ask in studies they don't even know who America was fighting in World War II they don't even know who Adolf Hitler was in fact they don't even know who the president is many times or the LA the the last president or you think what planet are you on what why would you think they could learn anything in this situation the one thing that they learn is the perversion of this world that's all that they know they can tell you there's no such thing as gender and etc etc and you can choose whatever you want why because that's what they're pumped with everywhere then they're pumped with the the the filth and the food supply which takes them towards feminization and all of these perversions in this world but but guess what the end end story is that God is is going to have a bride and through all this mess she's going to be perfected the church through the through the perversion of the church world you see the perversion of this world it's also reflected in the perversion of the denominational programs and systems of this world it's exactly reflected in what what is it conservativism what is what is being a conservative it's called just being a little bit behind the Liberals and that's what our churches are that's what our denominational systems and programs are they're just a little bit behind the liberal churches that have totally embraced perversions let's stand I hate to bring it out on the negative side like this but I think it's important to understand that besides all this he's perfecting a bride
