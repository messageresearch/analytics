praise [Music] jesus we are standing in his presence on holy grounds [Music] amen man so thankful for his presence amen so thankful for that he's alive amen we just came through some meetings that would testify to that and we're certainly feasting still on the things that were spoken things that were said and the things that we heard and then i trust that you are i've went back i think twice and listened to uh or went back to two separate times and listened to this archives and were even more blessed by them the second time i heard them so we're thankful for brother aaron i trust that god this restores his strength they're back home now in phoenix and that'd be all the music thank you god bless you i want you to turn to philippians chapter one if you have your bible amen philippians chapter one just have some announcements that we want to to read or to say before we begin um one thing is is that we've had a lot of requests for water uh we don't have really a vestibule lord willing and the remodel will have that but we don't really have a place for that right now and so uh we've we've put it out front here for tonight just for our own local assembly um to be able to have i know many times i've seen people raid the back office and break into the pastor's office there's still a water from the refrigerator and if they don't do that they go into the fellowship poll and i've seen people go up to walgreens and you're thirsty and so we get that so we want to try to meet that need so tonight the water table is there out front but that's just for tonight only going forward it will be under the pavilion so that same water table that you see out there we're going to have we can't promise that it'll be there every single service but at the time but we're going to do our best to get you some refreshments um and some water out there now let me just say this this is important that that's a trial that we're gonna try to run and the hesitation to do that is children little children making constant trips in and out of the church now that they know there's a water table there so the we're going to try it if it turns into more traffic and more people leaving the service during the preaching and during the singing and after service it's going to get nixed it's going to be canceled but uh so just do your best to just refresh yourself before you come in here if you absolutely have to leave and go out then you'll know where that's at and so yeah i think that was all for that brother joe good to see you sister becky your entire family here god bless you to the how to shells amen and we're missing a lot of people here tonight glad to see some uh some new faces but i think everyone might have thought church got cancelled again uh since the meetings that we had but we're in church we're in service so we miss you amen come back to service amen uh we also have uh we also have an announcement let me just say this that we're desperately trying to raise money for our uh youth group and it's specifically the senior youth we've got a lot of a lot of burdens and ideas and a vision that we're trying to accomplish even these meetings that we just had was really just a fruit of that burden that we've had to do something for the young people we have ideas that take them on trips into different meetings and different camps uh and we we've even have a trip that's planned um for july to byc and there's a lot of kids a lot of the young people that are registered to go to that and so we have a great need in our church we have a lot of young people and a great need and i don't believe that as i've said it and i just agree with it so much the youth is not the church of tomorrow they're the church of today and so we it's a it's a good thing to invest in and to give to i can tell you that the youth fund mostly stays depleted without anything um without any money in it very little offerings there are some who contribute very little up to this point has been given to it and so a lot of the expense just uh is paid um you know and and we just do our best to come up with you know a meeting like even this meeting that we just had last weekend i can just tell you that was thousands and thousands in excess of five to seven thousand dollars or probably more than that i don't have the exact figure just to run that meeting that we had and it was not paid for by the by the registration that was the little bitty 15 that we were charging and we allowed for donations and we're grateful for those donations that came in it helped uh offset some of the cost but it by no means covered the cost the offerings we took up by no means covered the cost and we don't i don't say that to complain in any way i just say that so that you know and you're aware those of you online that aren't here that are streaming those of you present you know when you give towards the youth fund we can i can promise you when you give towards that youth fund 100 of it goes into the bethel youth account that we have we have a separate account and it goes strictly to uh to meetings camps youth functions and i promise you our young people appreciate it so much and lives have been changed by the efforts that uh parents have got behind and and and uh i'm not in any way this is no in no way to make an appeal um to for money but just to say that just keep that in mind and remember that that there's a lot that we want to do to uh with the young people but we're limited to what we can do there's been meetings it's happened twice or we just couldn't there was not the money it wasn't there we couldn't go so our ch our kids didn't have a way to go and maybe some of them traveled individually and parents got behind that but we'd like to do things as a group we'd like to take a ve just our most upcoming meeting that we're having our upcoming trip is to byc we'd like to rent a 15 passenger van to take them we'd like to um you got gas with that you got the vehicle rental you got the expenses for those volunteers that'll travel and so um there's a lot that we're uh that we're wanting to do and we have some good ideas we want to stay proactive and uh to be able to raise money for the senior youth to be able to get together not just always we don't just plan things always for meetings or bible studies but we've planned some fun things just for them to get together i can promise you it's essential that your youth function and fellowship one with another it's who they've got and if you don't feel that social friendship connection with believers they'll fill it somewhere else and so we want to do everything we can the bible says that you know to have fellowship one with another though we say it all the time it's good to be with people of like precious faith and that couldn't be truer and more urgent and important than with our young people can i get an amen from the youth thanks guys i'm up here for you and so uh so we'll be we're gonna be doing uh some things to try to raise uh money myself my wife brother jason demar sister amy who work with the senior youth directly um are gonna start we've started we're gonna start doing something we're gonna start stalking snacks and drinks in the fellowship poll i want to make sure get this right for concessions to raise money for the senior youth we will be working out the details of what we're going to be getting and the prices this week but it will be there on sunday to purchase and so um it's a there will be no one there monitoring the concessions there will be a box there for you there'll be i think we have some iced coffees and snacks and drinks and different things there'll be no one there monitoring that taking your money we'll have a box there so scout's honor right make sure you do things above board we believe we're the body of christ and we don't do anything dishonestly so just make sure if you take something you give to it let me say let me encourage you to give above the the amount that we're charging there was a brother a young brother a a youth that visited our meetings and we were selling coffees that we purchased at the park we did that that helps offset some more cost and uh we were charging uh three or four dollars for the iced coffee and a brother came up and said i wanna i want a nice coffee and here's a hundred dollar bill to pay for it and that was a that was a way for a young person and i promise you that young person will be blessed for his effort and for what he did so give above above and beyond lord lay something special in your heart um to give to the youth then we'd encourage you to do that there'll be nobody like i said monitoring that so it's just on a just trusting a trust basis um you can pay what we're asking yeah there will be a way i think also um i think we're gonna do something so that we can accept cash app and vinmo or whatever paypal or whatever you want to use i think we're going to do that not positive yet but there will definitely be a way for you to pay with cash for those drinks and every all of the proceeds that we get from that will go to the youth account and it will be spent for youth functions to take them on trips to camps uh and things in our mo and as i said um i just don't believe we could do enough and we could ever labor tire ourselves enough for the next generation his brother aaron mcgarry said if we could accomplish anything it would be to propel them further than we've ever gone amen it says that even on your passport if you ever open up u.s passport it talks about that the responsibility of this generation is is the preceding generation is to further the next generation and our interest is not socially or monetarily or educationally those are all good but our interest is to further your children in the kingdom of god amen we all feel that way as parents amen praise the lord i think that's all that we had so again that will be ready uh for uh for you on sunday so you can uh you can purchase that there all right let's turn to our bibles philippians chapter one i would like to minister to you just on a third part gonna carry this uh being changed what we spoke on in two parts we're going to continue that now let's just begin reading here at verse 13. we're going to read in philippians uh let's begin with verse 12. but i would you should understand brethren that the things which happen unto me have fallen out he says the things which have happened unto me fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel so that my bonds in christ are manifest in all the palace and in all and in all other places and many of the brethren and the lord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife and some also of good will the one preached christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my bonds but the other of love knowing that i am set for the defense of the gospel what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretense or in truth christ is preached and i therein do rejoice yea and will rejoice for i know this is the scripture we want to key on for i know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer how important was the prayers of the saints to paul when he's in prison amen for i know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of jesus christ and the supply of the spirit of jesus christ lord we bow our heads now just before you lord we've waited on you and even lord to surrender in ourselves before we came out once again lord i raise my hands and invite anyone to do it with me to say lord i surrender my mind my body my soul my spirit i just surrender it now to your word lord i become subservient to this word this headship lord by your spirit lord i pray that you would take every spirit under your control now for the glory of god may your word go forth unhindered in the hearts of your children lord i pray god that you would speak what you want to speak lord and keep me from saying anything that you would want to be said we ask it now in the name of the lord jesus christ and the church said amen you can be seated jesus makes a statement and i've read this before and spoke an entire sermon on it it's the direction we're just going to go as we begin to speak about this thought here he makes this statement in matthew chapter 12 and i want you just to use if you could put it on the screen for me here and he begins to say this here in verse 5 of matthew chapter 12 or have you not read in the law how that on the sabbath day the priest and the temple profane the sabbath and are blameless but i say unto you that in this place is one greater than the temple it's amazing because when he uses this word temple this is a word that is uh extremely important and relevant to a jew it would be relevant then it would still have its relevance now when you say that word temple this is something that is very close to the jewish mind to the hebrew mind because it dates all and you say did it where did it come from well you see it didn't start in the hearts or the minds of jews but it actually started in the mind of god that even the lord would say i desire to have a temple a house a building a place where i can dwell somewhere where i can inhabit and so the word temple is very close to the heart and the mind of god and so he says here in the very in the book of exodus he tells moses uh i would i would that you would build me a house build me a temple a place that i can dwell a place that i can reside a home a dwelling place it's all the way in the book of corinthians and philippians and paul speaks about how that you are that your body know you not as the temple of the holy ghost it's the house or the habitation where the lord dwells even after when god comes and he and he's dwelling there in eden which we know was a place of an atmosphere prior to the fall the adam and eve experience and there's so much that is existing there uh in that perfect condition that doesn't exist in humanity today we heard ecclesiastes as brother aaron went through the current state of mankind and there there was there was attributes of the presence of god that they had every day that that was just automatic by default it was there so the atmosphere and the condition that they lived in in a perfection where there was the presence of god the air that they breathed wasn't polluted uh that the their minds were not polluted with the evil thoughts from an evil world because that eden was perfect it was a place where there was no fear that entered into the mind of adam or into the heart of adam or eve there was no anxiety there was no depression there was no uh hesitation there was no struggle it was just a perfect uh perfect place a perfect eden and we know that after from the very minute and i was even hearing brother aaron as he said that if you could just imagine if you could be in the body or the mind we can't we could only imagine but we can only imagine what it would be to be in the mind or the body of adam as when sin entered in and now all of these emotions and all of these feelings and all of this stress and all of this pain and sorrow that he never humanity had never experienced now they experience it for the first time had to be quite overwhelming to experience as the bible says he he even even the very first attribute of that fallen condition was fear because adam says i was afraid and so i hid myself this is something he had never experienced before to hide from the presence of the lord and now where there was a a magnetization to the presence and the atmosphere and the fellowship of god as brother branham says god would come down in the cool of the evening and fellowship now there was a detraction now there was a repelling now man is running from the presence of god and running from his creator and so god the one of the saddest scriptures in the bible is the bible says that so god drove out the man from the midst of the garden and he places at the entrance to cherubims with flaming swords to guard the way amen we know it wasn't to a geographical location that he's guarded it wasn't to a place somewhere over in africa and if we could just find where the first garden of eden was i'm sure that you know we would enter that atmosphere no it wasn't a it wasn't about a geographical location but it was about a condition of faith and a condition of the heart and the mind where there was perfection and there was there it was a condition of life and this is what god was guarding the way back to to that condition that adam and eve had in the beginning immediately after that the plan of redemption we know that all of this is according to the purpose of god all of this was predestinated as god says that that that god would it would necessitate that he would have to have someone who fell and someone who was fallen in sin to become a redeemer and to become a savior we know all of this it's all elementary to us but god immediately starts as he drives man from the garden and now he works towards his plan always moving towards something and if i don't get very far here tonight lord willing we'll pick it up on sunday so i'm not going to try to be in a hurry here as we got tonight and sunday to be able to express this but god's always his heart is always moving forward i want you to do this i know it's wednesday so i'm going to lay just some very simple principles not get too bogged down in teaching but just lay some simple principles that you could take and they would be an encouragement to you and you could you could just have them so i'm just gonna i'm just gonna lay some of this out in a very simplistic way and then we'll circle back to it but i want to say that one of the principles of god is that he's always moving forward he's never going backwards and he's never in neutral he's always moving forward and everything that you see all the way from the the order of the eden and then from the eden to the children of seth as the bible says they begin men became to call upon the name of the lord then through nimrod as we see destruction through babylon then it moved from there from the dispensation of kings and moves to prophets and and so all of those dispensations that go all the way through all the way to the advent of the first coming of christ remember god is always moving towards a vision he's always moving forward he's not making it up as he goes he's not up there just randomly as it comes at him and as as the challenges of the enemy comes and his man sort of does what they do than god is god let me say this god is not reactionary all right we're very reactionary kind of people we just react to something and then sometimes we have a good reaction and then other times we don't have so good of a reaction and we have to call and apologize and make it up god never does that he never has a sudden reaction but he's already pre-planned he's already premeditated he's already got a plan before the curse ever enters he's already has the entire course of mankind and the plan of redemption charted from the beginning all the way to the end amen amen can you say amen and so he's moving towards something his heart is always moving towards a vision always one plan brother branham and christ the mister of god revealed you can go and pick that up and i'm sure you're familiar with him saying this that he had a three-fold purpose and he was always moving towards that three-fold purpose that god would be manifested in christ and then christ will be manifested in a people and he's always moving towards that plan he's always moving towards a purpose he's he's not aimless as we said figuring this out he wrote the script before the story started he wrote the movie before it ever you ever push play and start watching it he's already written and dramatized and played it all out in his mind [Applause] this is just a rehearsal this brother digs that's what it is and and and this is the plan that god we call it the revelation of god in first corinthians chapter two it's called the hidden wisdom you remember the scripture he says we speak of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom of god and he says and if the princes of the world had known it they wouldn't have crucified the lord of the prince of glory the lord of glory but as as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have it entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god so within this hidden wisdom was the mystery of christ revealed within this his wisdom was the mystery of redemption which includes why he allowed the fall it includes why he allowed sin and sickness and disease and paul says had they understood that it was a plan then they wouldn't have crucified the lord of glory but god had hidden this this revelation from the mind of satan remember satan does not know everything amen he only knows what the lord allows him to know brother branham even said god's prophets don't know everything they only know what the lord would allow them to know and so satan doesn't understand everything so satan is as we said uh the the the satan follows prophets satan follows the manifestation of the word right amen so here's what god says now mannis became separated from god and god tells moses i want you to build me a tabernacle that i may dwell among them i want you to look in the first slide there as moses gets this vision from the lord and that moses god tells them god doesn't just tell moses hey moses i want you to build me a house and i i want you to build me a tabernacle and uh you know moses i i want it to be nice you know you know i want it to be i don't know you know i think i make it large moses you know i'm a big god and so you know make it make it beautiful moses i you know i dwell in beauty and you know just make sure it looks nice you got that first slide brother josh if you could display that uh he says make it look nice you know i i want you to you know moses i don't know make it make it holy because i'm holy and however you want to interpret what's holy you know moses just whatever you think i mean you know i trust you moses you're my prophet you know make it holy and make it pure because i'm pure and and well how big should it be well you know moses i don't we're however whatever you think you know god doesn't ask moses to build a house for him based upon moses ideas or his thoughts remember a prophet of god has no thought of his own he's a eunuch he has no seed of his own he has no thought of his own he's he's an interpreter he's a communicator of the divine thoughts of god he's a conduit he's a channel that speaks his voice becomes the voice of god i know we've said it many times and i'll say it again that means that when you reject the voice of isaiah you were not rejecting isaiah you were rejecting jehovah when you questioned the word of jeremiah and you blasphemed the word of jeremiah you were not blaspheming jeremiah you were blaspheming jehovah and so god says moses i want you to build a house and and i want you and he says i want you to not deviate so god shows him a vision and he says i want you to build it exactly as i've shown you don't deviate from it at all moses because this earthly house is going to be a representation of my purpose and my home in heaven and so he builds this first and there's many facets to this tabernacle the colors are specific the curtains are specific the size is specific the height is specific the type of stones that he's going to use are very specific let me say it this way god is specific [Music] hello god is not generic what he desires and what he wants and what makes him happy is very specific and what displeases him is very specific hello amen he tells us sir moses built it exactly as you've seen it you know engineered prince brother steve they're detailed they have details all over them when you go to bed a job you're you're looking at the engineered prince to make sure you don't miss a note you don't miss a detail but you you don't miss anything in the in the in the drawing you don't just make it up but you have a guideline that you're to follow and you're to follow it precisely to the teeth do you know why you're supposed to follow the engineer so that if anything goes wrong with the building you're not the one to blame but there's a man who has now put his stamp of approval oh hallelujah i hope you catch it here tonight there's a man who's now put his name and he's bonded his name and given an assurity that if this building fails you can blame the engineer oh and when god gave us the word it wasn't generic it was very specific and he put his own stamp on the word and said if you just build your house according to this then i'll take responsibility to whether it fails or succeeds and so he says build it exactly as i've seen it moses don't deviate from it it's going to be a house it's going to be a tabernacle and he says now notice here as we said god never moves backwards he always moves forwards this is god taking a step towards his ultimate vision it's god moving forward towards his ultimate plan his ultimate vision and he takes a step forward and he says i'll commune with thee from above the mercy seat i'll commune with thee from above so now communion has been restored now fellowship has been restored and god has got god says moses i want you to build it exactly as i've told you because this is going to serve a purpose it's moving towards something all the time god is changing god is moving god is developing god is building god is god is taking his plan and his program and he's implementing it exactly as he's drawn it out amen i'll commune with thee from above the mercy seat and you see this tabernacle and you see the outer cord and i love this picture all of the tribes of israel camped around but now in the middle of this place you have this dwelling place outer court inner court the holiest of holies and you see that great fire that pillar of fire that comes down inside of that holiest of holies and it fills the holiest of holies and in there you have the man and in there you have aaron's rod that buds under that presence of life what you have confined i want you to catch this what you have confined inside of the holiest of holies is the pillar of fire or the presence of god that permeated eden now is bottled up in one little room so what does that mean brother matt it meant all of the curtains and all of the diamonds and the barrel and the onyx and the sapphire and the carbuncle and all of the all of the beautiful gold and all of the curtains and all of the linen and everything that moses had did would have been for absolutely nothing right amen had god not tabernacled and put his approval by his presence coming down and filling that holiest place so god moves and takes another step we notice this here even then david's desires to build a house for god and solomon his son builds him a temple for the lord and i know we've shown these before i just want you to advance the sign it's a very great grand temple very similar to moses's tabernacle very similar but what is it it's a greater temple or a greater tabernacle or a greater expression of his plan than moses's tabernacle amen it's not greater in the sense of grandeur necessarily but it's greater because it moves closer and it furthers the plan that god had from the beginning so david solomon builds this tabernacle and we don't want to take the time to read it but he's moving towards something now remember solomon's tabernacle was great it was granulous it was beautiful to look upon but it was not the perfect fulfillment of god's plan it was only a step towards it hello you following it was only a step towards it it was only a signpost thank god for the signpost thank god for the for the signs but it wasn't the ultimate purpose that god had it was moving towards something it was moving towards a vision it was moving towards his purpose and every time god would bring a temple from moses to solomon and do away with the old the latter temple was always greater than the former amen remember the scripture that we read jesus is standing there and he says behold i say unto you there's one standing among you now that's greater than the temple so it's a greater in that it's not greater that it's larger it's not greater that it has more color or has more uh you know uh glitter or it glows better or it looks better it's not necessarily that at all but it's greater in that it's a greater progression the ladder the former the latter shall always be greater than the former and anytime god moves towards something it's always a greater expression of what's close closest to his heart he doesn't go backwards he doesn't even have the gear of reverse he can only go forward oh we could we could preach on that for the rest of the service here tonight we're thankful amen for all that god's sins uh let me say this to you there's there's great signs uh that we could even see right now you know we're on a progression we're on a journey you see brother matt where are we going back to are we going back to solomon's temple no we're going we're going before solomon's temple are we going back to moses's tabernacle no you got to go before that we're going all the way back to an eden condition where there's perfection and the air we breathe is the breath of the almighty god we're a people who's on our way back to it oh and let me say there's been great things god has sinned he sent us a prophet we're thankful for a prophet send us a message we're thankful for a message he sends signs and those signs are a signpost that we're getting closer we're getting closer but let me say this the sign is never the land the sign is never the destination it's only a sign pointing to the destination amen are you with me here tonight the sign always points us to the city but the sign is never the city amen amen amen amen we we watch things here the sign of sodom and we see the signs of luke 17 30 as it was in the days of of of lot and we see that fulfilled we've seen it fulfilled literally before our very eyes what is it brother matt it's a signpost amen it's a sign that's pointing towards something uh we see that the church is blind we see to russia you say what is russia russia's russia is not this listen this is in the fulfillment this isn't the finality it's just a sign pointing towards something that's why brother branham says watch russia we don't live our lives obsessed with russia we obsess ourselves on the promises of god's word [Applause] you say brother matt what is russia it's something i'm watching but my focus is right here [Applause] as part as the bible says abraham was salt he sees he was seeking a city whose builder and maker was god oh what is it even even the bride is a sign it's pointing towards something in fact the bride was the last of the word made flesh and a people would be the last sign post before we go to that land so the bride herself is a sign brother branham says in the identification of christ of in all ages it's god manifested in flesh now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and the husband is the self-same flesh these two are one and the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word amen so that the word in the church becomes the same the word in the church making it the bride the last sign god identify himself the word in the church so god was moving towards something even in solomon's temple he was moving towards a purpose and it's greater than moses tabernacle it's greater than what moses had built it's god taking another step yet solomon's tabernacle was not his goal but he's taken another step to his vision and every time god would bring and do away with we said the latter the later the next would always be greater than the previous let me just say this god as we said has no gear of reverse and no gear of neutral and if you want to stay with god you've got to progress when god moves and if you don't progress when god moves you're stuck left behind we got to progress i'll say lord i want to move on i want to move when you move do we have a church that feels that way say lord i want to progress when you progress i want to stay with the vision i want to stay with the lightest he is in the light i want to move with the light and so solomon's solomon praised this prayer in 2nd chronicles 6 you don't have to turn he prays this entire prayer and he and he says lord i've done everything according to how you've showed me i've not deviated from anything and he says now lord would you come and fill the house and the bible says that when solomon finishes praying that a great pillar of fire comes and a presence comes upon all of the priests and all the all of the ministers and the presence of god fills that tabernacle amen the same way he filled moses now he's filling solomon's giving his approval go to the next line if you could brother josh so just like he showed up in the tabernacle of moses it's the same pillar of fire that fills solomon's house this is a great picture a depiction of solomon's tabernacle it was beautiful it was grand just but let me just say this to you friends what made it glorious was it the lights was it the beauty was it the silver was it the diamonds was it the gold that's not what gave it the beauty god says man looks at the outward parts but i look at the inward parts the glory and the of the tabernacle was not the lights or the outward grange or the outward beauty or what you might think is success but the beauty laid within the person and the presence of that person coming and filling the tabernacle so now we know the story that after solomon's temple we know the jews backslide and god warns them through prophets amos comes and hosea comes and micah comes and isaiah nahum zephaniah habakkuk and jeremiah these are prophets warning them warning every time it seemed that god would bless them they'd backslide further and the more blessings the more carnal they became we know the story not to get into it but we know that they come and finally uh god there's a there's a point to where they cross a line and god sends a an evil nation and they come and deport all of the jews out of the kingdom they take them into babylonian captivity and now there's the northern tribes and the southern tribes and and they're they're they're there in babylon and then babylon's conquered by the persians just how daniel prophesied in this vision of that great giant statue that god would that gold that golden nebuchadnezzar kingdom would be replaced by the silver which was cyrus and now cyrus makes a decree and he gives a promise and he gives he gives a special opportunity to all of the deportees now remember it's not just jews who's in babylon but through nebuchadnezzar he had conquered nation after nation after nation and had taken captive nations from all over the world and so nebuchadnezzar makes this promise and cyrus makes this decree and says listen i'm going to let all of the illegals all of the aliens all of those who were deported all those who aren't from here i'm going to give you the chance to go free i'm going to allow you to leave here and return to your homeland and he says under one stipulation that when you go back to your home you rebuild your temple and when you rebuild that temple you make a sacrifice and pray for me pretty good idea right pretty smart guy tells all of the countries all of the nations all of the religions all of the people listen you're going to get to go free i have one stipulation go home build a tabernacle build a temple rebuild your temple and then make a sacrifice and when you make that sacrifice ask god to bless me you know what he sort of figured like you put enough shells in the in the gun eventually one would fire surely one of them's a real god surely one of the gods will answer my prayer pretty smart guy you know what they did they did it and now we know the story that they go back under ezra and nehemiah and joshua the high priest and they go back and they rebuild this temple and they start the work of rebuilding this tabernacle if you go to the next slide now now this is af this is afterwards but they rebuild this temple i want you to turn the haggy eye if you could haggy eye chapter 2 uh quickly in your bible and that you could keep this up so that they can turn in their in in the scripture they rebuild this tabernacle in this temple and this great move of ezra starts and nehemiah starts and they begin to rebuild the start of the work of the temple but you know what happens when they go back they go back and they leave babylon a place where they're increased where they're blessed where they have homes where they have people where they have lands and they go back to utter destruction and ruin there's been years that have elapsed you imagine years have went by since they dwelled there now you have all of the destruction all of the ruins where nebuchadnezzar had sacked the temple and destroyed the walls of jerusalem and they go back under all this revival and they go back under all this exuberant oh we're going to go we're going to go back we're going to rebuild you know sort of all that excitement from revival and excited for meetings and oh i'm going to get everything right i'm going to turn my life around i can hear that i feel the atmosphere of the preaching of the word you get all the other young people here and everyone's all happy and shouting on i'm going to make great changes and god's going to get a hold of me then you go back to reality on monday amen and you come to jerusalem and you go whoa this is overwhelming there is no where are we going to wait do we even consider where are we gonna live there are no houses where we where are we gonna dwell i don't i mean i'm all for rebuilding the temple but ezra what were we thinking we had homes in babylon we had houses we had a roof over our head you know what happens the condition of the ruin and destruction overwhelmed them amen you know one of the hardest works you can do the one of the hardest things you can do is to take something that is tattered and destroyed and rebuild it restoration is one of the hardest tasks you can do in building because you're starting not from scratch it's one thing to start from scratch you're starting from ruin and ruin can be discouraging ruin can be so discouraging let me just say this to you here today one of the hardest works that you'll ever do in your life is to take things that you've allowed in your life whether it was through sin or through a stage of backsliding or through a stage of infervency to the lord one of the hardest works you can be exuberated you can come under revival you can feel anointed but actually picking up the tools and starting to labor towards building one of the hardest struggles you'll ever have is to come back and to rebuild from a place you used to live amen and the struggles amongst them the struggles with them were so great when they're trying to rebuild and all there is is rubble [Music] and all there is is chaos and it's destruction and there's vines growing over it and there's thorns growing you could sort of see what used to be in the life that used to be there and you know most people would just go you know what ah i just i think uh nah not not for me i mean it sounded good guys but this is just overwhelming and that's exactly what happened to him and after just a very short work after a very short time of rebuilding they all just throw their hammers down throw their shovels down and go you know what we're going back to babylon and complete discouragement sets in discouragement sets in in their heart because it's overwhelming to them to think it's overwhelming for them to think what used to be and it's and not not only is the struggle of of seeing what used to be there but the samaritans are there and they hate the jews and they don't want them back there and the bible records how they antagonize them and every other kind of read about sennacherib and all the different things that was the king the man's name that comes to discourage them while they're up on the wall trying to rebuild they're on the ground just mocking omen and you know and just doing everything they can to try to destroy the atmosphere and to try to destroy the spirit of rebuilding friends let me just tell you there is nothing the devil will fight harder than when you get a heart to say lord i want to rebuild the tabernacle of god in my life i want to restore what has been lost she will never fight the devil harder amen there will never be more critics of people to try to discourage you and try to mock you and try to destroy the atmosphere whenever you go to rebuilding what satan has destroyed you can guarantee all hell will be there to try to stop you because the devil doesn't want your tabernacle your temple your place of worship your place of fervency your place of dedication whether you know why because he knows that with that temple comes the presence of god and with that temple comes the comes a man who fills that house and so he'll do everything he can to stop you from rebuilding your temple he'll do everything you can let you come to church but let your worship be in ruins and tatters and destroy satan doesn't mind he'll keep you there but put your hand to rebuilding and every devil in hell will try to discourage you and depress you and to overwhelm you you know what you've got to have in order to restore something you've got to have a vision of the completed project and when you can catch a vision not of the ruin and the destruction but you catch a vision of what it could be then you have the energy and the spirit and the anointing to say i'm not gonna look at circumstances i'm not gonna look at what i don't see i'm gonna keep my eyes on the vision he's laid before me and i'm gonna put my hand to working on this template amen amen he doesn't want it rebuilt he hates restoration he'll let you call yourself a christian a name only this is what brother branham said he doesn't care about that he don't care if you if you call yourself a message believer he isn't afraid of a title isn't afraid of that that doesn't move anything that doesn't move the devil when you call yourself a believer you come to church that doesn't scare him either right brother branham says and he speaks about a man he says but you take a person who in spite of all of the trial and all the persecution and all of the hatred that's being thrown at them he says they'll just humbly humbly bow themselves and stay true and sincere and pure before the lord brother branham says that's the thunder that shakes the devil's kingdom amen he hates he hates it but if you go to rebuilding the temple the praise the worship and spirit and truth that's what the devil can't stand that's why the bible says when david seen the ark restored he danced before the lord the devil hates restoration but the holy spirit loves it the holy spirit and the angels of god are there to back you up in the midst when you can look beyond the discouragement and say i'm going to press on any ways satan he ain't afraid let me just say this to you today he ain't afraid of dead churches that call themselves message churches he ain't afraid of your dresses he ain't afraid of your skirt seeing afraid of your long hair ain't afraid because you don't wear shorts because you don't cuss because you don't drink because you don't smoke he ain't afraid of all of your history in the message but what he is afraid of is that shekinah glory coming down into the church into the tabernacle and to the temple because he knows where the presence of god is there's the king who's in the camp and that's what the devil fights against he isn't afraid of the rebuilding of the structure or the shell and we build a lot of shells we build a lot of looks and images and we play the part satan ain't afraid of that he's only afraid when that heart is really changed on the inside and the presence of god tabernacles and takes his dwelling amen hagia comes to them and he says here in hagia too in the seventh month in the year if you could read it in your bible haggai chapter 2 20 day of the month came the word of the lord haggai prophet haggai saying speak not of zerubbabel the son of governor of judah unto joshua the son of joseph the high priest of the resident of the people saying who's the left who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory and how do you see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing could you imagine could you imagine you know what happens it's not as big as it was before brother matt it's not like it was in our day man if you could just hear about the camp meetings and revivals we used to have you know what happened is the older people started criticizing the new temple yeah imagine they started criticizing saying that ain't nothing why it's literally what haggai says is it as of you of nothing oh you know that you know what happens they fell to see the vision they failed to see the plan they felt to see the promise that the latter shall always be greater than the former amen and you could never forget this whenever god does a work in your life the work that he's doing right now is always greater than anything he's done in the past and you could always live so long trying to get back to something and you don't realize the work that god is doing in your heart right now is greater than anything he's ever done before and it may seem smaller and it may seem not as large and it may seem not as great and as grand but always remember that's why haggai says don't despise the day of small things don't despise what god is doing right now because whatever god's doing in operation in your life the latter will always be greater than the former amen is it as of you look at hagia chapter 2 who's left among you that saw this house in her first glory and how do you see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison as of nothing and here's his message to all of those discouraged believers who have became overwhelmed by the ruin yet now be strong amen oh zerubbabel saith the lord and be strong o joshua son of joseph deck the high priest and be strong all you people of the land saith the lord and here's something very very very very simple and if you read it in your bible if you're not just listen i'm going to read it to you he says be strong all you people of the land saith the lord and work and work there's something so powerful when you in spite of all of your discouragement and in spite of all of your all of the all of the circumstances around you and you don't feel like it and you don't you have no motivation to do it but you in spite of all of that pick up your hammer and you start to work and you start to labor in spite of all the criticism and in spite of all of the mockery in spite of all of the lack of energy that you have yet you pick up that pickaxe and you say in spite of all of it i'm gonna go to work and he says haggai says to them be strong and work for i am with you saith the lord of hosts for i am with you saith the lord of hosts look at verse 9 the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former saith the lord of hosts and in this place will i give peace saith the lord of hosts he says in verse 14. then answered haggy i so is this people and so is this nation before me saith the lord and so is every work of their hand of that which they offer there is unclean and now i pray you consider from this day and upward from before stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the lord listen what he says here now consider this verse 18 consider now from this day and upward consider now from this day and onward don't look behind you don't look in the past but focus on the work that you've got here before you oh my brother my sister let me just say this to you in your life forget the things which happened yesterday and focus on what god is doing right now before you you've got to have a vision to say lord i'm not going to focus on what i see or what i don't see i'm going to focus on what it could be i'm going to focus on what your word says i'm going to be i'm going to focus on your promises and not my discouragements [Applause] what did brother branham say when he speaks to the woman who's trying to receive her healing and i forget it was the arthritis or whatever disease he had and he says now sister just come up here he says i know you don't feel it he says but here's what i want you to do he says i want you to imagine a well body and start walking towards that will body what is god what is brother man i'm telling her don't look at your current condition but i want you to imagine use your imagination god gave it to you use the vision use your imagination he says imagine don't look at your body that's hurting right now don't look at your body this disease right now i want you to imagine yourself with no diseases no pain amen you got a trouble in your heart maybe in your body imagine a well body [Music] and brother branham says and start walking towards that well body amen what was he saying exactly what haggai i was telling them consider this an upward yeah look upward don't look here look at the promise joshua is that what he tells joshua before jericho see i have given you jericho but hold on lord you know when he said that to joshua the walls were still standing you think god would have said that to joshua here's the promise to joshua see i've given you jericho in your hands you'd think god would have said that to joshua after he had given him jericho and after the walls were down and they were standing on the destroyed walls then god could say see i've given you but you missed the point god was saying joshua don't look at the walls oh hello somebody don't look at the tall walls don't look at the impossibility see i have given you jericho in other words joshua when you look at those walls i want you to look into a vision of walls that are torn down of walls that are standing on the ground and then go towards jericho joshua see i have given you imagine a well body and start walking towards it oh brother matt but i don't see it now but look at the promises of god's word and bank your faith on that promise all my children are not saved imagine children that are born again of the spirit of god and start walking towards it my marriage is in shamble imagine a marriage where the faith where the presence of god imagine a home look at the promises of god and walk towards it don't look at your current circumstance focus on the vision consider this and from this day and upwards so for every moment you take in every step that you take and every time you have to pick up that hammer and you have to pick up that block and you've got to lay that block and you start to get discouraged because work's taken longer than what you wanted it to take you know restoration's a process takes time takes time takes constant continual steady effort okay takes constant steady continual doesn't happen overnight doesn't happen overnight but you you know what you got to do you got to keep that vision of that project completed always before you and every time you go to get discouraged by what you don't see and by the ruin around you just stop in your mo in that moment and look to the word of god use your spiritual eyes say brother man do i have spiritual do i have a spiritual life brother branham said that faith is the sixth sense you don't just look at what you hear and what you see but you enter into faith that sixth sense and anytime you get discouraged and you get discouraged so much that you can't pick up the hammer pick up the hammer and consider the promises of god no weapon formed against you shall prosper the name of the lord is a strong tower where the righteous in times of trouble run into and are saved and i'm going to keep banging i'm going to keep working i'm going to keep hammering win brother man i'm going to keep the vision before me i'm going to look onward and upward not in my circumstances i'm going to look at what god said and i'm going to say that's the word of god and that's the only truth that i need to focus on i'm going to cast down all other imaginations what about the random call them blind vanities he says do you not see do you do you not see that the he says all of you that are looking upon this house right now he says the latter the later what i'm doing right now what i'm doing right now shall be greater than anything i've ever done before and he moves from there i love this so much he moves from that temple god's not done yet and they build another temple events that form me brother josh it moves it builds another temple you see the temple in the heritage day i know we've shown this before but it was too good just not to continue he show he builds the temple what are they always moving towards always moving towards the plan always moving towards the vision the latter shall be greater than the former not greater and grander not greater in statute but it actually might get smaller might get less granulous but it's going to be greater because it's a further fulfillment it's something further that i'm doing and so he moves from moses to solomon haggai that building under under zerubbabel build this temple under herod and now god go to the next slide brother josh takes his next temple [Applause] [Music] and he says behold i say unto you there's one standing among you now that's greater than the temple hold on a minute wait what's happened god has taken another step towards his plan and it's the bible says it this way there was no beauty that we should desire right yeah there was no outward glitter or glamour sparkle that's why they missed it brother adam says god hides himself in simplicity you know who missed this all of the religious world completely missed it yeah amen because they're so focused on the la on the farmer that they miss what god's doing what brother adam say they're always thanking him for what he did always thanking him for what he's going to do but missing and failing to see what he's doing right now hallelujah he's moving towards something you say brother matt that was that was it that was it the end no no no he wasn't done there there would come another temple and paul would say know you not that you are the temple of the holy ghost listen to what brother branham says go to the next slide brother josh listen as the prophet of god says now why did this have to be so why was it that the seed of the serpent must come this way man was created for god man was to be the temple of god the place of god's rest the holy spirit was man the temple we'll pick this up lord willing on sunday man the place of god's rest i desire to have a house the place of god's rest the holy spirit was man the temple go to the next brother josh if you could i believe that god in the garden of eden before the garden of eden i believe that god knew the end from the beginning i believe that and that everything in the great clock and the great picture is just moving in and nothing can stop it it's going to be just exactly according to what god said it would be let me remind you church nothing will stop it amen let me remind you church nothing will stop it though all hell is against it all hell can't stop it that's what brother random says i believe god is moving towards this great picture this great clock and nothing will stop is that it brother josh next slide i think that's all but yeah let's let's move on i didn't know if i included the rest the big churches made fun and pointed their fingers they said we were holy rollers when i laid the cornerstone they said they would turn that little thing into a garage it's been 20 years ago and holy ghost still lives here keep going hallelujah that's right and what they said was fanaticism and everything kings and monarchs across the world is called great man has been healed the powers of god have swept the world around it till now we stand millions strong hallelujah keep going and one of these mornings she's went through the critics they said it would burn out they said to me down there oh billy you lost your mind that's all there is to it even my own mother-in-law said why is the boys going crazy but if i am i'm having a wonderful time let me tell you something brother listen to this and i say this with respect hallelujah if you hear him on tape oh hell can't stop it it's ordained of jesus christ to be so and it will be for upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it amen how what is kind of what kind of church flesh and flesh and blood is not revealed to thee peter but my father which is in heaven has revealed it to you spiritual revelation by the holy ghost of the word of god on this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it she's moving on amen amen god has always taken a step to the next step to the next step now she's brother she's been made fun of and persecuted and pushed back in everything one of these glorious mornings hallelujah that great master who stands in glory pointing out to his servants not by power not by my but by my spirit saith the lord not by theology not by grammar not by these other things but by simple holy unadulterated faith in the son of god and what he said in his word he's painting a picture he's painting a picture what is it a holy ghost filled church that he foreordained before the beginning of the world to appear yonder in his glory keep going he says that appeared yonder is that all brother josh that's wonderful he says to bear holy ghost filled church city for a day and before the beginning of the world to appear yonder in glory amen what was it he was moving taking a step towards his plan and he would take that vessel that was all of the fullness of god dwelled you think of that in christ dwelt the fullness of the godhead in a body all of the gifts all of the talents everything david was everything daniel was everything solomon was everything shadrach meshach and abednego everything all of the prophets were everything samson was everything shamgar had all of the power all of the gifts of the spirit all of the manifestations of the spirit dwelled in one human temple in one human tabernacle amen and god said i'm going to take everything that was inside of him and i'm going to like a like like like a because that's exactly what the scripture says he that believeth on me shall out of his belly flow rivers of living water and he says but he spoke john 7 he spoke of the spirit which had not yet been sent the holy ghost which had not yet been given he had not yet ascended but what was god's plan ultimately was it to bottle all of the presence of god in a man named christ jesus so that we could forever exalt and and speak of his crucifixion and speak of his miracles and speak of jesus of now oh i'm still testifying about jesus of nazareth he still means something to me i'm still testifying and preaching about his cross preaching about his resurrection but i'm not forgetting that his plan didn't stop with the man christ jesus but the christ is the mystery of god revealed would be a threefold purpose that he would then take the preeminence that he had in christ and he would get the preeminence and a many-membered body as he would take his spirit and he would pour it into a church and all of the great ocean and the great vastness of the spirit of god you imagine the spirit of god like a great ocean brother man says you bottle up and he says if you take that great ocean he says how could i ever get everything that was in that ocean he says but if i take a cup and i just dip my cup he says everything in that ocean everything that that ocean is made up is now in that cup amen you say how do i get all of god in me you take an empty vessel you empty out yourself and you say god fill me with your spirit yes he was without measure but now there's a mini-membered body and brother branham said it would be the fullness of christ in a mini-membered body that that spirit would so dwell and engulf a human being that god would get the total preeminence out of that vessel that that spirit would be so upon the believer that they would be the final voice to a final age that it wouldn't be their thoughts right say lord i don't need any of my thoughts how many want to say that here today empty me of all of my thoughts and all of myself and all of my opinions and once i'm empty lord don't keep me there but now fill me with the mind of christ with the intelligence brother branham says what was that headstone that comes to the body it was the intelligence the mind of christ or you don't think your own thoughts we've had enough let me just say it this way i have had enough of my own thoughts i've had enough of my own reactions i say lord give me your thoughts i've had enough of my own temperament now i'm ready for the spirit of the temperament of jesus to live inside of my vessel could you stand to your feet with me musicians could you come well we got to page one no i'm just kidding come back sunday we got we got through a lot of it we only got through page one where we gonna be at on sunday page two you love the lord amen prophet of god says this i wanted to read this quote just as the if you could just play something for me brother tony if you could come the voice of the sign in 1964 says hallelujah they were only waiting for god but god was waiting on them he had his prophet out there in the wilderness but he was only waiting for the people to call him into action and i believe he has got the same thing today waiting for his church to call it on the scene so he can act the promise of today is ready but he's got to get the people to praying and groaning like they were down there then it'll come on the scene that's right you say why why does the condition of the world and the condition that it's in right now this isn't what we would have expected but we got trials we got hardships how many's got them as paul said we're pressed on every side without he says above measure say brother matt why does god get us into that condition and that place inside of even the place of ruin and we come to places in our life where we feel like it's just total destruction so that something inside of the true heart of the believer a real believer won't be content there but a real believer will begin to call upon the name of the lord to say change me lord oh could you raise your hands and close your eyes and say lord would you change me take my circumstances that i have in my life and i got something inside of my heart that says give me a greater measure of your love give me a greater measure of your life give me a greater measure of your spirit lord i want it overflowing as we said sunday i'm not content with where i'm at now lord i want more of your presence more of your spirit more of your life [Music] more of you lord and less of me that's my prayer oh god till we can call you on the scene as your prophet said you were waiting for them to call you into action let it be lord god as your prophet as we just read it here let it be lord god that that spirit that was in christ not just lives inside of our vessels but let it have the preeminence i surrender lord as i raise my hands to you right now asking you here on this wednesday night empty me lord of all of myself empty me and fill me with your life and have the preeminence lord jesus your word says that your prophet said that that word that seed that's inside of us will make this body come subject to
