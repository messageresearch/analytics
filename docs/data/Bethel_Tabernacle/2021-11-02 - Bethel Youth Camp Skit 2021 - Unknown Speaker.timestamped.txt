[9:44] is trying to overthrow me i know it
[9:48] oh great king jeroboam how may we advise
[9:51] you tell us your quandary
[9:53] as you know it is about the time for all
[9:54] of israel to go to jerusalem to give the
[9:56] burner office to the lord
[9:58] what happens when the people give their
[10:00] burnt offerings and their hearts to
[10:02] return to the lord what happens when
[10:04] they decide they want a bumbling idiot
[10:06] rehoboam
[10:07] how horrible your majesty
[10:10] that could never happen
[10:11] surely your people would stay loyal to
[10:13] you and what if they aren't
[10:16] we could lose everything they could have
[10:17] be killed no
[10:19] we must find a way to make the people
[10:20] stay here
[10:22] i have the perfect solution highness
[10:24] first we find their weakness then
[10:26] manipulate them it's quite easy
[10:30] your majesty do not listen to him he has
[10:33] impure motives
[10:35] me
[10:36] sire i feel attacked
[10:41] weakness
[10:42] sire what's the one thing that the
[10:44] people want to be like everyone else
[10:47] that's why we have a king in the first
[10:48] place what's the one thing that'll make
[10:50] them that made them stop worshiping
[10:54] jehovah when they hit the red sea
[10:57] listen king i am begging you do not
[10:59] listen to him his impure motives he is
[11:01] an evil counsel
[11:03] are you forgetting that god chose me to
[11:05] be king so i will do exactly as i see
[11:07] fit and i see fit to keep a watchful eye
[11:09] over all of jerusalem
[11:14] that's it i have a completely original
[11:15] idea that i came up with
[11:21] [Music]
[11:28] calling all israelites inhabitants of
[11:30] samaria come to the palace at once by
[11:33] royal decree
[11:41] people of israel listen to me
[11:43] the journey is far too long and
[11:45] dangerous this year to take
[11:46] behold thy gods which brought you out of
[11:48] egypt now you can worship at home like
[11:51] the neighboring countries
[11:52] behold these high places
[11:54] the priests and mainly i have built for
[11:56] you
[12:02] yes i am amazing
[12:19] yes
[12:21] i am spectacular
[12:29] thank you
[12:40] um king a man of god from jude is here
[12:42] to speak with you
[12:44] what do you want
[12:47] oh altar
[12:49] thou art unholy
[12:51] and a sinful snare unto the people of
[12:53] israel
[12:54] thus saith the lord
[12:56] a child shall be born to the house of
[12:58] david josiah by name
[13:01] and upon you
[13:02] shall he offer these priests
[13:05] of the high places that burn incense
[13:06] upon you
[13:08] he will shatter you
[13:10] and destroy these high places
[13:13] and the people of israel
[13:15] that will become oppressed they'll be
[13:17] conquered
[13:18] and they'll become
[13:20] a scattered people among the nations
[13:22] because they have worshiped idols
[13:31] jeroboam had no way of knowing the
[13:33] severity of the transgressions he had
[13:35] made and that every word the prophet
[13:37] spoke would come to pass he did not know
[13:39] that 300 years of sin and misery would
[13:42] come to pass before josiah would come or
[13:45] that israel would live in drought famine
[13:47] and servitude again and again and again
[13:50] because of his decision he did not know
[13:52] that his lineage would become gruesomely
[13:54] cut off and he would forever be known as
[13:57] jeroboam the son of nabat who made
[13:59] israel to sin
[14:01] and so began the 300-year trial of
[14:03] israel's battle with idolatry
[14:06] many kings came and went after jeroboam
[14:09] in israel likewise
[14:11] the kings of the house of david also
[14:13] arose and fell after rehoboam and judah

[14:18] follows

[19:53] yes he loved witchcraft and provoked the
[19:55] lord to wrath even sacrificing his own

[19:59] but then he was later captured and
[20:01] tortured by the king of assyria he
[20:03] called on god who delivered him back to

[21:18] guys come on the people need these
[21:20] they're getting tired of worshiping some
[21:22] invisible force plus you're gonna start
[21:25] losing popularity if you start changing
[21:26] things now
[21:54] i care not what others think of me only
[21:56] god's opinion matters
[21:58] we we must serve the lord to the best of
[22:00] our ability regardless of what other
[22:02] wicked men do
[22:06] what
[22:10] i will fit in with other servants of
[22:12] jehovah
[22:14] remember what our ancestor king david
[22:16] said
[22:17] the lord will bless the righteous and
[22:19] compass us with a shield
[22:22] bethel kaya
[22:23] i worry that judah is doomed we have
[22:26] broken god's law
[22:27] many times
[22:29] guys guys guys you're taking this
[22:31] way too seriously besides those high
[22:34] places they're classics
[22:37] no one gets hurt well minus the kids
[22:40] that got up
[22:42] sacrificed
[22:44] but still
[22:45] they were more than willing to get
[22:46] sacrifice
[22:47] probably
[22:49] oh king do not listen to this evil one
[22:51] he cares not for the ways of the lord
[22:53] hey look i'm just trying to help doesn't
[22:55] god know your heart and all that good
[22:57] stuff
[22:58] besides these old laws really confusing
[23:01] i've heard the word abomination like 10
[23:03] times not 9 10 in like the last hour
[23:09] god's law protects us from blasphemers
[23:11] like you
[23:13] life is still isn't supposed to be this
[23:14] hard did god just slave save us from the
[23:17] egyptians just to be enslaved by the
[23:19] words of puffed up prophets
[23:21] it was a prophet that spoke of this very
[23:23] king his prophets are vindicated by his
[23:25] word and he changeth not oh you are so
[23:28] arrogant do you really think that you're
[23:30] the only one that has a right and
[23:31] everyone else has it wrong yes
[23:35] i refuse to give ear to this slander kid
[23:37] they behind me lucifer
[23:42] bring me my royal clubs
[23:49] and just as prophecy foretold when
[23:52] josiah was only 20 years old he began
[23:55] what other kings in judah had failed to
[23:57] do
[23:58] he tore down the high places built by
[24:00] evil kings in judah and then finally he
[24:04] destroyed high places throughout all
[24:06] israel established by
[24:08] jeroboam the son of nabat who made
[24:10] israel to sin
[24:13] i make my choice now
[24:17] to give
[24:18] to serve the lord
[24:20] that the one true god of israel and i
[24:23] shall not rest until this land is purged
[24:25] of idolatry
[24:38] [Applause]
[24:58] and when he had broken down the altars
[25:01] and the groves
[25:02] and he had beaten the graven images to
[25:04] dust
[25:05] the people worshiped the one true god
[25:11] [Applause]
[25:53] jeremiah the prophet god said before you
[25:56] is even formed in your mother's womb
[25:58] i knew you and sanctified you and
[26:01] ordained you a prophet over the nations
[26:04] is that right before he ever come to
[26:06] this mother's womb
[26:10] [Music]
[26:20] but he got mixed up in the wrong group
[26:25] that's where
[26:26] many a young man and young woman loses
[26:29] out getting mixed up in the wrong group
[26:32] one night they've taken him out give him
[26:34] a drink oh play a little game or do this
[26:38] or gamble a little it won't hurt
[26:42] that's the first several entities
[26:49] we know coming of the lord is at hand
[26:51] and the bible said in the last days that
[26:53] the devil would go about like a roaring
[26:56] lion he's going about to seek whom he
[26:58] may devour he don't care who you are
[27:01] he's going after our little kids he's
[27:03] going after the middle age going after
[27:05] the old people seeking whom he may
[27:07] devour
[27:08] oh we're gonna watch out
[27:11] we gotta watch out find out who you're
[27:13] fighting against we're not fighting
[27:14] against our brother and sister we've got
[27:17] a real enemy tonight
[27:19] it's the devil
[27:25] [Music]
[27:28] we if we're not careful we somehow
[27:30] believe
[27:31] that the presence
[27:33] of trial or the presence of difficulty
[27:36] or the presence of a storm
[27:38] means the absence of god but actually
[27:41] it's the opposite
[27:43] the presence of trouble and struggle and
[27:46] storm is the evidence
[27:50] that god is there paul says to timothy
[27:53] just because you're enduring hardness
[27:54] and suffering and great difficulty don't
[27:57] buy into the idea that the presence of
[28:00] the storm means the absence of god
[28:02] know that your trials and your struggles
[28:04] and your tests are proof that you're a
[28:07] child of god you're a son of god you're

[29:36] and will give you eternal life and raise
[29:38] you up
