[6:01] morning everyone God bless you amen
[6:04] let's stand and
[6:06] pray Heavenly Father we just come before
[6:08] you Lord and we ask that your presence
[6:11] would be with us father that you would
[6:13] just take your word Lord and and uh the
[6:17] portion that's allotted to us today uh
[6:20] break it open to our hearts and speak
[6:23] things to us Lord that maybe we haven't
[6:26] seen before haven't understood before
[6:28] but are laying there in your word word
[6:29] father that the spirit of Revelation
[6:32] that has come forth in this age and this
[6:35] generation Lord would have its fruits
[6:37] and effect in our lives father we Commit
[6:40] This Time To You For Your Glory we ask
[6:43] in Jesus name amen continuing on Israel
[6:47] God's time piece part
[6:50] six and uh we'll just start with the
[6:55] scripture I don't know if this is going
[6:57] to work it's been on for who knows how
[7:02] long ah there we
[7:05] go all right Ezekiel 20 we're going to
[7:08] look at I'm just going to read through
[7:10] it then we'll sit as I live sayith the
[7:12] Lord God surely with a mighty hand and
[7:15] with a stretched out arm and with Fury
[7:17] poured out will I rule over you and I
[7:20] will bring you out from the people and
[7:22] will gather you out of the countries
[7:24] when you wherein you are scattered with
[7:26] a mighty hand and with a stretched out
[7:28] arm and with Fury poured out and I will
[7:31] bring you into the Wilderness of the
[7:32] people and there will I plead with you
[7:35] face to face like as I pleaded with your
[7:38] fathers in the wilderness of the land of
[7:39] Egypt so will I plead with you saith the
[7:42] Lord God and I will cause you to pass
[7:44] under the rod and I will bring you into
[7:47] the bond of the Covenant and I will
[7:49] Purge out from among you the rebels and
[7:51] them that transgress against me I will
[7:54] bring them forth out of the country
[7:56] where they sojourn and they shall not
[7:57] enter into the land of Israel and you
[8:00] shall know that I am the Lord amen may
[8:04] the Lord add the blessing to the reading
[8:05] of his word you can be
[8:07] seated so as we look at that we could
[8:11] see several parts to this is first God
[8:15] is going to bring Israel back to the
[8:17] land actually using his wrath so we look
[8:21] at the first verses that first few
[8:24] verses there is he's going to with an
[8:27] outstretched
[8:29] arm and with Fury poured out will I rule
[8:33] over you and I will bring you out from
[8:34] the people so he's not talking about
[8:37] people that are in the land he's talking
[8:38] to people that are outside of the land
[8:41] and that this is the process he's going
[8:42] to use to bring them back into the land
[8:45] so they're still under God's Wrath as we
[8:47] saw before God he doesn't convert them
[8:50] before he brings them back to the land
[8:52] but this verse shows that he actually
[8:55] purges Israel amen though they're in
[8:58] other countries
[9:00] it says he purges them and brings them
[9:03] out to the Wilderness so it's like a
[9:06] perfect uh description of what actually
[9:08] happened it's quite amazing so he uses
[9:12] his wrath poured out upon them to bring
[9:14] them out so Nazi fascist communist
[9:17] purges that took
[9:19] place before and during World War II and
[9:24] then he says he brings them away from
[9:26] Into the Wilderness so they were taken
[9:28] out of the cities that they were in and
[9:30] were actually brought to concentration
[9:33] camps and there will I plead with you
[9:36] well you think about that I mean what a
[9:39] way to any any of us how you challenge
[9:41] where someone's eyes are looking at is
[9:44] by bringing them into suffering and so
[9:46] he brings them into this Concentration
[9:50] Camp Wilderness away from where they
[9:52] lived to literally plead with them who
[9:55] will you trust in who will you believe
[9:57] in will you turn away from God will you
[9:59] turn to God now they're still not
[10:02] converted
[10:04] right but they have the promises of the
[10:06] fathers but then he says I will cause
[10:09] them to pass under the rod right so
[10:13] before they go back to the land before
[10:16] they're allowed to get back into the
[10:17] land they have to be purged then they
[10:20] have to pass under the rod then he
[10:22] brings in them into the Covenant it says
[10:25] well which Covenant well ultimately he's
[10:27] bringing them to the New Covenant amen
[10:30] as we'll see later but but first in
[10:32] order to bring them into the New
[10:34] Covenant he has to bring them into
[10:35] Abraham's Covenant which is the land
[10:38] amen they had been driven out because
[10:40] they rejected their
[10:42] Messiah and continued to reject him and
[10:45] so God says I'm going to bring you back
[10:47] but first I will Purge you first I'll
[10:50] try you first I will test you I'll make
[10:53] you pass under this Rod of Affliction
[10:55] then I'll let you enter first into the
[10:58] Covenant promis to
[11:00] Abraham before you're converted all
[11:03] right let's continue on Ezekiel
[11:07] 37 and I think Ezekiel 37 we're very
[11:10] familiar you've probably heard many many
[11:13] Revival messages preached about will
[11:15] these bones live but I want you to look
[11:18] at this and think about it actually in
[11:20] the prophetic picture certainly we can
[11:22] use that as a type to speak about God
[11:25] bringing Supernatural Revival and the
[11:28] power of God and the baptism of the Holy
[11:30] Ghost but really it's not talking about
[11:32] that
[11:34] exactly all right because remember we're
[11:36] T this is
[11:38] Ezekiel we just were reading in Ezekiel
[11:41] 23 we read before in Ezekiel 36 it's all
[11:46] speaking about Israel it's speaking
[11:48] about the restoration of Israel all from
[11:51] 36 through 44 is talking
[11:55] about around the time of world war let's
[11:58] let's just say the Leo leodan Church age
[12:01] through the Millennium right and we'll
[12:04] we'll get into some of these things not
[12:06] in uh super detail but in in general
[12:10] detail we'll look at it um so I
[12:12] prophesied as he commanded me and the
[12:15] breath came into them and they lived and
[12:17] stood up upon their feet an exceeding
[12:20] great
[12:21] Army then he said unto me son of man
[12:24] these bones are the whole house of
[12:26] Israel see that's what we're talking
[12:29] about we read I think we read I think at
[12:31] last in part uh five we read about the
[12:35] bones coming to life and so forth this
[12:38] is where he says what it is these bones
[12:40] are the whole house of Israel behold
[12:43] they say our bones are dried and our
[12:45] hope is lost we are cut off for our
[12:48] parts in other words they are scattered
[12:51] out of the
[12:53] land therefore prophesy and say unto
[12:55] them thus sayith the Lord behold oh my
[12:57] people I will open your Graves and cause
[12:59] you to come out up out of your Graves
[13:02] and bring you into the land of Israel
[13:05] and you shall know that I am the Lord
[13:07] and I have opened your Graves oh my
[13:09] people and brought you up out of your
[13:11] Graves and shall put my spirit in you
[13:14] and you shall live and I shall place you
[13:17] in your own land then shall you know
[13:19] that I the Lord have spoken it and
[13:21] performed it sayeth the Lord the word of
[13:24] the Lord came unto me saying moreover
[13:26] thou son of man take thee once stick and
[13:29] write upon it for Judah and for the
[13:32] children of Israel his companions then
[13:34] take another stick and write upon it for
[13:35] Joseph The Stick of Ephraim and for all
[13:38] the house of Israel his companions and
[13:41] join them one to another into one stick
[13:44] and they shall become one in thine hand
[13:47] amen and then when the children of thy
[13:49] people shall speak unto thee saying wilt
[13:51] thou not show us what thou meanest by
[13:53] these say unto them thus sayith the Lord
[13:55] God behold I will take the Stick of
[13:57] Joseph which is in the hand of
[14:00] and the tribes of Israel his fellows and
[14:02] will put them with him even with the
[14:04] Stick of Judah and make them one stick
[14:06] and they shall be one in mine hand amen
[14:10] and the sticks wherein thou wrest shall
[14:11] be in thine hand before their eyes and
[14:14] say unto them thus sayith the Lord God
[14:15] behold I will take the children of
[14:17] Israel from among the Heathen wither
[14:19] they are beg gone and will gather them
[14:21] on every side and bring them into their
[14:24] own land and I will make them one nation
[14:27] in the land upon the mount mountain of
[14:29] Israel and one one king shall be king
[14:32] unto them all and they shall be no more
[14:33] two Nations neither shall they be
[14:35] divided into two kingdoms anymore
[14:38] neither shall they defile themselves
[14:39] anymore with their Idols nor with their
[14:41] detestable things nor with any of their
[14:43] transgressions but I will save them out
[14:45] of all their Dwelling Places wherein
[14:46] they have sinned and will cleanse them
[14:49] so they shall be my people and I will be
[14:52] their
[14:53] God all right so let me just uh pause
[14:56] there as we're looking at that
[15:01] this is this is describing to us their
[15:03] history and actually it's it is history
[15:06] because he when he restored Israel he
[15:08] didn't restore a northern kingdom and a
[15:10] southern Kingdom he didn't restore a
[15:12] separated people he simply restored the
[15:15] nation of Israel it's already come to
[15:18] pass now they don't have a king they
[15:20] have a prime minister they have a
[15:21] president they have a parliamentary
[15:23] style government uh but this will not
[15:26] always be so amen right there going to
[15:29] be there's going to be a messiah that
[15:31] returns to set up the millennial Kingdom
[15:34] and so then the the total fulfillment
[15:37] you see that you have to understand
[15:39] anytime you look at a prophecy we think
[15:40] of it oh it's filled like in an
[15:42] instantaneous event as message Believers
[15:45] we should understand clearly now that's
[15:47] not how it works if you understand the
[15:50] coming of the son of man you can
[15:52] understand that it encompasses quite a
[15:54] number event of events brother brandom's
[15:58] Ministry
[15:59] right the the ministry of the word in
[16:01] the bride amen that the literal Rapture
[16:06] that's part of it that's that's all part
[16:07] of it it's a process it's been taking
[16:10] place as the scripture speaks about it
[16:13] in uh uh Luke 17 it calls it the days of
[16:18] the son of man so the days of the as it
[16:21] was in the days of Noah so shall it be
[16:23] in the days of the son of man and so
[16:26] it's speaking of a period of time
[16:28] leading up to and including the Judgment
[16:31] but it's not speaking of an
[16:33] instantaneous immediate
[16:36] event you can't work out the days of
[16:38] Noah equaling the days of the son of man
[16:40] and say oh that's an instantaneous event
[16:43] even the name of it itself shows that
[16:46] it's more than just one moment days of
[16:49] the son of man so when we're looking at
[16:51] this prophecy God is bringing the dead
[16:55] bones of Israel laying in the nations of
[16:58] the world
[16:59] and he's bringing them from everywhere
[17:02] back to the land that's his that's his
[17:05] National Revival that's what brother
[17:07] Branham speaks about and talks about
[17:10] plainly that's it's their National
[17:13] Revival being brought back to the land
[17:16] but that's that's a political Revival
[17:18] that's not a spiritual Revival their
[17:22] their true Revival is going to become is
[17:24] going to come in that moment when the
[17:27] 144,000 are sealed in the tribulation
[17:31] period but they're restored back to the
[17:33] land
[17:35] unconverted right they come back to the
[17:38] land and the scripture is clear about
[17:40] that they they're they're raised up
[17:43] they're brought back they're entered
[17:45] into the land Covenant but just because
[17:47] you're in the land Covenant right
[17:50] doesn't mean you're in the spiritual
[17:52] Covenant with God can you can you see
[17:56] that separation otherwise if there
[17:58] they're in the they're in the entire
[18:00] Covenant when Jesus came he'd have W
[18:02] walked right in they'd have welcomed him
[18:04] and he'd have been King and we'd been
[18:05] living in them in the Eternal ages by
[18:07] now none of us would have come
[18:10] forth right so that just because you are
[18:14] a part of natural Israel which receives
[18:17] the natural Covenant coming from Abraham
[18:20] there's a spiritual Covenant that comes
[18:22] becomes a part of that Jesus said to the
[18:24] Pharisees in John 8 I
[18:27] know you're Abraham's
[18:30] seed but if you were Abraham's children
[18:33] you'd recognize who I am
[18:36] amen so there's a clear separation they
[18:39] certainly are Heirs of the promises to
[18:43] Abraham Naturally
[18:45] Speaking that's good but that's not
[18:48] eternal
[18:50] life that's not the baptism of the Holy
[18:52] Ghost just as we can understand our
[18:54] children are born under a covenant the
[18:58] the Bible says children born to even a
[19:01] home of one believer just a mother or
[19:04] just a father is a believer in the home
[19:06] the child is uh under a promise amen but
[19:11] that doesn't mean they receed the
[19:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost they've got to
[19:14] go on and receive the baptism of the
[19:15] Holy Ghost that's where salvation comes
[19:18] in that's where they enter into the to
[19:20] the New Covenant relationship with
[19:22] God all right all
[19:25] right and David my servant shall be king
[19:28] over them and they shall have one
[19:29] Shepherd they shall also walk in my
[19:31] judgments and OB observe my statutes and
[19:34] do them and they shall dwell in the land
[19:36] that I have given unto Jacob my servant
[19:38] wherein your fathers have dwelt and they
[19:40] shall dwell therein even they and their
[19:42] children and their children's children
[19:43] forever and my servant David shall there
[19:45] be their prince forever again this is
[19:50] speaking of the the process first the
[19:54] Revival the N the political Revival he
[19:57] brings them back to the land and Ezekiel
[20:00] 3637 even earlier the chapter 23 is
[20:05] speaking using different types showing
[20:07] Israel bring coming back to the land and
[20:11] this is the this is God's purpose he's
[20:13] going to set a king over them so right
[20:15] now right now we can understand why is
[20:18] Israel back in the land God's fulfilling
[20:21] the promise that there is going to be a
[20:24] king there there's much more that goes
[20:26] into the prophecy But ultimately there
[20:29] is going to be a king in Israel and the
[20:33] Bible the Bible tells us Jesus Promised
[20:35] his his his Apostles that they will sit
[20:38] on 12 thr Thrones judging the 12 tribes
[20:42] of Israel so there will be a davidic
[20:46] kingdom restored and it'll be literally
[20:49] on this
[20:50] Earth and there'll be the bride ruling
[20:54] over the Nations the Gentile bride will
[20:55] rule the Nations but the Jewish people
[20:59] that entered into the New Covenant and
[21:01] were part of the Bride they'll rule over
[21:03] the Jewish Nation
[21:06] amen moreover I will make a covenant of
[21:09] peace with them it shall be an
[21:10] Everlasting Covenant with them and I
[21:12] will place them and multiply them and
[21:15] will set my sanctuary in the midst of
[21:17] them forever more my Tabernacle also
[21:21] shall be with them yay I will be their
[21:23] God and they shall be my people again in
[21:27] in the Millennium it's it's a natural
[21:29] Tabernacle right there's going to be a
[21:32] temple restored
[21:34] rebuilt um in the future we're going to
[21:37] talk a little bit about the tribulation
[21:40] Temple but this right here is talking
[21:42] about
[21:43] ultimately uh in I believe it's Daniel
[21:46] chapter 9 he speaks of the Messiah
[21:49] coming and anointing the most holy place
[21:54] so in the tribulation period it's used
[21:58] misused
[21:59] right but in the Millennium what happens
[22:02] the Messiah comes and he's the one that
[22:05] anoints the most holy Place amen all
[22:11] right and the Heathen shall know that I
[22:14] the Lord do sanctify Israel When My
[22:17] Sanctuary shall be in the midst of them
[22:19] forever more and I will pour upon the
[22:22] House of David and upon the inhabitants
[22:24] of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of
[22:27] supplications and they they shall look
[22:29] upon me whom they have pierced and they
[22:32] shall mourn for him as one mourneth for
[22:35] his only son and shall be in bitterness
[22:38] for him as one that is in bitterness for
[22:41] his firstborn so uh let me read the next
[22:44] verse and we'll comment on that that's
[22:46] Zechariah
[22:48] 1210 and Isaiah 668 who ha heard such a
[22:51] thing who who has seen such a thing
[22:53] shall the Earth be made to bring forth
[22:55] in one day or shall a nation be born at
[22:57] once for a soon as Zion travailed she
[23:00] brought forth her children all right
[23:04] let's read a quote from the second seal
[23:06] there was a brother here one time wanted
[23:07] to be a missionary felt to go missionary
[23:10] to the Jews I said you you might get one
[23:12] now and then oh people thinks the whole
[23:14] nation no sir Israel is converted as a
[23:17] nation not as a person a nation will be
[23:19] born in a day that's Israel all Israel
[23:22] is saved just remember that Paul said so
[23:24] all Israel is saved now notice all
[23:26] Israel that's exactly right right all
[23:29] right
[23:31] so now let's go back to what we are what
[23:35] we know and what we understand um when
[23:39] we look at this so all Israel will be
[23:42] saved all right so that to to to the
[23:46] Natural mind we think every single Jew
[23:49] that lives in Israel will be converted
[23:52] is that what that
[23:53] means it's not what it means okay so
[23:57] what what does it mean that all Israel
[23:59] will be born in a day he converts them
[24:01] as a nation now it's never been in the
[24:04] history of Israel that everyone was a
[24:07] genuine believer point point to me when
[24:10] it
[24:12] was it never was you know e even when
[24:16] there was just 12
[24:18] tribes point to The Godly Believers
[24:20] amongst
[24:21] them one of
[24:23] them maybe
[24:26] two right so you understand
[24:29] as time went along how many were real
[24:31] Believers there was a whole nation
[24:32] millions of people that came out of
[24:34] Egypt but how many were really
[24:38] Believers not too many Moses Aaron
[24:44] Miriam uh Caleb
[24:47] Joshua and Caleb and Joshua were the
[24:50] only ones that were able to go on and go
[24:52] into to the land from that group the
[24:54] rest of them died outside of the land
[24:57] and so there's a th though the the the
[25:00] number of the children of Israel be as
[25:01] the sand of the sea a Remnant will be
[25:04] saved so how do we reconcile the Nations
[25:06] born in a day all Israel will be saved
[25:09] how do we put this all together well the
[25:13] scripture does it for us we don't have
[25:17] to if I can get it to come up again I
[25:20] don't know what I did brother
[25:22] Mark it's not obeying me
[25:33] all
[25:36] right in in that day now let me SK skip
[25:39] forward because I'm I'm I'm going to
[25:41] come back to
[25:42] that Revelation 71 after these things I
[25:45] saw four Angels standing on the four
[25:46] corners of the Earth holding the Four
[25:48] Winds of the earth that the wind should
[25:50] not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor
[25:52] on any tree and I saw another Angel
[25:54] ascending from the East having the Seal
[25:56] of the Living God he cried with a v a
[25:59] loud voice to the four angels to whom it
[26:01] was given to hurt the earth and the Sea
[26:03] saying hurt not the Earth neither the
[26:05] sea nor the trees to we have sealed the
[26:08] Servants of our God in their foreheads
[26:11] and I heard the number of them which
[26:12] were sealed in there were sealed 10040
[26:15] and 4,000 of all the tribes of the
[26:18] children of
[26:19] Israel and he goes through the tribes
[26:21] Judah Reuben Gad Asher napali Manasseh
[26:28] Simeon Levi isachar zebulun Joseph
[26:34] Benjamin all right so that's the that is
[26:37] the 144,000 those are the ones that are
[26:40] sealed with the Holy Ghost right let's
[26:43] go further and look at some more details
[26:45] about that and I looked and lo a lamb
[26:48] stood on Mount Zion and with him 144,000
[26:51] having his father's name written in
[26:53] their foreheads what's the father's name
[26:56] Jesus so they have an in other words
[26:58] they have a
[26:59] revelation of who Jesus of Nazareth is
[27:04] so it's been restored to them and I
[27:06] Heard a Voice from Heaven as the voice
[27:08] of many Waters and as the voice of a
[27:09] great Thunder and I heard the voice of
[27:11] Harpers Harper harping with their Harps
[27:15] and they sung as it were a new song
[27:17] before the throne and before the beasts
[27:19] and the elders and no man could learn
[27:20] that song but the 144,000 which were
[27:23] redeemed from the earth so in other
[27:25] words they they have a re a revelation
[27:28] a new revelation to them brings forth a
[27:32] new song so the same thing happened to
[27:35] Moses the same thing happened to the
[27:37] lamb right they each had a sang a new
[27:41] song because they c grasped a new
[27:44] revelation of what God was doing so and
[27:47] so will we sing a new song when we've
[27:49] got catch the revelation of the message
[27:52] and so they sing this new song because
[27:54] they have the revelation of who Jesus is
[27:56] now we see the details
[28:00] 144,000 from each of the tribes 12,000
[28:03] from each of the tribes will be sealed
[28:07] what does it mean means they receive the
[28:10] revelation of Jesus Christ which brings
[28:12] forth the new birth brings forth the new
[28:15] that now they're entered into the New
[28:17] Covenant where he writes his word in
[28:19] their hearts and in their minds and so
[28:21] now we can go back to what we read
[28:23] before
[28:32] and I will pour upon the House of David
[28:35] and upon upon the inhabitants of
[28:36] Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of
[28:40] supplications and they shall look upon
[28:42] me whom they have pierced and they shall
[28:44] mourn all right so we'll stop we'll stop
[28:48] and leave our comments there so they
[28:52] receive the revelation of who Jesus
[28:54] Christ is they say they look on him whom
[28:57] they have pierced people always ask this
[29:00] how is this going to happen G will Jesus
[29:03] return back and they'll literally
[29:05] physically see them I want to ask the
[29:08] question who is it that's preaching when
[29:11] the 144,000 are sealed amen is it Jesus
[29:15] in a way but how how is Jesus revealed
[29:19] to you today how is the son of man
[29:21] revealed to you in this hour right
[29:24] through a Ministry through brother
[29:27] bram's Ministry it was revealed to us a
[29:30] man in the spirit and power of Elijah so
[29:33] how is Jesus going to be revealed that
[29:35] they pierced him to the the TW tribes of
[29:39] Israel that they're going to receive the
[29:41] Messiah and be born and and mourn
[29:44] they're going to go into
[29:46] mourning why because the two prophets
[29:48] will come God will vindicate their
[29:50] Ministry and they will literally in
[29:52] spirit form look on the one that they
[29:55] pierced not a man with nail scarred
[29:57] hands it's a revelation he writes their
[30:01] names he writes the name of the father
[30:04] in their foreheads that's that's just as
[30:07] good as seeing literally physically the
[30:09] one that they pierced that's no
[30:11] difference because it's by spiritual
[30:12] Revelation anyways even a physical man
[30:15] steps up here and says I'm the one that
[30:17] you pierced you still have to have a
[30:20] spiritual Revelation when Jesus was here
[30:23] and was amongst his disciples everybody
[30:25] just understood no problem it was easy
[30:28] the whole nation was like oh there's the
[30:30] Messiah we get it no even his own
[30:33] disciples didn't get
[30:35] it they were so indoctrinated with a
[30:38] Jewish understanding that despite the
[30:41] spiritual Revelation they had here on
[30:43] oneand Peter says you're the Christ the
[30:46] son of the Living God Jesus says I'm
[30:48] going to go to go to Jerusalem be handed
[30:50] over the chief priests and and crucified
[30:52] and he says it'll never be
[30:55] so and he says Get Behind Me Satan
[30:58] see that's that's the that that's the
[31:01] importance of a
[31:02] revelation without a revelation you'll
[31:05] be a Judas right amen Judas had a
[31:08] natural understanding he could see God
[31:11] is doing something great wow we're going
[31:14] to see the scriptures that that prophesy
[31:17] of our kingdom coming to the Jewish
[31:19] nation and and I'm going to be the guy
[31:22] I'm going to be here and when he didn't
[31:25] fulfill that what was it it was a
[31:28] stumbling block a stumbling Stone he
[31:30] couldn't understand it he couldn't
[31:33] receive it and that's the nation of
[31:34] Israel how could how can they receive it
[31:37] it's by Revelation how can a gentile
[31:40] receive Christ by
[31:42] Revelation it doesn't matter the means
[31:45] that it comes by but it must come as a
[31:48] spiritual Revelation into your soul at
[31:51] something that changes you yes
[31:54] amen what about the nations of the earth
[31:57] there literally going to have Jesus
[31:59] return back and is it going to cause
[32:01] them to
[32:04] repent no they fight
[32:07] him and we'll return we'll return back
[32:10] with him to fight the nations of the
[32:11] earth that's the condition of the heart
[32:14] of man we know that by the gospel we are
[32:17] enemies of God and so how does that
[32:20] change spiritual Revelation how does how
[32:23] is the how is the nation of Israel born
[32:25] in a in a day
[32:29] by spiritual Revelation through two
[32:31] witnesses they'll preach the word God
[32:33] will thoroughly vindicate their Ministry
[32:35] and the people that will receive it will
[32:37] be a
[32:38] Remnant right and all Israel will be
[32:40] saved but not all Israel is Israel right
[32:45] it's the ones God's ultimate purpose was
[32:47] for them to not just have a natural
[32:49] Covenant in a natural land but a
[32:52] spiritual Covenant that he would write
[32:54] his word really if you understand it
[32:56] correctly the new Covenant was not even
[32:58] meant for us right it wasn't for
[33:03] Gentiles the New Covenant he says I'll
[33:05] make a New Covenant with the house of
[33:07] Israel and the house of Judah I will
[33:10] write my word in their hearts and in
[33:12] their minds so how does it come to us
[33:15] because they rejected it they turned
[33:17] away from it and because of their
[33:19] rejecting the New Covenant God turns to
[33:22] the Gentiles and said I'll make my
[33:24] people jealous through the foolish
[33:26] people
[33:29] and that's what he's that's exactly what
[33:30] he's done we're waiting for that
[33:32] jealousy to happen they're still too
[33:35] proud of themselves but there will be a
[33:37] Remnant that will hear the word and they
[33:39] will repent and they'll they'll be have
[33:42] been made jealous and their jealousy
[33:44] will come to its full fruition in
[33:46] Repentance and Revelation amen let's
[33:49] stand we'll
[33:51] pray amen Heavenly Father we thank you
[33:53] so much for your word Lord help us Lord
[33:56] to walk in it to live it Lord knowing
[33:58] the hour that we're living in the
[34:00] lateness of the day and how you're about
[34:02] to bring all things to pass Lord that
[34:05] you have spoken we commit ourselves and
[34:08] the service today into your hands Lord
[34:10] be glorified in our midst we ask in
[34:12] Jesus name amen
