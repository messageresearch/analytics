TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] do do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music] amen ready is it to my own okay um let's all uh stand and have a word of prayer and your lord i want to invite you into our midst this morning and as you anoint my my own tongue that i would be able to speak to the people what you put on my heart and i went the areas that they'd be able to hear and asked it you'd make it so it's not just some some information for these people but that they'd be able to take something from it that would help them throughout the day and then they would live closer to you because of it yes he's in jesus name amen um we want to go ahead and turn to revelations chapter 17. and in verse 1. and there came one of the seven angels which um uh the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come heather i will show thee unto thee the judgment of the great that sitteth upon many waters um with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication and then skipping down to verse 15 and he saith unto me the waters which thou sawest where the horses are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast these shall hate the and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire for god hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will and to agree and give their kingdom unto the beast until the words of god shall be fulfilled and the woman which thou sawest is the great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth now uh y'all can be seated um we want to pick up from where we were last uh last time and where we got to last time was i kind of did a little history class and we kind of see how a lot of what we're seeing today is is um in terms of uh things like uh critical theory that's where we ended was i gave a quick little definition of critical theory where it's it's cultural communism and how we we know that this is very popular uh today that it's it's a huge issue um and it's even seeping into the churches and things like that where we we on the first class that we did um with uh sort of these things being accepted by the baptist church and the presbyterian church and how that there was a parallel there with the social gospel movement back in the early 1900s well i want to kind of wrap up um sort of where we are in terms of social issues um because i mentioned this before something called um critical queer theory now this is an actual people think oh let's you use the word queer well that's the actual terminology that they use it's actual academic term um and i don't want to spend too much time on this because i feel like the lord is kind of shifting my direction here but um the this is sort of the pinnacle of where critical theory ends up um it's the complete degeneration of any sort of moral fabric or or instant sort of um uh objective standard of morality um i want to read actually excuse me a um a quote from an academic paper this was published in i believe 2017 though i think it was republished in 2018 in a different journal as well and this uh academic article i mean this is peer-reviewed so this is the all the universities have rubber stamped this as coin of the realm this is as good as it gets this is taken as serious as a heart attack in congress this is the cutting edge of academic thought in this realm and the title of this article is queer futurity and childhood innocence beyond the in injury of development now that is a mouthful of a title and i could spend 20 minutes breaking that down alone and but i just want to read the first two paragraphs of this so you can kind of see what what the what queer theory is really trying to push and so it starts here in 1991 eve sedgwick published an essay that may be said to have initiated contemporary queer theories consideration of childhood as a site of heteronormative intervention it's always open season on gay kids the late queer theorist famously quipped in an article that was audaciously titled how to bring your kids up gay sedgwick contended that desire for non-gay outcome was pervasive in how adults deal with the appearance of non-normative gender or sexual desire in childhood advice on how to help your kids turn out gay not to mention your students parishioners your therapy clients or your military subordinates sedgwick suggested is less ubiquitous than you might think she was concerned with the amount of interferences being made into young lives that aimed to straighten out their futures was disturbed by large amounts of suicides and uh and brought the helping professions to task for their catastrophic support for beliefs that queer childhood was not viable or healthy now that's might that's a lot of big words and that's a kind of a little bit of word salad um but and i don't want to spend too much time on it but the bottom line of that is that is the there's nothing less than the 21st century mob of sodom and gomorrah um demanding the angels right which is whatever's pure and innocent and god-like the innocent thing that's within a child they're demanding that to make it like them they they can't let kids be kids they can't just assume that kids will grow up to be normal healthy adults with normal healthy desires they have to psychologically manipulate kids into this way of thinking okay because and and i could that's just the first couple paragraphs of that article as you read down into it um i mean she's they're openly talking about how you know we need to treat all kids as if they're all queer and queer is now the the standard and um you know they talk about destroying the heteronormative right heterosexual and normal they believe that that's a bad thing right and we have to tear it all down so we know that i mean this is the this is it's sodom and gor sodom and gomorrah manifested in the 21st century now the thing is this isn't this isn't a big secret it's not a mystery it's not like message people are the only no people who know this is going on um half the country knows this is what's going on um you have um if you look at the the recent virginia election the governor of virginia virginia just won the election based almost entirely on him just making a promise that he's going to get this stuff out of the schools the governor of florida is getting huge popularity across the country for also proposing legislation that they're going to ban this stuff you're seeing a massive reaction to this what what sort of in popular media and popular uh culture they're recognizing it as communism they're recognizing they're going back and seeing the founding writings about this and they're they're scared about it people are terrified of this new wave of communism that's coming in um and um there's also a um you're seeing it especially the younger generation i remember back in 2015 when uh they the supreme court effectively nationally legalized gay marriage in the u.s remember a lot of people were all like you know religious folks and especially people were all horrified like oh it's sodom and gomorrah i remember thinking back then because i was in college and i saw i was seeing all the queer theory stuff back then and most people had no idea anything about that and i'm thinking oh you all have no idea what's coming like like it's there's something come that you don't you can't even believe but now now that it's sort of manifested i'm also seeing a reaction in the younger people people who grew up because you got to think eve sedgwick wrote that paper you know how to bring your kids up gay in 1991 that's older than i am right this is this is my generation grew up with that we we grew up knowing what the results of that is we know that in in the trans community there's like a 60 suicide rate you push kids down that road it's not going to end well right there's it's it's catastrophe too many people in my generation know what in what lies down that road and they're they're reacting to it you saw this with um uh there's a for instance there i saw some data um where they this is from an organization called glad um it's kind of an activist group but they do they do some polling data and they did they have the um accelerating acceptance uh poll that they do um every year it's like a report where they get the sort of the national opinions on lgbtq by the way you have you ever noticed that they started adding letters to that acronym and the queue stands for queer by the way um and also there's a plus at the end of it a lot of times because there's actually the acronyms like 30 letters long now um but the they did a a survey and part of the survey was how what percentage of non lgbtq 18 to 34 year olds identify themselves as queer or gay allies in 2016 it was 63 percent of 18 to 34 year olds as of 2018 it is 45 okay the younger generations are starting to have a shift um is this especially pronounced among young young men um in 2016 it was 62 percent and as of 2019 i'm sorry was this yeah 2018 i'm sorry it was 35 so you're seeing a massive shift almost that entire shift in the total numbers was entirely to young men who are bailing out of the critical theories the the the um sort of the gay acceptance movement like no no this is something sinister here and we don't want any part of it and so what i'm seeing especially in young men amongst young men is there's a massive shift back towards conservatism christian conservatism especially you saw this with the rise of jordan peterson okay he's more or less a secular guy but he uses the bible and um just general christian principles to to get young men to be responsible and and just teaches them general christian values which honestly can help people um even if you sort of remove the supernatural bible it's still the truth right and it'll still help people but it's not going to get them to heaven right um and so you're seeing this you're also seeing like i mentioned people in the in the religious communities um they're also seeing this they're fighting back i was actually after i did that first um uh sunday school i was listening to some i was actually a baptist commentator who was talking about the the critical theory stuff coming up in the baptist church and he even recognized the parallels with the social gospel movement back in the 1900s everybody's seeing this stuff and and in the churches they're going wait a minute we have to save society right the even the muslims are saying they're seeing it pop up there and they don't want it the buddhists are saying that it's popping up there they don't want it all the denominations are getting attacked with this this new marxism it's it's communism economism communism attacking the country that was the big drive of jordan peterson stuff as young men you got to be you know take individual responsibilities so you can not be sucked in into the communist move that's sweeping the land and so listen what we need to do is have a an organization we'll unite all the churches under one under one banner to fight communism right there all the denominations all the different fates are creating inter-faith organizations to fight back against communism and so i want to read a quote um oh one other thing i wanted to mention there seems to be especially amongst the young men a i've heard a lot of social commentators talking about how they're not christian but they're taking their kids to church because they're their new parents you know we'll take our kids to church because we understand that if we give them christian values they won't be sucked into communism they won't be preyed upon by the stuff that the the critical theory that's being taught in schools it's you know there it's it is a political move disguised as a as a religious one okay the but it's just going the other direction and so it seems to me what i'm seeing is you're seeing young people going well we don't want to be part of this so we're going to go join the church we don't really believe in god but we do want christian values we do want the structure that the church brings and so um i want to read this this this uh quote um this is from end time evangelism it says but it's america we could go back and show that right here that it's supposed to be in this nation that comes up where there's no waters no peoples that what he's talking about there are no waters that was a reference to what we read in revelations chapter 17. um comes up like a lamb got two little horns civil and ecclesiastical power but they unite together through political powers a new president we got bringing in rome again i want anybody to tell me any theologian here or anywhere else where the bible ever predicts that communism will rule the world don't you fear communism there's nothing to it it's a bogus thing that god is using to chase the nations with it chasing them chasing the nation sure the bible says rome will rule the world look at king and king nebuchadnezzar his dream his vision daniel's interpretation how every one of them kingdoms and dispensations hit just perfect and right down to the end there was rome so it's going to be rome it isn't going to be communism they're just figureheads that's all they'll never go nowhere no they won't so when i'm looking at the way things are going on one hand we could see that okay maybe things are going off in in this direction of sort of this neo-marxist agenda and you know i'm no prophet but personally i think that the devil's playing chess not checkers and he's giving the whole world something to be so scared of giving all the religious people of the world something to be terrified of so they'll run from the communists right into the arms of the pope right you're seeing um young sort of the the half the country is so scared of because once you get down into the whole gender theory stuff you get into things like um map if you ever hear that acronym stands for minor attracted persons this is a fancy uh i'll say propaganda term that basically means a pedophile um where they're they're merging which if you pay attention to that that um that title i read for that academic paper at the end of it is beyond the injury of development okay they're wanting to introduce sexual activity to children right because it's part of their political agenda right so this is you're seeing this merger there where you you now have a bunch of republicans going oh we got to save the kids we got to save the kids from this this this ideology that crushes anyone who stands against it and and might abuse them sexually so we're going to run to the catholic church what right good job escaping the frying pan folks um the this is the point is both of them end in the exact same thing they're both will both crush you in the end for dissension they both end up destroying the innocence of children they both have the same spirit because they're both run by the same devil right it's the devil playing both sides that's all it is it's the gospel of the evil age is realistically it's just anything that turns your head from the actual gospel right it's anything that's going to give you oh okay so you have you have a particular political leaning oh you think that um we need to have all sort of you know the the acceptance movement and and all the social activism and sort of the woke movement okay the devil's got good news for you okay because that's what the gospel means it's good news we've got good news for you there's a there's a church there's an organization that'll accept that if you want if you hate that you want to turn the other direction well the devil's got good news for you too right it's it's all just there's there's a it's a lie in both directions and it ends in the same catastrophe right but where does that leave us right because we don't want either side of that we're not part of this we're not we're not here for the devil's good news we understand that we do have good news we have actual good news right huh you've heard the term the sensation sweeping the nation well we have the sensation rejected by every nation nobody wants it and it's the one thing they all need right and is it is you know so satan has his gospel for this evil age but we have also a gospel for this age right it's it's um i wish i had i forgot to put the the rest of that that quote that i read in there but brother branham goes on to talk about how it'll get dark at the end time and the end time message will be perfect for that it'll be the end time message will be catered specifically to the end time darkness it won't be we won't need um uh some new thing because it's the same gospel is the gospel of this age because of the gospel of every age before it was the gospel when there was nothing but in the universe but a thought right and it'll still be the gospel when there's nothing left but dustin echoes right it'll still it's it's a timeless gospel it's an eternal gospel right and so we can we can say with with a certainty that we have good news and it is our duty to not just uh sit on that spread it as far and wide as we can the people if anyone is going to escape i mean i i was i put down you know if i could sum up what is the gospel in a in a sentence just like so many people before you would say john 3 16 right that's the gospel it's the good news that god so loved the world that you know and not i mean you think the world it's a tiny little speck an insignificant speck in the grand cosmos why did god love that in particular it's a you know they took pictures from space and there's this great speech by sagan who said oh it's a little blue dot that all of humanity is summed up in that tiny little speck insignificant spec well why did god love that world so much that he decided to die for it right what was it about that insignificant little dust mote that was so special because there was people there who would believe right there was people there who would not perish you don't have to perish with the gospel of the critical fears you don't have to perish with the gospel of of the catholicism and the and the and all the the myriad of denominations that spawned from it right there's there's there is good news that you don't have to um remain part of this train wreck that's going to go up in flames there is a way out and the way out is to not be associated with any of it to understand that we're not we're not uh condemned to this false choice you don't have to choose either side right too many people and i mean i'm probably a little too invested in politics myself and it's too tempting to see all the all the the the communism that pops up today and gets all up in arms about it and all been out of shape and oh it's such a travesty well it is a travesty it's wrong but that doesn't mean that you should also get caught up in the other side either right they're both a trap and the gospel is the good news of this age is that there is a third option right there's the god option and to understand that this world is not our home it is we're not from here we're not going to stay here we're going back to where we came from and uh that i suppose is the gospel and um i guess we're gonna actually end it there about three minutes early than what we're supposed to so and you can spend a little more time uh enjoying yourselves thank you so much and um we'll stand and have a word of prayer dear lord thank you for this opportunity to share what you've given me to the people ask that would bless the people and that it wouldn't just be my words or my ideas but that it would have it would help the people to to recognize the day that they live in and that they would be able to take this and apply it to where they live and and and and walk more perfectly in your light we ask these things in jesus name amen [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] you
