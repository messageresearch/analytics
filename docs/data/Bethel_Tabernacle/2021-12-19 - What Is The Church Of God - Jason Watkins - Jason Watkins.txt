brad can come into the church or into the brew and just sit down with me and sing the song first and then sit down and tell me about how jesus changed your life amen which by the way brother brad i need to get your number because i need to be able to get in touch with her before service when i'm leading the songs so i can ask her before yes i don't put her on the spot which i don't think she felt like she was on the spot but amen now i'm on the spot because like it just changed the atmosphere and i'm grateful for it amen let's all stand together we're going to change over the order of the service amen i'd like to bring out brother jason now to minister the word which is the most important part of the service amen we enjoy worshiping and singing and clapping our hands but the most important part of the worship is the word going forth and changing our lives like sister sarah sung about so let's sing that song let your word be born do we have the the do we have the verses for that brother matt amen [Music] let's start with the chorus [Music] the manger of my heart let it live in me let it start live inside this house of clay and mold it every day let you work [Music] my [Music] in the heart of my heart let it live in me let it start live inside [Music] [Applause] [Music] not much to behold i'm hardly a place for his word to unfold but if i'll just yield this vessel

this morning he's worthy of it hallelujah [Applause] god bless you you can be seated momentarily amen we got a wonderful special fun all of that combined amen one of my favorite things to do is uh dedicate newborns into uh you know dedicating them back to the lord amen i believe that you know the bible shows us that children are the heritage of the lord and you just have to remember it's in vital that you remember as parents you don't own them man you're their caretaker assigned by god to train them up in his ways and uh but they belong to the lord they're his heritage in the earth and so we're going to be delayed okay you're waving at me i thought i'm not dedicating you i'm just why you okay no worries we can wait it out i got a few announcements to make amen praise the lord amen brother branham when he was dedicating grandchildren they walked up it took him so long to get to him and he kept apologizing for that but we want to we'll get to that just in a moment let me make a couple quick announcements and then also we have a few uh prayer requests sister chastity's in need of prayer today and uh the enemy battling her also uh brother jack let us know okay fine so i get to be excited for next week praise the lord that's okay amen praise the lord so we'll get to that next week uh but as a as a as a as a reminder we want to go to prayer for sister chastity also brother jack let me know that um sister kathy just the devil battling her um that cough just persistent and last couple days a little bit of fever um but uh she feels fine otherwise they're doing good amen but um he said i would i will be amen loud down here uh amen so uh brother jack we're gonna be counting on those amens amen all the way across the airwaves well i know that i'm just kidding no this is kathy so i'm definitely confused today sister but happy to have you so is it jack that's sick is it jack that has the cough okay brother jack amen amen praise the lord my son jonathan's always saying dad you read into it you don't read each word amen no that's still the message i'm getting amen well it's a little jacked up but but but anyway brother jack we'll be counting on those amens and we're happy to have your queen here with us today and we're not having a baby dedication but we are going to pray for brother jack and we are going to pray for uh sister chastity amen i have that one right brother doug amen praise the lord amen god bless you happy to have you here today daniel i believe it is amen you met sister mom sitting there behind you she's my mother she's our church evangelist she's like evangelist in the in the pilgrims progress she just comes out of nowhere and meets everybody you can't come here as a visitor and not get met by sister jean amen so she doesn't try to she doesn't try to preach but she preaches with her life amen so we appreciate that oh a great deal to her amen i i owe a lot of my ability to express things in story form and make things clear from sister gene i grew up sitting at her knee listening to the stories of the bible amen so we're happy for that also want to remind you besides those prayer requests to remember we're having our new year's eve service you can stand back with me we're going to get ready to go to prayer don't forget that we'll be having our new year's eve service on december 29th i'm sorry december 31st we're moving the wednesday which is on the 29th to friday the 31st last day of the year and it's not a watch night service per se amen but i'm i'm watching for the coming of the lord every day every night all the time amen and and so i i live you know i look for him every morning and i live like he you know that he'll come as a thief the bible says when just at the hour that you don't expect him i remember years ago i think it was brother vale who kind of shocked an audience and i probably did it to get their attention he says now i know the bible says that that you know no man knoweth the day or the hour but i'm going to tell you that the lord did reveal to me the very hour he's coming and everybody was like what and he said the bible says in the hour you think not so we're going to be meeting and we'll be having the lord's supper communion and foot washing at last finally we didn't get to do that last time and so a little bit of a different way we'd like to have our whole entire ministry team give a few minutes of exhortation i intend to take part in that myself we're gonna start with uh i mentioned to you last time we would open with a couple songs and the uh go straight to communion i'm rethinking that a little bit uh feels like i got a voice inside me saying maybe i should preach my portion first which is going to be amended and brief but just uh you know there's as brother kenny was saying there's nothing more important than the ministry of the word because it's the ministry of the word you know that he sent his word and healed the people and so it's the the faith comes by hearing the amen and so so we we realize that the best way is how shall they hear except there be a preacher and how shall he preach unless he be sent so we want to do that and then we'll move into the that's the way i'm thinking now that's still subject to a final decision at the moment i don't always know exactly how the lord wants to do it sometimes till the very minute but uh that's okay and so uh but we're going to have that we want to have a little bit from all of the team and then we want to have the lord's supper and i'll still be aiming to get you out and get you home before the crazy people get on the roads and uh and we'll get you home at a safe decent hour so we're looking forward to that amen we're going to invite you excuse me to the book of first corinthians this morning and as we read our scripture and go to prayer we will take up our prayer requests for brother jack and sister chastity those were the only prayer requests that came in of course we had some wednesday and i'm sure that you are still continuing to pray for those all right first corinthians chapter one and we want to read verses one through nine and i i hope by the help of the lord to bring this thought it's it's a new thought that i finished up my series last wednesday [Music] me and i want to start this again today here a new um little thing i don't know it might be a two or three part i will see how far it goes today i think for sure to be two parts at least but i want to title it what is the church of god what is we say that that's a loose term and what is the church of god how many believe there is one there is now when you say there's a church of god then there's no way to attribute that to something man-made so right away you know that throws out any type of man-made organization that they made the church of god you don't have the church of god until you have the baptism of the holy spirit in the new testament and then you've got the church of god you you have that reference to israel in the wilderness they were called the called out church see in in egypt they were the people of god but once an exodus came then they were the called out church of the wilderness and so we're we want to look at at paul's meaning today what does it mean to be the church of god so what is the church of god verse 1 first corinthians chapter 1 verse 1. paul called to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god and so so so thinnest our brother unto the church of god there it is under the church of god which is at corinth to them that are sanctified in christ jesus and now there's your first marker that's the first id right there of what makes up the church of god them that are sanctified in christ jesus here's your second marker called to be saints not called to be church members called to be saints all right all right with all that in every place call upon the name of jesus christ our lord both theirs and ours so their christian life is a proactive life it's not a just a passive life it's not just a lip service it's a proactive life that seeks to extend in the world from god down into the church through and out of the church into the world you follow that all right i thank my god always on your behalf verse 4 for the grace of god which is given you by jesus christ here's to here's some purpose that in everything ye are enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledge even as the testimony of christ was confirmed in you verse 7 so that ye come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our lord jesus christ who shall also confirm you unto the end aren't you glad for that that you may be blameless in the day of our lord jesus christ so you know something friends i've said to you repeatedly that i know sometimes you you you battle your weaknesses you're wearied with your weaknesses and you have all of these weaknesses don't worry you won't have after a while i know we all have our ups and downs we're like elijah man of like passions prophet said that mean he had his ups and downs you know there's no none good no not one it's only christ see there's only one elected son and that's christ i was in him therefore i'm elected with him see it's not the man that comes predestinated it's the gene of god that's inside him all right this is all for his glory it says not to make us anything we're the servants of the lord happy and rejoicing that we've been called to this wonderful privilege a privilege it is indeed who shall also confirm you unto the end that you may be blameless in the day of our lord jesus christ god is faithful by whom you were called unto the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord father we thank you for your word today i thank you for your anointing which we already feel i thank you for the presence that i felt lord just such an anointing dropping down in my office as brother ken began to open his worship service lord i just found myself with hands in the air and tears screaming and walking through the office oh your presence lord it's what i long for god just to have your presence here today father i pray that you will come now lord and reveal your word i've just followed you out here that's all i've that's all i know to do and i stand here now with plenty lord of notes and material and things that we've studied together you and i uh over weeks now watching knowing this series was coming and but yet lord today i find that i just want you to come and be the speaker lord let it have its mark may the arrow of deliverance find its mark in the hearts of your people lord and set captives free bind up broken hearts lord heal wounds o god set at liberty them that are captive them who all their life lord face nothing but certain death you are the giver of life today now be real among us we pray thee in jesus name lord we're asking for brother jack and sister chastity today who couldn't be here among us but they are here in spirit lord and they're no doubt streaming and listening and rejoicing with us and their hearts are ready our hearts are ready now lord all of our attention and our minds we dismiss all the thoughts of yesterday and the cares of tomorrow and we're here for just a little short time to focus on what you want to say to us i commit myself into your hands to that end in jesus christ's name amen god bless you friends you can be seated amen praise the lord and and so also another visitor here god bless you young man happy to have you here today and to different ones of you we've got a number of folks who are out of town and we want to be uh praying for them the lord will give them a blessed wonderful time guide them back home to us safely amen you know it's a wonderful thing to be the church of the living god it's not it doesn't i mean i i want you to grasp today on how rare that is and how rare you are to be able to believe for many have desired a lot of times uh people have have expended entire life their entire life i mean if you go back and look at the clearest example that we see in the days of our lord when he was here in his earthly pilgrimage that he confronted a religious society that had since the days those men since the days of their childhood had been reared and trained in the law of moses and the word of god and had dedicated their lives to the degree that you literally couldn't touch their life with an accusation they were men who had to just walk constantly flawlessly because the slightest little deviation would disqualify them from their service and even could even end up in their death thank you brother kenny could even end up in their death hey i may want you to come back at the end and sing that song again i loved that that was just boy that's that set me right i was telling sister debbie i had such i was out of sorts all morning i couldn't figure out why i was up early and slept good and and all i mean just everything that that should have made it a smooth morning was in play but i just was out of sorts and so uh that song just kind of fixed me amen i'm so thankful to the lord but uh we and i and i had a really nice time here brother matt came with me and we were preaching to the church there in new zealand we had i actually got to preach it here on a zoom call from live so i'm my voice is a little bit wrung out from that sermon and i was using some of this material that in this series not nothing i'm going to cover today but a different same mountain different side of it and i was preaching it to them and i was telling them now i haven't preached this anywhere and i'm not even preaching to my own church you're not going to get it today either but you might get it in a couple more services we'll see but this is the portion i didn't cover with them this is what the lord has led me uh today for bethel tabernacle so thinking about what it means to be the church of god paul called to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god unto the church of god which is at corinth you know this opportunity that we have to be children of god should not be a small thing in our minds it shouldn't be something that we just take for granted because you know as i was saying here these men in the o in in jesus day had dedicated their whole lives by the thousands of them had dedicated their lives and and yet jesus let them know that all of their life and all of their ministry and all of their faithfulness uh to that actually uh that that he said you're everyone dead you can't even hear the true word when it comes that i'm standing here you have no problem i can reach in my pocket and i can pull out a penny and i could hold it right here and ask you whose image and superscription is this you have no problem saying that's caesar you can see the image of caesar and here's the image of god and you don't recognize it what a contrast caesar i know god i don't know and and jesus was saying why is it that you can't understand my words my word has no place in you and he began identifying these men by the thousands who had dedicated their lives to a certain standard and it was all vanity because because inside down in their hearts they were like uh jesus attributed them like a graveyard like graves that housed dead people and and there was no markers to make it obvious that you were walking across the dead because there was no tombstones and he likened them to that he was saying people think that you're officers of the kingdom of heaven they think that you have access to god and they move among you hearing your words but you teach for doctrine the commandments of men and you refuse the living word when it comes you're you're like graves that men walk over and don't know that they're walking over dead bones see and then you get another group who's standing off and you know they're offended by that he's letting one group have it and here comes another denomination and they they they see him going after this denomination and they speak up for their denomination they said you know are are we are we the same also and you know and jesus turns to them and he's got a word for them too he says you know you know it's it's amazing that that that had you that if you actually were blind because i just said to this group you're blind and now you're saying to me are we blind too he says well actually if you were blind then you would have a little bit of an excuse you could actually have a leg to stand on at your at your trial when you come up before god to say well i was blind i didn't know he said however since you have so much audacity as to claim you see then god's going to hold you accountable and you're going to be judged as liars so so so this is why the bible says of the last day church whatever you do whatever you do don't be lukewarm you'd be better to just be a cold sinner and come to god and ask for mercy and say lord i'm sorry and i'm i'm no good and i'm i'm not worth anything but i'm asking for your mercy because the bible says god is oftentimes merciful and who can say david said who could say maybe he would have mercy even when it looked like he wouldn't have mercy i'm here to tell you there has been many times down through the era of mankind where it looked like no way is god going to be merciful until he was and and people who were so undeserving of it they were they were deserving only of slaughter and god had mercy but but so if you're going to come you're going to be a if you're going to be a christian be a real one be one on fire be one who the holy spirit has a direct access to so that you can serve your purpose of why he's put you here and saved you don't be a half-baked one see so brother branham makes a statement in the exposition of the seven church ages to the pergament age he has a concern and his concern is this that he says i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst that's a sobering question it's a sobering statement i wonder he says he's asking a question within himself and it becomes a questioning statement to us as believers today i wonder i i would like for you as as you sit here today and patiently hear somebody preach the gospel i want you to go in your mind and in your heart for just to take a moment i don't need anyone to raise their hand or stand up and make a declaration but i maybe it would be good if when we're trying to consider what is the true church then that begs the question am i a member of it because i'm not just here to try to give you a definition of the church what i'm trying to get you to go to to i want you to go to this place in your mind and in your heart am i that church and am i in position that and am i serving the reason that i'm part of the church see as we were showing last time how that you you've been called to the priesthood remember you're a royal priesthood chosen called to that see so we've been called now not just under a partial service there were some priests that only had a partial ministry but the high priest he was fully qualified for the entire temple service and so in fact as he went further than anybody he went all the way into the shekinah into the presence and we're called under the order of melchizedek which means you're called under the royal order of a high priest which means you're supposed to have full access and your whole life should be a constant uh a constant tool in the hands of god to bring worship to bring atonement to bring satisfaction to make god pleased see and so we were saying to you we're invited to be a partaker in the entire worship service in the old testament the entire the entire temple service you're a temple now you're the temple and you're you're called by the holy spirit to you're not you're not called by the holy spirit to just be in the church queue to just be a name on a book to just be have a uh uh you know a a lip service i'm a christian you'd be surprised how many million say that you know you look in jesus day how many said we have moses and we believe jehovah and jesus said then why are you dead if that's true why don't you receive me moses wrote of me abraham saw me here i am moses told you a prophet would come like him a man full of the spirit of god haven't i proved it if you don't believe my words believe the works they testify to you but you can't believe it because the bible has said that that that their eyes they have closed their eyes it wasn't that god closed them mankind who didn't want to be responsible to god closed their eyes and therefore god gave them over to their blind to their own blindness when you do that that's what he'll do he offers every man a legitimate chance brother jd was covering that in our saturday men's bible study breakfast that that every man gets a legitimate chance it's it's not a facetious thing it's a completely legit chance but but you know uh it's what he does with that choice now that's different from his elected family who didn't choose him at all he chose them they were elected before the foundation of the world but i'm just the point is that god gives everybody a chance save yourself from this untoward generation and their eyes they have closed he said lest at any time seeing with their eyes and hearing with their ears they believe and then be healed be converted and i have to heal them see and so so we realize that god set the pattern in genesis that he had one provided way abel found it cain refused it abel discovered it and he lined his sacrifice up with that revelation he followed god's way of redemption cain saw it just as clear but but to cain it never became a living reality and even god in his mercy to to a seed of the serpent literally says listen you know he's basically saying you're never going to get the revelation your brother has but but nonetheless if you'll just honor him and honor his lifestyle and try to emulate the way he does it and bring me a sacrifice like he did then i'll find a place for you cain i'll i'll save you and i'll help you i don't want anybody i take no pleasure in the death of even sinners but you must conquer him cain send lieth at the door sin is crouching he's waiting to spring he's you know we're waiting your decision cain see the only listen cain the only decision to be made god is saying to him the only decision to be made here is yours because you already know mine but be careful because sin is crouching sin is waiting to spring and if you if you refuse see that you refuse not him that speaketh but if you do refuse sin will take a leap and he'll have you and you'll never get free so so so see that you refuse not him when he speaks amen don't provoke him that way as as as the old testament saints warned and paul picks up that same warning when the gospel comes to you realize how how blessed how blessed it is that god would call you from a life of sin because you couldn't save yourself you were born dying there was no way you could save yourself and if he didn't have mercy on you there's nothing you could do no amount of righteousness would ever earn you that you've got to come god's provided way and so today don't sit here and and be insufficiently impressed with what god has done to you and for you and is trying to do through you and he sent a message to us and he's demonstrated it with power and demonstration of the holy spirit there should be no doubt in your mind what the message can do in a fallen human if given the chance there's enough godly saints just in this little church alone to say nothing of them of the tens of thousands and millions around the world there's enough evidence to that you should be able to know today say what they want but there's no way to to doubt the vindication of this message it's too supernatural it's been proven too many times and and and and at least the last but not least is what it does to the lives of men and women and how it sets us up in the image of god and causes us to love the word all over the word and to be able to say and willing to say amen to every word even the parts that skin us even the parts that pinch us and even the parts we know we don't get exactly right but in our heart we always want to get it right see that's that's the true word so he says i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed and i i have such a burden on my heart as this year ends we don't know how many more years we'll have we don't know it's not given to us to know we know that there's a finite number we know that it can't just keep going on we do know the ages have ended we do know the last message has come we do know the sign of the son of man melchizedek has already been demonstrated to the world and that was the last thing the gentiles would see before the before they're taken from the earth in a rapture and the anointing of the eagle lives flies east picks up moses and elijah and goes to the 144 000. brother brahm said then then then the church would be left in its cold formal creeds and denomination deadness and said they'll just have they'll they'll get a fair trial everybody will they'll get a fair trial but i i don't want i'd rather i'm afraid i'll lose at my trial because i don't have enough good works and i got too many problems i'd rather just be counted in christ and that way when i get here he'll say have a seat on the throne because you gave your life to christ and identified you in the death burial and resurrection of christ your sins came before you and they were met in christ you're already innocent get on the throne but some men sins follow them and they have to give an account for it there because they didn't give it to christ see and so it when christ cannot be the uh a propitiation for everybody he he his his life was a propitiation for the whole world he died for the sins of the whole world but if you won't let him be amen uh uh remember a pardon is only a pardon if it be received as a pardon see so when he says here i wonder i want you to answer it within your heart today having me having sit here and i've i've taken my first 15 minutes just showing you uh what god has done in our in our in this hour and what god is moving and i want i want to add have you asked your own self in your own deepest heart are you sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst and what it came to do are you are you say well how would i know what's the measuring standard how will i know if i'm sufficiently i'm impressed but how will i know if i'm sufficiently impressed if you're allowing it to operate in your life because then you're when you allow it to operate in your life you're basically you're basically saying once i met christ the word i decided i didn't want to be me anymore i wanted to be him see but if you still want to be you and you just want to have him as a buddy you just want him on your social media feed and that's really all he is to you just a god of convenience like a vending machine you get in trouble you say a quick prayer you drop 50 cent in the machine get a pack of crackers you know or or or are you you write a letter to santa claus some believer in your family say hey can y'all pray for me see what's the matter with your prayers see see so are are you sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst unto the church of god which is at corinth to them that are sanctified in christ jesus i don't know how far i'll get today but i'm going to stop it at a decent time so just bear with me it's a little bit of a teaching called to be saints not called to just be church members called to be saints so that all in every place that call upon the name of jesus christ our lord that my life is to accomplish that that that that in every place that all in every place call upon the name of jesus christ our lord this word church of course is a familiar greek word to us it's ecclesia it means the called out and now i want to point out some things that uh some observations i made studying this i found first of all that that that that this is the only church here at corinth of all of his other letters when he wrote to galatian you know when he wrote to the hebrews when he wrote to the romans when he when he he wrote to the church at thessalonica all the various places in his letters his pastoral letters to timothy and to titus his letter to philemon and all these different uh letters that paul wrote that only to the church at corinth did he use this term addressing them as the church of god see it's the it's the only church that paul directly greeted using the phrase the church of god now there are a few times a few other times two or three to be exact where the term is used in a broader sense he's preaching in acts 20. take heed there for unto yourselves into all the flock this is in ephesus over he remember he got off the boat and the leaders met him the last time they were going to see him he said you won't see my face again and in this sermon he says you know he's he's giving them um you know uh preaching to them admonishing them take heed therefore unto yourselves into all the flock over which the holy ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of god which he hath purchased with his own blood so it's just a general sense uh god has made you overseers over the church of god in his pastoral letter to timothy first timothy 3 5 for if if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the church of god and so and then and then in galatians he says in galatians 1 13 for ye have heard of my conversation in times past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it so there's a few times where he he uses it generally speaking and it caught my attention in galatians 1 and 13 where he says in times past in the jews religion and i thought wow think about that he was a a pharisee of the pharisees he was the super jew he was like the ultimate jew and now he he's trying to he's trying to demonstrate in his language a clear cut line from his former spirituality he's basically saying i'm nothing like i used to be in my former spirituality among the jews even i am a hebrew but and i and i worship god according to the religion of the jews i was like the chief jew but i'm here to tell you that now that i'm a christian my spiritual life is nothing at all like it was before i am a completely unique individual i worship at a whole new level i mean 21st century that would have been politically incorrect that would have been offensive he'd have got canceled for saying that that's anti-semitic you know we're all the same no we're not no we're not god loves everybody but i'm here to tell you god has a family that come out of his loins and they and and and they didn't even choose god they didn't even make a choice god jesus said you haven't chosen me i've chosen you see and christians believers and unbelievers are not the same they're not related they're not third cousins fifth cousins tenth cousins 14 times removed you're either an unbeliever or you're a believer there's no halfway if you're a half christian you're a hundred percent an unbeliever see you're a hundred percent unconverted all right so he's in times past in the jews religion so he's he's making this clear-cut line from his former faith now you know maybe maybe the church at corinth needed a constant reminder of who exactly they were that's my much my thinking on it when i when i have and i've been for weeks examining this question who is the church what is it what's its purpose what's its function what is its characteristics what is it accomplishing how do you get in it how do you know you're in it and but then i was always you know this question that was always in my mind why corinth it's the only church see in some of the other ones it's to the saints which be add or to them that are called be at but but only to corinth does he say to the church of god and and i and i concluded that you know there was something about corinth maybe they had the same problem that brother branham is referring to in the pergameon church age i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst and i have to and i i feel the need under the unction of the holy spirit to remind us why we're here what's our purpose what's it all about and so he's coming now to corinth and he's saying you're the church of god i need to remind you corinth the church at corinthia i need to remind you i feel the need i don't i don't i didn't start any of my other letters i didn't address galatia like this i didn't i didn't agree addressed the hebrews or the romans like this i didn't write to thessalonica like this i'm only coming to you and i'm gonna do it twice in my first letter and i'm gonna do it again in my second letter first and second corinthians to the church of god you need to be reminded corinthia of exactly who you are see now that makes a little bit of sense knowing their characteristics we know a little bit about corinthian i'll get to that in a minute so the church of god we we showed you what it means uh to be the church uh ecclesia i wanted to make a point on that where did i go oh yeah so all right so we did we made that point so now it's the church it's not just a church but it's the church of god and this is theos in the in the greek it's a masculine noun meaning god now we know that brother jason we know that we know who god is we know why it would be called the church of god but you need to understand the the aim of the holy spirit behind using the language that they did because there's not one word in here that's an accident every word every jot and tittle every iota every punctuation everything heavens and earth will pass away but not one word will ever fail see and so every word is purposely inserted by god as he moved on holy men of old and and the reason i make a point of this theos as being a masculine noun meaning god is because originally remember in the greek world of ridge which was the heathen world right only israel had a concept of the true and living god the rest of the world were heathens all right but we find then that that that originally this word theos was actually used by the heathens it was actually used by the heathens to describe their gods and they had all kinds of different ideas of gods and demons and angels and multiple various polytheistic beliefs but but when we're when we come down and the once the new testament church came into being then then the apostles took their authority to rest that word from the world and say uh-uh that's not what that word should be applied to because there are no other gods but the true god and so we realize that in that in times past it had been used by the heathen but in the new testament it became known as the name of the true god i know you heathens you've got an idea of gods and demons and angels paul stood at mars hill and said you've got a tomb you're so you're so hedonistic you build a tomb to the unknown god just so you don't accidentally leave one out how ridiculous that is he says however i'm gonna i'm gonna use it for my text today and i'm gonna tell you i'm met the unknown god he's unknown to you but i know him and i want to tell you about him i met him on the road to damascus a great light knocked me off the saddle and then today i am his apostle see so so now when it when when paul is saying i'm writing to the church of god you need to understand how much emphasis how much purpose was behind that how much uh uh narrowly defining ideology that paul was saying i'm not just i'm not using the church of god in a loose term that everybody can claim and everybody can misunderstand and anybody can put it on their church no no no no no i'm telling you that there is an exact church of god amen it's very narrowly defined see it's the only provided way that god has and so so you know a first takeaway from paul using this term to me a first takeaway is that paul needs to remind the believers at corinth that their lives were to be a guiding example to everyone else around him that's contained that's his usage of the word that you need to understand corinth i'm calling you they must have had a problem in this there must have been a deficit he don't have to do that to any other church he he but he comes and we find out that he's he's making a clear distinction to say listen you're the church of god not not an idea of god not a half true understanding not an almost understanding but there is an exact understanding and you're called to that purpose and i need to remind you corinth i need to remind you that your lives your lifestyle and the light you're supposed to be a light to the world and you're therefore your life should be a guiding example to everyone around you what it means to really be the church of god to guide others from the heathenism and the misunderstanding of who they thought god was to make clear who the true god was what he was like his true nature his true characteristics and what he expected when they heard what he expected of humanity when they heard of the sufferings of christ this was the this was the responsibility of the believers that when people heard of the sufferings of christ that that that the people had an example to look at to say so the sufferings of christ came to bring me from heathenism to you people yes exactly it's to take you from unbelief and and make you like christ we're only like we are because his life lives in us we were as no good as you were at one time and we're still have no worthiness in our own self but but christ our we're trying to tell you it's not just a teaching what we're here to demonstrate to you is that his literal life will come down and live inside you so it won't just be theology it won't just be something human this is going to be not natural this is going to be supernatural see to make it clear that should be considered friends i think that should be considered in our lesson today one of the first and perhaps foremost things we need to remind ourselves of today especially today especially today because we are here and we are filled with his spirit how many believe you're the church of god that you're filled with his spirit six of you how many believe you're the church of god filled with his spirit half of you how many believe i mean if you if half of you don't believe you're that i need to change my text and go to john 3 16 and preach a preach a sinner's sermon how many believe that you're the church of god filled with his spirit and how many are happy to be say i'm happy to have his life inside me it to me i wasn't living until his life came inside me see so then so then we're here we're filled with his spirit to set the record straight from the false narrative that the world is fed on today and especially today i was so appreciating brother matt's uh final installment in that thought i suppose it's his final installment uh you know there were so many good points to be made but to me the the real the real i mean the target where because you you realize that that what is happening is is satan is just playing he's just playing the world and it doesn't matter which side of the political law you stand on you you've got you've got a nation rising up and even people who were formally in their in their leftist wokest wokism socialism communism and and and trying to take care of all that you've got some of them going i don't want anything to do with that this is ruining my kids teenagers are committing suicide people are dying in record numbers this is a bad way to go everybody's going to run to the church and you know what's going to happen they're going to run right into the arms of mama it literally to defeat communism puts romanism in the driver's seat and brother and said that when he meets west then rome's in the driver's seat and she has been for a while now see ever since the retreat of communism under glasnost and perestroika and the berlin wall comes down ever since that time rome has been maneuvering to take the world to take the world and build an image to the beast with the under the under the authority of america because she's in revelation 13 right listen friends don't be asleep at the switch this is what's happening around us and your life is here to be a shining light to say don't go that way don't go that way hey hey hey everybody don't go that that denominationalism will lead you to the mark of the beast what yes i can prove it by the bible don't go that way come to the real come and be the real church of god see we've got to set the record straight on this false narrative i told brother matt i said that is so important especially that's why i've been emphasizing to the senior youth particularly everybody but particularly the senior youth because that that message of life that gospel of laodicea that gospel of this evil age that that literally is is what they're hearing in the schools they're hearing it uh at work they're they're hearing it they see it on their social media feeds it's it's being put in their face in all kinds of forms of entertainment and there has to be somebody to stand up and set the record straight and say that's not christianity and that's going to be doomed to a devil's hell but there is a way to escape it see so we've got to set the record straight from the from the false narrative about what god is set the record straight on the false narrative of what it means to be a rapture-ready church not in word only but in the power and demonstration of the holy ghost see there are millions of people today the overwhelming majority overwhelming above and beyond running away majority millions times millions times tens of times hundreds of millions of people who take the name of christian but are coming up short of redemption now the bible said it would be that way it's not a surprise that's not a conspiracy that's just the way the bible said it would be that at the end time it would be so close between the the true and the untrue that they look so much so similar that it would even deceive god's elected family if that were possible thank god it's not see and so people who do that their only chance to gain access to heaven if they can gain it at all will be via a tribulation period and then they'll come to trial at the great white throne of judgment in the book of revelation that's not a place i want to be unless i'm seated on the throne with christ so what is the true church not the denomination of course they you have a denomination called the church of god but not not referring to the people they're fine people i know quite a few of them lovely people i wish they would come out of that system before it's too late so we're not talking about the denomination who who took the who took the name of the church of god as a title and actually don't they don't even realize they created an imagery of blasphemy because it now just becomes a blasphemous name see because it doesn't accept the living word and so again now again i'm coming back full circle so it's interesting and notable to me that paul only opens his greeting this way to the saints at corinth perhaps he he didn't feel he could use a more specific title um you know such as in his other letters where he would say unto the saints or unto the chosen or unto this and he didn't feel he could do that in neither first corinthians nor second corinthians this this this this this broader term of course uh is is is is necessary because corinth you know corinth above above all other churches was such a mixed multitude amen such a mixed multitude corinth is well known in christian history to be a troubled and conflicted group of people very conflicted too many too many there uh had a troubling relationship with the truth too many there were living lives of secret sinners and and to make matters worse the church was turning a blind eye to it and paul paul actually you know this is examples where he comes in he says take my spirit there with you and take such a one out from under the blood and paul wasn't he wasn't joking this is spiritual warfare and and we find that that that you know they're they're there now it's interesting let me show you because there there are some churches you know you know if you take if you take the book of ephesians and and and you you can just go through the book of ephesians philippians and colossians and you see of course that that ephesians is is is the whole program of god for the church for the woman remember the church is a woman and it's the whole program of god you know you you she was cho he opens up how that she was called she was chosen she's quickened in chapter three she's made up of jews and gentiles in chapter four you know there's a there's a five-fold ministry in chapter in chapter five he tells them how to walk in chapter six he tells them how to fight amen you jump philippians and go to colossians and that's the program of the man the who you know the the whole program of the man in 115 where it says uh who is speaking of christ who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature so the whole program of the man all is subject to him and he's the head of the body see and so you've got the woman the church in ephesians and then you've got the man in colossians and in between that you've got the book of philippians which is the marriage because the book of philippians is the only church paul never had to set him in order he never had to correct them for anything because they were an invisible union hallelujah let this mind he said to the philippians which was in christ be in you see that's under the invisible union between woman and man is the marriage and there were there were his other churches that like philippians that he never absolutely ever had to correct and and and but it's very it's very evident that paul loved corinthian he loved the corinthians he loved that church with a very great and a very tender affection he felt particularly close to them see above other ones he felt particularly close to he pastored for a little while in ephesus but the corinthian people you know it's it's as if he felt like in in the way he describes it it's as if at times he felt like a foster parent to them second corinthians 6 13 he says i speak unto you as i speak as unto my children see but the corinthian believers seem to have you know gotten more of their fair share of corrective ministry from the apostle he spent a whole lot of time correcting them you know so what is the church of god what is the church of god well it's a it's a body of gathering people that's one of the things that it is it's far more than that you know whether we can gather or not we're part of a mystical body whether we're in four walls or not we're part of supposed to be part of a mystical body well if you didn't have a church to go to at all you and if you were like daniel who spent your whole life with no bible studies no church meetings no worship services you had no other believers around you to worship with and yet every day you went to god in prayer three times a day and you kept yourself pure for 60 years daniel stayed true didn't even have a church to go to see and so and even his his his fellowship with the other three hebrews because they were they were officers in the kingdom and they had their duties to do and he rarely ever got to see them there's there's really no interplay a little bit between them but not not a whole lot for 60 years brother ram said he had no one so it is it is a a gathered group of like-minded followers of the lord it is a group who are who are anointed what does it mean to be the church of god it means that you're part of a group who have been anointed by god you've been united as brother branham said mystically supernaturally united to the spirit of god by a very supernatural rebirth i'm here to tell you the the real new birth is a mystery that no one can unlock you you can't give it yourself to yourself you can't give it to anyone god rich in mercy has to offer it to you and when he does oh take it right away come into this body you have to be born until you cannot join it amen the the idea of joining a church is ridiculous it was never that way in the in the in the early days as brother branham said i was i was i'm a branham he said no one ever asked me to join the branham family he said i was born of branham i i'm i'm a watkins i no one never asked me to join it i was born into it by the time i got here i already was it amen so so you know it's don't and don't don't give don't give your parents you young people say well i didn't ask to be brought here you might get the answer brother eddie gave me yeah and if you had it i would have said no i think he got that from somewhere else i don't think he meant it genuinely but i but i'm born into the family of god now it's certainly not evidenced by sensation but neither is it absent from deep emotion in the heart it's not evidence by sensation that we don't chase sensationalism but it certainly it certainly is not absent from deep felt emotion that runs deep in your heart and will and and can move you and affect your life and effect change in your life and you can be going a certain direction friends you can be involved in a certain thing and suddenly sometime here comes god and the holy spirit comes down and you begin to feel the atmosphere change and the next thing you know your hands are up the presence of god is there and the lord is saying you listen son listen daughter you need to you know you need to get rid of that you know i'm not pleased with that and you're sitting there take and something that you obviously like doing because you wouldn't have been doing it otherwise no one forced you to do it and there you are with tears running down your face saying yes lord oh stop i'll give it up i'll do anything for you lord i'll do anything for you see it's it's something that's real it's not something you imagine the presence of god is not an imaginary friend it's a real living entity it's a real being he's he he's a he's he's god he's the creator who comes down to do what bring you into a body of fellowship a mystical union between you and god and it affects your life and changes your life for the purpose of you becoming the church of god so that then he can come down into you through you out of you and affect all of the heathenisms and misunderstandings and misinterpreted theologies around you and he does it not because not because all y'all like me get up in a pulpit and shout and scream and spit and wave your hands and turn red and get exhausted but because your life that you live out in the community so it is the it is hey laodicea laodicea who hates to hear this i hope i don't have any layered sins here today so it matters where you go or don't it matters what you do or don't it matters how you dress or don't it matters what you say or don't it matters what kind of friends you have or not it matters about your priorities your schedule it matters your life was given to you by the life giver and he expects it to be in his usage and that makes us the church of god otherwise we're not the church of god we're just a creation of our of our own imagination we're fooling ourselves they have all kinds of ways and tools and things that that that the the misunder the the the people go about with their misunderstanding and in man-made religion around the world as i said the overwhelming far above and beyond running away population of christianity has an idea an idea of what it means to be the church of god and think themselves to be and and that's that's why god like he took israel and dropped them right in the middle east right down in a place where all around them is nothing but canaanites and heathens and he set them there to be a light to send out rays of truth in all directions so that people who thought they had an understanding of theos or whatever the hebrew term is they thought they had an understanding of god and they had a misunderstanding they thought he was a statue or the sun or the wind or an animal or a four-footed creature or a reptile because because dishon dishonest people dishonest religious leaders had told them that and so jesus comes on the scene to show what god was really like this is what you say how how i would love to live a life that is completely pleasing to god wonderful you've got a model you've got four gospels that you can read and all kinds of epistles from the apostles telling you how he lived how he reacted how he acted how he thought what he said and it gives us a life but but more than anything else jesus didn't say i'm come you know so that you can have imitation i've come so that you can have life so that as i am in the father and the father in me so i will be in you and you will be in me that's what christianity is that makes the church of god see so i'm by no means you know they've got all of their satellite stuff i'm happy to use it myself they've got all of their tools we use it ourselves they've got printing printouts and flyers and you know and and and you know what's the one the the salesman the used car guy brother and tell the story uh where will you spend eternity i mean those things are all useful the sinner's prayer it's attractive i mean i i mean i'm not i'm by no means opposed to that that track called the sinner's prayer it's a very fine thing and no doubt it's useful for outreach no doubt it is you know or even reading the sinner's prayer out loud they want you to do that and that's a fine thing i'm not opposed to that i'm for something like that but the spiritual new birth is far more than just reading a sinner's prayer it's far more than a dry-eyed confession it's far more than reciting something written it's far more than signing your name or having a uh you know some kind of name that i'm the church of this or the church of that this thing is a life-giving power this thing is not in word only but in power and demonstration of the holy spirit the devils are subject to you that the holy ghost goes with you that your word spoken means something in the world and god will honor it and the devil will run from it that's why we're here that's what our lives are about we've got to be able to debunk the misunderstanding and the confusion the church of god is a fellowship of saints in the earth who share a common purpose to be representatives of god's kingdom how many want to be representatives of god's kingdom say i'm not here by the jason just to be a a half-baked christian why would i even put this in my schedule there's other things i could be doing and if you're not going to be a christian you're crazy you're nuts to come here if you made up your mind but i'm here to tell you why am i here brother jason why are you here because i don't want that shallowness i want to be part of a kingdom i want to be part of something real i want to be part of something eternal that has no ending it's a brotherhood it's a biota it's a body gathering of people it's a brotherhood of love it's a brotherhood of faith designed to enrich our lives i'm going to close here in a minute i can see i'm not going to get anywhere near done but i'm just going to pick one of these lines and stop it's a family the church of god is a family with compassion and care one for another i need you you need me we're all a part of god's army stand with me agree with me amen amen we're we're we're family we have compassion one for another we cover for one another the harmony and cooperation i mean sister debbie and i were talking about just the other day you know it's incredible the harmony and i i can say this authoritatively because i've been in church my entire life and in this ranks of this message my entire life and i've been in churches all over and i've visited i can't even count them and i'm pushing 60. i've seen a lot friends 30 years around the world preaching this message i've seen i've seen my share of churches and i'm here to tell you and i'm not just saying this to make you feel good or to pat myself on the back because it's certainly not based on me if it is we'd have been a train wreck a long time ago i mean that quite sincerely that's not false humility i you don't realize how painfully aware of my shortcomings i constantly stay in i'm god keeps me humble oh but i'm here to tell you the harmony and the cooperation that we have among all of our bethel family is so rare don't undervalue what the beautiful thing that we have here it's so rare if not unique in my experience sister debbie was saying the other day you know wow you got six preachers now how you gonna handle that i said i'm not gonna handle it at all nothing for me to handle i said god calls us all individually and god makes a way for a man's ministry it's not up to me to do anything i said god will get this will increase their ministry just their exposure in this pulpit it gets beamed around the world that'll increase their exposure and i and i said we're all walking working together and i can tell you that among all of this ministry team that god that the ones that i've had for a while some of the ones that i've raised up under me and and feel like they're almost my sons and the other ones that have come along i can tell you when we sit and talk there's such harmony there's such fellowship it's so unfettered it's so un it's so genuine we can just be ourselves our our our other officers deacons and trustees and our custodial staff and our our sunday school teachers and and our people who work among our senior youth and and our senior youth themselves i'm here to tell you we love one another we love coming together i love being here i love seeing you i love fellowshipping

always have compassion one of another let us be full of love and full of faith and full of tenderness be you kindly affectionate and tenderhearted one toward another you know i was saying to somebody as a preacher and and i was talking to him i don't remember who i was talking to might have been brother tim or might have been anyway some this was probably a couple years ago no it's not even that long ago maybe a year ago and and the whole conversation came up about churches and conflicts and schisms and troubles and and i said you know something brothers i'm just going to be honest i can go back in my mind probably at least a decade maybe longer we don't have any schism at all none zero everybody loves everybody we don't always act right but you know what love covers a multitude of sins
