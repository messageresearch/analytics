[29:22] father we come before you lord and we're

[29:29] our desperate need for you
[29:31] lord we need your presence to come
[29:34] lord and minister to this people
[29:38] father it's it's my it's my desire to
[29:41] see
[29:42] myself move out of the way
[29:44] and you come
[29:46] and you take over you speak
[29:48] and you minister to the hearts of your
[29:50] people lord there's many needs lord i i
[29:53] lift my hand and say lord i have many
[29:55] needs
[29:56] lord would you come
[29:58] would you speak into lives and speak
[30:00] into hearts and would you change
[30:02] would you change us would you transform
[30:03] us would you encourage us
[30:05] would you correct us would you convict
[30:07] us lord we need you
[30:09] come and take your word and make it
[30:10] alive to our in our hearts a living
[30:13] reality
[30:14] we ask these things in jesus name
[30:17] amen
[30:19] all right
[30:20] well i stood you up now i'm going to sit
[30:22] you down
[30:25] god bless you thank you musicians
[30:28] i'm not going to go
[30:29] directly into the scripture you can pull
[30:31] my powerpoint up
[30:33] so
[30:35] you know when the
[30:38] i'm kind of looking at my
[30:40] title
[30:42] today and thinking my content
[30:44] doesn't exactly line up with my title so
[30:46] people are going to be like what why the
[30:48] title and i know ministers will do that
[30:52] sometimes and you're like
[30:54] still haven't figured out the connection
[30:56] but
[30:57] dealing a blow to doubt that's my desire
[31:00] tonight and when i look at this
[31:04] at this subject you'll see
[31:06] in the pattern of what i'm going through
[31:09] in the word
[31:11] i'm not working directly at it i'm
[31:14] working indirectly now
[31:16] understand when the devil comes
[31:18] to try to destroy you
[31:21] to try to bring doubt in your life how
[31:23] does he work
[31:24] he never
[31:26] works directly on you just don't believe
[31:28] god's word you say well i do
[31:31] so what does he do
[31:32] he brings circumstances he brings trials
[31:36] he brings emotions
[31:38] he brings
[31:39] things in your life
[31:40] that strike at your heart
[31:43] to elicit
[31:44] the wrong response
[31:46] right
[31:48] he's never his purpose is never to come
[31:50] directly at you he comes indirectly
[31:53] in order to
[31:55] frustrate god's plan
[31:58] so
[32:01] you know looking at
[32:03] the perspective of the world
[32:06] we almost can't get away from it
[32:09] the world is speaking
[32:11] constantly to us and you know we can use
[32:15] wisdom
[32:16] and avoid it as much as possible
[32:20] but really in today's
[32:22] modern world unless you want to go and
[32:24] be amish
[32:26] you can't you can't you can't avoid it
[32:29] there's the news there's billboards
[32:30] there's things in the grocery store
[32:32] there's
[32:34] things on your phone it's it's
[32:36] i'm not almost omnipresent
[32:39] continuously
[32:41] and there's a certain world view a
[32:43] perspective that's behind it
[32:47] and most 99 of it isn't from god
[32:51] whether it's right wing or left wing
[32:54] whether it's close to the truth or far
[32:56] away from the truth
[32:58] it's all and none of it is trying to get
[33:00] it put a bride in the rapture amen right
[33:04] and so
[33:06] more more times than not the faith that
[33:09] we're following
[33:11] the word that we're following
[33:13] people look at it from the perspective
[33:15] of the world
[33:16] and say that's stale
[33:18] that's dry performance that robs you of
[33:22] happiness and replaces it with robotic
[33:25] duty
[33:28] and that's the perspective
[33:30] of the world and that perspective of the
[33:32] world
[33:33] is
[33:34] just kind of continually dropping amen
[33:38] continually pecking
[33:40] at the shell
[33:42] to produce what
[33:43] doubt
[33:45] as believers
[33:47] filled with the holy ghost
[33:49] we we have the power to fight against
[33:52] that
[33:54] and yet even so
[33:56] we can be brought low we can be brought
[33:59] to a place of discouragement
[34:01] fear
[34:02] etc etc doesn't take away the fact that
[34:06] we're believers that we've had an
[34:07] experience with god and yet we can come
[34:10] to a low
[34:12] place
[34:14] where it feels like our faith is almost
[34:15] gone
[34:17] now take that and put that on young
[34:19] people who haven't yet had an experience
[34:21] with god that are just growing under the
[34:24] influence
[34:25] of godly parents
[34:27] a bible believing church
[34:31] and you see that the world is
[34:34] pecking hard
[34:36] at that protection that they have
[34:41] to get them out out from under that
[34:45] and especially if you haven't had yet an
[34:47] experience
[34:49] with christ where you have the holy
[34:50] ghost
[34:52] you can you will look at
[34:54] the joy and obedience of others and say
[34:57] that's just
[35:00] robotic duty that's not that's rules and
[35:02] regulations
[35:05] and
[35:06] you
[35:07] we have to be what mindful
[35:10] as parents
[35:11] as leaders how we're preaching how we're
[35:14] speaking to our children because it's
[35:16] not about it's not about duty and
[35:19] performance and you you lived up to it
[35:22] no it's about a relationship it's about
[35:24] delight it's about
[35:26] joy
[35:27] and
[35:31] in the middle of
[35:33] what the world is speaking to us
[35:36] we can
[35:38] our perspective can go like this and it
[35:40] can go
[35:42] and only be
[35:43] on
[35:44] this area right right around here mostly
[35:49] and i think the younger you are the more
[35:51] prone you are to that but we are all
[35:53] prone to it
[35:55] and we can get to this perspective where
[35:57] we see
[35:58] only the circumstances
[36:01] around us and the things that are going
[36:02] on inside of our own head
[36:04] and we we miss the big picture of what's
[36:07] happening
[36:08] and what what ends up happening is we're
[36:11] robbed of joy
[36:13] amen we're robbed of purpose
[36:16] things become and seem meaningless
[36:19] they seem purposeless they seem
[36:21] pointless
[36:22] and where is your faith then all of a
[36:24] sudden that connection between you and
[36:26] the lord is is broken experientially if
[36:29] you have the holy ghost it's never
[36:31] broken
[36:32] but yet experience we can come to this
[36:34] experience where we say i don't have the
[36:36] joy of my salvation
[36:38] i don't my heart isn't clean my mind
[36:40] isn't isn't pure
[36:43] i'm all messed up and we there thank god
[36:45] we can go to the lord
[36:47] we can repent we can seek his face and
[36:49] he'll heal us
[36:51] but
[36:52] we we can get ourselves in that position
[36:54] where you
[36:56] you miss that you're part
[36:59] of something incredible that's happening
[37:01] amen
[37:03] and
[37:05] you know it's
[37:07] the most epic adventure
[37:11] that has ever been written and you're a
[37:12] part of it
[37:15] and
[37:16] you know there's there's highs
[37:19] there's lows
[37:21] there's times where you feel there's
[37:22] great purpose
[37:24] and there's times where you feel
[37:27] vanity of vanities always meaningless
[37:30] meaningless
[37:31] [Applause]
[37:32] but in the end we have to have this in
[37:35] our hearts that we're part of a grand
[37:37] adventure
[37:39] that god is doing something and we
[37:42] understand by just by
[37:44] just the overview of scripture one life
[37:48] has terrific meaning
[37:52] one life has awesome
[37:54] meaning and i mean that in the real
[37:56] sense of the word
[37:57] incredible meaning
[37:59] we can't look at it and say well my my
[38:01] life doesn't have any meaning in the
[38:02] plan of god nonsense
[38:05] scripture is replete
[38:08] with what we would look and see certain
[38:10] people of
[38:12] who's that but scripture mentions them
[38:15] amen you know we don't know any even
[38:18] hardly anything about them maybe they
[38:19] just served paul or something like that
[38:22] yet it's me yet they're mentioned
[38:24] and it carried a great importance of
[38:26] something that god was doing
[38:30] we have incredible roles to play
[38:33] no i don't i i i can hear satan talk to
[38:36] you no you don't have a big role i'm
[38:38] nobody i'm not important
[38:40] tell the devil to shut up for a little
[38:42] bit
[38:44] and listen your life
[38:47] affects
[38:48] others
[38:50] and because your life affects others it
[38:52] affects the whole body of christ
[38:56] and there's a role in a position for you
[38:58] to play
[39:00] it doesn't matter if it's big or small
[39:04] b if your role is small be grateful
[39:08] there's less there's less pressure and
[39:10] yet
[39:11] you have a role you have a place you
[39:13] have a position
[39:14] and you can't be replaced by anyone
[39:19] if you could be then you wouldn't be
[39:21] then you wouldn't be here right but
[39:23] you're here
[39:24] you have faith
[39:26] you love god
[39:27] it's evidence according to the by if you
[39:29] believe the bible that he has promises
[39:32] for you he has purpose for you he has a
[39:33] plan for you
[39:35] and you're needed
[39:37] amen
[39:38] you're needed by us you're needed by god
[39:40] in in the whole cog
[39:42] of his plan there's roles
[39:45] that no one wants to play right
[39:48] when we look at scripture there's roles
[39:49] that you wouldn't want to play there's
[39:51] other roles that are people are longing
[39:53] to play
[39:55] ev all of it's needed
[39:57] all of it's necessary uh
[40:00] ii timothy
[40:01] 3 verse 12 12 tells us this
[40:05] yea and all that will live
[40:07] godly in christ jesus
[40:10] shall suffer
[40:12] persecution amen
[40:15] okay when he really changed the corner
[40:17] there what in the world is he talking
[40:18] about
[40:20] the word persecution
[40:23] it's the word dioco in greek
[40:27] and it literally means to be pursued
[40:31] so all that live godly in christ jesus
[40:34] will
[40:35] suffer
[40:36] what being pursued
[40:38] by who
[40:40] the devil what is what does that mean
[40:43] he's hunting yeah right first peter 5 8
[40:47] says be sober be vigilant because your
[40:49] adversary the devil is a roaring lion
[40:52] walks about seeking whom he may devour
[40:56] satan is hunting satan and his minions
[40:59] both
[41:00] spiritual
[41:02] and natural
[41:04] are hunting god's elect
[41:07] and seeking to neutralize them
[41:10] in this great
[41:12] interdimensional warfare that's taking
[41:14] place
[41:17] all men and women of god from all of
[41:19] history
[41:21] were hunted
[41:23] by the devil
[41:24] to neutralize them
[41:27] so the question is are you being hunted
[41:33] have you had the sense in your life
[41:36] that you're
[41:37] continually
[41:38] being hunted by someone yeah
[41:41] and
[41:42] you're escaping but barely
[41:46] many times
[41:47] with injury
[41:49] amen
[41:50] we're promised that
[41:55] i repeat all men and women of god
[41:59] in all of history
[42:00] have been hunted by the devil in his
[42:04] minions
[42:08] all
[42:09] have been put
[42:10] in desperate circumstances difficult
[42:13] circumstances
[42:16] if you're if you're being hunted
[42:19] lift your hands with me right now say
[42:21] thank you lord
[42:22] i'm being hunted
[42:25] you're counted worthy
[42:28] trials and troubles are continually
[42:31] coming your way
[42:35] we're promised to have that
[42:38] we shouldn't shrink from it
[42:40] we we have been given
[42:42] everything that we have need of to fight
[42:45] this enemy
[42:46] everything pertaining to life and
[42:48] godliness has been put at our disposal
[42:50] the lord's laid it out in front of us
[42:53] so whatever you have need of to defeat
[42:55] the enemy
[42:56] you have it
[42:58] well i i don't think i do
[43:02] i might not think i do sometimes too
[43:04] but what i think
[43:06] and what the word says
[43:07] need to be in line
[43:10] and so the word says everything that
[43:12] pertains to life and godliness
[43:14] is at my disposal
[43:16] i have it and so i can fight the enemy i
[43:18] can be defeat the enemy
[43:22] everybody knows probably hear my
[43:23] testimony
[43:25] sometimes you're laid low to the point
[43:27] where you can't fight and you can't win
[43:30] that is what the body of christ is here
[43:32] for amen
[43:33] it's not here to beat each other down
[43:36] to push each other down it's to lift
[43:38] each other up
[43:39] to encourage one another
[43:41] to believe
[43:43] for someone who doesn't have the faith
[43:45] to believe
[43:46] that feels weak brother branham said
[43:48] what if god can lift me up to a place
[43:51] where i can believe for you and god will
[43:53] do the miracle for you
[43:56] how about we do that for one another
[43:59] let's believe
[44:01] let's believe for each other let's see
[44:03] let's see
[44:04] what god is doing the big the big
[44:06] picture let's believe
[44:09] for good things for one another
[44:11] for victory for one another
[44:13] let's call that out of each other
[44:17] not i didn't say kick it out of each
[44:18] other
[44:24] let's call it out of each other
[44:27] god has victory for you
[44:29] i mean look at look at all history
[44:33] this morning i think it was in what's
[44:36] that
[44:37] devotional that we always read
[44:41] no amy amy i'm asking amy
[44:51] streams in the desert
[44:52] i don't know if it was today or
[44:54] yesterday but
[44:55] job can you imagine how why do we
[44:58] remember job for his mountaintop
[45:00] experiences
[45:03] for the great wonderful things that have
[45:05] happened
[45:06] the lowest portion of his life that's
[45:09] what we remember him for and we thank
[45:10] the lord
[45:12] for that because what revelation god
[45:15] gave to you
[45:16] to me
[45:17] because of what job went through
[45:22] you might just be remembered for that
[45:24] the terrible thing that you went through
[45:26] and how god delivered you
[45:28] would you say amen that's okay i'll be
[45:30] i'll be glad to be remembered
[45:33] for the mighty thing that god did at my
[45:35] lowest point in my life
[45:42] john the baptist
[45:44] oh my let's raise up john the baptist
[45:47] for this great fantastic ministry how
[45:50] long was it
[45:52] just a short period of time
[45:54] introduces the messiah
[45:56] oh i've accomplished my ministry
[45:58] lord what
[46:00] grandeur awaits for me yep a prison and
[46:03] beheading
[46:07] that's not fair
[46:11] perhaps not in this life
[46:13] but in the life to come
[46:15] the reward that john the baptist has
[46:16] he's not going to be regretful
[46:18] of anything
[46:24] why
[46:25] we're trying to deal a blow to the devil
[46:27] because he will get you
[46:29] at your lowest point
[46:31] and he'll get you in a place of doubt
[46:35] doubting what's happened
[46:37] you're being hunted
[46:39] amen
[46:40] give thanks to the lord rejoice you know
[46:43] the bible says to rejoice
[46:45] when you're hunted
[46:47] when you're persecuted
[46:48] that's hard i can't do that humans can't
[46:51] do that
[46:52] but the spirit of god
[46:54] can do that amen
[46:57] you know look at
[46:58] look at isaiah he was born into a the
[47:02] the aristocracy should have been a rich
[47:04] guy
[47:05] with his rings and robes and beautiful
[47:08] home and all that stuff yet god calls
[47:10] him and what does he end up being at the
[47:12] end of his life he's cut in half
[47:15] he's got to hide from being pursued by a
[47:17] wicked king
[47:20] that was that was isaiah
[47:22] esteeming the riches of christ greater
[47:25] than the treasures
[47:26] of being an aristocrat
[47:33] don't have young people don't have this
[47:35] fantasy
[47:37] idea that being a christian means life
[47:39] is going to be easy
[47:43] it's not
[47:45] it isn't if you're going to choose to
[47:47] follow jesus christ
[47:49] you're going to face difficulties
[47:51] and you're going to be victorious
[47:54] and you're going to be happy
[47:58] in the midst of all that
[48:00] and you're going to be sad you're going
[48:01] to be you're going to have all the
[48:03] experiences but deep down on the inside
[48:06] of the inside there will be a strength
[48:09] to get up and keep going no matter what
[48:14] luke 6 26 says woe unto you
[48:17] when all men shall speak well of you for
[48:19] so did their fathers to the false
[48:22] prophets
[48:24] again
[48:26] i i think
[48:28] we think
[48:30] our life should always be filled
[48:33] with ease
[48:36] and
[48:37] things should always be
[48:39] positive
[48:41] or or in the worldly sense happy not in
[48:44] in the biblical sense happiness we'll
[48:46] talk about that later i'll just use that
[48:48] term loosely
[48:50] we just feel like our life should always
[48:52] be happy and always be easy an internal
[48:55] voice keeps telling us that it should be
[48:58] and when it isn't what are we
[49:00] disappointed
[49:03] so many times we set our expectations
[49:06] in a certain direction
[49:08] this is what i want my life to be this
[49:10] is what i want to achieve i do it too we
[49:12] all do it
[49:13] this is where i want to be at at certain
[49:15] certain age and this is where i want to
[49:16] go and this is the things that i want to
[49:18] have and this is what i want to do and
[49:20] then you don't have it
[49:21] and you feel disappointed frustrated
[49:24] upset hurt
[49:26] this that and the other thing
[49:28] people don't live up to our expectations
[49:31] you shouldn't i should i'll just let you
[49:33] know that now it's just
[49:34] don't tell anyone else
[49:37] people don't live up to your
[49:38] expectations because you expect a lot
[49:40] for more from them than they can achieve
[49:43] for you
[49:44] and i'm sorry sometimes it hurts
[49:47] i disappoint people
[49:50] there's no amen praise the lord
[49:52] man
[49:54] brother aaron wasn't here otherwise i
[49:56] had to go
[50:00] brother aaron's here aaron mcgeary
[50:06] that was encouraging thank you
[50:11] but i actually know that i've
[50:12] disappointed some of you
[50:14] i'm sure of that
[50:17] we we do that to each other
[50:21] where are our eyes
[50:22] where's our heart focused
[50:24] who's the one that can satisfy us the
[50:26] most who's the one that will never
[50:28] disappoint us
[50:30] the lord jesus
[50:32] and yet
[50:33] if our expectations are wrong
[50:36] we will have the lord jesus
[50:37] disappointing us right
[50:39] isn't that incredible
[50:42] we will have god
[50:44] as a disappointment because he hasn't
[50:46] met our expectations
[50:50] that's a that's that's a
[50:52] sad truth
[50:54] but he will he always is faithful to his
[50:57] word he cannot lie
[50:59] he always fulfills his promises
[51:02] many times he does it a lot differently
[51:04] than you think he does
[51:07] many times or maybe most of the time
[51:10] yeah
[51:10] god's not a vending machine
[51:13] [Music]
[51:15] it's not just put this in and get this
[51:16] out
[51:18] god
[51:21] has mysterious ways with us
[51:24] because he has he has an end in mind he
[51:27] has a purpose in mind and it's more than
[51:28] our comfort
[51:30] it's more than the easiness of life but
[51:32] it's being a reflection of jesus christ
[51:35] being made ready for a rapture
[51:38] we're living in an important special key
[51:42] hour
[51:42] in the history of the world and that's
[51:44] that we have to there has to be a people
[51:46] on the earth that would be perfect
[51:50] to make even people in past ages
[51:53] perfect isn't that amazing we have to
[51:56] have a faith
[51:58] that ca that can not only bring healing
[52:00] to a toothache but even goes further
[52:02] beyond
[52:04] any of those things
[52:06] to where our bodies can change
[52:09] and
[52:12] be careful not to get ahead of myself
[52:18] yeah i got way
[52:20] three pages ahead of myself
[52:24] so where did i leave off i left off
[52:28] we speak to ourselves and we think in
[52:30] such a way where we are
[52:32] demanding
[52:34] life must be easy for me
[52:38] god life has to be easy
[52:41] otherwise you're not faithful no
[52:44] he promised that it would not be he
[52:45] promised that he'd be hunted he promised
[52:48] that you would face trials
[52:50] he promised that you would suffer
[52:53] sign me up
[52:57] no
[52:58] there's a life there's a land beyond
[53:00] this
[53:01] we're not living for right now we're
[53:03] living for eternity
[53:05] there's a new body
[53:07] a new heaven and a new earth
[53:10] that we're going to
[53:12] too much we're focused right here and
[53:14] now a little too much yes we have the
[53:16] promises of god we know what god is
[53:18] doing today
[53:19] and yet our hearts need to be turning
[53:21] towards home
[53:27] how about this let's expect
[53:30] every promise of god
[53:32] in his word to be true for us
[53:36] put your name there in the promise and
[53:39] hold to that
[53:40] say it's not this this hasn't happened
[53:42] this hasn't come this hasn't come
[53:45] that's normal
[53:47] don't think that's don't think that
[53:48] you're an exception
[53:50] that's normal
[53:51] abraham had to wait 25 years for his
[53:54] promise amen
[53:57] and god allowed many things
[53:59] many things to throw that
[54:01] in abraham's face again and again and
[54:03] again
[54:05] and yet
[54:06] even despite the moments that we would
[54:09] look at the bible and say i think
[54:10] abraham was doubting
[54:13] god doesn't say that
[54:15] god doesn't leave that
[54:18] as the epitaph of abraham
[54:21] he believed god
[54:24] and you know what if he did that
[54:27] for abraham
[54:29] i believe he'll do that for you too
[54:31] we i have moments where i doubt i have
[54:34] moments where i'm struggling and god
[54:36] doesn't look and say there is jason the
[54:38] struggler
[54:40] there is jason who believed me and i
[54:42] have accounted to him for righteousness
[54:44] put your name there amen it's for you
[54:47] not just for abraham
[54:51] we should expect trials and difficulties
[54:53] because we're being hunted
[54:55] because there is a
[54:57] interdimensional battle that's taking
[54:59] place
[55:00] between god
[55:02] and and his angels
[55:04] and demons
[55:06] and it's particularly over god's people
[55:11] god's elect the place that god
[55:14] puts his presence
[55:15] he's fighting them constantly
[55:18] so we should we should expect and
[55:20] understand we will face those things
[55:24] it shouldn't be a reason for doubt it
[55:25] should be oh god's word's true he said i
[55:27] would suffer
[55:30] he said i would struggle he said i'd
[55:31] have trials man god is true
[55:34] i am
[55:36] oh my and i'm still i'm hanging onto his
[55:38] promises
[55:39] and i have victory
[55:43] what if i have struggles the rest of my
[55:45] life
[55:47] what if i suffer from something the rest
[55:49] of my life
[55:50] hold to god's unchanging hand don't lose
[55:54] confess his word i've seen
[55:56] incredible saints of god they
[55:58] they were dying of cancer the world
[56:01] would say they're dying of cancer
[56:03] what did they say the lord's my healer
[56:06] on their sick sick bed they said the
[56:08] lord's my healer i trust him
[56:11] i trust him i'm ready to go home
[56:12] whenever he's ready for me but i believe
[56:14] he's a healer do that
[56:16] do that believe believe to your dying
[56:19] breath
[56:23] in
[56:25] what is that in your hand in 1955
[56:27] brother branham says notice notice him
[56:29] now he's a new man here he goes and now
[56:31] how the world will criticize you when
[56:33] you do this
[56:34] don't expect a flower bed expectations
[56:38] don't expect a flower bed of ease amen
[56:41] if everybody talked good about me and
[56:43] everything went fine didn't have any
[56:44] troubles and trials i'd go back to the
[56:46] altar and say lord what's the matter
[56:47] here
[56:48] there's something wrong
[56:50] for all that live godly in christ jesus
[56:52] shall suffer
[56:53] persecution
[56:54] that's the bible that's what jesus said
[56:58] my
[56:59] ephesians 6 10
[57:04] this great war we're in finally my
[57:06] brethren
[57:07] be strong in the lord and in the power
[57:10] of his might
[57:13] don't be discouraged by that
[57:15] if you say i'm i'm weak remember paul
[57:18] said when i'm weak then i'm strong
[57:22] when i'm weak then am i strong
[57:27] so
[57:28] rejoice in being weak
[57:33] that's what god said
[57:36] i can't explain
[57:38] the term when i'm weak that i'm strong
[57:41] but i believe it
[57:42] i believe that's the truth
[57:44] in my it out of weakness the power of
[57:46] god is manifested in my life
[57:50] so be strong in the lord and then the
[57:52] power of his might this is not talking
[57:54] about human strength it's not talking
[57:55] about being hercules or something
[57:58] this spiritual strength that looks very
[57:59] different
[58:01] the guys callus is on the knee
[58:08] put on the whole armor of god
[58:10] that you may be able to stand against
[58:12] the wiles of the devil
[58:15] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[58:17] blood but against principalities against
[58:19] powers
[58:20] against the rulers of the darkness of
[58:23] this world
[58:24] against spiritual wickedness
[58:27] in high places so this is where our
[58:29] fighting is
[58:30] it's against
[58:32] spiritual forces
[58:34] different levels and layers of authority
[58:37] in satan's kingdom we are fighting
[58:39] against them
[58:41] we have to remember that
[58:43] we have to be reminded of that this is
[58:45] the if i could say it this way this is
[58:48] the christian life
[58:50] this is the christian walk
[58:52] don't think it's
[58:54] on the mountaintop
[58:56] in the rocking chair with your cup of
[58:58] coffee
[59:01] having devotions in peace and quiet sure
[59:04] that that gives us strength but that's
[59:06] not where we're at
[59:08] every day
[59:10] if you are god bless you
[59:12] it's still not where we're at
[59:15] still not where you're at it's this is
[59:17] the christian life it is
[59:20] wrestling it is fighting
[59:22] not against flesh and blood
[59:24] but against
[59:25] demons demon powers
[59:29] so paul says
[59:30] and again i want to emphasize that point
[59:33] don't look at this while we have
[59:35] uh
[59:36] our our walk christian walk over here
[59:39] and then a small
[59:40] little piece of that
[59:42] is the spiritual warfare the whole thing
[59:45] that's the whole thing
[59:46] from start to finish
[59:48] is spiritual warfare
[59:51] wherefore
[59:52] take unto you the whole armor of god
[59:55] that you may be able to withstand in the
[59:57] evil day
[59:59] and having done all to stand
[1:00:02] stand therefore having your loins get
[1:00:04] about with truth and having on the
[1:00:06] breastplate
[1:00:07] of righteousness
[1:00:08] and your feet shod with the preparation
[1:00:10] of the gospel of peace above all
[1:00:13] taking the shield of faith wherewith you
[1:00:15] shall be able to quench
[1:00:17] all the fiery darts of the wicked
[1:00:19] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[1:00:21] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[1:00:23] god
[1:00:26] i want to tell you something that all of
[1:00:28] these
[1:00:30] weapons
[1:00:31] of warfare
[1:00:33] never fail
[1:00:36] we might have weapons in our warfare
[1:00:38] guns get jammed planes crash
[1:00:41] bombs don't explode
[1:00:44] not with the lord's armor
[1:00:47] it's infallible
[1:00:50] it always works you but you do have to
[1:00:52] take it
[1:00:54] you can't let it gather rust in the back
[1:00:56] room
[1:00:57] this is what we take every day
[1:00:59] it's not just well
[1:01:01] today's a day we're going out to tea
[1:01:03] i don't need it
[1:01:06] every day is a battle
[1:01:09] every day is a battle not
[1:01:12] you know it's not the the peaceful times
[1:01:14] and then the times of war
[1:01:16] the christian walk is always a time of
[1:01:18] war
[1:01:19] well i don't like that
[1:01:21] well
[1:01:22] get used to it
[1:01:23] because that's what it is
[1:01:25] you're not going to change it amen
[1:01:28] and paul finishes with this praying
[1:01:30] always
[1:01:31] praying always with all prayer
[1:01:33] and supplication in the spirit and
[1:01:35] watching there unto with all
[1:01:37] perseverance and supplication for all
[1:01:40] saints
[1:01:41] i believe that's not a changing of the
[1:01:43] subject i believe that's a summarization
[1:01:47] of what he's saying this is how you're
[1:01:49] going to battle
[1:01:50] praying always with all prayer isn't
[1:01:53] that repetitious
[1:01:54] we would never talk that way in normal
[1:01:56] conversation what is he trying to he's
[1:01:58] doing the the old hebrew
[1:02:00] duplicating a word in order to place a
[1:02:03] point of emphasis is okay you want to
[1:02:06] wrestle against the devil then
[1:02:09] pray always
[1:02:11] with all prayer
[1:02:14] in other words this should be a notable
[1:02:16] feature in your life
[1:02:18] you want to do battle with the enemy
[1:02:20] on your knees
[1:02:22] in prayer
[1:02:23] that's how you're going to fight
[1:02:25] you're going to battle him on your knees
[1:02:26] with the word of god
[1:02:28] fighting
[1:02:29] with supplications in the spirit
[1:02:32] and what and watching observing
[1:02:35] amen you know it says watch and pray
[1:02:39] so we're supposed to watch we're
[1:02:40] supposed to pay attention we're supposed
[1:02:41] to see what's happening around us in our
[1:02:44] lives and what's happening in believers
[1:02:46] lives around us so we can gossip about
[1:02:49] them
[1:02:54] so no so we can pray for them
[1:02:58] so we can stand with them in prayer
[1:03:00] because they're being beaten up against
[1:03:02] and your prayer
[1:03:04] is key to their victory
[1:03:08] say that again
[1:03:10] your prayer
[1:03:11] could actually be
[1:03:13] the very thing
[1:03:15] that would unlock
[1:03:17] victory in another believer's life
[1:03:22] next door or around the world
[1:03:24] and so don't treat it lightly
[1:03:28] when we're when we
[1:03:31] when we're standing with each other this
[1:03:33] the best way to stand with each other is
[1:03:36] to get on our knees
[1:03:42] let's
[1:03:43] can we set our vision of our christian
[1:03:45] life
[1:03:46] this way
[1:03:47] paul's trying to do that
[1:03:49] let's get our vision on the right
[1:03:51] thing again
[1:03:53] i think we live in in america
[1:03:56] and the advertisements and the things
[1:03:58] around us are
[1:03:59] you know what brother steve life should
[1:04:01] be so easy for you
[1:04:03] here let me offer this thing it should
[1:04:05] be easy this one this guy has this thing
[1:04:08] you should have that this this this
[1:04:11] place offers this oh you're light man
[1:04:14] see now your life can be easy and these
[1:04:17] are the thoughts that are being
[1:04:18] bombarded in our head constantly and so
[1:04:21] we say oh
[1:04:22] life should be easy yeah that's true
[1:04:25] and then we get trials and we say
[1:04:27] something's wrong
[1:04:30] no that's
[1:04:32] remember you're fighting against a
[1:04:34] hunter a spiritual hunter
[1:04:37] he's trying to he's trying to neutralize
[1:04:39] you
[1:04:40] he's trying to bring destruction to you
[1:04:43] he's trying to make you useless in in
[1:04:45] god's economy
[1:04:47] i don't believe he will
[1:04:49] no
[1:04:50] i don't believe he will he might be able
[1:04:52] to for a season but let's fight
[1:04:55] let's fight let's battle let's do it
[1:04:57] together
[1:04:59] let's come together let's fight that
[1:05:01] enemy together and let's beat him back
[1:05:03] for one another
[1:05:06] and then let's beat him again because
[1:05:07] he's going to keep coming at you
[1:05:11] unfortunately when we defeat him he
[1:05:12] doesn't die
[1:05:14] he comes back
[1:05:16] in a different way
[1:05:17] so what do we do we beat him again
[1:05:22] might get hurt
[1:05:24] we might have pain we got my little
[1:05:26] bloodshed
[1:05:28] but there's there's a balm in gilead
[1:05:31] there's healing yeah
[1:05:34] expect to be in a fight with the enemy
[1:05:37] if you expect to be in a fight with the
[1:05:39] enemy
[1:05:40] you'll be ready to fight
[1:05:42] you'll be engaged to fight
[1:05:45] and
[1:05:46] your
[1:05:48] your warfare the weapons of your warfare
[1:05:50] can never fail
[1:05:52] amen you might get you might get hit a
[1:05:54] few times but
[1:05:56] your weapons will never fail
[1:05:59] remember that
[1:06:02] isaiah 6
[1:06:09] seems like i'm turning a corner
[1:06:11] a little bit but not completely
[1:06:14] in the year that king uzziah died i saw
[1:06:16] also the lord sitting upon the throne
[1:06:19] high and lifted up
[1:06:21] and his train filled
[1:06:24] the temple
[1:06:26] above it stood the seraphims each one
[1:06:28] had six wings with twain he covered his
[1:06:31] face
[1:06:32] and with twain he covered his feet and
[1:06:35] with twain he did fly
[1:06:37] and one cried to another and said holy
[1:06:39] holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole
[1:06:42] earth
[1:06:43] is full of his
[1:06:45] glory
[1:06:48] and the post of the door moved at the
[1:06:50] voice of him that cried
[1:06:52] and the house was filled
[1:06:54] with smoke so here is
[1:06:57] an infinitely holy
[1:06:59] infinitely pure
[1:07:01] god
[1:07:02] appearing in his temple to isaiah
[1:07:06] and
[1:07:09] this is isaiah's response in verse 5
[1:07:11] then said i
[1:07:13] woe is me
[1:07:14] this word woe is actually oi
[1:07:19] if you hear the old the yiddish
[1:07:20] expression oy vey
[1:07:22] that's what it's from
[1:07:25] it's a passionate cry of grief or
[1:07:28] despair
[1:07:30] he says woe is me oy oy vey for i am
[1:07:33] undone it means undone means to cease
[1:07:36] cause to cease to cut off to destroy
[1:07:38] to perish
[1:07:40] because i'm a man of unclean lips and i
[1:07:43] dwell in the midst of a people of
[1:07:45] unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the
[1:07:47] king
[1:07:48] the lord of hosts
[1:07:50] so here we have
[1:07:52] the holiest man of god in israel he sees
[1:07:55] a vision of the presence of god
[1:07:57] and his response to the holiness of god
[1:08:00] is to say
[1:08:01] oh i'm ruined
[1:08:04] i'm a dead man
[1:08:06] because my lips and my life
[1:08:08] are unclean and so is everyone else's
[1:08:10] around me
[1:08:12] and that is the right response
[1:08:14] yeah
[1:08:15] that is this that is the response
[1:08:18] we should have when we see the presence
[1:08:20] of the lord
[1:08:24] romans 3 11 says there's none
[1:08:27] that understands there's none
[1:08:29] that seeks after god
[1:08:32] you probably think he started a whole
[1:08:34] new sermon
[1:08:37] what's he doing
[1:08:40] i'm trying to paint a picture
[1:08:42] i'll get there
[1:08:43] i hope
[1:08:45] no promises
[1:08:47] with the lord's help
[1:08:49] amen then flew verse 6 then flew one of
[1:08:51] the seraphims unto me having a live coal
[1:08:53] in his hand which he had taken with the
[1:08:55] tongs from off the altar
[1:08:58] and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo
[1:09:00] this hath touched thy lips and thy
[1:09:01] iniquity is taken away and i sin purged
[1:09:05] also i heard the voice of the lord
[1:09:08] saying whom shall i send and who will go
[1:09:10] for us then said i here am i
[1:09:13] send me amen i think it's beautiful
[1:09:17] isaiah seeing
[1:09:19] god
[1:09:20] his response his response to seeing
[1:09:24] how holy how infinitely holy and pure
[1:09:27] god is is
[1:09:30] i'm falling i'm falling to pieces i'm
[1:09:32] disintegrating
[1:09:34] i'm finished
[1:09:36] that's the right response because what
[1:09:38] then what is god's response is don't
[1:09:40] worry there's a
[1:09:42] there's there's there's a resolution to
[1:09:44] this problem
[1:09:45] your sin will be purged he purged away
[1:09:48] his sin and then what he said now go and
[1:09:51] go and uh you know figure your life out
[1:09:53] get your life all figured out and then
[1:09:55] i'll come back
[1:09:57] no he purged him
[1:09:59] he made him holy and what did he say i'm
[1:10:02] sending you
[1:10:03] to be a mouthpiece and this is this is
[1:10:05] god's
[1:10:07] approach to man he shows his glory he
[1:10:09] reveals his power
[1:10:11] it's god seeking after man
[1:10:15] trying to dispel doubt
[1:10:18] trying to do a battle against doubt
[1:10:21] you'll see why
[1:10:23] god seeking man
[1:10:26] man's not seeking god is he
[1:10:29] we say oh i sought the lord i'm seeking
[1:10:31] god i'm trying to find god
[1:10:34] well once you are saved and filled with
[1:10:36] the holy spirit
[1:10:38] yes you can yeah
[1:10:40] before that your res
[1:10:42] the response of scripture is that there
[1:10:44] no no one is seeking after god there's
[1:10:47] none good
[1:10:48] no not one
[1:10:49] in order for you to even believe god has
[1:10:52] to open your heart
[1:10:53] amen to believe the to receive the word
[1:10:56] that's being spoken otherwise you would
[1:10:57] reject it you turn against it so god by
[1:11:00] his grace
[1:11:02] it's god
[1:11:04] offering
[1:11:05] giving working salvation
[1:11:07] salvation is a gift right
[1:11:10] amen for by grace are you saved through
[1:11:12] faith
[1:11:14] and that not of yourselves it is the
[1:11:16] gift of god
[1:11:17] not of works lest any mention both so
[1:11:19] even your faith
[1:11:22] is not of you
[1:11:24] amen what does paul paul say he says i
[1:11:26] live
[1:11:28] by the faith of the son of god who loved
[1:11:31] me and gave himself for me
[1:11:35] and so
[1:11:36] this is to me this is critical and
[1:11:38] understanding god has called you
[1:11:42] god has chosen you god has brought
[1:11:45] salvation to you you didn't bring
[1:11:47] yourself salvation
[1:11:49] you can't change your life you can't
[1:11:51] make sanctify yourself you can't fill
[1:11:53] yourself with the holy ghost
[1:11:55] that is the work of grace
[1:11:59] and if we if
[1:12:01] of course we on our end we have to make
[1:12:04] a choice we make a choice we make a
[1:12:05] decision
[1:12:07] we choose to serve the lord we choose to
[1:12:08] believe
[1:12:10] etc etc we have to do that we don't just
[1:12:13] sit as bumps on the log and doing
[1:12:15] nothing we are we respond to the grace
[1:12:17] of god but even our response we
[1:12:20] understand
[1:12:21] is god
[1:12:22] working in us
[1:12:23] both to will and to do of his good
[1:12:25] pleasure
[1:12:27] and so him him working in you you would
[1:12:30] never seek god unless god himself was
[1:12:32] drawing you to himself amen you would
[1:12:35] never
[1:12:36] you wouldn't do that
[1:12:37] no that's not in your that's not the
[1:12:39] nature that you're born with you're born
[1:12:41] in a nature that sins and rebels against
[1:12:44] god
[1:12:46] amen
[1:12:48] so when we're talking ab about god's
[1:12:51] work
[1:12:52] in your life that's between you and the
[1:12:54] lord
[1:12:56] we love to see it we love to rejoice
[1:12:58] over it but there's a secret place in
[1:13:01] your heart that god has worked i can't
[1:13:04] tell you
[1:13:05] if god has done it
[1:13:08] you but you know
[1:13:10] amen i can give you my testimony and you
[1:13:13] can doubt it that's fine go ahead
[1:13:16] don't bother me any i know what god has
[1:13:18] done for me
[1:13:19] you can respond to circumstances and say
[1:13:21] the message isn't true i don't believe
[1:13:23] it go ahead
[1:13:25] god has revealed it to me personally
[1:13:28] god has changed my life do i have a lot
[1:13:30] of failings
[1:13:33] yeah
[1:13:34] do i need to grow
[1:13:37] yes
[1:13:39] but do i keep getting up and keep moving
[1:13:41] forward by the with with his grace yes i
[1:13:43] do
[1:13:45] do i keep seeing him work yes i do
[1:13:48] do i keep doubting
[1:13:52] many times i do many times my faith is
[1:13:54] shaken many times
[1:13:56] i feel weak
[1:13:57] i'm just being i'm just being straight
[1:13:59] up
[1:14:00] with you because
[1:14:01] you have you experienced it too
[1:14:03] but there's something on the inside of
[1:14:06] the inside that just
[1:14:08] won't let go
[1:14:11] and regardless of the circumstances
[1:14:13] regardless of what i see regardless of
[1:14:15] how i feel
[1:14:17] how upset i am how frustrated i might be
[1:14:19] how
[1:14:20] whatever it might be
[1:14:22] i just hold on
[1:14:24] i just believe
[1:14:29] really i'll be honest i feel like i
[1:14:30] couldn't do anything else
[1:14:34] yeah
[1:14:36] because it isn't me
[1:14:38] i didn't call myself i chose
[1:14:40] myself to smoke marijuana
[1:14:43] and drink and party and play sports and
[1:14:48] cuss every other word that was what i
[1:14:50] chose
[1:14:51] god had a different plan
[1:14:56] for me and he started the work
[1:14:59] he's still working
[1:15:01] he'll finish it
[1:15:02] [Applause]
[1:15:03] salvation is of the lord amen
[1:15:07] not a man
[1:15:09] not from man it wasn't my faith
[1:15:11] that saved me
[1:15:13] oh what a weird thing to say over the
[1:15:15] pulpit
[1:15:16] but i think you understand based on what
[1:15:18] i said before
[1:15:19] it was the faith of the son of god
[1:15:22] that came into me by revelation as a
[1:15:25] gift from god amen that brought
[1:15:27] salvation in my life
[1:15:29] that brought an experience with god
[1:15:31] that brings his voice into my life
[1:15:34] sometimes i have to wait sometimes i
[1:15:36] don't hear anything
[1:15:37] for a long time and i wonder what's
[1:15:40] happening
[1:15:41] why
[1:15:42] why won't he speak to me why won't i'm
[1:15:44] trying i'm asking i'm begging you lord
[1:15:46] tell me what to do what's the next step
[1:15:48] and it's just
[1:15:50] and what do i do i keep waiting i keep
[1:15:52] holding on yeah i get frustrated
[1:15:55] yeah i say
[1:15:57] why isn't he speaking i'm i'm i'm i'm
[1:15:59] listening i'm waiting lord
[1:16:02] and
[1:16:03] he says wait a little longer
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:09] amen it's god
[1:16:11] is approaching you
[1:16:13] he achieves salvation
[1:16:16] christ is the author of salvation not
[1:16:19] you amen
[1:16:22] every part of salvation
[1:16:24] even healing
[1:16:25] is the same yeah
[1:16:28] brother branham says that's the way
[1:16:30] this is i have heard but now i see
[1:16:32] that's the way genuine healing comes
[1:16:34] when it's revealed to you that he was
[1:16:37] wounded for your transgressions
[1:16:39] bruised for your iniquity and with his
[1:16:41] stripes you were healed
[1:16:43] listen when it's inspired to you
[1:16:46] to see his presence here of saint mark
[1:16:48] 11 or saint luke 17 30 that he's going
[1:16:51] to reveal himself in the last days among
[1:16:53] his people and huma human flesh like he
[1:16:55] did before sodom
[1:16:58] what is he saying
[1:17:00] even our healing comes by revelation
[1:17:02] when i want to ask you a question when
[1:17:04] brother branham spoke
[1:17:06] the squirrels into existence was that
[1:17:07] his idea
[1:17:09] well god says you have need of squirrels
[1:17:12] are you you're hunting
[1:17:14] what do you have need of squirrels
[1:17:16] so who initiated this thing
[1:17:19] did brother branham well brother branham
[1:17:21] was thinking about the scripture you say
[1:17:24] god told him you speak
[1:17:26] and then he spoke
[1:17:28] was it brother branham coming up with an
[1:17:30] idea and just throwing his voice out to
[1:17:33] whatever he wanted to
[1:17:35] no
[1:17:36] god spoke god dealt
[1:17:38] god worked he spoke it came
[1:17:41] the same thing goes for you for our
[1:17:43] healing
[1:17:44] i can't heal myself
[1:17:46] yet brother branham says what's inside
[1:17:48] of me i already have it inside of me
[1:17:51] to bring healing to myself and yet can i
[1:17:55] activate that
[1:18:00] potentially but god has to quicken it
[1:18:03] i mean you see that here that's the way
[1:18:04] genuine healing comes when it's revealed
[1:18:06] to you that he was wounded for your
[1:18:08] transgressions when it's inspired to you
[1:18:10] see
[1:18:12] amen we can try to work ourselves into
[1:18:14] that
[1:18:16] brother branham talks about that
[1:18:18] they've come to the altar they've had
[1:18:20] two gallons of oil poured on their heads
[1:18:22] they've gotten nothing but then they
[1:18:23] came to brother branham's meeting and
[1:18:25] the spirit of the lord revealed it to
[1:18:26] that person and revealed it to his
[1:18:28] prophet they were healed
[1:18:30] that was the end of it
[1:18:32] what was it was it because brother
[1:18:33] branham was so special well
[1:18:36] maybe part of it
[1:18:40] because that spirit of elijah was
[1:18:41] working in a prophetic office to
[1:18:43] vindicate the word
[1:18:45] but i'm going to tell you what it was is
[1:18:47] they got a revelation and brother
[1:18:49] branham said what was it your faith made
[1:18:52] contact with him
[1:18:54] where did you get your faith from
[1:18:57] him amen
[1:19:02] yeah so many stories you know you could
[1:19:04] go on and on it was god's
[1:19:06] grace
[1:19:08] that's when you when you have faith
[1:19:11] god's grace has been extended to you
[1:19:14] amen
[1:19:19] you can pray and believe for healing
[1:19:22] brother there's examples in brother
[1:19:23] branham's messages we've prayed for this
[1:19:26] sister she's just sat there she sat in
[1:19:28] the wheelchair
[1:19:29] the lord's decided not to heal her yeah
[1:19:32] and and there there she is her faith is
[1:19:34] just as strong
[1:19:36] so sometimes and he talks about i think
[1:19:38] there's another family that he talks
[1:19:40] about that they prayed for and the lord
[1:19:41] didn't heal him he says sometimes it
[1:19:43] takes faith to be stronger
[1:19:46] in those circumstances when you don't
[1:19:47] get healed
[1:19:48] in that moment because they're
[1:19:50] continuing on in faith regardless of
[1:19:52] what they see they still believe
[1:19:54] regardless of their circumstances
[1:19:56] regardless of what strikes their eyes
[1:19:57] they say i believe lord
[1:19:59] i'm healed thank you lord
[1:20:02] all right man i'm i should close but i
[1:20:06] just can't do that right now if you want
[1:20:08] to leave just go
[1:20:15] but if it's something that's valuable to
[1:20:17] you then stick around
[1:20:21] psalms 34 7 4
[1:20:25] we won't stay till
[1:20:27] after midnight
[1:20:29] delight thyself also in the lord and he
[1:20:31] shall give thee the desires of thine
[1:20:34] heart
[1:20:37] think for a minute about going to the
[1:20:39] grand canyon
[1:20:42] why did you go to the grand canyon
[1:20:46] was it to build your self-esteem
[1:20:51] no
[1:20:53] why did you go to the grand canyon
[1:20:54] because you wanted to see something
[1:20:56] incredible
[1:20:58] you wanted to experience that
[1:21:01] and you know i've been i've been there i
[1:21:02] could explain to you why it's amazing
[1:21:04] but until you've gone there personally
[1:21:07] you really can't
[1:21:08] grasp the grandeur
[1:21:10] and and
[1:21:12] how incredible the grand canyon is
[1:21:16] so
[1:21:18] bring that bring that back
[1:21:20] to the lord
[1:21:22] why do you go to the lord
[1:21:24] why do you worship the lord
[1:21:28] it should be
[1:21:29] to experience
[1:21:31] the grander grandeur and the beauty
[1:21:36] of god right now
[1:21:38] you should be delighting in how great he
[1:21:41] is
[1:21:46] and when you get lost
[1:21:49] and how great and how beautiful
[1:21:51] and how awesome god is guess what guess
[1:21:54] what happens next
[1:21:56] something amazing happens next
[1:21:59] you get happy
[1:22:04] you do you get happy
[1:22:07] when you see
[1:22:08] the grand canyon
[1:22:11] do you see a bunch of depressed people
[1:22:12] there no they're excited to see the
[1:22:14] grand canyon
[1:22:19] no so
[1:22:21] when you come to the lord when you
[1:22:22] worship him the grand canyon could
[1:22:25] disappoint you it's possible
[1:22:28] i'm not sure how but okay
[1:22:30] it's possible but
[1:22:32] coming to the lord
[1:22:34] in with this delight and desire in our
[1:22:36] heart it'll never disappoint amen
[1:22:40] there'll never be any disappointment
[1:22:41] whatsoever
[1:22:45] this verse when i when i first got saved
[1:22:48] i thought
[1:22:50] this verse if i delight myself in the
[1:22:52] lord i'll get what i want
[1:22:55] so
[1:22:58] and then i i as a philosopher i started
[1:23:00] thinking and i thought that's a catch-22
[1:23:02] isn't it because if i really delight
[1:23:04] myself in the lord the desires of my
[1:23:06] heart will change to be reflective of
[1:23:08] god's desires
[1:23:11] and then this cycle of happiness will
[1:23:13] take place
[1:23:15] this cycle of joy will take place
[1:23:18] even in the things that god gives us
[1:23:20] think about this
[1:23:22] if you if you go and you spend all kinds
[1:23:24] of time and money to get a present for
[1:23:26] the person you love
[1:23:28] and you give it to them and their
[1:23:29] reaction is i mean
[1:23:33] uh
[1:23:34] i don't
[1:23:35] i just rather have time with you
[1:23:38] you're like
[1:23:40] what what
[1:23:41] i mean i'm glad you want to have time
[1:23:42] with me but
[1:23:45] or if you do like amber does when she
[1:23:47] gets a present
[1:23:48] screams and shouts and goes crazy
[1:23:53] cries
[1:23:54] and tony has the biggest smile on his
[1:23:56] face ever
[1:23:59] and he might even be laughing
[1:24:02] and he's for sure videoing
[1:24:09] but
[1:24:10] that's the response i believe that the
[1:24:12] lord
[1:24:13] when he gives us good things when he
[1:24:15] gives us blessings we rejoice
[1:24:19] but be careful don't get so focused on
[1:24:21] the gift that you forget the giver
[1:24:23] but even so the gifts that god gives
[1:24:26] rejoice
[1:24:27] give him thanks
[1:24:29] you know this
[1:24:31] this uh
[1:24:33] again we don't
[1:24:34] major
[1:24:36] well we just should if you're not
[1:24:37] rejoicing you should be rejoicing all
[1:24:39] the time if you're not rejoicing then
[1:24:40] you must not have the holy ghost no
[1:24:42] there's ups and downs there's
[1:24:43] difficulties there's trials there's
[1:24:45] there's times of being still and knowing
[1:24:47] that he's god and there's times and
[1:24:49] shouting and dancing and rejoicing in
[1:24:51] the lord all those things
[1:24:53] but
[1:24:55] a dis what is a desire
[1:24:57] right
[1:24:58] delight yourself in the lord he'll give
[1:24:59] you the desire of your heart
[1:25:02] there's a desire there's something in us
[1:25:04] that we're seeking after
[1:25:07] amen and if we understand this verse
[1:25:10] correctly we really should be seeking
[1:25:12] after him
[1:25:14] and his righteousness
[1:25:17] and then all these things will be added
[1:25:18] to you our hearts will be filled
[1:25:21] and so
[1:25:22] that delight so where there's a desire
[1:25:25] for god in our hearts there should be if
[1:25:27] you have the holy ghost
[1:25:28] you have a passionate
[1:25:30] desire for god in your heart
[1:25:35] you should
[1:25:37] it goes sometimes we go up and down and
[1:25:39] usually we when that desire goes down
[1:25:42] there's something not right
[1:25:44] and we've got to make it right we've got
[1:25:46] to get right with the lord
[1:25:47] but there'll be a great desire and it
[1:25:49] can be manifested in different ways
[1:25:52] but a real desire overflow for god
[1:25:56] overflows in being
[1:25:58] delighted in him
[1:26:00] overflows
[1:26:02] in joy
[1:26:05] c.s lewis said it like this our desires
[1:26:09] are not too strong but too weak
[1:26:12] we are half-hearted creatures
[1:26:15] fooling about with drink and sex and
[1:26:17] ambition when infinite joy is offered to
[1:26:19] us
[1:26:20] like an ignorant child who wants to go
[1:26:22] on making mud pies in a slum
[1:26:24] because he cannot imagine what it means
[1:26:27] by the offer of a holiday at the sea
[1:26:30] we're far too easily pleased
[1:26:34] going after the things of the world the
[1:26:36] desires of the world
[1:26:38] we understand the fruit of that
[1:26:41] it doesn't take long to research and
[1:26:43] find
[1:26:44] people that have reached the pinnacle of
[1:26:46] success
[1:26:47] what what what is you reach the pinnacle
[1:26:50] of success in the nba okay
[1:26:53] what do you want next do it again next
[1:26:55] year
[1:26:58] if you don't do it again next year then
[1:26:59] what you're frustrated
[1:27:03] look at
[1:27:07] the ridiculous situation of johnny depp
[1:27:10] poor guy
[1:27:12] he's
[1:27:14] destroyed his life
[1:27:16] not because he put his desires in the
[1:27:18] right place or he had too many desires
[1:27:20] they were so perverted after the things
[1:27:22] of the world reached the pinnacle of
[1:27:24] success rich his wealth and what does he
[1:27:27] have to do in order to survive the day
[1:27:30] he has to numb himself
[1:27:32] with drugs and drink
[1:27:36] okay so if you want to achieve that
[1:27:39] success of the world just understand
[1:27:41] what the results are
[1:27:45] i think it was uh
[1:27:48] i have this down further but i'm going
[1:27:49] to bring this here
[1:27:51] gk chesterton says meaninglessness does
[1:27:54] not come from being weary of pain
[1:27:57] meaninglessness comes from being weary
[1:27:59] of pleasure
[1:28:03] in other words people have experienced
[1:28:04] all the pleasures of life
[1:28:07] everything that the devil has to offer
[1:28:09] and they come to this realization
[1:28:12] that doesn't satisfy
[1:28:14] that is the most soul
[1:28:18] life mind numbingly painful thing
[1:28:22] a person in this world could experience
[1:28:25] don't go there
[1:28:27] don't seek after those things
[1:28:29] they can never satisfy
[1:28:32] the only thing that can satisfy
[1:28:35] is our lord
[1:28:37] look at deuteronomy 28
[1:28:39] and we're going to read
[1:28:40] 45-48 i'm mindful of time i'm not going
[1:28:43] to wear you out too bad
[1:28:45] i know i'll warn you out but i won't
[1:28:47] wear you out
[1:28:48] too bad
[1:28:51] moreover all these curses shall come
[1:28:53] upon me and shall pursue thee and
[1:28:55] overtake thee till thou be destroyed
[1:28:58] because thou harken us not unto the
[1:29:00] voice of the lord thy god to keep his
[1:29:02] commandments and his statues which he
[1:29:03] commanded thee
[1:29:05] and they shall be upon thee for a sign
[1:29:07] and for a wonder and upon thy seed
[1:29:08] forever because look at this verse
[1:29:12] because thou service not the lord thy
[1:29:15] god with joyfulness
[1:29:17] and with gladness of heart for the
[1:29:19] abundance of all things therefore it
[1:29:21] shalt thou serve thine enemies which the
[1:29:23] lord shall send against thee in hunger
[1:29:26] and in thirst and in nakedness and in
[1:29:27] want of all things and he should put a
[1:29:29] yoke of iron upon thy neck until he have
[1:29:32] destroyed thee think of these things not
[1:29:35] in the natural sense think of it in the
[1:29:37] spiritual sense we're not under a
[1:29:38] natural thing like the jews were a
[1:29:41] natural blessing we're thinking of
[1:29:42] spiritual blessings
[1:29:44] but look at what the reason he says he
[1:29:46] was going to bring these curses upon
[1:29:48] them was because they didn't serve the
[1:29:50] lord god with joyfulness
[1:29:52] and with gladness of heart so
[1:29:54] what does that mean god wanted them
[1:29:57] to put their delight in him
[1:30:00] he wanted to see them
[1:30:02] full of joy
[1:30:04] he wanted to see them happy
[1:30:07] rejoicing in his blessings in his
[1:30:09] strength in his salvation in his
[1:30:11] presence
[1:30:12] he didn't want to see them walking
[1:30:13] around
[1:30:14] sad broken-hearted upset
[1:30:17] he wanted them to be happy brother
[1:30:19] branham says this in the resurrection
[1:30:21] resurrection of jesus 1956
[1:30:24] god don't want you to be frowning
[1:30:26] god wants you to be happy the human
[1:30:28] heart was made to be happy
[1:30:30] worry will cause cancer temper will
[1:30:32] cause cancer don't never be upset just
[1:30:35] walk in his love amen
[1:30:37] knowing that you're walking in him and
[1:30:38] nothing can harm you there's nothing can
[1:30:40] harm you there's neither powers things
[1:30:42] present things future nothing can
[1:30:44] separate us from him we're in him and we
[1:30:47] never come in by our own will he by
[1:30:50] choice elected us and brought us into
[1:30:52] him amen so it's his business to take
[1:30:55] care of what he's took himself
[1:30:57] no man can pluck them from my father's
[1:30:59] hand because he's the greatest of all of
[1:31:01] them amen it's the father who
[1:31:04] takes care of us who's got any more
[1:31:06] power than god amen
[1:31:09] musicians if you want to come
[1:31:13] john piper writes this god is not
[1:31:15] worshiped
[1:31:16] where he is not treasured and enjoyed
[1:31:20] treasure praise is not an alternative to
[1:31:22] joy but the expression of joy not to
[1:31:25] enjoy god
[1:31:27] is to dishonor him
[1:31:29] to say to him that something else
[1:31:31] satisfies you more
[1:31:33] is the op opposite of worship
[1:31:36] it is
[1:31:37] sacrilege
[1:31:39] my
[1:31:41] set this vision
[1:31:43] for yourself
[1:31:45] we talked about three different things
[1:31:47] i i i wanted to dissolve your doubts
[1:31:51] i wanted you to see
[1:31:53] god has a plan for you god has a purpose
[1:31:55] for you
[1:31:57] he's working regardless of the trials
[1:31:59] tribulations that's what you should
[1:32:01] expect that's what you should understand
[1:32:03] because you're in a you're in a cosmic
[1:32:06] battle
[1:32:07] amen with with the enemy
[1:32:10] and he's hunting you he's trying to to
[1:32:13] to neutralize you
[1:32:16] but the fact that
[1:32:18] you have faith and god is working you
[1:32:20] should understand
[1:32:23] he started it
[1:32:25] you might be at a high point you might
[1:32:26] be at a low point
[1:32:28] he promised he will finish it
[1:32:29] [Music]
[1:32:31] how will it come
[1:32:33] probably with lots of ups and downs
[1:32:36] probably through lots of trials
[1:32:38] probably guaranteed
[1:32:42] victory
[1:32:43] because he is working
[1:32:45] and he does he never fails his armor
[1:32:48] never fails
[1:32:50] and remember
[1:32:51] in all of these things
[1:32:53] make god your delight
[1:32:58] don't make other things don't make the
[1:32:59] party the fun with friends
[1:33:02] that's
[1:33:04] that's those things are great when they
[1:33:05] come but what if you're all alone like
[1:33:07] daniel

[1:33:12] make
[1:33:13] god your delight remember friends will
[1:33:16] fail you

[1:33:56] proverbs 3 5 says trust in the lord
[1:33:59] with all thine heart
[1:34:01] and lean not unto thine own
[1:34:03] understanding in all thy ways
[1:34:06] acknowledge him and he shall
[1:34:08] direct thy paths brother branham says
[1:34:12] it's because that man was made up in the
[1:34:14] beginning not to try
[1:34:16] to shift for himself
[1:34:18] for do things on his own in other words
[1:34:21] a man was made to rely completely upon
[1:34:24] god
[1:34:26] that's the reason we're likened unto
[1:34:27] lambs or sheep a sheep cannot lead
[1:34:29] himself
[1:34:30] he has to have a leader and the holy
[1:34:32] spirit is supposed to
[1:34:34] lead us so man is made that way god
[1:34:38] wants
[1:34:40] us to put our delight in him
[1:34:42] trust him
[1:34:43] and be led by him surrender yourself to
[1:34:47] him
