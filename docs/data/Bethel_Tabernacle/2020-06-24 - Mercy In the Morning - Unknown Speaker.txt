rest in your mercy lord 'as Father as Jeremiah wrote limitations father and Lord and and as he would look over the ruin and the utter destruction of Jerusalem the captivity of your people Lord and he would weep father but he comes to the verse that we've read and said Lord it's because of your mercies that we are not consumed for your Mercy's new every morning great is your faithfulness Lord how we see Lord how we can testify of that in our own life as we see our life Lord Eric your mercy is what's kept us father it's what brought us here tonight Lord whether Lord were streaming online Lord in a living room and a vehicle father may be here Lord gathered tonight I pray God that you'd have your perfect way Lord we trust you now we lean on your grace in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated amen you can be seated but amen if you want to display that PowerPoint you can do that at any time morning mercy I'm going to make a lot of comments here tonight and shift maybe just a direction that the Lord not sure what all we'll cover here tonight but we'll get to what we can get to and then move on and then no and then it's Wednesday it's already 7:45 so we'd like to just look at this it's an amazing thing when you look at mercy in the Bible and when you look at this when you look at this word just that lamentations is speaking of here it's amazing because lamentations was written by Jeremiah and actually in the Hebrew Bible the lamentations it's it's a very hard book to read if you've ever tried to pick up your Bible and read the book of limitations it's just it's a sad book it's definitely what Solomon speaks of when he says there's a time to everything and he says there's a time to weep a time to mourn and this is this is Jeremiah as he is seeing God's kingdom God's Tabernacle his temple is destroyed and he's seen the destruction and and he's seeing that God's people are being taken away and drawn away and it's just a it was a horrible time to live in in those days and actually that's why it's called lamentations the Hebrew Bible it's called simply tears that's what the Bible the book is named that's named tears and it was Jeremiah lamenting it was him crying in him lamenting over just the destruction and the horror that was taken place in the kingdom of God but it's an amazing thing because he comes to verse the verse that we just now read and verse 22 and he says it is of the Lord's look at it again in lamentations verse chapter 3 verse 22 he says it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his Compassion's fell not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness he was saying this of the Lord that were not totally what Jeremiah could see is that in spite of the captivity they weren't wiped out consumed means to be annihilated means to be completely destroyed and so this is somehow Jeremiah able to see light in the midst of darkness he was able to see some what we would call just a ray of light you ever been in such a bad situation and it just looked so dark and so hopeless but somehow you see a ray of light and this is this is the ray of light that Jeremiah sees in his lamenting and his weeping and he says it's the Lord's mercies that were not consumed because his compassion fells not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness you'll find this in the one of the only rays of light in this entire book it's the one bright spot in the book and I think it's in Chapter five there are five different lamentations that he that he gives it's one of the only bright spots that you'll find but what it's so amazing is that he points to the mercy of God and you know there's there's something amazing when you just do a Bible study on what mercy is because the Kingdom of the world doesn't live by a law of mercy but where we live by a law of merit everything is a azmerit it's what you've merited is what you receive but the kingdom of God is not established on merit it's established on mercy and we have no claim on the mercy of God that's why it's mercy it's what God gives us though we're undeserving of it and what's awesome about this undeserving love of God is that it never ceases never ends jeremiah says his mercy doesn't his compassion doesn't cease it's new every morning and it's his mercy and and and you know mercy can take a form maybe different a different form in one situation in your life than it would maybe in another situation you know you could look at the mercy of God as brother branham looks at the the the Holocaust and he says that was as the world looked as such and it was terrible horrible thing to happen in their history but the prophet of God stood back beyond all of it and got the aerial view of God's view and seeing that God's people were scattered as the Bible predicted they would be they were scattered in the entire earth and so God was going to use something to drive them back to their homeland because only in their homeland could they receive blessing and so brother Branham says what was that Holocaust he said it was the tender hand it was the tender mercy the tender loving hand of Jehovah we don't often see the tender loving hand when we look at the Holocaust and very much so we don't always see the tender loving hand when we see what God does even in our own life and reminded so just yesterday I was contemplating and pondering this and thinking about here was brother our brother Steve persone when he was here last time and you'll remember he spoke about origins and how that he had always he had started to get bitter to God and God why did you not allow me to have a father and he loses his father at 13 his father leaves divorces his mom moves back to Greece and he lives his entire life just almost with a cold spot hard spot in his heart to say Lord ah I could have found a had a father I could have helped him and I could have loved him and then you know life goes on and then brother Steve meets his father goes to Greece meets him and then it grows even greater a greater bitterness because now he starts to see this man and he's missed out on all of his life and brother Steve sees his children and and thinks all what what they've missed out on a grandfather and now they've missed he's missed out on grandchildren and why did this have to happen and Lord why did you keep me from the love of a father and I've lived with just a mother and and raised by a single mom and and you know it's it's how we get sometimes when we start to weigh and we start to measure our life and why this happened and why that happened and you remember brother Steve said but then he brought his children on the next trip I think it was the next year and he gets to meet his grandchildren who he's missed out on their entire life and he says and then you know he showed us that picture of William and his and his father you know pointing that point of his finger at it and saying now William you know you're gonna make a fine young man and you're you're Yura you know you're not a Canadian you're from Greece and you should be proud Grecian and and and here they are caught up in this moment and then his father begins to say you know if you ever heard of this song Frank Sinatra I did it my way and he says now you do William you live by that law he says that you should become that should become your law that you live by do and you think of that Frank Sinatra's I did it my way which we preached on this here before that the author of The Satanic Bible labeled that song is the most satanic song written ever because it's a it's Satanism in essence I did it my way I didn't let anybody do tell me what I was gonna do or I was gonna do it my way and here's his father saying to his his you know his grandson you live by this law of you do it your way and Steve said suddenly in that moment so the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said this is why I kept you from the influence of this man you know what it was it was him recognizing the bitterness that he had give that he had received it was the tender loving hand of Jehovah it was the tender mercy of God now we may not always get that aha moment in this life job didn't get it in this life but in the other life job got that aha now I know why song says will understand it better by and by so it's the mercy of God it's his mercies that we are not consumed this is what Jeremiah says he says great is thy faithfulness they are new every morning and and whoa and that's an awesome thing to think about that mercy is new every single morning there's something so powerful I begin to think about this that there there's there's there's something so special about the morning and and if you've when I go to Tucson and I'm always there on a three-hour time shift so I'm mourning for me it starts at about 5:00 a.m. but long before at least for the first few days you're waking up early in the morning I remember I was there and I just the the morning the Sun begin to come up the Lord begin to deal with me on something so special about the morning something so special about the sunrise even the Bible speaks of this and we have the slides here if you'll just advance those to the first slide I don't have any control over here so just advance it this is lamentations the one that we read verse 23 says that the mercies of the Lord notice there new every morning and there's something so special to God about the morning time you remember even in your minds brother Branham ministers on this and he says God doesn't the Holy Spirit doesn't like the night time and he said spooks come out now he said evil spirits come out at night and he said he said so don't don't he said they come out late so you children don't stay out late that's the devil's business he he works in the darkness he works in the in the nighttime where there's no light and he says but there's something brother Adam says there's something God loves about the morning he says if you ever want to meet God just wake up early one morning he said he'll be there the presence of the Lord you know the nearness of the morning that you feel you know when you when you're when everything is just fresh and this is what Jeremiah saying he says that the mercy of the Lord comes with the morning so something about the dawning of a new day it's something about the the the ending of of a night and the beginning of a new day you remember David's I think it was who said this he says that morning meaning Elmo you are in morning like crying morning May last for the night but joy comes in the morning so there's no there's no season of your life of sadness as Solomon says that everything there's a season there is no season of mourning that will last forever very much like that there's no season of laughing that lasts forever but our life is made up of ups of an ever evolving morning midday evening brother Adam says it's you watch the Sun as it begins to creep up it's like a babe in the morning starts off so young and he says then it goes through its life it's midday it's the middle of the day then it goes into the cool of the evening then before you know what the Sun Goes Down and he says but it's back up in the morning so so this is what David says that morning may last for a season Solomon says there's a season for everything there's a season for laughing there's a season for embracing there's a season to not embrace as we've learned in kovat 19 that's a season we're in we don't embrace and Solomon says but there will be a season that we embrace again and I'm looking forward to that season but but there's a so there's a season to everything that you go through in life there's a eviden there's a middle and he says morning may last for the night but joy comes with the morning because mercy is new every morning it's a new chance it's a new start and the storm may last a long time but here's a powerful statement I read someone sent me and it said no storm has ever lasted period simple sentence no storm in history has ever lasted think about that here just for a moment powerful when you think about no storm has ever been permanent the Sun has always shined again no matter what hurricanes have came through and you can give your history there the horriblest storm the were storm at Genoa that's in the past this is the present this is the now don't live in the storm from yesterday there's a morning mercy that's here and he says the mercy comes in the morning they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness go to the next slide this is in Genesis 27 notices something special about the morning here it came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is as the smell of the field which the Lord has blessed therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven do is something very special because as the morning is is a new day it's and let me just say this as I go back to my point here before we go further there in in Tucson and the Sun it was very early 5 a.m. and I was just there preparing for the Sunday morning service and up so early because it was 8 a.m. for my body but but just sit there and watch over the mountains as the Sun began to the lordís begin to speak to me and I just thought you know you know what's so powerful about this morning is that this morning you know what so listen let me get your attention here because I don't want you to miss this you know what's so powerful is the Lord began to deal with me and I said you know what's so powerful about this morning that's different than yesterday morning say boy brother Matt something must have been special about that day there was something very special about that morning this is what was special that day had never happened yet nothing had happened it was brand-new you know what wasn't there history wasn't there yet begin to think about this powerful principle about the morning and about the freshness and and this is the light this is the ray of light that Jeremiah sees as he looks at the destruction and he's lamenting and he says it's because that compassion that mercy were not consumed he says for your mercy it ceases not it's new every morning history isn't there my past isn't there what happened yesterday is yesterday this is a new day this is a new opportunity in God I don't live on merit I live by mercy oh my brother my sister it's not I don't have a right to a house it's the mercy of God I have one I don't have a right to rain it it's the mercy of God that I have won the world lives by rights I don't have a right to breathing into air into oxygen it's the mercy of God that I have then we live not by a system of merit we live by a system and a law of mercy and it's a clean slate there's something special about the morning it's a clean chance it's a fresh start it's a blank canvas it's a another chance maybe that's what you're hearing tonight let the Holy Spirit begin to speak to you his mercy is new every morning forget what happened yesterday forget the mistake of yesterday or last week today's another chance today's a fresh start mercy was new when you woke up this morning dew was there you didn't ask for it to come but it arose whether you seen it or not whether you woke up early enough to go out in your yard with bare feet and fill the dew on the grass it was there whether you seen it or not let me give you the message of God the mercy of God whether you have experienced that or not or felt it or not or seen it or not God renewed his covenant of mercy to you when you woke up this morning somebody say praise the Lord so what's not there it's another chance the old nests of yesterday is gone it's been replaced by the freshness of today the night is over as David said the morning is over the joy has came in the morning it's been replaced the night though it was long as I sat there and watched the Sun all of the shadows begin to just to slowly flee and flee and you watch through the canyons and through the ridges and through the saddles all the shadows that were there just begin to fade and fade as the Sun rose upon them the shadows ran away the night was over it's been replaced by the crispness of life there's moisture there was moisture as I watched there looked into the wash and all the the little cactus is they they were wet and there was water and you know there in the desert it's so important because it's so dry it's some of the only water that they get is the dew that comes in the morning and it was there was moisture on everything though it was dry through the night though it was through a season of dryness now there was do you know powerful thing here about dude appears 34 times in your Bible did you know that the word do appears 34 times in the Bible and anytime you look at that word do it really almost always is speaking a representative of a blessing something that God has blessed you by it's it's it's uh let me just find it here I had some notes on it it appears 34 times in the Bible you'll find in the Bible used in different poems or poetry that you find it it speaks about the dew of the morning the dew of the earth that speaks symbolically it's very different than what the Bible when the Bible speaks about the blessing of rain are you here tonight you see rain is also a blessing but rain can also be a curse rain can destroy as much as it can help you get a torrential downpour it can destroy a manicured lawn that you've worked on or something you get the wrong kind too much rain can cause a flood it's very different when you look at rain but it's amazing but after the Passover the Jews and even today you can go to my Jewish learning calm and the website that I frequent have frequented many times to learn about Jewish culture and and you can just learn so much about it it is based biblically but it's amazing because they celebrate that you celebrate the Talalay holas how they say it and it's the it's a song that's a it's a prayer for do it's a prayer for moisture it's a prayer for blessing and they they they sing this prayer a blessing of do and it's it's a if you'd listen to the words it's saying God will you bring light out of the darkness we sing that Psalm waymaker and in the words it says he's the light in the darkness I'm glad he's the light in the darkness and this is Israel pray and say Lord where you bring light out of darkness and and they says and it says out of darkness to draw to draw Israel to himself as a root finds water from Dew and begin to think about this because if you think about the morning and you think about what comes in the morning do you think about rain rain is something you always you almost not always but almost always you can hear it you can you can hear it coming you suddenly are in your house and though it's raining you can hear the rain outside and you know and if it catches your attention it can be you can hear it especially when it's a torrential downpour you can hear the pummeling of a heavy rain shower on the roof of your house but the opposite of dew dew is silent doesn't make a noise there's no grand entry there's no earth-shattering sound you don't you don't pop your eyes open at 6:00 a.m. and go all the dew I can hear it no you just snore right through it it's silent I'm gonna bring this to something here in a minute it's silent it doesn't draw any attention to itself you can look at it is there's there's a humility to it it's unassuming but its moisture it's the same exact thing as rain it's the same exact it's water it's moisture its watering the earth but you know what it doesn't do it never causes damage it's gentle it's nourishing and it's dependable that that is an exact type of the mercy of God the mercy that Jeremiah says is new every morning it's dependable it's it's always it goes unnoticed and in order for you to ever see the dew you've got to make an intention you've got to go outside and and and look at that but it's it's it's as much a gift of God as rain as they as they pray the the Jews will pray they live in two seasons they don't have multiple seasons like we have here we don't really have multiple seasons even here in South Carolina and Buford but they live in the dry season and they live in the wet season that's it one or the other it's two extremes much like even the Arizona desert it's either really dry with you this most of the time and then they got the monsoon and it's really wet and it's and it's a torrential downpour there's no in-between but it's it's this it's it's as much a gift as rain is in a dry season and it's and and and you notice this here even even in a another scripture here if you go to the next slide I'm not sure what I have brother if you can advance that Gideon says that people this is Genesis 27 says that people shall be willing in the day of thy power and the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning so it's a it's a it's it's speaking up here from the beginning and he says thou has the dew of Veit youth go to the next slide if you can keep going here okay yeah you can you can pause it right there so it's it's a powerful thing here let me come back to my notes here just for a minute here's another scripture in Genesis 27 this is a blessing Isaac blesses Jacob with and he says may God give you of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth and the plenty of grain and wine so it's it's a blessing and so much that he used it with grain and wine and he says may give you of the dew of the heaven so it's a it's a it's exactly what the Bible says it's exactly it's a refreshing it's the same thing that God gave the children of Israel under Moses with manna in the morning and and quell in the evening this is this is what it's typed with it's a source of life it's a source of life what's amazing about this even when you look at this this this thing with Dew and the morning is that the Jews would pray for the first do because it was important for them it spoke of that they were going to come out of the dry season and then we're gonna enter the moist season and it's a as we said it's a it's a prayer of blessing that they pray and it's it's something that they that they asked for to the Lord but what's amazing is when you look at this morning forgive me here for this being a little bit disorganized here on my notes I want to make sure don't get ahead of myself here but it's amazing because when you look at morning and if you go to the next this this slide right here in Psalms 5 go back 1 and psalms 5 want to make sure we catch that one he says my voice shall hear my voice shall doubt here in the morning this is David my voice shalt thou hear in the morning O Lord in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee and I will look up go to the next one if you could he says it is of the Lord's mercies they are new every morning don't go advance that a little bit just again beginning for his anger and dureth for a moment here it is in his favour his life we've been may endure for a night but joy comes in the morning so it's a season as David said there's a season of night of mourning but then there's a season coming of joy in the morning and keep going and I'm not sure I want to make sure we catch all these but I will sing of thy power this is David again yay I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning for thou has been my defence and refuge and the day of my trouble go to the next slide do we have any more calls me to hear thy loving-kindness in the morning for indeed do I trust calls me to know thy way where and I should walk for a lift my soul unto thee and he says this is the day which the Lord has made this is what David is saying today this morning not yesterday not what happened yesterday but right now today is the day the Lord has made I will rejoice and be glad in it so it's the it's thing is we says we register minute ago the womb of the morning the beginning of the morning the breaking of a new day it speaks of the freshness the strength of the early stages of the day because it's a new start it's it should be and it's an encouragement that God can can can can can revive what is what needs to be revived he can give strength to that which is weak and it's it's a powerful thing be because when you think of this here just for a moment is the last time we spoke one of the last time we spoke we spoke a lot on the life of Samson in the life of Jacob and two very powerful characters that we're not going to parallel again here tonight but I I just began to read this here again because I thought about how much failure that they had a they had experienced in their own life we ended if you were I don't know if you remember I was recap here for a moment we ended with Samson grinding in the prison house and he had missed completely missed his destiny and his life was just a wreck complete just just just a sad story of what could have been Jacob very much the same way with Deena and then the Lord begins to call to Jacob and says go back to Bethel it was it was God addressing his son who had failed it was God addressing Jacob who had just made a mess out of things and and God just begins there at the very in and he says Jacob go back to Bethel and you remember God doesn't address him in some chastising way he doesn't rebuke him he doesn't lash out at him he just gives him the very simple invitation come back to Bethel Jacob it's a it's what is it it's it's very different than how we react to others who have felt us others who've led us down God react it reacts with such mercy to his servant they he doesn't even discuss it I thought it was so powerful you don't record no record of Scripture of God or a prophet coming to him or trying to trying to rebuke him or trying to tell him how how bad he messed up but godness says listen Jacob just forget about what happened and just move on past it you can't live in yesterday Jacob you've got to come back to Bethel and you remember that God says I'm he says I'm bound to you I'm tied to you all wherever you go I'll go and he says that I'll never leave you or never forsake you it was God saying forget about what happened yesterday because I promise you no matter what way or what capacity you may have failed God God was aware that you were going to fail him before you failed him and God knew the inadequacy that was in Sampson before Sampson messed up thought it was powerful in judges chapter 27 you'll read this are judges chapter 16 you'll read the same exact thing when the Bible says in verse 22 it says in verse 21 the Philistines took him put out his eyes brought him down to Gaza and bound him with fetters of brass ha and he says and he did grind in the prison house and then in verse 22 that comes out of nowhere howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again out of you a shave it's just like immediately what was it it was mourning mercy it was another chance it wasn't a God who was just going to say you know what Samson man I'm your room the word is done you're gonna separate you find somebody else but God is saying you're the Mercy's new every morning can't dwell in yesterday here's another chance what was that representative of a shaven head howbeit the hair of his head began to grow maybe ever so small maybe no one could see it but God but the hair of his head began to grow again it was the mercy of God saying no matter how how bad you've messed up how bad you've jumbled this up you have to make a choice in your life of how you're going to react or how you're going to move forward from this point because you can either stay stuck in yesterday or you can receive the dew of this morning it's an amazing thing I actually heard another minister speaking about this and he made some references to this plant and I just begin to look it up it became an interest to me Rachael is becoming a quite the colour the plant lady and she's got plants everywhere and she's got a real really good it's got a green thumb and she does he loves she loves plants and loves she's you know she's doing it almost looks like a chemistry project sometimes with some some of the things she's doing with plants and it's amazing study when you look at this it's it's it went that of what makes a plant grow and we know that there's many things that make a plant grow you have the Sun and you have the light and you have water you have all the components but there's something I'm not a botanist but there's something you can study called a meristem line and it's pretty powerful when you look at it because it's it's the science it's the part of science that's real that science can't figure out make this the same thing they can't figure out how SAP in a tree during the season of winter leaves the tree and goes into the root system they know what happens but what voice tells that SAP and the trick is if the SAP stays in the tree and the winter comes the tree will die but there's an intelligent life inside of that tree to tell that tree wintertime is coming so the SAP leaves the tree goes down into the roots to preserve the life of that tree and it's amazing because it's a part that science hasn't figured out but they know that it happens it's an intelligent life there's something that's brother branham uses that example with the infidel who he's speaking to and you remember he tells he's he starts you know talking about the one talking about you know to this infidel he's hunting the property and the infidel says you know he tells him about a you know he asks him about he says oh you're an infidel or he says yes sir and and brother Branham says well it and he begins to figure out how the exactly the conversation begins but brother Manning begins to start talking him about nature and he says you see that bucket over on that tree and he says you know what the SAP that's inside of that tree dripping from the tree down into the bucket NER area gives me he gives the example of the of a of the SAP and the tree that's what it was and brother man and says he says what there's a voice inside of that tree that tells the SAP to go back into the ground and he says and then there's a then there's you know when springtime comes that voice tells that SAP to come up out of the tree and he says and go back and come out of the roots and go back up into the tree and brother branham begins to tell him he begins to tell him about this woman that was healed and made up said she made a terrible ruckus he was shouting and praising God I said healed of some disease and he says and brother Branham begins to say and he doesn't realize he's speaking to brother Branham who's the man in the meeting he says some man and the meet he says I'd like to meet him someday he says that man who told that woman she was going to get well and he had no idea there he was speaking to the man I'm speaking to the Prophet himself and he says told him some voice he says some voice told say he said some voice told that preacher to tell that woman she was going to get well - brother Branham says well he says the same voice that tells that SAP in the tree to come up out of the ground of the same voice that told me to tell that woman she was gonna get well brother man said just with a little thing like that I'll let him to the Lord because he could see the law of nature he could see the law of life it's amazing because there's something in a tree or something in a plant in every plant whether it's a flower tree and it's something called a meristem line and it's and if you ever cut even at the base of a tree it's where it goes into the ground you ever cut it off you can find that meristem line it's it's it and we know that at the bait the base the root system is where that tree receives its nutrients and you know what's amazing about it is is that a tree in the wild or a flower in the wild it doesn't get to pick how much sunlight it gets it doesn't get to choose the weather that it receives it doesn't get to ask what nutrients it's going to receive it just receives whatever it's given it receives it at the base and the ground it receives those nutrients and then science tells us that it divides those nutrients out in two ways some of the nutrients it pushes down and some of the nutrients it pushes up and some of those nutrients that divides it into roots into root systems than others it divides it into to go up into fruit into leaves and it's an amazing because if you look at it well enough you can see it it looks like a little knot I've seen pictures you can google it it looks just to wear it it's a different maybe that it's different with the based on the you know a different color maybe based on the tree if you were to cut the tree down and you were to look at the bark you'd see this little different it's almost an odd colored line that starts at the tree and it's it's almost like the DNA of a plant you have a plant or a tree or a flower it's like the DNA just stay with me here for just for a moment but what's amazing is that science says this line is where that tree or that plant or that flower makes a decision in that spot and it makes a choice of what to do with the nutrients or the atmosphere or the rain that it's receiving and it makes a choice it's it's a spot the where that that intelligence of that plant it determines what I'm going to use this for and a lot of times a plant will at that meristem line the reason that a tree will die is because it used what it received for it didn't use it for life and yeah it didn't use it to grow up but it actually used it to stunt its growth and grow down and the tree eventually dies and it happens at a meristem line it makes a choice to go high or decision to go low now pause that for a moment it's almost exactly what happens in your body at not the meristem but the stem cell line because in your body the body makes decisions from the cells and the nutrients it's receiving your body chooses what to do with those nutrients it receives now you choose unlike a plant you choose what you put in your body you choose what you drink you choose what you eat but that plant has no decision in and it just receives and the body makes decisions from the cells and the nutrients that it's receiving from a baby from its mother the life of that mother there's nutrients coming in the infant's body and at a stem cell line that little fetus that little life makes a decision to use those nutrients it's drawing on to make a finger to make an eyeball to make hair to make feet to make legs it's a it to make a heart to make organs and it's at that's very it's almost directly parallel with the meristem line of the plant it makes a choice to take a cell and say I'm going to use you for a good sale and you're going to be used for a good purpose and I'm gonna use it to grow the body are you with me but what they say is what causes cancer is unidentified cells things that the body never does anything with and they become almost like foreign they're aliens and then they can become dangerous because a cell that never gets identified can become cancer it's unidentified can multiply into bad cells now notice this here it's not necessarily what's coming in but it's what the body chooses to do with what's coming in are you following me it's how it decides the body makes a choice what am I going to do with what I have received how am I going to handle it it's not what comes in that causes the cancer it's how the body acts to what's coming in its how they handle it it's that it gets sent to the wrong place and those cells become dangerous used to create cancer it's how the body handles what it's been given it's exactly how the plant determines or decides how it's going to use what it's received and a plant has no choice in the nutrients it receives and no decision but here's the decision it can make how am I going to use what I've got how am I go what am I going to do I've got a choice to make I can decide I can't always choose what bad things happen to me in my life I can't always choose I don't get to pick I don't know about you but I don't have a I don't text God every morning in heaven he doesn't give me a multiple choice and here's four trials I can send you through now you pick which one you want to go through maybe you all have that conversation but I don't I don't choose what trial I'm going to go through I don't choose what circumstance I'm going to face what difficulty I'm going to face what problem I'm going to go through as Suliman says life is made up of seasons a time of more and a time to laugh a time to dance a time to cry time to receive a time to get time to lose time to build up time to tear down and you don't choose all the seasons of your life but you have the choice are you here and how you're going to react to what you've been given the plant makes a decision I'm either going to take what I've been given and allow it to cause me to go down or I'm going to take what I've been given and I'm gonna allow it to bring me higher and it makes are you here tonight Church it makes that decision at the meristem line that decision and the body is made at the stem cell line it's a powerful thing the minister pointed out in 2nd Corinthians chapter 2 verse 16 turned there if you have you at home in Scripture 2nd Corinthians chapter 2 verse 16 or something this is so amazing 2nd Corinthians 2 look what he says he says this is this is the gospel look we have it on the screen here so you can save time the Bible says that to the one we are the savour of death now this is Paul this is his ministry this is the gospel this is the cross to one it is the savour of death unto of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life so what is the Bible saying that the same gospel that saves one damns another the same gospel that creates life in one person actually creates death in another person imagine if you just think about that it's a powerful thought that this the preaching of Christ Paul says is foolishness to some of the world but it's life unto others the same message that you believe gives you joy it brings bitterness and hatred to other parts of the world the same message the same voice of a prophet that you turn on that gives you peace in your life brings hatred to other people and Paul says two to one its life to the other it is death in in other words some people can hear the message are hear that the sermon and can ear the preaching of the word and and some people can take in that use that message or that inspiration and they literally receive life it brings life to their family it brings joy to their marriage it brings salvation to their children it brings life in their brains it brings encouragement when they're discouraged and they could use that message that gospel that truth to make them to grow strong in the Lord and there's some people who hear the same preaching the same gospel the same message and it does nothing for them it does nothing for them your the message of the hours to here at 8 is nothing but to me it's it does so much because of that decision that brother madam said what is in the soy says that's where you make your choice that meristem line that stem cell line will you you choose what what you're going to do with what you receive that's why you can have a church just like a garden and they could hear the preaching of the word and some are growing and some are dying or let me say it this way some are growing and some are staying in the same exact spot they've always been it's not the preachers fault it's not the messages fault it's not the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit's fault it's it's you who make the decision on what are you going to do with what you receive you can take a person who goes through a horrible situation you watch two families amazing you watch two families go through the exact same tragic event and one of them gets bitter and one of them gets better from yeah you take a horrible thing that happens to one person and it's life it's it's a it's growth for one it's death for the other now they went through the same exact thing you take the loss of a child one family loses a baby and another family loses a baby but their reactions are totally separate one of them maybe get bitter and leave the church and turn their back on God one may grow stronger in the Lord yeah are you are you hearing me tonight you see it's not in in what it's it's not it's not in what we receive you can receive some bad things in your life it's how are you going to react to what you've been given it's not let me go further than that it's not in how bad your brother man I felt so bad that's not the failure is not what defines you it's how you react to that failure it's what are you going to do everybody makes mistakes everybody messes up everybody can sit here and and give a sob story of how they missed the will of God or how they miss this chance this opportunity they have but what are you going to do now how are you going to react to it now are you going to get better or are you going to get better are you going to go down or are you going to use what life has given you to go up it's all according to your choice you can choose everything listen to me my brother my sister you don't as we said you don't choose what happens in your life it's not what happens in other words it's not what happens to me it's what happens in me because inside of me I get to make a choice on what I'm going to do with what I've been given and you know your you're gonna get you don't get to choose that this storms are the trials of the test that you go through but let me say this to you you can make a choice to either allow that difficulty to take you up or to take you down this is what happens to that plant at that meristem line it either goes it takes what it's received the nutrients it receives the life that it's been given the sunshine er the clouds or the rain or the the hurricane or whatever it is and it makes a choice what am I going to use what if it's not whether what I receive or what I don't receive it's what I'm doing with what God has given me you've heard it before the problems in life are gonna come but it's our attitude and how we face difficult I know that simple but it's what the Lord gave me it's our attitude and how we will it will either be will either recognize the do in the morning or will this sleep right through it because the mercy is new every morning but you've got to make use of that mercy you've got to use that morning mercy that mercy in the morning and say I'm going to use it just to thank God for it and as Paul said forget what's in the past forget what happened yesterday forget about it and press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus what are you gonna do with what life has given you no matter what it is and what season in your life what would no matter what comes your way or what since your way you'll either choose let me say they see my brother my sister you're gonna have a million chances you're gonna have a million opportunities to get bitter in life you're gonna have a million opportunities to get depressed in life you're gonna have a thousand chances to let someone hurt your feelings or someone to do you wrong or some injustice to happen to you you're going to have a thousand opportunities to allow those things happened to you to become bitter or someone to hurt you and for you to get cynical or you to get under our for you to get negative and you can allow that root of bitterness to grow inside your heart and and I think it's James who says that root of bitterness he says when it defiles you it doesn't just defile the person it defiles everything around them you'll have a hundred thousand chances to get bitter in life somebody will hurt you say something that they shouldn't have said it's the church will do you wrong somebody will do you wrong let me say this you're gonna have a million disappointments you're gonna have millions of opportunities of how am I going to react to those disappointments in life you can make a decision I'm either going to let this take me down into a root of bitterness I'm gonna push up the fruits of the spirit I'm either going to allow it to make me bitter or make me better it can take you down or it can take you up we decide what we're going to do with what we've been given and as Solomon says life is full of seasons it's it's it's full of of times as Solomon says that everything there's a season a season to be born to see a time to die a time to plant time to pluck up that which is planted time to build up time to tear down and he says there's going to be seasons that you go through and there's going to be even let me say this there's going to be seasons of disappointment there's going to be times that you fell God in your life too many times where you fall on your face as a son of God as a daughter of God born of the Spirit of God there's going to be difficulties you have in your marriage there's going on know some of y'all newlyweds don't want to hear that but they're gonna be difficulties can some of us veterans I'm not a veteran say there's gonna be difficulties there's gonna be struggles but you notice it's it's not it's one family that breaks off in divorce and one family that's 50 years down the road still together they both went through the same what life had been given them it's just they chose to do something inside of them differently they both received the same nutrients but one of them use those to cause them to go down and one of them use them to cause them to push up you're gonna go through tests you're gonna go through trials yes Samson daddy's gonna fail God but what he had to recognize is that his hair had begin to grow again what Jacob had to begin to realize is that whether he realized that or not mercy was new that morning he could have ignored it you might have ignored it you might be ignoring it today but the mercy of God is for you and it's never gonna give up on you it's never gonna quit on you it's never gonna stop on you it's never gonna get loose faith in you God is never gonna lose faith in me he's never gonna lose faith in you you may lose faith in yourself but God will never lose faith in you you know what God's gonna do God's just gonna keep on encouraging you he's gonna keep on preaching to you he's gonna keep on telling you you can make it just get back up again you might have messed up you might have made every mistake in the world but I'm not gonna quit I'm not gonna stop I'm gonna keep giving it to you until you can receive it with faith and say Lord I'm going to overcome it God said I'm it doesn't matter how many times you walk away doesn't matter how many times you know you hear a sermon God sends it gets an anointed sermons I'm knowing an inspiration and it deals directly with a situation and just directly like a bull's-eye like a laser but how many times we walk away and goes right over and what we go through the same exact road and the same exact problem the same exact issue and we just keep repeating and they keep repeating and they keep repeating you know what you thank God one day we'll just go you know what fine that's enough that's it that's all that's enough I'm done told you how many times now that was uh that was the 33rd time I had that preacher say that in his sermon and you are still questioning the same exact thing in your life you're still allowing bitterness to come in your life you're still Allah you steelers are bound by that after 39 times that's been said under the anointed preaching of the word of god you know what we would do we'd go yeah that's enough we're moving on next next person go on just keep on them I'm so glad that's not how our Heavenly Father treats us our Heavenly Father that morning everything's erased and he just comes out and again it's all fresh again God says my Mercy's new today it's a new morning it's not yesterday there's a fresh start yesterday is not here your past isn't here your mistakes are not here I'm gonna preach to you just like I preach to you the first time you can make a child you can be victorious you're gonna win you're gonna you're going to excel you're not gonna do fear not gonna be defeated and it just keeps on preaching and it keeps on pushing it and the more on that you know what the dude just keeps on coming up every single morning that morning represents something so special to God you know you know what the the psalm as the psalm says great is thy faithfulness yeah trying to think of the song the mercy of the Lord it is it is new every morning yeah and and the song says great is thy faithfulness the steadfast love of our Lord there it is

passed away it become harder and I prayed and I said lord if they ever have an outreach please let me go well because of Christopher and Katie I got to go last year they had an outreach but anyway I wrote some that absolutely loved it this one girl a woman she had children me and her started corresponding and I'd sent her books it's absolutely loved on the senator tapes and everything in 2011 2012 2013 lost track and I just I kind of got discouraged I said well Lord I really really had my heart set on some work being up there but if it ever comes I I don't don't guess I'll be around unless Christopher Texas again you know or something but anyway I had sent out three letters just recently and one of those to her I didn't still live the same place or anything and I said Lord you said cast your bread upon the water after many days I've come back so I actually prayed I said Lord I'm kind of sad about it it seemed like it's never come back it'll come back whether I'm here or there it's from back last week I've got a letter from her after seven years right guard begging for books I sent her a whole pack so y'all pray for anybody else sister joy I just want to thank God for this new job I got so we were praying for probably this entire school year that I would find something other than teaching and when Kove it happened I was like well no one's gonna be hiring for any job and I wasn't really sure you know what I wanted to do anyways so I just signed my teaching contract and I was pretty comfortable with going back for the next school year and then probably like a month later Hannah called me and she was like we're actually looking for an assistant at my work and she works for this mortgage company and she was like it's a part-time job and I told her like oh thanks but I really need a full-time job so I just kind of forgot about it and then a week later she calls me back and she's like well we're gonna do up to the regional manager about making it into a full-time position so we can pay you more and I was like well okay then and so she's like I'll just get back to you and I said you know what he says so in the meantime I'm like talking to Caleb he was like well you know we've been training for this whole time that you would find something else and I'm like yeah but you know I already decided I'm going back to school so and I was like fine with that and I thought like maybe next year would be great so Hanna calls me back and she's like yeah we're gonna make it into a full-time position just come on in and hear about the job and I'm like okay so before we head over there I told Caleb I was like it would be really cool if it was like a Monday through Thursday job and I was all Fridays like just being funny that that would be a really cool so I'm there and they're telling me that it's like civil hours and I can sometimes work from home and I was like okay that sounds awesome and my mind I'm thinking oh I don't want them to think I'm lazy and I just don't want to come into the office one day and so after like I talked to her boss Hanna's tell talking to me and she has another conversation I kind of a Caleb and she's like well you should just tell them right off the bat you're gonna come in the office Monday through Thursday and you're gonna stay home on Fridays the desire of your heart believe that a man why don't you set this creature grace your brother your sister in whatever way you want to tonight I won't say how but however you want to amen god bless you we'll see you Sunday get in for Sunday school red mic for the bread
