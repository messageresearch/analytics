[0:01] praise the lord so brother kevin we're
[0:02] all straight then
[0:03] ah you got it perfect that's excellent
[0:06] brother
[0:07] all right so i want then to
[0:10] rather that since i'm only using slide
[0:12] one and slide two brother kevin
[0:14] then to our very first slide uh the very
[0:17] next slide
[0:18] and uh should be the other day when i
[0:20] was driving in the other day when i was
[0:22] driving in
[0:23] streaming brother jason to mars and
[0:26] i hit a certain part in the it froze up
[0:29] on me because i'd like to get that audio
[0:31] signals going up and down plus you're
[0:33] not distracted
[0:34] all right so we want then to look at
[0:36] this very first verse we're still on it
[0:38] this is part six but imagine we're still
[0:40] on verse one the revelation of jesus
[0:43] christ
[0:44] which god gave unto him to show unto his
[0:47] servants things which must
[0:49] shortly come to pain job a little bit
[0:52] how i'm going through this book of
[0:53] revelation i realized
[0:55] that even with today being part six
[0:58] the way i'm going about it i mean just
[1:01] to get through the first couple of
[1:03] verses of the very first
[1:06] set in on teaching ministry before i
[1:08] have the entire collection
[1:11] uh for that brother lonnie jenkins
[1:13] preached on back in the
[1:14] late 90s and early 20s and early 2000s
[1:17] and so it should be
[1:18] and so we're we're but but if i'm going
[1:21] that methodically
[1:23] um it's going to take it could take a
[1:26] year
[1:26] now i want to announce that on our
[1:28] podcast that we are
[1:30] beginning to stream we have finished our
[1:32] introduction video we're now going to
[1:34] begin
[1:35] uh holding the podcast i
[1:38] am planning to go through the book of
[1:40] revelation
[1:41] like i have been very methodically and
[1:44] if it takes me 500
[1:47] recordings to do it i want to go through
[1:49] the entire book
[1:51] but here because our sunday school class
[1:53] is limited to just 25 minutes
[1:55] i want to just do it a little bit more
[1:57] an overview
[1:59] i still plan to stop and hover over
[2:02] parts that i think are
[2:03] very very important last time
[2:07] we had the church understanding
[2:10] that we we brought it down to to the
[2:13] bride and i was making this
[2:14] a fading out of one a starting up of
[2:17] another
[2:18] and a different star different messenger
[2:20] with a different mission and a different
[2:22] and a further understanding of the word
[2:25] and so because of that
[2:27] that all of those ages unbeknownst to
[2:30] them
[2:30] because god because if you you know
[2:33] brother branham uh
[2:34] talks about how that the lord would not
[2:36] really let them
[2:37] know that it was going to be 2 000 years
[2:40] that would have discouraged them
[2:41] because you know as well as i know that
[2:44] that a belief in the immediacy
[2:46] of christ's return is strengthening
[2:49] and uh i don't think the lord wanted to
[2:52] them to lose that i think in every age
[2:54] he wanted to believe he wanted them to
[2:56] believe
[2:57] that his return was imminent now we can
[3:00] look back
[3:01] in hindsight over 2000 years of history
[3:04] we now have the
[3:05] restoration of the original teaching of
[3:07] the apostles by the opening of the seals
[3:10] and not a new gospel not an addition to
[3:13] the gospel
[3:14] but a full complete unveiling of god
[3:18] with and including parts that the bride
[3:22] body of christ were to fulfill
[3:24] that the very first original age was not
[3:27] able to do
[3:28] and so they began to fall away we've
[3:30] taught on that many times
[3:32] and how that our our our mission then
[3:36] becomes slightly different because we
[3:39] are
[3:39] the church that will not taste death we
[3:42] are the last age
[3:44] and the bride leaves the ages at the end
[3:48] of chapter 3
[3:50] and she goes into a rapture and brother
[3:52] branham said she's not seen again
[3:55] until revelation 19. now then
[3:58] chapter 4 picks up a transition of the
[4:01] opening of the word
[4:02] it moves right into the throne room
[4:04] scene of the sealed book
[4:06] and a strong angel calling for a worthy
[4:10] one to come
[4:11] john representing the bride and then
[4:13] from there
[4:14] you know chapter 6 7 8 goes on starts
[4:17] talking about the
[4:18] the seven sealed mystery chapter 10 has
[4:21] him coming with an open book
[4:23] with a messenger on the earth who who is
[4:26] the facilitator
[4:28] brother branham was not the interpreter
[4:30] only christ
[4:31] could open the seals brother branham
[4:34] being a prophet
[4:35] was a facilitator for god because god
[4:38] only
[4:39] reveals these great things through
[4:41] prophets and then the prophets
[4:42] give it to the people and that's exactly
[4:44] what happens
[4:46] uh john representing the bride is
[4:48] commanded to go and ask for the little
[4:50] book he does
[4:51] he's given it but said you must eat it
[4:53] because you're going to have to become
[4:55] it
[4:56] so we realize that that's the age that
[4:58] we have come into
[5:00] and we realize that this is the age of
[5:03] the catching away where the world
[5:06] has returned to a sodom and gomorrah
[5:08] condition
[5:09] and and we realize that the bride is
[5:11] going to step
[5:12] into another dimension she's not
[5:16] uh you know going beyond the milky way
[5:18] and
[5:19] going way off into the reaches of space
[5:22] she's simply transitioning
[5:24] into another dimension
[5:28] when the when the saints from the ages
[5:32] resurrect they will be very much real
[5:35] but they will be operating in a
[5:37] dimension
[5:38] that the world cannot see and so
[5:41] it's not to say that that couldn't
[5:43] happen because
[5:44] brother branham talks about how that
[5:46] when abraham was raised at the first
[5:49] part of the first resurrection
[5:51] that he and sarah while touring
[5:53] jerusalem got spotted
[5:54] and i don't know that he got clearly
[5:56] identified brother branham
[5:58] uh is somewhat ambiguous on that but
[6:01] just
[6:01] you know telling the narrative said
[6:03] abraham said oh sir we got to go we've
[6:05] been spotted
[6:06] so i don't know listen friends there's
[6:08] some of this that we don't know and all
[6:09] the teaching in the world
[6:11] isn't going to bring it to us what we
[6:13] have found
[6:15] in this first verse of the book of
[6:17] revelation there's been a number of
[6:19] things that i
[6:20] think that we can well establish
[6:23] and that is that this would not be the
[6:26] book of revelation was written
[6:29] for the church uh that's why
[6:32] jesus doesn't outline its mysteries in
[6:35] the gospels
[6:36] paul doesn't outline its mysteries in
[6:39] his letters
[6:40] we find that john brings it back from
[6:42] his prison imprisonment on patmos
[6:45] and it is a book to the church
[6:48] uh and it's a revelation which means an
[6:50] uncovering on an apocalypse
[6:53] it's an uncovering and what it simply is
[6:56] and the simplest way to say it and
[6:58] understand it
[6:59] it is that this is the continuation
[7:03] of jesus christ in his church
[7:06] not the continuation of the nail scarred
[7:09] man
[7:09] the nail scarred man fulfilled his
[7:12] destiny
[7:13] in the earth paid redemptions price at
[7:16] calvary
[7:17] that body was laid on an altar as
[7:19] brother branham says over and over again
[7:22] as a perpetual atonement his blood
[7:24] speaking for us
[7:26] but that life that was in christ that
[7:28] lived in that nail scarred man
[7:30] has been returned back to the church
[7:34] and it's the same jesus it's not a
[7:36] different jesus
[7:38] in fact is when paul encounters him on
[7:40] the road
[7:41] he's already in that form of the pillar
[7:43] of fire
[7:44] and accuses paul of persecuting jesus
[7:48] but paul
[7:48] never never persecuted jesus but he was
[7:51] persecuting the church
[7:53] and thus persecuting jesus because the
[7:56] lord jesus was now living
[7:58] in his church the same jesus that paul
[8:01] speaks of in ephesians 3
[8:03] who created the whole world the same
[8:06] logos that
[8:07] john identified was god and all things
[8:10] were made by him and not anything was
[8:12] made that was made
[8:13] he made everything and there was nothing
[8:15] made that he didn't make
[8:17] and so now the book of revelation is the
[8:21] revelation of jesus christ
[8:23] which god gave unto him to show the
[8:26] servants
[8:26] so now it's a it's a unlocked mystery to
[8:30] us
[8:31] and we look at it in perspective it
[8:33] gives us context
[8:34] now to how that christ operated down
[8:37] through
[8:38] the ages that it was christ in his
[8:41] church
[8:42] manifesting himself in flesh and when
[8:45] you see that then you begin to
[8:47] understand who jesus was
[8:51] in a much broader sense you realize
[8:54] that jesus christ was not just
[8:57] the man that walked the shores of
[8:59] galilee
[9:00] jesus christ primarily is the word
[9:04] in whatever manifestation the word
[9:08] comes to in your age that's
[9:11] jesus to your age so
[9:14] when people today try to claim
[9:18] that jesus christ is their lord and that
[9:21] they are christians
[9:22] and yet you don't see my sins and thus
[9:25] and god who couldn't die in spirit form
[9:28] inhabits a human body that he creates
[9:31] from his
[9:31] own word both both seed and egg
[9:35] created in the womb of the virgin and
[9:38] therefore he is the word
[9:39] made flesh but what the book of
[9:42] revelation was going to bring
[9:45] us to understand that it would be
[9:48] this this was this was what paul
[9:50] referred to
[9:51] as the great mystery and the only thing
[9:55] paul says about it
[9:56] is that it's christ in you
[10:00] the hope of glory and so the book of
[10:02] revelation now is all about that
[10:04] mystery that we find out that as god
[10:09] as the logos as jesus the eternal god
[10:13] and that he come in his father's name
[10:15] his name at all has always been that
[10:17] and we when we find out that he lived in
[10:20] a
[10:21] single body that walked the shores of
[10:24] galilee
[10:25] and they wanted to make him a king but
[10:27] we realized that jesus
[10:29] showed them that that couldn't be
[10:31] because a seed that didn't die
[10:33] abideth alone and but if it die
[10:36] then it brings forth much and so when
[10:39] when people
[10:40] look simply back to a historical jesus
[10:44] and they and they realize that that's
[10:46] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[10:49] the reason that they're missing the
[10:52] baptism of the holy ghost and the full
[10:54] new birth
[10:54] is because they don't see that same
[10:57] jesus
[10:58] now living in a mini-membered body
[11:01] whereas that
[11:02] that logos that dwelt in one body
[11:05] now lives in many membered body and
[11:07] brother branham uses that very exact
[11:10] language that this bride globally
[11:14] by the token the book of revelation is
[11:17] all about
[11:17] and that's why the world is missing it
[11:20] they don't realize that that same
[11:22] historical character
[11:24] lives today and he's he's the same
[11:27] yesterday today and forever he was alive
[11:31] yesterday he's alive today he was alive
[11:35] before he lived on the earth born of a
[11:37] virgin
[11:38] he was alive before there was stardust
[11:41] it's the same god unfolding himself
[11:44] unfolding himself and that's the great
[11:47] mystery
[11:48] of the godhead so you always want to
[11:51] remember when you're trying to explain
[11:52] that to somebody
[11:54] that he is primarily the word he's not
[11:57] merely a historical figure that's what
[12:01] verse 1 is telling you that's what the
[12:04] the revelation of jesus christ
[12:07] which god gave unto him to show unto his
[12:10] servants
[12:11] catch it things which must shortly come
[12:14] to pass
[12:15] and and and he sent and signified it by
[12:18] his angel
[12:19] unto his servant john so he had an angel
[12:23] messenger a prophet in the first age
[12:26] the apostle paul and he bookends the
[12:29] ages
[12:30] at the end time with another prophet an
[12:32] angel messenger
[12:34] so that the so that the fullness of the
[12:37] word
[12:37] reformers could never get there the
[12:40] fullness of the word has to come to pass
[12:42] because the book of revelation is
[12:44] declaring and
[12:45] showing how that that same jesus
[12:48] who lived would die be buried resurrect
[12:52] empty paradise take the old testament
[12:55] saints home
[12:56] lay that body on an altar descend back
[12:58] into the earth
[12:59] come into his church and then
[13:01] synchronously live in his church
[13:03] through seven contiguous not only
[13:06] continuous they were contiguous in that
[13:08] they butted up against each other
[13:10] there was no in between space in the
[13:13] church
[13:13] where jesus wasn't active that's that's
[13:16] the contiguousness
[13:18] of the ages but they were also
[13:21] continuous and overlapping so that they
[13:25] overlapped as we've talked about the
[13:27] olympiad
[13:28] where uh uh uh uh the the relay runner
[13:32] takes off running and the man's coming
[13:35] behind him reaching forth with the baton
[13:37] he takes it
[13:38] the man behind fades off the man with it
[13:41] now runs forward until he gets to the
[13:43] next man
[13:44] this is why paul would say that we're
[13:47] you know everyone enters a race but only
[13:49] the ones who finish it
[13:51] win the race and so paul even uses
[13:54] the the olympics there in greece and the
[13:56] games that they had there
[13:59] uh to illustrate the the journey that
[14:01] the church is
[14:02] on and so we realize then that
[14:06] we are the last leg of the relay we
[14:09] run all the way to the body change
[14:13] or you could call it part
[14:16] two of the first resurrection
[14:19] because part one of the first
[14:22] resurrection
[14:23] was when christ dis ascended up with the
[14:25] old testament saints emptying paradise
[14:28] and this is why the bible talks about
[14:30] that
[14:31] that the ones who are redeemed and made
[14:33] part of the first resurrection and go in
[14:35] the rapture at the
[14:37] at the day and hour that we live in
[14:39] these are the ones upon whom the second
[14:41] death hath no power there's a general
[14:44] resurrection
[14:47] for judgment but we're not part of that
[14:50] because
[14:50] uh we're part of the first resurrection
[14:53] we're taught on this extensively
[14:55] uh in the in the podcast i'll go into it
[14:57] more with more detail
[14:59] but we've taught on it extensively that
[15:01] you only come to the new birth
[15:04] by a revelation of jesus christ who is
[15:06] the word
[15:08] and it's a they asked brother branham he
[15:09] says brother branham would
[15:11] speaking in the third person would say
[15:13] you say brother branham what is the new
[15:15] birth
[15:16] and he says it is a revelation of jesus
[15:19] christ
[15:20] personally to you to you personally
[15:24] and so christ is his word and so
[15:27] every time that god reveals by his
[15:30] spirit
[15:31] his word his personage in his word
[15:34] to someone and they accept that and amen
[15:38] that
[15:38] then that is their pathway that is god's
[15:41] provided way
[15:43] to the new birth god only has one
[15:46] provided way
[15:47] and that's through the blood of his son
[15:49] and that's why
[15:50] the john would say that if we walk in
[15:53] the light
[15:54] who's the light christ what's christ the
[15:56] word
[15:57] in him was life and that life not
[16:00] merely the historical figure that's
[16:03] that's
[16:04] necessary but it's not merely that that
[16:06] if we fail you could stand all day long
[16:10] and agree that the man who hung on
[16:12] calvary
[16:13] was god in flesh his words were true and
[16:16] you believe it
[16:17] absolutely but if you then rejected the
[16:20] doctrine and teachings of the apostles
[16:22] there would be no way to stand in the
[16:25] presence of god
[16:26] accepted you couldn't do that you
[16:28] couldn't come up to god and say lord
[16:30] i was at golgotha i saw you die i
[16:33] followed you
[16:34] i believed you i heard your teachings i
[16:36] accept you
[16:37] but this peter guy and paul and john and
[16:39] james i you know and jude i
[16:41] i don't need them i don't need them
[16:43] telling me i just want jesus
[16:45] but you would never be stand in the
[16:48] presence of god
[16:49] acceptably with that kind of an attitude
[16:52] neither can you do it today
[16:54] you have to receive god in christ
[16:57] in his word and thus john would say if
[17:00] we walk in the light
[17:02] the revealed word christ in the form of
[17:04] his word revealed
[17:06] if we walk in that light as he's in the
[17:08] light as he's revealing it
[17:11] then then the blood of jesus cleanses
[17:14] us from all sin then we have fellowship
[17:17] one with another why
[17:18] because we are the unified family of god
[17:22] birthed by faith in the word which is
[17:24] christ all right
[17:27] so we find then that that his form
[17:31] in this age of the book of revelation
[17:34] that his form the form of christ is
[17:38] the true church that when you have
[17:40] christ embodied
[17:42] in a believer by the holy ghost
[17:45] that's the true church that's why that
[17:48] in the
[17:48] in the early era uh in the early years
[17:52] the spirit of antichrist rose up trying
[17:55] to build a church
[17:56] and and called themselves the true
[17:58] church the periclesia
[18:00] and called the true church false and
[18:03] called themselves who were false
[18:05] true and god just simply came down and
[18:08] says all right fine
[18:09] if you're going to take that label then
[18:11] i'm going to require it of you
[18:13] and if you and if you don't come my
[18:15] provided way then i'm gonna judge you
[18:17] for that
[18:18] because even you see that principle in
[18:20] the gospels false teachers and lawyers
[18:22] and woe unto you
[18:23] and you know and you're full of dead
[18:25] men's bones and men walk over the top of
[18:27] you and don't realize they're walking
[18:28] over
[18:29] over tombs and here these holy men say
[18:32] you know are we blocking you of sin
[18:35] because you can't disbelieve
[18:36] what you don't know but because you say
[18:40] we see your sin remains and so we find
[18:44] that right here
[18:45] coming into the early ages that the
[18:48] false church rose up
[18:49] saying we're the church and jesus says
[18:52] fine
[18:52] that's the way you want to play that's
[18:54] the way we'll go and that's why he's
[18:56] going to
[18:57] judge her as a at the end time
[19:01] because she prostituted herself
[19:04] claiming to be his wife claiming to be
[19:07] his bride
[19:08] but prostituted the word of god
[19:11] and adulterated the word of god and went
[19:14] whoring with the sins of the world but
[19:17] in
[19:18] every age god maintained a
[19:21] true bride christ walking in the midst
[19:25] of the seven lamp stands and so we're
[19:28] going to pause there today
[19:30] uh from this at this point in the
[19:32] podcast we will go deeply
[19:35] into the mystery of the godhead we don't
[19:37] need to do that
[19:38] here uh we've covered the godhead
[19:41] extensively here preaching
[19:42] brother jason to mars has covered it
[19:44] very extensively
[19:46] we don't need to cover that portion of
[19:48] it i would like to get to verse two
[19:50] uh so hopefully verse 2 will be able to
[19:54] begin with
[19:54] on next sunday i hope that covers verse
[19:58] 1
[19:58] thoroughly uh the revelation of jesus
[20:01] christ which god gave unto him
[20:03] to show to his servants things which
[20:05] must shortly come to pass
[20:07] and he sent and signified it by his
[20:09] angel
[20:10] unto its servant john so it's going to
[20:12] be the revelation of christ
[20:14] that he gives to the church of his
[20:17] movements
[20:18] through 2000 years seven
[20:21] contiguous church ages and we're at the
[20:24] last one
[20:25] we're at the capping we're at the
[20:26] wrapping up we've already had the
[20:28] seventh
[20:29] star in the right hand of god it's all
[20:31] the stars have been deployed
[20:33] they've all been used they've all been
[20:35] recalled and now the bride
[20:37] is eating the book because you are what
[20:40] you eat and so we're becoming because
[20:42] what we're eating is christ the word
[20:44] not a man we're not feeding on a man
[20:46] we're feeding on the body word
[20:48] of the son of man so god bless you today
[20:51] let's let's pray father we thank you for
[20:54] our sunday school class today
[20:56] and i pray that you will give
[20:58] understanding and open the eyes lord
[21:00] and not just in a theological way
[21:03] but i i might my goal is that the church
[21:07] can see
[21:08] their part in all of this this is why
[21:10] brother branham would call it a great
[21:12] drama
[21:13] and lord i feel privileged to be a part
[21:15] of it today may you bless the teaching
[21:17] of your word
[21:18] in jesus name amen god bless you saints
[21:21] brother sister you can sit right there
[21:23] the church this regular service will
[21:24] begin in five or ten minutes or so
