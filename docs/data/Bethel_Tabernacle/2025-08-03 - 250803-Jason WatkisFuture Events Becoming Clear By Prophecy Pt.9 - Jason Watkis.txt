I want that holy life. One more time. I want that holy life. I want that holy way. I want to be free from strife and do what Jesus said. I want that whole life. I have a vision, a vision in my view. I'm pressing my way, trying to make it through. There's a marriage supper that's been called by the lamb. I'm going to be there. I'm going to be there. Yes, I am. I want that holy life. I want that holy way. I want to be free from strife and do what Jesus said. I want that holy life. I want that holy ghost burning me down in my soul.

Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap of praise. Hallelujah. Amen. You can be seated just for a moment. Just wanted us to take just one second before we change the order of the service to uh make a couple announcements and just say a few comments. Brother Tony, if you'd be ready to sing that again. Amen. Not all of these are present here in the building right now. But I would just like if you could to stand up as I call your name. I want to recognize all of those that came yesterday. And we had a good team. We had a really good team helping. um was really awesome because most of the people large part of them um don't have kids uh that are that age that would use that anymore. At least your kids shouldn't be out there. Teenagers um and others uh who really just don't are not at that stage of life. And so they were out there helping. So we just want to recognize them. If you didn't see it when you came in, uh we have the new playground area uh mostly complete. uh today uh yesterday we we had a real good strike force and uh we got it done rather quickly. The Lord so blessed us. Um my goodness, it was so hot this past week and yesterday morning when we started it was cloudy. It was actually chilly about 6:00 this morning. Uh 6:00 Saturday morning it was actually chilly outside. I think the Lord did that just for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we're just thankful for that. And so there's a few more things that we're going to do. uh was still considering maybe putting down some type of rubber mulch or something out there. Uh also, we need to finish the gates, but I just want these, even if you're on an instrument, put your instrument down and stand up. Uh Brother Aaron and Sister Ruth Simmons, if you would stand up. Brother John Lichek, Brother Charles, just hold your applause for a second. Brother Charles Alderman, uh, Brother George Buckman, Brother Jason, Sister Amy, and, uh, Avery and Mina Dears, Chris Watkins, get off the drum. Stand up. Come on, stand up as I call your name. Brother Andrew Cobb, Brother Danny, and Brother Landon, if they would stand. Also, my wife Rachel and me also helping. Brother Micah Curtis, stand up, brother. Brother Caleb Buckman, who's in the back, uh, mixing there. We just want to I just wanted to show you just for a minute these that labored and uh made that possible. Why don't we give them a round of applause? So, thank you for your help. Uh like I said, most of those didn't uh they did it for you. Those of you that have children that will get to enjoy that. Amen. We just wanted to make that possible. Um just one more thing I just wanted to say. Um some of now that we have that um we have some rules uh that that have been we've been real leaning on over the past few weeks for the toddler uh carpet crawlers area uh back there in the fellowship hall that we want to read to you and make sure that you uh the parents especially um will make sure you you enforce this. We want to make sure that it's clear, really clear, as I said, we've been lenient because we didn't have this, that any children um that are seven and up are not permitted at any time at any time in that play area. So, six and under is who that toddler area is for. Parents, please, if your children are in there, please ask them to leave. Tell them they're not. Don't just We're going to post these rules up before we've got them posted on the glass, but just because they're posted, don't just assume your children will obey them. Um, some of them can't read them. So, just make sure that you enforce that yourself. We don't want to have to ask Brother Luther to um to say something or to get them out of there. So, uh you just avoid that like the plague. And we'll um uh also toys. This is important. The toys that we bought and purchased toys for the toddler area, they are for the toddler area only. They're not permitted in the fellowship hall at all. So, please do not let your children do not take those toys out of there. They are designated for that spot. Um, keep them in the playyard only. The last few services, they were brought in and spread out throughout the fellowship hall, which created quite a mess for the ones that clean the fellowship hall. for the person that cleans. Also, we're getting reports that there were balls being thrown from there in the fellowship hall and a picture almost came down. So, we want to remember to keep those toys in there at at all times. Um, if you see your child taking them out, put them back in. Um, because of the rain through the week, before you leave that area, before you leave on Wednesday or before you leave on Sunday, please clean up the toys. Um, and put them back in the provided bins that we have. And those bins are stored under the bench that's out there. So, put them back in the bins. Don't leave a mess, please. If you do, then it gets rained on and those toys won't last. Um the screening that we have uh doesn't it just provides shade. We got it intentional that the water through so as to not sag. So make sure please do a good job uh cleaning that area up. Um also as I said um we've been real lenient these past few weeks because we know it's hard for the older kids but um uh because they didn't have anything but now that that that they do please uh know that we're going to try to enforce these rules um as best as possible. Amen. Man, was that a little easier than if I had Brother Luther read these rules? I'm just teasing Brother Luther. I love you. Amen. We all love. Don't we all love Brother Luther? Amen. Give the Lord a hand clap of praise. Let's all stand back to our feet. You ready for the word this morning? Did you come with a need? How many have a need and expectation? Let's just turn our hearts to the Lord now. Amen. Raise our hands and and sing this with brother. Jesus said, "I want that holy [Music] life. I want that holy life. I want that holy way. I want to be free from strife and do what Jesus said. I want that holy life. I want that holy life. I want that holy way. I want to be free from strife and do what Jesus said. I want that holy [Music] life. [Music] Praise. Sorry. Okay. Amen. You got me. Okay. Praise the Lord. I'm hearing a feedback echo. Oh, okay. You'll fix it. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you. Turn around and shake hands with somebody. Say, "God bless you." Happy to have you here in the house of God today. Amen. Amen. Sure appreciate all of that and all of those announcements and I appreciate all the people who make made all that possible. Amen. And praise God. I uh I was over here studying yesterday in my office and I brought my a really nice uh I would have never bought it. I'd have never known to bought it, but I have a good friend, but I won't uh call his name, but his initial was a Mark Carter. And he he turned me on to this amazing little handheld drill. It was so light. I'd been using some big bulky DeWalt thing. I thought it was a manly thing. And Mark shows up with this little bitty guy. And man, it felt good in my hand. So, I went and bought one and I covered that thing. I'm careful about it and I brought it yesterday. I thought, who can I loan this to? It's going to have to be somebody that's used to handling delicate equipment. I said, "Brother Andrew, praise the Lord." And so, somebody that's used to uh handling delicate equipment that won't break it and put it back like it goes. And um and then uh Landon got a hold of it. And I was shocked at how mechanical Landon was. He figured it out faster than I could. And which irritated me a little bit, but he just took one look at it. Zip, zip, bang, bang, and away way he went. I'm going, you need brother L if you No. Okay, never mind. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. But I sure appreciated all that all that help yesterday. And I think it's just beautiful, wonderful. And so we've got more things uh that we're trying to do a little bit as we go along while we're still um you know squirreling away uh funds to start the major framing renovation of our extension. We're trying to do little things that we are going to want to do and we're trying to get all those out of the way. So it's wonderful. Amen. Hey um brother Kevin, I'm going to jump you this morning. I I sent Hebrews 13:8 and we're going to go there, but let's go first to Numbers 14 for me. Numbers 14. We want to take our ninth installment this morning on future events becoming clear in prophecy. I think by now you know that you are the event. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride of Christ um the manifestation. You say why are we the event? Well, it has nothing to do with how you look or smell. It has everything to do with the fact. Even even brother Brandham said it's not the man that comes predestinated. It's the seed inside the man. See, the Bible says that except he left us a seed, we would be allto together like unto Sodom and Gomorrah. So there's no it's no arrogance or pride in it. It's just God's choosing completely. He gets all the glory. We cannot uh we don't deserve nor can we earn any of it because it's all by his grace. if he doesn't, you know, you might build the house and watch the city, but if the Lord doesn't watch it, and if the Lord doesn't build it, &gt;&gt; uh doesn't say you won't build or work or watch, it just won't do you any good. Uh unless the Lord keep the city or the Lord keep the home or the Lord keep your family. See, so the Lord has to keep a church, the Lord has to build. I'm constantly um you know, I'm constantly using that um uh to the Lord to say, "These are your people." Well, you remember the Lord said to Moses, you know, thy people. And Moses said, uh, they're your people and I told you they would do this and uh, your people have done it. And so Moses quickly reminded the Lord, these are your people. And I'm constantly doing that, saying, Lord, these are your people. They're not mine. They're I know I'm all the time walking in and go, "Hey, my people." But really, you're God's people. And I'm I'm part of that family as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. Numbers 14 and and as I was saying, you are the reason that you are the event made clear in history and the modern event is because of this overriding fact from Genesis to Revelation. Every time God manifested himself in an expression, that was an event made clear in prophecy. And there were lots of events going on in the world when he made himself known to Abraham as a in the body of a man as Melzdc, right? Lots of events. There were lots of things going on uh you know in Israel when Jesus came on the scene. There were lots of things happening in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the uttermost part of the earth when the day of Pentecost came. But that was the one event that God recognized in his book to say this is the event. There's lots of events, but this is the one because that was a further expression of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you're an event not because you're you're special in your own rights, but because you are the continuing unfolding, the continuing manifestation of Almighty God in an expression. Amen. We're going to look at that today. Numbers 14:es 20- 24. And the Lord said, I have pardoned according to thy word, but as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord. because of those things, I'm sorry, because of those men which have seen my glory and my miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these 10 times, and have not hearkened to my voice. Surely they shall not see the land which I swear unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it. Verse 24. But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went, and his seed shall possess it. So those those seed of Caleb th the the ones who are of that same spirit. Amen. So, so we realize that we are enjoined by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We are enjoined through the blood of Christ back to Abraham. And now we are inheritors of Abraham's promise. Amen. So, it's the same. I want you to really pay close attention to that. It's not that Caleb was, you know, any better than anybody else, but he had a different spirit that was guiding him. And that was a choice. Y &gt;&gt; fact is it was more of a choice than you even face today because you have the Holy Ghost which gives you a new nature. Caleb had no access to being born again of the spirit of God like you. He had a gene of God but he couldn't. That's where brother B talked about David. The thing that wearied David was that he he said I I've tied his word to my bed post. I put it between my eyes. I meditate on it day and night. But the thing that wearied David is he couldn't make it manifest like he knew it should. &gt;&gt; And that wearied him. And I I just love the fact that you don't have to suffer. David's weary. Amen. You can surrender so freely and let your heart go in the direction that God intended for it. Man is finally free to do that. The new birth is the only place of freedom. Otherwise, you're driven by a fallen nature and you have no freedom. The only freedom is in Christ. And then you actually have the freedom to choose to be like God. Amen. Now, you still have to choose it, but you can choose it. Right? All right. So, let's read. Oh, we we already we've already read verse. I want to read verse 24 again. But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath fully and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land where he went, and his seed shall possess it. Now, Hebrews 13, um, and we're going to just read the eighth verse alone. Um, I'll probably read it before you can even get there. Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever. Amen. Let's pray. Master, we thank you for your word today. Thank you for this wonderful audience and all of the wonderful worship and singing. And Lord, it just thrilled my heart. I come in this morning and oh my just such a such a um a business of God's kingdom going on. And Father, as I as I come in, I can I can hear the word going forth from the Sunday school teacher. I can hear the worship team leading in song and they're practicing and getting ready. I can hear the the Sunday school teacher of the little small children, Lord. And and I'm sitting in my office and I can hear it all at once, Father. and and I've got the Sunday school coming in on the speakers and I can hear the next door children. I can hear down the hall and it just warmed my heart. Lord, I just felt like I'm right in the big middle of something wonderful. And I pray now today that you will take all the glory to yourself, your great name. Lord, we owe you everything. There's no way we could ever repay you for the debt of love that we owe. Now Lord, will you be our helper in the word as we go forward in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you friends. You can be seated. Yesterday I had a uh wonderful opportunity to have lunch again with one of my grandsons and um was actually Uriah and he was uh off a little early and I had some free time and so was able to meet him for lunch and I I think it was yesterday. Might have been uh actually might have been Friday. I can't remember now. Uh might have been Friday. But um nonetheless, yeah, it was I believe it was Friday, in fact. And so, you know, we began to strike up a conversation. And I I love that my I love I love knowing, you know, my my grandchildren are constantly bringing up spiritual things to me and question this and and a question there and and talk about and they were talking to someone and those things thrill my heart and you know, Uriah and I got to talking about the the that that that um that divergence between light and darkness and and and the madness that we see in the world and you know the the the area between right and wrong, that area between light and darkness, that area um that defines the middle of ascending versus descending. And we talked about how that it's getting worse. And I said, "You see, Uriah," I said, "Because that the bride of Christ is in an order of ascending and that the God of this evil age with all of his with all of his followers are descending." Remember, Brother Brandham saw in the vision of the preview of the bride and he said when they got to the end of that edge and he said they fell off and went off into the abyss and he said the most horrible screams you ever heard as they were plunging down. And he said, "But as I looked," he said, "the bride instead of going down, she started going up." And I've so appreciated the fact that after he says, "She started going up." Then he says, you know, two or three of them at the end of the line, those those last day saints, the ones that are living in the impossible time &gt;&gt; when darkness is so prevalent and spirits are so free and go and Satan is the god of this evil age. I'm here to tell you friends, if it were not for the word that we have and the near presence of the Holy Ghost and every church service you can get to and every time you can get on your knees and every time you can read a Bible or play a tape, I'm here to tell you that is your survival kit. You cannot survive it. It's too dark. It's too dismal. I'm not saying you'd lose your gene of God. I'm not saying you wouldn't become a child of God because that's something that you've passed from death to life can never lose. But I'm here to tell you, I don't just want to be a son of God. I want to be strong. I want to be running the race. I don't want to be stumbling across the finish line. When I cross, when I used to run track, I used to love to cross the finish line at full speed. And and it was just a a matter of pride. I loved it. No matter how much I had slowed down and and and and you know languished along and got past and but when I saw the finish line in sight, I don't know, just as a young boy, there was something that came within me to say there's the finish line and I got some energy to burn and I'm going to light it. And I'm here to tell you something, friends. On all eight cylinders, pedal to the metal as hard as I could go, I'd fly across that finish line. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the coach, it irritated him because he he knew that that meant I had left energy on the track that I could have used. And he wasn't wrong. And it and he don't even know. And but it was a lesson. It's a lesson to me today that I don't just want to, you know, cross the finish line full speed. I'd like to be at full speed now &gt;&gt; cuz I don't know where the finish line is. I know it's out there somewhere and I know every day I'm getting closer to it, but I want to be running at mock speed. I want to be turning it on. I want to be I want to hit the jets. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, we we were we were it led in our conversation. I said, "So that's why Uriah because the world is in an order of descending." And as brother Brandham said, those two or three at the end, right at the end, and that was the preview coming back, you know, she he had already seen her the first time and then it came back again. And then at the very end of the coming back crowd of that restored bride tree, two or three of them at the end of the line uh were getting out of step. And every once in a while I look out and two or three of you are getting out of step. And and sometimes I look in the mirror and I'm getting out of step. But I'm glad they stayed ascending. &gt;&gt; They stayed ascending. And and the only thing that a prophet said was, "Get back in step. Get back in line. Stay in line." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he said when I came to I was standing in the room with my arms reached out saying stay in line. &gt;&gt; So let me just remind you today as I remind my own self we need to stay in line. We need to be running at the pace of the Holy Spirit. Not ahead of him not behind him. And just say Lord take over my whole life. As brother Tony was singing. I I I want it all. I want that holy life. I want to know that he's pleased with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Caleb had a different kind of a spirit and God noticed it. God always notices a different kind of spirit. I'll say more on that perhaps in a little bit. I didn't expect to use that this morning. Lord laid it on my heart before I left the house. And uh brother Jason's Sunday school class. I wasn't sure whether to use it. It seemed to confirm it with some of the things he said. So we we'll get to it here just in a little bit. So, you know, we our conversation then that that made a perfect segue to uh Uriah asked me, he said, 'You know, uh the thing I love about, you know, the message, papo, is that it's so evident that Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, then forever. and that that here's a young man who's, you know, in a in a liberal university and all of the nonsense that he's bombarded with there. And yet he's got something burning in his heart that he has an appreciation that Jesus is just as reliable now as he's ever been. &gt;&gt; That you can count on him now just like the disciples did then. And it and when they're when they were thinking they were going to drown, he came walking on the water and he can come walking on on top of your trial right now. He's the same one. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, in talking to that, I realized that it it lent to the thought of my series here. And I so I just I said, you know, Uriah, let me add just a layer on top of Hebrews 13:8. It's important to remember and it it's um it's a little tricky. You have to think think this through, but I know you'll catch it. And I said, remember that one of the things he's the same in is that he's always going forward, evolving, unfolding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he's always Now, he doesn't change. Whatever his evolution is, it's going to have the same character that it had back there. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he but the the thing that he's the most consistent about, he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Which means he's consistently all the way through. And the most consistent thing about God since Genesis is that he's on a mission to unfold himself into a kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And everything. and this and and it's and because of that because that's how he has operated, mankind drawing from the tree of knowledge see him as as a polytheistic being. Sometimes they see him as two gods or two lords or three gods or they might see him as a for-footed creature, a reptile or a bird or something they can carve in a wood in a wood figurine or a stone. And and and we realize that this is because God hides himself behind the the mystery of that. And mankind is for sure going to misunderstand him except God rich in mercy reveals himself and and revelation is granted to the human that goes beyond their understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if you just use human understanding, he can very much look like multiple persons. &gt;&gt; Now, there's so much evidence against it that you dare not take that path because the Bible is so clear. But understand that you are in an extreme minority &gt;&gt; that the whole world even though and even if you can prove to them. Brother George and I were having a conversation yesterday about some people who actually could go back and and were acknowledging at 100% how it got changed. It wasn't part of the early disciples. It's not what they believed. They can track it through history. They believe the history and and at the end of the day they they knowing that it was altered from the early church but their tradition is so entrenched. They're so entrenched in their tradition that they still believe &gt;&gt; he's three persons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I I feel sorry for that level of &gt;&gt; of that lack of understanding. It makes me so grateful to God that I know him and the power of his resurrection and and I've done nothing to earn it. But somehow he has made himself known to me and he's made himself known to you. There's nothing more valuable. You'll never chase, you'll never accomplish, you'll never acquire, you'll never achieve. No station you ever will arrive to will exceed the value that God can make himself known to you. And you get it and you absorb it and you amen it and you start walking according to it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; After the fulfillment of Malachi 4, that's one that we talk about a lot, the fulfillment of Malachi 4. We we attach that uh through a daisy chain of other scriptures and we end up at Revelation 18:4, which of course in my mind has always been what the message of the hour is. Uh Malachi 4 indicates the spirit that'll be on the prophet and what it will accomplish. It'll turn the hearts of the It'll be the spirit of Elijah turning the hearts of the of the last day gentile church back to the faith of the original church fathers. &gt;&gt; But what the message is is in 18 Revelation 18:4 come out of her my people. And so, so, so when we when we talk about Malachi 4 and its fulfillment, Revelation 18 and its fulfillment, you know, we we you're a that's a that's a movement. Uh, I mean, to say that's a forward advancing. There was a time when no one knew definitively what Malachi 4:es 5 and 6 meant &gt;&gt; because it hadn't been fulfilled. There was a time when they didn't understand. It came back with John. Paul was already gone. He had he couldn't read it. He couldn't God wasn't going to have uh Paul go through and reveal what God was now sealing up down through the ages. And the further and further they got away from the truth, the more the word of God got sealed up until the last day when he said, "Now I'm going to fulfill Malachi 4, and I'm going to unravel. I'm going to untie. I'm going to unseal what I sealed." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we've been showing you that it's how that God has revealed himself all the way from Genesis. He, you know, people sometimes get stuck at Daniel, sealed up to the end time, but God was revealing before Daniel and God kept revealing after Daniel. It just meant there were particular parts at the end time that were not going to be made known. We talked about this last week. Brother Brandon talked about the church ages. God would not even let the church know &gt;&gt; that there were going to be seven ages in 2,000 years. He said because it would have it would have harmed their their zeal, their expectancy because well, he's not even coming in my lifetime. Why don't why should I be zealous? So they they weren't even privy to that. Uh you know that's and so as we said Paul never needed to teach on Daniel 70 weeks. They it never needed to be understood uh what what a lamb coming forward from the eternities who had been back there interceding for ignorance. The early church would have went what ignorance. What are you talking about? He's then back there interceding for who? For his for his people. Why would we need anyone to intercede? Because you're going to go off into false doctrine. What &gt;&gt; you see? So, so now we come at the end time and we realize that the message of the hour is not something beyond uh the the fundamental teachings of the Bible. You cannot add to it. And brother Brandham, even as far along as the as the as the leadup to the seals and even going into the first seal, still felt like that there were seven un unknown seals on the back part of the book. But then he comes along later and says, "No, I realized it can't be something outside of the Bible. It's got to be everything inside of here. It's only hidden until the time it needs to be revealed." And when that time meets prophecy, then God goes forward. &gt;&gt; And so Christianity, it should not shock you when I say you should still be growing. Amen. &gt;&gt; It should not be strange for me to say you should be you're supposed to be a more fervent Christian today than you were yesterday. &gt;&gt; See, you're not supposed to have this up and down life. You're in an order of ascending. And I'm just glad that God is in control of it all because uh we have all ended up falling off the cliff. But I'm so glad that he redeemed me. He has revealed himself to me. And and yes, my body gives me all kinds of problems. My memory, my conscience, my region, reasoning, my affection, my imagination, it all gets in my way. But there's another me down on the inside that's that was not and is not the son of Ed and Jean Watkins, but he is a son of God who came who was in Christ and has been expressed in this age. And so that's how I am able to understand the Godhead because you have to be a part of the Godhead to catch that revelation. &gt;&gt; You're not even open. You can't even catch that revelation unless you're actually part of the substance of the Godhead itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so this is why brother Brandon would talk about that and use that kind of language that we're actually part of that triunity of God. That's right off the tape that we're actually uh uh you know within God's godhead. and and and so so we realize that it's all about expression. You have to just understand that God is constantly unfolding himself in expression. He's not here to unfold knowledge to puff you up and make you a knowit-all. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; if you ab let me tell you, if you absorb knowledge and get it and don't do it, you're worse off than the man who didn't get it. &gt;&gt; That's right. See, because you know Jesus, they they you know those lawyers, those Pharisees, Sadducees, they were they hate him so much. And you know, here he is, you know, uh way laying the church there of that day. And they said, and he said, "Oh, you're blind. You're blind leaders of the blind." And the dead walk over, they they don't even realize they're walking over graves. And they said, you know, "Are we blind also?" And here they are doctors of divinity. And they know he's a Galilean who has no formal education. So they think they got him. They weren't ready for his answer. Are we blind also? And Jesus says, "Well, if you were blind, then you'd have somewhat of an excuse. &gt;&gt; But because you say we see, your guilt remains." &gt;&gt; Amen. See? &gt;&gt; And so people who puff themselves up with knowledge, you're you don't realize that you're in a dangerous place to not let it live in you. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; so you and and and you you really at at only a knowledge level. That's why you cannot there there is no um endound on the new birth. &gt;&gt; There's no endound on the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You have to have an experience with God to bring that gene of God to life. He's the only one who can do it. Knowledge won't bring it to life. Knowledge helps it grow. Knowledge helps it understand the world. Helps it understand who it is because it it needs to know who it is because then it can do the greater works. But knowledge can't do that. It takes a supernatural fireb breathing experience of the God who's who gave you the seed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can't short circuit. It doesn't matter how long you sit in a message church. &gt;&gt; Old Maize Jackson, I don't know if anybody ever used to hear the truckers truck driver special. Maize Jackson, man, I love that guy. And he used to he used to always say, "Friend, sitting in a church won't make you a Christian anymore than sitting in a garage will make you an automobile. I used to say, "Praise the Lord, brother Maize." Amen. [Music] Such warriors of the faith. Going to meet meet him some of these days. So, so this helps us then to explain the madness that we see in these two divergent realities uh between light and darkness, between ascending and descending as brother Brandham saw that in the preview of the bride. It's been famously said, I've tried like crazy to find exactly who said it. uh doesn't I couldn't find it and it doesn't matter because Jesus actually is the one who first taught it but they this author didn't give him credit so I'll go ahead and give him credit and and this author whoever he may be said there is no darkness like the one when the light that once was has gone out &gt;&gt; and Jesus taught that that that you know that there's a light inside you and and if that light goes out Jesus says how dark is that &gt;&gt; because It's now darker than it was. You had been better off to never have heard the light. See, to not allow your life to say amen to it. So, so as we say now, all right, so I've got you in that in that thinking. You're understanding. You're we're on the same page. It's all about going forward. It's all about God unfolding. You you're not just here passing time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, because the millennium's still in time. You're not escaping time going in the rapture, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You're not going to escape time. It's still going on all the way into the millennium for a thousand years, 10 centuries. See? &gt;&gt; So, so it's not about passing up time and getting to, you know, this achievement or that achievement. It's about my life becoming an unfolding event in modern history according to prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And because of that, we don't always understand why our life goes the way it does. And I just want to say to you today, that's not because you're illiterate. It's because sometimes you just don't know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you and things are unfolding in your life that you cannot put a logical explanation to. Job ran into that exact same problem. Job could rationalize it. He was a sensible man. He said, 'You know, if I if I had cheated a man of his wages, if I had taken a maiden in the field against her will, if I had done this or done that, he said, then I could understand, but I'm innocent of these things. I've done none of these things. But but but Job, you know, he's um and finally God comes down and who is this and filling the air with these dark sayings and somebody that talks like they know what they're talking about and don't even know nothing. &gt;&gt; And and he he talks about, you know, can you take polites by the tail? Can you handle this one? Can you do that? Do you have store rooms of treasure like I have of hail saved up for the day of judgment? Did Did you fashion the corners of the earth? Tell me if you did that so I can I'd like to know. &gt;&gt; And Job put his hand over his mouth and he said, "I just know nothing. I spoke of things I didn't even understand." So let me tell you what to say, friends. No matter what life throws at you, just in all things give God glory. In all things, praise the Lord. He's got you. He's got this. He knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; So, so then it, so then when we go beyond Malachi 4 and then we go beyond 18, Revelation 18:4, those things are h have been fulfilled and are in fulfillment. The the shout, the voice, the trumpet, the shout is still going on. Now, we don't have a prophet here, and I don't need an eighth messenger to go back and re-shout. But you understand, we're still spreading books and we're still spreading tapes and and and I just saw a video the other day uh that brother Barry that this church uh participates in supporting in that vision vision books program. Uh and and here's this African church in the middle of who knows where. And the believers are just rejoicing as they're getting their hands on a seal book in their own language. That's something you take for granted to them. It was the greatest treasure. They're being handed a Bible. They've never had a Bible. and been a believer for decades. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we worry when our toaster doesn't work. &gt;&gt; And we worry if our if our car misfires a little bit. I I worry like crazy over stuff like that. Help us, Lord. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, so but it's still shouting and and we're and we're certainly well into the voice uh uh you know of the resurrection that is living inside of a bride. You're you're the final voice and you're you're you're you're a voice of a lived life because you heard a shout and you responded. You heard you recognized and you acted. And that's what you're doing here today. You're acting upon the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's all about a forward progress. So, you know, Jesus talked about, you know, the this hidden mystery that was wrapped up and shrouded in mystery in Luke 17, referring to the ministry of the son of man. And that is an unfolding mystery that Jesus himself declared with his life long before he ever said it. And Luke wrote it in a Bible or Matthew or Mark wrote wrote those events in a Bible. Jesus was only saying what he was already showing that he was an active ministry of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so you know, you remember brother Brandon would say Jesus never claimed to be the son of God. He claimed to be the son of man. &gt;&gt; And so, so this is exactly why when they're taking up stones to stone him and for which of my good works? not for any of your good works, but because you being a man, make yourself God." So now they're they're not they're not just they're not, you know, it's it was not a stonable offense. Adam had been called the son of God. &gt;&gt; Solomon had been called a son of God. That wasn't the problem. But Daniel in Daniel 12 had prophesied that one like unto the son of man will come with the clouds of heaven and he'll come forward and receive an authority and a dominion and his kingdom will never pass away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when that's what they're coming after him. That's why in the book of Mark when the high priest comes down and just says now tell us plainly are you the son of the blessed one? And Jesus said, "I am, and you shall see the clouds of heaven, and you shall see these things." And he tore his garment. He said, "What further need do we have?" So listen, let me tell you something, friends. It's not so much that you say, "I'm a son or daughter of God, but I am the word made flesh in this hour." &gt;&gt; See, and this is what Jesus was revealing. And that ministry was going to carry on into the church. That's what the Holy Ghost was given for. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The Holy Ghost comes to make you the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, how does that work? Do you have a seed, gene? Is that the word? Does that influence your flesh? &gt;&gt; Then you're the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; You're still got to have a body change, but you're you're inside man is already living in heavenly places with Christ Jesus. And you are the unfolding event in modern history made clear by prophecy. &gt;&gt; It's an unfolding mystery that Jesus had declared in his life in in Luke 17 where he speaks about the coming days of Noah and the coming days of Lot and the end of the world. And he goes on there, you know, and and describes some more of it in uh in in Matthew's gospel, Matthew 24. So, you know, people sometimes they say, you know, why would you call it a mystery? Why would you call Jesus a mystery? Well, did the Jews know who he was? Did Israel recognize their king? He rode in on a donkey just like the scripture had said. And they shouted, "Hosana, hosana," which means save us. And they're asking him, "Will you now restore the kingdom?" So, but but he's got a few disciples, but he's got he, you know, he had he had thousands, then he's got 70, then he's got 12, and one of them was a devil. So, I I I would say that yes, he's walking around in human flesh, but he's still quite the mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus prophesied that the mystery of what he was would continue in his church at Pentecost. Now, and he said that he he told them, "Go and tarry until you be endued with power. Then you'll be a witness to me." &gt;&gt; See, so so the ministry of the son of man, it a little while the world won't see me, but you'll see me because when people see you, they'll see me cuz I'll be living in and through you. See? So we're I'm not when I came here today, I was not expecting to look out in these seats and see the nail scarred man. &gt;&gt; What I expected to see was people who believe in the nail scarred man who have accepted the life that was in him is now in them. &gt;&gt; And therefore you are, you understand this is all about god going forward, &gt;&gt; making the next modern event, the next modern event, the next modern event. And the last event is this bride leaving the earth. &gt;&gt; And then he has another event for the 144,000. And then he has another event when we come back in Revelation 19. And then he has another event when we step out on the ashes of the wicked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has another event a thousand years later of a new heavens and a new earth. &gt;&gt; And then he has immeasurable events as the as the hidden mana and his mystery continues to unfold through the ceaseless ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he prophesied to them that this same mystery would continue in his church. And when that occurred, was it still a mystery? Of course. Of course it was. Were Were Were Were Were Were Were Were Were Were Were were W were W were were W were W were were W were W were were W were W were were W were W were were W were W were were W were W were were W were W were were those 120 suddenly recognized as God's mouthpiece to the earth? No. Uh, everybody thought they were drunk. Oh, the people were just full of new wine. And so, so they they weren't recognized as God's mouthpiece to the world, but that's what they were. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; See, so so so these these men who are devout Jews and you know, and and and think, "Oh, you're full of new wine." according to Acts 2:13. So what did they have to have happen to to catch the mystery? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; so Peter Peter when he comes out and and and he's going to preach to them the message of that hour. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now stay with me. He's going to preach to them the message of that hour. And then the Holy Spirit would then have to quicken and give them the understanding of true repentance so they could do it. So they could become it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they could manifest it. So now they the need is they already follow the law of Moses. They're already devout people. &gt;&gt; They're not whoreongers and drunkards. They're devout people already, but they need to take the next step. They need to become the word made flesh. They need to become the ministry of the son of man. &gt;&gt; How are they going to do that? What's going to convince them? Peter has to preach to them the message of the hour. And then the holy spirit has to give them an understanding so that they can have a spirit of true repentance. So what message did he did he preach to them? Uh what was the message of that hour? That Christ is risen. No, that had been being preached for 40 days. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And now 10 days later, &gt;&gt; there's still only 120 people who believe it in the whole world. &gt;&gt; You You follow me? &gt;&gt; See, so that's not what Peter That's not what Peter would preach to them. That had already been being preached. And now 10 days later, you still only got 120 people who are believing uh the the the the message of the hour. The message of the hour is not he just he died at Calvary. The message of the hour, you remember when he said that I go to the father and then we will come to you. This is it. &gt;&gt; What's the message of the hour? That he kept his promise and he's living inside of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't go back and say the lamb of God hung on a cross, but he took them to Joel's prophecy and said, "This is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel." &gt;&gt; This is not Isaiah that you're seeing where he went as a sheep led to the slaughter and they pierced his side and he looked upon them. That has been fulfilled. Now he has walked forward some more and now he's living in us and he wants to live in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. See? All right. Let me have my PowerPoint, Brother Kevin. All right. So, here's what he comes preaching. But on the day, this is the day of Pentecost. So, but but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel. And it shall come to pass in the last days, see the last days, plural, the last 2,000 years, 1,000 years is a day with the Lord. &gt;&gt; See, here's what's happening in the New Testament era. I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice something that I personally had never caught until I was looking at it this morning. You, it might be hard for you to imagine preaching all these years and never caught this. But if you'll notice, I will pour out of my spirit. And we always quote it because when you quote Joel, it's I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh. But when Peter is now a new kind of manifestation, he's not going to just go back and say where what he said there in Joel's prophecy, I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh. Because Peter now knows that that that that that there's a further mystery unfolding that it's not just going to be God living alone or Jesus walking alone. And it's not that God is going to come down and somehow divide himself into multiple persons. &gt;&gt; That's that's how the trinity came. And brother Brandham said he divided himself. But what Peter's making clear is that it's not, you know, he'd said to Job, he'd said to Job, "Have you seen my storooms? Have you seen the hail that I have saved up for the last day? This is not some extraneous thing that God was going to take out of a store room and give it to his people. What was going to happen is he was going to come down himself and I'm not going to give you something uh uh uh that that I own. It's in a store room. I'm going to give you something of me. I'm going to divide part of myself into you. And that's why Peter is now trying to get them to understand this is Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; so he's making it very personal. God is making this very personal. This isn't just some gift. &gt;&gt; This isn't out of one of my storooms. &gt;&gt; This is not some extraneous thing. This is actually I'm going to live inside you. &gt;&gt; Amen. See now, so so then so then we find then that Peter has has has has the promise more Peter says later we have a more sure word of prophecy &gt;&gt; and you do well to believe that and go and and follow that. &gt;&gt; So what does that simply mean? That's that's a a a Greek way of saying we have the prophecy made more certain. &gt;&gt; It is sherer to us because now we have lived it. &gt;&gt; Joel prophesied it. &gt;&gt; But I have a more sure word of prophecy than Joel had. I'm I am that prophecy. It has now come to pass. And and and this is what separates the bride of Christ from just people who believe the promises of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They stay promises until they live behind your skin. And so this is what separates the one who's born again who has the faith of the son of God versus someone who has a limited faith in the son of God. &gt;&gt; The Christian world has a faith in the son of God. But you were promised the faith of the son of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, I I know this is this is a little bit mindbending, but just stay with me. See, &gt;&gt; so, and I want to say I I just want to make this statement that, and I'm to my fellow student linguist, I'm going to have to slaughter the king's English somewhat today. It's the only way we're going to be able to get it. But brother Brandham started it, by the way. Called him the God man. &gt;&gt; Called him man plus, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; See, brand new type of human. He's a prototype for what's the the whole kingdom's going to be. See, so brother Brandham, you know, when he says God divided himself, all that he was, he poured into Christ. And all that Christ was, he poured into the church. So, brother Brandon would use the the the idea of the ocean. And he said, "You take a spoon and you dip it in the ocean." Now, you do not have the ocean, but you have everything, every element of the ocean in your spoon. &gt;&gt; So, he he says, "You have it by measure. He had it. Christ had it without measure." &gt;&gt; So, he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. And yet, he was a human being. I mean, you know, the the the fact that the fact that he could die and be killed and be buried proved he was a man. &gt;&gt; But the fact that he could raise him, that body could raise itself up under its own power &gt;&gt; proved he was more than a man. See, &gt;&gt; so when he when he divides himself into that church, only the paradox that is God could divide himself and rather than becoming something less, he becomes something more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's paradoxical. How does something divide and not be diminished? Right? &gt;&gt; If I break my pen in half and hand it to you, you don't have the whole pen. And now my pen is diminished. It's in two halves. But God actually could divide himself and not be diminished &gt;&gt; at all. And in fact, just the opposite, he can become more. See not a second god, a third god, a fourth god, you know, in in India 33 I think million different gods but he was the same god dividing because he did not pour he did not pour everything in you like he did in Christ &gt;&gt; but everything he poured in you is the element of what he poured in Christ &gt;&gt; only it's now in a many membered body and that's the ministry of the son of man. You are an unfolding mystery and the world thinks it's a cult because it's a mystery &gt;&gt; and the only way you can get your that you you can get your mind around it is a studious reading of the word. But then even after that, just like those men on the day of Pentecost, he couldn't preach Isaiah's message. He had to preach Joel's message. &gt;&gt; And when they heard that, they were pricricked in their hearts. Now he can make a circle and come back around to Jesus. Now, this Jesus whom you crucified. However, I know you did it by determined counsel. You did it through misinterpreted theology. I know you're devout men, but but those sacrifices are no good anymore. Paul would tell him that later in Acts 17. He winked at your ignorance. 1600 years of law. He was never going to keep that. And and all you have to do is think it through. If if if that blood of bulls and goats could perfect you, why' the high priest have to offer it every year? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. But I'm here to tell you, there was a lamb offered on your behalf. And it's good this year, next year, and every year afterward. &gt;&gt; And you don't have to get reborn again every single time you come to church. You just get a refilling. You get a you get some energy. You get some cleaning. &gt;&gt; And you could never not be a part of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So every time he goes forward revealing himself, he becomes greater just as he had said to the church, greater than this shall you do because I go to the father. That's what they said, you know, we want to make you king. You're not going to go. He said, if I don't go, he won't come. &gt;&gt; He's not talking about a different person. He's saying if I stay in this body and you make me a king, I'm just a mortal man who's aging. I can get sick. I age. My body's built out of the cursed earth. But but if you if you leave me, let me go. The cup my father has given me. Shall I not drink it? And if I drink it, don't worry. I'll raise myself back up again. I'll step into sin for you. That's what Adam got trapped. When Adam tried to step into sin to save Eve, he himself got trapped. But I'm thankful that Jesus stepped into death and stepped and went to hell and then stepped back out of it again and pulled all the saints of God with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, so brother Brandon would say, I used to believe that when he would say, "Greater than this shall you do," he said, "I thought it just meant more." Right. &gt;&gt; And the reason he thought that is because it does mean more &gt;&gt; because now Jesus, brother Brandon would say, Jesus Christ has had more success in one of my meetings than he had the than are that are recorded in all the New Testament gospels. Now granted, John said if everything he did, the books couldn't hold and I get all that. But but what is recorded, he said he's had more miracles and greater success in one of my meetings than are recorded. You could take all the incidents that are recorded in the gospel and put them all together. And one of my services would produce more miracles than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Including the dead being raised up at multiple levels and and demons being cast out and the blind eyes opening and the sick and the lame walking and leaping and jumping and cancers dying and and and this thing wasn't done in a corner. &gt;&gt; And he's he's not saying I got glory. He's saying he got more glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; and so what was God doing? God was fulfilling Luke 17:30, Malachi 4, Revelation 18. He's showing the ministry of the son of man again that can know the secrets of the heart. &gt;&gt; So, so every time he goes forward revealing, and brother Brandham said, I always thought it just meant more. He said, "But it occurred to me that when he said in the woods the other day, say where those squirrels will be." And he said, "They were created out of nothing." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now, that's Genesis power. &gt;&gt; Now, you're all the way back in the beginning, God said, "Let there be." And he said, "Say where there'll be." Because brother Brandon wouldn't preach on that scripture. If you say to this mountain, he said, "I could not. I did. I just wouldn't preach on it because I didn't understand how could if I say to the mountain. Now I could get it if he could say it. But how who am I? I'm just a sinful man. And William Brandham knew of his own his own weaknesses just like you and I. We got some, don't we? &gt;&gt; See? &gt;&gt; Jesus was tempted in every way. But he never sinned one time. He always did that which pleased the father. See, &gt;&gt; and so he did that on your behalf. And that's why you get credit for his perfect life and go to heaven. He gets credit for your sinful life and got sent to hell. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Now, who do you love? &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; he died and brother Brandham said God condemned him as a sinner and he'd never committed a sin, but he took your sin and God condemned him as a sinner and sent him to hell. You know why God did that? So I would never have to go there. &gt;&gt; So you would never have to go there. Now he has ascended on high and and brother Brandham said when he stepped out of the eternities to claim the book and open loose the seals and open the book which is the mystery of himself revealed in his church. It's the the the the mystery the book is Christ. We were showing you that last week. Don't think of a leatherbound book. Not denying a record in heaven. I'm just saying that brother Brandham said he broke those seals off of himself. Another place he broke those seals out of himself. So, it's a continuing revelation, a continuing unfolding. And when the seals were opened, it didn't just reveal that he was three. It didn't just reveal that he was just Jesus only. It revealed that he was with his family and that there was a Mr. Jesus and a Mrs. Jesus and she's always been there. And now he calls for his queen &gt;&gt; to stand by his side. &gt;&gt; Friends, that's not just knowledge to puff you up. That's what you'll use to face the devil tomorrow. That's what you'll use when your child has got a fever. That's what you'll use when marriage, your marriage is in trouble. He has called for his queen to stand by his side and take the authority of the word and begin to speak it and create another modern event made clear. &gt;&gt; If your marriage is an event that's bad, create a new one. &gt;&gt; Don't go get another partner. Use the word to fix the one you got and become more than you've ever been in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's power in prayer. There's power in the blood. There's power in the word. &gt;&gt; Satan is deathly afraid you'll believe that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz he knows if you believe it and start exercising it, he's whooped. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said you'll defeat him just like Jesus thwarted his every move in the wilderness &gt;&gt; because you're the final voice to the final age. So, so it's not only more, but it's greater. It's not only greater by doing more, but you know that you know more than this shall you do. It's not just a number, but it's actually things that are greater than even he did. &gt;&gt; See, and that makes perfect sense to me. All right. So, so, so it's it's both more and it's greater, which means that it should take all the wonder out of our minds that he is the how he is the hidden mana that in the ceaseless ages will unfold as an eternal revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother R said, that's the future partaking of the hidden mana. It'll be the eternal unfolding of the mystery of God through the ceaseless ages to come. So it's the everinccreasing of his kingdom that that simply means it's the uncarchable riches of his person. And and as he's dividing himself more and more, he's going to keep dividing himself till the last name on the role is called. And when that has happened, then he's all in all he's got his gentile bride through seven ages ready. the dead in Christ that's been dead for hundreds of years will come out of the grave and stand in your living room one of these mornings &gt;&gt; and then you will feel a little feeling a little pain like and brother Brandon said it's the last pain you'll ever feel in your life and you'll turn around and you'll be young and there's your loved ones gone and then onto the sky. Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; praise God. &gt;&gt; So it's an everinccreasing of his kingdom. See, it's why Paul said in Ephesians that I should preach among the Gentiles the uncarchable riches of Christ to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden God who created all things by Jesus Christ. So what we're saying about Peter on the day of Pentecost is exact this perfectly agrees with Ezekiel. See, and and and and when you come to Ezekiel, a new heart also, Ezekiel 36, a new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh, and I will put my spirit within you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Peter wasn't wrong when he's interpreting Joel's prophecy. This is that that Joel said, "I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh." See? And so Peter just adds a little of there. He's actually pouring out of his spirit. I It's actually making it personal. He's actually dividing himself &gt;&gt; into you, but yet he's not diminished. This agrees perfectly with Isaiah 44 and3. For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground. I will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon thine offspring. I just want to go through the roof and land in the street. He's going to pour not only on me but on my seed and on my offspring. And they've been given to me and they've been given to you and I'm not going to give them back to the devil. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so you know th this this was to me this is what brought me back to Caleb. And I thought I kept thinking about that statement. I had to ask Jason because I was studying and I was listening at the same time. I didn't have time to write it down. So I texted him, Jay, what was that thing you that Paul was showing to the Corinthian church about loving others? You had a definition. He sent it a power. This is loving others. The real love, God's love, &gt;&gt; not filio, not human affection. See, because human affection, you'll tell each other off if you somebody makes you mad. &gt;&gt; You sure will. &gt;&gt; If somebody crosses you up a little bit, you'll you'll get them on the phone and let them have it, then you're fine. And then they're destroyed. &gt;&gt; Could I say today, stop being you and be him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I promise you as you, you will never get past that. &gt;&gt; I promise you as you, you'll constantly fight that and you'll get in your flesh and you'll harm one another. But to love others is a power. And we're not talking about now what you're limited to by your zodiac or by your raising or by your culture or by this or by that. The Holy Ghost is supposed to go all the way past that stuff. &gt;&gt; This what brother Joe was preaching to us Wednesday night. I thought that was one of the most profound sermons I ever heard. I said, "Brother Joe, I can tell you've been a pastor for a year and a half, and your ministry has migrated amazingly. I'm here to tell you something, friends. I want to be like him. I don't want to be like me." &gt;&gt; A power or force to extend yourself for the purpose of spiritual growth. That's for others. You're when love projects, &gt;&gt; grace takes over. Praise God. &gt;&gt; So this is why he said, you know, there are some people they were they truly were of the seedline of Abraham, but they were stiff necked. They were rebellious. They constantly tempted me these 10 times. They never would obey my word. And I'm just simply going to say they will never cross into the promised land. But I happened to notice one among them by the name of Caleb. And he had another kind of spirit. You think Caleb didn't run into the same offenses? They tried to kill the poor brother. They were going to stone him for real &gt;&gt; in front of his family. &gt;&gt; But he kept a different spirit. &gt;&gt; They called him a liar. They called him a deceiver. They took they said, "Let's stone him." Did Caleb say, "Oh, well, let me tell you right now." No, he didn't. He didn't. He didn't. He didn't uh get on the phone. He didn't text him. He didn't Facebook him. He didn't do any of that stuff. &gt;&gt; He somehow he had a different spirit and God was watching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you see it today. God is watching. &gt;&gt; He's watching. And if we're going to be the word made flesh, we're supposed to operate under a different kind of a spirit &gt;&gt; than the world. &gt;&gt; Oh, locked you up. I'm sorry. Let me let me close with this. This meant a lot to me today. This is what you remember me telling you the story years ago and I preached about it. How that David looked out his window one day and he saw the the the house of God was just a tent. Worked fine in the wilderness. No time to build a structure. So they had him in a tent like the one that was in heaven. But now David had a desire. Something started happening in his heart. And he had a desire to build a house unto the Lord God. Now that what what that means is is I I I have a desire that there should be a place somewhere where a sinful man can go into and a holy God will come down to and he won't kill the man. The man won't die because of where he's at and God and man can be reconciled and the man can say, "I'm sorry, Lord. Forgive me of my sin." And God, if you're faithful, he's faithful and just if you confess to forgive. But there was no access for that man. And even if they had it back in that day, you couldn't go back there to the Shikina. Only a high priest once a year could even he could only go back there once. And then he had to have blood or even he would die. See? &gt;&gt; So, so we realize then that David, what so what is David's desire all about? And the prophet says to him, "Do all that's in your heart cuz God is with you." See, the prophet even knew that that desire is godly. That something intrinsic in that prophet go doesn't record God come down and spoke to Nathan and showed him what was up. Nathan just from his spirit agreed with David's spirit and said, "Yeah, that's a great idea. God will bless something like that." You see, what they're what they're experiencing is a desire of God. and and David and Nathan says, "Go ahead and do it." Boy, later that night, God come to Nathan and said,"Now go back to David and tell him, you know, I I took you from among the sheep and I gave you a name like great men and I' I've blessed you and I did all of this. However, David, you you can't be the one to build the the the temple to me." And and you don't really find all the the whole all the reasons in one place. And the book of Kings doesn't show it all. You have to go it over into Ezra's writing of the Chronicles. Samuel doesn't talk about it a whole lot. Not in not in good enough detail to get the picture. Ezra covers it a little better and and says the reason David couldn't do it is because he he was a bloody man and his sword was wet with blood. And David had been a man of fierce judgment and anger. And David killed whole nations and wiped them out and destroyed people by the thousands. See? And so what is what is God saying? David's the father. David's in the fatherhood. God is saying, "David, you're that's my desire. I want to have a place, but I've been a god of judgment and a god of wrath and people who who wouldn't obey my word. I've slaughtered them. I hope opened up the earth and swallowed their them and their family and their cattle and their don donkeys and camels and I swallowed everything and and and I've and I've wiped out other nations. And so I even even I told Moses, I cannot go in the midst of these people. I'll slay them if I do. They're stiff necked. They're unbelievers. and I'll kill everybody, but I'll send forth my angel. See, it's the same God now in a form of atonement that he can go. I'll send forth my angel and he'll go among them. See, so God is simply saying through David, you're the father. I'm the father. You've been bloody. I've been bloody. You've been a killer. I've been a killer. You're about judgment. I'm about judgment. You want what I want. I want a place, too. You want a place to where me and you can come together. I want a place where I got cut off in the Garden of Eden. And I've always wanted to have another place. And starting with Abel, I've been building my way to it. Someday the lamb will hang on Calvary. You see, David, you can't do it. But I'll raise up your son and the son of David. And I'll call his name Solomon. I'll call his name peace. And in and in that son, I'll have reconciliation between God and man. &gt;&gt; See? So, so Christ can be that. He is the tabernacle in the wilderness. He is the temple Solomon built. He is the the the the meeting place where God and man can come together in fellowship. &gt;&gt; So, we're talking about the spirit of God and David after his dreadful sin with Bath Sheba. This is my last thing. You good? &gt;&gt; Amen. after his failure with Ba Sheba. God sends Nathan the prophet back says, "Well, here's some decisions, David. The child is going to die. You'll get to see him again because he'll be in heaven. He won't come back to you, but you will eventually get to go to him." As for you and Ba Sheba, there really is no provision in the word to save you &gt;&gt; because what you did was intentional and there's no sacrifice for that. You can't bring any There's no prescribed sacrifice for intentional transgressions. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; See, so there was no He couldn't go and offer a lamb. He couldn't offer bulock. He couldn't offer turtle dove. He couldn't do any of that. It wouldn't have atoned for it. There was only one paradoxical being who could make a who could make an executive decision and says, "But you will not die. She will not die. The offspring, the fruit of this will die, but then you'll get it back. But you'll not die because I am God and I have taken your sin and put it away from me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because I'm God, I can do that. And someday when when your son and my son, the son of David, the son of God, the son of man, hangs on Calvary, then all the you'll be in paradise until that happens, David. But when that happens, don't worry. I'll come knocking and Abraham will recognize me and Ezekiel recognize me and you'll recognize me and I'll empty you all out and we'll all go home and be done with all this nonsense. Oh, I'm so ready to be done with all this nonsense. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So after that terrible, terrible transgression, David comes to the 51st Psalm. And here he is as a king on his knees. Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit in me. Now just think about what's just happened. God just told him he's not going to die. Now he's coming back to God on his knees. Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence. You love that. And take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation. Not my salvation, thy salvation. Yours is way better than mine. &gt;&gt; Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation. And I love this. And uphold me with thy free spirit. Why? Because you, like David, sometimes there's many times I can't uphold me. And I just have to say, Lord, uh, you uphold me. I can't uphold me. See? So, so, so what what what are you seeing? Just like when he wanted to build the tabern the temple, you're seeing a deep calling to a deep. There's something down inside of David. Brother Brandham said, "Like the noise of thy water spouts, the deep as the eagle flutterth over her young." And there's a deep calls to the deep. And he's saying to me, he's saying to God, "Create in me a clean heart. Take my heart which is deceitful above all things and and create me a new one. Lord, that's my desire. That's your desire. I say, Lord, my heart is deceitful. Create in me a clean heart. &gt;&gt; Oh my. One with a different nature. One that will always believe the word. One that will always say amen to every word. And I'm not talking intellectually. I'm talking about Lord, I want you to create a heart in me that my life will go amen. Amen. Amen. My eyes will say amen. My ears will say amen. My feet will say amen. My whole life will be a living amen. That God can be proud of. How many want to pray that today? Lord created me. That kind of a heart today. And and and and cast me not away uh from thy presence. If I stumble, give me a heart that renews itself. Give me a right spirit again and again and again. You want to say that to the Lord? Create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit. Something that comes back and says, "I'm sorry, and I love you, and I want to serve you, and it'll do it today, and it'll do it tomorrow, and it'll do it next week. Oh, hallelujah. Cast me not away from thy presence. I want a presence living in me that once I have it, I can never be cast away. No one can ever take it from me. I can never lose it. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. And restore unto me the joy of thy salvation. One that when I stumble or make a mistake, not if, when, say, when. One that when I stumble or make a mistake, it will take me back to my knees again and again and again and still again. There's a deep inside presence of God that is calling continually, continually restoring the joy of his salvation to me. And this is the desire. This is the real desire that you can have today that David couldn't quite get to where you can be free from the law of sin. &gt;&gt; Where the law of sin and death where the curse of sin and death have no more jurisdiction over my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Create in me a clean heart. &gt;&gt; Oh God, come stand. Come musicians, stand to your feet. Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; within me. Cast me not away from thy presence. Take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me by thy free spirit. The spirit uphold me by the spirit that sets me free. Is that your desire today? I want you to bow your heads with me over the audience. I'm done preaching. We're going to let you go. But I I'd be daring to come come to a conclusion like that and not give you an opportunity today to say, "Lord, create in me a clean heart." Look at that. Hands everywhere. My renew a right spirit in me, Lord. This contaminating world has contaminated my spirit. Create in me a clean heart. Renew a right spirit in me. Cast me not away. Don't take your presence from me. Give me something that I once I have it, I can never ever lose it. No one can ever take it from me and uphold me by thy free spirit. Friends, while your heads are bowed now, if you and maybe your journey to become the unfolding mystery of God to the world and somehow you realize you got off the trail somewhere, you were supposed to be on a journey. You were supposed to be going forward. You were supposed to be ascending. And somehow you just feel like you've lagged behind and you want to say, "Lord, maybe I'm like those at the end of that line. I know I'm in an order of a descending. I know I'm not descending. I know I'm not part of the darkness. I know I'm getting closer to home, but I know I need to get back in line." Raise up that hand. Oh, there goes some honest hearts. My goodness. I'm gonna raise up both of mine. Lord Jesus, today I want to be part of that unfolding mystery. &gt;&gt; I want to be part of that ministry of the son of man that walks forward where everything in my life, everything I say and do, everything I think and believe will lead me to fulfilling your word. There's no value in me, Lord. I'm for sure I'm for sure going to fall. I'm for sure going to stumble. But I'm also for sure like my kinfolk, King David. And I want to say, create in me a clean heart today, Lord. Renew a right spirit in me, oh God. Let me get over myself. Let me get more like you. There's no value in being me. I want to be like you in everything I do, think, and say, in every way I respond. Lord, that sermon that your servant preached to us Wednesday night and then followed on closely by the Sunday school class today from our brother Jason. What a lesson putting those two sermons together. What a lesson, Lord. Oh, I want to be like you, oh God. I want to be like you, Lord Jesus. I I I'm like David. There's something inside me that's a deep is calling to a deep. The deep is higher than me and I want to be higher. Oh, may you grant it to us today. Lord, create in me a clean heart, Brother Kenny. Amen. Let's sing it. We know this song. It's a Bible song. Create in me a clean heart. Oh God. Oh God. [Music] Oh, and renew a right spirit within me. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Create in me.
