[26:40] One lonely vessel
[26:45] so close to home.
[26:51] One frantic captain
[26:56] barely keeping control.
[27:01] The lighthouse on the hill
[27:07] could have ended his plight.
[27:12] But its dim beacons glow
[27:18] hardly cut through the night.
[27:23] Though he strained, he could not see
[27:29] for the lack of some light.
[27:34] He heard the crack of the hole. The ship
[27:37] soon was full was the captain's last
[27:42] night.
[27:45] And all to the thanks
[27:50] of a lazy light keeper.
[27:56] The fire did burn,
[28:01] but it was only within.
[28:07] It did not reach out
[28:12] to the ones that were needy.

[28:50] Will my beacon shine
[28:53] [Music]
[28:55] through this darkened world of sin?

[29:05] [Music]
[29:06] soon see his end?
[29:11] Oh, I don't want to be
[29:17] a lazy light keeper.
[29:20] [Music]
[29:22] My fire does burn,
[29:27] but is it only within?
[29:33] Will it reach out
[29:38] to the ones that are needy?
[29:43] Oh, can it reach out?
[29:48] Or is there sod on my lens?
[29:54] Can it reach out
[29:59] or is there s on my
[30:03] limb?

[36:48] deacon. Um, you know, and I get that and
[36:51] and I've talked to some of the teenagers
[36:53] say, "Well, I'm taking notes." And I get
[36:55] that. I take notes on an iPad. Uh, not
[36:58] typing. That's why I use this so that it
[36:59] doesn't look like I'm just typing. But,
[37:02] um, don't be doing that casually or
[37:04] recreationally or socially. Don't do
[37:06] that. Uh that be that'd probably be
[37:08] worse than chewing gum in the presence
[37:10] of the Holy Spirit. Do you know why the
[37:12] the brother Brandham said that we don't
[37:14] chew gum in church is because it offends
[37:17] the Holy Ghost?
[37:20] Because it looks to him like you're just
[37:21] a a snickler fritz as brother Brandon
[37:24] would say, just a sassy old teenager or
[37:26] adult. You know that you're unconcerned
[37:29] or you're you're taking the presence of
[37:31] the Lord casually and you're just
[37:33] sitting there chewing gum. And brother
[37:35] Bram said, 'D don't do that because that
[37:36] offends him. Otherwise, you know, you
[37:39] wouldn't you would never know that if it
[37:40] hadn't been for a prophet. That's not in
[37:42] you can't hardly find that. There's
[37:44] things in the Bible that you didn't do
[37:46] in the presence of a king or you get
[37:47] killed. So that's that is scriptural,
[37:50] but uh I don't know if they had chewing
[37:52] gum back in the days of the Bible, but
[37:54] I'm glad we had a prophet who spent a
[37:56] lot of time around the angel of the Lord
[37:59] and said, "Don't do that because it
[38:01] offends him." So, I would just imagine
[38:03] that in our 21st century, I know we are
[38:06] a connected age and I get that and and I
[38:09] understand
[38:11] that there's some proper usage of it.
[38:13] Sometimes you'll see officers or
[38:14] different ones um using that or maybe
[38:17] someone taking notes with their device.
[38:19] But, you know, you'll just be on the
[38:21] honor system. I'm not going to chase you
[38:23] down or send the deacon to tap you and
[38:24] go, "Hey, what are you doing?" So, but
[38:27] just remember there's an allseeing eye.
[38:29] Amen. Now, smile. Smile. Breathe.
[38:34] You'll be okay. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[38:37] Lord.
[38:39] Um, I want to also give this prayer
[38:42] request that Sister Sharon sent in for
[38:45] Miss Sylvia, who she now cares for, that
[38:48] the Lord would banish the evil anxiety
[38:50] that torments her. You know, the Bible
[38:53] calls demons tormentors.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That torments her even though she
[38:58] rebukes that anxiety. Well, she's doing
[39:00] a good thing. That's good. She also has
[39:03] a really bad arthritic arthritic
[39:05] arthritic pain that limits her mobility
[39:08] that she would like to be healed of.
[39:10] Well, praise the Lord. We'd like to see
[39:12] her healed of that. Amen. That's what
[39:13] the family of God's for. It's what
[39:15] prayer is for. Amen. So, I'm going to
[39:19] read just a a short a couple of verses.
[39:21] I'm gonna let you be seated.
[39:23] uh Joel 2 and we're going to look here
[39:26] at what Peter quoted on the day of
[39:28] Pentecost. When they asked him what's
[39:30] going on, they thought it was a bunch of
[39:32] drunk people. They they weren't
[39:35] completely wrong, but it wasn't drunk
[39:37] like they thought. Peter said, "And and
[39:39] it shall come to pass afterward that I
[39:43] will pour out my spirit upon all flesh."
[39:45] This is what Peter was quoting. "And
[39:47] your sons and your daughters shall
[39:48] prophesy. Your old men shall dream
[39:50] dreams. Your young men shall see
[39:53] visions, and also upon the servants, and
[39:56] upon the handmmaids. In those days will
[39:58] I pour out my spirit, and I will show
[40:01] wonders in the heavens, and in the
[40:03] earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of
[40:06] smoke. The sun shall be turned into
[40:08] darkness, and the moon into blood before
[40:11] the great and the terrible day of the
[40:14] Lord come. And it shall come to pass
[40:17] that whosoever shall call on the name of
[40:20] the Lord shall be delivered.
[40:24] Stop.
[40:26] You know why I said stop? Because that's
[40:28] where Peter stopped. Because the second
[40:30] part of the verse is forward. For in
[40:33] Mount Zion, now you're in Revelation
[40:35] 14:15. You have Mount Zion, you have
[40:38] Jerusalem, and you have the remnant. And
[40:40] you can see that at the end time, at the
[40:43] end of the tribulation, you have the
[40:45] remnant of the woman's seed. You have
[40:47] Zion, which is the bride. You have
[40:49] Jerusalem, which is God's 144,000.
[40:53] See, and you've got them all, but but
[40:55] this is for the end times. So Peter is
[40:58] stopping right there to say what you're
[41:00] seeing right now, that's coming, but
[41:02] what you're seeing right now, I need to
[41:04] stop right here and not go to that. See?
[41:07] All right, let's pray. Father, we thank
[41:10] you for your word today and we're asking
[41:14] for your great blessing upon it. Lord,
[41:17] we trust you now to bring forth the
[41:20] words of life to us that we are in such
[41:22] need of. And Lord, it's such a shaking
[41:25] hour in such a dark world, such a
[41:27] poisonous time. We scarcely can miss a
[41:30] moment to receive from you. And I I pray
[41:33] for uh for those who aren't able to be
[41:36] here today, for those who chose not to
[41:38] be here today, Lord, that you would help
[41:40] them anyway, Lord God, go forward in a
[41:44] mighty way, Lord, and and and help
[41:46] those, especially those who would like
[41:48] to have been here and for reasons
[41:50] couldn't be. Uh but Lord, we know that
[41:53] the devil uh draws many aside and we've
[41:56] been preaching along those lines and
[41:58] he's just always busy, Lord. So, we pray
[42:00] against him. We preach against him. We
[42:02] take a stand for your word today. Now,
[42:05] I'm asking for this uh sincere request
[42:08] from Sister Sharon concerning the
[42:10] elderly lady she lives in with now.
[42:12] Lord, that you'd be merciful to her.
[42:14] She's trying to rebuke that anxiety.
[42:17] Would you help her, Lord? Would you
[42:18] quicken her faith? The right mental
[42:20] attitude toward a promise will bring it
[42:22] to pass. Would you give her that perfect
[42:24] faith, Lord, to believe it as she says
[42:26] it? Father, may it come to pass that she
[42:28] would be healed, that you would touch
[42:30] her in this arthritis. Lord, she has a
[42:33] desire to be healed and you have a
[42:34] desire to heal. So, we bring these two
[42:37] things together, Lord, and ask for your
[42:40] mercy in Jesus' name. Amen. God bless
[42:43] you, friends. You can be seated.
[43:13] Amen.
[43:14] My daughter-in-law put that there in
[43:17] case the um song leaders I forgot to
[43:20] bring me some, but there's there wasn't
[43:22] any back there I noticed. So, I just uh
[43:23] decided to break out the spare today.
[43:25] Praise the Lord. Is that all right? Now,
[43:27] this mean I can I've got all this this
[43:30] is time. This equals time.
[43:33] Amen. I don't need an alarm. I I have I
[43:35] have a clock. All right. Amen. Praise
[43:37] the Lord. So, don't don't be saying,
[43:39] "Please drink that last bit."
[43:43] Amen.
[43:44] I want to look today in our 11th
[43:46] installment of the of the u future
[43:50] events coming to pass becoming and uh
[43:53] future events in prophecy that we are
[43:55] becoming those future events. We've
[43:57] taught on that quite extensively and I'm
[44:00] going to really um invite you just to
[44:02] stay with me very close. Zoe honey just
[44:05] uh be ready. Let's put that um verse 27
[44:09] back up again, sweetheart. um verse 27
[44:13] of where we were in Joel and then I'll
[44:15] be ready to go to Isaiah 59. Sorry to
[44:18] switch that up on you. And so I want you
[44:21] just to give me your undivided attention
[44:23] for a little bit and I I'll I know I'm
[44:26] going to go for sure to a certain part
[44:28] and if I have time I would like to carry
[44:30] on and we'll just see. We'll see what
[44:32] the Lord if that if I'm not able to do
[44:34] it then I'm determined to do it this
[44:36] Wednesday. Amen. We'll be out of town
[44:39] next weekend. Uh, brother Matt and I are
[44:42] ministering meetings there. Labor Day
[44:44] meetings in Texas with Brother David
[44:46] McGary. So, you be keeping us in prayer,
[44:48] please. And we looked at verse 27. And
[44:52] ye shall uh or excuse me, wait a minute.
[44:55] I'm sorry. Uh,
[44:58] yeah, we we didn't read 27. That's what
[45:00] we're going to read. Actually, Zoe,
[45:02] let's go to 23, sweetheart. Uh, verse
[45:05] 23. Amen. For those of you all online,
[45:08] that's my granddaughter. Sorry. Amen.
[45:11] Amen. Praise the Lord. I have to be
[45:13] careful. Amen. Might have to make you
[45:16] come up here and stand beside me, Z, and
[45:18] introduce you. Now, I want you to look.
[45:21] Now, the reason I wanted to start at
[45:24] verse 23 is because so often we just
[45:28] jump right to Peter's where Peter went
[45:31] in verse 28. and he went down through 28
[45:35] and he went down through 29 and 30 and
[45:37] 31 and he went into 32 and paused.
[45:41] But I want to look then at verse 23
[45:44] because I want you to see this prophecy
[45:48] as a whole prophecy that is spread over
[45:52] more than just what was happening in
[45:55] Jerusalem at Pentecost.
[45:58] You got me? So Joel Joel 2 is more in
[46:03] fact is it's far more
[46:07] by by far it's more than just what
[46:11] happened. It includes what happened when
[46:14] the Jubilee came in the upper room. The
[46:17] long awaited Jubilee that they had
[46:18] waited for a long time and that came in
[46:22] the upper room. But now I want you to
[46:24] look at the prophecy from a higher
[46:26] altitude. Verse 23.
[46:29] Be glad then you children of Zion. Zion
[46:33] is always the bride. Brother Brandham
[46:34] has taught us. And rejoice in the Lord
[46:37] your God. For he hath given you the
[46:40] former rain moderately. And he will
[46:43] cause to come down for you the rain, the
[46:46] former rain and the latter rain in the
[46:49] first month. And the floors. Look at
[46:52] look at the result. when the former and
[46:55] latter reign fall together in the same
[46:58] month because this is a prophecy of the
[47:02] end time. Brother Brandham makes that
[47:04] very clear in his message, the former
[47:07] and latter reign. And then he he he he
[47:10] thinks at that time and I think 60 that
[47:13] that even his healing revival and
[47:16] campaign, you know, the commission that
[47:18] the angel gave him that that's the
[47:19] latter reign. Brother Brandon would
[47:22] later um um focus that to understand,
[47:27] excuse me, that the latter reign would
[47:30] be when the opening of the word and the
[47:32] seals were open and the mysteries were
[47:34] revealed and what had been in the alpha
[47:37] was now to be repeated in the omega. So
[47:41] you're you're and you're reading it
[47:43] upside down because you're reading about
[47:46] what's happening at the end time. And
[47:49] then Peter comes out and backs up and
[47:52] now you're back at the beginning of the
[47:54] church and he says, "Oh, this is Joel's
[47:56] prophecy."
[47:58] But but like all prophecy, you can't
[48:00] read it always linearly like you'd read
[48:03] a newspaper. When you go in the book of
[48:04] Revelation, you'll find that a prophecy
[48:07] comes here and then three or four
[48:09] chapters later, another thing will be
[48:11] happening here, but in time it happened
[48:13] way over here prior. And so it's it's
[48:16] not chronologically set like that. And
[48:19] here's a perfect example. You're going
[48:21] to have former reign. You're going to
[48:23] have latter reign. But at the end time,
[48:26] it would be the former and latter reign
[48:28] reigning together. And it would be a
[48:30] message to the bride.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[48:34] All right. So don't think linearly. All
[48:36] right?
[48:38] So So and the here's the result. Here's
[48:41] what will happen. Let me just say it
[48:42] like this. Here's what will happen in
[48:46] the at the end time when the former and
[48:49] latter rain fall in the same month, and
[48:52] the floors shall be full of wheat, and
[48:55] the fats shall overflow with wine and
[48:57] oil. And I will restore to you the
[49:02] years, this is all the years that the
[49:05] locust hath eaten. See, now you're going
[49:08] to see something go through seven church
[49:11] ages. and and and and those first four
[49:14] ages, it's going to go all the way into
[49:16] a dark age, a thousand-year dark age.
[49:18] And in the last three, the last three
[49:21] ages are going to cradle a restoration.
[49:24] All right. Now, watch.
[49:27] all the years that the locust hath
[49:28] eaten, the cankerworm, and the
[49:30] caterpillar, and the palmer worm, my
[49:32] great army, which I which I sent among
[49:35] you, and ye shall eat in plenty, and be
[49:38] satisfied, and praise the name of the
[49:41] Lord your God, that hath dealt
[49:43] wondrously with you, and my people shall
[49:46] never be ashamed." So, you you say,
[49:49] "Well, wait a minute. You know, I I
[49:51] thought that the, you know, when he's
[49:53] talking about he's going to restore uh
[49:55] from this great army, he's going to
[49:56] restore the locust and, you know, and
[49:58] the cankerworm, the caterpillar, and all
[50:00] this, but we've already had, you know,
[50:03] that under Luther's day. Well, you had
[50:07] in Luther's day a seal partially open.
[50:13] Partially, just cracked open. And
[50:15] brother Brandham used the term it
[50:17] partially opened and a mystery dropped
[50:20] down and a messenger which was Luther
[50:22] caught it and ran with it. But what
[50:25] Luther understood about justification is
[50:28] not you're not limited to his limited
[50:32] understanding.
[50:33] Luther understood the just shall live by
[50:36] his faith. But at the end time when the
[50:39] former and latter reign come together in
[50:41] the same month and the seven seals are
[50:43] open, you find out something Luther
[50:45] never touched on is that is that you are
[50:49] now justified as though you never did it
[50:53] in the first place.
[50:57] So whether it was Luther's ministry,
[51:00] Wesley's ministry, the Isuza revivalist
[51:03] fathers, whether it was that ministry
[51:05] which was a product of the open door
[51:08] that the Isuza revival was not a product
[51:10] of the seventh seal opening, wasn't open
[51:12] at that time. The the Isuza revival,
[51:15] which we call Pentecost, that because
[51:18] they called themselves that. somewhat of
[51:19] a misnomer because Pentecost was an
[51:22] experience, not a denomination. And in
[51:24] fact is they didn't even have the fully
[51:26] restored word. However, brother Brandham
[51:29] used that term. I'll use that term out
[51:31] of courtesy. But we realize brother
[51:33] Brandon would turn around and say, "Now,
[51:35] you cannot mix Pentecost with this
[51:38] message." And people somehow have
[51:41] mistakenly thought that he's saying, "I
[51:44] can't mix what happened in the upper
[51:45] room with the opening of the seals.
[51:49] The opening of the seals was the
[51:51] complete token restoration abstract
[51:54] title deed restoration of what fell in
[51:56] the upper room.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; So what what you can't mix with the
[52:00] message is the remnants of the Isuza
[52:04] revival and what that became.
[52:07] It became denominationalism
[52:10] and man-made theory and it became just a
[52:12] circus to today.
[52:18] So, so we we've got to keep all of this
[52:20] straight. So, now I want to say this to
[52:23] you at the time when the former and
[52:28] latter rain are falling together in the
[52:31] in the same month at the end time.
[52:35] I know the world is dark and I know the
[52:38] world is sad, but we overflow with wine
[52:41] and oil. I know that the world is in
[52:44] fear. I know that the world is in
[52:46] trouble, but I'm here to tell you
[52:48] something. We shall uh our floor shall
[52:51] be full of wheat.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; See, and so and he and he would go on to
[52:56] say, watch this now. And ye shall eat in
[53:00] plenty.
[53:02] You're How do you How do you reconcile
[53:07] that there's a people who will eat in
[53:10] plenty, whose floors will be full, whose
[53:14] whose vats are overflowing with oil and
[53:16] wine, and their floors are full of
[53:18] wheat, and they're eating in plenty. And
[53:20] and and verse 26, and be satisfied and
[53:25] praise. And that's all going to happen
[53:28] in the day when the when another
[53:30] prophecy says it'll be a famine for
[53:34] hearing the word of God. I'm here to
[53:36] tell you something, friends. You have
[53:37] been called into a mystery that the
[53:39] world can't see, touch, or experience.
[53:42] And you are so privileged today
[53:45] because while the world is in a famine
[53:47] for not a famine of the word, a famine
[53:50] for hearing the word.
[53:53] See, blessed are your eyes, for they
[53:57] see.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Your ears that they hear. Many have
[54:01] desired to see and hear, the Bible says,
[54:03] and it's not, it wasn't even granted to
[54:05] them. Even angels have looked through
[54:09] the ages looked steadily on at this day,
[54:13] and they looked at the mysteries, and
[54:15] they knew what was coming to to to a
[54:17] degree in the future. And they looked in
[54:19] there and even prophets of old, the
[54:21] Bible says they looked in there
[54:23] earnestly trying to understand what does
[54:25] all this mean? And the Bible Paul said,
[54:28] but it wasn't granted to them what it
[54:30] what they were told was it wouldn't
[54:32] actually be in their day, but it would
[54:34] be in the end time. And that's this time
[54:35] and that's your day.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; And you are feasting on that which great
[54:41] prophets and sages and even angels have
[54:44] desired to look into.
[54:46] Dare we take it lightly?
[54:49] Dare we take it casually?
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Dare we not follow its precepts?
[54:56] &gt;&gt; It's the greatest event. It's the event.
[54:58] It's the finishing move. It's everything
[55:00] God has built for 6,000 years to get to
[55:03] this time.
[55:06] Oh my.
[55:08] And you shall eat in plenty. Verse 26.
[55:10] and you'll and and you'll be satisfied
[55:12] and you'll praise the name of the Lord
[55:14] your God that hath dealt wondrously with
[55:16] you and my people shall never be
[55:19] ashamed. Now look at this verse 27.
[55:23] And ye shall know
[55:26] that I am in the midst of Israel
[55:31] and that I secondly and that I am the
[55:34] Lord your God and none else and my
[55:38] people shall never be ashamed. See, so
[55:42] now he's coming and he comes on down. We
[55:45] read verse 28, 29, 30, 31. We went into
[55:49] 32. And it shall come to pass that
[55:51] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[55:53] Lord shall be delivered. For in Mount
[55:56] Zion and in Jerusalem shall be
[55:57] deliverance, as the Lord hath said in
[56:01] the a and in the remnant whom the Lord
[56:03] shall call. I want you to know
[56:05] something, friends. You just read the
[56:08] end of the matter. I don't care what's
[56:11] happening in your life. That's the end
[56:12] of it. I don't care what the devil has
[56:14] done to you, how much he's broke your
[56:16] heart. I don't care how much you feel
[56:17] how much you feel like you've lost. I
[56:18] like you've lost. I don't care how beat
[56:19] don't care how beat down you feel. I
[56:20] down you feel. I read the last line and
[56:21] read the last line and Zion is going to
[56:23] Zion is going to rejoice
[56:24] rejoice
[56:27] &gt;&gt; and it's already set and has to come to
[56:27] &gt;&gt; and it's already set and has to come to
[56:29] pass.
[56:29] pass.
[56:34] Now, you just give me some
[56:34] Now, you just give me some
[56:37] pastoral privilege here for a moment.
[56:37] pastoral privilege here for a moment.
[56:41] I got to I'm responsible to those the
[56:41] I got to I'm responsible to those the
[56:44] Lord has committed to me. I don't care
[56:44] Lord has committed to me.
[56:47] There are some
[56:50] some ministry and some people who sit
[56:53] under ministry
[56:55] who squirm
[56:57] and you can see they get very
[56:59] uncomfortable at the idea of the dynamic
[57:04] experience
[57:06] of the upper room whenever it's brought
[57:08] up.
[57:10] But I would just say to my fellow
[57:13] brethren and saints of God, that is a
[57:16] deeply misplaced fear.
[57:19] You know, Peter say, "Well, why why is
[57:23] it why why can you be so settled?"
[57:25] Because Peter settled the question by
[57:28] tying the upper room experience to
[57:31] Joel's prophecy.
[57:33] You understand? So now so so but but but
[57:37] but but when we take a look at the
[57:40] entire prophecy from 20:es 23-32
[57:44] then you look at when these events are
[57:48] mainly to be had.
[57:50] What what events? When the floors are
[57:53] full of wheat and the vats are
[57:55] overflowing. Amen. And the people are
[57:58] eating and being satisfied. And they're
[58:00] praising God. And his presence is in the
[58:03] midst. And your sons and daughters shall
[58:06] prophesy. And your young men see
[58:08] visions. And your old men dream dreams.
[58:10] And I'll do this. And I'll have signs
[58:12] and this sign and that sign and that
[58:13] sign. And people are afraid of that.
[58:15] They get all nervous about, oh, we're
[58:16] trying to take us back to some emotional
[58:18] state. There's nothing about that that's
[58:20] emotional. It's supernatural. It's a
[58:23] prophecy and it's supposed to be
[58:25] happening and we're supposed to be
[58:27] rejoicing in it.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Not afraid of it.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; I wonder sometimes if they actually read
[58:38] their Bible or they just take snippets
[58:39] of it.
[58:44] So when you look at these events
[58:48] in the very unique day when the former
[58:53] and latter rain were to fall together,
[58:56] it's at the end time. Y
[59:00] &gt;&gt; and all of those prophecies about the
[59:04] wheat being floors being full, the vats
[59:06] overflowing, the presence of God among
[59:08] them, that all is is what happens. And
[59:13] that's that's in the prophecy prior to
[59:16] what Peter quotes. Peter's just simply
[59:19] saying this is that this is the
[59:21] beginning of Joel's prophecy. Now, they
[59:24] don't have an idea about ages going, but
[59:26] God knew about it. And you were in his
[59:28] mind, and your names were in a book. And
[59:31] there was always going to be seven stars
[59:33] in his right hand. And there was always
[59:34] going to be seven spirits. And there was
[59:36] always going to be a people at the end
[59:38] time who would be alive and remain when
[59:41] his presence came among us.
[59:48] So I would say it's even more so
[59:51] than at the upper room on the day of
[59:55] Pentecost. Can I say it like that?
[59:59] We should be looking for more than more
[1:00:03] more even greater than what they had.
[1:00:05] And brother Brandham identified that we
[1:00:08] actually had the power of Genesis back
[1:00:10] which you don't find in the book of
[1:00:12] Acts.
[1:00:13] You find it in Genesis when God said,
[1:00:15] "Let there be." And a prophet said, "Let
[1:00:17] there be." And that had not been said.
[1:00:20] See? So, we've been showing you that
[1:00:23] there's nothing that we teach that is
[1:00:26] that is contrary to what Paul taught.
[1:00:31] You understand? And we don't dare
[1:00:33] suggest that we have a greater
[1:00:35] revelation than Paul. I don't even
[1:00:36] suggest William and Brandham had a
[1:00:37] greater revelation than Paul. I simply
[1:00:39] am saying that we have events in this
[1:00:42] day that fit the prophecy that it wasn't
[1:00:44] time for those events. They did not have
[1:00:47] that prophecy fulfilled or Peter would
[1:00:49] have identified it.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; But he didn't he didn't start back at
[1:00:54] verse 23 and come forward and he didn't
[1:00:57] even go all the way through the end of
[1:00:59] 32 because that's the judgment after the
[1:01:02] judgment. Is this making sense? Yeah.
[1:01:09] So, it's even more so. I would say we
[1:01:13] have a more unique day than they had in
[1:01:16] the upper room on the day of Pentecost
[1:01:18] because we have we have all these other
[1:01:20] things. Now, Jesus said, "When you see
[1:01:23] this," and brother Brandham pointed us
[1:01:26] to his exact language. He said, "When
[1:01:29] you see this and all these other
[1:01:33] things."
[1:01:34] So
[1:01:36] they had the day when one stone would
[1:01:39] not be left upon another, but they
[1:01:42] didn't they and they and they had the
[1:01:45] beginning of the Antichrist spirit. But
[1:01:48] but to say that they had the full
[1:01:51] complete problem that we face today
[1:01:54] where there's many false Christs
[1:01:58] and many false prophets and deceiving
[1:02:01] many that that that's a that's a unique
[1:02:05] hour that you and I face today. But I'm
[1:02:07] here I'm glad to tell you that I'm not
[1:02:09] pulling away from Joel's prophecy. I'm
[1:02:12] running toward it because that's the
[1:02:13] hour that identifies the presence of the
[1:02:15] Lord among us.
[1:02:20] And he says,
[1:02:22] "So, so, so I just I just want to keep
[1:02:24] going slow. So, because we have all
[1:02:27] these other things now, now we have
[1:02:30] we've had the wars and rumors of wars."
[1:02:32] He said, "You'd hear of, we've had the
[1:02:34] the the woes and the vials and trumpets
[1:02:38] and seals cracking open partially all
[1:02:41] through the ages."
[1:02:42] vials, trumpets, seals, all cracking
[1:02:44] open partially during the ages.
[1:02:48] And and as as it relates to the trumpets
[1:02:50] and seals, that's the ministry, I'm
[1:02:53] sorry, the trumpets and vials, that's
[1:02:54] the ministry of Moses and Elijah when
[1:02:56] it's in its fullness. You understand?
[1:02:58] That's that's the me the message they
[1:02:59] take to the Jews. Listen, friends,
[1:03:03] and I'm ahead of myself. I just want to
[1:03:06] say it like this.
[1:03:09] that
[1:03:10] we have had
[1:03:12] 60 plus years to grow out of babyhood.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; So they, you know, everybody wants to
[1:03:20] who who's afraid of of these areas of of
[1:03:23] what happened that dynamic experience.
[1:03:26] Oh my goodness, get nervous. Tighten up.
[1:03:29] What are you going to What are you
[1:03:30] You're about to go emotional on me.
[1:03:31] You're you're chasing sensations. You
[1:03:34] know, Brother Brandham said you can't
[1:03:35] you can't show these things to
[1:03:37] Pentecostal babies. Excuse me. We're not
[1:03:40] Pentecostal babies.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; We have been six decades, longer than
[1:03:45] six decades with the opening of the
[1:03:46] word. We're not Pentecostal babies. What
[1:03:50] are you afraid of?
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, friends. God,
[1:03:55] you say, "Well, why couldn't we go in
[1:03:57] the in the rapture?" You know, when the
[1:03:59] seals first broke, we all wanted, they
[1:04:01] all wanted to. My mom and dad wanted to.
[1:04:04] All All the grown people wanted to.
[1:04:05] Brother Brandham wanted to. But God had
[1:04:08] but the bride was just an infant bride
[1:04:10] at that time and she had to grow and she
[1:04:13] had to mature. And I understand we had
[1:04:15] this camp and that camp and this camp
[1:04:17] and that camp. That's what teenage girls
[1:04:19] do.
[1:04:22] They get stinky and they get they get
[1:04:24] they get, you know, territorial and
[1:04:27] drives drives junior high boys crazy.
[1:04:30] What What are these girls? What's wrong
[1:04:31] with them? and and and and and I feel
[1:04:34] sorry for the girl because she's going
[1:04:36] through those hormonal changes and if
[1:04:39] she doesn't have really good parents and
[1:04:40] a really good strong presence of God in
[1:04:42] her life, she'll become what brother
[1:04:44] Brandham called a snickler fritz.
[1:04:47] Now, I'm using teenage girls. Teenage
[1:04:49] boys lose their mind as well, but I'm
[1:04:51] using girls because the church is a
[1:04:53] female.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; You understand? So, I'm I'm simply
[1:04:56] saying that we went through that time
[1:04:59] and I understand we fought over this
[1:05:01] camp and that camp and this nonsense and
[1:05:03] that nonsense, but that's what teenies
[1:05:05] do. But we're not that anymore.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; We are the mature bride of Christ. The
[1:05:11] the former and latter rain is among us.
[1:05:13] The floors are full of wheat. The vats
[1:05:14] are full of oil. The presence of the
[1:05:16] Lord is here. And the people are
[1:05:18] rejoicing and they're praising and their
[1:05:20] their their faith is rising.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not trying to capture some
[1:05:25] babyhood. We're not that anymore.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; So, so, so we have all the other things
[1:05:33] that Jesus spoke of that Jesus foretold
[1:05:36] and other prophecies in the book of
[1:05:38] Revelation that were not understood even
[1:05:40] in the ages. See,
[1:05:43] and I I really want to I really want to
[1:05:46] underscore and I keep saying and I'm
[1:05:47] going to say it one more time at least.
[1:05:50] This was how according to verse 27, this
[1:05:54] is it's it's what Peter was about to
[1:05:58] attach
[1:06:00] that God was saying, this is how you'll
[1:06:03] know I'm in your midst.
[1:06:07] You'll know I'm present in verse 27. And
[1:06:11] ye shall know that I am in the midst of
[1:06:14] Israel and that I am the Lord your God
[1:06:17] and none else. You're going to know when
[1:06:19] the former and latter rain fall together
[1:06:21] in the same month. When the token has
[1:06:24] returned, when the presence of God is
[1:06:26] among us, you're going to you're going
[1:06:28] to know that 33,000 different versions
[1:06:31] of the gospel are wrong. You're not
[1:06:33] going to have to be ashamed. You're not
[1:06:34] going to be embarrassed. You're not
[1:06:35] going to get caught holding the short
[1:06:37] end of the stick. We know whom we have
[1:06:40] believed
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; and he lives in our lives and we know
[1:06:44] where we stand. And God has and will
[1:06:50] vindicate it every time.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; it's easy to prove his presence is in
[1:06:56] our midst. That's not difficult unless
[1:06:59] you're living a life unworthy of the
[1:07:00] gospel and living as we closed out last
[1:07:04] Wednesday and God finds you along the
[1:07:05] carnal edges every time he comes to
[1:07:07] visit you.
[1:07:09] See, so the early church
[1:07:13] not only didn't understand
[1:07:17] that there would even be a falling away,
[1:07:18] although Paul warned of that,
[1:07:22] uh they and they certainly didn't
[1:07:23] understand the ages that would go into a
[1:07:27] complete 1,000 years of darkness.
[1:07:29] Brother Brandham says God wouldn't let
[1:07:30] them know that. They didn't know about
[1:07:32] the falling away in the ages and the
[1:07:33] restoration. They read those same
[1:07:35] scriptures. They had the same book of
[1:07:37] Revelation and all the Old Testament
[1:07:38] prophets, but they didn't know how to
[1:07:39] make it put together. And Paul never
[1:07:41] explained it. You understand it? It was
[1:07:44] because it was it was held as a mystery
[1:07:46] for the end time. See th those were
[1:07:49] things that would have to go through
[1:07:51] seven contiguous ages and they would as
[1:07:54] they unfolded the manifestation became
[1:07:58] the interpretation.
[1:08:00] You understand? So when we had a prophet
[1:08:03] who come in this day and the seven seals
[1:08:06] were broken to him and he went back and
[1:08:08] put all of that history together,
[1:08:11] the seven seals, you know, didn't didn't
[1:08:14] it didn't all get created by a prophet.
[1:08:16] It only showed him what God had already
[1:08:19] been doing all along up to that point.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; And then brother Brandon began to
[1:08:24] understand what my ministry really is
[1:08:27] all about.
[1:08:28] See, so even the early church didn't
[1:08:31] have those prophetic events coming to
[1:08:33] pass in them to make its fulfillment
[1:08:35] complete. That day uh that day was not
[1:08:41] our unique day. Our day is unique in
[1:08:45] many respects of of prophecies that are
[1:08:48] being fulfilled at this end time. So
[1:08:51] that being the case, all right,
[1:08:54] that being the case,
[1:08:57] then it it's odd to me as a minister of
[1:09:02] the gospel, I find it curious that
[1:09:05] anyone would want to see these
[1:09:09] expressions of God's presence somehow
[1:09:12] tamped down in the minds of the people.
[1:09:15] Yeah.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Expressions
[1:09:18] that identified his presence among us
[1:09:22] and the day when it would be the former
[1:09:25] and latter rain falling together in the
[1:09:27] same month. They would fall together at
[1:09:29] the end time to say and and and and and
[1:09:33] I'm being kind to say, you know, they're
[1:09:35] they're they're they're hesitant. They
[1:09:38] they and they they're always trying to
[1:09:40] tamp it down. tamp it down to say
[1:09:41] nothing of preaching it in a way that
[1:09:44] would somehow lessen our expectations or
[1:09:46] dare I say even squash it outright.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:09:51] that's not where Bethl Tabernacle is
[1:09:53] positioned in our understanding. We are
[1:09:55] understanding that the presence and
[1:09:57] power of God is among us and the the
[1:09:59] abstract title deed has returned. The
[1:10:01] token is in full swing. We are the bride
[1:10:04] of Jesus Christ. We are marching to the
[1:10:06] step of the gospel.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; And we're looking for everything that
[1:10:10] happened in the upper room. Don't worry.
[1:10:13] Don't worry. We're not teenies.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; It's okay. We're not babies. We don't
[1:10:18] have to be in fear. That's what the
[1:10:20] devil wants us to do is be in fear. Oh,
[1:10:23] you're going to go back. You're going to
[1:10:24] become radical. And I'm not even saying
[1:10:26] that doesn't happen on it, you know. But
[1:10:29] I I love how Brother Matt puts it. Uh
[1:10:31] it's which is worse, the left ditch or
[1:10:33] the right ditch? I mean, they're both
[1:10:35] the ditch. And so, if I'm over here
[1:10:38] saying, "Oh, there's nothing to any of
[1:10:39] that. It's all emotional. It's all
[1:10:40] sensation." And then if you go over here
[1:10:42] and you crash into this ditch and it's
[1:10:44] just a wild a wild, you know, a wild
[1:10:46] party, a wild circus, and there's
[1:10:48] nothing based on the word and no lives
[1:10:50] are being changed and the Holy Ghost
[1:10:51] isn't coming in. I want to have the
[1:10:53] middle of the road. I know where I stand
[1:10:55] in the prophecy of the Bible. I'm not
[1:10:57] afraid of the ditches because I'm
[1:10:59] following the light.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:06] I I get that we've came through
[1:11:07] babyhood. I get that.
[1:11:10] But what are we afraid of, friends?
[1:11:14] We're not trying
[1:11:16] We're not trying to mix the message with
[1:11:20] the remnants of the Isuza revival. We're
[1:11:23] not trying to do that. See, we're not
[1:11:26] trying to to to go over a cliff in some
[1:11:29] emotional sensational. But I'm here to
[1:11:32] tell you when I look at the prophecy, it
[1:11:35] includes praise.
[1:11:37] It includes joy. It includes full floors
[1:11:40] and full vats of oil. It includes your
[1:11:43] eating in plenty. It includes you being
[1:11:45] happy and rejoicing.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; So what's wrong with it if it's for us?
[1:11:53] when God
[1:11:55] came down
[1:11:58] on the mountain and in the in the
[1:12:00] Exodus. You still with me?
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Can I still just go methodically?
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; When God came down on the mountain
[1:12:09] during the first Exodus,
[1:12:13] that was uh boy, you're talking about an
[1:12:16] experience.
[1:12:18] The the whole it like an earthquake. The
[1:12:20] whole ground shook. the mountain caught
[1:12:21] on fire.
[1:12:23] This thing looked like a nuclear bomb
[1:12:24] went off right right out in front of
[1:12:26] them. And the people started backing
[1:12:28] away
[1:12:30] and and and when God came down and the
[1:12:32] people drew back in fear, Moses ran to
[1:12:36] them and said, "No, no, no, no, no.
[1:12:39] Don't go backwards. He wants to talk to
[1:12:43] you. Go forward."
[1:12:49] If I have a fear
[1:12:51] and I don't have a fear of seeing Joel's
[1:12:54] prophecy come to pass,
[1:12:56] if I do have a fear,
[1:12:59] it's that when I look at these of the
[1:13:01] first Exodus and I see a type and a
[1:13:03] parallel of us in the second ex and the
[1:13:05] third Exodus, my fear is when I look at
[1:13:08] how they they backed off and that they
[1:13:10] didn't want and brother Brandham breaks
[1:13:13] it all down, why they wanted a law that
[1:13:15] wasn't God's doing. He said that was the
[1:13:16] people's doing. That was their choice.
[1:13:18] The most rational thing. I I guess
[1:13:20] rational is a Kentucky way of saying
[1:13:21] irrational thing that they ever did.
[1:13:24] They they had a pillar of fire, the
[1:13:26] brass serpent. They had a prophet. They
[1:13:27] had thus sayeth the Lord. What you want
[1:13:29] with the law? But brother Brandham said
[1:13:32] they wanted they they they wanted to
[1:13:33] have a a certain part in it. And they
[1:13:36] didn't want the responsibility. This is
[1:13:39] what this is what makes brother Jason
[1:13:41] lose sleep at night is when I see people
[1:13:44] who are supposed to be believers name
[1:13:46] the name of the message but they really
[1:13:48] don't want the responsibility that goes
[1:13:51] along with living in his presence
[1:13:56] cuz that's next level. See, there's a
[1:14:01] responsibility that goes along with
[1:14:03] living in his presence. When the
[1:14:05] presence of God was among them there in
[1:14:08] the Exodus, they didn't want that. That
[1:14:11] it was just just give us a law or or
[1:14:16] just give us a a code that we can
[1:14:18] follow. They they'd rather let somebody
[1:14:22] else do sincerity and dedication.
[1:14:26] Just give us a law. Just give me a list
[1:14:29] of dos and don'ts. I don't I'll just let
[1:14:31] somebody else handle the sincerity, the
[1:14:33] spirituality, the closeness to God, and
[1:14:35] the real sold out, virtuous, dedicated
[1:14:38] life. I'll let somebody else do that.
[1:14:40] Just give me a a code I can keep. Tell
[1:14:42] me what kind of, you know, what kind of
[1:14:45] clothing I should wear, where I
[1:14:46] shouldn't go, what I should and
[1:14:48] shouldn't say, what I should and
[1:14:50] shouldn't have in my home. Give me some
[1:14:51] church order, and just leave me alone.
[1:14:54] And I'm all too happy to leave you
[1:14:56] alone. Believe me, I would gladly leave
[1:14:58] you alone. But I'm like a prophet who
[1:15:00] when he tried to leave everybody alone,
[1:15:02] he said it was like a fire shut up
[1:15:04] inside my bones and I could not stop
[1:15:07] prophesying. Although they were
[1:15:09] torturing him and hung him up in a in a
[1:15:10] in a in a cell, he said I I I kept
[1:15:13] preaching. I He didn't want to preach
[1:15:14] anymore. But he said it burned in me
[1:15:17] like a fire. And I I'm here to tell you
[1:15:20] something, friends. It's it's it's it's
[1:15:22] less, you know, I I I understand that
[1:15:25] people the human being looks to
[1:15:28] something that's less Can I can I just
[1:15:31] say it like this at the risk of hurting
[1:15:33] too many feelings, but I think to me
[1:15:35] what I hear them saying there in that
[1:15:37] first Exodus is it's less on me if I can
[1:15:40] just have a form of a believer
[1:15:44] while resisting the realities of it.
[1:15:49] And that's a burden that gets a pastor's
[1:15:52] attention real fast because I can see in
[1:15:56] prophecy what we're to expect, right? I
[1:16:00] can see in reality that it's come to
[1:16:03] pass.
[1:16:05] So here's the beauty of it. Wow, the
[1:16:08] word is true. Here it is. Now, where
[1:16:11] where because remember
[1:16:14] not all of the prophecy is things God
[1:16:18] was going to do. God was going to fill
[1:16:22] up their floors with food. He was going
[1:16:26] to fill up their vats with oil. He was
[1:16:29] He was going to live among them present.
[1:16:32] But it would be they who would praise
[1:16:34] and rejoice and be glad. It would be
[1:16:38] they who would acknowledge his presence
[1:16:40] among them and live that kind of a life
[1:16:42] that glorifies the presence of God.
[1:16:45] It's never been God pushing you through
[1:16:48] a pipe put pouring you into a mold,
[1:16:52] closing it, waiting for it to dry, open
[1:16:54] it up, pop you out, and look what a
[1:16:56] wonderful overcomer. There's things that
[1:16:59] God is not going to do for you. He sent
[1:17:01] you his word. He sent you his preachers.
[1:17:03] He sent you his prophets. He sent you
[1:17:05] the Holy Ghost. And brother Brandham
[1:17:06] said, "If you still won't believe it,
[1:17:08] there's nothing left for you but
[1:17:09] judgment."
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Zoe, give me Isaiah 61. I got some time
[1:17:20] left. Let's Let's get this next one.
[1:17:25] I want to show you another example of
[1:17:27] what Peter did real quick. Isaiah
[1:17:30] 61:1-2, "The spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:17:33] me because the Lord hath anointed me to
[1:17:35] preach good tidings unto the meek. He
[1:17:38] hath sent me to bind up the
[1:17:39] brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to
[1:17:41] the captives." You'll you're familiar
[1:17:42] with this. Jesus turned to this when
[1:17:43] they handed him the scroll. You remember
[1:17:45] that,
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Bible readers,
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; when he entered the entered the
[1:17:50] synagogue, they handed him the scroll
[1:17:51] for to read. And here's where he turned.
[1:17:53] All right. He hath sent me to bind up
[1:17:56] the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty
[1:17:58] to the captives, and the opening of the
[1:18:00] prison to them that are bound. Verse
[1:18:03] two, to proclaim the acceptable year of
[1:18:05] the Lord and the day of vengeance of our
[1:18:08] God to comfort all that mourn. Now,
[1:18:11] that's
[1:18:13] verses 1 and two. But when Jesus reads
[1:18:16] it in Luke 4, Luke 4:18-19,
[1:18:20] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:18:22] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:18:24] the gospel to the poor. This is out of
[1:18:26] Luke 4:18.
[1:18:28] He hath sent me to heal the
[1:18:30] brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to
[1:18:32] the captives, and recovering of sight to
[1:18:33] the blind, to set at liberty them that
[1:18:36] are bruised. Verse 19, to preach the
[1:18:38] acceptable year of the Lord. Stop.
[1:18:42] Full stop. He didn't read the rest of
[1:18:44] Isaiah's prophecy. He broke it off in
[1:18:47] the middle of the verse like Peter did
[1:18:48] in Joel. See, brother Brandham says,
[1:18:52] Brother Brandham notes this seeming
[1:18:56] anomaly twice that I could find,
[1:19:00] especially there's other times where he
[1:19:02] talks about it, but in 1965,
[1:19:05] right, right near the end of his
[1:19:06] ministry. He comes in January 1965, and
[1:19:11] then in in July 1965, he brings it up
[1:19:15] again. And that's the last two entries I
[1:19:17] can find before he's called home. He
[1:19:19] says this, "In this day, the scriptur is
[1:19:21] fulfilled." Because he's using for a
[1:19:23] quote Luke 4 that you just read.
[1:19:26] He says, "And we know how peculiar the
[1:19:28] scripture reading was because he just
[1:19:31] took a portion of the first and second
[1:19:33] verse of Isaiah 61 1-2. But he read down
[1:19:36] this far where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:19:38] upon me to build up the brokenhearted,
[1:19:40] and to give to heal the sick, to open
[1:19:41] the blinded eyes, to preach the
[1:19:43] acceptable year of the Lord." And he
[1:19:44] stopped. For the next was to bring the
[1:19:47] judgment. The next was and the day of
[1:19:51] vengeance of our God to comfort all that
[1:19:53] mourn. Jesus didn't read that part. He
[1:19:56] said he stopped because that he stopped
[1:20:00] for the next was to bring judgment and
[1:20:02] that wasn't the stage of his ministry at
[1:20:05] that time.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. See,
[1:20:08] so he goes on that would apply to his
[1:20:12] second coming, not his first coming. I
[1:20:16] don't know if I'll get to it today.
[1:20:17] There's a statement where brother
[1:20:19] Brandham points out that 80% of the
[1:20:22] ministry of Jesus when he was here on
[1:20:24] earth in the Gospels, 80% is a reference
[1:20:27] to his second coming. Not even his first
[1:20:30] one, not even Calvary, not even this the
[1:20:32] lamb of God being sacrificed. 80% of his
[1:20:34] ministry was relating to his second
[1:20:37] coming. How important are you?
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; The you say I would love to have been
[1:20:43] one of the disciples with him. 80 only
[1:20:45] 20% even applied to them. 80% of
[1:20:48] everything he was saying they didn't
[1:20:49] understand and it was applying to you.
[1:20:52] You are the people of his of his second
[1:20:55] coming. You are the ones at the
[1:20:57] culmination of all the ages. So, so he
[1:21:01] says, "And so it applied to his his
[1:21:05] second coming, not his first coming."
[1:21:06] And he stopped and turned around and
[1:21:10] said, "This day, this scripture is
[1:21:14] fulfilled."
[1:21:16] Now, it's interesting when you're
[1:21:18] fulfilling scripture because brother
[1:21:20] Brandham would would later he would go
[1:21:23] to the message of um uh I think I said
[1:21:26] it of of um
[1:21:30] so he's oh what is it traction on the
[1:21:32] mountain in July 1965. So he's first
[1:21:35] here in February 65 and he's preaching
[1:21:39] using that scripture and he's showing
[1:21:43] why Jesus stopped and that's in this day
[1:21:46] the scriptur is fulfilled and he took
[1:21:48] his text from Luke's 4. Now when he
[1:21:50] comes back in July to what is the
[1:21:53] attraction on the mountain he doesn't go
[1:21:55] back to Luke 4 as his main text he goes
[1:21:58] to Jesus triumphal entry coming into
[1:22:02] Jerusalem
[1:22:03] you remember that and they threw their
[1:22:05] garments and they shouted hosana hosana
[1:22:08] which is which just means God save us
[1:22:10] and they wanted to make him a king and
[1:22:12] he's riding he's riding on a donkey and
[1:22:14] and and so what you find is is that and
[1:22:18] it and
[1:22:19] And it caught my attention that brother
[1:22:21] Brandham is using these two scriptures
[1:22:24] and in one where Jesus is saying, you
[1:22:28] know, I've read to you Isaiah's prophecy
[1:22:31] and this scripture today is fulfilled in
[1:22:35] your hearing. In other words, Jesus was
[1:22:38] identifying himself as a fulfillment of
[1:22:41] prophecy. That's one way that you
[1:22:44] fulfill prophecy. He identified himself
[1:22:47] as a fulfillment of prophecies right
[1:22:49] there in the synagogue. But when he goes
[1:22:51] months later and he's preaching what is
[1:22:53] attraction on the mountain and he's got
[1:22:56] Jesus riding down into the city, it's
[1:22:59] not just Jesus saying. It's not just
[1:23:02] words. Today this is fulfilled in your
[1:23:05] ears. Today you're hearing a
[1:23:07] fulfillment. But then when he's writing
[1:23:09] in, he's not just declaring and saying
[1:23:12] it's fulfilled. He's literally embodying
[1:23:15] the prophecy. He's now actually acting
[1:23:18] it out. He's riding on the back of a
[1:23:20] colt and he's actually embodying. You
[1:23:23] can you can you can say, "Oh, it's
[1:23:25] coming. It's coming. It's coming. The
[1:23:27] prophecy of this, the prophecy of that."
[1:23:28] But there would come a day when it had
[1:23:30] to hit and there had to be a people. And
[1:23:32] our message to the world is not just uh
[1:23:35] there's a message that has fulfilled
[1:23:36] prophecy. The our message is we are the
[1:23:39] fulfillment of prophecy.
[1:23:42] Our life is the measuring standard God
[1:23:47] will use to judge the world by.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Maybe not what we manifest all the time,
[1:23:55] but what we are by the word in the mind
[1:23:58] of God.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; See?
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; All right. Let's do it again. Now go
[1:24:07] backwards, Zoe, to Isaiah 59. Finally
[1:24:09] going to get you there.
[1:24:19] I got loads of time.
[1:24:23] Oh, yeah. I have lots of time.
[1:24:31] All right. Now, watch.
[1:24:33] Isaiah 59 verse one. And we're going to
[1:24:36] skip along, Z. So, just be ready, honey.
[1:24:39] We're I'm going to I'm going to jump
[1:24:40] some of these. Verse We'll get verse one
[1:24:42] and two and then we'll go to seven.
[1:24:43] Verse one. Behold, the Lord's hand is
[1:24:47] not shortened that it cannot save,
[1:24:51] neither his ear heavy that it cannot
[1:24:53] hear, but your iniquities have separated
[1:24:58] between you and your God. And your sins
[1:25:02] have hid his face from you that he will
[1:25:05] not hear. Now he goes on to describe it.
[1:25:08] Verse seven, their feet run to evil.
[1:25:12] They make haste to shed innocent blood.
[1:25:15] Sound like the day and hour we're living
[1:25:16] in. Their thoughts are the thoughts of
[1:25:18] iniquity. Wasting and destruction are in
[1:25:21] their paths. Now, I'm about to prove to
[1:25:24] you in a minute, you're reading end time
[1:25:26] sequence of events and you're living
[1:25:28] these words. And even even the church is
[1:25:33] now you've reached a point in prophecy
[1:25:37] not because William Brandham said it was
[1:25:39] so. William Brandham didn't make it so.
[1:25:42] He only looked at the prophecy and said
[1:25:44] this now is fulfilled in your ears. And
[1:25:48] he says the church is no longer the
[1:25:51] mouthpiece of God. Because she has she
[1:25:55] has worshiped another Christ. She's made
[1:25:58] God,
[1:25:59] Satan, the God of this evil age. And
[1:26:02] according to the Bible, Christ has been
[1:26:05] put out in the last age. He's been put
[1:26:08] out of his church. And you see him very
[1:26:11] sad, standing on the outside knocking.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Now, he's not trying to get back in.
[1:26:16] He's knocking trying to get his
[1:26:18] children's attention to come out with
[1:26:19] him.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; See, because the message has come out of
[1:26:23] her, my people. So the only way you hear
[1:26:26] come up is if you're willing to hear
[1:26:28] come out. Because the church you're
[1:26:30] coming out of ain't going up. When
[1:26:33] brother Brandham saw the preview of the
[1:26:35] bride, it went off the edge and plunged
[1:26:37] into the abyss with screams. Only the
[1:26:39] sainted bunch of little girls ascended
[1:26:41] and went up.
[1:26:44] So we didn't create all of this. This is
[1:26:46] how this is what prophecy has declared.
[1:26:50] So he goes on verse eight showing more
[1:26:54] of our day. The way of peace they know
[1:26:57] not and there is no judgment in their
[1:26:59] goings. They have made them crooked
[1:27:02] paths. Whosoever go in there therein
[1:27:04] shall not know peace. Verse 12 Z. For
[1:27:08] our transgressions are multiplied before
[1:27:11] thee and our sins testify against us.
[1:27:14] For our transgressions are with us and
[1:27:16] as for our iniquities we know them. and
[1:27:18] transgressing and lying against the Lord
[1:27:21] and departing away from our God,
[1:27:23] speaking oppression and revolt,
[1:27:25] conceiving and uttering from the heart
[1:27:27] words of falsehood. I could stop on all
[1:27:29] of this. Talk about the day we live in.
[1:27:31] Verse 14, judgment is turned away
[1:27:34] backwards, and justice standeth a far
[1:27:36] off. For truth is fallen in the street,
[1:27:38] and equity cannot enter. Yay, truth
[1:27:41] faileth, and he that departeth from evil
[1:27:43] maketh himself a prey. And the Lord saw
[1:27:46] it and it displeased him that there was
[1:27:50] no judgment. So he's looking at the end
[1:27:52] time. Now I'm going to prove to you in a
[1:27:54] minute this is the end time. Just take
[1:27:56] my word for it right now. And he saw
[1:27:58] that there was no man and wondered that
[1:28:01] there was no intercessor.
[1:28:04] Therefore, I mean, how would the church
[1:28:07] have intercession if they've kicked the
[1:28:10] man, the intercessor out?
[1:28:14] If they put the intercessor out, there's
[1:28:17] no more intercession in there.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; You understand? So now there's no more
[1:28:22] winking at their ignorance. They
[1:28:23] require, God requires all men to now
[1:28:26] repent and come to the truth. That's
[1:28:28] what Paul said to the Jews in Acts 17.
[1:28:31] There was a time when he had let you
[1:28:32] sacrifice bulls and goats. And he winked
[1:28:35] at your ignorance. He deferred judgment
[1:28:38] because he knew the lamb was coming and
[1:28:39] he wouldn't destroy everything. He
[1:28:41] placed you in paradise. place the
[1:28:43] redeemed in paradise. But he was going
[1:28:45] to but Isaiah said he would lead out the
[1:28:47] captive and and set the captive free.
[1:28:49] And he did that.
[1:28:51] And so now he's saying and he saw that
[1:28:55] there was no man in wonder that there
[1:28:57] was no intercessor. Therefore his arm
[1:29:00] brought salvation unto him and his
[1:29:03] righteousness it sustained him. for he
[1:29:07] put on righteousness as a breastplate
[1:29:10] and a helmet of salvation upon his head.
[1:29:16] Now,
[1:29:17] it's not lost on me that right here, it
[1:29:22] goes in the middle of the verse, like
[1:29:24] we've seen in three other examples. It's
[1:29:27] not lost on me that it's going to do the
[1:29:29] same thing right in the middle of this
[1:29:31] 17th verse, and it's going to go from
[1:29:33] salvation to judgment.
[1:29:37] 17 again. For he put on righteousness as
[1:29:40] a breastplate and a helmet of salvation
[1:29:43] upon his head, and he put on the
[1:29:46] garments of vengeance. Well, which is
[1:29:49] it? Is it judgment or is it salvation?
[1:29:52] He put on the garments of vengeance for
[1:29:54] clothing and was clad with zeal as a
[1:29:56] cloak. According to their deeds,
[1:29:59] accordingly he will repay. My goodness,
[1:30:03] how did we get in the tribulation
[1:30:04] period? I know no one is saved in the
[1:30:07] tribulation period. How is he how is he
[1:30:10] clothing himself in righteousness and
[1:30:12] coming to save? And at the same time,
[1:30:14] he's coming in vengeance and to destroy.
[1:30:17] And he says, according to their deeds,
[1:30:19] accordingly he will repay for fury. Fury
[1:30:22] to his adversaries, recompense to his
[1:30:24] enemies, to the islands, he will repay
[1:30:28] recompense. But right between the going
[1:30:30] forth of the gospel coming by the Holy
[1:30:34] Ghost on the day of Pentecost and and
[1:30:36] and from there to the time that the
[1:30:40] bride is caught away before he comes in
[1:30:43] tribulation because that's where he's
[1:30:45] going to the 144,000
[1:30:47] during the tribulation.
[1:30:49] We find that the that the ministry of
[1:30:52] the bride and Paul goes right back to
[1:30:56] put this. Notice what Jesus is saying.
[1:30:58] He says, "For righteousness."
[1:31:01] All right. Verse 16 again. He wandered
[1:31:03] and no intercessor. Therefore, his arm
[1:31:05] brought salvation on him and his
[1:31:06] righteousness sustained him. Put on
[1:31:08] righteousness, the breastplate and the
[1:31:09] helmet of salvation upon his head. When
[1:31:11] you look at Ephesians 6, give me
[1:31:13] Ephesians 6 as quick as you can,
[1:31:14] sweetie. Ephesians 6:12 to18.
[1:31:18] For we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:31:21] blood, but against principalities,
[1:31:22] against powers, against the rulers of
[1:31:24] the darkness of this world, against
[1:31:26] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[1:31:28] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:31:30] of God, that you may be able to
[1:31:32] withstand in the evil day, and having
[1:31:34] done all to stand, stand therefore,
[1:31:37] having your loins gird about with truth,
[1:31:39] and having on the breastplate of
[1:31:40] righteousness, and your feet shut with
[1:31:42] the preparation of the gospel of peace,
[1:31:44] and above all the shield of faith. He
[1:31:46] says, "Wherein you shall be able to
[1:31:48] quench the fiery uh darts of the wicked,
[1:31:50] and take the helmet of salvation, and
[1:31:53] the sword of the spirit, which is the
[1:31:54] word of God, praying always, and with
[1:31:57] all prayer and supplication of the
[1:31:58] spirit, and watching there under all
[1:31:59] perseverance and supplication, we can
[1:32:02] see that verse 17 is going is the going
[1:32:05] forth of Christ with he we when we read
[1:32:10] Isaiah 59, stay with me. When we're
[1:32:13] reading this prophecy of Isaiah 59, he's
[1:32:16] putting on the God the same thing Paul
[1:32:19] is saying we're putting on and he's
[1:32:21] going and and then he's going to go into
[1:32:23] judgment and tribulation. When it's
[1:32:24] judgment and tribulation, it's God
[1:32:26] himself pouring out that wrath. But
[1:32:28] between Pentecost and the going home of
[1:32:30] the bride, he's he's moving in prophecy
[1:32:33] through you, through me, where he's
[1:32:36] putting on righteousness.
[1:32:39] He's putting on his helmet of salvation
[1:32:41] and that's in his bride.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; And then he goes to tribulation period.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; So, so that and that's we've preached on
[1:32:54] that in Psalms 127.
[1:32:57] When the father who has his quiver full
[1:33:02] of loyal, honest, decent children, he
[1:33:05] can be happy when he's falsely accused.
[1:33:09] When the devil brings up every kind of
[1:33:11] accusation, the father has to go to
[1:33:13] court and the and the and the and
[1:33:15] they're going to judge the matter. Are
[1:33:17] you guilty of these things? Father don't
[1:33:19] have to open his mouth because his
[1:33:20] children will step forward and they will
[1:33:23] contend with the accusers and they'll
[1:33:25] say, "Look at our life. Our life
[1:33:27] testifies of this man. Our life of
[1:33:30] nobility. Our life of honesty. Our life
[1:33:32] we love God. Who do you think taught us
[1:33:33] that the father doesn't have to do
[1:33:35] anything? He can clothe himself with his
[1:33:38] bride
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; and she can go forward."
[1:33:43] Oh, and then he goes on. See, so then he
[1:33:46] goes on, "So shall they fear the name of
[1:33:48] the Lord from the west and east and his
[1:33:50] glory from the rising of the sun." Now
[1:33:52] you're now you've went from God coming
[1:33:57] in his bride from Pentecost to the
[1:33:59] catching away. Then you went into the
[1:34:02] tribulation where he's pouring out his
[1:34:04] wrath. And now it's full on into the
[1:34:07] millennium. So they shall fear the name
[1:34:10] of the Lord from the west and his glory
[1:34:13] from the rising of the sun.
[1:34:17] When the enemy shall come in like a
[1:34:19] flood, the spirit of the Lord shall lift
[1:34:21] up a standard against him, and the
[1:34:24] redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto
[1:34:27] them that turn from transgression in
[1:34:29] Jacob, saith the Lord. As for me, this
[1:34:32] is my covenant with them, saith the
[1:34:35] Lord. My spirit that is upon thee, and
[1:34:38] my words which I have put in thy mouth
[1:34:40] shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor
[1:34:42] out of thy mouth of thy seed, nor out of
[1:34:44] the mouth of thy seeds seed, saith the
[1:34:47] Lord, from henceforth and forever. His
[1:34:50] covenant is with his people. It's with
[1:34:52] you and your seed and your seed seed
[1:34:54] living in a millennium. Why? Because you
[1:34:57] were willing here now to be the
[1:34:59] breastplate of righteousness. You were
[1:35:01] here now to to represent the zeal of the
[1:35:04] Lord as he went forth in salvation.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Zoe, give me Isaiah 59, last verse.
[1:35:15] And get ready to carry on. We just read
[1:35:17] it. Here's the covenant.
[1:35:20] Just in case you're still not convinced,
[1:35:23] that's the last verse of of chapter 59.
[1:35:29] Now, translators put in chapters. Do you
[1:35:32] know what the next verse is in chapter
[1:35:35] 60? Give me 60 verse one, sweetie.
[1:35:38] Isaiah 60 and1. You're going to love
[1:35:41] this one.
[1:35:43] Come on, girlfriend.
[1:35:47] Arise,
[1:35:49] shine, for thy light is come and the
[1:35:52] glory of the Lord. You just read that in
[1:35:56] ver in chapter 59. The glory of the Lord
[1:35:59] is risen upon thee. Verse two, and king
[1:36:03] and behold the darkness shall cover the
[1:36:05] earth. See, this is the prophecy in
[1:36:07] whole. This a lot of times people just
[1:36:09] read a prophecy, they just catch little
[1:36:11] snippets of it. This is the whole
[1:36:13] thought chain. This is God and he's
[1:36:16] coming. For behold, darkness shall cover
[1:36:18] the earth. That's our day. Gross
[1:36:19] darkness the people. But the Lord shall
[1:36:22] arise. It's famine in the land, but our
[1:36:25] floors are full of wheat. The Lord shall
[1:36:28] arise upon thee, and his glory shall be
[1:36:31] seen upon thee. There's no intercessor.
[1:36:33] So God performs intercession through his
[1:36:36] bride. And you take a message of
[1:36:38] salvation to the world. Arise, shine,
[1:36:42] thy light has come. Amen.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; So don't go back and tell me I can't
[1:36:48] have the effects of the Jubilee when
[1:36:51] it's the Jubilee that identifies his
[1:36:53] presence that gives me the token and
[1:36:56] restores an abstract title and and
[1:36:58] adopts me as a son and places me in
[1:37:00] authority and power. And I got to go
[1:37:02] through seven ages without that. Are you
[1:37:05] kidding me? And I got to come to the
[1:37:07] darkest age in human history. And I
[1:37:09] don't have the upper room. Oh my
[1:37:11] goodness. Oh, carry me back to old
[1:37:13] Virginia. Lord, I want to go somewhere
[1:37:16] else besides here. I want to know that
[1:37:19] my redeemer liveth. I want to know that
[1:37:22] he's living inside of me.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says now
[1:37:35] got 17 minutes.
[1:37:41] Brother Brandham says a strange thing is
[1:37:43] former and latter rain.
[1:37:46] Our Lord when he was here on earth, he
[1:37:47] taught more about his second coming. I
[1:37:48] told you I had this quote than he did is
[1:37:51] going away. Better than 80% of his talk
[1:37:54] was on his second coming. Not what was
[1:37:56] then his sacrifice and going away, but
[1:37:58] the second coming. He gave the people
[1:38:01] warnings. He said, "You hear of nation
[1:38:02] rise against nation, kingdom against
[1:38:04] kingdom. You heard of all these things,
[1:38:06] and this temple will be torn down. Not
[1:38:08] one stone left upon another.
[1:38:12] But that's not the end yet.
[1:38:16] Then right down at the end when you see
[1:38:18] the fig tree putting forth its buds and
[1:38:21] all the other trees. Likewise, when you
[1:38:24] see this, know that it's now at the
[1:38:26] door. And verily I say, this generation
[1:38:29] shall not pass until all be fulfilled.
[1:38:32] Closing.
[1:38:34] I might say this. Now
[1:38:37] remember
[1:38:39] that his job when he came down on the
[1:38:42] mountain was he was trying to talk to
[1:38:44] the people. His whole plan was to set up
[1:38:49] Israel as the as the leading nation of
[1:38:53] the earth. And God was going to give
[1:38:55] them a promised land that he built
[1:38:58] thousands of years before. Lots of
[1:39:00] people had occupied it. He was going to
[1:39:02] chase them all out. And he was going to
[1:39:05] establish that as the leading nation of
[1:39:08] the world so that the light of God's
[1:39:10] knowledge could spread in all directions
[1:39:13] and go around the world. That will be
[1:39:17] fulfilled in the millennium.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; You understand? That's why it's his
[1:39:22] headquarters. See? So, so we find then
[1:39:26] that when we when we come to terms with
[1:39:29] what we've heard today and we realize
[1:39:31] that these prophecies in Joel and these
[1:39:33] prophecies in Isaiah and you know and
[1:39:36] there's other places I could go to uh in
[1:39:38] Ezekiel and different places. This
[1:39:40] wasn't just isolated little things.
[1:39:43] These were whole multi-age,
[1:39:46] multi-generational
[1:39:48] covering multiple millennia prophecies
[1:39:51] that were unfolding down through time.
[1:39:53] And every time it was unfolding, it was
[1:39:56] God unfolding it through his people.
[1:39:59] That's what the Holy Ghost made the way
[1:40:01] for
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; all through all 2,000 years of the
[1:40:05] church ages. See? So, brother Brandham
[1:40:08] says, "So now, hey, now you can
[1:40:11] remember. Now let it weigh upon you. Why
[1:40:14] I said at the beginning the burden of my
[1:40:16] heart is that when they saw that they
[1:40:19] didn't want to accept the responsibility
[1:40:22] of living like you're you're living like
[1:40:25] his presence is among you.
[1:40:28] Brother Brandham says
[1:40:32] that closing I might say this.
[1:40:35] The morning star will reflect the sun.
[1:40:37] Now I'm calling to you morning stars.
[1:40:40] Every one of you, if you're getting I
[1:40:42] thought that brother Steve to sing that
[1:40:43] song this morning when I had this quote
[1:40:45] ready. You're getting smutted up,
[1:40:49] your eyes dimmed out with the things of
[1:40:51] the world.
[1:40:53] Polish yourself, morning stars. Take the
[1:40:57] sin out of your life. This is why I've
[1:41:00] been preaching on sinful
[1:41:04] sin is brought on by sinful living. See,
[1:41:07] sin causes sinful living.
[1:41:10] Get
[1:41:12] polish yourself morning stars. Take the
[1:41:15] sin out of your life. Get the unbelief
[1:41:17] away from you that the son of God, his
[1:41:20] coming can reflect his presence. See?
[1:41:25] And so, Brother Brandham goes through
[1:41:27] that message, and I'm not going to take
[1:41:29] many more quotes, certainly not out of
[1:41:31] that one, but if you go back and you
[1:41:33] listen to that sermon that he's
[1:41:34] preaching here, um, former and latter
[1:41:37] reign in in 1916,
[1:41:40] and he starts talking about the darkness
[1:41:43] that's covering the world, the stripping
[1:41:45] off of women and their clothing, and the
[1:41:48] immorality that's on the streets. And he
[1:41:51] he he doesn't use this term, but he he
[1:41:54] later will call it this in the sixth
[1:41:56] sense because what happens is that sixth
[1:41:59] sense is a faith sense. And brother
[1:42:01] Brandham is warning the people, hear me
[1:42:03] now, but don't go don't go to Walmart
[1:42:05] yet. Hang on. Brother Brandham is
[1:42:08] warning the people in 1960
[1:42:12] that that these are the things that dull
[1:42:16] your faith sense. And it's going to be
[1:42:18] so dark. You're going to need it.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; You're going to need it polished. You
[1:42:25] don't need it smutdded up. You need to
[1:42:27] get that stuff out of your life because
[1:42:29] you don't want to have the darkness
[1:42:31] dulling your sixth sense.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do we agree? Bethl tabernacle.
[1:42:44] He says here in choosing over bride, I
[1:42:47] still got a few minutes. I'm watching
[1:42:48] the clock.
[1:42:52] If we got a feel in our heart tonight
[1:42:54] that we should straighten up our lives
[1:42:57] and the things that we have done, let me
[1:42:59] advise you as a minister, brother, if
[1:43:02] you believe me to be God's prophet, you
[1:43:04] listen to what I've told you. If there's
[1:43:06] one little tinkle of feeling in your
[1:43:08] heart, you go to God right now. Stop
[1:43:11] just a minute, man. Look at your creeds
[1:43:13] that you serve. Look in the churches.
[1:43:15] It's just exactly what the word of God.
[1:43:17] See, it's they they've become everything
[1:43:19] the word said they would be. Uh a harlot
[1:43:22] mother and harlot daughters that have
[1:43:26] kicked Christ out.
[1:43:28] If they're everything the Bible said
[1:43:30] they would be. They're everything Jesus
[1:43:32] that Isaiah prophesied that we read. You
[1:43:35] read it with me in Isaiah 59. This is
[1:43:38] what would be going on on the streets
[1:43:39] and there would be no intercessor. So
[1:43:41] the Lord clothed himself with his people
[1:43:43] and went forward for salvation.
[1:43:51] Look into your churches. You say, "I'm a
[1:43:54] good man. So was Nicodemus.
[1:43:56] So was all the rest. They were fine.
[1:43:59] That don't have nothing to do with it."
[1:44:01] And women, I want you to look in the
[1:44:03] mirror and look what God requires a
[1:44:05] woman to do and see in God's mirror, not
[1:44:08] in your church mirror now, in God's
[1:44:11] mirror. And see if you could qualify in
[1:44:15] your life the spiritual bride of Jesus
[1:44:18] Christ.
[1:44:20] I think I read this last Wednesday in
[1:44:22] the rapture right before he's getting
[1:44:24] ready to leave the scene. When I was a
[1:44:27] child, I spake as a child. I thought as
[1:44:28] a child you act as a child, but now you
[1:44:30] grow older. Then you begin from making
[1:44:32] your first couple steps and toddle and
[1:44:33] fall and get up and try it again. Then
[1:44:36] you after a while you get so you can
[1:44:38] walk a straight line. And that's what we
[1:44:40] have to do as soldiers of the cross. Now
[1:44:45] is the time to walk a straight line
[1:44:48] right down that highway to glory. Now
[1:44:52] it's up to you whether you want to walk
[1:44:55] that highway. But can I just leave this
[1:44:59] with you? It leads to glory.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; It's up to you. He won't make you walk
[1:45:05] on it, but it leads to glory.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; I just say, "Lord God, help me get all
[1:45:11] the smuty out of my life. Help me get
[1:45:14] all the sin out of my life. Help me
[1:45:16] polish up because I I never realized so
[1:45:19] much until today that you have clothed
[1:45:21] yourself." And and the and the glory of
[1:45:24] Christ is his bride. and he put on a
[1:45:28] helmet of salvation and you put on a
[1:45:30] helmet of salvation and he's about to
[1:45:32] judge the world and the church can't
[1:45:34] help you. The church can't help you.
[1:45:36] It's going to take Christ in his word.
[1:45:38] That's the only area you're going to
[1:45:40] find intercession. So don't tell me we
[1:45:42] don't have Joel 2:28 anymore. Don't tell
[1:45:46] me we don't have If I've got Isaiah 60,
[1:45:48] I've got Isaiah 59. If I've got If I've
[1:45:52] got Joel 22 23- 27, then I've got 28,
[1:45:56] 29, 30, 31, half of 32. Don't tell me I
[1:45:59] don't have it. I have all of it.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to make it happen. I'm
[1:46:07] trying to get all the gum out of my
[1:46:10] life. I'm not trying to break to work up
[1:46:13] a a thing. I'm trying to consecrate my
[1:46:16] life. I'm trying to polish myself
[1:46:20] so that God at his choosing in his way
[1:46:25] can operate his gifts through me,
[1:46:28] through you. And the greatest gift,
[1:46:30] friends, there's no greater gift that
[1:46:33] you could think of today than to be able
[1:46:35] to say, "Lord, when you clothe, when you
[1:46:38] put on your breastplate of
[1:46:39] righteousness, let that be me. When you
[1:46:41] stand up with me, when you put on your
[1:46:43] helmet of salvation, let that be me. I
[1:46:46] got family members that I want to see
[1:46:48] saved. Let me put on that same helmet of
[1:46:52] salvation. Let me have my feet shot with
[1:46:55] the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[1:46:58] Oh my. Can you imagine what it means
[1:47:04] to
[1:47:05] have God's
[1:47:08] preparation
[1:47:10] of peace in a world that knows nothing
[1:47:14] of that anymore.
[1:47:16] A world full of turmoil,
[1:47:19] chaos, fear, anxiety. and the
[1:47:24] psychiatrists are treating the
[1:47:25] psychiatrist and they they there's no I
[1:47:29] mean they're they're having to take
[1:47:31] extreme measures just for common to keep
[1:47:34] common law and order on the streets and
[1:47:36] you've got to employ military personnel
[1:47:39] with guns say are you against that I I
[1:47:42] think whatever has to happen to keep
[1:47:44] people safe ought to be done but I'm
[1:47:46] here to tell you something friends they
[1:47:48] can throw money at it they can hire
[1:47:49] armies it ain't going to matter God this
[1:47:52] world is passing away.
[1:47:56] You cannot stay here. It's passing away.
[1:48:01] I've showed you in prophecy. We've went
[1:48:03] several different places today. And I I
[1:48:07] have to confess I I didn't fully get I
[1:48:10] just feel to stop. I didn't fully get
[1:48:12] even to my burden. I'll carry on
[1:48:14] Wednesday night, the Lord willing, if
[1:48:15] the rapture don't come.
[1:48:18] But I I just want to offer you an
[1:48:21] opportunity right now. Bow your heads
[1:48:22] across the audience. Now, I've been
[1:48:25] preaching.
[1:48:28] I've taken two Wednesdays
[1:48:31] and really dealt with where the rubber
[1:48:33] meets the road in our lives.
[1:48:36] But friends,
[1:48:38] you can't just stand back and gaze at
[1:48:41] all these spectacular revelations and oo
[1:48:43] and ah and lick your lips and say, "Oh
[1:48:46] my goodness, we're the smartest people
[1:48:47] in the world. We know Bible prophecy
[1:48:49] better than anybody. We only know it
[1:48:51] because we've become it."
[1:48:54] But what what does it mean to you in
[1:48:57] your life when I have read you that that
[1:49:01] right at the coming right at the time
[1:49:04] when you would hear the term arise shine
[1:49:09] thy light has come right before you hear
[1:49:13] that you hear about the chaos in the
[1:49:15] world and then you hear about God's
[1:49:18] remedy that he's going to go forward and
[1:49:21] he's going to clothe himself he's going
[1:49:23] to use all he's going to Paul is going
[1:49:25] to tie together exactly what the bride
[1:49:29] was on the earth for you to say today
[1:49:32] Lord I want to be part of that number
[1:49:35] hands everywhere
[1:49:37] I want to be part of that number Lord I
[1:49:40] want all the smut out of my life I want
[1:49:42] to polish up Lord I want to polish my
[1:49:45] lens I want to be able that the
[1:49:48] reflection of the Holy Ghost can shine
[1:49:51] through me there's nothing else worth
[1:49:53] living for friends. There's nothing else
[1:49:55] that means anything after that. No
[1:49:57] matter what you ever achieve in life,
[1:50:00] hear me. Whatever you achieve in life
[1:50:02] equals nothing if you miss that.
[1:50:05] Reach the highest station. Be the
[1:50:07] emperor of the whole world. Be the
[1:50:09] richest man in ever. Live the longest as
[1:50:11] any human. But it all finally ends and
[1:50:14] you equal zero.
[1:50:16] Lord God, I want you. Oh, I raise up my
[1:50:19] hands today. I want to have a fresh
[1:50:21] dedication of my life, Lord. When I look
[1:50:24] at the prophecy as a whole, and I don't
[1:50:26] just pick at it and and pick and choose
[1:50:29] and isolate scriptures, but when I take
[1:50:31] the whole overview, I can see my my
[1:50:35] goodness, it's beautiful.
[1:50:38] What a plan. Who thought of this? It It
[1:50:41] would have took a God to come up with
[1:50:43] this. somebody who could come up with a
[1:50:46] plan like this and and and implement it
[1:50:49] over over multiple millennia, thousands
[1:50:52] of years, and it never missed a beat and
[1:50:55] hit right on the head. And and if that
[1:50:58] has hit right on the head, and I read
[1:51:00] about a people, I read it in the
[1:51:02] prophecy that there will be a people
[1:51:05] whose kingdom will never end. I want to
[1:51:08] be part of that kingdom, Lord. I want to
[1:51:11] be on that road that leads to glory.
[1:51:15] I pray today that you'll take this
[1:51:18] perhaps somewhat difficult to follow
[1:51:21] lesson. I tried to go slow. I tried to
[1:51:23] be as clear as possible. Used all my
[1:51:26] faculties, Lord. Humbled myself before
[1:51:28] you. I trust that the people are
[1:51:30] understanding of it.
[1:51:33] Lord, we don't nothing about today,
[1:51:35] nothing whatever was to push back at any
[1:51:39] other kind of a thought. It wasn't about
[1:51:41] that. I have a responsibility to this
[1:51:43] audience, Lord. And those who call me a
[1:51:46] shepherd, I have a responsibility.
[1:51:48] I'm trying to keep them in this greatest
[1:51:51] battle ever fought. And I'm trying to
[1:51:53] keep the enemy beat back. And I'm trying
[1:51:54] to keep them alive, Lord. Trying to
[1:51:57] present them to you on that day as
[1:51:59] trophies.
[1:52:00] They belong to you. They always have.
[1:52:03] I'm keenly aware of that. I pray you
[1:52:06] help me, help the leadership of this
[1:52:08] church, all the ministry team, all the
[1:52:10] officers, all the worship leaders and
[1:52:12] the musicians that participate in the
[1:52:15] worship. Lord, that was your prophecy.
[1:52:18] You'll have praises. You'll have
[1:52:20] worship. You'll have the presence.
[1:52:22] You'll have the power. You'll have all
[1:52:24] of that stuff working. That's what
[1:52:26] happened
[1:52:28] on the day of Pentecost.
[1:52:30] And now we've come down to the end time
[1:52:33] where finally at last all of Joel's
[1:52:37] prophecy can finally be completed. Not
[1:52:40] just a portion of it, but all of it. The
[1:52:44] day when you pour out your former and
[1:52:47] your latter reign together in the same
[1:52:50] month at the end time.
[1:52:52] Now Lord God, we can finish this race,
[1:52:56] finish up our assignment. You can call
[1:52:58] us home. Moses and Elijah will go and
[1:53:02] find the 144,000. They'll find Benjamin
[1:53:05] born in in your absence.
[1:53:08] We love you for that, Lord God. We
[1:53:11] commit it to you now. And all the hands
[1:53:13] that were raised, hands that raised up
[1:53:16] from sincere hearts who want to know you
[1:53:19] more, I commit it to you in Jesus name.
[1:53:23] Amen.

[1:55:34] the earth. That's our day
[1:55:37] and gross darkness
