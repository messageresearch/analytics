[38:17] but he's the type of guy that he a liar
[38:19] cut to run over
[38:21] he said he's more than enough for people
[38:24] and then praise God hallelujah a maybe
[38:28] won't Terry we're gonna turn straight to
[38:30] the scripture we're gonna look in the
[38:31] Book of Jonah tonight Amen maybe an
[38:33] unusual place and in but Jonah the first
[38:35] chapter starting at the first verse then
[38:40] also we want to pick something up in the
[38:42] New Testament in the book of Philippians
[38:44] at the same time how to lose your soul
[38:47] we started Jonah 1 we're gonna read in
[38:49] John or 3 as well then Philippians the
[38:52] third chapter man praise God I don't
[38:56] know about you but I always enjoyed the
[38:57] opportunity amen stand before a living
[39:00] God amen praise God hallelujah now we
[39:05] all familiar with the story of Jonah
[39:06] tonight he may appreciate the musicians
[39:08] amen now the word of the Lord came unto
[39:14] Jonah the son of amitayus and him and
[39:17] this was no news a newspaper but this
[39:20] was the word of the Lord and it said
[39:23] arise go to Nineveh that great city and
[39:27] cry against it for the wickedness has
[39:30] come up before me now Jonah had a
[39:32] specific task that the Lord had given
[39:34] him to do what he says but Jonah rose up
[39:40] to flee under Tosh's from the presence
[39:43] of the Lord it went down to job and he
[39:46] found a ship going to Tarshish so he
[39:48] paid the fare thereof and went down and
[39:50] to it to go with them under Tosh's from
[39:53] the presence of the lord a man we know
[39:56] Almighty God gave him a task to do and
[39:58] instead of him doing that task he was in
[40:00] the opposite direction but the Lord I
[40:04] mean that's another but on their name
[40:05] send out a great win into the sea
[40:08] and there was a mighty tempest in the
[40:09] sea so that
[40:10] the ship was like to be broken in it so
[40:14] here Jonah is moving in the opposite
[40:16] direction from what the Lord wanted him
[40:18] to do but Almighty God sometimes when he
[40:21] allow certain things to happen on your
[40:24] track it man maybe I allow storm to
[40:27] happen on your track to get you back in
[40:29] line I mean now we know what happened
[40:31] for dealing out a man how to salvage
[40:33] threw him overboard amen he end up in
[40:34] the bay level up a special prepared
[40:36] fisherman but I want to draw your
[40:38] attention tonight to the third chat in
[40:40] the first verse because I want to catch
[40:42] what happened the second time around
[40:44] with Jonah me we see the first time when
[40:46] he had a call and in a direction that he
[40:48] was supposed to go in in the direction
[40:50] that he went in but God is gracious and
[40:53] all things the third chapter in the
[40:56] first verse it says in the word of the
[40:59] Lord came unto Jonah the second time we
[41:06] read earlier that the word of the Lord
[41:07] already came to Jonah but he's a lotta
[41:10] come back to a second time because God
[41:13] is in the business of being able to
[41:15] extend second chances and the people
[41:18] sometimes hallelujah glory to God and he
[41:22] said arise going to Nineveh he didn't
[41:24] change his story now he's telling the
[41:26] same thing once again arise going to
[41:29] Nineveh that great city and preach unto
[41:31] it the preaching that I busy so Jonah
[41:34] arose went in the Nineveh according to
[41:36] the word of the Lord
[41:37] now Nineveh was a seen great city of
[41:38] three days journey and Jonah began to
[41:40] enter to the city of days journey and he
[41:43] big any cried and he said yet forty days
[41:45] and then of us should be overthrown but
[41:47] now catch what happened when when the
[41:50] word of the Lord came through the man of
[41:52] God amen to help get the people back in
[41:54] the line fifth verse says saw the people
[41:57] of Nineveh a man believed God a man
[42:02] that's one of the greatest things that
[42:04] you could ever do in any circumstance in
[42:08] any situation a man is to just believe
[42:12] God even your ABCs always believe Christ
[42:16] the people who never believed God and
[42:18] then they believed that got put in
[42:20] action and proclaimed a fast and put on
[42:22] sackcloth from the greatest of them evil
[42:24] lisa-marie down to the tempers quickly
[42:26] amen but a word came unto the king of
[42:28] Nineveh and he arose from his throne and
[42:31] he laid his role from him and covered
[42:33] him with sackcloth and sat in ashes even
[42:35] the king came in and he caused it to be
[42:38] proclaimed and published through Nineveh
[42:40] by the decree of the king and his noble
[42:42] saying let neither man nor beast heard
[42:46] nor flaw taste anything let them not
[42:49] feed nor drink water they was in a state
[42:52] of desperation today said we not even
[42:55] gonna let our sin our livestock if they
[42:58] need it man but let mana beast be
[43:02] covered with sackcloth and cry mildly
[43:04] under God
[43:05] yay let them turn everyone from his evil
[43:07] way and from the violence that is in
[43:10] their hands
[43:10] what can tell if God will turn and
[43:13] repent and turn away from his fierce
[43:16] anger that we perish not even and this
[43:20] is the most important part that we get
[43:21] to me and God saw their works hallelujah
[43:24] I'm glad that God sees all things that
[43:26] they turn from the evil way and God
[43:29] repented of the evil that he said he
[43:32] would do unto them and he did it not the
[43:37] thing that he should've did it me the
[43:39] thing that he should have cast him in
[43:41] the judgment he decided not to do it
[43:45] he saw it at hearts where he saw it
[43:48] mindset was tonight for tired are we
[43:52] gonna take the god of a second chance in
[43:55] it the god of a second chance he's in
[43:58] the business of giving its people
[44:00] another opportunity to do more form in
[44:04] all things Philippians 3 started 11th
[44:09] verse and then we'll let you be seated I
[44:11] know it's a lot of reading but I just
[44:13] like to read description hallelujah flip

[44:20] second chance here I mean I looked at
[44:23] this for the Easter service not too long
[44:25] ago but I think it applies tonight as
[44:27] well if by any means I might attain unto
[44:29] the resurrection of the Dead not as
[44:32] though I had already attained either
[44:35] we're already perfect
[44:37] but I follow after posting I'm not all
[44:39] the way there with some things but I'm
[44:41] following after if that I made apprehend
[44:45] that for which also I am an apprehended
[44:48] of Christ Jesus what he's saying is he
[44:51] wants to make sure that he grabs ahold
[44:54] of the thing that has grabbed ahold of
[44:56] him brother and I conduct myself to have
[44:59] apprehended but this one thing I do
[45:02] forgetting those things which are behind
[45:05] and reaching forth unto those things
[45:09] which are before I press toward the mark
[45:13] for the prize of the high calling of God
[45:17] in Christ Jesus amen this is by hands

[46:11] lovely name of Jesus Christ at the st.
[46:13] saving hallelujah
[46:15] you could be seated tonight if you so
[46:17] desire hallelujah praise God
[46:20] here Paul leave me he's picking up a
[46:22] thought and the book of Philippians a
[46:25] many a lot of times when we take this
[46:27] scripture about pressing towards the
[46:29] mark and when we start talking about
[46:32] leaving things behind a lot of times we
[46:34] we take this scripture around New Year's
[46:37] Eve time for watch night services and
[46:39] different things when you go on from old
[46:41] you into a new Yemen but also
[46:44] description can be applicable anytime
[46:47] you you
[46:48] see some things that are behind you and
[46:50] you see things that are before you and
[46:54] you see a direction that Almighty God
[46:57] wants you to go in it what happens as
[47:01] believers sometimes is that there is a
[47:04] spirit of complacency that could set in
[47:07] it there's a lot of spirits that off
[47:09] parade in the midst allowed to see a
[47:12] Amen and one thing is a spirit of
[47:15] complacency that can say I'm rich and I
[47:18] have need of nothing and not knowing
[47:23] that you have shortcomings which are
[47:24] outside not knowing that you haven't
[47:27] shortcomings with what you dress them
[47:28] with the word amen and that spirit of
[47:31] complacency even on the bride is far
[47:33] away from land and sea
[47:35] nevertheless insurance always exert its
[47:37] influence upon the people of God and
[47:40] bring forth for spirit of complacency
[47:42] amen
[47:44] Paul he told the people of God to get
[47:47] away from it amen as far as you gone
[47:50] there's further that we can go as far as
[47:54] you go a minute that there's more things
[47:56] that you can go into it man all that
[47:58] you've done there's still more than we
[48:01] can do a man he was guarding against the
[48:03] spirit of complacency and telling the
[48:05] people sometimes there's some things are
[48:07] behind you that you have to forget him
[48:11] forgetting those things that are behind
[48:13] reaching for those things that are
[48:15] before him in pressing towards the mark
[48:18] what happens in journal humans are very
[48:21] resistant to change that's something
[48:22] that we're all familiar with
[48:23] we don't really like moving to something
[48:26] different sometimes we don't like moving
[48:30] into something that's relatively our
[48:31] know there's a certain comfort level and
[48:34] a comfort zone that we always want to be
[48:37] able to stick in it and in the midst of
[48:40] that since God is that God the swords in
[48:42] the business of shaking things up
[48:44] sometimes
[48:45] what happens is he'll send things along
[48:48] your path that will cause you if you
[48:50] just whistling and twiddling your thumbs
[48:52] walking along eventually you will come
[48:54] upon something that's going to cause you
[48:56] to have to redirect your way so here we
[49:00] are
[49:01] nation amen in a time of great upheaval
[49:04] amen time a great change in time of
[49:09] unusual circumstances a time we even the
[49:12] oldest among us amen
[49:14] some of your senior sentence may be 80
[49:16] and 85 maybe even nine years old have
[49:19] not even seen things taking place on the
[49:22] earth or taking place within our nation
[49:25] like the things that are taking place
[49:27] right now and see what happens in the
[49:30] midst of those things there's a great
[49:32] desire to always get things back to what
[49:35] they were there's a great push to get
[49:38] things back to how they were in the
[49:40] beginning amen but sometimes things
[49:43] aren't always meant to go back to how
[49:45] they were in the beginning there's a
[49:49] rush to get things opened back up and to
[49:51] get people moving and to give people
[49:53] enough money so thanks go back to how
[49:55] they used to be but you know brother
[49:58] Jason I think that this thing has left
[49:59] such a profound impact on the lives of
[50:02] people I don't think it ever fully get
[50:05] back to what it used to be a man thanks
[50:10] for you know not even when you shake
[50:11] some money hey you know somebody gonna
[50:13] have a thought in the back of their mind
[50:14] about shaking somebody's hand by hugging
[50:16] one another you mean about getting
[50:18] closer whispering something to somebody
[50:20] a man these things a man is we're in
[50:23] unusual times too to the point that I
[50:26] don't fully see it always getting back
[50:29] to what it used to be all right because
[50:33] God is still in the business of shaking
[50:35] things the scripture in the book of
[50:38] Hebrews amen he talks about how to earth
[50:41] was shaking him and Hebrews the twelve
[50:42] chattering man and then he talks about
[50:44] how the next time around a man not only
[50:47] the Earth's gonna be shaken but heaven
[50:50] is gonna be shaken as well amen the
[50:52] spiritual things that people hold on
[50:54] save me if you don't have a tied up in
[50:56] the Christ in the right way and what
[50:59] he's saying is the reason why those
[51:01] things will get shaken the reason why
[51:04] the shaking happens sometimes it's
[51:07] because he he shakes the things that
[51:09] can't be shaken so that the things that
[51:12] cannot be shaken
[51:14] those things will still remain the
[51:18] things that cannot be shaken the
[51:21] foundation that we have within Jesus
[51:23] Christ that cannot be shaken hallelujah
[51:26] we're part of a kingdom that cannot be
[51:29] shaken even if we try to go back to
[51:34] things how they used to be a man but we
[51:37] will see a sense of how things started
[51:39] out maybe the world had a deeper sense
[51:41] of unity starting out with the things
[51:43] that we had to go through but now all
[51:44] the sudden you see like the political
[51:46] divide that they had is is getting
[51:48] greater getting so doesn't matter what
[51:51] man tries to do naturally sometimes
[51:54] there's more things that work going on
[51:56] in there but when circumstances arising
[52:00] and circumstances have a way of doing
[52:02] these one or two things that either get
[52:04] you closer to God Amen I get you further
[52:06] away from God it either gets you closer
[52:09] to trusting an Almighty God and trusting
[52:12] the things you've been taught and
[52:14] trusting the things you believe in I
[52:16] want to push your way and cause you to
[52:18] trust and other things cause you to
[52:21] trust in the CDC more I'll cause you to
[52:23] trust in the presidency more a man and
[52:25] you either get closer to God or fall
[52:27] away from God powerful to God a man he
[52:32] said that we're living in an age but we
[52:35] would need more faith in men than any
[52:37] other agent in 1965 spiritual new season
[52:40] in men we will call more faith than ever
[52:43] in any age because there were people
[52:45] that have to have rapture faith and then
[52:48] we are people that see circumstances and
[52:51] all those circumstances do just how
[52:53] brother Ken sung a little bit earlier
[52:55] and calls us to sing a song called
[52:57] Beulah land Lord I'm getting homesick
[53:00] Lord I got a desire for something crazy
[53:03] man Paul said the believer is always in
[53:07] the business of moving forward amen
[53:10] leaving those things are behind reaching
[53:13] for those things that are before us amen
[53:16] and if you can't if these circumstances
[53:20] and things hadn't cause you to draw
[53:22] closer to Christ then I don't know what
[53:25] well
[53:28] if this time period hasn't cause you to
[53:30] read more in man and pray more man and
[53:33] love your family more that I don't know
[53:36] what well in these times they slowed us
[53:40] down you're not too long ago my wife
[53:42] told me you know God bless us to be
[53:45] married for we're going on 13 years and
[53:47] she said brother Mark Maurice you don't
[53:48] cook like you used to cook but guess
[53:51] what circumstances slow life down enough
[53:53] today I'm doing a lot of cooking around
[53:56] going back in reestablishing things I
[53:59] mean my family means more to me the Word
[54:04] of God amen being my shield knowing that
[54:07] the name of the Lord is a strong tower
[54:09] amen it means more to me now amen
[54:12] if you don't come out of this thing with
[54:14] a deep understanding of the grace of God
[54:16] because you could use Purell you cannot
[54:19] shake hands you could stay six feet
[54:21] apart
[54:22] you can stay 12 feet apart and you still
[54:25] could get everything amen
[54:27] I'm not saying that you don't do those
[54:29] things but at the end of the day a lot
[54:32] of people have done those things and
[54:33] still come down with something so what
[54:36] it shows you is it gives you a deeper
[54:39] appreciation of the grace Almighty God
[54:43] you should come out of this thing with a
[54:45] deeper appreciation for the ministry
[54:48] even a deeper appreciation for your
[54:51] church event the brothers are they
[54:53] working tirelessly to make sure that you
[54:55] have a smooth stream going into your
[54:57] house so you can hear the word of God
[54:59] amen
[55:00] because faith comes by here so you can
[55:02] hear the word of God to have your faith
[55:04] stoked in these times they meant what
[55:07] faith is fading away God wants his
[55:11] people moving forward amen
[55:14] come on the prophets shoulder said man
[55:16] had that frog spirit in the book of
[55:17] Revelation behind the eyes with that
[55:19] frog is set up so that the frog is
[55:21] always looking behind themselves
[55:23] amen but God has called his people to be
[55:26] Eagles in the sideway man we're looking
[55:28] at him and in this time per day man you
[55:31] know I think people have a desire to get
[55:33] things to how they used to be but at the
[55:37] same time I believe that he wants to
[55:39] have our attention for us to get that
[55:41] much
[55:41] closer to him amen he wants to have our
[55:45] attention for us to understand that time
[55:48] is moving a minute and it's time for us
[55:51] to be able to get our comfort zone stay
[55:53] out of our comfort zone amen
[55:56] even I was described in the book of
[55:57] Matthew Amen huh we had the ten virgins
[56:00] we are familiar with the story but if
[56:03] I'm for the God said it was some virgins
[56:06] that would shrimp their lap get that
[56:08] carving off the lamps it would keep
[56:10] burning bright sometimes things happen
[56:14] amen to remind you to keep that carbon
[56:17] off your lamp
[56:18] keep your lamp trimmed its lamp trimming
[56:21] time he's giving us all our patootie
[56:26] amen to joy that much closer to him amen
[56:29] to do that much more for him amen she's
[56:32] always good to have more time with your
[56:33] family but now I want to show the Lord
[56:36] amen that I'm doing something with my
[56:38] time that I'm spending with him as well
[56:41] we looked at a brief story Ava in the
[56:44] story of Joan a man we know that it
[56:46] deals about the city of Nineveh in the
[56:49] scripture that we read started out and
[56:51] it talks about how the life that they
[56:54] was living with in the city of Nineveh
[56:56] the sin that was taking place the things
[56:58] that were going on how it was so vile a
[57:01] man the Bible says that it came up
[57:04] before God the wickedness of the people
[57:07] came up before God what they were doing
[57:12] it was so strong it was so impactful
[57:14] that nobody could deny me that these
[57:17] were sinful people they've been and that
[57:18] they were in trouble
[57:20] but you know the thing that Almighty God
[57:22] did for those people was that he gave
[57:24] him a second chance and he gave them a
[57:26] second opportunity Noel says believers
[57:31] Amen sometimes you know you look at a
[57:32] second chance second opportunity I'm not
[57:34] so much talking about your salvation I'm
[57:36] not so much talking about a life of sin
[57:37] amen and those things do apply mean he
[57:40] gave a lot of us a second chance to come
[57:42] out of sin to come out of things that
[57:44] you were Stoffel with to come out of
[57:46] things that you should not have been
[57:47] doing amen but you know he gave us
[57:50] another chance to draw that much more
[57:53] closer to yeah
[57:55] he gave us another chance to have his
[57:58] word reveal to us just that much more in
[58:02] our hour where people have a very poor
[58:04] understanding of the word of God but
[58:06] nevertheless he had a special people
[58:09] that he gave a second chance to you know
[58:14] I like what he did for them even as he
[58:16] allowed a warning to come before the
[58:19] judgment came in one thing God is in the
[58:21] business of doing a man he'll give you
[58:23] some warning before the judge made me
[58:26] what did he do he said I'm a prophet let
[58:28] him know what was going on and that's
[58:31] not too far from what we familiar with
[58:33] amen
[58:33] God sent us a prophet to let us know
[58:35] what was going on that way we can have
[58:37] some warning before the judgement good
[58:41] with so many things and from the book
[58:42] but there was a very poor understanding
[58:43] of what was within the book and see what
[58:48] the warning coming before the judgment
[58:50] what it does is it gives you an
[58:52] opportunity to get things right amen
[58:55] you know one of the greatest things
[58:57] anybody ever have is an opportunity it's
[59:00] not a lot of times he won't stuff give
[59:02] it to them but they just want an
[59:03] opportunity to do something man and if
[59:07] you get the opportunity and if you have
[59:09] the right things within your heart you
[59:11] will make the most of that opportunity
[59:14] hallelujah I'm in love the Lord tonight
[59:16] amen
[59:17] now the Scriptures talking about Nineveh
[59:20] a city a man I mean know the Bible type
[59:22] such as being a city as well
[59:24] no we're familiar with the book of
[59:25] Revelation amen it talks about a city
[59:28] sitting on seven hills a man is
[59:29] referring to Mystery Babylon him in and
[59:31] we know what type of situation she is in
[59:34] amen
[59:34] God's taught us how that's the false
[59:36] church amen denominational systems they
[59:38] been going in the wrong direction linked
[59:41] up to that mother harlot amen and
[59:43] nevertheless a minute the scripture
[59:46] tells us how they destroy they were
[59:49] shrunk off of the blood of the Saints in
[59:51] man they were living amongst the kings
[59:53] of the earth Amen in that city was tight
[59:55] as being a church but then again a man
[59:59] is also a people of God amen
[1:00:01] being tight as being a city Amen that
[1:00:03] city it's called the New Jerusalem so
[1:00:07] even though we told my Nana
[1:00:08] being a city a minute and it seems the
[1:00:11] user has a type but nevertheless the
[1:00:12] people of God I tighten as a city as
[1:00:15] well event John was sitting in the
[1:00:19] script shame in the book of Revelation
[1:00:21] 21st chapter an angel said he was going
[1:00:25] to show John the bride the Lambs wife he
[1:00:27] meant and instead a many John looking he
[1:00:30] saw a city a man he said it was
[1:00:32] ascending down from from heaven aim in
[1:00:35] the holy city coming down from God out
[1:00:37] of heaven prepared as a bride adorned
[1:00:41] for her husband a man revelations what
[1:00:42] he wanted to is it prepared as a bride
[1:00:46] adorned for a husband something having
[1:00:50] the glory of God shining with fear hurry
[1:00:52] men Almighty God has blessed sure that
[1:00:55] you had the glory of God shining within
[1:00:57] you amen
[1:00:59] talking about the precious stones and
[1:01:02] the precious things with finesse it
[1:01:05] talked about the walls and the gates and
[1:01:08] the foundations they meant how he set us
[1:01:11] up as believers amen with walls against
[1:01:14] certain things from the enemy Haman and
[1:01:15] certain gates to uh certain things in
[1:01:18] and certain things up he's surrounded us
[1:01:21] with precious stones amen
[1:01:23] he's built himself a place where
[1:01:25] Almighty God can abide in the midst of a
[1:01:28] dark and evil age where he could be
[1:01:33] comfortable where he could sharpen show
[1:01:37] his power even a bride that he set aside
[1:01:42] evening that was specially personally in
[1:01:47] profit but we know better now that Jonah
[1:01:51] was actually doing the will of the Lord
[1:01:52] because him going the complete opposite
[1:01:55] direction quarter garden is complete
[1:01:58] opposite way on the man ended up in the
[1:02:01] belly of that fish just to come out amen
[1:02:05] in Nineveh and for those people to see
[1:02:07] this man of God walking from out of the
[1:02:09] mouth for the fishing man the very thing
[1:02:11] that they worship because they worship a
[1:02:13] fish guy the very thing that held in
[1:02:16] high esteem and high regard even when
[1:02:20] they had they parties when they had they
[1:02:21] sacrifice
[1:02:22] dagon was a big goddamn monster but then
[1:02:26] they saw a man of God walking out of the
[1:02:28] mouth for that same fish that he might
[1:02:30] with a worship tell her name was time to
[1:02:33] repent get your hops in order and get
[1:02:36] right if God would show that type of
[1:02:42] favor to a backslidden city like Nineveh
[1:02:45] how much more favor would he shows his
[1:02:47] bride in New Jerusalem amen hallelujah
[1:02:50] evening now the scripture says in Jonah
[1:02:54] the third chapter in the fifth verses a
[1:02:56] minute says that the people of Nineveh a
[1:02:59] man once they got the opportunity did
[1:03:01] something with it Amen we have to be
[1:03:04] careful with our opportunity what we do
[1:03:06] with it and what we don't do with it
[1:03:07] because you know these times can wrap up
[1:03:10] an in and you know people go on about a
[1:03:11] business and it's just a blip on your
[1:03:13] radar but then it comes a question of
[1:03:18] how do we use this time period to draw
[1:03:22] that much more closer to Christ to get
[1:03:25] more of him within a segment to
[1:03:28] understand that there's still more that
[1:03:30] we could receive I'm happening the Book
[1:03:35] of Jonah third shot in the fifth verse
[1:03:37] amen when the Prophet came and he
[1:03:40] preached them and told them to get right
[1:03:42] and told him that they were very simple
[1:03:45] before this guy that it did not have any
[1:03:47] knowledge of but they started this guy
[1:03:48] was powerful enough to bring their own
[1:03:50] guys within or date men the fifth verse
[1:03:53] it says so the people of Nineveh
[1:03:55] believed God that's such a simple thing
[1:04:01] to say and that you believe God but you
[1:04:05] know out of the millions or billions of
[1:04:07] people that walked is how if you have a
[1:04:11] testimony that they believe God because
[1:04:16] I'll tell you something you could
[1:04:18] believe in a lot of things you believe
[1:04:21] what South Carolina DHEC is doing it you
[1:04:23] believe the things that dr. future
[1:04:25] you're saying even because he's a very
[1:04:26] smart man but you know believe in God
[1:04:29] hallelujah will remind you that all
[1:04:32] things are possible
[1:04:34] believe in God a minute it'll remind you
[1:04:38] that he could do anything
[1:04:40] I failed believe in God will remind you
[1:04:46] that he will keep the plague away from
[1:04:48] you and then the fact that you believe
[1:04:53] God is what separates you for none
[1:04:58] believe a man that's the basic thing to
[1:05:00] say Amen but just think how different
[1:05:03] the words are when you say a believer
[1:05:05] and unbeliever the two words are so far
[1:05:10] apart just by you adding two little
[1:05:13] letters to the word believer and you'll
[1:05:15] be an unbeliever that immediately cut
[1:05:18] you off from the access of the power of
[1:05:21] Almighty and unlimited a god but you
[1:05:26] know believers were why different Amen
[1:05:29] God says that we believe it that settles
[1:05:32] it Amen we walk by the unseen things
[1:05:36] which is faith in it because we know
[1:05:39] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:05:41] a believer will believe all the way down
[1:05:46] to the enemy even had that little widow
[1:05:50] woman when she had her son and just had
[1:05:52] a little bit of meal laughing about it
[1:05:54] about she went down believing what that
[1:05:58] prophet said amen
[1:05:59] and he asked her to fix him a cake and
[1:06:01] she fixed that cake on and she didn't
[1:06:04] know anything about it all she did was
[1:06:05] believe a believer peace believe it on
[1:06:10] till the very end
[1:06:12] no matter the circumstance keep
[1:06:15] believing come on Saints no matter the
[1:06:17] test
[1:06:18] keep believing God amen hallelujah and
[1:06:22] see what believing God does is because
[1:06:24] faith is action word amen faith without
[1:06:27] works is dead so if you believe on long
[1:06:30] enough it is starting to put you in
[1:06:32] action and you could demonstrate to the
[1:06:34] world what you believe and what
[1:06:39] believing does is they cast out fear
[1:06:42] hallelujah Bible says if those people
[1:06:45] believe amen
[1:06:47] the people of Nineveh believed God Amen
[1:06:50] not only did they believe then they
[1:06:52] started getting put in action a man it's
[1:06:54] good to come out to church a man say I'm
[1:06:56] gonna believe Amen we sing only believe
[1:06:58] before the preacher comes out those
[1:07:00] things are well and good but see
[1:07:01] believing is action it's got to be
[1:07:07] demonstrated beyond what's just a mental
[1:07:10] connotation a minute of what you're
[1:07:12] taking him in but you show it in your
[1:07:13] actions now these people when they
[1:07:16] believe God in me they went forward they
[1:07:17] proclaim the fast and they put on the
[1:07:19] sackcloth amen there was a great
[1:07:21] humbling of themselves before Almighty
[1:07:24] God in Scripture lets us know that they
[1:07:28] cried out to God in me that they cried
[1:07:30] mightily out to God that's what it says
[1:07:32] Nate first they cried mightily unto Him
[1:07:37] they humbled themselves in men it was so
[1:07:41] they were so concerned about what the
[1:07:43] Word of God said when it came to they
[1:07:46] even got a pets and the animals in the
[1:07:48] livestock in order because they believed
[1:07:51] what he said us being the body of Christ
[1:07:56] and us believing what the gospel is said
[1:07:58] to us I mean it calls us to get our
[1:08:01] house in order men it calls us to get
[1:08:04] our families in order causes us to get
[1:08:06] our lives in order calls us to keep our
[1:08:09] hearts in order because we believe God
[1:08:12] and we want to show our belief as being
[1:08:15] action word you know how like I even
[1:08:21] said how to King the king of this great
[1:08:24] city even earlier in the scripture says
[1:08:26] that the city of Nineveh was so big it
[1:08:29] took you three days to walk through the
[1:08:30] entire city
[1:08:32] so this king he was a big time king it
[1:08:35] man he was just the king of a little
[1:08:37] side city somewhere they just had a few
[1:08:39] hundred people but he was the king of a
[1:08:41] major city he was somebody that people
[1:08:44] looked up to but the scripture lets us
[1:08:47] know even though he was a leader he did
[1:08:49] something different from the leadership
[1:08:51] that you see a lot nine days a man this
[1:08:53] leader humbled himself before God this
[1:08:57] leader took time then he tuned himself
[1:09:00] down
[1:09:01] with the rest of the people and the
[1:09:03] scripture says from the king all the way
[1:09:06] down to the least they humble themselves
[1:09:08] they got on one Accord it man he didn't
[1:09:11] say well this up for me to see he asked
[1:09:14] and for the rest y'all to get y'all
[1:09:15] selves in order but everybody got in
[1:09:18] line that's why you ought to think I
[1:09:21] forgot the leadership it in a godly past
[1:09:24] a meaning somebody that knows how to
[1:09:27] humble themselves a man how to get their
[1:09:29] whole self and how to get their whole
[1:09:31] mindset out of the way what these people
[1:09:37] did they took time they got serious with
[1:09:39] God even as the time saying get serious
[1:09:43] with God stay serious with God not
[1:09:47] saying anybody here wasn't serious we
[1:09:49] got a man but even Paul recognized there
[1:09:52] was a time that we had to forget those
[1:09:54] things that were behind us it's a time
[1:09:59] where we have to move away from certain
[1:10:01] things in you a second chance if you got
[1:10:09] sending your life and you need another
[1:10:10] chance to get it straightened out he's
[1:10:13] graces now yeah he has done that you've
[1:10:18] got little things in your heart against
[1:10:20] your brother or your sister in that you
[1:10:22] need to get straight now he's so
[1:10:24] gracious things that he instills that
[1:10:27] second chance hallelujah glory to God if
[1:10:31] you know you were slow forward reading
[1:10:34] studying amen and really got to the
[1:10:38] things of God you know it is we get so
[1:10:40] busy with the cares of this life and
[1:10:43] things that are going on and making sure
[1:10:45] our families are situated but
[1:10:47] nevertheless he's not a God that would
[1:10:49] allow judgment to come when I give you
[1:10:52] some water a man he would give you
[1:10:54] another chance to get it right
[1:10:56] and that says believers officers people
[1:11:00] that love God I says being set aside as
[1:11:03] being part of the Bride of Christ what
[1:11:05] we do we'll do even more than what the
[1:11:07] people of nineveh did we take advantage
[1:11:09] of the second chance hallelujah
[1:11:12] understand that he's the God of the
[1:11:14] second chance even the man of God in the
[1:11:20] description of Jonah he is a prophet he
[1:11:23] is getting a word directly from Almighty
[1:11:25] God himself go to Nineveh and what does
[1:11:27] he do he goes to complete opposite
[1:11:29] direction innovated me Tosh's was
[1:11:32] somewhere out by Portugal and Spain and
[1:11:34] then Nineveh was going into the Middle
[1:11:36] East so he's going the complete opposite
[1:11:38] direction over thousands of miles away
[1:11:40] in another direction but he still gave a
[1:11:44] second chance to make it right when
[1:11:48] we're talking about Pope all amen
[1:11:50] Paul was the poster child of somebody
[1:11:53] had a second chance it man and you could
[1:11:56] see that in his rightness
[1:11:57] how he would talk about the grace of God
[1:11:59] all things work together and the things
[1:12:03] that he came out from it oh my when he
[1:12:05] wrote the book of Hebrews and wrote the
[1:12:08] book of Ephesians you can see those
[1:12:10] things in Paul that Paul was very
[1:12:12] appreciative of the second chance that
[1:12:14] Almighty God had given under him in the
[1:12:20] book of Philippians I mean Paul he
[1:12:21] starts to going back over some of the
[1:12:23] things in his life I mean we know Paul
[1:12:25] was a very educated man he was learned
[1:12:27] in the scripture he tells us at one
[1:12:29] point he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees
[1:12:31] but at the same time he turns around and
[1:12:34] said but I had to count a lot of those
[1:12:36] things as dung said I could attain them
[1:12:39] to the ecstasy of Christ man he had to
[1:12:42] count those things I mean that's a very
[1:12:44] strong word to say but he said he
[1:12:46] counted us doing the things that were
[1:12:51] his own thoughts the things that were
[1:12:53] his own ideas the things that was his
[1:12:55] own mind set him and I read it to you
[1:12:57] men he said yea doubtless I kind of all
[1:13:00] these things but loss for the excellency
[1:13:02] of the knowledge of Jesus Christ my lord
[1:13:06] amen
[1:13:07] history a demon for whom I have suffered
[1:13:10] the loss of all things and do count them
[1:13:13] but dung why that I may win Christ
[1:13:19] everything that we do is drawing closer
[1:13:23] to Christ in this alley me Paul said it
[1:13:28] was a time it meant to lay something
[1:13:30] Society then leave some things behind
[1:13:33] reach forward to some certain things if
[1:13:36] we hadn't had any growth since the
[1:13:38] beginning of this year in 2020 we should
[1:13:41] be showing some growth by now if you
[1:13:43] feel like your revelation isn't growing
[1:13:45] in the things of God a man you still
[1:13:47] dwelling with what what your mama's
[1:13:49] thinks a minute which daddy thinks a man
[1:13:51] and it's good to follow what your pastor
[1:13:53] thinks I mean but you got to dig into
[1:13:54] the scraps a man and let the Lord show
[1:13:57] you some things he's given us the chance
[1:14:00] to do those things every time you look
[1:14:06] at the faith for Christianity it was
[1:14:08] always about a people a man taking
[1:14:11] something and moving that much further
[1:14:12] with it down the road so what it shows
[1:14:15] you is that the revelation of Christ is
[1:14:17] a progressive revelation the revelation
[1:14:19] of Christ means that you keep growing
[1:14:21] you keep moving don't matter if you're a
[1:14:24] little kid or teenager even with your
[1:14:26] understanding of these things you still
[1:14:28] go forward and keep moving with these
[1:14:31] things Paul wrote the book of Hebrews
[1:14:36] and try to convince those Jews that you
[1:14:39] had a good thing under Judaism but if
[1:14:41] you keep moving forward into these
[1:14:43] things of Christ I got something even
[1:14:45] better for you but I gotta take you even
[1:14:56] the church thought they had some good
[1:14:59] things they've been down through the
[1:15:00] ages and we familiar man named Martin
[1:15:02] Luther he came in to talk about how to
[1:15:03] church to live by faith and you might
[1:15:06] have been a good Catholic anything you
[1:15:08] might have been somebody that really
[1:15:09] believed the things of the church amen
[1:15:10] but it was time to move forward in that
[1:15:12] revelation so when the prophet of God is
[1:15:15] broke it down to this amen then it came
[1:15:17] around in John Wester says it's time to
[1:15:19] clean up your life get
[1:15:21] things in northern just like a Christian
[1:15:24] women act like a Krishna man and the
[1:15:27] church had to move forward Anatomy that
[1:15:30] someone was great Pentecostal fathers
[1:15:32] came in and started talking about this
[1:15:34] Holy Ghost that was moving how God had
[1:15:36] Portia's for the people of God that
[1:15:39] would give you power from your life and
[1:15:40] the church had to take another step that
[1:15:44] God sent a modern-day prophet on the
[1:15:46] scene let us know the church had to take
[1:15:49] another step from man so the Holy Ghost
[1:15:53] not just being Oh something on your
[1:15:54] flesh that make you speak your tongues
[1:15:56] make you jump around a little bit but
[1:15:58] will come in and actually make change
[1:16:00] within your life that will come in and
[1:16:04] actually be an interpreter of the word
[1:16:06] for you man that will allow you to keep
[1:16:10] moving forward amen
[1:16:11] leave those things that are behind and
[1:16:14] press towards the more God has never
[1:16:19] been in the business of leaving his
[1:16:21] people in the same spot the children
[1:16:26] usual they had it all right in Goshen a
[1:16:28] man-eater didn't bother them but so much
[1:16:30] but at the same time there was time for
[1:16:33] them to come out of there and go into a
[1:16:35] promised land what the book of
[1:16:39] Revelation tell us a man says come out
[1:16:41] of her my people don't stay with you and
[1:16:45] move forward I got more light to show
[1:16:48] you
[1:16:48] I got a mindset that I want you to have
[1:16:51] that's different from the world and even
[1:16:54] though you've been walking in a certain
[1:16:56] way long period of time I still want you
[1:16:59] to keep passing tours tomorrow
[1:17:01] [Music]
[1:17:03] never left his people in the same spot
[1:17:05] II never left his people in the same
[1:17:10] spot always wants his people to move
[1:17:12] forward amen he that's my frent Christ
[1:17:14] is a new creature old things are passed
[1:17:17] away all things become new amen he
[1:17:19] always wants his people moving forward
[1:17:28] you know one of the new things that he
[1:17:30] gave the people a book revelation fish
[1:17:32] at David right in that bridge between
[1:17:35] the church ages and seals they meant
[1:17:37] when they find out that there was
[1:17:38] somebody worried that opened a book
[1:17:40] since those twenty-four elders and those
[1:17:42] beasts they started singing a new song a
[1:17:46] new song sure they had a song all
[1:17:50] through the ages and they worship God
[1:17:54] for what he did in their life how you
[1:17:56] stood for them but when they saw the
[1:17:59] land where high he moved that high he
[1:18:02] was an inner cedar when nobody was
[1:18:05] worthy the brother said it caused him to
[1:18:08] sing a new song
[1:18:10] Alleluia go to God well you see what
[1:18:14] Almighty God has done for you and how he
[1:18:16] brought you over how he kept you and
[1:18:19] kept your family and a miss mydas virus
[1:18:22] is moving around chop you it'll give you
[1:18:24] a new sense of the grace of God you know
[1:18:29] I work in health care so I was seeing
[1:18:31] something there was time how when you
[1:18:33] put on your mass and your gloves and
[1:18:35] your gown if you took it off the wrong
[1:18:37] way you could put on a virus within the
[1:18:39] air that could cause you to people we're
[1:18:44] doing all these things to try to make
[1:18:46] sure everybody stays safe and in the
[1:18:47] process you taking those things off you
[1:18:50] could put a virus in there the kitchen
[1:18:52] so what those things are doing to put a
[1:18:54] certain sense of fear somebody put you
[1:18:57] know as soon as that fear starts moving
[1:18:59] to think oh my there's nothing I can do
[1:19:00] then the grace of God comes in and say
[1:19:03] my grace is sufficient for the evening
[1:19:06] hallelujah so what that does that causes
[1:19:09] us to be able to sing a new song before
[1:19:12] God amen
[1:19:13] they had a new revelation they had a new
[1:19:17] experience where they saw somebody
[1:19:20] intercede for them in a way that they
[1:19:22] never expected when they saw somebody
[1:19:25] intercede for them when nobody else
[1:19:28] could intercede for them no matter how
[1:19:30] good they were a man faintly we're all
[1:19:32] through the ages nobody else could do it
[1:19:34] but the Lamb of God and what it did is
[1:19:37] it caused them to change their worship
[1:19:39] it caused them to change their mind City
[1:19:43] cause them to change how they son
[1:19:46] Almighty God as we come out of this
[1:19:50] thing a minute if we knew the musicians
[1:19:52] I hear y'all can come forward amen
[1:19:55] as we come out of this thing what it
[1:19:57] should do is it change our worship
[1:20:00] change our attitude towards one another
[1:20:03] he gave us a second chance to get these
[1:20:06] things right and isn't something that we
[1:20:09] should take light it isn't something we
[1:20:13] could be settled in a bit and God has
[1:20:16] given all of us a sense of our salvation
[1:20:18] it should be establish a man we all
[1:20:20] understand that but even Paul said and
[1:20:23] you know there's still certain things I
[1:20:25] want to be able to apprehend amen
[1:20:27] there's still more things I want to be
[1:20:30] able to grab ahold of because I see it
[1:20:31] as needful but even in the midst of that
[1:20:35] Paul said that I know everything still
[1:20:38] will be alright because something is out
[1:20:40] friendly to me something is holding on
[1:20:44] to me so even though I might never reach
[1:20:46] the ground falls to all things even
[1:20:49] though my story short comes within my
[1:20:51] life you're not still my have things I
[1:20:53] need to move forward

[1:21:20] confusing that could be scary but we're
