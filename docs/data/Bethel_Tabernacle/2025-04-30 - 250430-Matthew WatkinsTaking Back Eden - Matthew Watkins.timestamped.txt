[4:37] they sent that out, but lock your
[4:39] vehicles. Make sure you don't have any
[4:41] valuables that you don't want to lose in
[4:43] there. There's evidently been a string
[4:46] of people running around. And while
[4:48] you're in here worshiping, they're
[4:50] seeing if your car is unlocked and
[4:52] taking whatever they can. So, we'll
[4:55] we'll look, but don't count on the
[4:57] deacons keeping somebody out. Lock your
[4:59] car. Okay. Thank you. Let's pray.
[5:03] Father, I love you this evening. I'm
[5:06] just grateful, Lord, that I can come and
[5:08] worship you in spirit and in truth this
[5:11] evening. And Lord, you said where two or
[5:14] three are gathered, there I am.
[5:17] Lord, I pray that you would help us to
[5:19] realize how close you are to us today.
[5:22] Pray that your presence would just have
[5:24] preeminence in this service. Draw us
[5:26] closer to you, Father. Give us victory
[5:28] over every battle that we have. Our
[5:31] praise and worship you this evening,
[5:33] Father. We pray that you would bless the
[5:35] cheerful giver, Lord. As we collect the
[5:38] tithes and offerings, I pray that you
[5:39] would just multiply them for your
[5:42] kingdom.
[5:43] The gift that stands behind this pulpit
[5:46] this evening, Father, to break the bread
[5:47] of life.
[5:50] I pray that you move the man aside and
[5:52] as I sit back in the back, move me aside
[5:56] that I can receive what you have for us

[18:00] give her a hand.
[18:06] [Music]
[18:24] High upon this mountain,
[18:28] the sun is shining bright.
[18:34] My heart is filled with gladness.
[18:38] appear above the cares of life.
[18:44] But I've just come through the valley
[18:48] of trouble, fear, and pain.
[18:53] It was there I came to know my God
[18:59] enough to stand and say
[19:05] even in the valley.
[19:08] God is good.
[19:12] [Music]
[19:14] Even in the valley,
[19:18] he is faithful
[19:21] and true.
[19:23] He carries
[19:26] his children through
[19:29] like he said he would.
[19:34] Even in the valley,
[19:38] God is good.
[19:41] [Music]
[19:44] This road life has led you
[19:48] to a valley of defeat.
[19:54] You wonder if the father
[19:58] has heard your desperate plea.
[20:02] [Applause]
[20:04] There is hope in that rugged place where
[20:09] tears of sorrow dwell.
[20:13] Can't you hear him gently
[20:17] whispering,
[20:19] "I'm here and all is well.
[20:24] Even
[20:26] in the valley,
[20:30] God is good.
[20:36] Even in the valley,
[20:40] he is faithful
[20:42] and true.
[20:45] He carries
[20:47] his children through
[20:50] like he said he would.
[20:55] And even in the valley,
[20:59] God is good.
[21:02] God is good
[21:05] even in the valley.
[21:10] My God is good
[21:15] even in the valley.
[21:19] He is faithful
[21:22] and true.
[21:24] He carries
[21:26] his children like like he always does.
[21:34] And even in the valley,
[21:38] God is good.
[21:44] Even in the valley,
[21:50] God is good.
[21:54] [Music]
[21:57] [Applause]
[21:58] [Music]
[21:59] [Applause]
[22:02] Amen. How many's ready for the word?
[22:04] Amen. Let us stand.
[22:07] Amen. Just before we sing this last
[22:10] song, I wanted to say I talked to JD.
[22:13] Well, I text JD a little bit um earlier
[22:16] today. So, just keep him in y'all's
[22:19] prayers. I mean, he's going through a
[22:21] lot over there with that sandstorm. He's
[22:23] filling his lungs up. It's pretty dry
[22:25] and pretty difficult to breathe. Amen.
[22:28] So, let's just remember
[22:30] remember him this evening. Amen.
[22:34] Amen.
[22:37] I was sitting there trying to imagine
[22:38] what he would be going through about
[22:41] just so much dust. I've been, you know,
[22:44] using a saw and carpentry and sometime
[22:46] you, you know, have dust build up and
[22:49] it's hard to breathe. I can't imagine
[22:51] not being able to walk away and get from
[22:54] get away from it. You just constantly in
[22:56] your lungs and that's that's pretty
[22:58] difficult uh to be breathing that dust
[23:01] and sand as it stirs up in that desert.
[23:04] He said on like I guess y'all did read
[23:06] the notes saying the windows were down
[23:09] and different things and it was still
[23:11] coming through and I just that's kind of
[23:13] difficult to even imagine. So just keep
[23:16] him in prayer. Amen. Amen. Let's sing a
[23:19] little bit. Here I am to worship as

[28:08] [Music]
[28:09] Amen. Is he worthy tonight? Amen. Praise
[28:13] the Lord. God bless you. Amen. We just
[28:15] want to go straight to the word tonight.
[28:17] If you have your Bibles, have you open
[28:18] those up, turn to the book of Ephesians,
[28:20] chapter 4. Amen. God bless you. So good
[28:23] to be here. Amen. In the house of the
[28:26] Lord again.
[28:28] Amen. We just want to look straight into
[28:30] the word in Ephesians chapter 4. We're
[28:32] just going to read up a verse, a portion
[28:34] of scripture here, and then I'll have
[28:36] you be seated. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[28:47] Ephesians chapter 4. I want to preach to
[28:49] you tonight. And I've just changed the
[28:50] title, brother. Uh, Matthew, you could
[28:52] just do that if you want. Just uh the
[28:54] Lord uh just changed gave me just a
[28:57] little bit different of a um way to
[29:00] express what is upon my heart. And so I
[29:03] just want to title this taking back
[29:06] Eden.
[29:07] Amen.
[29:07] Taking back Eden. I want to read here
[29:11] from Ephesians chapter 4 and let's just
[29:14] begin reading here at verse uh 22
[29:19] that you put off concerning the former
[29:22] conversation the old man. How many
[29:24] believe that as a Christian as a as a
[29:27] believer old things are passed away and
[29:30] all things are become new. How many
[29:32] believe that? And so he says, he relates
[29:35] here, though yet there's still a part of
[29:37] us that he refers to as the old man.
[29:41] Amen. Let's read it again. that you put
[29:43] off concerning the former conversation,
[29:46] the old man, which is corrupt according
[29:50] to the deceitful lusts, and be renewed
[29:54] in the spirit of your mind, and that you
[29:57] put on the new man, which after God is
[30:00] created in righteousness and true
[30:03] holiness. Wherefore putting away lying,
[30:07] speak every man truth with his neighbor.
[30:10] For we are members one of another.
[30:12] Brothers and sisters, let me just say
[30:14] that I believe that if anybody should be
[30:16] able to tell the truth, it should be a
[30:19] Christian.
[30:20] Amen.
[30:21] And how how much that should be
[30:24] something that is an attribute of the
[30:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost that we are
[30:29] truthful people that we are honest
[30:31] people. You know, the world does not you
[30:34] you almost can't. You don't know when
[30:36] people are being honest with you. Don't
[30:38] know when you're being lied to. Amen.
[30:40] But I believe that I just want to say,
[30:41] Lord, let me be an honest person. Amen.
[30:44] Let me be honest in heart and deed in
[30:46] everything that I do. Let's read it
[30:49] again here. Wherefore, putting away
[30:50] lying, speak every man truth with his
[30:53] neighbor, for we are members one of
[30:55] another. Be ye angry and sin not. Let
[31:00] not the sun go down upon your wrath. And
[31:02] I want to draw a context from this verse
[31:04] 27. This is really what's on the center
[31:07] of my heart, neither give place
[31:12] to the devil.
[31:13] Amen.
[31:14] Neither give place
[31:17] to the devil. Let him that stole steal
[31:20] no more, but rather let him labor
[31:23] working with his hands the thing which
[31:26] is good that he may have to give to him
[31:28] that needeth. Let no corrupt
[31:31] communication
[31:33] proceed out of your mouth, but that
[31:36] which is good to the use of edifying,
[31:39] that it may minister grace unto the
[31:42] hearers. and grieve not the Holy Spirit
[31:46] of God, whereby you are sealed unto the
[31:50] day of the next revival? No.
[31:54] Until the day that you mess up, make a
[31:56] mistake, and have to repent.
[31:59] No. Until the day of redemption.
[32:05] Let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[32:09] and clamor and evil speaking be put away
[32:13] from you with all malice. And be you
[32:17] kind one to another, tender-hearted,
[32:21] forgiving one another, that means that
[32:22] we're going to offend each other. If you
[32:24] got to forgive somebody, that means they
[32:26] can offend you. Now, if you got to
[32:27] forgive somebody, that means they could
[32:28] step on your toes.
[32:30] forgiving one another even as God for
[32:34] Christ's sake hath forgiven you Lord we
[32:37] just bow our heads together Lord all in
[32:39] your presence tonight Lord all of us in
[32:42] great need of you Lord for your spirit
[32:45] Lord just to come and do what only you
[32:46] can do your prophet taught us Lord that
[32:49] any man can pick up this Bible and
[32:51] preach from it he could be a hypocrite
[32:54] could be living a double life but even
[32:56] the word preached would be so anointed
[32:59] that it could transform for lives.
[33:01] That's the power of the word of God. So,
[33:04] it's not a vessel, Lord. It's not a
[33:06] preacher that we look to. Thank God for
[33:09] them. But it's only one thing that
[33:11] doesn't fail, and that's the word. We
[33:14] thank you, God. And I pray that we would
[33:15] lift that up. You said, "If I be lifted
[33:17] up, I'll draw all men unto me." I pray
[33:21] God that you would let us give us grace
[33:23] to do that tonight Lord to lift you up
[33:26] Lord and present you in such a way that
[33:29] Father others would be ministered grace
[33:31] unto. I pray that you would Lord grant
[33:34] the desire of the hearts of your
[33:36] children tonight. We ask it in Jesus
[33:38] Christ's name. Amen. You can be seated.
[33:44] I want to just um if you have that the
[33:46] slides here, you could just have those
[33:48] quotes ready. gonna take me just a
[33:50] moment here just to unbburden myself and
[33:53] really pour out the the burden that the
[33:55] Lord has got upon my heart here tonight.
[33:59] I almost titled this sermon reclaiming
[34:01] I'm sorry, a restored Eden or reclaiming
[34:05] Eden. I I titled it to take Eden back.
[34:08] We know that from the the teaching it's
[34:11] uh of the message that Eden, brother
[34:13] Brandham said was something that God had
[34:16] originally in mind for his family, for
[34:18] his sons and his daughters to live in.
[34:21] It's actually the habitat we could say
[34:24] or the environment that God created this
[34:27] part of creation, sons and daughters of
[34:29] God to live in. And I want to just take
[34:31] here just a moment and and just go over
[34:34] a few things that I believe that I've
[34:36] maybe have spoken in in times past, but
[34:39] maybe just to cover them here again.
[34:42] Brother Brandham said that everything
[34:43] happened in Genesis because it was the
[34:45] book of beginnings. And the prophet
[34:47] taught us how that everything that would
[34:49] happen from here on from that point, it
[34:52] would always come back to Genesis. How
[34:55] many know that brother Brandham said
[34:56] Genesis was the seed chapter? Amen.
[34:59] And in that first uh book of the Bible,
[35:02] it would be the seeds of all everything
[35:04] that would happen throughout time and
[35:06] throughout history could all be traced
[35:08] back to this Garden of Eden. God said in
[35:11] Genesis 1:26, and he's speaking about
[35:14] making man in our image and and our
[35:16] likeness. And he speaks to the man and
[35:18] says to let them have dominion. Uh that
[35:21] word dominion or to take rule or to
[35:24] subdue it. And the Bible says he created
[35:27] man in the image of God. And he created
[35:29] them male and female. He created them.
[35:31] He said the Bible says he blessed them
[35:33] and and he said be fruitful and multiply
[35:37] and replenish the earth. And then he
[35:39] uses that word again and subdue it and
[35:43] have dominion. So that word right there
[35:46] is uh so key to God to man to to to not
[35:50] just humankind but to sons of God. We
[35:53] know that there would be all kinds of
[35:55] humankind uh that would serve different
[35:58] purposes for the great potter. But this
[36:00] is what God is talking about to sons of
[36:03] God manifested. H how many believes that
[36:06] God has manifested sons and daughters of
[36:08] God. I'm not just talking about
[36:10] Christians. God has a universal church
[36:13] throughout the whole world that declares
[36:14] his name. But the Bible says that
[36:17] creation is waiting for the
[36:19] manifestation
[36:20] of the sons of God. Amen.
[36:22] And I believe it would be referring back
[36:24] to this condition that Adam had, this
[36:28] perfect Eden. I'm preaching to you
[36:29] tonight on taking back Eden or taking
[36:32] Eden back. And so God uses this word
[36:35] right away. He says, "I want you to take
[36:38] dominion, subdue it, have dominion over
[36:41] the fish and the fowl of the air and
[36:43] every living thing that moveth upon the
[36:46] face of the earth." And so I want you to
[36:48] notice here that God placed man. When I
[36:51] speak of man, I not I'm not using that
[36:53] word as gender, but he's talking about
[36:56] sons and daughters, manifested sons of
[36:59] God. But even more than that, God says,
[37:02] I I want to show you that through man,
[37:04] I'm going to express my vision. I'm
[37:07] going to express my attributes from the
[37:10] very beginning. Man, let me say this in
[37:12] in the way that the Lord gave it to me.
[37:15] A man under the influence of the Holy
[37:19] Ghost in the realm of his soul having
[37:22] the controls and the reigns to that
[37:25] creation is the weapon that God intends
[37:28] to use to destroy the works of the devil
[37:32] in Satan's Eden. I want to say that
[37:34] again that not that a a a true man under
[37:38] the control of the Holy Ghost under the
[37:41] influence of the Holy Ghost in the realm
[37:43] of his soul is the weapon that God uses
[37:48] to take back or to conquer
[37:51] uh Satan in Satan's Eden. We know that
[37:54] this is not God's Eden, but this is
[37:56] Satan Ed Satan's Eden. Brother Brandham
[37:58] told us that that the God Satan was the
[38:01] God of this evil age. And so he uses man
[38:05] that man would be the key or you could
[38:07] say the in from the very beginning uh it
[38:10] would be men uh sons of God, daughters
[38:13] of God under the influence of God in the
[38:16] realm of their soul sold out to God
[38:19] dedicated to God completely under the
[38:22] control of the spirit of the Holy Spirit
[38:25] in their actions in their communications
[38:28] in in their in their in in in every
[38:31] aspect of their life. God wants to have
[38:34] preeminence in his family.
[38:36] Amen.
[38:37] And so, let me say this that a man when
[38:39] he's under the influence, I mean, he's
[38:42] under the control. Not just the
[38:44] influence like you would say to come
[38:46] under an influence to do something, but
[38:49] under that influence, he's under the
[38:52] control of the mind of God. You see, God
[38:55] has a mind. Brother Benham said that God
[38:57] has a mind. He has something he wants
[39:00] done with his word. And the the Paul
[39:03] would say it this way, let this mind
[39:06] which was in Christ Jesus be also in
[39:09] you. And so a man under the control of
[39:12] the Holy Spirit, sold out, dedicated,
[39:14] consecrated to the purpose of God, the
[39:17] prophet of God said it this way, and I
[39:19] could hear him say it. God's only ever
[39:22] wanted one man who he can get under his
[39:26] complete control.
[39:29] He's only ever needed. That's the way
[39:31] brotherham says that he's only ever
[39:33] needed one man under his complete
[39:36] control. Oh, I hear those words and say,
[39:39] "Lord, let me be under your complete
[39:42] control."
[39:44] And he says it's it's and Satan, let me
[39:46] say this, that Satan also knows that. He
[39:49] knows how important it is to get man out
[39:55] of Eden.
[39:56] Amen.
[39:58] He knows how crucial it is for him to
[40:02] accomplish his plan and his purpose. He
[40:06] must remove the man from Eden. You see,
[40:11] Satan has a purpose.
[40:14] The Bible calls him a thief. He comes to
[40:17] steal. Jesus said, kill and destroy.
[40:21] Right?
[40:22] The Bible also uses an a a a word to
[40:26] call the devil. And it calls him the
[40:29] whirlwind. Think about that here just
[40:31] for a moment. The whirlwind. Something
[40:34] that takes all. Something that leaves
[40:37] everything destroyed
[40:39] in its path. Something that comes and
[40:42] this is what the scripture says. And
[40:44] just following the just following the
[40:46] Lord here and and you just pray for me
[40:48] as I express this thought is the way the
[40:50] Lord gave it to me. And I'm just
[40:52] following the Holy Spirit. But the Bible
[40:54] gives the name of of the of the devil
[40:57] many names throughout the Bible. He is
[41:01] here's some of the names of the enemy.
[41:03] The Bible in the book of Malachi 3:1
[41:07] calls the devil the devourer.
[41:11] Amen.
[41:11] You know the scripture that Jesus said
[41:13] he seeks, he's like a roaring. Paul says
[41:15] he's like a roaring lion. He's not a
[41:18] roaring lion cuz he ain't got no roar.
[41:21] But he walks around like a roaring lion
[41:25] seeking whom he may devour. Malachi
[41:28] picks it up and says, "I'll rebuke the
[41:32] devourer for your sake."
[41:34] I think some of us need God to rebuke
[41:37] the devourer out of our life.
[41:40] Amen.
[41:41] Uh, one of the names the Bible we know
[41:43] very much, it probably calls in Genesis
[41:48] 3 originally, but probably is attributed
[41:51] this name more than any name given to
[41:54] the devil, is summed up in this one
[41:56] word, the serpent.
[41:59] And a serpent is one who deceives and
[42:03] poisons with his tongue or his mouth.
[42:07] a serpent. The Bible calls him that old
[42:09] the devil that old serpent or the snake.
[42:12] John spoke of them and said, "You
[42:14] generation of vipers,
[42:17] snakes in the grass." So it would
[42:19] literally attribute the children of the
[42:21] devil by the attributes of their father
[42:24] as a serpent with venom or snakes in the
[42:28] grass. It's called the fowler. And David
[42:31] calls calls the devil uh you know this
[42:34] scripture in Psalms chapter 91 uh you
[42:36] know that the that to keep you from the
[42:39] snare of the fowler. So the devil is
[42:42] also typed as a fowler or a person who
[42:45] catches or what is a fowler? It is a it
[42:47] is a person who catches birds and he
[42:50] uses traps and he uses devices and
[42:53] disguises. And the devil is just like
[42:56] that in our life. He's he's a devourer.
[42:59] wants to take everything from us. Let me
[43:01] just say it to you, my brother, my
[43:02] sister. Satan doesn't have an objective
[43:05] to hurt your feelings or to step on your
[43:08] toes or to even just injure you. The
[43:11] devil wants to devour you and take
[43:15] everything from you that you hold
[43:17] precious and dear in your life.
[43:21] And he he calls him the whirlwind. And
[43:24] the Psalms 91 is the the fowler, the the
[43:26] traps. And he traps those that are
[43:28] unaware and unsuspecting. And Nahm, it
[43:32] refers to him as the whirlwind. You
[43:34] could look up that word as I did today.
[43:36] And it means he's one who loves to bring
[43:39] chaos.
[43:41] Now God, brother Brandham said, is a God
[43:43] of order. He's not the author of
[43:46] confusion. How many know brother
[43:47] Brandham said that God is not the author
[43:50] of confusion. So any confusion in our
[43:53] life can never be attributed to the to
[43:56] to God. We always attribute it to the
[43:59] enemy who wants to bring chaos in our
[44:03] lives. He wants to bring chaos to any
[44:06] order that you have in your home. He
[44:08] wants to bring chaos to any order that
[44:10] you have in your life, in your family,
[44:13] in your relationships, in this church.
[44:16] The devil's objective is to devour, to
[44:19] divide, to spoil, to trap.
[44:23] Amen.
[44:24] And to steal everything that God has
[44:28] deposited in our lives.
[44:31] [Music]
[44:32] He's the He's the whirlwind. He brings
[44:35] chaos. A as you say, uh, my lord is the
[44:40] words of Ahab. I just want to read this
[44:42] as he goes against a a a a king. And
[44:46] just forgive me here for a moment as I
[44:47] as I find my place here, but um
[44:51] I want you to turn to First Kings
[44:53] chapter 18.
[44:55] Turn there if you could just here for a
[44:57] moment.
[45:11] I'm sorry. First Kings chapter 20.
[45:14] I just want to show you something the
[45:15] Lord showed to me and I and I just want
[45:17] to just take just a moment to have you
[45:19] read it with me. I'm waiting so that you
[45:22] can get there. Please do Brother Matt a
[45:24] favor and open your Bible and turn there
[45:27] with your Bible. If you got to use that
[45:29] phone, that's all right. You go ahead
[45:31] and use it. You got my permission. But I
[45:33] want you to read it with me. I know we
[45:35] got it on the screen, but I just want
[45:37] you to read these words. First Kings
[45:39] chapter 20.
[45:42] And Ben Haydad, this is his name. This
[45:44] is the king. Benhad, the king of Syria,
[45:48] gathered all his hosts together. There
[45:50] were 32 kings with him, horses and
[45:52] chariots. He went up and besieged
[45:54] Samaria and war against it. He sent
[45:56] messengers to Ahab, king of Israel, into
[45:59] the city, and said unto him, "Thus saith
[46:01] Benhad." Now, Ben Haydad's name, his
[46:04] dad's name, you can read that name, Ben
[46:06] Hayad. and and and Haydad was his father
[46:11] and his name literally means the
[46:15] whirlwind.
[46:17] And so now you have the son of the
[46:19] whirlwind and his name means the
[46:22] reincarnation
[46:23] of the whirlwind. And so now bin Hadad
[46:27] comes to Ahab. We know Ahab. We know the
[46:30] story of Ahab. not preaching on that
[46:31] here today, but I just want to draw
[46:33] something from here because here was the
[46:35] enemy, the whirlwind. And he and he and
[46:38] here was the son of the whirlwind coming
[46:40] to Ahab. And notice what his threat was.
[46:43] He said unto him, he sent messengers in
[46:45] verse two, thus saith Manhad, thy silver
[46:49] and thy gold is mine. Look at that word,
[46:53] mine. Mine. Where do you learn that from
[46:56] a child? Even a child says that's mine.
[46:59] It's a way to take possession. It's
[47:01] mine. Mine. Not yours. Mine. This is the
[47:04] word that the devil or Benhad was using
[47:08] to to let Ahab know, your silver, your
[47:12] gold, your wives, notice this, your
[47:14] children are mine.
[47:18] Even the goodliest are mine. Verse four.
[47:22] And the king of Israel answered, I want
[47:24] you to notice this answer to the
[47:26] whirlwind by Ahab. And the king of
[47:29] Israel answered and said, "My Lord, oh
[47:33] king,
[47:34] according to thy saying."
[47:39] Let me give you a modern day translation
[47:43] of that. Whatever you say.
[47:46] Think about that here. The devil, the
[47:50] whirlwind has came and he got to such a
[47:53] place. He got to such a downcast,
[47:57] defeated, downtrodden
[47:59] place to where the enemy is saying, "I'm
[48:02] going to take your wife. I'm going to
[48:04] take your children. I'm going to take
[48:07] your home. I'm going to take even the
[48:09] goodliest." In other words, those things
[48:11] that you love
[48:13] and I they're mine. I'm going to take
[48:15] them. And here was the here was all of
[48:17] the all of the can I say it this way?
[48:20] Here was all of the gumption
[48:23] that Ahab can muster up. Here was all of
[48:25] the courage that he can muster up.
[48:29] Whatever you say, man.
[48:31] Come on.
[48:32] Whatever you say.
[48:36] As you say, I am thine and all
[48:41] that I have.
[48:44] messengers came again and said, "Thus
[48:46] speaketh bin Haydad, saying,"Now notice
[48:48] here, I want you to notice the devil. I
[48:50] want to show you something about the
[48:52] devil." Here the devil has made a threat
[48:54] and said, "Everything I'm going to take
[48:55] is mine." And now he's waiting for the
[48:57] answer from the king. And the king says,
[49:00] "Whatever you say." Now, you'd think
[49:02] that that wicked man would say, "All
[49:04] right, guys. We got him. Let's let's be
[49:05] let's be diplomatic about this. Come on.
[49:08] We got him. We got our foot in the door.
[49:09] Now, I want to show you how bold the
[49:11] devil is." The messengers came again and
[49:14] said, "Thus speaketh Ben hey had saying,
[49:17] Although I sent unto thee, saying, Thou
[49:18] shalt deliver me thy soul, and the thy
[49:20] silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and
[49:22] thy children, yet I'll send my servants
[49:25] unto thee tomorrow about this time, and
[49:26] they shall search your house, and the
[49:29] house of thy servants, and it shall be
[49:31] that whatsoever is pleasant in your
[49:34] eyes,
[49:36] they shall put it in their hand and take
[49:39] it away."
[49:41] You see, when you give the devil a
[49:44] place,
[49:46] he's not just there to take that place.
[49:48] He's there to take everything.
[49:51] Amen.
[49:53] And he says here, "And anything
[49:57] whatsoever is pleasant in your eyes,
[50:01] they shall put it in their hand and take
[50:04] it away." Let me just say something to
[50:07] you friends. If you let the devil, he
[50:10] will rob you.
[50:12] And he won't just take what? He won't
[50:14] just take, listen friends, he's going to
[50:16] take everything that you have. If you
[50:18] let the devil and give him place in your
[50:21] life, he's not just there to take a
[50:22] little spot and and stick out his tongue
[50:25] at you. He wants your children. He wants
[50:27] your home. He wants your health. He
[50:29] wants your marriage. Come on, somebody.
[50:32] He wants this church.
[50:34] Brother Bam said that in God's power to
[50:36] transform, preach into a little trailer,
[50:38] little home church. And he says,
[50:39] "Brothers, don't that little sweet
[50:41] spirit you have in here. It's so kind
[50:43] and everybody loves." Don't you think
[50:45] for one moment the devil will let it
[50:48] stay that way, but he'll let some little
[50:50] sly slick, you know, person uh, you
[50:53] know, come with the Bible in their hands
[50:55] and preach the gospel because he wants
[50:57] to take what you got away. Listen,
[51:00] friends, the devil never comes through
[51:02] the front door. He never comes as a
[51:04] woof. He never comes saying, "Hey, it's
[51:06] me. It's the enemy." He comes subtly
[51:08] like a snake's lie, slithering his way
[51:12] through your life and through your home
[51:14] trying to find a place.
[51:19] Can I just preach and say, "Give no
[51:21] place
[51:22] to the devil."
[51:26] Notice this. this this he says
[51:28] everything that you have whatsoever is
[51:32] pleasant in other words anything you
[51:35] enjoy your health you like that I'll
[51:38] take it from you
[51:40] you like sitting out on the porch of a
[51:42] morning and and you know and drinking
[51:44] your coffee and you like those listen
[51:45] this is what the devil's after he's
[51:47] after anything that gives you joy in
[51:51] this world
[51:54] and I want to stop here for a moment and
[51:56] say he's like a serpent. He'll come in
[51:59] slick. He'll come in cunning. It's what
[52:02] the Bible says about him. He's cunning.
[52:05] Brother Brandham said that. I was
[52:06] listening to it today in God's power to
[52:07] transform. He comes in like a preacher.
[52:10] He says y'all all the right words. Says
[52:13] all the right things, smooth sayings,
[52:16] and you give a play. You give a place to
[52:19] the devil. And before you know it, he's
[52:21] demanding what you have. He's demanding
[52:24] all that you love. He's demanding all of
[52:26] your children. He's demanding all of
[52:29] your time. He's demanding all of your
[52:31] body.
[52:33] Amen. Come on.
[52:35] Amen.
[52:35] And if you let him, he'll take it all.
[52:38] That's right.
[52:39] He'll take it all.
[52:42] Ben Hay had this is what the devil calls
[52:44] him. He's the the whirlwind. He's the
[52:47] spoiler. John 10, I think it is John 10.
[52:50] He says, "The thief comes to steal, to
[52:54] kill,
[52:56] and to destroy, to steal joy, to steal
[53:00] peace, to destroy unity."
[53:06] And this is what God promised us as
[53:08] children, sons, and daughters of God. I
[53:10] just want to insert this in here right
[53:12] now.
[53:13] God has promised to the family of God
[53:17] that you don't have to settle with
[53:20] chaos. You don't have to settle with
[53:23] disruption. You don't have to settle
[53:25] with uncertainty in your life. But God
[53:29] promised us peace that passes
[53:32] understanding, joy in our lives, harmony
[53:35] in our homes, unity and love in our
[53:38] church.
[53:40] That's the promise of Eden. That's the
[53:43] promise of God. But the intruder comes
[53:46] in to take what isn't his. We know that
[53:50] that that Adam lived with this as I get
[53:52] back to this just here for a moment that
[53:54] that that God said because Satan knew
[53:57] this. Man was the architecture. He was
[54:00] the the the blueprint that God would
[54:02] use. He's the foundation.
[54:05] Amen.
[54:06] The man in his rightful place.
[54:10] the man in his rightful position
[54:16] under the submission and the authority
[54:20] of the Holy Ghost
[54:22] in his life.
[54:23] I'm not talking about a man with pride
[54:26] filled with chauvinism
[54:30] maybe muscle bound. Nothing wrong with
[54:32] muscles, but some men can be muscle
[54:34] bound. And brother Bandam said ain't got
[54:36] 10 oouncez of man inside of him.
[54:38] Amen.
[54:39] Amen. Amen.
[54:40] Brother Brandham said, "But I'm talking
[54:42] about men, real men, men who stand for a
[54:46] principle."
[54:47] Men who knows their position, their
[54:49] submission to Christ.
[54:51] Amen.
[54:52] Love how brother Harold Beckett would
[54:55] point that out many, many, many years
[54:57] ago. I remember being at Brother Blues
[54:59] Church and like 18 years old or so and
[55:01] hearing Brother Beckett say that to to
[55:03] to receive authority, you've got to come
[55:06] under authority. Yes.
[55:09] And he says, "Brother, brother Brandham
[55:10] showed us." And he said he'd stand there
[55:12] in 20th century prophet. You could see
[55:14] it on the video. And brother Brandham,
[55:16] Brother Becket says, "You see brother
[55:17] Brandham and he's sort of, you know,
[55:19] fumbling over his words and his ringing
[55:21] his with his hand. You can see him on
[55:23] the video is nervous and he's not out
[55:25] there boisterous and prideful with a big
[55:27] loud voice and and you know, and and a
[55:29] great big demonstrative." No, brother
[55:31] Brandham was a very humble s you know a
[55:35] man and a very soft demeanor
[55:39] and and he said you could watch Brother
[55:41] Brandham there on that on that video as
[55:44] he stood there and he's sort of
[55:45] fumbling. He said brother brother Beck
[55:47] said see what he was doing. He wasn't
[55:49] trying to come out there on on on his
[55:51] own authority or his reputation or his
[55:53] past revival, but he was coming under
[55:57] authority. And he said then he would
[55:58] sheepishly very very you know nervously
[56:01] say now uh friends I'm just as helpless
[56:05] as a baby unless he comes.
[56:09] I'm just as helpless as a baby. And and
[56:11] and unless he comes, you know, friends,
[56:14] I I can't do anything to help you. And
[56:16] and brother Becca said, "See what you
[56:18] were seeing is the power of authority
[56:21] first. You must first come under
[56:23] authority under headship for authority
[56:26] to come to you." And brother Brandham
[56:28] said, "Brother Becca said, you could
[56:30] watch Brother Brandham. I'm as helpless
[56:31] as a baby and unless he comes, I just
[56:34] can't do anything to help." Listen,
[56:35] friends, he didn't come there with an
[56:37] arrogancy. There was no attitude. There
[56:39] was no overall confidence.
[56:43] Listen, can I just preach to you here
[56:44] for a moment? There was no
[56:46] overconfidence in God's prophet. He
[56:48] wasn't so confident in himself or even
[56:50] in his own gift, even in his own
[56:52] ability, but he stood there with
[56:54] humility. Not something that he put on,
[56:57] something that was fake, you know,
[56:58] holding his head a certain way. And you
[57:00] know that's not humility. But real
[57:03] humility is knowing how how far grace
[57:07] had to reach down in your own life to
[57:10] save you and how much grace it took to
[57:13] pick you up out of the miry clay. And
[57:15] that person can show grace to anybody
[57:18] else.
[57:19] Amen.
[57:20] I believe we should we should rule from
[57:23] a position of humility. Amen. Amen.
[57:26] Rule from the position of the cross of
[57:29] the crucified Lord who said, "Father,
[57:32] forgive them for they know not what they
[57:34] do.
[57:35] Come off of that cross." That's what
[57:38] they said to him. He said, "If I can't
[57:40] if I come off of the cross, I can't save
[57:42] them." And let me just say this to you
[57:44] men of God here today. Stay on the
[57:47] cross.
[57:48] Stay on the cross. Stay under a life of
[57:51] self- crucifixion, humility before God.
[57:55] Remember that without God, we are
[57:57] nothing.
[57:59] That's right.
[58:00] Cuz the only way you can save them is if
[58:02] you stay on the cross.
[58:06] And brother Beckham said, "Watch Brother
[58:08] Brandham as he stood there. Now I'm as
[58:10] helpless as a baby unless he comes." And
[58:12] he says, "Now you watched." And he says,
[58:14] "But suddenly something happened." And
[58:16] you watch Brother Brandham's hold the
[58:18] meter when the Holy Spirit comes in the
[58:20] room and he says, "Brother Brands,
[58:21] Danny's down like this. I'm just as
[58:22] helpless." And suddenly he goes, "He's
[58:25] here."
[58:25] Yeah.
[58:26] Amen.
[58:27] Amen.
[58:28] And I take every spirit in this room
[58:32] under my control
[58:34] for the glory of God.
[58:36] What was it? He came under authority and
[58:39] so God gave him authority.
[58:42] Ain't that good? That's right. Amen.
[58:44] So man is under under in his right
[58:48] position.
[58:50] He's the controller. He under under the
[58:53] right position.
[58:55] He's the foundation for the rest of the
[58:58] family. We taught that the man is the
[59:00] head of the home. And that's a
[59:01] scriptural teaching. He's head of the
[59:03] home. But many times when we envision
[59:06] that head of the home, we envision being
[59:09] on top of the family. But I'm going to
[59:12] correct that image for you tonight. The
[59:13] man doesn't lead from up here. He leads
[59:16] from down here.
[59:19] Because he's not on the top of the
[59:21] family. He's at the bottom. You see, the
[59:23] foundation of the home is what carries
[59:26] the load of the rest of the house.
[59:29] Amen. Amen.
[59:32] And so when God creates the human
[59:35] family, he was building or constructing
[59:37] an image of how he's seen a reflection
[59:40] of his own house and in his own mind.
[59:43] That's why the Bible says that he took
[59:46] of himself, made of himself uh no
[59:48] reputation,
[59:50] took on the form of a servant.
[59:54] You want to know how to lead your home?
[59:56] This is hell. Lead it the way that the
[59:58] original man of God, creation of God,
[1:00:00] the son of God. The Bible says Jesus
[1:00:03] said, "Come not the son of man to be
[1:00:06] served, but to serve."
[1:00:11] And so, so God when he constructs the
[1:00:14] first home, the first house, the first
[1:00:17] building, he constructs it the way he
[1:00:20] wants every building to be built.
[1:00:22] Amen.
[1:00:23] A reflection of his own. And so when he
[1:00:25] begins his construction, he starts with
[1:00:29] the man.
[1:00:30] Amen.
[1:00:32] And he puts that man at the foundational
[1:00:36] role because God knew if I can get the
[1:00:40] man right, then everything in the home
[1:00:44] will be right. But the devil knows if he
[1:00:48] could corrupt the man, then the
[1:00:51] children, the wife, the family stands
[1:00:54] very little chance.
[1:00:59] And so he says, I want you to take
[1:01:01] dominion. I want you to take authority.
[1:01:05] I want you to take your domain. I've
[1:01:07] called you. I've gifted you. I've put a
[1:01:10] I've put a gift inside of you to lead.
[1:01:13] That's in every single man. I don't care
[1:01:15] how old you are, if you're married or
[1:01:17] single. There is a gift inside of you
[1:01:20] that God called you to lead.
[1:01:23] To to to lead. You may not ever be a
[1:01:25] leader of a church. You may not ever be
[1:01:27] the leader of a business. I'm not saying
[1:01:28] that's the calling of every man. Thank
[1:01:31] God God made some men good employees.
[1:01:34] And you business owners said, "Amen."
[1:01:38] Because not all men were called for that
[1:01:40] position. You need them. Amen.
[1:01:42] But but let me just say that within
[1:01:43] every son of daughter of God, God has
[1:01:46] put something inside of you to not be an
[1:01:49] Ahab and let the devil control the
[1:01:52] narrative. Not be an Ahab and say all
[1:01:54] that you want. Say whatever you say. But
[1:01:56] let me just say this. I do not intend to
[1:01:58] let the devil have control over my
[1:02:01] family or my life. He's not going to get
[1:02:03] the final say. If anything, I'll let the
[1:02:06] Lord Jesus speak through my life and
[1:02:09] say, "Satan, you ain't going to have my
[1:02:11] home. You ain't going to have my family.
[1:02:13] You ain't going to have my children." Do
[1:02:15] I have anybody here tonight to say, "I
[1:02:17] am not going to let hell call the shots
[1:02:20] in my life. I'm going to speak out
[1:02:22] against that spirit trying to intrude
[1:02:25] into my home."
[1:02:27] Amen.
[1:02:28] He's the protector of the home.
[1:02:31] He stands at the gate. He stands at the
[1:02:34] door ready to lay his life down for his
[1:02:37] family. That is an attribute of your
[1:02:41] heavenly father.
[1:02:42] Amen.
[1:02:42] No greater love,
[1:02:45] no greater love
[1:02:48] hath the world seen
[1:02:51] that a man would lay down his life.
[1:02:56] Think about that. that the role that God
[1:02:59] put inside of every son of God,
[1:03:02] amen,
[1:03:03] is a role of self sacrifice.
[1:03:08] That's right.
[1:03:09] You know who knows nothing about
[1:03:11] self-sacrifice? The devil.
[1:03:15] Amen.
[1:03:16] That's why he couldn't recognize the
[1:03:18] deity of Jesus. Because he came with
[1:03:22] such humility
[1:03:24] and self-sacrifice
[1:03:27] that literally he hid in plain sight.
[1:03:31] Amen.
[1:03:32] Amen.
[1:03:32] Because the devil would have never
[1:03:35] expected God to become like one of us.
[1:03:41] The Bible says this in Galatians 5. I'm
[1:03:44] just going to preach this here and then
[1:03:45] turn a corner. This I say you then, walk
[1:03:48] in the spirit.
[1:03:51] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[1:03:53] the flesh. You want to know how to not
[1:03:55] fall to sin? Walk in the spirit.
[1:04:00] For the flesh lusteth against the
[1:04:02] spirit, and the spirit against the
[1:04:03] flesh, and these are contrary, the one
[1:04:08] to the other, so that you cannot do the
[1:04:11] things that you want to do. So, let me
[1:04:14] just say this here. God originally put
[1:04:17] man in this position. Garden of Eden was
[1:04:20] not, as we said, I know it was a
[1:04:22] physical location. It was a real place,
[1:04:24] believe somewhere, I think, to be in
[1:04:26] Egypt. And you can find some things that
[1:04:28] Brother Brandham said about that. But,
[1:04:31] but let me just say this to you tonight
[1:04:33] that it wasn't so much about let me read
[1:04:37] you what a prophet said. I just love
[1:04:39] this so much. Just want to read it. Can
[1:04:40] you just listen here for a moment? I
[1:04:42] don't have this. Brother Brandham says
[1:04:44] this and I want to He says, "In the new
[1:04:46] earth and new heavens, it'll never be
[1:04:49] blackened again. When this new earth is
[1:04:50] to come, the devil will be bound. Satan,
[1:04:53] he's loose now. He's the accuser. But in
[1:04:56] the new earth, he will be bound and cast
[1:04:58] into the lake of fire in this holy fire.
[1:05:01] Then in this new earth, let's look at it
[1:05:02] for a few moments. In this new earth,
[1:05:04] the skies will never be dark again,
[1:05:05] never be black again." No, that's from
[1:05:07] the curse. You know that there's so many
[1:05:10] things that we live in today by contrast
[1:05:13] that are the law of curse we live in it.
[1:05:16] Death and hospitals and sickness. It's
[1:05:18] all part of the curse that the earth is
[1:05:20] under.
[1:05:21] Brother have said even thorns in the
[1:05:24] desert cactus was a sign of the curse.
[1:05:28] Amen.
[1:05:28] And a sign that the curse has lifted is
[1:05:30] when the cactus blooms and those those,
[1:05:33] as brother Brandon points out, those
[1:05:35] thorns are just a leaf that's been so
[1:05:37] dried up and ain't got no water. Says,
[1:05:39] "But one day the desert will blossom."
[1:05:42] Right?
[1:05:43] And he says, "Notice, the skies will
[1:05:45] never be black. Never with angry clouds.
[1:05:48] Winds will never blow across her again.
[1:05:51] She'll never tear up the trees and tear
[1:05:54] up the houses." speaking of tornadoes
[1:05:55] and turn over the things lightning and
[1:05:58] the wrath will never belch from Satan
[1:06:00] across there and kill a man walking down
[1:06:03] the road or burn up a building. See, no,
[1:06:06] no more. There will be no more typhoons,
[1:06:08] hurricanes, sweep down storms and
[1:06:10] tornadoes, tear up houses, kill little
[1:06:12] children and things. Uh-uh. Won't be no
[1:06:15] more.
[1:06:16] Trying to destroy it won't be there.
[1:06:20] Satan is cast out.
[1:06:23] Amen. Brother Brandham says, "Heaven and
[1:06:26] earth have met God and man." Oh, as he
[1:06:31] begins to portray this, I just envision,
[1:06:34] friends, it's it's beyond our wildest
[1:06:36] imagination.
[1:06:38] Amen.
[1:06:40] Heavens and earth have met. God and man
[1:06:43] is reconciled.
[1:06:46] A restored Eden has begun.
[1:06:50] And all the curse is gone.
[1:06:54] the curse of sin. Just like it when God,
[1:06:57] the Holy Ghost accepts you. See, you
[1:06:59] don't accept God. The Holy Ghost accepts
[1:07:01] you.
[1:07:02] The Holy Ghost is God's attribute,
[1:07:04] right?
[1:07:06] It's the attribute, the thought of God.
[1:07:09] See, you were born in sin, but God had
[1:07:11] that attribute. And here you expressed
[1:07:13] yourself on earth, and it comes down and
[1:07:15] gets you. You're back here. Here is
[1:07:17] where you belong. See, sin has lost its
[1:07:21] power. That's right. The desire of sin
[1:07:25] has done gone from your heart when the
[1:07:27] Holy Spirit comes in. Listen to this.
[1:07:29] When the Holy Spirit comes in, you're a
[1:07:33] restored person.
[1:07:37] When the earth is restored by the same
[1:07:39] thing, there could be no more cursing,
[1:07:41] no more storms, no more winds, no more
[1:07:45] typhoons. You are reconciled. Man and
[1:07:48] God has met. The new earth will be put
[1:07:50] on its Eden beauty again. The new earth
[1:07:54] will spread forth after her baptism of
[1:07:57] fire. Just think about it. She'll catch
[1:08:00] a fire. All the elements will melt with
[1:08:02] fervent heat. All the works of the earth
[1:08:06] will be burned up. The water will
[1:08:08] explode. It'll ignite. And brother says
[1:08:10] and blow everything up. Everything.
[1:08:12] Volcanoes will erupt thousands of miles
[1:08:14] in the air with burning hot lava. Every
[1:08:17] germ. The Holy Spirit of God will
[1:08:18] cleanse off every speck of all the sin
[1:08:21] and everything. All the devil will be
[1:08:24] bound and cast into the lake of fire,
[1:08:27] consuming fire. God's fire of wrath. No
[1:08:30] beast will be there to destroy you when
[1:08:32] you walk down the road in the flower
[1:08:34] garden. There will be no serpent there
[1:08:36] to hiss at you and bite you with his
[1:08:38] poisonous venom. Oh my, won't that be
[1:08:40] wonderful? There will be none of that in
[1:08:42] the new earth ever mounted up to a
[1:08:44] little yellow sodbank for a grave. There
[1:08:47] will be none of that. Man and God has
[1:08:49] come together. Bride and bridegroom.
[1:08:51] Heavens and earth has embraced each
[1:08:53] other. God has come down to dwell among
[1:08:55] men. His tabernacle is with them. Oh, my
[1:08:58] brother, my sister, that may mean
[1:09:00] nothing. What I just read may mean
[1:09:02] nothing to the the guy down the street,
[1:09:04] but it means so much to me. I I just
[1:09:08] want to ask you, does it mean anything
[1:09:09] to you? Why Why would it mean something
[1:09:12] to you? Because an Eden, a restored Eden
[1:09:14] has begun. Amen.
[1:09:17] And one day all sin out of my mortal
[1:09:20] body, out of my mind, out of my spirit
[1:09:23] will be eradicated. There will be no
[1:09:25] more curse of sin.
[1:09:29] There will be no more sorrow. Brother
[1:09:30] Adam says, "Oh, bride and bridegroom,
[1:09:33] heavens and earth have embraced. God has
[1:09:35] come down to dwell his tabernacles with
[1:09:36] them. There'll be no more sin. No more
[1:09:38] sorrow. Never. Never will there be a
[1:09:40] tear drop off of a mother's cheek over
[1:09:42] her baby. It won't be on that new
[1:09:43] ground. It's redeemed. It belongs to him
[1:09:45] and that's what it was redeemed out of.
[1:09:49] He's redeemed you. You're like that old
[1:09:51] garment. You're part of that ground.
[1:09:53] When he redeemed you, he redeemed the
[1:09:55] earth with the same thing. You are
[1:09:56] together again. How much planer can it
[1:09:59] be? You have to be redeemed cuz you're
[1:10:01] part of the earth. That's what he's
[1:10:03] saying. And if the blood didn't drop on
[1:10:05] you, if the blood didn't drop on you,
[1:10:08] you ain't redeemed yet. You're not
[1:10:10] called. Then he cleanses it. That's the
[1:10:13] same thing he does in the fire. The
[1:10:15] blood dropped and yet it's got to be
[1:10:17] cleansed by fire for a dwelling place of
[1:10:20] God. God already took up his abode
[1:10:22] potentially. The kingdom of God is in
[1:10:25] the earth now in the heart of his
[1:10:27] saints. And it it's his attributes that
[1:10:30] begin at the beginning. I love this so
[1:10:32] much. Now his attributes is redeemed.
[1:10:34] What's he waiting for? To redeem the
[1:10:37] earth. To set his attributes on it. to
[1:10:40] fill exactly his predestinated plan. Do
[1:10:42] you see it? No more tears, no more
[1:10:45] graves, no more bloodshed. She'll never
[1:10:48] be moistened by a teardrop of blood.
[1:10:51] There will be no more war, no clouds of
[1:10:53] winter, no cold snow, thank God, up in
[1:10:55] the breast of her. Won't lay there no
[1:10:57] more on it. The hot sun will not never
[1:11:00] burn its grass. Hallelujah. Even the
[1:11:03] desert shall bring forth roses. That old
[1:11:06] sticky desert will blossom one day like
[1:11:08] a rose. Don't you see what brother
[1:11:10] Brandham is typing? Listen, it's a
[1:11:12] wonderful thing to think about the earth
[1:11:14] and the curse that the earth is under.
[1:11:16] But I got news from you. You that are
[1:11:18] sealed, born again with the baptism of
[1:11:20] the Holy Ghost. There's still a curse
[1:11:22] upon your earth. Oh, there's still
[1:11:24] stickers and you got a sticky nature.
[1:11:26] Brother Random said it'll bother you as
[1:11:28] long as you live. That old carnal sticky
[1:11:31] flesh. You You'll make mistakes. You'll
[1:11:33] mess up sometimes. You'll get angry
[1:11:35] sometimes. Oh, but one day the curse
[1:11:37] will be lifted. One day there will be no
[1:11:40] more malice, no more envy, no more
[1:11:42] jealousy, no more mistake. I won't think
[1:11:44] the wrong thought. I won't speak the
[1:11:46] wrong thought. I won't look at the wrong
[1:11:48] thing. All the curse of sin has been
[1:11:51] lifted. But can I just say that Eden has
[1:11:54] begun and I'm not about to wait until I
[1:11:57] get there on the other side. I believe I
[1:12:00] can experience a restored Eden in my
[1:12:03] home, in my family, in this church. Oh,
[1:12:06] how many want that here tonight?
[1:12:08] God, let me taste of that place. That
[1:12:11] perfect Eden,
[1:12:14] that perfect Eden,
[1:12:17] that atmosphere that I was made
[1:12:20] to dwell in.
[1:12:21] Amen.
[1:12:23] That I was made to live in that
[1:12:25] atmosphere. Wasn't made out to be out
[1:12:28] there.
[1:12:30] The Bible says God took the man. Notice
[1:12:32] this, Genesis 2. He took the man that he
[1:12:35] had made. And the Bible says it this
[1:12:37] way. And put him
[1:12:40] put him
[1:12:42] in the garden of Eden
[1:12:45] to tend it and to keep it.
[1:12:50] So you mean when you're in the Garden of
[1:12:53] Eden filled with the Holy Ghost, you've
[1:12:57] got to tend it. You got to keep it.
[1:13:00] Yes. Amen.
[1:13:01] You got to till the soil.
[1:13:03] That's right. You got to pull the weeds.
[1:13:06] Oh yeah.
[1:13:07] Hello, somebody.
[1:13:10] God says, "I'm going to place you there
[1:13:12] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'm
[1:13:15] going to give you a token, Rahab. I'm
[1:13:18] going to give you something that so
[1:13:20] seals you. It'll seal you to the day of
[1:13:23] your redemption.
[1:13:26] But this atmosphere that I'm placing you
[1:13:28] in, this place that I'm putting you in,
[1:13:31] I want you to know you're to subdue.
[1:13:33] You're to conquer.
[1:13:35] Yes.
[1:13:35] Amen.
[1:13:37] You see, Eden was not just a place, as
[1:13:39] we said, but it was, we could type it to
[1:13:43] say it was the environment. I love this.
[1:13:46] It was the environment
[1:13:49] that a son of God, a daughter of God was
[1:13:53] made to thrive in.
[1:13:55] Amen.
[1:13:56] It's made to be what God made you to be.
[1:13:59] Amen.
[1:14:00] To look how God seen you before you ever
[1:14:03] breathed your first breath.
[1:14:06] And so Eden was the environment that God
[1:14:10] put man inside. Anytime God ever created
[1:14:14] anything, you go read the book of
[1:14:15] Genesis. God would always create the
[1:14:19] environment first before he placed the
[1:14:23] creation in the environment. Think of
[1:14:25] the fish first. He creates the seas,
[1:14:29] then he brings the fish.
[1:14:31] You see, the environment was going to be
[1:14:33] so important to the fish that without
[1:14:36] the environment, the fish could not
[1:14:38] live.
[1:14:40] And so God says, "I'm going to create.
[1:14:43] I'm going to put emphasis. I want to
[1:14:45] tell you how important it is for the
[1:14:48] fish to live in its environment that
[1:14:50] actually it can't live without it."
[1:14:53] Amen.
[1:14:54] And I'm going to not create the fish
[1:14:56] first. I'm first going to create the Oh,
[1:15:00] I'm first going to create the ability,
[1:15:03] the place for him to dwell so that he
[1:15:05] could be a fish. Let me say it to you
[1:15:08] this way. The fish was not created for
[1:15:11] the water,
[1:15:12] but the water was created for the fish.
[1:15:17] What did he make before he ever made a
[1:15:19] star? He first hung the firmament
[1:15:22] because in order for the star to be a
[1:15:24] star,
[1:15:26] he had to have a firmament to live in,
[1:15:28] an atmosphere to dwell in before he ever
[1:15:31] created the flower, he first made the
[1:15:33] soil
[1:15:34] for the flower to live in. But what
[1:15:37] happens when you remove the flower from
[1:15:41] the soil?
[1:15:44] What happens when you take him out of
[1:15:46] where God put him?
[1:15:49] You put him in a vase, sister. You get
[1:15:51] you those flowers and oh, they're so
[1:15:53] beautiful and you put him in that glass
[1:15:55] vase and you fill it with water and you
[1:15:57] put it in the window and it has all the
[1:15:59] sun.
[1:16:01] But you know what? Yeah.
[1:16:03] If it's not in its original in its
[1:16:06] original intended environment, it'll
[1:16:10] live for a day, 2 days, 3 days, but
[1:16:14] don't you know it, after a while, those
[1:16:16] petals will start to fall.
[1:16:18] Amen.
[1:16:19] That flower will begin to turn over.
[1:16:22] What is it? It wasn't made to live
[1:16:25] outside of its environment.
[1:16:28] Amen.
[1:16:30] What happens to the star when you take
[1:16:32] the star out of the firmament? It
[1:16:35] becomes a falling star, a comet,
[1:16:39] and it can do nothing but destroy.
[1:16:44] What happens when you take that fish,
[1:16:46] brother, and you caught him on the line
[1:16:48] and man, you take him up out on he's got
[1:16:50] the hook in his mouth. You throw him in
[1:16:52] the boat and you're taking pictures with
[1:16:53] him and taking snapping photos and
[1:16:56] posting on your, you know, your social
[1:16:58] media. Look at this coding way out there
[1:17:00] to make it look a little bit bigger than
[1:17:01] it actually was.
[1:17:04] And they got to say, "Hurry, hurry,
[1:17:05] hurry, hurry. Get him back in the water.
[1:17:07] Get him back in the water." Why do you
[1:17:08] have to do that? Why can't he still go
[1:17:09] on a boat ride with you? He can't. You
[1:17:11] got to slowly let him back in. Put him
[1:17:14] back in his environment. Why? He wasn't
[1:17:16] made to live in your environment.
[1:17:20] Amen.
[1:17:21] So what happens when you take a man,
[1:17:25] a son of God, a daughter of God, and you
[1:17:29] remove them from Eden?
[1:17:31] Yeah.
[1:17:33] That same man that was the key to be the
[1:17:38] weapon to destroy Satan's Eden now
[1:17:40] becomes a destroyer.
[1:17:43] Amen.
[1:17:44] Now he becomes
[1:17:47] a person who can do nothing but mess
[1:17:50] things up
[1:17:52] and break things
[1:17:54] and hurt people.
[1:17:57] That same man when you remove him from
[1:18:00] Eden, what was Eden? It was the
[1:18:02] environment. It was the atmosphere for
[1:18:05] the man to dwell in. But something
[1:18:08] removed him from the intended
[1:18:11] environment. Sin came in the garden.
[1:18:14] Amen.
[1:18:14] A snake entered the Eden.
[1:18:18] Can I preach to you here for a moment?
[1:18:21] Amen.
[1:18:22] Amen.
[1:18:23] The intruder, the devourer, the serpent,
[1:18:25] the fowler, the whirlwind, the spoiler,
[1:18:29] the thief,
[1:18:31] the liar, the accuser,
[1:18:34] Abaden, the Bible calls him.
[1:18:38] He comes in this the garden that God
[1:18:41] intended to be beautiful, that God
[1:18:44] intended to be an atmosphere for the
[1:18:45] Holy Spirit to be welcome.
[1:18:48] And now that subtle, sly, slick snake
[1:18:54] comes in with his venomous bite and
[1:18:57] slips into the Garden of Eden.
[1:19:00] And now that place that was meant for
[1:19:02] rest, for hope, for love, for harmony,
[1:19:07] for the growth, the multiplication
[1:19:10] of God now becomes a fallen Eden.
[1:19:15] Now that same home that was to have the
[1:19:18] harmony, now has the chaos.
[1:19:21] That same family that was to love, now
[1:19:24] there's hatred.
[1:19:26] Now there's malice. Now there's
[1:19:29] jealousy. Now there's envy.
[1:19:33] And now that same place that was made to
[1:19:36] be a place of peace,
[1:19:39] made to be a place of protection.
[1:19:41] Amen.
[1:19:42] Made to be a place for the living God to
[1:19:44] dwell in. Listen friends, I'm being real
[1:19:46] here with you tonight. Call it whatever
[1:19:48] you want here tonight. You could look at
[1:19:50] this church. You could look at your
[1:19:52] house. You could look at your family.
[1:19:53] You could look at your marriage. You
[1:19:55] could look at any thing Satan wants to
[1:19:58] invade and take any and everything, any
[1:20:02] attribute,
[1:20:03] amen,
[1:20:04] God has poured in your life. The serpent
[1:20:07] wants to come in and destroy and defile
[1:20:13] and corrupt.
[1:20:17] It's amazing because
[1:20:21] I'm just obeying the Lord here and I
[1:20:23] don't have much more time, but I do have
[1:20:24] some time.
[1:20:29] It's amazing because this is the
[1:20:31] scripture I opened up with. Give no
[1:20:34] place
[1:20:36] give no place
[1:20:38] to the devil.
[1:20:40] Amen.
[1:20:42] I was pondering just just today and I
[1:20:44] just writing notes out to myself. What
[1:20:48] are some of the things that ruin Eden?
[1:20:54] That Eden meaning the promise of peace,
[1:20:57] love,
[1:21:00] hope.
[1:21:02] What what what are some of those things
[1:21:04] that ruin that atmosphere of rest for
[1:21:08] the believer? safe, settled, secure in
[1:21:13] Jesus.
[1:21:14] Amen.
[1:21:16] Protected from the fowler, the devour.
[1:21:20] What are some of those things that
[1:21:21] allows the thief to come in to steal, to
[1:21:26] kill, and to destroy? Listen what
[1:21:28] brother Brandham says here in 20th
[1:21:29] Century Prophet. He said you would,
[1:21:31] listen to what brother Brandham says
[1:21:32] here. Now, the same thing is wrong with
[1:21:34] you, is wrong with that woman sitting
[1:21:36] over yonder, looking right at me on the
[1:21:38] end of the row, right out there with a
[1:21:40] little round hat on. You have that if
[1:21:42] you can display it. There's a dark
[1:21:43] string. Listen to this. He looks at a
[1:21:46] woman in the audience. The same thing
[1:21:48] wrong with you is wrong with her sitting
[1:21:50] yonder. Brother Adam Bam says right
[1:21:53] there looking at me right there at the
[1:21:56] end of the row with that little round
[1:21:59] hat on. Oh, there's a dark string.
[1:22:03] Notice what Brother Adam starts to see
[1:22:05] here. There's a dark string. The lady
[1:22:08] looking across this lady's head looking
[1:22:10] at me right here with her hand up.
[1:22:14] That's it, lady. That's right. Here it
[1:22:16] is. coming from one to the others.
[1:22:21] It's evil powers.
[1:22:23] Yeah. Amen.
[1:22:24] A dark streak.
[1:22:27] He says in darkest hour. That was proof
[1:22:28] of his resurrection. Darkest hour.
[1:22:31] Brother man says Jesus comes. Now here's
[1:22:34] two spirits
[1:22:35] calling one to another. I only wish that
[1:22:39] my lovely audience could be in this
[1:22:42] dimension and see this. This woman
[1:22:45] standing here is suffering with the same
[1:22:48] thing that that woman sitting there with
[1:22:51] her hands crossed. Right? Like that. And
[1:22:54] he says it again. Here's a dark line.
[1:22:58] Here's a dark line because the spirit
[1:23:02] that's on this woman is calling to this
[1:23:05] spirit for help.
[1:23:09] Now look, I got a I got a question for
[1:23:10] you. Has the spirit of darkness gotten
[1:23:14] worse
[1:23:16] than 1963?
[1:23:18] Oh yeah.
[1:23:18] Amen.
[1:23:19] So if there was connections that people
[1:23:22] could bring into their life and ingest
[1:23:25] in their human spirit that would be so
[1:23:28] dark the woman couldn't see it, the man
[1:23:30] couldn't see it, but yet there was a
[1:23:33] dark string following them in their
[1:23:36] life.
[1:23:38] And brother Brandham identifies it and
[1:23:39] says,"I only wish my lovely audience
[1:23:43] could see this. Two spirits calling one
[1:23:46] and the spirit that's on this woman is
[1:23:48] calling to the spirit for help. It's
[1:23:50] both the same disease.
[1:23:54] Arthritis
[1:23:56] to both." Listen to this. Earnestly
[1:23:58] continue. What if I told you that your
[1:24:00] heart trouble can be made well in Jesus
[1:24:02] name? You believe it? Then go
[1:24:06] just a minute. Demons screamed.
[1:24:10] Something called for help.
[1:24:13] Demon power. It come from the audience.
[1:24:17] When this woman was healed, that demon
[1:24:20] spirit screaming to one another for
[1:24:22] help. It's the spiritual world. We're
[1:24:26] not talking about the outside.
[1:24:30] I want you to notice this as brother
[1:24:32] Baron through prophetic vision. I'm so
[1:24:34] glad we had the glimpse. I think God did
[1:24:36] it this way on purpose for us to be able
[1:24:40] to understand what Paul was talking
[1:24:43] about in Ephesians 6 when he says we
[1:24:45] don't wrestle against flesh and blood
[1:24:47] but against powers, principalities, evil
[1:24:49] spirits of darkness, rulers in high
[1:24:52] places. Therefore, therefore, take unto
[1:24:55] you the whole armor of God that you can
[1:24:58] withstand in the evil day.
[1:25:02] And so, this is what Paul was referring
[1:25:04] to. And so, Brother Brandon begins to
[1:25:06] list this
[1:25:08] uh go back for me if you could, brother
[1:25:09] Josh. This is just stop. Oh, I don't
[1:25:11] have it on. That would help if I turned
[1:25:13] it on. Listen to this. So, he takes this
[1:25:16] look in into this other world. Now, this
[1:25:19] woman didn't see it. This man he goes to
[1:25:22] had no idea, had no clue. Even brother
[1:25:25] Bandom, I was listening to him the other
[1:25:27] day and he's talking, I can't remember
[1:25:29] the sermon name right now. It's slipping
[1:25:31] me. But but brother Bham comes to a a a
[1:25:34] woman. He walks off the stage, it sounds
[1:25:36] like to me, and to the woman. He takes
[1:25:38] her by the hand and he says, "Sister,"
[1:25:40] he says, "I see that that's a cancer in
[1:25:42] your life." She says, "Yes." And brother
[1:25:44] Brandon says, "Oh, oh my sister, it's
[1:25:48] worse than you think it is.
[1:25:50] And he starts by prophetic vision. You
[1:25:53] could hear the woman on the tape. And he
[1:25:54] says, "Now, sister, I want to tell you I
[1:25:57] can speak that off of you right now and
[1:26:00] it will have to leave." You say, "Well,
[1:26:03] praise God, brother. Speak it right off
[1:26:06] of my life." He says, "I can take it out
[1:26:08] of you." I think is the way he says it.
[1:26:10] I can take it off of you. Now, listen.
[1:26:13] But I can't keep it off of you.
[1:26:16] It will be your confession.
[1:26:20] Yeah.
[1:26:20] That I can, I will, I do believe
[1:26:25] that G look at how powerful confession
[1:26:28] was
[1:26:29] that she confessed with her mouth.
[1:26:32] Brother Madam said, it will be your
[1:26:33] confession in a promise that keeps that
[1:26:37] spirit off of you. He comes to that
[1:26:40] place in 20th century prophet, you know
[1:26:41] this very well. And he says here uh uh
[1:26:44] he says, "Excuse me, sister. Have to
[1:26:47] relax my mind once in a while. Now we be
[1:26:49] we'll be strangers. I see that you're
[1:26:50] strictly a stranger. You're from away
[1:26:53] from here. You've come from another
[1:26:55] city. You've got a lot of trouble."
[1:26:57] Notice this. You got a lot of trouble on
[1:27:00] your heart.
[1:27:01] Now, do you think this sister knew what
[1:27:04] brother Brandon was seeing? Most of the
[1:27:06] case, most of the time they didn't. Most
[1:27:08] of the time the spirits that brother
[1:27:10] Brandon would see and he would see a
[1:27:12] dark shadow or a dark spirit hovering
[1:27:15] over that person, they had no idea. Now
[1:27:17] here this woman comes up to the prayer
[1:27:19] line and brother Ben says, "I see a lot
[1:27:21] of trouble." He's not yet talking about
[1:27:24] a physical heart problem. Catch this.
[1:27:27] He's not yet talking about a physical
[1:27:29] heart disease, but he's talking about
[1:27:31] something in her spirit that she had
[1:27:34] ingested in her spirit. She had given
[1:27:37] place to the devil.
[1:27:39] Whether she knew it or not, she had
[1:27:41] given a place in her spirit. And now
[1:27:44] that devil was causing a lot of trouble
[1:27:46] on her heart. Listen, he says, "You got
[1:27:48] a lot of trouble on your heart." Oh, and
[1:27:51] you got heart trouble to begin with.
[1:27:54] Ain't it amazing? One is physical, one
[1:27:57] is spiritual.
[1:27:59] And many times the physical is just a
[1:28:03] result of the spiritual.
[1:28:06] Amen.
[1:28:07] Hello.
[1:28:09] You got heart trouble to begin. Is that
[1:28:10] right? There's a whole lot of blackness.
[1:28:12] There it is. I see a black sheet keep
[1:28:16] following you like that. I wonder when
[1:28:20] she woke up that day and took her kids
[1:28:22] to school, maybe went to the grocery
[1:28:25] store. Wonder if she's seen and knew
[1:28:27] that the entire time there was a demon
[1:28:30] spirit, a black shadow following her
[1:28:33] because of some place she had given to
[1:28:34] the enemy trying to influence her,
[1:28:37] trying to speak to her. Listen friends,
[1:28:39] I'm not trying to disturb you. I'm
[1:28:40] trying to wake you up to something here
[1:28:42] tonight
[1:28:43] that we can give place to the devil.
[1:28:47] We can give place to the devil in so
[1:28:50] much he has a legal right
[1:28:53] to stay there.
[1:28:56] And brother Brandham says, "I see that
[1:28:58] spirit following you. You didn't know
[1:29:00] it. But that spirit, listen, you think
[1:29:02] depression is not a spirit. Anxiety is
[1:29:03] not a spirit. Suicide is not a spirit.
[1:29:06] Pornography is not a spirit. Jealousy is
[1:29:08] not." Listen, all of these are demon
[1:29:10] spirits. They have a figure. They have
[1:29:12] an image. Brother Adam says, "Many of
[1:29:14] them, many times I see them. looks like
[1:29:16] a bat with long hair. No, the other time
[1:29:19] he calls it looks like a tortoise, I
[1:29:21] think it was.
[1:29:22] They have an image that he would peer
[1:29:24] into and look at because they gave place
[1:29:26] to the devil in their life. They gave
[1:29:29] him an entrance in. And when he gets an
[1:29:33] entrance in, he takes a stronghold and
[1:29:36] grips that life. And if he can, he'll
[1:29:38] suck the very life out of that person.
[1:29:40] If he can't take their life, he'll
[1:29:42] destroy their mind. He'll destroy the
[1:29:45] peace of God. He'll take sleep away from
[1:29:47] them. He'll take harmony away from them.
[1:29:50] He'll speak through them. And that
[1:29:51] spirit of that shadow will start to
[1:29:54] speak through them to their children, to
[1:29:56] their family.
[1:29:57] Amen.
[1:30:00] I'm talking about a spirit here.
[1:30:02] Yeah. Amen.
[1:30:03] Brother says, "A black sheep keep
[1:30:05] following you like that. Oh, it's a lie.
[1:30:08] Somebody's told a lie on you, and that
[1:30:11] was a man professing divine healing."
[1:30:12] And the sister says, "Yes." He said,
[1:30:15] "You was a witch. Is that true? You got
[1:30:17] a whole stir in your church, something
[1:30:19] other about it. Is that right? Your
[1:30:21] pastor's sick right now. He's got polio.
[1:30:23] Is that right?" Yes, sir. Sister, don't
[1:30:25] pay no attention to what them people
[1:30:27] tell you they're a lion. Notice the
[1:30:30] first key to deliverance. Don't pay no
[1:30:32] attention to what that voice is saying.
[1:30:36] Give no place to the devil. Don't give
[1:30:38] it your mind. Don't entertain it. Don't
[1:30:40] give it your thought. Don't confess it.
[1:30:42] Don't give it a place.
[1:30:46] The Bible says it this way. Take every
[1:30:48] thought captive.
[1:30:51] And he says, "Don't pay no attention to
[1:30:53] what them people telling you. They're a
[1:30:55] lion. The only thing wrong with your
[1:30:57] heart is that nervous condition. God,
[1:30:59] your heart worked up. Going home in
[1:31:01] peace. God bless you. You're all right.
[1:31:03] God bless you. You're not a witch." Just
[1:31:06] like that. What does it take? Brother
[1:31:08] didn't shake her. He didn't scream over
[1:31:10] her. He didn't even put anointing oil.
[1:31:13] So many times we wait for something when
[1:31:15] all that it takes is God to reveal it.
[1:31:19] Expose the devil. Expose him in your
[1:31:22] life. Let the gospel shine a light so
[1:31:25] deep in your in your soul, in your
[1:31:27] spirit that it it it exposes every lie.
[1:31:30] It exposes every scheme of the devil.
[1:31:33] And freedom comes right when the devil
[1:31:35] was exposed in her life.
[1:31:37] You're not a witch. What was that? There
[1:31:39] was a spirit there trying to influence
[1:31:42] her, trying to anoint her. Friends, they
[1:31:45] are just as real as you're real. See,
[1:31:48] many times when they leave, I've seen
[1:31:49] them leave right from this platform.
[1:31:51] I've seen some of them in the shape of
[1:31:53] bats, look like long hairs hanging on
[1:31:55] their legs. An epileptic demon looks
[1:31:57] like a tortoise with round legs hanging
[1:31:59] up like that. A demon of oppression
[1:32:01] seems to be more of a cloud form, like a
[1:32:04] wave, and it just makes a real funny
[1:32:06] sound. Real funny is what he's going to
[1:32:08] say. Funny sound when it when you when
[1:32:11] you're in that dimension to see the
[1:32:15] spirit.
[1:32:20] He says here, I I just want to make sure
[1:32:22] we we cover this. Now, some some of you
[1:32:26] may think that's wrong, but some the
[1:32:27] some of these days you'll realize if you
[1:32:29] could only take spiritual looking glass,
[1:32:31] look into your soul, you doubt, and you
[1:32:33] find what it looks like. And the
[1:32:35] greatest devil and the chief of all
[1:32:37] devils is unbelief.
[1:32:41] Unbelief. Give no place to the devil. I
[1:32:45] just want to take just a moment here to
[1:32:47] say, be careful what spirits you
[1:32:50] entertain.
[1:32:52] Young people, listen to me. Be careful
[1:32:54] what music you listen to. It carries
[1:32:57] spirits. Amen.
[1:32:59] Be careful what movies, families, what
[1:33:01] things you allow in your home, in rooms
[1:33:04] that you may not be in. Take control,
[1:33:07] dominion, and subdue your home. It is
[1:33:11] your Eden and it will only be what you
[1:33:14] allow or don't allow.
[1:33:16] Amen.
[1:33:16] If we allow jealousy in our home, that
[1:33:19] jealousy spirit will take over our
[1:33:21] family, our children. If we allow
[1:33:23] entertainment, come on, somebody. Don't
[1:33:25] make me just let don't let don't don't
[1:33:26] let me be the only one preach you preach
[1:33:28] with your amens.
[1:33:31] If we allow that in our home, in our
[1:33:33] life, be careful what spirits gossip
[1:33:36] that we entertain. You allow a spirit
[1:33:38] and before you know it, it's got control
[1:33:40] of you. It's influencing you. It's
[1:33:43] following you. It's speaking to you.
[1:33:46] But I got news for the devil. That might
[1:33:49] be the army of the devil. But I've got
[1:33:51] angels who constantly, the Bible says,
[1:33:54] encamp those who fear the Lord. And
[1:33:57] they're there to speak to me and to
[1:33:59] minister to me and to encourage me. If
[1:34:01] only I'd open up the right door and
[1:34:04] close the door to Hollywood. Come on,
[1:34:07] somebody. And open up a spiritual door
[1:34:10] and let angels come in our life and
[1:34:12] influence us.
[1:34:13] Amen.
[1:34:14] Wow.
[1:34:15] I'm going to close here.
[1:34:17] I'm going to close here.
[1:34:19] Come on.
[1:34:20] Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:34:23] I was I was The way the Lord deals with
[1:34:27] people sometimes
[1:34:30] so different.
[1:34:33] I was out mowing my my grass. I think
[1:34:37] this was I'd mowed it Saturday and
[1:34:42] you know out there on property now you
[1:34:44] got my home and you got all the woods
[1:34:45] and you know everything everything that
[1:34:48] you don't want to grow grows
[1:34:52] and everything that you do want to grow
[1:34:54] has trouble growing. Ain't that just
[1:34:55] about the way the Christian life is?
[1:34:58] And I I was just pondering this
[1:35:02] and as I as I was just I mowed it
[1:35:06] Saturday and and got it mostly good and
[1:35:08] and then I went back and and and the I
[1:35:11] think it was I don't know what day it
[1:35:13] was Monday. I think it was Monday this
[1:35:15] this past Monday. And I was I thought
[1:35:18] I'm going to get the rest of what I was
[1:35:19] It got dark before I could really get to
[1:35:22] everything. So I went through and I
[1:35:23] mowing everything and and I and I was
[1:35:26] just there and you know by myself been
[1:35:28] out there for a couple hours now just
[1:35:30] talking to the Lord
[1:35:32] and I I I was came over to a section. I
[1:35:37] went rolled my mower back up onto my
[1:35:40] grass and there was a section where I
[1:35:42] have that I've I've fenced off and it's
[1:35:44] just the woods just just the woods real
[1:35:46] big hardwood timber real deep woods. But
[1:35:49] then in front of that there was a
[1:35:50] section where my grass my sod didn't
[1:35:53] come to and there was a large section of
[1:35:55] just man every kind of just nasty grass
[1:35:58] maybe like a 20 by 20 section but I had
[1:36:00] my nice manicured yard then I had this
[1:36:02] sort of nastiness to there then then the
[1:36:04] woods and I and I was and I I just I
[1:36:07] walked out I thought man I just love to
[1:36:09] mow that. I'd love to get that, you
[1:36:11] know, looks so much nicer. But I got out
[1:36:13] and there was all kinds of thorns
[1:36:15] immediately sticking me and there's logs
[1:36:18] and and uh and I didn't want to damage
[1:36:20] the mower and all kinds of brown. I
[1:36:21] thought I can't even see through here to
[1:36:23] be able to cut. I don't want to I don't
[1:36:25] want to do something, you know, just
[1:36:26] wanting to do it. And I just as I as I
[1:36:29] was just sitting there mowing and just
[1:36:31] contemplating this just here for a
[1:36:33] moment, I the Lord just spoke to my
[1:36:36] heart just for a just just out of out of
[1:36:39] out of just a moment that I I wasn't
[1:36:41] expecting. And the Lord just spoke these
[1:36:44] words, give no place to the devil.
[1:36:48] And I I sat there and looked at those
[1:36:50] those high weeds and I thought, you know
[1:36:52] what? If if I let that remain, that's
[1:36:56] going to be a breeding ground for
[1:36:58] snakes.
[1:36:59] And those snakes are that much closer to
[1:37:02] my home, to my family, to my children,
[1:37:05] to my wife's dogs, our dogs,
[1:37:10] our pets, our animals. I said that
[1:37:13] jokingly. I love I love animals. Always
[1:37:16] have. But they're that much closer to
[1:37:19] those things that that I love. Right.
[1:37:21] And I just the Lord began to deal with
[1:37:23] my heart and I thought, I'm not going to
[1:37:24] allow the devil just to be camped out
[1:37:27] right here, the snakes to be camped out
[1:37:29] right here, right beside my yard. I
[1:37:31] could have just let it go. It would have
[1:37:33] been much easier just to let it grow,
[1:37:35] just to go wild. I thought I'll just let
[1:37:37] it go wild. Then I thought, no, you know
[1:37:39] what? If I do that, then that snake has
[1:37:42] been given a place. He's been given a
[1:37:44] spot. He's been given authority, if I
[1:37:47] could say it that way. And so, you know
[1:37:49] what I did? I just went through there. I
[1:37:51] did the hard work of going through
[1:37:53] there, cutting my hands up, ripping out
[1:37:55] logs, ripping out things that have been
[1:37:56] there, tree limbs and all kinds of
[1:37:59] things and pulling out this and trying
[1:38:01] to kick down things, make sure there was
[1:38:02] no stumps. And I got that mower and I
[1:38:04] started going over just inch by inch
[1:38:06] slowly as I could. Wouldn't you know it,
[1:38:09] not one, not two, but three snakes
[1:38:13] in that grass. One right after the other
[1:38:16] sli slithered out. One slithered out.
[1:38:19] Another one slithered out.
[1:38:21] And I just begin to think to myself as
[1:38:23] the Lord begin to put this sermon and
[1:38:25] this inspiration upon my heart. Give no
[1:38:28] place
[1:38:30] to the devil.
[1:38:32] Amen.
[1:38:33] If you give him a reason to stay, he'll
[1:38:37] stay.
[1:38:39] I want to read you something as I close.
[1:38:42] I'm going to close on this quote and
[1:38:44] have the musicians return. Before they
[1:38:45] do, I want to read it. Brother Brandon
[1:38:48] speaking here and I I know we know this
[1:38:51] real well, but the Lord has brought this
[1:38:53] fresh back to my memory. He's speaking
[1:38:54] about a a lady, a young lady, and he
[1:38:57] says a little later from that, there was
[1:38:59] a young girl. She's perhaps sitting here
[1:39:01] this morning. I don't see, but she comes
[1:39:03] sparingly. She's a member of a church in
[1:39:05] New Albany, a very prominent church of
[1:39:07] an outstanding church. I've been down
[1:39:09] there. She She's got a mental condition,
[1:39:11] a kind of psychonurosis. She she won't
[1:39:14] even leave the city or anywhere. She
[1:39:16] starts screaming and crying going on. So
[1:39:18] I prayed for her two or three times, but
[1:39:20] something wouldn't let me challenge that
[1:39:23] demon
[1:39:25] somehow. I don't know. I just couldn't
[1:39:28] do it. She's a friend to a nurse that
[1:39:30] lives in the neighborhood there. They
[1:39:32] come up. She was getting worse. She'd
[1:39:34] been that way for about 8 years. So she
[1:39:36] come up the other day and she said I I I
[1:39:38] told her I said, "Sis, the only thing I
[1:39:41] know is that there's a cause there
[1:39:42] somewhere. I don't know what it is. You
[1:39:46] could come up and see me. She says tells
[1:39:48] brother Brandon, "I've been prayed for
[1:39:50] my pastor." And my pastor sent me up up
[1:39:53] here and said, "Go see brother Billy.
[1:39:55] See what he says." I said, "Well, I I
[1:39:57] don't know, sis. I'm I'm just like your
[1:39:59] pastor.
[1:40:01] Have you confessed all your sins?
[1:40:05] Everything?"
[1:40:08] Sunday school teacher, had a great
[1:40:09] class, doing a good work, but that just
[1:40:12] hung over her. I didn't know what to do.
[1:40:16] Was just about imagine, you imagine how
[1:40:18] I'd feel. I just didn't know what to do.
[1:40:20] We took her in the room. I said, "All
[1:40:22] right, come on up." When people come, we
[1:40:24] stop everything. I got her in the room.
[1:40:26] I sat down, started talking to her about
[1:40:27] genealogies and about the beginning and
[1:40:29] origin of time and watching her. It was
[1:40:33] that same morning. God, I love this. God
[1:40:36] is always there at that crucial moment.
[1:40:40] After a while, I looked out there and
[1:40:41] there come a vision moving up. I seen an
[1:40:44] automobile going swiftly. I said, "Your
[1:40:47] condition has something to do with an
[1:40:48] automobile." She says, "No, I was never
[1:40:51] in a wreck." I said, "Just sit humble.
[1:40:56] I see you in a car. You almost get hit
[1:40:58] by a train." She jumped. Said, "Oh." I
[1:41:02] said, "Yes, and you're not with your
[1:41:04] husband. You're with another man. Your
[1:41:07] husband's overseas in war at that time."
[1:41:10] Went ahead and began to bring it on
[1:41:12] down. I said, "The things that you done,
[1:41:14] the immoral things, you told him about
[1:41:17] some of it, but you didn't tell him
[1:41:19] about all of it."
[1:41:22] She started screaming, holding her face
[1:41:25] like that. I said, "You're going to have
[1:41:27] an operation not long ago for your
[1:41:29] tonsils, and you was afraid to take an
[1:41:31] anesthetic, afraid you would tell that
[1:41:34] under that?" She just screamed and fell
[1:41:36] on the floor and said, "That's the
[1:41:37] truth." I said, "How you ever going to
[1:41:41] get anywhere with that hanging?"
[1:41:46] She said, "I asked God to forgive me." I
[1:41:48] said, "You never sinned against God. You
[1:41:51] sinned against your husband in vows. You
[1:41:54] go back and make that right. Then come
[1:41:57] and I can control that demon.
[1:42:00] Think about that. A legal right
[1:42:04] that even a prophet couldn't control or
[1:42:07] challenge that demon. I said, "By the
[1:42:10] way, your husband described how he
[1:42:12] looked, never seen him in my life, said
[1:42:14] he's got the same thing to confess to
[1:42:15] you. Now, if you believe it, call him on
[1:42:18] the phone and tell him to meet you." She
[1:42:20] went in and caught him on the phone.
[1:42:21] They met on the road and here they come
[1:42:23] back, tears running down their cheeks,
[1:42:24] forgive one another. The demon left her
[1:42:27] and there she was free. See, now I might
[1:42:31] have screamed and hollered over that
[1:42:33] demon and cast and everything else and
[1:42:38] that had would have never left her until
[1:42:41] that was corrected. See, you got to find
[1:42:45] the cause before you can find the cure.
[1:42:50] Amen.
[1:42:51] Amen.
[1:42:52] You go to a doctor, say, "I got a
[1:42:53] headache." He might give you an aspirin.
[1:42:55] Well, it would come back. Maybe you got
[1:42:57] stomach troubles causing the headache.
[1:42:58] Maybe you got an infection somewhere
[1:43:00] that's causing the fever. Maybe you got
[1:43:01] headaches, something another. You have
[1:43:03] to go back. That doctor has to diagnose
[1:43:05] that case till he finds what the cause
[1:43:08] is. And then you get rid of the cause.
[1:43:11] Could you stand to your feet and bow
[1:43:13] your heads with me? Musicians, could you
[1:43:15] come?
[1:43:17] I think one of the things that keep our
[1:43:19] people from being healed is the lack
[1:43:23] of confession. Every head bowed, every
[1:43:26] eye closed.
[1:43:28] I want to read that again.
[1:43:31] I think one of the things that keeps our
[1:43:33] people from being healed is the lack of
[1:43:36] confession.
[1:43:38] The lack of sincere
[1:43:40] confession.
[1:43:42] This might sound bad. I don't mean it to
[1:43:44] be that way. But looking at my wife
[1:43:45] sitting here, if I would go out here
[1:43:47] today and throw my arms around some
[1:43:49] other woman, make Brother Brandon says,
[1:43:52] and he he says that that would be wrong.
[1:43:54] Now, of course, my comforter would keep
[1:43:56] me from doing that. But I mean, if I did
[1:43:58] that and it happened that I didn't that
[1:44:01] I did it or anything similar to it
[1:44:04] and then I know the first thing is to
[1:44:06] say to my wife before I can say to God,
[1:44:08] forgive me because I sinned against her.
[1:44:10] If you come to the altar, remember you
[1:44:12] have a go make that right first before
[1:44:16] you offer your gift. So I got to go to
[1:44:19] her.
[1:44:20] I believe in confession. I believe in
[1:44:22] confession is straightening up also. It
[1:44:25] isn't true confession unless it is. What
[1:44:28] if I said I'm going to confess it that I
[1:44:30] done wrong. I say good Lord, old friend
[1:44:32] of mine, you know that I know you real
[1:44:33] well. Praise God. Hallelujah. I I think
[1:44:36] you're a good fellow. Forgive me. You
[1:44:37] know, old friend, I didn't mean that
[1:44:40] way. Now, you say that's sacrilegious.
[1:44:42] It is. And to make a confession like
[1:44:44] that, it is. What if I say, "Lord, I
[1:44:46] didn't mean to do it that way, and you
[1:44:47] just help me, and I won't do it again."
[1:44:50] He'll refuse my sacrifice
[1:44:53] until I go first and make that right
[1:44:55] with my wife.
[1:44:58] What if I come to her with the same
[1:45:00] irreverence and say, "Oh, girl, friend
[1:45:01] of mine, old mother, my children, my old
[1:45:03] sweetheart, you know, we've been chums
[1:45:05] for a long time." What if I put my arms
[1:45:06] around another woman? What do you say
[1:45:08] about that old kid? Would you forgive
[1:45:09] me? I imagine how she'd look at me.
[1:45:12] She'd say, "What's happened to my
[1:45:13] husband?" The first thing she wouldn't
[1:45:15] know whether I was kidding or whether I
[1:45:17] wasn't. And you don't go that way to
[1:45:20] make a confession to your fellow man or
[1:45:23] God. You go with the depths of
[1:45:26] sincerity,
[1:45:27] with godly sorrow for your sin. First,
[1:45:31] you must be sorry. I must tell her,
[1:45:33] "Sweetheart, come here. It may mean the
[1:45:35] rest of our married. It may brother
[1:45:38] says, "Sweetheart, come here." It may
[1:45:40] mean the rest of our married life. The
[1:45:42] woman that I live with, that's my
[1:45:44] sweetheart. How I've longed loved you
[1:45:46] all these years, but now you may leave
[1:45:48] me from this. You may not stay with me.
[1:45:50] You may not accept me. And I'm knowing
[1:45:52] of that. But yet, to make it right, I
[1:45:54] got to get it right. I got to tell her
[1:45:57] with the depths of my heart. Then I've
[1:45:59] got to tell God the same way. and tell
[1:46:02] both her and God with the sincerity that
[1:46:05] I'll never do it again by the grace of
[1:46:07] God. See,
[1:46:09] now I may be able to pull it over her
[1:46:12] and she won't see it. Rather's going to
[1:46:15] say, "But I couldn't pull it over God.
[1:46:17] He sees it all."
[1:46:20] Wonder if you'd bow your heads with me,
[1:46:22] every eye closed just as we close this
[1:46:25] Wednesday night sermon out.
[1:46:29] You know, this is just the way the Lord
[1:46:32] so burned this upon my heart.
[1:46:40] Give no place
[1:46:42] to the devil.
[1:46:45] Don't let him hide.
[1:46:49] He's a snake.
[1:46:51] He's a thief.
[1:46:54] He's an intruder.
[1:46:57] And he'll let you live your life,
[1:47:02] have your home,
[1:47:05] have your worship, have your church,
[1:47:08] and sit there and hide in that place of
[1:47:11] your heart and keep you
[1:47:14] from that thing that you so desperately
[1:47:16] need the Lord.
[1:47:19] Let me just say to you, friend, my
[1:47:21] brother, my sister,
[1:47:26] it's first got to start here.
[1:47:29] We want to restored Eden. We want to
[1:47:32] take back Eden.
[1:47:34] We want to take back that place that God
[1:47:37] intended to be sacred. God intended to
[1:47:40] be holy. God intended to be a place of
[1:47:43] protection, a symbol of
[1:47:46] of everything God wanted for our home,
[1:47:49] our lives, our families. But just as he
[1:47:53] gave Adam a garden to tend, he gives all
[1:47:56] of us a garden to watch over.
[1:47:59] Amen.
[1:48:01] Watch over. Not just physically, but
[1:48:04] spiritually.
[1:48:05] Guard your heart. Guard your confession.
[1:48:09] Guard your thoughts.
[1:48:12] Guard your homes.
[1:48:14] [Music]
[1:48:17] That's why the Bible says he told man to
[1:48:20] tend it and to keep it, to watch over
[1:48:23] it, to protect it,
[1:48:27] not giving the devil a place.
[1:48:33] I'll give you the chance now, every head
[1:48:35] bowed, every eye closed,
[1:48:38] to say, "Lord,
[1:48:40] if I've given the place to the devil in
[1:48:43] any place of my life,
[1:48:47] [Music]
[1:48:49] if I've given him a spot,
[1:48:52] a habitat
[1:48:54] to live in my mind, to live in my
[1:48:57] spirit, to live in my heart,
[1:49:00] that black shadow that maybe I've given
[1:49:03] place to, but I Lord tonight I want to
[1:49:07] be free of that. God bless those hands
[1:49:10] up everywhere.
[1:49:12] My hands up to say Lord
[1:49:15] I want to I want to evict the intruder
[1:49:19] tonight.
[1:49:20] I want to eradicate I don't want him to
[1:49:23] have any place over my home, my family,
[1:49:28] my children.
[1:49:31] I don't want him to have any sway,
[1:49:34] Lord,
[1:49:37] but today I want to confess my faults.
[1:49:40] James says one to another. Pray that you
[1:49:43] may be healed. Brother Adam says, "I
[1:49:45] wonder if so many times we're not healed
[1:49:47] because of that."
[1:49:50] And that woman wanted it so bad. She
[1:49:52] wanted deliverance. She wanted God to
[1:49:55] deliver her of that psycho neurosis
[1:49:58] condition. had no peace, but she didn't
[1:50:01] need deliverance. First, before
[1:50:03] deliverance, she needed God to come and
[1:50:06] restore the covenant that she made in
[1:50:09] her life. And I just want to say, Lord,
[1:50:12] if there's anything before I ever ask
[1:50:15] for any gift, for any pleasure, for any
[1:50:18] anything, Lord God, first God, let me
[1:50:20] first restore. Let me make sure there's
[1:50:23] nothing between my soul and my savior.
[1:50:26] Let the light of of the gospel shine so
[1:50:29] deep within me, God, exposing sin. God,
[1:50:33] if I need to make it right, then let me
[1:50:35] be brave enough. Lord, let me know that
[1:50:38] beyond any beyond anything, Lord Jesus,
[1:50:41] there's healing. There's hope. There's
[1:50:43] restoration. There's harmony.
[1:50:47] Beyond repentance is restoration. You
[1:50:49] got to reclaim Eden. Friends, you got to
[1:50:52] expose the snake in your garden. Give no
[1:50:56] place to the devil, but expose him.
[1:50:59] Drive him out.
[1:51:01] Guard that place of Eden that God's
[1:51:03] given you by the token, that place of
[1:51:06] harmony in your home. Protect it. Don't
[1:51:08] let any foul, any foul spirit come in
[1:51:11] that home. But say, "God, let me cleanse
[1:51:13] it. Make it a holy place. Make it a
[1:51:15] habitation where you could dwell." How
[1:51:17] could we friends expect God to answer
[1:51:19] our prayers if we haven't done the very
[1:51:22] first works, the very most simple
[1:51:24] things? If we give place to the devil,
[1:51:27] how can we expect his protection? How
[1:51:30] can we expect his deliverance? How can
[1:51:32] we expect his blessing?
[1:51:35] [Music]
[1:51:40] Lord Jesus,
[1:51:43] Lord, I bow my head tonight knowing,
[1:51:45] Lord, even before I preach this sermon,
[1:51:48] you were so heavy upon my heart. I don't
[1:51:52] mean it, Lord, in some negative way. I
[1:51:54] don't I don't mean it in some, Lord,
[1:51:58] some discouraging way.
[1:52:01] You know, with all of my heart, Lord, I
[1:52:04] believe with all of my heart that
[1:52:07] there's healing waiting. There's
[1:52:10] deliverance waiting.
[1:52:12] But it's got to start here for us to
[1:52:16] have Eden. It must start here.
[1:52:23] I pray Lord if there'd be any rooe of
[1:52:25] bitterness, any root of jealousy, any
[1:52:27] root of malice, any root of hatred, any
[1:52:30] any root of Lord of envy or strife. Many
[1:52:34] times, Lord, families are locked and
[1:52:37] situations are locked in homes and
[1:52:39] children and mothers and fathers and
[1:52:41] wives and husbands and praying and
[1:52:43] beating the altar. And I wonder so many
[1:52:45] times, Lord, if we don't scream and
[1:52:47] scream at demons and scream at devils,
[1:52:50] and all the while they got a right to
[1:52:51] sit there,
[1:52:52] all the while they got a right just to
[1:52:54] harm us and haunt us until we humble
[1:52:58] ourselves under the mighty hand of God
[1:53:02] and ask for forgiveness when it's hard.
[1:53:04] Forgive others when it's hard. Look past
[1:53:08] and move on as look and live. Look to
[1:53:12] that look to that perfect sacrifice who
[1:53:15] bled and died for us and was made
[1:53:18] guilty. Wasn't guilty. No guilt upon
[1:53:21] you, Lord. But you became sin.
[1:53:25] Grant it, Lord Jesus, to our families.
[1:53:27] Grant it to our homes. Grant it to our
[1:53:28] church. Friends, I wonder if you'd just
[1:53:30] raise a hand and say, "Lord, I want
[1:53:31] Eden. I want it for my home. I want it
[1:53:34] for my marriage. I want it for my
[1:53:36] children. I want it." Oh, hands up all
[1:53:38] over the building. I want it for my
[1:53:40] church. I want to for Lord in every
[1:53:42] situation I want a restored I believe a
[1:53:45] restored Eden has begun and I believe
[1:53:48] it's my inheritance as a son or daughter
[1:53:50] of God. I do not have to live under the
[1:53:53] curse of a of a of a spirit. I don't
[1:53:55] have to live under that dark shadow. So
[1:53:58] why would I why would I allow myself to
[1:54:00] go another day under his control or his
[1:54:03] influence when I got the Holy Spirit? I
[1:54:06] got the the enforcer of the word of God
[1:54:09] ready to bring healing. Thank you,
[1:54:12] Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:54:15] [Music]
[1:54:17] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:54:19] Thank you for your word. Oh, could we
[1:54:21] just raise our hands here for a moment
[1:54:22] before I have you gather? Just thank him
[1:54:25] here just for a moment. Thank you,
[1:54:26] Jesus.
[1:54:28] Thank you for your word. Thank you for a
[1:54:30] promise, Lord. Thank you that you don't
[1:54:33] just let it stay in ruin. Oh, but you
[1:54:36] want to restore. You want to rebuild.
[1:54:38] You want to start at the beginning. You
[1:54:40] want to go back to the first love. You
[1:54:42] want to go back to the first works, God.
[1:54:44] Because you know if we'll get it right
[1:54:45] there at the beginning. As brother
[1:54:46] Brandham said, where'd you where's God?
[1:54:49] Wherever you left him. Go back to where
[1:54:50] you left him. You want the power of God?
[1:54:53] Go back to where you left him. Samson,
[1:54:55] you want the power of God to answer your
[1:54:58] prayers? Go back to the do the first
[1:55:00] works again. Go back to the first place.
[1:55:04] Oh, he'll be there. He's faithful. He
[1:55:07] always is. He's always faithful. He's
[1:55:11] true. He's always just. He's always kind
[1:55:15] and never turn away. The Bible says a
[1:55:17] broken and contrite spirit. And he'll
[1:55:20] never know why turn away. He won't can't
[1:55:22] cast. He's close to the brokenhearted,
[1:55:24] close to those who are contrite.
[1:55:28] And God can do it. God can do it. God
[1:55:31] can fight your battles. The ones that
[1:55:33] you can't win, God can win them. God can
[1:55:36] win them. But you got to let it go. You
[1:55:39] got to let God
[1:55:42] let it be.
[1:55:44] The more that I surrender, could you
[1:55:46] sing it, Brother Tony? The more that I
[1:55:48] surrender, the lighter my load. The more
[1:55:49] that I release my cares, the more he
[1:55:53] takes control.
[1:55:55] Let's sing it together now. The more
[1:55:58] that I surrender,
[1:56:01] the lighter my Lord,
[1:56:02] the lighter
[1:56:04] my Lord.
[1:56:06] Yes, Jesus.
[1:56:08] The more that I release my cares, the
[1:56:14] more he takes control.
[1:56:18] Oh yes, Jesus.
[1:56:19] The more that I can humble myself,
[1:56:25] the more he lifts me up. Yes. And every
[1:56:30] day highly.
[1:56:32] Lord, I love you.
[1:56:34] Lord, I love.
[1:56:36] Could you sing a verse for the
[1:56:39] Let's sing a verse together now. And it
[1:56:42] gets easier
[1:56:44] to understand
[1:56:48] this road I'm traveling down.
[1:56:53] No more wondering
[1:56:56] away.
[1:56:58] Thank you, Lord. I'm standing on solid
[1:57:02] ground. Oh, I know. Now I know what I'm
[1:57:10] The voice I hear is yours alone. Every
[1:57:16] day I
[1:57:24] more than I surrender.
[1:57:27] More than I surrender.
[1:57:31] I my Lord
[1:57:36] I release my care
[1:57:54] lift me up me
[1:57:58] and every day I live.
[1:58:03] Lord, I love you.
[1:58:08] Sing the verse now. The second verse.
[1:58:11] The problems I had on yesterday
[1:58:16] are stepping stones to a higher place.
[1:58:22] Those trials that seem so awome. Thank
[1:58:26] you, Jesus.
[1:58:28] victory.
[1:58:32] No one can hear your heart.
[1:58:38] I hear your
[1:58:48] [Applause]
[1:58:52] Surrender.

[1:59:30] Lord,
[1:59:34] more than I see,
[1:59:37] the more that I surrender,

[1:59:59] Oh, I can hle my

[2:00:08] and every day
[2:00:13] Lord.
[2:00:18] We'll keep you there tonight. Brother
[2:00:20] Luther says, "Pray request for Wednesday
[2:00:21] evening. Ty Heth, my oldest daughter's
[2:00:23] father-in-law, has been unable to work
[2:00:26] for six weeks. The doctors say he has
[2:00:28] severe tendinitis in his wrist and his
[2:00:30] arms. We want to pray for that tonight.
[2:00:33] Tai Heth is his name.
[2:00:36] Please continue to pray for brother JD
[2:00:39] and the services being held in Egypt.
[2:00:41] The Lord is doing great things and Satan
[2:00:43] is fighting hard against the word. We
[2:00:46] got some reports of that. I mean, the
[2:00:48] devil fighting our brother, trying to
[2:00:50] stop services and give him afflictions.
[2:00:53] But mean, we're going to we're going to
[2:00:54] let prayer change things. Amen.
[2:00:56] Sister Angie Heth, we appreciate your
[2:00:58] prayer during our crazy time of life.
[2:01:00] God is answering in his special ways. My
[2:01:03] daughter Caitlyn has had severe chest
[2:01:05] pains this last month and it's been
[2:01:07] worse the last few days accompanied by
[2:01:09] erratic and high blood pressure. The
[2:01:11] nurse said she felt like Caitlyn had a
[2:01:13] heart attack. They're watching her now.
[2:01:16] My goodness. want to be remembering a
[2:01:18] daughter of Sister um Angie Heth, Sister
[2:01:21] Caitlyn Heth, Sister Hope Quick. Please
[2:01:24] pray for Denise Sers, the mother of
[2:01:26] Sister Joanne's neighbor in San Diego.
[2:01:28] She had to visit the emergency room with
[2:01:30] kidney issues. The Lord recently uh
[2:01:33] healed her of stage 4 cancer. So, we
[2:01:35] know that he is more than able. Um so,
[2:01:39] we know that he's more than able and
[2:01:41] willing. Satan is a liar. And we stand
[2:01:43] by faith. We stand by our faith in God's
[2:01:46] promise. Uh, Sister Kathy Guest, this is
[2:01:49] not old. Somebody help me out. These are
[2:01:51] these are new, right? Want to make sure
[2:01:53] I got this note that's updated. We
[2:01:55] didn't read these last Wednesday, did
[2:01:56] we? Okay, good. Want to make sure.
[2:01:59] Sister Kathy Guest, remember our
[2:02:01] granddaughter Tiffany? She has been
[2:02:02] depressed for a while. Just sits at home
[2:02:04] and doesn't work or go to places much.
[2:02:07] She's not a Christian. Pray for her
[2:02:09] salvation. Also, she uh she was
[2:02:12] energetic and worked really hard. My
[2:02:15] believe God can change that.
[2:02:18] Amen. Sister Phyllis Vel, I have a
[2:02:21] special unspoken prayer request tonight.
[2:02:24] I wonder if you might have a need, maybe
[2:02:26] something unspoken you just want to
[2:02:27] identify that. Just raise a hand to the
[2:02:29] Lord. Say, "Lord, here's my need." Why
[2:02:32] don't you put your arm over, your hand
[2:02:33] over on that person who's beside you.
[2:02:35] Let's just call out to the Lord for
[2:02:36] these special needs. Lord Jesus. Father,
[2:02:39] you see these different requests, Lord,
[2:02:41] that we have, Brother Luther's request,
[2:02:44] Lord, for Tyth. And we called it out,
[2:02:47] Lord. Brother JD there in Egypt. We
[2:02:50] called out his name, Lord God. We're
[2:02:52] bringing him before your throne. The
[2:02:54] daughter of Sister Angie, Sister Caitlyn
[2:02:56] Heath, Lord. Father, you see the doctors
[2:02:59] thinking she's had a heart attack. We
[2:03:01] call her out, Lord God. We bring that
[2:03:03] need before your throne. Now, Sister
[2:03:05] Hope puts in the request for Denise
[2:03:07] Sers. Lord God, we've already watched
[2:03:09] what you can do. So, we know that you're
[2:03:11] able and you're willing, Lord. This
[2:03:14] granddaughter of Sister Kathy Guest,
[2:03:15] Lord God, Tiffany wanting, Lord, to see
[2:03:18] her live and thrive again. But that
[2:03:20] spirit depression and anxiety has just
[2:03:24] stunted her, Lord, and stopped her.
[2:03:25] Above all that, God, she wants to see
[2:03:27] her saved. What greater thing, Lord God,
[2:03:30] than you can do for a person than to
[2:03:32] save them from their sins? For Sister
[2:03:34] Phyllis with the unspoken. All these
[2:03:37] hands, Lord God, that my hands are up
[2:03:39] now. You know, I need you, Lord. Father,
[2:03:42] I need you to move. And I just present
[2:03:44] my request before you right now. I just
[2:03:47] want to say, Lord, I believe you're
[2:03:49] greater than all of these requests. I
[2:03:51] believe your word and your promises are
[2:03:54] yay and amen. We stand upon them here
[2:03:56] tonight as a family of God, hand in
[2:03:59] hand, arm in arm, believing God, that we
[2:04:02] can bind every spirit. You told us that,
[2:04:04] Lord God, whatsoever you bind on earth,
[2:04:07] it'll be bound in heaven. Whatsoever you
[2:04:09] loose. So God, we just loose the Holy
[2:04:11] Ghost right now upon each and every
[2:04:13] single one of these requests. May you do
[2:04:16] what your word says, Lord. And that's
[2:04:18] the exceedingly abundantly above all
[2:04:20] that we could hope or think or ask.
[2:04:22] Lord, even beyond our Lord, of what we
[2:04:24] would expect, God, you move in
[2:04:26] unexpected ways. I pray, Lord, that
[2:04:28] you'd meet the need of every hand, every
[2:04:30] heart, God, that stands here before you
[2:04:33] on this Wednesday night, Lord, this
[2:04:34] prayer service. We believe that you'll
[2:04:37] do great things amongst us. We believe
[2:04:39] you want to do great things amongst us,
[2:04:41] Lord. and we just identify with an
[2:04:43] uplifted hand and say, "Lord, I want you
[2:04:46] to move, God. Move in my heart. Move in
[2:04:49] my home. Move, Lord God, on the behalf
[2:04:51] of my request." We need you, Lord Jesus.
[2:04:54] We just want to say also, Lord, we love
[2:04:56] you with all of our hearts, God. We
[2:04:59] believe you now more than we've ever
[2:05:01] believed you before. We stand upon your
[2:05:03] promises in a world that's faithless, in
[2:05:06] a in a society, Lord, that's rejected
[2:05:08] you. But here's a heart, oh God, that
[2:05:10] gives you place. If your word says give
[2:05:13] no place to the devil, Lord, then we
[2:05:15] won't. But I just want to say I want to
[2:05:16] give place to you, Lord. I want to give
[2:05:19] seed. Give a fertile bedding ground. Oh,
[2:05:21] how many hearts want to do that? Say,
[2:05:23] Lord, I want to give place to the Lord.
[2:05:26] I want to give him a place to work and
[2:05:28] to do the outworkings of his plan in my
[2:05:30] life. Make my soil a bedding ground for
[2:05:33] the word. The seed which is Lord, your
[2:05:35] word, the Bible says, is a seed. Let it
[2:05:38] grow in our hearts, oh God, from the
[2:05:40] front door to the back door. Help us,
[2:05:42] Jesus. I pray as a church, help us, Lord
[2:05:45] God. Help our families. Help our young.
[2:05:47] Help our youth. Help our old. Lord God,
[2:05:49] we need you now. I pray that you do it,
[2:05:52] Lord, in Jesus' name.
[2:05:56] Amen. You love him tonight. Amen. Do you
[2:05:59] love him tonight?
[2:06:00] How many just want to tell him? Say,
[2:06:02] Lord, I love you with all of my heart,
[2:06:04] all of my soul, all of my mind. Lord.
[2:06:08] Amen. We're going to sing it just before
[2:06:10] we're dismissed. Brother Tony, go in the
[2:06:12] fear of God. We'll see you Sunday

[2:06:21] God bless you friends at your own
[2:06:22] leisure.
[2:06:23] The lighter
[2:06:25] my low.
[2:06:27] Yes.
[2:06:28] The more I release my care, the more he
[2:06:35] takes control,
[2:06:39] the more that I can humble myself,
[2:06:44] the more he lifts me up.
[2:06:48] And every day I live.
[2:06:52] Lord, I love you more,
[2:06:57] more than I surrender.
[2:07:01] [Music]

[2:07:07] [Music]
[2:07:08] more than I release my care
[2:07:15] more. He takes control.

[2:07:26] the more it lifts me up and every day.

[2:07:37] more
[2:07:41] and it gets easier
[2:07:44] to understand
[2:07:47] this road I'm traveling down.
[2:07:52] No more wondering
[2:07:55] or wavering.
[2:07:58] I'm standing on solid ground.
[2:08:02] Now I know I'm headed to my future home.
[2:08:08] The voice I hear is yours alone. Every
[2:08:13] day I live.
[2:08:16] Lord I love you.

[2:09:02] [Music]
[2:09:05] The problems I had on yesterday
[2:09:10] are mere stepping stones to a higher
[2:09:14] place. Those trials that seem so awome
[2:09:19] to me are now my banners of victory.
[2:09:26] And I know I'm headed to my future home.
[2:09:32] The voice I hear is yours alone. Every
[2:09:37] day I live.
[2:09:40] Lord, I love
[2:09:43] you more.
[2:09:48] that I surrender
[2:09:55] my
[2:09:59] Release
[2:10:01] my hand.
