[23:44] amen praise the Lord we're so thankful
[23:48] for the grace of the Lord I've been
[23:51] just rolling around in my mind something
[23:53] so simple but with the things that
[23:56] everybody's going through and all of us
[23:58] are going through there's a word that
[24:01] the Lord has for us and that's his grace
[24:03] is sufficient for thee it's grace is
[24:07] sufficient for me it's sufficient for
[24:09] you for his power is made perfect in
[24:13] weakness
[24:14] amen that's the antithesis of what the
[24:17] world looks at and the world thinks
[24:19] about but what God thinks of it is when
[24:22] you're standing in the greatest need of
[24:24] Grace is when the greatest power is
[24:27] going to flow in and through your life
[24:28] amen let's pray

[24:47] sure what's happening Lord we could just
[24:49] rest in your hand and in your love Lord

[25:06] would come and anoint the speaker and
[25:08] anoint the hearer Lord May May the word
[25:10] come forth Lord to the word Lord we ask
[25:14] this for your glory Lord for your
[25:17] kingdom furtherance we ask in Jesus name
[25:19] amen
[25:21] God bless you all
[25:23] um
[25:24] a couple weeks back I was having some
[25:26] fellowship with a few brothers and
[25:28] brother Matt
[25:29] and I were talking and he about what my
[25:32] burden was and what I'd been going over
[25:34] with Sunday School
[25:35] on the subject of seven women take hold
[25:38] of one man and I know he mentioned it to
[25:40] brother Jason about
[25:42] bringing this on a on a regular service
[25:45] outside of Sunday school so that's what
[25:47] we're doing here I'm going to do my best
[25:49] to get through it I've there's actually
[25:51] there's no way that I'll get through the
[25:53] entire thing I'm just going to try to
[25:56] consolidate it and get it out as much as
[25:58] I can because I'll be gone for quite a
[26:00] while after this so part two will just
[26:03] have to be a repetition of part one
[26:05] actually so so uh I'm gonna do my best
[26:08] to get through
[26:09] but if we can bring up that PowerPoint
[26:11] Ethan
[26:13] seven women take hold of one man as my
[26:16] topic
[26:17] and the scripture we're looking at is
[26:19] Isaiah 4
[26:22] 1 and 2.
[26:31] it's in the email I sent it to the email
[26:33] you got it just not coming up
[26:36] well if you have a Bible or a phone
[26:40] that has a Bible app on it pull it out
[26:43] Isaiah 4 1 and 2.
[26:47] and in that day seven women shall take
[26:50] hold of one man saying we will eat our
[26:52] own bread and wear our own apparel
[26:56] only let us be called by thy name to
[26:58] take away our reproach
[27:00] in that day shall the branch of the Lord
[27:02] be beautiful and glorious and the fruit
[27:05] of the Earth shall be excellent and
[27:07] comely for them that are escaped of
[27:10] Israel may the Lord add the blessing to
[27:12] the reading of his word you can be
[27:13] seated
[27:19] well we're having technical difficulties
[27:21] with the PowerPoint and it's definitely
[27:24] critical that we have it or you'll fall
[27:25] asleep
[27:27] is this a lot of reading a lot of quotes
[27:29] that we're going through so looking at
[27:30] that scripture
[27:32] seven women shall take hold of one man
[27:35] that word take hold means to seize or to
[27:38] grab and hold tightly
[27:41] to refrain or support by grabbing hold
[27:45] and as you look at Isaiah 4 1 and 2
[27:49] there's two parts of it verse one is
[27:51] speaking of well we'll just simplify it
[27:54] and say the bad side of it
[27:56] and part two is looking at the positive
[27:59] side of it on the on in part one you're
[28:02] looking at seven women are going to
[28:04] seize
[28:05] one man
[28:07] and and saying
[28:08] we will make our own provisions
[28:11] in Exodus 21 18 it says if if he take
[28:14] him another wife
[28:16] her food her raiment and her duty of
[28:19] marriage shall he not diminish
[28:22] so this is this is a verse speaking
[28:25] about if uh if a man takes for himself
[28:28] like a second wife he's talking about
[28:30] polygamy we understand that polygamy is
[28:33] is not a new testament Doctrine and it
[28:37] was never encouraged All Through the
[28:39] Bible in the Old Testament it was
[28:41] discouraged told Ken Kings
[28:43] directly not to multiply to themselves
[28:46] wise because it would turn their hearts
[28:48] away from God
[28:49] so in this verse he's saying if you do
[28:51] do that you're not going to take away
[28:54] anything from your first wife because
[28:57] your obligation is to provide her with
[29:00] food and raiment and the duty of
[29:03] marriage so there's an obligation that a
[29:06] man has to be a provider but here in
[29:09] Isaiah 4 this is being turned on its
[29:11] head now the woman is saying no
[29:15] I don't need you to be my provider I
[29:18] don't want I don't want that just let I
[29:21] will provide everything just give me
[29:23] your name to take away my reproach and
[29:27] we can look at this in both the natural
[29:29] and we can look at it in the spiritual
[29:32] so we look at this in other words we
[29:34] look at it in the church world but we
[29:36] can also look at it in the natural realm
[29:39] where feminism has taken hold and we're
[29:43] going to speak we're going to speak more
[29:44] about that there's been a specific
[29:46] process that Satan has done over the
[29:49] last several hundred years in order to
[29:51] attack the foundations of the word of
[29:54] God in order to get to this place of a
[29:57] Satan's Eden today
[30:01] brother Branham says and Wrecking
[30:03] recognizing your day and its message
[30:06] silly women LED away with diverse lusts
[30:09] Hollywood all this kind of stuff bobbed
[30:11] hair wearing shorts wearing makeups all
[30:14] this kind of stuff which is Unbecoming
[30:17] did you know the woman plays a great
[30:19] part in the last days
[30:21] you know the Bible said that that those
[30:23] who Escape out of this great damnation
[30:25] will be a beautiful Branch before the
[30:27] Lord someday I'll get to the to it the
[30:30] Lord willing for it for you women
[30:32] let you see what God thinks of the woman
[30:34] that really escaped this damnation of
[30:36] this day said she would be beautiful so
[30:40] okay we got it
[30:45] said she would be beautiful so we look
[30:47] here and we see this both sides of it
[30:50] you have on the one side Satan is
[30:53] completely against what a real woman is
[30:57] supposed to be why is Satan against what
[31:00] a real woman is supposed to be why is he
[31:02] muddying that and making it so perverted
[31:04] why is he even making it hard for
[31:06] Christian women to understand what it
[31:09] means to be a woman why is he doing that
[31:12] why why do you think he's doing that
[31:14] because in this very age he's going to
[31:16] have a bride who won't fall
[31:19] who won't do what Eve did he's going to
[31:21] have a bride that won't pervert one word
[31:23] and fall away from it he's going to have
[31:25] a bride that overcomes and is going to
[31:27] prove to Satan that that's the case
[31:31] see and so that why do you think Satan
[31:33] is doing what he's doing today and
[31:36] making Mass confusion
[31:38] purpose it's purposeful he could see the
[31:41] prophecy of scripture he could see what
[31:43] direction God was going and what he was
[31:46] bringing and so he's going to pervert
[31:47] the whole thing
[31:51] and as we look at it on the spiritual
[31:52] side you see there's seven women take
[31:56] hold of one man
[31:58] and say we'll have our own bread and
[32:01] wear our own clothes think about that
[32:04] for a second
[32:07] her own garments and her own food
[32:10] see apply that spiritually what is what
[32:13] is bread the bread of life the word of
[32:15] God the word manifested we will have our
[32:18] own word we want our own version of the
[32:21] word we will supply it see the churches
[32:24] not Christ see Christ is the one who is
[32:28] going to bring the word Christ is going
[32:31] to bring a Vindicated
[32:33] word of God but this woman says
[32:37] um I'll bring my own bread
[32:40] only let me be called by my name let me
[32:43] be called as a Christian
[32:46] and let me provide my own raiment is
[32:50] what she says what what what's that
[32:52] speaking of We're the bride is to be
[32:55] clothed
[32:56] in the word of God he's to be what she's
[32:59] to be Washed by the Water of the word
[33:03] this bride she don't want that she
[33:05] provides her own
[33:06] Scarlet colored robe
[33:10] so you see that on the spiritual side
[33:12] the the the the the the the woman the
[33:15] church wants to make her own Supply
[33:19] wants to be her own provider she wants
[33:23] to carry Christ around
[33:27] she wants him under her submission just
[33:30] be let me be called by your name she
[33:33] wants Christ on a leash
[33:35] carried around which way wherever that
[33:39] she wants to go but of course Christ
[33:42] will never be under their headship
[33:45] just that's what they want and that's
[33:47] what they're acting as and that's what
[33:50] they're presenting before the world
[33:51] woman above the man
[33:54] woman controlling the man what do you
[33:56] think is happening in our society
[33:59] same thing
[34:01] same thing but then you have the other
[34:03] side of it you have the true bride of
[34:06] Christ you have a true woman under her
[34:09] headship
[34:10] saying Amen to her Vindicated headship
[34:13] saying Amen to the word that's brought
[34:15] brought forth
[34:17] Christ sends a prophet
[34:20] that's how he always brings his word he
[34:22] sends a prophet they say no thank you
[34:25] one side the other side says amen
[34:28] thank you God for vindicating yourself
[34:31] showing me your very presence bringing
[34:34] forth the open word into my heart not

[37:43] against you sisters and you look at your
[37:47] life and you say I've I'm I'm a
[37:48] housewife what do I have to show for my
[37:52] life
[37:55] my this person and that person has this
[37:57] career and they did this and they did
[37:59] this I feel sorry for him
[38:02] they have they have all they have a
[38:04] career and they have this and they have
[38:06] that but where's the family
[38:09] where's the priorities where's God's
[38:12] word in this in this thing God looks at
[38:15] the Homemaker and the woman that raises
[38:18] her family and says there there is the
[38:20] Glorious
[38:21] one there is the worthy one that's what
[38:25] God is looking to and looking for
[38:28] but they were perverted until they
[38:30] become become so common that women
[38:32] become so common
[38:33] they they lived men lived with men the
[38:36] natural perversion from the sex cells
[38:38] and changed its positions because that
[38:40] women had become so cheap look brother
[38:43] Ben I'm speaking so straight
[38:45] every one of us knows what he's talking
[38:46] about we're living brother Branham was
[38:48] living in the seed time
[38:50] this was just a seed back then he was
[38:52] recognizing something that everybody
[38:54] else said was he talking about we're
[38:56] looking at I said my goodness is he
[38:58] living now
[39:00] prophetically he was living now yeah
[39:03] a few days ago I was over Tucson went to
[39:06] get a loaf of bread and there was a boy
[39:07] sitting out there and two little boys in
[39:09] the car another come in get a pack of
[39:11] cigarettes the old grade headed
[39:12] gentleman looked down said who is this
[39:14] cigarettes for your mother
[39:16] and he said well I think it's a rotten
[39:18] skipping some portions just to for
[39:20] brevity's sake and he said well I think
[39:23] it's a rotten shame today to see of how
[39:24] said used to be we put women on a
[39:26] pedestal said we honored her we took off
[39:29] our hat in her presence we walked down
[39:31] the streets and gentlemen would hear
[39:32] somebody make a remark about a certain
[39:34] woman they'd slap him down see and said
[39:37] they honored women
[39:39] but he said sir women has brought it on
[39:40] themselves
[39:42] said now they don't get up they used to
[39:44] get up in A Streetcar lady get up every
[39:46] man would take his hat off and let her
[39:47] sit down said now it's a push crowd said
[39:51] they have brought it on themselves and
[39:52] that's the truth
[39:53] the devil hole of Hollywood Yonder
[39:55] produced it out on the televisions and
[39:57] magazines though the thing has become a
[40:00] great big pot of Filth that's right
[40:04] what a perversion
[40:06] that's been produced out of
[40:08] entertainment
[40:10] it's a it's it's it's a deception
[40:13] and young people and all of us
[40:16] we we live around that and we see these
[40:19] things and what does it do if you if you
[40:22] feed on it too much and you're not
[40:23] acting with wisdom and discretion what
[40:26] happens you start to get pulled down and
[40:29] dragged down this direction and what
[40:32] what ends up happening oh why am I not
[40:34] living like that why am I they're those
[40:36] people have know nothing about life
[40:39] those people know nothing about what is
[40:43] good and what is right
[40:45] they don't know anything about how to
[40:46] live why do you think many of them are
[40:49] suicidal and using drugs and alcohol
[40:54] and they hate their lives
[40:56] don't try to be like them
[40:59] don't try to live like them
[41:01] all that is despair
[41:03] and destruction
[41:05] Revelation 17 4 and 5 5 and the woman
[41:08] was a raid in purple and scarlet color
[41:11] and Deck with gold and precious stones
[41:13] and Pearls having a golden cup in her
[41:16] hand full of Abominations and filthiness
[41:19] of her fornication and upon her forehead
[41:22] was a name written mystery Babylon the
[41:24] great the mother of harlots and
[41:26] Abominations of the Earth this was the
[41:29] fruit of her
[41:31] actions this is the fruit of the worldly
[41:35] Church
[41:37] she is clothed in her own clothes not
[41:40] what Christ provided what she has
[41:43] provided by deceiving the people
[41:47] and by and and by killing murdering the
[41:50] people the very fruit that she's fruit
[41:53] of the vine that she's drinking is
[41:55] actually the blood of the Saints
[41:58] that's what she's drinking this is
[42:00] Mystery Babylon the great mother of
[42:04] harlots so she's a mother
[42:07] it's not just the Roman Catholic Church
[42:09] the Orthodox church but the
[42:11] denominational systems as well they've
[42:12] entered into the same thing
[42:14] It's all under the Same Spirit many of
[42:17] the non-denominational churches of our
[42:18] day are the same
[42:21] they've provided their own clothing
[42:24] they provided their own riches they
[42:27] provided their own food provided their
[42:30] own drink and Christ is cast out of the
[42:34] church
[42:35] he's on the outside
[42:37] he's already sent a message
[42:40] knocking at that door
[42:43] it's that that's already been sent he's
[42:46] still knocking but the message has been
[42:48] sent it's been fulfilled he's knocked at
[42:51] the door and said come come out of her
[42:52] my people
[42:54] that message is still going forth and
[42:56] there's still people coming out
[42:58] but it's been sent
[43:00] and he's on the outside Christ has been
[43:03] manifested and put on display and they
[43:06] said we're rich and increase with goods
[43:08] and have need of nothing see exactly
[43:10] Isaiah 4 verse 1.
[43:13] let us be called by your name but we
[43:15] don't want anything to do with what
[43:17] you're delivering to us
[43:19] we don't want your Vindicated word
[43:21] we want our own theology
[43:24] but then on the other side Revelation 19
[43:27] 6-8 and I heard as it were the voice of
[43:29] a great multitude and as the voice of
[43:31] many Waters and is the voice of Mighty
[43:33] thundering saying Alleluia for the Lord
[43:35] God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad
[43:38] and rejoice and give honor to him for
[43:40] the marriage of the Lamb has come and
[43:41] his wife hath made herself ready
[43:45] and to her was granted that she should
[43:47] be arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[43:50] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[43:53] of saints relate this to
[43:56] Ephesians chapter 5 he washed Christ
[44:00] washes us with the washing of Water by
[44:04] the word
[44:06] he says this fight that fine linen is
[44:10] the righteousness of saints I want to
[44:12] ask you where did they get the fine
[44:14] linen do they make it themselves no that
[44:17] breaks up the type it was provided for
[44:19] them
[44:20] and he even washed it for them he
[44:22] provided it for them he washed it for
[44:24] them
[44:25] he brought everything to them so that
[44:28] she could make herself ready
[44:33] she said amen she was a recipient she
[44:36] received she in other words she entered
[44:39] she submitted
[44:40] to her husband
[44:43] she said she said yes
[44:45] I will serve you
[44:47] yes I will love you
[44:50] because the word was delivered she saw
[44:52] him she met him it's an invisible Union
[44:55] this is not a future invisible Union the
[44:58] invisible Union's going on right now
[45:00] we're waiting and we're gonna go to the
[45:02] marriage supper of the lamb but we're
[45:04] already married
[45:05] we're already joined invisibly
[45:08] Hallelujah so Ephesians 5 22-24
[45:14] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[45:16] husbands as unto the Lord
[45:20] wow
[45:22] nobody said amen
[45:27] not one sister said amen
[45:34] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[45:37] husbands as unto the Lord
[45:40] is that right this is a script this is
[45:42] scriptural truth
[45:44] this is not cultural
[45:46] this is not for historical reference
[45:49] this is for you today
[45:52] this is for you sisters who are wives to
[45:55] submit to your husbands and the next
[45:58] verse husband is the head of the wife
[46:00] even as Christ is the head of the church
[46:03] and he is the savior of the body
[46:06] therefore as the church is subject unto
[46:09] Christ
[46:10] so let the wives be to their own
[46:13] husbands in everything what if we say we
[46:17] want to live in a modern way in today's
[46:20] day and age
[46:21] and we want our husband it should be
[46:25] only a mutual submission
[46:28] that's what egalitarianism all through
[46:31] the church tells you denominational
[46:33] systems that's what they'll that's what
[46:35] they'll tell you it's only a mutual
[46:37] submission
[46:39] that's what they take this verse and
[46:41] they reinterpret it in 17 different ways
[46:44] and all of a sudden it's only a mutual
[46:47] submission that's it but the scripture
[46:51] says
[46:52] that the wives should be subject to
[46:54] their husbands in everything
[46:57] why is it said everything
[47:00] Why didn't it just say just just leave
[47:02] it at let their wives be subject to
[47:05] their own husbands
[47:09] see I'm trying to emphasize everybody
[47:11] feels uncomfortable and weird when you
[47:14] preach about this
[47:15] but you apply the Bible to your life
[47:20] and that's what we're supposed to do in
[47:22] the church that's what we're supposed to
[47:23] as Ministers of the Gospel we don't get
[47:26] to pick and choose even what we're
[47:28] preaching if the Lord lays something on
[47:30] our heart we that's where we go and if
[47:33] everybody kicks you out you just say
[47:35] thank you Lord I'm going to preach to
[47:36] the posts
[47:38] God is able from these posts to raise up
[47:40] children to Abraham
[47:44] and that that's the type Christ delivers
[47:46] the word and the church needs to be
[47:49] subject to that word
[47:52] see it's not we deliver the word and
[47:55] then then we're then Christ has to be
[47:57] subject to our judgments and our
[48:00] thoughts and our ideas
[48:02] no that's that's reversing the type
[48:05] that's what the whole church world does
[48:06] but you don't reverse the type
[48:09] there certainly is a mutual submission
[48:13] the verse just before that speaks about
[48:15] that submit to one another
[48:17] but then it goes into detail in the in
[48:20] the relationship of husband and wife
[48:23] the husband is the leader
[48:25] he is the head headship speaks of
[48:27] leadership
[48:29] a woman is to submit to her husband
[48:32] a husband
[48:35] should be the type of leader
[48:38] that loves his wife not as a dictator
[48:45] if we read the next verse husband love
[48:46] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[48:50] church and gave himself for it so we see
[48:53] that this love is characterized as
[48:57] self-sacrifice so it sees the need
[49:01] and it runs directly I think of what
[49:04] brother Jason has been preaching about
[49:06] this Christ ran directly to the need
[49:10] he didn't run away he had every
[49:12] opportunity to run away in Gethsemane
[49:14] it's a dark garden
[49:17] easy to slip away into the mountains no
[49:20] problem but he didn't do that he said
[49:23] who are you looking for see that was
[49:25] Christ rushing to meet the need of his
[49:28] bride
[49:29] see and that's husbands just as David he
[49:33] didn't run away from Goliath he ran
[49:35] directly to Goliath
[49:37] see and you as men you as husbands that
[49:42] should be your approach if there's
[49:44] danger if there's difficulty if if
[49:46] there's a need there you should run
[49:49] towards the need not not just say oh my
[49:53] wife will take care of that this will no
[49:55] you run towards the need to make sure
[49:58] that need is met in your family
[50:01] for your wife for your children that's
[50:03] your duty that's your love to your wife
[50:07] is to give yourself give of yourself
[50:10] that he Christ might sanctify and
[50:13] cleanse it with the washing of Water by
[50:16] the word that he might present it to
[50:18] himself a glorious church not having
[50:20] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[50:24] that it should be holy and without
[50:26] blemish see again this is Christ making
[50:30] the provision of what we have need of
[50:33] the church got spotted by
[50:35] denominationalism so what did he do he
[50:38] made the provision
[50:40] he sent a Reformation he sent Luther he
[50:43] sent Wesley sent he sent the the
[50:45] Pentecostal Revival and then he sent
[50:47] Malachi for brother branham's Ministry
[50:49] to restore us back to the original Faith
[50:51] he did what it took to wash us with the
[50:54] washing of Water by the word
[50:58] and that's our duty as husbands is to
[51:00] rush to meet those needs and sacrifice
[51:04] ourselves for our wives and love her in
[51:06] such a way that she would not
[51:08] begrudgingly submit herself sometimes
[51:11] wife you have to begrudgingly submit
[51:13] yourself to your husband because you've
[51:15] you feel like he doesn't deserve it but
[51:18] you're not obey you're doing it unto the
[51:20] Lord right
[51:22] and not unto men just like
[51:25] at your job you're you're doing your
[51:28] work as unto the Lord and not unto men
[51:31] same for you sisters to your husband
[51:33] sometimes you don't deserve it and so
[51:36] you're saying I'm doing it unto the Lord
[51:38] but husband don't live like that you
[51:40] don't deserve it
[51:42] we all do sometimes
[51:47] Genesis 3 16 under the woman he said I
[51:50] will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[51:53] conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring
[51:55] forth children and thy desire shall be
[51:58] to thy husband and he shall rule over
[52:00] thee
[52:02] this is the woman's curse
[52:04] the curse upon even all women after her
[52:07] and my goodness what what in the world
[52:09] does that have to do with eating an
[52:11] apple
[52:11] every time I read that it just is
[52:14] shocking to me that a person could
[52:15] believe from reading this verse that she
[52:18] ate an apple
[52:20] realize they're naked God says well
[52:22] since you use your teeth and your
[52:24] digestive system incorrectly I'm gonna
[52:26] curse a completely unrelated bodily
[52:30] system
[52:33] does it make sense to me
[52:35] so here here he speaks this your desire
[52:39] shall be to thy husband
[52:42] and he shall rule over thee this is part
[52:45] of the curse
[52:47] his ruling over her now
[52:50] we'll comment more on that later but I
[52:52] want to read this before I do
[52:54] First Timothy 2 12-14 but I suffer not a
[52:57] woman to teach nor to use serp authority
[52:59] over the man to be in silence for Adam
[53:02] was first form then Eve and Adam was not
[53:05] deceived but the woman being deceived
[53:08] was in the transgression
[53:10] so let's take that understanding that
[53:13] thought right there
[53:14] back to this
[53:16] people say that
[53:18] this is what they use to justify
[53:21] what they call egalitarianism
[53:25] and so when I when I say that is it's
[53:27] only Mutual submission there's no
[53:29] husband a wife submitted to a husband
[53:32] that's all done away with they think in
[53:35] in the gospel
[53:37] because they say that the curse puts the
[53:40] husband as the ruler over the woman and
[53:43] therefore the gospel takes that curse
[53:46] away now men and women are equal in
[53:49] every way
[53:51] and she can preach and
[53:53] have leadership positions in the church
[53:55] and all those things never mind what
[53:58] Paul said we don't have to listen to
[54:00] Paul we like what Jesus said you don't
[54:02] even know what Jesus said if you say you
[54:04] like what Jesus said
[54:07] you have you have no clue but that's the
[54:09] first step of apostasy over and over
[54:12] again is that they say that was what
[54:15] Paul said not what Jesus said
[54:17] so if anybody says that you see you you
[54:20] can just simply say
[54:22] I'm so sorry you just took the first
[54:25] step to apostasy
[54:27] and so
[54:29] here we have
[54:30] the curse saying he shall rule over her
[54:33] but understand this word rule doesn't
[54:36] merely mean headship or leadership it
[54:39] means rule with rigor
[54:42] so now the woman is put in this
[54:44] relationship that her desires to her be
[54:47] to her husband and now because of sin he
[54:51] is going to rule her as though she is
[54:54] only his property
[54:56] and that you find that throughout
[54:58] history if you study it closely that
[55:01] this was the approach that all ancient
[55:03] cultures took
[55:04] all of them
[55:09] Christ does bring Redemption but he
[55:12] doesn't change this role as you'll see
[55:14] it isn't the curse that made Adam the
[55:18] head
[55:20] that's not the curse that made Adam the
[55:21] head
[55:23] look what it says
[55:25] why
[55:27] is a woman not allowed to teach and
[55:29] preach and handle God's word or usurp
[55:32] authority over the man it doesn't say
[55:34] because of the curse because it says
[55:36] because Adam was first formed then Eve
[55:40] so by God's design Adam had headship
[55:47] and the woman was under submission
[55:51] now we'll talk about the Redemption in
[55:53] Christ Jesus a little bit
[55:57] just in a few moments First Corinthians
[55:59] 3 7 likewise
[56:01] you husbands dwell with them according
[56:03] to knowledge giving honor unto the wife
[56:05] as unto a weaker vessel and as being
[56:07] heirs together of the grace of life that
[56:09] your prayers be not hindered so here
[56:14] Peter is speaking
[56:16] live with her according to knowledge
[56:19] what knowledge Peter
[56:22] well a lot of people have different
[56:25] interpretations for it but if the very
[56:27] verse speaks of it right there
[56:30] what knowledge are we to have
[56:34] she's a weaker vessel
[56:36] physically she's weaker that's very
[56:39] clear you don't have to be a tremendous
[56:43] scientist and biologist
[56:46] to know that although you'd think think
[56:49] so today because all our biologists and
[56:52] scientists say that that's not true
[56:55] but it's merely a propaganda put forward
[56:59] by this feminist culture and feminist
[57:03] Society a woman is weaker than a man
[57:07] it's very clear
[57:09] God God designed them us that way
[57:13] that's the first thing to have an
[57:15] understanding of she's a weaker vessel
[57:18] what's the next thing to have an
[57:19] understanding that your heirs together
[57:21] of the grace of life
[57:24] so these are the things that these are
[57:25] the knowledge that we should have
[57:28] in our relationship with our wives men
[57:31] why is that important well she is not an
[57:35] heir of of God's grace through you or
[57:38] because of you
[57:39] she is directly an heir of CR of Grace
[57:44] directly your your co-heirs together see
[57:48] you you equally have a relationship if
[57:51] in a relationship the husband has no
[57:53] relationship with Christ and the wife
[57:55] has a relationship with Christ
[57:58] we want to change that
[58:01] but that's that's nothing's hindering
[58:03] her from her walk with the Lord if her
[58:06] husband isn't
[58:08] see now there'll be hindrances and
[58:10] there'll be difficulties and there'll be
[58:11] trials that's not something that Paul
[58:13] suggests
[58:15] or or speaks about but he does speak
[58:17] about how to do it
[58:19] Peter speaks about how to how to win
[58:21] your husband
[58:23] and so but these are the these are the
[58:25] things of knowledge that we should have
[58:29] and giving honor to the wife see we're
[58:32] to give honor
[58:34] we're to live in such a way that it
[58:37] would be characterized by Honor towards
[58:40] our wife there's no uh you know my wife
[58:42] she does this you know these kind of
[58:45] comments we should be the biggest
[58:46] Defender
[58:48] of our wives we should be the people
[58:51] that say if someone says a word against
[58:52] our wife it should be close to a fight
[58:56] you say you say you're a preacher
[58:59] advocating for fighting I'm a preacher
[59:01] advocating for honoring your wife to the
[59:03] point that it's not acceptable for
[59:06] anyone to say a word against my wife
[59:09] it's not acceptable I don't accept it
[59:11] period
[59:14] because she has a place of honor in my
[59:16] heart
[59:20] and he says your if if you don't live
[59:23] this way if you don't dwell with her
[59:26] according to this knowledge your prayers
[59:29] will be hindered
[59:31] so it's a hindrance to your spiritual
[59:33] life men if you're not living with your
[59:36] wife in this way with this understanding
[59:44] see we have this treasure in Earthen
[59:45] vessels so that that's to look back here
[59:48] she is the weaker vessel it's speaking
[59:51] of how our bodies are designed even
[59:55] further you could say and look I gotta
[59:57] get rid of this thing I'm gonna be
[59:59] sweating through everything
[1:00:01] for the first time brother Matt I'm
[1:00:03] getting rid of my jacket
[1:00:07] so
[1:00:10] let's move on let's move on I got so
[1:00:12] much to to go through so men and women
[1:00:15] are equal
[1:00:17] but not the same
[1:00:20] created for a different purpose men and
[1:00:23] women are different at the cellular
[1:00:25] level every cell is marked as either
[1:00:28] female male or female
[1:00:31] all of our DNA is impacting every aspect
[1:00:34] of our bodies and it's all marked male
[1:00:37] or female men have denser bones larger
[1:00:40] hands greater muscle mass men tend to be
[1:00:43] more aggressive and as a result have a
[1:00:44] greater tendency to be attracted to
[1:00:46] conflict and competition and Leadership
[1:00:48] women women tend to be attracted to
[1:00:50] nurturing and relationship building
[1:00:53] men tend to compartmentalize women tend
[1:00:57] to connect men are wired to lead women
[1:01:01] are wired to nurture or I would say
[1:01:03] influence
[1:01:06] I want to see I want you to see Jesus
[1:01:10] approach to women I want you to
[1:01:13] understand what the normal approach to
[1:01:16] women was in by the rabbis in the days
[1:01:19] of Jesus
[1:01:21] even to this day
[1:01:23] we're gonna we're gonna go to Israel my
[1:01:25] wife will be with me she cannot come
[1:01:28] with me to the to the side of the the
[1:01:30] Western Wall that I can go to she has
[1:01:33] another place to go to here's a little
[1:01:35] spot for the women over here here's the
[1:01:37] big spot and a whole air conditioned
[1:01:39] thing for the men
[1:01:40] see and that's that's how the
[1:01:44] Jewish rabbis of those days looked at it
[1:01:47] women were not allowed to listen to and
[1:01:53] follow the rabbi they had no school for
[1:01:56] training women
[1:01:58] to know the word of God
[1:02:00] they didn't want women to even know the
[1:02:03] word of God other than how to keep a
[1:02:05] kosher house
[1:02:07] that's all that's all they needed to
[1:02:09] know the rest were for men
[1:02:11] there was never a rabbi that had a woman
[1:02:13] following her around following him
[1:02:15] around never it was unthought of unheard
[1:02:18] of and it didn't happen
[1:02:21] right so look let's look at the Lord
[1:02:23] Jesus and see if he takes the same
[1:02:24] approach
[1:02:26] who also when he was in Galilee followed
[1:02:28] him and Minister unto him and many other
[1:02:30] women
[1:02:31] which came up with him unto Jerusalem so
[1:02:35] here's this strange rabbi
[1:02:38] who's got men disciples and he's got
[1:02:41] women following him
[1:02:43] serving him and listening and feeding on
[1:02:46] the word of God
[1:02:50] Mark 16 9-11 now when Jesus was risen
[1:02:52] early the first day of the week he
[1:02:54] appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of
[1:02:57] whom he had cast Seven Devils
[1:03:00] she went and told them that had been
[1:03:02] with him as they mourned and wept and
[1:03:04] they when they had heard that he was
[1:03:05] alive had been seen of her believe not
[1:03:09] now in those in that time
[1:03:12] in that day and age if you wanted to
[1:03:14] have make up a story
[1:03:16] about
[1:03:18] something Supernatural like this you
[1:03:20] would definitely never have a woman
[1:03:22] involved
[1:03:24] if the first you tell the story people
[1:03:27] would look at you going
[1:03:29] I wouldn't mention that part
[1:03:32] the woman was the first one to see him
[1:03:34] that's that's
[1:03:37] but God sovereignly ordained this
[1:03:40] circumstance that the very first person
[1:03:45] to meet him was Mary Magdalene
[1:03:47] amen not because he wanted to make women
[1:03:49] preachers
[1:03:51] but this was a woman who had a testimony
[1:03:54] and she went and told it
[1:03:56] that's that's you have a sisters you
[1:03:59] have a testimony
[1:04:00] tell it
[1:04:02] so he he brings her she sees him they go
[1:04:05] and tell him and guess what they thought
[1:04:09] woman crazy woman
[1:04:11] they didn't believe her
[1:04:15] this was the norm of the society at this
[1:04:17] point in time but this was not Jesus
[1:04:19] approach this was a this was a
[1:04:21] correction
[1:04:24] John 4 7 there cometh a woman of Samaria
[1:04:27] to draw water
[1:04:28] Jesus saith unto her give me to drink
[1:04:33] Jesus said I must need to go by Samaria
[1:04:37] okay the disciples didn't like that much
[1:04:39] they didn't like Samaritans
[1:04:42] they didn't want to come near Samaritans
[1:04:44] and Samaritans hated them
[1:04:47] so strange and then the next thing they
[1:04:49] know they go off to get food and they
[1:04:52] come back and he's talking to a
[1:04:53] prostitute
[1:04:56] but what was it he was sent there for
[1:05:00] that predestinated seed in that woman
[1:05:03] that that is the value
[1:05:06] that Jesus has
[1:05:08] for men and for women
[1:05:10] see he's gonna he's not just gonna go
[1:05:12] after some man he's going after that
[1:05:15] predestinated seat and it's in both men
[1:05:17] and women
[1:05:20] she goes out she says come see a man
[1:05:22] which told me all things that ever I did
[1:05:23] is not this the Christ then they went
[1:05:25] out of the city and came unto him again
[1:05:27] he goes to Samaria and he has a the very
[1:05:30] first person that's testifying of him is
[1:05:32] a pro ill-famed woman
[1:05:35] strange way of doing things but this is
[1:05:38] God's Sovereign leadership and work he's
[1:05:42] setting things in order
[1:05:46] Proverbs 31
[1:05:49] I'm going I'm gonna I'm just gonna
[1:05:51] reference that and I'm gonna read to you
[1:05:53] the points that come from that
[1:05:55] because up
[1:05:59] I'm not going to get anywhere near where
[1:06:01] I need to get this time so The Virtuous
[1:06:03] Woman She's trustworthy she seeks wool
[1:06:06] and flax willingly works with her hands
[1:06:08] plans and provides a variety of foods
[1:06:11] for household Rises early in the morning
[1:06:13] to prepare a meal for the family she
[1:06:16] looks Works along with her husband to
[1:06:18] expand the household business and
[1:06:20] finances so she considers a field and
[1:06:23] buys it and plants a Vineyard
[1:06:25] she inspects the things her household is
[1:06:27] producing and will do what it takes to
[1:06:30] make sure that it's quality she works on
[1:06:32] providing clothing for a family she has
[1:06:34] a heart heart to provide for the poor
[1:06:37] she doesn't fear various seasons of life
[1:06:39] because she makes provision for them and
[1:06:41] trusts God through them
[1:06:42] she prospers from hard work and so does
[1:06:45] her family her husband is honored
[1:06:47] because of her
[1:06:49] she not only supplies for the needs of
[1:06:50] her family she makes additional
[1:06:52] materials and sells them she's a strong
[1:06:54] and honorable woman she's wise and kind
[1:06:57] she's not idle or lazy her focus is not
[1:07:01] on outward Beauty and charm but on the
[1:07:04] character that's produced by the fear of
[1:07:08] the Lord
[1:07:09] if you ever read through Proverbs 31
[1:07:12] Woman these are the things that it's
[1:07:14] talking about it's incredible when you
[1:07:16] see it now if you look at it again it's
[1:07:18] a problem I've said this in in the uh
[1:07:21] Sunday school but this is a proverb it's
[1:07:24] not saying you have to go out and do
[1:07:25] every single bullet point it's saying
[1:07:28] this is the characterization of The
[1:07:31] Godly woman
[1:07:36] in the sermon the Rapture now when I say
[1:07:39] when I say that I want you to understand
[1:07:42] it's the characterization of a Godly
[1:07:45] woman
[1:07:46] now where in that did it speak about
[1:07:49] having a great education
[1:07:52] where in that did it I'm not against I'm
[1:07:55] not advocating ignorance
[1:07:58] I'm saying the vision of God
[1:08:02] for sisters
[1:08:05] for young women
[1:08:06] for women is this that he's putting
[1:08:09] pushing forward that he's putting
[1:08:11] forward this is an industrious person
[1:08:13] this is not a lazy person this is not
[1:08:16] someone that isn't doing things but the
[1:08:19] values of this world are not
[1:08:23] in that
[1:08:24] in those verses what this world values
[1:08:27] what's important to this world this
[1:08:30] world's education system is of what God
[1:08:34] no not God this world's approach to
[1:08:38] family is from
[1:08:40] the devil
[1:08:41] okay so then we should take God's
[1:08:44] approach
[1:08:45] to Womanhood
[1:08:48] and God's approach to manhood
[1:08:54] this message isn't about that but I just
[1:08:56] feel on my heart three different times
[1:08:58] Paul speaks about the importance of
[1:09:00] working with your hands to men
[1:09:03] he speaks of that
[1:09:05] and not of all of us are built that way
[1:09:07] to work with your hands I am not a
[1:09:10] person that is good at working with my
[1:09:12] hands brother Aaron Brother Brad brother
[1:09:15] Matt good at working with their hands
[1:09:16] brother Chris Travis
[1:09:19] Tony you don't feel left out if I left
[1:09:21] somebody out forgive me
[1:09:25] Brother John
[1:09:27] everybody but me
[1:09:30] and Caleb
[1:09:38] but the point being is God is giving a
[1:09:40] vision of working hard learning to work
[1:09:42] hard you look at today what is the world
[1:09:45] going towards it's moving all men away
[1:09:47] from his feminizing men
[1:09:49] and what God what the word of God is
[1:09:51] saying work with your hands so young men
[1:09:54] learn a trade learn how to work with
[1:09:56] your hands if you go towards a trade you
[1:09:59] will be a wealthy person you will make
[1:10:01] money because ain't nobody wants to do
[1:10:03] that anymore
[1:10:05] now there's nobody clamoring to work in
[1:10:09] the sewer system
[1:10:11] if you go work in the sewer system you
[1:10:12] will make money
[1:10:14] if you go work as a plumber all these
[1:10:17] different things HVAC
[1:10:19] carpentry you will be able to make money
[1:10:22] to do what to provide for a family to
[1:10:25] have a wife to have children this is
[1:10:27] God's vision for us very few people are
[1:10:30] called to be like Paul was and be single
[1:10:33] most of us are called to have families
[1:10:36] and so sisters God's not calling you to
[1:10:39] have a great education and a great
[1:10:41] career
[1:10:42] you might have one you you might have to
[1:10:45] do that okay there's situations and
[1:10:48] circumstances that demand that but most
[1:10:51] of all the vision that God has pointing
[1:10:54] us to is not that
[1:10:59] why why am I how education and wisdom of
[1:11:02] this world has turned the church into a
[1:11:04] bunch of ragweeds
[1:11:06] it's exactly
[1:11:08] this is prophetic because this is
[1:11:10] exactly what it is think about 1965.
[1:11:14] was that true
[1:11:17] in seed form
[1:11:19] my goodness aren't you longing to go
[1:11:21] back to the good old days of 1965 when
[1:11:24] people respected God's word what do they
[1:11:27] what do they look at it today but it was
[1:11:29] in seed for him he's this is a prophet
[1:11:31] looking ahead to our day and age
[1:11:35] it's just a bunch of ragweeds
[1:11:39] it's education and the educational
[1:11:41] system and Science and civilization is
[1:11:44] of the devil it's the devil's
[1:11:46] civilization the Bible said so
[1:11:49] don't go don't say oh that's brother
[1:11:52] Branham
[1:11:53] but he says education's okay no don't
[1:11:56] just take a minute now
[1:11:58] think about this because what is our
[1:12:01] educational system especially in America
[1:12:03] but worldwide going towards you what is
[1:12:06] it training you towards
[1:12:07] if it's not training you to learn a
[1:12:09] trade it's training you to be a
[1:12:11] wonderful communist
[1:12:13] that's what it's training to be that's
[1:12:16] what our elementary school is going
[1:12:18] towards that's what middle school or
[1:12:20] whatever you call it here is going
[1:12:21] towards that's what high school is going
[1:12:23] towards and that's what
[1:12:26] general education in University and
[1:12:30] colleges is pointing you towards
[1:12:32] that's what it's going towards you want
[1:12:34] to sit in front of that and feed on that
[1:12:37] you want to be indoctrinated into that
[1:12:40] you want to spend 10 10 20 30 000 a year
[1:12:45] on that
[1:12:46] go learn to work with your hands young
[1:12:49] men
[1:12:50] learn to be a keeper at home sisters
[1:12:55] that is not what I told you is not of
[1:12:57] the devil you might not like it
[1:13:00] but it's not it's from God
[1:13:03] this system of education is of the devil
[1:13:08] and that applies worldwide if you're an
[1:13:10] Islamic country if you're in a Catholic
[1:13:13] country if you're in a secular country
[1:13:17] it's all of the devil
[1:13:22] cultures change but the word of God does
[1:13:26] not change
[1:13:28] our world has changed so drastically
[1:13:31] over the last
[1:13:32] 220 years
[1:13:35] it's almost unrecognizable to the world
[1:13:37] before that
[1:13:40] and see this was all part of the
[1:13:42] development of Satan's Eden
[1:13:45] brother Brandon so adeptly says and
[1:13:48] prophetically says
[1:13:49] no other age is referred to as the God
[1:13:53] of this evil age other than our age
[1:13:55] of course Satan was the root has been
[1:13:57] the ruler since the Fall In the Garden
[1:14:00] of Eden but it's been so congealed today
[1:14:03] everything about our age is designed
[1:14:08] by the devil
[1:14:10] to come against what God is doing
[1:14:13] in the bride of Christ
[1:14:15] so number one
[1:14:17] prior to the Industrial Revolution we
[1:14:21] had agrarian societies divided into
[1:14:23] landowners and lower classes
[1:14:27] then in the 1700s and 1800s the
[1:14:29] Industrial Revolution came husbands and
[1:14:32] wives roles during The Agrarian time
[1:14:35] very obvious
[1:14:37] very clear very Undisputed
[1:14:41] didn't matter if you were a Muslim or a
[1:14:44] Christian or whatever you were you had
[1:14:48] you had a it was easy to understand what
[1:14:51] the roles were
[1:14:54] but now the Industrial Revolution comes
[1:14:57] and then what happens is
[1:14:59] it becomes a confusion begins
[1:15:02] the roles start out clear
[1:15:05] they start to get muddier during
[1:15:07] industry the birth of Industry brought
[1:15:10] forth what
[1:15:11] women and child labor
[1:15:13] outside of the home and it destroyed
[1:15:17] lives those those corporations all they
[1:15:20] cared and those companies all they cared
[1:15:22] about was that turning a profit they
[1:15:24] damaged and killed millions of people
[1:15:27] around the world world in order to
[1:15:29] produce Mass produce their products and
[1:15:32] send them throughout the world even
[1:15:34] starting in the 1700s
[1:15:36] it's horrible if you read the history
[1:15:38] about it these things that happened and
[1:15:40] the breakdown of society that happened
[1:15:43] in the world over but is you can read
[1:15:45] about it very easily in England where
[1:15:47] now you have what they call the street
[1:15:49] urchins
[1:15:50] little little boys and little girls
[1:15:52] whose parents are on the bottle
[1:15:55] drunk drunks and not providing for their
[1:15:58] families just going to work and drinking
[1:16:00] the rest of their time away in misery
[1:16:02] and children fending for themselves by
[1:16:04] the tens of thousands on the streets of
[1:16:06] England
[1:16:08] and around the world
[1:16:10] that's the birth of Industry that's the
[1:16:13] birth of the middle class what a great
[1:16:14] elevation
[1:16:15] that they achieved
[1:16:18] the age of mass production then is after
[1:16:22] the birth of Industry that further blurs
[1:16:26] the lines that's where you see women
[1:16:28] entering into the work workplace
[1:16:31] that's where you see a man going off to
[1:16:34] War and the workplace full of women
[1:16:37] and the home the home where's what's
[1:16:40] where's where are the children they're
[1:16:42] being sent off to indoctrination School
[1:16:47] then we go get to the digital Revolution
[1:16:50] and where's the Lions we don't know what
[1:16:53] lines are the lines don't even exist
[1:16:56] and the result of all this is that
[1:16:58] nobody knows even what a woman is
[1:17:00] anymore or what a man is you go to a
[1:17:03] university professor today
[1:17:05] go to any University
[1:17:06] what's a woman
[1:17:08] you can go they have gender studies can
[1:17:11] you imagine
[1:17:12] what is gender studies going to do for
[1:17:14] anybody
[1:17:16] make them an idiot that's what it's
[1:17:18] going to do
[1:17:20] make them a complete ignoramus see why
[1:17:25] would anyone take such a class well it's
[1:17:27] indoctrination
[1:17:29] what is a Woman They say well it's
[1:17:31] someone who says they're a woman well
[1:17:33] what is that
[1:17:37] no idea
[1:17:42] so now here we get to Glass this time
[1:17:47] so Encyclopedia Britannica
[1:17:50] speaking of women wearing pants now
[1:17:53] these things coincide all together
[1:17:56] while there were some women who
[1:17:57] championed pants in the 19th century
[1:17:59] pants as an acceptable everyday clothing
[1:18:01] option for women didn't truly catch on
[1:18:04] until the mid 20th century there were
[1:18:06] short-lived revivals of pants wearing in
[1:18:09] public by women such as during World War
[1:18:11] One when civilian women who took over
[1:18:14] jobs traditionally held by men sometimes
[1:18:15] wore pants during World War II pants
[1:18:18] were more widely worn by civilian and
[1:18:20] military women both at work and socially
[1:18:22] although women continue to enjoy wearing
[1:18:25] pants after the war particularly for
[1:18:28] sport or Leisure style trends for women
[1:18:30] remain fixated largely on skirts or
[1:18:33] dresses until the 60s and 70s then
[1:18:36] buoyed by the women's right right in
[1:18:38] their own thing the inspiration of it
[1:18:42] then buoyed by the women's rights
[1:18:44] movement pants became firmly established
[1:18:46] as popular and appropriate clothing
[1:18:48] options for women at home in public and
[1:18:52] in many workplaces
[1:18:56] Smithsonian Institute see this is
[1:18:58] mainstream just telling it like it is
[1:19:02] you don't even hardly have to be
[1:19:04] spiritual to understand that this is not
[1:19:06] connected with the spirit of God
[1:19:09] by the 1920s it was fashionable for
[1:19:11] women particularly in cities to where
[1:19:13] more conspicuous makeup
[1:19:15] this shift reflected the growing
[1:19:17] influence of Hollywood and its glamorous
[1:19:19] new film stars as well as the fashion of
[1:19:22] theater stars and Flappers painted women
[1:19:25] could now also listen identify as
[1:19:29] respectable women they weren't
[1:19:31] respectable women but they were
[1:19:33] identifying as such
[1:19:35] even as they wore dramatic mascara
[1:19:37] eyeliner Dusky eyeshadow and lipstick
[1:19:40] like the stars of the screen
[1:19:47] this is the Denver Public Library
[1:19:49] Western history resources in 1920 an
[1:19:52] estimated 5 000 Beauty parlors were in
[1:19:54] operation in the United States by 1930
[1:19:57] that number jumped to over forty
[1:19:58] thousand the cause of all this growth
[1:20:01] growth meet the Bob and the wave Bob's
[1:20:05] short hairstyles cut straight around the
[1:20:06] head usually around jaw level were
[1:20:08] sported by a few women in the 1910s most
[1:20:11] notably listened by designer Coco Chanel
[1:20:15] dancer Irene Castle and actress singer
[1:20:18] polar the anticipant antithesis of the
[1:20:22] long pinned up or braided hairstyles
[1:20:24] that had dominated Western women's
[1:20:26] fashion for nearly seven centuries
[1:20:29] bobbed hair was at first a daring symbol
[1:20:32] of feminism and individuality
[1:20:36] as clear as I'm going to preach on it I
[1:20:38] just read it and we'll move on
[1:20:41] they look however the look however
[1:20:43] gained widespread appeal in the 1920s as
[1:20:45] film stars like Gloria Swanson Clara
[1:20:48] Beau and Louise Brooks popularized the
[1:20:50] style in general women's hairstyles in
[1:20:52] the 1920s aspired to be exotic and Sleek
[1:20:55] with hair worn close to the head if one
[1:20:58] had long hair it was pulled back in a
[1:21:00] small low whatever that word is
[1:21:02] Bobs were cut into in tapered layers so
[1:21:05] that the hair would lie as flat as
[1:21:07] possible by the mid-1920s the fat of
[1:21:10] bobbing had arrived in the mainstream
[1:21:12] they were they were there were short
[1:21:14] boyish Bobs like Josephine Bakers and
[1:21:17] even faux Bob's long-haired deceptively
[1:21:20] pinned up so you see this direction is
[1:21:24] coming from Hollywood
[1:21:27] it's coming from
[1:21:29] the societal the Civilized civilization
[1:21:32] developments that the devil has inspired
[1:21:38] so going along with that is what I've
[1:21:40] spoken of is feminism
[1:21:42] first wave of feminism was
[1:21:46] in the 18th century late 18th century
[1:21:49] through through 19th century promotion
[1:21:52] of equal contract and property rights
[1:21:54] for women in the opposition to chattel
[1:21:56] marriage and ownership of married women
[1:21:59] and their children by their husbands
[1:22:00] however by the end of 19th century
[1:22:02] active activism focused primarily on
[1:22:05] gaining political power particularly the
[1:22:09] right of women's suffrage
[1:22:12] second wave women's Liberation
[1:22:15] challenging the cultural and legal
[1:22:17] validity of the patriarchy and the
[1:22:19] social and sexual hierarchies used to
[1:22:21] control and limit the legal and physical
[1:22:24] independence of women in society
[1:22:27] third wave see these are these are the
[1:22:30] waves of satanic Revival
[1:22:34] Satan's Revival sent on a society and
[1:22:38] then the church is right behind that you
[1:22:40] see both the church see this is you can
[1:22:43] put this these are liberals
[1:22:45] yeah
[1:22:46] come on okay but remember that the
[1:22:48] conservatives are just a little bit
[1:22:50] further back response to the liberals so
[1:22:53] as the Liberals go left the
[1:22:56] conservatives follow them this way
[1:23:00] don't don't be deceived
[1:23:05] and so this is dismantling
[1:23:09] any gender roles whatsoever and you can
[1:23:13] see what the results are
[1:23:15] what's produced this madness
[1:23:17] of you can you can choose your gender
[1:23:20] gender isn't based on biology gender is
[1:23:23] uh social construct uh if you're a woman
[1:23:27] and you feel like you're a man you can
[1:23:28] say you're a man if you're a man you
[1:23:29] feel like a woman you could say you're a
[1:23:31] woman where's that coming from it's
[1:23:34] directly connected to the slide the
[1:23:38] downward slide of feminism
[1:23:41] dismantling of society the dismantling
[1:23:44] of God's plan for the family the God's
[1:23:49] plan for a man and God's plan for a
[1:23:51] woman
[1:23:52] they've dismantled it they've fought
[1:23:54] against it they've done everything to
[1:23:56] battle against it
[1:23:57] and
[1:23:59] in society they've prevailed but in the
[1:24:02] true bride of Christ they have not
[1:24:04] prevailed
[1:24:05] we're pushing back against it we're
[1:24:07] fighting against it and we're never
[1:24:09] going to compromise and we're never
[1:24:10] we're never going to back off in fact
[1:24:13] we're going to push harder and we're
[1:24:14] going to fight harder as time goes on
[1:24:16] because God has a plan for you and
[1:24:18] that's the place of blessing that's the
[1:24:21] place of joy is doing it God's way
[1:24:24] doing it the world's way is the place of
[1:24:27] destruction
[1:24:29] sorrow
[1:24:33] First Corinthians 6 9 and this is the
[1:24:35] result of all of this is feminization of
[1:24:39] manhood
[1:24:41] and the feminization of the church
[1:24:44] look what Paul says know ye not that the
[1:24:46] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[1:24:48] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[1:24:52] fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers
[1:24:55] nor effeminate
[1:24:58] nor abusers of themselves with Mankind
[1:25:00] and Paul goes on but I just want to pull
[1:25:03] that word effeminate
[1:25:06] God looks at this and it's an
[1:25:08] Abomination to him it says those who are
[1:25:10] going towards effeminism cannot enter
[1:25:13] the kingdom of God
[1:25:15] a man dressed to dress like a man a
[1:25:18] woman should dress like a woman
[1:25:21] and act like a woman a man should act
[1:25:23] like a man when a man begins to act like
[1:25:26] a woman he's effeminate
[1:25:30] it's exactly right brother Jason it's a
[1:25:32] spirit on the man
[1:25:34] pushing him towards that
[1:25:36] pulling him towards that and he must be
[1:25:38] delivered from that evil spirit
[1:25:41] and get because Paul in this says and
[1:25:43] such were some of you but you're washed
[1:25:45] you're Justified
[1:25:47] by the spirit of our God
[1:25:50] and so
[1:25:51] but you have to be washed you have to
[1:25:53] repent
[1:25:54] you can't remain if you can't get the
[1:25:56] Holy Ghost and remain effeminate
[1:25:59] when you get the Holy Ghost it makes a
[1:26:01] man into a man and it makes a woman into
[1:26:03] a woman
[1:26:08] so culture became feminized man now is
[1:26:12] portrayed as a self-centered dummy led
[1:26:16] by wise and Powerful women
[1:26:21] deadening of Manliness comes from video
[1:26:24] game addiction
[1:26:25] also the proliferation of estrogens and
[1:26:28] food water and clothing
[1:26:31] women work and lead the family if the
[1:26:34] man works too but he remains
[1:26:35] disconnected unaware
[1:26:37] just whatever his wife tells him to do
[1:26:39] go this way okay uh or this way now do
[1:26:42] the that's that's what modern man is all
[1:26:47] masculinity becomes toxic
[1:26:51] so a man being a man is not acceptable
[1:26:55] in today's society
[1:26:56] you should shut up and sit down
[1:26:59] that's that's the that's the approach of
[1:27:02] our society
[1:27:04] men respond to this by checking out well
[1:27:10] just enjoy my video games and my sports
[1:27:12] and my beer
[1:27:15] or by becoming more like women
[1:27:18] well if if if it's only acceptable
[1:27:22] for me to show leadership if I act like
[1:27:25] a woman I'll just become one
[1:27:33] brother Branham speaks of the perversion
[1:27:35] of the food supply
[1:27:37] did you read this year this month's
[1:27:39] Reader's Digest that men and women of
[1:27:41] this day little girls from 20 or 25
[1:27:43] years old is in menopause
[1:27:45] that you go through the change of life
[1:27:47] and the middle age of life according to
[1:27:49] science between 20 and 25 used to be
[1:27:51] around 30 or 35 of my age and my
[1:27:53] mother's age a woman never struck
[1:27:55] menopause still she was 45.
[1:27:58] 40 or 45 what is it it's through science
[1:28:00] and the food the hybrids that's
[1:28:02] perverted the whole human body until
[1:28:04] we've become a bunch of massive
[1:28:05] corruption well if the physical being is
[1:28:08] corrupted isn't the brain cell in that
[1:28:10] physical being
[1:28:17] in thirst he says but the way they are
[1:28:19] on the street today haircut like a man
[1:28:21] wearing men's clothes and then men turn
[1:28:23] around wearing women's clothes and a
[1:28:25] haircut like a woman see it's a
[1:28:26] perversion the whole thing your food is
[1:28:28] perverted your life is perverted your
[1:28:30] thirst perverted your desire is
[1:28:31] perverted it's a day of perversion
[1:28:36] so estrogen is everywhere
[1:28:39] soy is in every snack soy is a
[1:28:41] phytoestrogen so he's in every snack so
[1:28:44] he's in baby formula vegetable oils and
[1:28:47] every snack it's in meat and dairy
[1:28:49] products and tap water bottled water
[1:28:50] bpas and Plastics phthalates and lotion
[1:28:53] make up laundry Products plastic wrap
[1:28:54] birth control pills in our water supply
[1:28:58] and what is that resulting in
[1:29:00] testosterone is suppressed
[1:29:02] when there is excess estrogen in your
[1:29:05] system
[1:29:06] when suppressed from Young ages of
[1:29:09] development it leads to the feminization
[1:29:12] of boys
[1:29:18] over the past 50 years human sperm
[1:29:20] counts appear to have fallen by more
[1:29:22] than 50 percent around the globe
[1:29:25] according to an updated review of
[1:29:27] medical literature
[1:29:29] there's an incr In from from this
[1:29:31] proliferation of estrogen there's an
[1:29:33] increase of risk of breast and cervical
[1:29:35] cancer weight gain
[1:29:37] fibroids in the uterus fatigue enlarged
[1:29:40] breasts in men high blood pressure blood
[1:29:43] clots Etc what a corruption
[1:29:46] that Satan has put on this evil age
[1:29:50] and you see in every direction you see
[1:29:53] this taking place as science
[1:29:55] civilization
[1:29:56] education is all of the devil Satan has
[1:30:00] worked for the last 250 years to produce
[1:30:04] what we have today
[1:30:06] both in our in the foods that we eat
[1:30:10] in the educational system that we have
[1:30:13] in the entertainment system that we have
[1:30:17] in the news corporations that we have
[1:30:20] I mean you can't even read the news
[1:30:22] anymore what's what's the truth you have
[1:30:25] no idea
[1:30:26] all of them are simply propaganda
[1:30:28] machines
[1:30:29] everything is spun it's just like uh
[1:30:32] John Collins
[1:30:35] all kinds we got all these facts here
[1:30:37] let me show you all these facts
[1:30:40] I have documents I have this I have that
[1:30:42] but it really means this
[1:30:44] and it really means that okay CNN
[1:30:51] MSNBC
[1:30:54] you can't you can't trust the Spin
[1:30:56] Doctors that's what they all that every
[1:30:58] one of them is Spinda that's the society
[1:31:00] we live in
[1:31:01] what where can we go to what can we
[1:31:03] trust I'll suggest that we have a book
[1:31:07] here
[1:31:08] that God inspired the men that wrote it
[1:31:11] we can put our trust in every word in it
[1:31:13] and furthermore he sent a prophet to
[1:31:16] vindicate the Revelation that's
[1:31:18] contained inside of this book
[1:31:20] and so he he manifested himself put
[1:31:23] himself on display and we can put our
[1:31:25] confidence in that
[1:31:28] not in the arm of flesh but in the god
[1:31:31] who moves amongst his people
[1:31:36] and then it goes to the church the
[1:31:38] church has been feminized
[1:31:40] church is feminized spirituality and
[1:31:42] worship it's emotion-based touchy-feely
[1:31:45] focused
[1:31:46] self-help centered
[1:31:48] Jesus came to give me unconditional
[1:31:51] Emotional Love regardless of my
[1:31:54] sinfulness
[1:31:56] and see this whole better not talk too
[1:31:58] much on that
[1:32:00] in today's Church the gospel is no
[1:32:02] longer about saving the world against
[1:32:03] impossible odds it's about finding a
[1:32:06] happy relationship with a wonderful man
[1:32:10] it's not about seeing the Plan of
[1:32:12] Redemption the way brother Branham laid
[1:32:14] it out
[1:32:15] it's not about that it's not about
[1:32:17] repentance
[1:32:18] Jesus the Jesus of the Bible says as
[1:32:21] many as I love I rebuke and chasten be
[1:32:24] zealous therefore and repent
[1:32:27] the the ones the the church is trying to
[1:32:30] make everything more palatable to the
[1:32:33] world don't try to make it more
[1:32:35] palatable to the world they think you're
[1:32:37] crazy anyway
[1:32:39] we're trying to get them to hear the
[1:32:42] word and repent
[1:32:43] we're trying to tell them they're wrong
[1:32:45] we're not trying to say oh let's be a
[1:32:48] little bit let's be pretty much wrong so
[1:32:51] you can come and join our church and
[1:32:52] send us your money we don't care about
[1:32:54] that we're trying to save a world
[1:32:57] against impossible odds
[1:32:59] we're trying to bring Deliverance to
[1:33:01] people that are captive of the devil
[1:33:03] which are in the middle of a war
[1:33:06] we're not in a marketing campaign we're
[1:33:09] not in an advertising business
[1:33:11] we're here to proclaim the word if you
[1:33:13] don't like it run out the door
[1:33:15] if you do like it run to the altar
[1:33:18] that's the message that we're preaching
[1:33:20] and proclaiming has nothing to do with
[1:33:23] trying to make it appealable to a modern
[1:33:24] age
[1:33:26] it's trying to get them to repent and
[1:33:29] come to life
[1:33:31] but that's the that's the churches we
[1:33:33] feminized it because we don't want to
[1:33:34] confront anything we want to make it
[1:33:37] nice
[1:33:38] we want to make it comfortable we want
[1:33:40] to make sure we have a nice coffee shop
[1:33:41] wonderful place for everybody to sit
[1:33:43] comfortable nice how about a Pulpit that
[1:33:46] preaches the word of God how about a
[1:33:49] place that people come in and they hear
[1:33:51] the word of God and they say amen and
[1:33:53] they they love God with all their heart
[1:33:56] and their rugged individuals a bunch of
[1:33:58] soft soap babies that we have in our
[1:34:00] society today there are a bunch of women
[1:34:02] is what they are
[1:34:04] and that's a that's an insult to you
[1:34:06] women to even say that because you women
[1:34:08] are rugged Christians you sit here and
[1:34:11] hear this things preached and it's a
[1:34:12] reproach to the world but you're sitting
[1:34:15] there saying amen that's a real lady
[1:34:17] a woman and something else
[1:34:21] but a real lady will sit and hear the
[1:34:23] word of God and say Amen
[1:34:26] but these men they're all they're a
[1:34:28] bunch of soft soap babies
[1:34:30] you look at preachers like Andy Stanley
[1:34:33] and all these Joel Osteen's sisified men
[1:34:39] cystified men and these Spirits want to
[1:34:41] get over and they want to get on us but
[1:34:43] we're going to push back
[1:34:45] we're gonna fight because we have a
[1:34:47] message to Proclaim and they might not
[1:34:49] like it you might not like it but we've
[1:34:52] got to Proclaim it anyways and we've got
[1:34:54] to make we've got every one of us has to
[1:34:56] make our stand you'll be an oddball yeah
[1:34:59] you were told that
[1:35:01] yeah but people will make fun of me you
[1:35:03] were told that
[1:35:04] the Bible tells you that the prophet
[1:35:06] tells you that
[1:35:08] you know that's going to come you're
[1:35:10] supposed to be persecuted a little bit
[1:35:12] if you're not there's really something
[1:35:14] wrong with you
[1:35:17] Jesus told us we would be hated
[1:35:21] for taking the stand that we did well
[1:35:23] what in the world
[1:35:24] then you make the stand and you get
[1:35:26] hated and you say man I better be a
[1:35:29] little bit nicer
[1:35:30] I better be a little bit more diplomatic
[1:35:32] the next time I said it no don't be
[1:35:34] don't do that
[1:35:37] speak the word
[1:35:39] preach the truth
[1:35:41] you don't have to be a jerk about it
[1:35:44] but you also don't have to be a soft
[1:35:45] soap baby
[1:35:47] take a stand
[1:35:51] this isn't about finding a happy
[1:35:53] relationship Jesus said take up your
[1:35:55] cross and follow me
[1:36:00] joyful things come from having a
[1:36:02] relationship with Jesus Christ and
[1:36:04] having fellowship with Jesus Christ
[1:36:07] but it's far different than merely
[1:36:09] having a happy human relationship
[1:36:12] because he calls us to do things that
[1:36:14] will get us in trouble will get us hated
[1:36:16] and disrespected
[1:36:22] true Womanhood is a beautiful reflection
[1:36:24] of the bride of Christ
[1:36:25] [Music]
[1:36:27] true manhood is a beautiful reflection
[1:36:30] of Christ I'm sorry everybody I'm going
[1:36:32] I'm going late you'll just have to
[1:36:34] forgive me and and love me anyways but
[1:36:37] I'll be gone for a month and a half so
[1:36:39] you you'll get a rest from me
[1:36:43] Colossians 3 18 and 19 wives submit
[1:36:46] yourselves unto your own husbands as it
[1:36:48] is fit in the Lord
[1:36:50] husbands love your wives and be not
[1:36:52] bitter against them wives submit
[1:36:56] we talked about this before we're going
[1:36:58] to talk we're talking about it again
[1:36:59] because we're going to get get deeper
[1:37:01] into this over the next 20 minutes or so
[1:37:04] submit yourselves to your own husband as
[1:37:06] is fit in the Lord notice
[1:37:09] he says add as it is fit or as it's
[1:37:12] right or as it's uh
[1:37:16] applicable
[1:37:18] in the Lord
[1:37:19] see now if your husband is asking you to
[1:37:21] disobey the word of God whoa whoa no no
[1:37:25] God's word says this I I have to obey
[1:37:29] that I have to stay by that husbands
[1:37:31] love your wives don't be bitter this
[1:37:33] means to rule as a dictator
[1:37:36] do not rule over your wife as a dictator
[1:37:39] love her
[1:37:41] leader with love speak to her with love
[1:37:43] she she is a relational being you're not
[1:37:45] as much of a relational being as she is
[1:37:47] but she is and you have to love her
[1:37:49] according to that
[1:37:56] in the Rapture brother Branham says I
[1:37:58] remember that night before I seen that I
[1:37:59] seen the preview of the Bride I stood
[1:38:01] there and seen a beautiful little lady
[1:38:03] just correctly dressed in things
[1:38:05] marching this way there was somebody
[1:38:07] standing by me in the vision and I seen
[1:38:09] they said the preview of the Bride
[1:38:12] Seen Her Go by they come on this side
[1:38:15] and went around
[1:38:16] I heard it coming up the church is
[1:38:18] coming up from this other side there
[1:38:19] come the Asian Church oh you're talking
[1:38:21] about filth here come the European
[1:38:23] Church oh my and then I heard a rock and
[1:38:25] roll coming and it was a Miss America
[1:38:27] the church and she didn't even have on
[1:38:30] any clothes she had papers like
[1:38:32] newspapers gray holding in front of her
[1:38:35] dancing by rock and roll Miss America
[1:38:38] the church I mean what a prophetic
[1:38:41] vision of America the American
[1:38:44] Christianity the American gospel that we
[1:38:47] have today she is she she is clothed in
[1:38:51] a newspaper
[1:38:52] the politics and the news of the day is
[1:38:57] what her preaching is about and what her
[1:39:00] Revelation is about it's not about the
[1:39:03] the open word it's not about the
[1:39:05] revealed scripture but it's all about
[1:39:07] news and what's in the news and what's
[1:39:10] the latest headlines in the paper
[1:39:13] and what is she doing just as her just
[1:39:16] as they have in their worship service a
[1:39:18] great Rock and Roll concert they paint
[1:39:20] their Church black
[1:39:22] because they're in they're walking in
[1:39:24] darkness
[1:39:25] so they can't help themselves they paint
[1:39:27] their Church all black like it's a like
[1:39:29] it's some kind of stage
[1:39:31] they feel they put up smoke they have
[1:39:33] all kinds of rock and roll going on they
[1:39:36] look like rock singers they act like
[1:39:38] rock singers they are rock singers and
[1:39:40] brother Branham identifies it exactly so
[1:39:43] you see what's happening we're not going
[1:39:44] to pattern ourselves after what brother
[1:39:46] Branham saw in the vision
[1:39:48] we're going to pattern herself other
[1:39:50] what the other vision is
[1:39:53] and then when them women pass by all
[1:39:55] doing all kinds of rocks and things and
[1:39:57] short hair and painted faces and as they
[1:40:00] pass by like that supposed to be virgins
[1:40:03] to Christ and when she passed by like
[1:40:04] that I turned my head you know with this
[1:40:06] holding in front of me it was a
[1:40:07] disgraceful the back of them and there
[1:40:09] they was going like that and I turned my
[1:40:11] head to weeping like that then I heard
[1:40:13] something like Onward Christian Soldiers
[1:40:15] I looked and here come that sainted
[1:40:18] bunch of little girls just exactly the
[1:40:20] way they are was all correctly dressed
[1:40:23] their hair hanging way down on their
[1:40:25] back smooth clean marching like this to
[1:40:29] the step of the Gospel she was the word
[1:40:31] it looked like one out of every nation I
[1:40:34] was looking at it as they passed by I'd
[1:40:36] seen them pass by instead of going down
[1:40:38] they started going up Hallelujah
[1:40:43] see that's
[1:40:44] that's the true bride ladies that's what
[1:40:46] you're to represent yeah
[1:40:48] see the prophet always says that you
[1:40:51] want to see the condition of the church
[1:40:53] look at the women in the church
[1:40:56] we want to be as brother Branham said
[1:40:58] just
[1:40:59] exactly the way they was correctly
[1:41:02] dressed their hair hanging down on their
[1:41:03] back now doesn't mean you can't put your
[1:41:06] hair up it's not what I'm saying but it
[1:41:07] what it's typifying is she ain't got her
[1:41:09] hair cut off
[1:41:11] she doesn't have her hair bob smooth
[1:41:12] clean she's not painted she doesn't have
[1:41:15] makeup on
[1:41:17] see that was typifying the real and
[1:41:20] genuine bride of Christ
[1:41:23] two three and five
[1:41:26] the aged women likewise that they be in
[1:41:28] Behavior as becometh holiness
[1:41:31] not false accusers not given to much
[1:41:33] wine
[1:41:34] teachers of good things that they may
[1:41:37] teach the young women to be sober
[1:41:40] to love their husbands to love their
[1:41:42] children to be discreet chaste keepers
[1:41:45] at home good obedient to their own
[1:41:47] husbands that the word of God be not
[1:41:50] blasphemed so here's Paul
[1:41:53] he's writing to a pastor he's writing to
[1:41:56] Titus
[1:41:57] and he's telling Titus this is what I
[1:42:00] want you to instruct
[1:42:02] instruct them to teach these things and
[1:42:05] instruct them also to teach the young
[1:42:08] women and it gives a list of different
[1:42:09] things of what they are to teach and
[1:42:12] what what they're saying so when we're
[1:42:16] looking at this we should look at this
[1:42:17] as the first church age Messengers
[1:42:20] instructions to sisters
[1:42:24] we don't look at this and say well that
[1:42:26] was good for another age
[1:42:29] that was good for their culture but
[1:42:30] things are different now
[1:42:33] no
[1:42:33] this is what it's teaching to us today
[1:42:38] You may wish it said teach them to go
[1:42:41] get an education and have a career I may
[1:42:44] wish they said that but it's not what
[1:42:46] the Apostle teaches it's not what he's
[1:42:48] telling them that's not the vision that
[1:42:51] he's giving them now you might go to
[1:42:53] school before you're married you might
[1:42:54] get an education those things that's up
[1:42:57] to you but as I believe as preachers of
[1:42:59] the word of God and as parents
[1:43:01] these are this is the vision that the
[1:43:04] Lord is asking us to put before our
[1:43:07] daughters
[1:43:09] he's not asking for us to put another
[1:43:11] Vision there's other things that may
[1:43:13] have to be done but that should be this
[1:43:15] should be
[1:43:17] top priority this should be our main
[1:43:19] focus if our main focus is get an
[1:43:21] education and have a career we're off
[1:43:23] the word
[1:43:25] we're not we're not teaching the right
[1:43:27] Focus
[1:43:28] this should be our Focus this which
[1:43:30] should be what our teaching and and if
[1:43:33] it's not let's get back to the word
[1:43:36] First Timothy 5 14.
[1:43:39] again the instructions of the messenger
[1:43:42] to the age
[1:43:43] the Apostle Paul
[1:43:45] the center in order of the New Testament
[1:43:47] this is instructions to a pastor
[1:43:51] he's telling them I want you this is how
[1:43:53] I want you to teach this is what I want
[1:43:55] you to set before the people
[1:43:57] I will therefore that the younger women
[1:43:59] marry
[1:44:01] bear children guide the house give none
[1:44:04] occasion to the adversary to speak
[1:44:07] reproach reproachfully
[1:44:12] that's not the advice that our culture
[1:44:15] gives us that's not the advice
[1:44:17] civilization gives us that's not the
[1:44:19] advice the devil gives to us
[1:44:22] I don't know how to make it plainer to
[1:44:23] you this is God's vision for young women
[1:44:27] and for Womanhood
[1:44:30] okay
[1:44:31] again you might have done it another way
[1:44:33] let's come back and do it God's way
[1:44:38] we don't want to give an occasion for
[1:44:41] the adversary to speak reproachfully if
[1:44:44] we don't in other words if you don't
[1:44:46] follow
[1:44:47] the directions that Paul is giving
[1:44:50] you're actually going to be giving an
[1:44:53] occasion to the adversary
[1:44:55] to speak reproachfully
[1:44:59] the word there it says guide the house
[1:45:01] it speaks to rule under the obviously
[1:45:04] under the headship of the husband to
[1:45:06] rule the household to manage family
[1:45:08] Affairs this should be the teaching
[1:45:12] older sisters moms grandmas
[1:45:16] teach you teach the young ladies
[1:45:19] in your life
[1:45:20] how to manage family affairs
[1:45:25] how to lead the household how to teach
[1:45:28] the children this should be an important
[1:45:30] part of the this is Paul is writing to a
[1:45:32] local church this should be an important
[1:45:34] part of what a local church does
[1:45:37] brother Branham and choosing of the
[1:45:39] Bride says now I'm not much of this
[1:45:40] modernistic taste of women working
[1:45:43] when I seen these women with these
[1:45:44] Uniforms on riding around in the city on
[1:45:46] motorcycles as police it's a disgrace to
[1:45:49] any City that will let a woman do that
[1:45:51] see see as many men that's without work
[1:45:54] it shows the modern thinking of our city
[1:45:56] it shows the degrading we don't have to
[1:45:58] have them women out there like that they
[1:46:00] ain't got no business out there like
[1:46:02] that amen
[1:46:04] this was true and brother Branham said
[1:46:06] it and it's still true today
[1:46:09] you might not like it you might think
[1:46:11] it's not very modern it's the truth it
[1:46:15] is a disgrace to any City
[1:46:17] it's absolutely true and we don't have
[1:46:19] to have our women out there like that
[1:46:21] you say but my whole culture we have to
[1:46:23] have two incomes we have to there's no
[1:46:25] way we can afford to live and let's wait
[1:46:27] a minute
[1:46:28] wait a minute you're trying to bypass
[1:46:30] what God's word says
[1:46:33] what if your job tells you you can't
[1:46:35] come to church my job
[1:46:38] I quit
[1:46:40] you say well I can't because now wait a
[1:46:42] minute where's your faith
[1:46:44] is it in men or in God
[1:46:47] I can't afford to do this because of
[1:46:49] this okay you can't afford
[1:46:52] but you're not serving yourself right
[1:46:55] right you shouldn't be anyway you're not
[1:46:57] following your own mind or cunningly
[1:46:59] devised fables when God's word commands
[1:47:02] to do something God will provide a way
[1:47:06] to do it believe me when Amy left
[1:47:09] working at the bank and when Avery was
[1:47:12] born was it difficult yeah
[1:47:15] even I I got fired from my job
[1:47:20] right before Avery was to be born
[1:47:24] did did we ever suffer did we die
[1:47:27] We're Not Dead
[1:47:29] I had another job and she was she was a
[1:47:32] baby
[1:47:34] I had another job and the boss was
[1:47:35] telling me to lie guess what I did
[1:47:38] I quit
[1:47:39] was nothing
[1:47:41] guess what we did paid our bills ate
[1:47:43] food
[1:47:45] took care of Avery She's Not Dead
[1:47:48] what is it God if you do it God's way
[1:47:52] it's the hard way
[1:47:55] but it's the way that will lead to much
[1:47:58] of Heaven awaiting you and it's the way
[1:48:01] of blessing so you might say I can't
[1:48:03] afford it if my wife is working it'll
[1:48:06] it'll be easier
[1:48:08] some ways it might be easier in some
[1:48:10] ways it might be worse
[1:48:13] the God's way is always the best way
[1:48:16] even if it's the hard way
[1:48:19] and so it don't say we can't afford it
[1:48:22] that's not an excuse to go against what
[1:48:25] God is asking to be done
[1:48:29] foreign
[1:48:31] I have a lot more to say about that
[1:48:34] we don't have till two in the morning
[1:48:36] when God gave a man a wife he gave him
[1:48:39] the best thing he could give him outside
[1:48:40] of salvation
[1:48:42] but when when one goes to trying to take
[1:48:44] a man's place then she's about the worst
[1:48:46] thing that he could get a hold of
[1:48:48] that's right see now we can see the
[1:48:50] spiritual application I know that's bad
[1:48:52] you think it's bad but it's the truth we
[1:48:55] don't care how bad it is we got to face
[1:48:57] up to the fact that's what the Bible
[1:49:00] teaches
[1:49:06] she's got no business in a defense plan
[1:49:08] A Woman's Place is at home with her
[1:49:11] children and when she now if her
[1:49:13] husband's sick and she has to work
[1:49:14] that's different but women's place is at
[1:49:16] home in the kitchen and when she lives
[1:49:18] that leaves that she's out of her place
[1:49:20] exactly right
[1:49:22] okay that's not a very modern thing to
[1:49:24] say
[1:49:25] it's the truth
[1:49:28] this is a this is a prophet speaking
[1:49:32] it's not merely an opinion
[1:49:35] it's a prophet preaching the truth from
[1:49:39] the word of God
[1:49:41] this is what God's vision is we read it
[1:49:44] in the scripture exactly
[1:49:46] we we don't go against God's word
[1:49:49] because of culture because of society
[1:49:50] because of pressure because of demon
[1:49:53] powers I mean when I'm pre every time I
[1:49:55] preach about this what what happens I go
[1:49:58] back to my office and I sit down and I
[1:50:00] feel like I've been on in a boxing match
[1:50:04] for 15 rounds
[1:50:06] and I'm Victorious
[1:50:08] but I need a rest why is that because
[1:50:11] all hell is against this if your home's
[1:50:15] not in order if your your life is not in
[1:50:17] order your family's not in order the
[1:50:19] church is not in order
[1:50:20] and the whole thing is outside of God's
[1:50:23] blessing yes
[1:50:25] you might be making the ends meet but if
[1:50:27] you're missing what God can do and the
[1:50:30] blessing of walking by faith
[1:50:35] it's the hard way that's admittedly God
[1:50:38] says that to the brother Branham in that
[1:50:39] interpretation of tongues admittedly
[1:50:43] this is the hard way but then he turns
[1:50:46] around and says but it's my way
[1:50:48] and because of it because you've made
[1:50:50] this choice
[1:50:52] a great portion of Heaven awaits you see
[1:50:55] and that's that's a that was brother
[1:50:56] branham's promise but also that's the
[1:50:58] promise to anyone who will take God's
[1:51:00] word walk in obedience to it regardless
[1:51:03] of the circumstances regardless of
[1:51:06] anything
[1:51:09] equal men and women are equal
[1:51:11] in God's sight
[1:51:13] but they have different roles
[1:51:16] a married couple is to have Oneness
[1:51:19] he told us
[1:51:21] this for this cause shall a man lead
[1:51:23] father and mother and cleave unto his
[1:51:26] wife and the two will be one flesh
[1:51:29] so now they created a new family
[1:51:32] now they've created a new relationship
[1:51:35] husband and wife
[1:51:37] to be you to be in Oneness Oneness in
[1:51:40] physical emotional financial and
[1:51:43] spiritual matters she takes his name
[1:51:46] and all that belongs to both of them are
[1:51:49] joined together in one
[1:51:53] man is an organizing managing and
[1:51:56] deciding character he's to be the
[1:51:58] servant leader to love to protect to
[1:52:00] cherish he's the stronger vessel
[1:52:04] the woman is to submit to obey she's the
[1:52:07] weaker vessel she's under the headship
[1:52:09] of her husband but she is to manage the
[1:52:12] household affairs
[1:52:14] brother Branham calls her the Fifth
[1:52:16] Gospel
[1:52:17] she is there she's to she's to teach and
[1:52:20] instruct the children along with her
[1:52:22] husband now that brother man doesn't say
[1:52:24] that's to say the man doesn't have any
[1:52:26] role of course the man has to be very
[1:52:30] much involved
[1:52:34] First Timothy 2 9.
[1:52:37] you know what I'm going to close
[1:52:39] musicians if you come
[1:52:41] when we look at this
[1:52:44] and we look at this Society
[1:52:47] and just just trying to summarize things
[1:52:49] here we look at the society that we're
[1:52:52] living in today as the results of
[1:52:55] Satan's attack on so many different
[1:52:56] levels
[1:52:58] we see demon powers coming in through
[1:53:00] every every every spot every number one
[1:53:04] everything that we see in this world
[1:53:07] today is based upon the tree of the
[1:53:10] knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:53:12] it's not the tree of life every
[1:53:14] technology that we have today
[1:53:16] what does it produce
[1:53:18] death
[1:53:20] it produces some good things some
[1:53:21] positive things and some bad things
[1:53:24] see and that that's that's everything
[1:53:26] across the board
[1:53:27] this is not God's will this is not God's
[1:53:30] program this is not God's plan God will
[1:53:33] in the Millennium and in the new Earth
[1:53:35] will have a civilization built on the
[1:53:38] word of God something completely
[1:53:39] different what it's built on today is
[1:53:41] satanic and so we see Satan's way to
[1:53:45] attack the church and to attack you and
[1:53:48] me is through this feminization
[1:53:51] this process of tearing down what it
[1:53:54] means to be a woman
[1:53:55] and what is what is the congealing
[1:53:57] result at the very end of of this
[1:54:00] process of the women saying we want our
[1:54:03] rights what's the what's the end result
[1:54:05] is that there's no such thing as a woman
[1:54:09] we don't know what that is
[1:54:11] we can't answer that question that would
[1:54:13] be uh that would be sexist to answer
[1:54:17] that question we don't know
[1:54:20] that's the result on that end the result
[1:54:22] in science what did science develop in
[1:54:25] our in our time in food what did the
[1:54:28] devil do he put a feminizing factor in
[1:54:31] everything yeah
[1:54:33] and you need you absolutely need the
[1:54:36] power of God to overcome this thing
[1:54:39] and the wisdom of God to overcome this
[1:54:41] thing then we go into the church world
[1:54:44] same results see it's all following the
[1:54:48] same progression
[1:54:49] tear down what it is means to be a woman
[1:54:52] in in in life in society in the church
[1:54:57] and why is that because there's a
[1:54:59] there's going to be a bride
[1:55:01] and I want to cloud people's minds so
[1:55:03] much they don't even know what that
[1:55:05] means anymore
[1:55:07] but thank God there's been
[1:55:10] though Satan did all this and he had his
[1:55:12] perfect terrorist strike against the
[1:55:14] world against on every every realm God
[1:55:17] came right out in front of him right at
[1:55:20] the very time that Satan brought his
[1:55:23] message to pervert Womanhood and the
[1:55:26] character of a woman what did he do he
[1:55:28] he he said Bob your hair
[1:55:31] what through Hollywood he promoted that
[1:55:33] what did he do he said wear pants
[1:55:35] through the through Hollywood and the
[1:55:38] mainstream of society what did he do say
[1:55:40] put on makeup through through that right
[1:55:43] at that very juncture in time God was
[1:55:47] dealing with a little man from Kentucky
[1:55:52] God was telling him don't ever drink or
[1:55:54] smoke or defile your body in any way for
[1:55:56] there's a work for you to do when you
[1:55:57] get older God was doing something right
[1:56:00] there to do what to for us
[1:56:04] to bring a Vindicated message to set all
[1:56:07] of these aspects in order you think well
[1:56:09] it's just to bring the the right
[1:56:12] revelation of things it's to bring the
[1:56:14] right life into you it's to bring the
[1:56:16] right kind of family is to bring the
[1:56:18] right kind of manhood the young people
[1:56:20] of today if you're the very last
[1:56:22] generation that and you're going to take
[1:56:24] the Rapture God is going to make sure
[1:56:27] Micah that you have the right kind of
[1:56:29] manhood Avery that you have the right
[1:56:31] kind of Womanhood God is going to he did
[1:56:34] that in the message
[1:56:35] you read it and you say oh my that's so
[1:56:37] contrary to everything that we see in
[1:56:40] the newspaper and everything we see
[1:56:41] that's exactly right it is thank you God
