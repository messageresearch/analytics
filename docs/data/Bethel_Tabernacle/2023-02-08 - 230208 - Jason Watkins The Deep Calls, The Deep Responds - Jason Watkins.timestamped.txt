[25:01] that he asked a simple question what's
[25:02] more valuable the blood of the Lord

[25:09] that which it purchased that's more
[25:11] valuable can you imagine can you say to
[25:13] yourself that as the purchase of God you
[25:16] are more valuable to him than the blood

[25:36] it's
[25:37] all good you must be Anointed with the
[25:39] Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord
[25:42] I want to take a subtitle the Lord God
[25:45] and His Divine family now I want to
[25:49] start this evening with a little bit of
[25:52] inspiration that I borrowed from a good
[25:55] friend of mine we were I was on the
[25:56] Bible study the other day the internet
[25:58] daily Bible study that I teach and
[26:01] brother Tim Calhoun was ministering that
[26:04] morning and my goodness he he came on
[26:06] this one thought and I'm going to borrow
[26:08] it just to delay my foundation and jump
[26:11] headlong oh
[26:13] okay brother Ken thank you amen praise
[26:17] the Lord
[26:18] um so we want to point a couple of
[26:21] things out and and as we read in our
[26:25] opening text Genesis 2 4 you're going to
[26:29] see this term Lord God now it's an
[26:32] important term because this is the first
[26:35] time you're going to see it used uh and
[26:39] and it's and it's and and and in its
[26:41] usage I'm going to Endeavor to show you
[26:45] and demonstrate in the scriptures
[26:46] tonight that that as God unfolded and
[26:51] continued to unfold from Genesis 1 1. in
[26:54] the beginning God created the heavens
[26:56] and the Earth and it doesn't say Lord
[26:57] God it just says God and in fact is you
[27:00] can go all through the entire first
[27:03] chapter of Genesis and you won't find
[27:05] this term Lord God until you get to
[27:09] chapter two because this is its first
[27:12] time after the advancement of the word
[27:15] brought creation to ex to its next
[27:18] transition and by that I mean that we
[27:21] find that God created everything and and
[27:24] he and the Bible would say the evening
[27:25] in the morning and the evening in the
[27:27] morning and God looked upon it and it
[27:28] was good and God said and God said and
[27:31] God said and then God looked upon it and
[27:33] it was good and he kept going he kept
[27:35] going he kept going he wasn't finished
[27:37] on day three he wasn't finished on day
[27:40] five day six he comes to day seven and
[27:43] he and we find that yet Adam and Eve are
[27:46] still not even put in human flesh yet
[27:49] and so he's using this term Elohim God
[27:53] but we find that that now coming into
[27:56] Genesis 2 in in verse 4 you're going to
[28:00] find that he's going to start setting
[28:02] the stage up now by the time he gets
[28:04] down to verse 7 I believe it is you're
[28:07] going to find that he's he's starting to
[28:09] make the next move he's starting to make
[28:11] the next transition so he needs a a
[28:14] further understanding of who he is see
[28:16] because now he's not just a
[28:18] self-existing one now he's God dwelling
[28:21] with his family you can see that in the
[28:24] Bible you find uh you know that God said
[28:26] to Moses concerning uh his name Jehovah
[28:29] he says I was not known by that name you
[28:32] know in Abraham's day now that's strange
[28:34] to us because Abraham used the term
[28:36] Jehovah Jireh but what he's simply
[28:39] meaning is now that you have to
[28:41] understand that that that Jehovah is
[28:43] really a great term to understand it's
[28:46] God dwelling with his family and so in
[28:49] Abraham he gives him a promise that
[28:52] you're going to have a family it'll be
[28:54] my family it'll be a Christ seed line
[28:57] and I'm gonna I'm gonna need a name
[28:59] that's going to reflect that and every
[29:01] time God made a move he he took a name
[29:04] to describe him more carefully so
[29:07] whether it was Jehovah Jireh whether it
[29:09] was Jehovah Shalom or whether it was
[29:11] Jehovah Nissi whatever you find all of
[29:14] these various names God was indicating
[29:17] I've I've Advanced and I I want I've
[29:21] unfolded them a little more and I want
[29:23] you to understand there's a there's a
[29:25] further characteristic of me and we need
[29:27] to name it
[29:29] and so this is why that Jesus
[29:32] represented all of the compound
[29:35] Redemptive names of Jehovah they were
[29:38] found in the Lord Jesus Christ so we
[29:41] find then that you can see here verse 5
[29:44] and every plant of the field before it
[29:46] was in the earth and every herb of the
[29:48] field before it grew for the Lord God
[29:51] had not caused it to rain upon the Earth
[29:52] and there was not a man to till the soil
[29:55] so catch that there's not yet a man to
[29:58] till the soil all right and so he says
[30:01] here um let me catch up to myself
[30:03] all right and so then he comes he moves
[30:06] on and the Lord God formed Man Out of
[30:09] the Dust of the ground and breathed now
[30:12] this isn't this isn't just him the Bible
[30:15] saying God did this it's saying the Lord
[30:18] God did this because there's now going
[30:21] to be an opportunity for a further
[30:23] Fellowship that Adam is not just in
[30:26] spirit form but now he's an expression
[30:28] he's Faith he's become manifest now he's
[30:31] more what God was looking for
[30:34] he's further along and now God is going
[30:37] to be able to have a fellowship I I
[30:40] expressed Sons out of my genes but I
[30:44] couldn't Fellowship them when they were
[30:45] within me but after they're expressed
[30:47] through the betting ground of a mother
[30:49] then now I can embrace them and talk to
[30:51] them and counsel with them and and and
[30:53] get advice from them and vice versa and
[30:56] and so this was always God's plan he
[30:59] wanted a kingdom he wanted a family and
[31:01] we're it
[31:04] now watch I've got to make sure you're
[31:06] catching that verse and then goes to 2
[31:09] 8. and the Lord God planted a garden see
[31:12] he's continuing now he's moving he's on
[31:14] the move
[31:15] and the Lord God planted a garden
[31:17] Eastward in Eden and there he put the
[31:20] man whom he formed
[31:22] 2 9 and out of the ground made the Lord
[31:26] God to grow every tree that is Pleasant
[31:28] to the sight
[31:30] good for food the tree of life also in
[31:33] the midst of the garden and the tree of
[31:35] knowledge of Good and Evil verse 15 and
[31:38] the Lord God took man and put him into
[31:41] the Garden of Eden to dress it and to
[31:44] keep it now I I want to just I want to I
[31:47] want to give you some some renderings
[31:49] from Strong's Concordance on this on
[31:52] this term Lord God all right so it's
[31:56] this is where you're going to it's not
[31:58] going to be just Elohim he's going to
[32:00] identify himself a little more closely
[32:03] and he's going to take a name you'd be
[32:05] familiar with Yahweh they didn't even
[32:08] pronounce it to the to the Renaissance
[32:10] and then they tried to put it together
[32:11] in the early days they didn't pronounce
[32:13] the name of God just out of respect to
[32:15] him but uh but we find that that that
[32:18] the name Yahweh then they then they
[32:20] later on translators put in the word
[32:22] done because they're trying to get a
[32:25] word that has no vowels it's all
[32:27] consonants and they're trying to make it
[32:28] into a word so that so that we can get a
[32:31] grasp of it it's all translation work as
[32:33] they were making the Bible but we find
[32:35] that when Elohim met him in the in the
[32:39] in the tent there in the Book of Genesis
[32:42] and he's coming to confirm the Covenant
[32:43] Abraham uses the exact word that in
[32:48] every case in the Bible and there's not
[32:50] even a single time it's not that the
[32:53] name he chose to call him was the exact
[32:57] name it only had one meaning and that is
[33:00] God
[33:02] the god the Creator the everything and
[33:06] so there was no mistake in Abraham's
[33:09] mind who he was talking to though he was
[33:12] talking to a human
[33:15] he's talking to a human man built out of
[33:18] the Dust of the ground but he refers to
[33:21] him with a name that is only attributed
[33:24] to the creator of all heavens and earth
[33:27] so now when we get this term Lord God
[33:31] it's a noun of course meaning God but it
[33:34] refers to more to his proper name of the
[33:37] god of Israel particularly how uh you
[33:40] know how he revealed himself to Moses in
[33:41] Exodus 6 and so some other indications
[33:45] is that its primary meaning should be
[33:47] understood in the context of God's
[33:49] existence namely that he is the I am
[33:52] that I am you remember Moses said who
[33:55] will I say sent me so now the people are
[33:57] going to want to know he can't just say
[33:59] uh you know Elohim sent me
[34:03] well what does that even mean see
[34:05] because now he's going to have to be a
[34:08] little more specific he's actually going
[34:10] to say the I Am
[34:12] Oh you mean the personal one the one
[34:15] Abraham met yeah that one that one sent
[34:18] me see this isn't some vague idea of
[34:22] just a creator of heavens and earth this
[34:25] is actually a an identification a name
[34:28] identifies and so so it also goes on to
[34:31] mean it has a frequent appearance in the
[34:34] name in relation to God's Redemptive
[34:36] work so you know and then sometimes in a
[34:38] car it's compounded with other words to
[34:40] describe the character of the Lord in
[34:44] Greater detail you find that in Genesis
[34:46] 22 Exodus 17 judges 6 various places now
[34:50] what I'm trying to aim at and get you
[34:52] I'm not trying to make a Hebrew scholar
[34:54] out of you I'm trying to get you to
[34:56] understand that that this whole idea of
[35:00] going from just God
[35:02] to Lord God is describing a relationship
[35:07] of Fellowship a knowing of this God very
[35:12] deeply
[35:14] so it's a greater knowing it's a it's a
[35:17] further unfolding of God you know it's
[35:20] just like you know I married my wife 40
[35:23] whatever years ago and you know my love
[35:26] for her today is far greater than the
[35:30] day I stood in an altar and said I do I
[35:33] can't even describe to you how much how
[35:35] deep how it's deepened and and and and
[35:39] and and you realize a lot of times you
[35:40] know when you have something and that's
[35:42] why when it's not real love then people
[35:45] get tired of each other because it's not
[35:47] new anymore but when it's a real Eternal
[35:50] mate it the longer it goes the deeper it
[35:53] gets the deeper it gets the more
[35:55] committed you are see and so this whole
[35:58] idea of going from God to Lord God is is
[36:02] a is it it's referring to an involvement
[36:05] with this God it's it's describing a
[36:09] caring for this God a caring for his
[36:12] word and and it comes from a a very deep
[36:16] place in your heart Jesus said in
[36:18] Matthew 22 that Jesus said unto him Thou
[36:22] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[36:25] heart and with all thy soul and with all
[36:28] thy mind this is the first
[36:30] and great commandment
[36:34] so so when we're when we're reading this
[36:37] you're seeing God now coming into a
[36:41] deeper relationship with his creation
[36:44] because now they've moved from Spirit
[36:46] man to flesh man and now God has someone
[36:50] to tend the garden he created this
[36:52] beautiful garden now he's got somebody
[36:53] to manage it see and so and so we find
[36:56] that that this is so important for you
[36:58] to understand so so let's carry on
[37:01] and the Lord God took the man and put
[37:03] him in him into the Garden of Eden to do
[37:06] what to dress it and to keep it we
[37:10] dropped down to 16.
[37:12] and the Lord God commanded the man
[37:14] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[37:17] mayest freely eat Verse 18 and the Lord
[37:21] God said it is not good that man should
[37:24] be alone I will make him a helmet for
[37:27] him you go on down to 19. all right and
[37:31] out of the ground the Lord God formed
[37:34] every beast of the field and every fowl
[37:37] of the air and brought them unto Adam to
[37:40] see what he would call them now this is
[37:42] this is quite a transfer of confidence
[37:44] you know God's got a lot of confidence
[37:48] in the sun to only name him what God
[37:52] would name him there's obviously a great
[37:54] confidence that God has that he has the
[37:57] level of fellowship with Adam and it's
[38:00] so pure it's so deep there's such a
[38:04] closeness there that it's that it's you
[38:06] you can see it right but brother M talks
[38:08] about the apostles in the in the early
[38:10] church that they were so in tune with
[38:13] the holy spirit that God didn't even
[38:16] have to always speak just nod his head
[38:18] in a way they would go how I would like
[38:20] to say Lord God let that be me let it
[38:23] let me because that's the kingdom
[38:25] restoration we're coming back you're
[38:27] coming back to this kind of com this
[38:29] kind of communion see
[38:32] then I could say to you you should never
[38:35] ever allow yourself to not be moving
[38:40] toward that
[38:43] I can say to you that Satan's design and
[38:47] his desire is to cut that advancement
[38:50] off
[38:52] he will use whatever means necessary
[38:55] now his means are quite limited because
[38:58] he a demon is almost powerless unless he
[39:01] can get someone to work through so I
[39:03] would say to you don't open your mind to
[39:06] him don't open your heart to him don't
[39:08] open your home to him don't cut him off
[39:10] at every pass
[39:12] eliminate him out of your life eliminate
[39:14] him out of your relationships eliminate
[39:15] him out of your friendships you know
[39:17] eliminate the devil out of your
[39:19] Recreation eliminate the devil out of
[39:21] your career eliminate the devil out here
[39:23] out of your Pursuits
[39:25] and then you'll stand Victorious and
[39:29] strong in the power of His might
[39:31] see
[39:34] verse 21.
[39:37] and the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall
[39:39] upon Adam and he slept he took one of
[39:42] his ribs closed up the flesh instead
[39:44] thereof
[39:45] verse 22.
[39:48] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[39:51] from man made he a woman see
[39:53] further Advanced now he's doing to Adam
[39:56] what he has done to himself
[39:59] he's taking something from within Adam
[40:01] and expressing it
[40:03] he's not he's not taking a a different
[40:06] creation that's the beauty of Eve being
[40:10] a byproduct of Adam a byproduct people
[40:14] think sometimes it's always in a
[40:15] negative connotation and that's not even
[40:17] that's not even that's almost actually
[40:18] never true that there are many
[40:21] byproducts that we live today and have
[40:24] wonderful inventions because they took
[40:26] this this thing and this thing and there
[40:28] was a reaction and It produced a
[40:30] byproduct
[40:31] you understand and so all kinds of
[40:34] different compounds and and by
[40:36] themselves they wouldn't really help you
[40:37] they might even kill you but put them
[40:39] together they produce a byproduct and
[40:41] save your life
[40:43] see so so God is now not wanting he
[40:47] didn't want to have a family separate
[40:49] from himself when he made his family
[40:50] because then if if anything had a
[40:53] beginning then it has to have an end
[40:54] that way like hell was created it had a
[40:57] beginning it has an end he doesn't want
[40:59] to do that he wanted to express the
[41:01] bride so that she would be just as
[41:04] Eternal as him and he would never lose
[41:06] her
[41:08] see
[41:10] so so we find that he's taking her out
[41:14] of Adam she's a further expression of
[41:16] him
[41:17] so the rib verse 22 again
[41:21] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[41:23] from man made he a woman and brought her
[41:25] unto the man look at now watch Genesis 3
[41:28] 1.
[41:29] now the serpent was more subtle
[41:32] than any beast of the field which the
[41:35] Lord God
[41:36] had made
[41:38] and he said unto the woman
[41:41] yea
[41:43] hath God said
[41:46] what happened to Lord God
[41:49] so now you're seeing an intentional
[41:51] reduction
[41:53] this is his this is his approach to Eve
[41:56] what's he trying to do get her to agree
[41:59] with him that what God Said shouldn't
[42:03] mean as much as you think it should
[42:06] so it's all about a reduction God sent
[42:08] his word and Satan wants to come in
[42:10] right away and reduce your dependency on
[42:14] it reduce your faith in it and reduce
[42:16] your alliance with it
[42:20] yea hath God said
[42:23] you should not eat of every tree of the
[42:25] garden
[42:25] see now watch watch how this
[42:28] conversation goes look how fast Eve
[42:31] collapses
[42:32] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[42:35] made of the fruit of the Trees of the
[42:38] garden but of the I'm sorry but of the
[42:40] fruit of the trees which is in the midst
[42:43] of the garden now she's quoting him
[42:47] he's already got her
[42:49] he's already got her
[42:51] it's just a matter of time because he's
[42:54] been successful in reducing her faith in
[42:57] what God had already moved forward to be
[43:00] and it's almost like what God is now on
[43:03] The Cutting Edge where God is now in
[43:06] this position she is starting Satan is
[43:09] trying to get her don't believe that see
[43:12] so now it's just hath hath God said and
[43:17] now she's quoting it back God hath said
[43:19] You shall not even neither shall you
[43:22] touch it so so when we when we look at
[43:25] that you can take it down Heath when we
[43:27] begin to look at this whole idea of a
[43:31] reduction in the relationship and and
[43:34] how easily Satan suggested to her you
[43:38] need to kind of relax a little bit on
[43:40] just how much you take God's word for
[43:42] things
[43:43] there needs to be a little bit of a
[43:45] reduction and and what is so astonishing
[43:48] to me as I was thinking about this I
[43:50] thought how that the that the Lord God
[43:53] from Genesis 2 and 4 that the Lord God
[43:57] did so many good things in the previous
[44:01] 11 instances and I read you enough
[44:05] verses to cover 11 times where he says
[44:08] the Lord God from Genesis 4 down to
[44:12] where we come into chapter three
[44:14] and God had did so many good things in
[44:17] the previous instances the Lord God that
[44:20] how that he had literally cooed to
[44:22] Nature and brother Brown talks about how
[44:24] that that pillar fire moved over the
[44:27] Earth and it began to coo and make love
[44:29] and and and and and and birds flew up
[44:32] out of the dust and the and the father
[44:34] said oh that's beautiful keep going keep
[44:39] going don't go backwards don't stop keep
[44:44] going the more you go the more Beauty
[44:46] the further you go the more that'll make
[44:49] sense though whatever you do don't stop
[44:52] and it kept going and the grass and the
[44:55] trees and the animals and the whales and
[44:57] and suddenly the whole world is teeming
[45:00] and here God had created such a paradise
[45:03] giving his word out so freely that that
[45:08] was there and it was only only
[45:10] exclusively resulting in Adam's richness
[45:16] there wasn't one negative thing
[45:19] that happened to Adam
[45:21] believing the word
[45:24] not one negative thing it was all about
[45:28] blessing and all about life in fact is
[45:33] it was so good it built something we
[45:37] haven't had since a perfect world
[45:42] and as soon
[45:44] as there was a reduction
[45:47] then there was an immediate then that
[45:50] was an immediate Interruption and death
[45:53] came sweeping in
[45:55] why when God did it when the Lord when
[45:59] God built and then the Lord God began to
[46:01] carry on everything just kept going life
[46:04] more life more life higher life higher
[46:07] life better life higher life more life
[46:09] better life Beauty more Beauty much more
[46:12] Beauty much much much more Beauty
[46:15] the whole thing is becoming from glory
[46:17] to glory from glory to glory until there
[46:21] somebody believed in a reduction
[46:24] and somebody halted on their faith and
[46:26] said wait a minute I'm not so sure and
[46:28] immediately death was in the camp and
[46:30] immediately the whole world fell into
[46:32] sin
[46:36] when you
[46:38] I can tell your friends that once God
[46:42] even the real one
[46:44] who has a real anointing
[46:46] that he can pour upon your life
[46:49] and when and when that very real God
[46:51] with that very real anointing suffers a
[46:54] reduction in your mind and you go you
[46:58] begin to grow distant from him which is
[47:01] inevitable you certainly will
[47:03] then right away you'll begin to accept a
[47:06] watered-down word a watered-down
[47:08] fellowship a watered-down experience
[47:12] he will no longer be Lord God to you
[47:18] will still know him as God but Lord
[47:19] means lordship Lord this word Lord
[47:22] entails relationship that you'll be born
[47:26] of his bone and word of his word and
[47:28] life of his life and love of his love
[47:30] and what and that's why David was the
[47:32] was the apple of his eye because God was
[47:34] simply saying David the way he was a man
[47:37] I'm sorry the meaning of the scripture a
[47:39] man after God's Own Heart what that's
[47:40] meaning in the Hebrew is God is saying
[47:42] that David how God thought about things
[47:44] David thought he's a man after my heart
[47:47] my heart's like his heart his heart's
[47:49] like my heart we think alike we we feel
[47:52] alike we love alike oh I want to be a
[47:55] man after God's Own Heart
[47:59] see
[48:01] but when he's no longer
[48:04] the Lord got to you
[48:06] and I want to say to you today how can
[48:08] you expect anything
[48:10] but chaos
[48:12] to follow you
[48:15] it's it's inescapable
[48:17] the same way you'd think something as
[48:20] beautiful as Eden nothing could over
[48:21] overthrow it but it did
[48:26] the family of God
[48:28] overthrew all that beauty
[48:30] in a day
[48:33] when we talk about the Deep calling to
[48:36] the Deep
[48:39] oh that in Jeremiah 7
[48:42] how that he would call to her he would
[48:44] call to Israel he would tell His
[48:45] prophets
[48:46] come on to her and there's not numerous
[48:48] places I could have went to tonight I
[48:50] just picked one verse in Jeremiah 7 27
[48:52] therefore Thou shalt speak all these
[48:55] words unto them but they will not
[48:57] hearken unto thee Thou shalt also call
[49:00] unto them but they will not answer thee
[49:03] now you remember the story brother
[49:04] around tell us about how that eagle got
[49:06] blown down and he was hunting and that
[49:08] little chatter chatter
[49:10] chipmunk over there and and brother
[49:12] Branham you know and he's all this
[49:14] nature he loved nature and he he said he
[49:16] stepped out there you know and the
[49:19] finally when it quit raining and the
[49:20] storm had blown that eagle down and the
[49:23] little policeman of the woods was like
[49:25] you know giving him the what for you
[49:26] know what are you doing here you're not
[49:27] supposed to be here you're you're
[49:28] supposed to be up in the heavens I'm
[49:30] here to tell you if if critics will run
[49:33] me into the heavens I just say criticize
[49:34] on because I need to be up in the
[49:36] heavens I don't need to let storms keep
[49:38] me on the ground I just need to sorrow
[49:41] up into the heavens if trials and
[49:43] tribulations are What It Takes and the
[49:45] enemy comes after me with 1000
[49:47] tribulations and my heavenly father
[49:48] allows it but that'll cause me to leap
[49:51] and flop and catch a stream and head
[49:53] back into the heavens and I just say
[49:55] Lord by whatever means necessary
[49:59] and brother Madison I stepped out there
[50:00] and
[50:01] the glistening the the the the the the
[50:03] mist and he said and and way over here
[50:07] he heard a lone wolf and he called way
[50:10] in the distance of this Great Wilderness
[50:12] and he said way down here in the valley
[50:15] his mate answered him
[50:17] a deep called and a deep responded why
[50:21] because they were mates and they
[50:23] recognized each other's voice and the
[50:24] storm of Life the storm had separated
[50:26] them that got they got separated because
[50:28] of the Wilderness experience oh my that
[50:31] male wolf as he caused to his mate and
[50:34] she responds and and she would call and
[50:36] he would answer and I'm here to tell you
[50:38] there there shouldn't be any storm of
[50:40] life and there shouldn't be any distance
[50:42] of Separation there shouldn't be any
[50:44] Wilderness experience that you have to
[50:46] go through that cut off the love of
[50:49] God that when the voice of God begins to
[50:52] echo down you say Here I Am Lord over
[50:55] here I am
[50:57] hallelujah or that you have the ability
[50:59] to say master I don't know what's
[51:02] happening I'm in a terrible spot I don't
[51:04] know where I am can you help me and to
[51:07] hear the heavens Echo back I'm right
[51:09] here my son I'm coming stand still and
[51:11] know that I am God I'm here to tell you
[51:13] that's the kind of relationship
[51:16] that an unfettered faith in God's word
[51:19] will produce
[51:22] he calls she answers I thought about in
[51:25] our day how the strong Angel called
[51:27] the strong Angel stood there beside John
[51:30] oh let him come
[51:33] who's worthy to take the book and when a
[51:36] strong he wasn't the mighty Angel he was
[51:38] just a strong Angel and when the strong
[51:40] angel came when the strong Angel cried
[51:43] out a lamb responded from the eternities
[51:48] Hallelujah come forward to take the book
[51:51] oh my you know you if you if you think
[51:53] about how that he says he he took the
[51:55] book and he loosed the seals and he
[51:58] called for his Queen to come and stand
[52:01] by his side do you hear the call do you
[52:04] feel the poor is the seal open to you
[52:06] then the king is calling will you
[52:08] respond and say yes my Lord I will come
[52:11] and Stand By Your Side
[52:13] I will be identified with the word of
[52:16] this day and nothing no trial no
[52:18] Wilderness no storm is going to stop
[52:21] that
[52:22] if I lose sight of you I'll find you if
[52:24] you lose sight of me you'll find me
[52:26] no no where I could go could I ever get
[52:29] away from the love of God
[52:34] in the Song of Solomon
[52:38] beautiful story
[52:40] he calls to her he comes to her door
[52:43] my love
[52:45] he reaches his fingers through the
[52:47] lattice and she and she can see him but
[52:49] she delays
[52:50] and he's calling to her and he's he's
[52:53] looking for a response and he comes to
[52:56] her in the Still of the Night when there
[52:58] there should be no disturbances
[53:00] my love come to the door open the door
[53:04] who is it oh it's your love and look
[53:07] here I'm trying to reach to you I'm
[53:09] trying to reach to you and she delayed
[53:12] and the next thing you know he was gone
[53:15] oh she jumped to her feet she jumped out
[53:19] of her bed I I relate to this woman so
[53:23] many times when I heard him call and I
[53:26] let life pull me aside and I didn't
[53:28] answer and then when I I went to hunt
[53:30] him I couldn't find him and like her I
[53:32] ran into the streets and she ran through
[53:35] the streets have you seen him whom my
[53:38] soul loves and she ran into these people
[53:40] and they had this opinion and they had
[53:42] that opinion and there was people trying
[53:44] to abuse her oh but my friends she
[53:47] wasn't searching for some religious idea
[53:49] she needed more than series from some
[53:52] man-made catechism she was looking for
[53:55] something real
[53:58] and there was a real to seek and there
[54:00] was a real to be had and there was a
[54:03] love to be restored
[54:07] it's not a
[54:09] a disagreeable point
[54:12] to
[54:13] Point into the language of the Hebrew
[54:15] Old Testament
[54:17] and find that the word used to describe
[54:19] God is plural
[54:21] that makes perfect sense to us
[54:23] understanding the godhead
[54:25] doesn't mean a polytheistic ideology of
[54:29] multiple beings
[54:30] but we find that God was plural and and
[54:35] the and as I was saying earlier his
[54:38] whole Kingdom his whole family his whole
[54:40] plan his bride his people everything he
[54:43] would ever have it was an expression
[54:45] coming out of him that's why we were
[54:47] showing in Revelation 21 by the time
[54:50] it's a new heavens and a new Earth
[54:51] everything everything that's uh that's
[54:54] that's even slightly not the original is
[54:57] not there Satan is gone hell is gone the
[55:00] everything's gone the whole world is now
[55:03] renewed everything is God and God is
[55:05] everything he's filling all-time space
[55:08] and Eternity and and and that is going
[55:10] to be an amazing no wonder it said I saw
[55:12] a new heavens and a new Earth
[55:19] and so we find that
[55:22] being plural in Genesis a deep could
[55:24] call
[55:26] but that deep would always if you see
[55:28] the pattern
[55:30] and this is one of the most astounding
[55:32] sermons to me it's the one I always had
[55:35] to denominational preachers
[55:37] is the spoken word is the Original Seed
[55:40] because that is an immovable landmark in
[55:46] the economy of God
[55:47] he never changes his mind about his word
[55:51] and if you want to know do you have his
[55:54] word you there is only one test to
[55:56] perform is it according to his original
[55:58] word
[56:00] because as far as God is concerned his
[56:02] word doesn't change
[56:04] so if your teaching doesn't line up to
[56:07] every word you've got the wrong teaching
[56:09] so I'm so glad my whole life since a
[56:12] child starts sitting in the woods as a
[56:14] teenager with my Bible and knowing this
[56:16] God I was beginning to know him
[56:18] traveling the world to preach this
[56:20] message on six continents I've never
[56:22] found anywhere that it wasn't according
[56:25] to his word and I've never found any
[56:27] time where God wouldn't come on the
[56:29] scene and prove it with infallible
[56:31] Divine Miracles and move on the scene to
[56:35] prove it
[56:36] and I know what it's done in my heart I
[56:38] know how it's changed my life friends
[56:40] and I don't plan to have a reduction in
[56:43] my relationship
[56:45] I'm not going to let Leo to see it do
[56:47] that to me I'm not going to let the
[56:48] world come between me and him
[56:50] have you seen my lover have you seen the
[56:53] one whom my soul loves say yes brother
[56:55] Jason he's sitting right beside me oh
[56:58] thank you yes you're right I see him and
[57:00] I see him and I see him and I see him
[57:03] Hallelujah
[57:06] I'm so happy he he comes here and he
[57:10] we find that the principle of the spoken
[57:13] word is original see the principle of
[57:15] the seed
[57:16] is that
[57:18] God is going to be able
[57:22] to
[57:24] put into motion
[57:26] a deep call
[57:29] and a deep response within himself
[57:33] you say that's strange how can that that
[57:36] doesn't even sound that sounds how does
[57:39] that even work well you know something
[57:41] friends I I have something inside of me
[57:45] and and when something calls something
[57:47] inside me that's more than me responds
[57:51] there's something down inside of me some
[57:53] piece of him that Amen to the word that
[57:56] just Wells up and says amen amen even
[58:00] and my faith goes so much further thank
[58:03] God it goes further than my
[58:05] understanding because I wouldn't be
[58:07] possible if I didn't know him and the
[58:08] power of his resurrection
[58:10] but I know whom I have believed and I
[58:13] know what he's capable of in our lives
[58:16] and so he's he's got a deep that he's
[58:19] calling and why does he why does he
[58:23] bring forth creation because there's a
[58:26] deep responding oh I want to know you
[58:28] yes Father I want to know you oh I want
[58:30] to know you my pride yes we want to know
[58:32] you I want a kingdom yes we want to be a
[58:34] part of that Kingdom I want to have a
[58:36] world yes we want to be a part of that
[58:38] world and we're still saying it today I
[58:40] said my word yes I believe your word I
[58:42] got a plan of redness and yes Count Me
[58:44] In don't be a part of the world no no
[58:46] never I don't want to be a part of the
[58:48] world
[58:50] there's a deep calling and a deep that
[58:52] responds
[58:55] because you would only call for the same
[58:58] kind because the seed brings forth of
[59:00] its kind
[59:01] so the word's only ever going to call
[59:03] for the word
[59:05] it's exactly why the world refuses it
[59:08] because it's not a world call it's a
[59:11] word call
[59:12] see and so you know Adam longed for this
[59:17] kind you know God from eternity's longed
[59:21] for this kind God said he looks on Adam
[59:23] I showed you the scripture and Adam was
[59:26] lonely
[59:27] and God said you know it's not good that
[59:30] he's alone God's expressing there's such
[59:32] a communion here Adam's got the same
[59:34] kind of a feeling he's got it's not good
[59:37] how does God know because God knows it's
[59:39] not good to be alone at one time he had
[59:41] been alone with his thoughts and and
[59:43] then and then God created the heavens
[59:45] and the earth oh but friends you know
[59:47] there was still his family wasn't in
[59:49] manifestation and so he keeps working
[59:51] and keeps working and keeps working
[59:52] until what he has a son and his son's
[59:56] wife and now he can Fellowship them and
[59:58] that's exactly why when they fell in sin
[1:00:01] and brother Branham said that God would
[1:00:04] not see he saw his creation he said he
[1:00:08] would not see it lay there face down in
[1:00:11] ruin he will not be defeated he's God
[1:00:13] and he will not be defeated and he began
[1:00:16] immediately
[1:00:18] oh let me take some Redemption don't
[1:00:20] need any amount of time Redemption
[1:00:22] starts immediately rebuilding it back
[1:00:27] that's what I want I don't want I don't
[1:00:28] want to wait till next week I want to
[1:00:31] say tonight Lord God renew revive
[1:00:34] rebuild
[1:00:39] see
[1:00:40] so
[1:00:42] we find that
[1:00:45] Adam longed for this kind
[1:00:48] God from the eternities
[1:00:50] longed for this kind
[1:00:53] I'm so happy to raise my hand
[1:00:56] say Lord I long for that
[1:00:58] let me raise my hand in this Dark World
[1:01:00] say Lord I long I'm I'll raise them both
[1:01:04] Lord I long for that kind of
[1:01:07] relationship I long for like seed
[1:01:10] like life
[1:01:12] like Faith
[1:01:14] a like existence
[1:01:21] so
[1:01:22] we find that
[1:01:25] that of like seed
[1:01:27] would respond to his word and flatly his
[1:01:30] word only
[1:01:32] that's why Prophet would say
[1:01:34] she has the word and the word only
[1:01:36] she won't accept any other seed it takes
[1:01:40] the word of God it's the only only the
[1:01:43] only seed she is open to
[1:01:45] you see now Satan come as we read
[1:01:49] and immediately starts trying to bring a
[1:01:52] reduction he's successful next thing you
[1:01:54] know Eve's quoting him
[1:01:57] and so we find that that that it that
[1:02:01] that God it was never going to let that
[1:02:05] stand
[1:02:06] he was never going to let that stand
[1:02:08] and in fact is it won't even take him
[1:02:11] very long to set the record straight
[1:02:14] Genesis 3 8 Ethan
[1:02:17] and they heard now this is the very next
[1:02:19] what look at this here he comes it's
[1:02:22] only been a few verses Satan's been oh
[1:02:24] hath God said well uh God said that we
[1:02:28] shouldn't do this
[1:02:29] and God now now look who shows up
[1:02:32] Genesis 3 8 and they heard the voice of
[1:02:35] who the Lord God Walking In The Garden
[1:02:39] in the cool of the day and Adam and his
[1:02:43] wife hid themselves
[1:02:47] from the presence of the
[1:02:50] amongst the Trees of the garden
[1:02:53] so he's he's going to call them out of
[1:02:57] their hiding place
[1:02:59] and he's going to
[1:03:01] have a hearing
[1:03:04] he's going to render a judgment
[1:03:06] there's been a breach in the faith
[1:03:10] there's been a breach in the law
[1:03:12] somebody has violated the word and God
[1:03:16] is there not God the Lord God
[1:03:19] he's going to set the record straight I
[1:03:22] see how this happened there was a
[1:03:24] reduction in belief in me so I've come
[1:03:26] now to set the record straight
[1:03:29] and he's going to call them from their
[1:03:31] hiding place and he's going to judge the
[1:03:33] matter with his Justice because he's the
[1:03:36] Lord God over Justice do you believe
[1:03:38] that he's the Lord God over judgment
[1:03:41] he's the Lord God of right thinking let
[1:03:44] the Heathen rage all they want to let
[1:03:46] the critics rage all they want to but by
[1:03:50] the time you get to the 14th verse Satan
[1:03:53] and the serpent is going to learn a very
[1:03:56] painful lesson
[1:04:00] he's going to learn a hard lesson he's
[1:04:03] going to learn that the Lord God
[1:04:06] is the god over the enemy
[1:04:10] he's the Lord God over Justice he's the
[1:04:13] Lord God over Mercy he's the Lord God
[1:04:16] over judgment you can rely on him he's
[1:04:19] the Lord God over the enemy
[1:04:22] Hallelujah do you believe he's the Lord
[1:04:24] God over the enemy when you go down to
[1:04:25] verse 21 he's also the Lord God over
[1:04:28] Redemption to make bloody skins he's the
[1:04:32] only one who can do it
[1:04:35] let me hear I'm here to tell your
[1:04:36] friends he he rules and Reigns over
[1:04:38] Justice and judgment and mercy and faith
[1:04:42] and his word he rules over the enemy and
[1:04:44] he is the authority over Redemption and
[1:04:48] nobody can offer you Redemption only
[1:04:50] Christ in his word can offer you
[1:04:53] Redemption
[1:04:55] no man-made Theory can do it no amount
[1:04:58] of Good Deeds no social club it's going
[1:05:00] to take the lamb who grabbed the book
[1:05:03] and loose the seals and brought
[1:05:05] Redemption
[1:05:11] the Lord God
[1:05:14] he's not going to tolerate
[1:05:17] this reduction
[1:05:20] in his person
[1:05:22] he's not going to allow even the world
[1:05:25] goes off admired by the time
[1:05:28] you get to Genesis 6.
[1:05:31] you find that
[1:05:33] sons of Adam and Sons of Seth
[1:05:36] have married into Daughters of Canaan
[1:05:40] intermingle the whole human race and
[1:05:42] sin is rampant all over the world
[1:05:45] that that thing that was a beautiful
[1:05:47] garden
[1:05:49] that God made perfect
[1:05:51] but somebody reduced it
[1:05:54] and now the whole world is covered in
[1:05:57] sin
[1:05:58] and there's just a very few righteous
[1:06:01] people
[1:06:01] one Enoch who is taken
[1:06:05] it was not
[1:06:07] he's he he's a he's an original
[1:06:09] astronaut he was not
[1:06:12] you know astronauts and cosmonauts man
[1:06:15] those guys are lame they have to get on
[1:06:17] a rocket ship
[1:06:18] and hope it don't blow up
[1:06:21] was not just get taken
[1:06:23] see and so I told somebody the other day
[1:06:26] God is the ultimate body Snatcher one of
[1:06:29] these mornings is coming for me
[1:06:31] hallelujah oh I'll be gone in a moment
[1:06:34] in the twinkling of an eye say where'd
[1:06:37] he go he vanished what does that even
[1:06:38] mean he's gone that's all we know
[1:06:40] Hallelujah
[1:06:42] but by the time you come to Genesis 9
[1:06:46] now you're going to see how that God is
[1:06:49] is again he's not going to let that
[1:06:52] stand so that by the time you get to
[1:06:54] Genesis 9 the Lord God decided the Lord
[1:06:57] God decided that Shem would be blessed
[1:07:02] now sham is the progenitor he's the
[1:07:04] ancestor of Abraham prior to Abraham
[1:07:06] Abraham come directly from the line of
[1:07:09] Shem so so so God the Lord God in in in
[1:07:14] making this decision the Lord God said
[1:07:17] his Blessing would be upon Shem and
[1:07:20] Canaan would serve him and all of these
[1:07:22] various things but we find that that
[1:07:24] that he's restoring the Christ seed line
[1:07:27] After the flood and he's putting it back
[1:07:30] in the Earth are you realizing friends
[1:07:32] are you realizing tonight why Satan's
[1:07:36] charges against you in the Supreme Court
[1:07:39] of Heaven won't stand
[1:07:41] have you ever stopped to realize it's
[1:07:44] not cause you smell good or look fine or
[1:07:46] you're a nice person uh we were all most
[1:07:49] of us rotten to the core but this is a
[1:07:52] seed Light of Christ and it's it's in
[1:07:54] the court of Heaven is unchargeable
[1:07:56] unindictable
[1:07:58] and God will not receive a charge
[1:08:00] against his family Zechariah 3 proves
[1:08:03] that
[1:08:04] based strictly on Election on nothing
[1:08:07] another Merit election alone
[1:08:10] Satan with every DNA evidence and video
[1:08:12] replay
[1:08:13] high definition satellite imagery had
[1:08:16] Israel dead to rights they were
[1:08:19] absolutely guilty and Satan had the
[1:08:20] evidence until he didn't
[1:08:22] because God threw every bit of it out on
[1:08:25] one basis alone this is Jerusalem whom I
[1:08:27] have chosen now get out of my court and
[1:08:30] don't you ever bring charges against my
[1:08:33] family again
[1:08:35] Hallelujah friends that this is like
[1:08:37] Faith this is like seed this is like
[1:08:40] word
[1:08:41] Hallelujah
[1:08:44] so the Lord God has declared
[1:08:47] that we stand
[1:08:49] before the highest court in creation
[1:08:53] you stand innocent
[1:08:57] the Lord God who is the god over
[1:09:01] judgment
[1:09:02] has pronounced you
[1:09:04] innocent
[1:09:06] not just not guilty because there wasn't
[1:09:09] enough evidence to convict you so since
[1:09:11] we're not sure we're gonna have to let
[1:09:12] you go God is very sure you're innocent
[1:09:14] God is very sure you never did it in the
[1:09:17] first place God is very sure over who
[1:09:20] you are sometimes we doubt who we are
[1:09:23] but God has never been in
[1:09:26] say how did he find me uh he called and
[1:09:30] something responded I was lost in the
[1:09:32] world it didn't matter no storm no
[1:09:34] Wilderness could cut you off he called
[1:09:37] down into the valley and something
[1:09:38] within me said Here I Am Lord here I am
[1:09:42] give me that word
[1:09:44] oh my
[1:09:47] Genesis 15.
[1:09:49] after these things the word of the Lord
[1:09:51] came unto Abram in the vision saying
[1:09:54] fear not Abram
[1:09:56] I am thy Shield
[1:09:58] and thy exceeding great reward
[1:10:01] see now Genesis uh 15 uh one to four
[1:10:05] eighth
[1:10:06] so
[1:10:07] how did Abraham get here
[1:10:09] how did how did he ever find himself
[1:10:12] being talked to by God
[1:10:16] because God blessed his ancestor
[1:10:19] and said in Shem I will bless the seed
[1:10:22] line of Shem After the flood after I
[1:10:25] destroyed it all I took my only
[1:10:27] redeemable son home and I carried Noah
[1:10:31] and his family through the flood which
[1:10:34] was a type of the foolish virgin I'm
[1:10:36] sorry that's it's actually more of a
[1:10:38] type of the 144 000 there's one quote
[1:10:40] where he talks about it being the
[1:10:41] foolish virgin because it's a dual type
[1:10:43] but it's most largely in reference to
[1:10:46] the 144 000 who are redeemed not just
[1:10:49] spared they're redeemed
[1:10:51] they they when the bride goes up we find
[1:10:55] the bride leaves the Earth the eagle
[1:10:56] anointing doesn't leave the ego
[1:10:58] anointing lifts up flies East picks up
[1:11:01] Moses and Elijah and takes the same
[1:11:03] gospel to the 144 000. they receive the
[1:11:07] same message the same word the same
[1:11:09] Christ the same token the same abstract
[1:11:12] and they're found on the mountain with
[1:11:15] the song of Moses rejoicing
[1:11:22] see
[1:11:24] he says now he goes on here oh I'm
[1:11:26] running out of time so fast
[1:11:29] so he says verse 2.
[1:11:34] and Abram said Lord God
[1:11:37] Lord God
[1:11:39] What wilt thou give me
[1:11:41] seeing I go childless
[1:11:46] and the steward of my house
[1:11:49] is this Eliezer of Damascus
[1:11:52] and Abram said behold to me
[1:11:55] thou has given no seed and low
[1:11:57] one born in my house
[1:12:00] is mine heir
[1:12:02] but God's not going to let that stand
[1:12:04] not the Lord God
[1:12:06] the Lord God's been working on this plan
[1:12:08] for a long time
[1:12:09] and he's not going to let some trivial
[1:12:11] thing in Abraham's condition of Life
[1:12:14] stop the word of God you're not going to
[1:12:17] stop God's plan for you I'm going to say
[1:12:19] it plain you're not going to be able to
[1:12:22] throw yourself out of God's plan
[1:12:24] Hallelujah
[1:12:26] and here's Abram oh now I you you gave
[1:12:30] you promised me a son you you said you'd
[1:12:32] be my shield and my exceeding great
[1:12:34] reward and as soon as God said that you
[1:12:36] know Abram is just a human just like us
[1:12:39] can you imagine that God come down to
[1:12:41] you and said Hey listen I'm going to be
[1:12:44] your Shield God if if if if God
[1:12:47] literally spoke to you in an old voices
[1:12:49] and said I don't want you to worry about
[1:12:51] anything I'm going to be your shield and
[1:12:53] your exceeding reward
[1:12:55] and you said yeah but I got this problem
[1:12:58] and I don't know how I'm going to fix it
[1:13:00] and I just can't you know I've tried and
[1:13:02] tried and tried
[1:13:04] and Abram said Lord God what will thou
[1:13:06] give me seeing I go childless God
[1:13:08] already promised him saying that I go
[1:13:10] childless in the steward of my houses or
[1:13:12] Damascus the neighbor and said behold to
[1:13:13] me thou has given no seed and lo one
[1:13:16] born in my house is mine Heir but watch
[1:13:19] how and behold the word of the Lord came
[1:13:23] to him saying this shall not be thine
[1:13:27] air but he that shall come forth out of
[1:13:31] thine own bowels shall be thine Heir I
[1:13:35] know you're in a body of Flesh and it's
[1:13:38] fallen and you've got problems and
[1:13:40] you've got weaknesses but I'm here to
[1:13:43] tell you that sin born in your house
[1:13:45] that's not going to be your Heir what's
[1:13:49] going to be my ear there's a gene down
[1:13:51] on the inside and it's going to produce
[1:13:54] a new body
[1:13:55] and that's going to be your hair your
[1:13:58] air you're going to be an air of eternal
[1:14:01] life
[1:14:04] your your Fallen conduction isn't going
[1:14:07] to stop that stop doubting it Abraham
[1:14:09] I'm your shield and your exceeding
[1:14:12] reward I won't even entertain an
[1:14:14] accusation against you I won't stop till
[1:14:17] I get you home
[1:14:19] Hallelujah
[1:14:23] if you think about
[1:14:25] Ezekiel he
[1:14:27] gives a beautiful I don't have time
[1:14:28] tonight I'm already out of time but
[1:14:32] Ezekiel breaks down the ministry in the
[1:14:34] priesthood
[1:14:35] in Prophecy
[1:14:37] and he goes talking about a certain
[1:14:39] family line
[1:14:40] and you're going to have priests and
[1:14:43] Levites who are working at various
[1:14:45] stations in the ministry on behalf of
[1:14:49] Israel all throughout the the temple and
[1:14:53] you're going to have them around the
[1:14:55] outside you're going to have them around
[1:14:56] the inside everybody's going to have a
[1:14:58] job they're going to be moving around
[1:14:59] you're going to come in and there's
[1:15:00] going to be somebody at the Brazen altar
[1:15:02] there's going to be somebody to wash
[1:15:03] your sacrifice and there's and then
[1:15:05] you're gonna and then there's an inner
[1:15:06] cord and there you've got a table of
[1:15:08] shoe bread and you've got ministers who
[1:15:10] who are working in there to keep those
[1:15:12] seven candles burning and keep those
[1:15:13] lamps trimmed and keep the oil filled up
[1:15:17] foreign
[1:15:18] but Ezekiel begins to talk about these
[1:15:21] priesthood
[1:15:22] and they have all of this ability to
[1:15:25] minister to the people concerning the
[1:15:28] things of God but there was one
[1:15:30] particular group of priests that God
[1:15:33] said now to them they are going to be
[1:15:36] the line that I anoint that will tell
[1:15:40] you and and and instruct you between
[1:15:43] right and wrong
[1:15:47] and that's exactly what I needed
[1:15:49] because I didn't just need in this day I
[1:15:53] didn't just need a minister who could
[1:15:56] tell me Jesus loves me this I know for
[1:15:58] the Bible tells me so I needed somebody
[1:16:01] who could yeah that you know Jesus died
[1:16:03] to sex Sinners thank you oh he loves the
[1:16:05] world Jesus loves thank you thank you
[1:16:07] that's all true I love it but in a world
[1:16:09] that's upside down who's going to tell
[1:16:11] me what's right and wrong
[1:16:14] I can't have a priesthood who can just
[1:16:16] introduce me I gotta have a an anointing
[1:16:19] I gotta have a seed line that can say
[1:16:22] this is right and this is wrong and
[1:16:24] there's no doubt about it and God heard
[1:16:27] that that's what you and I needed today
[1:16:29] we needed one voice who could Ascend
[1:16:32] higher and no and sure I appreciate
[1:16:34] nominal ministers I appreciate anybody
[1:16:37] who is preaching the gospel but I needed
[1:16:39] somebody to tell me this is right and
[1:16:42] this is wrong and because so many of
[1:16:44] those ministers are siding with the
[1:16:46] world and they're letting the world come
[1:16:48] into their churches and they're letting
[1:16:50] their women dress and do and they're
[1:16:52] letting their men go and say but I had
[1:16:54] somebody
[1:16:57] who could say you're not of this world
[1:17:02] Hallelujah
[1:17:06] you see I wanted to stand before him in
[1:17:09] perfection
[1:17:10] and in my heart
[1:17:12] I was crying for something more I'm here
[1:17:15] to tell you today let me give you a
[1:17:16] testimony he responded
[1:17:19] oh Hallelujah he would say why did he
[1:17:22] respond he wasn't looking for more
[1:17:24] Angels he wanted more than just mere
[1:17:27] friends to sit at his table he wanted
[1:17:29] more I wanted to believe there was more
[1:17:31] and and not just to have more but I
[1:17:35] wanted to believe I could be more and I
[1:17:37] heard from him you can do all things
[1:17:39] through Christ you can be everything
[1:17:42] that God has ordained for you to be and
[1:17:45] that's the Cry Of My Heart Lord I want
[1:17:47] to be more I want to be more
[1:17:51] and the Holy Spirit Echoes back to me
[1:17:54] there's more to be
[1:17:57] Hallelujah
[1:17:59] oh my
[1:18:01] my when you go further
[1:18:04] friends then
[1:18:06] you know when you when you think about
[1:18:07] what God built
[1:18:09] and called it good
[1:18:12] and said it's not only good
[1:18:14] it's very good
[1:18:17] and the last place
[1:18:19] not going to put it up on the screen
[1:18:21] well I might Ethan let's go to Genesis
[1:18:24] 28 13. this last time in Genesis
[1:18:27] not in the Bible
[1:18:28] but in Genesis you're going to see the
[1:18:31] last time
[1:18:32] he's going to use this term Lord God
[1:18:36] Genesis 28 13 he's talking to Jacob
[1:18:40] Jacob has ran for his life he's a
[1:18:42] shyster
[1:18:44] and behold
[1:18:46] the Lord stood above it and said
[1:18:49] I am
[1:18:50] the Lord God of Abraham thy father
[1:18:55] and the god of Isaac
[1:18:57] the land
[1:18:58] where on thou liest to thee will I give
[1:19:03] it and unto thy seed
[1:19:08] the last place that we see this term in
[1:19:11] Genesis
[1:19:12] he's standing above Jacob in a dream
[1:19:16] and he says the very ground you're lying
[1:19:19] on I'm the very Lord God of thy father
[1:19:22] Abraham I'm the god of Isaac he's going
[1:19:25] to be the god of Jacob from here on
[1:19:27] you're not going to see that term Lord
[1:19:28] God but we're going to find that he's
[1:19:30] the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob the
[1:19:32] god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[1:19:35] why why why can't he now say Oh you mean
[1:19:39] there's a reduction no now he's got a
[1:19:41] seed line to represent the other side of
[1:19:43] that do you understand now there's a
[1:19:46] family now he can move and because later
[1:19:48] he's going to come to Moses and he's
[1:19:50] going to be Jehovah because he said I
[1:19:52] wasn't fully known like that back then
[1:19:54] but now I got a family and I'm going to
[1:19:57] bring him out of Egypt and I'm going to
[1:19:58] take him into a Promised Land
[1:20:01] is he still going to be the Lord God of
[1:20:03] course is he still going to still going
[1:20:04] to be God he always was
[1:20:06] does the bible use the term more of
[1:20:08] course it does but the point in Genesis
[1:20:10] the seed chapter he never uses it again
[1:20:13] in Genesis after this one right here
[1:20:15] because God had said all he needed to
[1:20:19] say this Covenant was going to last
[1:20:22] Jacob all the way through the remainder
[1:20:26] of his ups and downs his ins and outs
[1:20:29] his weaknesses and his mistakes his
[1:20:31] lying and sneaking and conniving and
[1:20:33] stealing and and cheating and conning
[1:20:35] and but that covenant's not going to
[1:20:38] break that word I am the god of thy I'm
[1:20:41] the Lord God of Abraham my father and
[1:20:43] I'm going to make a covenant with you
[1:20:45] the ground you're laying on I'm going to
[1:20:47] give it to you and your seed line
[1:20:50] and that last that promise lasted Jacob
[1:20:53] all the way till he met an angel and
[1:20:55] wrestled it out and from that hour he
[1:20:58] was a prince and God had re-established
[1:21:01] the line the Royal seed line in the
[1:21:03] Earth forever
[1:21:06] and he would never have to that model
[1:21:09] would never have to be changed
[1:21:12] that model would never have to be
[1:21:14] changed he would never change this model
[1:21:17] he what's the model brother Jason he
[1:21:20] uses a revelation of his word and his
[1:21:24] word is him he what is a new birth it's
[1:21:26] a revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[1:21:30] personally it's the same model Jacob met
[1:21:33] him personally and that turned him into
[1:21:36] a prince forever and that same principle
[1:21:39] is working tonight that same God can
[1:21:42] meet you right where you stand he's the
[1:21:44] same God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he's
[1:21:48] the same God of Moses he's the same God
[1:21:50] of Jesus he's the same God of Paul he's
[1:21:53] the same God of Elijah
[1:21:57] hey
[1:21:59] and I'm here to tell you something
[1:22:00] friends
[1:22:03] when he descended in this day
[1:22:06] as a covenant angel with a rainbow over
[1:22:07] his head
[1:22:08] that was the same Covenant angel that
[1:22:11] that Jacob wrestled with in the Book of
[1:22:14] Genesis because why he's doing the same
[1:22:18] thing he has descended as a covenant
[1:22:21] Angel to say I set the order back there
[1:22:23] I got a seed line I've watched over it
[1:22:25] it's come up through it came through the
[1:22:28] Dark Ages it went through the martyrs it
[1:22:30] went through the stalk it went through
[1:22:31] the tassel it went through this chunk it
[1:22:34] came out into the grain
[1:22:35] I'm not gonna change my word I'm not
[1:22:38] going to change my model and I'm here to
[1:22:40] tell you the word he brought just like
[1:22:42] Jacob the Covenant he gave Jacob lasted
[1:22:45] all the way to his name change the word
[1:22:47] you have received will take you all the
[1:22:49] way to a body change
[1:22:51] Hallelujah
[1:22:54] oh can you rejoice on a Wednesday night
[1:22:56] and say I'll take that word and it'll
[1:22:59] take me all the way to a potty chain
[1:23:01] [Applause]
[1:23:05] you'll never need
[1:23:07] here to tell you I don't care how many
[1:23:10] mistakes you make you'll never need
[1:23:12] another Covenant
[1:23:13] you'll never need another messenger
[1:23:15] you'll never need another message you
[1:23:17] know why because you've got the
[1:23:18] messenger and the latter rain you've got
[1:23:21] Christ himself moving among us tonight
[1:23:23] and the power of his resurrection oh
[1:23:26] Hallelujah I feel such a surge of faith
[1:23:28] I think you can believe her anything
[1:23:30] right now I don't care what your need is
[1:23:32] why don't you stand to your feet and say
[1:23:34] Covenant I agree with the Covenant and I
[1:23:37] claim every Redemptive blessing that God
[1:23:40] has provided for me
[1:23:42] Hallelujah
[1:23:45] he's among his people
[1:23:48] the messenger of the latter rain
[1:23:51] listen friends
[1:23:53] once the latter rain fell
[1:23:57] and set the crop
[1:24:00] to lay in the presence of the August
[1:24:02] presence for maturing
[1:24:05] say oh
[1:24:07] don't we need another Revival not if you
[1:24:09] don't not if you're not if you don't
[1:24:10] want to I mean if you want to kill the
[1:24:11] crop
[1:24:13] once that you get a planting rain so you
[1:24:16] can plant and then you get a harvest
[1:24:18] rain
[1:24:18] and the Harvest rain once that Harvest
[1:24:20] rain comes now the grain is laying out
[1:24:23] there in the presence of the sun you
[1:24:24] don't want another rain
[1:24:25] because now it gets moving to maturity
[1:24:28] it's ripening it's becoming golden yeah
[1:24:31] I'm not looking for another Revival I'm
[1:24:33] looking for the coming of the Lord
[1:24:35] hallelujah I'm not chasing an eighth age
[1:24:37] or an eighth man
[1:24:40] the only message I'm ever going to need
[1:24:43] it's going to take me all the way to a
[1:24:46] body change
[1:24:47] it's the seed line of the Blessed
[1:24:51] it's a seed line that started in Genesis

[1:27:30] mystery he didn't say anything about it

[1:27:34] but he said he hasn't shown it but he
[1:27:36] has shown it in every verse of the Bible
[1:27:40] because there can't be any Revelation
[1:27:42] outside of the Bible

[1:33:30] of a shock that would be and uh Lord
[1:33:33] spared us from such a thing thanks be to

[1:33:38] decision concerning our brother Gideon
[1:33:40] amen and I knew him well and different
[1:33:42] ones knew him well here and so sister
[1:33:45] Kathy no doubt she wasn't hurt in the

[1:34:03] Gideon years ago 97 preached one of the
[1:34:06] greatest sermons I ever heard in my life
[1:34:08] called breaking the cycle and I thought
[1:34:10] how fitting it is that the last sermon I
[1:34:13] ever hear from him is going to go right
[1:34:15] up there alongside that one because it
[1:34:18] was it was epic and I so appreciate God
