[6:53] okay good deal you've got it perfect
[6:56] amen good morning class god bless you
[6:59] we're going to take our
[7:01] bible reading this morning sorry for the
[7:04] delay we were
[7:07] the booth didn't have my presentation
[7:09] somehow but we've got it rolling now so
[7:11] we're just going to take our first
[7:14] reading from revelation chapter one
[7:18] verse one we've been working on this
[7:20] series today
[7:21] is going to be uh we're gonna start at
[7:24] frame
[7:24] eight matt uh frame number eight
[7:28] um today is going to be our fourth
[7:30] installment of the revelation of
[7:32] the bible says the revelation of jesus
[7:34] christ which god
[7:35] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[7:39] things which must shortly come to pass
[7:43] all right let's pray master we commit
[7:45] ourselves now into your hands
[7:48] father for the lesson today we know
[7:50] you're in it
[7:51] and so we pray that you'll guide it and
[7:53] open eyes of understanding in jesus name
[7:56] amen so i'll be using this mic brother
[7:58] kev the whole time
[7:59] all right so we've been working
[8:03] now on the revelation of jesus christ
[8:06] and i
[8:07] i've been emphasizing to you and want to
[8:10] emphasize again today
[8:12] that it will be necessary to
[8:16] really lay in the foundation work on
[8:19] this very first chapter in fact is this
[8:21] very first
[8:22] verse because that if you don't really
[8:26] have a very crystal clear
[8:29] understanding of who jesus christ was
[8:33] and the revelation that was given to him
[8:36] and how that's even possible
[8:38] that he didn't know a certain thing and
[8:40] then the father gave him the revelation
[8:42] and then
[8:42] how is that working he's a human but
[8:45] he's uh he's
[8:46] he's a man plus he's the god man and so
[8:49] how it all relates uh it will be
[8:52] imperative
[8:53] that we understand that and
[8:57] one of the main reasons for that is
[9:00] is that because the book of revelation
[9:03] is the contextual
[9:06] record of christ working in his church
[9:11] and therefore in order for the church to
[9:13] clearly
[9:14] understand who she is and her position
[9:18] in um in the unfolding
[9:22] of god because that's where she's
[9:24] revealed
[9:25] just like eve was in adam and she became
[9:29] an expression of adam
[9:31] the church was in christ at calvary and
[9:34] was released at calvary
[9:36] but not initialized until the holy
[9:39] spirit came back upon her
[9:41] so the entire book of revelation is
[9:44] christ keeping his word when he said to
[9:47] his followers a little while
[9:49] and the world won't see me but you'll
[9:52] see me
[9:52] for i'll be with you even in you
[9:55] we find pilate talking to him about a
[9:58] kingdom
[9:59] and jesus makes a statement that more or
[10:02] less
[10:02] is to say we derive from it let me let
[10:05] me be clear i'm not quoting it but
[10:07] we derived the understanding that his
[10:10] kingdom
[10:10] were they present at that time would
[10:13] fight for him
[10:14] so that he would not be given to the mob
[10:16] or the pilot
[10:18] but that his kingdom wasn't yet because
[10:21] the holy ghost hadn't been given once
[10:23] the holy ghost was given
[10:25] then the kingdom of god is within you
[10:28] according to the bible
[10:29] the kingdom of god is with you and in
[10:32] you
[10:33] and so the book of revelation then
[10:36] is is going to be uh it came to the
[10:39] church as a sealed up closed-up book
[10:41] that's why paul never references it or
[10:44] quotes from it
[10:45] because that it was brought after paul
[10:48] had left the scene so we find then
[10:52] that it would be a future
[10:56] prophecy of what the church would go
[10:59] through at that
[11:00] time they had no idea they were going to
[11:03] go
[11:03] 2000 years through seven continuous
[11:07] uh church ages and uh not only were the
[11:11] ages contiguous in that they bordered
[11:14] aged age but they actually lapped over
[11:17] and so we find that it came all the way
[11:20] down to the last day so this is why we
[11:22] keep saying
[11:23] that more perfectly the book of
[11:25] revelation
[11:26] is the bride's book of the last day it
[11:29] is what gives her context to who she is
[11:32] how she got here how christ pulled it
[11:34] off and all down through the ages
[11:36] because we
[11:37] we now see so many things that have come
[11:40] to pass all right
[11:42] so now let me move on we've talked about
[11:44] high-res and lo-res and
[11:46] and that's how the book of revelation
[11:48] apocalypse is an uncovering
[11:50] we've discussed in the in our second and
[11:53] third installment
[11:54] that the revelation came by
[11:56] manifestation that's really the
[11:58] the main point that the book of
[12:00] revelation
[12:02] has been interpreted by manifestation
[12:06] and when when the word interprets itself
[12:09] by coming to pass
[12:11] your arguments against it are pointless
[12:14] that it's not open for conjecture
[12:17] anymore
[12:18] that when someone is confronted with the
[12:21] word made flesh
[12:22] they they no longer can plead ignorance
[12:25] at
[12:26] their trial they cannot plead ignorance
[12:28] because
[12:29] they saw the word made flesh before them
[12:32] and so we realize that unless they come
[12:34] up under a special exception
[12:37] to the law which as as the true jews
[12:40] were
[12:40] because they would have seen jesus but
[12:43] god blinded them
[12:44] to accomplish a greater purpose of
[12:46] bringing in the gentiles
[12:48] so they'll get a pass for all of those
[12:51] who were
[12:52] truly remember not all israel's israel
[12:54] but those who truly
[12:56] observed according to the faith of
[12:58] abraham they were given white robes the
[13:00] book of revelation
[13:02] tells us what became of all of those
[13:04] true jews
[13:05] who rejected him and we realized that
[13:07] there were some of them who were elected
[13:09] to be
[13:10] part of the of the old testament bride
[13:13] and there was but other of them were
[13:15] remnant
[13:16] they were given uh white robes and he
[13:19] noticed that the book of revelation
[13:20] says not for the testimony of jesus
[13:23] christ
[13:24] but for their for the testimony they
[13:26] held which was the testimony of the law
[13:28] of moses and they were true
[13:30] and they were loyal and they were
[13:32] sincere with
[13:34] real faith they weren't pretend jews
[13:37] so we find out then that we came in our
[13:40] last lesson
[13:41] uh after we dealt with the manifestation
[13:44] or revelation by manifestation as a
[13:46] subtitle
[13:46] we did two parts of that we looked at
[13:49] how the revelation
[13:51] of this day had come to bring us back
[13:54] to the place in scripture that we can
[13:56] begin to understand
[13:58] what who and why and where and how we
[14:01] are to be
[14:02] so the purpose of the message was then
[14:04] to bring us back
[14:05] uh to that understanding the
[14:07] understanding that traditions had taken
[14:09] away now we made a point to you last
[14:11] time
[14:12] that that that when malachi 4 says that
[14:15] it would take us back to the faith of
[14:17] the fathers
[14:18] or take us back to what paul preached
[14:21] and we made the statement to you and
[14:23] this is where kind of where we ended the
[14:25] last time
[14:26] that that if that were not true that if
[14:30] there
[14:30] if there was no falling away
[14:33] and there was no restoration then
[14:36] then what's it all about of the tens of
[14:39] thousands of denominations and subsets
[14:42] of denominations
[14:43] that we have today so we realize that
[14:46] that brother branham is going to begin
[14:49] to show
[14:50] how that the age fell away all right
[14:54] now here we have our
[14:57] where we begin our slide i want you to
[14:59] take a look at brother branham teaching
[15:01] on
[15:02] the spoken word is original seed uh man
[15:04] i could load it but i'll just let you
[15:06] run it for me
[15:07] next slide brother branham picks up from
[15:09] spoken words original c
[15:11] and when his bride comes she'll be
[15:15] the same product that he is virgin
[15:18] did christ belong to a denomination the
[15:21] obvious answer is no
[15:22] he was against them and they hated him
[15:24] for that
[15:25] did jehovah i think that's an
[15:28] overwhelming no
[15:29] neither does his bride she is part of
[15:32] him see
[15:33] she's not part of a man-made system she
[15:36] needs no dogma
[15:37] she won't have any she'll be absolutely
[15:40] virgin
[15:41] how how by the word that's the beauty of
[15:44] it by the word
[15:46] shall punctuate every word god says with
[15:48] an amen oh
[15:49] be it unto me see now watch him uh
[15:54] uh take a type from mary uh beat unto me
[15:57] according to thy word amen oh my there
[15:59] you are
[16:00] punctuate god's word when adam now watch
[16:03] him cover history
[16:04] when adam came to his wife she was
[16:07] pregnant
[16:09] and before they came together adam and
[16:10] eve she was pregnanted
[16:12] with the corrupt seed from the serpent
[16:15] when adam come to his wife
[16:17] he found her and this is an important
[16:18] point pregnant
[16:20] to death now you're going to find out
[16:21] there's a reason for that but when
[16:24] joseph
[16:24] the husband of mary the espoused of mary
[16:27] but when joseph the human come to his
[16:30] wife
[16:30] mary she was pregnanted with life
[16:34] the word of god now what caused the
[16:38] different pregnation
[16:39] because that adam's wife doubted the
[16:43] word
[16:43] that's right joseph's bride believed the
[16:47] word
[16:48] that's the difference next slide
[16:51] now now that's genesis all right watch
[16:53] him come forward now
[16:54] we fi he found her christ comes to his
[16:57] bride
[16:58] what does he find her same thing just
[17:00] like adam see why
[17:02] when she first started out now listen i
[17:04] don't want you to miss this
[17:06] when she started out she was a virgin
[17:09] she was going to be all right
[17:10] she went right on that early church used
[17:13] to be wonderful
[17:14] god gave him a bride and what did she do
[17:16] if you know your history if you know
[17:18] history in 606
[17:19] she goes right down there and pregnant
[17:22] herself
[17:23] with the roman dogma hold their ma an
[17:26] organization
[17:27] 606 is an important date in early church
[17:30] history
[17:31] because that's the up until that point
[17:34] there had been divided and shared
[17:36] authority throughout the christian
[17:38] church
[17:38] they had where we always talk about what
[17:41] happened at nicaea in 325
[17:43] that was just the the groundwork the
[17:45] seed laying it in there
[17:47] but we find out that the whole idea of
[17:49] presbyters and bishops and
[17:51] and and hierarchical orders of men
[17:55] uh uh conquering the laity and that they
[17:58] they started out with local churches
[17:59] then they began to cover certain areas
[18:01] then regions
[18:02] then whole uh national regions and they
[18:06] argued between constantinople
[18:08] and rome who should be the single bishop
[18:12] over the entire christian world and it
[18:15] was in 606 that that
[18:17] began that the pontiff of rome contrary
[18:20] to his predecessor
[18:22] who had eight years prior said nobody
[18:25] should take that title
[18:26] bishop of of the whole christian faith
[18:29] but eight years later his predecessor i
[18:31] want to say gregory that might stand
[18:32] correction
[18:33] but it's pretty i don't think it is greg
[18:35] i think gregory is the one who said we
[18:36] shouldn't take that title
[18:38] eight years later another one comes
[18:40] along and he actually in 606 begins to
[18:44] declare
[18:45] i am the bishop of the entire
[18:48] christian world and of course so brother
[18:51] branham picks this up now in 606
[18:53] she goes right down there and pregnant
[18:56] herself with roman dogma
[18:58] and organization next
[19:01] all right and from that on that old
[19:04] mother
[19:05] in the bible gave birth to churches and
[19:08] they were harlots which is a
[19:10] that's protestants because they was
[19:12] everyone
[19:13] born right out of her and everyone took
[19:16] her own thing
[19:17] organization now you see why
[19:20] i'm against it brother branham wasn't
[19:23] against people
[19:24] brother branham knew that god had
[19:25] children in all the organizations that
[19:27] he needed to rescue out of there
[19:29] but he was against the system all right
[19:32] now
[19:32] for the birth of the word is christ
[19:36] not of polluted with denominations the
[19:38] early church
[19:39] no denominations brother
[19:43] god laid the word down like that and the
[19:45] holy spirit
[19:46] irrigated it i love that description god
[19:49] laid down the word like that and the
[19:51] holy spirit
[19:52] irrigated it and there she went she
[19:54] brought forth children
[19:56] certainly all right that first aegis did
[19:58] that but this
[19:59] church can't do it she's too denominated
[20:03] see
[20:04] she can't do it she's got the world
[20:07] mixed up
[20:07] with her and i'm going to tell you
[20:09] something friends any time
[20:11] you allow the world to be mixed with
[20:13] your faith
[20:14] you become sterile and cannot reproduce
[20:17] the life of christ it effectively
[20:20] hinders you so she got mixed up with the
[20:23] with the
[20:23] though she's got the world mixed up with
[20:26] her look what they did now now what
[20:28] then she went whoring here we go back to
[20:31] genesis
[20:32] like adam's wife did in eden and
[20:35] jehovah's wife did in the days of samuel
[20:38] you remember that in the days of samuel
[20:40] that took a king divorced god
[20:43] her espoused husband and his word and
[20:46] said we want a king
[20:47] and samuel said god is your king but we
[20:50] want a king anyway and
[20:51] they couldn't deny that samuel had
[20:54] always told him the truth
[20:55] had always demonstrated the power of god
[20:57] had been a man above reproach
[20:59] and that he had thoroughly demonstrated
[21:01] that god would be a loyal husband but
[21:03] they didn't want that
[21:05] they chose of their own choosing to
[21:07] choose a man-made system
[21:09] which was a human monarchy next slide
[21:13] and his prophet his outlet to his word
[21:16] and she this is what she rejected went
[21:18] whoring
[21:19] like the rest of the nations and god
[21:22] divorced her
[21:23] same has he done today same act
[21:27] sons of the bride commit adultery see
[21:30] with the the bride god's son
[21:33] his bride from pentecost virgin with the
[21:36] word
[21:36] went whoring and committed adultery just
[21:40] like adam's wife did
[21:41] just like jehovah's wife did and here in
[21:44] the son's wife
[21:45] she goes whoring committing adultery
[21:47] with the romans
[21:49] god's plural gods do we have one more
[21:53] and for her lover's sake
[21:56] the roman gods tried to take her own
[21:59] husband
[22:00] and split him into three to please
[22:03] her lovers god have mercy sure
[22:07] they got hundreds of gods oh sure
[22:09] astarte the sun god balaam sun god and
[22:11] queen of heaven
[22:12] all that stuff there so the bride to
[22:15] please
[22:16] her ill-famed lovers
[22:19] uh now hold right there at that blank
[22:21] screen so
[22:22] we're realizing then that brother
[22:24] branham is
[22:26] proving that by history which is
[22:29] incontrovertible
[22:32] people can argue doctrine all day long
[22:34] history is incontrovertible
[22:35] the record is clear what you see him
[22:38] going back to genesis
[22:39] you can read it for yourself what eve
[22:41] did you can go
[22:42] into the books of the kings and read
[22:44] what the israel did
[22:46] you can come to the days of church
[22:48] history and you can see what the church
[22:50] did
[22:50] in 325 in 606 and then you can see how
[22:54] that protestantism came
[22:56] out of that system so you can see that
[22:59] what the bible prophesied
[23:01] in the book of revelation of the future
[23:04] because remember that's what the book of
[23:06] revelation
[23:07] is it's not it's not the record and this
[23:10] is an important point i'm getting ahead
[23:11] of myself on but i want to put this in
[23:13] here
[23:14] the book of revelation is not the work
[23:17] of
[23:17] jesus of nazareth
[23:20] that was a work of that god did
[23:24] that was the man who the logos
[23:27] lived in and god was in him
[23:31] reconciling the world to himself but the
[23:33] book of revelation
[23:35] is the work of jesus the logos
[23:39] in his bride in his church you get that
[23:42] so it's it's not it's not different gods
[23:45] it's just
[23:45] god in a different mask and so he laid
[23:49] that body
[23:50] the body of the nazarene on the altar
[23:53] and it's laid there interceding for
[23:55] ignorance interceding for our sins
[23:57] it's an advocate thank god we have it
[24:00] it's a perpetual atonement
[24:02] that even before you commit a sin you're
[24:04] already forgiven
[24:07] even before that you've even done
[24:10] anything wrong there's already a blood
[24:12] there speaking for you at all times
[24:14] now it only speaks for his family
[24:16] because only the only the predestinated
[24:18] are considered in redemption
[24:19] because it's those who he buys back so
[24:22] we realize then that brother branham is
[24:24] showing
[24:25] and proving by the bible and proving by
[24:28] history
[24:29] that we were to come down to an end time
[24:31] and there would have to be
[24:33] a restored message to bring the body
[24:37] back to the original faith so that
[24:40] christ
[24:41] works through her again unhindered all
[24:44] right
[24:44] now i want you to look at a unique
[24:47] quality
[24:48] this is a this is a one-off
[24:51] for this age there was there was no
[24:54] other age
[24:55] in the new testament era like what
[24:57] you're about to read
[24:59] the last time this uh characteristic is
[25:02] seen
[25:03] is in the days of enoch and after enoch
[25:06] who was translated it's not seen again
[25:08] until the day and hour that we live in
[25:10] all right brother brother matt let's go
[25:13] i'm going to close with this brother
[25:15] branham in countdown 1964. but now
[25:18] friends may i say this
[25:20] it has come to the age of astronaut
[25:23] so that wasn't paul's day that's this
[25:25] day come to the age of astronaut
[25:28] all right see we don't have more than
[25:30] what paul
[25:31] had in on in revelation but we do have a
[25:34] different type of manifestation because
[25:36] there's a different anointing
[25:37] on this age to accomplish a different
[25:39] purpose all right
[25:41] remember that we're not looking to go on
[25:44] in church ages this is the harvest age
[25:48] we're looking to take a body change that
[25:51] paul prophesied was coming
[25:53] went to the third heaven came back with
[25:55] the evidence that it's there
[25:56] it's real and he heard things even in
[25:58] the presence of god all right
[26:00] so he says we've now this has come to
[26:03] the age of astronaut we've
[26:05] we have moved out of the airplane age
[26:07] see their
[26:08] astronaut would have meant that would
[26:11] have been a foreign
[26:12] uh word in any language to paul
[26:14] astronaut what's an astronaut
[26:16] all right now we have moved out of the
[26:19] airplane age
[26:20] we've got more power now the astronaut
[26:23] age has come in what is it
[26:25] not a we've come into a spiritual age of
[26:28] astronaut see going above
[26:30] it's not it's the same spirit only more
[26:33] power
[26:34] only lifted higher can go higher see
[26:37] more believe more be more like christ
[26:39] not the automobile not the horse and
[26:41] buggy
[26:42] not even the airplane but the astronaut
[26:44] he sweeps on
[26:45] and above each one now it's interesting
[26:49] because
[26:50] that uh that when we when we talk about
[26:53] that this is the time of the unfulfilled
[26:56] portion
[26:57] of the original word that takes place in
[26:59] this last age
[27:01] uniquely closer to the body change than
[27:04] the initial church
[27:05] under the apostles and so we we realized
[27:08] that
[27:09] that the word astronaut let me give you
[27:11] this i think i have it
[27:13] the word astronaut means a person
[27:17] who is trained to travel in a spacecraft
[27:21] all right now let's read on it's called
[27:23] the eagle age in the bible god calls his
[27:26] prophets
[27:26] eagle age and we realize over in the
[27:29] bible we find out in malachi 4 that were
[27:32] promised that in the last days
[27:34] now he likes his prophets to eagles he
[27:37] calls himself
[27:38] eagle he is the great jehovah eagle so i
[27:41] want to make the point
[27:42] because i'm not going to get to expound
[27:43] on this today because i'm out of time
[27:45] but i'm not i'm not suggesting that
[27:48] that that that paul and that church
[27:51] under the son of man ministry
[27:53] didn't have the same power but it's just
[27:55] simply god
[27:56] giving the anointing to accomplish a
[27:58] different person
[28:00] you understand all right that seed had
[28:02] to go into the ground
[28:03] so there's no need to give them an
[28:05] astronaut anointing
[28:07] there's no need for an eagle anointing
[28:09] they're not going to be lifted off the
[28:10] earth this
[28:11] is the age that gets lifted off the
[28:13] earth all right so it's the same spirit
[28:16] all right but now it's just a different
[28:18] manifestation
[28:19] so he says he is the great jehovah eagle
[28:21] he's able to achieve to himself a bride
[28:24] he is going to in the last days be able
[28:26] to get a bride
[28:27] that with a ministry that's so exactly
[28:29] like a man
[28:30] and his wife becomes one very quickly
[28:33] and when jehovah gets his people like
[28:36] him
[28:36] then he lives in his people they are one
[28:39] it fulfills
[28:40] the scripture exactly what he said in
[28:42] saint john 14
[28:43] he that believeth on me the works that i
[28:45] do shall he do also
[28:46] it also fulfilled what jesus said would
[28:48] take place as it was in the days
[28:50] of sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[28:52] the son of man next
[28:54] and when jehovah gets his people like
[28:56] him then he
[28:58] lives in his people they are one ah it
[29:01] fulfills the scripture exactly what he
[29:02] said in saint john oh i've read this
[29:04] already go to the next
[29:05] the next i must have double posted that
[29:07] now is the astronaut age
[29:09] and the astronaut sees things that the
[29:12] horserider automobile airplane either
[29:14] sees
[29:14] he goes higher the airplane is still
[29:17] down here bouncing around in the clouds
[29:18] and having blowouts and
[29:19] hit downs and everything else but he
[29:21] keeps but he goes beyond the clouds of
[29:24] creeds and denominations moves up
[29:26] into the heaven plum away from
[29:28] everything
[29:29] the astronaut age we are living in the
[29:32] astronaut age just as sure as god has
[29:34] testified by the natural happenings
[29:36] there
[29:37] so is he testifying now that if we've
[29:40] achieved an astronaut
[29:41] god has achieved what he promised to
[29:43] achieve in the last days
[29:45] according to malachi 4. amen
[29:48] amen is there another one i think that's
[29:50] it okay
[29:52] so god bless you we're going to be out
[29:54] of time with that
[29:55] amen and uh the service will begin let's
[29:58] pray
[29:59] the regular service will begin shortly
[30:00] father we thank you for your word today
[30:03] and master we commit it now to you keep
[30:05] the people's minds and hearts open to
[30:08] learning
[30:08] because we're just getting we're just
[30:10] getting into the
[30:12] into the real gears and meat of it lord
[30:14] and so we want to understand it clearly
[30:17] so i commit it to you in jesus name amen
[30:20] that's where we'll begin uh on our next
[30:22] lesson we'll begin right back there with
[30:24] countdown
[30:25] and then i won't because there's a lot i
