[0:00] and uh looking forward to a wonderful
[0:02] time in the Lord this
[0:04] morning
[0:06] um just thought we'd open up this
[0:09] morning with if you want to stand with
[0:12] me I'm just going to
[0:15] read of the book of Psalms this morning
[0:18] Psalms
[0:22] 133 it says behold how good and how
[0:25] pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell
[0:27] together in unity it is like the
[0:30] precious ointment upon the head that ran
[0:32] down upon the beard even Aaron's beard
[0:34] that went down to the skirts of his
[0:36] garments as the Dee of Hermon and as a
[0:39] dew that descended upon the mountains of
[0:41] Zion for there the Lord commanded the
[0:45] blessing even life forever
[0:49] more Our Father we thank you for this
[0:51] grace and mercy you bestowed upon us to
[0:53] be able to come together and Lord we ask
[0:56] you to just bless us this day that truly
[0:58] you the Holy Ghost will will bring us in
[1:00] unity and in harmony together in the
[1:03] lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:05] Christ we give thanks
[1:08] amen so you may be seated my brothers
[1:10] God bless you
[1:14] um seeing there's several Brothers here
[1:17] that uh has not been part of our
[1:19] meetings uh just wanted to give you a a
[1:23] brief overview of of what we what we do
[1:25] in the ministers meetings that we've now
[1:28] this we're now in our 15 year of these
[1:31] meetings and we've not one
[1:34] time had a brother and slap another
[1:37] brother kick another brother throw
[1:39] anything at another brother or anything
[1:40] like that not
[1:43] once you know there was a lot of things
[1:45] that happened in the past and I've heard
[1:46] a lot of
[1:48] stories I was never a part of
[1:50] that thank the Lord I've never been a
[1:53] part of that and so by God's grace we've
[1:57] never had that we've had some of the old
[2:00] Fighters come and try but by God's grace
[2:05] he's given us the the mercy and the
[2:08] grace to be a little more mature today
[2:11] so you know um we all come together
[2:16] and I'll send out a flyer like this to
[2:19] all the brothers that's on the mailing
[2:21] list so if you're not on the mailing
[2:23] list I'm on the email list if you'll get
[2:25] your email to me I'll see to it that you
[2:27] receive the the uh
[2:30] flyer um we have a website it's called
[2:37] mmm.com me message I mean
[2:41] ministers how did I put it message
[2:44] ministers meetings of the hour or
[2:46] something like that you'll have to
[2:48] forgive me it's been a few years since I
[2:50] put it up but um I post it on the email
[2:54] that I send out our meetings are all
[2:57] topic centered so
[3:00] the last meeting we were at this topic
[3:03] that we have today which is what do we
[3:06] look for to bring Perfect Harmony and
[3:09] unity among the elect was chosen at the
[3:12] last meeting so it came out of the the
[3:15] the congregation of
[3:17] Brothers uh you know somebody brings up
[3:19] a topic we vote on it sometimes there
[3:22] may be two or three different topics
[3:25] many times we've had a brother over here
[3:27] has a topic a brother over here has a
[3:28] topic and as we
[3:30] start looking at it it winds up being
[3:32] one topic uh because they're really
[3:35] looking at something but as we're all
[3:37] individuals it comes out of my mouth a
[3:40] different from comes out of yours and so
[3:42] you know many times that happens but um
[3:45] sometimes we'll have three or four
[3:46] topics and then we just vote to choose
[3:48] which one and go from there and so when
[3:51] we come together we have the the morning
[3:54] session which is it may be one brother
[3:58] like it's going to be today brother uit
[4:00] or it may be two brothers we have had as
[4:03] many as three in the morning
[4:04] session um and that just depends on the
[4:08] host Pastor sometimes they'll have me to
[4:10] choose sometimes the host Pastor chooses
[4:13] sometimes it'll be a combination of the
[4:15] two of us so it just however the Holy
[4:18] Spirit leads that's what we're trying to
[4:20] accomplish not what we want to do not
[4:23] what I believe it's not what you believe
[4:25] but it's what the holy spirit is trying
[4:26] to bring to us and every one of us from
[4:30] the youngest to the eldest has a part to
[4:32] play uh I want uh you know the Lord put
[4:35] this on my heart uh 15 16 years ago and
[4:39] I tried to get away from it didn't want
[4:42] I didn't want to be I didn't want to be
[4:45] you know a person pushing it but that's
[4:47] what the Lord did and when I refused to
[4:49] do it he started taking things away from
[4:53] me until finally I said I give Lord and
[4:58] so uh looking back over the years I can
[5:01] understand why we're doing it because
[5:02] we've had a lot of many blessings
[5:04] amongst us and so as we we go about this
[5:08] brother Tim has you know a time frame
[5:10] that he has to meet because we have to
[5:12] go to lunch we'll go to lunch and then
[5:14] we'll come back and when we come back
[5:16] that's when everyone in the the
[5:19] congregation of Brethren has the
[5:20] opportunity to speak if they want to
[5:23] there's no pressure on you if you want
[5:25] to find if you don't find um if you just
[5:27] want to listen that's fine
[5:30] um but we try to divide that time up
[5:33] between equally amongst the Brethren and
[5:36] so when we do
[5:37] that I wind up being the
[5:41] timekeeper the clock is not favorable
[5:44] Brothers I mean you know it's just like
[5:46] the guy with the basketball and he's
[5:48] he's
[5:49] got 0.1 second it's not favorable you
[5:53] know he's got to get rid of that thing
[5:56] right now and so when the clock clock
[5:59] goes goes off it's time to stop and so I
[6:01] always try to give the brothers a
[6:03] warning hey you know if you see me
[6:06] sitting there
[6:07] waving I'm letting you know you got
[6:10] about a minute left it's time to wrap it
[6:13] up when you hear the hear the clock go
[6:15] off that's not the time to wrap it up
[6:18] it's time to sit down and so and it's
[6:21] not because we want to be ugly it's not
[6:24] because we want to stop the holy spirit
[6:27] it's because we're supposed to perform
[6:29] our
[6:31] brother you and and so that that's you
[6:34] know that's the Simplicity of it is
[6:35] we're supposed to prefer our brother and
[6:38] whenever it's his time we want to uh we
[6:40] want to take care of his time as much as
[6:43] possible now I'll tell you and some of
[6:45] the brothers here know that at times
[6:47] I've given Brothers some extra time
[6:50] because
[6:51] again we're not a denomination we're not
[6:54] an association there's no laws we have
[6:57] one law and that's the law of the Lord
[6:59] Lord the law of the Holy Ghost and so if
[7:01] he puts it on my heart to let him go
[7:03] you're just going to have to have have
[7:04] confidence in me that the Lord's Lord's
[7:07] let led me to do that because they can
[7:10] tell you I'll sit you down I will get up
[7:14] I will stop you I will sit you
[7:16] down but also the other thing is we are
[7:20] not here to promote a Ministry we are
[7:23] not here to tear down a Ministry it's
[7:26] not allowed now that's not to say a
[7:28] brother can't say hey we're having a
[7:29] meeting or something like that no but
[7:33] we're not here to lift somebody up we're
[7:36] not here to tear anybody
[7:38] down we're here to lift up Jesus Christ
[7:41] and we are here to destroy Satan's
[7:43] kingdom that's our purpose but my
[7:45] brother's not Satan you
[7:48] know you know we can all at any time
[7:52] have the wrong
[7:53] Spirit I've had it we've all we've all
[7:56] been in that case so we do our best to
[7:59] come together in a spirit of love and
[8:01] harmony and I have been just as blessed
[8:05] by Brothers I never heard of before in
[8:07] my life as I have brothers that I've
[8:09] known most of my life because I've
[8:13] learned from the Lord that I can only
[8:16] see so
[8:18] much I can't see through your eyes and
[8:21] you can't see through mine but what the
[8:23] Lord shows you if I can have
[8:27] Grace to come to it with an open
[8:31] mind that the Lord is trying to speak to
[8:34] me then I can see things I never saw
[8:37] before I never caught before my buddy
[8:40] sitting back there brother Clark
[8:42] Thomas he and
[8:44] I we're very different he he he always
[8:48] approaches things from a point of view
[8:50] that Tim Calhoun I can't approach it
[8:53] from that point of
[8:54] view and it's not that it's it's his bad
[8:57] or I'm I'm wrong or or he's right but
[9:00] it's we're two different people and I'll
[9:02] sit there and I'll say man that is
[9:04] awesome I love that and so as the Lord
[9:08] has blessed us at this point to come
[9:10] together in that that's what we're
[9:12] trying to accomplish is that the Lord
[9:15] can open his word to us it's not
[9:19] something new we're not trying to bring
[9:21] anything that the prophet didn't
[9:23] say but we're trying to get all that he
[9:26] said and that's what we're looking to do
[9:28] and so I'm going to get out of the way
[9:30] so brother Tim can can have all the time
[9:32] that he needs and so L God bless you
[9:34] Brothers why don't we stand as brother
[9:36] Tim
[9:37] comes God bless you my
[9:58] brother
[10:04] well we're going to read the word of
[10:06] God so that's why we're standing not for
[10:10] me amen I want to say I appreciate being
[10:14] here together with you can everybody
[10:15] hear okay all right so I appreciate
[10:18] being together with you uh Minister
[10:20] brothers and to share share the same
[10:23] burden that you have of the message of
[10:25] the hour I remember you know when I I
[10:29] was just a young preacher boy myself and
[10:32] when brother and you know right shortly
[10:35] after brother brandom left it seemed
[10:37] like um you know the attitude among the
[10:40] ministry was uh who's going to be the
[10:42] greatest Among Us and who's going to
[10:44] take the Manel now and you know who will
[10:47] Who who will be uh you know the jockey
[10:50] for position one's going to be J and
[10:52] one's was going to be Elisha and another
[10:55] Joshua and another you know there
[10:57] everyone trying to take their position
[10:59] and whatever else and um but you know I
[11:04] I don't believe there's any big ones or
[11:05] little ones Among Us and it's just the
[11:08] graciousness of brother Jason that has
[11:10] asked me to to uh speak today so you
[11:14] know I I don't have any message of my
[11:17] own I just love the Lord with all my
[11:19] heart and and I just um want to serve
[11:23] the Lord together with you so I'm here
[11:24] to encourage you in the things of God
[11:27] and maybe just um impart a little
[11:30] something to you today that might be a
[11:32] blessing that you could take home and
[11:35] study and look at and and consider but
[11:38] let's let's look to Joel chapter 2 and
[11:41] verse 25 and then we'll
[11:44] pray and I will restore to you the years
[11:47] that the Locust has eaten the cankerworm
[11:50] the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my
[11:52] great Army which I sent among you and
[11:55] you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[11:57] and praise the name of the Lord Lord
[11:59] your God that it dealt wondrously with
[12:02] you and my people shall never be ashamed
[12:06] and ye shall know that I'm in the midst
[12:08] of Israel and that I am the Lord your
[12:10] God and none else and my people shall
[12:13] never be ashamed and it shall come to
[12:16] pass afterward that I will pour out my
[12:18] spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and
[12:22] your daughters shall prophesy your old
[12:24] men shall dream dreams and your young
[12:26] men shall see visions and also upon the
[12:30] servants and upon the handmaids in those
[12:32] days I will pour out my spirit let's
[12:35] just bow our heads for a moment Lord
[12:39] Jesus as we bow before your throne of
[12:41] grace today we approach humbly before
[12:44] you Lord knowing that we are nothing and
[12:47] there and and I'm gathered here Lord
[12:50] with your minister servants today and
[12:53] speaking to those even around the world
[12:56] that may be hearing this Lord in today
[12:59] or in the days to come Lord you know the
[13:02] hearts of your people and the desire of
[13:04] our heart to see you manifest in your
[13:07] fullness asking Lord that you would
[13:09] Minister to us today and that as we
[13:12] would uh speak about things that is the
[13:16] hope that lies within us of the of the
[13:19] great things of God that you will just
[13:21] break the bread of life to us and speak
[13:24] to us in a very special way today as we
[13:27] give ourselves to you just serve you
[13:29] bless these ministers some are are
[13:32] evangelists are are workers in the
[13:35] church other pastors or whatever their
[13:38] position is Lord we pray that you'll
[13:40] bless them abundantly and use them for
[13:43] your glory we ask in Jesus name amen
[13:48] amen God bless you can be seated and uh
[13:51] want to thank you today for your
[13:53] attentiveness and for this opportunity
[13:56] and and uh I think the last time that I
[13:59] was in a Minister's meeting here in the
[14:02] US was when I was with brother Gerald
[14:05] Hughes way back many years ago now and
[14:08] and uh we went had a little Minister
[14:10] gathering in and so you know we I think
[14:13] the subject matter being of what will it
[14:16] take to unify the bride and you know I'm
[14:20] I'm going to take this original question
[14:22] up from my own angle and um I'm just
[14:26] going to look at it from this angle
[14:28] angled for you know because first of all
[14:31] the only unifier for the bride is the
[14:34] Holy Ghost amen there's no man no Bishop
[14:38] no Cardinal no Pope um that can unify
[14:42] the bride right so that's the only
[14:45] unifier that will work man-made and
[14:47] forced Unity is just denominationalism
[14:50] all over again amen so you know today
[14:53] I'm going to speak today on you know
[14:56] what will unify the bride and of course
[14:58] and that is the bride's
[15:01] Revival and I'm not taking this subject
[15:04] lightly I've studied it coming through
[15:06] 2500 quotes on
[15:09] Revival um and you know just looking at
[15:12] it and we'll we'll look at it in
[15:13] different phases of of course both the
[15:16] ausus uh Revival and the healen Revival
[15:19] are declared over and then of course the
[15:22] bride's Revival is already here is not
[15:25] something coming this was brought on by
[15:27] the seven Thunder uttering their voice
[15:29] in the seventh Angel's message and then
[15:32] we're going to just look into perhaps
[15:35] what is the bride's Revival and I'm sure
[15:39] uh even with the the you know the time
[15:41] frame that we have I will not be able to
[15:43] cover this adequately I will tell you
[15:46] that um I have um a lot of different
[15:49] quotes on the subject that I have
[15:53] categorized and um you know put to put
[15:56] together and uh if any of you you could
[16:00] contact Brother Jason if you don't have
[16:01] my contacts I'll be happy to send them
[16:04] to you um you know the whole list of
[16:06] things that I have went through as I've
[16:08] just studied and and as I laid them out
[16:11] by topic but nevertheless as we look
[16:15] into this today it's I I find it's even
[16:19] questionable sometimes in the mind of
[16:21] many as to whether we can even have a
[16:24] Revival in the in the message or the
[16:27] church age book actually
[16:29] brother brandham talked about the land
[16:30] is full of carnal impersonators and in
[16:33] the last day they will try to imitate
[16:38] that Prophet messenger the seven sons of
[16:40] ska um tried to imitate Paul Simon the
[16:44] sorcer tried to imitate Peter their
[16:47] impersonate impersonations will be
[16:49] carnal they won't be able to produce
[16:52] what the true Prophet produces when he
[16:54] says the Revival is over they will go
[16:57] around claiming in the great Revelation
[16:59] that what the people have is exactly
[17:02] right and God's going to do bigger and
[17:04] more and wonderful things among the
[17:06] people and the people will fall for it
[17:08] now I I'm going to go ahead and say you
[17:11] know by reading uh just a few um select
[17:15] quotes and we will read similar ones to
[17:19] the one I just read as we go along that
[17:21] it seems that there's no hope for
[17:24] Revival after the words revealed we are
[17:27] just a settle down in our churches and
[17:30] instead of being under a Baptist or
[17:33] Methodist or Pentecostal label we just
[17:36] take on a new label under the message
[17:39] Banner where Believers just warm a a a
[17:44] message Pew but God has brought us to
[17:47] the restored word and just to settle
[17:50] down and have churches under a new name
[17:53] with a new doctrine no that's not it we
[17:56] we have returned to the land of the body
[17:58] Bible to welcome back Jesus Christ the
[18:02] Messiah and we cannot be encumbered with
[18:05] the spirit of
[18:07] leoa and and and be without the spirit
[18:10] of Revival for for the the true Spirit
[18:15] of Revival is the Holy Ghost amen and
[18:19] this is the rapture age and the Very
[18:22] word rapture means intense pleasure
[18:27] enthusiasm you Foria
[18:30] El something totally opposite of Leo
[18:33] deia who is
[18:35] lukewarm so we know that the leodan ages
[18:40] already had great stirrings of the Holy
[18:43] Spirit the age would begin in um with
[18:46] the isua Street Revival in 1906 and then
[18:50] in 1946 the angel of God came to brother
[18:54] brandham as and was instructed to take
[18:57] um a message of Divine Healing to the
[19:00] world and this sparked the Great Divine
[19:03] Healing Revival of the 1940s and 50s and
[19:07] by the end of his ministry in
[19:10] 1965 um that Revival was over the the
[19:14] faith of the people were dwindling and
[19:16] churches were taking comfortable
[19:19] positions just settling down and each
[19:21] claiming their territories and having
[19:24] their turf
[19:25] wars um but maybe we might asked what
[19:29] was that Revival like and I just like to
[19:31] share a few things with you uh about
[19:33] that Revival from Brother Brandon's word
[19:36] he said and the message influence in
[19:38] bont he said I was here with my old
[19:41] friend brother Bosworth and Raymond
[19:43] Richie many years ago and many of the
[19:45] Brethren came over I I still believe the
[19:47] same gospel hadn't changed a bit just
[19:49] still the same but you see the Revival
[19:52] was going on then and where there's no
[19:54] Revival you just can't get things done
[19:57] the Ministry is far more advanced it was
[20:00] only telling you then this would come
[20:03] how many remembers that sure you do and
[20:05] it come just exactly like it said it
[20:08] would then I would take my the People by
[20:11] and lay my hands upon them I told you
[20:13] what he told me and just the way it
[20:15] happened it's just exactly it's never
[20:18] failed to be the truth each time and
[20:20] every time so it has to come from God no
[20:23] one could doubt it but you see the
[20:25] Revival is not on just your presence to
[20:28] walk in with the people why people would
[20:31] get out out of Cs and stretchers and
[20:34] walk around you just lay your hands upon
[20:37] them and my just send them just sent
[20:40] them whirling I I've seen prayer lines
[20:42] where be four or 500 people come through
[20:44] the lines and deaf dumb blind crossy not
[20:49] one of them failed but what was healed
[20:52] every one of them try it today see there
[20:55] is no fire in Rome when the fires went
[20:58] out in the temple at Vista the people
[21:01] went home see there's no Revival fire to
[21:04] back it up see that's it and and after a
[21:09] while if if the world stands they'll
[21:12] start living in a glare again see and
[21:16] that's the way it's always done passed
[21:17] over and missed him and that generation
[21:20] is to be judged for what passed over
[21:22] them they fail to see him Jesus Christ
[21:25] is alive this afternoon he is walking
[21:27] around here with us he's every
[21:29] presentence where two or three are
[21:31] gathered in my name I am in their midst
[21:34] believe that won't you so I mean it's
[21:36] like Israel in the journey they left the
[21:38] rock but the rock never left them amen
[21:41] The Rock followed them amen now this
[21:43] brings us to the thought of where
[21:45] brother brandham talks about the cycle
[21:47] of Revival and death and how it never
[21:51] fails and he he talks about you know
[21:55] like how history repeats itself that in
[21:58] the generations of Israel they would see
[22:01] one Revival in one generation to see
[22:03] only the fires fading in the next and
[22:06] the third generation Embers may be
[22:08] glowing slightly but in the fourth there
[22:11] will may be no vestage whatsoever of the
[22:13] original flame and then God lights the
[22:16] fire again the same process is repeated
[22:18] and it's simply a manifestation of the
[22:21] truth that God has no grandchildren
[22:24] salvation is not passed on by natural
[22:26] birth anymore than there's true to
[22:28] Apostolic succession it isn't in the
[22:31] word you can't start with truly you or
[22:34] you start out with truly Born Again
[22:37] Believers and when the next Generation
[22:39] comes along they're no longer just plain
[22:41] Christians but now they've taken on a
[22:43] denominational name and our Baptist or
[22:46] Methodist ex and so forth that's exactly
[22:49] what they are too you see they're not
[22:52] Christians you have to be born of the
[22:54] will of God not the will of man to be
[22:56] saved but these people people these
[22:58] folks are all coming together by the
[23:00] will of man now I don't say that some of
[23:02] them are not right with God not for a
[23:05] minute do I say that but the original
[23:07] fire has died down they are not the same
[23:11] anymore that fervent desire to please
[23:14] God that passion to know his word the
[23:18] cry for reaching out in the spirit it
[23:20] all begins to fade and instead of the
[23:23] church being on fire with the fire of
[23:25] God it is cooled off and become a formal
[23:28] of course that was what happened in
[23:30] Ephesus they were getting formal and and
[23:32] it moved right out in fact the matter is
[23:34] if you listen to brother Bram in the
[23:36] second seal he tells you how the devil
[23:38] got in the book of Acts church that you
[23:41] know that it first came there among the
[23:43] poor and and you know the servants and
[23:48] and and poor people so on like that and
[23:51] he said that's how the spirit fell and
[23:53] then they witnessed to their bosses and
[23:55] more fluent people and then they tried
[23:57] to bring people people to meeting and
[23:59] and they didn't want to bring them to
[24:02] that little dimly light lit places you
[24:04] know and so they wanted to dress it up
[24:06] make it more
[24:08] sophisticated and the next thing you
[24:10] know that nickan Spirit got in there
[24:13] said they didn't want them speaking in
[24:14] tongues and shouting and doing that they
[24:17] they didn't want the moving of the
[24:18] spirit anymore and that's how the devil
[24:21] got in the book of Acts church and here
[24:24] the cycle began where it began to die
[24:27] where the emphasis got moved away from
[24:30] the supernatural gospel to just an
[24:33] intellectual
[24:35] Revival now so you see he says that
[24:39] cycle of Revival and death has never
[24:42] failed now I I'm just I'm just one who
[24:45] believes that we're going to be a people
[24:47] who break the cycle right and the reason
[24:51] I get I have scripture for that because
[24:53] they that are alive and remain will not
[24:55] prevent those that are asleep so there's
[24:58] going to be somebody that is living in
[25:00] this generation that will break the
[25:03] cycle of Revival and death and go in a
[25:06] Rapture amen so you see so he he tells
[25:10] you know what happens that soon you know
[25:13] whirling come in they begin to read
[25:15] books that wasn't fit to read to let
[25:17] down the bars you know the whole thing
[25:19] The Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of
[25:21] the spirit was gone and all they kept on
[25:23] with the form but the fire had died down
[25:26] and and the blackness of ases is all
[25:29] about is
[25:31] left now as we look at that for moment
[25:36] going
[25:37] back this this revival in this last day
[25:43] started with an angel of God in May of
[25:47] 1946 which came to brother brandham as a
[25:50] light a whipping whirling Pillar of Fire
[25:55] that came into the room where he was in
[25:58] and out of it stepped a 6' 200lb man
[26:02] robed in white with shoulder length hair
[26:05] and we saying I've been sent from the
[26:07] presence of God to tell you of his
[26:09] strange and misunderstood life and that
[26:11] you're to take a gift of Divine Healing
[26:13] to the world and it would start a
[26:15] worldwide Revival and it did yes this
[26:19] message began with the
[26:21] supernatural an angel stepping through
[26:23] the portals between the natural and the
[26:26] supernatural the Mysteries that we hold
[26:29] dear today that have been revealed by
[26:32] the opening of The Seven Seals the seven
[26:35] angels coming faster than the speed of
[26:38] light came breaking through the
[26:41] dimension between the natural and the
[26:43] supernatural yes the message will climax
[26:47] with the
[26:49] supernatural yes with the dead in Christ
[26:52] breaching the portals between the two
[26:56] worlds glorifying their bodies and also
[27:01] changing the living and but and the
[27:04] living too will also breach the portals
[27:07] between the two worlds and meet their
[27:10] theophany and be changed in a moment and
[27:13] a twinkling of an eye amen the gospel
[27:16] started out 2,000 years ago with the
[27:20] supernatural it will end with the
[27:23] supernatural amen so you know going back
[27:27] over what brother Bon spoke of this
[27:29] great Revival that he witnessed he said
[27:32] I'm I'm one of the greatest revivals I
[27:34] believe the world's ever seen in these
[27:37] last 10 15 years it's been a Revival not
[27:40] just like the days of Billy Sunday or
[27:42] the wels Revival the days of Wesley
[27:44] Revival movie uh The Moody Revival Billy
[27:47] Sunday Revival it's been a worldwide
[27:49] sweeping Affair around the world great
[27:51] healing services and great Revival fires
[27:54] has burnt on practically every heel
[27:57] there is in the world right tonight over
[27:59] way over in the lands of Africa down in
[28:01] China Japan this gospel is being
[28:04] preached and people are being healed
[28:06] right this very moment very minute
[28:08] around the world and it has been one of
[28:11] the greatest revivals because I believe
[28:14] it's one of the last revivals this world
[28:18] will see a worldwide sweeping Revival
[28:22] but now in the last few years it's
[28:24] quietened out you don't notice the
[28:27] enthusiasm in the people that used to be
[28:30] I remember having the privilege by the
[28:32] Holy Spirit to spearhead that Revival
[28:34] that started when that angel Lord
[28:37] appeared on that River and and said that
[28:39] about many years ago and to see it
[28:41] happen and see it set ministers hearts
[28:44] of fire and everywhere revivals broke
[28:47] out why you could just simply walk into
[28:49] a building and people would just get up
[28:51] out of their Cs and stretchers and walk
[28:53] away heal you didn't even have to say a
[28:55] word just being there that's all it
[28:57] taken I remember one night in vandelia
[29:00] Illinois I walked in the meeting had no
[29:02] longer had been no more been in the
[29:05] meeting over five minutes and there
[29:07] wasn't a feeble person around the place
[29:09] anywhere wheelchairs pushed out piled up
[29:13] blind with seeing deaf and dumb speaking
[29:16] and just simply the spirit of God was
[29:18] present and he just healed the whole
[29:20] group of them now that's what you can do
[29:23] when that re when Revival is going but
[29:27] let that Revival fire die down then you
[29:30] can Harden it the people are still
[29:32] Christians but they're not revived into
[29:35] that spirit that great atmosphere that
[29:38] does something it's just like a forge in
[29:41] a blacksmith shop you got to get the
[29:43] iron hot before you go to pounding it on
[29:46] the Anvil if you don't you'll never
[29:48] straighten it out and that's what it
[29:50] takes to have a Revival is everybody
[29:53] everybody under the heat of the Holy
[29:56] Spirit that's brought down the powers of
[29:59] God and a Revival moving and there's
[30:01] prayer me then there's prayer meetings
[30:03] going day and night every minute
[30:05] everywhere why the people even wouldn't
[30:07] leave the
[30:08] grounds now but you know we asked
[30:11] ourselves a question did the Divine
[30:15] Healing Revival bring the promised
[30:19] Rapture no you know what it
[30:23] did what it did though it made bigger
[30:26] denominations oh yeah oh yeah brother
[30:29] Brandon said himself in question answer
[30:31] 64 I sent 34 of a million of my children
[30:37] to the Assembly of
[30:38] God and others of course we know went to
[30:41] the Oneness and Full Gospel
[30:44] moves you know brother bam compared it
[30:47] to Moses he said in Moses time this is
[30:49] from Paul a prisoner if you want to
[30:51] write the reference you know and I'll
[30:53] try to give you references as I go along
[30:56] and that might help you to at least take
[30:57] notes from Paul a prisoner you can study
[30:59] this he said Moses time he took him out
[31:02] in the desert kept him out there 40
[31:03] years stripped him of all his theology
[31:05] his ambition and what a time he could
[31:07] look back and see his failure and how we
[31:10] tonight ought to do the same when we see
[31:12] our ambition look at the healing
[31:15] campaign and see if the Lord did
[31:17] something a few years ago to start
[31:19] restoring healing to the sick and so
[31:23] forth everybody every organization it
[31:26] because if it didn't come into their
[31:29] organization they had to give them a
[31:32] Healer you see they they got interested
[31:35] only in only interested if it was for
[31:39] building their
[31:42] Kingdom now he would say to Tommy osbor
[31:46] when he asked you think I have a gift of
[31:48] Divine Healing he said brother Tommy
[31:51] after this revival starts like this
[31:53] there'll be so many Divine healers in
[31:55] the land it'll be pitiful people won't
[31:56] even
[31:57] uh I won't even want to have a meeting
[32:00] unless you got Divine Healing and Divine
[32:02] Healing is a minor you you can never
[32:04] major with the minor salvation is the
[32:06] main thing to the soul Divine Healing is
[32:08] just a minor thing but I said it'll come
[32:11] to pass because when the phenomena is
[32:14] done there's always a mixed multitude
[32:18] like there was in the days of Noah so I
[32:20] want you to get something for a moment
[32:23] and and we'll get to it in a minute
[32:25] remember this revival is not only
[32:29] produces the true it also will produce
[32:32] the false yes sir so it will produce
[32:36] twins so now even even in the midst of
[32:40] this Divine Healing movement there would
[32:42] be twins that would rise up both
[32:45] claiming to be sent from God yes and
[32:48] both having signs and wonders and and
[32:51] miraculous happen and watch this now as
[32:53] we go along so brother Bram finishing
[32:55] this up in Paul the prisoner now and
[32:58] what have we done let's look at just a
[32:59] moment we've done the same thing Moses
[33:01] did we went out and tried so hard to
[33:03] manufacture some kind of miracle I smelt
[33:06] a disease I got blood in my hand I
[33:09] manufacture a miracle and see what we
[33:12] got some of the men in such hard strains
[33:15] that's broke up become regular drunkards
[33:17] and neurotics and got their minds they
[33:19] switched all the way back in the order
[33:22] from the Pentecostal objective back to
[33:24] making organizations and things and you
[33:26] look at the the men that rose up trying
[33:30] to get in Realms and dimensions maybe
[33:32] that they didn't even belong in you know
[33:35] trying to manufacture a miracle you know
[33:37] you had and and and some some of it was
[33:40] not manufactured some of it was for real
[33:43] yes sir there were true Miracles that
[33:45] would fall you know but you'd have um it
[33:48] was reported in the news anyway that AA
[33:51] Allen died a drunk o o Jaggers tried
[33:54] every gimmick to keep in the light
[33:57] timelight oil in the hands and blood in
[33:59] the face it was a lot of that brother
[34:01] randam was when he preached about
[34:03] Sensations and and and emotion and so on
[34:07] it was O jiggers that he was correcting
[34:09] that move within the Pentecostal circles
[34:12] or Roberts prophesied that 900 foot tall
[34:16] Jesus who told him that to raise
[34:19] millions of dollars or God would kill
[34:21] him and and you know that's how his
[34:24] ministry would end and you know with
[34:26] with such an with such an emphasis such
[34:29] such crudeness you know um that that was
[34:33] so against the word but going back to
[34:35] Paul a prisoner what have we done we
[34:37] slew about one Egyptian now remember
[34:40] Moses went to deliver Israel he killed
[34:44] an
[34:45] Egyptian but it didn't deliver the
[34:47] people right right it didn't set anybody
[34:50] free amen now he said now that's right
[34:54] we've tried we've strained we paid we
[34:57] labored all night long in prayer
[34:59] meetings till we had no voice and try to
[35:01] manufacture something and soup up
[35:03] something and all these type of things
[35:05] and find it to be a total failure we
[35:08] need to going back to the desert right
[35:10] yes sir uh camp meetings and struggles
[35:13] why not just give up that's what you
[35:15] ought to do see go go back and give up
[35:17] why we have done the same thing they did
[35:21] same thing Moses did it doesn't do any
[35:23] good after 40 years he find himself a
[35:26] prisoner to the the word of God what we
[35:28] what we what do we try to do when that
[35:31] great blessing come out and the
[35:33] manifestations of these great things
[35:35] that God told us about that we must be
[35:37] born again how we must receive the Holy
[35:40] Ghost the baptism in the name of Jesus
[35:42] Christ all these other things here you
[35:44] see people instead of staying to that
[35:46] word harnessed to it what did they do
[35:49] they started their own denominational
[35:51] Theory which had already failed and try
[35:54] to manufacture something to look like
[35:57] the truth now now I I just want to tell
[36:00] you we need to do a little bit of self-
[36:03] inventory in this message and not just
[36:06] look out there and say they they they
[36:08] but also realize those Spirits keep
[36:10] moving forward amen now you said what
[36:13] have we got tonight but a a nation full
[36:15] of organized people who deny the
[36:18] scriptures of God who would call the
[36:19] life of the Holy Spirit it was mental
[36:22] telepathy he would refuse such to come
[36:24] into their Church they wouldn't permit
[36:26] you to mention one word of serpent seed
[36:28] eternal security and things that the
[36:30] Holy Spirit has revealed and proved to
[36:32] be the word I make challenge after
[36:34] challenge to come and prove it to me
[36:36] wrong and what have they got the same
[36:39] thing that Luther had the rest of them
[36:41] see slew an Egyptian now watch this what
[36:44] was it maybe he made somebody some man
[36:48] stop
[36:51] stealing or maybe live true to his wife
[36:56] all right but what did you make of him
[36:59] out of that a church
[37:03] member oh come join our group that
[37:07] stinking dead man was the only thing he
[37:10] could Point his finger to of his success
[37:13] of 40 years of training a stinking
[37:15] Egyptian laying there rotten and dead
[37:18] and that's about the way it is tonight
[37:19] the only thing we can point to this
[37:21] revival that is crossed over so-called
[37:24] is a stinking bunch of church members
[37:27] that know no more about God than a hot
[37:29] and Dot would know about an Egyptian
[37:31] Knight that would tell them about the
[37:33] word of God and they say I don't believe
[37:34] that I don't care what they say I don't
[37:36] believe that that's an awful thing to
[37:38] have to point back to for all the
[37:40] strains and the struggles and everything
[37:43] we got maybe we could point to a big
[37:44] school but it's dead we could point to
[37:47] an organization but it's dead it's
[37:50] thinking it's like the first thing that
[37:52] we pulled out of like a hog going to his
[37:54] wallow and a dog to its vomit when we
[37:57] return back one dead
[38:00] Egyptian and I just tell you I mean this
[38:02] is not what we want to accomplish amen
[38:05] we don't want to accomplish a bunch of
[38:07] you know just you know a few stinking
[38:11] dead church
[38:12] members somebody that we got to reform
[38:15] and you know be good and now you know
[38:18] kind of kind of be a a father to his
[38:21] kids and a husband to his wife all all
[38:23] those things are good but if if all the
[38:26] are is a church member when it's over
[38:28] with if all we've done is brought a
[38:31] message of reformation and it is not a
[38:34] message of
[38:35] transformation that transformed their
[38:38] lives and made real Christians out of it
[38:41] now out of that movement that began with
[38:44] a Revival at isusa street that Divine
[38:46] Healing Revival there are now
[38:51] 644
[38:53] million that's over6 billion p
[38:56] Pentecostal charismatic worldwide
[38:59] including members of Pentecostalism
[39:03] 19,300 denominations and
[39:13] fellowships think of
[39:16] that 6 almost 65
[39:21] billion
[39:24] Pentecostals produced out of Revival
[39:28] not only that
[39:34] 19,300
[39:39] denominations out of the Pentecostal
[39:42] message and the message of Divine
[39:46] Healing so what would another Divine
[39:51] Healing move
[39:54] produce let's go a little further what
[39:57] about
[39:58] America would she have another Revival
[40:02] you know the old Virginia boy I think he
[40:04] was from Virginia the Baptist preacher
[40:06] Jerry fwell and he he was he was sure
[40:09] there was a moral majority in America
[40:13] there's not it's an immoral majority
[40:16] it's not there America's a Godless
[40:19] Nation that's turned from the Turning
[40:21] from the lamb now to a dragon a beast
[40:23] that devours the spirit of the Spirit of
[40:26] lawlessness is taking over our country
[40:29] defund the police riding in our streets
[40:32] with sodomites screaming for the rights
[40:35] to kill their children transgenders in
[40:37] our streets declaring that they're
[40:39] coming after our kids and they are we
[40:43] just thought it was Sodom and Gomorrah
[40:44] 25 or 30 years ago it's Advanced now
[40:49] brother Bram tells us in God in
[40:51] Simplicity in Albuquerque he says um you
[40:55] hear me if you believe me to be a
[40:56] messenger from Christ to you if you you
[40:59] believe me if you're not in the kingdom
[41:01] of God you better press right quick if
[41:04] it will not get better it will grow
[41:07] worse all the time now just Mark that
[41:09] down just remember see whether that's
[41:12] right or wrong you see if it's going to
[41:14] be right or wrong it's not going to get
[41:16] better it's going to get worse it's
[41:19] going to get harder all the time the
[41:21] Revival is gone you're only gleaning in
[41:23] the field she's over now you say I
[41:26] disagree with it fine it's okay if you
[41:28] do that's all right that's my conviction
[41:31] conviction that's my hearing from
[41:35] Heaven I believe the leoan ages the
[41:38] Pentecostal age where she comes to the
[41:40] place of lukewarm and God Speer from her
[41:43] mouth from his mouth he goes again in
[41:47] this message super sign sort in 63 he
[41:50] said there'll never be a big Revival in
[41:53] America no more like that if you believe
[41:55] me to be a a prophet you remember that's
[41:58] the word of the Lord just watch and see
[42:00] if it isn't dying the churches are dying
[42:03] they are witheren away and it kills me
[42:05] inside of me to know that men and women
[42:07] that I love better than I love my own
[42:09] life that I give my life he goes ahead
[42:12] and trying to do God's service without
[42:15] his will that he and and this is the one
[42:18] in Los Angeles oh no Jeffersonville
[42:21] where where he talked about this
[42:23] so-called Revival that we're having you
[42:26] know and he said you know America God
[42:29] Bless America it's a it's a Christian
[42:31] country I I'm going to just tell you
[42:33] personally I got a little bit offended
[42:36] when Mr Obama stood up and said we're no
[42:38] longer a Christian Nation right and I
[42:42] thought what in the world what do you
[42:43] mean I mean we were founded on Christian
[42:45] principles as a nation what do you mean
[42:47] we're no longer a Christian Nation and
[42:49] then we have Mr Biden come along and
[42:51] said we're a pride
[42:53] Nation oh yeah now sister to the world
[42:57] this is what we are we are a pride
[42:59] Nation so you know we we have come as
[43:02] brother Brandon said now it's a million
[43:05] miles from being a Christian
[43:07] country I don't even pray for it how can
[43:12] I pray for it and it won't repent under
[43:14] the mighty powers of God demonstrated
[43:16] before it and deny it and closing the
[43:19] doors to it and and walking away so they
[43:22] rejected Revival he told us that a
[43:26] America in Israelite where the gospel he
[43:28] said they didn't come to the spiritual
[43:31] Feast that they were invited to you
[43:33] believe God has give America an
[43:35] invitation of the last 15 years to a
[43:37] great Revival to a spiritual
[43:41] Feast but did they come no sir they then
[43:45] to to reject to come is that a life
[43:48] worthy of gospel that they call
[43:51] themselves that again in super sign in
[43:54] sort in 63 there'll never be a big
[43:57] Revival in America no more like that if
[44:00] you believe me to be God's Prophet
[44:01] remember that's the word of the Lord
[44:03] just watch and see if it isn't dying the
[44:05] churches are dying they're withering
[44:07] away I believe that's a redundant but
[44:09] anyway America as he said there tonight
[44:13] that's the reason this nation stay she's
[44:15] doomed there's no hope for it she's
[44:18] crossed the line between judgment and
[44:20] mercy and she's elected what she has
[44:23] here to control the nation she's rot
[44:25] into the the core her politics is rotten
[44:28] and I I don't care what side of the vent
[44:30] you're on here today whether you're a
[44:33] diat or a a
[44:35] republican a Publican don't matter to me
[44:39] you can put whoever you want in the
[44:40] White House you're not going to turn her
[44:42] around we're doomed he talks about
[44:46] Russia the Holy Spirit was poured out on
[44:48] Russia which called was called called it
[44:51] a feast of Pentecost of spiritual Feast
[44:54] they turned it down he's referring back
[44:56] in the times of the um AR Armenians
[44:59] there when when they came over to the
[45:01] sakarians and the people there that
[45:03] receed warning to leave from uh there
[45:06] that they would all be destroyed if they
[45:08] didn't move out and and it came to pass
[45:11] that's why the sicarians were here in
[45:13] the United States having left Armenia
[45:15] but you know Russia turned it down and
[45:17] it turned to Communism England he said
[45:20] turned it down it's not just America
[45:22] it's the whole world yes yes amen you
[45:26] know I know America will burn with fire
[45:28] and I'm not defending that but the whole
[45:30] world's going to Def burn with fire amen
[45:33] but now so he talks about how that he
[45:36] bid three times he sent out and they
[45:38] didn't listen to the feast and he sent
[45:40] again he said go and compel those people
[45:43] to come and the table's got to be set
[45:45] the table's ready there's still room now
[45:48] listen and I believe that maybe maybe
[45:51] within the next few months or something
[45:53] a year or whatever it is God is going to
[45:55] send another shaking across the country
[45:59] for there's still there's somebody still
[46:02] out there somewhere that's a
[46:04] predestinated seed that the light has
[46:07] got to fall on somewhere somewhere in
[46:10] the world the nation itself is
[46:14] gone so the nation is gone but he said
[46:18] there's still a predestinated seed that
[46:22] the light has to fall on Amen so he says
[46:25] go God's going to send another shaken
[46:27] now we know of a certain we cannot
[46:31] reproduce ausa Street and neither should
[46:34] we try we cannot reproduce another
[46:38] Divine heand Revival or another
[46:40] worldwide sweeping Revival amen you see
[46:44] something that would accompany this
[46:46] great feed of adding 6 billion to the
[46:49] cost for the past 100 Years of
[46:53] Pentecostals and the charismatics have
[46:55] tried to Breathe new Revival fires into
[46:59] that and they have blown and blown upon
[47:02] the ashes of that Revival and the only
[47:05] result just being the the so of the P
[47:08] fires blackening their faces oh yes but
[47:12] remember remember in the midst of all
[47:15] this I I want you to catch this and this
[47:17] is from the era of God's Deliverance in
[47:20] 56 remember when God sends a Revival
[47:25] hell sins one
[47:29] two in the lamb and the dove in 1957
[47:33] brother bradam said here he said now we
[47:36] know in the last day there's going to be
[47:37] a Revival of the supernatural that is
[47:40] not going to be of
[47:41] God whoa let me read it again there's
[47:45] going to be a Revival of the
[47:47] Supernatural That's not going to be of
[47:50] God we know that but the way we to tell
[47:54] it is by the Bible that's right by the
[47:55] Bible because it said many will come to
[47:57] me in that day and say Lord have I not
[47:59] done this and that and he will say
[48:02] depart from me that's right that must be
[48:05] it it must be absolutely be thus sayith
[48:09] the Bible so again as we look at this
[48:13] remember there will be a Revival of the
[48:16] supernatural that is not going to be of
[48:19] God now is now let me get something
[48:23] straight it is not that the devil is
[48:27] going to do Supernatural and bring
[48:29] healing and and no we have done Mighty
[48:31] Works in thy
[48:35] name so it is not I want to get this
[48:38] point I I realize we we talk about the
[48:41] anointed once at the end time but I want
[48:43] you to get something really clear down
[48:45] in your heart the rain is sent for the
[48:49] wheat amen the anointing is for the
[48:53] grain yes but but because the others you
[48:58] know are in the same field they get
[49:01] watered too and they bring forth fruit
[49:04] of the seed that they are yes so don't
[49:07] ever call the anointing false right
[49:11] right amen true you see it you know it
[49:15] is it is a anointed false ones at the
[49:20] end time amen the anointing is
[49:24] true the seed is false how do we know
[49:28] they're false because they're contrary
[49:30] to the word of God now so now God is
[49:34] Sovereign though so Revival is a
[49:37] sovereign move of God no man
[49:40] manufactured to Zeus the street right no
[49:43] man manufactured you know the the the
[49:46] Divine Healing move come on I was a
[49:50] supernatural Heaven open an angel
[49:53] stepped out of a light From Another
[49:56] Dimension it wasn't prayed down it
[49:59] wasn't called down it wasn't forced down
[50:02] it it was God sovereignly moving and so
[50:07] you know this is this is the thing is a
[50:10] Revival is something Sovereign of God
[50:13] Amen it's not something that can be
[50:15] manufactured or man-made or drummed up
[50:18] or worked up or are are made by man amen
[50:22] now so you know the B just said to
[50:26] brother bradam and there's several
[50:27] incidents of this and this is from
[50:30] trying to do God of service in sort he
[50:32] said you know he said I was talking to
[50:35] my Baptist Brethren brother bradam we
[50:37] can only have Revival when we take the
[50:39] word word by word Page by Page Letter by
[50:42] letter he said I believe it too Page by
[50:45] Page I've been trying it all along he
[50:47] said well we must try to find the the
[50:49] Greek interpretation of the word what
[50:51] the Greek said he said I hadn't read too
[50:53] much but reading the history of the
[50:54] church and the n and counsel and prean
[50:57] counsel and Nan fathers they're arguing
[50:59] back there about about the Greek that
[51:01] was 2,000 years ago one said it means
[51:03] this the other said it means that the
[51:05] word the Greek word means this and he
[51:07] said but all the word is inspired and
[51:10] and he says it won't work it won't work
[51:13] it comes by God revealing himself so he
[51:16] said a revival can never come until God
[51:19] The Sovereign God sends it and then he
[51:22] might take up a little knit with that
[51:24] can't even sign his name and do with it
[51:27] that knows not even good English let
[51:29] along the Greek and so he goes on to say
[51:31] now if there's anybody got Mechanics for
[51:36] Revival is our Noble brother Billy
[51:39] Graham but the mechanics is all right
[51:42] but the mechanics won't move it it takes
[51:45] the Dynamics to move it you can build an
[51:48] automobile put fine seats in it find
[51:51] Pistons prove by science what it can do
[51:54] but unless the DI Dynamics is there she
[51:57] is just a piece of a dead piece of goods
[52:02] so again as as we uh go on in there he
[52:06] said that's what God does he alone has
[52:09] the right to send a Revival not get the
[52:12] mechanics together is pray for God to
[52:15] send the
[52:16] Dynamics but even so many of the message
[52:21] community and and I'm speaking generally
[52:23] here and I'm not pointing anybody out
[52:26] but uh just as a community of you know
[52:30] if we say Christians uh one term of that
[52:33] can mean Catholics methodists Baptists
[52:36] what so we're all Christians we're all
[52:38] lumped into that same lump so when I say
[52:41] message Community we're all a part of
[52:43] the same message no matter whether we're
[52:45] two Soul seven Thunder whatever we
[52:48] whatever label we have you know we're
[52:50] all lumped into one the message
[52:53] community so you know but there's but as
[52:57] we say today even of the message
[53:01] Community there's so much that is void
[53:04] of the
[53:05] Dynamics that all we have is a billy
[53:09] gram type of
[53:12] mechanics even the conversion offered by
[53:15] Billy Graham type of conversion is one
[53:18] of easy
[53:19] believism and and that's that's friend
[53:22] is not a raptured message is it
[53:25] tribulation message it won't give you a
[53:28] ticket in the Rapture it'll get you a
[53:30] ticket to the tribulation you see Billy
[53:32] Graham would have thousands who
[53:35] responded to his pleas to come up and
[53:37] receive Jesus as Lord of your life and
[53:40] confess I'm a sinner and I accept Christ
[53:44] as Savior and he found that most of them
[53:46] didn't
[53:47] stick he could come back you know after
[53:50] 30,000 receive Christ come back a year
[53:52] later can't find 10 who stayed true he
[53:55] blamed it on lazy preachers but brother
[53:58] brandham told him the problem you didn't
[54:01] take them far enough so Billy Graham had
[54:04] the mechanics of Revival but not the
[54:07] Dynamics of it today it's not even come
[54:12] up and accept Jesus since because even
[54:15] altar calls are frowned on so just sit
[54:18] tight in your seat and just accept the
[54:20] message as being true and brother
[54:22] brandham is a prophet and if you believe
[54:24] that you got the Holy Ghost oh my and to
[54:27] call that the new birth Brethren is
[54:31] blasphemy no wonder we got a bunch of
[54:33] rotten eggs in the nest cuz they've
[54:36] never been with the male bird amen amen
[54:41] and hear you himm and there's many on
[54:43] this you can go back and study on it but
[54:45] you know where brother bradam talks
[54:47] about a hen can lay an egg but if she
[54:49] hadn't and she can sit till she's so
[54:51] poor to she can't get off the nest but
[54:53] they'll never hatch if she hadn't been
[54:55] with the male bird they're rotten and he
[54:58] said and that's the just what's the
[55:01] matter today we just took in so many
[55:05] members and so forth and babying them
[55:08] here and babying them there and just got
[55:11] a nest full of rotten eggs it's time to
[55:15] clean the thing out and get the people
[55:17] with the mate Christ Jesus with the word
[55:20] of God back in action and power then we
[55:24] will have have a Revival that has Shake
[55:27] something and do something then you'll
[55:29] see Christ right on the scene on the
[55:31] power he cannot come as long as these
[55:35] things are blocking
[55:38] him what What's blocking
[55:41] him we got too many converts to the
[55:45] message who have never been born again
[55:49] right I said some years ago and I've
[55:52] been around
[55:53] for longer than what I want to
[55:56] say but I said some years ago I mean
[55:59] that we were ripe in this message that
[56:01] there would either be a Revival Among Us
[56:06] that would bring the power of the Holy
[56:08] Ghost in in the midst of people or there
[56:10] would be a great Fallen away and we've
[56:13] seen both yes yes amen now listen now in
[56:20] this moment brother brandham calls it
[56:23] that Satan sins a poisoned Revival
[56:27] that's oh my so be Not Afraid 1960 in
[56:31] chitaka he says you know he's preaching
[56:35] on testimony of the sea you know all
[56:37] them similar sermons he said we have we
[56:40] have gone off on a tantrum of how many
[56:43] big fine buildings we can build how many
[56:46] great how well we can make our
[56:47] denomination grow and we went off
[56:49] without him and the devil's come in with
[56:52] his poison winds to start a Revival
[56:56] amongst the people saying don't you
[56:58] believe that's
[56:59] Supernatural there's no such thing as
[57:01] Divine Healing you better go to
[57:04] psychiatrist and get your mind examined
[57:06] before you become a missionary or a
[57:08] minister and all that kind of nonsense a
[57:10] poisoned Revival that tries to say that
[57:14] the power of God that operates through
[57:16] the church is a bunch of
[57:19] fanaticism
[57:22] wow now as I said every Revival produces
[57:26] twins brother
[57:28] bradam starts and there's a junction lot
[57:33] of a lot of times we we take the seals
[57:35] but you got to go back before that
[57:37] because as he steps into the ministry of
[57:40] Elijah if you do a little study you will
[57:44] find out that brother
[57:47] brandham it was as he studied the church
[57:50] ages yes that he understood the last
[57:53] messenger be Elijah and he places it
[57:56] with Malachi 4 yes so before then the
[58:00] Aral quotes about we need another Elijah
[58:03] and so on like that but it's only until
[58:05] then that he steps into that under a a
[58:10] greater inspiration of that Elijah
[58:13] anointing and so he preaches the church
[58:15] ages because he he's showing us where
[58:18] we've been so we can know where we are
[58:23] yes amen uh is it's kind of like this I
[58:26] years ago I I went on a trip with a
[58:28] friend of mine and we were going down to
[58:31] Florida his father had died and and I
[58:33] was going down there to do a little
[58:35] little um uh memorial service for him
[58:38] and so uh as I got into my vehicle to
[58:42] leave I thought oh I said I I said wait
[58:44] wait I got to go back I I forgot my map
[58:47] you know this Ford GPS and all this
[58:49] stuff we have today don't need them no
[58:51] more people don't know how to read them
[58:53] right but anyway I you know I I said I
[58:56] got to get my map and he said ah you
[58:58] don't need no map brother Tim I know it
[59:00] like the back of my hand I've been I've
[59:01] been through I've been through to
[59:04] Florida so many times I know the way all
[59:06] the I said listen you know the way but I
[59:08] don't know the way and I need them M but
[59:09] you don't need them M but I'm going to
[59:11] go get my map amen so I get you know map
[59:14] out chart out where I'm going so I know
[59:16] where I am what highways what Junctions
[59:18] and so on and I start down the road and
[59:21] about 2: in the morning I get
[59:23] tired and now I'm so weary you know I
[59:26] looked over him I said hey you mind
[59:28] driving an hour oh sure I said okay
[59:31] listen I said there's a junction down
[59:33] the road you don't want to miss oh now I
[59:35] know brother Tim I know this way I've
[59:37] been here I I went down here seeing my
[59:39] folks many many times I said yes sir I
[59:42] said but down here's a junction I said
[59:45] don't want to miss it so I okay so he
[59:49] starts driving I go to sleep in about an
[59:52] hour I wake up and the the vehicle
[59:58] stopped and I wake up and I'm I said
[1:00:01] where where are we at he said I don't
[1:00:03] know the road just
[1:00:05] disappeared I said wait a minute the
[1:00:08] road don't
[1:00:10] disappear you know what are you talking
[1:00:13] about he said well yeah he said I was
[1:00:16] going around here and he
[1:00:18] said the road disappeared he said look
[1:00:21] on that map and tell me where we're at
[1:00:26] I said buddy it don't work that
[1:00:31] way I cannot look on this map and tell
[1:00:34] you where we're at all right I said now
[1:00:37] you got
[1:00:38] lost there's an all night station go in
[1:00:42] there and ask him this question where am
[1:00:46] I yeah and I said when you find out
[1:00:49] where you are I'll find out where we're
[1:00:52] at on the map yes and I can get us on
[1:00:55] the right road to Florida amen now hey
[1:00:58] friends we had the map yes we had the
[1:01:02] Bible That's yes yes amen but we didn't
[1:01:06] know where we were at that's amen so God
[1:01:09] sends a prophet and says here you are
[1:01:13] here's how where you traveled all the
[1:01:16] way down you can go back from Genesis
[1:01:18] all the way down or you can start at
[1:01:20] Pentecost you go all the way down but
[1:01:22] here's all the Junctions along the road
[1:01:24] and we're at Leo deia all right and the
[1:01:27] next Junction of course we know what
[1:01:29] it's going to be it's the resurrection
[1:01:31] and the Rapture in the next the marriage
[1:01:33] supper in the next come on we know where
[1:01:36] to go because we had a prophet amen said
[1:01:40] you are here and we can now look at the
[1:01:43] road map now so here he is in the
[1:01:46] Ephesian Church age I'm emphasizing this
[1:01:49] as he preached in the r r ojc he said
[1:01:52] when a Revival comes there's two classes
[1:01:55] of people comes out of every Revival
[1:01:57] there's a natural man that goes he'll
[1:01:59] come at the altar and say yes sir I
[1:02:01] accept the Lord that Christ is my savior
[1:02:03] he'll go out what does it happen the
[1:02:05] first thing you know he'll wind up in
[1:02:06] some good cold formal church because he
[1:02:09] thinks well if I join church I'm just as
[1:02:11] good as an
[1:02:12] next-man I'm am I not just as good as so
[1:02:15] and so what difference does it make as
[1:02:17] long as I belong to church make my
[1:02:19] confession wh why it's a whole lot of
[1:02:21] difference you've got to be born again
[1:02:23] You' got to had the birthright Jacob
[1:02:25] didn't care how much he was laughed at
[1:02:28] he wanted that Birthright he didn't care
[1:02:30] how he had to get it a lot of people
[1:02:32] don't want that to get the birth right
[1:02:34] because they think it's just a little
[1:02:36] unpopular they don't want to get down at
[1:02:38] the altar and cry a little bit and go
[1:02:40] without a few meals and do and something
[1:02:43] another they don't want to do it a lot
[1:02:44] of women a lot of you make up on that
[1:02:47] they think it they cry they might wash
[1:02:48] it off and have to put it on again I
[1:02:51] don't mean to say that sacriligious hope
[1:02:53] it don't sound that that way but it's
[1:02:55] the truth they just don't want it they
[1:02:57] don't want the new birth because the new
[1:03:00] birth is kind of
[1:03:02] messy now wait a minute brother Brandon
[1:03:04] brings this concept all the way down
[1:03:06] through 65 past the seals and he says
[1:03:10] the new birth is kind of messy it's like
[1:03:13] any other birth any birth is a mess I
[1:03:15] don't care where it's at if it's in a
[1:03:17] pig pin or in a barn if it's in a pink
[1:03:20] decorated hospital room it's a mess so
[1:03:23] that the new birth is a mess and amen
[1:03:25] it'll make you do things you didn't
[1:03:27] think you would do stand on a corner
[1:03:29] beat a tambourine sing glory to be to
[1:03:32] God hallelujah praise God glory to God
[1:03:35] while you'll act like a
[1:03:37] maniac amen that's what it done to the
[1:03:39] apostles that's what had done to the
[1:03:41] Virgin Mary she act like she was drunk
[1:03:43] she was a mess in society but it takes a
[1:03:46] mess for life to come out of Amen but
[1:03:49] the other you know the other I'm a fine
[1:03:52] fellow I pay my t eyes I do this and but
[1:03:57] he said you got to die and R there to
[1:04:00] your thoughts and let the Holy Ghost
[1:04:02] come and take you over and just do
[1:04:04] whatever he wants to you and he said get
[1:04:06] kind of messy with it that sounds
[1:04:09] horrible not sacriligious but the truth
[1:04:11] that's the only way I know to punch it
[1:04:14] out make you understand what's more of a
[1:04:16] mess than a dignified bunch of Jews that
[1:04:19] day than to see these people come out
[1:04:21] there with Stam lips you know what Stam
[1:04:24] is brother bradam demonstrates what a
[1:04:26] stammer is other tongues acting like
[1:04:28] drunk people and demonstrates how drunk
[1:04:31] person acts that's exactly what they'
[1:04:33] done they look messy and and he said but
[1:04:36] these are are these men full of new wine
[1:04:39] but after what after one kind of got to
[1:04:42] himself he said let it not be known to
[1:04:44] you hearken to my word these are not
[1:04:46] drunk like you suppose but he went back
[1:04:49] to the scripture this is that that was
[1:04:51] spoke of the Prophet by the prophet Joel
[1:04:53] It's come to pass in the last day said
[1:04:56] God I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[1:04:58] Flesh that's the way the church was born
[1:05:02] first how many believes God is infinite
[1:05:05] then he cannot change and if that's his
[1:05:08] kind of idea of a church at the
[1:05:10] beginning that's the kind of church
[1:05:11] he'll have at the end he cannot change
[1:05:15] so how are you going to substitute
[1:05:17] shaking a hand or sprinkling or some
[1:05:19] other thing that didn't happen back
[1:05:21] there each one of the Apostles went
[1:05:24] right back to it amen now so he so you
[1:05:29] know he he goes on in there but he you
[1:05:31] know speaking about that there's there's
[1:05:33] a a lot more that we could read and I'm
[1:05:35] skipping it to save some time all right
[1:05:38] now so just looking at this for a moment
[1:05:41] he says in the message uncertain sound
[1:05:44] this is in Spokane in 62 that's the
[1:05:47] reason we're losing it we're taking our
[1:05:49] boys and teaching them education and and
[1:05:51] friends if we're not careful
[1:05:54] on we will turn this message into
[1:05:57] seminars teaching
[1:06:00] seminars we will educate
[1:06:03] people into doing right yes yes that's
[1:06:07] the truth brother instead of a change of
[1:06:12] nature that's right we will teach them
[1:06:15] how to live right and do right and we'll
[1:06:18] have classes and and and seminars on how
[1:06:21] to have marriages good marriages and
[1:06:23] we'll do this and we'll do that friends
[1:06:25] that ain't it right it's a new birth
[1:06:29] people are needing amen we'll try
[1:06:32] psychology and you know set them down
[1:06:36] and learn how to conform your nature
[1:06:38] listen it's not confirmation is
[1:06:40] transformation amen Amen brother amen
[1:06:44] now so you see there there again you
[1:06:48] know we it goes right on now remember
[1:06:52] remember here that needs to be a house
[1:06:55] cleaning I'm just going to tell you
[1:06:58] needs to be a house cleaning from the
[1:06:59] pulpit to the back pew and I'm not going
[1:07:01] to do it it'll take the Holy Ghost amen
[1:07:03] I'm not even going to pretend I'm able
[1:07:05] to do it you know already I just want to
[1:07:07] say already and you Brothers know it I
[1:07:11] know this is public may go on the
[1:07:12] internet may be everywhere but already
[1:07:15] we've had homosexuals in our pulpits yes
[1:07:19] yes we have had adulterers in our Pulpit
[1:07:23] we have had leaning leading ministers
[1:07:26] who turn and deny the message yes why
[1:07:31] because even in the ministry we have
[1:07:35] those who have not the Seal of God Amen
[1:07:38] brother amen and I don't care how gifted
[1:07:41] you are and how talented you are you
[1:07:45] must be born again amen that is the
[1:07:48] first thing brother brandom emphasized
[1:07:50] that over and over he said don't you go
[1:07:52] out and preach or do do nothing Jesus
[1:07:54] said don't go out and preach or do
[1:07:56] nothing you meet in the city of
[1:07:57] Jerusalem till you're empowered yes yes
[1:08:01] amen with indued with power from on
[1:08:05] high amen but you know many have run off
[1:08:08] without the Holy Ghost you can see the
[1:08:10] evidence in their lives right and
[1:08:12] because of that you see the evidence in
[1:08:15] the church yes yes spirit filled it
[1:08:18] takes Spirit-filled men to give birth to
[1:08:21] Spirit-filled children that's TR amen
[1:08:25] that's the truth amen now okay so we we
[1:08:30] have those even today without the Seal
[1:08:33] of God is
[1:08:34] proven now it brings you brother bradam
[1:08:38] said and spoken words Original Seed he
[1:08:40] said now this brings you right back to
[1:08:42] the spoken word then where we are God's
[1:08:45] word made manifest Jesus said the same
[1:08:48] thing he he that believeth on me the the
[1:08:51] and the things and who I am and what I
[1:08:53] came for the purpose I do to bring a man
[1:08:56] to bring a man back to believe the word
[1:08:58] of God and take nothing else with it the
[1:09:01] works that I do he'll do also there you
[1:09:03] are why is it not being done
[1:09:07] today it's hybrid bastard children mixed
[1:09:12] up it don't it's IMM it don't know what
[1:09:15] it
[1:09:18] believes amen and what is the Holy Ghost
[1:09:21] given for the works that I do say you do
[1:09:24] also not another work but God wants to
[1:09:26] bring the Holy Ghost in you to continue
[1:09:30] right the same work that he was doing in
[1:09:34] Christ brother what what in the world
[1:09:36] you expect of of this move and what do
[1:09:40] you expect we ought to be like well let
[1:09:42] me just quote from the prophet let's see
[1:09:44] what he expected this is you know from
[1:09:46] God of this evil age might help you you
[1:09:49] know I I read a book on Killing
[1:09:52] Lincoln
[1:09:54] and let's see somebody might know
[1:09:58] Riley oh Bill O'Reilly he he he's the
[1:10:01] one that was the author of it and I I
[1:10:03] read a book on you know today the man
[1:10:06] who had so many days to live he do such
[1:10:09] and such and he goes through some yeah
[1:10:11] it's a nice book on history but
[1:10:15] anyway I read I read that book on
[1:10:17] killing L and I I it made me think well
[1:10:20] God what were you trying to impart to us
[1:10:22] the last few days
[1:10:24] the few hours of brother Brandon's
[1:10:26] Ministry yes I mean you had a message
[1:10:29] this was listen this is not brother
[1:10:31] Brandon's message that's right this was
[1:10:33] a message of Jesus Christ to the leoan
[1:10:36] age and brother Brandon was the
[1:10:38] messenger yes that's right right amen so
[1:10:42] God was imparting some things to us and
[1:10:44] here's one of the last
[1:10:46] sermons he preaches I'll tell you
[1:10:48] another study is ashamed of him yes are
[1:10:52] you ashamed of your Pentecost experience
[1:10:54] Are you ashamed of speaking in Tong are
[1:10:56] you saying
[1:10:57] yes I believe the Full Gospel right
[1:11:00] that's being ashamed of him that's
[1:11:03] things God was trying to impart to us
[1:11:06] last words yes watch now God of this
[1:11:10] evil age this is August 65 so you see he
[1:11:12] only had a few months to live one of the
[1:11:15] last sermons to his church he said and
[1:11:17] she's caused the whole world to accept
[1:11:19] the scientific leadership of the
[1:11:21] educational program that Satan has given
[1:11:24] to her under the name of a church the
[1:11:27] leadership of an educational scientific
[1:11:29] program I'm picturing to you the God of
[1:11:31] this world and when she as Eve had the
[1:11:34] very filling of God's word in her hand
[1:11:37] she could have took God's word but what
[1:11:40] did she do to that instead of taring for
[1:11:43] the baptism of the Holy Ghost left
[1:11:47] science prove to her that the Holy Ghost
[1:11:49] was only for the disciples all and
[1:11:53] instead of keeping Divine Healing
[1:11:56] going when she ought to be raising now
[1:12:00] raising the dead and doing great
[1:12:02] Miracles she has L Satan under his
[1:12:06] religious under his leadership of
[1:12:08] religious men take the word of God and
[1:12:10] try to say it was for another age and
[1:12:13] she's believed
[1:12:15] it when the Bible said the things that I
[1:12:18] do shall you do also good Jesus said go
[1:12:21] you into all the world and preach the
[1:12:22] gospel to every creature we we're still
[1:12:25] creatures these signs shall follow
[1:12:27] everyone that believe amen she denies
[1:12:30] every bit of it she denies all the
[1:12:33] supernatural she swapped it for his
[1:12:36] intellectual conception of the
[1:12:38] Bible now I'm going to read you a phrase
[1:12:41] right here where priest holy
[1:12:44] fathers so-called Bishops Archbishop
[1:12:47] District presor G
[1:12:50] overseers now I'm going to leave all
[1:12:52] that out and read it again
[1:12:54] where
[1:12:56] where they have put their own
[1:12:58] interpretation to
[1:13:00] it and God has left them dead as
[1:13:07] 12:00 the only thing we have left in the
[1:13:10] last days is a bunch of little
[1:13:12] Pentecostals with a bunch of music
[1:13:15] whooped up as hard as they can running
[1:13:17] up and down the floor speaking in
[1:13:19] tongues and shouting having a form of
[1:13:21] godliness but denying the word thereof
[1:13:23] tell them to be baptized in the name of
[1:13:25] Jesus Christ they'll laugh in your face
[1:13:27] but what that but God goes right on
[1:13:30] making it just so just the same proven
[1:13:33] his word to be
[1:13:36] so so two groups one with knowledge of
[1:13:41] the word and no Spirit and the other all
[1:13:45] spirit and no word you see but it's got
[1:13:49] to be spirit and truth yes now I'm a
[1:13:52] farm boy you want to keep a chicken in a
[1:13:55] pen you clip One Wing that's right don't
[1:13:58] clip them both he'll have balance he can
[1:14:00] still fly right clip One Wing he'll just
[1:14:03] fly around in circles right are you with
[1:14:06] me amen he can never get off the ground
[1:14:09] amen now God gave us the the gospel it
[1:14:13] comes in spirit and in truth yes it
[1:14:17] takes two wings to fly you can't just
[1:14:19] have truth without Spirit or Spirit
[1:14:22] without truth you got to have both of
[1:14:24] them or you'll never get off the ground
[1:14:26] amen now so you see there's two groups
[1:14:30] one all knowledge of the word no Spirit
[1:14:32] other all Spirit you know one of them
[1:14:35] fundamental positionally they know by
[1:14:37] the mechanics that they are Sons and
[1:14:39] Daughters of God brother Brandon said
[1:14:41] Pentecostals got all the faith but don't
[1:14:43] know who they are he said if I could
[1:14:45] just get the two together yes I believe
[1:14:48] the message brings the two together amen
[1:14:50] amen the fundamental and and those who
[1:14:52] have the spirit Faith were in the word
[1:14:55] together that was the what the message
[1:14:57] was to do bring them together amen and
[1:14:59] so he goes on he said there's where
[1:15:02] Satan got in to make it all mechanics
[1:15:06] and no
[1:15:08] Dynamics back all Dynamics and no
[1:15:11] mechanics but see we got to put it
[1:15:14] together we got to have the power of the
[1:15:16] Holy Spirit but we got to come back with
[1:15:19] the word to feed this machine it won't
[1:15:22] feed on a Creed it chokes up the flu and
[1:15:24] he goes on he said now not just he said
[1:15:28] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:15:30] every word not just part of it every
[1:15:33] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:15:36] God yes it takes both of them two wings
[1:15:40] of our and every
[1:15:42] word well brother Tim we believe the
[1:15:45] Mysteries all right well do you believe
[1:15:47] the supernatural you believe the gifts
[1:15:49] of the Spirit you believe in speaking in
[1:15:50] tongues you believe do you believe in
[1:15:52] shouting well no we we've left that well
[1:15:55] you see you're only got one Wing that's
[1:15:58] right that's right you'll never get off
[1:16:00] the ground amen now every word you can't
[1:16:04] leave Holiness out that's right you
[1:16:07] can't leave mystery truths out amen you
[1:16:10] cannot deny any of it gifts of the
[1:16:13] Spirit the token which is the true
[1:16:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost something
[1:16:17] beyond the anointing of the of the human
[1:16:20] Spirit but abides within the soul that
[1:16:23] seals you to the day of redemption yes
[1:16:26] amen so you see brother brandom tells us
[1:16:29] in God's provided place of worship in
[1:16:31] Los Angeles he said when this great
[1:16:33] moving power of God comes into a Son of
[1:16:36] God it quickens him the spirit of Life
[1:16:39] enters into him then what did it do it
[1:16:42] seeks him in Heavenly places not there
[1:16:44] will be we are now now we are already
[1:16:47] resurrected the Dynamics and mechanics
[1:16:50] going to work quickened us and we're
[1:16:52] quick up into the presence of God where
[1:16:55] his spirit is now we are seated together
[1:16:58] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:17:00] sitting in there that great seat that's
[1:17:02] already fired up been raised from the
[1:17:05] dead we're part of it if you're part of
[1:17:07] the Bride you are because the Bride is a
[1:17:08] part of the groom you know and we find
[1:17:10] out it's the same thing she'll do
[1:17:12] exactly what's predicted for her to do
[1:17:14] in this day she won't be a Leo toan by
[1:17:19] no means a lukewarm she'll be on fire
[1:17:22] for God she'll be moving on in the
[1:17:25] spirit of
[1:17:31] God brother brandham talked about
[1:17:34] him he talked about movements past this
[1:17:37] is how can I
[1:17:39] overcome this is
[1:17:41] 1963 in August
[1:17:43] 25 and he
[1:17:45] says we got a movement some of the
[1:17:48] Holiness
[1:17:50] groups they can't call the Holy Ghost
[1:17:53] Holy Ghost cuz they don't they they
[1:17:57] identify themselves with Pentecostals
[1:18:00] when they do that they say holy
[1:18:02] spirit to keep from saying Holy Ghost
[1:18:05] because the Pentecostal common people
[1:18:08] just call it what the Bible says holy
[1:18:10] ghost which Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost
[1:18:12] is the same thing but they're very
[1:18:14] careful about it watch they don't want
[1:18:18] to be
[1:18:19] identified with them tongu speaking
[1:18:21] people and that that's the Holy Spirit
[1:18:27] itself then he went right on and he said
[1:18:30] you see what they have done he said the
[1:18:33] unclean Spirit has gone out of a man and
[1:18:36] has walked in dry places and that house
[1:18:38] was in filled with the Holy Ghost and he
[1:18:40] comes back and they're worse
[1:18:43] right and there's a lot in the message
[1:18:46] Community would have been better off to
[1:18:47] stay in
[1:18:51] denomination look at the last SL to see
[1:18:53] an age see how it closes
[1:18:56] out you study
[1:18:59] again you know it it you know you see
[1:19:03] how you see how it closes out with some
[1:19:06] of the church failing to overcome and
[1:19:08] actually becoming lukewarm and Powerless
[1:19:11] and Jesus being refused entrance into
[1:19:13] his own church now listen folks you can
[1:19:17] go back and look at the Pentecostal and
[1:19:18] say oh that was them no it advances
[1:19:21] forward yes yes and right now in message
[1:19:26] circles Jesus Christ the holy spirit is
[1:19:30] being refused entrance yes yes into his
[1:19:34] own church that's the
[1:19:43] truth give you a
[1:19:45] quote door to the heart door of the
[1:19:48] heart 571
[1:19:50] 1212 God
[1:19:53] does not like his church to be
[1:19:55] lukewarm he said either be cold or hot
[1:19:59] and because you're lukewarm I'll spew
[1:20:00] thee from my mouth that certainly fits
[1:20:03] the situation the day of the modern
[1:20:05] church and the Pentecostal church today
[1:20:07] just a lukewarm condition neither cold
[1:20:10] nor hot it would be better if we would
[1:20:13] either be back in their old
[1:20:15] denominational State status or either be
[1:20:18] up in the Realms of the blessing of God
[1:20:20] than to sit in a lukewarm condition
[1:20:23] as we are in now the Lord would
[1:20:25] appreciate us much more if we would do
[1:20:31] it spiritual Amnesia brother brandham
[1:20:34] talks about it you know the experience
[1:20:36] worldwide he said that kills me as an
[1:20:38] evangelist no fire burning no enthusiasm
[1:20:41] There's No Going to it as evangelist it
[1:20:43] just kills me and he says you're
[1:20:45] lukewarm now let me just get there I
[1:20:48] want to just go into a couple of Revival
[1:20:51] killers
[1:20:53] Revival
[1:20:55] Killers
[1:20:57] now one of the one of the great Revival
[1:21:00] Killers reason there are no Revival
[1:21:03] is because we
[1:21:06] are
[1:21:08] predestinated
[1:21:10] secure and the rest can just go to hell
[1:21:13] if they want
[1:21:14] to
[1:21:16] good in the fifth seal brother brandham
[1:21:18] told us about John Wesley and z zingle
[1:21:21] and Calvin how they got the church to
[1:21:24] security till they didn't want no more
[1:21:28] revivals whatever is going to be is
[1:21:30] going to be that was all of
[1:21:32] it and they just lived any kind of
[1:21:35] lives we're the bride we're predestinate
[1:21:39] we're the elect We're The Chosen we've
[1:21:42] received the word we've accepted the
[1:21:43] knowledge of the Mysteries and we call
[1:21:46] that the evidence of the Holy
[1:21:49] Ghost you know again this is a Revival
[1:21:53] killer that we and yes we got to tell
[1:21:57] people you're chosen from the foundation
[1:21:58] of the world and and you you you were in
[1:22:01] God you understand that's our position
[1:22:03] in Christ and we're positioned there not
[1:22:07] by our knowledge of the message amen we
[1:22:09] are positioned there by the baptism of
[1:22:12] the Holy Ghost that made us sit in
[1:22:15] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and
[1:22:17] gives us a position in the heavenlies
[1:22:21] amen now so you said so so again we we
[1:22:25] have received the word we've accepted
[1:22:27] the knowledge of the Mysteries and many
[1:22:30] of us call that the evidence of the Holy
[1:22:32] Ghost our evidence is we believe the
[1:22:34] word brother we've emphasized this part
[1:22:38] 1 Corinthians 13:1 though I speak with
[1:22:41] tongues of men and angels and have not
[1:22:43] charity I become a sounding brass and
[1:22:46] tinkling symbols we have taken
[1:22:49] this we have minimized speaking in tongu
[1:22:53] until 98% of our people have never had
[1:22:56] the supernatural experience of speaking
[1:22:59] in tongues the least of the gifts much
[1:23:02] less any of the greater gifts very
[1:23:07] true and though I have the gift of
[1:23:10] Prophecy we have preached against gifts
[1:23:13] until there are no
[1:23:16] gifts yeah we claim to have the full
[1:23:18] word now and
[1:23:21] yet part of it is now declared
[1:23:24] unwanted or
[1:23:26] unneeded we now claim they're on the
[1:23:30] Shelf there's no quote for that by the
[1:23:32] way Amen brother Bram said I believe I I
[1:23:37] desire one day that there would be the
[1:23:40] gifts as it were laid on the mantle
[1:23:42] right he didn't say on the Shelf said on
[1:23:45] the mantle but he is not talking
[1:23:49] about this time he's talking when we
[1:23:52] enter into eternity when perfect love he
[1:23:55] said will be and he said there won't be
[1:23:57] any laying hands on the sick Dan and
[1:23:59] there won't be any need to preach it'll
[1:24:01] all be over that's when all the gifts
[1:24:04] will be laid on the mantle right now For
[1:24:07] Heaven's Sake we need all of Heaven amen
[1:24:10] amen we're going to e everything the
[1:24:12] word says you can't just have part of it
[1:24:15] amen
[1:24:17] amen but we've claimed that they're now
[1:24:20] on the shelf and tongues are just baby
[1:24:23] talk the only ones who even want the
[1:24:25] gifts are babies well that's not the
[1:24:28] teaching of the Apostle Paul right he
[1:24:30] said follow after charity and but and
[1:24:33] desire spiritual gifts but rather that
[1:24:34] you may prophesy
[1:24:37] right and
[1:24:39] understand now what what what just just
[1:24:43] wait for a minute let me let me just say
[1:24:45] something
[1:24:46] here we've come down to where every gift
[1:24:51] is denied till now within the message
[1:24:55] Community the last gifts of the
[1:24:58] five-fold
[1:24:59] ministry which were sent from heaven yes
[1:25:03] are now being denied oh yeah and
[1:25:07] unwanted and castigated and set
[1:25:12] aside and told you have nothing to
[1:25:20] say Amen he just kept on going yes till
[1:25:24] it got your gift
[1:25:30] brother so so again Paul would
[1:25:35] say I would you all to speak with
[1:25:41] tongues if I had my desire for you I I
[1:25:44] wish should' all have this Supernatural
[1:25:46] experience right it's the least of the
[1:25:48] gifts but it's still Supernatural that's
[1:25:51] right that's right oh yeah we know it's
[1:25:53] impersonated and manufactured but
[1:25:55] brother bam tells us in standing the Gap
[1:25:57] that no matter how bad it's been
[1:25:59] impersonated there is still a real
[1:26:01] genuine one that's always to be in the
[1:26:04] church amen standing in the Gap so but
[1:26:09] but you know how come we never take it
[1:26:11] this further you know you know well you
[1:26:13] know though we have tongues of men and
[1:26:15] angels and you know though I would
[1:26:17] prophesy and have faith I can move
[1:26:19] mountains and I without charity I'm
[1:26:21] another but what about this other part
[1:26:23] and understand all
[1:26:26] Mysteries and all knowledge uhhuh yes
[1:26:32] yes so if we're going to do away with
[1:26:35] tongues
[1:26:37] prophecy Moving
[1:26:39] Mountains faith we got to do away with
[1:26:44] understanding all Mysteries and all know
[1:26:47] a true in fact of the matter the Church
[1:26:50] of Christ spirit that brother brandham
[1:26:51] went out to defeat when he said I took a
[1:26:55] little slingshot of Faith this little
[1:26:57] gift and I went out to meet the Goliath
[1:26:59] that said the days of Miracles are
[1:27:00] passed and there's no such thing as
[1:27:02] Divine Healing that thing has moved
[1:27:04] right into our message where we
[1:27:08] minimize the
[1:27:12] Supernatural and the Church of Church of
[1:27:15] Christ Doctrine is being preached from
[1:27:18] message
[1:27:20] pulpits good
[1:27:25] so here's another Revival
[1:27:28] killer I only got time for a little few
[1:27:31] of these another Revival killer in every
[1:27:35] age spurning Church
[1:27:37] age we have exactly the same pattern
[1:27:40] that's why the light comes to some
[1:27:42] god-given messenger in a certain area
[1:27:44] and then from that messenger there
[1:27:46] spreads the light through the ministry
[1:27:48] of others who have been Faithfully
[1:27:50] taught but of course all those who go
[1:27:52] out don't always learn how necessary it
[1:27:55] is to speak only what the messenger has
[1:27:57] spoken remember Paul warned the people
[1:27:59] to say only what he said 1 Corinthians
[1:28:01] 14:37 if a man think himself to be a
[1:28:04] prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge
[1:28:06] that the things I write unto you are the
[1:28:08] Commandments of the Lord what came the
[1:28:10] word of God out of you out from you or
[1:28:12] came it to you only they adhere or take
[1:28:16] away there and soon the message is no
[1:28:20] longer pure and the bival dies down how
[1:28:25] careful we must be to hear one voice for
[1:28:28] the spirit has one voice which is the
[1:28:31] voice of God Amen now so again he said
[1:28:37] Paul could not change what he wrote he
[1:28:39] said Peter couldn't change what he wrote
[1:28:42] amen what he was inspired to say neither
[1:28:44] can we and he said every fresh and true
[1:28:47] Revival will be because men have gotten
[1:28:50] back to the word for their age The Cry
[1:28:54] of every age is rebuke you have left the
[1:28:56] word of God repent and come back to the
[1:28:59] word from the first book in the Bible
[1:29:01] Genesis to the last book in Revelation
[1:29:03] there's only one reason for God's
[1:29:05] displeasure leaving the word and there's
[1:29:08] only one remedy to regain his favor back
[1:29:11] to the
[1:29:13] word amen so we must be believ by every
[1:29:17] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:29:19] God but you know now we have f trained
[1:29:22] me ministers in our midst you know we
[1:29:25] we've uh find training of ministers
[1:29:28] we've educated them in the message and
[1:29:30] it's taking the place of and I'm quoting
[1:29:34] all night prayer meetings in the old
[1:29:36] time way we used to get to God instead
[1:29:38] of having preachers we got lecturers men
[1:29:41] who know the word just as well just sit
[1:29:43] it to put it there and put it together
[1:29:45] in such a way it's astounding how they
[1:29:47] can do it they know the mechanics but
[1:29:50] that ain't the Dynamics we want the
[1:29:53] Dynamics I don't care about the
[1:29:55] mechanics I want to know the Dynamics
[1:29:57] what does it do
[1:30:00] yes amen amen now so again brother
[1:30:07] brandom told us you know what it would
[1:30:09] be and it is rising in the sun example
[1:30:12] of two
[1:30:13] cars one of them got all the bells and
[1:30:16] whistles God the leather seats and is
[1:30:18] polished and everything else and it's
[1:30:21] just beautiful but there's no fire in
[1:30:23] the
[1:30:24] engine and the other one has fire in the
[1:30:28] engine it goes somewhere when brother
[1:30:31] Brenham left us he left us a car that
[1:30:34] ran amen it would drive down the road to
[1:30:37] Divine Healing it would drive to the
[1:30:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost it would drive
[1:30:43] right down to the real power of God to
[1:30:45] Holy life to Godly men and godly women
[1:30:48] yes amen amen amen it it worked yes it
[1:30:52] was a gospel it was a card that would go
[1:30:55] somewhere I don't know who's been fiddle
[1:30:58] fatling with the mechanics and messing
[1:31:01] it all around but I tell you many we got
[1:31:04] many sitting in a church parking lot
[1:31:07] that won't go not even an inch it won't
[1:31:10] even hey the battery is so run down it
[1:31:13] won't even crank
[1:31:15] anymore right and some of that's all
[1:31:18] they can do is just grind around on the
[1:31:20] engine just make a little noise like
[1:31:23] brother Brandon said he saw this fine
[1:31:25] train and he described it was had a
[1:31:26] zephyr engine and I don't know what all
[1:31:28] you know he was quite enthralled with
[1:31:30] and I looked at this old train and I
[1:31:32] said when's it going to move he said can
[1:31:34] it move he said no sir I'd like to take
[1:31:36] a little ride no sir it can't move why
[1:31:38] he said there's no fire in the engine
[1:31:41] that's what's the matter with the church
[1:31:42] today it's all pushed up and decorated
[1:31:44] with no fire in the engine you can only
[1:31:46] move by fire and what we need today is
[1:31:49] some more Holy Ghost and Fire yes
[1:31:52] and that's what's happened to so many
[1:31:53] they they they've accepted the tradition
[1:31:58] of easy believism the message of Billy
[1:32:01] Graham instead of the message to Abraham
[1:32:05] and that message of Graham of easy
[1:32:08] believism I just accept the message and
[1:32:10] say it's right and I believe God sent a
[1:32:13] prophet and you got the Holy Ghost
[1:32:14] that'll send you to the tribulation just
[1:32:17] the same as it will the Baptist that's
[1:32:19] all to do for you today he said and
[1:32:22] Fallen the world is again falling apart
[1:32:24] in fre Port we've studied the mechanics
[1:32:26] until it's all mechanical I'll tell you
[1:32:29] what we've had 60 years just about since
[1:32:31] brother brandham left of studying the
[1:32:33] mechanics we've had them fiddle fadle
[1:32:36] with it and whatever else you know we
[1:32:38] you we got it you know we can put up our
[1:32:40] charts and we can and all those things
[1:32:43] you know I'm I'm not down in none of
[1:32:45] them they have their
[1:32:47] place amen but that don't bring the
[1:32:50] power of God
[1:32:52] where is the power of God that used to
[1:32:54] be in the church I'm quoting brother
[1:32:55] Bram where is the Pentecostal blessing
[1:32:57] that used to flow through the churches
[1:32:59] you mean a Pentecostal blessing is to
[1:33:01] flow through our churches you mean that
[1:33:03] come on brother Tim what do you think we
[1:33:06] are a bunch of Pentecostals well that's
[1:33:08] what I
[1:33:11] am that's what Paul was that's what
[1:33:14] Peter was that's what James and John was
[1:33:18] come on that's what Jesus was Pentecost
[1:33:21] was just receiving the same Holy Spirit
[1:33:23] the spirit of Jesus that came on the day
[1:33:25] of
[1:33:28] Pentecost you know today I just submit
[1:33:31] to you today is the day when the day of
[1:33:33] Pentecost fully
[1:33:35] comes yeah amen but we have great
[1:33:38] intellectual teachers and where does it
[1:33:40] take us like I said we've had 60 years
[1:33:44] of Kingdom Builders and made personality
[1:33:47] Cults yes since the prophet left us yes
[1:33:51] now we don't have 19,000 denominations
[1:33:53] from it yet but we're working on it oh
[1:33:57] yes amen look look at look at the
[1:34:01] Folly a powerless group of people whose
[1:34:04] only weapon is argument right amen
[1:34:07] Church age Book quote there's no Revival
[1:34:11] possible unless Jesus is welcome back in
[1:34:15] the midst again and the ministry and the
[1:34:18] people quit putting him out of the
[1:34:21] church
[1:34:22] like a bunch of leans
[1:34:25] do now I'm going to challenge you go
[1:34:29] study the leoan church age how many beli
[1:34:31] brother bradam was a messenger how many
[1:34:34] believes that was the age our age leoa
[1:34:37] seventh angel seventh message seventh
[1:34:39] Messenger right all right so go listen
[1:34:42] to his message that's he preaches his
[1:34:46] message to Leo deia and in that brother
[1:34:50] brandham tells us
[1:34:52] he preaches he preaches several thoughts
[1:34:54] he brings in Jesus with dirty feet the
[1:34:57] unwelcomed
[1:34:58] Christ yes that he preaches all over the
[1:35:01] place that was not just a story he was
[1:35:03] telling the condition of the age that
[1:35:06] Jesus had come and he was unwelcomed and
[1:35:09] unwanted because of Pride that's right
[1:35:12] first sermon he preaches on it is pride
[1:35:16] and then he preaches Jesus with dirty
[1:35:18] feet Jesus keeps all his appointments
[1:35:19] all these others so
[1:35:21] he but he talks about Israel and he said
[1:35:24] what caused the Jewish Branch to be cut
[1:35:28] off you know we're according to Romans n
[1:35:30] we are the the Olive Branch the wild
[1:35:32] branch that was grafted in and because
[1:35:35] the the true Branch or the original
[1:35:37] Branch was cut off yeah and so so he
[1:35:40] said what caused Israel to be cut off
[1:35:43] the original tree because they rejected
[1:35:47] Paul's Pentecostal
[1:35:49] message and do you believe this is the
[1:35:51] last Church age the Bible said so and
[1:35:53] what did say going to happen to them
[1:35:55] they're going to be cut off because of
[1:35:59] rejecting the Pentecostal message then
[1:36:02] God will turn to the
[1:36:08] Jews
[1:36:10] now then there's the other side all
[1:36:12] screaming hollering calling at the
[1:36:14] bride's Revival which which is in in
[1:36:17] effect nothing more than a bunch of
[1:36:19] man-made emotional workup right and
[1:36:22] that's where Satan gets in he gets in
[1:36:24] make it all mechanics and no Dynamics or
[1:36:26] all all Dynamics and no mechanics got to
[1:36:29] have them both together yes sir the word
[1:36:32] the word of God is is not Creeds of some
[1:36:37] personality cult it's not some man's
[1:36:40] Thunder a bunch of Noise with no
[1:36:42] lightning but it's the power of God on
[1:36:43] displine we've had years now teachers
[1:36:46] that claim to be the Aaron to Moses who
[1:36:49] was needed to say brother help brother
[1:36:51] Brandon say what he couldn't say oh my
[1:36:55] you know we we've U we've had
[1:36:57] self-proclaimed apostles who thought
[1:36:59] they were needed to bring Clarity to the
[1:37:02] message again this was thought you know
[1:37:06] brother Brandon needed help to say what
[1:37:10] he couldn't
[1:37:11] say they too have their own
[1:37:15] books
[1:37:16] because what they say can't be found in
[1:37:19] the message had to make their own we've
[1:37:23] had eighth Messengers oh yes oh yes you
[1:37:26] know we we we have wannabe
[1:37:29] prophets that that that have risen
[1:37:31] they've invaded the pull Pit Brother
[1:37:33] Brandon said without a call from God
[1:37:35] they've styled themselves like Fishers
[1:37:37] of Men the founders of a move of God
[1:37:39] they say the gifted five the gifted
[1:37:41] Ministry of Ephesians 4 that God gave
[1:37:44] the churches failed so they two are
[1:37:46] taken over and so here we are right in
[1:37:49] the midst of the Fulfillment of Prophecy
[1:37:51] called the gainsaying of cor they don't
[1:37:53] even know they fulfilled it so they add
[1:37:56] here and they take away there and soon
[1:37:58] the message is no longer pure the
[1:38:00] Revival dies down how careful we must be
[1:38:04] to hear one voice for the spirit has but
[1:38:08] one voice which is the voice of
[1:38:11] God Amen now so as we we we got to get
[1:38:16] back to the blood back to the real power
[1:38:18] of the Holy Ghost under the token there
[1:38:21] there is hope for Revival because God is
[1:38:24] hearing the cries the S because of the
[1:38:28] bondage he hears the cries of our young
[1:38:31] people with suicide Spirits delving down
[1:38:35] in porn perversions of all kinds sex
[1:38:39] sins un unimaginable are you with me
[1:38:42] amen you know he hears those cries but
[1:38:45] as brother Brandon said in the voice of
[1:38:47] the sign he is only waiting for his
[1:38:50] people to call call him on the
[1:38:52] scene he's there he's available but he's
[1:38:56] waiting on you to call for him and there
[1:38:58] is a remedy you don't have to go out to
[1:39:01] these psychologist and whatever to get
[1:39:03] the remedy the remedy is in the baptism
[1:39:07] of the Holy Ghost I tell you what the
[1:39:09] Holy Ghost will fix 99% of marriage
[1:39:12] problems in your church it it'll fix the
[1:39:16] behavioral CH problem in your children
[1:39:19] it'll I I'm telling you the Holy Ghost
[1:39:22] will I mean you may need 1% of
[1:39:24] instruction and a little guidance here
[1:39:26] and there but the rest say you just give
[1:39:28] them the Holy Ghost they'll take what
[1:39:30] the word of God said and they'll light
[1:39:32] up to it yes yes yes it'll take away
[1:39:36] with your hours and hours of counseling
[1:39:39] the counsel they need is Get Down The
[1:39:40] Altar and repent amen sir
[1:39:48] Amen brother bradam said and Indi he
[1:39:51] said they call for Revival everywhere
[1:39:53] how you going to have Revival when the
[1:39:54] word itself can't work through the
[1:39:55] people oh my I'm running out of time so
[1:39:59] we we go right on brother brandom said
[1:40:01] you know when we see what God has done
[1:40:03] in this generation what it ought to do
[1:40:05] for us this is this is why Christ speak
[1:40:08] we need a repentance we need a Revival
[1:40:11] I'm saying it myself I need a shaking I
[1:40:14] need something I speaking to myself this
[1:40:16] morning or about myself I need a
[1:40:18] wakening
[1:40:19] up
[1:40:22] how was our Prophet well brother
[1:40:26] Tim the reason there's no hope for
[1:40:29] Revival that you're expecting is because
[1:40:33] it's a word Revival and you know it's
[1:40:36] the word word and the word
[1:40:39] only and you just said it brother Tim
[1:40:41] there's only one remedy to get regain
[1:40:44] his favor and that's back to the
[1:40:47] word our Revival is the opening of the
[1:40:49] word brother Tim
[1:40:51] but yeah why little Bethlehem we
[1:40:55] bypassed on Creeds and drinking
[1:40:57] stagnated water for from Sister what we
[1:41:00] need today is an opening of the word
[1:41:03] that
[1:41:05] lives and he's the same yesterday today
[1:41:08] and
[1:41:09] forever I tell you what many of what we
[1:41:13] got no wonder the world don't want it it
[1:41:15] don't live that's right no wonder the
[1:41:18] kids don't want it it don't live at home
[1:41:20] that's right
[1:41:22] right amen you know and friends you can
[1:41:24] preach whatever you want to from the
[1:41:25] pulpit but if it don't live in your home
[1:41:27] it's
[1:41:32] worthless life can't come from an
[1:41:35] intellectual Revival that's right I'm
[1:41:38] reading this now from broken sister 65
[1:41:41] that life cannot come from just an
[1:41:43] intellectual Revival it's got to come
[1:41:46] out of the Bible word Revival and the
[1:41:49] word is the same yesterday today and
[1:41:50] forever and when it falls today and
[1:41:52] quickens listen you get the same
[1:41:56] results you did in Acts 2 amen exactly
[1:42:01] it always has and always will be because
[1:42:04] it's the spirit of God that conditions
[1:42:06] the
[1:42:08] atmosphere brother wrote me recently and
[1:42:11] he he is a lay member and he he was from
[1:42:14] South Africa he said I I'm really
[1:42:15] concerned about my church brother we
[1:42:17] have a WhatsApp group and they put on
[1:42:18] there you know about prayer for so and
[1:42:20] so and prayer for and he said you know
[1:42:23] in our church there's never an alter
[1:42:24] call there's never prayer for the sick
[1:42:26] and and he said I'm concerned about it I
[1:42:29] I wrote it back I I'm not concerned that
[1:42:31] there's no altar calls or no prayer for
[1:42:33] prayer lines in your church that's not
[1:42:35] what I'm concerned about I'm concerned
[1:42:38] that the
[1:42:39] atmosphere is not there to cause souls
[1:42:42] to run to the Altar and an atmosphere
[1:42:45] produced where the sick can be healed
[1:42:49] that's what I'm concerned
[1:42:51] amen it's not the physical prayer line
[1:42:53] and the act of going through the prayer
[1:42:55] line or people coming down the altar I'm
[1:42:57] concerned there's no
[1:43:00] atmosphere it takes the atmosphere of
[1:43:02] the Holy Ghost amen you you can see what
[1:43:06] brother Bram said it's got to be brought
[1:43:09] into Focus if you great message to to
[1:43:12] listen to is the message look I got so
[1:43:14] many things from in 1963 brother Bron
[1:43:17] preached it God read it I I was studying
[1:43:20] one time coming back on the plane and I
[1:43:22] was just weeping and crying through
[1:43:24] every paragraph of it but anyway he said
[1:43:27] he said if obeying the word taking this
[1:43:29] range fi finder and bringing it down to
[1:43:32] place till I see the same thing those
[1:43:35] Apostles saw and the gospel they preach
[1:43:37] it'll produce the same results because
[1:43:39] it did for them it'll strike the target
[1:43:41] every time no matter what the churches
[1:43:43] said and the people who claims to be I
[1:43:45] don't know it'll do it but this is what
[1:43:47] I want to look at that the word to see
[1:43:50] that it's exactly in focus to see the
[1:43:53] same vision they saw and it'll do the
[1:43:55] same job that it did for them it'll heal
[1:43:57] the sick it'll raise the dead it'll cast
[1:43:59] out Devils it'll bring forth a glorious
[1:44:02] Church who is willing to seal their
[1:44:04] testimony with their own blood if it
[1:44:07] comes necessary to do that amen so you
[1:44:10] see there again we have all of these
[1:44:13] things of course there's a lot of things
[1:44:15] that we could go on today but I want to
[1:44:17] get down to here on the bride's Revival
[1:44:21] brother brandham told us and I was there
[1:44:24] as a little boy when brother brandham
[1:44:25] said this he Saidi not looking for
[1:44:29] Revival in our
[1:44:31] generation I'm looking for the coming of
[1:44:33] the Lord in our
[1:44:36] generation now they were the Revival
[1:44:39] he's speaking of was another Divine
[1:44:41] Healing another great isua movement
[1:44:43] another world wide sweeping
[1:44:46] Revival but you realize the coming of
[1:44:49] the Lord comes first as the word to a
[1:44:53] prophet the come of the Lord is not
[1:44:56] moment twinkling in the eye that's her
[1:44:58] change it happens in stages yes the
[1:45:01] coming of the Lord comes first as a word
[1:45:04] to a prophet yes and then the word taken
[1:45:06] on flesh being fully manifested in Bride
[1:45:10] form and then
[1:45:14] finally caught up to meet the Lord in
[1:45:16] the air see it took the fullness of the
[1:45:19] word to make a bride uh Christ had to
[1:45:24] come in word form to a prophet but that
[1:45:27] ain't where it ends a lot of people get
[1:45:29] that far God sent a prophet and we got a
[1:45:32] message that's wonderful but you realize
[1:45:34] what is produced it must take on
[1:45:39] flesh amen it must it must produce not
[1:45:43] just the word coming it must change to
[1:45:46] the bride coming yes yes amen
[1:45:51] because if there's no bride if there
[1:45:53] isn't Christ in Bride form there'll be
[1:45:56] no Rapture to be nobody to come for and
[1:45:59] if God had not send us a message there
[1:46:02] would have been no bride that was born
[1:46:04] out of that word so that there could be
[1:46:06] a Rapture but remember it's not the
[1:46:09] message is only the precursor it's what
[1:46:13] was pointing to what was it to produce
[1:46:15] Christ has to be here on Earth in
[1:46:19] bride's Farm
[1:46:21] yes now you know I I can go right on
[1:46:23] down where you know the different things
[1:46:25] and I'm skipping a lot of things but you
[1:46:26] know in the third seal brother bandam
[1:46:29] this famous quote today that's what
[1:46:31] reason today we the revivals we're
[1:46:33] supposed to have we have denominational
[1:46:36] revivals we haven't had a real stiring
[1:46:38] no no no sir don't think we got revivals
[1:46:40] we haven't oh they got millions and
[1:46:42] millions of church members but not a
[1:46:44] Revival nowhere oh again he he told us
[1:46:48] just a denominational Revival then he
[1:46:50] says the bride hasn't had a Revival yet
[1:46:54] there's been no Revival there no
[1:46:57] manifestation of God totir the bride yet
[1:47:00] we're looking for it will take those
[1:47:03] seven unknown Thunders back there to
[1:47:05] wake her up again he will send it he
[1:47:08] promised it now watch so you see here
[1:47:12] again brother bradam said the bride has
[1:47:14] not had her Revival yet and many have
[1:47:18] run off with it well now we are the
[1:47:20] Brides Revival let me tell you he told
[1:47:22] us what it would take to bring it it
[1:47:25] would take those seven unknown Thunders
[1:47:29] which were the Mysteries contained in
[1:47:31] the Seven Seals to give us an open book
[1:47:36] the full word yes and from that full
[1:47:40] word would come the bride's Revival yes
[1:47:43] not part of the word that's why I'm
[1:47:45] advocating today brother not just a part
[1:47:48] not One Wing amen not just emphasizing
[1:47:52] one thing that's right oh I know our
[1:47:54] missionary deals we got you know we get
[1:47:56] them believe the message okay believe
[1:47:57] serpent seed all right now be baptized
[1:48:00] in Jesus name and never take them on to
[1:48:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost never pray
[1:48:04] him
[1:48:05] through just leave them there in a
[1:48:08] Sanctified condition if that my
[1:48:12] goodness my God don't we realize it
[1:48:15] ain't just baptizing them amen in water
[1:48:19] they got to be ized by the spirit and
[1:48:22] you've left out the main thing
[1:48:28] amen now brother brandham talked about
[1:48:31] them in those days saying Revival in our
[1:48:33] time back this that and the other he
[1:48:35] said they hadn't recognize the Awakening
[1:48:37] of the bride and I got I I got different
[1:48:40] things that we could go on but remember
[1:48:42] he tells us in streetport one of the
[1:48:45] last things imparted imparted after
[1:48:48] saying I'm looking for the come the the
[1:48:50] Lord I'm not looking for Revival in the
[1:48:52] same sermon he
[1:48:56] says he said
[1:48:59] uh it can't go on like this it's got to
[1:49:02] be something and it's moving right now
[1:49:04] friend it's on the move is on for the
[1:49:07] bride that's the truth that's thus saith
[1:49:11] the
[1:49:12] Lord so the bride's
[1:49:15] Revival is a word Revival but it's a not
[1:49:19] a dead letter but a letter but a word
[1:49:22] that lives as we said we need today
[1:49:25] quoting the prophet an opening of the
[1:49:28] word that lives amen that he's the same
[1:49:31] yesterday today and forever so it must
[1:49:34] take on flesh and he and he said until
[1:49:37] the church becomes both Dynamics and
[1:49:40] mechanics and the spirit of God that
[1:49:42] moved him to do the same things that he
[1:49:44] did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will
[1:49:47] the bride if he said in John 14:12 he
[1:49:50] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:49:51] shall he do also I'll give him a charge
[1:49:53] of my Dynamics and his mechanics that
[1:49:56] the world won't be able to with stand it
[1:49:58] now raising up in the last day the
[1:50:01] Dynamics and mechanics together the
[1:50:03] mechanics without the Dynamics no good
[1:50:06] neither is the Dynamics without the
[1:50:08] mechanics you can scream and shout and
[1:50:09] jump up and down all you want to and
[1:50:11] deny his word it won't do any good amen
[1:50:14] we got to fulfill the Great Commission
[1:50:17] one thing brother Bram told us in
[1:50:19] invisible Union the bride he said the
[1:50:20] Great Commission has not been
[1:50:22] fulfilled and he said it take the
[1:50:25] opening of The Seven Seals to fulfill it
[1:50:28] he said you know because he said you
[1:50:30] know they can't take even part of the
[1:50:32] word how in the world can they take the
[1:50:34] opening of these Seven Seals so he said
[1:50:37] so that means that it's on your
[1:50:39] shoulders and mine to fulfill the Great
[1:50:41] Commission and the Great Commission is
[1:50:43] to preach the gospel and these signs
[1:50:45] shall follow them that believe in my
[1:50:48] name they shall cast out devils they
[1:50:50] will speak with new tongues is that
[1:50:52] right amen go you can go through the
[1:50:54] restoration of the brid tree and brother
[1:50:56] BR over again and spoken words Original
[1:50:59] Seed the the different revivals he said
[1:51:01] the formals had had their Revival and
[1:51:03] the Pentecostals had there but then he
[1:51:05] said the word will produce a Revival the
[1:51:08] word's going to bring Sons and Daughters
[1:51:10] of God are you with me the bride must
[1:51:13] prod bride tree must produce the fruit
[1:51:15] of the groom amen now then I'm going to
[1:51:17] sum it up just for you just in these
[1:51:21] next couple of minutes I want you just
[1:51:23] to get several thoughts brother brandom
[1:51:26] weaves all the way he starts in
[1:51:28] Jeffersonville with this so it's to us
[1:51:32] and then all the way through everywhere
[1:51:34] that he goes to the country he
[1:51:38] preaches he preaches two
[1:51:43] scenarios that he
[1:51:46] painted in sermons like be not afraid
[1:51:50] gowake Jesus testimony on the
[1:51:54] sea and he talks about after coming to
[1:51:56] the great
[1:51:58] Revival and they're tested they out on
[1:52:00] the sea and they're
[1:52:03] testifying about the velia meetings oh
[1:52:06] yeah about the how God moved in Chicago
[1:52:09] how God did this and how God that yeah
[1:52:12] I'm paraphrasing
[1:52:14] that so you know I'm trying to bring it
[1:52:17] current yes cuz they were testifying on
[1:52:19] the sea you see that blind man that was
[1:52:21] healed there and pul shalom shalom and
[1:52:24] all of this but you know we come through
[1:52:27] this great
[1:52:28] Revival and there's two
[1:52:30] scenarios two things that are happening
[1:52:34] one people have left on the journey
[1:52:39] without him that's
[1:52:41] right
[1:52:43] two Jesus for others Jesus is in their
[1:52:48] boat but but he's
[1:52:50] asleep and needs to be
[1:52:55] awakened two things some went without
[1:52:58] him they don't have him at all and when
[1:53:01] he comes they're scared of
[1:53:03] him it's
[1:53:05] fanaticism we don't want what happened
[1:53:07] on the day of Pentecost we got something
[1:53:10] different from that brother Brandon said
[1:53:13] it'll it'll produce exactly what was in
[1:53:15] Acts to that's
[1:53:17] right the
[1:53:18] others they got Jesus but they let him
[1:53:22] go to
[1:53:24] sleep he needs to be awakened we're in
[1:53:26] the storm
[1:53:28] yes we need an Awakening
[1:53:32] amen of Jesus in our lives yes sir oh
[1:53:35] yeah we were Awakening we've got the
[1:53:37] Awakening of the Bride we recognized
[1:53:39] Seven Seals are open these Mysteries are
[1:53:40] revealed and we got all these truths and
[1:53:42] all these mystery truths and yeah we got
[1:53:44] that but Jesus is
[1:53:48] asleep
[1:53:50] storms in in your churches yes storms in
[1:53:54] your homes storms around the country yes
[1:53:57] and you need Jesus awaken that's in you
[1:54:01] amen amen here's another thing starting
[1:54:05] in
[1:54:06] Jeffersonville he preaches a sermon a
[1:54:08] deceive Church by the
[1:54:10] world and from there he preaches just
[1:54:13] once more
[1:54:15] Lord and across the
[1:54:18] country he is telling us that there's a
[1:54:21] new
[1:54:25] crop that old blind Samson in his
[1:54:29] wretched condition to
[1:54:31] church that there's still a possibility
[1:54:34] of a
[1:54:37] Revival and he says and once more they
[1:54:40] don't realize it that there's a
[1:54:43] possibility of Revival they don't
[1:54:44] realize the possibility they hadn't
[1:54:47] caught the vision yet yes we're not
[1:54:51] going to have another isusa Street yes
[1:54:53] we I know we are not going to go through
[1:54:56] another Divine Healing meeting and
[1:54:58] movement as much as personally I'd love
[1:55:01] to have it oh yes come on Amen but
[1:55:06] listen friend that's not what's promised
[1:55:08] but there is possibility of
[1:55:11] Revival because listen it's not a
[1:55:14] Revival that Tim pu and evening light
[1:55:16] Tabernacle has started it happened
[1:55:19] because of the opening of The Seven
[1:55:21] Seals and the mysteries of God revealed
[1:55:24] the Thunder spoke out and it was calling
[1:55:27] for the bride out of the church you said
[1:55:29] well we need
[1:55:31] unity in the church brother Tim what
[1:55:33] what we need is listen brother bam was
[1:55:36] crying Unity where the Baptist could
[1:55:37] meet and the Presbyterian the Catholic
[1:55:40] how many is there anybody in here that
[1:55:41] was formerly Catholic raise your hand no
[1:55:45] Baptist formerly B what one Baptist
[1:55:48] anybody Presbyterian cathol or
[1:55:51] Pentecostal denomination anybody else
[1:55:53] okay there's another anybody okay there
[1:55:56] you are and we're all meeting under the
[1:55:58] same roof yes the vision brother Bram
[1:56:01] had of that Unity is been a gathering
[1:56:04] out of denomination sitting right in
[1:56:06] your churches that's
[1:56:09] right where that they're all together
[1:56:11] now under one umbrella of one headship
[1:56:14] and that's Christ
[1:56:18] amen
[1:56:20] and there's possibility of Revival
[1:56:23] yes listen but you got to die to your
[1:56:27] pride yes amen reason we hold on to a
[1:56:30] lot of things is because old stinking
[1:56:33] Pride you got to die to the things of
[1:56:35] the
[1:56:37] world need a full
[1:56:39] surrenderance we need a Revival in the
[1:56:42] Pulpit before we can expect Revival in
[1:56:45] the Pew amen we need a coming back and a
[1:56:49] molding yes and saying God bring back
[1:56:52] that first love in my life yes yes I got
[1:56:56] to be willing to pay the
[1:56:58] price there is possibility of a real
[1:57:01] Revival you can have it
[1:57:04] personally what we brother brandham said
[1:57:07] then why Christ speak and I've quoted it
[1:57:11] to you he says we need a repentance we
[1:57:15] need a Revival I'm saying this myself
[1:57:18] how can I over come he says I'm
[1:57:21] preaching this sermon because I think
[1:57:25] it's a time that we should never let the
[1:57:27] spirit of Revival
[1:57:30] die how can I overcome well read these
[1:57:33] books on psychology I tell you what
[1:57:35] these are some self-help thing I'll give
[1:57:37] you seven steps of how to get rid of
[1:57:39] pornography we'll have a seminar of 78
[1:57:41] days that won't work church amen it
[1:57:44] won't work
[1:57:45] preachers what's going to work is a
[1:57:48] dying out to sin
[1:57:50] you know to dying out and coming back to
[1:57:52] God in a real Revival fire in your own
[1:57:55] heart and you to preach life dead
[1:57:58] sermons
[1:58:01] kill and dead preachers give out dead
[1:58:05] sermons I'm not talking about you I'm
[1:58:07] talking about
[1:58:09] myself not even pointing fingers your
[1:58:11] way I'm not pointing out anybody
[1:58:13] individual or any certain group I'm just
[1:58:14] saying God we all need Revival in the
[1:58:18] ministry yes yes so there can be Revival
[1:58:21] in the pure amen we need a real
[1:58:24] dedication brother Bradon preached that
[1:58:26] on how can I overcome he said that's the
[1:58:28] way Christians are becoming they're dead
[1:58:30] in their sins and
[1:58:32] trespasses and they become Doty like an
[1:58:34] old log that he C tried to cross over
[1:58:36] and he just fell apart he said laying
[1:58:39] right there in the Stream of life right
[1:58:41] where the Water of Life is and rottens
[1:58:43] twice as quick and you'll have them on
[1:58:46] your pews and sit right there where the
[1:58:48] word's going for the pure word the holy
[1:58:51] the word that God sent to a prophet
[1:58:53] coming right through your pulpit and
[1:58:55] they'll die right in the Pew because
[1:58:58] they're not connected to
[1:59:00] life the greatest goal you ought to have
[1:59:03] for your church is to see it filled with
[1:59:06] the
[1:59:08] spirit we got the
[1:59:13] mechanics but the Dynamics of this
[1:59:16] church will be a refilling of the Holy
[1:59:20] Ghost it's time brother we ask God for a
[1:59:25] refilling
[1:59:27] amen
[1:59:30] sir is there hope for Revival yes sir I
[1:59:34] want to believe that men like you are
[1:59:36] hoped for that
[1:59:38] Revival because it's not going to end in
[1:59:41] a secular intellectual manner it's going
[1:59:44] to end with the supernatural
[1:59:47] display and you you talk about a Divine
[1:59:50] Healing
[1:59:52] Revival you haven't heard sir or seen
[1:59:56] nothing Hallelujah like what's
[1:59:59] coming you say brother Tim you've just
[2:00:02] read us listen we're not going to just
[2:00:05] see partial healings that's right

[2:00:09] heart or a healed heart and somebody 50y

[2:00:14] going to see gray hair come back to the
[2:00:15] right C amen we're going to see old age
[2:00:19] away yes we're going to be transformed
[2:00:21] in a moment a twinkling of an eye it is
[2:00:24] the greatest Divine Healing movement
[2:00:28] that has ever been lays right in front
[2:00:30] of you yes yes that's the TR where even
[2:00:35] those who are mere fragments of dust
[2:00:38] will raise from The Seven Ages whole
[2:00:42] again yes Hallelujah God bless you
[2:00:45] Brothers thank you for letting me
