[0:09] Good morning. Let's all stand. Have a
[0:12] word of prayer.
[0:16] Dear gracious father, Lord, we come
[0:18] before you this morning, Lord, on this
[0:21] rainy Sunday morning. Father, we thank
[0:24] you for the rain, Lord. For without it,
[0:27] that Lord, we couldn't live. Father, we
[0:30] take it as a type of your Holy Spirit
[0:32] pouring down upon us, Lord. That Father,
[0:36] we would take it and grow from it. Lord,
[0:38] that we would ask that your spirit would
[0:39] rain down in the building this morning.
[0:41] That Lord, that your spirit would move.
[0:43] That we would open our hearts. That you
[0:45] would anoint our hearts for revelation
[0:47] and for understanding.
[0:49] that Father that you would change what
[0:52] need to be changed and encourage where
[0:54] we would be weak. Father, uplift us and
[0:57] bring us closer to you. Father, we would
[1:00] invite you into our into our midst this
[1:02] morning in Jesus precious name. Amen.
[1:05] Um we want to
[1:08] um continue our thought that we've been
[1:11] uh we've been teaching on um titled Why
[1:14] are we here?
[1:16] And um uh I want to
[1:21] um if I can pull my notes up.
[1:28] This would be part five, I believe.
[1:31] Um and I want to
[1:34] uh we'll turn as a text. We'll go to St.
[1:37] John chapter 13.
[1:41] This is St. John chapter 13.
[1:45] And we'll start at
[1:48] um the 31st verse. St. John 13 and 31.
[1:56] Therefore,
[1:58] when he was gone out, Jesus said, "Now
[2:00] is the son of man glorified, and God is
[2:02] glorified in him. If God be glorified in
[2:05] him, God shall also glorify him in
[2:07] himself, and shall straightway glorify
[2:10] him." Little children, yet a little
[2:12] while, I am with you. Ye, ye shall seek
[2:15] me. And as I said unto the Jews,
[2:18] wheither I go, ye cannot come. So now I
[2:21] say to you,
[2:23] a new commandment I give unto you, that
[2:25] you love one another, as I have loved
[2:27] you, that you also love one another.
[2:31] By this shall all men know that you are
[2:33] my disciples, if you have love one to
[2:36] another. Bless the reading of the word.
[2:38] Y'all can be seated.
[2:40] So, I want to take as a subtitle this
[2:43] morning. Um, so my title is why are we
[2:46] here? And as a subtitle,
[2:48] love is a verb,
[2:51] right? We we all know remember from
[2:53] school what a verb is,
[2:55] &gt;&gt; right? A verb is an action. It's the
[2:58] it's the kind of words that denote an
[3:00] action, right? It's something that
[3:01] you're doing,
[3:03] &gt;&gt; right? You know, running is a verb. It
[3:05] denotes movement. You know, fighting is
[3:08] a is a verb. It denotes movement. Love,
[3:12] loving is a verb. It denotes actions. It
[3:14] denotes lifestyle. It denotes doing
[3:16] things. It's not just simply
[3:19] a a feeling. You know, if it's really a
[3:22] feeling that's that's true, then it'll
[3:23] it'll do something in your life. It will
[3:26] do something through your life.
[3:30] I want to uh this is a a quote that I've
[3:32] read several times now, but I want to
[3:34] read it again. Um this is from the
[3:35] message oneness in February the 11th,
[3:37] 1962.
[3:39] Um he says
[3:41] that's God's purpose and his purpose as
[3:45] father supreme was to be one with his
[3:48] family earthly family Adam and Eve and
[3:51] the only way that they could be one with
[3:53] the family or with God was because God's
[3:56] nature was in them. So that made them
[4:00] with God's nature in them. Then with
[4:03] each other and God they became all one.
[4:06] Isn't that a beautiful picture? God in
[4:10] in his family, father over all.
[4:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; And so this is the purpose of God. This
[4:16] is we could sum it all up in one
[4:18] paragraph. The purpose of God is to have
[4:20] oneness between himself and his family
[4:24] and his family one with another. That's
[4:26] the purpose of God.
[4:30] And so, um,
[4:35] I want to,
[4:37] uh, we'll pick up. This is first John
[4:40] verse 11. For this is the message that
[4:43] you heard from the beginning that we
[4:45] should love one another, not as Cain,
[4:48] who was of that wicked one, and slew his
[4:50] brother. And wherefore he slew him?
[4:53] Because his own works were evil and his
[4:55] brothers righteous.
[4:57] Marvel not, my brethren, if the world
[5:00] hate you. We know that we have passed
[5:03] from death unto life because we love the
[5:07] brethren.
[5:08] &gt;&gt; Right? That's that's how we know we pass
[5:09] from death to life is because we love
[5:11] one another.
[5:12] &gt;&gt; He that loveth not his brother abideth
[5:14] in death.
[5:16] Whosoever hateth his brother is a
[5:19] murderer. And you know that no murderer
[5:21] hath eternal life abiding in him.
[5:24] Whereby perceive we the love of God,
[5:28] because he laid down his life for us,
[5:30] and we ought to lay down our lives for
[5:32] the brethren. But who so hath this
[5:35] world's good, and seeth his brother have
[5:38] need, and shutth up his bowels of
[5:40] compassion from him, how dwelleth the
[5:43] love of God in him.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; My little children, let us not love in
[5:49] word, neither in tongue, but in deed and
[5:53] in truth.
[5:55] And hereby we know that we are of the
[5:57] truth and shall assure our hearts before
[6:00] him. For if our heart condemn us, God is
[6:04] greater than our heart and knoweth all
[6:06] things.
[6:08] &gt;&gt; Beloved, if our heart condemn us not,
[6:10] then have we confidence toward God. And
[6:12] whatsoever we ask, we receive of him,
[6:15] because we keep his commandments and do
[6:17] those things that are pleasing in his
[6:20] sight.
[6:22] So
[6:24] again here in first John
[6:28] what he's denoting here is that you know
[6:30] we're kind of reiterating
[6:33] you know it doesn't really matter um
[6:36] what you say with your mouth matters
[6:40] what you do right to some extent there's
[6:44] love is not just simply you know shaking
[6:46] somebody's hand and saying I love you
[6:48] it's not just you know telling people
[6:51] that you love them. It's doing, it's
[6:53] acting, it's behaving in a way that is
[6:56] self-sacrificial on their behalf.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:59] &gt;&gt; Right? You know, elsewhere the Bible
[7:01] says, "What you know, greater love hath
[7:03] any man that he would give his life for
[7:04] his friends." Right? You know, laying
[7:07] down your life is, you know, it says
[7:08] here that uh whereby we perceive the
[7:11] love of God because he he laid down his
[7:14] life for us and we ought to lay down our
[7:17] lives for the brethren.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; Right? You lay your life down. You you
[7:22] sacrifice your own desires. You
[7:24] sacrifice your own
[7:27] uh lifestyle in in many ways because
[7:32] it's that's you know your your life
[7:34] isn't just living, right? Laying your
[7:36] life down doesn't just mean dying for
[7:38] someone. Sometimes it just it mean it
[7:40] also means laying down your your um you
[7:44] know your own wishes, right? you
[7:46] sacrificing what your own pleasures in
[7:48] life to do something something for
[7:51] somebody else
[7:53] and we we do this
[7:55] you know not because
[7:59] you know it's it's like a you know with
[8:00] a man and a woman you know with me and
[8:02] my wife I don't I don't do things for my
[8:06] wife because I'm obligated to right
[8:10] there's not some government agency
[8:11] somewhere that's going to throw me in
[8:13] jail if I don't buy my wife flowers,
[8:16] &gt;&gt; right? I'm sure plenty of sisters wish
[8:19] there was
[8:22] but but you know it doesn't exist. You
[8:24] know, at the end of the day, the the
[8:27] your marriage is between the two of you.
[8:29] And
[8:30] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't do things for my wife
[8:32] because I, you know, am obligated to or
[8:35] it's some, you know, I have some some
[8:39] penalty over hanging over my head if I
[8:40] don't. It's because I love my wife,
[8:43] right? I I want I you know it's it turns
[8:46] out you can like 12 bucks at Publix can
[8:48] buy you a lot more flowers than you
[8:49] might think and it's like the best 12
[8:51] bucks I'll ever spend, right? Like it's
[8:55] it you know it's like it lights my whole
[8:57] day up. And so you know it it it's it's
[9:02] you know how much more does God want to
[9:04] do that to for one another? And how much
[9:06] more, you know, just going seeing
[9:08] somebody at church or or seeing knowing
[9:10] somebody's having a hard time or knowing
[9:12] that brother, that sister might not have
[9:14] anybody right now or or whatever
[9:17] whatever the situation is. when you know
[9:18] somebody's in a, you know, kind of in a
[9:21] in a in a in a dark place or is having a
[9:24] hard time that that you being the God
[9:28] with skin on it and saying, "I'm going
[9:30] to, you know, even if even if you don't
[9:32] really know them that well, even if
[9:33] you're not really close to that person,
[9:35] making the effort to go above and beyond
[9:37] and shake their hand and and and include
[9:39] them, invite them out to, you know, over
[9:41] to dinner or whatever, you know, invite
[9:43] them over to have some fellowship. go
[9:45] reach out to them
[9:47] because that's the Christ in you, right?
[9:51] The Christ will leave the 99 and go for
[9:53] the one,
[9:55] &gt;&gt; you know, and it's not just it's not
[9:56] just those that are lost, it's those
[9:58] that are hurting,
[9:59] &gt;&gt; you know, it's those that listen, God's
[10:03] people are sheep,
[10:04] &gt;&gt; right? God's people are sheep. And when
[10:08] lions hunt sheep, they don't attack the
[10:11] herd, right? They attack the one. They
[10:17] run the herd and isolate the one.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; Okay, that's this is a a
[10:24] anecdote I heard once. Um, so when lions
[10:28] hunt zebras, the you know, zebras all
[10:31] have stripes. Stripes are camouflage.
[10:33] But what in the world are zebra stripes
[10:36] blending into? It's not grass. It's not
[10:38] bushes. They live out on the on the
[10:40] plains. There's nothing to hide behind.
[10:42] What do the stripes camouflage them
[10:44] against? They camouflage them against
[10:46] the herd. You can't They're all all the
[10:49] zebras look exactly the same. You can't
[10:51] tell which one's which. And you can't
[10:53] just hunt,
[10:54] you know, the conceptual zebra. You have
[10:57] to hunt a particular zebra. And so what
[11:01] happens is when you have a whole herd of
[11:03] zebras, the lions can't figure out which
[11:05] one they're looking at to to hunt them.
[11:08] So, and we figured this out that the the
[11:10] purpose of zebra camouflage is to
[11:12] camouflage them against the herd because
[11:14] when biologists were trying to study
[11:17] zebras, they couldn't figure out which
[11:19] zebra was which either. So, they said,
[11:21] "I know when we have a particular zebra
[11:24] we want to track, we'll go take a red
[11:26] paintbrush and stick it with a red
[11:28] paintbrush so that's the one we're
[11:30] looking for." And they were able to tell
[11:32] which one the zebra which zebra they
[11:34] were looking at. And so could the lions.
[11:37] And every zebra that they tagged with a
[11:39] red paintbrush got devoured within 24
[11:41] hours. Right? The if you I the devil's
[11:45] goal is to isolate people
[11:48] &gt;&gt; to drive wedges because when those when
[11:50] there's a wedge and he can split
[11:52] somebody off from the group and get not
[11:55] even necessarily physically. They still
[11:56] come to church. They still even might,
[11:57] you know, come to fellowship. They might
[11:59] come to, you know, to uh to partake, you
[12:02] know, fellowship and and have friends
[12:04] and they're they're still close, but in
[12:06] their heart
[12:08] they feel alone in a crowd,
[12:10] &gt;&gt; right? In their heart, they don't feel
[12:12] the connection to the people. In their
[12:14] heart, they don't feel the kinship that
[12:16] they once did. And that's the devil
[12:18] driving that wedge in there. That's why
[12:20] God's purpose is oneness. There's
[12:22] strength. It it's again it's not for
[12:24] nothing that they were on the day of
[12:26] Pentecost in one minded one accord
[12:28] gathered together, right? You have to
[12:31] hold tight to your brothers and sisters
[12:34] in Christ because they're going to give
[12:35] you strength. They're going to give you
[12:37] encouragement. And if the devil can make
[12:39] you feel isolated, can make anyone feel
[12:41] isolated, then then they're then now
[12:43] they're an easy target, right? You know,
[12:47] now they're now that's when the devil
[12:50] can come in and say, "Oh, that group's
[12:51] just a bunch of hypocrites anyways.
[12:52] because they're supposed to have the
[12:53] love of God in their heart and nobody
[12:54] cares about you,
[12:56] &gt;&gt; right? Well, don't let the devil have
[12:58] that place. Don't be proactive. Be, you
[13:02] know, when you see the one getting split
[13:03] from the herd, move the whole herd,
[13:06] &gt;&gt; right? Don't like just don't let that
[13:09] happen. Be proactive. And if and if you
[13:11] feel the devil isolating you, recognize
[13:14] that it's the devil. Recognize that it's
[13:16] the devil trying to separate you and
[13:18] that you need to fight against that
[13:20] wholesale. Reach out to somebody. find
[13:22] somebody. Be proactive.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; You know, don't lay down and die,
[13:28] &gt;&gt; right? Be proactive.
[13:31] You know, it's so hard when the devil
[13:32] when the devil's coming against you and
[13:34] trying to make you feel alone and make
[13:36] you feel like you're, you know, you
[13:38] know, you're sitting under your juniper
[13:40] tree going, "Lord, just let me die. I'm
[13:42] all alone out here."
[13:44] &gt;&gt; No, there's there's 4,000 who haven't
[13:46] bowed the knee to bail. Right? There's
[13:48] thousands of there's people all around
[13:50] you, but it's it's the devil trying to
[13:52] trying to uh trying to break up the the
[13:56] oneness and the unity of God's family.
[13:58] So, it's important that we we do things.
[14:02] We don't just
[14:04] um we don't just say it's not just lip
[14:07] service,
[14:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; Um
[14:11] you I have some bullet points here. It
[14:13] says, "Having love one for another is
[14:15] the key to demonstrating the power of
[14:17] the Holy Ghost in this or any day. It
[14:20] doesn't matter how big your bank
[14:22] account, how big your house, how noble
[14:24] your profession, or how global your
[14:26] ministry is. Without the expression of
[14:28] the pure love of God to all those God
[14:32] has placed in your life, you prove by
[14:34] your nature that you have not passed
[14:36] from death unto life."
[14:39] Okay,
[14:41] this is from perseverance. Uh, brother
[14:43] um, McGary read this last Sunday and it
[14:46] just I want to read it again.
[14:49] U, this is from Perseverance. And the
[14:50] whole armor of God is faith, love, joy,
[14:52] peace, longsuffering, goodness,
[14:54] meekness, gentleness, patience. The
[14:56] whole armor of the believer is faith. We
[14:59] believe God by faith because God said
[15:02] so. Then what is it? Abraham was
[15:05] justified by Paul by faith, but by James
[15:10] by works. Abraham was talk uh what
[15:15] Abraham was talking what God saw and
[15:17] James was talking what man saw.
[15:21] Show me your faith by your works without
[15:24] your works and so forth. Then if you
[15:26] don't have works with your faith, it
[15:28] shows you haven't got faith. You're just
[15:31] talking from your mouth. But if you
[15:33] really got faith, you believe it and act
[15:36] like it. That's right. Put it in action.
[15:40] And this is the scripture he's
[15:41] referencing in James chapter 2 verse 14.
[15:44] What do it profit my brethren? Though a
[15:46] man say he hath faith and have not
[15:48] works, can faith save him? If a brother
[15:52] or sister be naked and destitute of
[15:54] daily food, and one of you say unto
[15:56] them, depart in peace, be ye warmed and
[15:59] filled. Notwithstanding you give them
[16:01] not those things which are needful to
[16:03] the body, what does it profit? Right? So
[16:06] it, you know, we want to, it's kind of
[16:08] like the story I told about the man who
[16:09] got lost on the death on the on the
[16:11] island, right? And he prayed, "Oh, the
[16:13] Lord's going to deliver me from this
[16:14] island and the boat comes and he says,
[16:15] "Oh no, the Lord, I don't need a boat.
[16:16] The Lord's going to deliver me." And
[16:17] then the helicopter comes. I don't need
[16:18] a helicopter. The Lord's going to
[16:19] deliver me. And then he dies.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; And then when he, you know, goes to
[16:23] heaven, the Lord's like, "I gave you a
[16:25] boat and a helicopter. What else were
[16:26] you looking for?"
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Right? This is what happens. You know,
[16:30] we have those in need amongst us. you
[16:32] know all everybody has people in need if
[16:35] not of and I and I'll get to this I
[16:37] would like to expand on this more in a
[16:38] minute but not just of necessarily of
[16:40] money don't don't make it so um you know
[16:43] monetary though there are people who who
[16:45] have need of financial things and we
[16:47] should help that when we can as well you
[16:48] know people are in a tight spot look
[16:50] even if you can't don't have the money
[16:52] you know times are tough for everybody
[16:53] it's not like you know everybody has
[16:54] money to give away but listen when when
[16:56] you know uh someone's you know a man
[16:59] gets hurt in the in the church and gets
[17:01] laid up and can't work and times are
[17:03] tough. You know, it used to be pretty
[17:05] normal that the church would bind
[17:06] together and all the sisters bake that
[17:08] family dinner. You know, they all make
[17:11] them dinner. That's not it's not a crazy
[17:13] notion, right? In fact, it was long
[17:16] before we had welfare programs, federal
[17:18] welfare programs, we had the church,
[17:20] right? The church was your social safety
[17:23] net. The church was the the people who
[17:25] were supposed to take care of you when
[17:26] things went really bad, right? whenever
[17:29] when people were sick, when people were
[17:30] hurt, you know, and and even beyond
[17:34] that, you know, it's the when people
[17:36] have need of emotional support,
[17:39] &gt;&gt; you know, when people are going have a
[17:41] loss in the family, it, you know, it's
[17:42] you're the people that they they need to
[17:44] be able to turn to for that emotional
[17:46] support to get them through that. You
[17:48] know, when people are having a hard time
[17:50] dealing with in this day and age when
[17:52] mental illness and depression and
[17:54] anxiety are so rampant, we need to have
[17:56] be able to turn one to the other and
[17:57] say, "Hey, I'm struggling right now. I
[17:59] you know, I'm having a hard time." And
[18:01] if they can't do that, then we don't
[18:03] have unity and and we're getting um you
[18:07] know, we're getting isolated, but we
[18:08] should be able to provide that to one to
[18:10] the other. And it's one thing to say,
[18:15] you know, when people, oh, brother, I'm
[18:16] I'm struggling right now for what with
[18:18] whatever thing. Oh, yeah. Well, you
[18:20] know, the Lord bless you. I'll be
[18:21] praying for you, brother.
[18:23] Okay, that's good. You should do that.
[18:26] You should pray for them. You know, have
[18:28] faith, brother. Yes, but you may have
[18:30] the ability to actually help them. You
[18:32] may be the answer to their prayer,
[18:35] right? Why? Don't don't you do we
[18:38] understand what I'm saying here? Like
[18:40] this isn't it's one thing you can't just
[18:42] be like, "Oh, brother, I know you're in
[18:43] need right now, but um have faith."
[18:46] Well, do you have what they have need
[18:47] of? Can you provide that? Do don't don't
[18:51] just wish them God's speed and send them
[18:52] on their way still cold, destitute,
[18:54] naked, and hungry, right? No, you do it.
[18:59] Do what you can, you know? Don't What
[19:03] was the point of that? Why did God put
[19:05] them in front of you if it wasn't to
[19:06] bless them?
[19:08] So what? You could, you know, tell them
[19:09] they're on their own. No, it's the the
[19:12] faith that you have.
[19:15] If you want to, if you say that you have
[19:16] faith in the word, if you say that you
[19:18] have the faith of in God, and notice in
[19:20] here when when James is talking about
[19:22] faith, he's not talking about faith as
[19:23] sort of like though this is part of it,
[19:25] not but not just simply faith like faith
[19:27] for healing, but the faith of like the
[19:30] Christian faith,
[19:31] &gt;&gt; right? It's are you a Christian? If you
[19:34] are a Christian and you are Christlike
[19:36] and you do what Christ would do, then
[19:38] you will be a provider because Jehovah
[19:41] is Jehovah provider,
[19:42] &gt;&gt; right? Jehovah Gyra should be in you.
[19:45] And so when people when his people have
[19:46] needs, you should be trying to be
[19:48] proactive to supply that need when and
[19:50] where you can.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; Um even so faith if it hath not works is
[19:57] dead being alone. Yay, a man may say,
[20:01] "Thou hast faith, thou hast faith, and I
[20:04] have works. Show me thy faith without
[20:07] works, and I will show thee my faith by
[20:10] my works. Thou believest that there is
[20:12] one God, thou doest well. The devil also
[20:15] believes and tremble." But wilt thou
[20:17] know, O vain man, that faith without
[20:19] works is dead.
[20:22] Okay, you, we can say we're Christians.
[20:24] We can say that we love one another. We
[20:26] can say all these things, but if we have
[20:29] absolutely no interest in fellowshipping
[20:32] one another,
[20:34] really, are you sure about that? Right?
[20:38] How confident are you that you really
[20:40] love your brothers if you don't want
[20:42] anything to do with them? Amen.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; You know, how much how much love do you
[20:50] have one towards the other
[20:52] if there's no desire in your heart to be
[20:56] Jehovah with skin on it for them to be
[20:58] the the provider of the needs of the of
[21:01] the church body?
[21:03] Everybody has their part to play. Not
[21:04] everybody can do everything, right? Not
[21:07] everybody can do everything. But what
[21:08] part you can't? Even if it's as simple
[21:10] as simple, like I said, even if it's as
[21:12] simple as someone, you know, they're
[21:14] having a hard time, everybody's sick,
[21:16] and you decide to just bake them a
[21:18] casserole.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; If that's all you can do, then that's
[21:21] all it is. I know, um, Sister Emily
[21:24] Curtis sings this song. I I particularly
[21:26] love this song. Um, but there's a line
[21:28] in there that says, "If if uh if just a
[21:31] cup of water I place within your hands,
[21:32] then just a cup of water is all that I
[21:34] demand." Right? If all God gave you was
[21:37] a gift to be there for someone, then be
[21:39] there for them.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; That's all that's all that's required of
[21:41] you. Do what God use the ox code that
[21:45] God put in your hand. Right? If okay,
[21:47] you might not be the great ministry
[21:49] who's going to circumn the globe of
[21:51] preaching to all the lost souls, but you
[21:54] may be the one who for whatever reason
[21:57] is able to build a close connection with
[21:58] a young person and help them through a
[22:00] difficult time and be the God with skin
[22:02] on it to that lost soul in particular.
[22:04] Amen.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; Right? You don't know what you can do.
[22:08] You know, whatever it is that you can
[22:10] do, do it as unto the Lord. Do it with
[22:12] all of your might. Be as let God work
[22:15] through that little thing. Little is a
[22:17] whole lot when God is doing it. Right?
[22:20] You know that those two loaves and, you
[22:22] know, five loaves and two fishes will
[22:24] end up feeding 5,000 people before it's
[22:26] all said and done because all you did
[22:28] was offer your little gift to the Lord,
[22:30] right? It doesn't have don't make this a
[22:35] um don't [clears throat] despi despise
[22:39] not the day of small things.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; Right?
[22:43] And I'll and I'll finish with this
[22:44] because I'm out of time here. It says,
[22:46] "The working of love starts at home."
[22:49] This is from 1 Timothy 5:8. But if any
[22:52] provide not for his own, especially for
[22:55] those in his own house, he hath denied
[22:58] the faith and is worse than an infidel.
[23:01] Matthew 6 verse 19. [clears throat]
[23:04] Uh, lay not up for yourselves treasures
[23:05] upon earth, where moth and rust doth
[23:07] corrupt, and where thieves break through
[23:09] and steal.
[23:11] But lay up for yourselves treasures in
[23:14] heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth
[23:17] corrupt, and where thieves do not break
[23:19] through nor steal. For where your
[23:20] treasure is, there will your heart be
[23:23] also.
[23:24] Listen, you're you might not be called
[23:29] to go spread the gospel to the seven
[23:32] continents, even to the Antarctica with
[23:35] the penguins. There's still there's
[23:37] still people down there, too. You might
[23:38] not be called to all of that, but you
[23:40] might be just a mom. And there's no such
[23:44] thing as just a mom. Just doesn't come
[23:46] into being a mom, right? Moms are the I
[23:50] mean, they're the future of the human
[23:52] race. I mean, it's it's only it's only
[23:54] the future of humanity. So, it's just,
[23:56] you know, no no no pressure. Um, you
[23:59] know, you're you're only bearing 10,000
[24:01] worlds in your hand. You know, that that
[24:04] baby is only the most precious thing
[24:05] that God ever put on the earth. So,
[24:08] there's no just about it. It's the most
[24:12] important thing that you'll ever do.
[24:13] It's the most important thing pretty
[24:14] much any any human being will ever do,
[24:17] right? I can only I can only do so much.
[24:20] ministry gets, you know, maybe an hour
[24:24] at best, two hours a couple times a week
[24:27] with people in a in a group. Moms get
[24:30] every single day, every hour of every
[24:33] day with that baby. And your mission
[24:36] field is the baby God put in your hands,
[24:39] right? You have such an opportunity. you
[24:45] it'll so many people at the end of the
[24:49] day brother brother Brandham said that
[24:51] if if there was a fifth gospel written
[24:53] it would be the love of a mother
[24:55] &gt;&gt; right what is the gospel it's the life
[24:58] of Christ presented to people to say
[25:00] there's good news that your life could
[25:02] be better mom you're the first version
[25:04] of God that baby's ever going to see you
[25:06] let God operate through you and you will
[25:08] be Christ to that baby you will be the
[25:11] good news to that baby that when that
[25:12] little kid grows up and becomes a
[25:14] rebellious teenager, they will see mama
[25:17] loving them through all of that and say,
[25:18] "There's a better way of being, right? I
[25:22] don't have to live this way because mom
[25:24] loves me." And that
[25:27] isn't
[25:29] nothing. It's not small. That's not
[25:33] Listen, I really got to quit, but I'll
[25:35] I'll finish by with this statement.
[25:38] When Jesus fed 5,000 people with five
[25:41] loaves and two fishes, it was a little
[25:43] boy who brought that food to him. The
[25:46] little boy didn't make his own lunch.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; Right? The he the the unsung hero of
[25:51] that story was the mom who took time to
[25:53] make her little boy lunch. Right? She
[25:56] was doing her job. She was doing her
[25:58] calling. And it was through her
[26:00] handiwork that it made it into the hands
[26:02] of Jesus.
[26:04] So do
[26:06] make your kids lunch, right? Do what you
[26:09] need to do because that's God. You're
[26:11] shining your light for your kids.
[26:14] Anyways, that's it. That's all I got.
[26:16] God bless you guys. Let's stand and have
[26:19] a quick word of prayer.
[26:22] Father, we come before you this morning.
[26:24] We thank you for this time that we've
[26:25] had. Lord, we ask that you would take
[26:28] the words that I've spoken, Lord, and
[26:30] that you would just take it and it would
[26:32] it would not something that I would have
[26:34] said of my own thinking, Lord, but
[26:36] something that you could anoint little
[26:37] piece of your word, Father, that would
[26:39] fall into somebody's heart that they
[26:40] could hold on to. Lord, give them
[26:42] strength by it. Encourage the people,
[26:44] Father. We ask these things in your holy
[26:46] and precious name, Lord Jesus.
