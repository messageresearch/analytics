Sunday School: The Word Dynamo -Bro. Mathew Smith
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Is this Are we on? Okay, good. Wasn't sure if we were doing Sunday school today because we were taking a trip to Israel. Um but uh anyhow, we're going to press on um with this little thought I had. Um the uh hopefully I'll be able to finish it today. If not, then we'll pick it up in the new year. Um but um my I meant to sorry sound booth I didn't send you a title for this, but the title for today is the word dynamo. Um, and that'll become apparent why here in a minute. Um, so I want to take for a scripture if we could. Um, if our our screen is covered up today, so you're going to have to actually have your Bible. Um, which we'll turn to the book of Acts, chapter 2. And uh we're going to go Acts chapter 2 and verse one. And it says here, "And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the spirit gave them utterance. And there uh and yeah, we'll we'll finish there. Um so um before we go any further, let's let's have a word of prayer. Um bow our hearts. Dear heavenly father, Lord, we come before you this morning, Lord, asking that you would meet us here in this Sunday school service that we might be might learn something, Father. We might add some knowledge, Father, to our stature of the perfect man. Lord, we could grow in your in your knowledge, gain gain some understanding, Father, that your Holy Spirit might might inhabit that knowledge and and use it, Father, to the furthering of your kingdom. We ask you be with us, invite you in, be with us throughout the service and into the into this worship service and into the uh the the programming that we have for today, into the preaching of the word. Ask that you'd be with us throughout Jesus precious name. Amen. Now, um so I want to we're all very obviously very familiar with this um this scripture and um this this falling of the Holy Spirit and the and the the hol power of the Holy Spirit moving into the church is the goal. It is the standard by which every church from then till now has been measured by. Right? If it's if you're not living up to the standard of the Acts two church, then you're not a church. Right? that like that's that is the standard. That is the the um the the goal. Um if that's not your goal, then you completely missing what uh what Christ taught. And so, um, the, um, as a, as a, uh, as Christians, it, you know, we really have to take do take every step that is possible to put ourselves in a position to allow that holy same Holy Ghost to fill and manifest and operate in our lives and everything. Right? That that is the that is the goal. That's that's our that's our purpose as Christians. Why we come to church. It's why we read our Bibles. It's why we name the name of Christ is because that promise is to us and it's and it's supposed to be working in our lives and in our church which you know I believe that it is working in our church and in our lives. Um and um the you know the purpose of is to is to um remove anything of yourself that would hinder that. And so it would allow it to even fully uh even more so uh manifest. Now I want to read um this is in second Peter chapter 1 and it said and beside this giving all diligence this is verse 5. And beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and your virtue knowledge and your knowledge temperance and your temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity. I want to look here in verse 5. It says, "And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge." This is a quote um believe Brother Caleb read this um some a few Sundays back and it says this is from the sermon a statue of a perfect man and he says, brother Brandham says, "Then to your faith add virtue." Now, right there knocks a lot of us down. Yes, sir. Add virtue to your faith. That doesn't just mean living a virgin life, you know, like the woman or a man and so forth. That doesn't have nothing to do with that. The Bible said, we read over here in the book of Luke where it said virtue went out of him. Is that right? If we're going to be like him, we must have virtue. Then we must have it to be like him. Right. &gt;&gt; So, you know, this is we're I'm sure we're we're all familiar with the in in Luke chapter 8, but I'll just read it. Um Luke chapter 8 and verse 45. And it said, "And Jesus said, who touched me?" When all denied, Peter, and they that were with him said, "Master, the multitude throng thee, and press thee, and sayest thou, who touched me?" And Jesus said,"Nobody hath or somebody hath touched me, for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me." So what brother Brandham is saying here is that in in Peter and you know I'm sure somewhere around here there's a a we've all seen it the drawing right the statue of perfect man the the the pyramid and here we are supposed to add to faith virtue and virtue knowledge and brother Brandham's not simply saying you know you the carnal sort of understanding of what that scripture is saying is you know add to your faith sort of clean living. Brother Brandham is saying, well, actually it's more than that. Add to your faith actually the power of the Holy Ghost, right? It's it's actually power because if we he he brother Brandon's linking it to where in in Luke, if you look at the word when Jesus said um and somebody hath touched me, I perceive that virtue has gone out of me. The word virtue there translates back to the Greek that it was written in to the word dynamon. Okay? Okay. And that is a Greek word that means force specially miraculous power. Okay. That is specifically the word it the word dynamon that word virtue means miraculous power. So we could read it as Jesus said somebody have touched me for I perceive that power is gone out from me. Okay. And so we can take this word dynamon and we can trace it through the Bible and see where all did does this word come up. And it's the same word that is used in Acts chapter 1. And starting in verse 6, um when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? And he said unto them, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in his own power, but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and ye shall be witness unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth." And so what Jesus is saying here that again the same word that he used here that the power that they would receive was the same power that went out of him when the woman was healed. &gt;&gt; That's I mean it's the same word it it tracks through. And so this creates a um by the way you know and I I want to want to uh do put you just make some commentary on that word the the word damon this is the same word that we it's the the Greek root word where we get the word dynamite right it's the same as the word dynamite it's the same as the word dynamo right or or that's the origin of it or the word dynamo originates from from this Greek. And a dynamo, for any of you who don't know what that is, a dynamo is a fancy sciency word for a power generator, right? Anything from a little pull start generator all the way up to a, you know, multi-megawatt nuke plant is a dynamo. And you know, the purpose of that is it's it it produces power. Now they and I want to make a note here because all of these all of these uh any any sort of dynamo is measured in in a particular rating, right? If you're looking at a generator, you don't measure the the size of the generator by the horsepower. You don't really measure it by how loud it is or how much fuel it consumes. What you're measuring is the kilowatts, right? You're measuring the power output. How much power does this thing produce? And this is again, this is everything from a little polestart all the way up to a nuke plant all have a power rating. It's how much power they produce. It's in other words, you know, to be a dynamo, the whole thing is linked back to power. Well, what's power scientifically? Because we measure these things in in in watts and kilowatts and megawws. Well, what's a watt? A watt is a specifically it's a scientific term for the measure of power. It's, you know, there's a scientific definition of what power is. Power is, if I can pull up my note here, um power is um power is the ability to convert energy into work. Okay, that's what it is. It's there to convert energy. It's the ability to convert energy into work. Energy is potential, right? You have a lot of energy in in a gas can, but it's not doing anything. It's a lot of potential, but it's not a lot of work, right? One way to say this is that um you can have a truck full of gas, right? The amount of energ fuel in the tank, that's how much potential it has. But the size of the load it can pull is the horsepower, right? That's the that's you know the size of the load it can it's it's what power is is not simply a you know how much explosion there is how much you know fire comes out of it it's how much productive output does it have it's not simply you know power or uh you know energy can produce a big light show but power is what turns the wheels &gt;&gt; right power is when you put your energy into something productive And so when notice when Jesus said that virtue went out of him, it's because someone got healed. Something productive happened there, &gt;&gt; right? It's not. And so what what happens is in and it's not just the message. This is a this is a a a thing across Christianity. You have kind of two camps. You have in modern language we we would use the term charismatic. Brother Brandham used the term Pentecostal versus the fundamentalists, right? And you have fundamentalists who are all about nuts and bolts, practical teaching. It's all about do you you know your it's memory verse Christianity, right? Do you know your your Bible verses? Do you know the scripture? Do you know um you know it's all about you know church order and works? How clean of a life do you have? It's kind it can go off into legalism and things like that. And it's, you know, I I it's kind of a joke, but it illustrates the point. If you get someone who's go offs into the too far into fundamentalism, then they're the kind of church that um you got to, you know, submit your application and wait 3 to five business days for your permit to say hallelujah in church, right? It's it it becomes so restrictive and so cold and so formal because it's all about the dos and the don'ts and the and and knowing your scriptures and and education then and there's no life in it. It becomes too kind of it it dies. But then on the other side you have charismatics, right? They're all about they're all about the the power and the demonstration and the jumping and shouting and and does the music, you know, does the music get people worked up and you know they'll have a great service, right? They come to church and they're the preacher is really dynamic and everyone's jumping up and down and you know speaking in tongues and and you get off too far into that and it becomes too much. It go it becomes so much about the emotional workup in the church that you know people don't people like get disappointed in church if the preacher wasn't cutting back flips and and you know people weren't running around the ser you know running around the building and but the but the question there is yeah everyone was jumping. We love to see it. There's no there's no criticism if people are jumping and shouting. The question is when you when your feet hit the ground, do you walk straight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And so it becomes a it becomes too focused on the emotional outburst. It's it's a release of energy, but there's no productive turning of the wheels, right? And so both there's a ditch on both sides here. You can go off too far into one or you can go off too far into the other. &gt;&gt; But what power is and now the reason why I, you know, am taking this particular point is because my job every day is I am a a generator mechanic. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every day I go fix dynamos. That's what I do. And when you you know when you're talking about you know so are the purpose of this is to is to imbue every Christian with dynamo power right &gt;&gt; now interesting things about about that what that is is number one is it has to be productive. It's got to be harnessed and and doing something productive. I can go fire up a generator and just go ground the the power leads out onto out onto a a light pole somewhere and you'll get a fireworks display. It'll go scream, you know, popping and arcs of, you know, power going everywhere and things catching on fire. It's really impressive, right? I've seen some generators fail um spectacularly and it's a light show, let me tell you. But it's not doing anything productive. You're not going to you're not going to turn your air conditioning on with that. You're not going to turn the lights on, you know. you're not going to do anything. It's just going to it's just going to be destructive at best or, you know, at at best useless and destructive at worst. &gt;&gt; And so, but usually when a when a a generator fails, most of the time it's a fuel delivery problem. &gt;&gt; Okay? Most of the time it's a fuel delivery problem. And what you get with that is you get a you get a dead generator, right? It's mechan it might be mechanically perfectly fine, right? I mean, look, when you a generator comes into our shop, it's the most mechanically perfect it's ever going to be. It came right off the factory floor. Everything is exactly spot-on. It's exactly to an engineer's specifications and it's perfectly clean. It's the best condition that that machine will ever be in right when it comes out of the box. It's also completely useless, right? And so when people you this is that's the fund that's the the fundamentalist side of this. People will get so into education they they'll try to build the mechanics so perfectly right they'll get everything to you know an an engineered precision. Everything's mechanically correct but there's no fuel. There's no energy in it to do anything productive. So it just sits there and dies. And so this is where the the the we'll say the dynamic crowd has a point. You've got to put some energy in there. You've got to have the move of the spirit in your church, in your home, in your personal life, or all you've got is a statue of something that might produce power somewhere, but it's never going to do anything for you until there's a move of the spirit in that &gt;&gt; until you get the spirit moving. &gt;&gt; Um, you know, this is from expectations. um 1953 he said and I said I found two class of people listening in my third time around the world since I've been here and I find two classes of people one of them is the fundamentalists and the other is the Pentecostal and the fundamentalists positionally know their place but they haven't got much faith with it and the Pentecostals have got plenty of faith but don't know who they are just like a man has got a lot of money in the bank and don't know how to write a check and the next man can write a check but ain't got no money in the bank if you can ever Get them together. You have it. If they had only realized who you are, you're sons and daughters of God, heirs of the kingdom. Right now, we are kings. Claim your legal rights. Don't let Satan press anything on you. He's got no rights to hold it. And so, like I said there, you have one group who's mechanically they've got all the kinds of education and they they know the scripture inside and out, but they've got no faith. They've got no spiritual power. They've got no energy fuel to go with that. Right. On the other side um so this is well let me let me just keep uh talk about this for a second. So this is from 1965 the rising of the sun or it is the rising of the sun. Notice they were cowards. Notice but they had the mechanics. See but they were all sitting back in there saying oh I'm afraid of it. I'm afraid to go out and make a claim because oh all them great bishops and things out there. Oh, I'm afraid to them priests and things. I'm afraid to make that claim. Afraid I'll say I believe on him. Oh, I just can't do that. You see, but all of a sudden the dynamics come. Yes. And what did it do? It not only filled their spirit inside, but it quickened their mechanics. Their bodies were quickened. They were no more cowards. And so what what getting the spirit of God in you will do is it'll give you boldness. It'll give you the freedom of the spirit. It'll give you the freedom to say hallelujah in church. It'll give you the freedom to when you know people or the the boldness that to live a Christian life out in the world right on display. It'll give you the boldness that when trials and tribulations come, you have the courage to go face it without, you know, it'll give you the boldness to meet the devil and say, "It is written." &gt;&gt; Right? That's what it'll do. It'll give you the faith to believe that when you do that, the devil will back down. On the other side, um you have the fundamentalists. Now, remember when we read the in the scripture of the staff staff the scripture where it says add to your faith virtue, it also said add to your virtue knowledge. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you just get to the point where you've got a lot of fire and no knowledge, no d no, if all you've got is dynamics, but no mechanics, then you're also going to have a problem, &gt;&gt; right? You can listen, you can get a a throw a match on a gas can, that's all dynamics, and it'll make a boom. It'll make an explosion, but it's not going to produce anything. It's just going to be a light show. on the you know and so you can take you know like I said most problems with a generator are fuel fuel delivery that there's no dynamics in the machine and it it it's struggling to get the fuel that it needs on the other hand you can take a machine that's got great fuel delivery but if the mechanics have been completely neglected right the valves have never been adjusted the air filter's gummed up with all kinds of you know garbage it's never been maintained it's never been cleaned it's never been kept up to date. The the mechanics have been completely neglected. Yeah, it'll make noise. The the engine will ignite. You'll hear, you know, it'll it'll sound like an engine, but it's going to be smoke. It'll be blowing all kinds of smoke. It's going to be backfiring. It's going to be gutless. It'll it'll run as long as you don't ever put a load on it. It'll make noise. But the minute you go turn the lights on, you know, you make it go power up the building, turn the lights on, turn some some machines on, everything dies. The engine was just bogged down and and it's completely gutless. It doesn't actually have any power. It sounds like it has power. It makes noise like it has power. It talks a big game about all the scriptures that it knows about having power. But when it comes time to actually live that life, &gt;&gt; comes time to actually put that into place, it'll say talk a big game about how you just got to say it is written. But when it comes comes time to do that, it doesn't even know the scriptures that it's supposed to be referring to. It doesn't even know what the scripture is written or what is written in the scripture cuz there was the mechanics were completely neglected. That's what that's so you you the question isn't do you need mechanics or dynamics. The question the the answer is you need both. You you have to go down the middle of this road, you know, and it's the same thing. Look, and this goes into so many different aspects. You know, you got fundamentalists who are all so far into church order that nobody can have freedom of the spirit. You got the other group who's in in complete chaos and and people just have no there's no respect to the to the to the sanctity of the sanctuary at all. &gt;&gt; And so, yeah, you got a lot of noise on one side, but that's all it'll ever be. And the other side is so dead that no one ever has the courage to step out on faith and get get healing, you know. But you need both. You got to you listen, you got to be mechanically right. You've got to know the scripture. You've got to have some church order. &gt;&gt; But on the other hand, you can't be so afraid of of damaging your church church order that you never put any fire in the cylinder. &gt;&gt; Right? You got to have both. If you know, look, it doesn't matter how much fuel you put in the car. If the mechanics have been so completely neglected that it's got a, you know, it's it's so fallen apart and you know, you take a car with a busted steering knuckle. The mecha that's mechanical. Steering is mechanical. You'll go flying all over the interstate and crashing into stuff blown around by every wind of false doctrine because you never took the time to maintain the mechanics and know keep yourself lined up. &gt;&gt; Amen. you know, never took the time to, you know, blown into all kinds of besetting sins because you never took the time to put some godly discipline in your life, some fundamental mechanical discipline in your life to to not get drugged off into some into some nonsense, to not go crashing off into some, you know, you know, some some besetting sin. And so what we've got to come to if we really want this the actual dynamo power, real deal power, right? If you want electricity to come out of the generator, you have to have fuel and you have to have clean mechanics. Both of them have to be present. Otherwise, you you will have a loud, noisy, useless thing that looks like a generator. Or you will just have a dead cold thing that looks like a generator, but you'll never have an actual generator, right? There'll be no actual power. But if you can get the two lined up, if you can get if you can if you can read the, you know, get in the word while also maintaining that relationship with Christ. Notice what you know, brother Brandham said. If you want to have a closer walk with God, the two things, there's two things you have to do. Read your Bible mechanics and pray. There's your dynamics every single day. Put the two together. You've got to have a prayer life. You've got to have a disciplined life in the scripture. You've got to have both. If you can do both, you'll actually do something, right? Look, if the day of Pentecost, right, and they came out of there saying men and brethren, and this is that which you saw the prophet Joel wrote about. If and there were cloven, you know, tongues of fire and all these things. If that's all that ever happened, then that what would have been the point? That's not the the goal wasn't so they could have a big a big energetic church meeting that got everyone jumping up and down. The goal was so that one day Peter could say, "Tell a man, silver and gold have I none. Rise up and walk." That was the goal, right? the and so our in our lives and our Christian experience the goal isn't to have a big fancy church or you know some some nice clean church where everyone knows their place and knows what to do and we have great church order and the goal also isn't to have some dynamic church where everyone jumps up and down and and and cries and speaks in tongues every service. The goal is that you can go out into the world and live a Christian life out there. If it all if everything stays inside these walls, then what was the point? &gt;&gt; Right? you. We've got to be able to go do something productive. We got to be able to take the message isn't supposed to just help you be a better Christ, you know, uh help you be a better message believer. We'll put it like that. It's not just supposed to help you be um aesthetically Christian. It's supposed to go into your relationships and your lives and your families and actually do something. It's supposed to help you raise your children better. It's supposed to help you um you know in and be a light to the world. &gt;&gt; That's what the wheels turning looks like. Anyhow, that's kind of where we got to quit because I'm out of time. We'll we'll let's stand and have a word of prayer to close up. Precious Father, Lord, we thank you for this this service, the Sunday school. Hopefully, something was said. Father, I put I put put my faith in you that something might have been um something might have been helpful to the people. Maybe they could have taken something that was said and not not looked at me, Father, for I'm I'm a failure so many times. I'm a I am by no means am I a perfect example, Father. But Lord, I hold to your faith to hold to your to your example. hold to your put trust in your word that you father you could be your own advocate that you would be it'd be your life father that you'd be your word speaking through me father that people could hold to that they'd put their faith in that we ask you' be with us throughout the remaining of the service throughout the day be with us we trust that your spirit will move this morning we put our faith in that we ask ask these things in the name of the allsufficient name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
