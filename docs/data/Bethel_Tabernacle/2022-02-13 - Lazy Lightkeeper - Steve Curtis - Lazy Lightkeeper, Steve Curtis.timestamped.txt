[0:00] clear skies grew black
[0:05] this angry thunder rolled in
[0:11] smashing waves driven
[0:16] by a mad howling wind
[0:19] [Music]
[0:22] one lonely vessel
[0:24] [Music]
[0:27] so close to home
[0:30] [Music]
[0:33] and one frantic captain
[0:38] barely keep in
[0:40] control
[0:41] [Music]
[0:44] the lighthouse on the hill
[0:50] could have ended his plight
[0:56] but its dim beacon's glow
[1:01] hardly cut through
[1:03] the night
[1:07] though he strained he could not see
[1:10] [Music]
[1:13] for the lack of sunlight
[1:16] [Music]
[1:19] he heard the crack of the hole
[1:22] the ship soon was full
[1:24] was the captain's last night
[1:28] [Music]
[1:30] and all to the thanks
[1:36] of lazy light keeper
[1:39] [Music]
[1:42] the fire did burn
[1:47] but it was only
[1:49] within
[1:49] [Music]
[1:53] it did not reach out
[1:58] to the ones that were needy
[2:01] [Music]
[2:04] oh it could not reach
[2:07] [Music]
[2:16] one man a dread
[2:22] all the life's troubled sea
[2:26] [Music]
[2:28] i maintained this lighthouse
[2:33] and it's all up to me
[2:37] [Music]
[2:39] will my beacons shine
[2:43] [Music]
[2:44] through this darkened world of sin
[2:50] or will he like the captain
[2:56] soon see
[2:57] [Music]
[3:01] oh i don't want to be
[3:06] a lazy light keeper
[3:10] [Music]
[3:13] my fire does burn
[3:18] but is it only within
[3:24] will it reach out
[3:29] to the ones that are needy
[3:32] [Music]
[3:33] [Applause]
[3:35] oh can it reach out
[3:40] or is there soon on my lid
[3:46] oh can it reach out
[3:48] [Music]
[3:51] or is there soot on my
[3:55] lid
[3:57] [Music]
[4:04] you
