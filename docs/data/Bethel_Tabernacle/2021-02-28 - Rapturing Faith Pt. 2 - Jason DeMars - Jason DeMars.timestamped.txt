[0:00] gracious heavenly father we just come to
[0:02] you lord and we're so thankful for your
[0:04] word
[0:04] we ask that you bless this study this
[0:07] morning
[0:08] that you would speak to us speak through
[0:11] us lord and
[0:12] that your name would be lifted up and
[0:14] glorified lord lord
[0:16] just ask your blessing upon the the
[0:18] whole day the service the worship
[0:20] the preaching of the word ask that you
[0:23] would come and deal with hearts lord and
[0:27] heal the sick and afflicted and touch
[0:30] touch bodies and minds lord we ask you
[0:32] in jesus name
[0:33] amen while you're standing let's look
[0:37] at ii timothy chapter 4
[0:40] and verse 7.
[0:44] we're going to talk about christian
[0:45] character part 13
[0:48] and i'm entitling this character
[0:52] characteristic of a believer grit
[0:56] so i know we don't find that word in the
[0:59] bible but i think we find that
[1:01] characteristic in the bible and spoken
[1:04] of in a different way but
[1:05] ii timothy 4 7 i have fought a good
[1:08] fight
[1:10] i have finished my course i have kept
[1:13] the faith may the lord add the blessing
[1:15] to the reading of the word you can be
[1:17] seated
[1:20] grit is a positive trait
[1:25] based on an individual's perseverance of
[1:29] effort combined with passion for a
[1:32] particular
[1:33] long-term goal or purpose
[1:38] another way to describe grit would be
[1:39] determination to fulfill your god-given
[1:42] purpose
[1:43] regardless of the obstacles you face
[1:46] there's no discouragement fainting
[1:49] or giving up for a christmas for a
[1:52] christian amen
[1:53] sure there's things that happen that are
[1:55] discouraging there's
[1:56] sure there's things that happen that
[1:58] cause us to faint
[2:00] but none of that causes us a real
[2:02] believer to give up
[2:06] we go through all kinds of ups and downs
[2:08] and hills and valleys and
[2:10] emotions that are high emotions that are
[2:13] low that comes along with being human
[2:16] but for a christian none of that
[2:19] would impact what what what our choices
[2:22] are
[2:23] in our walk with god matthew 10 verse 22
[2:30] and you shall be hated of all men for my
[2:34] name's sake
[2:35] but he that endureth to the end shall be
[2:38] saved
[2:39] this was jesus sending his disciples on
[2:42] a missionary
[2:43] trip so just imagine you're being
[2:46] instructed
[2:47] you're going on a missionary trip i want
[2:49] you to know you're going to be hated by
[2:50] everyone
[2:57] you can be hated by everyone but the one
[2:59] that endures
[3:00] to the end will be saved endurance
[3:04] that's important that's that's a
[3:06] character trait
[3:07] of a real believer put in to you
[3:11] by the spirit of god
[3:14] what people on the outside do to you say
[3:16] to you
[3:17] how you're treated
[3:21] could come from people that you highly
[3:23] regard and respect
[3:25] none of that matters to you the one
[3:28] thing that matters
[3:30] is your heart with god
[3:33] outside of that how people respond how
[3:35] people will react
[3:36] that's in their that's in their court as
[3:39] we talked about before part of this
[3:41] grit and endurance is the other
[3:44] characteristics
[3:45] love patience
[3:48] forgiveness perseverance
[3:52] through all of these things let's look
[3:54] at some examples of
[3:56] grit acts 5
[3:59] 17-29 it's a lot of verses to read but
[4:02] i think i want to get the picture for
[4:04] for all of us
[4:07] then the high priest rose up and all
[4:08] they that were with him which is the
[4:10] sect of the sadducees
[4:12] and were filled with indignation man
[4:15] the apostles said something that made
[4:18] them so
[4:19] angry and laid their hands on the
[4:23] apostles and put them in common prison
[4:26] but the angel of the lord by night
[4:28] opened the prison doors and brought them
[4:29] forth
[4:30] and said run into the wilderness and
[4:33] hide
[4:35] go stand and speak in the temple to the
[4:38] people
[4:39] all the words of this life
[4:42] and they're like but they're the
[4:45] one ones that put me in
[4:48] jail no go and stand
[4:52] there in the temple and when they heard
[4:54] that when they heard that
[4:56] no they didn't run away no they didn't
[4:58] hide when they heard that
[5:00] they entered into the temple early
[5:03] in the morning and taught but the high
[5:06] priest came and they that were with them
[5:07] and called the council together and all
[5:08] the senate of the children
[5:10] the sanhedrin of the children of israel
[5:12] and sent to the prison to have them
[5:14] brought out
[5:16] but when the officers came and found
[5:18] them not in the prison they returned and
[5:20] told saying
[5:21] the prison truly found we shut with all
[5:23] safety
[5:24] and the keepers standing without before
[5:26] the doors but when we had opened
[5:28] we found no man within now when the high
[5:31] priest and the captain of the temple and
[5:33] the chief priests heard these things
[5:35] they doubted of them where unto this
[5:37] would grow
[5:38] amen then came one and told them saying
[5:40] behold the men whom you put in prison
[5:42] are standing
[5:43] in the temple and teaching the people
[5:47] that's grit
[5:50] then when went the captain with the
[5:52] officers and brought them without
[5:53] violence
[5:54] for they feared the people lest they
[5:57] should have been
[5:59] stoned somebody's fearing the people
[6:02] somebody's not fearing the people
[6:06] and one of them is serving god and one
[6:08] of them is not
[6:09] serving god
[6:13] and when they had brought them they set
[6:15] them before the council and the high
[6:17] priest
[6:18] asked them saying didn't did we not
[6:20] straightly
[6:22] we were pretty clear command you that
[6:25] you should not teach in this name and
[6:26] behold
[6:27] you have filled jerusalem with your
[6:30] doctrine and to
[6:31] intend to bring this man's blood
[6:34] upon us then peter and the other
[6:37] apostles answered and said
[6:38] we ought to obey god rather than
[6:42] men now that is grit that is
[6:45] determination to do
[6:47] exactly what god has purposed and called
[6:50] you to do regardless
[6:52] of the circumstances and i believe
[6:54] there's something
[6:56] in a christian that really grasped this
[7:00] because jesus was the same
[7:03] john 2 23-25
[7:07] now when he was in jerusalem at the
[7:09] passover in the feast day
[7:11] many believed in his name when they saw
[7:14] the miracles which he did
[7:17] now look at this but jesus did not
[7:20] commit himself
[7:21] unto them because he knew
[7:24] all men and needed not that any should
[7:27] testify of man
[7:29] for he knew what was in man what does
[7:33] that mean
[7:34] because the reality is in the big
[7:36] picture jesus was calling men
[7:40] who were supposed to be fishers of men
[7:42] right they were supposed to tell
[7:43] other people about him
[7:47] so it's not that he wasn't going to have
[7:50] people testify
[7:52] about him it's something deeper than
[7:54] that
[7:55] and i think it's something that we need
[7:57] to have and that's an understanding that
[7:59] my sufficiency
[8:02] comes from my relationship with god
[8:05] not with what other people say about me
[8:09] or think about me or what i think other
[8:11] people think
[8:13] about me my sufficiency
[8:16] comes from god alone
[8:20] and you know jesus
[8:23] loved these people it's not that he
[8:26] didn't he's not saying
[8:27] well he just hated him and disregarded
[8:28] him he had compassion upon them
[8:31] he loved them he lived for these people
[8:35] but he knew i cannot say oh they're
[8:38] believing on me i'm so excited
[8:40] this is amazing everybody testify i'm
[8:42] gonna be
[8:44] no he wasn't going about it that way i
[8:45] don't need anyone
[8:47] to testify of me i simply
[8:51] my job is to obey my father
[8:54] what does he say all through the book of
[8:55] john my meat my food
[8:58] is to do my father's will and accomplish
[9:01] his
[9:02] purpose my food isn't the adulation of
[9:04] the people
[9:06] my food isn't getting pats on the back
[9:08] good job nice
[9:09] nice sermon nice healing
[9:12] that's not that wasn't his food his food
[9:14] was to do his father's will
[9:16] and accomplish his purpose and that is
[9:18] that is for us
[9:20] that is our job our job is not to get
[9:23] pats on the back
[9:25] and get good comments nice sermon our
[9:28] job
[9:29] is to accomplish our father's will
[9:32] regardless of how people respond
[9:35] regardless
[9:36] of what their attitude is about what
[9:38] we've said or done
[9:40] our job is to please him so jesus did
[9:42] not commit himself unto them
[9:44] because he knew it was in man someone
[9:47] that can be your best friend one minute
[9:49] can turn around and be what stab you in
[9:51] the back
[9:53] does it hurt absolutely should it change
[9:56] what we're doing
[9:58] as long as we're doing the father's will
[10:00] it should not change what we're doing
[10:02] we should continue to walk in obedience
[10:04] regardless
[10:06] from the sermon melchizedek the great
[10:08] prince and king in 1955
[10:10] brother branham says whether it's
[10:11] popularity whether it's our church
[10:14] whether it's our friends our associate
[10:16] associates whatever it may be whether
[10:19] whether it's our doctor whether it's our
[10:20] priest whether it's our preacher
[10:22] all other grounds is sinking sands
[10:26] christ alone and every man that's ever
[10:29] amounted to anything
[10:31] in this great battlefield of strife has
[10:33] been men
[10:34] and women i like that he put not just
[10:36] men men
[10:37] and women who stood alone on them
[10:41] convictions when everything else failed
[10:44] and fell around them they stood still
[10:47] abraham lincoln of old was convinced
[10:50] that he was right
[10:51] he stood alone on his conviction but he
[10:53] proved it and sealed his testimony with
[10:54] his own blood
[10:56] jesus christ stood alone in his day as
[10:58] an example that every man
[11:00] upon his convictions of god's eternal
[11:02] truth that will take him
[11:04] his stand positionally and stand will
[11:06] stand alone
[11:07] but not alone with god the invisible
[11:10] companion who follows us through life's
[11:12] journey down through the shadows
[11:14] of the valleys of the shadows of death
[11:16] and into eternity he'll still go with us
[11:19] and be god i love that
[11:23] every man that's ever amounted to
[11:26] anything in this
[11:27] great battlefield of strife has been men
[11:29] and women who stood
[11:30] alone on them convictions and that's
[11:34] what our heart needs to be
[11:37] we need to know who we are know what god
[11:40] has called us to
[11:42] know his word and take our stand
[11:46] and if the whole world turns against us
[11:48] we have to know
[11:50] i prayed god spoke
[11:53] i acted the rest is in his hands
[11:57] i'm not going to stop i'm going to keep
[11:59] going forward
[12:02] james 1 verse 12
[12:07] blessed is the man that endures
[12:09] temptation
[12:11] for when he has tried he shall receive
[12:13] the crown of life which the lord
[12:15] has promised to them that love him
[12:19] we go through a lot of things
[12:22] in this life we go through a lot of
[12:26] trials
[12:27] we go through a lot of things that are
[12:29] painful that hurt
[12:31] that challenge our faith in god
[12:35] amen and that's normal it's not
[12:38] something we should be
[12:39] surprised about isn't that what the
[12:42] apostle says
[12:43] we shouldn't be surprised by the fiery
[12:45] trial which tries us
[12:47] all these things are to be absolutely
[12:50] expected
[12:51] in our christian walk amen
[12:54] and what is it blessed is the man that
[12:56] endures
[12:58] temptation or trials
[13:01] why because we'll receive the crown of
[13:04] life
[13:06] brother branham in jesus christ the same
[13:09] yesterday today and forever in 1955
[13:12] again
[13:12] says did you ever come to think of it
[13:15] that
[13:16] most men who ever do anything great for
[13:18] the kingdom of god stand alone
[13:20] did you ever think of it you have to
[13:22] stand by yourself
[13:23] jesus stood alone and all down through
[13:25] the ages other men
[13:27] who stood alone finney sankey calvin
[13:29] knox even to abraham lincoln that's
[13:31] right stood alone
[13:32] men who do great things men of vision
[13:35] men of spiritual understanding stand
[13:37] alone
[13:37] and i think that's because that jesus
[13:40] had to stand alone
[13:42] himself now
[13:45] all of these that are spoken of it
[13:46] doesn't mean that they didn't have
[13:48] friends around them but it was a
[13:51] disposition
[13:52] of their heart towards what the whole
[13:56] the trend of the world was saying or the
[13:59] religious trend of the day
[14:01] was saying they were willing to say
[14:04] this is right and if all hell comes
[14:08] against me the whole world comes against
[14:09] me
[14:10] i'm standing on my convictions no matter
[14:14] what
[14:16] and then people supported them and and
[14:18] helped them and stood by them
[14:20] but they weren't doing it because people
[14:22] were standing by them they were doing it
[14:24] because it was right
[14:25] and i think that's the point that
[14:27] brother branham's trying to make is you
[14:29] stand alone
[14:30] and truly the fact is we all stand alone
[14:35] with god whether we think that way
[14:38] or not what other people around us
[14:42] believe or think or do we're not going
[14:45] to answer for that
[14:46] we answer for ourselves in the sight of
[14:48] god
[14:49] amen first corinthians 16
[14:53] verse 13.
[15:00] watchy stand fast in the faith
[15:04] quit you like men be strong
[15:08] now this verse that says quit you like
[15:10] men it is not just
[15:12] written to men
[15:15] it's also written to sisters because
[15:18] it's written to the saints
[15:21] in corinth which consists of men
[15:24] and women so he's what does that mean
[15:27] quit you like men we obviously don't
[15:30] speak like that
[15:32] in today's vernacular what does it
[15:34] literally mean
[15:36] it means to act manly
[15:40] so sisters act manly
[15:46] brothers you two act manly that doesn't
[15:49] mean
[15:49] in the sense of 21st century
[15:53] modern nonsense what does it mean it
[15:56] means to take a stand
[15:59] to be strong to take the
[16:02] hits and the punches that the world
[16:04] gives and punch back with the word
[16:07] take your stand punch back with god's
[16:10] character god's love
[16:12] god's truth and don't give up don't be
[16:15] weak be strong sisters
[16:18] be manly
[16:22] in christ is the mystery of god revealed
[16:24] brother branham says this
[16:26] what happened in the pre-figure now he
[16:28] opened adam's side and took part of his
[16:30] flesh which was adam to make eve
[16:32] the bride has to be the word for he is
[16:34] the word she cannot stand on creed she
[16:36] cannot stand on denomination
[16:38] she cannot stand on good behavior she
[16:40] has to stand
[16:42] alone on the word because she is part of
[16:44] it
[16:45] she was taken from christ that's each of
[16:48] us
[16:50] each of us men you're referred to as a
[16:52] woman
[16:54] a bride right and what do we do we have
[16:57] to stand
[16:58] alone on the word so bride
[17:03] be manly amen
[17:07] take that stand stand alone if you have
[17:09] to
[17:12] in perfect faith brother branham says
[17:14] but jesus lived in a world
[17:16] that no one knowed about he was an odd
[17:18] person he lived in a world of perfect
[17:20] faith and the perfect god in which he
[17:22] was
[17:23] if we lived in a perfect faith of a
[17:25] christian to what we are we'd be a
[17:27] mystic to the world
[17:28] the people wouldn't understand you you'd
[17:31] walk in the spirit
[17:32] what the spirit said you would do what
[17:34] it forbid you would not do
[17:36] then the people people can begin to say
[17:38] you'd be a mystic
[17:40] person to them that's the way it is to
[17:43] all believers they're a mystic
[17:44] the people don't understand because they
[17:46] live in a world to themselves
[17:49] jesus lived in a world that nobody else
[17:51] could touch
[17:52] the disciples couldn't understand him
[17:53] when he spoke to them they say this
[17:55] and then they say why are you talking
[17:57] riddle riddles we don't understand this
[17:58] how can this be see
[18:00] they wasn't in the world that he lived
[18:02] in see they couldn't understand him
[18:03] nobody could understand him
[18:05] and so when a man lives by faith and
[18:08] walks by faith i mean substance faith
[18:11] he is isolated from the entire world and
[18:14] becomes a new
[18:15] creature in christ there now you're
[18:18] getting into bride material see
[18:21] you're getting into rapturing condition
[18:22] now that means for each one of us
[18:24] not just the pastor deacon's trustees
[18:27] that means for the laity every
[18:28] individual walks
[18:29] in a world alone with god alone
[18:33] you're baptized into this kingdom and
[18:34] there's nobody in there but you
[18:36] and god he gives the orders and you pack
[18:39] them out
[18:40] whatever he says there's not a shadow of
[18:42] doubt nowhere you walk right in
[18:44] if the lord says this there's nobody in
[18:45] the world can talk you out of it
[18:47] you go right on just the same now you're
[18:50] coming into perfect faith
[18:52] perfect perfection that cannot fail that
[18:55] faith never fails yes
[18:57] he was a mystic to them with his perfect
[18:59] faith and so
[19:01] is it now with those who have perfect
[19:03] faith
[19:04] are a mystic to others amen
[19:08] now that doesn't mean we're supposed to
[19:10] go out and act like we're insane
[19:13] it doesn't mean we're supposed to act
[19:15] crazy it
[19:16] what does it mean it means that you and
[19:19] it does also doesn't mean that we're not
[19:20] a part of a body
[19:22] of christ right it's not
[19:25] he's not taking away from any of those
[19:27] things at all
[19:28] what is he saying it's that's what our
[19:31] disposition is
[19:32] i'm not saying well what is brother
[19:34] charles doing oh if brother charles do
[19:36] that then i'll do it
[19:38] well brother brother jason does it
[19:41] pastor
[19:41] does it and says to do it no i'm not
[19:43] packing orders
[19:46] from a man that's not what he's saying
[19:48] about it
[19:49] every believer every believer
[19:53] pac walks into the presence of god and
[19:55] packs their orders out
[19:57] right each one of us have to do that and
[19:59] if we do that
[20:01] what happens we start to walk in harmony
[20:05] but when we are getting our own orders
[20:07] and looking around
[20:08] what am i supposed to be doing so-and-so
[20:10] is doing this this one's doing that
[20:12] that's when confusion and disunity comes
[20:15] disunity doesn't come from us being a
[20:18] mystic walking in a world
[20:19] alone with god that's where true unity
[20:23] comes from god loves unity
[20:27] but not babylon unity
[20:30] not unity on a human level worked out
[20:34] by humans for humans but unity
[20:37] with every one of our hearts unified
[20:40] with him
[20:42] and that we will obey him regardless of
[20:44] what anyone around us is doing
[20:47] now we're talking about real unity
[20:50] in the body of christ
[20:55] second corinthians 11.
[20:59] i'm going to read about the apostle paul
[21:02] we read that
[21:03] scripture to start with i have fought a
[21:05] good fight finished my course
[21:07] kept the faith paul in
[21:11] second corinthians speaks about what he
[21:14] went through
[21:15] and i doubt any of us
[21:18] have or ever will go through what he
[21:20] went through
[21:22] but i want you to see the picture
[21:25] of his endurance of his grit
[21:29] second corinthians 11 23 are they
[21:32] servants of christ
[21:33] and i'm reading from the esb because
[21:36] some of the
[21:37] the the descriptions uh are difficult to
[21:40] understand in the
[21:41] kjv are they servants of christ
[21:45] i'm a better one i'm talking like a
[21:47] madman
[21:49] with far greater labors far more
[21:51] imprisonments
[21:52] with countless beatings and often near
[21:54] death
[21:55] five times i received at the hands of
[21:57] the jews the forty lashes less one
[22:00] three times i was beaten with rods once
[22:02] i was stoned
[22:04] three times i was shipwrecked a night
[22:06] and a day i was adrift at sea
[22:09] on frequent journeys in dangers from
[22:11] rivers danger from robbers danger from
[22:13] my own people
[22:14] danger from gentiles dangers danger in
[22:17] the city
[22:17] danger in the wilderness danger at sea
[22:20] danger from false brothers
[22:22] in toil and hardships through many a
[22:24] sleepless night
[22:25] in hunger and thirst often without food
[22:28] in cold and exposure
[22:30] and apart from other things there was
[22:32] there's the daily pressure on me of the
[22:34] my anxiety for all the churches who is
[22:37] weak and i'm not weak
[22:39] who is made to fall and i am not
[22:40] indignant if i must boast i will boast
[22:43] of the things that show my weakness
[22:45] the god and father of the lord jesus who
[22:47] is blessed forever knows i'm not lying
[22:50] at damascus the governor under king
[22:52] aritis was guarding
[22:54] the city of damascus in order to seize
[22:55] me but i was let down in a basket
[22:57] through a window in the wall and escaped
[22:59] his hands
[23:00] i must go on boasting though there is
[23:03] nothing to be gained by it i will go on
[23:05] to visions and revelations of the lord i
[23:08] know a man in christ who 14 years ago
[23:10] was caught up to the third heaven
[23:11] whether in
[23:12] the body or out of the body i do not
[23:13] know god knows and i know that this man
[23:16] was caught up into paradise whether in
[23:18] the body or out of the body i do not
[23:19] know god knows
[23:21] and he heard things that cannot be told
[23:22] which man may not utter on behalf of
[23:24] this man i will boast but on my own
[23:26] behalf
[23:27] i will not boast except of my weaknesses
[23:29] though if i should wish to boast i would
[23:31] not be a fool for i would be speaking
[23:33] the truth
[23:34] but i refrain from it so that no one may
[23:36] think more of me
[23:37] than he sees in me and hears from me so
[23:39] to keep me from becoming conceited
[23:41] because of the surpassing greatness of
[23:43] the revelations a thorn was given me in
[23:45] the flesh
[23:46] a messenger of satan to harass me to
[23:48] keep me from becoming
[23:50] conceited three times i pleaded with the
[23:52] lord about this that it should leave me
[23:54] but he said to me my grace is sufficient
[23:56] for you for my power is made perfect in
[23:58] weakness
[23:59] therefore i will boast all the more
[24:01] gladly of my weaknesses so that the
[24:04] power of christ
[24:05] may rest upon me for the sake of christ
[24:08] then i am content with weaknesses
[24:11] insults hardships persecutions and
[24:13] calamities
[24:15] for when i am weak then i
[24:18] am strong
[24:21] so he writes to timothy in second
[24:23] timothy two verse three
[24:24] thou therefore endure hardship hardness
[24:28] undergo hardship or endure inflictions
[24:31] as a good soldier of jesus christ
[24:35] those were words written by someone who
[24:38] do you imagine all those calamities
[24:41] that he went through that happened to
[24:43] him and he didn't say
[24:45] well i must be on the wrong path i mean
[24:48] god's not blessing
[24:49] me my life so i really must be
[24:53] out of the will of god he said all of
[24:55] this can be expected
[24:56] and more and i'm not going to quit i'm
[24:59] going to keep going
[25:00] no matter what i'm going to keep
[25:01] following the voice of god in my life
[25:04] i'm going to keep speaking the truth i'm
[25:06] going to keep doing
[25:07] what i'm supposed to do what did he do
[25:09] when he went on his way to jerusalem
[25:12] every city he went to they prophesied
[25:14] they're going to put you in
[25:16] chains and deliver you over to rome
[25:20] and he says why are you trying to break
[25:21] my heart
[25:24] because they're crying they're crying
[25:26] and they're broke up we won't we won't
[25:27] see you ever again and so forth
[25:30] why are you trying to break my heart i'm
[25:31] ready to die
[25:33] for the name of the lord jesus i don't
[25:35] count my life as anything
[25:38] that's that is the walk of a christian
[25:41] that is not
[25:42] an exceptional christian i don't want
[25:45] you to think like that
[25:46] paul was an exceptional christian we can
[25:48] never
[25:50] have that heart and attitude no you are
[25:51] not going to have the same ministry as
[25:52] paul
[25:53] or brother branham or martin luther or
[25:55] whatever
[25:56] absolutely not those are different
[25:58] ministries in the body of christ
[26:00] that's not the point the point is his
[26:02] heart
[26:03] as a believer should be the heart of
[26:06] every believer
[26:08] we need to wrestle with these things am
[26:11] i willing to do everything
[26:13] it takes and lose everything and my life
[26:16] also in this walk with christ
[26:19] that should already be dealt with that
[26:21] that should be answered a long time ago
[26:24] for me to live as christ and to die is
[26:27] gain
[26:28] amen does that make you go
[26:31] i hope not if it does wrestle with it
[26:35] wrestle with it in prayer in your heart
[26:38] because it is
[26:38] it is a truth we
[26:42] have to be determined to do the will of
[26:45] god regardless of the opposition
[26:48] that we face when we're not supposed to
[26:50] be
[26:51] chocolate soldiers that melt under the
[26:53] pressure
[26:55] we're supposed to be strong full of grit
[26:59] determined to do what god
[27:03] would have us to do whether it means the
[27:06] destruction of our body
[27:08] or our lives our finances whatever it
[27:11] might be
[27:12] that god calls us to do we need to be
[27:15] willing to do that even if the whole
[27:18] world says you're crazy
[27:20] amen amen let's stand and pray
[27:28] heavenly father as i think of those
[27:30] words and read of the life
[27:32] and the experiences of
[27:35] paul the apostle his words that
[27:39] in one of his last letters that he ever
[27:40] wrote to his
[27:42] dear son in the faith timothy
[27:47] told him to endure
[27:51] hardship as a good soldier of jesus
[27:53] christ and
[27:55] told timothy that he had fought a good
[27:58] fight
[27:59] he'd finished his course he had kept the
[28:02] faith lord i think that's what
[28:05] every one of us need to be in that
[28:08] condition
[28:12] this world is full of
[28:16] demonic forces trying to block us and
[28:19] stop us and derail us from being
[28:21] obedient
[28:22] to you lord so we ask father that you
[28:26] would help and strengthen
[28:29] and empower us to have this genuine
[28:33] grit of a christian that we see
[28:36] our our goal and our purpose of our life
[28:40] and that
[28:41] we will let nothing derail us from that
[28:45] commit each one to you lord for your
[28:47] glory we ask it in the name of jesus
[28:48] christ
[28:49] amen god bless you
[28:57] [Music]
[29:00] you
