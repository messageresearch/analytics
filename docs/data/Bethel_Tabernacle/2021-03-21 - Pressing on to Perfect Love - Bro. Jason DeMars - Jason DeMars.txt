so glad you came from the earth lord amen hallelujah thank you lord man amen god is so good let's uh let's turn to romans chapter 12 verses 9 and 10. this is from a sunday school that i did on love and friendship a while a while ago that brother jason wanted me to to repeat in a regular service and so some of you might have seen me preach at when i was visiting other churches so maybe this is the third time fourth time you've heard it well it's like the eighth time i've preached it and i'm going to confess i still need to hear it so if you've heard it multiple times it'll probably come out a little different as it does every time but i think i still need it we still need it so we're still here so amen talking about pressing on to perfect love romans 12 9 and 10 let love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affection one to another with brotherly love in honor preferring one another amen let's pray heavenly father we just come to your lord and we're so thankful for your beautiful word we're so thankful for the spirit of god that dwells within us by the baptism of the holy ghost and the new birth lord and that spirit which guides us into all truth so lord would you come and and be our teacher today would you come and dwell within us lord and and speak to us in a mighty way lord and and deal with our hearts in a mighty way lord we thank you so much for all the good gifts that you give to us lord and in the form of the people that are amongst us lord and the singing and the musicians and the specials lord we're we're so blessed we we thank you lord and we ask that you would be glorified and your name would be lifted up we ask in jesus name amen god bless you can be seated so let love be without dissimulation let it be without hypocrisy so it's not a it's not a fake love that paul is calling for he's calling for a genuine thing from the heart not something that has a put on not something that's a show but this something that's the same at home and at the church and at the office and on the street something that's genuine real from the heart not because you have to but because god has put it inside of you then he says in in this thank you brother tony abhor that which is evil and cleave to that which is good isn't it strange he says let love be without dissimulation hate what is evil cleave hold on to what is good so how does that work we have to have love and we have to hate evil at the same time how does it work we have a god who is full of love full of compassion we have a god who loves even even the sinner he provides for their needs he does good to them he's merciful to them and at the same time he hates what they're doing or even says he hates the workers of iniquity amen but he provides for their needs he's good to them his mercy endures long and suffers long in other words he's offering something to them over and over and over and over and over again and he still doesn't condemn he's slow to anger so how can we do that because the god that does that lives inside of us cleave to that which is good it's like grab a hold of it and hold on to it with all your might be kindly affection one to another with brotherly love be kindly affection we'll talk about that more later i don't want to go into that that's that's going to be connected to something else so this is from adoption 1960. brother banham says thus saith the lord so we should stop and go okay i'm listening this is not brother branham speaking this is god speaking it'll take perfect love to put you in that place for that's all there was there no matter what money how much religious demonstrations how many good deeds you've done or whatever you've done that won't count nothing on that day it'll take perfect love so whatever you do you lay aside everything else until you're just so filled with the love of god till you can love those who hate you wow perfect love not just the ones that are nice to you that fit the mold of being a correct message believer but everybody the rotten ones the filthy ones the ones that get on your nerves everyone the ones that despise you that speak your name as a curse word you're supposed to love those ones too your heart and attitude shouldn't change between them the world that we live in and even christians are constantly trying to redefine what love is of course this world order this world system has totally perverted it it simply means lust it's a feeling it's an emotion but it's way light years beyond that it's completely different from that you can there there's emotions that come with love there's things that follow love but they are not love they're just outworkings of love in the new testament there's four different words that are used for love one is storge which means family love one is filio which means brotherly or friendship love there's eros which is love between a couple passion and then there's agape which is unconditional love so when i was i just want to share a testimony i was working at u.s bank in in minnesota and i just to give you a picture of let love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good um so you can understand what it means to to be strongly opposed to something and yet still love that person and it's not because it's me it's not because it's me it's because this is what the lord did in this person's life in my life i probably more than anything but i was working with a homosexual guy and he was just out in the open just um talking about it and so forth and when i was there working with him we worked in a it was one of those grocery store branches so it's small everyone knows everything about everyone's life kind of places and so one one day i think it was on a saturday just the two of us were there working the teller line and opening accounts and so forth and we were talking and of course he knew my testimony he knew what i believed and we were talking about why the trinity was false and we were talking about denominations and uh he was really actually enjoying the conversation and then uh we started he started talking about his life and i just mentioned i said well as a bible-believing christian i'm sure you're aware of what my understanding of homosexuality is that's it's a sin it's it's not something that's it's not right he's like well i know that and he said i've been to i've been to a catholic um priest to be have an exorcism and i've been to a pentecostal charismatic church and he's like nothing none of that stuff worked and i just said well have you ever been to jesus have you ever come to him wow and he got kind of got shocked for a second and i said look i you know you know that i believe that what you're doing is wrong and it's a sin but you also know that i love you and i care about you and and i said god god can deliver you the question is is it coming to jason or the priest or the pentecostal uh evangelist that's not going to save you it's coming to jesus christ he's the one that can change your change your life well this conversation ended he appreciated he was he was grateful for me pointing him in the right direction i don't know whatever happened to him but later on we had an atheist that worked in this this branch also he really hated me and he was always trying to fight with me he was always trying to to stir up something and then he would talk behind my back to the other employees well he was doing that to this homosexual man and the homosexual man tells me well he tells this guy you are you cannot speak like to jason about jason like that in front of me and he's like why not you're you're you're homosexual he said jason is the most tolerant person i have ever met and i thought what in the world i told the guy it's a sin and you're going to hell if you continue in sin and yet he could see beyond that that i cared about his soul his heart and i think that's what that is not me i'm not trying to lift myself up because i've i could tell you about all the times i've failed too but in this circumstance the lord was gracious to me and allowed me to be a testimony to to this man and i think that's that's what the lord wants us to be he wants us to be a presence of truth but overarching love so that once someone comes into your presence like we talked about creating an atmosphere you're a little elohim you're a little god an amateur god there should be a supernatural atmosphere of love permeating from your life from your family so that other people walk into it and they're brought to tears because of it because they don't see that another place love that's that's what it should be not that this guy's always rebuking me every time i see him it might be that too sometimes people are angry with god and they just come around you and they can't stand it you never rebuked him you're just living a godly life and it rebukes them so there's all these responses but overarching they should know that person loves me not that we're rebuking him all the time that person hates me there could be rebukes absolutely i gave the man the homosexual man a rebuke but that's not how he received it because there was something behind that that went to his heart amen love is not find its source in emotions emotions change right emotions are like this all of us probably went like this this week and then and then and then maybe maybe you were just like no brother jason i was just like this really low the whole week brother luther is really on the top level cloud nine every time i see him text him talk to him but someday he might go down just a little bit and when you go down just a little bit you'll need this message brother luther but our emotions they get weaker they get stronger they ebb they flow in marriage which one of you has always 100 of the time had butterflies in your heart for your wife if you raise your hand or your husband if you raise your hand i won't say what you are the fact is we get upset we get frustrated people do things we don't like and it wrangle wrangles our feathers and that is where real love comes and it has to be there in our hearts romans 5 verse 5 brother gideon it cannot be merely an emotion because love is not merely an emotion true love both filio and agape are not merely emotions there's something deeper there romans 5 verse 5 and hope maketh not ashamed because the love the agape of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us our love for one another finds its source in the love of god that's been placed within us by what by the baptism of the holy ghost the true and genuine baptism of the holy ghost not just merely an anointing but the real thing the agape of god is placed in our hearts so now when you have the holy ghost you're a candidate to grow into perfect love this word shed abroad there means to to pour forth to gush out to run greedily out so this is the love of god it's poured into us as a vessel and then how does it get to other people it just spills out because it's just pouring and pouring and pouring into us and it's gushing over and it's getting on other people first thessalonians 3 verse 12 and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all men even as we do towards you so the lord make you increase in other words you have the love of god but we have to grow we have to increase in the love of god you can't just any person that says well i have the love of god what are you talking about i don't need to grow in the love of god i don't have the love of god to start with all of us realize our own weakness that we need or we should if you don't pray that you do but you need each of us need to grow in the love of god increa it has to increase and when it increases what does it need to do abound towards towards one another and toward all men oops not just towards believers not just towards bride everybody who are we supposed to love who's this neighbor that we're supposed to love every single person on planet earth that's our neighbor that we're supposed to love matthew 5 43. you have heard that's been said you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy but i say unto you love your enemies okay all right here was here's what we're supposed to do love your enemies bless them that curse you so people that speak against you that hate you that curse at you what should you do get angry and fight back right bless them in other words god bless you i have heard it said i wouldn't want to say god bless you to that person because of dot dot dot and i get that there's a scripture that says don't someone that has is a false teacher don't even wish them god speed but all things in balance there are circumstances for that but here someone is cursing you and jesus says bless him god bless you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you our heart should not merely be loving people in other words doing nice things for people because they can do it back to us jesus says when you make a feast invite people that cannot pay you back in other words invite people that can't invite you to their feast invite and i'm guilty we invite our friends we write our buddies but what about the people that get on our nerves that frustrate us we should be inviting them pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you when someone's persecuting you what is what is the first thing we want to do clarify our motives and objectives and then what's the second thing we want to do argue with them right that's human nature but what does god want us to do pray pray for them first pray for them next find a way you can do something nice for them and wish them god's blessing upon their life why should we do that brother jason why should we do that that [Music] you may be the children of your father which is in heaven let that sink in for a second do you want to be a child of god then you need to do this this is what your life we understand under the gospel this is not something you're doing in your own power right you're not doing it in your own power this is not just up to you to do it this is what the spirit of god is doing in us not might do amen is doing in us you say it's not doing it in me then you need to get the spirit of god because it will do that in you that you might be the children of your father which is in heaven for he makes his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sends his sends rain on the just and on the unjust in other words god does this too he does good to his enemies too for if you love them which love you what reward have you do do not eat does not even the irs do the same thing oops doesn't even the tax collectors do the same thing and if you salute or the word means welcome if you welcome your brethren only what do you more than others don't even the tax collectors do the same be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect in other words you're called to something higher than pharisees and tax collectors what is that human nature says well i really like being around brother travis i will only invite brother travis to my house that's not scriptural that's not scripture i'm not trying to tell you who to invite to your house i'm just using it as an example what's in your heart what's in what's in your what's in your mind what what is our attitude to to the people that are not good to us we need to welcome and love no matter what in influence 1963 brother branham says reverence we ought to honor one another respect one another as brother sister and love one another with undying love you say well i just can't well just stay here in the presence of god a little longer and then you'll like people too you'll love those who doesn't love you that's real that's a really a good sign of christianity when you can from your heart love those who does not love you love the unlovable from your heart now that gets me we might be able to by wrote say jesus said love those who hate me pray for let's see let's get the list out love pray bless okay do good all right i can but i really this frustrates me these people make me mad no it's it's from your heart brother branham says and that takes it to a whole other level because a lot of these things it's just a reaction that person cut me off that person's driving like a dummy which happens a lot in the low country by the way what is it god's testing us to bring us into perfect love by sending bad drivers our way love he says love the unlovable jesus said if you just do favors for those that do favors for you well the publicans do the same thing but see you must be kind to those who are unkind to you do good for those that would do evil to you always remember that keep that before you that god is watching you remember god was good to you and you were evil to him while you were yet sinners christ died for you and i want to say that doing this it takes a special kind of gift in a life a gift of the holy ghost and it's for all of us it's not just for a few people but it takes something where you need to have a tender heart and a tough skin because people will treat you bad people will treat you wrong people will do things that frustrate you and you can't let that harden your heart towards them but your skin has to be tough otherwise it will destroy you it will put you in it'll put you into sickness it'll put you into bad health it'll make your nerves so bad you can't even hardly function that is not what jesus is talking about just take it and you've got bad nerves and you're sick and you can't even no it's from your heart you do it you overcome from your heart and it's it's not brother branham talks about that that these things should come automatically the dove of the holy ghost it's an oil on the inside cleans it from the inside out we don't need to go to church and get re-baptized every week because we messed up we don't need to go clean ourselves with some external thing but the holy ghost inside of us is working in us so that these things are an automatic reaction instead of the opposite one i think that's the beauty of what brother branham is talking about this is not an outward show it's not love with dissimulation it's love without dissimulation that comes from our heart so this is like this is like a really good barometer is when people treat you bad how do you respond it does it tear you up yeah that tears me up sure i get nervous i get tore up and i say lord what do you how do you want me to respond to this and he just reminds me of the same thing every single time when you were in turkey and they were trying to destroy your character what did i tell you to do okay lord when i came back and i was depressed i could barely function i thought everything was ruined you you told you showed me the psalm that says my enemies have gathered together they're round about me but i've given myself to prayer oh wow okay lord i'll give myself to prayer then i turn and look and and see what the quote of the day was and brother branham is saying sometimes you'll reach a place that you hit hit the wall there's no place to go it says don't run this way don't go that way don't try to go over it keep walking and god will make a way right through it and i just thought oh my good okay lord i just keep walking you'll you'll you'll take care of the rest lord give us that heart that's not always my reaction but it's always what the holy spirit reminds me of over and over and over again let's not defend ourselves we're not here to defend jason to mars we're not here to defend our own personal standing our own personal way we're not here to hire an image consultant we are here to reflect the image of jesus christ and it's his glory that we're working for and if people spit on us and hate us that they have to deal with that they have to deal with that it's up to us to say father we forgive you we forgive them forgive them um in the sermon living dying buried rising coming in 1959 brother branham says he showed what he did to the whole human race the way god represented himself in jesus christ he expressed his opinion to the human race to forgive and to love those who were unlovable and i wonder on this easter morning how short we fall of that we could love those who love us but he loved those who did not love him he was the greatest the first representation of love that ever hit the earth and was despised of those who lived on the earth to whom he loved no man could ever love like him and no man was ever hated like him they hated him and despised him and rejected him but it did not stop his love the last when he was hanging on the cross after that life he had lived been nothing been done nothing but good things forgiving the guilty healing the sick and just things that were good when he was his last breaths on the cross with the vulgar mocking spit of them who stood by hanging from his sacred face he cried with a heart full of love father forgive them for they know not what they do he could understand being god he understands that's why he could love us when we were unlovable because he's god and he understands amen amen it just becomes very common to us that we love our friends we love those that are agreeable to us that's the norm of the whole planet but we're not supposed to live spiritually in this dimension there's another dimension that we're called to live in to walk in and that in that dimension we love all whether they meet the standards that we have for who should be loved and who shouldn't be our standards need to change to reflect the standards of our father a few scriptures to read just real quickly you don't need to turn to them luke 6 35 but love you your enemies and do good and land hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and you shall be the children of the highest for he is kind into the thankful unthankful and to the evil john 13 34 a new commandment i give unto you that you love one another as i have loved you that you love one another i i so often think of the scripture in ephesians 5 husbands love your wives even as christ loved the church amen to that this is saying the same thing to each other we're to love one another as christ loved the church my how did he love us the very last breath he breathed was loving us and he rose again loving us he lived loving god and loving us and giving us all that's the kind of love that we're supposed to have for each other in the token brother branham says oh take this solemnly we should love one another oh my we should be so in love amen oh yeah that's awesome don't never speak evil against one another oh there's a lot that goes into that small phrase don't never speak evil against one another i'll let you think about it if somebody makes a mistake pray for him right quick we are together in this with god we are brothers and sisters that is a extremely packed quote and i'm going to read it again because it's awesome oh take this solemnly we should love one another oh my we should be so in love don't never speak evil against one another if somebody makes a mistake pray for him right quick we're together in this with god we're brothers and sisters i love that in expectations brother branham says simeon the great this great old saint of god he was a man of great reputation oh today they happen to say but wait a minute sir i'm a businessman i'm a doctor i'm a professor you're no better than anybody else and whenever you think you're better than somebody else then you're nothing that you ought to be the scripture says see when you get to a place you got to you how can you have faith when you're expecting honor one from another see you must prefer one another always that's the life of christ to prefer your brother sister and if they're wrong what is he gonna say next and if they're wrong that's all right you'll never make them any better by kicking them around put an arm around them pick them up i like this old time religion i'll tell you what it'll do it'll make a tuxedo suit set by a pair of overalls and put her arm around one another and call each other brother that's right it'll make a calico dress and a silk one call one another sister it sure will it's gun barrel straight and sky blue and it's it'll certainly do it i love that he put that statement it's gun barrel straight and sky blue right along with speaking against sin right along with love and you're no better than anybody else you're all the same whether you've got a tuxedo on you're rich in other words whether you're rich or whether you're poor that shouldn't change anything that shouldn't change our attitude that shouldn't change of our view of ourself that shouldn't change the view of other people i'm just going to read through first corinthians 13 4 4 through 7 and i'm going to read it in the in the esv just quickly go through it because you get a picture we we hear a lot love is corrective it is corrective amen but that's not all it is there's more right love is corrective god loves us and when we're wrong he corrects us and if we love one another we'll we'll in love not anger in love correct each other and when you correct each other you'll feel respected honored and loved not belittled and kicked in the dirt love is patient and kind love does not envy or boast it is not arrogant or rude it does not insist on its own way it is not irritable or resentful it does not rejoice at wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth love bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things amen second corinthians 12 15. and i will very gladly spend and be spent for you though the more abundantly i love you the less i be loved think about that for a second i mean it's easy to read these verses and and just go to the next one but look at what is being said i will spend in other words i'm going to take my resources and spend them for who believers the corinthians and again remember that the corinthians were a mess they were a mess but didn't change paul's attitude towards them it didn't change the way he felt about them i will spend and i will spend myself for you even though your love goes this way you decide we don't like paul i never really liked his preaching his letters are frustrating us and upsetting us says it doesn't matter i love i'm going to love you even more galatians 5 13-15 for brethren you have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but if you de bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one another by love serve one another how do we how do we express our love for one another again it's not just a feeling it's not just an emotion we sit in church i sure love these people as we clap together and sing to sing together that's that's fine it's good to feel that but that's not really what love is talking about it's talking about serving it's talking about spending yourself it's about expending your energy your money your time on other people and that means your family too not just outside of your family on your family too giving yourself as a sacrifice for other people for we want to fulfill the law how do we fulfill the law by having that love for other people love your neighbor as yourself it's pretty simple right we learn that from the time we're little babies in the jewish in the jewish faith they learn the shema and with the shema is hero israel the lord our god the lord is one shall love the lord your god with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind with all your strength and you shall love your neighbor as yourself they repeat this from the time there can even just speak right it's so simple and yet what is the thing that the lord through this beautiful message the opening of the word the great revelations that have come forth what is god giving us that for to do in us to bring us to that simple thing perfect love loving one another loving our enemies from our heart not because we have to but because we want to because god has placed it within us and it just is our it's our reaction it's our supernatural i was going to say natural reaction but it's our supernatural reaction to whatever comes in front of us so i think this is where jason has come it's this is a great place for me to stop so i'm going to hand it right i'm going to pray and hand it right over to you heavenly father we thank you so much for your word lord we pray you would allow this this life which is in the word to come into us lord i believe it's there within us by the baptism of the holy ghost but we need to increase and abound in this love towards one another help help us to get ourselves out of the way help me to get myself out of the way and let you flow through me to others we just want to commit this to you for your glory in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you this morning i'm going to use this brother caleb so i didn't wire up this morning i gotta keep use use little cues to remind myself that i'm not preaching today and so um in the interest of that i'm not even gonna read a text you've already had a text read and a bible lesson uh for sunday school and then brother jason uh i'd ask him to cut it just a little short today it looks like he found a perfect jumping out spot and i just wanted to come and be able to give you all see all your smiling faces and give you all a in-depth uh testimony as i promised that i would and so that's all i'm going to do today just kind of ease back in amen i didn't tell brother matt i was going to do this but i did clear it with the veep so she was good amen and so i had dr meredith come back and give me the once over uh to make sure everything was working right and and i feel good this morning so greece in the name of the lord we're happy to be here today i hope by the by the will of the lord uh i'd like to get back to preaching and we'd have we have brother diggs i think coming hey this wednesday and so i'll look to sunday for the match scheduled but uh i may i may issue an executive order if i can get my family to let me get by with it but uh just wanted to give you this extended testimony today and there's many people streaming watching uh who also wanted to hear it it's quite remarkable and i feel very privileged in my heart to be standing here today i'm glad i'm standing here today and you know i i mean it quite sincerely and i it might sound mushy i don't know but i'm i'm happy to still be here with my wife and even with the glories of heaven and view and my knowing that in all likelihood my hand was on the door that would have crossed me to the other side but uh and you know you've heard me say as much as i'm looking forward to heaven i mean i don't want to take a shortcut i want to finish my job and i and and besides that as far as the rapture friends god's got that that's already done uh the raps you're you're going in the rapture and there's nothing you can do about it amen and so i i just realized that the lord has that in his care and i just want to i want to live my life in sincerity and serving as best i can and so uh it's everything is going good just to give you that quick update everything is every day i'm progressing feeling better and better and better and so um so i there's nowhere to start but start from the beginning and if you'll give me about 20-25 minutes just like to testify to the glory of god amen so i guess now it would have been not the past monday but the monday previous to that i had um just come off of a 30-day rather radical diet to drop some pounds amen and i packed them on i gained the whole entire cove at 19 pounds and and plus some additional ones and so uh so and then you know i i'd kind of been a little bit sequestered caring for my darling and so she's good now and the lord had me back i was losing weight and uh and so all was well so monday i decided to get back out on that monday um uh i guess be almost nearly a fortnight ago um but we as i went back started back with my cardio walking in the mornings it all began when i noticed a strange um it felt like indigestion it didn't feel like pain and it felt like i had you've been standing near me uh i would have said hey anthony he got a toms on you i would have said something like that and so i noticed and i walked pretty briskly i walked fast naturally second fastest walker that i know the only one faster than me is brother eugene brown and he i have to almost skip and hop to keep up with him it's those long legs i think but uh but but i walk fast normally and and so i my friends used to always you know we'd be teenagers going to the mall and i'd just be walking because i you know that for me why are we going to the mall okay let's go shopping let's go walking around and my friends are always saying slow down man you're supposed to cruise i'm like why are we here i'm not here to cruise let's go walking so i always walk fast and so i noticed that that was starting to happen in my chest and it was going it wasn't going anywhere else wasn't going up or over it was just going through to my middle back and it was quite uncomfortable and so i naturally just slowed down just naturally because i thought i was thinking about that i realized i'd slowed down well when i slowed down it stopped and i went that's not a good sign so so tuesday i went back out there it was again and uh i slowed down and it was still there i slowed down a little more and it went away and i thought well that's not a good thing and wednesday i went out and i couldn't walk slow enough to not have it happen so um i you know i'm monday and tuesday and wednesday i'm you know you know writing a letter to my sons and saying hey you know i'm gonna stick a letter in my wall safe here's the combination and it says you know do not open unless the unthinkable happens and and and there you know my wife hears me talking to what are you doing i'm like well you know it's a prudent thing you know you want to i should i should have a living will and that's true that's still true i still need to do that nothing wrong with that and so so i still need to do that but you know i just told my boys i said hey on this paper is the keys to all my kingdoms it has all my passwords all my computer accounts all my all my uh cloud servers has everything um every all of my business here's the uh passwords to all of it and i put it in there it's still there and uh just in prudence probably leave it there because i'm i'm i got a lot of i'm i'm i'm that guy who backs up his backup to his backup and so i have so many cloud servers and they're all just backing up the uh one or two that i use mainly so you know in the event um that something would ever happen i mean it would be a nightmare for my family to try to decipher everything that you know i have going on so but i you know i and i know i know i'm guilty of under playing things and sometimes you know i'm i'm i'm i tend to be positive minded i get that from brother eddie thank the lord i don't really suffer depression if depression ever comes on me it lasts almost a whole day and goes away and then i'm fine because i just shake it off and move on and you know my life and times are in his hands anyway so i'm just never going to give the devil credit that he's anybody as far as i'm concerned he ain't nobody and i don't live by his mercy and he don't make decisions about my life my father makes all my decisions and uh i don't need a treaty with the devil i don't need to make a deal with him um you know i i'm just going to attack him because he's going to attack me anyway there's no need for you to back up in spirituality the devil's not going to give you a break you know don't go thinking i'll just i'll just relax spiritually i won't be so you know i'll just get a little carnal maybe i'll get a little relief i promise you that won't happen the devil will just keep piling it on piling it on until he has you completely you know under his feet and that's nowhere for a child of god to live amen so where eagles were meant to be soaring so um so wednesday um coming to church and i think you were preaching that night hey yeah you were in the back and so i walked in and sat down and this has been going on now for three days and um i'm taking you know i'm using my uh my watch to take an ecg it's it's really an effective tool but it's only one lead it's not like the 12 lead they can put on you uh although it is it does work really well and i'm sending that in and you know getting um you know people that are close to me or look a little concerned and and i and i and i i know that i'm feeling a little bit of nervousness of course i'm not gonna that's probably the last thing in the world sister debbie would need to hear so i'm keeping it firmer you say well you know you're being dishonest hey hold on i got brother branham said that when abraham when god told abraham take your son and go and sleep and brother branham says in its own tape of course he didn't tell sarah because she would have screamed okay so that that's not a a carte blanche to keep things from your wife and family brothers but but you know i was just trying to exercise a little wisdom and um and plus i was trying to be positive because that's how i defeat the devil friends i've been all over the world i've seen him defeated so many times i could stand up here and use up all my time just giving you testimony i've seen the blind eyes open i've seen epileptic demons cast off of people i've had those things happen all over the world i've seen people write while the preaching of the gospel be healed of incurable diseases testified to it after service you know i've seen people give their hearts to the lord teenagers filled with the holy ghost while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on them so i've seen that happen i know what god is capable of i am not a man of fear i don't fear anything and so uh you know and i and i've just i just say it like this you can't make you can't you can't frighten a man who's not afraid to die period and so you know that's just how i look at it and i'd rather look at it like that i'd rather see the glass half full i'd rather try to find that silver lining around every dark cloud you know so uh i'm always looking for the positive always trying to figure out you know the lord's got this and so that's really what was going on i wasn't being careless i was just being me and it served me well and i don't plan to change that but but um facts were the facts and the facts were and i didn't know it at that time i had a problem and um i knew of course brother eddie had um had heart disease and uh he had had a triple bypass at 60 mom 64. and um and he had to stay on statins and the rest of his his days and uh and uh and then his mother she died at 58. 50. wow his mother passed away at 50 suddenly so um i knew that there was that element of it and so uh and i've i've i'm not i'm not the best when it comes to eating right and getting good sleep and exercising i will admit that that's how i was then it's not how i am now and so so i so i i knew that was all in my mind so i i you know i i had said i thought well you know here's a good idea so i thought you know i'll have doc meredith bring her blood pressure and stethoscope and als and i'd actually tried to um figure out how to we could meet sooner but we just decided okay wednesday night at church so she's all set i'm all set you know just i'm just taking precautions she's going to come back and and check vpn and heart rate and listen and and i can do an ecg here and there's a lot of different things uh well so i walk in because i'm this is this is going to be the first two things that happened together that were incredible because what i have discovered friends is that what is evident now what i didn't know then is that demon forces were moving trying to eliminate me but in a realm i couldn't see angels were moving to interdict and at every movement the devil would try the angel would interdict and and here you're about to hear two of the first ones so when i came to church i'm sitting in the in the back office and just walked in and i just sit down and matt's sitting there preparing and i i just thought well you know um i have a lot of confidence in matt's prayer should just have him offer prayer for me so i said hey son you got a minute he said yeah sure dad and he backed away from his notes and i just began to tell him what happened i said you know you probably were wondering about the the letter i sent you and your brothers and i said so monday and then this happened tuesday and then this happened wednesday and and i and and i said it felt like indigestion and it feels like when i walk it's worse when i sit down it goes away and he he's he was like what he's like you're not gonna believe what happened to me today and i said what and he said he was in a conversation with the man who i know well and that man was standing there giving him those exact same words and now he's been i guess in and out of the hospital over some heart and stress and different things that are going on in very poor health and was literally almost he said you're almost using the exact verbiage the same words and he's like dad you got to go to the hospital right now right now you got to leave and go and i'm like oh i'm not doing that oh my goodness you know and what do they know anyway and so and so uh but that's just me trying to play it off i hate making a federal case out of things making a big deal it gets away with me a little bit i probably get that from sister mom back there i'm a private person and so so i um so he's like he's and so he gets up and walks out man little did i know he was going to get reinforcements next thing i know he unlocks jd in walks chris and they're both standing over me like thugs and i'm thinking okay what is about to happen here and so he just he relates everything to him and uh and so they had prayer for me standing right there and and and now so the fact that he had had he had that very day had had that conversation with that man is what made him feel so urgent even with me trying to play it off and he just wouldn't he wouldn't have it and so i i just kept making excuses now you know what have happened friends i was planning for doc meredith to come and check me out and that's what i would have done i can tell you right now i would have said hey don't worry but on the way i think to church sister meredith had sent me a text saying with no plausible ex reason it's never happened before brother john wouldn't do this but he literally took her equipment out of the car before they left for church and you've never done that brother john or certainly would know not to do something like that but yet had he done that and had she had that stuff i would just let her come back and you know what she would have found the same thing that the er found when i went my heart was fine it sounded good everything was working good um while i was in the hospital over those three days including the the er that night um they they probably did a 12-lead ekg on me probably 20 times they'd come in every four hours all through the day and night taking they test my blood i went i went on because but you see because now watch how this chain of events works so matt has that conversation now he's concerned now i can't get out of it because she don't have her stuff so okay i'll go so chris you know and chris he wasn't going to have it matt wasn't going to have it brother jason was standing there they were praying for me and uh so chris took me uh popped me in his jeep we went up there while y'all were in service here and uh sure enough you know i had i'd done that one other time and you know they said they told me the same thing well you know we did your blood there's no enzymes there's nothing if you'd had a heart event it would be showing or you seem to be fine you have the heart of an athlete i've heard that many times i do have a strong a very strong ejection fraction in my heart very strong heart and so even at the emergency room that's what they're telling me and uh and so i'm saying well okay okay well praise the lord i guess i'm i'm okay and uh and i said well i'll i'll be y'all gonna get me checked out he goes well we'd actually like to keep you overnight for observation i was like i'm not doing that i said get get the papers ready i said i'm out of here i said if you've checked me out and i'm fine there's no reason uh to stay and so um the doctor was kind of um you know and it was so amazing i was texting brother andrews i'm going to the hospital hey doc you're working i'm coming up that way and he wasn't responding and i and i'm just texting him bombing him where are you at where you at and chris said daddy's on the piano he's playing piano he's just on the stage with him like oh okay never mind and so uh so but you know you know however that would have went but it turns out i had a different care provider and so uh i and so they told me they come in there and they said okay we're gonna let you go we know we can't stop you but understand that you're going home under us extremely heightened alert if you have anything no matter how mild if that comes back you've got to promise you'll come straight back i'm like yeah sure i'll be fine well i you know even as i'm walking out to my to get in my truck i start feeling it and i get in and as soon as i sit in the truck it goes away and then debbie's right here and chris is right here okay we're going back in i'm like no i'm fine i'm fine i'm fine i'm fine oh good so they made me promise that that night i would um go the first thing out of the box as brother dale would say first thing when you wake up as soon as the cardiologist's office opens you call and you get and get in there immediately i'm like okay sure i promise so true to my word i got up that morning and a normal morning as you could want and i started calling right when i came out of my morning bible study i called over to their office and um you know there was uh there was no openings for at least three to four days over the weekend they might could get me in the next week on a monday or tuesday and even with me even with i i had their scheduling lady on the phone and even with me telling her everything that had happened and at the er and the er i said the er told me this morning and they s and and and and i and i've got i've got a funny thing in my chest when i walk and when i sit down it goes away and even with all of that she just said i mean there was nothing nothing available until suddenly while talking to me it literally materialized on her screen she had no openings for days and and and i mean it it literally went like this i'm sorry i have nothing oh wait oh my i just had an opening pop pop up we just had an opening can you be here in 30 minutes if you could be here in three minutes i said i'll be out the door in five minutes and i'll be there you understand friends god little things moving behind the scenes and so you know i got into the doctor and you know that guy's funny man i i like him a lot and and um and so uh they i i don't i could be completely wrong i don't have a clue if he's on the spectrum i think he's high functioning autistic myself because he's so odd and the nurses all said oh he's kind of mean and rude and as soon as i start talking to him i realize he's not mean and rude he's just he he and i thought to myself i've seen this before and he has he has an oddity about him because he's on the if if so be that he's on that upper end of the spectrum which i have no i no idea if that's true but he was he was uh he's a brilliant man he reminded me of mike gonzalez brother michael and brother michael's a different kind of a dude and you have to understand brother mike when you're talking to him brilliant guy but uh you know brother michael has a a very high functioning level on the spectrum that's why he's so good at his job and so uh and i thought well i know i know i've seen this before and so then i started realizing how to deal with him and then you know it it started going good from right there and so i um but i'm still trying to play it off and you know he's listening to my symptoms and he's listening to me describe everything and he's like you're scaring me to death he said you need to go back to the hospital right now and i was like oh you know i don't know about that he goes he said i i don't even want to finish this visit he said you know you're telling me he said you're giving me the worst thing a cardiologist can hear you have pain when you walk in your chest and when you stop it stops and i said yeah he goes i said well but i only have a little bit he said well i don't have any and he looked at his assistant he said do you have any and it says no and he looked at matt do you have any man's like nope and so so i said he said you got i'm going to call you go right you're going to be admitted i'm going to call ahead and then i'll be right behind you after i finish up so so i go out to the car and you know matt's right on my heel okay let's go okay dad and i'm like okay listen matt i'm gonna i'm gonna go home first i'm not prepared to go and his dad that's it i was gonna have to fight him he said you're not that's not gonna happen you're going i'll go to your house and get all your stuff you're going straight to hospital i said mom don't even know i need an overnight bag mom will get all that i'll get all your stuff and uh he said you leave here and go straight there and i'll take my truck and go to your house right away oh well here we go so i go to back out his truck he had parked when he met me there he parked around the back because we thought that's where we would go in so i gotta give him a quick lift around the building and and now i'm just trying to back up and i can't you know there's cars on both sides i'm at a way far remote into the parking lot and so i'm carefully starting to back out i don't see anything in my rear camera i don't see anything doing this right as i back out like this to go that way as soon as i back out oh i'm sorry there's a car and and some guy and he's just come to a stop and he doesn't look happy and people are so uh you know uptight these days my goodness the guy was already red in the face and older man than me and and uh you know i mean i just looked so i you know how you you know how sometimes where it's more makes more sense rather than do the american thing to go around the right it's more british and better just to go left and let him go that way because you're already kind of jacked up in that angle a little bit and so i just said oh i waved i'm sorry and i went to go left so he could slip around me and he man he's looking through his windshield at me and he's like one and i and i just thought what in the world and you know i i'm real laid back and easy going and and uh and and that in it and it was something like that wouldn't have bothered me until it occurred to me goodness gracious he's doing that on purpose this guy is like on purpose won't move and it's trying to block me well that don't work for brother jason and so the next thing you know i'm all up in the air and he's up in the air and matt's jumping out of the truck and trying to talk to him you know get out of the way and you know we got to go to the hospital and some other different things but it whatever got said he finally reluctantly moved out of my way and and and matt you know jump back in he goes you see that you're definitely going to the hospital now you're definitely going right now and so um so i did and um you know they started their battery of tests and they my goodness i've never been stuck poke stabbed bled tested scanned in in my life and i was giving you a little bit of updates and every test was coming back right as rain all my ekgs were coming back normal all my blood they were taking blood every four hours all coming back normal um had a little high a little bit of the i guess there's two kinds of cholesterol and my bad one was a little high and so um other than that and blood pressure was a little moderate my blood pressure been that way for 30 years always on the what they call a moderate high or something like that not never life-threatening but you know my brother eddie always used to tell me i should get that treated i never did and uh and then you know they did they were doing every kind of scan they nuclear scans and and they took me down to nuclear medicine and they did a uh a calcium scan and even the even the cardiologist came back and he stood in my room and he said you know he said i'm really shocked he said um he said i really expected with your blood pressure and you haven't treated it for 30 years he said i expected your heart and aryan valves i guess whatever that works to have a lot of calcium buildup and he said you really didn't have any he said i was stunned by that he said i did see one small area but he said it looks very very slight i'm not really worried about it and i was sitting there thinking i thought well you know brother matt brother chris and brother jason and the whole church you know i knew was praying for me so i just i just say glory be to god because it even surprised him and so they were doing every other kind of test and everything was coming up good and uh so on the last day they decided to do the uh nuclear stress test and they had actually did some of the nuclear parts of it the night before to get that out of the way and the next day that i guess i was going to do the treadmill part hooked up and then they combine oh i'm not sure how it works i guess they combine all the data but it's the most effective one i guess better than just you know doing the regular stress test so i was getting the best of care and they weren't taking any shortcuts but we were encouraged my wife my family the church i was telling you hey all the tests are coming back good thank you for your prayers and while i was on the machine and um they had they had it speed sped it up pretty good and i was doing just fine i'd had a lot of anxiety over doing it until i got going i thought this is nothing this is easy and this is almost not much faster than i walk because i power walk a lot and so but then i started feeling it and i said to the technician and and you know what the i didn't realize i saw the technician trying to look over his shoulders he said wow do what do what do we owe this great privilege because the cardiologist had actually come down to to witness it he doesn't usually do that they were surprised he was in there he said i just wanted to see how mr watkins would do so he's standing behind me she's to here and there's another technician back over here and i said hey you know i'm starting to feel that a little bit and he spoke up behind me he said you feel it right now and i said yeah right this minute and he was looking at the at the scans as it was because it does it live and uh he said could you speed up and i said sure yeah go for it and you know then they really cranked it up and then i went right along and he said you feel it and i said yeah definitely i feel a lot right now he goes okay i've seen enough and they stopped he said i'll take all this data back to my office and i'll make a decision this afternoon what to do and when he went back he looked at everything looked at all the studies and everything from the night i'd been into the er and he he felt good about it all but just in an abundance of caution he called me and talked to me on the phone and in an abundance of caution he said i'm going to do that he said let's just do one last thing just so we can be sure when he said that i was glad because i thought i want to be sure you know i would like to know uh and if that's not what it is then what is it and so and when they when you know they have me and you they don't actually put you to sleep and i was so glad he's the only cardiologist that goes through here rather than through a groin and up like he goes up through here and over and down in and as soon as he did he i i could kind of see him and there was a screen and another screen but i could see him and he he's right there and he's looking and he goes mr watkins you have you have a blockage wow he said a big blockage he said 95 and then he revised it to 99 and um and then i had two others which were not consequential they didn't even bother with them at all uh diet and exercise could handle them um but and for my age it wouldn't even be that uncommon where they were but that one was my main artery and um and they call it the widow maker artery and i would through that main artery my heart was getting about one percent of its needed blood and that's why when i would walk fast it was starving my heart was starving for for oxygen and blood and i was literally friends probably within hours or days of passing away suddenly to the cataclysmic shock of my family to the shock of you as my church as a church and um you know but i just say that that the lord who spared my life must have more for me to do and can i say it like this the lord must have more for us to do how about it how many will join that with me and say brother jason the lord must have more for us to do amen and so you know i i said a few comments you know i think wednesday about you know i realize that i'm trying to concentrate on quality over quantity it's not works for the sake of works remember my testimony to you many times and from years ago when i'm asking the lord to let me do more for him remember that i said lord i just want to do more i just want to do more for you and the lord spoke to me in one of the clearest ways i've ever had happen and the lord said i don't need you to do more i need you to be more you do the be and i'll do the doing is what he said and and so now you can well imagine that with a deeper sincerity uh than ever before to get us all home that's why i live friends to get us all home that's why i'm here that's why i'm a shepherd that's why i i i worry about you and i pray for you you know why i want to get us all home all of us all of us see i don't want to i mean all of our families all of our little ones i don't like moses said we're not going to leave a hoof behind in egypt and so you know with all of our families and all of our little ones anthony come on back

more than ever before i need you i need you [Music] well i am here very unexpectedly um okay well so a very long time ago 20 some years ago the lord put promise above my heart and i was that woman that went to the lord and had to touch the hem of his garment for a special need in my life my marriage had been destroyed and he promised to restore it so i've just had an experience with the lord where i had the cancer last year and the lord used ministry to direct me and give me special things that helped me so much and just gave me direction and um it was like one service after another lord put on my heart and i didn't even know these services existed but the lord directed them to me on youtube and they would pop up and it would be this ministry and that ministry it was just what i needed and the first one started with one here in october that our brother jason demars preached he didn't know it but the lord spoke to me in that service telling me that i was going to go through something but that i was going to be okay so it put a faith in me that there was just no fear at all from the from the moment i found out that i had melanoma and as you all know that the lord just brought me through that amazingly um and i'm 100 um the lord's been doing that to me with this restoration of my marriage um there's been a lot of events that's been taking place that just it's just been amazing um but i stand here today knowing that it doesn't matter what i see with my eyes it's just knowing what i know in my heart the lord has promised so i'm not standing here telling you this because everything looks good and everything looks peachy i'm standing here i was standing back there and because i'm not supposed to be in a group of fifty so i'm very social distance so i'm i'm good um but um uh brother matt preached the other night and um and he was at the end of the service um he was just going into you know the holy spirit going out after your family and then of course that's just one of the things that was said um but it's just touching my heart right where god wants it touched because it's putting a deeper burden and then brother branham's message when i lived in tennessee before the lord brought me here for his specific purpose this particular service was one that god directed me to hear that i needed at the time and it was telling me there's a time and a season and when it's his season that's when it's going to come to pass and i'm two years down the road since the lord directed me to that menace to that to that sermon and that sermon came to me just the other day i was like oh my goodness the same is just on my heart all day and i was like oh god thank you and there's been some things that's progressed in his life that's you know just made me you know recognized that you know god does one thing and then he'll do another and he has to do it all in a certain order in order for it to all work out the way it wants to and i didn't have no intention of doing this so i'm standing back there and the lord just it was like it spoke to my heart just to testify before it even happened before anyone can see it so then satan immediately was like you know you can't go up there and do that it's like you know this making it this is public these services air online it's public and i try to be very respectful of my husband's life this is his life and his testimony to give but the lord put it on my heart and i was like i'm not going to let satan rob i have nothing to ashamed of god's word so he directed me to speak this and the lord is restoring my marriage that's all i can tell you here it is [Music] [Applause] [Music] i once [Music] but i'm home now i once was lost but now i'm fine and now my life song sings once was blind but now i see i once was blind but now i see i don't know how when he touched me i once was blind but now i see and now my life song seems and now my life song sings and now my life song sings once was dead but now i live once was dead but now i live now my life to you i give now my life to you i give now my life to you i give [Applause] [Music] hallelujah to you [Music] [Music] [Music] see to you [Music] see [Music] cheers [Music] to you
