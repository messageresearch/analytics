[0:46] [Music]
[0:58] [Music]
[1:02] do

[1:18] do
[1:22] [Music]
[1:45] do

[1:58] so
[2:00] [Music]
[2:16] do
[2:18] [Music]
[2:49] [Music]
[2:53] so
[2:59] [Music]
[3:44] um and then still uh talk about it so uh
[3:48] we'll we'll try to make that happen um
[3:50] i uh
[3:51] i wore my tweed today so we can maybe
[3:53] make the the biology happen um
[3:58] uh
[3:59] so um
[4:00] the the start of the the background
[4:03] information the on our little science
[4:05] class here is that
[4:06] way back in the day you know before
[4:08] darwin came along everyone believed
[4:09] there was a divine creator and you know
[4:11] everything was pretty copacetic and then
[4:13] darwin comes along and says well i found
[4:14] these different creatures um
[4:16] specifically the main one that people
[4:17] talk about is the birds that he found
[4:19] called finches and they all differ
[4:21] little varieties of finches they're all
[4:22] about the same but they have different
[4:23] beak shapes and because they have a
[4:25] different beak shape they need a
[4:26] different kind of different kind of food
[4:28] some eat seeds some little insects
[4:30] and he believed that over time they were
[4:32] all one bird and that over time they all
[4:34] sort of evolved into different kind of
[4:36] animal
[4:36] you know the same animal but have a
[4:38] different kind of niche that they're
[4:40] filling with their different attributes
[4:42] and that made pretty good sense to him
[4:44] and everybody else around him and so
[4:46] that's kind of how the theory of
[4:47] evolution came about and he said well if
[4:49] a little bird can evolve a slightly
[4:51] different beak shape that slowly evolves
[4:53] a slightly different diet there's really
[4:55] nothing that says that you can't run
[4:56] that to some absolute extreme and that
[4:58] little bird also turned into a bald
[5:00] eagle or
[5:02] something you know a lizard turned into
[5:03] a bird i mean there's
[5:05] you know that was his logic there
[5:08] and
[5:08] the scientific world kind of made
[5:10] perfect sense and to this day they more
[5:12] or less believe that
[5:14] however back in the late 1900s a group
[5:16] of scientists got together and
[5:20] they started questioning that
[5:22] and a lot of these scientists they
[5:23] weren't they don't necessarily even had
[5:25] a christian background they just said
[5:26] well our science on that we have on how
[5:29] any of this stuff comes to be
[5:31] isn't actually all that solid
[5:33] um because really you can take darwin's
[5:35] theory all the way back but once you get
[5:37] to a single cell
[5:39] you know
[5:40] you know the original cell
[5:42] that doesn't really work darwin didn't
[5:44] have a whole lot to say on that and
[5:45] there's really not a whole lot
[5:47] of information on how that single cell
[5:49] could come about
[5:51] because you really got to come from once
[5:52] you get to there the only thing smaller
[5:54] than that is you're coming from you know
[5:55] volcanic ash
[5:57] and you gotta if you're gonna say that
[5:58] life on earth originated from nothing
[6:00] you gotta explain how
[6:02] volcanic ash and stew turned into a
[6:04] single cell
[6:06] and that's that's the jump right there
[6:08] you
[6:08] that's the that's the that's real
[6:10] conundrum
[6:12] and um
[6:14] furthermore one of the issues that
[6:16] uh really that darwin couldn't have
[6:20] explained because he didn't the
[6:21] scientist wasn't advanced enough yet to
[6:24] know
[6:24] was really what was going on inside of a
[6:27] single cell because back then they
[6:28] thought they barely even knew cells
[6:30] existed by the 1950s
[6:33] they were still even kind of thinking a
[6:34] single cell really wasn't there wasn't
[6:36] much going on inside of it it was just
[6:37] sort of a little blob of goo and that
[6:40] was about it
[6:41] but after that they started developing
[6:43] things like um
[6:44] electron microscopes that could see
[6:47] sub you know cellular structures and
[6:49] things and they realize the inside of a
[6:51] cell is way more complex than anyone had
[6:54] any
[6:55] recollection right
[6:58] it just far
[6:59] just blew everyone's minds because you
[7:01] have a whole world living inside of
[7:03] every single cell in your body
[7:05] um full of intricate complex structures
[7:08] and once you hit that level
[7:10] then you run to this there's a quote of
[7:12] darwin where he says if you could ever
[7:15] find any structure that is so complex
[7:19] in biology it's so complex that you
[7:21] could not reduce it any farther to a sub
[7:23] component and it still function
[7:26] and you can prove that there's no way it
[7:27] could have just evolved that way then
[7:30] the whole theory comes apart and that
[7:32] was darwin said that
[7:34] and so once you get down to the cellular
[7:35] level you end up coming across
[7:38] loads of these very small
[7:41] yet very complex structures that you
[7:44] can't
[7:44] there's not really a way for them to
[7:46] evolve you remove a single piece of it
[7:48] the whole thing falls apart
[7:49] and so evolution doesn't really function
[7:51] anymore
[7:52] um
[7:53] and so this is kind of what started all
[7:55] these scientists really questioning this
[7:58] and they um
[8:00] they
[8:01] like i said they all come together they
[8:02] had a big conference because i mean a
[8:04] lot of these people you start
[8:05] questioning theory of evolution in a
[8:07] secular biology field you lose your phd
[8:10] real quick
[8:11] right i mean you lose your your
[8:12] professorship i mean so they were they
[8:14] all got together had a quiet little
[8:16] conference out on the beach in
[8:17] california and said uh are we all
[8:18] thinking the same thing here
[8:20] and um everyone's like yeah we are and
[8:21] so
[8:22] they built this uh those men eventually
[8:24] came together and they made that
[8:25] documentary that we showed at the senior
[8:27] youth last night
[8:30] in trying to put together something uh
[8:33] for this morning i actually managed to
[8:35] come across that same organization they
[8:37] have a youtube channel now
[8:38] it's great uh they have a lot more
[8:40] videos than just that documentary and i
[8:42] actually got one of their videos and
[8:43] i'll play it um
[8:45] today we'll go ahead and play video one
[8:49] got
[8:50] we got volume
[8:57] he spotlighted and made famous a number
[9:00] of really interesting discoveries that
[9:02] had been occurring in biochemistry and
[9:05] cell biology over the last two or three
[9:07] decades and what what biologists
[9:09] molecular biologists cell biologists
[9:11] microbiologists have been discovering is
[9:13] that
[9:13] at the level of individual cells there
[9:16] are little tiny examples of
[9:18] nanotechnology little tiny machines at
[9:21] work the flagellar motor is the one that
[9:24] he made most famous it's a rotary engine
[9:26] that
[9:27] powers a whip-like tail a protein tail
[9:31] that functions like a propeller and it
[9:34] moves the bacteria through liquid
[9:36] enabling the bacteria to essentially
[9:38] crack down the food
[9:39] supply and this little machine includes
[9:42] a rotor a stator a drive shaft a u-joint
[9:47] bushings bearings and a whip-like tail
[9:49] that functions like a propeller and the
[9:52] machine and some in some bacterial
[9:53] systems turns at 100 000 rpms in one
[9:56] direction and can reverse direction on a
[9:58] quarter of a turn and turn 100 000 rpm
[10:01] in the other direction
[10:02] bacterial flagellum
[10:04] is a true nanomachine about 40
[10:06] nanometers in size it's amazing i mean e
[10:09] coli salmonella which are kind of our
[10:12] model systems for the bacterial
[10:14] flagellum can propel the cell
[10:16] about 20 lengths per second through a
[10:19] very viscous medium like water to these
[10:21] organisms and you extrapolate that to
[10:23] human
[10:25] scale 20 body lengths per second
[10:27] six foot person
[10:30] you know times 20 120 120 feet per
[10:33] second mark spitz or
[10:36] phelps would be setting
[10:39] records
[10:40] with this type of propulsion it's
[10:43] hardwired into a
[10:44] a signal tranduct a signal transduction
[10:47] circuit that allows the bacterium to
[10:49] sense changes in the sugar gradient in
[10:51] the uh in the surrounding liquid this
[10:54] signal transduction system is actually a
[10:56] short-term memory system where the cell
[10:59] is if it's going in the direction of
[11:02] an attractant a nutrient that it can use
[11:06] to metabolize
[11:07] it
[11:08] follows that chemical gradient
[11:10] if it's a repellent
[11:12] it will sense that and move in in the
[11:14] opposite direction
[11:16] so it's more than just this engine it's
[11:19] an extraordinary piece of nanotechnology
[11:21] it's high tech in low life
[11:24] and so
[11:25] just by spotlighting these extraordinary
[11:28] pieces of nanotechnology inside cells
[11:30] and the flagellar motor wasn't the only
[11:32] one
[11:32] one by any means
[11:34] beehee in a sense opened up a window
[11:38] for people he opened up the black box of
[11:40] the of the inner workings of the cell
[11:42] and said look this is
[11:44] much more complicate
[11:46] complex than anything that then than
[11:48] anything that the early evolutionary
[11:50] biologists had envisioned darwin knew
[11:52] nothing of this type of nanotechnology
[11:54] in cells and at the very least we've got
[11:56] to come up with an explanation for this
[12:00] okay so
[12:01] as one example um i would
[12:04] uh
[12:05] that was kind of one of the examples
[12:06] that they used in the documentary last
[12:07] night and you can see i mean they used
[12:09] the term drive shaft stator rotor
[12:12] they didn't
[12:13] come up with that because they're trying
[12:14] to in you know imply some sort of
[12:15] intelligent design the the scientists
[12:17] who discovered this these structures
[12:18] they look at that and said no that's
[12:20] what they are they're literally those
[12:22] components you if you saw it in a car
[12:24] that's what we would call it too
[12:26] um
[12:27] and they're
[12:28] incredibly complex and any single one of
[12:30] those components there's about 40
[12:32] components that go to that structure you
[12:34] remove any single one of them the whole
[12:35] thing comes apart there's no way you can
[12:36] really build that structure or that that
[12:40] motor
[12:41] piecemeal doesn't it doesn't evolve it
[12:43] doesn't come about bit by bit you would
[12:45] have to have the entire thing pre-built
[12:47] loaded into the into the intelligence of
[12:50] that cell off the bat or the thing just
[12:53] doesn't get built
[12:55] if you
[12:56] there's no way that that gets produced
[12:57] gradually okay
[12:59] and um i mentioned for the senior youth
[13:02] who are here who are interested i
[13:03] mentioned another thing called atp
[13:05] synthase we'll play that second video
[13:06] and you'll get to see that because that
[13:07] wasn't in the documentary
[13:10] you want to play video 2
[13:12] for me
[13:15] all life on earth depends on this tiny
[13:18] energetic molecule
[13:20] adenosine triphosphate or atp
[13:24] atp drives biochemical activity inside
[13:28] your living cells
[13:29] and is a key building block of dna and
[13:32] rna
[13:35] generating atp for your living cells are
[13:38] mitochondria electrochemical batteries
[13:41] that converts energy from the food you
[13:43] eat and oxygen from the air you breathe
[13:46] into atp
[13:48] so where does your atp come from
[13:54] deep inside your mitochondria rows of
[13:56] molecular motors generate atp
[14:00] the molecule essential to all life on
[14:02] earth
[14:07] enzymes bring together reactants to form
[14:09] a chemical bond converting mechanical
[14:12] energy into chemical energy
[14:18] a ring of enzymes work in step
[14:20] creating three molecules of atp with
[14:24] each cycle
[14:31] inside the molecular motor a rotating
[14:34] axle powers the sequence
[14:38] the axle is attached to a rotary
[14:40] molecular motor moved by the force of
[14:43] protons pushing from the other side of
[14:45] the membrane
[14:49] a difference in proton concentration
[14:52] propels the molecular mechanism
[14:56] [Music]
[15:01] synthesis of atp
[15:08] atp drives biochemical activity inside
[15:11] your living cells and is a key building
[15:14] block of dna and rna
[15:20] okay
[15:21] so
[15:23] these two structures again every single
[15:24] component of them is
[15:27] they're completely essential for the
[15:29] function of life without that structure
[15:30] that we just saw there life just doesn't
[15:32] exist
[15:33] the cell dies um
[15:36] there's
[15:37] nothing even exists on a bacterial level
[15:39] if you don't have that and you remove a
[15:40] single component from it you change one
[15:42] component of it everything's gone it's
[15:44] there's no life without that
[15:46] and it's incredibly complex those i mean
[15:48] it kind of looks a little funny because
[15:50] to our eyes because it's you know it's
[15:51] actually a 3d rendering of it you know
[15:53] with a computer but it's very accurate
[15:55] um that
[15:56] i know the guy who made that or i don't
[15:58] know him personally but i know of him
[15:59] the guy who made that animation um and
[16:01] he's a he's a
[16:03] biochemist and he uses
[16:06] really sophisticated machines to really
[16:08] figure out the structures of these these
[16:09] uh molecules that do this and he makes
[16:11] very accurate renderings of them so that
[16:14] we can see how how they function
[16:15] mechanically
[16:16] and
[16:18] you know um
[16:20] that
[16:21] that process that's going on there
[16:25] there's it's far too complex of a thing
[16:28] to just happen on accident
[16:30] right it's just not you're not gonna
[16:32] you know each one of those it kind of
[16:33] looks kind of like it's a bunch of like
[16:35] little globs stuck together well each
[16:36] one of those globs is a is a function of
[16:39] um
[16:40] amino acids uh sticking together and it
[16:43] makes that structure well it's
[16:45] incredibly complex and those amino acids
[16:47] are originally organized in a big chain
[16:49] and then those chains sort of
[16:51] congealed down into that blob and those
[16:53] blobs assembled into that big structure
[16:54] that you see
[16:55] well
[16:57] the the exact
[17:00] pattern in which those amino acids at
[17:02] the very ground level are assembled
[17:04] is incredibly important if one of those
[17:07] is off then the whole machine doesn't
[17:08] work it has to be 100 accurate and the
[17:12] pattern of that of how those amino acids
[17:15] are put together would might be very
[17:18] similar to the way that we might um
[17:20] maybe assemble an english sentence with
[17:22] letters
[17:23] you know you
[17:24] in the documentary they use a great
[17:25] example um
[17:27] imagine if you had you know two lines
[17:29] from a famous shakespeare play right to
[17:30] be or not to be
[17:32] that is the question right it's just not
[17:34] very many letters but what do you think
[17:36] are the odds if you started dumping
[17:38] scrabble pieces on a table they're
[17:39] randomly going to a sort into that
[17:40] sentence
[17:42] right
[17:43] it's not really it's not very likely
[17:44] right i mean i mean technically maybe
[17:47] but you're going to be dumping a lot of
[17:48] scrabble pieces for a really long time
[17:50] and even if you did
[17:52] the complexity of what we just saw isn't
[17:54] just two sentences it's
[17:57] several dozen volumes of shakespeare
[17:59] plays stacked into end you're going to
[18:01] be really you know dumping a lot of
[18:02] scrabble pieces then right it's just not
[18:04] going to happen no amount of of time and
[18:07] random chance is going to make that
[18:08] happen
[18:10] and so you wonder okay how does this
[18:11] happen how does the cell know how to how
[18:13] to assemble something like that well
[18:16] this is where we get into
[18:19] genetics
[18:20] um i want to i want to i'm going to use
[18:23] the
[18:24] one thing that i know if you're
[18:25] associated with a methodol we kind of
[18:27] have a bad taste in our mouth around the
[18:28] word dogma
[18:30] because brother branham uses it a lot um
[18:32] in a not a very uh we'll say it um
[18:35] like complimentary way
[18:37] um however i do want to just give a
[18:39] definition of dogma because i don't want
[18:40] you to get hung up on that word because
[18:42] it's a
[18:43] there's something really beautiful here
[18:44] if you if you can see it and if my phone
[18:46] will unlock
[18:48] oh come on
[18:50] um
[18:54] all right so
[18:56] the oxford uh or i'll go with the
[18:58] webster's definition of dogma first and
[19:01] it just simply means a doctrine or body
[19:03] of doctrines concerning faith or morals
[19:05] formally stated and other
[19:07] um and authoritatively proclaimed by a
[19:10] church
[19:12] the oxford definition of dogma would
[19:14] just simply mean a principle or set of
[19:16] principles laid down by an authority as
[19:18] incontrovertibly true
[19:20] okay so this is just the absolute
[19:22] fundamental truth that any organization
[19:25] believes in
[19:26] we might say that they're you know we
[19:28] would have a dogma but our dogma would
[19:29] be the bible right we're not gonna
[19:31] accept anything outside of that um
[19:35] but in biology they also have a dogma
[19:38] and it is called the central
[19:40] it's the central dogma of biology
[19:44] the central dogma of biology states
[19:49] describes the flow of genetic
[19:51] information in cells from dna to
[19:53] messenger rna to protein it states that
[19:57] genes specify the sequence of mrna
[20:00] molecules which in turn specify the
[20:02] sequence of proteins now that sounds
[20:04] like a lot of word salad
[20:05] hopefully this last video i'll go with
[20:07] video five i'll skip over some of my
[20:09] videos
[20:10] five
[20:11] um
[20:13] the central dogma of biology this is it
[20:15] this is the this dogma input dna double
[20:18] helix contains two linear sequences of
[20:20] the letters a c g and t which carry
[20:23] coded instructions
[20:25] transcription of dna begins with a
[20:27] bundle of factors assembling at the
[20:29] start of a gene to read off the
[20:31] information that will be needed to make
[20:33] a protein
[20:34] the blue molecule is unzipping the
[20:36] double helix and copying one of the two
[20:39] strands the yellow chain sneaking out at
[20:41] the top is a close chemical cousin of
[20:44] dna called rna
[20:46] the building blocks to make the rna
[20:48] enter through an intake hold they are
[20:50] matched to the dna letter by letter to
[20:52] copy the gene
[20:54] at this point the rna needs to be edited
[20:56] before it can be translated into a
[20:58] protein
[20:59] this editing process is called splicing
[21:02] which involves removing the green
[21:04] non-coding regions called introns
[21:06] leaving only the yellow protein coding
[21:08] exons
[21:10] splicing begins with assembly of factors
[21:13] at the intron exon borders which act as
[21:16] beacons to guide small proteins to form
[21:18] a splicing machine called the
[21:20] spliceosome
[21:21] the animation is showing this happening
[21:23] in real time
[21:25] the spliceosome then brings the exons on
[21:28] either side of the intron very close
[21:30] together ready to be cut
[21:32] one end of the intron is cut and folded
[21:34] back on itself to join and form a loop
[21:37] the spliceosome then cuts the rna to
[21:39] release the loop and join the two exons
[21:41] together
[21:43] the edited rna and intron are released
[21:45] and the spliceosome disassembles
[21:48] this process is repeated for every
[21:50] intron in the rna
[21:52] numerous spliceosomes remove all introns
[21:55] so that the edited rna contains only
[21:57] exons which are the complete
[21:59] instructions for the protein
[22:01] again this is happening in real time
[22:04] when the rna copy is complete it sneaks
[22:06] out into the outer part of the cell
[22:10] then all the components of a molecular
[22:13] factory called the ribosome lock
[22:15] together around the rna
[22:18] it translates the genetic information in
[22:20] the rna into a string of amino acids
[22:22] that will become a protein
[22:24] special transfer molecules the green
[22:26] triangles bring each amino acid to the
[22:29] ribosome inside the ribosome the rna is
[22:32] pulled through like a tape
[22:36] there are different transfer molecules
[22:38] for each of the 20 amino acids shown as
[22:40] small red tips the code for each amino
[22:43] acid is read off the rna three letters
[22:46] at a time and match to three
[22:48] corresponding letters on the transfer
[22:50] molecules the amino acid is added to the
[22:52] growing protein chain and after a few
[22:54] seconds the protein starts to emerge
[22:56] from the ribosome
[22:58] ribosomes can make many proteins it just
[23:01] depends what genetic message you feed
[23:03] into the rna
[23:05] all right so i got four minutes left so
[23:08] we're going to try to wrap it up quick
[23:10] um so
[23:12] all of this really boils down to one
[23:14] thing and that is
[23:15] inside of every cell and i i could i
[23:17] could condense the entire um we say that
[23:20] we'll call this the central dogma of
[23:21] biology into one thing and that is
[23:23] inside of every single one of your cells
[23:24] is a
[23:25] coded
[23:27] message it is it is absolute um it
[23:30] includes the instructions to build your
[23:32] entire body through
[23:33] [Music]
[23:35] that process we just saw building
[23:36] proteins and pretty much your entire
[23:38] body's bait made out of these
[23:39] amalgamations of proteins okay
[23:43] and
[23:44] that genetic material that
[23:47] uh you know
[23:49] what is so often referred to in the
[23:51] message as that seed gene right you know
[23:53] we talk about genetics a gene um we have
[23:56] genes in our in within your dna that
[23:58] code for proteins that are the
[23:59] instructions on how to build proteins
[24:03] that is intelligent
[24:05] you can't really that doesn't arrive
[24:07] arise naturally there's no way to
[24:09] there's there's no known biological
[24:11] mechanism on how dna could arise
[24:13] naturally
[24:14] it is the instructions on how
[24:16] you're not just dumping scrabble pieces
[24:17] on a table it is the instructions on how
[24:20] to assemble those
[24:21] you know 23 different i think it's 23
[24:23] different amino acids into something as
[24:25] complex as those structures we were
[24:27] seeing before right it's the blueprints
[24:29] it is
[24:30] it is the absolute proof that that some
[24:33] intelligence built that
[24:35] because
[24:36] it's so specific it's it can't really
[24:39] happen through random chance
[24:41] and if we saw this in any other format
[24:43] right you know bill gates called it
[24:45] called um dna the most complex computing
[24:48] system known to man this is bill gates
[24:51] right he writes computer programs and he
[24:53] doesn't imp you know rely on random
[24:55] chance to do it right it's built
[24:58] computer programs are built through
[24:59] intellect not through random chance and
[25:01] so if you have a
[25:03] a
[25:04] anything that is that is very clear
[25:06] written instructions on how to produce
[25:08] something that complex you're not going
[25:10] to call that random chance you're just
[25:12] not
[25:13] um it doesn't make any sense any more
[25:15] than we would see you know a statue
[25:17] carved out of rock and say well it's
[25:19] clearly wind erosion
[25:20] right it's just not gonna that doesn't
[25:22] make any sense obviously it's it's a
[25:24] person carved out of stone so some
[25:26] person must have carved it well this is
[25:28] a person
[25:29] written in
[25:31] in a in an intelligible code
[25:34] we might not understand all of it but
[25:35] it's very clearly build structures that
[25:37] turn into a person so we're not going to
[25:38] call that random chance either it's very
[25:41] clearly built by an intellect it's very
[25:43] clearly made by an intelligence
[25:47] and
[25:49] so that's that was about the extent of
[25:52] the documentary um
[25:54] and
[25:55] the
[25:57] where i would like to go from there
[26:00] is
[26:00] uh well i'll just i'll just say this um
[26:04] that that the genetic material that we
[26:06] saw right that process of dna and they
[26:08] mentioned that it's made up of four
[26:10] letters a c t and g right it's just
[26:12] repeating different lots of different
[26:13] patterns of those four letters repeated
[26:16] across these long long long long strands
[26:18] of dna those in a human body there
[26:21] was a 3.2 billion in a single set of
[26:24] human dna 3.2 billion
[26:27] of those little four letters
[26:29] in a line right and that's what makes up
[26:31] the whole body and your body can uncode
[26:33] those processes or those sequences and
[26:35] turn it into a person much like a
[26:37] computer can turn ones and zeros and
[26:39] turn it into a picture right very
[26:41] similar
[26:42] it's not too far off from the same idea
[26:44] um
[26:47] and
[26:50] um you know with 3.2 billion
[26:54] of those
[26:56] letters strung together you can't have
[26:58] one of them be wrong
[27:00] um
[27:01] can you pull up that picture the brother
[27:03] mark pulled the picture right at the end
[27:05] that i had there
[27:06] this is
[27:07] a sickle cell anemia
[27:09] so you see on the left normal red blood
[27:11] cell that's what everyone's got flowing
[27:12] through your veins and your arteries
[27:15] that's what they're supposed to look
[27:15] like on the right you have a sickle cell
[27:18] people with sickle cell anemia their red
[27:20] blood cells look like that
[27:22] and you can tell
[27:24] that's not a good thing
[27:25] right the shape of your red blood cell
[27:27] is what helps it move through your
[27:28] arteries without getting caught on
[27:29] things and getting stuck
[27:31] um it helps with the absorption of
[27:33] oxygen and for it to do its job well if
[27:35] it's shaped all like a crescent moon it
[27:37] gets hung up in your arteries creates
[27:39] blood clots um it's not going to absorb
[27:41] oxygen correctly it's going to cause a
[27:42] lot of problems
[27:44] now that major
[27:46] twist in the entire structure of a red
[27:48] blood cell comes from a single letter
[27:50] being off
[27:52] just one
[27:53] it's all it takes at a 3.2 billion
[27:56] right and this is
[27:59] you know when brother branham talks
[28:01] about you know the spoken word being the
[28:03] original seed and what's at the bottom
[28:05] of a seed is just a genetic package so
[28:07] this is with the heart of a seed is
[28:09] written instructions on how to manifest
[28:10] the life that that seed is designed to
[28:12] manifest it's the dna inside of it you
[28:15] get one letter off you get a disaster
[28:18] right
[28:19] you get
[28:20] you know we have the word of god this is
[28:22] our genetic this this is our genetic
[28:24] package that tells us how to manifest
[28:26] into into a a new
[28:29] into god's life right that spoken word
[28:32] was the original seed that will manifest
[28:33] into god's life well you get one letter
[28:36] off in that you will end up with
[28:39] something that is not god's life it'll
[28:41] it'll be a disaster
[28:42] right
[28:43] so
[28:44] um
[28:45] i'll uh
[28:47] i'll wrap it up there we're uh we're
[28:49] about one minute over so and uh brother
[28:51] matt already told me i could have a
[28:52] second one so we'll get a sequel
[28:55] all right we'll stand and have a word of
[28:56] prayer
[29:01] father we come before you this this
[29:02] morning and
[29:03] i want to thank you for this opportunity
[29:05] to maybe say something that would help
[29:06] the people
[29:07] maybe that
[29:08] they would see you in in nature more and
[29:11] even see them within your see within
[29:12] themselves father that maybe they would
[29:14] take these things and
[29:16] uh it would help them with your with
[29:18] their walk with you father
[29:20] and father um plea i would ask that you
[29:22] would take these words that i would say
[29:24] that any nerves or
[29:25] or any any spirit of myself that
[29:27] wouldn't
[29:28] wouldn't um extort or contort what you
[29:31] would have to tell the people they would
[29:32] hear it clearly
[29:34] through what you would have to say
[29:35] father
[29:36] ask he sings in jesus name amen
[29:38] and we'll have church in about 10
[29:39] minutes
[29:47] [Music]
[30:03] do
[30:08] [Music]
[31:22] [Applause]
[31:37] do
[31:50] do
[32:03] [Music]
[33:00] you
