brother Bob here today sister asked her on Father's Day amen just make the check out to me personally [Music] amen so uh we're happy to have brother Bob here with us and um never have had the privilege to have him here so today could be the first of a whole new world Amen for us amen we have heard about his ministry for a long time and I sought wanted to bring somebody had it on my mind brother Mike and I got to talking about it and boy what an idea struck me I said let's have brother Bob come let's have Father's Day have him bring the whole tribe he did amen happy to have all of them here today and so we're going to have some fellowship with all of them in the fellowship hall with our lunch afterwards anyone wants to drop in shake the brother's hand and tell him what uh how much you enjoyed I'm I know by faith you're going to enjoy it amen praise the Lord well we're uh I want to announce very good tidings to you today my aunt Joel probably certainly um at the top of the list of the most Gallant Noble sisters as a warrior for Christ is spending her first full day in glory today amen since about 10 minutes before 6 this morning so you're going to want to remember Sister Gene and and her family in prayer and the devil still trying to fight her with this back trouble and that's going to hinder us we're going to have to go up to assist brother Josh Bennett there ministering the funeral in the middle of the week I think they're going to have it somewhere in the middle of this week so we'll go up and back for that so keep us in prayer assisted every night we've been on the road quite a bit a lot but quite quite a lot and So lately but it's all in this in service to his majesty and that wonderful privilege to say I live at the pleasure of the king amen I live my life friends in service to his majesty the King David taught us that the king's business requireth haste so don't don't dilly dally if the king gives you a command say Lord and strengthen me here I go amen so we want to be remembering sister Gene her family amen that's a difficult loss for her but yet at the same time she's happy for sister Joel and sister Joel uh literally you know that smiley happy way that oily like a dove away that she is she was giddy to go she wasn't a bit afraid at all and she actually was saying I mean this is so unheard of in the world today she's saying to her family gleefully almost giddy well I get to go home oh my she lived to a ripe old age and we had been praying that Lord you know if you're gonna heal her then supercharger for some more years and lift her right back up and and but if you're gonna take her uh then then take her quickly with no suffering and my goodness seemed like just a couple of weeks ago I was there and she was as fit as a fiddle ready to go play basketball and uh and she did at 86 years old she'd go to the to play basketball she could shoot 100 out of 100 at the free throw line that's a feat not even Pros can do that and um and just in two weeks she started feeling bad she got a bitterness taste in her mouth and they diagnosed her with cancer and we started praying and before anybody could even get get building faith and challenging the devil God just slipped her home just took her amen there's quite a remarkable story that I'm not going to tell today I'm going to save it for the funeral service but something exceptionally Supernatural happened to her just uh just very shortly before the Lord come to take her right in that two week probably one of the most if not the most Supernatural story I've ever heard amen so I'm looking forward to letting you in on that but I want to save it and wait for the funeral so God bless you your heart's ready now today for the word of God what a wonderful wonderful day it is beautiful day outside and in and all of the beauty of Holiness that we see brother Brown said that's the real beauty of any church is Holiness and righteousness and the love of God in the lives of the people amen Because He Lives brother Anthony I Can Face Tomorrow as we invite brother [Music] come on [Music] [Applause] [Music] my life words [Music] [Applause] amen isn't that the truth he makes life worth living God bless you Saints if we just go ahead and turn to our scripture in Genesis 15. and Exodus 14 I read from 12 of Genesis 15 12 to 14 and and Exodus 14 13 to 16 and as you're turning there I just want to say greetings to you all and it's certainly just a privilege to be here standing in front of the bride of Christ down here in Beaufort South Carolina I was I was raised in South Carolina so I'm I used to be used to the hot weather and everything but um you can probably tell I've got a you can probably tell I got a Southern accent so we're just right at home this morning and uh we certainly bring greetings from from Georgia from a little church there and uh just above Atlanta from Lula Georgia brother Samuel Dell has been pastoring for since since uh I think 1975 so he's been holding the faith for a long time and certainly been great greedies from from the whole church and uh like our brother said I am Esther and Zach's dad so I was so glad to have my family here with us today and and uh that'll make it that'll make it easier to preach this morning to have my my children looking at me um I want to take advantage of Father's Day this morning you know sometimes when I preach I don't really gear the the sermon necessarily toward the holiday um but today I want to I want to talk about my heavenly father so let's uh uh let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we read the scripture and Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather it around here today gather around your word Lord Jesus and Lord as we know this morning your people have some have driven for a long way and we've all gathered here today not to look at one another and not to see the minister not to see Lord anybody in particular Lord but we're come to see you Lord Jesus and Lord does he look into your word I ask Lord that you'll just open up the scriptures to us so that we can open to open up our eyes of Faith so that we can see you Lord and Lord we might have Elders this morning that are needing needing something in their body and needing answers and needing heal the Lord and we might have the young people who are needing Direction in your life Lord and all the different needs Lord that we have Lord I pray Lord that you'll give Lord Give Me Liberty to speak Lord and Lord open the ears of the here Lord that they might receive exactly what they have need of this morning and just bless us Lord and feel that Liberty to move Among Us Lord and sweep down the owl o God and Quicken the word of your people we ask this blessing in your name amen now Genesis chapter 15 verse 12 to 14 uh we'll kind of talk about a promise and and then go to Exodus 14. Genesis 15 12 reads like this and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo and horror of great Darkness fell upon him and he said unto Abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they serve will I judge and afterwards shall they come out with great substance my what a promise and over there in Exodus chapter 14 if we kind of flip over a chapter and read from verse 13. I'll give you just a moment to flip the pages and in verse 13 it says and I'll be patient a little longer I'm ready to go in verse 13 it says and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore Christ thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward but lift out thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading the word I I I I I want to just kind of remind us as we were just read in Genesis chapter 15 that that God promised Abraham that his children were going to be uh sojourners down in the wilderness for 400 uh sojourners in Egypt for 400 years and he gave them my promise to bring them out and Moses got to that place there where he was standing at the Red Sea and he began to cry out to God in the time of trouble that and brother Brown said and God rebuked Moses back right when trouble was in session and it's just nature seeming like for a person to cry out and then water rebuke it is for God to turn around and rebuke him for saying it for crying out to him it looks like it's a very hard thing you know because God wants us to believe and when we get sometimes we'll get into a situation in life where it looks like he can't go back and can't go forward and looks like a real tough spot and God LED Moses right into that place where he he began to God at Moses began to question the purpose of God and you know you read about it in Hebrews chapter 11 where where Paul told us that without faith you can't even please God God wants somebody to trust him so now I want to think today that on this Father's Day on this Father's Day every every good father wants his children to trust him to believe to believe his word to have confidence in him and you know that's what any good father wants he wants to be it when he says something he wants his children to believe him to have confidence that that the word that he says is true that that he's going to stand behind every how can you even how can you have trust in any man if he's not going to back up the things that he says and so that's what I want to say this morning that I believe that we have a God that we've got a father that we can trust when he says anything he's going to back up his word he doesn't just say something to just to say something vain say something that where these words are going to fall to the ground but he's going to back up his promises I I got to looking online just to kind of see an example you know in the Civil War they come up with this uh this term called a deadbeat a deadbeat is somebody that they're just so deadbeat they're just laying laying there and good for nothing and they and they won't uh that they won't get up and get job or anything and you start thinking about what a deadbeat dad is I I looked online to see what a definition of what a deadbeat dad would be and the number one definition of a deadbeat dad is somebody that won't fulfill their promises they make a promise and they won't stand behind it and you know like maybe maybe the father if you look through your go back through your life and think about maybe as many examples that you come across and a deadbeat dad was somebody that will say well I'm never going to leave you and then they don't show up they're they're gone somewhere they'll promise their their spouse well I'm going to stand behind you through thick or thin as soon as something bad comes along then they they turn up missing but you know they maybe they'll say I'll always be there for you for their children they'll say I'm going to be there for your ball game I'm going to show up I'm gonna I'm gonna be there for you but they won't they make all these empty promises or they'll say maybe I'll I'll never forsake you I'm I'm gonna always be on your side I'll be your comfort because you know that's what a father is supposed to be a father's supposed to be somebody that you can turn to and when things get by at a comforting time a problem somebody that you can run to and get some advice and get some counsel but you see this morning I don't believe that we're serving a deadbeat dead I don't believe that we're serving a father that backs down from his promises I believe that we've got somebody that when when we need somebody to talk to we can in the dead of night when everything's going wrong if you don't know which way to turn and you begin to cry out and you don't even know how to pray you've got somebody that can answer back I thank God for God like that thank God that we serve a God who is not a deadbeat dad and this morning I think it I think it's such a privilege to be able to talk about my heavenly father to be able to talk about the God that I serve them we're not just coming to church to feel a church pew that we're not just coming to church just to look at one another but we have a God that we can serve who will back up his word oh oh you think about that you're real a real father is there from the very beginning the the in Romans chapter 8 it says for many as they're led by the spirit of God they are sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you ever see the spirit of adoption whereby we cry I'm a father and you know you you think when you first when you come first come forth from the Matrix now I'm talking spiritual now not natural but the first thing you start looking for is your daddy you come forth crying for your father you want to see your father and the first thing you see is your father's face because he reveals himself to you and you begin to come into relationship with him you begin to know who your God is and who your daddy is I thank God for a gospel that will take us to a relationship with God not just the relationship with man or the letters on the page but love relationship with the living reality of who God is I started looking online to all these examples of what a real father is and this there's this website online called the fatherhood commission and they say that there's seven roles of a father that a father's got to be a provider I provide a father is going to be a protector a father is going to be a leader a father is going to be a teacher a father is going to be a helper a father is going to be an encourager and a father is going to be a friend oh I thank God that we've got a father who fulfills all those roles and when we look into the word we see the promises of all those roles that we can cling to in time of need and time of trouble that he's a provider because Philippians says that my God shall supply all your need according to his riches and Glory by Christ Jesus Oh I thank God that we've got that kind of a promise that we can lean on that we can turn to in time of trouble that when you when you can't pay the bills and when things begin to go wrong then you got somebody you got a scripture that you can lay in front of him and say God you promised it you're the one that said I thank God this morning that we're not we're not leaning upon the words of a man we're not leaning upon the words of some man that's a man's theological idea but we're leaning on the words that came straight from the Throne of Grace he's our protector because the Bible says in Psalms 121 The Lord Is Thy keeper the Lord is thou shade upon thy right hand the son shall not smite thee by day nor the mood By Night the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil he's my helper because it says God is our refuge and strength a very present help in time of trouble now brother Brandon said they didn't judge Jehovah Jireh he said as long as you have the promise of God that says it regardless of what circumstances looked like believe it anyhow for God said so I think I think that's that's what I'm preaching on this morning that when it beyond all this the circumstance we're we're oh we're not looking at things while they're natural eye but we're looking like Abraham the things that we cannot be seen we're looking to the to another realm for our faith and brother Brandon said if you are the children of Abraham not the children of the church now the children of the denomination but the children of Abraham you believe God's promises every one of them regardless of what someone else would say about it you believe his promises are true I believe that's something that every real child of Abraham should be able to do is to look look straight in the face of God's promises and say I believe it I believe it because you said it if God said it I believe it and that settles it I believe it I want to think now in Hebrews chapter 6 that Paul told us that God willingly more abundantly to show under the air as it promised the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that God the god that cannot lie wanted us to believe his word so much that he come behind it and swore an oath on top of that the god oh to think about that this morning that the god that cannot lie a God that cannot say something is false swore an oath on top of it so that you will know that the Seed of Abraham will possess the Gate of your enemies so that you know that you will be a blessing God Abraham's seed will be a blessing everywhere throughout all the world in your church at your work that you will be a blessing all these promises that we have access to that in Matthew chapter 4 24 he said Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away that when God said it you can hang everything on it he said I'll be a father unto you and he shall be my sons and daughters he said life is a father pityth his children so the Lord pityth him that fear Him oh a father is good oh that's what makes a father good is when he keeps his promises that's what that was that's what makes a father good is when he keeps his promises when he keeps his word and our father does not forget his promises our father is going to back up every word that he said everything that he promised everything everything that he said because he is a good god and a good god a good father keeps his word and wisdom versus Faith he said he is a good god and the only way I can trust him to be a good God that he will stay with his word how can you expect me to be truthful when I'm not truthful if you tell one thing do something else my word is pretty shaky though what makes him a good God is because he spoke the word and we're to live by that word oh now in the story of of why Christ Christ speaking God God gives us life experiences a lot of times that we can look back on look back on to build our faith to build our faith to a place where we get into a situation like Moses was there on the on on the shore of that red sea he's got all these experiences back in him up that he can look back to and say I I remember I remember when you were here were there for me in this case and I remember when you were there for me in this case and it all builds up what's God is building and building our total and complete trust in him so that we oh what's he doing he's building up our faith until we can believe for the impossible God wants us to believe for the impossible it doesn't matter what the situation is that God wants us to believe it because he promised it I believe in a god that is a god of circumstance he's a god of no matter what the circumstance is no matter what the situation is if your children ever left home if your wife or your spouse have left home if things are going wrong it'll work I believe in a God that can fix things I believe oh I believe in a miracle working God I still believe in that God that can change things you know you go back and listen to the message Paradox and he said that you are you are a miracle that's why you can believe in miracles because you are a miracle and God changed your life and you can look back and remember how God got a hold of your life and change you and you ain't the way that you used to be and that kind of a person you can look at the situation and say I know that God is still a miracle working God he caused a miracle in my life and I ate the same and I I've Been Changed oh that's what we're looking for when we come to church we're looking for change and I I believe in a God that can change things I believe when things get bad that God can make it good I believe when you get down in the valley that God can lift you up oh remember remember church I think it tastes good sometimes to rehearse our experiences to go to go back and look and it's good to testify and to rehearse you remember when they came when they finally come over the Red Sea they came over to the promised land they erected those 12 Stones and they you know oh you think about how the children of Israel as their children got older they could take them back to those 12 Stones and as they got older and the years went by they could keep going back to those stones and say I remember I remember my maybe my grandparents or whoever crossed across the Red Sea they were there I remember when they come across I remember when they went through these experiences and well how did they come across they were following the word that was carried on the backs of the of the priest I remember all you think oh you think all the things that we can look back on in our own lives they should build our faith to remember remember when God sent a prophet maybe some of the older ones sitting here were sitting in the in the campaign meetings when brother and I spoke and maybe you didn't understand what he was speaking it begin to God began to deal with you and you begin to realize that it was this was just more than just a healing campaign that there was a message coming forth and maybe then he he passed away and people began to be in turmoil all remember this morning church remember when people Begin to Fall Away Back in 1970 seven because he didn't understand things but God was God he said that he promised that he would the spirit of Truth would lead guide you into all truth and you kept hanging on you kept hanging on with the word oh won't you remember how God give you the Holy Ghost and God kept dealing with you oh and you maybe you had a problem in the dead of night and your wife had a problem and you laid your hands over honor and God came on the scene and touched her oh these are things to remember this is what those stones that were resurrected on their said to the Red Sea were for to remember remember what God did for you oh you'd have to agree this morning that Moses Moses was born into a family that trusted and believed God and this gave Moses when he was standing there on the Red Sea it gave him a lot of things to look back on and remember it was a time of for a deliverer and his his mother and father they began to pray exactly according to the scripture oh I'm telling you these things because these are things that Moses could look back on and remember because Jacobin told him later she she would relay these things to him oh I remember I remember how we were praying for a deliverer I remember it was time we knew it was time to come out how did they know it was time to come out because they could look back into the word of a prophet and when you look back into the word of a prophet what the prophet said you can know that it's time to go free oh when you read the word you can know that you could come out of whatever your situation is if you've got depression this morning if you've got a problem in your life there's a promise laying here in the scripture that you could come out you don't have to stay in the situation that you're in why because God promised and we've got confidence in our father that he's not a deadbeat God a deadbeat dad a father that won't back up his promises oh you think about amram and Jacob better begin to pray their prayers were exactly with the scripture their prayers was with the promised word brother Raymond said oh well how could they listen church I believe I believe that if you I believe what the Bible says that I you have not because you ask not and many times we many times what do we do we fail to realize that God's promises are true we begin to kind of rationalize it in our mind well it was for that person over there but I don't know my situations may be different my situations oh I believe church this morning and a God who who you can you can hang everything on he's a god of unbroken promises he's a God that will back up his word and I believe that prayer still changes things I believe that when you come in faith asking God and laying before him the word that he's already spoken something is going to happen I believe in my I take 25 years it might take a hundred years like Noah it might take a long time but God is going to do something why because he backs up his word he is a god of promises oh you're thinking of the hour of death they fed their children to feed and chill all they were feeding the children of the crocodiles and amram and Joker bed didn't they weren't afraid of Pharaoh's command to kill the children and what they do they turned Moses over to God all you see we've got that promise that if you you've got maybe a child that you don't know what to do with if I'll just turn him over to God God knows how to do with deal with things in this situation God as many times we know we'll get our hands all over the situation and we're just mess it up when we get our hands but if we'll back up and just let God do it and say God I know this you're a God that you promised us that if we'll cast all our care upon you he he cares for us you promised us that if we'll take if we'll take if we'll just get yoked up with you like two oxen we get yoked up with him then he'll carry our burdens and he'll carry us through and brother Adam said he had been taught he had been taught by his mama that he was going to be the deliverer and his mama maybe told him and said Moses when you were a little baby your father amram when he was working in the brick key on he'd pray every night all night long God's sin to deliver oh I I wonder if you ever heard this quote he said one night in a vision upstairs he's seen a great angel stand with a sword and pointing North and said I'm ready to take the people out and I conceived you Moses right under the threat of pharaoh and I hid you in the bull rush and right amongst the Gators that was fat upon the babies of Egypt but God delivered you and you were a proper child when you were born you were born to be a prophet Moses you are God's servant oh my I thank God for a positive message this morning oh you think about joche bed he's right there in the middle of all the Egyptians and she's just she said she ain't telling him that he's stupid and worthless she ain't beating him down and telling him he ain't nothing but she's speaking Apostles she's got a positive message for him and this morning I I believe I've got a positive message for the bride of Christ I believe that if we can confess our father's promises it's a positive promise that we're confessing I'm glad for a gospel this morning that doesn't beat us down and put us back in bondage but a gospel that lift us out of the situation that are in the middle take us out it'll it'll give us Deliverance I'm reminded this morning when Jesus Took The Scroll of Isaiah there in the 10 people and he unfolded and began to identify himself in the scripture he began to read that that this he was sent to preach the Liberty the captives to open doors to them that are bound and I I I think this morning also if you know Peter and John they're on the uh at the gate beautiful and they begin to preacher they began to talk to that man laying a firm on the side of the road and they began to tell him they began to tell him we don't have any money we don't have any silver and gold but such as I have I give unto you and I believe we can have that same confession this morning that we don't have popularity or we don't have money or programs or soup suppers and all those those things but I I believe we've got something this morning to preach that'll do the same thing today that it did 2 000 years ago we've got something to give Liberty to the captive to the Liberty to those that are bound that'll break the prison change and break the doors off of your captivity you know something there's something that'll get you out just like it got Peter out when he was bound there in the prison oh you think jochebed could speak words or promise words are promise words that you've got value Moses oh Moses had value all right and I wanted to clear to you this morning that you've got value too oh you remember brother Ryan preached that sermon he cares he cares do you care Oh The Gospel message that he cares about your situation no matter what your situation is this morning God cares about oh to think this morning that brother Brown said that your soul is worth ten thousand worlds to God oh you know it ought to think about that this morning I I think it would be a great thing to say that my soul was worth One World then my soul would be worth one worth or that my soul would be what would work be worth one solar system but to think this morning that your soul is worth ten thousand of these hours still we're standing on that's what kind of value that you have to God also this morning maybe if the devil's got you beat down and thinking that God don't care about you anymore well I've got news for you God still cares and maybe you're old and maybe you're getting weak in your body and you begin to think that nobody cares and your children don't call home but God still cares maybe maybe a young person and you think that your parents don't understand you and the bullies at school and understand you nobody cares about you but God still cares I think that was the message that jacobed was telling to Moses when he was a little child that God cares about you and you got value oh what a great thing that is this morning that your father in Heaven thinks that you've got value God wants to do something with your life God wants to take your life and do something with you God has raised you up for a purpose giacombe would tell Moses God has a plan for you God is going to use you oh to think about this morning think about what your plan is Paul told us in Romans Romans what I plan God's plan for us is for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren oh to think about that this morning that God predestinated through that purpose to be conformed into the image of a holy God to live a holy life oh what does that mean this for us this morning friends that means that you can walk just like Jesus did that you can talk just like Jesus did that he'll transform transform your mind so that you think like Jesus did transform your mind what so that you don't think the impossible was do you begin to think that they're possible impossible is possible you begin to think that all those things that the the world maybe a lot of other other preachers and so forth have told you it's been possible but yet oh you looked right to the word of God and it tells you that things are impossible or impossible that God will back up his word and his word that he's the word is preached it ain't gonna just fall to the ground and not accomplish this purpose all to think this morning church that God is looking for some good ground for his word to fall in all this to think this morning he's looking for somebody that'll open up the door of their heart and say I believe that and when somebody opens up the door or God can do something God will do some than with you when God when you open up the door and say God use me I want to open up every door in my heart I want you to be Lord of my life I want you to take take me over I want you to be I want to be so captive to your will until you can do something with me oh to think this morning if you want to find out that God's will for your life if you could just go back to the word back to God's promises back to what God said about you and you'll find out what God wants wants for your life oh to think this morning I'm reminded of in First Kings chapter 13 a prophet just came out of nowhere and began to prophesy he he prophecy he cried against the altar in the word of the Lord and said oh altar thus saith the Lord Behold a child shall be born into the house of David Josiah by name and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incidents upon thee and men's bone shall be burnt upon thee and 350 years later in second Kings chapter 22 a little boy named Josiah was born and began to be ruling at the age of eight years old and oh you think about how that young boy must have pulled the scripture off of the uh off the off the shelves on the wall and begin to pour through those those things that have been said about him 350 years later and was able to identify himself in the scripture scripturally where he would be scripturally what he would do because why is the promises of God that give us confidence it's the promises of God that build our faith when you can look back in the Bible and begin to see that all these things that God said about David it's really identifying my life I've gone through the same Journey that David went through I've gone through the same Journey that Abraham went through I've gone through this I've gone through the same Journey that he went through oh thank God this morning that was a type of me not the other way around round and it was a type of me the life that I'm living oh to think that this you look into the scripture and you'll get oh it'll build your confidence that's what I'm talking about when you oh coming to church this morning is not in vain coming to church and just going to church every day every Sunday every Wednesday night it's not in vain but it's it's accomplishing a purpose in your life it's doing something in you it's God building up his faith when you to where you can believe for all things all things are possible and in the belief I ought to think this morning that that was brother Brown's theme song all those years but do we really believe it do we really believe it or are we like Sarah giggling in the tent when when when Jesus when God outside the tents given the promise do we giggle within ourselves and say for me for me is it can it be true for me in my situation I want to declare to you this morning that it can be true why because we've got a father who who will back up every promise that he said God wants somebody to agree with what he's already said oh to think about this morning that God cares about his people hey you don't want him to see in bondage to the devil he cared enough this morning to die on the cross for yo do you think you know sometimes I like to preach on these little these little stories that brother I'm told that maybe sometimes we just it seems like we just hear over and over and over again and maybe it loses the emphasis like that little story of the of the apostle that one day he was he he was praying for other people and all of a sudden this little pot tore up looking little opossum with mamas on his back come walking up to the door and lay down on the steps and everybody everybody was saying well let's just put it down uh what I'm getting at is oh you think you ain't got no value but if that little possum had value to God that brother Brown prayed over and God healed that thing oh what what kind of value do you have sitting here this morning that God would tell you what take such care for a little possum that he said it was laying unconscious green flies all over his shoulder broken out laying there suffering and dying you think about something that everybody just wanted to put down isn't that sometimes hell people want to just like just give up on people in the church just give up on somebody that can't live right but God sees that are you in your life he said I walked out there and said God if you were merciful enough to deal with a done out dumb animal who was God lady enough about it to raise her babies in Jesus name I pray all you think about God's grace that God cares if God cares for a little possum how much more does he care about you if God cares about a little fishy that laying there with his insides turned out and brother Adam would stand up in the boat led by the spirit of God to say little fishy I'll give you back your life if he cares enough about a little fishy laying there in the water with the bubble bubbles and all the slime all around it oh brother Bob what are you getting at I'm talking about maybe you're in the Brick Kiln this morning maybe maybe you're on that sheep like job maybe maybe you're just in a situation where it looks like oh hope is gone but God what's God doing he's giving you a background he's giving you he's building up your face so one day you can look back at this situation that you're in right now and say you were with me then I know that you'll still be with me now and why can't we look back at all those times that God has brought us all those situations you remember this morning remember when you had a need and God came on the scene remember the little things remember when you lost your car keys or you lost your wallet or somebody stole it from you and God brought it back remember those times when God come on the scene oh Moses could look back Moses could remember brother I'm said in that message why Christ speak he said all the background just keeps up all the background oh you think about your background heaping up this is going to happen this is going to happen this is going to happen then it accumulates together and draws a picture for us oh draws a picture for us that we can believe we can really believe God and we've got a God that we can just we can just have total confidence in total complete confidence in man brother I'm in a spiritual food in due season he said hold to think about this now he said I want you to get you built up now I want to get you built up now in this holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of this hour the faith it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be Rapture in faith to be taken up and so we want you to believe tonight and all that you have seen heard the word that you have heard preached the signs and wonders that you have seen done oh now listen Here's the Clincher we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether if that be God or not oh to think this morning that all these things as we come to church day week after week year after year all the way all the way back to the beginning when you were first born again all the what's happening is you're building up you're accumulating your faith the word is accumulating you're building up something and the power of the devil brother I said oh if we could only accumulate that kind of Faith tonight get that kind of faith and living among us mainly moving in our beings moving through the church not just the emotional Faith but a real Solid Faith it won't take no foreign oh that's the kind of faith we what we need tonight this morning church is the faith that will don't take no for an answer to how you're going to get that Faith by as you accumulate the word as you hear the word oh it's building up within you it's building up where what's building up the promises of God you're you're storing up all these promises the promises are piling up within you until your son begins to take place you begin to realize that it is true that God is a miracle-working God that God still is the god that keeps his promises I want to declare to you this morning you're going to accumulate something in your life I remember that time brother Brown preached he said he said I don't like to talk about this but you know people sometimes will accumulate complaints they'll come to church and they start accumulating complaints and complaints and you're going to have a oh you come to church and you're going to have a lot of things that you can complain about there's a lot of things that you can point your finger at but he said what will happen is you start accumulating complaints and complaints and complaints until you just turn oh what do you turn into you turn into somebody that's Satan will just Crown your life a good old complainer that they can't can't deal when somebody pulls out in front of you can't deal with somebody don't give you the right change in the supermarket you're just a complainer because oh but I don't want to build up those kind of things I want to build up Faith I want to build up love oh there's things you could build up bitterness to one another you can build up things where you just you just start holding resentments because somebody said something to you years ago oh but oh if we can just let those things go let it go oh if you really study our faith you'll find out that forgiveness is actually connected to Faith that you got to forgive to be able to believe right oh you've got to love to be able to believe right how can you love God if you don't believe it how can you believe God if you don't love him and if you if you say you really love God and you don't love your brother and sister how could you love God who you haven't seen uh when you when you can't love your brother and sister who you have seen forgiveness forgiveness is connected to Faith because Jesus said if you forgive me in their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you forgive not man their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses oh so let's accumulate the good and let's just lay up lay the lay the bad to the side that's what Paul told us in Hebrews chapter 12 let us lay aside every weight and the sin was just so easily beset us oh hold church I'm trying to get bad really the bad I'm trying to get rid of all the trash all the things in my life that weigh me down and anything that's going to keep me from going on with God I I want to cast it to the side lay aside all those weights and just build up build up what I want to accumulate love I want to accumulate faith I want to accumulate Joy I want to accumulate peace I want to accumulate goodness I want those things to stack up in my life until until all that's left it's not me anymore but crushed only Christ to live oh I was preaching last Wednesday night at our church on perfect Faith perfect faith faith is perfected in your weakness and when you get to a place where you just realize that oh you're weak within yourself and you begin to lay aside everything that's when God can do something for you oh I just want to accumulate the word accumulate Faith how are we doing it precept upon precept line upon line here a little there a little in First Peter chapter two it says ye also his Lively stones are built up of spiritual how ought to think that God is building he's building up a temple that he can dwell in he's building up our lives and building up our lives word upon word here a little there little oh that's why we can say this morning that coming to church is not in vain coming to church that the word that you hear is actually having an effect on your life it's actually the word is actually claim but what's happening when you hear the word as you hear the word the word is claiming it's taking possession of you oh you look back in your life remember remember when first somebody told you that you needed to be baptized and you battled it out until God finally spoke to you and told you the truth of how to be baptized and you went into the water and the word claims your life it took possession of you oh somebody told you you got to be born born again and maybe they laid it out to you how to be how to be born again and how all these things work and you begin to you begin to cry and you begin to seek God and what was it the word taking possession of your life it's moving you moving you on and on with God what is it the promises are being fulfilled in your life something Supernatural is happening in your life as you hear the word something Supernatural is taking place oh oh Church we're not just here just to fill up church pew or paid our tithes to keep the lights on we're not here just to pay the parking light bill or we're here to for the word of God to be made manifest in you oh aren't you glad this morning church to have a background aren't you glad this morning that you can look back at all the things that God has done in your life aren't you glad that you got a story like Moses did to give you faith in the hour away you can look back oh if he was the god of yesterday he still looks same yesterday today and forever if he was the god of back then he's he's still the same today whatever your trials is or whatever your troubles are he's still the same oh to think if you didn't go if you didn't go through all those trials all those things that you can look back on you wouldn't be able to praise him like you can now if you didn't go through all those situations you wouldn't be able to know him like you did now you wouldn't be able to worship him like you do now and Moses had all this background Moses had all that background where he could trust Jacobus testimony and one day he met that burning bush he met that burning bush where God spoke to him out of the pillar of Fire and said I am the god of thy father old church is one thing to hear from man but it changes everything when you hear from God I'm talking about this morning hearing from your papa oh you think about that story where Billy Paul told about how he walked outside of the prayer room when his dad was praying and he heard him calling out to God calling out Paul pop of God old Papa God whole to think this morning church said one day one day you you might have heard a lot of people telling you about the message and telling you about scripture and telling you all these things but when one day one day you met God you met your papa you met your father and you began to really know him the power of his resurrection brother Adam said he's seeking not something he read about but something he's seen with his eyes something that spoke back to him and he spoke back to you at oh how that did bring things to life oh you can realize like brother Adam said one time he said I come to the realization that I'm not the child of Charles and Ella Branham that that I I always found out who was real daddy was oh and you found out who your real daddy is and you find out begin you you begin to have you're the same characteristics the same thought the same life oh beginning you begin to realize oh you take a DNA test and it'll show you who your daddy is you look into the word and it's like getting a DNA test where you can find out who your real daddy is oh when you begin to be identified with a scripture and look into the scripture and see that it identifies you that you really are called of God oh Moses knew who his daddy was or can we say that to this morning church said oh we know who our daddy is and when you know who your daddy is that oh and you can hold that token up over your prayer and say I know who my daddy is oh something's got to happen when you can say I'm identified by the same life the same life that was that was shed on the cross for me that same life that was shed on Calvary I'm identified that for that this morning you can hold that over your prayer and claim every promise that's what I'm talking about this morning church said every promise is for you every promise in the Bible is mine if you could claim it and believe it oh when you've heard from your father well what confidence he gave Moses in that hour when he finally heard from his daddy when he finally realized that God was backing him up when he finally realized that God was backing up his ministry that God was backing up his prayer that God would back up his actions because God's promises were behind him oh you think this morning if you when you've heard from your father no devil can stop you oh to think this morning oh let me just Express this to the church you don't have to make a deal with the Devil right many times we'll think well well I just I just I guess I just got to deal with this oh oh that's what we battle out church we the promises of God are just laying there in front of us and we can just if we can just grab that promise God said it God said it if you can believe it but we'll think well well I've just been in this situation so long I I just ready to go to the doctor and let the doctor work it out because we think the promises are not for us but the promises are for you because God cared enough about for you for to die on the cross for his promises he saw enough value in you to give these promises to you he saw enough let me tell you he cared enough about you for you for him to send fivefold Ministry to the church to preach to you he cared enough about it for for a minute for it to sin God called ministers to labor and give up their own time and lay down their lives and study so that you could have so that they could preach these promises to you oh he cared enough these promises are for you oh we begin to think well I would like to put the the man at the pool of Bethesda I've been laying here for 38 years 38 years 38 years but yeah he hung on it was 38 years but he was still hanging on to the promises of God that woman with the issue with 12 years 12 years she hang on but yet on that day when it really counted she said I believe if I can just touch the hymn of His Garment and she crawled through the crowd until she reached out why because she knew if she could get to Jesus that man born black born blind from birth and one day he met the one that could fulfill the promise all you think about Congressman Upshaw falling off of that fallen off of that bail that that wagon when he was a little child and 56 years later oh you think you think today this morning church that the promises of God are passed me that it's not really for me but you don't have to make a deal with the devil and say well I'll just live like this you don't have to take nothing from the devil listen I believe the devil's been given enough problems to the bride all the year I believe it's time that we can give something back to him we could trouble the devil a little bit how are you going to trouble the devil you stand by faith believe oh you're going to stand for something you might as well stand for the word you might as well stand and say I'm going to believe God's worth no matter what's no matter what else comes listen this morning church I I believe that it's possible because all things are possible it's possible for you to be healed it's possible for you to be saved it's possible for you to be delivered oh this there is nothing Out Of Reach there is oh if if the statement the statement all things are possible means that there is nothing impossible oh to think this morning that that very first sermon that brother Brandon preached was talking about something impossible that we think is impossible to be able to look at something hanging from the from the ceiling to be able to move it by faith or to think that God can take your pocket knife that's in your dresser at home and if it ain't if it ain't in your pocket he can put it there foreign for somebody else but not for me but I want to maybe look look back in your own life and remember those times when you pray for something and God put it where it wasn't it wasn't supposed to be oh oh surely as we look across the congregation there's testimonies in your own life where you've seen that come to pass where you seeing God fulfill his promises and now if God can do it back then surely he's still the same God oh you see what the preaching of the Gospel does is it builds our faith as word upon word is being built up and surely even sitting here this morning you can feel your face begin to rise like brother and when he was talking about and looking to the Unseen he said can't you feel that pulsating within your heart what is it it's a deep call into the deep a deep knowing that there's a God that's out there somewhere that can fulfill his promises my Father in Heaven promised it and if he promised it he's able to bring it to pass and it's not Out Of Reach it's not Out Of Reach like the devil's trying to put in our minds that it's Saturday it's not Out Of Reach ask and you shall receive you don't have because you don't ask ask abundantly that your joy may be full if the promises laying there in the word then you've got a right to ask for it you've got to write to it because God promised it oh now now brother Brian will say he said I don't I can't promise you a rose guard and I can't promise you that life is going to be a flower a bit of ease I can't promise it ain't going to be no heartaches and no troubles and everything but I I can promise it when heartaches come that there's a father in Heaven that can you can turn to that'll be your comforter that'll be your leader that'll be your God it'll be your help somebody that you can turn to and somebody that you could turn to to get you out of the situation to know that that's just for uh but for a season you might be on the ass sheep you might be in the OR on in the brick here and wherever you are but there's a God that you can turn to because there is nothing Out Of Reach there is nothing that is not possible oh let me let me just testify a little bit I began I was walking outside the other Friday it was Friday I was walking around my uh taking a walk down the yard just thinking upon these things and I began to think about how many things in our life we just kind of we just kind of let the devil beat us up and tell us that well well it's it's beyond your reach it's beyond you might as well not even ask for it because all your humanity and all these things of life and I began to think about how we've we've got promises that we can have access to and I started thinking that thinking about all the things in my life that oh wow just rolling through why don't you ask God about that one thing I began to think about is that for the last 10 years I worked from home and I need internet to be able to work from home and I began at the last 10 years I've been struggling with I don't have internet running to my house and I've been struggling trying to get people to the the internet company to run the line to my house and I've I've paid extra money I've gone over them to see over and over and over again to try to get them to set up internet with my house and the last time I was down there a few months ago at the office they told me I'm sorry they put it in the system and they said they're not even going to be able to get to it until the next of the year and we don't even know when they're going to be get to it and so I always you start thinking well it's just it's impossible I don't know what to do but I began to think God you are the god of the impossible and I begin to just ask him as I walked along I began to say God I know that you're you're a prayer friends from God and I just ask the Lord that you'll just take this situation and and do something with it you can you can move on the scene I I come back from my little walk and I walked in the door and it wasn't just a few more minutes that I got a phone call on my phone and it was about eight o'clock at night and I said who who is this could be calling me and I picked up the phone and it was the internet company and the man said you are the last call on my list tonight I didn't know if I'd be able to get to you but I just wanted to tell you that they're going to be in because construction next week and I I hung up the phone and I said oh God surely you are a prince prayer entry God you you are the god of the impossible and I just want to Echo that to you if God can do he's the god of the little things and the god of the big things and everything if it seems like it's past our reach past past anything oh God is the god of the impossible almost certainly this morning our faith can be built up to believe that all you think this morning of all the things that maybe you think are Out Of Reach in your life all the things that you think you think are past past anybody be able to do anything oh that's certainly that's certainly a good candidate for you to turn that over on God cast that kind of care over on God cast the impossible things over on God and watch him work the impossible in Mark chapter 10 Jesus looking upon Him saith with men it is impossible but not with God for With God all things are possible all things are possible to them that believe all things are possible oh oh to think this morning I I'm running out of time I'll be closing here in just a minute Satan doesn't have to disprove the Bible he just has to get you to reasonably doubt something he just has to get you the reason oh to think about people say Reasonable Doubt but there ain't nothing reasonable about doubt there ain't nothing reasonable about it well you think well it's just it's a reasonable doubt to expect that whatever this probably just won't work in this case in this case that I'm living in it just won't work or you're just a little bit too sick you're just a little bit there's just a little bit too much sin in your life oh but look at all these examples in the Bible too much sin in your life look at Rahab on that wall look at look at look at Ruth come out of Moab that brother around said was like a hair gaggy thing a hair in the biscuit look at all these situations where people in The Quagmire are seeing but it wasn't it wasn't past it wasn't impossible oh if you can trust your daddy there is nothing impossible nothing is impossible this morning I'll close on that this this morning as the musicians come that I can do all things through Christ I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me anything different anything different to think about this this morning anything different is a lie of the devil oh the devil wants to tell you it's just reasonable but that is a lie of the devil anything different is a lie of the devil and you are called to resist the devil all things are possible to them that believe all things are possible nothing is impossible to him that believeth oh and Moses come to that place where he began to he began to that place of of the junction time he began to cry out to God and God told him what are you crying for speak oh God wants us to speak you know brother Ram said in the greatest battle ever fall he said you come out of the egg speaking you come out of the egg like a little Eagle speaking and that's what God wants us to do this morning speak with us speak what God's word says speak his promise he's the one that made the promise and if God made the promise he can back at a God made it aren't you glad this morning that I didn't make the promise your pastor didn't make the promise brother Branham didn't make the promise God's the one that made the promise and if our heavenly father made the promise then he's a good God and able to keep his word aren't you glad that this morning oh this morning as we as we just go to prayer I want you to maybe meditate on all those things in your life that you think are impossible the devil's been telling you all this time that it's past it's past the roots of any man Pastor maybe you look in the Bible and you read about how other people have been blessed and you hear testimonies and you think well that was for them but maybe not for me that's if there's any message I want to deliver and leave to it we do this morning that is for you that if you can believe it that all things are possible that God can restore those lost children God can restore that lost wallet God can do it he can do it he can do it like he got on God on the scene and got the internet company to call me at 8 30 in the evening after they had already closed I was the last call on his list and he called why because God moved on the scene let's go the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful tonight that we've got a god when we pray to we can have confidence Lord we've got a prayer answering God we've got somebody like Paul said we've got somebody that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities we've got a God that cares oh we've got to call it like Paul said it come boldly to the throne of grace and tonight Lord Jesus with all the different needs here in the congregation Lord Jesus Lord we lay our knees at your feet and we come boldly to the throne of grace Lord Jesus knowing that we've got a reason to be bold because we know who our daddy is we know who our God is we know where our father is Lord Jesus we hold the token over our prayer Lord God knowing Lord Jesus that you hear our prayer Lord God and you'll answer back because you promised it if we ask anything according to your word not frivolously not Upon Our Own lust it about it that we might consuming upon our lust but Lord we ask Lord based upon the scripture like amram and Jacob did when they begin call out knowing that it was a time for a deliverer Lord Jesus we lord we just lay our knees at your feet oh God we thank you Lord God for your promises Lord I pray Lord that you'll just be with the remainder of the service and Lord as we go our separate ways Lord God this afternoon Lord I pray that you'll continue to be with this church and strengthen the pasture Lord God and help him with his knees and help this church Lord be with all the ministers and the deacons and the trustees and the elders Lord God and I pray Lord that you'll just continue to pour out your spirit Lord upon this little assembly Lord bless him Lord God and we know that you will because it's written in your word Lord we have access to your promises we thank you Lord God amen [Music] he knows my everything [Music] [Applause] [Music] he knows my name foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] mine is [Music] [Music] [Applause] wow say that backwards wow do you know we commonly understand that the term Jehovah Jireh means the Lord our provider and it does that's what it means but the but the beauty of that Hebrew connection of speech there Jehovah Jireh is how God provides Jehovah Jireh literally means God sees and we'll see to it I I tell the devil that all the time the devil tries to make me doubt I say God sees and God will see to it my I was right in the middle brother close so quickly I was right in the middle of writing a note I could not possibly forget I have never thought about resist the devil remember remember where that starts submit yourselves to God you know because no one's ever successfully resisted the devil who didn't first submit themselves to God submit yourselves to God resist the devil and he will flee from you and I never thought to apply that in all my life brother Bob never thought to apply that that when God gives a promise like Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe and the devil wants to challenge that it's up to me to be the resistance right you're in a resistance movement when the devil wants to you need you need to be David you need to be the man in whose ears Goliath challenge fell and brother Brown said he made that challenge and made that challenge and everything was all right he said but finally that challenge fell in the ears of the wrong man oh and David wasn't going to have that David stepped forward to say no just a second my God we Deliver us hallelujah oh my goodness I you know I I thought about so much the brother was saying that you know it reminded me of brother Abraham when he was here and taught us you know that very same thing that you don't have to make a deal with the Devil you don't have to do that because we don't live by the mercies of Lucifer in that wonderful we don't live by the mercies of Lucifer I don't need his permission and I don't need a treaty and I don't need an Armistice I don't even want one I want to fight amen I want to I want to prove that he's a liar and God's word is true and the Lord has so designed it that you will be the evidence of his of his honesty and his Integrity think about that Psalms teaches us that children are the heritage of the Lord happy is the man who hath his quiver full of them see because the father that's a court case remember he said his his children will will uh will they'll fight with the enemies in the gate the gate was the courtroom the father had been falsely accused that he wasn't a decent man wasn't a good father and the father never had to open his mouth never had to defend himself because his children stepped forward and contended with the enemy in the court and the and the Hebrew shows it was a victorious that they were willing to say you think our father was no good then look at us then tell pray tell how did we get to be a righteous family oh and the case was was proven that the father who never had to defend himself was he was proven to be true because why his children contended victoriously with the enemies in the gate oh I'm not supposed to be preaching brother but oh oh man wow oh I I thought about how that you know it's good it's brother Bob said it's good to rehearse the things that God has done for you that's why those stones were about and they said in future Generations your children are going to say what means these Stones see and he's and he said and you know most most that was a real story in fact is many theologians believe that when when you know when they said to Jesus as he's crossing over and coming down into Jerusalem and he's he's he's coming very near right where John was baptizing and had been baptizing and they they're they're shouting Hosanna Hosanna and they they said tell these people to be quiet and Jesus said if they hold their peace the stones the rocks and most most theologians believe he was referring right to those that were still there in the Jordan uh under Joshua that these are proof that God lives and keeps his word oh my it's good to rehearse you know I can I can say I can say to you today and I've been believing God since a child you know why because I was taught that I was taught by my parents to believe God believe the word I was taught that I was raised that but there had to come a day I had to prove that myself and as I began to prove it as a young man and I began to take God at his word friends I can tell you here today and I'm just maybe a month or a little more than a month shy of of three score and I can tell you that I have never ever ever seen God fail to keep his word if I said anything else I'd be lying I have never seen him fail to keep his word lots of things happen that I didn't understand and then later on I say well Lord you knew better anyway didn't you you got that same testimony today I'm a witness that he's been that he's been faithful amen amen and you know I I like to say this that I'm a witness that I mean I'm a witness that he's he's healed me yeah how many are witness of his healing power I'm a witness that he's that he's delivered me amen do you believe that too I'm a witness that he's healed I'm a witness that he's delivered amen but you know one of the greatest testimonies that I have is I'm a witness how many times he's restored me again and again and again you see because I've never been able to walk too good without stumbling but he always picks me back up he always dusts me off he always puts me right back on so how many times has he done it again and again and over and over and over he heals me delivers me he restores me Hallelujah you believe his word today amen I hope my eye doctor's not watching the broadcast today oh my we're going to sing some more of that amen he knows my name let's see him now
