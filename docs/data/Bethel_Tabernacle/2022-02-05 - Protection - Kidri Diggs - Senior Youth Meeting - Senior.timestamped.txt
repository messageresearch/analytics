[0:00] we already been praying so i'm gonna
[0:01] just
[0:02] get right into it
[0:04] i'm glad to be here
[0:06] all right tonight
[0:09] by the
[0:10] grace of god
[0:13] i want to talk about protection
[0:16] it may sound kind of strange protection
[0:20] but i think as
[0:23] young people or young adults or whatever
[0:25] you want to call yourself
[0:29] it's very important to know that you're
[0:31] protected
[0:33] and to know how to stay protected
[0:37] and i just kind of want to use some
[0:38] examples to
[0:40] show you that everything has to fall on
[0:42] their level of protection
[0:44] you all agree
[0:46] like you take this house
[0:48] what's protecting us from the rain
[0:51] the roof
[0:53] this house will be
[0:55] in some stages no good if it didn't have
[0:58] a roof on it
[0:59] because everything in the house would be
[1:01] damaged
[1:02] by the elements
[1:04] so they put a roof on it to keep
[1:06] everything protected the the walls the
[1:11] furniture the people everything
[1:13] falls under the protection of the roof
[1:16] right
[1:17] so if you think about if this house
[1:18] didn't have a roof it would be subject
[1:20] to the rain snow which we very simply
[1:23] don't get but
[1:25] just all the different seasons and
[1:27] everything that happened and over time
[1:30] the elements will cause damage to
[1:32] everything that's in here because it's
[1:34] not protected
[1:35] even those chairs you sit there are
[1:38] protected
[1:40] like even this table
[1:41] is protected it may look like it's just
[1:44] wood
[1:45] but there's something they put over it
[1:47] to keep your hands and everything else
[1:49] from getting phones in it so there's a
[1:51] level of protection on it
[1:53] can you agree yeah
[1:55] even you as a human vessel there's a
[1:58] level of protection you're walking
[2:00] around with
[2:02] your insides your bones your your
[2:04] vessels
[2:05] uh your veins all these things are
[2:07] protected by what
[2:09] your skin
[2:11] you mean
[2:12] your brain is protected by what your
[2:14] skull
[2:16] so there's no matter no matter how you
[2:18] look at it
[2:19] we all fall under a level of protection
[2:23] so if god orchestrated things that
[2:25] simple what about us in our spiritual
[2:28] journey
[2:29] that there is a protection that god has
[2:32] given us
[2:33] but some of you are walking away from
[2:36] that protection
[2:38] because god one thing about god god
[2:40] gives us his word
[2:42] right
[2:43] he gives us his word his word is here to
[2:46] protect us
[2:48] and if you're not living according to
[2:50] god's word
[2:51] you're not protected
[2:53] so that means at any time the devil can
[2:56] do whatever he wants to do because
[2:57] you're no longer under that protection
[3:00] if we could go back to the to the very
[3:02] beginning god created adam and eve
[3:05] and we know that the enemy couldn't
[3:07] touch them why somebody talked to them
[3:09] why couldn't he touch them
[3:11] they were in a protected garden because
[3:12] they were protected
[3:14] just that simple
[3:16] as long what what kept them
[3:18] protected
[3:19] as long as they obeyed the word of god
[3:23] satan couldn't touch them yeah
[3:25] and you look at what satan brought once
[3:28] they got from behind that protection
[3:30] he brought sickness
[3:32] he brought pain he brought heartache he
[3:34] brought all these different things
[3:36] attributes of unbelief
[3:38] when they stepped from behind that
[3:40] protection
[3:42] so i say unto you you fall subject to
[3:44] all these same things
[3:46] when you come from behind the word like
[3:48] evidence yeah and she thought you know
[3:52] like most of you you would say well it's
[3:54] just my desire you know it's just
[3:57] something i have to overcome but this is
[3:59] the thing what are you doing to overcome
[4:03] what are you doing overcoming look these
[4:05] meetings we're having and and you've
[4:07] been and i commend this church i commend
[4:10] you all
[4:11] for having these these youth gatherings
[4:13] and and
[4:14] these youth meetings and being faithful
[4:16] and coming but what good is it if you're
[4:19] not living by what you hear
[4:22] right if you hear this word over and
[4:25] over again
[4:26] but but but there's something in you
[4:29] that pulls you from behind the word what
[4:31] is it trying to do it's trying to get
[4:33] you to a place to where you're no longer
[4:35] protected
[4:36] and once you're no longer under god's
[4:39] protection
[4:40] it's it's free reign for the devil to do
[4:42] whatever you want
[4:44] and i'm gonna show you some scripts from
[4:46] scripture
[4:47] where people got from behind god's
[4:49] protection and i kind of want to use
[4:51] some young people where they got from
[4:53] behind god's protection and it destroyed
[4:55] their life
[4:57] but before i get into that i always
[4:59] think about the story
[5:00] you know the prophet talked about uh a
[5:03] young girl y'all may may have heard me
[5:06] um refer to this before
[5:08] it was a young girl who grew up in a
[5:10] christian home
[5:13] but the prophet of god said she grew up
[5:15] in a christian home
[5:16] but she chose a whirly boyfriend
[5:20] so although she was in a christian home
[5:23] she never became a christian
[5:25] so she was hearing all the words she had
[5:27] good parents there protecting her how
[5:30] they protecting her
[5:32] by keeping her in a godly atmosphere
[5:35] a good christian home
[5:37] but see like some of you
[5:39] you desire the thing over the fence when
[5:41] god has has as christian parents a
[5:45] christian mama or daddy or whatever you
[5:47] may be you're in a good church what's
[5:49] happening he's trying to keep you
[5:51] protected yeah
[5:53] that's it's it's just very simple
[5:55] because there are things that the enemy
[5:57] is trying to he tries to set up he has
[5:59] trapped for you that you know nothing
[6:01] about
[6:02] until you get from behind that
[6:04] protection
[6:05] see eve didn't know listen
[6:08] eve
[6:09] partook of the forbidden fruit right
[6:12] yeah once she partook forbidden fruit
[6:14] she could never get back
[6:17] and then once she partook of it she
[6:19] started craving
[6:21] y'all understand that
[6:23] once she particularly for being fruit
[6:25] she was like wow i never tasted this
[6:27] before let me go give it to my husband
[6:30] so then what did she do she brought out
[6:33] from under that protection
[6:35] see so you have to be careful
[6:37] the things that you go through can
[6:39] easily influence somebody else and mess
[6:41] up their lives
[6:43] so when we're doing different things
[6:45] we're following what we say our hearts
[6:47] or our desires
[6:48] make sure it's something
[6:50] according to god's word amen because i
[6:54] believe the bible said i may not uh
[6:56] phrase this right but it says that uh
[6:59] the heart is
[7:00] wicked they say the heart is wicked who
[7:03] can trust it yes
[7:05] and i'm sure you i should i'm sure all
[7:07] of us have heard from time to time
[7:09] follow your heart
[7:11] right have you heard that
[7:13] young people have you heard that talk to
[7:14] me
[7:15] follow your heart young girls have you
[7:17] heard that
[7:18] follow your heart well let me tell you
[7:20] something let's make it real real plain
[7:23] follow your heart if you got the holy
[7:25] ghost
[7:28] because if you don't have the holy ghost
[7:30] your unconverted heart will lead you
[7:32] astray
[7:34] because you can be craving and desiring
[7:36] something that has nothing to do with
[7:38] god
[7:40] are you with me
[7:41] but he talked he talked about this he
[7:43] talked about this this young girl who
[7:47] she she grew up in a christian home
[7:50] but she chose a worthy boyfriend
[7:53] and that worldly god who knew nothing
[7:55] about god let me tell you something it's
[7:56] too often that we get in relationships
[7:59] and we're trying to save the person
[8:01] that we know we shouldn't even be
[8:03] talking to right
[8:05] or we're trying to save the person that
[8:06] we know
[8:07] they'll they don't even match up
[8:10] to the protection you're on
[8:12] are you with me
[8:14] because it's like this if you say you
[8:15] say well
[8:16] this person right here you know they're
[8:18] nice and they do so they die and
[8:21] i think they love god
[8:24] see that that thought right there tell
[8:26] you that is wrong
[8:28] the bible says don't be unequally yolked
[8:32] are you with me you know all right
[8:34] it's gonna get a little bit more sticky
[8:37] amen
[8:38] we're just getting started we're getting
[8:39] a little bit more stinky thank you lord
[8:41] you know because you know what i'm i'm
[8:43] to a place to where
[8:45] i'm tired seeing young people sitting in
[8:47] church and it's going in one ear and not
[8:49] the other amen
[8:50] they go they go to camp meetings we have
[8:53] good camps and word of god comes we get
[8:56] in prayer lines and we ask god for
[8:57] deliverance and we go right back to him
[9:01] what happens there's no change
[9:04] there's no change yet you still sit
[9:06] under the protection of who your parents
[9:09] but let's just think about it what if
[9:11] your parents weren't there what kind of
[9:12] life would you have
[9:15] i'm gonna show you in a little bit in
[9:17] the scripture
[9:18] and just just to show you how
[9:20] your parents feel and what how important
[9:23] this protection is
[9:25] let's just let let me show you how this
[9:26] thing works
[9:28] everybody in here got a mother right
[9:30] you know talk to me young people yeah
[9:33] everybody got them up right
[9:35] you know what your mother did when you
[9:36] were born
[9:38] she protected you
[9:40] she made sure you was fed right you know
[9:42] she made sure that you when you were
[9:44] thirsty you had something to drink she
[9:47] made sure when you were cold that you
[9:49] were warm
[9:50] she made sure that you were hot you you
[9:52] get cooled off well it was just
[9:54] something about her
[9:56] to protect you
[9:58] and your dad is in the house he's the
[10:00] same way it was just something about him
[10:03] where he always wants to protect you
[10:06] especially his girls
[10:10] it's just something about you know i'm
[10:11] just i'm missing my oldest girl right
[10:12] now she's married y'all a little daddy
[10:14] she's married joe's a good guy you know
[10:17] i thank the lord for him but i i you
[10:19] know i crack jokes about them because
[10:22] when they first started getting together
[10:23] i didn't really kind of know about it so
[10:26] when i'm playing with them i said joe
[10:27] use a snake
[10:32] but it's all it's all fun and games but
[10:35] but but
[10:37] but i i always say i always say to to
[10:40] young people or
[10:42] uh or to other christian people
[10:45] don't try to do what you see somebody
[10:47] else do
[10:48] because you may not make it you you
[10:50] might end up being an example trying to
[10:53] bring that worldly person into god
[10:55] you know what i mean it don't work out
[10:57] the same for everybody
[10:58] but
[10:59] you know like i was saying this girl she
[11:01] chose a whirly guy
[11:03] and this worldly guy who knew everything
[11:06] about the world and she grew up in a
[11:07] christian home but she never became a
[11:10] christian
[11:11] so she never became a christian what do
[11:13] you think was going to happen to her
[11:14] life
[11:16] she was going to follow the tendencies
[11:18] of the world
[11:20] and let me let me tell you this
[11:23] so will you
[11:26] if you never have a real experience with
[11:28] god
[11:29] you will go the way of the world
[11:32] and satan will destroy it
[11:37] there's no there's no other way to put
[11:39] it you can't stand in a neutral zone and
[11:41] say well i got good parents
[11:44] i come from a good home
[11:46] you know everything is okay but what are
[11:48] you craving
[11:51] because the thing that you're craving is
[11:52] what you're gonna go after yeah sure
[11:55] listen listen to this
[12:01] how many know what it means to have a
[12:02] desire
[12:05] okay
[12:06] now i want you to think about
[12:08] the things that you desire
[12:14] now how much of that
[12:16] is of god
[12:18] what you're craving with your desire
[12:20] listen
[12:22] desire desire means to wish or long for
[12:27] crave or want
[12:30] now you think about it if it's not of
[12:32] god you're craving that thing
[12:35] there's something inside of you that
[12:38] ain't gonna stop until it gets it yeah
[12:41] because you're craving it you're gonna
[12:43] do whatever you can do to get to it you
[12:45] want it
[12:46] there is a desire there that you longing
[12:49] for you know what it means alone for
[12:50] something when you long for something
[12:53] that means it has your heart
[12:55] yeah
[12:57] are you with me
[13:01] listen
[13:02] to express or wish to obtain
[13:06] and the reason why i like this
[13:08] definition because you even try to get
[13:10] spiritual with god
[13:13] they say lord you know you know my heart
[13:15] yeah he know your heart he know your
[13:17] heart ain't converted
[13:19] if you're craving the wrong things
[13:22] or we even will even say well lord lord
[13:25] why do you let this come my way
[13:27] yeah
[13:29] don't blame it on god
[13:31] listen say to ask or request but this is
[13:34] the one i like
[13:35] as a noun craving see i like words that
[13:38] you can use in a noun form or you're
[13:39] using a verb form you know you use you
[13:42] use uh desire as a noun and as a verb
[13:46] but as of now it says a longing or
[13:49] craving
[13:50] ask for something that brings
[13:52] satisfaction
[13:54] how many of you know what it means to be
[13:56] satisfied yeah
[13:58] you know everybody you know all right
[14:00] i'll tell you right now what you did
[14:02] this morning made you satisfied
[14:04] how many y'all went to school this
[14:05] morning
[14:07] number y'all ain't none of y'all in
[14:08] school
[14:12] [Laughter]
[14:23] but think about it when you got dressed
[14:24] this morning you have a
[14:26] certain clothes a blob or a dress a pair
[14:29] of jeans or shirt whatever it was you
[14:31] laid it out you ironed it you put it on
[14:34] you looked in the mirror and if
[14:36] it
[14:37] looked right what were you
[14:39] satisfied
[14:41] and you went you walked out that door
[14:43] with a level of satisfaction
[14:46] you know having a craving or desire is
[14:49] the same thing as that
[14:50] it's something you put on
[14:53] and you're not going to stop until you
[14:56] satisfy
[14:57] if it's something coming out of your
[14:59] spirit
[15:00] but
[15:01] you know back to this girl again
[15:04] this boy that she chose who wasn't a
[15:06] christian
[15:07] now she grew up in a christian home how
[15:09] many of y'all grew up in a christian
[15:10] home
[15:12] now
[15:13] you say brody why are you going this way
[15:16] because i want you to examine
[15:18] are you any different from her
[15:20] what makes you really different from
[15:22] this girl
[15:23] she grew up in a christian home but she
[15:24] chose a whirly boy
[15:26] and that whirly boy one day got her to
[15:28] smoke cigarettes
[15:31] i bet that she wasn't even looking to
[15:32] smoke cigarettes but that's the kind of
[15:34] guy she chose
[15:37] she was craving that kind of guy and all
[15:40] these other different all these other
[15:42] different doors were open
[15:44] based upon what she was craving
[15:46] now she didn't she probably didn't know
[15:48] right there cigarettes was gonna come
[15:50] along with that craving
[15:52] just that tall dark and handsome boy
[15:57] he also had a pack of cigarettes
[16:00] and then one day
[16:02] he probably was out talking and because
[16:04] she was craving him
[16:06] she stopped smoking with
[16:08] influence she started smoking with
[16:10] what was happening she was losing her
[16:12] protection
[16:14] now she's doing things that she wasn't
[16:16] raised to do
[16:18] and then one day it was out
[16:20] and they were having a good time
[16:23] and she didn't realize it he put some
[16:24] alcohol in the drink
[16:26] and she started drinking next thing you
[16:28] know now she's smoking cigarettes and
[16:30] she's drinking
[16:31] all of us came along with the boys she
[16:33] craved
[16:35] and then once he
[16:37] once he he got out with the cigarettes
[16:39] then he gathered with the drinking next
[16:42] thing he did he took advantage of her
[16:43] body
[16:45] now he got the whole package everything
[16:48] about it did you know what he did after
[16:49] that he dumped her
[16:55] look at what her craving got her look at
[16:57] what her desires got
[16:59] her desire made her lose all her
[17:02] protection
[17:04] as long as she was in that house
[17:06] raised by good christian parents
[17:09] listening to the word of god staying
[17:11] behind listen let me tell you something
[17:12] if you've got christian folks and if
[17:15] they're preaching a word to you they're
[17:16] trying to give you good christian
[17:18] standards what are they doing they're
[17:20] protecting you
[17:22] they're protecting you
[17:24] but what happens brother brethren say
[17:26] we fight so he said it's not god's will
[17:29] god's desire that anybody should go
[17:32] [Music]
[17:38] some of you got two roadblocks in your
[17:40] house
[17:41] one called mama
[17:43] and one called daddy
[17:45] and you fuss and fight with those road
[17:47] blocks because you craving something
[17:49] but once you get past those wrong blocks
[17:51] you're no longer protected
[17:54] anything can happen there
[17:56] and this young girl got so messed up
[17:59] just from that one boy she chose she
[18:01] turned into a prostitute
[18:05] then she turned into a junkie y'all know
[18:06] what a junkie is
[18:09] yeah
[18:10] she turned to the junction and while we
[18:12] own that
[18:14] there's no such thing as casual drugs
[18:18] right
[18:20] let me tell you something
[18:23] if i can say it like this
[18:26] if i can say it like this in our day
[18:32] the weed or the blood that was being
[18:34] smoked
[18:35] came from a tree
[18:38] it came from the ground
[18:39] but this stuff they smoking not come out
[18:41] of the laboratory yeah
[18:44] and it has so many chemicals in it so
[18:46] many things that makes your body crave
[18:49] to a place that you get hooked on it
[18:52] and then you can't get away from it
[18:54] because it's made in the laboratory
[18:56] and all these guys why you think they
[18:58] make it illegal
[19:01] because it's a business
[19:03] it's a business
[19:05] but what happened what happened
[19:08] this girl
[19:09] because of the guy she chose she turned
[19:11] to a prostitute you know what happened
[19:13] after that she went to jail
[19:15] and once she got in jail she started
[19:17] thinking about her protection
[19:18] she's like man i was raised better than
[19:21] us
[19:22] so she got hooked up with the nomination
[19:23] the catholic church and she she i think
[19:26] it's called good shepherd
[19:27] she got hooked up with them and she
[19:29] started getting her life back right and
[19:31] everything and let's watch you while she
[19:33] was in solitary confinement while she
[19:35] was in jail you know listen
[19:38] i always say this if you're doing wrong
[19:42] getting caught don't bring repentance
[19:46] right
[19:47] he didn't conscience mean you got caught
[19:49] correct
[19:50] and that's what happened with a lot of
[19:51] young people they get caught and they'd
[19:53] be like
[19:54] well
[19:55] you know i'm just i just want to do
[19:57] better i'm so tired
[20:00] don't take my phone you don't take my
[20:02] ass
[20:03] please
[20:04] you know you ain't sorry
[20:07] you just don't you just don't want them
[20:08] to alter your lifestyle
[20:11] correct
[20:14] but true repentance will take away that
[20:16] fact
[20:17] but that's what happened too often young
[20:19] people get caught doing their own thing
[20:22] and not just by your parents you get
[20:24] caught sometimes sitting in church and
[20:25] the preachers start preaching them
[20:27] and what is that that's god trying to
[20:29] bring you back under that protection
[20:31] yeah
[20:32] how often young people you've come to
[20:34] church you hear god talk to you
[20:39] talk to you let's make a real personal
[20:41] talk to you about things you have
[20:43] confessed to your parents
[20:49] that's how god works
[20:51] what i'm trying to show you what i'm
[20:53] trying to tell you is
[20:55] every secret you got god knows about him
[20:59] but god is so loving
[21:01] he'll come and express himself to you
[21:03] and let you know he knows to try to keep
[21:06] you protected
[21:08] but what we do is we push and push down
[21:10] we pushed all the way because we want
[21:11] that thing so bad
[21:13] and now she got what she wanted she got
[21:15] it
[21:17] and what she wanted turned into a drug
[21:19] addict turned into a smoker a drunk a
[21:22] prostitute and now she's trying to get
[21:24] it right
[21:25] she goes she goes to good shepherd she
[21:27] hook up with the with the people in jail
[21:29] you know in jail even when you're in
[21:31] jail you're gonna get some preaching
[21:37] you might think oh i'm in jail i can't
[21:39] hear you oh they don't see the chaplain
[21:42] you still get some preaching in jail you
[21:44] can't get away from god
[21:46] man
[21:47] but
[21:48] she's in jail and she tries to get her
[21:51] life together and once she
[21:52] she's like this is it i'm going back to
[21:55] god
[21:55] look at what made her eyes even turn
[21:59] back to god look at her life
[22:01] she didn't have to go that route
[22:04] she didn't have to go that route
[22:06] she grew up in a christian home that's
[22:08] what i'm saying to you
[22:09] what the world has to offer let me tell
[22:11] you a lot of it you don't want
[22:15] [Music]
[22:17] let's go back to that moment okay go
[22:19] back to the mamas
[22:20] listen what that mama do i'm gonna tell
[22:21] you what your mama did to you
[22:24] you was walking across the street
[22:26] anybody ever remember holding them on my
[22:28] hand
[22:29] or they got a hand
[22:30] and it's a busy road out there and you
[22:32] walk across the street and cars coming
[22:35] and she picked you up and threw you out
[22:36] there hit my bed
[22:46] i'm so sick of this baby
[22:49] i gotta alter my life because of this
[22:51] baby
[22:52] oh i'm running out of money because of
[22:53] this baby
[22:55] no they didn't do that
[22:57] you know what they did if you tried to
[22:59] run out there they grabbed you by your
[23:01] shirt and snatched you back
[23:03] why because they were your protector
[23:05] right
[23:06] how many of you ever remember falling
[23:08] down
[23:09] and one of your parents coming to you
[23:12] cuddling you
[23:13] or or get your womb together or making
[23:16] sure you wasn't hurt no more any of
[23:17] y'all remember that
[23:21] why didn't why didn't she just come over
[23:23] there and say wait wait what does it
[23:24] hurt what does it hurt and you like
[23:27] it
[23:30] they didn't do that
[23:32] what did they do they tried to make it
[23:34] better right why because there's
[23:36] something in them to protect you
[23:40] and i say i'll have to say this
[23:42] so
[23:43] if they would act like that when you
[23:44] were small
[23:46] and protect you
[23:47] why would you ever think now that you're
[23:50] older they wouldn't stop trying to
[23:52] protect you
[23:55] they're still operating under that same
[23:58] love
[23:59] remember the car was coming they didn't
[24:01] say hey just just go in here just go run
[24:04] them over i'm tired
[24:06] they didn't do that
[24:08] they snatched you out of danger
[24:10] they snatched you out of the way this is
[24:12] an example my pastor like to use is
[24:15] probably a good example because we had
[24:16] tony house what do you say who said you
[24:18] take a you take a uh uh a machine gun
[24:21] right
[24:22] and you can take that machine gun
[24:25] as an adult you can spray it all over
[24:27] the place because you know what it can
[24:29] do
[24:30] he said but you put that same machine
[24:32] gun and the baby in
[24:34] and baby walk around
[24:40] what you gonna do
[24:42] why because the baby doesn't know the
[24:44] power
[24:45] of that gun is home
[24:47] the baby doesn't know
[24:49] what the effect of what they're about to
[24:51] do can happen to other people
[24:53] yeah and that's how that's how we do as
[24:56] parents
[24:57] you can't see what we can see sometimes
[25:01] all we're trying to do is keep you
[25:03] protected
[25:05] all your passing and the different
[25:06] preachers in here all they're trying to
[25:08] do is keep you protected
[25:12] so this girl she's in good shepherd now
[25:14] and she she she
[25:16] uh
[25:18] per se gets her life right
[25:20] she gets out of jail
[25:21] and she's like
[25:23] i'm gonna live better
[25:25] but then she goes right back into the
[25:26] same old stuff again
[25:27] [Music]
[25:29] so much
[25:31] until all the stuff she was doing drove
[25:33] her to an insane insider
[25:36] she found herself in a crazy house
[25:39] y'all don't know anybody in the crazy
[25:40] house
[25:45] i'll tell you i think y'all know more
[25:47] people than y'all think
[25:49] yeah some of y'all friends stay in the
[25:50] crazy house
[25:54] you said brothers what you mean by that
[25:55] ain't no college standard in the house
[25:59] so anything goes
[26:05] any young man any
[26:07] uncle any unconverted father to his son
[26:10] go and experience life sow your wild
[26:14] enjoy yourself you only live once
[26:18] all he's doing is telling that boy just
[26:20] go kill yourself
[26:22] yeah
[26:22] right oh oh a mother who tells up tells
[26:25] her daughter
[26:27] just don't fall in love with one boy
[26:29] date at least 21st
[26:36] she's basically telling her daughter you
[26:37] just destroy your life yeah
[26:41] so really they're staying in a crazy
[26:42] house yeah
[26:44] spiritually speaking
[26:46] y'all go back and get to school and say
[26:48] yeah brother say you crazy
[26:50] yo
[27:18] a little bit to go
[27:20] but she
[27:22] got out of jail and she went right back
[27:24] into it
[27:25] and she went further into it why because
[27:27] the spirit was still there yeah she
[27:30] never
[27:31] got converted
[27:33] she never got
[27:35] real protection
[27:36] and now she found herself in an insane
[27:39] institution
[27:40] and brother brown comes in
[27:43] and look
[27:44] he comes in and what does he see what
[27:46] does he see he looks at her
[27:48] she's a beautiful young lady
[27:51] nice looking hair pretty eyes all that
[27:54] but emily she's messed up
[27:57] you don't want to be in that condition
[27:59] you got a nice hairdo you're dressing
[28:01] nice you're looking good but inside
[28:05] you messed up
[28:06] that's a miserable person yeah
[28:09] so she begins to tell brother brandon
[28:12] the story that's how we know it she told
[28:13] her to cry
[28:15] she told how her life got all messed up
[28:17] and all these things and it led her to
[28:19] insane institution
[28:21] and he actually said wouldn't you want
[28:23] to be a a wife and have children and
[28:26] everything and she's like yes i've
[28:28] always desired that and he got talking
[28:31] with him he said you know what stopping
[28:32] you from doing that she said it's a
[28:34] spirit
[28:35] there's a spirit in your life that's
[28:37] stopping you from living a a fully
[28:40] surrendered life for god
[28:42] she said i've always believed that
[28:44] see she always knew that she wasn't
[28:47] doing right
[28:48] but she would never surrender to
[28:51] but now her life is so messed up and
[28:53] this part against me why do you get to
[28:55] that point before you
[28:57] try jesus
[28:59] it's so much more satisfying
[29:02] when you don't have all that baggage
[29:05] right
[29:07] if i can be transparent
[29:08] it's so much more satisfying as a young
[29:12] man when you got to think about every
[29:14] other girlfriend you had comparing it to
[29:16] your wife
[29:17] yeah
[29:18] it's so much more satisfying as a young
[29:20] wife when you ain't got
[29:22] you you got to have mind battles about
[29:24] how he treated you versus the last boy
[29:27] treated you
[29:29] it's so much more satisfying when you
[29:31] stay protected
[29:34] but what they did they had a prayer
[29:36] meeting right there in the insane
[29:38] institution and she got down to pray
[29:41] like some of y'all do that camp
[29:43] she got down and prayed and it was a
[29:45] real sober moment and she she prayed and
[29:48] she lift her hands and she's like i'm
[29:50] delivered
[29:52] i feel like
[30:04] you all know what it's like to have a
[30:05] real breakthrough
[30:10] for those of y'all don't let me tell you
[30:11] what a real breakthrough
[30:13] a real breakthrough
[30:15] is when you don't desire those things
[30:19] that's a real break
[30:20] that means that spirit has
[30:23] left you and
[30:24] that craving that desire has left you
[30:28] and it's no longer there to make you do
[30:30] those things that you don't want to do
[30:32] all right let's look at some people in
[30:34] the bible
[30:39] amen
[30:40] praise god
[30:42] hallelujah
[30:49] uh before i
[30:51] before we turn the bible let me read
[30:52] this quote it says now
[30:54] we find this great enemy of god tonight
[30:58] now as long as they will believe that
[31:01] word
[31:02] i can never get to them
[31:04] so he's talking to satan satan knows as
[31:07] long as you believe the word he can't
[31:09] touch you
[31:10] because that's your protection
[31:12] as long as that little family in e keeps
[31:15] behind the word i can never touch them
[31:17] neither can he today see the same
[31:20] standard god laid out there for eve is
[31:22] the same standard for us
[31:24] as long as we stay behind the word the
[31:26] devil can't touch us the world is our
[31:27] protection
[31:29] he says neither can he today amen he's
[31:32] still blocked off can you believe that
[31:34] the devil is blocked off
[31:36] he'll be blocked off from your mind your
[31:38] body your spirit if you apply the word
[31:41] in your life
[31:43] he says i'll give you some you he says
[31:45] but if you can if you can use the same
[31:48] real good
[31:49] a strategy and just reason out he said i
[31:52] give some human reasoning because she's
[31:55] human and if i can just give human
[31:58] reasoning then
[32:00] we'll win the battle see that's what
[32:02] satan gives you
[32:03] with just a little bit of human
[32:05] reasoning
[32:06] you say well god
[32:09] you know my heart
[32:11] human reasoning
[32:12] satan and his angels but then if he
[32:15] would have stayed behind the word the
[32:17] enemy could have never touched him
[32:19] do y'all agree with that
[32:21] all right one thing i want you to
[32:22] understand tonight
[32:24] as i'm reading the scriptures
[32:26] this is not brother dean's words
[32:29] so don't walk out here saying brother
[32:30] dee said no the bible says
[32:33] amen
[32:34] the bible says how many y'all love god
[32:36] amen amen
[32:39] everybody everybody
[32:42] do you really
[32:44] i got a scripture i wanted to read
[32:47] but i'm just paraphrasing
[32:49] when i was around your age like this
[32:51] having bible study
[32:53] my mama had one big family bible
[32:56] probably like a big old
[32:58] bookshelf
[33:02] and and and
[33:04] unlike some of us well she her bible
[33:06] studies was on the tribulation period
[33:10] about getting left behind
[33:12] and some of y'all don't even know about
[33:14] that
[33:15] you've heard it in church but you ain't
[33:17] paying no attention
[33:19] there will be a rapture
[33:21] and there will be a
[33:23] the thing is you better decide which way
[33:25] you want to go
[33:27] because you get every opportunity now
[33:30] to stay protected
[33:32] but
[33:33] one day she asked me the same question i
[33:36] asked you
[33:37] you love god
[33:38] what kind of question is that of course
[33:40] i love god
[33:43] that's me not like
[33:45] i know i love god
[33:48] okay love god she turned me over to
[33:50] john your first john second john i
[33:53] wanted to take over john
[33:55] she said read
[33:56] and and the script don't paraphrase your
[33:58] scripture
[33:59] he said the scriptures say if anyone say
[34:02] they love god
[34:03] right we did we
[34:05] [Music]
[34:13] so if you say you love god
[34:16] and you're not keeping his commandments
[34:18] the scripture says you're alive
[34:21] and the truth
[34:23] now i don't know what that did for you
[34:25] but for me it hit me like a ton of
[34:26] bricks
[34:30] on the bricks
[34:32] why because i said i love god but then
[34:33] my life wasn't matching up
[34:36] so i really didn't love god
[34:38] sort of like the rich young ruler
[34:41] he said jesus what can i do to be
[34:42] perfect he said keep the commandments he
[34:43] said man i've done that for my youth but
[34:45] then he said go sell everything you
[34:46] gotta come follow me he couldn't do it
[34:50] so really he couldn't keep his command
[34:52] yeah
[34:53] i want to commit he couldn't keep
[34:56] okay let's go to uh
[34:59] i don't know if i want to read this
[35:01] let's let's read second second second 7
[35:03] 13.
[35:07] second samuel chapter 13.
[35:12] um
[35:22] this is the story
[35:24] between amnon and taymar
[35:27] a brother and sister
[35:29] daughter and david's son
[35:32] but david's son
[35:34] he had the hops for his sister
[35:37] and
[35:38] you know
[35:39] she was like nah nah go ahead come on
[35:49] [Music]
[35:55] was very
[35:56] persistent
[35:58] and
[35:59] just write write this if y'all gotta
[36:00] clean write the scripture down and go
[36:02] back and you can go back and read the
[36:03] whole the rest of it is i'm gonna kind
[36:06] of care for you for the sake of time
[36:08] but it's second samuel chapter 13.
[36:10] so what i did you know uh tamar rejected
[36:14] him so what am not did he was like look
[36:16] i got to get close to
[36:18] so what he did was he faked like he was
[36:20] sick
[36:22] so that she could come serve him
[36:24] and once he once he got along he was
[36:27] like you know i love you and he's
[36:30] pledging his love and all this stuff and
[36:32] on and on and she's like dude look at it
[36:35] you my brother cut that foolishness out
[36:38] you know what he he's still carrying all
[36:40] you know i love you and my heart and you
[36:43] know this and that and blah blah blah
[36:45] she's like whatever dude
[36:47] so he played like he was sick
[36:49] got him coming in just
[36:52] to
[36:52] to serve him and he said come just lie
[36:55] with me you know let's just fall in love
[36:57] and she's like no no no and he took
[36:59] advantage of him
[37:01] he took advantage of him and after he
[37:03] took advantage of her his feelings
[37:06] changed
[37:09] once he took advantage of it he got what
[37:11] he wanted he looked at and said you know
[37:13] what i can't even stand you
[37:16] get just just get out my presence
[37:20] as adults how often we see that
[37:23] happening in the world
[37:25] a young man he moves and he rules and
[37:27] tell a girl i love you and i do so not
[37:30] that till he gets what he wants
[37:32] and once he gets what he wants he's like
[37:33] man just just don't even call me no more
[37:37] i say to your name
[37:38] ig block
[37:41] twitter blocked
[37:43] snapchat blocked
[37:48] and now she's sitting there with a
[37:50] broken heart
[37:51] but the bible says she was defiant
[37:55] don't put yourself in positions you
[37:57] can't get out of
[38:00] but then you know what happened just to
[38:01] make it just make the story short
[38:04] her big brother found out about it
[38:06] absalon
[38:07] after that i said uh this ain't gonna
[38:09] happen
[38:10] you know what he did
[38:13] okay he killed his brother
[38:15] kill his brother for the foul on his
[38:17] sister now you got a whole house and an
[38:20] uproar because one brother couldn't
[38:21] control himself
[38:25] but we're talking about protection right
[38:27] and desire
[38:29] all right y'all go back and read that
[38:32] let's move on
[38:34] get your bibles and
[38:36] let's turn to um
[38:55] so we can kind of get out of here
[39:00] we know the story of samson
[39:02] amen
[39:04] very familiar
[39:06] what was samson's greatest problem
[39:14] it wasn't just women
[39:17] he wanted a woman his mom and daddy
[39:19] didn't approve of
[39:22] i'm gonna read it to you
[39:26] judge is 14.
[39:30] and listen
[39:32] listen to
[39:34] the mom and daddy trying to keep sampson
[39:36] protected
[39:38] judges 14 let's start at verse 2. he
[39:40] said he came up and told his father and
[39:42] his mother and said i have seen a woman
[39:44] of of timnath of the daughters of the
[39:47] philistines you know the philistines of
[39:48] the enemy yeah right
[39:50] he knew this was the girl of the enemy
[39:52] he knew this was a girl he shouldn't
[39:54] even be thinking about
[39:56] but look he was crazy
[39:59] you know she probably was an instagram
[40:00] mom
[40:05] he said now therefore
[40:07] listen listen the audacity of samson
[40:11] knowing his parents don't agree
[40:13] he said he's seen a woman you see a
[40:15] woman she's from the daughter of the
[40:16] philistine and look what he will tell
[40:18] his parents
[40:19] now therefore
[40:21] get her for me the wife
[40:25] is that something
[40:27] how often you want your christian
[40:28] parents
[40:30] to go against their convictions and give
[40:32] you some worthiness
[40:36] just basically help you be unprotected
[40:40] no no
[40:42] listen what the dad said say then his
[40:43] father and his mother said unto him
[40:46] is there not
[40:48] a woman among the daughters of the
[40:50] brother basically like we tell y'all is
[40:53] there not a christian young man or a
[40:55] christian young girl in the message
[41:01] but you know sounds he said is there not
[41:03] a woman among the daughters of the
[41:04] brother or among all my people that thou
[41:07] goes to take a wife of the uncircumcised
[41:09] philistine and samson said unto his
[41:11] father
[41:12] get her for me
[41:14] for she pleases me well
[41:18] you know what was happening right there
[41:20] samson was stepping from under that
[41:22] protection
[41:25] did he get him
[41:26] talked to him
[41:29] you know what else he got when he got
[41:32] he got his eyes plucked out
[41:36] and look
[41:37] just what matt this would always kill me
[41:40] about the story of samson right
[41:42] y'all know the story delilah was like
[41:45] if you love me you tell me your secret
[41:47] right i don't see that what you doing in
[41:49] the scripture go back and read it judges
[41:51] 14 all right y'all write this down go
[41:53] back and read it we talk about
[41:54] protection
[41:56] that's how delilah will play with him
[41:57] she used the word love
[41:59] and we just throw that around now like
[42:02] you know i love you you love me
[42:05] you know she says you love when you take
[42:07] your secret and sad to come up with a
[42:08] real little sandwich and tie my hands
[42:11] and she would do it
[42:22] [Music]
[42:26] tell me how to kill you it sounds to be
[42:27] like hey just tie my hand behind my back
[42:30] and she's like okay
[42:31] ty's everybody back why would you want
[42:34] to date somebody that's trying to kill
[42:36] you
[42:39] i ain't making this stuff up
[42:43] and she did at least three or four times
[42:45] sam said top time i have whatever put it
[42:47] in the braid or whatever put his hair in
[42:49] the brace sounds he had to pick the
[42:50] gates up
[42:52] and run up the hill and look at that
[42:54] because the guy was still on
[42:56] but every everything
[42:59] he told delilah how he would lose his
[43:01] strength basically this is how you kill
[43:03] me she will do it
[43:05] why would you want somebody like that
[43:10] to the place there's another scripture
[43:12] where the bible says
[43:13] samson got vexed
[43:16] all the stuff he was doing it wasn't
[43:18] bringing him no job
[43:20] it was just a game to him
[43:23] but he didn't realize this girl he was
[43:25] taken up with really was gonna try
[43:28] to kill him
[43:30] got to the place to where he was so
[43:32] blinded by his own cravings his own
[43:35] desires
[43:36] to sampson fell asleep
[43:39] after he told delilah his real secret
[43:42] with his head and her lap
[43:45] well that's dangerous
[43:47] now he's sleeping with the enemy
[43:50] and what happened she called them in
[43:52] they plucked samson out plucked samson
[43:54] eyes out
[43:56] all that because he didn't listen to his
[43:58] mama in the day
[43:59] he had got a warning
[44:01] according to the scripture
[44:03] he had gotten warned from his parents
[44:05] his parents were trying to tell him hey
[44:06] son stay protected
[44:09] no he got to play around with the loud
[44:11] you know his eyes got plugged out
[44:13] then he found himself in the dungeon
[44:14] they make his play laughing them playing
[44:16] with him at one point they couldn't
[44:18] chuck sounds you know why because he was
[44:20] living by a nazarite vibe
[44:22] he was protected
[44:25] are you with me
[44:26] he was protected and as long as he was
[44:28] protected the enemy couldn't touch him
[44:30] delilah couldn't touch nobody could
[44:32] touch him but once he got from behind
[44:34] that vibe he was just a regular person
[44:37] and so are we
[44:40] when we get from behind the word of god
[44:42] we're not better than anybody else
[44:47] samson's life
[44:51] was really a tragedy
[44:54] because he could have did so much more
[44:57] but he let a wicked woman steal his joy
[45:03] all right
[45:05] i don't know why i'm
[45:07] talking about relationships so much
[45:09] tonight
[45:12] hmm
[45:13] it's kind of interesting
[45:16] be careful who you choose yeah
[45:20] even the ones in your very own church
[45:23] because if they ain't converted they
[45:25] don't leave no good
[45:30] i'm gonna end with this one
[45:34] i'm gonna paraphrase this one
[45:38] we've all heard of solomon right
[45:40] silent with david's son
[45:43] the bible says he was the wisest man on
[45:45] the earth at that time
[45:50] but solomon was so wise
[45:52] he couldn't stay away from strange women
[45:57] and it was those strange women
[45:59] that caused his defeat
[46:02] god said stay away from those strange
[46:03] women solomon they're gonna turn your
[46:05] heart from me
[46:07] and that's exactly what happened
[46:09] even though he was the wisest man at
[46:11] that time he was so wise but not wise
[46:14] enough to listen to god's warning and
[46:16] protection
[46:18] don't ever think you got it all mapped
[46:20] out
[46:21] stay behind this word
[46:23] last one i'm gonna read luke 15
[46:26] luke chapter 15.
[46:30] and we all know this story right here
[46:33] this is the story of the prodigal son
[46:35] you know that one right
[46:37] everybody no doubt
[46:39] i wonder if i pick one of y'all y'all
[46:41] tell me the story of the proper song
[46:42] cause you do
[46:46] you never heard it before
[46:48] but think about this
[46:49] this young man i'm a paraphrase story
[46:52] this young man
[46:54] grew up in a good christian house
[46:57] you know but then he started getting a
[46:58] little older it was him and his brother
[47:00] his dad didn't say much about his mama
[47:02] but i'm sure he had mama
[47:03] but now he's getting to the point where
[47:07] maybe he got his license and you know he
[47:09] got a good little job or whatever the
[47:10] case is and
[47:12] he's kind of
[47:13] tired of living
[47:15] in a christian atmosphere
[47:17] he kind of want to get out and do his
[47:19] own thing
[47:20] you know but he's not he's not he don't
[47:23] know
[47:24] what he's about to get into as long as
[47:26] he's at his father's house he's
[47:27] protected
[47:29] so he goes to his dad and he's like hey
[47:30] dad
[47:31] look here i want my money now i can't
[47:33] wait you died
[47:35] because i won't i want my insurance
[47:37] policy i don't even i won't everything
[47:38] right now
[47:40] i'm sure the scripture don't say but i'm
[47:42] sure your daddy probably tried to plead
[47:43] with him say son you really don't want
[47:45] to do this
[47:47] like yeah daddy i'm ready to just give
[47:48] just give it to me don't hold me no more
[47:50] i'm grown just give it to me so daddy
[47:53] gathered up all that he had for him gave
[47:55] it to him and let him go
[47:57] first thing he does he's getting hooked
[47:59] up with some worldly friends
[48:02] why don't we do that
[48:04] as soon as we get a little aged we get
[48:07] hooked up with the world
[48:09] or as soon as you know
[48:11] your parents start to trust you or give
[48:13] you a little leeway first thing you do
[48:15] is get hooked up with your worthy
[48:16] friends
[48:17] and you don't influence them they
[48:19] influence you
[48:22] and cause your house to get
[48:24] all messed up
[48:26] because you about to get somebody to
[48:27] protect you
[48:29] so now he got all his friends and you
[48:31] know he got all the money he's spending
[48:32] all the money everything you know he
[48:34] throwing the super bowl party he's doing
[48:36] it all
[48:40] he's doing everything he got barbecue
[48:42] wings he got
[48:44] everything
[48:45] hey come on
[49:00] daddy says all right
[49:03] it's all right they're gonna be there
[49:05] [Music]
[49:07] they say it's all right everything is
[49:09] good
[49:10] everything is good
[49:20] but
[49:21] but but he gets all this stuff and then
[49:23] he gets out with his friends
[49:25] they suck at him dry
[49:27] as long as he got money he got friends
[49:30] you know he's buying the drinks he's
[49:32] buying the food you know he's buying gas
[49:34] and buying everything the bible says
[49:37] this is what i want to read
[49:39] it says that not many days after the
[49:41] younger son gathered all together and
[49:45] took his journey into a far country
[49:49] and there wasted his substance with
[49:52] riotous living
[49:54] now you know his parents didn't teach
[49:55] him that
[49:57] his parents didn't teach him righteous
[49:59] living
[50:00] so where did he get it from
[50:03] probably something he been looking at on
[50:04] his phone
[50:07] probably some of you been watching on
[50:08] youtube
[50:10] something he been craving
[50:13] and once he got out there it became that
[50:16] you know he he wilding out he all into
[50:18] he's just having a good time the bible
[50:20] says riot is living
[50:22] it says and when he has spent
[50:24] all there was a mighty famine in that
[50:27] land and he began to be in one and you
[50:30] know what happened
[50:31] all his friends were gone yeah
[50:34] all the people that he thought was his
[50:35] butt
[50:36] you know what i'm gonna give you a
[50:37] secret
[50:39] for those of you who say you got friends
[50:41] right and and no doubt some of your
[50:43] friends might be in school or different
[50:44] things people whatever the case is
[50:47] if they i want i want to give you a test
[50:49] to show they're really your friends
[50:52] just choose one day
[50:54] and make your conversation about god
[50:56] every time they talk
[50:58] every time you talk bring up god
[51:01] whatever they say i said man you know uh
[51:04] what we're gonna eat for lunch today say
[51:06] well you know jesus turned water in the
[51:07] wine
[51:12] say well i want to think i wonder we got
[51:14] chick-fil-as they know i know one time
[51:16] in the bible we created some fish some
[51:18] bread
[51:22] just let your conversation be about god
[51:24] see if they get to know it
[51:27] and they ain't getting annoyed
[51:29] at you they get annoyed at the word
[51:34] and the word is who you are
[51:36] they get to know that you
[51:40] just try
[51:42] i told my my oldest girl one time i
[51:44] preached i preached a message about the
[51:45] blood
[51:47] and i i don't know if i'd be here but i
[51:50] took a black handkerchief and i sprayed
[51:51] it with clo rocks
[51:54] i sprayed it with clorox knowing that
[51:55] clorox was gonna make that black
[51:57] handkerchief white
[51:58] and i'm sure that that's the power of
[52:00] the blood
[52:01] the blood the blood
[52:03] can take away all your scenes
[52:05] so i told i told her i said hey
[52:08] pin this bag on your book track and see
[52:10] how many people ask you
[52:12] what happened to the right then you can
[52:14] testify you tell people
[52:26] but just just just think about your
[52:28] conversation is your conversation more
[52:30] of your protection or more of the things
[52:33] you're trying to get from under
[52:37] and this guy
[52:38] once he got riots living all of us
[52:41] everything he got nothing you know what
[52:43] he was about to do
[52:45] somebody take what was mine
[52:47] anybody know
[52:49] he had got so long
[52:52] he found himself with the pigs
[52:56] now how many of y'all will go down and
[52:57] sit down with pigs and say what we finna
[52:59] eat today
[53:01] that's how he got
[53:03] he got so low
[53:05] he was willing to eat sloth
[53:08] that's how long he got
[53:11] he lost all his protection
[53:15] but then he clicked
[53:16] in that moment
[53:18] when he was about to eat some flocking
[53:21] man i got a mama i got a daddy at home
[53:24] who loves me he got servants his
[53:27] servants he better listen i'm going back
[53:29] home
[53:30] and i'm challenging you tonight if you
[53:32] may be out there somewhere we want you
[53:34] to come back home
[53:36] come back home to a house where you're
[53:38] protecting a family where you're
[53:39] protected a church where you're
[53:41] protecting the atmosphere you're
[53:42] protected that's what this young man was
[53:44] coming back to he was coming back to
[53:46] that protection
[53:47] and as he was approaching what made the
[53:50] story so good
[53:51] he didn't come back home like hey man
[53:54] just
[53:55] you know what i supposed to be here he
[53:56] didn't come back like that he came back
[53:58] home
[54:00] he came back basically with his head by
[54:03] asking his daddy for mercy
[54:05] but his daddy what did he do he showed
[54:07] that same love like i'll talk about with
[54:09] the mom
[54:10] he showed that say no he said man you my
[54:12] son come on back in here you know give
[54:14] him a roll put a ring on his finger
[54:16] let's have a feast because my son was
[54:18] once blind now he can see he's come back
[54:20] home
[54:21] see
[54:23] there's nothing you can do
[54:26] that would make your parents
[54:28] stop loving you
[54:31] all they want you to do is just do it
[54:33] right
[54:34] live right
[54:36] take advantage of this lifestyle that
[54:39] they're giving you amen because it can
[54:41] turn out to be something really really
[54:42] great for you and this young man he
[54:45] repented came back home you know and his
[54:48] daddy blessed him and put him right back
[54:50] under the protection
[54:54] how many of y'all understood what i'm
[54:55] talking about
[54:59] i'm gonna stop right there
[55:06] and the just the just of my whole
[55:08] thought tonight is
[55:10] don't be in such a hurry to get from
[55:12] under this protection
[55:15] but while you're here take advantage of
[55:17] it
[55:19] really let god in so he can protect your
[55:21] heart
[55:23] let him in so he can protect your mind
[55:25] and your spirit
[55:27] you know he can protect your thoughts
[55:29] and everything about you let god in
[55:31] because he's the only one that can stop
[55:34] the devil in his tracks
[55:36] you know if we think about tonight these
[55:38] these youth meetings that we have and
[55:41] you know we come here and we do this
[55:43] faithfully
[55:45] but how many young people are really
[55:46] taking advantage of us
[55:48] it's more than just some good ham
[55:50] sandwiches
[55:53] some good cookies and some
[55:55] some fellowship the fellowship is good
[55:56] but there's a bigger picture
[55:59] there's a bigger picture you guys can
[56:02] take this to a whole nother level
[56:05] you can take this to a whole nother
[56:06] level
[56:07] and what i mean by i mean that by
[56:09] christ-centered life
[56:12] i know some of you depending on where is
[56:14] that you be like man i ain't going to i
[56:17] ain't gonna i don't want to go there i'm
[56:18] gonna go this time
[56:21] but if you feel like you're gonna have a
[56:22] little fun it's gonna be a good crowd or
[56:24] whatever it's gonna be you gonna come
[56:26] you're gonna you're gonna be but see
[56:27] there's something bigger than that
[56:31] god is trying to expose you to his
[56:33] fullest expose you to himself
[56:36] but you got to take advantage of it
[56:39] stay protected
[56:41] remember
[56:42] when your parents are talking to you
[56:43] remember mama didn't just take you and
[56:45] throw you out there in front of the car
[56:47] no she kind of
[56:48] [Music]
[56:50] she got it
[56:53] some of y'all swear i don't even realize
[56:54] it
[56:55] so y'all didn't realize this without
[56:57] your parents you wouldn't be walking
[56:59] they helped you walk
[57:01] y'all realize that
[57:03] they help you out
[57:05] if you didn't have a parent encouraging
[57:07] you to stand on your feet some of y'all
[57:09] to walk around right now
[57:11] [Music]
[57:15] but you crawled and you crawled into
[57:17] their parents stood you up they do your
[57:19] legs are strong enough and they say come
[57:21] on baby come on baby come on to me come
[57:23] up to me and you take a step why because
[57:26] you felt the love of that parent
[57:29] now you can't you don't know that we got
[57:30] pictures of it
[57:32] some of us got videos we got pictures of
[57:34] you taking your first steps and
[57:36] everything see that's the love a parent
[57:38] had but even when you failed they were
[57:41] there to catch you protected
[57:43] so what on god's green earth would make
[57:46] you think now
[57:49] they're not they don't have your best
[57:50] interest in mind
[57:56] [Music]
[58:05] this
[58:09] this this this this is what i want y'all
[58:11] to do close your eyes bow your head
[58:14] that's why i want to challenge you
[58:17] in your own time
[58:20] if you're struggling with anything
[58:22] i want you to go to that parent
[58:26] and just have a one-on-one with them
[58:27] talk to them about it
[58:30] they're not there to make you feel bad
[58:32] they're not there to put you on
[58:33] punishment what they're there to do is
[58:35] to keep you protected
[58:39] and
[58:40] the greatest love besides the great the
[58:43] the love of god is the love of a parent
[58:47] lover
[58:49] pastor or
[58:51] a good
[58:52] church atmosphere
[58:56] so if you're struggling with anything
[58:58] now is the time to
[58:59] let that go and that's god see
[59:02] there's life the devil the power of tone
[59:05] what comes out of your mouth can
[59:06] materialize
[59:09] you got the power right now
[59:11] to change your desires
[59:13] you got the power right now to
[59:15] step away from that thing that you've
[59:17] been craving
[59:19] see real sanctification is not just how
[59:22] you dress when wearing a dress or skirt
[59:25] or some long pants what if no real
[59:27] sanctification is when you don't desire
[59:29] those things anymore
[59:41] let's pray
[59:46] lord jesus follow us
[59:52] lord only you know the hearts of your
[59:54] children right now lord
[59:57] probably don't want to seem like we're
[59:58] harping on them and we're
[1:00:01] trying to make them feel and they're not
[1:00:02] worthy
[1:00:04] but lord we know what it means to be
[1:00:06] protected yes
[1:00:08] not even some of us are parents we we've
[1:00:10] gone astray when we had good parents
[1:00:12] leading us up in this truth
[1:00:15] but like samson we had our own desires
[1:00:18] we had our eyes on something that
[1:00:21] wasn't good for us
[1:00:23] and we got it lord
[1:00:25] not only did we get it we got those same
[1:00:27] scars to this day
[1:00:29] that we can remember when we went astray
[1:00:32] but by your grace you brought us back
[1:00:34] lord
[1:00:35] and now we're here
[1:00:38] lord over the
[1:00:39] groups of children and our families lord
[1:00:41] our church lord and you're
[1:00:43] giving us to protect love
[1:00:46] lord we pray over them lord we ask that
[1:00:48] you be merciful lord and that
[1:00:51] the spirit of pride don't take a hold of
[1:00:53] them
[1:00:55] and they don't think they know
[1:00:56] everything but
[1:00:57] that they got it all under control
[1:01:00] father i pray you give more grace
[1:01:03] lord even in our wrongs lord you made a
[1:01:05] way for us to be right
[1:01:07] lord i pray you
[1:01:09] touch each and every life in here right
[1:01:11] now
[1:01:12] lord each and every heart in here right
[1:01:14] now
[1:01:15] let us let us gather and go from just a

[1:09:35] from me to you guys

[1:10:18] lot of sermons a lot of preaching here a
[1:10:20] lot of youth services a lot of good
[1:10:22] things are said we've had some powerful
[1:10:24] things said the last time brother was
[1:10:26] out there on the patio said some
[1:10:27] powerful things and i still remember
[1:10:30] remember brother diggs
[1:10:32] every time he's spoken at our church or
[1:10:33] something specific let me just stop and
[1:10:36] say tonight was even more different
[1:10:39] than that
[1:10:40] yeah and i know and i'm just going to
[1:10:43] speak real personal guys i don't
[1:10:44] normally do this
[1:10:46] but i'm just going to speak real
[1:10:47] personal and say i know
[1:10:49] i watched
[1:10:50] as the holy spirit began to speak and i
[1:10:53] watched i'm just going to say it like
[1:10:54] this i'll watch resistance on some of
[1:10:57] you
[1:10:58] and i know your mind was going to war
[1:11:00] and going to battle and i'm just going
[1:11:01] to go ahead and say this
[1:11:03] i didn't talk to other things
[1:11:05] now those of you who there are some of
[1:11:07] you who know exactly what i'm speaking
[1:11:09] about right now and some of you won't
[1:11:10] that's fine
[1:11:11] i promise i give you my word i didn't
[1:11:14] have a conversation with other things
[1:11:16] i was so blown away i texted another
[1:11:18] brother and said did you say something
[1:11:20] to brother diggs before he right before
[1:11:22] he came we'll miss before he came up
[1:11:24] here to speak to us nope not a word
[1:11:27] i know that's what some of you were
[1:11:29] thinking i'm positive
[1:11:31] you were thinking oh they had brother
[1:11:33] diggs they let him in on what's going on
[1:11:35] that he knows what's going on and so
[1:11:36] they said something to him i didn't say
[1:11:38] nothing what you watched was a blood
[1:11:42] hammer
[1:11:44] who yielded himself to the holy spirit
[1:11:46] the other day he sat over there at that
[1:11:47] table and said brother matt's what i
[1:11:49] want to speak of i want to talk about
[1:11:50] protections that sounds good brother
[1:11:52] davis i want to talk about this i didn't
[1:11:53] say nothing i sat there and listened and
[1:11:55] heard and watched brother dick just go
[1:11:58] down online
[1:11:59] and so i don't want you to miss it don't
[1:12:02] chalk this up as brother diggs just got
[1:12:05] lucky i think that ain't like
[1:12:07] that was divinely spoken
[1:12:10] specific to specific situations in this
[1:12:14] group
[1:12:17] so
[1:12:19] let me just reiterate just for a moment
[1:12:21] let me just reiterate and say
[1:12:23] listen to what you heard
[1:12:26] about boundaries brother diggs talked
[1:12:28] about protection
[1:12:30] and he gave us story after story and
[1:12:32] tamar and
[1:12:34] and samson and delilah
[1:12:37] and he talked about
[1:12:39] samson's parents
[1:12:41] you know what's incredible what's
[1:12:42] incredible is that samson looked at mom
[1:12:45] and dad but mom and dad are saying man
[1:12:48] come on samson what are you doing
[1:12:50] isn't there any girls from among our own
[1:12:52] people that you've got to go and take
[1:12:54] from the daughter of the philistines
[1:12:56] and samson says get her
[1:12:57] you know the problem was when you read
[1:12:59] that in judges 13 14 wherever you were
[1:13:02] reading from brother davis when you read
[1:13:04] that and samson's saying just get her
[1:13:06] and you're thinking what are you doing
[1:13:08] are you crazy samson what are you doing
[1:13:11] you know what the problem was
[1:13:13] is the problem with me when i was a
[1:13:14] teenager when i was your age i looked at
[1:13:17] mom and dad when mom and dad would sit
[1:13:19] me down and they'd tell me and if they
[1:13:21] point to something i had done something
[1:13:23] i was doing and they'd start to give me
[1:13:25] this lecture
[1:13:27] there we go here's the lecture
[1:13:31] and you look at them and that's just mom
[1:13:33] that's just dad they don't understand
[1:13:35] that's his mom that's his death you know
[1:13:37] what samson didn't recognize is that it
[1:13:39] wasn't mom and dad
[1:13:41] it was vessels of mercy right that were
[1:13:43] trying to put a roadblock
[1:13:46] in samson's leg to say turn around go
[1:13:49] the other way
[1:13:50] stop hazard road closed
[1:13:53] do not enter you ever seen those while
[1:13:55] you're driving down the road you see the
[1:13:57] yellow flashing light saying turn around
[1:13:59] stop don't enter road closed bridge is
[1:14:02] broken
[1:14:03] how many people are y'all know someone
[1:14:05] else gets in their car and just drives
[1:14:07] right through those barricades and just
[1:14:08] bam bam sandbags barrels going
[1:14:11] everywhere and they just go right
[1:14:12] through the right through the broken
[1:14:14] bridge you know anybody that does that
[1:14:15] no
[1:14:16] but i know people who do that
[1:14:18] when god puts barrier after barrier
[1:14:21] after barrier after barrier
[1:14:23] and then god sends a servant brother
[1:14:25] dicks and then he sends out another
[1:14:26] warning sign now i just want to stop
[1:14:29] here for a moment because i can't do
[1:14:31] what brother diggs did here tonight
[1:14:33] parents can't do tony and amber can't do
[1:14:35] jason amy stephen emily the rest of us
[1:14:37] brad and sarah we can't do
[1:14:39] we we have weapons that we use to attack
[1:14:42] the devil and and his and his and his
[1:14:45] workings in our own kid's life what
[1:14:47] brother diggs did we can't do
[1:14:49] i couldn't have said the same the things
[1:14:51] that brother dick said that meant the
[1:14:52] same thing to my own kids and even some
[1:14:55] of you but brother dave don't know you
[1:14:57] like i know you don't know you like your
[1:14:59] parents know you
[1:15:01] brother diggs wasn't privy to anything
[1:15:03] happening
[1:15:04] and yet the servant of the lord yielded
[1:15:06] himself so i just want to not i just
[1:15:08] didn't want
[1:15:09] us to sing and then we go about our
[1:15:11] business
[1:15:12] and we miss this moment
[1:15:15] when the lord is trying to use trying to
[1:15:17] speak
[1:15:18] so i just want to take just a moment and
[1:15:21] slow down for a second and say
[1:15:23] don't miss
[1:15:25] this
[1:15:26] word from the lord
[1:15:28] because it was direct
[1:15:30] it was direct and for some of you it was
[1:15:32] for every single one of you young old
[1:15:35] for every single one of you
[1:15:37] but i believe the holy spirit
[1:15:39] has the answer
[1:15:40] do you believe that young people
[1:15:43] the lord has the answer
[1:15:45] and it isn't mom and dad and you you
[1:15:47] think that they're just you know oh
[1:15:48] that's mom that's bad and they're just
[1:15:51] let me just stop and say
[1:15:52] there's there's no time there's no uh
[1:15:55] there's no moral
[1:15:57] uh you know authority speaking when i s
[1:16:00] when you when when i speak to you when
[1:16:02] you when your parents speak to you it
[1:16:04] isn't from some pers some position of
[1:16:06] moral authority that you know i'm so
[1:16:09] good and i'm so righteous and you're so
[1:16:10] wrong and you need to straighten up
[1:16:12] that's not why that's not why brother
[1:16:14] matt stops what he's doing could've just
[1:16:16] came up here and saying he closed the
[1:16:17] meeting it was good why i'm constrained
[1:16:20] to stop and and compel you
[1:16:24] is because i love you
[1:16:27] you know what love does when you love
[1:16:29] somebody that means you value who they
[1:16:31] are
[1:16:32] you value who they are as a person right
[1:16:35] and because i love you and i value who
[1:16:37] you are mike i value you noah caleb now
[1:16:40] started calling names i gotta call
[1:16:42] everybody i value all of you
[1:16:45] and because of that value that i hold
[1:16:47] for you because i love you
[1:16:50] then there's action that comes behind
[1:16:52] that to where i'll speak the truth
[1:16:55] even if it hurts your feelings and i am
[1:16:58] so thankful
[1:16:59] that god sends people in my life when i
[1:17:02] need to be corrected and i have friends
[1:17:04] who love me enough
[1:17:06] they can come and tell me the truth
[1:17:09] you know what a false prophet is a
[1:17:10] person who'll tell you everything you
[1:17:12] want to hear
[1:17:13] but a true prophet a true a true
[1:17:15] minister of the lord doesn't does he
[1:17:18] doesn't spare your feelings doesn't care
[1:17:20] if it's going to hurt you he's going to
[1:17:22] speak the truth
[1:17:25] and so because of love i'm constrained
[1:17:28] to say
[1:17:29] don't chalk this up don't let the devil
[1:17:32] rob you and think oh brother brother
[1:17:34] matt rachel amber tony someone said
[1:17:37] something i know someone brad sarah
[1:17:39] mentioned something they had a
[1:17:40] conversation for the days that didn't
[1:17:41] happen
[1:17:42] what happened brother diggs i heard
[1:17:43] brother dicks he sat here and he said
[1:17:45] man i just can't get off relationships
[1:17:51] and he stopped and said
[1:17:52] interesting
[1:17:54] never heard nick say that
[1:17:57] he couldn't get off of it you know why
[1:17:59] because the lord jesus now i've watched
[1:18:01] this i've watched brother dave's i could
[1:18:03] say over a dozen times
[1:18:05] come because he's got a gift in his life
[1:18:07] god gives gifts and i've watched brother
[1:18:10] diggs in our assembly
[1:18:12] over a dozen times come not knowing a
[1:18:15] thing drove straight out of work from
[1:18:18] columbia two hours gets the church gets
[1:18:20] in a pulpit and then he starts to speak
[1:18:23] direct words of things i spoke to my
[1:18:26] kids or me and my wife out of
[1:18:27] conversation and he repeats it the same
[1:18:29] way that i said it and he's black and
[1:18:31] i'm white and he don't talk like me he
[1:18:32] said the same way i said
[1:18:36] now you laugh but that's i'm serious
[1:18:38] brother dicks had said statements before
[1:18:41] and it's i've never brothered wouldn't
[1:18:43] say it like that but he said it just how
[1:18:45] i said it just so god can confirm to me
[1:18:47] and say that's not brother diggs that's
[1:18:49] me yeah
[1:18:51] i've watched that happen over and over
[1:18:53] and over and over again
[1:18:55] i want to say thank you brother biggs
[1:18:58] thank you for yielding
[1:19:00] and let the lord use you let's bow our
[1:19:02] heads all stand up
[1:19:11] bow your heads with me young people
[1:19:13] lord we just stop
[1:19:15] just for a moment
[1:19:17] not letting this moment lower because
[1:19:19] it's too special
[1:19:22] amen the devil would just want us to
[1:19:24] hurry and
[1:19:26] get past it move on
[1:19:31] but lord it's moments like these that
[1:19:35] we can stop
[1:19:37] and we can contemplate
[1:19:40] and lord you called us to do that
[1:19:43] your word teaches us to examine ourself
[1:19:47] to test ourselves
[1:19:49] see if we'd be in the faith
[1:19:51] to make our call to the election short
[1:19:54] so lord your word came here tonight it
[1:19:56] was very laser guided
[1:20:01] i believe lord jesus
[1:20:03] it's you it's not me it's not
[1:20:07] it's all of our effort lord and
[1:20:08] everything we're trying to do is trying
[1:20:10] to do anything we can to help these
[1:20:12] young people who we love so much
[1:20:15] that we've been right where they're at
[1:20:18] lord we're in the trenches fighting with
[1:20:20] them now we're not their enemy don't
[1:20:21] ever let the devil tell them that
[1:20:23] there's nobody here nobody working with
[1:20:26] the young people that's their enemy we
[1:20:28] put these kind of things on not to
[1:20:30] chastise not to not to rebuke
[1:20:34] lord that's not what it's about it's not
[1:20:35] pointing a finger
[1:20:37] and and
[1:20:38] and trying to condemn lord but because
[1:20:41] of love
[1:20:44] because we love them because we care for
[1:20:47] them because we value who they are
[1:20:51] lord then we hold gatherings like this
[1:20:52] we invite ministers and a brother comes
[1:20:54] and the word is spoken and even brother
[1:20:57] diggs didn't know why he was staying on
[1:20:59] what he was speaking about couldn't make
[1:21:01] sense of it lord but you do
[1:21:03] now god i just asked that you would
[1:21:05] allow each one of us who are just clay
[1:21:08] full of mistakes and failures and faults
[1:21:12] lord i pray that you'd be mindful as we
[1:21:14] raise our hands tonight as the man lord
[1:21:16] said i believe lord but help thou my
