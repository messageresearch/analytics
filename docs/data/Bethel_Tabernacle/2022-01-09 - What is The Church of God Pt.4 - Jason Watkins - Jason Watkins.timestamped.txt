[27:43] it's a different amber
[27:45] in this case thank the lord it's a
[27:46] different amber because

[27:50] mother let's see out there is her mother
[27:52] grandmother um
[27:55] oh yeah it's her mother who had a stroke
[27:58] and

[28:05] awakeness like her eyes but she's not
[28:08] fully and they can't seem to bring her
[28:10] out of it
[28:11] um
[28:12] they they try to get her to move her
[28:14] head um you know but they're not getting
[28:16] a lot of response and now they're
[28:18] starting to be organ failure so this

[28:35] god
[28:36] wills
[28:37] be done
[28:39] um in my mother's life i tell you that's
[28:41] a real surrendered heart when you can
[28:43] just say whatever is the perfect will of
[28:45] god then that's a real surrendered heart

[30:19] sister emily curtis our son-in-law asked
[30:21] the church to pray for his firefighter
[30:23] interview
[30:25] it's his fourth and it's a long one two
[30:27] hours in front of a panel of people so
[30:30] it's a really important job a transition
[30:32] for him so
[30:33] let's ask the lord's blessing
[30:35] upon that amen praise god
[30:39] let's just go to prayer and we will pray
[30:41] with these needs in prayer with the
[30:43] reading of the word and then we'll have
[30:44] our scripture father
[30:47] we stand here today lord humble before
[30:50] you asking for your help
[30:52] this is a an amazing day lord
[30:55] for your bride
[30:57] realizing lord what we've been called to
[30:59] in this hour
[31:00] realizing also the challenges lord of
[31:03] the enemy who as the prophet would say
[31:05] he's your enemy and our enemy and lord
[31:09] we're appealing to you now for help
[31:11] today
[31:12] because your enemy and our enemy lord
[31:14] buffets us tries to keep us off track
[31:17] from receiving everything that god has
[31:20] for us in this hour
[31:22] we are committing ourselves to you fresh
[31:24] this morning we're asking for your word
[31:27] now lord to be powerful and effectual in
[31:29] our lives
[31:30] we're believing that you'll do it we
[31:32] know as we read our scripture
[31:35] that you of course have already blessed
[31:37] your word your word
[31:40] constantly there's a blessing just
[31:41] hearing it read there's a blessing in
[31:43] reading it and hearing it read that's
[31:46] pretty powerful but lord we need your
[31:48] blessing we need the blessing to be now
[31:50] upon the hearer to
[31:52] let the anointing
[31:53] of the composer come upon us so that we
[31:56] might
[31:58] be able to assimilate lord what we hear
[32:00] today because otherwise
[32:02] lord it just becomes words to us and so
[32:04] that would be dreadful if we were in
[32:06] that condition don't let that be so lord
[32:09] help us today to learn what we need to
[32:12] learn from your word i've
[32:14] have quite a bit of investment of time

[34:10] it's about and what's going on
[34:13] uh when it's happening
[34:14] all right haggai chapter two
[34:17] and we'll go verses 6-9
[34:22] for thus saith the lord of hosts
[34:24] yet once it is a little while
[34:27] and i will shake the heavens and the
[34:29] earth and the sea and the dry land
[34:33] and i will shake all nations
[34:35] and the desire of all nations shall come
[34:39] and i will fill this house with glory
[34:42] saith the lord of host
[34:43] the silver is mine and the gold is mine
[34:46] saith the lord of hosts the glory of
[34:49] this latter house
[34:51] shall be greater than of the former
[34:53] saith the lord of hosts and in this
[34:56] place will i give peace
[34:58] saith the lord of host
[35:00] so this beautiful promise
[35:03] uh that'll be know it's great
[35:05] fulfillment in the millennial reign
[35:07] but we we realize that you know the
[35:10] millennial reign isn't just
[35:12] something that just happens to happen
[35:15] there's a building up toward a
[35:17] millennial reign because the millennial
[35:19] reign is the kingdom of our lord
[35:22] remember and of his christ amen the
[35:25] kingdoms of this world shall be the
[35:28] kingdoms of our lord and of his christ
[35:30] amen
[35:31] and so we realize the kingdoms of our
[35:33] lord and of his christ we've taught on
[35:36] this before
[35:37] is the lord jesus and his bride amen and
[35:41] so we we've been preaching about
[35:44] uh the kingdom because uh when we talk
[35:47] about the church of god what is the true
[35:51] church of god it is the kingdom of god
[35:54] in the earth
[35:55] it is the mystical not natural
[35:58] supernatural
[36:00] mystical
[36:01] union
[36:03] between christ and his bride invisible
[36:06] to the world but very plain to those who
[36:10] have been born again amen and so it is a
[36:13] uniting time and we are
[36:16] filled and surrounded with uniting times
[36:20] and signs amen so let's
[36:23] let's uh let's let you have your seats
[36:26] may god bless the reading of his word
[36:28] god bless you you can be seated brother
[36:30] rhone you're still on for today amen
[36:32] praise the lord we've got a baptism
[36:35] after service today and
[36:38] baptize our young men come back to my
[36:40] office after the service last weekend
[36:42] and
[36:43] amen uh
[36:44] looking at a man whose fox's tale was on
[36:46] fire amen
[36:48] and wants to be baptized in the name of
[36:50] the lord jesus christ had this message
[36:52] witnessed to him by a good friend and
[36:55] made some contact with voice of god and
[36:57] they recommended him to this assembly
[37:00] because of the area he lives in savannah
[37:02] so we're happy to welcome him among us
[37:04] and the family of god we're going to
[37:05] baptize him today's fully surrendered
[37:08] his whole heart and life to the lord
[37:10] amen and and and ready to say amen to
[37:12] everything god has done in this hour not
[37:14] wonderful amen the lord steal heals the
[37:17] lord steal
[37:18] saves amen you mean you know that that
[37:21] that never the blood never loses its
[37:23] power you always want to remember that
[37:25] friends the same church today if brother
[37:28] branham said if it's the true church of
[37:30] god it writes another book of acts
[37:32] behind it
[37:33] amen and so we're happy for that today
[37:36] sister jean in her testimony when she
[37:39] was just a young woman uh she'd give her
[37:42] heart to the lord in a baptist church
[37:43] and her and brother eddie driving along
[37:45] they kept passing by this little video
[37:47] rundown building wasn't you know half a
[37:50] nothing building and uh i spent i spent
[37:53] many a a a service many hours in that
[37:55] little rundown building in service when
[37:57] i was a young teenager but when they
[37:59] would drive by it they had a sign out
[38:01] front that it was real simple just cut
[38:03] to the chase said jesus heals jesus
[38:06] saves
[38:07] this is genius like what does that mean
[38:09] what does that mean jesus heals jesus
[38:12] saves and so you know that was enough to
[38:14] get him in the door of course brother
[38:15] eddie said on the back row and when
[38:17] everything when the holy spirit broke
[38:19] out and everybody started screaming and
[38:20] shouting
[38:21] brother eddie said
[38:22] lord if you get me out of here i promise
[38:24] i'll never come back again
[38:27] oh my was that ever the beginning of a
[38:30] new life a whole new world for brother
[38:32] eddie and sister gene
[38:35] so we're loving god today and we want to
[38:37] just look into the word now and talk
[38:40] about
[38:40] this
[38:41] true church of god now
[38:44] last time and have my powerpoint uh
[38:46] ready thank you g and you're gonna run
[38:48] it back there yeah because i'm not set
[38:50] up to run it here we have it set up i
[38:52] just haven't got around to it yet amen
[38:54] brother jd we keep forgetting to do that
[38:56] but we'll get to it amen
[38:58] but um we've been looking and last time
[39:02] in part three
[39:04] we took
[39:05] uh somebody get me some water i think uh
[39:08] brother matt there you go brother luther
[39:10] amen he might be coming with it but i
[39:12] don't know uh he's not in the building
[39:14] yet but amen
[39:16] so we took uh revelation 8 1 and when he
[39:19] had opened the seventh seal there was
[39:22] silence in heaven about the space of
[39:25] half an hour
[39:26] now we know that when brother branham
[39:29] uh preached on the church ages
[39:33] in the revelation of jesus christ series
[39:36] from which the church age book was
[39:40] largely written of course it was
[39:42] everything that had came out of the
[39:44] seals also all the all the greater and
[39:46] deeper understandings that came to us
[39:47] with the opening of the seals
[39:49] but one of the things that we don't find
[39:52] brother branham ever altered and i can't
[39:54] find anywhere where he ever
[39:57] amended this statement as brother jd
[39:59] thinks sir as brother jd was showing us
[40:01] this morning there were things of
[40:03] progression
[40:06] to william branham as god continued to
[40:08] progress his understanding and to the
[40:11] degree that even when the seals would
[40:13] open brother branham would even make
[40:15] statements like you know his bible
[40:17] practically had become a brand new book
[40:20] and we realized that even from there it
[40:22] wasn't even finished it didn't all
[40:24] happen on those eight days there at penn
[40:26] street that two years later he's
[40:28] preaching what is the attraction on the
[40:30] mountain and he's just he's just
[40:33] enthralled with what happened back there
[40:36] on sunset mountain in the coronado
[40:38] forest north of tucson and he it's
[40:40] almost as if he's he's really grasping
[40:43] it now and it's really picking up steam
[40:46] and brother branham now is able to
[40:48] charge full steam to the time when the
[40:51] lord would take him from the earth and
[40:54] the lord took brother branham from the
[40:56] earth for one reason and one reason
[40:58] alone his mission was finished
[41:02] amen
[41:03] he didn't have anything to complete the
[41:05] the the final completion of the word and
[41:09] fulfillment would be accomplished by the
[41:11] bride under her prophet's ministry
[41:14] amen so we see that so clearly we don't
[41:17] struggle with that we've grown over the
[41:19] years we understand who we are and where
[41:21] we are in the word we
[41:24] we
[41:24] our our understanding it must always be
[41:27] subject to
[41:29] we're not here to redo the shout the
[41:31] shout doesn't need redoing
[41:33] we're here to be the lived voice of that
[41:35] shout amen
[41:37] and so one of the things that i cannot
[41:39] find where brother branham ever altered
[41:41] was when he interpreted this first verse
[41:45] of chapter 8 and when he had opened the
[41:47] seventh seal there was silence in heaven
[41:50] about the space of half an hour brother
[41:52] branham shows in the church age in the
[41:54] revelation of jesus christ series that
[41:57] heaven was empty for about the space of
[42:00] a half an hour and so i'm not here to
[42:03] cabbage down on that and try to and it's
[42:06] a little bit ambiguous exactly to what
[42:08] extent and what that means and i
[42:10] understand there's been preaching about
[42:12] the saints being here and hearing our
[42:14] services i don't i'm not here to i don't
[42:16] know no comment amen i'm not here to
[42:18] preach on that don't get me outside and
[42:20] ask me about it because i'm telling you
[42:21] all i know right now
[42:23] but
[42:24] but but but i but i do know this that
[42:27] that that that revelation chapter 8
[42:29] verse 1 was a monumental event
[42:33] and we do understand that there is a
[42:36] presence of christ that came at the end
[42:38] time according to all prophecy
[42:41] where there would be an invisible union
[42:43] in his bride that would do this it would
[42:46] take the omega bride
[42:48] further than any bride of any age had
[42:51] ever got to go
[42:53] it will take her all the way to a body
[42:55] change now we're not suggesting at all
[42:58] and i think it's erroneous teaching to
[43:00] suggest that our understanding would
[43:02] supersede william branham or that
[43:04] william branham's understanding would
[43:05] supersede saint paul i think that's not
[43:08] true but i do fee i do am aware that the
[43:11] alpha church
[43:12] fell away before they could go into a
[43:14] body change i do know that the omega
[43:16] bride won't do that
[43:20] she is
[43:21] predestinated to not do that she's
[43:25] predestinated to go in a rapture
[43:28] and so we we see this in balance and we
[43:31] don't get out of balance with it but but
[43:33] it's it's important for you to
[43:35] understand
[43:36] that that what this would have restored
[43:39] to us
[43:40] would have been the full uh effects of
[43:44] the kingdom of god in earth all right
[43:47] now
[43:48] by that i mean when
[43:50] you you know there's nothing that we
[43:53] believe doctrinally that paul didn't
[43:55] teach us
[43:57] people couldn't figure it all out and
[43:59] took a profit to come at the end time
[44:00] and get it all restored back and now
[44:02] it's clear
[44:03] amen but we realize that that what fell
[44:07] on the in the upper room was a promise
[44:10] of the father that's what peter told
[44:12] them this is what james taught this is
[44:15] what they all taught this is these men
[44:17] aren't drunk like you're thinking but
[44:19] this is god keeping his word this is a
[44:22] promise this is a jubilee this is the
[44:25] 50. this is pentecost this is what 4 000
[44:28] years of old testament history have been
[44:31] about
[44:32] we now have the jubilee we now have the
[44:36] not just a god above us or with us but
[44:39] now in us we not we don't we don't just
[44:41] have tables of stone but now he's
[44:45] written the word in our hearts
[44:48] amen and this now
[44:52] this now re restores the abstract title
[44:56] to the church and so that that's why
[44:59] paul could say there's now therefore no
[45:02] condemnation to them which are in christ
[45:04] because that church had come to their
[45:06] jubilee that church had come to an
[45:08] abstract title that church had come to
[45:11] real justification now
[45:13] that all got lost
[45:16] down through the ages and therefore the
[45:19] power which was always proportionate to
[45:21] the presence of god in the word of that
[45:23] hour the power ran proportionally and
[45:25] that's why brother branham when he comes
[45:27] to azusa he explains that one of the
[45:29] benefits of the azusa revival was that
[45:32] the church didn't really wasn't really
[45:34] they had justification under luther's
[45:36] restoration they had sanctified living
[45:38] under wesley's reformation but the
[45:40] church was lacking the the kind of power
[45:43] that they ought to have like the early
[45:46] book of acts church did and so god
[45:48] brings back a fresh anointing of the
[45:51] holy spirit of power and the gifts begin
[45:53] to operate again but even that wasn't
[45:56] the final picture there had to come a
[45:58] jubilee again there had to come a full
[46:01] abstract there had to come a token
[46:04] there had to be a restoration of the
[46:06] word at the end time because that last
[46:09] day bride was going to get a body change
[46:11] and that was going to take rapturing
[46:13] faith and since faith comes by hearing
[46:14] the word you're never going to get a
[46:16] rapturing faith unless you have a
[46:18] rapturing word
[46:20] and the rapturing word is the full word
[46:24] not a partial word
[46:26] we've explained that this is why he was
[46:28] alpha and omega this is why he's the
[46:31] first and the last and brother brandon
[46:32] would point out when he's standing there
[46:34] in the midst of seven lamp stands he's
[46:37] standing in the middle of it
[46:38] he's meaning he's walking in the midst
[46:41] of it he's in his church the whole time
[46:43] but his brother ben says like his hands
[46:45] are outstretched
[46:46] from alpha to omega but brother branham
[46:49] said notice there's nothing mentioned
[46:51] about in the middle yeah
[46:54] see it's the it's the alpha the omega
[46:56] it's the first and the last does that
[46:58] mean he wasn't in the middle no he
[47:00] certainly was in the middle but not
[47:02] everything in the middle was him
[47:05] there were things in the middle that
[47:07] were man-made ideology mingled and mixed
[47:10] with it amen you get that you see that
[47:12] picture i'm sure
[47:14] but but at the end time at the alpha
[47:16] there had to be a restoration
[47:18] uh uh uh in the omega of the alpha so
[47:22] that now he's the first and the last
[47:25] he's the amen he's the all of it
[47:28] and that's where we are friends you
[47:30] understand that's why this bride is
[47:32] going to go further than any other
[47:34] church age has ever been able to go
[47:39] she has become more
[47:41] a greater level of the living word than
[47:44] was ever possible and he said well
[47:46] where's her where's her book of acts all
[47:49] right
[47:50] we'll get to that in just in a minute
[47:51] don't want to get ahead of myself
[47:53] now let's let's pull up my powerpoint
[47:56] and we'll catch i only put up one quote
[47:59] uh so you guys didn't get the uh the one
[48:02] frets off of that says part three it's
[48:04] okay it's the same one i'd just amend it
[48:06] to say part four let's go to the next
[48:08] screen
[48:10] all right all right now we're only going
[48:12] to read this one quote and then i'm
[48:13] gonna you can take the powerpoint down
[48:15] brother brown in 1963 the world is
[48:17] falling apart
[48:18] what are we looking for friends
[48:21] what are we
[48:23] the real church
[48:25] is looking not for denomination
[48:28] not looking for a president not looking
[48:31] for a genius to rise up but they're
[48:34] looking for a kingdom
[48:36] and a king to come
[48:38] amen
[48:40] now you might
[48:41] hopefully you'll understand why i don't
[48:44] care if donald trump retakes the white
[48:47] house
[48:49] you'll understand why i don't lose sleep
[48:51] over sleepy joe sitting there now
[48:55] i don't care
[48:57] it would be impossible for me to care
[48:59] less than i already don't
[49:03] what
[49:05] got you blinking
[49:08] i'm not looking for a president i'm not
[49:10] looking for a genius to rise up here's
[49:12] what the real church they're looking for
[49:14] a kingdom and a king to come
[49:18] what is the kingdom is that a fair
[49:20] question
[49:21] would you like to know elijah's going to
[49:23] tell you what is the kingdom it's on
[49:25] earth now
[49:26] it's a spirit mystical body of christ
[49:30] in there in this kingdom they've come
[49:33] out of presbyterian methodist
[49:35] pentecostals and everything everything
[49:38] the bar rooms everything all right next
[49:40] slide
[49:42] they're in this kingdom
[49:44] they're this mystical one they're born
[49:46] in there they come in there by the
[49:49] baptism of the holy spirit and they're
[49:52] in this kingdom and we're looking
[49:55] for a king to come to this kingdom
[49:57] that'll set his kingdom up where
[50:02] here
[50:04] all right
[50:05] that'll set his kingdom up here
[50:08] on earth
[50:09] i'm so glad for that
[50:12] on his throne the throne of david that's
[50:15] the millennium all right he shall rule
[50:17] and reign forever that's
[50:20] what the church looks for
[50:24] so my my world view as brother matt was
[50:27] teaching us our world view is different
[50:29] from the world
[50:30] we have a completely different world
[50:32] view i don't view politics and science
[50:35] and education and religion and the
[50:37] social fabric and social trends i don't
[50:40] even view it like the world it's alien
[50:42] to me and i'm alien to it
[50:44] that's a born again believer that's why
[50:46] you're you're mystical
[50:48] you're mystic
[50:49] see
[50:50] and so you you live here in this natural
[50:53] world but you also live after the you
[50:57] live after the life of your rebirth amen
[51:00] see you don't just live after the life
[51:02] you came into this earth with that's
[51:04] your biology all right but a real
[51:07] believer lives after the kingdom of the
[51:09] rebirth
[51:10] amen my whole life is patterned after
[51:13] the kingdom of my rebirth
[51:15] so i'm an oddball to the world i'm a nut
[51:18] to the world i don't go with their
[51:21] trends they don't understand it i don't
[51:23] i don't understand why they don't
[51:25] understand
[51:27] they say you're you're strange well
[51:29] you're strange not you're strange
[51:31] thinking i'm strange
[51:33] because i'm acting the original way
[51:35] what's your problem amen amen
[51:38] so
[51:39] i mean who is the crazy one here see i
[51:42] mean if if i'm living after the order of
[51:45] my maker and you're not then who's crazy
[51:49] see so so we realize that he goes on
[51:51] here now watch
[51:53] so he says that's what the church looks
[51:55] for next slide
[51:58] and the good thing about it now you
[52:00] ready for some good news
[52:01] the good thing about it friends is think
[52:03] of this
[52:04] before we get to this kingdom in the
[52:06] millennium
[52:07] before this kingdom comes in the
[52:09] millennium
[52:10] now we can sit together in heavenly
[52:13] places in christ jesus already already
[52:16] you have to wait for the millennium you
[52:18] can sit with him right now lifted up
[52:20] above the shadows of all the corruption
[52:24] of the world and all their television
[52:27] programs and all their these other
[52:29] nonsense they got on the earth today
[52:32] they got a lot of nonsense amen
[52:34] all their rotten pollution and system
[52:37] and everything be lifted up in heavenly
[52:40] places and the holy spirit himself come
[52:44] upon us and speak out and call to us our
[52:48] sins thank god
[52:51] thank god
[52:52] come on call to us our sins thank god
[52:56] say why you're so thankful because i
[52:58] don't want to be sinful
[53:00] i hate being sinful all right watch
[53:02] he'll call it out to us all right
[53:05] i mean listen
[53:06] if
[53:08] if you didn't need him to do that you'd
[53:09] already be in the rapture
[53:11] so
[53:13] climb down off of your high horse
[53:16] you're not in the rapture
[53:17] you got issues
[53:20] all right
[53:22] watch now the pollution
[53:24] can't we so relate to that
[53:27] all their rotten pollution and systems
[53:30] and everything
[53:32] this is why i i sometimes i just i try
[53:35] my best sometimes to gently talk people
[53:37] back from the edge they get all bent
[53:39] over political issues and all kind of
[53:42] nonsense and they just get all twisted
[53:43] up and that's just exactly what the
[53:45] devil wants to happen

[54:47] god knew someday he'd reclaim you
[54:50] hallelujah and and god god got a hold of
[54:53] my life but sometimes we find ourselves

[56:05] watch here's here comes the rub ready
[56:08] ready for this next one you buckled up
[56:10] next screen
[56:12] all right
[56:13] see that's the actually the second one
[56:15] down but let's finish this spirit jesus
[56:17] christ the same yesterday and forever
[56:19] that's the king that shall come to his
[56:21] kingdom
[56:23] someday and his kingdom is now being
[56:25] established now right now in the hearts
[56:28] of the people here on earth now here we
[56:30] go
[56:31] that you what did you do now here's your
[56:33] problem prophet's going to tell your
[56:34] problem
[56:36] you put a true story magazine on your
[56:37] table instead of the bible
[56:40] instead of prayer meetings you had to
[56:42] run out somewhere and
[56:44] do something else
[56:47] it doesn't even say it's sinful
[56:50] just simply said instead of prayer
[56:52] meeting
[56:53] you
[56:55] did something else
[56:57] you just did
[57:00] we had prayer meeting but you were just
[57:01] you just did something else
[57:04] we had sunday service but
[57:06] well you just
[57:08] did something else
[57:11] and it poisons you
[57:13] and it poisons your children
[57:17] it poisons your grandchildren
[57:19] it brings problems in the church
[57:21] because instead of pursuing the kingdom
[57:24] you pursue other
[57:28] stuff
[57:30] amen amen
[57:32] now can i tell you something i purpose
[57:34] in my heart to do today
[57:36] not teaching
[57:38] but i purpose to slow down because last
[57:41] sunday we had quite a jubilee amen
[57:44] and i knew in my notes that we're going
[57:46] to get a little more we're going to
[57:48] bring the space shuttle down out of the
[57:49] sky
[57:50] and his rubber tires are going to meet
[57:52] the
[57:53] road
[57:55] so this is where the rubber
[57:57] of the space shuttle meets the landing
[58:00] strip road okay that be okay
[58:03] so watch
[58:06] but what did you do in other words why
[58:08] are you not enjoying this
[58:11] union this kingdom it's here now it's
[58:13] right now you can live in heavenly
[58:15] places it's it's here to be effectual
[58:17] effective in your life
[58:19] what's wrong
[58:20] why aren't you writing a book of acts
[58:23] see
[58:24] see the so he says here's what happened
[58:27] you you put a true story magazine on
[58:29] your table instead of the bible just
[58:31] replace true story magazine with
[58:32] anything that's not the
[58:34] all right bible
[58:36] just put
[58:37] you you did something else you went
[58:40] somewhere and do and and do something
[58:43] else just put what you went somewhere
[58:45] and do something else put put anything
[58:48] in place of that that's not coming to
[58:50] prayer meeting amen
[58:53] amen
[58:55] that's what's the matter
[58:58] with our so-called christians dancing
[59:02] parties social drinking and oh
[59:04] everything see
[59:05] it's parent delinquency not child
[59:08] delinquency the parent is delinquent
[59:12] that's the one now he's not saying that
[59:14] every parent is you know
[59:16] a beatnik or or a ricky or whatever he
[59:19] you used to term that he just simply
[59:21] saying you know you should have had the
[59:23] bible prominent in your home but you had
[59:25] a lot of other things prominent over the
[59:28] bible your schedule should have been to
[59:31] be at the house of god your schedule
[59:33] should have been to be at prayer
[59:34] meetings your schedule should have been
[59:36] a prayer closet that's what the
[59:38] priorities of your life ought to have
[59:40] been
[59:42] and the reason that you have
[59:44] you say what's what's the matter with me
[59:46] that's what's a matter
[59:48] that's why you have problems unresolved
[59:50] that's why marriages aren't as healthy
[59:52] as they need to be that's why young
[59:55] people take a longer than it should to
[59:57] get the holy ghost
[1:00:00] sometimes it takes teenagers years and
[1:00:02] years and years to get something that
[1:00:04] takes two seconds
[1:00:06] amen
[1:00:08] and it's not always a problem in the
[1:00:11] teenager
[1:00:12] it's a problem because there were too
[1:00:14] many other things in the home besides
[1:00:17] the bible there was too much other going
[1:00:21] somewhere
[1:00:22] other than to the house of god
[1:00:25] amen
[1:00:26] now come on we rejoiced last week oh we
[1:00:29] loved that study in the book of
[1:00:30] revelation didn't we
[1:00:32] all right so let's just be honest before
[1:00:34] god now don't don't be dishonest you
[1:00:36] make sure you stay honest before the
[1:00:37] lord
[1:00:38] you say amen to every
[1:00:40] word so he says it's not child
[1:00:43] delinquency the parent is delinquent
[1:00:46] that's the one thank you brother jackson
[1:00:48] you can take that down and just be be
[1:00:50] ready because i'm going to have you pull
[1:00:51] up several scriptures so get that
[1:00:53] program ready to go
[1:00:56] you know
[1:00:57] it's it's amazing when we looking at our
[1:01:01] lives and you say well
[1:01:03] why
[1:01:05] why is it that
[1:01:07] that
[1:01:08] that if if i'm a child of god then okay
[1:01:12] fine thank you
[1:01:13] can i just live my life and if i'm a
[1:01:15] child of god why do you always trying to
[1:01:18] pull me into a certain direction
[1:01:20] preacher well that's what preachers do
[1:01:22] and they they they they they comfort the
[1:01:26] afflicted and they afflict the
[1:01:27] comfortable amen and so
[1:01:30] so we but but you know you know why
[1:01:34] as children of god
[1:01:36] you believe you have a seed of god
[1:01:39] well do you know why god won't let that
[1:01:40] just go it willy-nilly because the kind
[1:01:43] of seed it is
[1:01:45] it's a light seed amen
[1:01:48] remember brother branham used the
[1:01:49] analogy about a blackness and he says
[1:01:52] the blackness represented the world he
[1:01:53] said every once in a while you see a
[1:01:54] little streak of light go through there
[1:01:56] and he said that's a little believer
[1:01:58] moving through a sea of darkness a sea
[1:02:01] of blackness and there's a little streak
[1:02:03] of light moving in there that everyone's
[1:02:04] like oh there went oh there's a little
[1:02:06] streak of light
[1:02:07] and and your seed that is in you is a
[1:02:10] light seed
[1:02:12] and therefore your
[1:02:14] your whole seed is to produce light
[1:02:18] to a dark world and i'm here to tell you
[1:02:21] this family of god this
[1:02:23] multicultural multi-racial people
[1:02:27] we're made up of another kind of
[1:02:29] material if you're looking for a kingdom
[1:02:32] let me tell you why you have a desire
[1:02:34] for a kingdom because you have a
[1:02:36] different kind of seed and you're made
[1:02:38] from a different kind of material and
[1:02:41] thusly you will never ever ever ever
[1:02:45] ever did i say ever you will never
[1:02:48] ever find peace happiness and
[1:02:52] contentment until you let your little
[1:02:54] light shine
[1:02:57] amen
[1:02:59] we're made from another material male
[1:03:01] and female jew or gentile bond or free
[1:03:05] we're made of a material that doesn't
[1:03:08] buckle down to the god of this evil age
[1:03:12] and that just is
[1:03:14] and you should just rejoice to say i i i
[1:03:18] don't want to buck the system i don't
[1:03:19] want to be an outcast i don't want to
[1:03:21] get persecuted i'm sorry you're a light
[1:03:24] seed and you're a different material and
[1:03:27] god's got you here for a different
[1:03:28] reason
[1:03:32] we're of a different kingdom
[1:03:35] remember we read our in our quote
[1:03:37] brother branham said we're looking for a
[1:03:39] kingdom
[1:03:40] listen friends
[1:03:44] there's only one man
[1:03:47] leaving
[1:03:49] in the translation
[1:03:52] there's only one man
[1:03:54] leaving at rapture time i'm here to tell
[1:03:57] you there's only one man going in the
[1:04:00] translation
[1:04:01] and that's jesus christ
[1:04:05] he's brother branham said he's he's cut
[1:04:07] he sent the whole gospel
[1:04:09] for the whole man by that i mean that he
[1:04:13] you're not god's intention is not to get
[1:04:16] you in a rapture by by displaying part
[1:04:20] of christ
[1:04:22] he brother brown said he's not coming
[1:04:24] back for a deformed bride
[1:04:26] you understand
[1:04:28] so it's not a partial bride it's a full
[1:04:31] bride
[1:04:32] the full body the full man brother
[1:04:35] branham says
[1:04:36] that's the only way to the gospel of
[1:04:39] salvation
[1:04:40] the gospel of deliverance this is from
[1:04:42] sirs we would see jesus the full gospel
[1:04:45] for the full man for the full son for
[1:04:48] the full daughter all the gospel all
[1:04:51] that he said all that he done all that
[1:04:53] he promised to every person that will
[1:04:56] believe it 65 in paradox you can't go on
[1:04:59] you've got to come back to the entire
[1:05:02] full gospel it was made for the full man
[1:05:06] by a complete god who was made flesh and
[1:05:09] dwelt among us so it's not part of him
[1:05:11] taken in a rapture it's the fullness of
[1:05:14] him
[1:05:16] this is my why hence my statement the
[1:05:18] only one translating is christ
[1:05:20] you see so that's why she is him it's
[1:05:24] christ fully manifested in a bride
[1:05:28] that's the one going in the rapture
[1:05:32] see
[1:05:34] think of it friends a bride
[1:05:37] who is prophesied to come not close not
[1:05:39] similar not sort of kinda
[1:05:42] but she's literally prophesied thus
[1:05:44] saith the lord
[1:05:45] pick up your pen and write and write
[1:05:47] these words and read them back to the
[1:05:49] church this is what i'm saying
[1:05:52] every seed brings forth after its kind
[1:05:54] and in the end of it all she comes into
[1:05:56] his very image you make sure you tell
[1:05:58] her that prophet make sure that you tell
[1:06:01] her what the goal is so that if she
[1:06:04] knows what i'm doing she'll understand
[1:06:07] why i'm doing in her life what i'm doing
[1:06:10] why i won't leave them alone why i keep
[1:06:12] knocking them down and picking them up
[1:06:14] and knocking them down and picking them
[1:06:15] up why i keep the preacher hammering
[1:06:17] them and hammering them and hammering
[1:06:18] them why i won't give them sleep why
[1:06:20] i'll do whatever i got to do if i lay
[1:06:22] them flat on their back to the only way
[1:06:23] they can do is look up
[1:06:25] i'm going to make sure they look up
[1:06:27] somehow whatever i got to do
[1:06:29] because i'm i'm i'm they're they're
[1:06:32] coming into my very image some of you
[1:06:35] today
[1:06:38] some of you with not even many years
[1:06:39] under your belt
[1:06:41] can already testify
[1:06:43] i could point to several people in here
[1:06:45] and say
[1:06:46] young man young woman you could testify
[1:06:48] that the way of a transgressor is hard
[1:06:50] and god knows how to get his man
[1:06:53] see and so it's all about surrendering
[1:06:55] and not fighting that fight because
[1:06:57] you'll fight it you will surrender
[1:06:58] anyway
[1:07:00] see
[1:07:01] but his goal
[1:07:03] is that there would be those little
[1:07:04] streaks of light there'd be thousands of
[1:07:07] lived voices
[1:07:08] who would be echoing his word daily in
[1:07:11] their lives saying amen to every word
[1:07:14] and all that it calls for and our
[1:07:17] dedication to him
[1:07:20] this is what it means
[1:07:22] to be
[1:07:24] the church
[1:07:25] of god
[1:07:28] that's what the church of god
[1:07:30] is all about amen
[1:07:32] so the rapture then becomes friends this
[1:07:35] is it's people who have surrendered
[1:07:37] their lives
[1:07:39] to the kingdom order
[1:07:41] and there's a kingdom ordered everything
[1:07:42] we've been saying that you're going to
[1:07:43] say it a few more times
[1:07:45] there's an order
[1:07:48] that operates in god's kingdom
[1:07:50] and all members of his kingdom should
[1:07:52] operate according to that order and they
[1:07:54] shouldn't allow their lives you see when
[1:07:57] you have true story magazines on your
[1:07:59] table instead of the bible that's not
[1:08:00] kingdom order
[1:08:02] kingdom orders flips that kingdom order
[1:08:04] puts the bible there and puts put the
[1:08:06] true story magazines in the trash
[1:08:08] kingdom order is not doing other things
[1:08:11] somewhere else when it's prayer meeting
[1:08:13] kingdom order is have your family at
[1:08:15] prayer meeting and if you've got time to
[1:08:17] do other things fine because you're
[1:08:19] supposed to be seeking that kingdom and
[1:08:22] its righteousness
[1:08:24] first
[1:08:25] in your life
[1:08:28] say i i i gotta i gotta work i gotta
[1:08:31] make money and jesus said you're not
[1:08:33] even considered the sparrow
[1:08:36] you you know
[1:08:37] you haven't even even thought about the
[1:08:38] lily
[1:08:40] here you are chasing
[1:08:42] fair you know all you're going to do is
[1:08:43] get chained up to pharaoh's chariot
[1:08:45] chasing fortune and glory you're just
[1:08:47] going to be a slave to it those people
[1:08:49] who do that aren't happy they still jump
[1:08:52] out of 50-story buildings they still
[1:08:54] live on tranquilizers and od all the
[1:08:56] time
[1:08:57] hollywood's filled with them sports
[1:08:58] stars do it all the time check out early
[1:09:00] committing suicide why because there's
[1:09:02] no happiness in that
[1:09:05] there's all kinds of pleasure but
[1:09:06] there's no happiness
[1:09:08] see
[1:09:10] it's just poisonous
[1:09:13] so those who have surrendered their
[1:09:14] lives to kingdom order
[1:09:18] the rapture say brother jason what is
[1:09:20] the rapture
[1:09:21] the rapture is when he has taken
[1:09:25] he the rapture is when
[1:09:27] remember i said there's only one going
[1:09:29] in the translation and that's the full
[1:09:31] christ amen all right and it's made up
[1:09:34] of many pieces
[1:09:36] his body is made up of of saints around
[1:09:38] the world in every culture every creed
[1:09:41] every race every gender you got me every
[1:09:43] doesn't matter he's got many pieces to
[1:09:46] this body of christ that he's perfecting
[1:09:49] and the rapture is when he has all the
[1:09:52] pieces perfectly formed all the pieces
[1:09:56] brought to their position then all the
[1:09:59] pieces are suddenly uh uh assembled and
[1:10:03] taken up to glory
[1:10:05] that's the rapture
[1:10:07] say it again when he's got all the
[1:10:09] pieces perfected and all the pieces in
[1:10:12] their order in kingdom order then he
[1:10:14] then suddenly oh he comes out of glory
[1:10:17] and the dead saints rise and then he
[1:10:19] takes all of those perfected pieces and
[1:10:22] he assembles them all together and it's
[1:10:24] one body going home
[1:10:27] amen that's what the rapture is all
[1:10:30] about
[1:10:33] you're privileged to know it that way
[1:10:35] friends
[1:10:36] would say some teenagers you're
[1:10:37] privileged to know
[1:10:39] that it's not
[1:10:40] as the world thinks
[1:10:42] that a giant conveyor a giant escalator
[1:10:45] is going to drop down out of the sky
[1:10:47] gabriel's going to step forward blow a
[1:10:49] trumpet and a red carpet's going to come
[1:10:51] down jesus is going to walk down and say
[1:10:53] okay everybody we're going home now
[1:10:58] fly off course cars crashed off the
[1:11:00] street i don't know what what will
[1:11:02] happen you know when this bride leaves
[1:11:04] but i know this i ain't looking for a
[1:11:06] conveyor belt
[1:11:07] i ain't looking for an escalator i've
[1:11:09] already heard a trumpet sound
[1:11:11] hallelujah i've already heard a shout a
[1:11:13] voice that come up higher
[1:11:15] hallelujah and that's where my life is
[1:11:17] i've already heard that
[1:11:24] sometimes the kingdom life requires
[1:11:28] us to
[1:11:30] think king it doesn't just sometimes it
[1:11:32] always requires us to think in kingdom
[1:11:34] thoughts
[1:11:35] now
[1:11:38] that's easier said than done sometimes
[1:11:41] um
[1:11:43] and and and the thing that
[1:11:45] that really
[1:11:48] really gets in the way and let's just
[1:11:50] i'm gonna use a a bad word here you
[1:11:52] ready i'm sorry to say this in front of
[1:11:54] your children pride
[1:12:00] it's one of the baddest words you can
[1:12:01] say
[1:12:03] is pride
[1:12:04] see
[1:12:06] you know something friends you know what
[1:12:07] brother jason has found in my life
[1:12:11] you know how i stay little in my own
[1:12:12] sight
[1:12:14] because i i've not ever been too
[1:12:17] victorious
[1:12:18] you know
[1:12:19] conquering spiritual mountains for the
[1:12:21] lord i've i've tried and struggled and
[1:12:23] went around the world preaching the
[1:12:24] gospel but i always feel like i'm behind
[1:12:26] the eight ball i always feel like i'm
[1:12:27] playing catch up
[1:12:28] i'm just being honest with you i always
[1:12:30] feel that way about myself
[1:12:33] and it just seemed like i'm always
[1:12:35] repenting for mediocrity lord i'm so
[1:12:37] sorry why do you fool with me goodness
[1:12:39] i'd have kicked me to the curb so long
[1:12:41] ago
[1:12:42] and then i then i rolled on the other
[1:12:44] side and raised up my hands and cried
[1:12:45] and said thank you for not kicking me to
[1:12:47] the curb
[1:12:48] thank you for staying with me thank you
[1:12:50] for keep going thank you for not
[1:12:51] quitting me lord
[1:12:53] hallelujah
[1:12:55] i'm going to tell you something friends
[1:12:56] the weight the the way to avoid thinking
[1:12:59] more highly of yourself than you should
[1:13:02] is to make sure you stand in front of
[1:13:04] two mirrors
[1:13:06] see
[1:13:10] a lot of people go in front of a mirror
[1:13:12] and pride fills them with vanity
[1:13:18] pretense
[1:13:20] um
[1:13:21] what's the word entitlement
[1:13:23] people get a sense of entitlement like
[1:13:26] the world owes them
[1:13:27] teenagers get a sense of entitlement
[1:13:29] like my parents oh me
[1:13:32] husbands get a sense of entitlement
[1:13:33] wives get that preachers get that
[1:13:36] people get a sense of entitlement you
[1:13:38] see
[1:13:39] because they stand in front of that
[1:13:41] mirror and they look at their image and
[1:13:42] they primp and they pose
[1:13:45] and and and they make all of these great
[1:13:48] plans to how great their life can be and
[1:13:50] how beautiful they can become and what
[1:13:52] they can accomplish and you know that
[1:13:54] you know they they've earned their place
[1:13:56] at the top of the at the top of the heap
[1:13:58] and and i would just simply say to you
[1:14:01] leave that mirror and go stand in front
[1:14:02] of this one
[1:14:05] because if you'll stand in front of this
[1:14:06] mirror you'll come back to that mirror
[1:14:08] thinking different
[1:14:10] you'll stand in when you stand in front
[1:14:12] of this mirror friends i want to give
[1:14:14] you a little life lesson that i've
[1:14:15] practiced and i've learned
[1:14:17] when you are willing to go stand in
[1:14:19] front of this mirror and let it tell you
[1:14:20] about you
[1:14:22] when you go back to the other mirror
[1:14:23] you're just so glad to be alive
[1:14:27] you feel privileged to even be able to
[1:14:28] stand there and pray a prayer
[1:14:31] you you realize that if it wasn't for
[1:14:32] the grace of god you you were on you
[1:14:34] were on your way to death and you
[1:14:36] couldn't save yourself and there's
[1:14:37] nothing you could do about it if he
[1:14:38] hadn't had mercy on you
[1:14:40] you'd be nothing and we're still nothing
[1:14:43] he's on he only he's everything at the
[1:14:45] end jesus said when the servant has done
[1:14:48] all that has asked of him he shall still
[1:14:51] say i was the lord's unprofitable
[1:14:53] servant
[1:14:54] see
[1:14:55] and and and that that will humble you
[1:14:58] because you'll be so aware
[1:15:00] you'll be so painfully aware you know
[1:15:02] what you you know you know what standing
[1:15:04] in front of this mirror has done for
[1:15:06] jason you know what it's done for me
[1:15:08] brother jason watkins pastor jason you
[1:15:10] know what the standing front of this
[1:15:11] mirror has done for me
[1:15:13] because i stand in front of this mirror
[1:15:16] when i go stand in the other mirror and
[1:15:18] i look at that guy staring back at me
[1:15:21] i realize that that that guy looking at
[1:15:24] me
[1:15:25] far more than lucifer is my greatest
[1:15:27] enemy
[1:15:29] amen
[1:15:30] can i say that again
[1:15:32] when i stare in this mirror and then i
[1:15:34] go look at the other mirror
[1:15:35] i realize that i that that that i am
[1:15:39] more my own enemy far more than lucifer
[1:15:41] has ever been a great enemy i'm the one
[1:15:44] you know uh and and and and i'm the one
[1:15:48] that needs brought under subjection to
[1:15:49] the word
[1:15:51] there's no sense blaming the devil he's
[1:15:54] never going to be subject to the word
[1:15:56] he's that window is passed for him he
[1:15:58] made that choice aeons ago
[1:16:00] so i'm not here to try to reform the
[1:16:02] devil
[1:16:03] i'm here to try to look at that man in
[1:16:05] the mirror and say repent
[1:16:07] because only in christ are you are you
[1:16:10] worth anything at all
[1:16:13] and only by the mercy of god do i even
[1:16:15] stand here today as a believer
[1:16:18] that is the that's what the real church
[1:16:21] of god
[1:16:22] is amen
[1:16:24] so nobody gets entitled
[1:16:27] to to think more highly of themselves
[1:16:29] than they ought
[1:16:31] it'll cure your pride you know right
[1:16:34] quick i promise you that
[1:16:39] this order of the kingdom
[1:16:42] that i'm speaking about today
[1:16:45] this should
[1:16:46] you should desire
[1:16:50] this kingdom
[1:16:52] this kingdom way
[1:16:55] this kingdom lifestyle
[1:16:57] you have a hope of the resurrection
[1:17:00] four people you have a hope of the
[1:17:02] resurrection
[1:17:04] 70 of the people do you have a hope of
[1:17:06] the resurrection
[1:17:07] i sure hope you do
[1:17:10] see
[1:17:11] and and and if you desire that
[1:17:14] resurrection
[1:17:15] then your desire you should desire this
[1:17:18] order of the kingdom in your life
[1:17:22] more than your daily bread
[1:17:24] or the breath you breathe in your lungs
[1:17:28] it should be that paramount to you you
[1:17:30] know you you you you will want
[1:17:34] to i you know to where you to where you
[1:17:37] you will want
[1:17:39] to want this
[1:17:40] more than all your other wants amen
[1:17:43] because we're humans
[1:17:45] we have other wants
[1:17:47] amen not saying you know you're going to
[1:17:49] be a monk and live in a commune you live
[1:17:50] in the world
[1:17:52] paul said that you can't even you know
[1:17:54] paul said you should you should leave
[1:17:55] the world and and the church wrote him
[1:17:58] back you know history shows the church
[1:18:00] wrote him back with a question what do
[1:18:01] you how do we what do you mean leave the
[1:18:03] world should we go join a commune we
[1:18:05] have jobs careers what are you saying
[1:18:06] paul we should form a form of cult and
[1:18:09] paul writes back in his second letter he
[1:18:10] says now when i said to you
[1:18:12] you should leave the world of course i
[1:18:14] wasn't meaning you live you do live here
[1:18:16] you do work here you do your whole
[1:18:18] you're here for a reason you're here to
[1:18:19] be a light so no don't go live in a
[1:18:21] commune but but also don't live here you
[1:18:24] you got to keep this in mind that while
[1:18:25] you live here you're not from here
[1:18:28] that you're from another world and while
[1:18:29] you're here you're to reflect the life
[1:18:31] of the other world that you come from to
[1:18:34] where you take all your wants and that
[1:18:37] this kingdom you end up wanting this
[1:18:39] kingdom you and and and a lot of times i
[1:18:42] can say that there's been times where
[1:18:44] i've had to be honest looking in god's
[1:18:46] mirror and say but lord i want this
[1:18:48] thing so bad and the kingdom's going to
[1:18:50] cost me that and i'm having a trouble
[1:18:53] with my own human will but here's one
[1:18:55] thing i can say i want to want that
[1:18:58] kingdom so help me and have mercy on me
[1:19:01] and come down and change my heart oh god
[1:19:05] change my heart make me want to want
[1:19:08] that kingdom now how many would say amen
[1:19:10] to that say lord i want to want your
[1:19:13] kingdom more than all my other wants
[1:19:17] see
[1:19:18] it's not about
[1:19:20] living
[1:19:21] a flawless life if you could do that
[1:19:24] jesus wouldn't have needed to die
[1:19:26] and
[1:19:27] you know one of the things that i've
[1:19:29] learned as a pastor and i heard it
[1:19:31] coined some years ago and never forgot
[1:19:33] it a pastor was just at a minister's
[1:19:35] conference and made this statement
[1:19:37] said just remember pastors that you
[1:19:40] don't have to die for your church the
[1:19:42] jesus already did that
[1:19:44] see
[1:19:46] so so i'm not here to blow your nose for
[1:19:49] you or fix all your problems i'm here to
[1:19:52] i'm a gospel preacher and i'm here to
[1:19:54] preach the gospel to you and i'm here to
[1:19:56] try to live an example before you but
[1:19:58] we're all in this thing together and
[1:20:00] you're responsible to god the same as i
[1:20:02] am responsible to god
[1:20:04] see
[1:20:05] this is what makes
[1:20:07] the true
[1:20:09] church of god not just because they say
[1:20:11] they're the church of god
[1:20:13] kingdom principles are desired in your
[1:20:16] life
[1:20:17] principles of truthfulness
[1:20:21] truthfulness
[1:20:23] in marriage truthfulness
[1:20:25] in child raising truthfulness in
[1:20:27] business truthfulness in the community
[1:20:29] purity
[1:20:31] purity of desire
[1:20:33] this is the kingdom principle where
[1:20:35] you're striving daily to have your
[1:20:38] desires purified
[1:20:40] you have to because this flesh has its
[1:20:42] own nature and it's in a fallen
[1:20:44] condition and as soon as you listen you
[1:20:46] get on a treadmill that's moving
[1:20:49] stop walking you're going to backslide
[1:20:51] and it ain't going to be fun when you
[1:20:52] crash you understand you're on a moving
[1:20:54] sidewalk going backwards over the abyss
[1:20:56] that's what brother branham he saw that
[1:20:59] that church following a witch they went
[1:21:01] off the cliff i'm here to tell you the
[1:21:03] other that little group of girls went up
[1:21:05] that's the group i want to be in
[1:21:07] so you don't stop walking you don't stop
[1:21:09] he's even paul said running this race
[1:21:11] because the world is going backwards
[1:21:13] into insanity it's going backwards into
[1:21:16] total annihilation but this bride is
[1:21:19] leaving the world so don't stop running
[1:21:21] the race
[1:21:24] this is why people
[1:21:26] find themselves backslidden not because
[1:21:28] they went out and started committing
[1:21:30] heinous acts but because they just
[1:21:31] stopped going forward and after a while
[1:21:33] they were committing heinous acts
[1:21:37] this kingdom principles of truthfulness
[1:21:40] i'm only going to go so far today
[1:21:42] because i can't get anywhere near done
[1:21:45] so we're i'm just going to catch a few
[1:21:46] more
[1:21:49] so kingdom principles
[1:21:51] what it means to be the real church of
[1:21:54] god
[1:21:55] of truthfulness and purity of desire
[1:21:59] physical morality spiritual maturity
[1:22:05] that's
[1:22:06] that that's so needed in this day
[1:22:08] for balance
[1:22:11] if you don't have spiritual maturity if
[1:22:12] you don't if you don't take the steps to
[1:22:14] acquire spiritual maturity you know what
[1:22:16] you'll be like you'd be like paul said
[1:22:18] you'll be like a child who just gets
[1:22:20] tossed to and fro
[1:22:23] and every little every little wind will
[1:22:24] just knock you off path every little
[1:22:27] thing that happens to you that that
[1:22:28] don't go your way or little thing that
[1:22:30] you don't quite agree with and it'll
[1:22:31] still just throw you right off the trail
[1:22:33] like somebody hit you in the head with
[1:22:34] an axe
[1:22:36] and we're not supposed to be that way
[1:22:39] we're supposed to be seasoned veterans
[1:22:42] of faith strong in faith and strong in
[1:22:44] spirit we should have firm commitments
[1:22:47] uh you know uh immorality should not be
[1:22:50] named once among you as paul said
[1:22:52] marriages should be strong teenagers
[1:22:55] should be full of the holy ghost the
[1:22:56] power of god should be moving constantly
[1:22:59] in our midst not just here inside this
[1:23:01] building but in our homes in our jobs
[1:23:03] wherever we go friends i'm here to tell
[1:23:05] you that the world is designed to take
[1:23:08] all of that from you and the word is
[1:23:11] designed to give it back to you and to
[1:23:14] fortify it in you
[1:23:17] the the only decision to be made is
[1:23:19] yours because you already know god's
[1:23:23] you already know his desire for your
[1:23:26] life
[1:23:27] you don't need to pray lord help me he
[1:23:30] already has determined promised you he
[1:23:31] would you don't need to say lord uh make
[1:23:34] me an overcomer well
[1:23:35] you don't need to ask him to do that
[1:23:36] he's already told you that's what he's
[1:23:38] after he's chasing it harder than you're
[1:23:39] chasing it
[1:23:41] the only decision to be made is yours
[1:23:45] say i want to be saved i want to be i
[1:23:47] want to be born again well jesus already
[1:23:50] showed his decision in that at calvary
[1:23:53] he died to make a way for that the only
[1:23:55] choice to be made is yours
[1:23:57] see
[1:23:59] and that's where we so often times go
[1:24:02] off the path is in the choices that we
[1:24:04] make
[1:24:05] these kingdom principles should be or
[1:24:08] should operate in our homes
[1:24:11] and in our families
[1:24:14] they ought to operate in our marriages
[1:24:16] i've read you this list before i'm just
[1:24:17] rehearsing it again today
[1:24:19] these kingdom principles if we call
[1:24:21] ourselves the church of god then they
[1:24:24] should be made manifest in all of our
[1:24:26] lives in our homes our home life
[1:24:28] our family life and our family
[1:24:30] interaction kingdom principles should be
[1:24:32] predominant
[1:24:35] in our marriages
[1:24:37] and
[1:24:40] i mean
[1:24:41] think about
[1:24:43] just those two
[1:24:45] just just take
[1:24:47] holmes home life
[1:24:50] what is the nuclear family
[1:24:52] marriage raising kids just those real
[1:24:55] rubber meeting the road areas and just
[1:24:58] look how twisted and perverted the
[1:25:01] world's notion
[1:25:03] of what a marriage is what the nuclear
[1:25:06] family is
[1:25:07] what it means to be
[1:25:09] honest and
[1:25:10] and moral when
[1:25:12] when they are amoral
[1:25:14] when they when morality is relative to
[1:25:17] just whatever feels good
[1:25:19] and the whole world has
[1:25:21] in mass risen against and replies
[1:25:24] against god and there's only a small few
[1:25:27] little streaks of light running through
[1:25:28] darkness saying no no
[1:25:31] the blood has never lost its power
[1:25:34] and we're still standing on the
[1:25:35] principles of god's word and i'm still
[1:25:38] going to make sure that that god's word
[1:25:40] governs my home
[1:25:42] i'm going to make sure that god's word
[1:25:44] governs me my child raising it's going
[1:25:46] to govern my marriage it's going to
[1:25:48] govern how i treat my wife or how the
[1:25:50] wife treats the husband it's going to
[1:25:52] govern our friendships it's going to
[1:25:54] govern your friendships you're not going
[1:25:56] to have friends that poison your mind
[1:25:59] you're not going to have friends whose
[1:26:01] testimony and life fly in the face of
[1:26:05] god do you know that that's exactly what
[1:26:07] hezekiah got in trouble for amen
[1:26:11] hezekiah was a righteous king and you
[1:26:13] know what got him in hot water with god
[1:26:15] god simply said to hezekiah one day why
[1:26:18] is it that you're always making my
[1:26:21] enemies your friends amen
[1:26:24] amen
[1:26:25] people who
[1:26:27] live in open
[1:26:29] vulgar defiance of me and they're your
[1:26:32] friends
[1:26:35] say well i got a witness to them okay
[1:26:37] then witness to them
[1:26:39] tell them about the love of god start
[1:26:41] witnessing to them till they either
[1:26:42] become a christian or tell you to leave
[1:26:45] them alone
[1:26:46] and go away from them because i'm here
[1:26:48] to tell you something friends if you're
[1:26:49] if your ungodly friends are comfortable
[1:26:51] around you god's not comfortable around
[1:26:53] you
[1:26:55] if you're i mean i want to say it right
[1:26:57] if your worldly friends are comfortable
[1:26:59] around you god's not comfortable around
[1:27:02] you
[1:27:02] make your choice
[1:27:04] if the world is uncomfortable with you
[1:27:07] just know god is very comfortable with
[1:27:10] you
[1:27:11] jesus made that clear they will hate you
[1:27:14] because they hated me first
[1:27:16] and see where there needs to be kingdom
[1:27:18] principles in our friendships i'm all
[1:27:21] for witnessing but i don't it doesn't
[1:27:23] take me 10 years of friendship to
[1:27:24] witness to somebody amen
[1:27:27] it doesn't take me 10 days
[1:27:29] to be around a vulgar person before i'm
[1:27:31] telling them about the life of christ
[1:27:33] how that he can deliver them and change
[1:27:35] them and bring them into the fold of
[1:27:36] christ it doesn't it doesn't take me ten
[1:27:39] hours
[1:27:40] i'm not going to give 10 hours to a
[1:27:41] vulgar person without telling them about
[1:27:44] what christ can do or i'll just won't go
[1:27:45] around them anymore
[1:27:47] see
[1:27:47] so these kingdom principles should
[1:27:49] operate in our marriages in our
[1:27:51] friendships in our homes and our
[1:27:52] families and our education
[1:27:56] nothing wrong with education brother
[1:27:57] branham wasn't opposed to education
[1:27:59] people they say he was he wasn't
[1:28:02] he wasn't a post-education he was
[1:28:03] opposed to education the pursuit of
[1:28:05] education at the detriment of your
[1:28:07] pursuit of god
[1:28:09] amen
[1:28:10] that there's nothing education's fine
[1:28:11] but just remember education
[1:28:16] civilization is of the devil amen
[1:28:20] and the coming kingdom will have no
[1:28:22] it'll have education and it'll have
[1:28:24] civilization we're not going to be
[1:28:25] sitting on a cloud playing a harp it'll
[1:28:28] have plenty of education brother brandon
[1:28:31] said it'll be an education so far above
[1:28:32] this world they won't even begin to no
[1:28:34] nothing
[1:28:36] and it'll be civilization it's going to
[1:28:37] be life we're going to live we're good
[1:28:39] there's going to be kingdoms there's
[1:28:41] going to be there's going to be uh
[1:28:43] civilization
[1:28:44] in the millennium it's going to be right
[1:28:46] here on the earth even time will seek
[1:28:48] still keep going on but but god is
[1:28:51] preparing you here to live there
[1:28:55] because you're going to be priests and
[1:28:57] kings and so if you're going to live
[1:28:59] with authority and know-how and maturity
[1:29:02] and balance there you're going to have
[1:29:05] to learn how to do it here amen amen
[1:29:11] because there's no contrast for you
[1:29:12] there the and you don't learn without
[1:29:15] that contrast you learn you have a
[1:29:16] contrast here here's where your struggle
[1:29:18] is here's where you're an overcomer
[1:29:22] see
[1:29:25] so
[1:29:25] get all the education you want but don't
[1:29:28] let it
[1:29:29] interrupt your pursuit of god
[1:29:33] our finances should have kingdom order
[1:29:35] in it
[1:29:37] we should have honorable
[1:29:39] lifestyles
[1:29:40] there should be honorable lifestyles in
[1:29:42] our in our church leadership
[1:29:45] and our ministry teams and all the
[1:29:47] officers everybody that holds a position
[1:29:49] there should be godly seasoned maturity
[1:29:54] amen
[1:29:56] there there there should be a spirit of
[1:29:59] cooperation
[1:30:01] among all the officers of a church
[1:30:03] brother branham said if you if you break
[1:30:06] the harmony
[1:30:08] he said then it's like feeding poison to
[1:30:10] the church
[1:30:12] so the leadership with the ministry and
[1:30:15] they have to stay in harmony now does
[1:30:17] does harmony mean that that they always
[1:30:19] agree that everybody always agrees no it
[1:30:21] doesn't mean that at all and fact is uh
[1:30:24] conflict resolution is a is
[1:30:27] when you learn i mean conflict is good
[1:30:30] that's how you learn that's how you
[1:30:32] improve if you're if you never have
[1:30:34] brother branham taught us that that if
[1:30:36] you never had a trial you'd just be a
[1:30:38] dish rag
[1:30:40] if you never had something a hearty time
[1:30:42] and a hard thing to go through he said
[1:30:44] you'd just be well
[1:30:45] you know wishy-washy
[1:30:48] and so the whole point of it is is to
[1:30:50] struggle so that we can overcome so that
[1:30:53] we can all work in harmony together and
[1:30:56] when a decision is made and prayer has
[1:30:58] been offered and a decision is made at
[1:31:00] the head of the leadership of a church
[1:31:02] then the whole team whether it went
[1:31:04] their way or didn't go their way they're
[1:31:06] supposed to put their shoulder to the
[1:31:07] wheel with a smile on their face and a
[1:31:10] hand raised and say glory hallelujah i'm
[1:31:12] still building a wall i'm still building
[1:31:14] a wall i got a sword in my hand and i'm
[1:31:17] building a wall
[1:31:18] that's what it was in the days of
[1:31:20] nehemiah that's what happened in the
[1:31:22] restoration when when ezra and nehemiah
[1:31:25] went back
[1:31:28] there was harmony
[1:31:34] there should be brotherhood among the
[1:31:35] saints
[1:31:36] there should be kingdom principles in
[1:31:38] our brotherhood
[1:31:40] should be honesty and integrity
[1:31:43] i remember brother eugene told me one
[1:31:44] time he said brother jason you know what
[1:31:45] a real friend is
[1:31:47] and i said what is a cowboy he said
[1:31:49] a real friend is someone who will hold
[1:31:51] you accountable
[1:31:52] amen
[1:31:54] and won't just tell you what you want to
[1:31:55] hear but tell you what you need to hear
[1:31:58] doesn't mean their friends are always
[1:32:00] right
[1:32:01] but it does mean their hearts in the
[1:32:03] right spot see
[1:32:05] our witness in the community there
[1:32:07] should be a kingdom principle
[1:32:10] and our witness
[1:32:11] in the community
[1:32:12] your life should demonstrate
[1:32:16] christ
[1:32:17] your everyday walking around talking
[1:32:21] thinking doing life
[1:32:24] should
[1:32:24] reflect the presence and power of christ
[1:32:30] that shows that you are of a different
[1:32:33] kingdom
[1:32:36] there should be kingdom order to all of
[1:32:38] this
[1:32:39] every
[1:32:40] facet
[1:32:42] of our lives
[1:32:44] and i want to tell you something friends
[1:32:47] these are the things i'll say this in
[1:32:49] closing
[1:32:51] for today we're going to hit a pause
[1:32:52] button
[1:32:54] these are the very things that satan
[1:32:57] purposes
[1:32:58] to rob you of
[1:33:01] you leave here today
[1:33:03] knowing that's one of the last things i
[1:33:05] said to you
[1:33:07] that satan has a playbook
[1:33:09] with your name on it
[1:33:11] he's studied you
[1:33:13] he's watched you he knows where your
[1:33:16] chinks and your armor are he knows where
[1:33:18] your weak spots are and we all got him
[1:33:20] brother branham said what i do about my
[1:33:22] weak spot brother i said that's where
[1:33:24] you double up your armor
[1:33:26] make thicker armor right there do
[1:33:28] whatever is necessary to get to to
[1:33:30] shield that weakness from the enemy
[1:33:32] exploiting it see
[1:33:35] and
[1:33:37] these kingdom principles and the kingdom
[1:33:40] living in our lives and testifying of
[1:33:42] christ to a world that to be that little
[1:33:44] streak of light moving through darkness
[1:33:49] just understand
[1:33:50] that this satan wakes up every day and
[1:33:54] goes to bed every night thinking how he
[1:33:56] can knock you off of that
[1:33:58] amen
[1:34:01] you know it's i heard i heard a brother
[1:34:04] david samuel this morning using an
[1:34:06] example that was so beautiful
[1:34:09] he starts talking about how that you get
[1:34:11] on a train and you're going to go
[1:34:12] somewhere
[1:34:13] and you've got all these brochures and
[1:34:15] looking at all these pictures and
[1:34:17] all of this marketing
[1:34:19] and man that's going to be so wonderful
[1:34:21] when i get there it's going to be it's
[1:34:22] going to be like a millennium
[1:34:24] and he said and that's what we've all
[1:34:26] done remember brother branham used that
[1:34:27] same analogy said you're standing in he
[1:34:29] said flashing red light of his coming
[1:34:31] remember that
[1:34:32] and he said you you're standing there
[1:34:34] waiting on the train and he said you
[1:34:35] know you might walk around and you might
[1:34:38] get you some peanuts and somebody over
[1:34:39] here reading a newspaper and you're
[1:34:41] waiting on that train he said but
[1:34:42] suddenly
[1:34:43] he said you hear ding ding ding ding
[1:34:45] ding ding ding ding ding and lights
[1:34:47] start flashing he said that train's in
[1:34:48] the blocks he said i'm going to tell you
[1:34:50] what you better throw down them peanuts
[1:34:52] you better get that newspaper put away
[1:34:54] you better grab your stuff because that
[1:34:56] train's only stopping briefly it's going
[1:34:58] to roll in stop all aboard here we go
[1:35:01] and you're not going to have time if
[1:35:03] you're running late you're stuck in
[1:35:04] traffic because you didn't leave early
[1:35:06] enough and the train's going to leave
[1:35:07] without you
[1:35:09] you understand so so it's it's about
[1:35:11] it's about persistence and sensibility
[1:35:14] it's about it's about being studious in
[1:35:16] our lives it's about it's about kingdom
[1:35:19] principles
[1:35:21] and and brother david said you know it's
[1:35:22] like you get on that train to head to
[1:35:24] this destination
[1:35:26] now your destination might be
[1:35:29] who can say we we probably are on all
[1:35:31] kinds of trains destined maybe maybe you
[1:35:34] want more purity maybe you want you know
[1:35:37] maybe you want more a better job maybe
[1:35:39] you want this maybe you're asking god
[1:35:40] maybe it's a different church maybe it's
[1:35:42] a maybe it's a spouse maybe maybe it's
[1:35:45] you know you're lonely and you where's
[1:35:46] my where's my divine mate lord
[1:35:49] and brother david said you know you've
[1:35:50] got to brochure the promises of god
[1:35:53] there this is like a brochure for heaven
[1:35:55] and all these promises man look at these
[1:35:58] descriptions wow
[1:36:01] i'm getting on this train
[1:36:03] and he said so many people
[1:36:06] fail to get to their destination just
[1:36:08] for a lack of patience
[1:36:11] they just get impatient in life and they
[1:36:13] just get off the train
[1:36:15] maybe they get off at the second or
[1:36:16] third stop and they never he said when
[1:36:18] you do that
[1:36:21] you're just left with the brochure
[1:36:23] that's all you've got
[1:36:26] this is never nothing more than just a
[1:36:27] brochure to you

[1:37:43] i thank you for your anointing to go
[1:37:45] through it in the way that i was able to
[1:37:47] lord i purposed in my heart
[1:37:50] to
[1:37:51] to just work my way through it
[1:37:53] methodically
[1:37:54] to not jump too quickly over any single
[1:37:57] point
[1:37:58] [Music]
[1:38:00] to bring the people the whole word of
[1:38:02] god
[1:38:03] for the whole man by a complete god
[1:38:06] because you're looking to make completed
[1:38:08] individuals lord in this kingdom
[1:38:11] you're looking for it in the homes
[1:38:13] and the families you're looking for
[1:38:16] husbands to step up
[1:38:18] you're looking for wives to
[1:38:20] step into their place
[1:38:22] you're looking for ministry to be more
[1:38:24] faithful you're looking for teenagers to
[1:38:27] be
[1:38:28] courageous you're looking for your
[1:38:30] family to make a difference in the world
[1:38:34] to live in a different way
[1:38:36] to not be ashamed of the gospel of jesus
[1:38:39] christ to get out of their own way lord
[1:38:42] if
[1:38:42] if i i have found that the easiest way
[1:38:49] to get out of my own way
[1:38:51] is to make sure i'm looking in two
[1:38:53] mirrors
[1:38:56] there's few things more frustrating to
[1:38:58] me than when i can't get out of my own
[1:38:59] way
[1:39:00] i can't blame you and i can't blame old
[1:39:02] slew foot
[1:39:04] i just have to say it's me oh lord it's
[1:39:06] not my brother no actually it's not my
[1:39:09] brother that's causing me my problems
[1:39:11] not my sister
[1:39:12] causing me my problems it's not my wife
[1:39:15] it's not my husband
[1:39:16] it's not the preacher it's not the
[1:39:19] deacons
[1:39:20] it's me oh lord
[1:39:23] the best way to get out of your own way
[1:39:25] finally at last
[1:39:28] is to just make sure you stand and look
[1:39:29] in both mirrors
[1:39:32] father i'm praying for your mercy on
[1:39:34] this all
[1:39:35] congregation today
[1:39:38] i'm believing that your word lord will
[1:39:40] have its penetrating effect and
[1:39:43] as i think over in my heart
[1:39:46] what's been said and how it was said and
[1:39:49] the point where i stopped i feel
[1:39:52] lord uh
[1:39:53] satisfaction in the holy spirit
[1:39:57] as far as i know lord as far as i would
[1:39:59] know

[1:52:12] i was on the phone to brother bruce

[1:52:18] said oh it's wonderful it's a beautiful
[1:52:20] day i said it's pretty cold it's down to
[1:52:22] 50 and he just busted out laughing i
[1:52:24] said oh it's down to 50s and i said yeah
[1:52:26] and then it dawned on me i'm speaking to
[1:52:27] a yankee
[1:52:28] so he was real cold
[1:52:31] but amen we're we we we love the lord
[1:52:34] and we're i'm glad for this facility i'm
[1:52:37] glad that this makes it easy
[1:52:39] this is a momentous moment for you
[1:52:41] brother rome amen you know it god
[1:52:45] follows us our whole life but
[1:52:47] but eventually time intersects with
[1:52:49] prophecy
[1:52:51] and what's happening to you today
[1:52:53] is that
[1:52:54] today now you've already had
[1:52:57] you know we met here in the back office
[1:52:59] and you committed your whole heart to
[1:53:00] the lord forever ask the lord to live
[1:53:03] inside you
[1:53:04] and you wanted to come today to receive
[1:53:06] his name publicly in front of all these
[1:53:08] people
[1:53:09] and what what's happening is is today
[1:53:14] with all the other days combined but
[1:53:16] today god is bringing you a little
[1:53:18] closer
[1:53:19] to the image he saw of you before the
[1:53:21] foundation of the world
[1:53:22] now you just believe that he has an
[1:53:24] image before the before there was
[1:53:26] stardust he has an image of you
[1:53:29] and today he's bringing you a little
[1:53:31] closer to that image amen praiseworth
[1:53:34] the rapture if the rapture happens today
[1:53:36] you're going to look pretty much same
[1:53:37] you're only 19 so i'll look a lot
[1:53:39] different but
[1:53:41] but uh amen praise the lord have a seat
[1:53:44] here brother right here no and what
[1:53:45] we're going to now you sit right near
[1:53:46] the edge because i don't want to crack
[1:53:47] your head going back
[1:53:49] amen
[1:53:50] yeah you are and uh but hey i i baptized
[1:53:53] gideon he's taller than you so
[1:53:56] but um
[1:53:58] this is true christian baptism see the
[1:54:00] world got that wrong
[1:54:02] the the early church used to baptize
[1:54:04] exactly how we're about to do it they
[1:54:05] put people under the water because
[1:54:07] that's the symbolism of death jesus was
[1:54:10] buried he went down and he rose up so we
[1:54:14] put people down in symbolism of death
[1:54:16] and raised them in symbolism of life
[1:54:18] see
[1:54:19] and so we do it in the name of the lord
[1:54:22] jesus christ and the only reason we do
[1:54:24] it that way is because that's how the
[1:54:25] disciples did it
[1:54:27] right we're not we don't try to be
[1:54:29] harsh to the rest of the world who do it
[1:54:31] in other ways we just simply say for us
[1:54:33] we'd rather do it the way the disciples
[1:54:34] did it and so if people want to follow
[1:54:37] man-made tradition that's just on them
[1:54:39] they'll just have to answer to god but
[1:54:40] god has revealed to you
[1:54:42] that there is no name under heaven there
[1:54:45] is no other name
[1:54:47] given among men under heaven given among
[1:54:49] men whereby
[1:54:51] we must be saved other than the name of
[1:54:53] the lord jesus christ so that's why we
[1:54:55] baptize the bible says whatsoever you do
[1:54:58] in word or deed
[1:55:01] do all in the name of the lord jesus
[1:55:03] christ
[1:55:04] amen amen and when peter baptized him he
[1:55:08] said repent and be baptized in the name
[1:55:10] of the lord jesus christ and everybody
[1:55:13] that was ever baptized was baptized in
[1:55:15] the name of the lord every one of them
[1:55:17] and that's why we're doing it today now
[1:55:19] this is a promise ron see um this is a
[1:55:22] promise that
[1:55:24] you are meeting this is what baptism is
[1:55:26] is after repentance
[1:55:28] this is your first act of obedience
[1:55:30] you're coming to the water you're saying
[1:55:32] to the lord i'm starting here and i'm
[1:55:34] going to go the rest of my life obeying
[1:55:36] you
[1:55:37] you get that all right let's pray
[1:55:40] father we thank you for our brother

[1:55:53] witnessed she was a faithful witness of
