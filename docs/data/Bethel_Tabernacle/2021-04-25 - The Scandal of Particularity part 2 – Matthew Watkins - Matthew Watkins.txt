========================================

[Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] do [Music] do hebrews chapter 11. if you have your bible we'll turn there and just read a portion of scripture we spoke last two sundays ago on the scandal of particularity we'd like to discontinue that here this morning now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony it's a testimony i'd like to have that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must and here's what's important must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him by faith noah and we'll just move on past that to verse 8 by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles means tense with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations whose builder and maker is god you can be seated this morning we're going to detour just a little bit into the subject of faith because i believe that we couldn't cover abraham isaac and jacob without covering that topic and we we've seen a lot two weekends ago um how important it was let me just pull up my my notes here we spoke on the two threads and i'll just i'll just cover skim over some of this of what we spoke on last last time we spoke on this that you'll find throughout the bible this reference to the god of abraham isaac and jacob and we know paul in the new testament just connects the dots for us when he said that if you are christ's then you're abraham's seed and so he connects ireland our line of faith with the line that he started through with redemption through abraham that's why we say that we're children of the promise children of abraham but you'll find that there's these two threads that run throughout all of the old testament and one thread is that god is that the god of the jews the god who the jews claim or proclaim is the god of the universe that's very clear from the bible that the jews aren't disclaiming a god but they're claiming the god the god of gods the king of kings the lord of lords and and we understood that every nation in those days had their own religion they had their own god a lot of the wars as we said that were fought were religious wars or religiously motivated the god of baal the god of asteroid god of moloch and so israel's god was jehovah and he was he was the god of israel and israel claimed that he was a god of all gods but so that's one thread that we see that runs through the book uh through the old testament books all the way through the new testament is that the god that israel claimed that they served was the god of all gods he was the god who created the worlds the other thread that you'll see running through the bible is not israel claiming that their god is the god of gods but the other side or let me rephrase that one thread as we said last sunday one thread is that you'll find that the god of the jews is the god of the whole universe the other thread the other side of that is that the god of the universe is the god of the jews in other words it wasn't just the jews claiming that this is our god but we actually have jehovah himself claiming i am their god so it's really important to understand that it's one thing for a claim to be made it's another thing for god to back up what they said and god identifies himself with this one little bitty tiny group this little family this little small portion of all of the sea of humanity god identifies himself as the god of abraham amen and so it was it was this one little group that that god of universe had became the god who created the stars and the galaxies and the worlds was now calling himself identify him identify himself as the god of abraham and so the god the the let me let me just move through some of this so we don't spend too much time on on uh on review but it's a really incredible it's a really incredible claim as we said and and we see this all of the book of genesis as we said last sunday chapters one through chapter 11 is a very short section but it covers uh a lot of time a great space of time centuries and many peoples and many nations and then you come to chapter 12 and god zooms in the picture it's no more covering chapter 12 through chapter 50 is not going to cover a massive amount of time as 1-11 did in a short space of time but it's going to just sort of slow down and history and time is going to come to a slow pace and it's going to cover the lives of just four men abraham isaac and jacob and joseph of course and it zooms in very deliberately as we said it's a very deliberate zooming in from the rest of the world from the rest of all the peoples and all the nations and all the all the rest of the entire uh all the rest of the sea of humanity and it zooms in just to one family it's very important to understand this because in our modern era it is what we we absolutely understand that this is what god did man didn't make this choice god made that choice to select one family one people through whom redemption would come through that one family amen and he would send a jew a jewish man to save the rest of the world it would send a it wasn't a as we said uh the chinese would have a chinese savior and then the americans would have an american savior and the russians would have a russian savior and the jews would have a jewish savior but god chose one man one family and through that one family he would save the rest of the world amen that's why scholars call it the scandal of particularity that god chose one family one man named abraham to begin his program through and that's why it's called a scandal the basis is why would god choose one family just why not everybody why just one little special group of who god says you're my peculiar treasure peculiar treasure amen and god attaches himself in a very intimate special way and nowadays if you were to try to say that god has a special attachment or special love to just one group of people his bride it's a scandal it's it's it just doesn't make sense to the modern world today yet those same the same uh church the same christian scholars who look at the the way that god looked at one family yet those same ones it's it's god loves god there there is no uniqueness there's no election for one group of people yet we understand the god of the old testament became the god of the new testament amen amen and he's not different he's the sa he's a he's he's the same god the people are you most most uh modern christians today are embarrassed of the god of the old testament because we have this as we said we have this uh this humanistic thinking of a god that we can't relate to you know if god is it's the same exact question that's been asked that it's been preached for years and years and years that god is all loving that he loves everybody and god the bible does say for god so love the world but god isn't just love god also hates and in fact the only way he can have love is that he has hatred and the bible speaks of a god who hates and and he's a god of justice he's also a god of mercy he's a god of grace he's a god of love god of forgiveness but he's also a god of judgment amen and it's it's it's a message of and i'll just take a minute just to say this it's a message of love and i know we've covered this in months past but i'll just cover just a portion of this here this morning it's a message of love of love love love that god's all about love and he loves you and he he accepts you and you just love god and all that's required of you is just to love god with all your heart and god loves you and god wants the best for you and god never would do anything to harm or hurt and it's a message of of what they call what has been i should say has been misinterpreted as the good news the gospel the gospel message the good news is that god loves you and the message that we've given to the world the world in masses is that message that one tone one dimensional message of love god loves we'll wait the christian preachers let me just say this that message has been preached and it's rolled over nations it's rolled over the world amen and i'll just ask let's look at our world and ask what has been the result of that sermon amen what is what is it what has it produced in the church the modern church if we had some pictures i'd throw them up on the screen of what the modern church is brother branham seen that modern church and said what a disgrace and then he begins to say after all of the effort after all of the preaching after all of the going from coast to coast c to c and he says and this is the best we can produce half dressed uh rock dancing to the not just half dress that wasn't half dress they were nude completely with just a little gray piece of paper he said covering themselves and he said they were dancing they were marching to the time of rock and roll music so then it's a very simple i think a very fair question has the message that god has loved and god loves everybody been a successful one no it hasn't because any time you you look only at one side of things and not the full picture you're getting a very it's like we've said before carrots are good for you right children yeah carrots are good for you but if you only eat carrots that diet is a bad diet for you so a one-sided gospel produces and it's not just that it's one-sided it's it's one-sided and it's hybridized it's hybrid with men's thinking and so we look at the world and the the message of love what's what has been the results what's been the results in church i'm not talking about the world i'm not talking about the bar room last night i'm talking about your local every day on the corner church evangelical church baptist church no matter what you want to put in that pot what i see is emotion a lot of emotion amen a lot of emotionalism a lot of i'll go a little bit further than that a lot of sensuality because there's a lot of sensuality in modern christianity a lot of it all you got to do is turn on your local local radio station [Music] it's chalked full of sensuality amen and emotion you say brother matt are you preaching against emotion no not at all i'm just surveying what i see of what the what the fruits of only preaching this message of god of love the god who loves has produced it's produced a lot of sensuality it's polluted it's produced a lot of emotion and when we look at in the word and find out what god is really like we find it differs a lot of times greatly from what the church has defined as the gospel as the message and so let me just zero in on my thought here it's led to is what we've said it's led to an emotional understanding of god a connection where we when we say god loves then we connect that with something that we understand because we as human beings we love we love each other we love our children we love our family we love our friends and so when we say god loves we connect the dots immediately but the problem is is that there's a difference between human love and godly love and when you talk about godly love that's where the disconnect happens how could a loving god in other words how could a god who is love like i love allow evil to happen in the world how could a god like that you see because it's a it's a sensual understanding it's a emotional understanding and what it's done when you give someone an emotional understanding of god and that becomes their the way that they relate then it causes people to construct an image of god in their imagination that's not always according to the bible amen and then when bible preaching or teaching is done there's a log jam because there's a disconnect between that image that i've created of who i thought god was and what his word actually says that he is amen amen and so you say brother matt what does that mean that means we we ought to stick to bible teaching and not not imagination and not opinion of what we think or how we relate to god it causes us to construct an image god is so loving he would never cause pain suffering he wouldn't you know god would ever hurt anybody never heard a fly that god loves us so much he's just there to speaking of the imaginational image he's there to protect us from every bit of pain and every bit of suffering and just to provide for all of our needs some of the songs that we sing in this church that's produced and i'm not i sing them not criticizing them at all but some of them if you really break down the substance of the message it's really just that the substance is that god just loves you he wants you he wants you and he he'll he'll keep you he'll protect you you compare that with some of the old hymns and there was that but there was also a gospel message in those lyrics that spoke about the blood that spoke about repentance that spoke about holiness are you all here today and so it's it's a it's in in essence it's really just he's just there to make you happy because everybody everything in the world is just about happiness just everyone's seeking it's the you know you're an alienable right to uh to uh you know seek out peace and and and and and it's all just about to be to to produce happiness in the world and in order to be happy you need two things in life you need health and you need wealth so in short god has became there has became an image just to save you from disease and poverty and you know a lot of people have bought that god a lot of people have accepted and masses and millions will come to an altar to say hey i'm sign me up let me make a commitment right now i'll make a confession i'll put my name on a book right now if that's what god is sign me up right now and this is the concept that of god that is largely in the minds of the world that's why that same concept when you when you when you teach on election that god elected you by foreknowledge that god had one family who would bring redemption through for the rest of the entire world and people say hold on oh that's that's you know that's bias that's not right that's that's that's favoritism that you know that doesn't make any sense god surely the god of all heaven wouldn't do that surely you mean that god has one elected family and one group of people not a group necessarily but a collection of individuals who are identified as his elected seed as his bride and god esteems them at a certain place like a man would esteem a wife i don't know about that preacher i wouldn't i don't know you know i i think that sounds a little bit it sounds a little bit um you know bias if god doesn't keep suffering away you know and and that's the problem is that the bible picture of god is not a god a loving god who loves everybody regardless of who they are or what they do and so whenever something happens in life that that contradicts that image you know you know why it's so wrong to have an image because what is an idol an idol is just an image and so people have literally made god an idol an object of worship but it's a god it's a they're worshiping a god of their imagination all the while thinking they're a christian and they believe and they're a believer when really their entire their entire uh attachment to god you take and i'll just give this one example you take the a man um uh charles templeton was and we've we've said this before billy graham's best friend grew up with him preached with him in tent meetings for years they preached tent revivals together and he was a according to billy graham a much more eloquent speaker than he was powerful gifted man of god and and if you if you study that charles templeton's life he goes billy and him with uh some friends went into a theater that was playing a a documentary what was taking place in germany and and it was the what we know as the holocaust and billy graham says he says charles walked in that theater a a bible preaching gospel singing preacher and he walked out of that theater an atheist and he turned his back on billy turned his back on god and you say what happened how could how could you know how could a loving god how could he he couldn't reconcile this image of who he had imagined god was he couldn't reconcile it with the images that was coming up on the screen and his as paul said his faith was shipwrecked amen and you say what happened to men like it's because they began they started out with a understanding a wrong understanding of you a wrong view of god and oftentimes as we said we need the the real image because god has a real image and it's not in our imagination it's right in his word amen amen because the the bible is the interpretation of who god is not what i say or what you say or what i what i uh imagine god is who god really is as we said that's what the bible calls idolatry because an idol is an idea of god that you can make yourself whether you make it of wood or stone or just in your mind that's the kind of god i like that's the kind of god i would serve but who is really god there's some facts some amazing facts and i'll just we'll just close here in just a minute out of 35 000 verses that are in the bible less than 30 talk about love that's under 0.1 percent there are whole books in the bible but the majority of the books the majority of a lot of those books never mention the love of god so you just brother matt very simple question if the bible didn't doesn't emphasize it is it not there no it's absolutely there but when it becomes the key and figure and sinner post and typos and they major on it why are we majoring on something that's not the it's not the overall image or the message of the bible how many times do you think that the love of god is mentioned in the book of acts now before you answer that let me give you some facts acts some facts about acts acts has 28 chapters right average book in the bible has they say 18. acts chronicles the spread of the early church over 30 years from the final words of jesus and his ascension into heaven all the way through a pot the apostle paul's uh imprisonment near the end of his life that's what the book of acts covers it has 13 different times it presents the gospel message 13 times to different people different different kinds of people different places different crowds jews gentiles regular people to high ranking government people 13 different times it presents the gospel so now you know that how many times is the word love mentioned in acts the answer zero zero do a word search in your bible software it's okay because when i first heard that i thought that's impossible there's no way no it's not possible so the bible as we as we said the only time believers talk about the love of god really when you read about them speaking they're speaking to other believers in other words the message that they give to the world is not just a god who loves and he just accepts you and just come as you are that's not the message that produces conviction but the gospel message was repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the lord jesus christ and the sermon that paul that peter preaches the bible says they were pricked in their hearts they were stabbed in the heart and said men and brethren what must we do to be saved so it produces a a conviction and i believe that's the way the lord is wanting to speak today i i we read the very beginning there hebrews chapter 11. listen to what brother branham says i'm just going to read this and then we'll close i don't really have time to cover this because we we look at three men let me just make this last comment then i'll have you stand i would run into the time of the song leader but i'm the song leader today so we'll stop on time just kidding but you look at these three men abraham isaac and jacob and you say why why would god choose this family these men now you can ask a very fair question you could say why these men because you know what's amazing about abraham isaac and jacob you see three men and really in the stories that genesis tells us there's not really a i mean you have the abra the miracle of sarah but and abraham but it's not uh it's not the stories of of mighty men with miraculous works in their life right i could read you the stories about samson and man it's just a story filled with supernatural strength read the story about daniel and his entire life and the miraculous the miracles that take place in some of these men's life but the family that god chooses and the three characters that he's focuses it on it's really not a big powerful miraculous life in fact it's a life of a lot of mistakes all three men were liars that's how they were connected all three of them lied abraham about his wife isaac jacob what a shyster as brother adam calls him you wouldn't want jacob as your as a as a family member let me just put it that way you better be watching your wallet you see these three men you could ask why would god choose this these men these guys abraham isaac jacob men men full of mistakes and trouble not necessarily what we'd even call good men amen but you know you say brother matt then what was it about these three men that separated them that something about them that god seen i'm going to give you one word because it's what they possessed and it wasn't the characteristic of good habits or good behavior it was faith amen because in these three men they all had faith amen they weren't good men but they were believing men and god can actually do a lot more through a believing man than he could through a good man who doesn't believe because there's a lot of good people in the world who don't believe that's right so god says i'm going to choose i'm going to use not necessarily what you might would esteem as a good person but a person who has a quality called faith amen brother madam says what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it that it will be faith is a revelation of the will of god by revelation we're out of time let's all stand to our feet thank you lord jesus for this morning sunday's teaching lord we just ask lord for your words that were spoken lord may it just sow a seed down inside of our soul today may we feed upon it lord in this service today we ask for you to take control complete control lord may you have the preeminence in all things in jesus name amen amen [Music] you
