Christian amen amen amen praise the lord well I want to welcome sister Sarah and all her bears and Cubs and one princess I think Paige honey how do you survive in all that gang of boys amen amen we're happy to have her here amen amen and we'll see if Kevin can get that smile off his face but I doubt it amen praise God we're going to invites you right to Genesis CH 12 this evening greet in the name of the Lord and we're looking forward to what God has here for us I want to just while you're turning um just kind of comment um just kind of uh just to kind of give you a little bit of an inside inside information you know on the decision we had to make Sunday to cancel the service and you know I we have to do that from time to time you live along the ocean storm can come in from any direction you know they can come in off the ocean they can come up out of the Gulf of Mexico this one happened to come from west to east amen so thanks a lot California or wherever it came from but uh you know those decisions are just never easy because we like being at church I like coming to church I don't like not coming to church amen and so um but you know um I would just say you know that just appreciate the the anguish that the that the team of officers that I always confer with to make a decision like that I never make that decision arbitrarily it's ultimately my responsibility to make the call but I but I always involve the team of officers um and we deliberate we'll go back and forth and sometimes we'll spend all day talking about it watching the patterns and uh sometimes we go I think we'll be fine and um but you know when you're under a direct uh warning from the authorities and um I mean there's there's really no decision to make that you can't I would never gather people under a direct warning of imminent danger in nature nature can can turn very violent very quickly Amen brother Bram talked about that you know the oncoming storm and how that that one man with his family responsible for his family did not take uh precautions and and and live up to the responsibility that he should have and of course the sermon was about way more than that because then brother brandham turned the tables everybody agreed with that they go yeah that's what everybody should do and he said okay well you've got a a responsibility there's an oncoming storm what are you doing about it to prepare and so um so that was a a nice segue that the prophet used there pretty crafty and uh preachers are impressed with stuff like that amen so I just wanted to make that kind of comment to you uh Sunday and and you say well but nothing happened praise the Lord don't ever look at that like wow we could have came to church well I'm not a prophet the Lord didn't come to me and go listen if you ask me to turn this storm away I will I mean I believe he will but nobody Gabel didn't come to me you know Sunday morning I would have loved that I could have I could have said hey everybody don't worry I had a visitation this morning we're going to be just fine I'm not a neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet prophet and so Angels don't tend to tell me things like that and so uh we just have to go with the best available information that we have and uh sometimes you know I'm it's not only the officers but we have members of law enforcement brother Kevin has always been over the years very fateful to give us the latest cutting uh Edge technology that the county is receiving from the state and from the feds and so those kind of things but hey like I say so for those of people who might have been streaming looking for us this is a coastal city amen we love our little Seaside town but sometimes uh the weather can turn on us and we just can't take a chance the Lord has always protected us 30 years running since I've been here and even our testimonies even before that um brother Charles that's right brother Charles remembers when Hurricane David come through here I think it was in the 77 or 78 someone run in there brother Charles if I'm not mistaken and uh the brother John Keith told me one time he said that uh they were pray in because it the storm was named David they were praying for the sure mercies of David and and so that storm which was going to Bullseye Buford right as it came right as it came it inexplicably lifted High into the atmosphere went over the city came down in behind it and carried on and the newspaper the next morning in Buford was missing hurricane so you know we've had stuff like that happen before where where you know the Lord has protected our houses and we've had neighbors get flooded and our houses be high and dry we've had houses Torn to Pieces all around us and Believers homes we we set some pictures of it one time when a hurricane came through and trees knocked down and the city flooded and all the Believers have always been okay amen I think the worst we've ever had was uh brother George and sister Andrew when they first moved here they were renting a house over in Hilton Head and a limb broke and went and punched a hole through their garage now he say oh that wasn't nothing well brother Josh was laying right under it so we're happy that he didn't get harpooned by that limb but uh you know what so the the the brothers went and and we grabbed some chainsaws and ladders and tarps and and I think I was probably crazy enough to lead the charge and I went up the ladder and somebody took a picture we got got him with a chainsaw in my hand I don't do that for a living so and we were cutting that away and we tarped it all up into you know that the homeowner she gave us a missionary offering for fixing that roof until the roofers could get there I think we got like a $1,200 missionary offering so to God be all the glory amen we just love him for it he's always kept us safe and protected us amen praise God Genesis chapter 12 I just wanted to kind of say that and um let you know what's always behind that we thank the Lord that he spared us again and uh but there were I believe the last report I heard there was 56 deaths from no was 56 uh track tracked tornadoes that CA as that storm was coming across 56 verified tornadoes some of them I think one hit Arkansas was an uh an EF5 is that what they call that and um and so there there were there were uh probably multiple dozens of people that lost their lives and so we thank the Lord for his Mercy for us and sometimes we just have to we just just always know we don't we try to not cancel but we have to be prudent I I would never be able to live with myself if I you know acted in bravado instead of wisdom oh we'll be fine and then something terrible happen we're supposed God gives us wisdom to use amen so praise the Lord but we all stayed Christians we all stayed Believers I'm still a believer amen turn around and look and say I'm still a Believer yeah amen okay well the devil lost then completely so na na na na na all right Genesis chapter 12 I want to continue um and I'm not going to try to preach a Sunday sermon on a Wednesday so don't worry but I I want to take a a fold of what I was going to bring last Sunday and then the Lord willing we'll carry on with it uh in service is to come the Lord willing Genesis 12 so this is our part in The Inheritance part two Genesis 12 and we're going to catch the first three verses now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed let's pray father we thank you for your written word now Lord tonight we ask that the Holy Spirit Come and Let it become a Living Word to us give us hearing hearts Lord give us understanding of of everything that you want us to know this evening we commit ourselves into your hands Lord I um have enjoyed Lord studying this thought and been looking at it since early early early before daylight and it just seemed that you focused my attention on a specific um area Lord so I feel very very task specifically driven tonight so I want to get to it and father and then we will we'll take up prayer request and appeal to you for our needs now we commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated want to be praying for some families out of town tonight and um um trusting that the Lord will keep all things under his perfect care we know that he will because that's that's what he does amen amen um one of the things if I don't forget it I really want to uh not forget it but I I just now REM I remembered so I'm going to remember not to forget I remember that I didn't add it to my prayer list and so uh again anybody that has prayer requests make sure you get them to me directly and via VIA message or or or Whatsapp whatever and um and we'll get that but I I wanted to have a prayer request because there's a preliminary chance and it's not it's not etched in stone yet but there's a very probable chance that we'll be able to get brother Abraham here with us this year and so I was sure love that we haven't got to see brother Abraham in a while and uh he is a friend extraordinaire and what a wonderful brother and we've grown to love him here uh at bethl Tabernacle amen praise the Lord and uh he brother brother Abraham and I we always debate and argue over who gets the greatest blessing him I get it when he comes here or he gets it when I go there and I I say well brother Abraham it's going to be the one thing doctrinally we're going to disagree on forever and uh we'll just we'll just have to agree to disagree amen but like brother Harold Becket says we're we're U we're brothers of a different mother but we have the same father amen praise the Lord Genesis chap 12 that we read and um we know that in the scripture and I just want to make this statement as I as I wait in because I I kind of want to set your mind for this in case you're wondering why I keep I don't want to Waffle back and forth in in Genesis 12 you find him being called Abram and then you're going to continue to read that for a while until he gets a name change and the name is changed to Abraham and so we were showing you last time that God adds an H which and H in the Hebrew stands for deity now he not only added it to Abram and it became Abraham but he also added an H to his wife which was Sarai and then it becomes Sarah and so we we realize then that that that that's how God does it because U name changes in the Bible uh represent a an advancement to the next stage of some development of God's word the next stage of character the next level of something God is doing God himself operates that way that's why we've said to you before and the Bible tells us that he he values his word above his name and that seems in in Congress almost like how what does that even mean and uh but you realize that God's name has has changed not that he ever stopped being what he had been but as he evolves in his under in in the understanding in his unfolding then we know that when he uh was that all great self-existing spirit as Elohim uh we know that that was a name we would refer to him as as the self-existing one before there were even angels to worship him before anything even worshiped him before he would qualify for the English term God which is object of worship he was that great Fountain of Divine Life and so now he wasn't the wind he he was a he was a being and so uh we we realized that that we we love to keep all of that straight so that we don't get thinking in into esoteric philosophy and things like that of what God is oh he's just some Essence he's not just an Essence he's a real person and the devil's a real person and if the Tree of Life In the Garden of Eden was Christ well then the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is certainly symbolic of Satan and so of course we can easily see that the tree of n the tree of life was symbolic of Jesus Christ uh it's the it's the the symbol Moses used to refer to Christ and so I don't want to get too much into the into the trenches of that tonight but I I'm trying to let you know I'm going to go forward just saying Abraham unless I slip and use Abram but I'm going to just refer to Abraham and I'm not getting my timeline out of sequence I'm I really what I'm doing is that um you know because that it's going to reflect can I say it like this Abraham was going to reflect the truer identity of Abram amen that had been in God's mind since before time you understand so so God saw this man before he was ever a man on the earth and so what when God changed it to Abraham and adding deity to his name uh because that that because it's going to bring forth a Christ line a Christ seed and again that's for the weekend I'm not going to go much down that trail at all tonight or else I would we'd be here a while but but we find that that it it was an identity Abraham was an identity advancement just like God went from Elohim and then he he later becomes uh Jehovah and and and and he even says to Moses and he looks back and he says now Moses back in Abraham's day I wasn't known as Jehovah right but then you realize that Abraham you know called the place Jehovah Gyra and and there's Jehovah Shalom and there's Jehovah sit Cano and there's Jehovah sha and so so we see all of these identifications but you realize that that when when the name Jehovah one of its meanings is God dwelling with his family so was he Jehovah when he met Abraham of course he was he was also Elohim but that wasn't really the name he was really known by because all he's got is Abraham one man and out of him he's going to be bring a seedline of Christ and by the time he gets to Egypt and Moses he's got two and a half million members in his family amen so you know and then and then we find that he would take various other names we would know him as mezc and then you don't hear any more of mezc because he becomes Jesus Christ and so so you know and then and we find that the the the one great truth that got locked away in the ages under the ceiling of the Seven Seals was a mystery that Paul taught us that was revealed to us at the end time that there's also a my Jesus Christ there's a Mr Jesus and there's his church there's his body there's his bride and so God unveils himself you know by measure and and as he goes forward here's here's the the real takeaway that I need you to absorb tonight that he always is going forward yes you understand God doesn't stop back up and retool replan refigure recalculate and try it again he doesn't have to try try again his ways are perfect and so he goes forward and he unfolds now the reason that's important so important tonight is because if you agree that that's true then I'm going to say to you that it's true of you also you are to go forward you are to evolve you are to unfold you are to become amen so I just want that Concept in your mind so we know he eventually became Abraham and and we know that the name Abraham would then reflect his truer identity that was in God's mind and you know I mean I didn't you and I I didn't go get a name change when I came to faith in Christ you know when I I didn't get a a a change of my human name to reflect my new character but I was referred to differently before I was called a unbeliever now I'm a Believer before I was a sinner now I'm a saint before I had no righteousness now I do before I was called unconverted now I'm C converted amen see so you know someday um oh my someday friends we're going to get to sit down in heaven and tell our story oh man how we overcome my sometimes brother Kevin I thought to myself sometimes I think I'm going to be in heaven and I'm going to sit down to tell some people my story and I'm it's going to start like this a long time ago in a galaxy far far away and that's G to be true oh my goodness amen let me not be silly tonight but man some things you can't resist last time we read you some excerpts from Brother bram's excellent message titled Shalom and we found found out that uh there is to be excuse me let me make one quick change we found out that that there um is the need when we read those statements from Shalom and I'm not going to read them again tonight we may uh go back over them just a little bit uh on Sunday but one of the things that we found out was that there is the need and the desire of God for you that you become the expression of his word just like Jesus was a further continuation Here I Go Again a further expression of his word he desires that for you and I he didn't he never intended so we came from God we have a representation of God living inside us but God doesn't intend to populate heaven with Fallen Sons and Daughters amen he intends for us to get beyond that and he's even got a body an idea of a new body that I'll have that I won't ever have to come back here and live like this again thanks be to God so we we found out in our in the Shalom message that that there is a need to become part of God's word by believing it and surrendering to its guidance and its direction for our lives and you know if God used continuing expression of his words in the Bible in in his word in the Bible to I to identify himself then then I I I come back to it again because it's such an important Point how how would we imagine that it would be different for his kingdom of saints amen so if he has done that and he has went forward in the the expression of himself and every next advancement was better and higher and more amen he's never gotten less and lower and you understand so even even when he came as a human being that the Bible warns us not to despise the day of small things see because you know every time that that they build a a tabernacle a temple after Solomon's got wrecked the one from the Tabernacle in Wilderness to Solomon's Temple was a massive upgrade but after that one got tore down every successive one was lesser smaller and no Beauty in it till till you finally get to a lowly Nazarene in whom there was no Beauty at all but that was the greatest Temple that had ever been built amen so so again I make the point that if God used continuing expression or a continual unfolding of himself and in and in every continual unfolding of his personage of his personage it always matched his written word all right you agree well then how's it going how would it be different why would people think that Christianity would be less than that why would they think that that that we no longer that we can re be we can live as Christians completely regressed from the way the early Christian Church Church lived that that doesn't even make sense with the pattern of how God does it God is always adding more and more and it's becoming more and more and more and he gets greater and greater and greater and so we're promised here at the end time that he will get so great and that he he will Union himself with a body of Believers and that they will become into such Union in such Harmony The Headstone coming down upon the body that the dead for hundred hundreds of years will come from the grave amen that's not a small thing so the Christian faith then is is far more than form it's far more than habit even good habits it's far more than good church habits it's far more than a better way of conduct it's it's more than pump and Circumstance it's more than form and fashion it's more than weddings and funerals and baby dedications it's more than just you know uh you know uh uh stumping for this political ideology are coming over here for this social issue and deciding where we draw our lines the the the God is not even involved in stuff like that I'm here to tell you every bit of that pump and Circumstance and politics on all side is going to Ash and Cinder and there's going to be a new world here under a new monarch Hallelujah and you're you're you're being actively evolved to be part of that if you're willing there'll be nobody in his royal family forced to be there amen so the Holy Ghost is actually here uh to do more than be a life coach or a an advisor becoming part of God's word by believing it and surrendering to his guidance because that's how you do it because think about what what that means you're allowing the word to direct your speech your thoughts your activity your whole thing that makes up you am you're you're you're surrendering your way forward can I say it like that so becoming a part of God's word involves believing it it involves surrendering to his guidance and to his direction as you are being actively and progressively trained to rule you're here tonight being trained to rule and reign with him amen uh from his throne in glory and this is truly why the Holy Ghost was given to the church to accomplish just this very thing amen it's interesting that people don't want that that level of of um relationship with Christ and and the Bible speaks of people who would who would come as far as a form of godliness but they would deny the real power of the word to effect effectual change in their lives to where you don't just leave as you've heard me say many times you don't just leave a church service affected that's that can that can happen my goodness sometimes s the worship service we're so affected with an a we're so affected by that you saying my goodness I the word is the preaching will be anticlimactic this is so over the top and then sometimes the preaching will come in such a way and you'll get so affected and you'll oh my it'll it'll rise up determination and and by Godly I'm going to do it this time I'm really Lord I'm mean it this time for real I'm tired of the world and all this and you get right out that door yeah amen the the effect is gone yeah and you realize there was no effect you had an effect but there's no effective change to effect something means to effect a change I don't just want to be affected I I want to be changed yes amen amen as you've heard me say once I met Jesus I didn't want to be me anymore I wanted to be him I wanted to be just like him and so as I say this is this really is the the the heart of the matter of what the Holy Ghost has given to the church for and it's to accomplish a kingdom of saints who who own that who absorb it who assimilate it who take it into their bosom and say there's nothing in my arms I bring simply to thy cross I cling Lord take my houses my lands change my dreams and my plans I'm placing my whole life in your hands in doing so when you when you come to it that way you literally open up uh to see and understand God's purpose for us in the Rhythm of Life that is your life amen and so did did you know did you know there's a rhythm that God intends for you to live in did you know that there's a Rhythm that God intends for your life and that that that's what brother Brandon was referring to in the Shalom message and he was talking about you know the great composer and compos this this beautiful piece of music this masterful piece and you've got conductors and You've Got Musicians and there's training and there's practice and they didn't they didn't go get you know you know so and so and so and so off the the street hey you you play an instrument yeah a little bit okay come in here this is Phil harmonic Orchestra we've got a performance presidents here tonight uh we need you to stand in that's never going to happen amen you got to spend years being crafted and cultivated you've got to learn you've got to learn to be able to read the sheet music and and it and we're not talking about theological degrees we're talking about learning to let this be the guide of your life let this and it's not that I'm just getting good advice oh this is a good advice I should follow this it's more than that then this is just a person in written form but that person wants to be part of you wants to live in you wants to live through you so that so that this comes from Ink on paper and lives behind skin when this is closed for the last time the word will be flesh see so so when we look at like that when you're when you're willing to believe God's word when you're willing to surrender to his guidance and to his Direction and you're willing uh to to go through the training and sometimes it's in church and sometimes it's in life away from church and you're still being trained amen when you're willing to uh to do that you you open yourself up then to understand his purpose to understand the Rhythm he wants you and the beat he wants you to step in amen see there there's a certain part of his great Symphony that he desires to hear you play back to him brother brandham talked about how that the Bell maker you know back in the in the time when you know everything's electronic now but you know but they still have real artisians and Craftsmen and and you know when when they've got a certain Bell that they want it to have a certain Ting they've got to add there's a formula there's a recipe that he has to follow he can't just melt down a bunch of metal Hammer into a bell and it'll sound like that what he wants it to sound it's got to be built perfectly there'll be so much of this metal alloy and so much of that not too much because that'll flatten it out and then over here it'll have a real nice crisp you know and and then and then it gets shaped and gets molded and that way when he hits it it just has that certain Ting perfect it'll set that one there and start building another one and so God orders our lives and orders our footsteps that's why the Bible says that the the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord please don't don't limit that to just saying well the footsteps of the righteous order of the Lord he's just directing my life he's not just directing your life like like a traffic light God is literally you know that the Bible says Jesus was led of the spirit Into the Wilderness he didn't go there that was 40 days of suffering and trial and tribulation and there's not one of us who would volunteer yeah I'll take that one uh sign me up I'll go 40 days without eating and I'll and I'll face the enemy with his three great Temptations and and I'll you know and I'll and and I'll live among and and I think it's markk says you know Mark didn't record his Temptations like like the Matthew and I think Luke does but Mark says he lived among the wild beasts in the wilderness amen and the Bible you know if you I was just looking at it today or maybe yesterday I don't remember but I was looking at the Greek breakdown of the of the word there the spirit led him into the Wilderness and it and it's a and it's a word that that means literally that Jesus was really forced into it I'm not saying he resisted don't get me wrong he said I I've come to do thy will oh Lord I'm just simply saying that you know even his his Human Side said you know all the suffering that I'm going to go through a Calvary father if it's possible let this cup pass for me nevertheless not my will so he had a human will see and so so so yeah exactly so so so we find out then that that he's LED Into the Wilderness and this is how God molds our lives and shapes us and trains us for the world coming it's not just the footsteps of the righteous are ordered I got a nice buddy he's like a GPS and he keeps me on the straight and narrow it's so much more than that he might he might brother BR said he might commit you to suffering you know like he did job he might commit you to death like he did Paul he may commit you to this that or the other but his love is proven to us an election that he elected me before the foundation of the world and I don't know what all I'll do and be on the other side but he knows but here's what I do know I'm being trained for it yeah amen that's why my battles might be different from yours and yours might be different from the person beside you you say well why did I why did I have to do this and brother so and so didn't have to go through that sister so and so seems to be so blessed what happened to me God must like them more than he does me has nothing to do with that he doesn't show favoritism among people you know the bottom line comes down to it friends that that when you're and only and and that's a point I want to make only when you're it's only in your willingness to follow his word and humanly willing to allow him to guide that's when your your Clarity of purpose will come into you you'll you'll you'll be stronger than you think you can be and it won't be necessary for you to understand the trial you'll do it anyway and even if everything turns out what looks like it's bad and the whole world's falling down around you you'll still just when you finally get to the end of it if you've got nothing left to say but I know my redeemer liveth and at the last day I'll see him and that's all you can say about it and go to go to your destruction or whatever then then I'll go there with courage because I know he lives and I know the footsteps of the right are ordered of the Lord and I know that I have volunteered to be commandeered by the Holy Spirit God's family are not pushed through a pipe or poured into a mold to be autoshaped or pressed into some kind of an overcomer we overcome by the blood of the Lamb the word of Our Testimony amen we we we overcame they they stood there on that day and the Bible says they overcame because they love not their lives to death I'm here to tell you something friends there's nothing in this world or this life I would trade for the next one coming you can have this whole world Just Give Me Jesus you can have this one I'll take the next one oh Hallelujah I'm so glad to know there is a next one this one's so broken amen we're doing all we can not to save the world you can't save it it's Jesus already knew that he tells about that he he sent them out two by two he it's the same Jesus who told him in Matthew 24 that about the destruction of the world how it's going to end the gospel is not here to save the world it's here to save God's family in each age out of the world Amen because it doesn't matter what happens to the world he's coming back to rebuild it anyway amen so we have faith in Christ and the word of this hour but I I I need to say to you tonight that there is to be activity in our faith there is uh there is a life according to God's word to be lived out by his family in each age we're taught that in the word of God there's a portion of the word that's been laid out these 2,000 years of church history have not been an accident these 2,000 years of church history is not because God couldn't get a church perfected he had one perfected and could have took them in the Rapture in those first that first 20 years Church they were they they were perfect they had the token they had the abstract title they had the the the unveiled word they had the mystery of iniquity they had the mystery of MDC the understanding of the original sin the the godhead baptism what the Holy Ghost really is they were they were headed but because that Jesus had said that accept the seed go into the ground and die to biteth alone God was never intending to fill heaven with just that first church a he wanted the second one and the third one and the fourth one and the fifth one and the sixth one and he wants this one and he wants you hallelujah amen and so there is a portion of the word to be lived out by his family there's a there's a there's a piece of the Sheep music to be played back to him see he loved David for this reason and it's in every age and you don't have to be gifted you see you don't even have to be talented you say I'm not very gifted I'm very gifted musician I'm not a very gifted Christian I'm not a very gifted preacher I'm not very talented at hardly anything you don't have to be gifted or even talented uh because that with the word for each age an anointing comes down from the Throne of God upon the word and goes into your heart and causes it to live you don't have to be wildly gifted or talented you just have to believe you have to be willing to say Lord take my whole life there's an anointing for each age that comes down the prophet taught us that comes down on his word for that age and it causes it to live in its family it causes it to live the word for an age is Anointed in that age for his family of that age to live the part of the Sheep music that is for their age our age is unique in that we are the oneoff age that will that there will be many of us around the world who are still alive and remain at the coming of the Lord I plan to be alive and remain oh I'm here to tell you what are you doing tonight I'm remaining I'm a Believer and I'll be a believer when you see me tomorrow I'll be a believer it's not up and down for me see so he's got an anointing for each age and you know it's it's a sad reality that that ministers sometimes you know have to face the truth and we we pour our hearts out to people parents pour their hearts out to Children pre pastors pour their heart out and and and maybe you know I I stand here tonight and I and I say God wants to play his Sheep music through you he needs you to believe his word but he also needs you to be willing to live it he because faith is active it it moves it does something it's not passive faith I don't just stand back and go yeah I believe it's it's true the devil believes that the devil believes there is a God and fears and trembles you understand and so he so the prophet said it like this he said Satan knows what what the will of God is he just refuses to do it I'm glad I'm not that I'm glad there's no refusal from the moment I heard that eagle scream there's no refusal in me I might not have understood it all but something kept taking me forward I got to have a little more what are you listening I'm not sure but I I never heard anything like it and it draws you and it draws you and it draws you and you find yourself soaring Like an Eagle should be soaring you find out how Lord how to get up here in this altitude you were built for it that's right but in some people you know that sometimes preachers have to sadly look out over an a audence I would like to very much like to not believe I'm looking at anyone tonight but sometimes I've I've had to look out at audience and say look maybe you don't want that to be true upon you maybe you don't want to be you don't want God to direct your life you have you have other big plans for your life and no parent or Pastor is is going to dissuade you from your goal goals are essential there's no problem having a goal there's nothing wrong with with big dreams dream big Prophet said ask big things of God see but but but I want just want to say that I promise you you will never have as big of a plan and as good of a plan for you as God has for you you might have all kinds of plans but I'm here to tell you he's got a much grander plan for you and he knows this that he he knows he you know and and I and I would I I God knoweth him that are his I'm glad the word has that seal upon it but I just would say this for you tonight that everyone hearing my voice would know that it is those people at the end time who know their God who will do great exploits amen amen so you may have big plans you may have big dreams and you're not about to let the gospel Sidetrack any of that I just want you to understand that's your choice but just know that you're passing on something Beyond description because this the Bible says if you believe the Bible if the Bible is to be believed it is the people at the end time who know their God who do all the great exploits say wow this Blue Chip company did that this great man did that this amount of wealth this politician that you know what that means to God not that it doesn't even mean that to God see so it it is those people it is those people and I I like to believe I am and I like to believe that all of you are who are willing to place their short Vapor of a life oh my into the hands of one who can turn that life into eternal life how about that for a deal you come here with just a short Vapor you appear for a little while you vanish away and and brother B said if you if you think you're a big somebody he said get you a bucket of water here's a great test to blow up your pride it's a nuclear bomb to your pride get a bucket of water stick your finger in it pull it out and see if you can find the hole Yeah stick your whole stick your whole foot down in it pull it out the hole won't still be there I'm here to tell you friends there's nothing in this world worth losing my eternal life over I got a guide that I want to be in control I want him in control of every aspect of my life I am one of those who have decided that on my little short Vapor of a life that's here today and gone tomorrow I don't I don't like that life is that short I'd like to live forever and I'd like to live in a perfect world and I'd like to have a perfect body and there all kinds of things I got a long list and I already know it came out of this book it's those people you may not be one of them friends who are willing to let God control your life like that but it is those people who have lived in the rhythm of the word that appear on Mount Zion with the king oh my a number that no man could number of his Saints down all down through the es who love not their lives unto death that's your family that's my family and I'm proud of that family this is the place that Paul came back from and said the eye hath not seen neither hath the ear heard the things that God has in store for them it's never even entered into the heart of a man which takes in your imag ination it's never even entered into the heart of a man what God has in store for those that love him Paul came back from there said I heard things that couldn't even they're not even lawful to say I've always looked at that and I thought you know this is just brother Jason when I look in when I when I when I consider that Paul would say make that statement I heard things that aren't lawful to say and I thought okay this this is a Jew he was a Pharisee of the Pharisee a doctor of the law he would know what you're not allowed to do and say in the Old Testament Bible and I thought isn't it funny he didn't say that I I saw things that aren't lawful to be done because the Bible is filled with unlawful things that aren't to be done but in all the things that aren't lawful to say the list is very small see you're you you you never to take the name of the Lord in vain see people say oh I'd never use that kind of a curse word well excuse me but born again believer is not a curse word but if you take the name of Christian and you're really not a Christian right see I'm not saying you're cursing God I'm not saying you're use using profanity I'm saying you're taking a name in vain because you're really not that see and you've taken that name and that's why a Propet would say if you're not going to be a Christian stop calling yourself one because you only bring a disgrace and besides God would respect you more if you just be honest God respect you more and and you know and and it blows my mind uh when when when brother BR talks about how that we we bring them into the church and we just give them a membership and there's no repentance required no life change required and they can just continue to be as long as they'll you know join the church sign the book shake the preacher's hand pay tithes and offerings uh they it doesn't even matter you know and I had I had a young I had a young woman you know in her early 20s who her boyfriend brought her here to this church cuz he liked the preaching but she went to the big Golden Cathedral over here and she wanted to go back there and I said why don't you like us she said oh yeah you're are fine people she said but over there we can just do whatever we want that was her words to me she we can just do whatever we want I oh my goodness poor girl and I I tried desperately to try to show her why that's not a good thing she was looking at it as a positive I said that's not a positive that's a negative right see did did Jesus do what he wanted he said I came to do thy will oh God did he ever do what he wanted he he wanted a cup to pass from him but he went to Calvary anyway see so so so we so we realize he did always that which pleased the father and so I thought to myself there's only very few things that I can think of that are unlawful to say but one of the main things that is unlawful to say as a mortal is to make yourself God and that's why they took up stones to Stone Jesus Jesus and they said you being a man are claiming to be God and he had to defend himself you know with a quick step in the scripture and say well you called the prophets gods and if the word of the Lord come to them you called them Gods how do you condemn me because I say I'm the Son of God and all this and and you know and and they they they had no evidence at his trial and and you know they're they have to be careful because the Sanhedrin can't be public it's a public trial everybody's listening and so they they they know they don't have enough evidence to get a conviction it never hold up everybody will know it was a lie and so they they realize they get desperate and and the high priest steps forward and says okay are you the Son of God yes or no are you Messiah and you'd think Jesus would have had the human sense to go what are you talking about and live to fight another day and when Peter suggested that kind of a strategy Jesus said shall I shall the cup that my father has given me to drink shall shall I not drink it is Peter is that what you're I shouldn't drink the cup my father has given [Music] me you know so so so we realize that that the the thing that that Paul is hearing is he's hearing beings you can see them in Zechariah Zechariah 3 he Zachariah was Joshua the high priest in representation of the church was told I'll give you place among these you see standing by John saw them saw sea of glass saw the elders saw the Angels saw it all saw Mighty Angel strong Angel and one seated on the throne that's real that's not imagination that's not a fairy that's not Disney that's for real and he rules from his throne and he's really there and he's a real God and the Holy Ghost is real in your lives amen and he he said I heard I heard things said by people that are not lawful to say I want to tell you something friends I'm not going to dare say Paul didn't because there's things prophets know they don't tell the people everything but but brother Jason when I hear something like that I go no wonder because if they took up stones and brother brandham showed us how when they if they took up stones to Stone him when he said I and my father are one they'll say the same when you say the same thing they'll take up stones to Stone you I'm here to tell you it might be unlawful by the law but under the blood of the Lamb of God we are testifying of our identity I got a name change I had deity added to my life that's why we have authority in the name of Jesus and Paul's Paul comes back and he says it's never entered the heart of man the eyes never seen it the ears never heard it it's never Ed into the heart of man the things that God has in store for them that love him brother Brandman rejected King tells about his trip and coming back and seeing that land and I'm just going to read this right here brother Kenny get ready to come on back he says oh my precious friends so I gave you what the first church age messenger said let me give you what the seventh one said oh my friends my beloved my darlings of the Gospel my begotten children unto God listen to me your pastor you I wish there was some way I could explain it to you there's no words I couldn't find it it's not found anywhere but just beyond this last breath is the most glorious thing that you ever and he Trails off there is no way to explain it there's no way I can't do it he's GNA give it the old Notre Dame try I'm here to tell you just beyond this last breath they're there just beyond this last breath is the most glor glorious thing that you ever I I can't even I can't describe it I I don't have the words I don't have the words he said yeah he said there there's no way I just can't do it but whatever you do friend lay aside everything else I'm here to tell you something friends that's my part in The Inheritance that's your part in The Inheritance I'm reading about my inheritance and there's no way to explain it but I know that just beyond this last breath is a world waiting and oh my I want to renew my allegiance to the Holy Ghost tonight and say Lord God take my whole life take everything about me lead me and guide me I'm here to do thy will oh god let's stand God bless you friends brother Ken bring your team I'm here to do thy will oh Lord that is such a profound statement because you know I I've looked at at the Life of Christ and I remember one time years ago and I preached a sermon years ago this was a young man and I thought about Jesus we think about him as the Nazarene the 30s something year old walking the shores of Galilee going about doing good but he wasn't always that 30-some year old he was 18 he was 17 he's 15 he was 12 we know he was 12 we found him debating with doctors of divinity at the temple 12 years old and by the time he's 12 years old he already seems to have a complete Mastery of the word of God so much so that the doctors are amazed at what he knows about the word and I got thinking when was I know he went into the synagogue and the Word was handed for him to read and he turned to the place the spirit of the Lord God is upon me for Heath anointed me to preach the gospel preach Good Tidings and he goes on and on and on and on you could tell that he was quite comfortable handling this he's quite Adept at knowing what it said he doesn't even carry it around yet he can quote it at will see he never had to carry a Bible because he was the word made flesh but I wonder how old was he when he first turns to the book of Isaiah and he starts reading or he turns to the Book of Psalms and he starts reading or he turns to the other prophets and he starts reading things like all my bones they stare at me they wag their head at me he reads he was wounded for our transgression amen amen and and the the wounds for my healing were placed upon him he was afflicted he was deserted he he was buried among thieves and he's reading all of these things I wonder how old he was the first time he read that I promise you it wasn't in the Cradle but how old was he the first time he opened up the word and went wow that's me I don't know was he seven was he 10 is that why he was 12 years old in the temple cuz he at some point he already knew who was he says to Mary I must be about my father's business I'll promise you he already knew what the father's business was at 12 do you think it stopped him it didn't even slow him down by the time he was ready for his ministry he had known for decades what awaited him and I'm here to tell you something friends that's the kind of Courage I want to I want to say Lord God I don't know what this crazy world is becoming I just know I want my place in the word I want to be in that great number I want to be in that line I want to be in that possession that starts going upward and brother brandham said that dead in Christ will rise and and we which your life will be changed and and then he said well here'll Come Those Old Testament Saints marching marching up and he said and we'll fall right in line behind them marching oh Hallelujah I'm looking forward to that hour friends your future is bright no wonder I say that to you all the time your future is bright that's certain that's going to happen in my life in your and my lifetime oh I love him don't you amen I don't um see any prayer requests we had that the other day but come on let's pray together anyway gather up here around me in my life Lord be glorified be glorified

parameters of it and I just kept writing note after note after note Lord It's just such a burden on my heart for the people I know we must be nearing home I pray master that every person under the sound of my voice tonight will take taken way heavily look at it closely look at the word how it challenged us tonight A willingness to let the word become active in our lives a willingness to go more more than just in name only the willingness to be something Lord to be a part of something larger than myself to not chase after my own goals and my own dreams but to willfully and joyfully submit myself to your hand I want my life to play the music Lord I want it to be a song that sings Back to You amen a life song Lord we sing it here sometimes father it's a life song Father that that that a life that a person coming into the world though born in sin though they they their very conception their very shape Lord in the in the Earth was brought forth the wrong way and in and in iniquity but

world we're called of Christ I'm I'm not even called church I'm called bride hallelujah what a commission by a prophet to say I won't even call you church anymore because this is the age this is the time of the Bride the bride's time the bride's age the time when the bride is called out of the church a bride called out of a church that's the time of the Bride this is her Time Lord and I pray pray that Lord we will live it to the fullest in these closing scenes we know not how much longer but we know we're close we know that you will not wait much longer to reveal yourself to Benjamin you long to do that Lord you're finding that last seed oh help us Lord to be diligent to find it to preach the gospel with all of our heart and for every one of us to be preachers of the Gospel through our lived lives the voice of our lived lives lives it took a while for the bride to to catch that Lord we we knew there was a shout in a voice in a trumpet and we knew that the shout was the message it took a while to realize Lord As We Grew From an infancy and we began to grow and mature we began to realize our position and our place in Christ that there's a voice that's that's in the bride the voice of God is in her she has thus saith the Lord or she keeps still so that means Lord that the voice is a lived life she lives The Life of Christ or she doesn't do anything she just keeps still in other words everything she does is an expression of the lived life of the word of God it's a mystery the world is missing they they look for you to come on a on a conveyor on a on a big escalator drop down you'll come down take everybody home oh what a rude awakening that they'll find on that day when the bride is gone and and a secret catching away I pray for every heart Lord tonight young and old don't let them miss it Lord just beyond this last breath is a world that's beyond anything the I have ever seen the ear hath ever heard or has ever even entered into the heart of a man there's no words of prophet said I don't have words and Paul didn't even try to come up with any himself and he was a scholar I pray Lord that you'll Grant these things to us tonight we love you we thank you for your word and we go forward tonight Lord with a new determination to allow the word of God to dwell in US richly may it be so we commit it to you in Jesus name one more time before we take a testimony

this equipment was special order it took about six months to arrive and once it got on site we realized it was going to be incompatible and the problem was my distributor had informed me when I ordered it was non-refundable so I was stuck with a $330,000 unit that I couldn't use so I'd been trying to do everything I could to find a buyer for that unit but because of its specific setup and um you know design it was just very difficult so the last few months I've been faced with this bill to buy this unit and uh so we prayed prayed and I just said God you know you'll either find a job for me to you know use it on or you'll buy find a buyer and so two days ago I got a call that a company out of B Austin has purchased it in full and I am off the hook so thank thank God for that
