what we've been ministering on Amen what what the world sees and what we are displaying God bless you greet you in the name of the Lord happy to have you here in the house of God today amen greeting our visitors who are among us today uh see some brother John's family still hanging around and some other different faces that I might not be totally familiar with God bless you we're going to invite you to Exodus chapter 20 I'm sorry chapter 12 chapter 12 amen while you're finding your spot I'm sure that you were able to see as you came up that U there's been a little bit of change to the exterior um grounds amen we we had a team of Brothers yesterday we were able to do quite a bit move some things around and I tell you friends I was standing out there and I was looking after we'd kind of cleaned everything up and uh where it's the way you see it now and I just realized that that this renovation of the fellowship hall I told sister Debbie I said it's going to be more than you think it is it's more I realize it's more than I think it is brother Steve's renderings not withstanding it's going to be amazing and I'm just so happy so yesterday we had a little bit of a word of dedication prayer amen we thank all the brothers that came out and the sisters who fed us amen and they fed us good plenty of food left over if you get hungry today after church amen I seen a pile of food still left when I walked out I suppose it's still there hey honey okay so um so that's my daughter-in-law in case you're wondering who I'm calling honey on the U internet in case you don't see her amen so that's sister Rachel amen so um you know I I mentioned in my prayer yesterday that uh that it was reminiscent of the time of Nehemiah when he came back to to rebuild there and he had followed Ezra about 13 or so years after Ezra they had started the foundation of the temple and uh when Nehemiah come back he realized there was a lot more work that needed to be done it couldn't just be start a foundation we need to finish this thing and so you know he he he admonished the people and the Bible says that there Came Upon the people a spirit to work like an anointing and every family took their place on the wall if you go back and read the book of Nehemiah it's fantastic Story one of my favorite stories in all the Bible Nehemiah was not even really a preacher he was he was a governor he was a a man who God put his hand on that could get things done amen and the and the Bible says that all the families took their place on the wall all of them even even and then there were a couple of families who uh only had daughters and so they came to Nehemiah and they said hey we get a portion too we don't have sons Nehemiah said get on the wall and those girls got up there uh with Dad and Mom and they had their tools and went to work amen so it's a it's a group family wide effort amen aren't you glad that the Lord recognizes all the family of God and so we wanted to just remind you that going forward we're going to need a lot more help it's going to take that kind of solidarity that we saw yesterday and that kind of Amen we told brother Aaron Simmons that we found out he was smoking and so we I told him that the meat was so good that I was going to give him an Absolution and write an Indulgence that he's free to smoke amen amen till the project is over amen praise the Lord amen so if you have any trouble just tell them I said it was [Laughter] okay amen praise the Lord but he he uh he he he first we were a little bit alarmed because when he got here he said fellas were not going to be able to eat this meat at all we said why not he said as soon as I took it out he said it all fell apart and he wasn't wrong it was really good and we had a wonderful time we're sure grateful to be brother Aaron amen for fixing all that and all the different food that was made amen I ate too much but what's happens at the fellowship Paul stays at the fellowship PA amen and what sister Debbie doesn't actually see won't hurt her amen praise the Lord amen turn around and shake hands with somebody standing near you say God bless you amen praise the Lord so we're we're looking forward to what the Lord will do in coming months we finally actually have our permit in hand we can go forward I think the next stage is probably putting some concrete down out here and that's where the vision really came clear to me when I realized how much concrete is going to be added to the existing foundation so wonderful things lie ahead amen I trust that we won't ever get to finish it the Rapture will come first and amen and then the Antichrist can have it for 42 months we'll be back to claim it and but but as if we're still here we're going to finish it amen praise the Lord Exodus chap 12 this is where we started last week and we're continuing in our series on The Voice in the East Wind and I I don't need to read all of that 12th chapter again that we read last time let's just um they they were T they were commanded to take a lamb and let's begin reading at verse 8 they shall eat the Flesh of it in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not of it raw nor Soden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the pertinence thereof you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning you shall burn with fire and thus shall you eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt amen let's pray father we're just relaxing oursel once more in your word Lord and we want to to look at these very important things and scriptures as we tie them together as best as we can understand them Lord we have many quotes of the Prophet we're going to display today and Lord It's a little outside of Lord um my wheelhouse to do that normally I wouldn't do that that many at at any rate I have many and we want to go through them Lord but I I I think that it's so important so vital that I dare not not do it and so I commit it now to you that you'll give us understanding hearts and Minds today we commit it into your hands with perfect confidence in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be [Music] seated a couple of points that I made last time and I want to just uh make a few of those points that we closed with last time this was not a closing point this was actually an opening point that I used last Sunday and I want to reemphasize that where the the verse said that you shall eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and it it it sounds like this is something urgent that it has the language of something they're doing quickly and the very next words you shall we think of the implications for us today I'm of the opinion that that the that the that the lamb that we're feasting on today that you ought to not come to the house of God lethargically or whimsically or just because it's a habit I think that it's the Lord's Passover we are to eat it with our shoes ready our staff in our hand eat it in haste we're going somewhere this is important do you under do you read that the same way I read it that this is important this is vital this is critical and this is not something to take lightly this is not something to to say nothing of taking it halfhazard to say nothing even more uh uh of just taking the word of God casually I don't believe that God says anything in his word that we ought to just take casually God is very he he he you realize friends that the Bible says that that he values the word even above his own name now I mean if the whole family in heaven has a name and if the powers of the Kingdom operate by the name and if you're if you're if the only way to gain salvation is through the correct name then I would say name is Paramount amen amen amen so imagine now if you will what does it mean when we find that he actually values the word even higher than that amen so I think that it ought to be a little bit of a of a shock I if if I'm able today you know I I if if you're if you seem to have um a casualness about what the word has called us to in this hour I hope the Lord will throw cold water in your face and or or do something to shock you you know to to get a baby to take in the Breath of Life they give it a good SWAT they get they shake it they Jerk it they do something they they initialize it and so it is it is my prayer as a minister today that even if I have to shock you even if something is stun you then well and good and praise the name of the Lord because we need to get moving this is something we're almost home it's almost over we're coming to a to a crescendo of all the ages and you don't want to be taking that lightly say well why why would you say that people are taking that lightly well sometimes I can just see it in their church discipline and their Church schedule I can see it I can see how casually they take even obeying the word that says come to the house of God the more as you see the day approaching my I can only conclude they don't see the day approaching so all the more reason I need to shock you and say you can't stay here this world is burning down it's on fire now and and maybe you the Holy Spirit needs to shake you and say hey pay attention things are happening quickly and the and the world the bride is going to go suddenly even when Jesus that the prophecy concerning him was the one whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple and when he did almost all of Israel just nonchalantly a weighed it and thought about it and considered it and just moved on but there were a few who said is not this the Messiah is not this the one that we've looked for all this time I'm here to tell you something friends I I it's it's not the fault of the holy spirit that modern Christianity just sees uh Christianity as just a casual religion it's not that it's the power of God under salvation that's what the gospel is for we find that the world has lost its identity and that's pulpits are responsible for that because they stopped preaching the true identity of Christ in his word and every and things have become just Theory and just you know Theology and I'm here to tell you something friends the word of God is Not has never been and will never be theology it's not data in this data age it's not data the word of God I is is a person the word of God is Christ Christ was his word see and so when you're feeding on the word of God you need to realize this is the most vital thing that you can do and so you you you come to the presence of the Lord whether it's in prayer in your prayer Closet in your morning devotion time or in the house of God or before you back out of your driveway or before you step out on a job site I hope you're calling on the Lord to watch over you and keep you safe and help your family and bless you in your efforts that's it's important friends you have not because you ask not I learned a long time ago if I need something ask the Lord you can't believe how many things I get that other people don't CU they don't ask and I and I don't ask to to consume it upon my lust I ask because I need it I say Lord I need your presence in my life today I need sharp spiritual vision I need Zeal in my heart I need a I need a a a a desire in my heart for more of Christ nothing casual about it you know we we said last time how that we had arrived at a critical Tipping Point these were some of the very comments I I made last time and um this this is actually a transcript of the words I have a friend of mine in in Canada and years ago he started transcribing all my sermons and he sends them to me and it's he says does it help you I said is that's an understatement I said especially if I'm in a lengthy series and I'm not sure what I said have I already covered this do I need to say it again you know because I I preached all the time I'm either on the internet preaching I'm in a pull pit here or pull pit somewhere preaching and I say everything and I go wow did I even say that here and it was really important I need to say it here so I can go back and look amen and say oh no I haven't said that so here it comes but I but uh he and so especially in series preaching it's so helpful to me and I'm grateful to brother uh Mark coffee for it and he says um so I had said to you last time some of the very last statements is that we had reached a Tipping Point for Humanity and that there has been a sea change there has been something that has transpired that's not small it's not little it's not casual I'm here to tell you something friend says brother Jason that fantastic Sunday school sermon this morning lesson this morning and lining up you know it's it's something that we have to constantly do we can't just keep going back and identifying modern events of 1965 those aren't even modern events anymore and a prophet identified them and correlated them to prophecy and it excited the bride well this is 2024 and we still need to clarify modern events in Prophecy so that you know where you're standing so that you know where God is you've got to see his movements don't get caught not seeing his movements don't get caught in laziness and and you know and unconcerned because as we said the bride is going to leave here rapidly on that morning the Bible describes it that in a moment in the twinkling of an eye in a moment friends think of it the dead in Christ shall rise and then we which are alive and Reign shall be changed that's not something that's going to take a lot of time that's going to go around the world and one of these mornings you're going to brother bam said you're going to turn around and there'll be that loved one that's been gone on for years he said you'll feel a little something like a pain go through your body he said that's the last pain you will ever [Applause] feel amen so the Holy Spirit you know is uh is impressing his Prophet you know to to to bring out this end time danger that you must have the token on display because that's the identity of his family that's how the death angel identified God's family because it didn't say as we pointed out several Services ago it didn't say that the death angel would come through and strike all the Egyptians it said it would strike all the land of Egypt everybody that was in it who didn't have the token on display be they Hebrew or Egyptian amen so it's not you know I I'm in the message or I go to message church or my parents were in the prophets meetings that's not it there's no salvation for me because my mother was set in the prophet's meetings you know there there's no there's not brother brandham takes Jesus coming out of the Tomb in in the Rising Sun and he says that was great for him but what good does that do me unless I Rise with him see so don't get caught sleeping you see this is a this is an hour to be to really be checking and asking the Lord to help you to be marching to the step of the Gospel remember that the even the bride gets out of Step she has that weakness that tendency that let me just say and and here's the thing if you'll remember when brother brandham showed and he had the vision of the preview of the bride and he said what caused those those elected girls true Daughters of the Kingdom at the end of the line meaning it's us yeah the last ones coming through and he said what caused them to get now they didn't backslide they just got out of Step they just it just their life wasn't keeping up their Revelation wasn't matching the Holy Spirit and the Rhythm got messed up and he said what caused that is they were watching that other group yeah that fancy church that was being led by a witch and dancing to rock and roll and they went off you see it's not it's not just that they were admiring them because he said all the screaming as they went off and plunged into the abyss and I'm here to tell you something friends don't even get distracted by the judgments you see going and happening to the world the Lord will watch out for you just commit your life just get closer just snuggle up that much closer to the Lord amen amen yes sir amen so so we find then that that he he was warning his prophet in this day to take and he preached it four different times on the token and we've been ministering on The Voice in the East Wind and I I I have have said to you so many times about Pharaoh after after seven different um things had come to pass you would have thought that he would have heard the judgments coming in the East Wind cuz Moses had said here comes a judgment and then here come the East Wind and you would have think he would have went wow this has went this has hit seven out of seven times I better make some preparation he didn't amen he ignored it and in the morning on the wind came the Locust and then it was too late and so once Moses pronounced that plague by morning's light we said to you last time it was too late for Pharaoh because the morning brought the Locust on the Wind by morning it was too late for Egypt and uh you know and and and I I was just cautioning you that it's blowing hard we've it's been blowing for a while excuse me get this thing adjusted right it's been blowing for a while and it's ramping up and I'm I want you to understand that it's not going to get better the madness that you see in the world is not going to improve and it doesn't matter who they elect for president and it doesn't matter what the FED does with our monetary system it doesn't matter uh you know if this pontiff goes and they put another one it doesn't matter who wins what war uh across Europe it doesn't matter the only thing that that matters is Christ is getting ready to come for his bride and the world has slipped into complete Madness as a prophet said it would it would go totally insane it has and it's getting he said it must get worse it there'll be no peace till Jesus comes I'm glad he's coming I'm glad he's going to set up a new kingdom I'm glad that there's going to be a new king to rule the world do you hear the spirit calling you today that was what I was closing with last time do you hear the voice in the East Wind do you hear Do you hear here's a good question I asked you last time I want to this is the the basis that I need to launch with because of what we're about to look at do you hear the father's voice in the message of the hour I'm not talking about do you have physical ears that can hear a man preaching from 60 years ago and it's on a tape and now it's digital and we're gonna we can play it or we can read it it's not what I'm talking about I when I read the Bible I'm not reading a man named Paul sitting in a prison writing words that's not that's not how I look at it when I read his words I'm not hearing the words of Paul I'm hearing the words of the father do you hear the words of the father in the message of this hour because I can tell you that's where he's speaking that's where he's speaking and the so so when I say to you today pay Keen attention to this fact that the father not a man who's been gone 60 years the Father of Lights from which every good thing comes down amen the one in whom is no Shadow no variableness no shadow of turning the one who's the same yesterday today and forever the one who appeared who talked with with Adam in the garden the one who talked with Abraham the one who came down into the water to John the one who came to Paul on the road to Damascus that one that one the one who said to Peter don't call unclean what I've called clean the one who John saw High Isaiah saw him high lifted up John confirmed it he was Seated on a throne that one that's the one who is now saying to you you must have the token on display it's your only way to escape it can't just be what they had in the ages and even if even if even if you have a faith in Christ speaking now we're not talking about a revealed Faith that's the new birth understand amen brother Brandon wasn't saying the new birth isn't isn't a revealed Faith he's talking about just a human Faith even if you have made a human choice and a human decision and spoke human words from a human faith in a human Jesus Christ from 2,000 years ago that e and and and there's a certain amount of Covenant that comes with that but that even if you have a faith a mental faith in Christ that faith is annulled and by itself will not and cannot take you in the Rapture what can take you on the rap in the Rapture is when you have the life of the speaker in you living out through you on display the reason that this is lost is because an understanding of who Christ was as a man and as God Is Lost and that that's that was attacked in the very first age and so that's that's where the message Begins the message of the hour comes because at the end of the Philadelphian age as the last age dawned he set an Open Door which was a revelation of Christ and he opened that door and what would it do it would begin the restoration of the deity of Jesus Christ to show that he's not a second or third person he's the person see and and and and that would that would just keep unfolding and unfolding until finally the lamb would would take the book open the seals and descend himself in a revelation of his person to a bride to a prophet who would then give it to a bride that's the scripture hallu and she would eat it and in eating it she would assimilate it and she would become it so when you become the word that's the token on display because that guides your life and informs your thinking makes your choices it governs your actions and your reactions brother Bram talks about how you might speak in tongues you might not we might hear the sound of a rushing wind today we might not did you know that in all of brother bram's Ministry he only ever had that experience one time that I can find in his entire Ministry and he's in a meeting and he tells just like on the day of Pentecost he said we heard a rushing wind and it's on tape you can hear it and brother brandham said that's the first and only time that's ever happened just like it happened on the day of Pentecost so it's not necessary that every time we gather that we hear a rushing Mighty win it's not necessary that you speak in tongues every time you come before God or that you or that you have any kind of sensation or any kind of uh any kind of display that Satan could possibly impersonate brother Bram says you might do those things and you might not but one thing for sure you will do you will come subject to every word and your life will say Amen to the revealed word that's the evidence of a new birth say well why does it got to be that way cuz that's what Jesus did that's how he came that's what he did that's how he lived and he said because I Live Now you can live also the way I lived you can live say oh well he had all kinds of great power but in the wilderness he didn't use it he could have used it against the devil the devil said turn these Stones you're hungry he was turn these stones into bread he wouldn't do it he refused he could have used his great power he had all power he had he had demonstrated his power when he came up to a fig tree that bore no figs and he destroyed it with a word see so he he he used his power when he came walking on the water defying the laws of physics he used his power when he extended it to Peter and said come on and Peter stepped out and then Peter is breaking the laws of physics until he took his eyes off of the word just like that little girl at the end of the line took her eyes and started watching the wrong thing don't watch the wrong thing Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus commit your whole life to looking into his word and knowing his person am but in the wilderness he didn't use his great power because Prophet said he wanted to show to his children church that they could defeat the Devil also the way he did by the word and that's why the word and the word alone not a denominational word that's too limited that'll never move the devil but but when you have the Living Word then you're not it's not just memory verse it's not a School of Theology it's not that you're quoting even quotes of the Prophet that Satan is so not afraid of that he doesn't care how religious you are and he doesn't even care how right you are in your Doctrine what he fears is you'll get the life that the life will be on display and that's what he has to back down to not correct Doctrine he probably understands the doctrine correctly as good as you do he knows the will of God but he refuses to obey it listen the Bible says he's wiser than Daniel he ain't no joke when the Lord built him an enemy he didn't build 90 lb weak uh weakling he build an enemy that has equal to him in power in everything except creation he doesn't have the creative word you which means that he can't speak you into him you can take a creative word and resist him and so powerful is it that even though you're born in sin and belong to him the creative word can make you a new creation in Christ jesusall and you will be legit a child of God that every devil will howl and faint when you come walking down the road there's value in having the token on display I won't if I don't get going I'm not going to get very far again but it's okay so so we realize then that you have to have it on display all right let me let me power up and get going here all right that says part six that was last week that today was actually part seven and we're the identification of Christ in our lives and we were in the final plague part two because the final plague is death all right let's go all the way down uh I think to yeah there's where we finished what an hour we're living in oh what an hour what an hour friend you say Amen to that amen what an hour that we are living in let me get all my ducks in a row here all right so he says here the blood displayed over the door identified the believer because the innocent life had gone out of the lamb but could not come back on the believer so he had to have a display of chemistry he had to have like a paint a blood of chemistry that showed that life went from him now the just in case you've missed the the previous the point brother brandham is making is that people say oh the blood of Jesus the blood of Jesus and they don't even know what they're saying no one has the blood of Jesus the blood of Jesus was a chemistry that ran down the cross that's true and it fell on the earth and claimed the Earth that's correct it had its water baptism under Noah it got it had its sanctification experience under the blood of Christ coming down upon it you understand but but no one has that blood but it was not the the blood not the chemistry this was in the Old Testament they didn't have the ability like you have to get the Life In The Blood amen see that's what came back on the church God didn't pour blood said receive you the Holy Ghost meaning potentially of course the lamb hadn't died they couldn't receive the new birth just yet but it was a prophetic uh uh thing that he was doing just like when he came in the Garden of Eden and he Adam had had a form a theophonic form but God formed him a body Out of the Dust of the earth and the Bible says he breathed into him the breath of life amen so the it's the it's the the word of God that we have is the breathed word that's why it has life in it that's why when you take this word into your heart and you put Faith in it it's the same as deity speaking see so your voice doesn't travel without breath all right so all right so he says here this is back in the Old Testament they're leaving Egypt and he's making the point that you can't just claim the blood because I'm just going to say to you what does that even mean you don't got the blood oh I'm covered by the blood where where's the blood I'm I'm I'm kept by the blood okay how does what does that look like how does that work see so it's not just chemistry amen back here they had a chemistry but he's saying no more than the life of the innocent lamb could it could not come back on the believer see the life of the innocent lamb couldn't transfer to the believer making him white as snow make could not give anyone the Innocence the lamb had cuz his life wasn't transferable to a human see and so God had had the only holy life but God couldn't just transfer it into a human unless God came down and became a human and then as a human he suffered the penalty of his own law and he and that body hung on a tree you understand and blood ran down but then he came up out of a tomb and he ascended on high and he gave gifts unto men and he sent back his life and now the blood of the the Lamb of God can come back on the believer and make her see but that's got to drop down into here by a revelation it's got to make an 18-inch plunge down to your heart and it's got to and that's got to strike a gene of God in you and bring that thing to life see all right so so he goes on says now the Holy Spirit itself is the token not the physical blood of Jesus the blood of Jesus was shed at Calvary that is true but the blood as far as it is went back into the elements from which it came from the food that his human body lived on but you see inside that original created blood cell that began his body was a life of God that started the blood cell to moving the chemistry had no life in it itself and therefore it could not move now I I would just if you want to understand that in simpler terms if you die and you fall on this floor we could walk up to you all day long and say brother sister get up and get get go back to your seat blood is still inside you but there's no life in your blood so blood and of itself has to have the spirit of Life inside it you get that all right so he goes on but when the life of God came into the chemistry of his blood it formed a cell now brother brandham is describing here he's going to break it down how that Jesus was a a human being but he was also almighty God he was a it's a paradox in the form that he walked the shores of Galilee and we' never seen a human like that nor do we nor do will we ever have another human like that again because that he dieth he dieth no more and and the apostles said there was a time when we knew him after the flesh but henceforth we know him no longer like that because he died but he raised and he has Ed and he sent his life back and now we know him by the power of his resurrection see all right so he said so he says here let me read it again when the life of God came into the into the chemistry of his body it formed a cell it Formed its own cell then cell after cell then it became a man and that man was God Emanuel in flesh isn't that easy I love a prophet's simple way of explaining things that that flesh see then it became a man and that man was Emmanuel in flesh but when that life returned back the chemistry went back to the Earth elements but the token is the Holy Ghost upon the church that they see Christ all right so the so the token then I got to go slow I'm teaching all right so the token is not actually the physical chemistry of Jesus's blood but it's the life that moved through the chemistry of his blood amen he had human blood the physical chemistry of the blood of Jesus now I've spent a lot of time on this wording because wording is so important to me so pay close attention to how I say it the physical chemistry this is based on what brother bam is teaching us not only here but in all four sermons of the token right you're best to go hear them yeah all right so the physical chemistry of the blood of Jesus was human species blood the physical chemistry though it was not merely human species blood exactly like we have you understand and the reason for that is is because the first cell of it was a spoken word creation that's not how you came you came because an egg was fertilized and that produced produced a living life into a cell see and so from there it went through the natural birthing process and that cell multiplied into other cells build a spine pushed out arms pushed out legs amen and after a while you were born see it's a miracle brother Bram said the Virgin birth is easy to understand he said the natural birth is far more mysterious than the Virgin birth he said because the Virgin birth that's just God God can do anything he said but how does a a man and a woman come together and through through through the betting ground of of of human relations produce another human being that's alive as they are with its own individual personality and soul see all right so let's move a little further all right so here here I've I've quoted this to you I've even displayed it but I want to show it again today because I'm saying to you that his blood though it was human species blood was not merely human species blood exactly like we have here he is in 1965 lean not to th own understanding speaking of Jesus wasn't exactly like Solomon now the reason don't read the reason he was comparing to Solomon was because Solomon was a son of David and that's what Jesus was the son of David all right so he's going back to compare but he wasn't exactly like Solomon in so much that Solomon was a man born of a woman and begotten by an Earthly Father David but Jesus here's a paradox this is this makes him unique but Jesus Jesus was a virgin born son and now he's a human a virgin born human see but was not allog together a man but he was God the God man and he was more than a man he was a man plus but Solomon was just a man like you and I all right you got it so all right now I'm going to make some more statements I got your attention so the Spirit of God's life moving through human blood his human blood it made him more or I would say a further form beyond God just living as a spirit amen you got that it made God living in the form of a man am a human being now born of a woman to take the penalty of death in human flesh which was necessary amen this was the mystery of Jesus see he was he was not exactly like mzc though MDC was close because mzc was a spoken word creation also God spoke a body and stepped into it and went to talk to Abraham but but mzc couldn't die for your sins cuz he hadn't come through birth Jesus was the only begotten of the father see so the human blood that flowed through his veins which a prophet shows us which began as a single blood cell created by the spoken word of God but after his human Spirit of Life had left his body on the cross see after he was dead after his human life had left his body the Roman spear pierced that original blood cell that was a spoken word of God Amen and that released the life of God to come back on the believer you see the Paradox his human Spirit had already departed he was dead the Bible says they were going to break his legs they found out he's already dead but then but David had prophesied they pierce my side so the Roman doesn't even understand the soldier doesn't understand he falls under an inspiration to keep God's word and he pierces his side and that pierced that original blood cell and that released the life of God that released the bride as it were because you were contained in that life and that's the life that comes back on the believer so the life that's coming on you to give you a new birth is the life you had before the foundation of the world it was in God it was in Christ see so once God by his creative word had created both the seed and the egg in Mary's womb brother Brandon was about the only one who taught that they all said he was wrong but he wasn't he created both seed and egg in Mary's womb then nature just took it from there and the body of Jesus was constructed like any other human birth see there's no mystery in that he was a man but yet he was more than not exactly a man cuz he was a man plus he was the god man but I'm just a man see Solomon was just a man all right so we find that blood cells were multiplied and the body was formed and it pushed out arms brother Ram says that right on tape it pushed out arms it pushed out legs etc etc so a body which be which had its origin in the spoken word of God this is producing a body that had its origin in the spoken word of God beginning with a single blood cell by the creative spoken word of God human blood developed that carried within it the life of God's literal person not choking you am I this is necessary that you understand who Christ was and his relationship to the father this is how you understand what the token is because it's that life that's got to come back on you see not his chemistry not the blood that ran down the cross you ain't got that nobody does nobody kept it but even the disciples didn't run up and so let's collect it see and so so we we we realize then I want to make this statement again beginning with a single blood cell by the creative spoken word of God human blood developed and carried within it the life of God's literal person born as an infant baby he grew from there into a man making him from his very first day of life on the earth more than just an ordinary human it made him man plus it made him the God man the Bible uniquely describes him as the only begotten of the father being born of a woman through the paradoxical Miracle we call the Virgin birth amen this was a form of human being never before seen exactly MDC was close see but this this was a form of a human being that had never before been seen exactly God God now comes on the scene and he through the beding ground of a of a woman he brings into a human body as I've said before a for form of a man that would never need to be again in that limited form you say what Jesus in a limited form of course remember God never intended to stay bottled up in one human walking the shores of Galilee that was not going to build a kingdom the whole purpose was to God to come in that form a form you could never come in and satisfy the penalty of death and take death upon himself raise his own self up out of the Grave nobody did it for him and if that same spirit that raised Jesus from the grave dwell in you it shall also Quicken your mortal [Applause] bodyl so in this form a unique individual that had never been and would not be needed again Jesus moved on he moved on to the form of being glorified after his death and his burial right amen he resurrected in a glorified body the body that went to the Grave could be killed and was the body he rose in could not be killed the body he went to the grave in aged got sick and died the body that he rose in is immune from all of [Applause] that understand so he resurrected in the glorified body and that's the form that every son and daughter of God will come to in the end he doesn't need you to be a human and go to Calvary you you're you become a new creation in Christ and if you live and Believe on him you shall never die this body might lay down in a grave that's a that's a completely irrelevant point but it'll but when the trumpet sounds Prophet said he'll know it's me and my my elements will come back together see now brother brandham teaches us that and who is this MDC when Abraham met him he was mesc he unfolds here see cuz why why why mzc because mzc was in a spoken word body you understand he met he met him he was MDC he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the Final End every son of Abraham every son of faith will absolutely do the same thing but I want you to watch how we have to come see he he he came he came from thought right into body you bypass that brother brandom said you bypassed that and so you're born in sin so he could redeem you and be a redeemer Hallelujah you say oh I'm glad He's My Redeemer I'm glad he's my father I'm redeemed because he's my dad I'm redeemed because I was part of him I'm not Redeemed by an accident I don't not a Believer by an accident I can't not believe his word because I came from his word and it found me no matter how hard I was running and I'm here to tell you friends I don't care how hard you're running today he knows where you're at and he will find you and I would advise you today just to throw up your hands and surrender right now cuz the Holy Ghost always gets his man or his woman and sometimes it can be a rough road to Ho so Just Surrender [Applause] [Music] today see so this is the Prototype that we are headed to Jesus rose as a prototype of the whole coming Kingdom we will have a body according to the scripture likened unto his glorified body not a body not a body merely formed and brought through a physical Union between a man and a woman we'll live in a body formed by the creative word of God right he goes on I'm running out of time again that's perfectly all right I already know I got two more parts so if we make three more four more five more brother Mark coffee just get ready to keep transcribing brother the token for the believer today friends do you see why that brother brandham would say to those theologians he said you believing that God is three persons he said Satan has told you that to make an idolator out of you you don't even understand the godhead you don't even understand the relationship between the Jesus as a as a human but not merely a human you don't understand how all of that worked and and it all goes back the whole reason that that works like I just explained it is because we understand what happened in the Garden of Eden we understand what broke everything so now Christ is coming back to fix it when when you know when someone asks you oh I don't know about that whole serpent seed thing just say Well then why did Jesus have to be virgin born what's the point why do you have to why do you have to come by a virgin why do you have to be a human at all see so so so he goes he goes on watch the token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost not a blood a chemistry but it's the holy spirit of God that is the token that God requires of the church today God must see this token he must see it in every one of us he must see it he must see it say but he already knows I have it he must see it I'll I'll assure you the death angel knew who had Lamb's blood but he had to see it on display then you know then what is in what what it that means that what is in you say I have the new birth well the fact that he has to see it means that what is in you is showing as something on you you understand they had the blood in the house but it had to be on the door on the outside so whatever you claim is in you it's got to be showing on you see so he goes on therefore as the evening Shadows are appearing and the Wrath is ready to be poured out from on high upon the ungodly Nations and upon the ungodly Believers upon the professors without a possession professing with no possession God is requiring a token that you yourself have received his token the Holy Ghost it's the only way everybody say the only way only way do you hear the voice of the father in the message it's the only way and the only sign that God will ever pass because it is the literal life of Jesus Christ returned back into the believer amen he goes on now is the token time that each house must be covered by the token each house of God must be covered by the token all that's inside of it must be covered by the token that's just simply saying it's got to be on display everywhere in your life in your home your activities your plans your dreams that your whole life that you you live breathe look and act and are a real Christian amen not a professor without being a possessor because the world is overrun by that amen the world is overrun by people who profess but don't possess and their life is a demonstration of it see so all that's inside of it must be covered by the token and the house of God is the body of Jesus Christ and by one Spirit we're all baptized into this token and become a part of it so these phrases then indicate that the individual just just like the the just like the house of the Lord right see we are we are called as individuals remember that the scripture says and I don't think I have it uh on the slides I do not but that's okay um I actually do know you not that ye are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and ye are not your own how is it that people decide to live outside of the bounds of Sanctified Holiness and still claim that they are owned by Christ I'm sorry it doesn't work like that when he has ownership of you in your life you will say Amen to every word now you will stumble and you will make mistakes but you will never be satisfied to have that as a lifestyle and you'll constantly be repented and asking God to help you be an overcomer see because your nature he that's born of God hath no more conscious of sin the desires of the world are gone from him the body still has all kinds of temptable fallacies and problems and we still have to repent daily but I Repent daily cuz I don't want to be uh in a fallen condition my desires for that are gone see and that's that can only happen so by so by one Spirit brother brandham says here we're all baptized into this token and become part of it that God said when I see the token displayed I'll pass over you what an hour that we're living all right I'm going to read uh a bunch of quotes from 1954 I'm going to go through them I'm going to comment almost none at all I just want to give you this and then we'll close out you all right you got another five or 10 minutes all right so brother brandham is all the way back in 1954 he's preaching a series of questions and answers and this is his second installment he says now we're fixing to take communion just in a moment and I want this to really sink into you the thing of it is what is in your heart will produce make your life what kind of a seed you put in the ground will produce after its kind you might take a gysum weed seed and an onion seed and they look so perfectly likee till the very best of man couldn't tell them apart that's right the only thing you have to do is plant them they both look alike natural but plant them they both will produce and one will be a gemson weed and the other one will be an onion so he's making the point that people can say I'm a Christian but what does their life produce because every seed brings forth after its kind and a and a man or a woman that professes to be a Christian and don't live that kind of Life by the grace of God is a gems some weed by their fruits you shall know them if that thing's in your heart Bears record of what you are somewhere else listen to this if it's evil it Bears record that you're down here when you die you'll just have to go to where you are already if you're good because God has made you good see now this is a revelation then you're born again and you're bound to go that way because that life will have to bear record with this place if it Bears record of here that there's where you go if it Bears record up there there's where you go I love a simple Prophet isn't that beautiful there's where you go what you are here get this in your mind now I'm going to close so am I right here but what you are here is a sign that you are something else somewhere you've always wanted to be in Perfection you Christians Hallelujah there is a Perfection and that Perfection is not in this life there's one coming where I will be perfect I've always wanted to be Hallelujah I've always say why do you want to be holy there's just something in me I hate unholiness I love Holiness I love clean I'm going somewhere where there's cleanness Hallelujah I lo my weaknesses I hope you loathe your weaknesses I want to be perfect I don't care about being rich I don't care about having friends and likes I want to be perfect but every man and woman here that's a Christian every person that is a Christian here now is already glorified in the presence of Jesus Christ and you've got another body you won't have some other time you have right now right now there's another body waiting for you if this one should perish amen you say well brother brandham my church teaches that we must accept Jesus Christ our personal savior if we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ we are saved if your life doesn't compare with that you haven't made it yet fine they're not wrong in that teaching brother brandom is just adding an addendum that's fine you believe that but if your life doesn't compare with that then you haven't made it yet let me help you today if your life doesn't compare with the word of God you haven't made it yet I'm not insulting you I'm helping you repent give your heart to the Lord for real become a Believer let the let the supernatural life of God come down like a rushing Mighty Wind into your life and fill all the house that you are oh my I'm almost got it here do you know the devil believes that Jesus Christ is the Son of God do you know the devil publicly confess Jesus to be the Son of God that's scripture and he wasn't saved and he couldn't be saved he's the devil so confessing Jesus to be the Son of God see do you know all those Pharisees and Sadducees everyone was very Pious and religious people how they loved god with their hearts they thought and failed to see that innocent one the Son of God to recognize him to be the Son of God and yet they were very religious is that right very Pious very scholarly know the Bible better than any other Scholars today amen finally now look what the scripture says in the last days to you my Christian friend with Godly love this is it if I never see you again you remember my last words I'm reading to you a proph it now look what the scripture says in the last days to you my Christian friends how many Christian friends I got here to you with Godly love the Bible said in the last days men would come a time where men would be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God that's the age you live in don't get duped by that teenagers don't believe the Tommy rot nonsense that tries to tell you this message is false there's nothing but this message that can give you this kind of clarity and give you this kind of righteousness and give you this kind of Desire down inside your soul there's nothing else to compare to it you look up and look around at what's out there you'll see it right away people who attack it have no message to take you to so don't leave the one you got believe it absorb it assimilate it feed on it eat upon it you become it it's Christ trying to live inside of people and it's the power of God unto Salvation let's stand amen praise the Lord come brother Ken with your team amen it is the power of God unto salvation I'm not ashamed of it it's the power of God to Salvation I love it with my whole heart my whole mind and my all my soul amen do you love him friends my my my I hardly know what to sing brother Kenny you can sing whatever you feels on your heart I'll leave that with you amen do you love the Lord friends bow your heads with me across the building father as the musicians come around for their worship and singing after the as a prophet said now after the word is gone forth that's the time to really Worship the Lord because now Lord I have spent the better part of an hour casting out Devils amen that's what preaching does it cast out Devils it drives the prophet said it drives back the spirits of unbelief from people pushes them out the back door so that the Holy Spirit can deal with hearts now Lord the warning in the Bible is that when we come into the presence of God the word is like a mirror and it shows us who we really are it shows us to us we see it ourselves we see our shortcomings we see our faults and our failures we know now for sure that we have them there's no getting away getting away from it Lord the the the beauty is that this is what this is how you do it so that people can then repent cuz you can't get a man to repent unless you can show him he's wrong you can't get him saved unless you can prove to him he's lost so the gospel comes to prove to us Lord we know good and well here in your presence that there's nothing good that we can offer you nothing in my arms I bring simply to thy cross I cling Lord the danger becomes the Bible says that when we go out cuz those evil spirits are just waiting outside and when we go out of here we tend to forget the very kind of man or woman and that the word showed us we really were and therefore we just go right back to our old lifestyle and the word seems to have no effect on us don't let that happen today Father I'm preaching to people who I love with my whole heart people who you've loved and died for I don't think you have anything left to do to prove how much you love them all they have to do Lord if there's anyone here today any young person or old person single or married who has never really allowed the Holy Spirit to come in and be the Lord not just living not just they understand correct Doctrine and they live in varying degrees of a Sanctified life I know what I'm talking about I'm talking about where they really have allowed the Holy Ghost to come in and become the Lord of their entire life so that everything they do think and say is governed by another life that's beyond their own life and Lord that's the life that'll live on when this life this human life is over what I am for Christ is the only thing that will remain so I commit it to you today Lord I feel satisfied I feel that I that you're satisfied that I could stop where I stop there's much more to be said and we'll get to it Lord if there's time if we have life if you don't come in the morning if you're not here by next week we'll carry right on the Lord being willing father help us today help people they've heard enough Lord they've heard enough that you would be if you never spoke to them again they'd be accountable with what they've heard today so I commit it to you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ I commit this whole audience both visible and invisible those who are hearing it now live streaming those who are hearing it on an archive Lord may they just and if there's those who do know you in that way may they have a moment of rededication and say Lord I see it even more clearly today and I'm even more purposed in my heart to be like you Lord I raise up both my hands and I ask for that oh God grant that to me in all my life in all my activities and everything I do and think and say Lord may you be the Lord of all of it may you grant it father in Jesus name amen let's sing my brother to [Music] you if you need prayer you're welcome to come some
