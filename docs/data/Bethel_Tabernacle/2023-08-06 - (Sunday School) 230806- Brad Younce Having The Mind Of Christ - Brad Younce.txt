TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this house Stanford word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we just want to thank you for this opportunity to be gathered together in your house again Lord father we're just need you to come upon the scene Lord you see this little thought I have father I just pray God may you come and anoint it may you anoint their ears May something be said to be a blessing father we just place this service in your hands in Jesus name amen in Philippians 2 5 you don't have to turn they should have it on the screen let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus may God add a blessings you can have your seats now I had something totally different I was going to do JD had asked me a couple weeks ago so I'll say I'm good I've got I've got this one covered didn't have to do much I had something prepared and ready to go so whenever I got to ask within Friday night of course you know how that goes my mind got changed as I sit and going over this scripture here I just couldn't get away from it and come to find out that the one I was going to do was going to be about being an overcomer but then the more I got into this and yesterday I found a quote that actually you know what I should do this one first and then I have another one in two or three weeks do the overcomer so the title is having the mind of Christ up in Philippians chapter 2 verse one let's read that real quick and Paul was just saying if thou be therefore any consolation in Christ if anybody's got any comfort of love if anybody has fellowship with a spirit if anybody has battles of Mercy fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord and of one mind it's Paul who who's Paul talking about here is Paul talking about himself do you want to have my mind do you need my mind or your pastor's mind or your wife's mind or your brother or sister's mind it's he's not speaking of that because he brings back down in verse five let this mind be in you which also was in Christ Jesus so what mind is that what mind was in Jesus it was the mind of God it was the word I got thinking about this scripture and I got thinking about you know if I'm wrong y'all forgive me if I'm wrong I'll be corrected not and I want to be but why did Paul use the name this way Christ Jesus why did he say Jesus let this mind that was in Jesus be in you why do you say let this man that was in Christ Jesus be in you of course we all know we're taught that Jesus was a human being Jesus had thoughts human thoughts Jesus was depressed you know people makes fun of you you get depressed people's fun of you get your feelings hurt all these all these human thoughts that Jesus Jesus had Jesus would heal Christ through Jesus would heal the sick then Jesus would silver only on a rock groaning with the headache so Jesus so if we had the mind of Jesus what would we be doing just bear with me you know Jesus cried you know when Jesus walked up to the tomb of Lazarus Mary and Martha was sitting there and they're just they're just all sad their brother died Lazarus was one of Jesus's best friends Jesus cried that's what the Bible said Jesus wept but what happened when Jesus stepped up to the to The Rock turn roll the stone away that's when Christ took over when Jesus was asleep in the boat he was tired Jesus was just sleeping he was wore out from preaching the storm didn't even wake him up but what happened when Jesus stepped up on there Christ could do what no human could do Jesus was only Jesus until he was 30 years old because we know when Jesus went down and got baptized and brought back up the spirit of the Holy Ghost fell upon him that's when he becomes Jesus Christ that's when he becomes Jesus Christ so his let this mind that was in Christ Jesus be in you so what can we do could we go create a world Hallelujah but let this mind of Christ Jesus be in you let this mind of the Son of God be in you so if we have his mind we are his word you know it's like my brother Branham was out in the woods and God spoke says what are you hunting for Brothers says I'm hunting for squirrel what you speak it so he has him as a man could not speak a squirrel into existence right so we have which one of us could go speak our world into existence which one of us could heal our own self we can't with our own thinking we have to have a mind change yo like I said a minute ago if we have his word if we have his mind we are his word and we will do what his word says so when his word says wives submit yourselves to your husbands husbands submit yourselves to God we just do it if we have the mind of Christ it becomes automatic Hallelujah we don't have to think about it because we don't have our own mind we just we have his mind so we don't have to think we don't have to worry about it it's no longer how we think things should be we don't even have a thought coming according and with this mind of Christ Jesus we obey every word we just don't obey parts that we like that's easy to do it's a parts that hurts us it's the parts we don't like now we've been hearing some tough preaching last couple of weeks with some of squirming our seats and biting her fingernails and say oh Lord how much longer they got up here to preach because they're really getting on us it's some stuff that really hurts us but we say Amen to every word with the mind of Christ we'll say Amen to every word you know bro Jaden brother Jason been letting it out here you know that on feminism and all kinds there is too much of that there's there's also too much male chauvinism I'm just gonna go ahead and put my two cents in it since I'm here the women act the way they do because the men act the way we do you guys see these girls in these messages growing up they're wanting to to be their own person they're wanting to go to school get an education get a career and be their own person because they see the way their dads acted I grew up in this message I've seen the way the men I treated the women the women like a bunch of doormats they that's not the mind of Christ if Christ don't treat us that way does he come in these men come in and says give me a glass of water give me this all bossing around that's not the head of a household is it that's not the mind of Christ no wonder the girls are being the way they are because the men are the way they see their fathers but if the fathers would get in our place I'm putting myself and the wives will get in their place the kids will get theirs but it's all out a cater we need to change our thinking we need to get this mind of Christ Hallelujah y'all go for quiet so if a man would get his position the woman would get in theirs it will put us all back the way we were supposed to be it'll put our homes back in order that way God's it was God's way for us to be Hallelujah with his mind we will recognize the word to be the truth and it lives right through us and you can't help it you can't help living this way when the mind of Christ is in you with this mind of Christ we seek what he thinks we act the way he would act if we have the mind of Christ then you can say what you will and it'll come to pass Hallelujah we can't do that with our own mind right like I said you can't go speak a world to existence that's why we need the mind of Christ because our thinking gets us in trouble well I thought well I thought I did a lot of thinking thought got me in trouble Christ Jesus let this mind that was in Christ Jesus be in you what were your thoughts just today already oh I better get up and go to church if I don't the Pastoral the deacons will be calling me where you been why were you in church today my thought was I can't wait to get here I can't wait till church to start well after my part's over with huh the mind of Christ should be operating Among Us but in order for that to happen we need to lose our own mind says what we need today is a good old-fashioned Backwoods sky blue sin killing religion and the baptism of the Holy Ghost back in the church again a cleaning out Gun Barrel straight sky blue religion we need a cleaning out that's Starting Over Again that's the truth I'm not beside myself he says I may be mad but as I said last night I may feel I but I feel good this way I never did feel this way the other way so I just like to stay this way I did lose my mind I had to to find the mind of Christ every other believer has to that's right he says has to find the mind of Christ by losing our own mind but as long as we got our mind we can't find his again he says if you have the mind of Christ Christ will Express himself through you shows that shows that it's him not you you'll say he says some people are under illusions of things they go out become insane we know that's wrong that's the devil trying to impersonate the real thing before it gets here there's always a bogus he says you know we always go and say that man has lost his mind you see him do that he has lost his mind well he's under the control of the devil I like for some people look at us say they've lost their mind those people are crazy yes we are because we have the mind of Christ I mean he's lost her mind a real man is to lose his own thoughts his own thinking not come up blindly like that you come up with your right senses Christ takes you over and expresses himself and now through the world you're an insane person now if you're saying you're actually insane then there's nothing the devil can devil can't take you in complete control Hallelujah if you're insane with God the devil can't even take you in his control he'll make you do everything contrary if he has a control of you but when Christ takes you over he'll Express that word right through you because it's him because he is the word we cannot alter God's word we can't make the word say what we want it to say how many how many of us like to human being some of us likes to alter the word but we can't we cannot alter God's word we have to alter our thinking to his thinking so let the mind of Christ be in you and then you'll think what he thinks well when we lose our thinking what's happening in Romans chapter 12 verse 2 he says be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed this work transformed means to metaphors I hope I said that right metamorphosis change into a different physical form especially by Supernatural means to change the appearance or character of he was like a butterfly and when he starts it's a worm crawled on the ground eating what he eats and then it comes a certain time of life it grows a a cocoon around itself and a little while later out comes this butterfly is transformed to change into another form to transfigure you know Christ's appearance was changed mural Mount Transfiguration brother Brown says to be transformed is to be changed and made something different it's like a tadpole it's transformed from a tadpole to a frog once it would look like a little fish swimming he swims around he's got a head to tail everything looks just like a fish and then after a while it begins to lose its tail it'll transform from one species to another so instead of swimming it's hopping it got transformed you know what conformed is be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind renewing of your mind the things that you once thought upon to be precious lay that aside but be transformed to something else what you were one time to what you are now see by the renewing of your mind be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing I love this definition of renewing renovation that's my job that's what I do for a living I renovate I build we got a woman that that she buys these old houses and you she'll say come on look at this house what can we do this place and you look at it you're like burn it tear it down build a new one on top of it but when you go in you start demolishing everything you'll go in here rip out the kitchen you'll rip out the bathrooms you'll rip up the floor you'll take out walls put in beams and you'll put in a new kitchen new bathrooms new floors new sheetrock new paint is totally different you've actually renewed this house it was a complete renovation this house has been changed for the better it no longer looks the way it did before the house is no longer acting like it did before it was it's been transformed so this house was transformed by the renewing be not conform to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind we have to have our minds renewed to change the way we were thinking we were conformed at one time to this world we did whatever the world wants to do right we were thinking one way because we didn't have the right mind we had our own mind but we needed a renewal we need a renovation one day we were thinking our own thoughts doing our own things we were conformed to this world we were like a bunch of robots controlled by something pick up this drink pick up this cigarette shoot up this drug we were doing what we were told to do we were robots we were conformed to this world we had our own mind go this bar listen to this song we were doing what we were told we're just like robots automatic automatic doing what the devil in your mind told you to do but with that's when our mind was controlled by the devil you see when God has played but a God had placed the seed down on the inside of us before the foundation of the world that seed laid there inside you dormant no life there but all of a sudden one day light life struck that seed then we had a renewing we had a renewing then we saw our lives being transformed or once we were doing things out here that was wrong we now find ourselves oh we can't do that no more we have to dress right we have to act right we can no longer drink that we can no longer eat that eat the things in the world we changed our what we've eaten we changed our way of thinking Hallelujah we took on the mind of Christ then we started being transformed into something totally different it was the old there was an old brother George it's no longer there no more you know you go you meet your friends that you had out in the world where you been brother Luther why ain't you been to our parties why ain't you done this with us we used to have some good times so oh that old man's dead I've had a renewing I don't do those things no more I changed what I'm thinking my got the mind of Christ they've changed exactly or what I'm not who I used to be I am totally different hahaha Hallelujah were our thoughts were always negative right sometimes our thoughts still are negative I've been prayed for this thing over and over and I can't get healed I've prayed that I've had people pray for me over this beseting sin and I can't get rid of it Hallelujah we always thought the worst in every situation but now with the mind of Christ Our thinking should be changed we should be thinking different thoughts with the mind of Christ Paul and a couple of couple chapters later in Philippians 4 8 says finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue think on these things he tells exactly what to think lose our mind you say you've lost your mind his spirit is here if we can just let our mind drift into his let this mind that was in Christ be in you I want to read the part of this prayer we're in leadership it's right before we went off the scene he says oh God let me go Lord don't leave me behind Jesus let me go with you father I don't want to stay here on this Earth to watch these tribulations coming on I don't want to stay here in this Insanity I don't want to stand here when the Hideous sights but people losing their mind we look at men trying to act like beasts we wow we're here look like beasts the women trying to look like animals with the paint on their faces and knowing that these things are predicted to happen they go they'll go insane until the locusts will rise up with hair like women to Halt the women teeth like lions and things that you said the mental condition of the people will be completely gone we see it in the making now Lord help us restore us to the same mind of Christ Jesus our lord hallelujah what a time that's going to be we don't want to be here when these things take place we know what all this is all about when this all happens we're gonna be here gotta change your mind our mind starts thinking rapture we start thinking Rapture is going to take place one day have the mind of Christ have the mind of Christ in you because we have the mind of Christ and this leads up and I'm gonna quit early because I don't want to go further this leads up into the next one because we have the mind of Christ blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears because they hear and this quote right here it's a little empty but I want to read this to get us ready for next time the holy spirit in every age he that hath and ear let him hear what the spirit said to the churches there is not one Church age where this verse is not mentioned every single age has the same admonition to the people of every age he that hath an ear let him hear hmm let him hear what the spirit saith but it's absolutely impossible for all men to hear what the spirit says to the different ages in First Corinthians it says how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect ye not wisdom of this world nor the princess of this world they come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world do for they had known it they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory but as it is written I have not seen ear hath ear hath not heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for him that love him but God we hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of man saved the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things of God which were freely given to us by God which things also we speak of God for their foolishness unto them unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned you but he that is spiritual spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man for He Who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ that's why Jesus says therefore I speak to them in Parables because they sin see not and herein they hear not neither do they understand for this people's heart is wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have been closed lest at any time they shall see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart that they should be converted and I should heal them the last statement but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear Hallelujah Hallelujah that's just a preview of the next time let this mind that was in Christ Jesus be in you we're not going to go nowhere without it we're just gonna be sitting on the pew service after service with our own thinking change our way of thinking let's let the mind of Christ drift in two hours amen God bless you listen father we just thank you for this little thought this morning Lord father we just pray that's what we want father we don't want our own mind we want to lose our mind father so we can gain yours we want to let your mind be in US father Lord I just pray God may you take this portion and bless it Lord the greater portion is Yet to Come father may you be with the main part of this service father be with the singing the special singing Lord the most of all the minister Lord as brother Jason comes forth and Lord we come hungry expected to hear from heaven father we place today's service in your hands in Jesus name amen God bless you
