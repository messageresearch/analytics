sister Debbie ain't going to move so nobody else needs to worry about it amen praise the Lord so Amen brother Diggs will just have to amen amen we've done that before when we had two sides uh every once in a while I'd make make every everybody switch but oh I want people to be comfortable amen praise the Lord I remember brother years ago years ago brother Don ggle made an announcement he said now this is not Yankee Stadium there are no reserved seats except one sister Jean he's got the only reserved seat in the house brother Luther knows to make sure of that amen praise the Lord she's just too short and can't seal her people is the problem and uh so we want to uh be everybody to be comfortable amen amen God bless you today we're going to invite you to the Book of Revelation amen chapter 2 going to catch verses 18- 24 and uh once we get our power once we get the scripture read brother Mark then you can put the PowerPoint up amen happy to be back today I had a a long bunch of driving last couple weekends and yesterday again 10 hours of driving to and from a ministers meeting there in Lula Georgia but boy did I ever have a good time and it was really refreshing the weekend prayor at the men's meeting and then uh uh this weekend amen and I made it back both times for Sunday morning service now I won't make it back next Sunday because I'll be in Louisiana preaching and it'll be it'll be hard I'll be preaching on Sunday there I was preaching on Friday and Saturday so I was able to get back but amen we'll have you we'll have home plate covered here no worries amen God bless you we're taking today opposing the Judgment of Heaven part three I believe it's part three it should be I believe on the website if I've got that correct if it's not make it four but I believe it's part three amen you love the Lord I am um just looking to the Lord today and uh rather curiously how he's been operating for for today and I it's not it's not one of those situations where I get get carjacked on the way to church you know those happen every once in a while that's not what's happened here it's just that I I think I expected to go further in my notes today but the Lord seems to have from the earliest hours of this morning slowed me down and um so this might be a short sermon amen but I think the Lord wants to make a point and uh now that don't I mean brother Diggs will 15 minutes in say don't get nervous I'm getting ready to close that don't mean nothing so so I'm saying it might be a short sermon that don't necessarily mean anything but um it looks like it to me but I want your undivided attention and uh I I can see the purpose of God in it I truly can because we've been last time we spoke about what I call and what I've called for a long time the greatest existential threat to human existence and that and I've said that it's not Russia and it's not China and it's not North Korea and it's not any of that the greatest threat to human survival is the Beast system of the Antichrist that is going and the reason that it's a much greater threat is because it's going to take the world into the tribulation where the world in their Madness will destroy themselves and it will be an Extinction event and so there is no greater threat than the deception that was to come in the last day and remember this let me just say um because I I might forget it and it's not in my notes but I just want to say this that when we speak about the about the deception you you realize that this is something that mankind has well earned that God said in the end time he would send a strong delusion and the unbelievers would believe a lie and be damned by it amen you understand that so so when we when we think about this strong delusion and how that the people uh you know will believe a lie they've brought this on themselves we we talked about last time that we went back to Isaiah and we went in other places in the Old Testament it was their eyes they have closed their ears they have closed amen and so I again it's not the cruelty of God you're going to hear today where we read a quote here that we read maybe a little more than a couple years ago maybe and I I wanted to read it for us again today because it is extremely deceptive and and when he says you would believe a lie I'll send you a strong delusion to believe a lie and be damned by brother brandham rightly points out in the Greek text that it's actually the Lie the original lie now don't think of the original lie as sex in the Garden of Eden that was just the consequence of the reasoning away of God's word that was that was a consequence of believing see the the the lie because it was it was after Eve was told the LIE the Bible says then she saw that it was good for food and and one thing to be desired so say then brother Jason what was the LIE the lie that was in the Garden of Eden and the same lie that's operational today and the same lie that will take the world into the tribulation period missing the Rapture even Christians by the tens of millions will miss the Rapture because of believing this lie and the LIE is in a nutshell that the word of God can be compromised just a little bit that you don't actually have to believe all of it you can just believe 99% of it and you'll be okay and that's not true it's so cunning and it's so close that it would actually deceive the very elected if that were possible thank God it's not so so that's the LIE is that God won't actually do what he said he would do amen all right let's read Revelation CH 2 verses 18- 24 friends if it was not for the interval of time that little interval of time between the sixth and seventh seal where God and the sixth and seventh trumpet where God took a gentile Prophet sent him down into the Earth a seventh star in his right hand and sent him down just dropped him down in a little interval of time almost it's like snuck in got a bride ready and took them home if it wasn't for God doing that and us having this message we would believe the life we would also be caught in the delusion that the world you ought to be thankful oh you ought to thank God blessed are your eyes for they see your ears that they hear these things so so just just you know the Lord has me kind of in an odd frame of mind today and I feel very solemn in this and so it's it's so close to my heart that I've got to be able to stand on that day and say I have not shun you the whole C Revelation chapter 2 now this is the thot tyan age the fourth age the reason it's important is because this runs all the way to the end so watch uh and unto the angel of the church in thyra write these things sayeth the Son of God who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first not withstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess now this is a false church this is the Roman system of of a church she's had three Church ages already to pollute the world and now she's come to the fourth age which will then be a thousand years of Dark Ages and it'll be during that time that God will come under the fifth age with Luther to start back restoring the brid tree amen all right notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce you see what she's doing through her teaching she seduces get that don't read ahead look this way you get that through her teaching she seduces how will the Beast system persuade people to go into the tribulation he'll teach them or prophesy them right into it by telling them the original lie all of God's word you don't have to keep all of it God won't actually do what he said you can compromise the word of God just a little bit that's the lie that dams the world teaching and to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold I will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds verse 23 this is interesting and I will kill her children with death and brother Brandon is making it clear that these are the Harlot Daughters of organized religion now he's very clear not the people the system it's the organiz the organizations not the people brother Bram said God has plenty of godly people caught trapped in those systems and that's why the message of the hour came to call them out of that you're called out so you can be called up and if you're if you ever want to be caught up and called up like John in Revelation 4 do you want to be you want to be called up someday then you better be called out or you'll never hear come up unless you first hear come out see all right verse 23 and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know sure they will by the time they're in the tribulation and we're gone they'll certainly know it that I am he which searcheth the Reigns and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your works but I say unto you and to the rest in thyra as many as have not this Doctrine in which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you none other burden now that we know that this fourth age this Jezebel system carries all the way through to the destruction the fifth Church age sixth Church age seventh Church age is all about the restoration and he says I gave her a space to repent so so in that way Luther's message of justification he's trying to reform that Catholic church trying to get them to repent Wesley comes along and now he's got to get Luther and the Catholic Church to repent then the isua fathers come along now they got to get the Methodist and the lutherans and the Catholics to repent then a prophet comes along one born out of season he's trying to get the Pentecostals to repent nobody will repent amen amen and finally they close the doors to the prophet of the age and he says all men have forsaken me this is the present stage of my Ministry and then God calls him out west and shows him a vision says go back East because we're about to change the scene and now seals come open and a time of a bride begins where she's called out of these systems aren't you glad to be called out amen praise the Lord let's let's pray father we thank you Lord God for your word word today and Lord I I've I've humbled myself and as brother brandham said I humbled myself again Lord I wouldn't put my feet on the floor this morning without having my mind and Reporting Lord in the name of Jesus I put my feet on the floor I'm going forward today with the word to the people what is it that you have for us Lord father I had plenty of notes that was not the issue there's notes I won't get to today but you just seem to zero me in Lord on this thought thought to to bring it down once more father to make make it as the prophet said you drive a nail you got to make it cinch or clench you got to drive it all the way until it clenches so father I pray that you will grant it to us today and may Lord those who hear this message live today or those on the internet those by an archive that they will think deeply and Ponder what they're hearing today Father I ask you this in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated we'll have my PowerPoint thank you brother Mark amen so again I'm not going to cover a lot of but it seems like this portion uh and I've been myself part two I said man oh man when I get to part three it's going to be nuclear and the Lord just seems to have a slower pace for me today so I'm I'm as brother Dale would say cooling my Jets amen and it's uh it's a controlled burn believe me amen but hey you know brother brandom talks about that that that's real power he said you you you've got more power when you can do that you've got more power than the man that runs all over the platform and makes a big bunch of noise he said because you've learned learn to conquer yourself and I think that that that is Paramount today friends that we need to let we need to learn to conquer ourselves amen we have seen the enemy and it is us you know and this is this was the theme of what I was taking at the ministers meeting uh yesterday there in Lula Georgia uh be because we realize that our our you know the promise to Abraham was and to his seed remember it's the singular Christ seed which is a spiritual seed not the sons of Isaac because not all Israel is Israel you understand but that spiritual seed which was a faith Seed of Abraham the promise was that it would possess the Gate of its enemies and I and the Lord laid it on my heart and I think it's relevant to us today that I have no greater enemy than my flesh and this flesh has 10 Gates amen it has five In the Flesh and five in the spirit and gates are a stronghold to a city who controls the gate controls the city the enemy can breach the gate I'm here to tell you you can have every good intention and well and fine but if you don't guard these Gates you got a problem if you let the the enemy if you give your eyes and your ears and your feet and your hands to the wrong thing I'm here to tell you the S Satan will use that and he'll he'll light up your memory and then he'll anoint your imagination and then he'll come back here to your conscience and he'll bring bring it all forward and wrap it all up and and and you'll eat it like a birthday cake and the next thing you know you'll be on your knees repentant somewhere Lord forgive me I didn't mean to do that and that'll be true you really didn't mean to do that but you didn't guard the gates see so the promise is in the seed of Christ and that's why that's why it's it that's that's tanam out to what I'm preaching today there is no effective way hear me when I say it there is no effective way to guard the gates without a new birth because and you're going to see why here in a minute the carnal mind is enmity against God it could never even agree with God's word it takes the Holy Spirit to even draw you to eternal life you can't even you can't even decide you can't even decide to decide to get eternal life your mind is enmity it means it's hostile to God's word and that and that's that's not because you're a bad person it's because you're born in sin and that's why Jesus said you must you must you must be born again see he he he's not he's he he doesn't say you know uh in order to get in heaven you must believe William Brandon was a prophet what he said was you must be born again amen because he because if you're born again that only comes by the spirit of God and then you'll do the works of God which are to believe on him whom God ha sent see so it's we never want to get the cart ahead of the horse it's not about trying to be pleasing to God in our works it's you find your way to heaven you surrender your way there friends you you live because you're willing to die and whoever will save his life will lose it but whoever's willing to lose his life will save it amen am I in the scripture you know your Bible is that true see so it so it's not about living under a law because we we we we have been delivered from the law all right I don't want to get ahead of myself let me just let me just carry on we said to you last time how that how that Eve in the Garden of Eden that when she was when Eve was partaking of that which was forbidden because she had listened to reasoning and she had reasoned the word of God she she believed the lie that you can reason the word of God and therefore when she Eve as I pointed out to you last time Eve was not thinking oh I'm going to do this and it's going to break fellowship with God that wasn't on her mind at all Eve thought it was a good thing Eve went to Adam joyfully look what I've found I've got a whole new understanding you know we don't have to live under these laws exactly you see and so so Eve and I pointed out to you you say but I know people who are outside the message and love God and Eve also loved that being that came down remember we were talking about that Eve loved that being that came down every day in the cool of the evening and tucked them in and kissed them good night and spoke to them like a father would to his children Eve never imagined that what she was going to do would break the fellowship with that being but it did it broke that fellowship and it ended and then when Adam did it it broke the whole world Eve's not the one broke the world she couldn't only a Son of God could do that and Adam being the Son of God saving Eve broke the world Amen you understand so so we realize that that Adam was not even in the transgression he did it with his eyes wide open uh he was I mean to say he wasn't deceived he did it with his eyes wide open and so Eve got deceived by it so we find that the challenge today that the word challenges us with is that we're not we're we are another Eve but we're not like that one see now that was our sister we'll see her again today she'll have as much regret as David had for what he did they'll have as much regret as I what I've done and what you've done but I'm glad that God is a god of Mercy see and so so we realize that that you know she got misled into that by misinterpreted Theology and so we we're finding that today the challenge for us in the word is to prove to the world that we're not like that first Eve the second Adam was not like the first Adam the second Eve will not be like the first Eve I want to prove I'm one in a million I will not Li I will not accept this Harlot system of religion uh today I'm not going to believe in that Jezebel system or her children her Offspring see all right again not the people the system so but by disbelieving his word she indeed lost fellowship with the person of him and I and I said said to you then and I say it to you now I don't even know how to make it pler than that you can see it from the book of Genesis therefore to me in my mind the fall in Genesis it should be the first sign to the world that he and his word are the same thing that should be the first sign that when they see that that what Eve did in her action broke Fellowship because she disbelieved the word and when she disbel the word that broke fellowship with him then how is he not the word how do you how would the word World think I can believe in Christ but I don't have to believe all the word I can disregard parts of the Bible because I believe in the man on the cross and as I said to you uh that before he was the man on the cross he was the word that word built a body and that body went to the Cross but he was always the word see so if you think it through you'll see that this is exactly why the keeping of the law could come to an end but not the keeping of the word you get that because the the keeping of the law did come to an end amen it got fulfilled in Jesus but the keeping of the law did not end the keeping of the word you see so so when when the strict observance of the Old Testament law ended in Christ his family did not become Lawless we we came under a new law called The Law of Liberty it's still a law it has regulations it has borders and parameters it has requirements and prerequisites it it has identifying markers that you're under it or you're not under it you're you think you're under it but you're wrong see it is a law of Liberty it's not a lawlessness Christian Grace is not lawlessness that's that's turning Grace into disgrace the grace of God teaches us to deny ungodliness that's the Bible see so so you say I'm not under the law you're you're you're you're just under a different law see you're under the law of Liberty and the law of Liberty is not the law to go live how you want in a sinful condition the law of Liberty is that you finally can live according to the vision God had of you you couldn't do it before there wasn't a law behind you but now there's a law of Liberty that will Empower you to finally finally be the kind of man or woman that God intended for you to be so you can lay your head on your pillow at night content and know that you're living under the blessing of God in the will of God and that God can get behind your life see so we're now governed by a new law James 1:25 we don't just leave my PowerPoint there by the Mark I'm just going to quote this James 1:25 but who so lookth under the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed is can I make it pler I love James because of he's so plain spoken he just he just plain spoken listen to it again but who so lookth into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed amen all right so we find that this is the man whose Soul has been reconnected back to God and he now sits in Heavenly places when I think of that scripture I realize that we don't know everything about Dimensions we think we know because you're sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so the perfect law of Liberty is is really and I and I'm going to have to really explain this to you carefully I want your real close attention you're giving it to me so far please keep it keep it coming the perfect law of Liberty is full free moral is is full free moral agency at its best you're free moral agent because you have a soul now you can choose now you can reason that's great and it's dangerous you understand it's a two-edged sword it's fantastic it set you above all other in creation but there's a there's a side to that the enemy can come in and disrupt your harmony with the Lord see so I want to say it again the perfect law of Liberty is itself self uh it's the operational standard of full free moral agency at its best because only God can bring a mortal man from his sinful condition into this law this this elevated law of Liberty only God can do that you see you can't do that by joining a church that's right or just reading your Bible or even believing Doctrine you it's still no matter what you do your best effort is still filthiness to God it's got to be the grace of God the mercy of God Jesus said no man can come to me except he's drawn of my father see you can't come to me Jesus said until my father draws you oh and by the way you can't get to my father except through me so it's you're talking about an impossible situation you can't get to God but through Christ you can't come to Christ unless the father draws you you see what I'm saying so so we realize then that that only God can bring a mortal man from a sinful condition that he's born in to this law of Liberty which as we've said is really free moral agency at its best see because when when a man is born in sin this way he comes with a mind that is enmity against God brought on by the Fallen nature of his wrong birth amen you understand so you're in you got a real problem you're born in sin you you come into the world you're shaping in iniquity as the as a mashup of various scriptures describe so enmity your mind is enmity against God enmity means hostility and it and and it has some other synonymous Greek words that Greek word there uh that that that Paul is using the carnal mind as enmity against God it means it's h hostile toward God uh uh uh synonymous Greek words mean that it is that it's in a state of ill will or active malice you understand this is how you're born you say I'm a good person but your your carnal mind is in a state of Perpetual active malice against keeping this see and so it's a mind that that that it goes on to describe it in the Greek it goes on to describe that it's active malice it's hostility it's ill will it's a mind that could have a tendency toward hear me defamation or evil report about God's word that it would speak evil of God's word that it would defame God's word by and and you see scientists doing it all the time they defame God's word they disbelieve it and they say there's no such creature and they try to expl explain everything away with Evolution see and so they they defame when when you're and they do this because they are born with a broken mind amen that could not can't agree with God's word see and so it's a mind that would have a tendency toward doubt or defaming God's word or or giving an evil report about God's word even logical doubts and reasonings very much like the the Israelites at Cades Baria they had what did they have an evil report the spies came back two of them had a good report 10 of them had a bad report and the people reasoned that the 10 knew better than the two and the reason for that is is not because that Joshua and Caleb rebutted the report of the 10 the 10 said there's Giants Joshua and Caleb didn't rebut that they didn't say oh that's not true they said it doesn't matter we're more than able yes they're there but that doesn't matter yes the world is sin but it doesn't matter I can do all things through Christ so it just depends on who you want to serve who you want to believe so so we find then that that if that if I can observe understand and and choose myself to believe and live in a way that's pleasing to God then why do I need a savior all right I'm trying to go slow I want you to think with me you're going to think with me if I can observe and understand and choose myself to believe and live in a way pleasing to God then why do I need a savior and that was Paul's point that if salvation could come by the keeping of the law he said then the law would have been the standard but that could never produce it it had to come by the baptism of the Holy Ghost if I can get back to eternal life on my own why would I have to come God's provided way and then you say well that yeah you're right that's silly nobody would think like that you're wrong Millions think like that I don't need to believe all the word I can get back on my works I can just be a good person I can just oh they're good people when the Bible says there is none good not one not a single one there's only God only Christ is good see and Christ is his word so the only way to be good in the eyes of God is to look like the word to not look like it but be it how do I be it by eating it see by becoming it so why would I need the holy spirit of God to draw me or reveal anything to me I got everybody's attention I hope I do I'm going to really need everybody's attention because I don't want to have to preach this again for a little while so please make sure I have your undivided attention I might have to do like brother Diggs and come down and stand beside you and preach to you amen praise the Lord Brother dig as soon as he walks off the platform everybody gets nervous amen if you're going to come to the house of God you ought to pay attention why why'd you come if you're not going to pay attention this is the house of judgment this is the house of also of Life see so we come here to learn what God wants to say to us I promise you I promise you if Jesus materialized himself standing in front of this pull pit every one of you would pay attention see all right so watch so why would I need the holy spirit of God to draw me or reveal anything to me or speak to me at all if I can get myself there fair question why would I need to come God's provided way fair question why do I need God at all why do I need a savior if I can do it myself fair question then isn't the answer obvious I can't do it myself I need a savior I I don't I I need God's provid Ed way cuz I don't know the way because the true way is hidden it's narrow it's hard to find only the Holy Spirit can take you to it see so I am a free moral agent because well first of all I am a human being and even born wrong I am still hey I'm still made in the image of God I have a fully functioning conscience that tells me I shouldn't lie that I had that before I was born again right I uh you've got you are born in the image of God you you do have a fully functioning conscience brother brandom said when you told that first lie you knew but you shouldn't tell that no Mom it wasn't me and and and I was the best at it because I I could have cookie crumbs on me and say no Mom it wasn't me oh some somebody snuck in the window and spread cookie crumbs on me oh my sister Jean had enough wisdom to figure out get through that amen praise the Lord so so we find then that that hey I I'm a human being I'm a free moral agent and and even if I'm born wrong I'm still made in the image of God I've got a fully functioning conscience I have I have epic powers of reasoning I have a I have a naturally I mean why do I need God I've got a naturally occurring intelligence above all other animals I'm a human not only do I start with a head start on all other animals I can go to the institutions of learning and higher education and I can even accelerate and grow my intelligence why in the world would I need God why do I need a provided way see I'm a human I have free moral agency do I not I have reasoning do I not I'm intelligent am I not I'm a o all other creatures I can go to education I can get a higher education through science and culture I can achieve what I want amen and all of that is true everything I just said is true you can observe what to believe or disbelieve do or not do up to the point where sin limits your carnal mind and you fall short of eternal life and I'll tell you if you fall short of eternal life I don't care what you achieve academically you're finished you'll come to an end and your life will be for not and your education will be for not all your effort and all your attempts at success and you actually might achieve them but it will go to Ash and Cinder amen only Eternal has no beginning and no ending so eternal life then is not achieved I hope I have convinced you at least of that today that eternal life is not and cannot be achieved about and how not do wrong and even has a whole religion around it and people can concentrate their way into that but that's not eternal life you understand so as brother Bram said many good men had died di down Through the Ages and brother Brenham said some of them even died for a real cause but you know meaning a good cause but there never was one who could raise himself up again from the dead I present to you the man Christ Jesus the only one like him Hallelujah this is the one that can lead you and guide you to eternal life and education and science can't do it your reasoning can't do it logical reasoning can't do it the resurrection was a supernatural event you believe that brother Brandon talks about the Bible being a supernatural book the Bible is a supernatural book see and it's and it's it's even written in a supernatural way and it reveals a supernatural God it's a supernatural book about a supernatural God who wants to read it you know say it again this is a supernatural book written about a supernatural God who has a supernatural power who wants to read it see the work of the Gospel is a supernatural work that occurs within human mortal beings so this is where we were recapping and I'm recapping today this is where we were last time in John 6 verse 39 and this is the Father's will which has which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and you remember that they came and they pushed back on that because that's quite a declaration he say he's making and and they and they pushed back and they said is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith you know I came down from heaven cuz he had said that I'm the bread that came down and and this is the Father's will which sent me that all which which of all them which he hath given me I should lose nothing but raised up in the last day and now he's speaking supernaturally from a supernatural truth they're rebutting that with carnal human reasoning you understand now what the reasoning was was not I mean it was true they did know him from a boy they did know his parents they didn't in another place they said don't we know isn't his brother Joseph and isn't his sister this one and that one and isn't he from Nazareth and then they argued over where he was born you know and so so we find out that excuse me Jesus doesn't come back and offer them a business card of who he is you know he doesn't give him you know his you know his his his WhatsApp you know he just he come he comes back to answer their objection no man can come to me you think what I said a minute ago was tough get ready no man can even come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I will raise him up in the Last Day verse 45 it is written in the prophets and they shall all be taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me so Jesus is now identifying back there under job when morning Stars sang together and sons of God shouted for joy as we were saying last time that brother brandom said the the sons of God saw the Plan of Redemption and I got so thrilled because when I thought about that I thought well if they saw a Plan of Redemption then they must have saw a redeemer and if they saw a redeemer then they saw a redeemed people and no wonder they're shouting and I'm still shouting about it today and then they kept pushing back on that again and they still kept resisting that with human reasoning he finally comes down to an end of the matter and he said in verse 65 therefore I said unto you that no man can come to me except it were given unto him of my father see you see you see what you're doing he was saying to them see what you'reall doing you're trying to I'm here telling you the secrets of eternal life I'm here telling you that all the father's giving me will come and I lose nothing I'll raise them up in the last day and you're arguing about my humanity and I'm trying to tell you that that you you've got a big problem you've got a big problem no man can come except my father draws him you understand and and so you stop using your reasoning stop trying to reason the word of God because no man can come except the Father which ha sent me draw him and I'll raise him up in the last day so stop doing that and finally when they just keep doing it and they keep offering human reasoning which Millions do then he find that it says therefore I said unto you this is why I said it no man can come to me I I get it I get why you're doing that because really the truth is no man can come to me except it were given to him of my father no man can come to me today who was not taught of my father back then I I disbelieve Satan's lie now because I disbelieved then I believe God's truth now because I believed it then I side with the Holy Ghost now because I took my stand with Michael back then so you can see a clear disconnect between the natural and spiritual mind one is mental reasoning in your head and the other is the thoughts from your heart and that's why the Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he that's the real man see people can imagine they're Christians and because they go to a church and somehow they disregard that they use profanity and take social drinks and the women cut their hair and wear makeup and dress immorally and and they can carouse and Gamble and do all these kinds of things and still imagine they're a Christian see because they're good looking wholesome people that pay their taxes and and they must be good people see and I'm not even judging them at all listen friends can I can I just say this to you I don't know if I've said it here I preached too too often to know where I said what but let me just say in case I haven't said it here and if I have maybe you need to hear it again that when when I when I when a minister or when you are trying to declare the word of God to somebody and they say as they often will stop judging me you're judging me here's what I say to them I'm not judging you I'm judging me I'm judging that the life you live I don't want that I want something more than that what you are that's between you and God God's your judge not me but I'm I'm the Bible says I am to judge myself that I be not judged amen I judge myself that I be not judged and I judge that you have a misunderstanding of Christianity that I don't want to emulate it might sound to you like I'm judging you but I'm not I'm judging me what you are is between you and God you'll answer to God for it not me he's the Arbiter and I'm glad I'm so glad so so we find then that that that there's a clear disconnect then between the natural and the spiritual mind as I've said and say again one is your mental reasoning in your head and the other is the thoughts from your heart and that's what uh the problem is that when you're born again you can think from your head but and that's your human reasoning that's not where the enmity is that's not where the enmity is I have no problem thinking what two plus two is I can think and reason in my head you understand that's not where the enmity is the enmity is in my mind and my heart a fallen nature keeps it from acknowledging God and His word when I'm not before I'm born again that you see that's the part that's hindered by being being born with a fallen nature that and consequently then that's the place that only the holy spirit of God can bring life to you amen I could convince you here I can convince you that I could preach Hellfire and brimstone and and make you afraid I could convince you that there's going to be a tribulation and you might get left behind and you don't want to face that and every bit of that could be true that still don't give you eternal life I can't give you eternal life all I can do is tell you the truth and God is the only one who can give you eternal life the holy spirit is the only one who can come down into the mind of your heart and do and annihilate that old nature and bring you to a newness and you're and you're you're you're not no longer you're no longer conformed to the world but you're transformed by the renewing of your mind not this one this one see that's why people can sit in in churches for years and be multigenerational families in a church for years and they believe it here but there's no conversion here people can set in messes churches and believe God sent a prophet and believe it was William brandom but still not be converted here so it's in your heart not your head with reasoning when when when when that mind you know when when when it's not dominated by the holy ghost from a new birth your reasoning will guide you away from the fellowship with God Amen the reasoning the reasoning in your in your heart now not not your computer the reasoning in your heart as a man thinkthin his heart see and so that's where reasoning takes place that you're free moral agent you're Body Spirit and soul you've got a soul that Soul makes you a free moral agent that Soul gives you a mind in your heart it's a nature of the spirit you understand so it's as a man thinketh in his heart the problem is you're born with a fallen nature over that Spirit it has a wrong nature it has a fallen nature and Paul said we all at one time had our conversation in the lust of the Flesh and the things of the world not because in our brain we thought this is good or bad or ugly or whatever it's because it was our desires we wanted to be sinful or at least we wanted to be not godly see and so and and the only way to be really Godly is to to come by a new birth and let the Holy Spirit come down and change that and annihilate that old nature that was not your original nature he gave me back my original Nature by a gene of God that came to life when the light of God's word Shone on it see so so so when it's not dominated when your spirit is not dominated when the mind in your heart is not dominated by the holy ghost from a new birth then reasoning will guide you away from fellowship with God even God's family friends I mean think this through with me you ready to think again even God's family born of the spirit of God himself still have to cast down vain imaginations even with a new birth see even God's family born of the spirit of God himself still have to cast down vain imaginations even we have to Die daily to this unredeemed flesh and the mind and we have to choose to believe and confess not just believe but confess from our lips everything that God's word declares I have to believe it in my heart I have to confess with my lips and I have to make my feet walk according to its statutes this unredeemed body wouldn't even come to church if you didn't make it this unredeemed body would never read your Bible and pray if if there wasn't an inside man saying I need the nourishment of the word of God and you're going to sit in this chair and you're going to feed me you're going to go to that building and you're going to I'm going to Rejoice with the people and I'm going to glorify God and I'm going to gain strength and fellowship because I I got a whole new uh vision in mind I I'm not ending here I didn't start here I'm not ending here I'm living for the next life I mean listen friends 1 Peter 4:18 if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and sinner appear I'm pretty sure you shouldn't take the Great of God lightly see because I mean if the righteous scarcely be saved if I believe all the word and confess it and live it and I'm scarcely saved where will you stand if you reason it at all God forbid you'd take it for granted just because you come to this church or believe God sent a prophet or my mom and dad and brother Jason love me you've got to work out your salvation with fear and trembling I'm sure Mom and Dad love you and I know brother Jason loves you I can tell you he does but that's not going to put you in glory as I said here a service or two ago if it was up to me I'd take all of you home with me to heaven but I can't do that I got to get me there and I've got to preach the gospel and I'm trying to get you there see so so now we come to this quote that I had been wanting to uh cover again you still good don't get nervous and get ready to close remember my title it's going to be important here in a minute opposing the Judgment of heaven and I said to you last time you think I mean when I think about it I think goodness if I'm made by God and created in His image and everybody else is too surely If Heaven rendered a judgment we'd all agree with it why is the world not do that why why is it such a small percentage of the God created humans that are willing to do that You' think that when there's any issue be it a social issue a political issue a Christ a Christian service to God issue uh any kind of an issue and God's word renders a verdict on it this is how men should act and conduct themselves this is how women should act and conduct themselves this is how teenagers should act and conduct themselves this is how preachers should act and conduct themselves this is how government should act and conduct themselves you'd think since it came from heaven from that Supernatural book You' think the whole world would go yes sir thank you we'll we'll get right on that am and yet they go in the opposite direction so now would you doubt what I'm preaching you today that it's got to take a supernatural birth you can't reason your way into eternal life if you can't reason your way into eternal life how you going to get eternal life reasoning any part of the word of God away you already can't reason yourself there if you believe every word of it it's still got to take the holy spirit that you've got to surrender to and die to see your good your goodness is no good he can't use it he can the only life God can receive is his own he's the only one holy enough to be in his own presence and that's why Jesus was no less than God in the form of a man see who lived out that life and now by faith in him we're joined back to ABRA Faith seed of Christ not the sons of Isaac not the seed of Isaac and that's brother bram's language not the seed of Isaac because all Israel is not Israel but the faith Seed of Abraham is not seeds plural as many but One Singular Christ seed behold the Christ seed see watch brother brandom now comes to Revelation 2 and20 notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest it means to tolerate that woman Jezebel my I I just want to stare at that word tolerate you should not tolerate this system am in your life in your activities in your worship it's not to be tolerated God's got a problem with people oh well I don't believe it but the problem is if you tolerate it if you allow it if you're friendly towards it notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest tolerate that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess this is obviously a church to teach and to seduce my servant to commit fornication and eat things sacrificed to Idols you say well I'm not Catholic oh awesome wonderful but but she had daughters and today there's in brother bram's day there's only 900 of them you talking about exponential growth now we have north of 33,000 of them countless Independence that's why you hear me say it's rather amusing but I mean it quite seriously when somebody tells me they disagree with the message of the hour I just say okay fine go get in line go that way go all the way to the end just hold up your flag and and let everybody know that you've got a version of The Gospel that disagrees with 32,999 and the message now with this verse I want you to drop down to verse 23 and see the proof of a great truth I've been bringing to your attention all along here's the verse and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the Reigns and hearts I have been saying right along that there are actually two churches though the spirit speaks to both of them in each age as though they were but one here here it is plainly stated that there are churches plural and it states just as plainly that some of those Church churches most evidently do not know that he is the one who searcheth the Reigns and the hearts see so they're they're using their human reasoning and they don't realize that he's searching their hearts see they think it's all about their their works and their decisions and it's not it's about whether or not they've been born again by the spirit of God that's the criteria you must be born again it's not about even correct teaching Satan don't care how right you are in your Doctrine he does not care how religious you are he knows if you fail to get that life you won't come up anyway he wins by default I don't want to let him win I don't want to see him win in me I don't want to see him win in you here it is plainly stated there are churches and it states just as plain okay uh it's most evident that they do not know that he is the one who searcheth the Reigns and hearts otherwise they would actually act and live like real Christians and not the nonsense we see today all right and we see a lot of it don't we he is going to prove to them that it is so now then now then what churches will be those that do not know this truth of course it is the false Vine group because the True Believers certainly know that judgment begins at the house of God and they being God-fearing judge themselves that they be not judged that's according to Paul now why it's a fair question it's a fair qu it's a logical this is sensible why does God call these churches his churches even though they are the false Vine the truth of the matter is that they are Christians but they are not Christians of the spirit they are Christians of the flesh they are bearing the name in vain according to Mark 7 how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men so if if if if people get offended that we identify them that way I'm only pointing out what Jesus said that's all I'm doing I'm his servant I'm just pointing out this is what he said in Mark 7:7 see so that's the danger that's the existential threat that in vain they worship him there's no greater danger no greater danger than for you to follow after that and believe that see amen but indeed they are Christians for what else could they be a muhammadan we would say more today a Muslim a muhammadan is a muhammadan that is his religion no matter how he lives no matter how he lives it because he subscribes in theory to what the Quran teaches so he's a he's a Muslim all right right in the same way a Christian is a Christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the son of God born of a virgin was crucified and died and rose again at that he is the savior of mankind Etc in fact in the leodan age there will be those who call themselves Christians because they subscribe to the Fine qualities of Jesus while reserving to themselves here comes the reasoning reserving to themselves the right to deny his deity Christian Scientists have done that already as well as multitudes who preach a social gospel amen see I mean this is why you can have a audience of 30,000 people and you never mention the cross or crucifixion or sin or anything you just have a big smile and 30,000 people will come to hear you preach a social gospel see because you tell them they're they're a good person and they need to live their best life now and I'm here to tell you this is not my best life now and there's no effort all the king's horses and all his men couldn't make this my best life I'm trying to get to my best life Hallelujah if this is my best life now I want a refund oh my if I'm in the Millennium I want my uh I want I want my money back see he is a nominal Christian and belongs to the church church but he is not a true or spiritual believer that kind of a Believer is one who has been baptized into the body of Christ and is a member of him but nonetheless it is in God's order that the tears grow up to grow up with the wheat and they are not to be uprooted that is the command of God so now this is why I'm this goes back to my title you know uh when we talk about opposing the Judgment of God this is God's decision that if you're going to be a real Christian you have to be one born of the spirit that's the that's the Judgment of Heaven you can't just be a nominal Christian you can't just subscribe to the Fine qualities of Jesus you can't just believe he was the son of God and died to save Sinners because the devil believes that you understand this is the Judgment this is the command of God don't oppose the Judgment of Heaven by continuing to believe it doesn't matter it it matters you have to be filled with the Holy Spirit you have to be changed by a supernatural power Hallelujah their day for binding and burning is coming but not yet so the spirit is speaking to this mixed group on the one hand he is praising and on the other hand he is rebuking he has has told what is right with the True Believer now he warns what the false Vine must do if it is to stand Justified before the Lord you can take that down for the mark that's what he that's the Judgment of Heaven all right you still good all right now their day of binding and burning is coming so they're being bound that's happening now is they're being Bound for the burning that's what the whole that's ecumenicalism we're all one and they're all trying to homogenize everything into one and they're disregarding the true New Birth of the spirit of God this is one of the things that you know that has caused easy believism to be believed and even encroaches into message pulpits so I'm shocked to say and and we we've lost the sense of the oldfashioned bapt ISM of the Holy Ghost don't ever lose that Beth Tabernacle don't ever lose that sense of the oldfashioned are you willing to be oldfashioned and have an oldfashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire see so the the and and and one of the things that has contributed to that believe it or not was the two Messengers that went to Sodom and now that's scriptural because if you'll notice what the two Messengers that went to Sodom did is they blinded the people they didn't convert them they blinded them so that they actually couldn't find their way to safety and perished you understand Billy Graham's hour of decision program one of the certainly one of Christian radio's most beloved and long lasting my goodness it went almost three4 of a century uh one of the most long lasting and loved uh programs um for 74 75 years something like that Billy Graham when he began it he didn't want to do it and they said brother you know they said we will brother Billy we will we'll make sure that the funding is there and he said oh well if you can get the funding and he he admits that he said it just jokingly and then they show up to him we've got the funding and he was stunned and he got back to his hotel room that night this is this is his own words stunned I bowed my head and said in silent prayer said Graham emotions so overcame me that I could not think straight clearly the funds had come from God the team soon signed with ABC and the first broadcast was live from the Billy Graham crusade in Atlanta Georgia on November the 5th 1950 now Billy Graham had a conundrum and brother brandham caught it listening to him preach live and he was he was upgrading the Ministerial Association they were at a Minister's breakfast and Billy was upgrading the the ministers for not doing their job and the evidence was his evidence misguided took a prophet to know what the real problem was but his his accusation against the ministry Association was that I come into a city and I get 30,000 converts to Christ I get what he said was I get 30,000 decisions for Christ and I come back a year later and I can't find 30 and brother brandham said oh I was just sitting there burning so bad he said I wanted to say to him he said not that I count myself like that highly esteemed man he said but I just wanted to say to him Dr Graham you know to what what happened to Paul when he went in and 130 and come back and there's hundreds he said because you don't take them all the way to the Holy Ghost all you do is tell them to make a decision and that's why you don't take them all the way into the new birth and that's what a prophet of the age was trying to so that we don't fall victim to that you understand so it was Graham's conundrum where 30,000 would go down to 30 and late in in 1953 the Southern Baptist convention and I had to go to the bigram website and Wikipedi in different things and run some research on this to make sure I had all the facts straight but in 1953 the SBC or the Southern Baptist convention they came up with a new slogan to kick off a renewed campaign for evangelism and it was called a million more and 54 now I know we say million more and 44 and that's because brother Brandon inverted that he actually the first time he ever said it that was that was it you know that was late in 53 in the spring of 54 brother brandham said what's all this a million more than 54 so when he first heard it he said it right and then other times he would he would say a million more in and 44 I mean 54 and then another place I found him he said a million more in 34 44 54 something like that and then after that he just got stuck on 44 million more than 44 and he said that for years all the way through to the end of his life but it was actually in 1954 which is how he first said it which was the accurate uh rendering and so in in late 53 they came up with this new slogan a million more in 54 and though it was not a direct Ministry initiative of the Billy Graham uh evangelism uh Evangelistic ministry Billy Graham actually is credited for playing a very significant supporting role to that Southern Baptist convention slogan because the aim of the SBC was to actually add 1 million members to their churches in 1954 through increased evangelism and Outreach and they went door too in many communities didn't matter what kind they got in they just wanted a number see that's what brother Brandon was so critical of you would never say William Brandon was criticizing evangelism my goodness the man evangelized seven times around the world but he was critical of the fact that you're not you're just getting decisions you're not getting people you get you get you get as brother brandham said they are Christians naturally speaking but that's not a spiritual believer see and so Graham's widely known the article goes on to say his widely known Evangelistic Crusades influenced and helped or uh energized that campaign indirectly but I I I thought to myself the that campaign didn't solve the conundrum it didn't fix the conundrum the I I if the new birth listen friends if the new birth was the product of a human mental achievement by a natural decision that you could make then then making a decision for Christ is all you'd need you see and so but and and Billy Graham wouldn't have had the the issue of people falling away from 30,000 to 30 if all it took was a mental decision then that's all you need to do and they wouldn't have lost you know 29,000 and some odd so the mystery of redemption was that's why it was not given to Billy Graham as great man as he was and I believe he was a saint of God and I believe he'll be in heaven but he was not the seventh angel given the mystery of redemption God had something better for you and I Hallelujah friends and that's what we've come down to today God has shown us the true way the straight and narrow way the full way and now now you say but I but I'm a free moral agent can I just put this thought in your head and I'm GNA let you go home with this one today you're free moral agent but if you're not born again then you're limited in your free moral agency because you actually if you're not born again can't choose to live pleasing to God understand you can't even choose to believe the whole word you can't make a decision to that so now where's your freedom Now where's your freedom moral agency the only time a human being is actually fully free moral agent is when he's been transformed by the renewing of his mind and now he can actually be free to become everything God ever Envision now I have freedom I'm under the law of Liberty stand with me friend stand with me I how many want to be under the law of Liberty today not a not a man-made law not a regul book not a not uh plans and spec sheet it's not about that he's not trying to build me that way I'm Lively Stones you're built up in the power of God by the word through the Holy Spirit by becoming a believer of every word of God this is what makes you a free moral agent so the argument that people walk away from the word and say now I'm free that's the exact opposite is true now they're not free to be in the image of God you see the only way that you are totally a free moral agent is when you have been converted by the baptism of the holy spirit amen praise the Lord there's more I would love to say but we'll stop there for today told you I wasn't going to preach long amen praise the Lord you love the Lord I hope that the holy spirit is satisfied with with your response to the word today and uh here on and online and anyone associated with bethl Tabernacle I hope that the holy spirit is satisfied with your heart's response but I've been satisfied with this material so if I have will inform me that he's still not satisfied with your willingness to accept it and to believe it and to cast down this easy believism nonsense that it doesn't matter and that we're all one we're not we're not we're not that's not true we are A peculiar people called of God to be an example in the world that the world is prophesied not to follow but but God honors it amen amen let's pray Lord we thank you today for your word I thank you that I was able Lord to stay on track and stay on target and I must say that I feel satisfied that I was Lord

near and far help us to have it help our young people to understand this Lord they must see you they we that that was what the living creature said and John said when he had opened this seal and I
