back amen his dad when i was a kid at the branham tabernacle his dad was a song leader there amen so uh we've got a we know a lot of the same people have a lot of the same history there amen so happy to have him here with us this evening amen praise the lord happy to see brother john and dr meredith back safe and sound praise lord we're going to pray for your car sister meredith amen i'm gonna pray for the lord to fix that car i've laid hands on a car before that wouldn't run and it cranked immediately and ran i blew an engine in the truck one time laid hands on it prayed for it drove it home from tennessee and drove it for another year sold it and the man is still driving it amen so i know that god god can move amen on vehicles praise the lord so back in the day you know jeffy prayed for his horse john wesley horse broke his leg you know what you do when they break a leg you just go on and shoot them john wesley didn't shoot his horse he prayed for him finished riding the horse for years so i don't have a horse i have a car i have a truck amen sometimes i have to pray for him but we're happy in the lord tonight we're going to invite you right into the scriptures back to revelation chapter 10 we want to continue tonight but the matt was actually scheduled to preach but he's under the weather enemy attacking there's some kind of a head cold going around and different ones and he was pretty sick this afternoon so we're just trusting the lord got a number of people sick amen out tonight and want the lord to touch him we'll get to those prayer requests just in the next little bit here praise the lord we're continuing by the help of the lord in our series on the coming of the lord this would be part three i'm pretty sure that's going to be correct guys should be part 3 of the coming of the lord all right i want to read from revelation 10 8 to 11. i don't know if i sent that to you brother josh i apologize if i didn't amen i put it on my nose but i don't remember sending it to you revelation 10 verses 8 to 11. and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is in the which is open that's a big point in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went into the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must i'm not hoping you will not you really should thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings so you know a prophet went home more than a half a century ago why are we still here because once he went home and the bride became the final voice to the final age there was many people and nations and tongues and kings that she had to prophesy to so it's taken us this long to find all of god's family all the lord has it in his sovereign control doesn't he amen so let's uh let's pray father we want to thank you tonight lord for your great grace and your great mercy to us lord in this hour and father we have read your word but now lord we need you uh the divine one lord to give us divine inspiration upon the word that you brought to us we committed into your hands lord in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated make a quick adjustment here amen praise the lord now i'm i'm i um i want to by the help of the lord to carry on in this thought and you might wonder i suppose it would be fair of you to wonder wow you're going to take a sermon like this for a wednesday night well when i get going you'll understand why because it's actually going to be a perfect service for a wednesday because you know this gives us some time where things sir where we can really kind of get down and and preach into our hearts tonight and and and you know what what is a real burden we're not trying to teach a subject to tonight like we were on sunday and like we will again the lord willing coming this coming sunday when we take the fourth part don't know if that'll finish it kind of got my doubts but i sure am enjoying studying and i'm enjoying ministering and i hope it's a benefit for you but tonight i want to take a particular angle and fact is i i want to really uh strike uh right away and i want to use some some words that are not weighty words but they're very direct words and they're going to convey what i really want you to grab a hold of right out of the gate and and that is that i want to say that what we're going to speak on tonight is aiming at a not just an angle and purpose of this coming in revelation 10 but it's actually a major angle and i i i almost can't over emphasize that you just take my word for it this is what what what we're really trying to get to i was trying to get to it sunday i don't feel i did a very good job i'm going deeper into it tonight we want to go into it even further next sunday this coming but this is a major angle and purpose of this coming now you can say well the the 10th chapter of revelation uh you know uh told us about how that christ would come with an open book and we'd have a prophet and and he would come and we'd get the open book and and you know we would we'd eat on that book and that's all absolutely true but to what end what's the purpose of it why did god do that we automatically know god doesn't do things to entertain us he doesn't do things that don't have a divine purpose behind it and while there are many angles that we can take and we have taken we talked in part one we showed you the symbolism and that was an important part to get you to understand that in the symbology of that angel with a rainbow over his head and fetus pillars of fire remember face like the sun in a it came as a living cloud you remember that that we showed by the scripture that that was that that was symbolic of christ in the bride that and we don't have time we're not going to go back over all that tonight but we've preached that steady the last two parts showing that that this coming is christ in you you've got to remember something friends and here's another big point the world today in christianity the world over 99.9 and that's a conservative uh guesstimate not maybe more than that but 99.9 of christianity when you when you talk about the coming of the lord they are thinking about the nail scarred man they're thinking about the man with nail scars and a side and and and a brow where thorns had been but they don't see that version of jesus until revelation 19. the only version of jesus that the world sees before the tribulation is in you that's why brother branham called this coming a bride coming of christ because it's now christ coming to tabernacle himself in his bride by a token with a jubilee returning the abstract bringing us now in visibly uniting us to our groom and therefore this was necessary because remember the church ceased being the mouthpiece of god but god has never been without a witness and when the church forfeited their rights to be his mouthpiece he called a bride out of that church that church is now her own mouthpiece she's full of creeds and dead but he has a living bride amen that's why it came as a living cloud so i had a rainbow that's why it was pillars of fire that's why his face shone like the sun oh my goodness friends this this is the this is the the coming that he has waited to do since the days of pentecost in the upper room remember he couldn't come that way like like uh to to and to take them into a body change because they backslid and as we've said before when they backslid instead of christ being able to come and take a bride he has to sit back down in the eternities intercede for ignorance for two thousand years put seven seals on the word of god that that word was never uns it was never sealed to paul everything that we have unsealed came from paul and so we find that this was the time when he would open up the seven seals would and he's literally opening up the lamb's book of life but to do what to what end what's the main purpose to to convert you into him see so you've got to you when you say to somebody oh the coming of the lord they automatically think of the time when the christian church goes home but there's all kinds of examples of coming of the lord all kinds of examples when he met abraham uh or from the slaughter of the kings that was a coming of the lord when he came to the tents in the plains of mamrie that was a coming of the lord when he met moses all down through the bible these are comings of the lord when he came in the upper room it was a coming of the lord yes i will brother matt tested negative for covet so don't anybody worry amen amen praise the lord he tested negative so we're happy for that it's just a kind of common head cold going around i think i had it myself and still got my voice a little bit ready but we're gonna get through it anyway so so we're we're looking now at this particular coming when he came in his earthly incarnation that was mr jesus when he came that was the that was the christian era we're not in the christian era now that was when jesus the christ was on the earth that was the christian christ era we are in the holy ghost era see it's the same god not a different person but now it's that god tabernacled in his body so now there's a mrs jesus christ because he's got to come in this day and restore like the the first adam fell and the sec first at first he fell well when the second adam came and restored adam there also had to be a restoration of eve so we find then that this major angle and purpose of this coming and i got to get moving a major angle and purpose of this coming in revelation 10 which is underway right now the coming of the lord is underway you're in it it's happening in real time this this major angle and purpose of this coming is to have the entire planted field come to maturity just like the wave sheath came to maturity in our day and a prophet came and reached a perfection to where god had enough confidence in him to put the words of cr the power of creation in his mouth i'm here to tell you something friends that has to come on the entire field see now satan has done a marvelous job at distracting us from that by by by trying to get people to that are so enamored with the prophet himself i get it he was a great man fulfilled his destiny finished his job went home to his reward but satan has got people so enamored with that vessel that they never come to realize this coming is more about you than it was him his ministry occupied a single verse you've got four or five verses you're here my brother my sister you have arrived you're you are you're not only in you are the coming of the lord oh hallelujah you are the coming of the lord it only climaxes in a body change the coming of the lord is in you and it's happening so he he unsealed the lamb's book of life he sent down the word of god into your hearts that you might be able to overcome the world when he was mr jesus on earth he said i have overcome the world said in the world you'll have tribulation be of good cheer i've overcome the world see now it's time for his bride mrs jesus to realize the same thing that's what revelation 10 is all about when he was mr jesus on the earth in his earthly incarnation he said satan cometh and findeth nothing in me this was a this was a a a a a man remember jesus was not half man half god he was a hundred percent a human man he was also a hundred percent the very god this is why brother branham said he was he was he was god plus you see he was the god man see and so so we because he he was the prototype he was a he was the beginning of the creation of god he was a brand new kind of a human that god was going to fill up his entire kingdom with by the giving you the same life that was lived in him and giving you word bodies that are in a perfect condition this is what revelation 10 is about he says satan cometh and findeth nothing in me the absence of anything contrary anything contrary to the word of god no fear no anxiety no weaknesses no doubts of the mind he found in jesus a man fully committed to the father and this time he comes in revelation 10 to accomplish the same thing in you and i want you to catch this before you leave here i can't emphasize that strong enough i'm here to tell you we are going home in victory the bride isn't going to stumble over the finish line she's marching to the step of the gospel she has complete victories say i don't feel like i got victory it's coming he's doing more in you than you're aware of and he'll do whatever's necessary to get you there that's very soon he's working it out in us now he's doing more in you let me give you some courage he's doing more in your kids than you're aware of he's doing more in your loved ones than you're aware of he's doing more in this church than you're aware of god is busy hallelujah oh my you remember i said that friends you remember i said that that he has come in this coming when when satan came to him he found nothing in him no fear no anxiety no failures no weaknesses no nothing he was a man fully surrendered to the will of the father and i'm here to tell you before the when he comes as mrs jesus christ he's coming to accomplish that same thing in you hallelujah the falling apart of the world is setting us in the mindset that we need to have i can tell you right now events are happening in the world as she nears her end that will require this of us it's going to require a faith brother branham talks about that that that it where it's going to be necessary and i i am becoming more and more convinced of this as we go along and i see the condition of the world and i'm not here tonight to preach on world events but they're shaking the troublesome times are here filling men's hearts with fear oh my scriptural prophecy is too clear on this point folks brother branham was too clear i got the number of quotes i'm going to read for you tonight but the prophet goes back to the scriptures over and over and over again proving this point that that even in his day he could see things coming he he talks about a faith that we're going to need a perfect faith why is he preaching it he said because you're going to need it he could see it coming see and so so we find here let me let me read you just a few of his statements here now i'll interchange with comments as i go i've got these chronological 1956 now this is the last year of mercy for america brother branham said he sees the condition that pentecost has come to 50 years after their great when the revival hit on azusa and and and they i mean they they literally called the fire department out because people witnesses on the street said the building is engulfed in flames i've read that newspaper article that's a true story that's a true story they thought that building witnesses on the street said my goodness called the fire department they thought it was engulfed when they got there it was on fire all right not that kind of fire but what they had become in 50 years brother branham warned them even during these times he said if pentecost stays on this trajectory that's not the word he used but i think he said if she keeps going the way she's going he said in another 50 years she'll be worse than the catholic church and i i have to say sometimes when i look at some of the things uh maybe on youtube that are represented as christianity and supposed to be singing and charismatic movements and pentecostal i'm here to tell you give me a catholic mass any day of the week at least i don't feel like vomiting for what they pass off as christianity it is vulgar it is horrible it is it is almost indescribably wicked to me and and at least you you get a good catholic at least they're humble and they're solemn and they come into the presence of god i i'm not here at let me get going on that amen buddy but we've seen it come to pass brother branham is warning them now at their jubilee this is 1956 50-year jubilee for them they had asked him to hold a series of meetings here's one of his sermons what we need is not pentecost but the god of pentecost you're coming to the jordan men and women see now that has a broad application i mean we're coming to the jordan in death all of us all of us are going to meet it except those who are alive and remain at the moment we're changed there's also brother branham said i he when he saw looking between the second and third pool and he saw himself coming toward the jordan and he said i realized i was two-thirds of the way and so now the third pole was the most important part because that was the mamba that one strike he said one strike would kill a man and it tried to get to brother branham but it couldn't get him and he had power over it had power to bind it i bind you in the name of jesus christ and he said it rolled up and turned crystal and he said the the the voice said you have power to lose him also and he said well let me test it i lose you in the name of jesus christ and immediately the smoke the blue smoke came back in it it reanimated again and quickly brother branham said quickly i said i bind you in the name of jesus christ i'm glad he left it bound that's the last thing on tape the last thing on tape a prophet bound him so don't worry hallelujah you're believing a message that has authority over the over the great mamba you have authority and the time of the third pull you have authority now that we're about to cross over he says you're coming to jordan men and women each one of you is coming down to the jordan this is at the 50-year jubilee and this is the last year america will ever have mercy as a nation he says you're coming down to the jordan i don't know when that may be it may be before daylight for some of us but i tell you there's coming a time that when you're going to need more than an old moth eaten robe of some church you're there's coming a time you're going to need the god that set that church of fire in its early days here's a prophet looking forward in time could see by the bible what was happening and he knew he knew and he pleaded with them and warned them if you keep sowing to denominationalism when the latter rain comes that's all the harvest you'll have you can only reap what you've sown and that's why a prophet showed a field with the word of god and so when the mighty god opened the seals then the latter rain began to bring forth believers it began to bring forth miss his jesus christ why because that's the seed that was sown he sowed for the word they sowed for denominations he says you're going to need there's coming a time you're going to have to have the vision that they had in the early days that wore this the new school has come in and the holes has been eaten in and the doubts and superstitions and theologies and things till the thing is no good at all call for the god of pentecost that's what we need today i'd like to say to bethel tabernacle call for the god of pentecost because that day he's talking about this day it's this day you're here you're living in this quote says the servant of god has to call on god he has to depend on god not his church not his robe he has to depend on god god's asking him to do the impossible in order to do the impossible you've got to call on god for power of god to perform the impossible i'm here to tell you something friends we are living in the hour of impossibility you're living in an impossible day with darkness over the whole earth gross darkness on the minds of people the church no longer the mouthpiece satan's eden he's the god of this evil age he controls the pulpits the educational centers all the politics all the courts he controls society he controls all the entertainment you're living in a day when it's quite impossible for you to be an overcomer but revelation 10 came and a mighty angel came and the lamb opened the lamb's book of life he moves on in 1962 wisdom versus faith now what are we doing what are we trying to do this morning follow what the lord said brother branham he says lay up food brother batman had that that vision where you know he he's he's got a like a like a seller and he said i was just ordering said you need to store up food for the people he said i was just ordering radishes and and all kinds of vegetables and piling them in there and just piling this cellar full and he and so now he comes here later and in this sermon catch it wisdom versus faith man's wisdom versus faith see now what are we doing trying to do this morning follow what the lord said lay up food you're going to need it amen one of these days you think the prophet didn't think it was good for that day of course he did but under inspiration of the holy spirit you've got a prophet saying we're storing up food you're going to need it one of these days he moves on to 63 in conferences he says oh brother i wish i had a little more time the time is coming catch it now this is a prophet prophet speaking the time is coming when you're either going to put your organization into the world council of churches and if you do that you take the image of the beast uh if you do that you take the image of the beast because you've got a power watch this now listen this language because you've got a power just like it was in rome see remember we showed you in in revelation 10 i think verse 3 where he comes down and he puts one foot on the land and one foot on the seat raises his hand and swears by him that liveth forever the delay is over i'm not holding back the full word anymore i'm going to release it all say call for my queen to stand by my side and we showed you that the foot on the land and the sea meant showed that that christ in his church whether it was the old rome that came up out of the sea in the book of revelation or whether it was the or whether it was a repackaged rome that came up out of the land in revelation 13 it was all the same antichrist spirit it was old roman new rome but they're under our feet revelation 10 put rome under your feet amen and so he says so he says see you're going to have to take and join this world council of churches and when you do that you take the image you're going to get the mark of the beast he's referring to and he says and if you don't do it you'll be an individual independent church and when you do the image of the beast is going to close your doors and you're going to be forbidden and then you're going to need a conference it's in this message conferences with god i love that statement out of conferences i say it often times you probably if you've ever been here and had brother jason come down to pray for you you probably hear me because i want you to hear a prophet's words to that a prophet said as a son and daughter of god you have a right to a conference with god it is your inalienable right that means you don't need to ask anybody's permission and nobody can take it from you the devil has no authority to stop it you have a divine right when you get in trouble you have a divine right to have a conference with god and god will attend think about that tonight think of the privilege that you're enjoying you have a right to call jesus on the scene and because you're his child and you're exercising your rights that he gave you it's like in the bible that he gives you a faith and then turns around and gives you a blessing for having the faith he gave you oh my my so he says when all of this happens they'll close your doors you're going to be forbidden and then you're going to need a conference with god now all right so i'm not i'm not trying to suggest that we're going to have the the thing the foolish virgin has in the tribulation period we miss that brother brown is very clear the bride doesn't go into the tribulation period but but but listen it doesn't it's not going to have to wait to the tribulation period the government that we currently have even with our current constitution here in all through north america have already been closing churches and they've been arresting pastors who defy that order this isn't ah this isn't conspiracy theory it's in the headlines be glad you live in south carolina we do things a little different here amen if you ever get scared brother paul does come here because amen we do things a little different here amen amen more more battles i found out more battles took place in the revolutionary war in south carolina than any other colony that's right amen we had the swamp fox and he really gave them grief and so amen so we we we tend to fight a lot [Laughter] uh so but but we find that they're already closing doors and and all it is is a is a an illness pandemic over nothing more than that pastors are going to jail over nothing more than a global pandemic of illness closing doors so so i'm and listen friends we you already know we have the rome part so why why would you put all of this over i'm here to tell you we're at the moment when the bride is ready to go home i'm here to tell you some friends we've already got that roman system she's already been in power brother branham identified it when john kennedy was elected oh my soul so don't don't be asleep at the switch and think oh time is just life is just going to go on and on and on it it i i could say it won't but you could doubt that so let me change it it can't not if you believe this it can't just keep going all the signs have have elapsed now and so we're we're right at it and we're even starting to see you know uh we don't i don't like to use the term pre-tribulation judgments but i'm gonna here to tell you we see some really amazing things that over the last three years come on we've seen some things i just thought would never happen in this nation not in my lifetime i thought my goodness what is what is happening to the world and now they're starting again it's coming back around again they're starting to lock down borders and starting and we're go we're going to get another pandemic we're gonna you can just watch friends just like i stood here two years ago when this all started and i said listen don't live in fear whatever you do because i'll promise you this there'll be five behind this one and ten behind that one and you've seen it i didn't need to be a prophet to say that that i just now you can see prophecy and knew it would have to be that way now he moves on later in 63 near the end of the year he that is in you i got to hurry wow i gotta hurry man oh no wait i'm good okay that clock is the devil get that thing off the wall by luther and wow amen i know what happened to brother matt on sunday school wow uh oh wait a minute am i standing upside down okay you're right luther it's right never mind i'm sorry clock amen amen so he says he he that is in you you want him to be in you he says about this message this morning now i want everyone to thoroughly understand now i am trusting to god now oh i know i know why i have this quote here this this is the evening sermon behind the morning sermon of souls in prison now amen and when brother branham preached souls in prison he really i'm here to tell you friends it is uh you want a tape that moves you that tape will put you on on edge because because now now granted granted granted that brother branham was showing in the scripture how that when he takes and claims the book mercy's over and everything and and over the years over 50 years as ministry we've matured to understand no mercy still going because it's got to go into the last name it's called but i'm here to tell you back there in in in november the 10th that morning no one knew that and even brother branham himself wasn't sure he said i hope it's not over see he said but i don't know in the scripture he says it looks an awful lot like it could be and i mean it was panic people were i mean people were pay you could hear women and men both screaming out because it looked even brother bradham got quite excited near the end of it but he come but now here here here's a here's a big point that he comes that evening and he that is in you and he says now about the message this morning now i want everyone to thoroughly understand now i'm trusting to god that it isn't that time meaning when mercy's over he says see i'm trusting to god that it isn't that time but the message is truth see the message is true it will be some time if it isn't that time it's coming a time where souls in prison is all we'll be preaching to that's part of the third poll and that comes right and we don't say well how will we know when that we might not know there might not be anything to uh indicate to us but we might be in full steam all of our missionary programs running still all of our preachers preaching still all of our services being held still all over the world in all kinds of nations and we might go for a little while and and suddenly uh maybe it might dawn on us that no one is coming to it anymore and and and i'm gonna tell you something that's that's that's the last of the last events that was what jesus did preach to souls in prison just before his resurrection and brother branham says well it may not be now but he says it will be sometime if it isn't that time and it looks so much like the time till i felt like paul of old who said i haven't shunned to declare to you the whole council see that's why brother branham did it you know people could say man you're a sensationless william brandon all you did was get the people all screaming and women passing out and people running to the altar and uh but brother branham said i i'm felt like paul i haven't shunned to declare the whole council of god but brother brandon made it clear i don't know that it is i don't know he kept saying that i don't know but it looks like it could be i hope it's not he says then he comes in 1965 in the god of this evil age and he he says here he says and then to bring down excuse me i'm sorry this court is bothering me i don't have a clip for the back part of it he says and then to bring down to a message that i think is so vital i feel that we ought to everyone this is this is 65 that everyone be comfortable and seated so we can listen with our pencils and our papers and notes and bible and so forth to take down the notes now he's preaching the god of this evil age see and he says but this way i thought i would go back on the time that we have that we're living in and try to bring some of these things that you're going to meet you're going to to need them so here comes a prophet near the end of his ministry and he says now today i got an important topic the god of this evil age he's got to warn the church he's got to warn the true believers that that when they when they meet in their big crystal cathedrals and they sing their songs and they think they're worshiping god they're actually not they're worshiping satan and they don't know it now people impugned him terribly for that said who do you think you are 7th grade hillbilly what kind of kind of jurisdiction you know who gave you a mandate to declare we're worshiping satan well all he was doing was quoting the bible because when you go back into the old testament that's why god built a tabernacle and said now there was a time there was a time when you just put your sacrifices anywhere out there in the field or wherever you were he says but now you're going to have to bring your sacrifice to the door and he says and and and the question becomes well why do we got to do that and god's answer was i'm going to keep you from worshiping devils the door was christ so if you're going to bring your repentance if you're going to bring your worship if you're going to bring your obedience whatever you're going to bring your your your your loyalty to god your confession to god you've got to bring it to the word and if you don't bring it to the word you're worshiping devils now how important is revelation 10. see because now the time was over god would not wink at that any longer now you're back to acts 17. god's not going to wink at that any longer he's going to require all men to now repent you've got to receive the holy ghost you've got to receive the bleeding word that's the only path to atonement see and so he says i want to speak about this in the day we're living in and try to bring some of these things that you're going to meet listen friends you're meeting them we're living in an hour where that reality of worshiping the god of this evil age is everywhere it's rampant all around the world the whole world is sodom and gomorrah and the days of noah worse we're 50 years worse than the days of noah 50 years we're a half century brother branham was identifying luke 17 30 a half century ago was fulfilled i'm here to tell you something friends that are beating down the door and the two messengers have already struck them with blindness oh abraham's already had a conference with melchizedek hallelujah fire's about to rain from the sky and and and as soon as the two messengers went off the scene the fire fell i'm here to tell you billy graham and oral roberts are gone [Music] this ain't no joke you have arrived we are at the moment oh glory hallelujah we are at the moment friends the thing we've waited for our whole life the thing i've believed and looked for since a boy is upon us you're going to meet these things and you're going to need them you're going to need these things i'm going to teach on he said i hope you got your bibles and notebooks and pencils he said i'm going to preach on this and you're you're going to meet these things that i'm preaching on you're going to need this ammo you're going to get to an age where brother brandon would say you know you know he might not come i don't know i hope i'm here i may not be he said maybe i'm building a platform for someone else he was you you me all of us hallelujah [Applause] so part of his coming is to produce mrs jesus christ a people of divine communion with god think about the ability and the privilege that you have you have a divine communion with christ oh my when when you have this kind of communion here to tell you something friends the mighty angel descended to give you this communion to give you this level of fellowship because this is the fellowship we're going to need we're going to need to have this sense to where we we reach a point i'm here to tell you you've arrived at a time where you can't be asleep at the switch your family's too vital the church is too vital satan can slip in quickly and easily this is the time to really i'm going to tell you check up this is the time when and i'm here to tell you that god opened the lamb's book of life to do what to give you a sense that you can sense evil in any situation where the devil you you can't even be deceived by his lurking and his presence he comes in and looks innocent but you'll know him immediately why because you have been invited into this communion with a divine being you have a sense where you can sense evil in any situation not only since it doesn't do you much good just to sense it but you can actually take it under your control for the glory of god this bride is commissioned to say now i take every spirit in here under my control for the glory of god hallelujah fathers do that over their children wives do it over their husbands listen sisters don't underestimate your authority as a daughter of god holy ghost field your man is out there working rubbing evil spirits comes in all contaminated when he walks in the door you just need to whisper a prayer i take every spirit under my control for the glory of god wash his mind wash him clean hallelujah bring your children in put your arms around and whisper a prayer cast out demons away from them hallelujah this is real friends this is why revelation 10 came this is what this coming was sent to accomplish [Music] to make a divine force flowing we have a divine nature by the new birth but there's got to be a divine force flowing from that divine nature it's a it's a it's not a passive it's it's an active perfect faith is not passive perfect faith is active it's the it's a substance see and so it it has to flow through the believer and and this is exactly what makes the believer ah uh you know equal to any situation amen i want you to know something tonight you're more than a match for the devil through christ through christ see he's not afraid of how religious you are he's not afraid of how right you are in your doctrine what he fears is the life what he fears is you'll have that divine communion that you'll make time in your life and your schedule to realize that your main purpose in being here as a human being as a mortal is to let the divine flow go through your divine nature and send out divine power hallelujah you'll sense every evil he'll walk in and have an authority to speak to that thing you're able to confront and gain victory over any challenge satan can muster i want to say it again you are you're authorized you are empowered hallelujah do you believe it that's what revelation 10 did when you ate the book you became an authorized representative with full authority to take every power that satan has amen john in first john we don't i won't you don't need to turn i'll just read a couple of verses here and scatter them around don't try to follow me get lost in the shuffle but in this fourth chapter of first john he tells us how to deal with these evil powers with these evil voices with these evil influences in our lives and our homes and our families and in our churches evil's everywhere but we're not unequipped see and so you know it's it's it's everything that contacts our lives our homes our families our church our job our schools wherever we go evil is lurking you're going to contact this world god put you here on purpose see he even even said i send you out as sheep among wolves see you're going to face many things but don't worry i've overcome the world in me you shall have peace see not as the world gives not that kind of peace not because you've got a big bank account and plenty of friends on social media because as soon as you lose that bank account those friends you don't have peace anymore see and and if you're and if you're rich and you're you're you're you're number one on social media and you got a millions of dollars you say i got peace i can kind of understand that you ain't much to worry about you got people they'll do things for you got money you burn and uh but but but what about when you don't have any money and you don't have any friends and you're sick and body and everything's coming up wrong i'm here to tell you that's what the world doesn't understand you have a peace that passes understanding no one can understand how do you stay so calm in this kind of a storm oh my i'm sheltered safe if they only knew i have a divine communion that revelation 10 the mighty angel came he opened the lamb's book of life and gave me shalom john says ye are of god little children and have overcome them because why greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world that says a number of things there is a he in the world there is a he in you and the one in you is greater than the one in the world that's not a cliche that's that means there's a person out there trying to take your life trying to poison you trying to destroy you but there's another he there's a greater he that's inside of you than the he that you confront in the world that's why he says try the spirits whether they be of god for many false prophets are going into the world our fellowship with the lord fills us with power to dethrone them try the spirits whether they be whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world i'm here to tell you our fellowship with the lord fills us with power to dethrone them they want to have influence over your kids you have power to dethrone that you have an ability to identify them no matter where they hide and you have an ability a god-given privilege to take authority over them i'm here to tell you some friends that's that's a main angle of revelation 10. amen do you see now why i said let me get preaching you'll understand why i took this on a wednesday night i'm here to tell you this is where we live this is what puts spiritual meat on your bones just want to give you victory because revelation 10 came to give us victory hallelujah and it shows us it shows us how that we may live in the world and not be subject to fear not be subject to bondage not be subject to pain i'm here to tell you the devil wants to put you in subjection to every one of those he'll put every kind of pain and every kind of fear and every kind of anxiety and every kind of stress and every kind of bondage but we've arrived at a time and a place where we are here to defeat all evil powers and take rulership over them you need to take rulership over fear rulership over bondage don't be in bondage be free this is what revelation 10 gave us we are we are here eating on the word of god to reign by to reign by the life of christ and reign in complete victory in this way we will be this is the way friends that we are coming to and god is doing it and and i'm going to tell you something we're going to know it we're going to know it we're knowing it more and more every day that we are from above and god is making that more real and more real and more real that you are not from here you are from above hallelujah you're here for a purpose and when that that's to glorify god and when that purpose is over i get recalled back to where i started hallelujah we're not here to be subject to the world we're here to reign over the world we're here to bring genesis 1 26 have dominion amen where do you where where would you pl where would you place fear and anxiety and bondage and and have dominion see and so so then you have to understand the devil's tactic his whole thing to give you fear and anxiety and pain and bondage is not just because he's uh a nasty evil wicked person he is all of that but the whole that's all to keep you from having dominion that's that's all it is it's it's his only way to stop you from taking part of what god has for you in this hour see and so and so in this revelation 10 coming of christ he has come down in the form of his family he's come in the form of the living word to literally vanquish and overcome all of the power of satan's eden do you believe that he's come down in the form of the word in his family to vanquish the power of satan's eden god allowed him to have his own eden and then gives his bride and authority to have dominion over him that's what the invisible union accomplished the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride has destroyed his power over god's family the invisible unit next time you hear that tape make it tomorrow that's a gooden the next time you hear the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride you just remember what that he he's brought this about to destroy the power of satan over god's family see it actually has a real effect on us it's not just it's not just information it's not just theology it's not just something that's sweet in our mouth it can get down in our belly and it's bitter because you gotta you gotta you gotta make it become something but as i said to you last sunday whether it's sweet in your mouth or bitter in your belly one should not be harder than the other or easier than the other if it all depends on where your fellowship is with christ see and so we i don't want to get back to sunday's material i just start preaching all over again but but we find that that this power even the power of death even the power of death is under your feet the bible proves that to you i mean could satan do you think he'll have any do you think satan will have any chance to convince you that he has power over your body when you get a body change you'd think he wouldn't stop that if he could stop if he had power over your body i promise you that's the one he'd let you have the one most wonderful life in the world he can stop that one the very fact that we which are alive and remain shall be changed we're going to be caught up in a moment and a twinkling of an eye that proves that god has given us power over our bodies even over death itself because that power that was released by the opening of the seventh seal is here now it came to translate our bodies came to changes the only way satan listen don't be afraid of him they only say people have died the only way satan can remove any one of god's children from the earth is with god's permission and it's either their time was up or god has some other sovereign purpose in it but satan until god is finished with you you're immortal now if he can't kill you he sure can't stop you why do you let him convince you he can i'm here to tell you the mighty angel came with an open book to tell you he can't stop you if you'll take it and have fellowship and enter into that divine communion with god you'll have more power than satan has ever imagined possible not power for the sake of power it's humility that's where real power is see what will hinder us brother jason this is great i love it i'm sold i'll take 10. what's the catch is there anything that can hinder it our human nature will if you let it there you go your human nature will if you let it god's work in us will be hindered when the human will is not wholly surrendered it might get a little quiet now see now i'm really coming down to my wednesday night crocs this this this is the burden and can i say this this is not the burden on my heart just for you y'all just y'all just gathered here helping me eat the meal god has set before me because this is this is a meal god set before me and i just said lord you know we need the god of elijah we need the god of pentecost we we we see the world falling apart we see all of these things we see pandemics we see fear we see anxiety we see evil we see wickedness everywhere and our our young people are battling it 50 times harder than we ever had it what's the answer lord and the lord begin to say there's power i brought power with me i brought an open book i opened the lamb's book of life there's not a more potent book in existence i brought the mighty god i unveiled him how much more power do you want what more can he do as brother brooks sings what more can he do see but what happens then why isn't it working because too often times god's work gets hindered when our human will is not wholly surrendered when there's some mixture of faith and doubt and when there's a listen friends when there's a division in your own heart because you're you're condemned over your lifestyle now i spent the whole three quarters of this sermon pumping you up on what's available now let me tell you how to how to not make it fail because no one can make it fail listen satan can't make it fail only you can satan has no authority to make god's power fail in your life that's you doing that see it's it's it's however much power i proved that to you on sunday there in ephesians 3 but it's it's all about the level of fellowship that we have paul remember those dynamic words that paul used about the whole fullness of god and i wish for you to have all this abundantly above and paul said according according as it works in you see according to the level of fellowship in your life there's the rub according to the sincerity of our heart you know before the lord listen friends i've already told you you're just helping me eat my eat my food tonight and there's a mixture there when you're when your heart that's why the bible says if our heart condemns us not if listen if you're questioning the very message brought down to us in this hour by the mighty angel if to you it's just a man-made opinion that you can kind of pick and choose like a smorgasbord i'm here to tell you you're you're you know it's it's the person like that i feel like the angel who stood to the rich young ruler and said thou fool you don't even you're so unaware of what's actually real and people stand and just think oh he was just a man willie but yeah it wasn't you know half century ago and it was just his opinion and he did make mistakes thank god because if he hadn't i wouldn't think there's any chance for me i'm thankful he was a man i'm thankful he had his ups and downs i'm thankful he was a man of like passions like the original elijah i'm thankful for that it gives me hope it gives me a chance i say wow if even a prophet who spent half of his life in the presence of god could still stumble and and make mistakes and have to repent and blush in the presence of god when he preaches a blushing prophet have to walk down in front of the church and feel his own sin i just say lord there's hope for me oh there's hope for me lord god hallelujah see end-time realities that we see today are heading off the rails the world is going inescapably sideways there's nobody going to fix it this train is crashing we know this by reading the events that that that happen once the gentile bride departs we can read about him in the tribulation period things that take place when she's gone so the question then becomes how deeply are we left to wade you know how how deep are we going to wade into pre-tribulation events before the exodus i don't know the answer to that fully but i know it's already dropping around us i know we live in very serious times i know that this is an age for you teenagers this is a age this is an age almost a thousand times more critical than when i was your age we have arrived at the end of all things and this is time because this is we have arrived where brother branham said this is coming you're gonna get it you're gonna need this you better be ready see so we so so so the events are taking shape then that will literally move the bride coming of christ into her fullness i believe that a hundred percent events are happening right now listen here's what it's not it's not god lost control what it is is events that are putting you and god will use these events to bring this whole bride because i've already said to you that i firmly believe this bride body will come to a complete spoken word fullness but but let's all be honest sometimes we're just a bunch of no good laodiceans yes we're believers yes we've had experience yes we believe it yes we say amen but this old flesh does get in our way amen i'm here to tell you crucify it because the more you can crucify this man the more that the divine life can flow through you god is allowing these events to bring this bride into her fullness on that sermon it it was so powerful where brother branham preached souls in prison brother branham says he says now you people who might talk about people who hear it on tape he says that's you that's listening to this tape i wish you could look at this congregation at this time this is from yesteryear it's a prophet you you're you're hearing off of a tape i'm reading you statements taken off of magnetic tape and i'm taking you back to 1963. and a prophet has captivated an audience an alarm and he himself is alarmed because he looks at the bible and he sees the lamb come forward and take the book and he knows the the mercy seat that the that the that the sanctuary goes smokey he knows there's no more blood on the altar when that happens and he knows he's got an open book it's like two and two together wow i know i got an open book but i know when he opens the book and takes it mercy's over so is mercy over are we already preaching is the third pole preaching to souls in prison already in full swing he says i wish you could look at this congregation at this time but remember at this time he says he talks about noah when the judgment started coming noah was in the ark the bride is sealed in with christ the last member has been redeemed see watch the sixth seal has produced itself the seventh seal brings him back to the earth the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand and sat down and claimed what he owned what he had to redeem that's right it's always been that third pull see he says it may be later than we think yes now remember he comes the net that evening and says now if it's not it is coming listen friends this is happening that we're not waiting for these these things to start happening they've already been happening apace and the only thing that's happening now is the last winding of the clock the last few ticks see those last names to be called so so mercy is over outside of the open book there's no redemption outside of it people can find salvation from destruction but they can't find redemption outside of the open book i mean if if if people could find it in their own in their church systems why did the lamb need to open the book it's the lamb's book of life see he says it may be later than we think now listen i'm gonna close in 10 minutes i still got you he says don't he says uh it may be later than we think it'll catch you don't go any further he's pleading with people don't go any further don't do it people if you've always believed me as god's servant take my word this morning if you ever did it it might already be too late so much scripture shows it that way now remember i don't say that it is i don't know but look he goes on down he says i've cut out about 10 pages here that i was afraid to tell you he said you know he he talks about going you know to to charlie and nellie's and he said to them i can't even i can't say this charlie i can't say that he said it's too frightening he comes he says people will laugh at this message it's all right it'll be past turning back one of these days it'll be past turning back one of these days now listen listen carefully listen what a prophet says it'll be past turning back one of these days go on it's like elijah when they're he says call call louder call louder you know those those false prophets trying to bring down fire and elijah just mocks him go on call louder he's probably probably brother emcee's probably on a fishing trip somewhere call louder he says go on just be a church member go on cut off your hair paint your face go on take father son and holy ghost if you want to make it three gods and be a heathen go on stick to your organization do so if you want to go ahead this is the prophet who knew where he stood go on stay in your organization go ahead cut your hair go ahead paint your face yeah go ahead go ahead go ahead see he says it's the word that tells it the people in the word has got to be one jesus in the word was the same he was the word and when jesus lives buckled up when jesus lives in the human being that makes him and the word the same your life tells what you are may i say this god forbid god forbid that what i've said is now may i understand it everybody god forbid i got children that's not in i got two daughters and a son i got brothers i got my people that's not in god forbid that grace has left us that all this is only pretending now keep keep remembering that evening he comes back and he says now if it's if this is not now it will be is there grace left lord let me be wrong on this you go back and listen to yourself you never heard william branham be so alarmed in his life people screaming is there grace left lord let me be wrong on this lord let it let it be wrong at this time that i it isn't the people that they can still be saved granted lord i pray and commit this audience to you now and people are wailing as he's saying this in the name of jesus lord jesus i pray you'll save becky and sarah and joseph and them too lord and don't let this happen to my children lord don't let it happen to my brothers and my friends granted lord he says we don't know we don't know but we're seeing something lord it's a shaking sign right now before it's granted lord draw us close to you quickly lord we love you and we need you brother junior jackson jumps to his feet and begins to prophesy clears a bell brother junior was identified by the brother branham with a gift of prophecy like that he begins to prophesy an unknown tongue and right away confirming the message confirming this is the hour this is the time what you've heard today is real i remember as a young boy sitting in a in a living room in hickory north carolina and we were having a little family altar and dad and mom played this very sermon i remember it like it was yesterday and as that and as as that begin to roll and i i'm sitting listening today and i can hear those women crying out men shouting and screaming and people in a commotion and brother branham said nobody's even sitting down everybody's standing up everybody's piling around the altar i was in a church i i remember i remember in in 1990 when the gulf war started i was in a church in newton north carolina and and they come out and we all knew there was a bunch of things going on in the middle east and and pastor miller comes out and he didn't say it at the beginning because he knew what would happen and he was exactly right and he waited till he finished his sermon very good sermon called invasion of the usa took brother branson's sermon and and preached from that invasion of the usa and that brother branham's whole point was don't be waiting for an invasion of the usa she's already been invaded hollywood has already invaded her demon powers has already invaded her america's long been under control she forfeited her rights in 1956 and he said now i remember i was sitting right about where chris is now and brother miller just comes down off the platform he says now i need to let everybody know i'm done with my sermon and he and he says he says i mean i need to tell you all uh the the war has started they've dropped the bomb and and he tells a couple people like brother tony your mother needs you to call her right away so so-and-so your husband said quickly leave come home and people like what what oh my goodness it's war in the middle east is this all leading to armageddon and oh my goodness teenagers that you couldn't have drugged to the altar with wild horses were running falling on the altar screaming and crying god have mercy thought maybe it was already over i'm here to tell you one of these days it's going to be over you mark it down young person old person married single it's going to be over one of these days hallelujah that's what revelation 10 came to declare there was nothing left after after the bride is the is the measurable perfection in a chapter 11 verse 1 it's the last image you see of her and then they don't measure the outside court because that's left to the gentiles they're going into the tribulation the eagle anointing lifts up flies east picks up moses and elijah goes for the 144 thousand and a bride is seated on a table thousands of miles long oh i'm gonna be there friends hallelujah and i remember sitting in that living room just a boy and that and brother branham comes and he's saying these same words and as i'm reliving it like i'm back in that living room and here's my dad and here's lisa and nathan my mom's sitting over here and i'm sitting here and and the atmosphere became so charged so thick and we we all begin to feel the alarm and the anointing and and and and and sister gene you know slipping into the spirit and just the most flawless fluent german you've ever heard a german speak when sister jean she has a she has a gift of that and it's always in german i've heard it several times sister gene fall under prophecy and tongues and prophecy and it's fluent german here's a country girl who barely could speak english and it's fluent germanist and oh my goodness and she got to the end and a big crescendo and then comes the prophecy and interpreted and it's god warning us and god and i'm sitting there and i'm i'm 14 years old and i'm i'm thinking my goodness i'm the exact age brother branham is referring to and he says i was 14 when i got shot and he said i descended down into hell and he said those most awful things he said i heard and he said i was a new arrival he said oh it's horrible and you can imagine and i'm sitting there and here's my sister she's 17 maybe 18 and her and i both are right at that point where we've got to make crucial decisions about our life are we going to serve god what's it going to be and even even that very event helped my sister to overcome she'd got herself trapped up in a terrible battle with an unbeliever boy and he was crazy about her she knew it couldn't happen and and and sister gene comes and prophesies and the word of god comes and it shook us i remember trembling oh my goodness what's happening and sister gene streams out and and it just swept over the whole room i'm here to tell you something friends this world is not a place you're going to want to be when the when the love of god has left and went home oh my i sat there gripped in the midst of that thick atmosphere and now i'm listening today and i'm hearing him cry out for becky and sarah and joseph and i'll tell you something friends sin listen to listen to brother jason a minute sin can't be covered up with a nice appearance sin is not sin is not sin is not covered uh by your appearance sin is not covered by your prayers sin is not covered by your tears that sin can only be removed by repentance it doesn't matter how much you cry and how much you pray and how you dress yourself you've got to repent you've got to change you've got to turn around you've got to let god come in and take a hold of your life oh is that what you desire here tonight friends that's what releases the power of god you have a weakness you have a weakness that keeps you back you have a besetting thing that you can't battle you can't you can't get victory i'm here to tell you something i can tell you from experience from many years of serving the lord when you repent deeply enough you'll find that that thing goes away forever forever but it takes a deep enough repentance and too often times we don't have a deep enough repentance you know why because we don't want to surrender the things that we like holding on to i'm here to tell you tonight you better get a hold of god and say god change my mind give me that zeal give me a desire for true repentance take away all the world from me oh god i don't want to be here when it all comes undone i want to be seated at that table thousands of miles long i want to have authority in my life now i want to be able to take authority over devils in my home on your children in your marriages in my marriage in this church how about at bethel tabernacle that's the kind of life we want to have when that happens friends you can have a perfect confidence between you and god and all things become possible your prayers rise to the heavens and you literally catch on fire a zeal can come into your life i'm speaking from experience you'll literally catch on fire and it'll burn every influence of the world out of your life forever hallelujah how many believe it tonight that's what revelation 10 is about it came to produce mrs jesus christ with full authority and dominion over every devil and give us victory total victory you'll be free to your home safe on the other side amen don't let a uh you know don't let a a lack of commitment have have a made-up mind brother ram says that was the strength of abraham was his committal it's the thing god noticed once abraham made a commitment that was it and and i'm here to tell you something friends you need a spirit of commitment you want to stay tonight why don't you stand with me say lord grant a spirit of commitment to i need to say lord i i need to reach a greater level of repentance lord i need to see victory in all my life and but lord the truth is i'm a human i got a weakness and and and to think that that i lose this or lose that or have to give to say lord give me a commitment give me a commitment to greater repentance because only through repentance can i find that kind of that kind of life that kind of flow oh that's what i want today jesus that's what i want here that's what i want for me it's what i want for these people tonight oh god i want to see a a commitment from the family of god we want to have a bride who is eating the book lord a bride who is in full authority over the devil and when he comes to us he findeth nothing in me grant that to me grant that my life is so surrendered that when satan cometh he findeth nothing in me no fear no besetting sins no doubts no no no evil my whole life my whole human life surrendered to the will of the father this is where our victory comes from this is the source lord this is the purpose of revelation 10. this is what it came for i want to have it tonight lord i pray you'll grant it how many want it tonight just raise up those hands and say lord i want that tonight i want that in my home i want that for my family i want that for my children all across the building out over the internet raise up your hands say lord don't be ashamed let your children see it raise up those hands young people everywhere raise up those hands say lord i need more of you that's the honest truth today oh god i need more i need a commitment father i need to have a spirit of repentance come upon me where i will repent so thoroughly that thing will leave me and never bother me again hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah to the lamb of god oh i love him friends don't you come amen brother matt bring your team oh i love him i love him because he first loved me oh friends do you understand now what revelation 10 is all about it's not just about doctrinal teaching or information or theology it's about bringing a reality just just go tomorrow and just keep saying this to yourself he opened the lamb's book of life he opened the lamb's book of life no one could open it no one was worthy to even look at it not even his family we were all born in sin think about what you're entitled to today no you you know we're talking about this today brother paul and i what what was that book what was the opening of that book it was the mighty god unveiled brother ram said he opened those seals that broke him off of himself he's christ he was god unbridled no one was worthy to look at that no one is to this moment except those who are redeemed by the lamb you have a privilege tonight i don't care what you how much of a failure you might feel you might feel as dry as us as a stick but just remember brother jason reminded you you've been given the privilege to gaze into the lamb's book of life the mighty god unveiled before us that's that's that's why i'm a believer that's why i believe this message because i see it has that ability in our lives oh my let's power heads one more time we'll sing some songs but i want to pray first i love that song they're playing lord on calvary's tree my i thank you for that day on calvary i thank you that you ascended on high i thank you that you took the book and opened the seals you sent back your life into the church lord we stand here today and not one of us could claim to be worthy of anything lord if it's based on our worthiness we i'm sure we would have been destroyed a long time ago somehow you you look beyond our faults you see our need you look beyond our faults you see a seed i thank you for that master i love what the gospel has done to me i i can only confess lord that i want a greater portion oh god i want to have greater repentance i want to have greater commitment i want to see i want to have greater fellowship i want to have divine communion whatever i've got to get out of my life whatever it takes lord help me to search through my life and my lifestyle and the things i'm involved with lord is there anything hindering that divine flow if it is then i'm missing the purpose of the seventh seal how tragic it couldn't have a more tragic story a son or daughter of god missing out on the value of the seventh seal too carnal to be a partaker of it how sad how sad don't let it be anyone under the sound of my voice don't let it be me don't let it be in my family don't let it be any of bethel tabernacle lord help us master pour out your mercy on us now we commit it to you in jesus name amen let's sing it guys [Music] [Music] aren't you glad for
