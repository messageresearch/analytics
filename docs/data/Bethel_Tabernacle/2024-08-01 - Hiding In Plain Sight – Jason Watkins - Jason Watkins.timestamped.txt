[55:41] airwaves and times to come in the
[55:44] archive people who will see it we commit
[55:46] it to you in Jesus name amen God bless
[55:50] you you can all be seated amen praise
[55:53] the Lord my whole church full of Honeys
[55:54] can be seated amen amen praise
[56:06] God you ready for some good
[56:09] practical thoughts from the word of
[56:16] God what we might call uh you know
[56:19] rather on the Deep Side of expository
[56:22] preaching but tonight I just
[56:25] have simple thought that that has struck
[56:28] my heart I've actually um brother uh
[56:31] Josh brother Gideon and uh brother Uriah
[56:35] actually heard some of this material in
[56:37] in one of our morning devotionals there
[56:40] at Watkins mechanical that we do on
[56:42] Tuesday Mornings actually G Manic goes
[56:44] all the way back to the very first one
[56:46] we ever did but we titled it different
[56:48] and my angle was different and uh but
[56:51] I'm I'm borrowing some of that you might
[56:53] recognize parts of it tonight so good
[56:55] deal you must need to hear
[56:57] again praise the
[57:00] Lord that's right I can say that to my
[57:02] grandson right the
[57:05] phrase hiding in plain sight is quite
[57:09] archaic it goes way back some of the
[57:11] earliest writings where it actually
[57:13] appeared in literature it seems to be a
[57:15] rural saying and some of the earliest
[57:18] times that I could find um with not a
[57:21] very in-depth study but it looked like
[57:23] it went all the way back to the late
[57:25] 1800s and they were using this this
[57:28] statement or statements similar to it
[57:31] and it refers to something or someone
[57:35] that is not concealed but remains
[57:39] unnoticed uh and that can that can be
[57:42] simply due to human perception
[57:47] limitations uh originally it was a
[57:49] military tactic and I thought wow that
[57:52] doesn't surprise me because that's what
[57:55] it means when you hear them say we need
[57:57] to create a
[57:58] diversion and so because they're going
[58:00] to move through an open area where
[58:02] they're going to be noticed and so we
[58:05] need a diversion so that we can run in
[58:08] in plain sight and no one will
[58:10] notice so it suggests that objects can
[58:14] be overlooked even when they are clearly
[58:20] visible the concept was popularized in
[58:23] literature most notably by
[58:26] uh Edgar Allen Poe and he emphasized
[58:30] that the best hiding places are very
[58:33] often the most obvious
[58:35] places the phenomenon and that's what
[58:38] they call it the phenomenon is linked to
[58:41] and I didn't know this was a
[58:43] term I got to make sure I say it right
[58:46] inattentional
[58:48] blindness now not
[58:50] unintentional inattentional intentional
[58:54] blindness where f focus on one aspect
[58:58] causes neglect of
[59:01] others so I want to speak of something
[59:04] this evening that may be hiding in plain
[59:07] sight from you Philippians 4:11 Paul
[59:12] said not that I speak in respect of want
[59:15] for I have learned in whatsoever State I
[59:18] am therewith to be content in fact as
[59:22] this passage in Philippians 4 is called
[59:25] the contentment Passage
[59:27] and and that's because of its practical
[59:29] teaching towards contentment as a
[59:32] lifestyle now I think that that you
[59:35] would agree with me tonight that it that
[59:38] even just a brief observation of the
[59:41] world order that we live in today we can
[59:44] see that contentment is pretty grossly
[59:47] overlooked as a virtue um everybody is
[59:51] chasing that
[59:52] hustle and fact is it's almost deafening
[59:55] uh these days the shout uh the shouts of
[59:59] entitlement that we hear constantly
[1:00:02] everywhere it's it's permeating the
[1:00:04] fabric of society itself and it's it's
[1:00:07] it's every gender it's every race it's
[1:00:09] every Creed it's every age doesn't
[1:00:12] matter everybody feels entitled and
[1:00:15] everybody feels like it's somebody
[1:00:17] else's fault and everybody feels like
[1:00:18] somebody owes me and if you understand
[1:00:22] that the age that we live in being the
[1:00:24] leoan church age historically speaking
[1:00:27] leoa means by definition people's rights
[1:00:32] so this is the age for that so it
[1:00:33] doesn't surprise us it doesn't take us
[1:00:36] catch us off guard I would even go as
[1:00:38] far as to say that a lack of real
[1:00:41] contentment ought to be here it is a
[1:00:44] sign of the nearing time when a new
[1:00:48] world is going to come into being where
[1:00:50] I promise you contentment is going to be
[1:00:53] a reigning virtue amen
[1:00:57] contentment is so powerful a force for
[1:01:00] peace of mind it's almost unequal it it
[1:01:04] it's packed full of Peace it's packed
[1:01:06] full of Tranquility it's packed full of
[1:01:09] a settled settled happiness and I would
[1:01:13] say regardless of
[1:01:15] circumstances in fact even in difficult
[1:01:18] circumstance and it's actually as as
[1:01:21] plain an ancient truth as you could ever
[1:01:25] want I would call it a Time tested
[1:01:28] Memorial of joy and satisfaction would
[1:01:32] you agree with that uh but it goes
[1:01:35] largely
[1:01:36] unappreciated You' think something so
[1:01:38] valuable would be front and center it's
[1:01:41] actually way down at the Bottom Rung of
[1:01:44] the ladder uh and some people have
[1:01:47] nothing to do with it whatsoever it's
[1:01:49] it's has no factor it's not a factor in
[1:01:52] their life at all they're content with
[1:01:54] nothing and uh it's it's it's almost as
[1:01:57] if nobody notices the beauty it holds
[1:02:00] it's almost as if it's hiding in plain
[1:02:05] sight intentional blindness which was a
[1:02:08] term I'd never heard or another term for
[1:02:11] it is Perpetual blindness occurs and
[1:02:15] this is straight from Wikipedia it
[1:02:18] occurs when an
[1:02:20] individual fails to perceive an
[1:02:24] unexpected stimulus in in plain sight
[1:02:27] purely as a result there's nothing wrong
[1:02:30] with their eyesight and that's very
[1:02:32] clear in the definition I I fared it out
[1:02:35] just the main parts of it but one of the
[1:02:37] things it kept emphasizing was not that
[1:02:39] somebody's got they're blind or they or
[1:02:42] they don't see very well they might have
[1:02:43] 2020 Vision but inattentional blindness
[1:02:46] or Perpetual blindness occurs when an
[1:02:49] individual fails to perceive an
[1:02:52] unexpected stimulus in plain sight
[1:02:56] purely as a result purely as a result of
[1:03:00] a lack of attention rather than any
[1:03:04] Vision defects or
[1:03:07] deficits when it becomes impossible to
[1:03:11] attend to all the stimuli in a given
[1:03:14] situation a temporary
[1:03:18] blindness a temporary effect of
[1:03:21] blindness can occur as your senses
[1:03:25] become
[1:03:28] overwhelmed and I've seen I've seen
[1:03:30] skits of that where you'll have a group
[1:03:32] and they're all doing something
[1:03:34] Everybody's In Motion a lot of times
[1:03:36] it's all choreographed and you're
[1:03:38] watching everybody's hands and feet and
[1:03:40] the chore choreography and somebody
[1:03:42] dressed in a gorilla suit just walks
[1:03:44] right behind them waves at the camera
[1:03:47] and walks on off and you never see it
[1:03:50] till they show it back again and say now
[1:03:51] look what you missed and they bring him
[1:03:53] out and freeze FR him you go how did I
[1:03:56] miss that a a big hairy gorilla walked
[1:04:01] right behind him and waved at me and I
[1:04:04] never saw him looked right at him it's
[1:04:07] because I was overwhelmed with all of
[1:04:10] the motion don't think the devil doesn't
[1:04:13] know how to run that and contentment is
[1:04:17] God is godliness real Godly contentment
[1:04:20] and I will assure you it's hiding in
[1:04:22] plain sight but the world is blind to it
[1:04:26] and and that's to be expected but what's
[1:04:28] not to be expected is God's family to be
[1:04:33] blind to it you
[1:04:36] agree
[1:04:38] contentment you try to say that into the
[1:04:41] world oh shouldn't we want to
[1:04:44] thrive
[1:04:47] yeah God's word doesn't call for us to
[1:04:51] live in
[1:04:52] mediocrity nothing in the word
[1:04:54] compelling you to to live like that on
[1:04:57] purpose uh Proverbs 6 6-11 Josh if you
[1:05:01] can catch up and get that one Proverbs
[1:05:03] 66 to1 go to the ant Solomon says go to
[1:05:07] the ant thou sluggard consider her ways
[1:05:10] and be wise which having no guide
[1:05:13] overseer or ruler provideth her meat in
[1:05:17] the summer and gathereth her food in the
[1:05:19] Harvest how long wilt thou sleep o
[1:05:22] sluggard when wil thou arise out of thy
[1:05:25] sleep yet a my brother Eddie Used To
[1:05:27] quote this all the time yet a little
[1:05:31] sleep a little Slumber a little folding
[1:05:33] of the hands remember that Mom little
[1:05:35] folding of the a little folding of the
[1:05:37] hands to sleep so shall thy poverty come
[1:05:42] as one that TR travaileth and thy want
[1:05:46] as an armed
[1:05:47] man so it doesn't matter
[1:05:51] how how um able you feel to defend
[1:05:56] yourself if you're a sluggard that
[1:05:59] poverty is going to take you like an
[1:06:00] armed man you're going to get mugged in
[1:06:02] the street and you're not going to be
[1:06:04] able to defend yourself against it and
[1:06:06] you're going to walk around in poverty
[1:06:07] so the Bible doesn't call for us to live
[1:06:10] in mediocrity there's nothing mediocre
[1:06:13] about the great champions of Faith you
[1:06:15] go read Paul's Faith chapter oh my
[1:06:18] goodness friends men women boys and
[1:06:20] girls and they they they lived in caves
[1:06:23] and dens and holes in the ground and
[1:06:25] they suffered persecution and and
[1:06:27] sometimes they they put to flight the
[1:06:29] armies of the enemies they swung a sword
[1:06:32] sometimes they didn't swing a sword
[1:06:34] sometimes they they suffered persecution
[1:06:36] and sometimes they wouldn't even accept
[1:06:39] Deliverance because they were content
[1:06:43] with the next Life coming I don't need
[1:06:46] to chase this
[1:06:48] one see so so thriving by all
[1:06:54] means but here are some things for you
[1:06:58] to think about here are some
[1:07:00] questions that you may want to ask
[1:07:03] yourself first question one how would
[1:07:07] you
[1:07:07] define or
[1:07:09] describe thriving what does that look
[1:07:12] like to you what what does that look
[1:07:14] like in your mind the world describes
[1:07:18] thriving hear me and you know it's true
[1:07:21] I'm not saying anything you don't know
[1:07:23] the world describes thriving
[1:07:26] way different than God
[1:07:29] does come on that's the first thing you
[1:07:32] need to take ownership of tonight God's
[1:07:35] definition of thriving and the world's
[1:07:37] definition of thriving are light years
[1:07:40] apart they're as far as the East is from
[1:07:43] the West so back to my question what
[1:07:45] does thriving look like to
[1:07:47] you how do you do you how do you
[1:07:51] interpret thriving is it the world's
[1:07:55] version you want be
[1:07:58] honest be honest not going to embarrass
[1:08:01] anybody put anybody on the spot not
[1:08:03] going to say let me see you show hands
[1:08:05] of all you Sinners that are chasing the
[1:08:09] world if I say anything like that I'll
[1:08:12] say something like how many of you love
[1:08:14] the Lord and then everybody can raise
[1:08:15] their hand how many of you love the Lord
[1:08:18] am good he loves you
[1:08:24] too but which which one is it that
[1:08:26] you're
[1:08:28] choosing if it's the world's
[1:08:32] vision of
[1:08:34] thriving then ask yourself this next
[1:08:38] question what are you willing to pay for
[1:08:43] it to what
[1:08:45] level are you willing to
[1:08:49] sacrifice those around you to achieve
[1:08:53] it even even the ones you
[1:08:58] love even to our
[1:09:01] families friends families get sacrificed
[1:09:04] all the time on the altar of pursuing
[1:09:09] fortune and
[1:09:10] fame Am I
[1:09:13] Wrong families get sacrificed all the
[1:09:18] time because somebody in the family or
[1:09:23] part of the family or all the family are
[1:09:26] trying to thrive by the standards of the
[1:09:29] world and it literally is burning lives
[1:09:32] down I say that unapologetically because
[1:09:35] I see it on the streets not only is it
[1:09:38] not you know when we talk about
[1:09:41] contentment not godly contentment not
[1:09:44] only is it you know uh or are are are
[1:09:48] are or I mean it's it's it's absent
[1:09:52] let's just be honest Godly contentment
[1:09:54] is looked at as failure yeah you're not
[1:09:58] striving you're not
[1:10:00] thriving God's family is striving more
[1:10:02] than you think they are and you're
[1:10:04] striving more than the devil wants to
[1:10:06] let you believe you are if you're still
[1:10:08] a believer in this hour in this
[1:10:09] impossibly dark hour I'm here to tell
[1:10:11] you you are striving and you are
[1:10:13] striving rather
[1:10:15] well see and so so we have people who
[1:10:20] are sacrificing families sacrificing
[1:10:24] friends sacrificing ing those who they
[1:10:26] say they love not only is it not
[1:10:28] uncommon in the modern day but I would
[1:10:31] even say it's flourishing and spreading
[1:10:33] unchecked in society if there's not
[1:10:36] somewhere a voice of God's family to say
[1:10:39] hold
[1:10:40] on what are you
[1:10:44] chasing brother bam used to say people
[1:10:46] fly down the road 90 miles an hour to go
[1:10:50] in a bar and drink for three
[1:10:52] hours he says what you heard where you
[1:10:58] going it's actually prophesied to be
[1:11:01] part of the poisonous Spirit of the last
[1:11:03] age did you know that parents without
[1:11:05] natural affection that's part of the
[1:11:08] prophecy of this age a father tells his
[1:11:11] son or his daughter hey you know I did
[1:11:13] all this for you guys I I I worked all
[1:11:16] those hours I got all this money I
[1:11:18] acquired all this success only to hear
[1:11:20] that child say back but Dad I didn't
[1:11:23] really want your money I wanted you
[1:11:29] I'm so glad I raised three humans and I
[1:11:34] never had to hear those
[1:11:37] words I can't tell you how grateful I am
[1:11:40] to God that I've never had to hear one
[1:11:43] of my sons say but Dad I didn't want all
[1:11:46] your hard work I wanted you oh I'm GNA
[1:11:48] tell you something friends the family of
[1:11:51] God is at a whole different level at
[1:11:53] least we're supposed to be
[1:11:55] amen we're supposed to be next level uh
[1:12:00] having Next Level Lifestyles and so you
[1:12:03] know I uh you know but but that's got to
[1:12:06] be painful you know to hear a child say
[1:12:08] I wanted you more than money or success
[1:12:12] and hey may I say not just parents
[1:12:15] living selfishly what about
[1:12:17] teens what about children the Bible says
[1:12:20] a prophecy in the last days that
[1:12:22] children will rise up to be their
[1:12:24] parents' Tormentor
[1:12:25] that's Bible prophecy man I'd hate to
[1:12:28] read that and go gee whiz that's
[1:12:30] me I'd rather read over here about
[1:12:32] somebody that love God and humbled his
[1:12:34] heart and say there I am oh Hallelujah
[1:12:36] somebody that was willing to say father
[1:12:38] forgive
[1:12:41] me so I you know it's it teens sometimes
[1:12:44] living in a home who want their way so
[1:12:46] bad that they'll set an entire family on
[1:12:50] edge just to get their
[1:12:52] way amen amen
[1:12:55] amen you parents better amen teens
[1:12:57] aren't going
[1:13:08] to you
[1:13:12] know sometimes I'm I'll just say it like
[1:13:15] this and and I honest to goodness have
[1:13:18] asked myself all day Lord why in the
[1:13:21] where is this sermon coming from who am
[1:13:23] I even going to be preaching to
[1:13:25] because I can't think of a case that I'm
[1:13:28] and and yet this is the Lord I know for
[1:13:31] sure woke me up early this morning and
[1:13:33] I've been studying it all day and I
[1:13:35] wasn't even scheduled to preach but our
[1:13:36] Lord already told me I would
[1:13:39] be and you know sometimes I have to say
[1:13:42] friends that when you get a situation
[1:13:45] like that where you get teens and
[1:13:46] children even down to small children I'm
[1:13:49] truly not sure which is more um
[1:13:53] astonishing to me you know
[1:13:55] um teens that'll live that selfishly or
[1:13:57] parents will let
[1:13:59] them I don't know which one is more
[1:14:02] astonishing parenting is certainly not
[1:14:04] for the faint of heart or the
[1:14:09] irresponsible and I haven't even
[1:14:11] mentioned to ask what you know what if
[1:14:13] your vision of thriving is contrary to
[1:14:17] God's word maybe I should just pause for
[1:14:19] five minutes and let you think about
[1:14:22] that what what if you're I mean I should
[1:14:25] have made I probably should have had
[1:14:27] this at the front of it and here I am at
[1:14:29] the end of it saying hey wait a minute
[1:14:31] hold on time out what if your vision of
[1:14:33] thriving young man young woman older man
[1:14:36] older woman married single young old
[1:14:38] doesn't matter what if your vision of
[1:14:41] thriving is is different than God's plan
[1:14:45] for you
[1:14:47] see and
[1:14:49] um what if it's contrary to God's word
[1:14:52] for our lives as his children
[1:14:55] and now and listen hey let me let me
[1:14:58] just say maybe not nothing bad or even
[1:15:01] sinful uh but but but what if your
[1:15:04] Pursuit just happens to be opposite of
[1:15:07] his plan and his goal for your
[1:15:12] life see say well but Pastor I I have a
[1:15:16] free will I love that one I have a free
[1:15:20] will I love me some people who have a
[1:15:22] free will to which I always just say
[1:15:25] sure you've got a free will guess what
[1:15:27] so does
[1:15:28] God where you think you got Free Will
[1:15:31] from you think God doesn't have free
[1:15:34] will who do you whose will you think
[1:15:36] should win yours or the creator of all
[1:15:39] the universe and The Giver of all
[1:15:43] life so you know I just think that him
[1:15:46] being the creator of all things and The
[1:15:48] Giver of life itself you know I I I
[1:15:51] think maybe we are to think about his
[1:15:53] will for our lives see now now you can
[1:15:56] relax you can breathe because I got a
[1:15:59] little bit of good news for you but it's
[1:16:01] a trick it's it's kind of like like
[1:16:04] Eugene come in there F in Odyssey and
[1:16:07] said hey guys I got some really good
[1:16:10] news and some news that pretty much
[1:16:13] cancels the good
[1:16:16] news I mean he not were laughing at that
[1:16:19] the other
[1:16:22] day because here here's the good news
[1:16:24] God tends to give you he he tends to
[1:16:27] give people the desire of their heart if
[1:16:29] they want it bad
[1:16:30] enough he's known for doing that even if
[1:16:33] you know if they insist on it hard
[1:16:35] enough and long enough he'll finally
[1:16:37] give them the desire of their heart even
[1:16:39] if it's only his permissive will the rub
[1:16:43] is and here's the news that pretty well
[1:16:45] cancels the good news the rub is that
[1:16:48] anyone in the Bible that I can find
[1:16:50] whoever got that and accepted God's
[1:16:53] permissive will um um they regretted
[1:16:56] that decision later
[1:16:58] on and sometimes it can take
[1:17:03] years
[1:17:05] manifest sometimes you don't notice it
[1:17:07] the wheels of judgment grind slow God is
[1:17:10] very patient very kind very loving very
[1:17:13] longsuffering giving he said I I I keep
[1:17:16] Mercy for
[1:17:17] thousands the Bible says his throne is
[1:17:20] established in Mercy that's one of the
[1:17:24] the fundament building materials of his
[1:17:26] throne Imagine a King that rules on a
[1:17:28] throne built out of
[1:17:32] mercy and his his Justice is all the
[1:17:36] time trying to redeem people and
[1:17:40] sometimes it can take years I've seen it
[1:17:42] Go many
[1:17:44] years decades even where it looks like
[1:17:48] they took God's permissive will and
[1:17:49] everything turned out hunky dory and
[1:17:51] everything's going to be fine and looks
[1:17:53] like we we escaped it mm- you didn't you
[1:17:57] didn't Escape it you see
[1:18:00] friends sometimes it doesn't show up for
[1:18:03] years but the laws of sewing and reaping
[1:18:05] work on
[1:18:07] autopilot it's not God following you
[1:18:09] around paying you back God's not
[1:18:12] vindictive like that he doesn't he
[1:18:14] doesn't he doesn't have to be like that
[1:18:16] that's beneath him to act like that but
[1:18:19] God put laws in nature that if you plant
[1:18:21] a seed in good ground it's going to grow
[1:18:23] a crop you don't have to ask it to and
[1:18:25] you can't talk it out of
[1:18:28] it oh I'm so glad that there's a rescue
[1:18:31] plan for that because friends come on
[1:18:34] let's look at all let's look each other
[1:18:36] in the eye and admit we've all sowed
[1:18:38] some bad seed and we've all prayed for a
[1:18:41] crop failure amen but I'm here to tell
[1:18:45] you the beauty of it is I mean God has a
[1:18:47] rescue plan for that I want you to know
[1:18:49] that tonight let me give you some hope
[1:18:51] God has a rescue plan that's where
[1:18:53] Esther faced that when she was there in
[1:18:55] a hazus and they had they had SED a seed
[1:18:58] that on this certain certain day
[1:19:00] everybody can get a weapon and kill all
[1:19:01] the Jews which was going to include
[1:19:04] Esther and you know how that got done by
[1:19:06] the trickery of the devil and how many
[1:19:08] times has the devil put us over a barrel
[1:19:11] by trickery and by Deceit by slight of
[1:19:13] hand and we thought it was God it wasn't
[1:19:14] God and we thought we had his permission
[1:19:16] we really didn't we went forward we seed
[1:19:19] the wrong seed or maybe we did it with
[1:19:21] our eyes wide open and we knew we were
[1:19:23] wrong we didn't care or we didn't think
[1:19:25] about the consequences and here's coming
[1:19:27] the crop and all we're doing is waiting
[1:19:29] on the
[1:19:30] date and I'm going to get slaughtered
[1:19:33] and when she says your majesty change
[1:19:35] your change your mind well he was the
[1:19:37] king he was in the position of like God
[1:19:40] God says I'm God I change not he said
[1:19:42] Esther I can't do that I'm a hazus I
[1:19:44] change not it's the laws of the mes and
[1:19:47] Persians I can't even I can't change my
[1:19:49] own thing that I said see but Esther
[1:19:52] here's what I'll do I'll make a new law
[1:19:55] and I'll write it over the top of the
[1:19:57] other law that instead of on the on the
[1:19:59] 29th when everybody gets to kill all of
[1:20:02] you you Jews here's a law on the 28th
[1:20:05] all the Jews can kill all their enemies
[1:20:08] so that when the 29th came the law was
[1:20:10] still in effect but the 28th had killed
[1:20:13] the effect of the law on the 29th if
[1:20:15] you've seed a crop full of Bad Seed
[1:20:17] start sewing good seed over the top of
[1:20:19] it just start sewing good seed over the
[1:20:22] top of it and it might come up but I'm
[1:20:24] here to tell you it can kill the effect
[1:20:26] of that thing oh I'm glad for a rescue
[1:20:30] plan tonight I'm glad he didn't just
[1:20:32] leave me in that kind of a
[1:20:36] situation
[1:20:38] Hallelujah see so understanding The
[1:20:41] crucial difference between the Doge eat
[1:20:44] dog survival of the
[1:20:47] fittest where the the the strong crush
[1:20:50] the weak and you know and and and and
[1:20:53] understanding this crucial difference
[1:20:56] between survival that the world has and
[1:21:01] and the profound the difference between
[1:21:03] that and I will dare say the profound
[1:21:08] potential for True
[1:21:14] flourishing true genuine
[1:21:19] thriving from God's
[1:21:21] view now that's unfortunate L you
[1:21:25] talking about something hiding in plain
[1:21:27] sight the truth of that is hiding in
[1:21:31] plain sight it's a great
[1:21:33] secret but yet it eludes most of
[1:21:38] humanity and it does so far easier than
[1:21:42] you might imagine and it'll elude you
[1:21:45] far easier than you might imagine I'm
[1:21:49] here to tell you something friends take

[1:25:38] this is what I wish above not most

[1:26:23] your body or what kind of a hardship
[1:26:25] you're
[1:26:27] facing because your soul is
[1:26:32] prospering John is not preaching a
[1:26:34] health and wealth gospel it's not what
[1:26:37] John is doing it's not a it's not a one
[1:26:39] of these charismatic name it claim it
[1:26:43] gospels that's not
[1:26:45] scriptural Prosperity doesn't even
[1:26:47] always mean gaining
[1:26:50] riches see so John's not even talking
[1:26:54] talking about the the idea of wealth
[1:26:56] here but rather that the Lord promises
[1:26:59] to always make sufficient provision for
[1:27:02] the
[1:27:05] believer you know as a father raising a
[1:27:07] family I could say that I always wanted
[1:27:10] my children to be in health and
[1:27:12] prosper I get
[1:27:14] it I read this about a heavenly father
[1:27:17] and I go yeah makes sense to me because
[1:27:18] I was a dad am a
[1:27:22] dad but as a father father I also
[1:27:26] knew
[1:27:28] sometimes character is only
[1:27:31] gained by fighting through suffering and
[1:27:38] hardship Josh don't follow on this one
[1:27:40] because I'm going to read it from the
[1:27:41] NLT 2 Thessalonians 13-5 listen listen
[1:27:45] to me dear brothers and
[1:27:48] sisters we can't help but thank God for
[1:27:51] you because your faith is flourish
[1:27:55] and your love for one another notice how
[1:27:58] Daisy changed those together your faith

[1:28:07] hand in hand when the love of God
[1:28:09] between them between the family of God
[1:28:11] is growing faith is
[1:28:13] flourishing you know why you know why
[1:28:15] that's true because you're looking
[1:28:17] beyond our each other's faults you're
[1:28:20] looking at you're saying well you know
[1:28:22] that's a that's a that's a problem in my
[1:28:24] brother but I got a problem too and how
[1:28:27] why you know I'll pray for you you pray
[1:28:28] for me and we'll all make it
[1:28:30] home we won't have that problem over
[1:28:33] there
[1:28:34] amen so he
[1:28:37] says because your faith is flourishing
[1:28:39] and your love for one another is growing
[1:28:42] verse four we proudly tell God's other
[1:28:45] churches about your endurance and
[1:28:47] faithfulness in all the persecutions and
[1:28:50] hardships you are suffering hold on what
[1:28:54] this is the F this is a family of God
[1:28:56] this a church of of Christ what do you
[1:28:59] mean they're having they're having
[1:29:00] hardships and sufferings Where's
[1:29:04] God what how are you letting this happen
[1:29:08] and Paul is saying Your Love is Growing
[1:29:11] your faith is flourishing I'm telling
[1:29:13] everybody about you
[1:29:15] guys because people think oh anybody can
[1:29:19] be happy when things are going good but
[1:29:21] you guys are suffering and your love is
[1:29:23] still
[1:29:24] growing you guys are in the middle of
[1:29:26] hardship but yet your faith is
[1:29:30] flourishing see in all persecutions and
[1:29:34] hardships you are suffering and God
[1:29:37] listen to this friends God will use this
[1:29:41] persecution to show his Justice and to
[1:29:45] make you worthy of his kingdom for which
[1:29:49] you are
[1:29:51] suffering you know as a father I I could
[1:29:54] teach perseverance and overcoming in
[1:29:56] God's word but I but I knew that the
[1:29:58] best teachers always
[1:30:01] experience and sometimes my
[1:30:04] kids uh they had bad
[1:30:06] ideas and uh they went in a direction
[1:30:09] that I knew wasn't the best one but you
[1:30:12] know as long as I knew that if worse
[1:30:14] come to worse I could recover them I
[1:30:16] could reach out and save them and fix it
[1:30:19] and pick them back up and clean them and
[1:30:21] pay the bill and and set them back up on
[1:30:23] their feet again I knew I could recover
[1:30:26] them and so sometimes you know when I
[1:30:28] knew things weren't going to turn out so
[1:30:30] good I'd even actually let them make a
[1:30:32] mistake just so that they could learn
[1:30:35] the lesson through
[1:30:41] experience I want to tell you something
[1:30:43] friends the pursuit of excellence in all
[1:30:45] we think and do that is a worthy goal I
[1:30:48] want to really I want to really put that
[1:30:51] to you so you don't think that this
[1:30:54] message is about oh I got to be poor and
[1:30:56] run down you
[1:30:58] don't I'm just simply saying have the
[1:31:00] right
[1:31:01] balance go after God's Prosperity go
[1:31:04] after God's Enlightenment go after God's
[1:31:07] word go after God's peace see because
[1:31:10] that'll be lasting that'll be enduring
[1:31:13] and and and and and I get it the pursuit
[1:31:16] of Excellence I'm I'm All About that I
[1:31:18] give no I offer No Quarter to any of my
[1:31:21] sons or grandsons who are who do not
[1:31:24] strive for excellence my girls none of
[1:31:26] them I don't allow that I tell them all
[1:31:28] the time you know papa is not GNA that's
[1:31:30] not going to work for me you ask any of
[1:31:32] them I I I want you to be excellent and
[1:31:35] if you fail that's okay as long as
[1:31:37] you're trying and as long as you'll just
[1:31:40] keep pressing and have some spunk and
[1:31:42] have some perseverance see and so the
[1:31:45] pursuit of excellence in all we think
[1:31:47] and all that we do that is a worthy goal
[1:31:50] but the problem is that the message
[1:31:52] that's drilled into US is is usually
[1:31:54] only one of two extremes I'm talking
[1:31:56] about leoa the message they drill into
[1:31:59] US is either there's only winners and
[1:32:01] losers and if you're not winning you're
[1:32:04] losing see so either you're winning or
[1:32:07] you're losing but I want to tell you
[1:32:08] tonight that a third reality is possible
[1:32:12] and it offers a much healthier Outlook
[1:32:15] and again again again not mediocrity in
[1:32:18] the
[1:32:19] middle that's not that's not what I'm
[1:32:21] talking that's not the third option
[1:32:24] mediocrity is not the third option we
[1:32:26] see from the scriptural text that we
[1:32:28] read in Philippians 4 that Paul
[1:32:32] discovered you know or or you know Paul
[1:32:35] discovered or or I would say as the King
[1:32:38] James uh version put it that he
[1:32:43] learned see he didn't just Discover it
[1:32:45] that almost sounds like he just walking
[1:32:47] along and found a treasure and stumbled
[1:32:49] over it no he learned this he had to go
[1:32:53] through something right that Paul
[1:32:56] learned that heartfelt contentment and
[1:33:00] gratitude should be thought of as a more
[1:33:03] genuine form of
[1:33:07] thriving not only a more genuine form of
[1:33:11] thriving but I would say a a a more
[1:33:15] valid form of thriving and and even
[1:33:18] Beyond genuine and even Beyond valid a
[1:33:21] more satisfying reality
[1:33:25] that what Paul learned is that there's a
[1:33:28] more satisfying form of thriving than
[1:33:32] the world is telling you about today
[1:33:34] there's a more valid form there's a more
[1:33:37] genuine form there's a more original
[1:33:39] form there's a more eternal form there's
[1:33:40] a more lasting form of thriving you can
[1:33:43] Thrive but who thriving are you
[1:33:48] following
[1:33:50] see and it's easier to accomplish than
[1:33:53] you might think
[1:33:54] that's why our verse Philippians 4:11
[1:33:56] not that I speak in respect of want for
[1:33:59] I have
[1:34:00] learned and the whatsoever State I am
[1:34:03] there withth to be
[1:34:06] content the New Living Translation reads
[1:34:09] the 12th verse like
[1:34:11] this I know how to live on almost
[1:34:16] nothing or with
[1:34:18] everything and that's two different
[1:34:21] lessons because you have to learn how to
[1:34:23] live live with nothing and be content
[1:34:25] but you also have to learn how to live
[1:34:26] with everything and not let it ruin

[1:34:47] situation whether it is with a full
[1:34:50] stomach or an empty with plenty or with
[1:34:54] little verse 13 for I here's the secret
[1:34:58] he learned I can do everything through
[1:35:01] Christ who gives me

[1:35:09] the age he was trusting the
[1:35:12] Lord you know so if you're going to if
[1:35:16] you're going to
[1:35:17] cash cash in on the precious life that
[1:35:21] God has given you if you're going to
[1:35:22] cast your precious life in with those
[1:35:26] who have decided to take the broad way
[1:35:29] that leads to destruction here are some
[1:35:31] things you should know first before you

[1:35:46] life and you're going to cast it in with
[1:35:49] those who are on the Broadway that leads
[1:35:51] to destruction because they want
[1:35:53] everything now and they're not willing
[1:35:56] to trade this short little insignificant
[1:35:58] vapor trail of a life for all
[1:36:01] eternity see friends I wouldn't miss
[1:36:04] heaven for the
[1:36:06] world would
[1:36:10] you if you're going to do that if I have
[1:36:13] failed tonight to convince you that you
[1:36:17] should cast in with the Lord you should
[1:36:19] throw your light in with Jesus that you
[1:36:22] should let him teach you about real
[1:36:24] thriving real peace real contentment
[1:36:28] real satisfaction not a chasing of the
[1:36:30] wind but if I haven't convinced you
[1:36:33] here's some things you should think
[1:36:35] about first before you begin down that
[1:36:37] broad path job

[1:37:02] and is cut down he fleeth also as a
[1:37:05] shadow and continueth not and Dost thou

[1:38:12] away for that you ought to say if the
[1:38:15] Lord will we shall live and do this and
[1:38:18] that friends the masses trade that
[1:38:21] Eternal day coming for this fleeting day
[1:38:23] that's passing away
[1:38:25] forever they trade an eternal day for
[1:38:28] this fleeting day a few days and full of
[1:38:32] trouble that only leads to pain and
[1:38:34] misery and they trade that for all the
[1:38:37] and they take that and trade away all
[1:38:38] the eternities the question I remember
[1:38:40] many years ago right in this pull Pit
[1:38:42] Brother John short ministering and he
[1:38:44] said you have to decide do you want
[1:38:46] riches or you want
[1:38:48] Treasures you want the riches of this
[1:38:50] Dying World or do you want the treasures
[1:38:52] awaiting in the the
[1:38:54] eternals
[1:38:56] amen that's where Jesus said you lay up
[1:38:58] your
[1:38:59] Treasures Zachariah 3:7 watch this
[1:39:03] Zechariah
[1:39:05] 3:7 thus saith the Lord of hosts he's
[1:39:08] the Lord speaking now Zechariah
[1:39:11] 3:7 all right thus sayith the Lord of
[1:39:15] hosts if ye will walk in my ways and if
[1:39:19] thou wil keep my charge then Thou shalt
[1:39:22] also judge mine house and shalt also
[1:39:25] keep my courts and I will give thee
[1:39:29] places to walk among these that stand by
[1:39:33] Count Me In Count Me In count I'll take
[1:39:36] that I'll take that I'll take curtain
[1:39:38] number one Hallelujah you can have this
[1:39:41] world Give Me Jesus you can have this
[1:39:44] world I'll take the next one
[1:39:47] hallelujah oh my Phil our text those
[1:39:50] that uh from Philippians 4 that 12th and
[1:39:53] 13
[1:39:54] verse Josh you won't be able to follow
[1:39:55] me this is from the whis translation
[1:39:57] listen at it again we read it from the
[1:40:00] NLT we read it from the KJV listen to
[1:40:02] the whis translation I know in fact is
[1:40:05] what Paul said I know in fact how to
[1:40:08] discipline myself in lowly
[1:40:12] circumstances I know in fact how to
[1:40:14] conduct myself when I have more than
[1:40:16] enough look at that contrast I want to
[1:40:19] read that again I know in fact how to
[1:40:21] discipline myself in lowly circumstances
[1:40:23] and I know in fact how to conduct myself
[1:40:25] when I have more than enough so it
[1:40:27] doesn't ruin him see in everything and
[1:40:31] in all things I have learned the secret
[1:40:35] both to be satiated and to be hungry and
[1:40:39] to have more than enough and to lack I
[1:40:42] am strong for in all things in the one
[1:40:46] who constantly infuses strength in
[1:40:51] me I would say to you today today

[1:40:57] allow the peace and the contentment that
[1:41:01] comes from doing right am you're going

[1:41:08] that comes from doing well you're going
[1:41:11] to want that to guide you I want to say
[1:41:14] to you tonight as we're getting ready to
[1:41:17] close seek that kind of threat

[1:41:29] you may be in health and prosper but
[1:41:31] even as your soul
[1:41:34] prosperous never despise the day of
[1:41:38] small
[1:41:39] things one of brother Dale's the whole
[1:41:42] Smith tribe one of their favorite things
[1:41:44] I've heard them say that this this has
[1:41:46] come out of their home so many times
[1:41:48] I've been sitting in the Smith home and
[1:41:51] I'll hear this little is much if God is
[1:41:53] in it
[1:41:55] I have that is I so adopted that so many
[1:41:57] years ago I'm here to tell you something
[1:41:59] friends that's a lesson Nehemiah and
[1:42:00] Ezra had to learn little as much don't
[1:42:03] despise the day of small things little
[1:42:05] as much if God is in it I'm going to
[1:42:07] tell you something friends in this fast
[1:42:09] paced world that's fueled by constant
[1:42:12] achievement and The NeverEnding Lust For
[1:42:18] more finding contentment in your
[1:42:21] personal growth finding contentment in
[1:42:24] your spiritual strength sometimes
[1:42:27] friends let's be honest that can feel
[1:42:29] like how do I even get that it can
[1:42:30] almost feel like a paradox I would like
[1:42:32] to feel that brother Jason I'd like to
[1:42:34] feel contentment in my spiritual
[1:42:35] strength I'd like to find contentment in
[1:42:38] my spiritual growth it just seems like a
[1:42:40] a paradox you know but but I'm here to
[1:42:43] tell you something friends if you can
[1:42:45] Master it like Paul did if you can
[1:42:48] Master the secret if you can Master the
[1:42:50] art of true cont repent and there's only
[1:42:54] one person who can teach it to you
[1:42:56] that's the Holy
[1:42:58] Spirit you can Master the art of
[1:43:01] contentment that's akin to discovering a
[1:43:04] secret path to happiness and well-being
[1:43:06] that will never run out that well will
[1:43:10] never run dry those breezes will never
[1:43:13] stop
[1:43:14] blowing oh it's not about stagnation or
[1:43:18] mediocrity you know I would just say to
[1:43:20] you tonight refine your
[1:43:22] journey did you know you're on a journey
[1:43:25] did you know that's what life is about
[1:43:27] you're headed
[1:43:28] somewhere life is a journey it's why God
[1:43:31] was so almost flabbergasted at Israel
[1:43:35] and they they had such such epic
[1:43:38] failures and God had helped them so much
[1:43:41] and they would and he would help them
[1:43:43] and he would bless them and they'd rise
[1:43:44] up and they'd love him and serve him and
[1:43:46] and it's almost like as soon as God
[1:43:48] turned his back then they' then they'
[1:43:50] get fat and lazy and and turn back to
[1:43:52] other gods who never done nothing for
[1:43:54] him but give them misery and sorrow and
[1:43:57] the only one that took care of him they
[1:43:59] constantly spat in his
[1:44:01] face and that astonished God it just
[1:44:04] astonished him that that they that they
[1:44:06] would actually he said he finally said
[1:44:09] to them in the Bible he said do you not
[1:44:11] even understand
[1:44:12] that you were just on a journey I was
[1:44:16] taking you somewhere you were in Egypt
[1:44:18] you were in your prisoners I brought you
[1:44:21] out I led you across the red see I slew
[1:44:23] all the enemies before you you crossed
[1:44:26] over took impossible citadels you didn't
[1:44:28] lose a man in battle I blessed your land
[1:44:31] I gave you houses you didn't build lands
[1:44:34] and Fields and Vineyards you didn't
[1:44:36] plant do you not even understand you
[1:44:38] were on a
[1:44:40] journey how did you let how did you let
[1:44:43] the prosperity that I gave you ruin you
[1:44:45] in that way
[1:44:47] am understand friends that contentment
[1:44:50] doesn't mean settling for Less it
[1:44:52] doesn't mean stressing over your future
[1:44:54] but what contentment means is valuing
[1:44:56] the
[1:44:58] present
[1:45:00] amen it's a great secret I would say to
[1:45:03] you tonight learn like Paul cultivate
[1:45:06] you know how to you cultivate a garden
[1:45:08] amen cultivate gratitude for small
[1:45:13] things there's a practical Little Nugget
[1:45:16] cultivate gratitude for small cultivate
[1:45:18] it learn to appreciate Little Things No
[1:45:22] matter how insignificant ific they may
[1:45:23] seem in the grand scheme of things as I
[1:45:26] said uh the Smith the Smith Mantra as
[1:45:28] little as much if God is in it see so
[1:45:31] finding balance in striving for
[1:45:34] more while being grateful for the now is
[1:45:39] so crucial if you don't get that point
[1:45:44] this whole sermon will be forgotten by
[1:45:47] you in a matter of
[1:45:49] days finding balance in striving for
[1:45:53] more while being grateful for the
[1:45:58] now let your end goal and form your
[1:46:01] thinking would you do it if your goal is
