[38:13] here you hear this you old men and give
[38:15] ear all you inhabitants of the land
[38:18] hath this been in your days or even in
[38:21] the days of your fathers
[38:23] tell your children of it and let your
[38:25] children tell their children and their
[38:26] children another generation
[38:28] that which the palmer worm hath left
[38:31] hath the locust eaten
[38:33] and that which the locust hath left hath
[38:35] the kink or worm eaten
[38:36] and that which the cankerworm hath left
[38:38] hath the caterpillar eaten
[38:40] awake you drunkards and weep and howl
[38:43] all you drinkers of wine
[38:45] because of the new wine for it is cut
[38:47] off from your mouth
[38:49] for a nation has come up upon my land
[38:52] strong and without number
[38:54] whose teeth are the teeth of a lion
[38:57] and he hath the cheek teeth of a great
[39:00] line
[39:01] he hath laid my vine waist and barked my
[39:04] fig tree
[39:05] he hath made it clean bear and cast it
[39:07] away the branches thereof are made
[39:09] white lament like a virgin girded with
[39:12] sackcloth for the husband of her youth
[39:15] the meat offering in the drink offering
[39:17] is cut off from the house of the lord
[39:19] the priests the lord's ministers mourn
[39:23] the field is wasted the land mourneth
[39:26] for the corn is wasted the new wine is
[39:28] dried up
[39:28] the oil languisheth be you ashamed o you
[39:32] husbandmen how
[39:34] all you vine dressers for the wheat and
[39:37] for the barley
[39:38] because the harvest of the field is
[39:40] perished
[39:41] the vine is dried up and the fig tree
[39:44] languisheth
[39:45] the pomegranate tree the palm tree also
[39:48] and the apple tree
[39:49] even all the trees of the field are
[39:51] withered because
[39:52] joy is withered away from the sons of
[39:55] men
[39:56] gird yourselves and lament you priests
[39:58] how you ministers of the altar
[40:01] come lie all night and sackcloth you
[40:03] ministers of my god
[40:05] for the mead offering and the drink
[40:06] offering is withholded
[40:08] from the house of your god sanctify you
[40:11] a fast
[40:12] call a solemn assembly gather the elders
[40:16] of
[40:16] and all the inhabitants of the land into
[40:18] the house of the lord your god
[40:20] and cry unto the lord alas for the day
[40:24] of the lord is at hand and as a
[40:26] destruction from the almighty shall it
[40:28] come
[40:29] is not the meat cut off before our eyes
[40:32] yea
[40:32] joy and gladness from the house of our
[40:35] god
[40:37] the seed is rotten under their clods the
[40:39] garners are laid desolate the barns are
[40:41] broken down
[40:42] for the corn is withered how do the
[40:45] beasts groan
[40:46] the herds of cattle are perplexed
[40:48] because they have no pasture
[40:50] yea the flocks of sheep are made
[40:52] desolate
[40:54] notice joel's then after his message
[40:58] and he gives the assessment the
[41:00] diagnosis
[41:01] of the condition of not just the people
[41:04] but all of the earth all of the land all
[41:07] of their possessions and then
[41:08] joel cries and he says o lord to thee
[41:11] will i cry

[41:15] of the wilderness and the flame hath
[41:17] burned all the trees of the field

[44:10] amen you can be seated this morning
[44:14] i'll take just a few minutes here
[44:17] and just recap i forgot to pray over
[44:19] this memo so i'll get this at the end
[44:23] that's yes that's my uncle ron yep so
[44:24] we'll pray for that
[44:26] at the end just don't let nobody don't
[44:28] let don't
[44:29] nobody let me forget that for the end
[44:32] i'll take some just a few moments here
[44:35] and a lot of this some of this will be a
[44:37] little bit of review but
[44:38] i believe it's important it's been just
[44:40] a few weeks since we spoke on this so
[44:42] we'll go over some of uh what we're
[44:45] reading about here
[44:46] in the book of job we took a lot of time
[44:48] to read all of chapter one
[44:50] and i believe it's going to be important
[44:52] for us to understand in the context
[44:55] of this promise that god
[44:59] gives and he gives a promise and he says
[45:01] for i will restore to you
[45:04] the years of the cankerworm the
[45:06] caterpillar the palmer worm
[45:08] and so to understand that promise or the
[45:10] significance of what god was promising
[45:13] you look at this time or the setting of
[45:16] joel
[45:17] and joel is going to speak to pre-exile
[45:21] before they're taken off into babylon
[45:23] he's going to speak in the time of
[45:25] uzziah that's when joel is going to be
[45:27] begin his or have his ministry and
[45:30] uzziah that was uh
[45:32] the golden years of israel it was a time
[45:35] of great
[45:36] increase when you think of uzziah you
[45:38] think of a time of great
[45:40] uh increase both in their economy
[45:43] in their military the administration
[45:46] that they were under
[45:47] it was a great time of success a great
[45:49] time of peace
[45:51] of prosperity of ease the bible would
[45:54] call it and you would read
[45:55] you'll read this in the bible and it
[45:57] calls it
[45:59] the years of fatness
[46:02] and it means the years when they're
[46:03] increased the years when there's plenty
[46:06] plenty enough to go around and there's
[46:09] not a lack for anything but it was a
[46:11] year of fatness and increase
[46:13] further than that it was a time of peace
[46:15] arrest
[46:17] where the land was resting the people
[46:19] were resting there was no
[46:20] war there was no famine
[46:23] it was a time for israel in this golden
[46:26] year
[46:27] golden years of uzziah for those 52
[46:30] years it's a time of great
[46:32] plenty and great increase it speaks of
[46:34] uzi and said his
[46:36] his fame spread as far as the border of
[46:38] egypt
[46:39] because he became very powerful man who
[46:42] is the success of his kingdom is second
[46:45] only to
[46:46] solomon who we know solomon was the real
[46:49] golden year
[46:50] for god's family in that era it was a
[46:53] time of great prosperity but
[46:55] joe's prophecy comes of restoration and
[46:58] we read in chapter one it speaks of
[47:02] that that this great plague that god had
[47:06] brought upon the land because we
[47:09] understand
[47:10] that for years god had been sending them
[47:12] joe was
[47:13] on the uh uh just on the hills of
[47:16] obadiah and and on the heels of that was
[47:19] another prophet who would come with a
[47:21] message from the lord
[47:23] and he was trying to get them to turn
[47:25] from their
[47:26] sin because in all of that plenty
[47:29] and in all of that time of increase and
[47:31] all of that time of success
[47:35] they had drifted they had fallen they
[47:37] had forgotten the lord
[47:39] and so god sends them a plague and i
[47:41] want you to notice
[47:42] joe's prophecy of restoration he tells
[47:45] us in chapter one of their natural
[47:47] condition
[47:48] and in chapter one it's the it's a let's
[47:51] a contrast
[47:52] because prior to the plague that god
[47:55] sends
[47:56] their vats are overflowing the oils
[47:59] flowing like a red
[48:00] olive oils flowing like a river
[48:03] and the pomegranate trees and the
[48:06] the the apple trees are loaded down with
[48:08] fruit it's a great time a
[48:10] spiritual condition uh our natural
[48:13] condition of great plenty
[48:15] but god's ultimate message from joel and
[48:18] his ultimate
[48:19] burden isn't concerning their natural
[48:22] condition
[48:23] so much but it's actually their
[48:26] spiritual
[48:27] condition you see to god
[48:31] our spiritual condition or our spiritual
[48:34] health is really all that really
[48:38] matters to god you know brother matt our
[48:41] health matters sure it does
[48:43] our our that we live the bible says the
[48:46] promise that we
[48:47] that we prosper it'd be in health sure
[48:49] to a child of god
[48:51] god saved you and there's promises that
[48:54] we have and
[48:55] god's concerned about all of those
[48:56] things but when it really comes down to
[48:59] it when you really
[49:00] narrow it down the most important thing
[49:03] to god
[49:05] is your spiritual health i hear the
[49:08] words of brother branham say i would
[49:10] rather
[49:10] eat so he said i would rather drink soda
[49:13] or branch water and eat soda crackers
[49:17] and he said but know that my spiritual
[49:19] condition
[49:20] i was healthy i was where i needed to be
[49:22] with god
[49:23] than to have all the riches of the world
[49:25] but my soul
[49:26] lost somewhere in sin amen
[49:29] i say amen to that you see our physical
[49:33] life our emotional life is
[49:34] has a significance and important but
[49:36] ultimately
[49:37] it's our spiritual condition that god is
[49:40] the most concerned about
[49:41] and so much that if god has to uh
[49:45] and let me say this this way because
[49:47] it's in the context of job
[49:48] notice what he says when he promises
[49:50] he'll restore
[49:51] he says and i will restore unto you the
[49:53] years of the locust and the canker worm
[49:55] and the caterpillar and the pomegranate
[49:57] did you ever notice
[49:58] he says my great army
[50:02] that i sent to you so hold on the
[50:05] cankerworm and the pommel worm and the
[50:06] caterpillar
[50:07] god sends a plague of locusts and those
[50:10] locusts devoured
[50:12] everything in the land of israel they
[50:14] devoured if you watch them we played a
[50:16] video the last time of the locust
[50:18] that would go and even just recently
[50:20] there was a great plague of locusts and
[50:22] outbreak
[50:23] and that they hatch and when they hatch
[50:25] they travel for hundreds of miles a day
[50:28] and then as they eat they they become
[50:30] grasshoppers and then they fly and then
[50:32] they swarm
[50:33] and then they devour everything in its
[50:36] path and there's nothing left they eat
[50:37] it bare
[50:38] all the way to the root and god
[50:41] sends them this and so his their
[50:44] spiritual condition is the biggest
[50:46] concern to god
[50:47] in so much that if he has to break your
[50:50] physical
[50:51] condition to fix your spiritual
[50:55] condition
[50:55] [Music]
[50:57] if he has to break your bank if he has
[50:59] to break
[51:00] oh no brother matt don't go there if he
[51:02] has to break your family if he has to
[51:04] disrupt your business if he has to
[51:06] disrupt
[51:07] disrupt your marriage to in order to
[51:10] somehow shake you and awaken you to
[51:14] get to the so that the surgeon can get
[51:16] to the root of the problem in the heart
[51:21] then the bible says he's a kind heavenly
[51:24] father and as the prophet of god says no
[51:27] real mother
[51:28] or father likes to spank the child or
[51:30] discipline them
[51:31] but he said if you really love them even
[51:34] if it hurts your feelings you'll correct
[51:35] the
[51:36] error that you see you say why does a
[51:38] parent do that
[51:39] because their ultimate condition my
[51:42] chill my
[51:43] child's ultimate outcome not that i
[51:45] don't look at the here and now
[51:46] but where are they going to be ahead
[51:48] what are they going to turn
[51:50] out to be their ultimate condition
[51:53] their their their their their what
[51:55] they're going to be in life
[51:57] as a mother and as a father is more
[51:59] important to you
[52:01] it's more important to you what they are
[52:04] becoming
[52:06] than what they are right now are you
[52:09] with me here this morning
[52:11] let me say this god cares more about
[52:13] where he's bringing you
[52:15] to than what it looks like right now
[52:19] somebody can grab a hold of that by
[52:21] faith god cares more about where you're
[52:24] going to be than where you're at right
[52:26] now
[52:26] and you say lord i don't understand
[52:28] what's happening and things seem out of
[52:30] place and
[52:30] the puzzle's not fitting in it looks
[52:32] like everything's just disarrayed and i
[52:34] can't make sense of my present
[52:36] i can't make sense of what god's doing
[52:38] right now but often god
[52:40] uses what's happening right now the
[52:43] pressure and the stress and the trouble
[52:45] and the struggle
[52:46] he's using that as a tool to bring you
[52:49] to what
[52:50] he wants you to be i'm glad i have a
[52:54] heavenly father
[52:54] like that that doesn't get discouraged
[52:57] by my failures right now
[52:59] in fact he doesn't even look at him
[53:00] right now he doesn't even get
[53:02] discouraged or worried about what he's
[53:04] what they're looking like right now
[53:05] because he knows i've got a plan and i'm
[53:07] bringing them to something right now
[53:09] i'm not going to look at the here and
[53:11] now and what i don't see or what i do
[53:13] see oh brother i just say lord if you're
[53:15] not discouraged then don't let me be
[53:17] discouraged but let me lift my hands up
[53:19] and say lord
[53:20] it doesn't matter what it looks like
[53:22] right now i believe you've got a plan
[53:24] you've got a purpose and you're bringing
[53:26] me to something you've envisioned
[53:31] as joel mentions this he says their vine
[53:34] was flourishing
[53:35] and there was the contrast but prior to
[53:37] the plague
[53:38] the vines flourishing the fig trees
[53:40] pomegranates the apples fruit trees
[53:42] flowing like a river
[53:43] but notice what is what doesn't it's
[53:46] just so
[53:47] clear in the bible it's so clear in our
[53:49] life
[53:50] oftentimes what does material goodness
[53:54] bring and that could mean money that can
[53:56] mean health that could mean good times
[53:58] whatever we call that
[54:00] what is material goodness a lot of times
[54:04] if we for a moment just hang up our
[54:06] angel wings and take our halos off of
[54:08] our heads sit them down here for a
[54:09] moment
[54:10] take those unbuckle those wings and be
[54:12] honest
[54:13] one be honest really with ourselves
[54:16] that sometimes the best natural
[54:18] conditions
[54:20] the times of plenty and fatness all
[54:22] often times leads to great
[54:24] spiritual poverty
[54:28] and sadly for some it eventually leads
[54:30] to spiritual
[54:32] death moses had already warned them
[54:35] long a long time in deuteronomy 6.
[54:38] if you could display that brother josh
[54:40] that would be good we're just going to
[54:41] wait for you just for a moment to
[54:43] display deuteronomy 6.
[54:44] i want you to listen to this warning
[54:46] from moses and i'm just trying to be
[54:48] good about my time here as i got just a
[54:50] lot to get to
[54:52] deuteronomy's chapter 6 verse 10 notice
[54:55] this is what moses says here in
[54:56] deuteronomy 6 10
[54:58] and it shall be when the lord thy god
[55:01] shall have brought thee into the land
[55:03] which he swore unto thy fathers to
[55:05] abraham to isaac to jacob to give the
[55:07] great and good cities notice the the the
[55:11] context here when he brings you over to
[55:13] give you good great and goodly cities
[55:16] which thou buildest not
[55:20] verse 11 and house is full of all
[55:24] good things what does that mean to a
[55:27] believer
[55:30] houses that are filled with
[55:33] good things you know as a christian
[55:37] your vessel your house is filled with
[55:40] good
[55:40] things amen you may not even realize
[55:42] some of those good things that god's
[55:44] placed in your house
[55:47] you say brother matt i just i look like
[55:48] a i i feel like i'm just a mess and i i
[55:51] just don't even i feel
[55:52] you know maybe no matter where you're
[55:54] spiritual you fall on the
[55:56] hot cold uh or i should say hot cold
[55:59] lukewarm spectrum
[56:01] wherever you feel like that today no
[56:03] matter where you fall
[56:05] in that as you come here to church on
[56:06] sunday morning let me just remind you
[56:09] that when god saved you and god cleaned
[56:11] you and god filled you no matter how
[56:13] distant you feel right now
[56:15] god has filled your house with good
[56:17] things
[56:19] your mind is filled with good things
[56:21] that you didn't put there
[56:23] your spirits filled with good things
[56:25] that you may not even know are there
[56:27] until the right circumstance and rights
[56:29] right uh
[56:30] variables line up and you get into a
[56:32] situation and then you react and you say
[56:34] i didn't even know that was i didn't i
[56:37] didn't know that was there but god's
[56:38] deposited something inside of you
[56:40] he's deposited good things he put joy
[56:44] sister chastity put joy in your heart
[56:46] and you didn't even
[56:47] you didn't buy it you didn't give your
[56:49] money you didn't you didn't earn it
[56:53] but god gave you a as the song says he
[56:55] put a heart he put a song in your heart
[56:58] that you didn't put there god put a joy
[57:00] in your heart that you
[57:01] you didn't buy you didn't purchase but
[57:03] god just gave it to you
[57:06] you may you may feel far away but you
[57:08] believe in god that's a good thing god
[57:10] put in your heart
[57:11] you may feel distant from god but you
[57:13] have a desire for the things of god
[57:15] that's a good thing he put in your house
[57:19] and he says he filled you with good
[57:21] things
[57:22] and well he says which thou notice this
[57:25] and house is full of good
[57:27] things which thou fillest
[57:31] not amen you didn't do it god did it
[57:36] amen and wells digged which thou digest
[57:39] not vineyards and olive trees which thou
[57:41] plant us not when thou shall have eaten
[57:44] and
[57:44] be full so when you've eaten when you've
[57:48] realized all of this when you've ate
[57:49] everything and you've just been
[57:50] eating on the good things of god and you
[57:53] didn't do anything for
[57:54] them you didn't ask for them and and you
[57:57] didn't earn them but god just gave them
[57:59] to you
[57:59] and you're eating and now you're full
[58:02] and then here comes the warning for
[58:03] moses verse 12
[58:05] then then at that moment beware
[58:11] lest thou forget the lord
[58:14] which brought thee forth out of the land
[58:16] of egypt
[58:18] from the house of bondage when you come
[58:22] into the land of the holy ghost you're
[58:24] going to realize there's promises
[58:26] there's there's there's there's uh
[58:29] good things in your house there's food
[58:32] on your table
[58:33] spiritually there's a heart and a soul
[58:36] that wants to serve the lord when you
[58:37] get over there
[58:38] you're going to realize your house is
[58:40] filled with good things that you didn't
[58:41] feel
[58:42] you didn't do this god did it wells that
[58:44] you can draw from that you didn't dig
[58:46] someone else dug let me give you one of
[58:48] those wells i didn't know i i forgot my
[58:50] bible i guess in the back if i could
[58:52] have my bible i would say
[58:53] here's a well that you can draw from
[58:56] that you didn't dig give me a give me a
[59:00] a spoken word book

[59:03] book i'd hold it up this morning and say
[59:05] here's a well that you didn't dig but
[59:08] you this morning can open it up and can
[59:11] draw
[59:11] from that well and you can pull out good

[1:00:00] faith in action man my part began to get
[1:00:03] stirred i began to feel faith you know
[1:00:05] what it was doing it was it was like a
[1:00:07] battery getting plugged in into a
[1:00:09] charger
[1:00:10] felt like my battery was at red flashing
[1:00:13] five percent

[1:00:28] find that charge and you plug in
[1:00:31] charging but everything works right you
[1:00:34] know what it did
[1:00:35] when you turn on a tape when you open
[1:00:36] the word of god you're taking your
[1:00:38] charge and you're plugging in and say
[1:00:40] lord
[1:00:40] charge me i feel weak i feel like my
[1:00:42] battery's draining
[1:00:43] but i want to charge i want to plug into
[1:00:46] the power of the holy spirit
[1:00:48] hallelujah amen he says well you dig not
[1:00:52] no no labor involved there's no sweat
[1:00:53] there's no stress there's no blisters
[1:00:56] there's no calluses
[1:00:58] when you'd work for something and you've
[1:01:01] did it with your hands
[1:01:02] and you've put your effort and you've
[1:01:04] put your labor and you've put your
[1:01:06] strength into it
[1:01:07] it becomes important to you it's
[1:01:09] valuable you protect it
[1:01:10] you lock it you put security cameras up
[1:01:13] you don't let nobody touch it because
[1:01:15] you've worked very hard for it
[1:01:19] but you see the holy ghost isn't that
[1:01:20] way it's a gift that god gives you
[1:01:24] those promises that god gives you you
[1:01:26] didn't work for them you didn't toy for
[1:01:28] them you didn't you didn't toil you
[1:01:29] didn't sweat there's no calluses god
[1:01:31] just freely
[1:01:32] you have received so freely give
[1:01:36] and god says because of that then beware
[1:01:39] lest you forget the lord
[1:01:45] he gives you good things oh let me move
[1:01:47] past this to just here for a moment
[1:01:49] we're just
[1:01:50] still in some review this is exactly
[1:01:53] what happens to israel in their greatest
[1:01:54] time of prosperity they forget the lord
[1:01:57] so what does god do he sends a plague is
[1:01:59] it to punish them
[1:02:00] is it to pick on them is it god who's
[1:02:02] angry and upset and go fine you won't
[1:02:04] serve me let me send some locusts your
[1:02:07] way and see what happens and god's up
[1:02:09] there
[1:02:09] you know some maniacal purpose listen
[1:02:11] friends
[1:02:12] how you view yeah what god is doing in
[1:02:16] your life
[1:02:17] how you view your trials is so important
[1:02:22] because if you view them as you've
[1:02:24] you've messed up and god's punishing you
[1:02:26] it will completely contort and distort
[1:02:29] your entire image
[1:02:30] and your perception of what god's doing
[1:02:32] and why he's doing it
[1:02:34] yes amen it's not to hurt you it's not
[1:02:37] listen
[1:02:37] everything god does is a good thing as
[1:02:40] brother john sings the song he's a good
[1:02:42] good father
[1:02:43] that means anything he brings in your
[1:02:45] life whether it causes pain
[1:02:47] or loss is a good thing
[1:02:52] why does he send it out of revenge not
[1:02:54] at all
[1:02:55] why does he send a plague of locusts is
[1:02:57] it because god's cruel no
[1:02:59] he does it because he's the surgeon
[1:03:01] trying to get to fix their spiritual
[1:03:03] condition because that's
[1:03:05] what's most important to him
[1:03:09] amen and let me say this here because i
[1:03:12] have it here on my notes and i feel
[1:03:13] inspired to say it
[1:03:14] no matter what god does in your life he
[1:03:17] had a reason
[1:03:19] and he had a good reason to do it amen
[1:03:22] amen you may not know why and you may
[1:03:25] not well what was the good reason i
[1:03:26] don't know i may not as job
[1:03:28] he didn't find out his entire life went
[1:03:31] to the grave not understanding until he
[1:03:32] seen his redeemer and then it all made
[1:03:36] sense
[1:03:37] you may not know the reason but he's got
[1:03:39] a good reason
[1:03:40] you say why brother matt how do you know
[1:03:42] that because he's a good good
[1:03:44] father amen that's what he is and
[1:03:46] whatever he does in your life he's a
[1:03:48] good father
[1:03:49] it's for my benefit
[1:03:52] notice what brother branham says here
[1:03:53] that you could put up the powerpoint
[1:03:55] there and the message leadership
[1:03:56] he says oh god i love this here let's
[1:03:59] notice brother branham's prayer here
[1:04:01] he says oh god let me go
[1:04:04] lord he says don't leave me
[1:04:08] behind you i just want to wait just for
[1:04:10] a moment there we go
[1:04:11] notice this prayer oh god let me go lord
[1:04:15] don't let don't leave me behind
[1:04:18] jesus let me go with you father

[1:04:24] to watch these tribulations
[1:04:26] coming on i don't want to stay here in
[1:04:27] this insanity i don't want to stand
[1:04:29] here when hideous sights the people
[1:04:32] losing their mind

[1:04:36] it's not there we go
[1:04:37] the people losing their mind we look at
[1:04:39] men trying to act like beasts and look
[1:04:41] like beasts and the women trying to look
[1:04:42] like animals with the paints on their
[1:04:44] face
[1:04:45] knowing that these things are predicted
[1:04:47] to happen that the thing will though
[1:04:49] going
[1:04:50] so insane till locusts will raise
[1:04:54] up with hair like women to haunt the
[1:04:56] women
[1:04:57] and teeth like lions and things like
[1:04:59] that you've said the mental condition of
[1:05:01] the people will be completely gone
[1:05:04] we see it in the making right now yes we
[1:05:06] do and he says
[1:05:08] restore to us the same mind
[1:05:14] the same mind
[1:05:17] of christ jesus our lord i want to give
[1:05:19] you a chance here
[1:05:21] just to raise your hand and grab a hold
[1:05:23] of that

[1:05:25] morning don't leave me behind jesus

[1:05:40] the entire world a little virus
[1:05:43] that has wrecked the whole world go read
[1:05:45] revelations 9.
[1:05:47] you'll find out what a plague is
[1:05:50] and you realize covet was just a little
[1:05:52] speck of dust
[1:05:56] the bible says that there's things
[1:05:57] coming upon the earth that men
[1:05:59] would literally have heart attacks at
[1:06:02] just the sight
[1:06:05] don't leave me here lord let me go with
[1:06:08] you father
[1:06:11] don't let me be here to experience why
[1:06:13] does god send those things to purge
[1:06:17] that's what it's for a purge it's it's
[1:06:19] to purge the world so
[1:06:21] what do i say lord i don't want to be
[1:06:22] part of that purge but in order to do
[1:06:24] that i've got to be part of this purge
[1:06:26] so lord let me be purged right now by
[1:06:29] the holy spirit purge me of anything
[1:06:31] that's not like you lord notice what he
[1:06:35] says here wake up in verse 5.
[1:06:38] you can just pause that here for a
[1:06:39] moment he says wake up
[1:06:41] uh he he wants what is he looking for
[1:06:44] look at joel chapter 2
[1:06:46] quickly if you could brother josh sorry
[1:06:47] to keep you going back and forth joel
[1:06:49] chapter 2 verse 12
[1:06:50] therefore also now saith the lord turn
[1:06:52] you even to me with all your heart
[1:06:54] with all your heart yes amen
[1:06:58] turn to me with oh
[1:07:01] lord have i done that come on
[1:07:04] have i turned to you with all my heart
[1:07:07] all that's within me
[1:07:08] and with fasting and with weeping and
[1:07:11] with mourning
[1:07:14] rind that means to tear
[1:07:17] and rend your heart not your garment
[1:07:23] that's what they would do a prophet
[1:07:24] would take burlap it was made of goat
[1:07:27] skin i believe if i'm correct it was
[1:07:28] made of goat's skin it was itchy
[1:07:30] they would take that burlap and they
[1:07:32] would wear it like a garment they would
[1:07:33] take their cloak
[1:07:34] and they would wear that burlap itchy
[1:07:36] garment for i forget how many
[1:07:38] days 11 days or something was many many
[1:07:41] days and they would then take
[1:07:43] ashes and they would they would take
[1:07:45] ashes and dump it all over the
[1:07:47] just in uncomfortable condition they'd
[1:07:48] walk through the city crying out to god
[1:07:50] what were they doing they were trying to
[1:07:52] make intercession they were interceding
[1:07:54] on behalf of the sins of the people they
[1:07:56] were saying god hold back your judgment
[1:07:58] forgive us lord of our evil forgive us
[1:08:00] that's why jesus says blessed is he who
[1:08:03] sighs and cries for the abominations
[1:08:05] done in his city
[1:08:07] he doesn't have a spirit of judgment of
[1:08:09] wipe them out god just tear the whole
[1:08:10] thing down annihilate them
[1:08:12] but he has a heart to say lord if
[1:08:14] there's even one
[1:08:15] save even one lord if there's even if
[1:08:18] there's ten
[1:08:19] abraham said well if there's five if
[1:08:21] there's one would you do it just for one
[1:08:22] god
[1:08:24] he says ridden's your heart and not your
[1:08:26] garment don't just come to me with your
[1:08:27] outward emotion
[1:08:29] and tears that's fine but make sure with
[1:08:32] those emotions and those tears that you
[1:08:34] cry is a heart that's rendered
[1:08:36] not your garment ring your heart what we
[1:08:39] need in this age is less
[1:08:41] conformity less external conformity
[1:08:46] and more internal transformation
[1:08:51] because we've had a lot of external
[1:08:53] conformity
[1:08:54] with no internal transformation amen
[1:08:59] he says rend your heart and turn unto
[1:09:01] the lord
[1:09:02] for he is gracious and merciful
[1:09:06] slow to anger and of great kindness and
[1:09:09] repentethium of
[1:09:11] the evil who knoweth if he will return
[1:09:14] and repent notice this what's god trying
[1:09:15] to sow he's trying to sow his word
[1:09:18] into this condition of this evil heart
[1:09:21] he's trying he's he's pushing he's
[1:09:23] he has a desire he knows what's around
[1:09:25] the corner because
[1:09:27] his his burden his passion his desire
[1:09:31] is to restore the years
[1:09:34] he wants to restore the pomegranate tree
[1:09:36] the other the apple tree he wants to
[1:09:38] restore the wine and the oil
[1:09:41] hallelujah but he's first in order to
[1:09:44] bring
[1:09:44] a restoration god first must have a
[1:09:47] heart that rinse
[1:09:53] and he preaches this message and you
[1:09:55] know what the reaction
[1:09:57] you know what the reaction of israel is
[1:09:59] after all of you read all of
[1:10:00] chapter 2 and you could just feel the
[1:10:03] weight of
[1:10:03] everything joel says you know what sadly
[1:10:07] the reaction
[1:10:08] that the bible records for most of the
[1:10:11] people who heard
[1:10:13] joel's sermon most of them
[1:10:17] went out and got drunk
[1:10:23] i want that just to sink just for a
[1:10:24] moment
[1:10:26] most of them who heard the convicting
[1:10:28] preaching
[1:10:29] the heart of god most of them
[1:10:33] just grabbed another beer amen
[1:10:37] most of them just became more
[1:10:40] intoxicated
[1:10:41] you see people will always have two
[1:10:44] different reactions
[1:10:46] to coming disaster amen
[1:10:49] some will prepare and repent
[1:10:53] others just get drunk
[1:10:56] amen listen to what brother branham says
[1:11:00] here go back if you could brother josh
[1:11:02] and the sudden secret going away of the
[1:11:05] church
[1:11:06] brother adam's speaking here of the
[1:11:08] attack on pearl harbor
[1:11:10] and he says and on the night and on the
[1:11:13] night
[1:11:14] just before the great attack the next
[1:11:16] morning there was a great dance or a big
[1:11:18] party given in pearl harbor itself
[1:11:22] and no matter how much they tried to say
[1:11:23] that the japs were coming they still
[1:11:25] would not
[1:11:26] take warning let's just look on them
[1:11:29] next slide for a few moments
[1:11:31] there's a little radio bulletin goes out
[1:11:34] a little piece in the corner of the
[1:11:36] paper
[1:11:36] about like a healing campaign would be
[1:11:38] advertised just a small place
[1:11:40] that the japs were on their road in the
[1:11:42] waters of the sea
[1:11:44] a great fleet was headed that way
[1:11:46] nonsense
[1:11:49] says the others we don't believe in no
[1:11:51] such a stuff as that
[1:11:54] what are you trying to scare us about
[1:11:57] and then we find getting close to the
[1:12:00] night
[1:12:01] i can see at the home place instead of
[1:12:03] them preparing
[1:12:04] for to get out of the city why the young
[1:12:07] girls were all putting on their new
[1:12:09] frocks and so forth
[1:12:11] they were going down to this great big
[1:12:13] jubilee they were going to have
[1:12:16] and also the officers of the army were
[1:12:18] just busy
[1:12:19] riding little passes so that the
[1:12:21] soldiers could all
[1:12:22] attend this party big drunken party and
[1:12:25] the trunks were
[1:12:26] trucks were roaring and humming bringing
[1:12:28] in their best of beer
[1:12:30] and their wine and stuff for this party
[1:12:32] and all the time
[1:12:35] the japanese fleet on its road there and
[1:12:38] they fell
[1:12:39] to hear the warning
[1:12:42] and as the sun began to set they all
[1:12:45] gathered
[1:12:46] in this great tavern of a place maybe on
[1:12:49] the
[1:12:50] side somewhere the bartender polishing
[1:12:52] the bar or something said something like
[1:12:54] this
[1:12:54] say did you hear the rumor come on
[1:12:59] nah i don't believe i did said the man
[1:13:02] he spoke to
[1:13:03] oh yes they say something about a
[1:13:05] japanese fleet
[1:13:07] let me i just lost it here he says oh
[1:13:09] yes they say something about a japanese
[1:13:11] fleet
[1:13:11] be coming this way and then someone else
[1:13:14] drops in on the conversation
[1:13:16] a young silly girl bounces up there and
[1:13:18] sticks her foot up on the bar and said
[1:13:20] you gloomy headed warts
[1:13:22] don't you know that we're here for to
[1:13:24] have a good time
[1:13:26] and not talk about war
[1:13:32] if that isn't just about the way the
[1:13:34] world is saying today about the coming
[1:13:37] of the lord
[1:13:38] you old-fashioned fogey back numbers
[1:13:40] what makes you dress and act and do the
[1:13:42] way you do
[1:13:44] but we're looking for that secret
[1:13:46] setting appearing of the lord
[1:13:49] for there's something in the air
[1:13:52] a message of the holy spirit that tells
[1:13:55] us the coming
[1:13:57] is at hand why are you why why brother
[1:14:00] matt why
[1:14:00] why are we doing this listen what he
[1:14:02] says he says oh and he says oh
[1:14:04] you don't don't believe much of nonsense
[1:14:06] you're all worried we're your fog he
[1:14:08] preaching things like that
[1:14:09] brother man says they say why do you
[1:14:10] dress like that why do you why do you
[1:14:12] act like that why do you do is it
[1:14:14] because a preacher told me to
[1:14:15] no that's not why is it because you got
[1:14:18] some book or some code you're trying to
[1:14:20] line up to
[1:14:21] i don't know about you but that's not
[1:14:22] why i live the way that i live
[1:14:24] is it out of some kind of fear in some
[1:14:26] way you were raised nope ain't got
[1:14:28] nothing to do with it
[1:14:29] then why because there's something in
[1:14:31] the air
[1:14:33] there's a message of the holy spirit can
[1:14:35] you hear it i can hear it
[1:14:37] i can hear it whispering and echoing
[1:14:39] into my heart that there's a sudden
[1:14:41] secret catching away of the bride that's
[1:14:44] why i live the way that i live
[1:14:46] that's why i assemble myself at church
[1:14:48] that's why i say amen to the word of god
[1:14:50] that's why i wake up and pray that's why
[1:14:52] i read my bible that's why i hear the
[1:14:54] word of
[1:14:55] a vindicated prophet because there's
[1:14:56] something stirring in the air
[1:15:00] [Applause]
[1:15:04] he says then when the big shindig went
[1:15:06] on next quote oh it must have been a
[1:15:08] horrible thing that night
[1:15:10] first said that sometime during the
[1:15:11] night that took a young lady a beautiful
[1:15:13] built young girl stripped her clothes
[1:15:15] from her put on put her in a little
[1:15:17] wagon with just one underneath garmin
[1:15:18] i'll run her down the street and so
[1:15:20] forth just having a big time
[1:15:21] it's a real story brother madam's
[1:15:23] reading from just running around telling
[1:15:25] you
[1:15:25] having a big time and all the time all
[1:15:28] the time all
[1:15:29] during all of the party during all of
[1:15:30] the frolic during all of the show
[1:15:33] all the time
[1:15:36] the japanese was gaining ground
[1:15:39] coming right on and then the next
[1:15:42] morning when the men on the post of duty
[1:15:44] and the airplane signal watching and so
[1:15:45] forth had been out all night drunk
[1:15:48] and running around with these women and
[1:15:49] so forth was so drowsy
[1:15:52] and upset the next morning from the big
[1:15:54] party

[1:18:59] vigilant i want to be
[1:19:00] ready at the coming of the lord jesus
[1:19:05] so joel gives them this prophecy now
[1:19:07] notice this here
[1:19:09] brother brandon begins to tell this
[1:19:10] story and he begins to tell how he was
[1:19:13] walking he preached preaching on
[1:19:15] pomegranate locust cankerworm and
[1:19:16] caterpillar
[1:19:17] he says not long ago i was thinking i
[1:19:19] was way up in canada and i was riding
[1:19:22] one night i'd been way back about 40 50
[1:19:26] miles thousand miles from a hard top
[1:19:27] road last fall
[1:19:29] was back there a hunting and when i was
[1:19:32] riding out through the moonlight
[1:19:34] i'd come to where there was a big old
[1:19:36] burn over
[1:19:37] you know what that is a like a
[1:19:39] controlled burn
[1:19:40] and he says that come where there was a
[1:19:42] big old burn over there was a great big
[1:19:45] bunch of
[1:19:45] great big tall stately pines
[1:19:49] and the moon was shining on them he was
[1:19:50] there at night time
[1:19:52] the moon was shining on them it looked
[1:19:54] like a graveyard
[1:19:56] a spooky looking place and he says
[1:19:59] and there came a wind coming down
[1:20:03] and the wind began to hit them and
[1:20:05] they'd go
[1:20:06] moo
[1:20:09] [Music]
[1:20:11] just a mournful sound i stood out looked
[1:20:15] at it a little bit and i thought of this
[1:20:17] scripture right here he's reading
[1:20:19] joel chapter 2. i thought of this
[1:20:22] scripture right here
[1:20:24] yes sir those trees put me in a mind of
[1:20:27] some of these great big fine
[1:20:29] spired churches standing up here just
[1:20:32] as dead as a door now
[1:20:36] wow he says i stood even dead as a
[1:20:38] doornail the next slide
[1:20:39] even the pommel worms ate all the bark
[1:20:41] off of them and everything else the
[1:20:43] the fiery trials has blazed all the
[1:20:45] spirit away from it
[1:20:47] and there's nothing left but a big
[1:20:49] stature
[1:20:51] just as dead as it can be
[1:20:56] keep going just as dead as can be and
[1:20:58] when the rushing mighty wind comes from
[1:21:00] heaven the only thing they can do is
[1:21:02] groan and carry on and say it ain't
[1:21:04] so that's right hardly knowing anything
[1:21:08] that's right and he says they say days
[1:21:11] of miracles has passed just every time
[1:21:13] god sends a revival
[1:21:14] and signs and wonders begin to come up
[1:21:17] and fall around the people
[1:21:18] and things like that they say all the
[1:21:20] days of miracles is past
[1:21:23] he says what the power worm left the
[1:21:25] caterpillar eaten
[1:21:26] what the methodist left the baptist
[1:21:28] eaten what the baptist left the
[1:21:30] presbyterian eaten
[1:21:31] what the presbyterian left the
[1:21:33] pentecostal eden until it's got to a
[1:21:35] place
[1:21:36] god why you just you he says you strip
[1:21:39] the tree of everything it's got
[1:21:42] all the power all the joy
[1:21:45] all the good things that god give to his
[1:21:47] church on the day of pentecost they've
[1:21:49] tore it out
[1:21:51] nothing left but a big church name
[1:21:54] huh ha hallelujah
[1:21:58] here brother branham do that
[1:22:02] like a spooky
[1:22:05] hallelujah brother says that's what i
[1:22:08] was reminded of this great big burn over
[1:22:09] this forces great big stately pines
[1:22:12] the outward shell of those pines of what
[1:22:14] used to be
[1:22:17] and when the rushing mighty wind of the
[1:22:19] holy spirit and god begins to move
[1:22:27] what's the matter watch the same thing
[1:22:30] you've took the route of the dead tree
[1:22:33] amen
[1:22:34] what the pomera worm left the
[1:22:35] caterpillar the baptist took the
[1:22:37] shouting away from the methodists
[1:22:39] one eats this and one eats that till
[1:22:41] they strip the church down
[1:22:43] until they got them setting just as dead
[1:22:46] as a doornail that's right no spirit
[1:22:49] no shouting no joy no
[1:22:52] peace no healing no nothing high
[1:22:56] he says how oh my what the methodist
[1:22:59] left the baptist eaten what the baptist
[1:23:01] left the caterpillar eaten
[1:23:02] or some other church and this one eat
[1:23:04] this and this took that away
[1:23:06] and this took that away you haven't got
[1:23:08] nothing but just a church creed
[1:23:13] and brother adam says you know that's
[1:23:15] the truth yes
[1:23:16] amen you know that's the truth
[1:23:20] that's the truth what one left the other
[1:23:22] eat
[1:23:23] until you ain't got nothing but a big
[1:23:26] dead
[1:23:27] tree and every time god sends a big rush
[1:23:30] of glory down just sit there and moan
[1:23:33] and say i don't believe it
[1:23:34] it's psychology it's this it's that it's
[1:23:37] this it's that
[1:23:38] we'll move dead from the roots twice
[1:23:41] dead
[1:23:41] plucked up by the roots it's a sad
[1:23:44] looking day
[1:23:45] amen it's a sad looking day when joel
[1:23:48] looked at that and saw that
[1:23:50] he said but god said i will restore
[1:23:54] saith the lord i can hear brother
[1:23:57] branham on that tape he says hallelujah
[1:23:59] if it wasn't in there i wouldn't know
[1:24:01] how to preach it
[1:24:02] in other words he's looking at the bible
[1:24:03] and he looks at the condition it looks
[1:24:05] at the church
[1:24:05] and he says what's it going to do i
[1:24:07] think they can't they they can't go in
[1:24:09] the rapture the way that they are
[1:24:10] they're in the condition that they are
[1:24:12] and they can't do nothing about it
[1:24:13] brother branham says but then i look
[1:24:15] down and it says but i
[1:24:16] will restore he says if it wasn't in
[1:24:19] there i wouldn't know how to preach it
[1:24:20] but i will restore saith the lord
[1:24:24] i will keep it there i will restore

[1:27:20] it was a seed church it was the original
[1:27:23] church
[1:27:24] it was the beginning church i want to
[1:27:26] read you here
[1:27:27] just for a moment i want to read you
[1:27:30] something by a man
[1:27:32] named cushing biggs hassle lived back
[1:27:35] way back i think he died in 1928
[1:27:38] and he has a book here you can get from

[1:27:41] a pdf i thought it was just so good i
[1:27:43] wish i could
[1:27:43] display it for you to read it just so
[1:27:46] you could follow along with me but i'm
[1:27:47] just going to read it you just listen
[1:27:50] this is the 12 marks of the apostolic
[1:27:54] church
[1:27:55] listen to what he says about this first
[1:27:57] church
[1:27:59] the church of the first century
[1:28:02] was a spiritual kingdom set up in the
[1:28:05] world
[1:28:06] by the son of god and fulfillment of the
[1:28:08] jewish economy
[1:28:10] and in opposition to all other religions
[1:28:12] of the earth
[1:28:14] and this militant kingdom of emmanuel
[1:28:18] notwithstanding the combined secular
[1:28:20] powers of the world
[1:28:22] progressed to such an extent that in
[1:28:24] about
[1:28:25] 70 years after the crucifixion of christ
[1:28:28] it pervaded portions of every province
[1:28:31] of the roman empire in it is an
[1:28:34] aggressive principle
[1:28:36] against sin though purely of love to
[1:28:40] mankind
[1:28:41] that will never cease its action until
[1:28:44] time shall be no more
[1:28:47] many errors had crept into the church
[1:28:49] from time to time
[1:28:51] in different parts of the world but that
[1:28:54] system of discipline which had been
[1:28:56] established by
[1:28:57] christ and his apostles had proved
[1:29:00] effectual
[1:29:01] in removing these errors in faith in
[1:29:04] practice
[1:29:05] the apostolic age is the fountainhead
[1:29:10] of the christian church as an organized
[1:29:13] society
[1:29:14] separate and distinct from the jewish
[1:29:17] synagogue it is preeminently
[1:29:21] the age of the holy spirit
[1:29:25] the age of inspiration
[1:29:28] and of legislation for all subsequent
[1:29:32] ages here springs
[1:29:36] i love how he writes that in its
[1:29:38] original
[1:29:39] freshness and purity the living water
[1:29:43] of the new creation christianity
[1:29:47] comes down from heaven as a supernatural
[1:29:50] fact
[1:29:52] yet long predicted and prepared for and
[1:29:55] adapted to the deepest wants of human
[1:29:57] nature
[1:29:59] signs and wonders are extraordinary
[1:30:01] demonstrations of the spirit
[1:30:03] for the conversion of the unbelieving
[1:30:05] jews and heathens
[1:30:07] attend its entrance into this world of
[1:30:09] sin
[1:30:11] it takes up its permanent abode with our
[1:30:14] fallen
[1:30:14] race to transform it gradually without
[1:30:17] war and bloodshed
[1:30:19] by a quiet leaven-like process into a
[1:30:22] kingdom of truth and righteousness
[1:30:24] in virtue of this listen
[1:30:28] in virtue of this original purity vigor
[1:30:31] and beauty and the permanent success
[1:30:35] of primitive christianity the very
[1:30:37] beginning
[1:30:39] i want you to contrast that to what the
[1:30:41] prophet of god says i want you to listen
[1:30:43] to this listen just listen to some of
[1:30:44] these quotes that i have here
[1:30:46] and he's brother and this is palmer worm
[1:30:47] locust cankerworm caterpillar
[1:30:49] now we know that we can only build a
[1:30:52] church
[1:30:53] first upon the material that god gave us
[1:30:56] to build it with can you say man to that
[1:30:59] that's all we have and i know this is
[1:31:01] strong that it's on tape hundreds of
[1:31:03] people around the world will hear it
[1:31:05] but before we can have a building of a
[1:31:07] church of god we will have to restore
[1:31:09] back
[1:31:10] all those things that these insects
[1:31:13] has eaten out of it we have to go back
[1:31:16] and find out what the insects ate
[1:31:18] we just heard about it and before this
[1:31:21] vine of the lord the grapevine he's
[1:31:23] the vine we're the branches before we
[1:31:26] can
[1:31:26] ever find out or the church can stand in
[1:31:29] its formal
[1:31:30] and original power we'll have to go back
[1:31:33] and find out what these insects ate and
[1:31:35] that
[1:31:35] church will have to be restored back
[1:31:38] to that or it will never stand in its
[1:31:42] power
[1:31:43] and glory of its first standing
[1:31:46] i want to be so clear on what we're
[1:31:49] teaching here today
[1:31:51] the true church is a continuation
[1:31:55] of this church say brother matt what did
[1:31:58] the message come to restore
[1:32:00] a message of restoration to go back
[1:32:04] to the first church i hope you catch the
[1:32:07] significance of that my brother my
[1:32:09] sister
[1:32:10] we've not been restored back to 1947
[1:32:13] we've not been restored back to the
[1:32:15] thoughts of a kentucky hillbilly
[1:32:17] that's not what wasn't about stories and
[1:32:19] hunting stories and fishing stories
[1:32:21] we've been restored back to the original
[1:32:24] faith of the apostolic
[1:32:26] church amen and if we're not
[1:32:30] then we're not anything amen we're just
[1:32:33] the name
[1:32:34] of a stately pine that used to be
[1:32:37] amen if we're not restored back to that
[1:32:40] i hope you catch the significance of
[1:32:42] that today
[1:32:43] what was the message to do what was it
[1:32:45] to accomplish
[1:32:47] it was to turn the hearts of the
[1:32:49] children that's me
[1:32:50] that's you back to the faith
[1:32:54] or the experience or the preaching
[1:32:57] or the doctrine or the practice the
[1:33:00] practices that's what acts means it
[1:33:02] means the practices
[1:33:05] a message of restoration to restore us
[1:33:07] back to the
[1:33:08] apostolic message of the apostle paul
[1:33:11] amen this is the very reason brother
[1:33:14] branham could stand
[1:33:15] in the in the vision when he goes
[1:33:17] remember remember when he's standing
[1:33:18] there and he says
[1:33:19] well he says the judge is there will
[1:33:21] paul's group be accepted
[1:33:24] and he says yes he says well then praise
[1:33:26] god he says then that means we'll be
[1:33:28] accepted
[1:33:28] because i preached exactly what paul
[1:33:31] preached
[1:33:32] and he says in the voices of thousands
[1:33:34] of people echoed out we're resting on
[1:33:37] that
[1:33:38] that's our hope that's our rest that's
[1:33:40] our that's our that's our faith
[1:33:43] that we've been restored back to the
[1:33:44] original faith of the apostolic church
[1:33:49] so if we don't match if we don't match
[1:33:53] the pattern then do we throw out the
[1:33:56] pattern
[1:33:58] and say well we just need a new age
[1:33:59] gospel with we need
[1:34:02] we need a new way of looking at this
[1:34:05] we need to dumb it down as as our
[1:34:08] pastor's been preaching we need to
[1:34:10] dim the light come on you know just dim
[1:34:13] it down
[1:34:14] and and we need something else no no no
[1:34:16] if if we don't match the pattern we
[1:34:18] don't throw out the pattern we don't we
[1:34:20] don't
[1:34:20] cut a pattern bigger to fit us we say
[1:34:24] lord hold us down
[1:34:27] amen that's my desire
[1:34:30] that i fit the pattern that's what
[1:34:32] brother madam says
[1:34:34] he says and the church will have to be
[1:34:35] restored back to that or it'll never
[1:34:37] stand in its power
[1:34:38] and glory of its first standing
[1:34:41] it goes on and on and on now the first
[1:34:44] thing
[1:34:44] i don't i want to save time because i
[1:34:46] don't have these and it's ready but just
[1:34:48] listen
[1:34:49] the first thing the church was
[1:34:50] established on the day of pentecost
[1:34:53] peter peter preached the inauguration
[1:34:55] sermon service
[1:34:57] when the church was born the christian
[1:34:59] church was
[1:35:00] born on the day of pentecost amen and
[1:35:03] god is infinite
[1:35:04] infinite meaning he can't change
[1:35:07] his church must remain as it was
[1:35:12] at the beginning the church
[1:35:15] must remain the same as
[1:35:18] it was we found out that the foundation
[1:35:22] the foundation what we build our church
[1:35:25] upon
[1:35:26] listen our church here today bethel
[1:35:28] tabernacle
[1:35:29] is not built on the personality of jason
[1:35:32] watkins
[1:35:33] the church and he's listening i
[1:35:35] guarantee he's saying amen the church is
[1:35:37] not built on the personality of jason to
[1:35:39] mars or matt watkins or
[1:35:41] what whoever you want to name the song
[1:35:43] leaders the deacons
[1:35:45] the church isn't built on the ideas
[1:35:49] of a ministry team the foundation of the
[1:35:53] church
[1:35:54] is not even built on the doctrines or
[1:35:57] stories
[1:35:58] of the message of the hour
[1:36:02] but actually the church is built on the
[1:36:04] foundation
[1:36:06] of the pentecostal church the original
[1:36:10] apostolic church
[1:36:13] prophet of god didn't come to lay a new
[1:36:15] foundation
[1:36:16] but he came the message came to restore
[1:36:18] us back to the foundation
[1:36:20] already laid
[1:36:23] i know we took a different gear but this
[1:36:25] is just important this morning
[1:36:27] he says after we found out that the
[1:36:28] foundation must be original it must go
[1:36:30] back to the foundation
[1:36:31] it must go back to where it was the vine
[1:36:35] if something's wrong with it the vine's
[1:36:37] not operating
[1:36:38] let's go back and find out what's wrong
[1:36:40] friend you should do this in your own
[1:36:41] life
[1:36:43] if something's not operating don't blame
[1:36:45] the preacher don't blame the church
[1:36:47] don't blame the message
[1:36:49] go back and make sure you're built on
[1:36:51] the right
[1:36:52] foundation glory
[1:36:56] amen it must go back he says if it was
[1:36:58] divine something's wrong with it
[1:37:00] if the vine is not operating let's go
[1:37:01] back and find out what's wrong one of
[1:37:02] the first things i'd like to mention is
[1:37:03] something that's going away from the
[1:37:04] church
[1:37:05] one of the main things is faith
[1:37:08] the people don't have faith today like
[1:37:10] they had in that day some kind of a
[1:37:12] cankerworm or some sort got in and ate
[1:37:14] it off the lifeline
[1:37:15] ate off the lifeline of faith
[1:37:19] he says but i believe that there's a
[1:37:20] real genuine gift of the holy ghost and
[1:37:22] we earnestly contend for that
[1:37:25] we stand for it we believe it saints
[1:37:28] speak with tongues listen i don't they
[1:37:31] say i don't believe in divine healing i
[1:37:33] don't believe in a bunch of fanaticism
[1:37:35] but we do believe there is a god and he
[1:37:37] heals the sick
[1:37:39] and that he's the same yesterday today
[1:37:42] and forever amen
[1:37:45] if god brought forth his first branch
[1:37:49] out of that vine was a pentecostal
[1:37:51] branch
[1:37:52] with power with visions revelations
[1:37:56] healings sanctifications holy spirit
[1:38:00] the next branch will be the same
[1:38:03] thing amen will be the same
[1:38:07] thing are you here this morning
[1:38:11] brother and begin he goes over this i
[1:38:13] don't have all the time just to read
[1:38:14] these over and over and over again
[1:38:17] but but the point is it was a
[1:38:20] restoration
[1:38:21] back to the original faith
[1:38:24] the original church amen
[1:38:28] the third the church going back to this
[1:38:31] this uh article written year many years
[1:38:34] ago
[1:38:35] the church of the first century forms
[1:38:37] the standard
[1:38:39] and example for the church of all
[1:38:42] future ages listen how he says this
[1:38:45] should there now
[1:38:46] exist an on earth a body of professed
[1:38:50] christians who occupy the same ground
[1:38:54] in faith and practice as that of the
[1:38:58] church of the first century they are
[1:39:00] right
[1:39:02] and if any should be found occupying
[1:39:06] a different position then they are
[1:39:09] wrong the true church of christ
[1:39:13] and false or nominal churches
[1:39:16] are to be compared no matter what
[1:39:18] brother adam says it says you're you're
[1:39:19] to compare every church
[1:39:21] with this first pattern this first
[1:39:23] church in fact he goes further and says
[1:39:25] then the messenger to that
[1:39:26] age so that alpha age will typify or
[1:39:29] pattern himself after the apostle paul
[1:39:32] amen listen to this the 12 marks and
[1:39:35] we're not going to go through all of
[1:39:36] them
[1:39:37] the 12 marks of the apostolic church
[1:39:39] here's the first mark
[1:39:40] listen close the apostolic church
[1:39:43] consisted only of those
[1:39:45] persons the apostolic church
[1:39:48] consisted only
[1:39:51] of those persons who had been
[1:39:54] convicted of sin by the holy spirit amen
[1:39:59] and who had given signs of repentance
[1:40:02] towards god and faith in the lord jesus
[1:40:06] christ as the son of god
[1:40:08] their faith was the faith of
[1:40:11] god's elect a steadfast
[1:40:15] and earnest adherence to the doctrines
[1:40:18] of the apostles and prophets
[1:40:20] including the total depravity of the
[1:40:23] human race and consequence of the fall
[1:40:25] of our first parents
[1:40:27] the special eternal election of god's
[1:40:29] people to everlasting life just stay
[1:40:32] with me here
[1:40:32] the particular redemption purchased by
[1:40:35] the blood of christ for
[1:40:36] all of his people the effectual calling
[1:40:39] notice i'm just going to move through
[1:40:40] some of this quickly
[1:40:43] let me let me get to the part i would
[1:40:44] like to read uh
[1:40:46] he says here he says
[1:40:50] the jewish and heathen doctrine of
[1:40:51] salvation by human works
[1:40:53] they utterly refused while they heartily
[1:40:57] embraced as their hope
[1:40:59] the christian and bible doctrine of a
[1:41:02] free
[1:41:02] and full salvation by the sovereign
[1:41:05] grace of god
[1:41:07] in other words the first
[1:41:10] and chief mark of the
[1:41:13] apostolic church was a regenerated
[1:41:17] and converted church who had been
[1:41:21] born of the holy spirit
[1:41:24] who had a vital revealed experimental
[1:41:28] religion who were quickened circumcised
[1:41:32] in heart
[1:41:33] a new creation beloved of the lord
[1:41:37] children of god the saved added
[1:41:40] to the church of god the elected vessels
[1:41:43] of mercy who worshipped god in
[1:41:46] spirit and in truth
[1:41:50] living stones this is all the church
[1:41:53] consisted of
[1:41:54] living stones built upon a spiritual
[1:41:57] house
[1:41:58] a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:42:01] sacrifices accepted to god
[1:42:03] by jesus christ a chosen generation
[1:42:06] a royal priesthood a holy nation
[1:42:09] a peculiar people that they should show
[1:42:12] forth the praises of him who had called
[1:42:14] them out of the darkness
[1:42:16] into his marvelous light amen
[1:42:21] the first mark of the first church
[1:42:25] consisted only of those who were born
[1:42:28] of the spirit of god amen
[1:42:32] only those who were regenerated by the
[1:42:35] baptism
[1:42:36] of the holy ghost amen amen
[1:42:39] the promise is to you and to your
[1:42:42] children
[1:42:43] and are them that are afar off as many
[1:42:46] as the lord our god shall
[1:42:48] call the promise is unto you amen
[1:42:52] say brother matt why why is that so
[1:42:54] important because it's the foundation of
[1:42:56] the church
[1:42:57] it's the beginning of the church i i'm
[1:42:59] just going to say this here today i'm
[1:43:00] going to i'm going to preach right
[1:43:02] through a spirit of resistance this
[1:43:03] morning
[1:43:04] that is the truth of the true apostolic
[1:43:07] church
[1:43:08] regardless of how the the world has
[1:43:10] watered it down
[1:43:12] the world has redefined it the world has
[1:43:14] re-explained it
[1:43:15] as putting your name on a book or just
[1:43:17] saying you believe or repeating a
[1:43:19] sinner's prayer
[1:43:20] or saying you have faith and mental
[1:43:22] knowledge of of
[1:43:23] jesus the first church mark
[1:43:26] characteristic
[1:43:27] was a church who was filled with the
[1:43:29] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:43:31] they were regenerated by an experience
[1:43:34] in the holy ghost by a new birth
[1:43:37] and my brother my sister i'll make it as
[1:43:38] clear as it needs to be if we have not
[1:43:41] came to that it doesn't matter what we
[1:43:43] call ourselves
[1:43:45] we're just that old stately pine amen
[1:43:49] and that's why when the wind of the holy
[1:43:50] ghost blows there's no reaction there's
[1:43:52] no moving of the spirit there's no joy
[1:43:54] there's no dancing there's no
[1:43:56] shouting we don't go back and blame the
[1:43:59] preacher we don't blame the message we
[1:44:00] don't blame how it was preached we blame
[1:44:03] our experience amen
[1:44:06] amen
[1:44:10] what was the mark of that first church
[1:44:12] they were baptized
[1:44:14] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:44:17] they were filled with the holy spirit
[1:44:20] they had
[1:44:20] signs and wonders miracles
[1:44:26] following their life that's what the
[1:44:29] bible says
[1:44:30] that's what that's what brother branham
[1:44:31] says he says they're not chasing they're
[1:44:32] not sign
[1:44:33] seekers we don't chase signs signs chase
[1:44:36] us
[1:44:39] that's the you say brother matt what is
[1:44:40] that that's the real true pentecostal
[1:44:42] church
[1:44:42] that's what we've been restored back to
[1:44:44] that's what the message came to turn
[1:44:46] your heart back too
[1:44:47] that's what it means when it says i will
[1:44:49] restore to you
[1:44:50] all the years of the locus and the
[1:44:52] caterpillar and the palmer worm
[1:44:54] all the great army all the things that
[1:44:56] they stripped away
[1:44:57] i will restore it back to you what's he
[1:44:59] going to give a true experience in the
[1:45:01] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:45:03] he's going to give a true experience
[1:45:05] that causes you to
[1:45:06] turn away from the things of sin to
[1:45:08] change your desires where you don't lust
[1:45:11] after the things of the world
[1:45:12] but you start longing for the things of
[1:45:14] god he sanctifies you and fills you with
[1:45:16] the spirit
[1:45:17] [Music]
[1:45:19] no one has to beg you to come to church
[1:45:21] no one has to beg you to
[1:45:22] live right to dress right to talk right
[1:45:25] no one has to beg you to do that
[1:45:27] it's an it's a fountain that's flowing
[1:45:29] from the inside
[1:45:31] when your foundation is right that's
[1:45:33] what it will produce
[1:45:36] that's what it will produce when your
[1:45:37] foundation is right
[1:45:39] listen to what brother adam says here

[1:45:42] we've been late let's just close
[1:45:44] listen what brother branham says what

[1:45:51] in there i wouldn't know how to preach
[1:45:53] it
[1:45:53] but i will restore saith the lord i

[1:46:22] bend with it no bark on it
[1:46:26] to make it flexible yes
[1:46:29] amen you know what you got to be as a
[1:46:31] believer you got to be
[1:46:32] flexible you don't want your experience
[1:46:36] to grow starchy and cold and you can't
[1:46:38] move you just starchy and stiff
[1:46:42] nothing's gonna move me that's how those
[1:46:44] trees were
[1:46:45] he says didn't have no life to bid with
[1:46:47] no bark to make it flexible

[1:47:15] shouting and having a glorious
[1:47:17] time he says oh let me tell you brother

[1:47:23] people
[1:47:24] out of this dead stuff that's going to
[1:47:27] restore
