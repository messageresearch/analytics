e e e for e e for e [Music] God bless you all this morning amen Let's uh stand to our feet and just have a word of prayer open up the service here let's bow our hearts Heavenly Father we thank you for this day Lord Jesus we thank you for all that you do for us Lord thank you for just another opportunity to come into your house Lord and just worship you you father Lord in spirit and in truth lord it's the only way that we can do that father and I just pray that this service could give you glory and honor I pray over this Sunday school topic Lord I pray you could anoint it father I pray over the the main service Lord God may you just come down in a in a mighty way Lord God our hearts and minds are just Lord directed towards you this morning we commit it to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you let's turn into our Bibles into the book of Philippians we're going to go to Philippians and 1 Timothy this morning good to be in the house of the Lord amen Philippians chapter 4 and we're going to catch two verses 11 uh three verses 11 12 and 13 and it says not that I speak of in respect of want for I have learned in whatsoever State I am in therewith to be content I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need amen and then let's turn into our Bibles to 1 Timothy chapter 6 and then we're going to catch verses 6 through 8 it says but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain that we can carry nothing out and having food having food and rainment let us be therewith content God bless you as you take your seats this morning uh my topic this morning is discontentment and then a little subtitle I have have is uh victims of materialism we're going to get into a few quotes this morning from the church age book um brother de brother brandom deals with the the effects that the spirit of the last day has on the world and the influence that it can have on us as Believers amen we're we're a part of this world we live in this world you know the Bible says that we're you know uh here and you know sometimes we have to be a part of the influence of the world and sometimes being a part of the world you know we're supposed to be separate but we're still under the influence of the age that we're living in and he uses this phrase that grabbed my attention when I was studying for this brother bom says he calls it he says that man is a victim of materialism and he says so the definition of materialism is a tendency to consider material possessions and physical comfort as more important than spiritual values so you know we live in a society at least you know here in America where material possessions can be seen as a source of happiness and you know even as Believers I believe we can fall victim to the effects of that Spirit if we're not careful um the second chapter of the church age book you know in the patmas vision brother bandom deals with the importance of being in the spirit and he quotes out of the book of re Revelation where John says that he was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind him a great voice as of a trumpet Revelation 1 ver 20 and brother Brenham says on that if there's anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results it Bears amen so some of the most incredible Revelations uh are written in that final book of the Bible by someone who was what he was in the spirit of the Lord and I want to focus on this this morning is what the devil does is he tries to keep Believers out of the spirit amen and I believe a big portion of it is associated with this topic this morning the spirit of materialism and I want to go through through some quotes and make some comments here on the church age book as we go brother Venom says in the sman church age um he says here is what you have to believe again in the love and the goodness and the wisdom of God he says this too is needful remember he admonished the scripture take no thought for tomorrow what you shall eat or what you shall put on your father knoweth the things you have need of he who clothes the Lily and feeds the sparrow shall do much more for you and he says these physical things are not the true basic necessities of your life for a man's life consisteth not not of the things he possesses but rather seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all the material possessions he brother bom says will be added unto you the people of God he says are not materially minded they are christm minded I want to be christm minded this morning they do not seek the treasures that are below they seek those above so he says a man's life consisteth not of the things he possesses and I love how he put that the people people of God were not supposed to be materially minded they're supposed to be christm minded and that's what it takes to overcome a spirit of discontentment to be christm minded and that is I had I had a a thought this was several months ago and about something in our Christian walk and it our Christian walk is an active process to be christm minded is an active process that we have to take part in it's not you just go to church and you read your Bible those are part of that active process but you have to pursue God you have to pursue these things in the word you have to pursue being christm minded otherwise the influence of this day will overtake you amen we have to we have to allow Christ to be at the center of every thought in every motive and in every objective in our life so contentment this morning is part of our main main subject is the state you know in definition a definition is the state of being satisfied and not Desiring more than what we already have I want to read that again being it is a state of being satisfied and not Desiring more than what we already have such a vital part of our Christian walk can lay in such a simple comment of what Paul said content in whatever state that I am in because I believe that we all can fall into this pattern of Desiring more materially Desiring these things but God says and through through Paul in here he says you have to learn to be content learning is an active process that we're constantly striving for amen I read this devotional the other day I shared it with a with a few Brothers uh and I thought it was worth sharing today from this excerp it says in the newspaper I read about a prominent Builder of upscale homes who said that one of his keys to success is always having a fabulously decorated model home to show his customers he says that he wants them to walk away feeling terribly disatisfied with what they already have those feelings of dissatisfaction come straight from the enemy he says when Satan came to Eve in the Garden of Eden and I thought this was an incredible point he when he came to even the Garden of Eden he did not remind her of all the wonderful things God provided he didn't remind her that he would come down in the cool of the evening he didn't remind her that that everything she had need of was right there he brought up the one thing he had her focus on the one restriction in her life and that is what Satan does in our lives he'll get us to focus on the one thing that you don't have materially speaking he'll get us to focus on everything except being christm minded and the typical Behavior this is typical behavior of of Satan's Behavior he says in this um in this devotion he focuses on the things that we don't have instead of reminding us of all God has given us to enjoy and I I believe there's just such a simple lesson in that there's always something that appears nicer than what you have it doesn't matter what you have you know there is always going to be something that either is nicer or that appears nicer and our eyes because of the society that we live in can be drawn to those things amen and if you've got just if you got the latest and the greatest right now just wait a few months or wait a year you're there's going to be something greater if you've got the latest technology you I'm in the Hearing Care industry and every year there comes out with this groundbreaking technology where you're going to you're going to hear better than you've ever heard and there's there's there's new angles to this and there's this greater and and a lot of times it is it is greater but you just wait a few more months and then it's going to be something greater that's the age that we're living in you know and um that devotion was speaking of Eve and and how the serpent came to her and of course in your life the enemy is always going to try to keep you focusing on what you may not have or something that somebody else has or all of these material things and I I think what he often does because he knows he can't get us the way that he got Eve he can't get us to disbelieve God's word he'll tempt us with desires of the flesh that will completely distract us from being christm minded and living in the place that we're supposed to be living in amen we're supposed to be living in Victorious lives we're supposed to be we're supposed to be striving but if you're focused on something that is material if you're focused on on these worldly possessions then you you Cann all you you can't serve God in mmon you can't serve two at the same time you know and and cars and houses and and clothes and money and this and that I'm not I'm not speaking against those things you know we live in the world you know we're we have to have those things and material possessions they're a blessing from the Lord amen and I believe we ought to be thankful for the blessings that God has given us and I'm not even saying you know that every desire that you have for nicer things is altogether wrong but where does it fall on your priority list amen I want to say that again where does it fall on your priority list am man is it causing you to always strive for something bigger and something better and the the next nicest thing and the nicest the newest you know the desire you have I is it causing you to be dissatisfied with what God has blessed you with right now I know that's something is some real simple but you know one of the biggest one of the biggest downfalls that can happen when you fall into this this lack of contentment in your life by always striving for that next thing the nice car the the the the better paying position or this and that is that you're missing out on one of the biggest blessings that God can give us and that is just simply enjoying the present enjoying the moment that God has given that's why he says he he brother random picks that in that in the church age book he picks that quote up take no thought for tomorrow God knows God knew he created everything right so he knew that we were going to have this inundation of all of this stuff so he says don't think about that I'm going to take care of that I am your provider I am Jehovah Gyra think about the here and now I've blessed you with a family I've blessed you with a job I've blessed you with these things be thankful in the moment that you have right now and a lack of contentment will take away those things it'll take away your ability to just live A Satisfied life in Christ I want to live a satisfied life in Christ I want to be content in everything that he's given me and and I know we all fall I've fallen victim to this we all fall victim to this because brother Benham says that man is victim to a spirit of materialism and we can be influenced by that but what are we going to do with it amen what are we when the Lord uh discerns that in our our hearts what are you going to do with it amen um he said I you can have a desire for something nicer but check whether or not is causing you disa dissatisfaction what you currently have uh a few Sunday schools ago uh I did a little a little series on on perspective and angles and we talked on a few lessons and and I believe if we start to fall into a trap of being being dissatisfied with what we have or you know always thinking of your wants and even your needs just simply you know just simple some of the simple stuff that we have to do just take a moment and start listing out the things that God has given you start being thankful for for for what he has just start making a list because the list can go on and on and on and on Amen and I believe that if you just start thanking him for what you do have you can gain A Renewed perspective amen A New Perspective on what it is that you're you're going through what what he's blessed you with amen all these things just some scriptures to go with that this morning first Thessalonians 5 Rejoice always pray without ceasing give thanks in all circumstances for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you amen Psalms 952 let us come into His presence with Thanksgiving let us Make a Joyful Noise to him with songs of praise brother Benham says further on in the same quote in that church AG book he says it is absolutely true the majority of Christians are not wealthy rather they are on the Poor Side it was so in Jesus's day it was true in Paul's day and it it it should be true today oh it is not too true today for the Leo Dean age is one of vast wealth where often the criteria of spirituality is an abundance of Earthly Goods my how rich the church is in Goods but how poor in spirit bless blessed are blessed be you poor for yours is the kingdom of God he says the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink it is not Material it is within us a rich man is rich in God not in worldly things amen and he says a little bit further down he says now this is nothing against rich people because God can save a rich man some of go some of God's children are rich but money can be such a snare and I wanted to focus on this point that he makes because it's important he says money can be such a snare not only to those who have it but also to those who don't have it amen I want to say that again it can be a snare whether you have money or you don't have money because if even if you don't you can find yourself always thinking about it thinking about wanting it thinking about wanting that nice thing thinking about wanting and so then you're you fall into the same category because now you're in your mind you are serving Mammon amen right way back there in the first uh the first age brother bam this is finishing that quote he says James cried out to those who were putting stock in wealthy people have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ with respect of persons he's quoting James the poor that were trying to butter up the rich in order to get help rather than trusting in God don't do it says James don't do it money is in everything money isn't the answer and today it is not the answer either we have more wealth than we have ever had and yet less is being accomplished spiritually it is not with money that God works he moves by his spirit and that moving of the spirit comes only to a consecrated life in the word amen that's what I want that's my desire I I want a moving of the spirit in my life I want a life more consecrated to the word I think this is the last part of the quote I want to this really powerful part here he says I want to give a warning right here it says concerning the last days that that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold and the leodan or last age of self-love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God we need to guard against the power of sin in these days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized now notice this they haven't realized the effect of this last day Spirit it is time to draw nigh to God and let him fill him fill our lives with his love or we will F feel the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us he's saying that we need to guard ourselves against the power of sin and realize just how strong the effect of that last spirit that last day spirit is and recognize that even even as Born Again Believers amen we can be influenced by by that spirit because we live in this world Amen so that is why a consecrated life to Christ is so important amen so that that Spirit the right Spirit can influence us amen we're supposed to get brother John John got in the spirit of the Lord and then it was when those Revelations came when you get in the spirit of the Lord every everybody who's been a Christian longer than an hour knows that when you get in the presence of the Lord that is where you want to stay amen you want to stay in that place forever because you know that your troubles fall away all all the this this this sin in your life and all all of the sickness everything just it doesn't matter because you're in the presence of God Amen but if you if you're constantly inundated with things and material and all of this then you're never able to enter into that atmosphere um just uh for background I wanted to read uh Revelation 3: 14-1 17 and un the angel of the Church of the leod Deans write these things saith the amen the fearful the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would th work cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will SPO thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched miserable poor blind and naked in this last day he said it would cause people to have such a love for those things that it would take the place brother ROM said it would take the place of the love of God for them in their hearts and and he's brother benam is urgently he's warning us saying that there will be an effect there is an effect we're living in probably the we are in the worst part of that we're we're in the the final moment so the effect of that spirit is stronger now than it ever has been and I I believe now more than ever if we don't keep our guard up then we can be influenced by that spirit and allow it to cause serious handicap spiritual handicap in our lives you know when when when you allow that stuff to happen you become spiritually uh disabled to do the things that God wants us to do to live in the spirit to to to to walk in in the ways of the Lord amen and there was another devotional that that I was quoting earlier um this is the the latter part of that it said most people are driven by discontent and unaware of that fact but if we really if we analyzed our motives we would realize that they generally come from a focus on whatever is missing in our lives the void we want to fill the problems we want to fix the glass that is half empty and we rarely recognize the things that are going well in our lives or make strides to do so no we aim for the unfinished items on a NeverEnding to-do list of trying to make our lives complete in the process we keep our gifts and successes in the back of our minds and miss out on the Gratitude and the satisfaction we could have that struck me when I read it because it points out something that we all do sometimes without even fully realizing it we have this in our in in everybody's Minds we have this constant this to-do list and it's a NeverEnding to-do list to try to make your life complete but your life is already complete in Christ amen and we're supposed to be living in a state of content therefore with whatever you have amen um and that's just it that that whole point of never being content it's the opposite of what Jesus taught us the word uh just have have a few minutes here left the word covet covetousness is basically encompassing that whole idea covetousness is having a Perpetual desire for what we don't have and what it leads to is discontentment because it's causing a person to live in a constant dissatisfaction of what they currently have or what state that they're currently in and I don't know about you saints of God but I I don't want to live in that place amen I want I I I I want to stand you know up here knowing that you know I do stand up here knowing that I have been influenced by this and I believe we all have If we're honest with ourselves but I don't want to stay in that place and when I get into a place like that because I think we live in a place where where're everywhere we look we're inundated with that we're everything is about what you have and where you're going in life and you know I had this this uh patient come in and he's you know he's toward the end of his life he's in his 90s and he was talking about how all the things that he has he has accomplished in his life and he was a surgeon and you know he basically said that you know what you do in life you know working wise basically is what caused him to be what he was you know if if he didn't do that then he would have he would have nothing and so his purpose was in that it was in something that he did rather than in what Christ did and I just thought how empty that is how empty of a life that is and and it's and it is important what you do you're supposed to enjoy what you're doing I'm glad I'm thankful that I do enjoy what I do but that isn't where my my purpose lies my purpose lies in Christ amen now I love how uh simple brother bam makes always makes things you know the answer he gives is a scripture where he quotes James chapter 4 you know it's is it it's time to draw nigh to God and let him fill us with his with his love amen what's the answer Caleb what's the answer draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you that's a Biblical promise amen Ecclesiastes 5:10 says he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver nor he that loveth abundance with increase this is also vanity and the Amplified reads it like this he says he who loves money will not be satisfied with money nor he who loves abundance with his gain this too is Vanity and Solomon writes that from a place of experience amen he he was a man who one of the wealthiest men in the world had all the wisdom you know outside brother that outside of Christ was the wisest man ever to walk the earth in riches and in wisdom and he came to the understanding that if you place your satisfaction in money or things or people you will never be satisfied amen amen a few a few verses later in the same um book Ecclesiastes 5:19 if you want to bring it up every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth and hath given power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labor this is the gift of God for he shall not much remember the days of his life because God anth him in the joy of his heart and I wanted to read that from the NLT as well because I I like the way that words it and it is a good thing to receive wealth from God and the good health to enjoy it to enjoy your work and accept your lot in life this is indeed a gift from God God keeps such people so busy enjoying life that they take no time to brood over the past so anything that you do possess it truly is a gift from God Amen and having a Content attitude is something that allows us to enjoy the benefits of what God has given us amen and and the Bible you know here says that those things can be a tremendous blessing but what's your attitude towards it amen Proverbs 15 just a few closing comments Proverbs 15:16 says better is little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and trouble therewith amen Psalms 107: 8-9 says oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men for he satisfieth the longing soul and filth the hungry soul with goodness amen that's the kind of satisfaction that I want in my life amen my uh my daughter got this really cool toy from my mom this Christmas it plays little Bible songs and has little prayers on it and stuff it's just this little thing you can carry around and one of the prayers said says thank you Lord for not keeping tabs and I'm just so glad that he doesn't keep tabs in our life amen I I've failed so many times in this category and I believe if we're honest with oursel all of us have but he he doesn't keep tabs and he doesn't write me off for those things he doesn't tally your failures amen what he does is he sends conviction amen and to get us back on track amen glory to God let's pray Heavenly Heavenly Father we thank you for this day we love you Lord I just pray over the Lord the remainder of service I pray that you could just father fill this place with a spirit of worship father we love you and we just commit these things to you in Jesus name amen amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
