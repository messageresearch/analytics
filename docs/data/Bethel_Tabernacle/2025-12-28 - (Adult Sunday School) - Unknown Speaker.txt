TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. N. Heat. Heat. You don't &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Lady. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And what a blessed thought it is. What a blessed hope it is. What an assurance it is. &gt;&gt; And this dark hour at the end of world's history to know the creator is sailing like Solomain with us. &gt;&gt; Safely tucked in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. arms, whatever may come, let them ride, burst, blow, whatever they want to. It makes no difference to me. &gt;&gt; I'm sailing with the creator. &gt;&gt; What a security &gt;&gt; while sailing these waters. &gt;&gt; Now, while speaking, talking of him about what great things he' done at the revival, feasting, Jesus was probably resting like he is. I said between the revival and we they had been so clearly identified to who he was. The people knew who he was of those who was blinded. But those who had a hold on the scripture because they know that the scripture, God's word has been given a lot to each generation. And that promise of that age has to be fulfilled. And he fulfilled exactly what was supposed to be done in the time of the Messiah. He met every qualification that we he was assured that he was the man. &gt;&gt; But you see, he was so common. He didn't dress like a priest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had no not an education as as what we'd call education. We had no record of him even going to school. But there was something about him that was different. And then he invited them when they couldn't understand said the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and that's the thing that testifies of me &gt;&gt; they tell you who I am &gt;&gt; and I remember that all had this in their heart and was thinking of these things and while sailing around on the sea how they could be like children as long as he was in the ship with them. our friend, what that ought to do to us. The same identified Jesus Christ, the same creator, the same God is with us tonight. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; What a secure it is. What a feeling to know that his presence is here. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; we find right when this having this great time, all of a sudden, trouble arose. The ship rock, the sails blew off, the water filled the boat, all hopes of survival was gone. Now, isn't it strange? Just like it is now as we're coming down to the end now. Isn't it strange? We can talk about how great he is. We can tell how great he is in our church when we testify. We tell the our our employees employers how great he is. We tell the people on the street how great he is. And when trouble strikes, we are frustrated. &gt;&gt; We just &gt;&gt; the things that we've seen him do, the things that we know he does. And just let a little sickness or a little trouble strike the home. Watch what happens. &gt;&gt; All gone to pieces. All all hopes are gone. Though they had seen him do so many things, all forgotten when trouble strikes. Like now we have seen this great revival. We have history of other great revivals. We have his presence. We know these things and sometimes trouble sets in that we can't remedy. They u for instance like now we have trouble in our churches now. We have denominational troubles, arguments in our churches. We don't know what's going to take place. We see a great thing forming up there. All of us believers in the Bible see something's fixing to take place. There's nobody but what knows that. And all the churches are going to be brought into that ecumenical council of churches. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And when you do that, you're going to forfeit your great evangelical teaching of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Pentecostals are sympathizing with it, going right into it like a hog going to its slaughter. &gt;&gt; Right. Echumenical council. Many great Pentecostal leaders agreeing with them. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, don't you never stick your neck in a thing like that. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what the Bible said would come to pass. There's the beast in the market perfectly. Everything's set right in order. And we see this and we wonder what's going to be the outcome of it. Trouble set in. And they forgot that the very one that they were talking about, the very creator was in the boat with them. Now you say, "If I could think that, well, remember we still have him because he's the word always." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In John 1:1, as we spoke last night, he was the word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we still have his word that directs us to his thoughts and his doings for this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See the not the thoughts Moses had in his day, not the thoughts of disciples, not the thoughts of Luther or Wesley or the Pentecostal age or any of those. We have the Bible here that tells us of what's going to happen now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, we see the Pentecostal revival in the Bible, the Lutheran and all those church ages. We saw them. But we also have the scripture here telling us what it's going to be now. And that's God. God interpreting his own word for this age that we're living in. &gt;&gt; He's his own interpreter. &gt;&gt; And yet we get frustrated. Don't be frustrated. His disciples sometimes get physical troubles that they can't remedy such as sickness, cancer, so forth that the doctors can't don't know what to do about it. We like them forget who's in the ship. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They should have known that he knowed all these things. He knew they were going to happen. &gt;&gt; He was a He knew all things. So, he knew this was going to happen in order to happen to him. Why was it let it happen? When he got in that ship, he knew that was going to happen. &gt;&gt; He knows that we had to meet this condition and he's foretold us in the Bible to be that way. &gt;&gt; Now, what was he doing? Testing their faith. Why would he let a a a a fine little motherl looking woman sit in a wheelchair like that? Why would he let a fine young fell here? These young man sitting here in these wheelchairs and ladies and so forth. Why would he? And still they might this live an ordinary life, but there may be some sitting here with heart trouble. If God don't heal, you may be dead before morning. That's &gt;&gt; right. He know it was going to happen. Maybe it's done to give our faith a test. That's what it was done for them. He said so. See, same now. He had proven who he was by the words and signs that he had proved among them that he was the vindicated anointed Messiah that was to come. And he's proved among us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the return of the things that he promised in this day that he would do. He's proved that he's here. He proves that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Then see how easy we can get frustrated in any little thing. We should never let it happen. &gt;&gt; No. He said, "If I do not the works that's written in me, then don't believe me." And if the church, if the Holy Spirit today isn't doing the things that it was supposed to do for this hour, then don't believe the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Got a right to disbelieve it. But he promised that these things that he's doing right now will be taking place right at this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it ought to make us feel so secured. So going up to the meeting, the great Holy Spirit, I understand, is up there revealing the secrets of the hearts of the people. That's exactly what he said he would do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he'd be revealed in the last days, Jesus Christ said himself that that's exactly what he would do. &gt;&gt; And he said the world would be in a condition like it was in the days of Sodom. That's just where it's at now. He said the churches would be separated just like they was then. Lot the lukewarm down in Babylon or down in Sodom and the Sodomites. He said Abraham the elected called out group and he sent a messenger to the elected group and he sent two messengers down to them representing each one. That's just what he's done &gt;&gt; even to every name, every action, every move, everything just perfectly, every sign, every manifestation just exactly the same. &gt;&gt; He said it would happen. Now what are we scared about? What's these things on us for? He's trying to see what we'll do about it. &gt;&gt; Notice, &gt;&gt; he told him, said, "Now, if you can't believe me, believe the works that I do. They testify who I am." &gt;&gt; They should have known it, but they didn't. That he was God who created the creator of the winds and the sea. If he could create the winds and the sea, could he not more make them obey his word? Amen. &gt;&gt; If he created everything, can't he make everything obey? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us remember also he created our bodies. They also will have to obey his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What do you say? If I could just be sure of that. Well, we are sure of it. He's sure to prove it. So, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; they have to obey it. Remember, he's got when we are laying nothing but maybe a spoonful of ashes, he promised to raise up that ashes. He promised to raise it up. The body has to obey him. &gt;&gt; And that's when we die, we rest assure that we'll be raised up because he promised he'd do it. And his promise is his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we believe, you believe in a resurrection of the body. &gt;&gt; Sure. If you're not, you're not a Christian. &gt;&gt; So, we believe that he'll raise us up at the last days. He promised to do it. And what is that? That's his word. That's where we stake everything that we got right on that word. And then when it comes to the time that we see the word being identified to be with us, then we're like the disciples in another case when there's out on the sea and and there's about to sink again at another occasion and they seen Jesus come walking on the water and they got scared. They said, "It's it's a spook. It's scary. A afraid it was a spirit." And they cried out with fear. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; The only thing that could help them, they was scared of it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so is it today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The very only thing that can help people, they're afraid of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. &gt;&gt; He said, "Fear not, it's I." &gt;&gt; He speaks. How would you know it's him? He's identified by his word. That's what he's identified the first time. That's the way he's identified every time, by his word. Notice after these defi disciples found themselves at the end, it must have dawned on some of them that the creator was still with them. I hope it does that to us tonight where Hebrews 13:8 says he's the same. Then what did they do? They awakened Jesus. Go wake Jesus. Wake him. Call him on the scene. He's very easy called. They had seen uh seen so many things that God had done and and and the words of vindicating him. So have we. And he was not hard to be called into action. They woke him up and said, "Do you care not that we perish?" You say, "How can we be sure of this? Can we prove it?" John 14:12, Jesus said, "He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also." That's exactly our faith bringing Christ in our presence. &gt;&gt; He said in in Luke 17th chapter in the last days when the son of man is being revealed to be a time like Sodom and Gomorrah. We see that happening. He said before that time taking place and Malachi 4 that there'd be a message go forth that would restore the people back to the original faith that was once delivered to the people. &gt;&gt; Yes. always God's program to do that. And then the wicked would be ashes and the righteous would walk out upon their feet. We see all these promise. He's waiting right now for you. You, you, every one of you to call him on the scene. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Call him on the scene. That's where he wants to be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Called on the scene of action. &gt;&gt; Notice when you call him on the scene. So then we say let us wake him then call him to confirm his word and the thing that he promised to do the way he we would know in the revelation of Jesus Christ in the last days will be like it was in the days of Sodom. He promised that revelation to the church when he would be revealed. So don't doubt fear. He's the same yesterday and forever. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I heard a woman one time when I was talking about him being so great. She said, "There's one thing I have that gets your teaching, Mr. Brandom." I said, "Well, thank you if you only have one thing." I said, "I hope God only finds it that way." And she said, "Well, you brag too much on Jesus." I said, "I hope that's the only thing's against me." And and I said, "I don't brag enough on him." She said, "Oh, yes you do." Said, "You make him divine." Is a woman that didn't believe that Jesus was divine. Just Christian Science. and said, "Um uh you make him uh you make him divine. Make him God." I said, "He's either God or the greatest deceiver the world ever known." I said, "He" said, "Well, I can prove to you by your Bible that he wasn't he was just merely a prophet." I said, "He was a prophet truly, but he was God also." Said he was a man and he was mortal. I said, "That's true." Also, she said on the road down to raise Lazarus from the grave, uh St. John the 11th chapter said the Bible said Jesus wept. I said that's true. She said well that proves that he couldn't be divine and weeping. I said oh my lady is that your argument? I said that's a weak one. She said I said true. He was a man when he was weeping. But when he put it his little body in motion pulled his little shoulders back and said Lazarus come forth. And a man that had been dead four days and was rotten in the grave, stood on his feet and lived again. That was more than a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was God. &gt;&gt; He was a man &gt;&gt; out here in this boat that night. When he's out on the sea where 10,000 devils of the sea swore they drowned him. That little old boat tossed about like a bottle stopper out there on the stormy sea. He was a man tired, sleeping. But when they awakened him and called him on the scene, he put one foot up on the brail and looked up and said, "Peace be still." And the winds and the waves obeyed him. That was more than a man. That was God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was a man when he come down off the mountain hungry, looking on a tree to find something to eat. He was a man when he was hungry. But when he taken five biscuits and two fish and fed 5,000, that was more than a man. That was God in that man. Yes. &gt;&gt; Every person that's ever mounted to a hill of beans has been people who believe that, &gt;&gt; right? Poets and what more believe that that God was in Christ reconciling himself to the world. And now Christ is in the church reconciling the people to God. &gt;&gt; He promised to do it. It has been written that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart. that is just waiting now to be called on the scene. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, the only thing could call him on the scene is for us to awaken him in ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Call him on the scene. &gt;&gt; It was the greatest gift that God ever gave the world. God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. Whosoever believeth in him not perish have eternal life. Watch God in his gift. Now, the people used God's gift. a little woman one time she believed that that he was the manifestation of God in flesh. And she said, "If I touch his garment, I I I'll be made whole." Now, she touched his garment and he turned around and said, "Who touched me?" See, virtue, strength has gone from me. She touched his garment. That was her using God's gift. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; See, he got weak from that. But when he went away from the home of Lazarus, remember St. John 5:19, Jesus said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing in himself, but what he sees the Father doing." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, Jesus Christ never performed one miracle, never did anything in the way of the supernatural until first he saw a vision on what to do. &gt;&gt; Yes. Right? &gt;&gt; How many believe that to be the truth? St. John, verily, not what I hear, not what somebody tells me, &gt;&gt; what I see the father doing, that doeth the son likewise. &gt;&gt; Now, if that isn't so, then the rest of scripture isn't so. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the son can do nothing in himself, but what he sees the father doing, that doeth the son. The father worketh and I workketh the other two. In other words, he just acted out, done what God told him to do. Now remember when he went away from the home of Lazarus he's gone several days Lazarus got sick and they sent for him he didn't go few days later Lazarus got sicker so they sent for him again he still didn't go then when the appropriated time the father had showed him what happened Lazarus died and he turned when Lazarus died said Lazarus's dead and I'm glad for your sake I wasn't there and they'd been wanting to pray for him and so forth he just done what God told him to do what he saw a vision &gt;&gt; so he had seen a vision know what to do. But I go wake him. &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Watch tomorrow. If they're coming to see him, she said, "Lord, if thou would have been here, my brother would not have died. But even now, whatever you ask God, God will give it to you." See, he knowed what he was going to do. Watch him at the grave of Lazarus. He said, "Father, I thank thee thou heard me already, but I just said it for these who stand by. Lazarus, come forth." &gt;&gt; And Lazarus raised from the dead. Now he never said a thing about getting wheat there. That was God using his gift &gt;&gt; and the people using God's gift was different or he was the word and the word is sharper than a two-edged sword says the Bible and discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That proves that God is in the midst of the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Let us believe it. He's ready according to his word to be called on the scene tonight. How many here sick and needy? Raise up your hands. Let's see your hands. How many sick and needy &gt;&gt; anyone? The only thing he's waiting for is to be called on the scene. &gt;&gt; Just ask him. Now, what if he was standing here with this suit that he gave me &gt;&gt; and you come up in front of him and said, "Lord Jesus, I want you to heal me." You know what he'd say? I've already done it. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; He was wounded for our transgressions. With his stripes, we were healed. &gt;&gt; You can't do it the second time. &gt;&gt; So, see, he's already done it. &gt;&gt; You have to believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's nothing you can doritorial to anything to to earn your salvation or healing. There's nothing you can do about it. It's a free gift of God. &gt;&gt; See, it's grace, a free gift. If I give you a million dollars and you straighten up my tie, I didn't give it to you. You done something for it. See, God's gift is free. The only thing you have to do is believe it that he has purchased this for you. &gt;&gt; You It's already purchased. He did it for you. And there's not a man in the world. &gt;&gt; I don't know what you've had here in Baton Rouge. Everything's drifting the country. Impersonations and we know that's just got to be that way. But when a man comes in and tell you he has power to heal you, he's lying. God alone can heal. I'm the Lord thy God who heals all thy diseases. &gt;&gt; He'll not share his glory with anybody. There's no man has power to heal. But there's man who has gifts to manifest God. Your pastor, pardon me, he can take God by a gift of of a teacher. He can explain the word. So you're bound to see it. If you got any eyes to see with, you'll see it. There's another maybe some other gift. But there's always a gift that manifests the presence of God. &gt;&gt; And through there, you yourself have to believe it. A sinner might come here at the altar as a young man or woman at the age of 14 years old and they bring you your meal here and you cry to the Lord until you were 90 years old, you'd never be saved. &gt;&gt; But the you've got to first accept what he done for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, you've got to accept it yourself. &gt;&gt; Then when you accept it, then he is the high priest mediator to make intercessions upon your confession of what you believe. Now that's the same thing by a gift this way. It's getting your own mind away from you and then see what he says do. I see people come to the platform, they jump up and down and scream and say, "Oh, Brother Brandham, I got all faith in the world." What are you doing up here then? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's that's emotion, not faith. Genuine wine faith knows no defeat. It's already done. &gt;&gt; It's already over. God said so, and that finishes it. You see, God said so. Now, it's the same thing anytime when you really believe it, that touches him. &gt;&gt; Now, that little woman that touched his garment, she said, "If I but just only touch his garment, I'll be made whole." And she did it. And when she carried out what her faith wanted her to do, touch it, he felt it. &gt;&gt; See, and he turned around and spoke to her. Now, he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. If you will just only believe Christ, believe him. Let your faith touch his garment. And he right now is a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. We all know that. &gt;&gt; And if he's the same yesterday, today, and forever, he'll have to act today as he did yesterday if he's the same high priest. &gt;&gt; Now, won't you believe it? &gt;&gt; It's to have faith in God. If I've told you a lie, then God won't back it up. Well, if God told you the truth, he he'll back it. He's obligated to back the truth up. Jesus said, "I I have a witness, and the witness is God's word." Of course, the the scriptures testify of me. If they don't testify me, then don't believe it. See, and if the scriptures doesn't testify of what I'm telling you now, that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever, then don't believe the scripture because the scripture said he was. And he promised these things for this last age. Remember, just at the end of the Jewish age, that's how he revealed himself Messiah. the end of the the age of the Samaritans, he did the same. Now it's the end of the Gentile age. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Await him in your conscious. Call him on the scene while we bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, just a word from you now will be as sufficient. It'll be all that we need. Just a word from you. May the people clearly understand what the achievement what we're trying to do, Lord, is to is to let them get the benefits of the Lord Jesus that they love and serve. May they do it tonight, Lord, because your death was not in vain. You were wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquity. The chast peace is upon, and with the stripes we were healed. I pray God that everyone in here in divine presence will understand this and will get the vision and will be healed for the glory of God. Through Jesus Christ's name, I present myself with this congregation to his honor and glory. Amen. I'll be real reverent just for a few minutes. I just a word from him would mean more than all I could say or all anyone else could say because it's him doing it. He is the one. He's the doer and we are trusting that the the Lord Jesus will grant these things to you. Now each one now let's see what time I didn't was that [clears throat] I tell you to get out your own time what we supposed to. We haven't the time to bring up this line. Let's call it right from the audience. Now, let's just take the scripture just a minute. Now, the Bible promises in this day that the repeat of Sodom and Gomorrah will be repeated. How many believe that? Now, raise up your hand. The Bible identifies that. Now, and then what was that at Sodom and Gomorrah? It was God in the form of human being. And the way that Abraham noted it is when he said, "Why did Sarah laugh in the tent behind or why did she doubt it?" The words that he had spoke.
