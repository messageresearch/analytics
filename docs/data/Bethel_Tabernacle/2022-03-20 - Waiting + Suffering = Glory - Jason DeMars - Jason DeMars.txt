school lesson you know when you're born into a family you don't have a choice you know my mom and dad i didn't say i didn't want to come i didn't it's the same with god each one of his children he's the progenitor you know and it's funny how people look at it like you're making yourself something when all we do is just we're just so thankful for the grace of god and revelation we're not trying to put ourselves up anywhere or anything but he's the one that did the electing he's the one that did the selecting amen and i appreciate that very much i probably wouldn't have chose me but he did and i'm grateful for that it was a wonderful lesson amen let's pray father i love you this morning lord i just pray you bless your people father we feel your presence lord we just help us open our hearts and listen to that still small voice that would speak to us father lord we pray that you have blessed the tithes and offerings bless the needs upon our hearts we remember our minister brothers that are out in the field today watch over and keep them bless them anointing mightily bless the people they speak to father lord we don't believe we just kind of walk haphazardly we believe each and every step we take is ordained of god and if i may say so especially when a minister goes somewhere and especially the minister that we will hear today lord we know that you are you've spoken to him you've guided him you've inspired him lord you all knew we'd be here this morning you know who would be speaking he'll be leading songs who'll be playing the instruments so we're just going to rest in your

we have a special sister sarah yance if he'd be ready to come up right afterwards we have another special you know the thing that always blows my mind about god before we sing this special is that i mean when a baby's being born it's a wonderful thing and when there's a death and there's a funeral there's so many things and god he experiences all of these gamut of emotions all the time i mean yesterday they had to move that wasn't easy god they're praying god help them we're all going through different things at different times it just blows my mind what an awesome god that we serve i just love him so much aren't you thankful for your lord and savior [Music] it's always been a mystery all my life i've been told i belong [Music] but it turns out it's the ones you were looking for all this [Music] [Applause] [Music] nobody but jesus i'm living for the world to see nobody but jesus well moses had stage fright and david brought a rock to a sword fight two big twelve outsiders nobody [Music] so when i hear that devil start talking to me saying who do [Applause] i'm trying to tell everybody [Music] i'm living [Music] faithful [Music] nobody but jesus [Applause] that's another bloodbath [Music] nobody [Music] [Applause] you gave my heart a song to see i'm living for the world to speak nobody but jesus i'm living for the world to see nobody but jesus i'm living for the world to see your body for jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] a long long time ago i did not know about jesus and his love you see i heard about it but i never felt it this manner that comes from above when this life of sin i could no longer stand i asked my mother how do i get to know this man she said you must [Music] [Music] that prayer will turn and keeps the fire burning that kind of experience you know you can feel it'll make you move make you shout make you cry cause it's real keep your hand in the master's hand to your souls been anchored in jesus name filled within free from sin [Music] and dangers that my lord has brought me through jesus opened the blinded eyes and he made the lane to walk there's nothing too hard for my god to do so now's the time you must seek him let him fill your soul from within he'll feel your soul make you whole then you'll know you're bored let me tell you you must have that firing holy ghost that prayer will turn and keeps the fire burning that kind of experience you know you can feel it might make you move make you shout make you cry cause it's real keep your hands filled within free from sin you've got to be [Applause] [Music] that kind of experience you know you can feel it might make you move make you shout make you cry cause it's really keep your hands in the master's hands to yourself been angered in jesus name filled with it free from sin you've got to be born again filled within free from sin you've got to be born again filled with it free from sin you've got to be born [Music] [Applause] [Music] god's gifts in operation in the body so thankful so appreciative of the lord because it brings his presence amongst us amen every gift needs to be operating in surrender to the lord working amongst us ev the bible says every joint and every band supplies something to the body that's essential and so thank i'm so thankful for what the lord is doing i'm so thankful for each one of you um let's be in prayer for brother matt he's ministering in lula georgia i had brother samuel dales and for brother jason who's up ministering at little life church today and and for their trap for traveling mercies for them as well i didn't see any prayer requests come in but let's let's stand up and we'll pray for them and if you have a need in your heart and in your life just lift your hand of the lord and put your faith and trust in him and god will make a way amen lord we're just lifting our hands lord i'm lifting my hand to you lord and we have many needs represented behind each of these hands lord we ask that you'd move in a supernatural way in every one of these needs lord we ask that you'd move lord in the meetings in in lula and in the meetings in in that literal life lord may your holy spirit just flow through your gifts that your name would be lifted up and glorified in all things lord and and for here lord we ask that your your spirit just would continue to flow through each of us lord i know i know within myself i have nothing good i can offer i have nothing good i can give to these people that are going to bring eternal life that that's going to bring rapturing faith lord it's not in me it's not in any of us but it's in you by your spirit and the working of your spirit in your body lord we just want to be under your headship we want to be under your leadership lord we want to be following you we want to be found faithful so we ask that you would strengthen us to that end lord help each one of us to step out of the way to lay the cares of this life aside and focus on you and your word just for a few minutes here this morning lord for your glory we ask these things in jesus name amen amen i want to speak on subject waiting plus suffering equals glory so i know everybody signs up it says first message i want to hear is the preacher preaching on suffering and you know the youtube channels everybody's watched oh they see a sermon on suffering they sure want to watch that it might not be necessarily what catches our eye or catches our mind or even something the things that we're going through we don't want to go through them but they're necessary because the end is glory which when you see that word i think you need to recognize it's it's very it can be a very ethereal we're we're predestinated to glory we're ordained to glory what does that mean if you think of it in real practical terms it's a new body the rapture right and what comes thereafter all that comes thereafter a new body ruling and reigning with christ eternal life immortality all these things and a position of authority in god's kingdom so when you see glory don't just don't just think of some ethereal thing but this is vitally important it's our it's future future grace and so waiting plus suffering it could be suffering plus waiting too it could go either direction but it's not necessary to be in that order but waiting and suffering come together and the results is glory and so let's go to the scripture while you're standing read psalm 69 verse 3 i am weary of my crying my throat is dried mine eyes fail while i wait for my god. may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word he can be seated last night i was in my office back there most of the afternoon and it seemed like every time i wanted to get on my knees and pray and and start studying another thing came up and then another emergency came up and then another thing came up and it was just uh it was tough to get to that place and then i did get to pray and i just prayed and it was just waiting it was waiting and no answer no answer and i finally was like well it's time to go home for a little bit and eat dinner and and uh got in the truck and said lord i don't know what i'm gonna be speaking on tomorrow i need your help and he said you're not gonna be speaking tomorrow oh i begin to think well then who is and he said i'm going to speak tomorrow would you let me speak tomorrow and i said okay he then he said trust me. okay usually that means it's something extraordinary and out of the ordinary usually i come to the pulpit with a clear vision and i know exactly where we're going to go and where i want to take you and i don't right now the lord i laid in bed till very late last night uh past one o'clock and uh also got up very early thank you brother brad and in the in the night the lord just gave me two scriptures which we'll get to in a little bit he didn't even give me what the content was he just gave me the two scriptures philippians 1 27 and philippians 2 12. and that's where this the inspiration came because as i read those verses and the verses that came behind that it led me down a certain direction and i had no title until i finished putting my scriptures and quotes out usually i have notes and a lot of different things that i say in between the scriptures there's scriptures and there's quotes and we trust the lord that he'll put it together by his grace not by anything that we deserve but it's his promise to feed you amen and that's the desire in my heart is to see each one of you fed in the lord speaking by his his word through that so next scripture we have up there um is romans 8. so i'm going back uh the lord in this verse waiting for god how many have ever waited for god how many ever waited a decade for god how many ever waited longer than that how many are still waiting well all of us actually we're all waiting because we're waiting that's what christian life is is waiting for the rapture that's what every that's what every age was looking for and waiting for so in that sense we're all waiting but there's individual purposes we have in our life and we have to wait for god to work i think this is such a key this is a key verse here in waiting at least in my experiences because when you're waiting what's happening you say well nothing because you're waiting no there's a lot happening and you'll see as we go through the scriptures there is a lot happening but we wait and when we wait what happens we get weary we get we sometimes we get weak sometimes we feel purposeless we feel like whoa what am i doing i'm supposed to do something and god is saying just sit be still rest in me i have a purpose i have a plan i have not left you alone i've not cut you've not come to this place where i've just abandoned you i've i'm bringing you through something to bring something through you he wants to accomplish a purpose and so when we wait for god while we wait for him a lot is happening but a lot is happening inside of us it's not necessarily on the outside but on the inside of us god is doing something incredible something that couldn't come in another way i think if you look through scripture isn't it true that god made all of his servants wait and wait and wait and wait and so there's a great thing for every every servant of god we're all servants of god not just the preacher we're all servants of god but every child of god every son of god every daughter of god has to learn to wait on the lord the the greatest triumphs in the bible are people waiting on god the greatest failures in the bible are people that couldn't wait for god couldn't allow god to work out what he was trying to work out and put things in order and set things in the right stage and go when god says to go all right romans 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting oh waiting waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body we're waiting for glory we're waiting for that rapture to take place and when we're waiting what are we doing groaning that's what we read in the scripture before that crying weeping tears waiting for this immortality to come romans 8 24 says for we are saved by hope so this one is sometimes confused because the english word hope is kind of like a wish but in the bible hope is an earnest expectation for we we're saved by hope being an earnest expectation but an earnest expense expectation that is seen is not hope in other words you already have it you're not earnestly expecting already something you already possess for what a man seeth why does he yet hope for it but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it and so that's key to the christian life we have to wait on god and we have to wait for god to accomplish his purpose in us i think as you get older you learn this art but when you're younger you don't want to wait for anything you just want action you want to move forward you want to push forward but if the young people that are listening the greatest the greatest thing you can learn as a young christian is to wait on the lord nothing is good is accomplished by pushing forward not listening to god not waiting for god to speak and just pushing forward in what you think you ought to do you can destroy your whole life doing that you can go out you can completely go off the rails no you'll never lose if you have true salvation you'll never lose that but you can go so far outside of the will trying to do him a service without that being what he wants to be doing what want to be accomplishing through you and if we understand scripturally if you're a seed of god god is going to bring you back to where you're supposed to be but it's probably going to hurt it's going to hurt second thessalonians 3 5 and the lord direct your hearts into the love of god and into the patient waiting for christ how this is critical a critical part of the christian faith is patient waiting we don't like that too much in america we want to have it now brother jack you started serving the lord a long time ago you're you're you were waiting then for christ and you're waiting now for christ and you'll will continue until he comes we'll continue waiting but many times we get impatient when we get impatient we start doing things and going in directions that we ought not to go wait on the lord we can be content just to be a servant just to do and be what he wants you to be don't run ahead of him and say i've got to do something i've got to go do this i've got either whether it's in a personal life situation whether it's in ministry in the local church on any level not just preaching whatever it is entrust yourself to the lord believe that he is sovereign over you and your life and the purpose that he has for you many times you see churches break up church split why because it's people that cannot wait for god to move you see marriage is split you see families broken why because they don't want to wait for god they want everything to be done their way and in their time and that's not how life works and that's not how god works brother branham says but not only this is from the ephesian church age but not only is the candlestick of gold and is a beaten gold hand crafted of beaten gold according to her blueprints which were spirit given outside of her lord and master jesus christ was ever a people so beaten and purged as the bride of jesus christ surely she's filling up the sufferings that christ has left behind her goods are despoiled her life is in jeopardy she is accounted as sheep for the slaughter she is killed all the day long she suffers much but in it all retaliates not neither does she cause others to suffer worthy of the gospel is this lovely bride of christ and as gold is malleable whereas brass will break with the beating this gold of god will bear her sufferings for the lord not bowed not broken not destroyed but formed as a thing of beauty and a joy forever by the trials and testings of this life do you know that was in the church ages book you know we we we understand and we'll get to that in a minute to talk about the difference between suffering tribulation and suffering in the tribulation those are two different things and it's important to differentiate that but look at this i mean no one suffers as much as the bride of christ for all ages too many times that's that's not in our theology no no please set that aside we're we're the bride we are not going to suffer because we're going to be taken in the rapture you're taking american approach to the gospel and superimposing that onto the true gospel and then adding that into message teaching about the rapture so the saints in ukraine are they suffering are saints in iran are they suffering saints in turkey are they suffering yeah they're not going through the tribulation period that's god's wrath this is not god's wrath necessarily directly it could be indirect but god's purpose for someone who is suffering that's a christian it's not wrath it's it's actually has a purpose to it it's either corrective or it's simply there to perfect us it's either to correct us or perfect us and even the correction is for the purpose of perfection so you might you might have suffered you might have had hard trials you may have difficulties that you're facing constantly you know i brother brother john sings that song one more valley one more hill which i love and i understand the bigger picture but i think brother there's one one more valley a day sometimes there's five of them and sometimes sometimes the hills are twice as high but in the big picture of course i understand the time is short the lord is coming soon the rapture is going to take place soon just around the corner and yet many trials many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivers them out of them all and god's purpose for a believer when he brings trials it's never to pour out his wrath he has a great eternal purpose sometimes the lord allows us allows us to lose something or someone and we in our finite minds looking at time and space say oh it's terrible how could we ever suff how could we ever survive this and god is saying hold my hand trust me this hurts i know this i'm crying with you and yet understand i have a purpose that's higher that's greater that's more beautiful than you can even imagine and so we suffer we go through trials part of the reason is we are the people that god is working in and through to accomplish something in the earth and what happens satan opposes that satan fights against that and by by just not just naturally speaking though spiritually speaking i guess i should say spiritually speaking what's going to happen is there's going to be trials difficulties and god chooses those out for us even though satan comes against us satan is not like messing up god's program god's program is being accomplished perfectly but we face trials difficulties battles and testings of this life of course we would of course we would we're the people that god is using to bring this word to the whole world why wouldn't we would have to have opposition opposition from spiritual realms opposition from natural realms and so we suffer as a result as a result of being the bearers of the gospel and god says you know what i'm going to take those and use those and harness those to make you more like me in waiting we will be found obedient when we wait on him now of course it can this can go a million miles off to the wrong direction somebody just waits on the lord all the time and never takes action when the lord speaks that's not right either there's a balance to that but wait on him to be sure it's god that you know brother branham um tells on himself sometimes where he he says the lord the angel of the lord rebuked him and said you're just waiting for me to push you through a pipe and brother branham kind of gives a mixed review on that thinking okay on the one hand then i know everything i'm doing is the perfect will of the lord and when i wait on the angels of the lord to tell me what to do i know it's the perfect will of the lord but at the same time he's given me a commission and i should just go and follow those open doors and so i think together you bring bring those two thoughts together in a balance that's where we go because you know if you remember the some of the different stories where brother branham made his plan for his trip i think to the midwest and the lord gave him a dream and directed them completely somewhere else we've go when we're walking with him we've got to be able to say sorry brother i can't come to that meeting i know he planned it but the lord said to me over here or take that on to your personal life i made this commitment i thought this was the right way but excuse me forgive me the lord is telling me not to do that i have to go over here and so waiting isn't necessarily just sitting on your hands that's a that's also a misunderstanding there's a lot of obedience that takes place we don't we don't need necessarily god speaking us to us on every circumstance we have his word we have his word but there's things in our lives where we don't know the answer because it's not in it's not exactly in the word to move here to to go preach a certain place to go on a vacation all those things we should be following the leadership of the lord not our own fleshly desires say that i would never go on a vacation brother jason no god sometimes wants to send you away to give you rest but you wait on him you follow his leadership regardless but in waiting on the lord and for the lord we will be found obedient the first thing that comes to my mind in this is when i think about not waiting on the lord is soul you know what a tragedy god called him anointed him and he was appointed by the nation and set up by the nation and here he is get hearing direction direction from the prophet of god who's vindicated and he's told to go and and tarry seven days he tarried seven days according to the set time that samuel had appointed but samuel came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him okay bad situation right it looks like i should i should act i should do something i've got to fix this problem don't we get that kind of thought process going in our head about church and different things this is bad everybody's leaving samuel you're messing it up for me and saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace peace offerings saul did that and he offered the burnt offering and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering behold samuel came and saul went out to meet him that he might salute him it's a strange thing usually when you do wrong you just kind of run away but samuel is so crazy self-absorbed proud he runs out to samuel said i did a great job and samuel said what what have you done and saul said because i saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest not within the days appointed and that the philistines gathered themselves together at mikmash therefore said i the philistines will come down now upon me to gilgal and i have not made supplication of the lord i forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering samuel said to saul that was done foolishly thou has not kept the commandment of the lord thy god which he commanded thee for now would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel forever wow that was just he couldn't wait he saw the circumstances and said i'm the king i have to be a problem solver this will solve the problem i'm going to offer a sacrifice now you created the problem what if the lord was going to deliver them by only a few right and those people were supposed to go away have you ever seen an example of that in the bible before it doesn't matter if god if there's a few or there's a lot you wait on the lord he's not asking us to be problem solvers all the time i'm speaking to myself sometimes we should wait on the lord wait on the lord to bring the circumstances together who knows what would have happened but surely if samuel if saul would have just waited positive results would have come it had to but saul was looking only at what's going on around me and i need all these people to fight human thinking we get so caught up in human thinking thinking after the flesh this is how it's going to be and you know god doesn't need a great army to deliver by just needs one obedient person just one obedient person that one obedient person can conquer armies conquer nations take down empires philippians 1 27 this was the first verse the lord laid on my heart late last night only let your conversation be as it as it becometh the gospel of christ conversation speaks of your your conduct or your manner of living that whether i come and see you or else be absent i may hear of your affairs that you stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel amen verse 28 and in nothing terrified by your adversaries which is to them an evident token of perdition but to you of salvation and that of god so here's a here's a foundation in this in sufferings and in trials don't be terrified by your adversaries don't be afraid don't be in fear because when we fear what does fear do fear speaks volumes as to where your faith is when you're when you have fear when you're under attack and you're afraid fear shows that you're the one that has the evident token of perdition but when you're under attack and you don't fear you just rest in the lord you encourage yourself in the lord as david did then that's an evident token of perdition to your enemies in other words it's a sign of defeat they're the devil's bringing all kinds of things railing accusations and fighting against you and you just are relaxed it's going to be fine it's going to work out i remember such a strange thing because usually i on a missions field there was this guy that uh uh i was preaching and he stood up and started asking all kinds of questions and he was getting angry with me and usually i will up the ante and answer back real quick to get him to sit down and for some reason the holy spirit just came over me and just i felt so relaxed i just said it's a good question it's going to be answered during the service don't worry about it have a seat kept preaching and then he stood up at the end and again he started yelling questions while i'm about to make an invitation for people to come come forward and for prayer and and so forth and he he just keeps talking so i just pray dismiss the service and oh people are all up in arms everybody's yelling they're mad at this guy because he ruined the atmosphere of the service and the pastor is so upset he comes up to my room at the conference center he's like what are we going to do with this guy's i said don't worry about it he didn't mean that just the lord will work this all out you just let's just pray so we we just bowed our heads and prayed together and said well just allow him to ask the question tomorrow after the service is over and again i felt just so relaxed so at peace like what is he tr why is he trying to do that that's it doesn't hurt me it doesn't harm me and the lord turned the whole situation around this guy from being upset says it's the best conference he's ever been to best services he's ever been to he learned so much he was so blessed and that's what we that's what we need the grace of the lord but that's what we need to be like when the devil attacks us am i always like that no are we always all like that no but we're we need to be striving with all our effort to be like that we don't need to be terrified by anything what are they going to kill us that's better that's a good thing what we think so temporary what about this person what about this do you know that god has everything in control in your life god promised to take care of our families he promised to provide for each one of us just be obedient let let the chips fall where they may as the carnal saying goes let it let whatever is going to whatever's whatever the lord wants to happen it's going to happen worrying about it is not going to change it but having faith about it could actually change the situation couldn't it so we need to be in this position don't be terrified by your adversaries now and sometimes it's just circumstances of life that appear to be an adversary but there's an adversary behind that creating those circumstances for you and so don't be terrified don't be worried don't be feared god's brother brad preached this i remember resonating in my mind when i could barely think about anything god's got this god has you in his hand don't be terrified because it when you're terrified it's an evident token of your own perdition but if you're walking in faith and you're not terrified who's who's going to be terrified your enemy philippians 1 28 and in nothing repeat for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not only to believe on him amen hallelujah praise the lord but also to suffer for his sake why but why can't it just be easy no god didn't ordain it to be easy it was just easy and wouldn't be valuable to us we have to we also we believe on him and we suffer for his sake and guess what that shouldn't make us sad because what does the scripture say we're supposed to rejoice in our sufferings that's not natural that's not human but we're not supposed to be human right we're not supposed to be after the flesh we're supposed to have we have have a we're a different citizenship a different viewpoint a different heart on these matters should bring us rejoicing not sorrow having the same conflict which he saw in me and now here to be in me so in other words paul's saying you're we're all suffering together i'm suffering you heard about it you saw me suffering and now you're suffering as well but it's not for our own sake it's for the sake of christ philippians 2 12 wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling work out your own salvation in one sense you there's that's not possible you cannot work out your own salvation only god can accomplish salvation in us so what does this mean work out it literally means to carry to its ultimate conclusion like a mathematics problem so you work out a mathematics problem it has an it has a conclusion at the end so you see those see those chalkboards they filled with all kinds of things well there's there's an end that they come to even though there's it's totally filled and no none of us could even make out what it is but but yet we in our salvation we're supposed to carry it out to its ultimate conclusion with fear and trembling so accompanied by fear and trembling so there's there is effort that we have to put into it there is surrender that we have to do and there there needs to be that place where there's such reverence and trembling at god's word that we know we can't make it on our own and we can't make it in following after the flesh and so it takes a surrender takes a deliverance continually daily more than daily hourly of ourselves over the lord that he would work in us and change us why though because god it's god working in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure so we can carry our salvation out to its ultimate conclusion why because why because god is working his power in us both to will that means to choose so when we when when our on our end what do we do we choose we make the right scriptural choices we we wait on the lord we seek his face and we wait on the lord some more wait for him to speak to us and guide us and show us show us what to do that's on our end and we just continually give ourselves to the lord and do the things that we are nowhere supposed to do because those things that god is willing those things in us god is leading us to make those choices and to do what's pleasing to him right so it takes a cooperation of wills god working in our will us surrendering that will do all things without murmurings and disputings that's that means do all things without complaining and fighting so don't let your testimony be complaining and fighting i think that's what paul's trying to say when people see your life don't think oh man here comes the complainer again always going to have 10 things to complain about the gas prices are high this is problem that's a problem biden's this and this one come on let's stop complaining and start trusting that god is sovereign that he's in control we don't like the gas prices we don't like inflation whatever god is in control god provide promise to give you food even if inflation was 29 if it was 140 god's promise is still the same it didn't change when biden became president it didn't change when the gas prices went up so stop worrying about it how will i be able to make ends meet god makes the ends meet you trust regardless of the circumstances trust him don't complain don't complain and don't fight these are why should we not because these these are manifestations of unbelief fighting complaining are not the fruit of the spirit just in case y'all didn't know that some people are sure 100 that they are the fruit of the spirit but they're not they're not it's love joy peace patience peace and patience not complaining and fighting long suffering it's long and it's suffering and it requires patience philippians 2 15 that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom you shine as lights in the world so that's god's purpose for us to shine but you're not going to shine if you complain and fight why why why the admonition not to complain and to fight because we know that we suffer we have trials we have difficulties and god has ordained it so in our lives because he know there's two things that perfect us the word and trials if god could have done it another way he certainly would have but he chose not to he this is his perfect means to make you more like jesus christ the the word in your heart and the trials that you face we just want it to be the word don't it doesn't work that way it's not scriptural there must trials must come and if we want those trials if we want our waiting to be fruitful if we want those trials to be fruitful then don't damage what the lord is doing by complaining i heard a minister say one time is we're it's like a it's like a funnel that has a a a way to control and stop the bottom from coming out so when when we're going through a trial and we're waiting on the lord to move god is pouring good things into us and what we can do is we can take those good things and empty them out by complaining murmuring and fighting over the trial that we're facing god's pouring it in and we're just letting it come out by complaining and not trusting the lord and so don't don't use complaining as to open that spigot of good things that god's putting in you let it build up god wants it to build up and he wants it to overflow those good things onto other people but too many times i start complaining start fussing this isn't as it should be i wanted it to be this way these were my expectations we gotta let go of our dreams and expectations and allow god just simply to work and that's to be vessels for him to work through acts 14 22 confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god paul was not a very good prosperity preacher all the other stuff was good but then that last part you know if you really want the ties and offerings to be coming in and building up your bank account you gotta leave that last part out but god doesn't leave that last part out and that that's the truth through much tribulation we must enter the king into the kingdom of god you want to enter into the kingdom of god here's a path and it's called much tribulation here's another path it's it leads to hell it's the good life which one do you want to take most people choose to the good life and at least the perdition we have to choose the road that god put us put put himself with you on and it caught trials suffering we want to do everything to avoid it we try as hard as we can continually and dedicate our lives to fight as hard as we can to avoid suffering trials and tribulation but it's missing the point we we don't go through our lives to avoid those things we go through our lives to be pleasing to the lord and whatever comes our way that comes our way sometimes times are good and it's a little easy sometimes times are very difficult and the trials are hard god is in both of them we just just rest in him suffering tribulation versus suffering in the tribulation so through much tribulation we must enter the kingdom of god there's a difference between what we theologically titled the tribulation period versus suffering tribulation tribulation speaks of pressure squeezing trials but we have one is like we said before there's god's wrath that brings the tribulation and then there is trials and tribulations that we face in our life which god has chosen and appointed for us to go through for our perfection and for his eternal glory and for our good those are two different things so first thessalonians 5 9 speaking of the bride for god has not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ so the saints in ukraine they're not going through the tribulation period they're not going through the wrath of god this is a suffering and a trial that god has a lot allotted for them to go through we may have to go through it too god has allotted this trial for them to perfect them and god is working in their lives and giving them peace and strength and helping them through this all right but it's not it's not god's wrath but when the bride is taken out of the way or i should say christ in the bride is taken out of the way then the man of sin can be revealed then god's wrath is going to be poured out completely on the earth we're not ordained to that we're not ordained to go through that so first thessalonians 5 1 but of the times and the seasons brethren you have no need that i write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction comes upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but you brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief so again there's a that's that's that difference we're not when you go through trials and tribulation and suffering it's not god's wrath god's wrath is going to be yes god's wrath is being poured out on the world and we suffer because we're in the world right but god's purpose is not so that he would put his wrath on you personally the hurricane comes through and your house is destroyed it's not god's wrath against you though it's god's wrath against the world you see that distinction it might be let me let me take a minute and explain it for you bad things have happened since the fall right bad things have happened to god's people since the fault it's part of living in a fallen world but god takes those things and uses them for your good for his glory for your perfection he's done it all through the ages as trials and tests but then there's coming a time where god's pouring his wrath on the whole world there's still elect on the earth right 144 thousand and god has his hands on them and god protects protects them for that season um as the prophet says they're type of the remnant that's carried over but god is pouring his wrath out on the gentile world okay that's why we're taken out of the way because they've rejected the message of elijah they've turned against god only thing left is wrath and the only thing that's holding it back is his bride being in the earth today so once we're gone then wrath can come so there's a big difference between suffering because we're on a fallen world and god actively saying i'm going to destroy this thing and start all over again he says you can't you can't be here when i'm doing this because i've not appointed you to that wrath um first thessalonians 5 4 but ye brethren are not in dark next one ii corinthians 1 3 blessed be god even the father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all comfort who comforts us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort we're with we ourselves are comforted of god that's really worthy but think about this is in other words god is taking you through something some difficult trial so that he can comfort you and then use you to comfort and help someone else who will go through that trial so then they through you are comforted of god so it's not pointless and purposeless what we're going through what we go through god wants to comfort you and use you to be a blessing to other people for as the sufferings of christ abound in us so our consolation also abounds by christ for as so we don't want sufferings to abound but they do sufferings abound but where suffering abounds his comfort abounds amen and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation isn't that interesting paul speaking speaking of i guess you could say his the ministry team he says we're we're being afflicted what is it for so that you'll be comforted and consoled and saved think about that that's quite a statement god will take you and it's not just people in ministry we're all in ministry god will take you through some affliction so that someone else can be comforted and saved so that person's salvation couldn't happen unless you went through what you went through to be a testimony to them so they could get saved which is effectual it means that it works in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer or whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation so again we get afflicted we get delivered it's for you it's for someone else isn't that a different way to look at the trials that we go through we're we tend to be so hyper focused on what we're going through and if we just looked at it like paul paul is saying i'm going through something very difficult going through a hard trial i'm going through suffering it's for you so that you would get saved so that you would get delivered so that you would be comforted that turns the focus from me to others and that in itself will turn you from complaining about the trial to rejoicing god is doing something amazing through this circumstance and our hope of you is steadfast knowing that as you are partakers participants of the sufferings so shall you be also of the consolation he's connecting those things together like it's a sure thing right if if you participate in suffering you're gonna participate in comfort can you say thank you lord that that's a promise if you're suffering if you're going through a hard trial say thank you lord comfort's coming consolation's coming for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia amen so here's paul saying i want you to understand something that we went through testifying of what they went through that we were pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we despaired even of life you know there's this thing that we see and says god won't put on you something more than what you can handle uh yeah he will yeah he will he did paul he'll continually put things in your lives that you can't handle why because he's god because he is powerful he's mighty to deliver and he wants us not trusting in ourselves i think i'm getting i'm getting to the next scripture but we had this sentence of death in ourselves that's dire i was sure i was sure to be a dead man that's basically what he's saying i was a goner but why did we have this not for no reason this wasn't purposeless it wasn't pointless it was so that we would not trust in ourselves but in god which raises the dead and so yep you're going to get things put on you that you cannot handle that you cannot deal with and you're going to lift your hands and say lord i can't i don't know i don't know how to make it through and he's going to say trust in me i raise the dead don't trust in yourselves if we only were given what we could handle then where would our faith be in me in my abilities who delivered us from so great at death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us in other words i was i was i was delivered in the past from death i can trust this god who's delivered me in the past to continually deliver me until it's time my time to go it's like brother jason said i'm i'm immortal i'm unkillable until it's time for god to take me home and so not because i have some superpower but because god has a eternal purpose that cannot be blocked philippians 3 10 that i may know him and the power of his resurrection that's good i like that i want to know him in the power of his resurrection let's just stop there can we just do part a of that verse and not move on but they go together don't they if you don't put them together you're not going to get either part you need and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death this is directly absolutely linked our life in him has to be made conformable to his death if our life is not continually in this process of him cleaning us making us conformable to his death we're not going to know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings you might get an anointing you might get excited you might shout you might dance but that's not getting more like jesus that's people do that at rock concerts at baseball games football games they do it way better than you do that don't make you a christian it's good to shout and i believe in all that i do but from a heart that has been changed that's experienced these trials these sufferings and says i'm going to savor christ more than i savor this life then shout and dance we should be shouting and dancing right now but sometimes the word is heavy isn't it sometimes it carries a weight and we we we begin to think and i've said it before to in private but you know many ministers they want to get you so excited and i failed if i didn't get the people jumping and shouting and screaming amen and i think man when i say something and they're so quiet i know that it's it's hit its point because there's a great reverence that takes place sometimes and there's a trembling that happens inside of us there's a trembling in me many times when i preach the word because there this is this is god we're talking about this is truth we're talking about it's heavy it's not just a dancing party every time sometimes it causes us to go on our our knees sometimes it causes us to be still and know that he is god and in all of these things i mean i have i'm emotional i get excited i get thankful but in all of this i want to be more like jesus christ that's my goal in my life that's the purpose that i have the purpose in my ministry is to help you be more like jesus christ to for you to grow for you to be strengthened to for you to have the have the power of the word in your life that you can go through hard trials and trust in the lord it's not just about looking good and we man we had good meetings you still see those people they're hanging from the chandeliers no i want to see you living and looking like jesus christ that's my goal and if you hang from the chandeliers praise the lord colossians 1 24 who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church who now rejoice in my sufferings lord give us that attitude all i can say is i'm helpless because my flesh does not rejoice in sufferings my flesh wants to complain about sufferings so it we have to be out of the flesh we gotta be in the spirit we gotta we gotta we we gotta see things the way god sees things and he says fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his body sake it sort of sounds like he's saying that maybe the cross was not sufficient like he didn't suffer enough so we've got to suffer more so that christ suffers more but i don't believe that's what it's saying because that sacrifice was perfect and it's once for all he doesn't need to suffer again and again he suffered once for all and it completed the work that god had for him to do there to bring salvation but there is this aspect where there is suffering that takes place in the body of christ and if you remember i think i have that as the next verse yeah saul persecuting the church and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecute us thou me well saul was persecuting jesus how was he persecuting jesus by persecuting the church and so there needs to be a filling up of those afflictions there's afflictions that we need to go through to perfect the church right we have to be perfected to go on the rapture god he's he's sending his word to perfect us but he also sends trials and suffering to perfect us so there's like a there's a measure that he has it says okay the the suffering has to be filled up this much and so christ is suffering jesus is being persecuted through us in our body in his body which is the church all right romans 8 17 i think i'm coming to the end though i have no idea actually i'm ceased following my notes here just want to make sure i'm calling up the musicians at the right time but and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorif be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us again directly connecting our glory with suffering you're not going to get there to glory without first having suffered suffered for the sake of the gospel and it's not worthy the sufferings of this present time are not even worthy to be compared i mean think about it there's times where you're so consumed by what you're going through you can't imagine even getting through it and here paul is saying it's not even worth the comparison let's not even take time let's not waste our time to try to compare these two things because the glory is so beyond what the suffering is we're going through second timothy 2 12. if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us so if if again this is a if if you suffer then you'll reign with him we want to reign with the lord then you're going to have to suffer that's not nice why why do i have to do that because it's it's god's program to perfect to produce character second timothy 3 12 yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution so before i go forward just take a second god could have created all of us instantly from the dust put us on a perfect world and we could have lived eternally together rejoicing in god but god did not want to do that he put adam and eve and he put in them the capabilities to fall and produce all the evil that we see in this world today the good that god produces in his children and for his glory far exceeds what it would have been if god would have just made it easy and perfect for all of us for all of eternity we never would have understood who god is we never would have understood his character we never we never would have reached a place of maturity if everything's just perfect for your children and they're just spoiled to death what happens rottenness is what happens they've got everything that they want and they they they never corrected they never face any difficulties the minute anything comes their way any testing comes their way they crumble they absolutely crumble and so for god for god to bring about perfection the world had to be exactly the way it was from the spirit and church age why does he stand by the reason is in romans 8 17 and 18 and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed in us unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character is simply never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is set down in his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter his kingdom through much tribulation amen we we need it why do we suffer because we need it we need it because we need character and god that's how god builds character in us and in lives and there's no there's no short there's no shortcut to that it comes through hard trials and difficulties in the sermon shalom god is a jealous god remember suffering for his word's sake is growing pains of his grace when you suffer for his word's sake it's just growing pains you know how a little kid 10 12 years old gets pains come and say mama my arms hurt and my legs are hurting so forth it's growing pains it shows he's got some good vitamins he's growing up sometimes it takes trials to break the bands of the world off of us take you out of the world might be have to take you out of your creed first like the man drowning in the river you have to take him out of the river before you get the river out of the man that's about the way god has to do sometimes let them throw you out one time then they get the world out of you got to get you out of the world first sometimes these growing pains is what does that oh yes so no again no bypassing when you're when if you want to grow to be an adult you have to go through some growing pains if you want to grow to be a mature christian you're gonna have to go through some pains and some trials ii corinthians 12 7 the apostle paul and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations in other words unless lest i would be given over to pride in my own self in my own position in god what did god do there was given to me a thorn in the flesh listen to what he says this is shocking if you really hear it the messenger the angel the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure so paul prayed three times lord take this away from me and the lord said no i have something better whatever this was was a bad thing right paul was it was a suffering it was a trial and he was saying lord deliver me and the lord saying no actually i am delivering you because much worse than this affliction in your body is the affliction of pride that you would get in your own position of revelation and understanding of the mysteries of the word of god so this is a better more positive thing to have this place of suffering than to be than to ruin your life because the root of all sin is pride so the lord was saying no paul i'm not going to allow you go that direction i'm not let you get puffed up and destroy yourself and others around you i'm going to allow this bad thing to be in your life to keep you humble doesn't the lord love us and he says your character in eternity is much more valued than a temporary deliverance from a bodily affliction don't say i'm preaching against healing i'm not i believe in healing with all my heart but sometimes god says no do you know that this is what this this is paul prayed for divine healing in his life and god said nope you're going to have that the rest of your life we say oh that's not you promised healing i did promise healing i almost pro i also promise victory and because of that i'm allowing this in your life for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee listen to this for my strength is made perfect in weakness he just said you're strong when you're weak no it's god's strength in you so when you're weak when you're afflicted when you're suffering that's when god's power is the strongest in your life you say no it's when i'm delivered and i'm i've i'm on the top of the pile and i'm the i'm the best and i'm in the place that i've always wanted to be no no it's in that place of affliction in that trial in that difficulty god's power is the strongest in you god's strength is perfect when we're weak most gladly listen to this now he changes he prayed lord deliver me this is hard this is difficult i i i can't i can't do it take it away from me and the lord says no my grace is sufficient for you and he says okay i'll change my i've changed my direction oh lord thank you for this infirmity hallelujah i've got this trial in my life lord praise god he was dancing he was dancing shouting giving god glory for his infirmity that's the place that we if we want to go on the rapture and be mature christians this is where this is what the lord is taking us to is to rejoice to glory in our infirmities why that the power of christ may rest upon you you want the power of christ in your life there's a price to be paid it's not just coming to church and yelling it's not just coming to church throwing your hands up and screaming that's all fine that's great they do that at the ball game too that it that's not a christian life stop getting that thing in your oh we had great meetings well how about we had great meetings i died to myself i rejoiced in my infirmity oh he had a warm fuzzy when that guy was singing that song today what a good meeting okay that's good but that's not the christian life the christian life is at your home at your job in the midst of suffering a terrible trial in the midst of tears and saying god you're faithful i don't know what's happening i don't know why it's i'm going through this but you are faithful and i believe you and i trust you i don't know what's going to happen i might lose my life i might i might my family member might lose their life i might but you your power is resting in me right now when i don't feel like it how many times when you're in the trial and suffering you said oh i just feel like the power of christ is just flowing through me so strong sometimes most of the time you don't feel anything but that's when the power of christ is resting upon you if we have the right vision that's important remember paul immediately switches from okay i'm not going to be healed from this and he says i will glory in my infirmities that's that's a caveat that the power of christ may rest on me so do you want the power of christ in your life and start glorying in your infirmities in other words you can't do that unless the lord changes your attitude and your heart about them you're not going to achieve that by force of will because it's contrary to human will therefore i take pleasure in infirmities said no human being ever but a spirit-filled person that surrendered their life to the lord says this is my pleasure lord to go through this trial and through this suffering and through this reproach and through these necessities and through these persecutions and through this distress for the sake of christ it's my pleasure to do that you can't make that up that's not fakeable that has to be the lord for get this printed up on a shirt brother brad for when i'm weak then i'm strong uh that's god's equations the world's equations when you're weak you're weak and when you're strong then you're strong but in god's economy he works his equations different weakness oh look at the power in that weak person look at that omnipotent power dwelling in the weakness of that person's heart they know they're weak they know they can't do anything they they know that they don't have any power that's when the strength of the lord is in you that's a different that's a different equation that's a that's a person who has their citizenship in heaven whose focus is on heavenly things not on earthly things all right musicians if you'd come for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding an eternal weight of glory so it's in other words it's a momentary light affliction i mean it happened for paul for over a long period of time but in comparison to eternity the things that we go through are momentary and light and it says it worketh for us in other words it achieves there's an achievement that comes from the afflictions that we go through for the sake of the gospel there's an achievement what is that achievement a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory far more exceeding is repeating the words twice and excessively exceeding is what paul is saying an excessively exceeding eternal weight of glory so the affliction is light in other words it's it's heaviness its weight is light in comparison to the weight that the glory that god has for us so think of it this way every trial every affliction everything that you go go through every suffering that you've gone through in your life god it's not meaningless it's not purposeless god has a purpose in the midst of it it's doing something in eternity you say i'm just suffering it's so hard i i i can't make it through the lord is working out something in your life but even better even greater is those things you're going through god is carving out that body you know brother branham says there's a theophany and these vitamins the word is coming i believe this is also connected to that our sufferings the trials that we have the reward that we get for eternity is directly connected to the sufferings and the trials and how we go through them so we want we want that theophany body we have to feed on the word we also have to surrender to the will of the lord in our life that is going to achieve something for us while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal they're temporary but the things which are not seen are eternal we have to be looking at heavenly things we have to value what happens in this life according to that which is from eternity right if we value what's going on in this life and just it's just things we go through right now and we don't see how it impacts the eternal weight of glory we're missing it and it will negatively impact your attitude how in the world can you rejoice in infirmities and distresses and enjoy rejoice in sufferings and trials because you know this is light and it's momentary there's something that's eternal that god is doing through this thing i'm going through right now and it has great meaning amen let's stand heavenly father we're so thankful for your goodness and your mercy in our lives lord our desire lord is to be what your
