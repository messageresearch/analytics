[36:11] chapter 3 this is Nicodemus who we know
[36:14] the Bible says is a Jew who comes to
[36:17] Jesus by night he asks
[36:19] him uh this question in verse two he
[36:21] says for no man can do these Miracles
[36:24] that thou doest except God be with him
[36:27] Jesus answered and said unto him verily
[36:29] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[36:33] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[36:38] God now it doesn't mean that he can't
[36:41] understand principles the word the
[36:44] manuscripts Nicodemus was a scholar he
[36:47] was a Jew he could read all of that but
[36:49] Jesus is speaking of something greater
[36:51] when he says a man can't see the kingdom
[36:54] of God see their friends how many
[36:56] believes that without the Holy Ghost you
[36:58] can't even see the kingdom of God how
[37:01] many believes that you could learn about
[37:03] it you can read about it uh but you
[37:06] can't see you can't really truly see the
[37:09] kingdom of God until you're born of the
[37:11] spirit of God notice this here
[37:13] Revelations chapter 3 I'm sorry uh John
[37:16] chapter 3 sorry I just had a text come
[37:18] in want to make sure we get to and he
[37:20] says here he cannot see Nicodemus says
[37:23] in verse 4 how can a man be born again
[37:24] when he's old can he enter the second
[37:27] time into to his mother's womb and be
[37:28] born Jesus answered verily verily I say
[37:30] unto thee except a man be born of water
[37:34] and of the spirit he cannot enter the
[37:37] kingdom of God that which is born of
[37:39] Flesh of the flesh is flesh and that
[37:41] which is born of the spirit is Spirit
[37:44] Marvel not that I say unto thee you must
[37:46] be born again the wind bloweth where it
[37:48] listeth and thou hearest the sound
[37:50] thereof but can't not tell from where it
[37:53] came and where it goes so is everyone
[37:56] that is born
[37:58] of the spirit amen let's turn also to
[38:01] Acts chapter 2 very familiar and I'll
[38:03] have you be seated amen Acts chapter
[38:10] 2 amen before I read that I'll just

[38:56] Peter and to the rest of the Apostles
[38:58] men and Brethren what shall we do now

[39:04] we do you know sometimes we make
[39:06] Christianity about rules and what you
[39:08] can't do but that wasn't their question
[39:10] when they heard the gospel they said
[39:12] what can we do not what we can't do what
[39:15] can we do I love that what can we do to
[39:18] be saved Peter said unto them
[39:21] repent and be baptized every one of you

[39:27] remission of sins and you shall receive
[39:30] the gift of the Holy Ghost Lord Jesus we

[39:38] opportunity to be able to serve you Lord
[39:40] in this capacity Lord we thank you
[39:42] Father for providing all of our needs
[39:46] your Prophet taught us Lord that

[41:06] the mental faculties that's where it
[41:07] starts Lord but let it go on down to the
[41:10] reaches of our very soul lord where you
[41:13] can affect a change in our life Grant it
[41:16] now Lord Jesus we pray in Jesus Christ's
[41:18] name amen you can be seated this
[41:23] morning I won't get to this uh brother
[41:26] Mark you could display that if you want
[41:28] or just have scriptures ready I won't
[41:30] get to this entire sermon I know that I
[41:32] won't today and uh and so we'll just go
[41:35] as far as we can and I'll just be good
[41:37] try to be good about uh remaining just
[41:40] with my notes here today as I know the
[41:42] Lord just I directed me uh on some of
[41:45] these things that I'm going to preach on
[41:47] so um I'm going to do a little bit of
[41:50] teaching teaching and preaching I didn't
[41:53] get my words mixed up I meant to say
[41:54] that and so sometimes I believe that
[41:57] it's good just for us to look at some of
[41:59] these things and I just want to lay just
[42:01] a little bit of my heart out on the way
[42:03] the Lord uh has just dealt with me in
[42:06] such a way uh even over months now and I
[42:09] just uh just now coming to be able to
[42:11] preach this and so I just want to uh to
[42:14] say a few things just at at the start
[42:17] we're preaching to you on the autopsy of
[42:19] a dead Revival you know I believe that
[42:22] this is many times uh this question that
[42:26] has been asked and I and I could I could
[42:28] phrase it for you the way that I wrote
[42:30] it down concerning this the new birth
[42:33] that we read about in John chapter three
[42:35] and also uh in the book of Acts chapter
[42:38] 2 we could ask this question quite
[42:40] simply and I'm sure much many of us has
[42:43] asked this question so simple what is
[42:46] the new birth or when we ask the
[42:48] question in the same way what is the
[42:51] Holy Ghost I like to use that word
[42:54] because ghost is a word that the
[42:57] scripture uses and we want to be
[42:59] biblical in the way that we express the
[43:02] nature of God now brother bham said that
[43:04] even amongst the Pentecostal Church they
[43:06] had gotten to the point to where they
[43:08] didn't want to say ghost and so he said
[43:11] they would say holy spirit think about
[43:13] that now he says of course the Holy
[43:16] Spirit and the Holy Ghost are the same
[43:19] thing but people when they say holy
[43:21] ghost it identifies them with people
[43:24] that speak in tongues people that
[43:26] believe in in the moving of the spirit
[43:28] people that roll on the floor and are
[43:30] called Holy Rollers or kick the
[43:31] furniture like we read Wednesday but I
[43:34] just want to tell you uh here today I'm
[43:36] not ashamed of the Holy Ghost and I
[43:39] don't believe we ought to be ashamed to
[43:41] use those kind of words as long as we
[43:44] are identifying them with the book of
[43:46] Acts Church
[43:50] am and so notice here we ask this
[43:53] question what is the Holy Ghost brother
[43:55] bham says that in theage message what is
[43:57] the Holy Ghost 1959 he says what is the
[44:00] Holy Ghost it's a seal what is the Holy
[44:03] Ghost it's a covenant What is the Holy
[44:05] Ghost it's a sign what is the Holy Ghost
[44:08] it's the spirit of Jesus Christ in
[44:14] you and so we ask the same question we
[44:16] could say here as I got them here before
[44:18] me what does it mean to be born again
[44:22] Nicodemus asked the same exact question
[44:24] what does it mean to be born again I'm
[44:27] just going to list some of these really
[44:29] without giving a direct answer yet as I
[44:31] just lay a foundation and get you in the
[44:33] same frame of mind as the Lord has me uh
[44:37] you could ask the question brother Matt
[44:39] is receiving the Holy Ghost and being
[44:42] born again the same thing or are they
[44:45] two separate things to be born again or
[44:48] to be filled with the Holy Ghost now you
[44:52] have to be I believe rightly dividing
[44:53] the word correctly you would find that
[44:56] even brother brandom in the early stages
[44:59] of his ministry he he he begins to
[45:02] answer the same exact question in a way
[45:04] that's very different after the angel of
[45:06] the Lord corrects him so we don't want
[45:08] to take something that brother brandham
[45:09] says uh early and then make a Doctrine
[45:12] out of that right hello and so we want
[45:16] to make sure that we're following this
[45:18] line must be upon line precept be upon
[45:20] precept here a little there little and
[45:22] so we know that this is the way the Lord
[45:24] revealed to him what is the true New
[45:26] Birth
[45:27] is the Holy Ghost the same or being born
[45:30] with the spirit of God is it the same as
[45:33] be fil being filled with the Holy Ghost
[45:35] are we born then we could say brother
[45:38] Matt we could ask this question are we
[45:40] born again in a different way being
[45:44] under the opes of the message of the
[45:46] hour are we now born again in a
[45:49] different way than they were born again
[45:53] in the book of Acts that's the question
[45:56] how about throughout the church ages
[45:58] through the ministry of Martin the
[46:00] ministry of Columba the ministry of of
[46:03] of Wesley are we born again differently
[46:06] uh were those then we could ask this
[46:08] question brother Matt were those under
[46:11] that were under Martin's Martin Luther's
[46:14] message or John Wesley's message were
[46:16] they born again were they truly born
[46:19] again um or or were they just saved
[46:23] what's the difference is there a
[46:24] difference brother Matt in being
[46:27] saved as we that word is very popular to
[46:31] use especially amongst evangelicals and
[46:34] Southern Baptist and people that we live
[46:35] in here in this part of the country we
[46:37] love using that word I'm saved well can
[46:40] I just say that if you go and I would
[46:42] give you reference after reference after
[46:44] reference that every single time that
[46:48] the Greek word is used for saved it is
[46:52] never used in the same way that most
[46:56] modern churches teach
[46:59] saved and the Very one important
[47:02] distinction that I think should just be
[47:05] uh an
[47:06] illumination I'll give you one of the
[47:08] most popular for God so loved the world
[47:11] am that he gave us only begotten son
[47:14] that whosoever should believe on him
[47:16] should not perish perish but shall have
[47:20] everlasting life for God so loved the
[47:21] world that he sent his only son and so
[47:23] we take that word there saved but I want
[47:26] you to to to just think of one thing in
[47:28] your mind that there is in in the in the
[47:32] original Hebrew language and I'm I'm not
[47:34] a a grammar teacher the opposite of
[47:37] whatever a grammar teacher is that's
[47:39] brother Matt and so but there's the it's
[47:42] called the
[47:43] continual um uh uh uh I'm not going to
[47:46] get the word right so I better not even
[47:48] say it let you just fade out and try to
[47:50] correct me in your own mind I'll just
[47:52] say it this way that in the Hebrew
[47:54] there's a way to say a certain word that
[47:56] we don't have any English and so when
[47:58] the King James or the Bible was
[48:00] translated into English it failed to
[48:02] grab the true meaning of what the Hebrew
[48:05] thought was or the Greek sorry was
[48:07] meaning and it's a continuation it's
[48:09] something that is a is a is a word that
[48:12] continues in other words you are it's
[48:15] not that you are saved but that you are
[48:17] being saved amen amen and so it's
[48:21] actually always used in this context to
[48:24] say I am saved I am being saved and one
[48:29] day I will be saved and to say all three
[48:32] of those things could be saying it
[48:34] correctly I was saved I am being saved
[48:38] and I will be saved is ought to speak
[48:40] the same exact thing that salvation was
[48:43] never Jesus never came listen to save us
[48:47] from
[48:49] hell did you know that that Jesus
[48:54] Yeshua Emmanuel
[48:57] his name meant Jesus Savior to save you
[49:01] from your sins
[49:05] amen hell being saved from hell is just
[49:09] the result of being saved from your
[49:12] sins I I want to make sure we get that
[49:15] clear because you say brother mat why
[49:16] are we bringing some why are we teaching
[49:18] on some of these I could just be a
[49:20] simple as I can here today and say that
[49:23] what what are you preaching on brother
[49:24] Matt how to become a Christian
[49:27] could there be anything more basic than
[49:31] that question how to become a Christian
[49:35] could we preach on anything now you may
[49:37] be able to come up with something but in
[49:38] my own mind I couldn't think of anything
[49:41] more basic but more
[49:44] necessary then how do I become a
[49:48] Christian it's amazing because even that
[49:51] word can lose its value and and take
[49:53] steer uh steer someone's mind in the
[49:55] wrong direction because even that word
[49:58] Christian I'm a Christian they they
[50:00] never called themselves that Jesus never
[50:03] said go into all the world preaching the
[50:05] gospel and and make people
[50:09] Christians but the Bible says they were
[50:11] first called Christians to Antioch in
[50:12] other words they never called thems a
[50:14] Christian but the people in the world
[50:17] seeing their life noted that they had
[50:20] been with Jesus Christ and so they were
[50:23] called
[50:24] Christians but the words of Jesus which
[50:27] is more properly understood is make
[50:30] disciples
[50:32] am you see why it's so important when
[50:35] you're a disciple and not don't call
[50:37] yourself a Christian I called myself a
[50:38] Christian but it's so much more so much
[50:41] more value if we look at it differently
[50:44] as not I'm a Christian but I'm a
[50:46] disciple because when you say I'm a
[50:47] Christian it speaks of a completed
[50:50] completeness that I've arrived I'm there
[50:52] but I'll just be honest with you and
[50:53] tell you friends sometimes I don't feel
[50:55] like a Christian hello somebody
[50:57] sometimes I don't feel like a a real
[50:59] representative of Jesus so I just say
[51:01] I'm not I'm a disciple in other words
[51:04] I'm learning to be like Jesus I'm I'm
[51:07] I'm I'm got an ambition to be like Jesus
[51:10] I'm his
[51:12] disciple I'm disciplining myself to be a
[51:15] disciple of Jesus so it goes back to not
[51:19] saved as we use that Baptist terminology
[51:22] are you saved and they they call it a
[51:25] you know making a a a a declaration
[51:29] that's not that word but making a uh a a
[51:32] commitment sorry say it making a
[51:35] confession and so we've used that word
[51:38] in the Billy gramy you know revivals
[51:40] that they come to make a you know a
[51:42] confession they they come up for
[51:44] confirmation and repeat the sinner's
[51:47] prayer and say these words after me but
[51:49] listen friends you you you'll never be
[51:51] able to get to eternal life if you come
[51:55] by some other way than was the way given
[52:00] in the book of
[52:03] Acts as brother brandham said that's why
[52:05] they they they holler and Shout the way
[52:08] that they do and he says they get
[52:10] nothing because he says it it will be
[52:13] revealed in the Thunders that that and
[52:14] he's speaking of that new name in other
[52:16] words when the Jews came to offer a lamb
[52:19] now they got nothing because the lamb
[52:21] had ceased the physical lamb and brother
[52:23] baram says and at the moment that
[52:25] denomination s stay with me crucified
[52:29] the word he says from then on
[52:31] denominational systems were dead amen
[52:35] amen at that moment and now he says it's
[52:39] the word and the word only and then he
[52:42] says that's been just
[52:47] recently and so notice we use this word
[52:49] saved but really saved means I'm being
[52:53] saved and he didn't come to save us from
[52:56] hell he came to save us from
[52:59] sins and so Peter gives this very first
[53:02] qu very first answer he says you know
[53:05] repent and that that's important I could
[53:07] just say as fundamental as I could
[53:09] possibly be here it always must start
[53:14] with
[53:16] repentance amen amen you will never come
[53:20] to being born again without coming to
[53:24] repentance amen that's right
[53:27] you say brother Matt as a Believer do
[53:28] you continue to repent every day that's
[53:31] right amen but as a Believer coming to
[53:35] God you must first repent that is one of
[53:38] the most
[53:39] lost Concepts if you call it that one of
[53:42] the most lost truths that happened
[53:44] through the Dark Ages was real true
[53:46] repentance not a prayer but a true
[53:50] repentance
[53:51] even even the the the Reformation
[53:57] in an attempt to get so far away from
[54:00] Catholicism and Catholicism had what
[54:03] confession and so through the
[54:05] Reformation they became so polarized
[54:08] against confession that they because the
[54:10] priest you know to come to God you must
[54:12] come before a priest and a and you must
[54:14] confess to
[54:15] him but can I say that if we're not
[54:19] careful we we trying to not be something
[54:22] so hard that we take confession
[54:24] completely out
[54:27] amen and confession to conversion is
[54:30] essential amen amen I'm not talking
[54:34] about coming up here and confessing to
[54:35] me your sins but can I just stop and say
[54:37] as the Holy Spirit leads me to say this
[54:40] sometimes what we lack is True
[54:44] Confession it's like a man come to a man
[54:47] and said I I want to be saved oh you
[54:48] want I want to be Christian oh you want
[54:50] to repent yes what do you want to repent
[54:52] from
[54:54] sin notice the Bible never says to
[54:57] repent from sin but to repent from
[55:01] sins it's so powerful when a person
[55:04] starts to confess the sins that they
[55:08] want to be saved
[55:10] from because it's very easy as the man
[55:13] said well all sin well you didn't commit
[55:15] all sin remember what brother bam says
[55:17] when he's talking about Adam and he says
[55:19] when you repent now do you repent for
[55:21] Adam's
[55:23] sin that's not a trick question you can
[55:25] answer it when you repent do we repent
[55:28] from Adam's sin brother mam says no you
[55:30] didn't commit Adam's sin you repent for
[55:33] your
[55:34] sins I think we water down true
[55:38] conversion when we just tell people to
[55:40] repent of sin and we that that thought
[55:42] of repent and of sin is just I repent
[55:44] for sin all sin all sin no you didn't
[55:46] commit all sin sometimes it's powerful
[55:49] to be specific with God and say Lord
[55:51] this is what I'm struggling with this is
[55:53] the sin I sinned against you and you
[55:56] start to you start to let the Lord
[55:59] expose your life and then you say I've
[56:01] committed this sin and this sin you
[56:03] don't confess to a priest but you should
[56:05] confess to the high priest your high
[56:07] priest who's the high priest after your
[56:09] confession the Bible says confession
[56:12] is
[56:15] good for the
[56:20] soul I just I just I I I feel led just
[56:23] to stay right here so I'm going to for a
[56:25] moment confession is good for the soul
[56:30] sometimes to get rid of a demon spirit
[56:33] in a person's life they have to renounce
[56:37] that's what brother Bram T that spirit
[56:40] that they've worshiped amen not just to
[56:42] come up and say deliver me deliver me
[56:44] deliver me but deliver you from what
[56:46] that's why I love brother Diggs when he
[56:48] came through our first Youth Camp and he
[56:50] C and he just came to me with a
[56:52] inspiration said brother Matt I love all
[56:54] types of prayer lines I love it when we
[56:56] have a prayer line where you know you
[56:58] just everyone passes through a tunnel
[56:59] and you lay your hands on them God I've
[57:01] seen God do Miracles and God did one in
[57:02] my own life through that kind of prayer
[57:04] line I've seen God bring out discernment
[57:06] through the Ministries saying things in
[57:08] their prayer that discern my heart but
[57:10] brother dig says but I believe sometimes
[57:12] there's a power to confession when you
[57:14] go one on-one and you ask that young
[57:16] person because many times we fall into
[57:18] the Trap of coming up for prayer because
[57:20] we're convicted and then we go PR what
[57:22] do what do you need brother well I just
[57:24] want to be closer to the lord well
[57:25] that's wonderful all of us want that but
[57:28] be specific what do you want the Lord to
[57:32] do for
[57:33] you if you ever stand up with brother
[57:35] digs in a perlon that's his question
[57:36] what do you want the Lord to do for you
[57:38] brother what do you want the the Lord to
[57:40] do for you sister and then you can see
[57:42] the dawning on a young person's face
[57:44] when they think for a minute wait a
[57:46] minute I need to be specific this is a
[57:49] relationship not just deliver me from
[57:51] sin because I'm a sinner but deliver me
[57:53] from these sins yes is that all right
[57:57] church amen because confession and
[58:01] sometimes a demon's Spirit has a
[58:03] stronghold in someone's life because
[58:05] they've never openly confessed it if you
[58:08] ever came to John the Baptist and wanted
[58:10] to be saved wanted to be baptized he
[58:12] would ask you to confess your sins make
[58:15] a public declaration if you confess can
[58:18] I give you the Bible if you confess with
[58:21] your mouth and believe in your heart
[58:25] right and so sometimes confession has a
[58:28] power of
[58:30] loosing sometimes we need to be very
[58:32] specific in renouncing that's why the
[58:35] the the the that sunlight you ever take
[58:39] something that's mildewy and moldy and
[58:41] dead and cold put it in the sunlight and
[58:44] when you bring it out into the Sun and
[58:46] expose it it kills the bacteria amen you
[58:50] know sometimes one of the greatest
[58:52] things that will eliminate sin is
[58:55] bringing that sin out in the
[58:57] open and exposing
[59:02] it sometimes the greatest deliverances
[59:05] start with I've never told this to
[59:08] anybody
[59:10] amen because the devil wants to take
[59:13] those things in our life and hide them
[59:16] shut them away well you confessed it who
[59:18] did you confess it to as brother bandam
[59:20] said if you sinned against your wife you
[59:22] ought to go to your wife and confess it
[59:23] to
[59:24] her now now that doesn't mean you know
[59:27] like one man he he got so convicted of
[59:29] sin that he just you know after he got
[59:31] saved and got born again and he really
[59:33] you know really took confession to the
[59:35] the next level and he had back when he
[59:37] was a teenager he had committed a crime
[59:38] and so he went to the police department
[59:40] and said I just want to confess to this
[59:41] crime and you know 19 such and such you
[59:43] know what they did they put him in court
[59:45] they charged that man with that crime
[59:47] put him in court and he went to jail for
[59:48] three months and LED 55 people to the
[59:51] Lord Jesus in jail
[59:56] you know what he did after he got out in
[59:58] 3 months he thought of another crime he
[59:59] had committed about a year before that
[1:00:01] he went back to the police station and
[1:00:03] confess that sin and so they arrested
[1:00:05] him put him back in jail for six more
[1:00:07] months and he led almost a hundred more
[1:00:09] men to the Lord Jesus and he said I want
[1:00:12] to declare something I am the only
[1:00:13] preacher fully funded by the US
[1:00:18] government now I'm not telling you to go
[1:00:20] that
[1:00:22] far but if the Lord convicts you of
[1:00:25] something friends I just believe
[1:00:26] sometimes we get so far away from these
[1:00:28] original principles and can I just stop
[1:00:31] here and say that you counsel people
[1:00:33] with trouble and issues and you talk to
[1:00:35] people over years I've spoken to people
[1:00:37] and about the troubles that they're
[1:00:38] having in their life and sometimes some
[1:00:40] major struggles and I've just found that
[1:00:43] cutting to the chase sometimes not
[1:00:45] trying to dissect the attributes of that
[1:00:47] current problem but just asking one
[1:00:49] question tell me about your
[1:00:52] conversion amen amen tell me stop for a
[1:00:56] moment forget that you're married for 30
[1:00:58] years now 10 years and you're been in
[1:01:01] church for all these years let's go back
[1:01:03] to your original moment tell me a little
[1:01:05] bit about how you were saved yes and
[1:01:09] most of the time you'll find that the
[1:01:11] trouble is
[1:01:13] linked to the
[1:01:16] conversion so we ask the question is
[1:01:19] there a difference between being saved
[1:01:21] and redeemed brother Bram God hiding
[1:01:24] himself in Simplicity 196 63 how many
[1:01:27] more in here wants the Holy Ghost let's
[1:01:29] see your hand brother brandham says how
[1:01:30] many 1 2 3 4 oh no oh my no need of
[1:01:33] going without it there's 8 10 here 11 11
[1:01:36] 12 maybe here who needs the Holy Ghost
[1:01:39] listen to what brother bam says here I
[1:01:41] don't have this for the screen we want
[1:01:43] you saved friend we want you filled
[1:01:47] remember you are saved of course when
[1:01:51] you accept
[1:01:53] Christ now that happens here
[1:01:56] yeah you're saved but you're not
[1:02:00] converted until you receive the Holy
[1:02:04] Ghost amen so there's a difference
[1:02:07] between salvation and Redemption right
[1:02:10] that's why Peter could accept the Lord
[1:02:13] Jesus do miracles in his name and still
[1:02:16] curse and use profanity and say he
[1:02:18] doesn't even know him and deny him three
[1:02:20] times Jesus told Peter the night of the
[1:02:22] Betrayal he was already saved Peter
[1:02:26] Jesus said now after you're converted
[1:02:30] strengthen your brethren that's right
[1:02:32] you accepted Christ as your savior but
[1:02:35] when you're converted is when you're
[1:02:37] really changed that's right and he
[1:02:40] wasn't changed yet he cursed before the
[1:02:43] Lord denied him in everything but after
[1:02:45] I love that his conversion Art Thou
[1:02:48] after Thou Art converted strengthen your
[1:02:51] brother is that right that's what the
[1:02:52] scripture says anyhow that makes it
[1:02:54] right Jesus told Peter that had followed
[1:02:56] him cast out Devils done Miracles and
[1:02:59] everything and said you're not converted
[1:03:01] but after you're converted strengthen
[1:03:04] the Brethren right it's true says that
[1:03:07] and God had hided himself in
[1:03:09] Simplicity you go to listen to the end
[1:03:11] of that tape and there are people and
[1:03:13] brother bam at the very end of that
[1:03:15] sermon not I actually I'm getting that
[1:03:17] wrong it was actually the first seal I
[1:03:19] believe at the very end of the first
[1:03:21] seal brother Bron makes an altar call
[1:03:23] and says anyone in here need the Holy
[1:03:24] Ghost and people start coming forward
[1:03:26] you go to listen as that tape ends might
[1:03:28] be God has hide himself in Simplicity I
[1:03:30] was just listening to it and here's
[1:03:32] people wanting to come up and be born
[1:03:34] again wanted to come up and be you know
[1:03:36] laid hands laid upon them do you believe
[1:03:38] in that brother Matt well the book of
[1:03:39] Acts teaches it does do we do we require
[1:03:42] it no you don't require it but I want
[1:03:44] you to notice God will meet you at
[1:03:46] whatever faith that you
[1:03:48] have what what comes to a natural birth
[1:03:51] I was talking to the boys yesterday when
[1:03:53] a woman gives birth what is first water
[1:03:55] yes what is second blood then breath
[1:03:59] Spirit life and sometimes to get that
[1:04:01] life they got to lay hands on that
[1:04:05] baby and then there's the Cry of life
[1:04:09] and and and and you'll only find two
[1:04:12] definite experiences in the Bible if you
[1:04:14] want to say how do we know what it's
[1:04:15] like let me just say something here you
[1:04:17] you you this may shock you but if you
[1:04:20] want to know how to become a Christian
[1:04:22] you cannot look to the four gospels to
[1:04:24] tell you how
[1:04:27] you can't you can't use Matthew Mark
[1:04:29] Luke or John to truly tell you how to
[1:04:32] become a Christian why because Matthew
[1:04:35] Mark Luke and John was in a transitional
[1:04:37] period going from law to Grace it was
[1:04:41] the dispensation of John going to the
[1:04:43] dispensation of the S so n and even
[1:04:46] Jesus in John Mark uh John chapter 7
[1:04:50] Jesus says he that believeth on me shall
[1:04:52] out of his belly flow rivers of Living
[1:04:55] Water and look in your Bible in pareses
[1:04:57] it says this he spoke of the spirit
[1:05:00] which had not yet been given for he had
[1:05:04] not yet ascended and sent his Spirit
[1:05:06] back amen so to go to the gospels is too
[1:05:10] early because the spirit had not the
[1:05:13] promise of the father had not been given
[1:05:15] if you say well then we'll go to the
[1:05:17] Book of Revelation sorry you're too late
[1:05:19] to go to the Book of Revelations even
[1:05:21] the Epistles is not where we should go
[1:05:23] to find out how to be born again you say
[1:05:26] then where brother Matt I'm going to
[1:05:27] tell you where sandwiched in the middle
[1:05:30] is a little book called The Book of the
[1:05:34] acts of the Holy Ghost amen that he did
[1:05:38] through the apostles amen and so this is
[1:05:42] why brother brandham would say this I
[1:05:43] love this so much am I do you have do I
[1:05:45] have you today amen this is why brother
[1:05:48] brandham would say this and I love this
[1:05:50] so much uh uh let me make sure I get it
[1:05:52] correct this is why even in the Old
[1:05:55] Testament I just want to catch this for
[1:05:56] a moment even in the Old Testament in
[1:05:59] type brother B would say in the pnis
[1:06:01] vision he would say that the Old
[1:06:02] Testament had seven Church ages just
[1:06:06] like the Gentile church had seven Church
[1:06:09] ages and so brother bam says he calls at
[1:06:11] the ancient Church age and he uses as
[1:06:15] you notice this here you'll find in that
[1:06:17] original Church age that original church
[1:06:19] that original age of Ages throughout the
[1:06:22] Old Testament you'll find it brother
[1:06:24] Caleb told him that today in the Book of
[1:06:26] Judges did you know that actually that
[1:06:29] judges book is a cycle that keeps
[1:06:31] repeating yeah and you would have a they
[1:06:34] would they got away from God God would
[1:06:35] send a judge which means savior it means
[1:06:38] a deliverer to save the people and then
[1:06:41] the Bible says that as long as the judge
[1:06:43] lived they would serve God under that
[1:06:45] judge but when that judge died they
[1:06:48] would go back to sinning just like they
[1:06:50] were before and so God would send
[1:06:52] another Judge Samson baric Deborah Oben
[1:06:55] all of these judges Gideon God sent
[1:06:58] these judges to deliver but notice it
[1:07:00] was a type of church ages to where as
[1:07:03] long as brother brandham said the
[1:07:05] messenger was alive the people lived and
[1:07:08] believed under that message and he says
[1:07:10] but when that messenger died he says it
[1:07:13] would last for just a little while and
[1:07:15] then those people would denominate
[1:07:17] around that man's
[1:07:18] teaching and God would send a plague
[1:07:21] they would put that put that bride to
[1:07:22] sleep and then would go into another
[1:07:24] another denomination and so what would
[1:07:26] God do he would send another fire he
[1:07:28] would light it again God would send
[1:07:29] another judge God would send another
[1:07:31] messenger they would believe that man's
[1:07:33] message there would be a bride called
[1:07:35] out an elected group out of that man's
[1:07:37] message speaking of Luther Wesley all of
[1:07:40] these Church age Messengers there was a
[1:07:42] bride out of each age that believed the
[1:07:44] word for their day and came under the
[1:07:47] atonement for their day can you help me
[1:07:49] preach today and so God would seal them
[1:07:52] with the Holy Ghost and then that man
[1:07:54] would die and then brother Ram said it
[1:07:56] would happen again they would denominate
[1:07:58] around that man's teach well let me just
[1:08:00] say friends if that's what would happen
[1:08:02] in all previous six ages what do you
[1:08:04] think can happen today now that the
[1:08:06] messenger is gone I believe brother Ram
[1:08:09] said the message won't never do
[1:08:10] denominate and I believe that with all
[1:08:12] of my heart but you can be a oneman
[1:08:16] denomination sure because a denomination
[1:08:19] is brother Adam said is just a group
[1:08:21] that says it's us our four and no more
[1:08:23] and if you don't believe it the way we
[1:08:25] believe it if you don't come the way
[1:08:26] that if you don't come to my church come
[1:08:28] to my preacher I'm afraid friends
[1:08:30] sometimes that's how message churches
[1:08:32] have gotten to to where we lose the
[1:08:34] sovereignty of the local body and we try
[1:08:37] to make every church match another
[1:08:39] church and if you don't match this
[1:08:40] church in the way they worship then
[1:08:42] you're just lay it a SE and foolish
[1:08:44] virgin cold intellectual formal and if
[1:08:46] if this church over here worships and
[1:08:48] they shout and dance and speak in
[1:08:50] tongues and run around you just say oh
[1:08:51] they're just Pentecostal
[1:08:54] babies can we all just accept that God
[1:08:56] made us all
[1:08:58] different and we ain't trying to match
[1:09:00] somebody down the road or some church on
[1:09:02] another Liv stream somewhere I'm
[1:09:04] thankful for all the Ministries that God
[1:09:06] sends in the message but let me just say
[1:09:08] that brother and that church and that
[1:09:10] state and that City comes fights
[1:09:12] different Spirits has different people
[1:09:14] has different challenges has different
[1:09:16] issues and so the way he approaches the
[1:09:19] problems in his church am I to get on
[1:09:21] and and and look at that brother and say
[1:09:23] that's my pattern that's my standard
[1:09:25] that's who I ought to be like and I'm
[1:09:27] afraid that's what we have is Conformity
[1:09:29] everybody trying to match one another
[1:09:31] brother I I'm not preaching against
[1:09:32] anybody I'm not preaching against any
[1:09:34] church or any Pastor I'm just here to
[1:09:36] say that God is the the leader of the
[1:09:38] church it's not a preacher it's not it's
[1:09:40] not any man not any Ministry the leader
[1:09:43] of this church is the Holy Ghost and the
[1:09:46] Holy Ghost is different performs
[1:09:49] different acts different preaches
[1:09:51] different because why he's meeting the
[1:09:53] challenge of be South Carolina he's
[1:09:57] meeting the challenge of bethl
[1:09:59] Tabernacle and it's not that I'm right
[1:10:01] and they're wrong or they're wrong and
[1:10:03] I'm right it's that God has an army he
[1:10:06] has a body of the Holy Ghost we do
[1:10:08] better if we take the words of a prophet
[1:10:10] just be who you are be yourself and God
[1:10:14] can use
[1:10:16] you as I said you'll never slay your
[1:10:18] giant trying to use another man's
[1:10:20] slingshot God has given you a weapon to
[1:10:23] face your enemy I can't figh him you
[1:10:25] can't fight mine you just be who God
[1:10:28] made you and we'll all go home
[1:10:31] someday
[1:10:33] Hallelujah you say then what is our
[1:10:35] pattern brother Matt who are we to
[1:10:36] pattern ourselves after I'm so glad we
[1:10:39] got a Vindicated Prophet with thus
[1:10:40] sayeth the Lord Brother bam says here
[1:10:42] notice this thus what the church was at
[1:10:47] Pentecost yeah
[1:10:49] amen is the
[1:10:51] standard amen can you say Amen that is
[1:10:55] is the pattern there is no other pattern
[1:10:57] no matter what Scholars say God has not
[1:11:00] changed that pattern what God did at
[1:11:04] Pentecost he has to keep on doing until
[1:11:07] the church ages close Hallelujah those
[1:11:10] Scholars may tell you the apostolic age
[1:11:13] is over don't you believe
[1:11:17] it can we get a hearty
[1:11:20] amen even if I tell you it's it's over
[1:11:23] don't you believe it such a statement is
[1:11:25] wrong on two counts first of all it's
[1:11:27] wrong to Suppose there aren't any more
[1:11:29] Apostles just because the original 12
[1:11:32] are dead and Apostle means one scent
[1:11:33] there are many sent ones today but
[1:11:35] they're called missionaries as long as
[1:11:37] men are being called and sent for with
[1:11:39] the word of life there's an Apostolic
[1:11:41] age secondly they refer to an age of
[1:11:44] manifested holy ghost power is being
[1:11:46] over since the Bible has been completed
[1:11:48] I'm going to give you the words of a
[1:11:50] prophet that is
[1:11:52] untrue there's not even one scripture
[1:11:54] that suggests that but many conclusively
[1:11:56] states otherwise here is our proof that
[1:11:59] both of these charges are false Acts
[1:12:01] 2:38 Peter said repent and be baptized
[1:12:05] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:12:06] Christ for the remission of sin and you
[1:12:08] shall receive the Holy Ghost for the
[1:12:11] promises unto you somebody say me and to
[1:12:13] your children somebody say my children
[1:12:15] and to them that are a far off as many
[1:12:18] as the Lord Our God shall call until he
[1:12:21] stops calling the Pentecostal message
[1:12:24] and Power will thank God he didn't just
[1:12:27] say message I'm glad I got the
[1:12:29] Pentecostal message but brother I need
[1:12:31] the Pentecostal power to go along with
[1:12:33] it for God to perform the book of Acts
[1:12:36] in my life and he says what the church
[1:12:39] had at Pentecost yeah is her inalienable
[1:12:46] right I love that originally she had the
[1:12:50] pure word of God she had the power of
[1:12:52] the spirit manifested in diverse signs
[1:12:54] and wonders and Gifts of the Holy
[1:12:57] Ghost brother mam says it was persecuted
[1:13:00] I love this it wasn't very big it was
[1:13:02] hated and despised but it was led by the
[1:13:04] Holy Ghost it stayed with that original
[1:13:09] word pattern I love that so much I could
[1:13:12] just go on reading the Ephesian Church
[1:13:13] age and have you stand and be
[1:13:15] dismissed and brother bam just goes
[1:13:18] through this and I believe it's so
[1:13:19] important what the church had at
[1:13:20] Pentecost was her inalienable right can
[1:13:24] I keep on can I keep on here for a
[1:13:26] minute brother vam says that's how it
[1:13:28] done the true church how many want to be
[1:13:30] the True Church the true church will
[1:13:32] always try to be like the
[1:13:35] original at Pentecost yeah amen all
[1:13:40] right amen then what was the church at
[1:13:42] Pentecost I'm going to tell you what it
[1:13:44] was it was a church that was diverse oh
[1:13:49] yeah you go read Acts chapter 8 and Acts
[1:13:52] chapter 19 is the only two places acts
[1:13:54] 18 the only two places that you'll find
[1:13:56] true conversion that you can get an
[1:13:58] example from the book of Acts you can go
[1:14:00] through and read about Simon the
[1:14:01] Sorcerer who had believed Paul's message
[1:14:03] and so what did they do they sent Peter
[1:14:06] they sent John they sent the apostles to
[1:14:08] go and and not not not just to give them
[1:14:11] more uh teaching but the Bible says to
[1:14:14] lay hands upon them because all of
[1:14:16] Samaria had believed but they had not
[1:14:18] received the Holy Ghost
[1:14:20] righten you go read the house of
[1:14:23] conelius as we preached on Wednesday the
[1:14:25] Bible doesn't say that Peter laid his
[1:14:27] hands upon them the Bible says while
[1:14:29] Peter yet preached the
[1:14:32] gospel while Peter yet preached the
[1:14:35] gospel the Holy Ghost fell down brother
[1:14:40] if it could happen there how many
[1:14:41] believe it can happen here well Peter
[1:14:44] yeah I might lay hands on you you might
[1:14:46] receive the Holy Ghost but you don't
[1:14:47] have to have some physical evidence or
[1:14:50] physical uh confirmation the Holy Ghost
[1:14:52] can lay his hands upon you and can
[1:14:55] confirm his spirit inside of your
[1:14:59] heart but I'm afraid we want one to look
[1:15:02] like the next isn't it amazing we we all
[1:15:04] want it to well it's got to be this way
[1:15:06] well in the book of Acts it wasn't
[1:15:08] always the same way right amen hello
[1:15:13] amen oh
[1:15:15] boy got too much to get
[1:15:19] to what do what does it mean to be born
[1:15:23] again then is there something different
[1:15:25] what does brother random say the new
[1:15:26] birth is what is the new birth mystery
[1:15:28] of God reveal I know you love this
[1:15:29] Christ as the mystery that sermon is so
[1:15:31] powerful and I know you know this quote
[1:15:33] so well I'm just going to read it again
[1:15:34] brother brandom what is what is the new
[1:15:36] birth you'd say well brother brandom
[1:15:38] what is the new birth it is the
[1:15:40] Revelation somebody say Revelation it is
[1:15:44] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:15:48] personally to you amen
[1:15:53] amen and we've
[1:15:56] established you could say then brother M
[1:15:58] let me just get through all these so I
[1:15:59] don't feel when I'm done with this why
[1:16:01] didn't I get to that I needed
[1:16:03] to you say then what is here's another
[1:16:06] question we could ask what is the
[1:16:08] evidence I know brother Matt I've got to
[1:16:10] be born again and in order to be born
[1:16:13] again I've got to come through water
[1:16:15] blood
[1:16:16] spirit justification somebody help
[1:16:20] me somebody help me that's right and
[1:16:23] then brother brandom says that baptism
[1:16:25] of the Holy Ghost that Wesley came
[1:16:27] through justification Martin Luther
[1:16:29] sorry came through
[1:16:31] justification that's a heart that turns
[1:16:34] towards God it's a heart that is
[1:16:36] Justified he realized it in scripture he
[1:16:38] was he was they they get that word from
[1:16:41] actually Hagi that's where it's repeated
[1:16:44] four times in the New Testament the just
[1:16:47] shall live by faith they are quoting not
[1:16:48] Martin Luther Luther wasn't even born
[1:16:51] Luther was quoting the prophet Hagi amen
[1:16:54] when God spoke to Hagi about cursing the
[1:16:57] land and Hagi said the just shall live
[1:17:00] in other words that the just the just
[1:17:02] the righteous shall live how we going to
[1:17:05] live by faith amen and faith is a
[1:17:08] revelation you've got to come through
[1:17:10] that you can't bypass justification well
[1:17:13] then we've got to come to what
[1:17:14] sanctification Wesley as as as when
[1:17:17] Wesley came on the scene Wesley seen
[1:17:19] that all the just were living by faith
[1:17:21] but they were living just like the rest
[1:17:23] of the world
[1:17:25] and so he preaches a message of
[1:17:27] sanctification but remember brother bam
[1:17:29] said that's the blood that's that's
[1:17:31] another step it's a great wonderful step
[1:17:33] but are you done
[1:17:35] there are you finished are you
[1:17:38] sealed no that's why brother B said many
[1:17:41] people can live under justification
[1:17:43] sanctification and go to hell yeah let
[1:17:46] me give you something further he said
[1:17:47] you can have the Holy Ghost your whole
[1:17:49] life and go to hell he isn't referring
[1:17:52] to the translation of the of the
[1:17:54] transformation of of the Soul he's
[1:17:56] speaking of The Next Step the
[1:17:57] Pentecostal Holy Spirit was not the new
[1:18:01] birth it was the moving of the Holy
[1:18:03] Spirit on the flesh through manifested
[1:18:07] signs wonders
[1:18:09] gifts you could have that and go to hell
[1:18:12] but you can't have Zoe eternal life God
[1:18:15] went to hell already meaning that I'll
[1:18:17] never have to go to hell listen friends
[1:18:19] I'm not afraid of hell because Jesus
[1:18:20] already conquered it and I'll never have
[1:18:22] to go because I'm in Jesus and when he
[1:18:25] died I died when he Rose when he was
[1:18:27] buried brother and sisters I was buried
[1:18:29] and when he rose I rose with
[1:18:34] him and so you've got to go through
[1:18:37] sanctification and then you've got to go
[1:18:39] through the Lord moving on you on you to
[1:18:41] give you that Holy Ghost but then
[1:18:43] brother random uses a term in the
[1:18:45] scripture it's very biblical and I'm
[1:18:46] going to get to it here in a moment over
[1:18:47] and over and over again you shall be
[1:18:50] baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:18:54] yeah amen now it's amazing because this
[1:18:56] is one of the things that we get back
[1:18:57] from Holy Spirit we don't say holy ghost
[1:18:59] we say holy ghost and we don't say and
[1:19:01] fire but if you want to be biblical go
[1:19:04] back to what the word said the word the
[1:19:07] that he shall baptize you behold his fan
[1:19:09] is in his hand and he cometh quickly
[1:19:11] John said and he shall baptize you with
[1:19:14] the Holy Ghost and Fire Hallelujah that
[1:19:18] word used throughout all of the Old
[1:19:20] Testament and the New Testament our God
[1:19:22] is a consuming fire the Pillar of Fire
[1:19:26] was a pillar of
[1:19:27] fire and it led the children of Israel
[1:19:30] by day A Cloud by Night Pillar of Fire
[1:19:32] by Night A Cloud by day and so you've
[1:19:35] got to move but is God done there no
[1:19:38] brother vam says then we move from the
[1:19:40] Holy Ghost meaning on your flesh to the
[1:19:43] Holy Ghost himself amen and that is the
[1:19:47] very nature the
[1:19:49] token that is the
[1:19:51] token you don't have the token at any
[1:19:54] other stage outside of that one when the
[1:19:57] life of your sacrifice leaves your
[1:19:59] sacrifice and comes back on your
[1:20:02] nature a baby is not
[1:20:04] born until they come through all the
[1:20:07] stages that constitutes a birth can you
[1:20:11] say amen amen I go back to it again many
[1:20:15] times this is what we have as birth
[1:20:18] complications and birth complications
[1:20:21] lead to
[1:20:23] longterm life
[1:20:25] problems yes amen
[1:20:30] amen because of a complication in birth
[1:20:34] because something was missed because
[1:20:36] something was bypassed you say brother
[1:20:39] Matt brother brandom didn't preach that
[1:20:41] you're going back to the pre- seals oh
[1:20:43] no friends leadership 1965 the one of
[1:20:46] the last sermon second to last tape
[1:20:48] sermons brother Bram ever preaches you
[1:20:50] go back to leadership and brother Bram
[1:20:51] talks about justification sanctification
[1:20:54] being born again baptized with the Holy
[1:20:56] Ghost this is not a principle that he
[1:20:59] came up with himself this is right out
[1:21:01] of your Bible yes amen amen we don't
[1:21:05] have time to to to Really unpack that so
[1:21:08] I just trust the Lord reveals it to you
[1:21:10] supernaturally because I don't really
[1:21:11] have time to to to go too deep into it
[1:21:14] today and in case you're wondering I got
[1:21:17] my timer
[1:21:21] going amen then we asked the question
[1:21:25] well then what is the brother Matt
[1:21:27] you're preaching on the autopsy of a
[1:21:28] dead Revival that's right we'll get to
[1:21:31] it then we say what is brother Matt
[1:21:35] here's another question then what is the
[1:21:38] evidence that I have been born again do
[1:21:42] I need to feel
[1:21:43] something will I feel something will I
[1:21:46] speak in tongues will I shout will I
[1:21:52] cry does the fruits of the spirit
[1:21:55] matter will I have them does the gifts
[1:21:59] of the
[1:22:00] Spirit matter will I have them all of
[1:22:04] these are good questions
[1:22:09] amen listen to what brother bam says
[1:22:11] here and I'm just going to read our
[1:22:12] first slide Now history keeps repeating
[1:22:16] itself in the generation of Israel we
[1:22:18] see Revival in one generation only to
[1:22:20] see the fires fading in the next and in
[1:22:22] the third Embers may be glowing slight L
[1:22:24] but in the fourth there may be no
[1:22:26] vestage whatsoever of that original
[1:22:29] flame right and so what does God do God
[1:22:32] just kicks it out says oh well abort it
[1:22:34] Mission abort we failed
[1:22:37] sorry
[1:22:38] no God lights the fire again and the
[1:22:42] same process is repeated now I'm talking
[1:22:46] to you about ages this was the cycle of
[1:22:49] the ages this was the cycle of the
[1:22:51] judges while the judge lived they served
[1:22:54] God but when the judge died they
[1:22:56] suddenly fell away it's so incredible we
[1:22:58] were in New Zealand me and my wife
[1:22:59] brother Travis sister Deborah there for
[1:23:01] uh for uh a few couple weeks and as we
[1:23:04] went down to the Milford Sound I seen
[1:23:06] something so powerful as we were on a
[1:23:08] 4-Hour bus ride down to the Milford
[1:23:10] Sound and just a beautiful gorgeous uh I
[1:23:13] had to say on all of my videos as I was
[1:23:15] I felt this is naturally came as I'm
[1:23:17] videotaping this I I say to the onlooker
[1:23:20] uh though you may think I've passed away
[1:23:22] and this is heaven it's actually not
[1:23:25] I'm still here that's about how
[1:23:27] beautiful it was but as I I watch and
[1:23:29] you see these mountains with just these
[1:23:32] massive trees and all my goodness and
[1:23:34] the the the driver of the bus he was
[1:23:35] just a wonderful tour guide and he was
[1:23:38] just pointing out everything about the
[1:23:40] rivers and the creeks and the water and
[1:23:42] you know the volcanic that it's there on
[1:23:43] the rings of fire and all of these great
[1:23:46] mountains that were there get out and
[1:23:47] take pictures of it and you just see
[1:23:49] these great just monstrosity of
[1:23:51] mountains and and just these these trees
[1:23:53] and he said is it isn't it so amazing
[1:23:55] that these look at these pine trees I
[1:23:57] mean some Pines that were just shooting
[1:23:58] up 50 60 feet some of them you know even
[1:24:01] taller than that and right on the sheer
[1:24:03] Mountain face there'd be just trees
[1:24:04] going all the way up with an angle just
[1:24:06] a steep angle and it says isn't amazing
[1:24:09] uh he says isn't it so amazing just
[1:24:10] looking at those trees he said notice
[1:24:12] look there's no soil the trees aren't
[1:24:14] planted in any kind of soil notice where
[1:24:16] they're rooted to they're actually
[1:24:17] rooted to the
[1:24:20] Rock I wanted to say preach
[1:24:25] and he says notice their their root is
[1:24:27] in the Rock it's actually rooted to the
[1:24:29] Rock the foundation and he says that's
[1:24:32] what's holding the tree from falling is
[1:24:36] that they're planted rooted in the Rock
[1:24:38] and we came down through a certain uh
[1:24:40] spot of the mountain he said now I want
[1:24:42] you to notice in the middle of that
[1:24:44] mountain you have all these trees but in
[1:24:46] the middle and he said this is what we
[1:24:47] call a mountain Scar and you could see
[1:24:50] down the middle it almost looked like
[1:24:51] what you'd cut a power line through but
[1:24:53] they hadn't it was natural and it was
[1:24:55] just a bare spot that went all the way
[1:24:57] down to the bottom and it was missing
[1:24:59] trees and he said this is this very
[1:25:02] tragic thing that happens sometimes it's
[1:25:05] called a tree
[1:25:08] Avalanche and he says what happens is he
[1:25:11] said actually the trees that you're
[1:25:13] looking at when you look at all of the
[1:25:15] trees and he said you're actually
[1:25:17] looking at a lot of trees then he says
[1:25:20] but not all of the trees you are seeing
[1:25:22] are actually planted in the
[1:25:25] rocket and he says but there's actually
[1:25:28] only a few what we call Anchor trees and
[1:25:32] he says these anchor trees are the trees
[1:25:34] that are planted to the Rock and their
[1:25:36] roots are grabbed on to the to the
[1:25:38] granite and he says but all the rest of
[1:25:40] the Field trees that you see that look
[1:25:42] like the mountain they're actually
[1:25:44] holding on to the Anchor trees
[1:25:47] yes in other words their experience is
[1:25:51] not tied to the Rock their experience
[1:25:54] has now only been tied to the preacher
[1:25:57] the pastor the grandmother the
[1:26:00] papa they were raised in the message Mom
[1:26:02] and Dad they're holding on they're
[1:26:04] grasping now they're still standing they
[1:26:06] look beautiful they have tree they have
[1:26:08] all of the same look they have the
[1:26:10] needles of the pine they have everything
[1:26:11] all the life but the life that they're
[1:26:13] living is off of the anchor
[1:26:16] tree I'm afraid friends that's the
[1:26:19] problem it's a good thing it's all right
[1:26:20] for you to be anchored to Mom or
[1:26:22] anchored to Dad or an to a testimony but
[1:26:25] you've got to take your roots and put
[1:26:28] them down in the Rock of
[1:26:31] Ages they were held on he said they're
[1:26:33] actually interwoven into the life of
[1:26:36] that anchor tree and he says but the
[1:26:38] risk of that is that when one of those
[1:26:41] anchor trees
[1:26:44] fall and he says and it loses root it
[1:26:47] doesn't just fall itself it's an
[1:26:50] avalanche and it pulls all of those
[1:26:52] trees down with it amen
[1:26:55] amen it's what we've seen happen in our
[1:26:57] own
[1:26:58] ranks what we looked at as anchor trees
[1:27:00] who have fallen and many people because
[1:27:02] they were only ever attached to a
[1:27:04] denominational name or christon name or
[1:27:07] a Christian and name
[1:27:09] only and when that anchor tree fell down
[1:27:12] they had no root within themselves and
[1:27:14] they came tumbling down the mountain and
[1:27:17] it left a
[1:27:18] scar down the side of the
[1:27:21] mountain brother Adam says this is what
[1:27:23] happened happens through those judges
[1:27:25] Cycles judges a judge would live he
[1:27:27] would die then the children of Israel go
[1:27:29] back into Caleb brother Caleb uh taught
[1:27:32] on it today it's amazing if you ever
[1:27:34] look at what he was teaching on the end
[1:27:36] of Judges it's just a terrible sad story
[1:27:40] horrible and and The Tribe of Benjamin
[1:27:42] is almost completely wiped out amen
[1:27:46] manasse is gone just a Carnage of of of
[1:27:51] the of you say brother Matt what is it
[1:27:53] the result of result of having an
[1:27:55] experience that was only tied to a
[1:27:59] judge and never anchored within
[1:28:02] themselves and then that cycle repeats
[1:28:04] and then God would light the fire again
[1:28:07] and that same process did you know is
[1:28:09] repeated seven times in the Book of
[1:28:11] Judges notice what the prophet says here
[1:28:14] he says the same process is repeated the
[1:28:16] fervent you say brother Matt you're
[1:28:17] preaching on the autopsy of a dead
[1:28:19] Revival all right let me get to my
[1:28:21] sermon here somebody say preach brother
[1:28:23] Matt
[1:28:24] so notice here this is the this is the
[1:28:27] autopsy you say what are the signs of a
[1:28:30] Revival that is dying how do I know that
[1:28:33] my Revival is at risk as we preach to
[1:28:37] you on the spirit of Revival and that
[1:28:39] word Revival just means to save one
[1:28:43] who's at risk of becoming a
[1:28:47] corpse what's missing what do we look
[1:28:50] for what are some of the outward
[1:28:52] evidence
[1:28:54] that that Revival's dying the fervent
[1:28:57] somebody say that word fervent f f say
[1:29:00] it
[1:29:04] fervently the
[1:29:06] fervent something different when you say
[1:29:08] it that
[1:29:09] way the fervent yeah desire I love that
[1:29:16] to please
[1:29:18] God the passion the passion to know his
[1:29:24] word yes amen the cry listen friends if
[1:29:28] the only sermon you get is the sermon on
[1:29:30] Sunday if the I just want to say if the
[1:29:32] only diet on the message of the hour is
[1:29:35] when I'm displaying quotes you have lost
[1:29:37] your fervent desire come on let's be
[1:29:40] honest we have lost the passion to know
[1:29:43] his word if the only time we ever lay
[1:29:46] before him is when we come to church on
[1:29:49] Wednesday or we we don't even make it
[1:29:51] sometimes then or on Sunday come on
[1:29:54] amen the cry for reaching out in the
[1:29:59] spirit amen oh
[1:30:02] begins oh so you mean that the cry for
[1:30:05] reaching out in the spirit is not
[1:30:06] replaced now that we've come to the age
[1:30:08] of maturity brother M you know now that
[1:30:10] church ages are over that's what I've
[1:30:11] heard said and now you know it's the
[1:30:13] word and the word only and that was that
[1:30:15] that Holy Spirit was you know the Holy
[1:30:17] Ghost dispensation is over we've moved
[1:30:19] beyond the that's what they're preaching
[1:30:20] some people are preaching now it's sad
[1:30:23] it's so sad to say some of my brothers
[1:30:25] that that now we've moved into the
[1:30:27] Capstone and I believe all of that
[1:30:28] headstone I believe I preached on that
[1:30:30] Wednesday we've moved into the age of
[1:30:31] maturity We Don't Preach Calvary anymore
[1:30:34] we don't we don't preach Calvary anymore
[1:30:36] on We Don't Preach the book of Acts
[1:30:38] anymore we don't preach the book of
[1:30:39] listen brother M that this message
[1:30:41] didn't come to you know didn't come just
[1:30:43] to take us back to Pentecost it come to
[1:30:45] take us back to Eden Christ is the
[1:30:46] mystery of God revealed what do he say a
[1:30:48] restored Eden you say brother Matt do
[1:30:50] you believe that with all of my heart
[1:30:52] but can I just say you will never never
[1:30:54] get to Eden unless you come to Pentecost
[1:30:58] and you will never come to Pentecost if
[1:31:00] you don't come to Mount Calvary it's got
[1:31:02] to start at the right place and it will
[1:31:05] finish in the right
[1:31:07] destination this message comes to take
[1:31:10] us back to Eden I believe that but it
[1:31:12] came to what's going to take us to Eden
[1:31:14] brother a true fireborn experience with
[1:31:17] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that
[1:31:20] burns in our very Soul amen we've got a
[1:31:25] fervency a passion to know his
[1:31:29] word and one doesn't do away with the
[1:31:34] next that's brother bam never taught
[1:31:37] that right even in the account down he
[1:31:40] doesn't say that the jet aircraft did
[1:31:42] away with the
[1:31:43] automobile the astronaut didn't do away
[1:31:46] with the jet aircraft he said this way
[1:31:49] one compliments the
[1:31:52] next you say brother M you believe we're
[1:31:54] living in the age of the astronaut
[1:31:55] brother I believe we're living further
[1:31:57] than the age of the astronaut the
[1:31:59] prophet said beyond the astronaut is the
[1:32:01] intelligence they got artificial
[1:32:03] intelligence today but we've got the
[1:32:05] mind of Christ to know what he wants
[1:32:08] done with his word it's the Capstone The
[1:32:13] Headstone amen but you will never get
[1:32:16] the headstone if you don't come through
[1:32:17] the First
[1:32:21] Foundation hello can you say Amen am he
[1:32:25] says that notice what's happened the
[1:32:27] fervent desire to please God the passion
[1:32:30] to know his word the cry for reaching
[1:32:32] out in the spirit all begins to fade so
[1:32:36] in other words these things aren't to
[1:32:38] fade as The Headstone nears the body did
[1:32:40] I give you can I give you the words of a
[1:32:42] Vindicated Prophet as The Headstone
[1:32:44] praise God we got the headstone let me
[1:32:46] let me preach what a prophet taught as
[1:32:48] The Headstone nears the body those in
[1:32:51] the body will be so much like Jesus they
[1:32:54] will be in his very image power of his
[1:32:56] power life of his life nature of his
[1:32:59] nature he says the full works of
[1:33:02] Jesus will be done in her
[1:33:07] life the full power that's his word the
[1:33:10] full power of the Holy
[1:33:13] Ghost I want it
[1:33:17] yes the Dynamics of this church will be
[1:33:20] a intellectual move intellectual sermons
[1:33:24] intellectual teaching listen friends I'm
[1:33:27] not preaching against anything but our
[1:33:28] services and our sermons got to be more
[1:33:31] than just a dry intellectual ABC and one
[1:33:34] plus one I'm all for Sunday school I'm
[1:33:37] all for teaching I believe in with all
[1:33:39] of my heart I believe we need more of it
[1:33:41] God sent teachers but he also sent
[1:33:43] Apostles he also sent prophets he also
[1:33:45] sent evangelists and to Maj your own one
[1:33:48] and minor on where God did minor is to
[1:33:51] re reject the truth of the Bible you say
[1:33:53] brother Matt what do we need we need
[1:33:55] them all we need all of the gifts of the
[1:33:57] Spirit all of the fruits of the spirit
[1:34:00] all of the Ephesians for Ministry oh do
[1:34:02] we have a church that says God give me
[1:34:05] everything that's your word meant to
[1:34:07] restore back to this end time
[1:34:10] church it's got to be more because
[1:34:13] brother bam said that he says it's got
[1:34:14] to be more than just teaching that's
[1:34:16] wonderful can I just say this if you can
[1:34:19] preach that and say Amen then you can
[1:34:20] say Amen to this it's got to be more
[1:34:22] than shouting it's got to be more than
[1:34:25] dancing it's got to be more than loud
[1:34:27] music I'm a fair friend I'm a fan of it
[1:34:30] but it's got to be something when
[1:34:31] brother bandam says when you're going
[1:34:32] down the the road in the car and you
[1:34:35] ain't got the music to whoop you up
[1:34:36] you'll still be shouting when you're at
[1:34:38] the workplace and nobody's around
[1:34:40] there's a bubbling desire to please God
[1:34:43] inside of your heart oh a real Revival
[1:34:45] ain't based on music it ain't based on
[1:34:47] emotion it's based on the word brother
[1:34:50] and it will bring emotion it'll bring
[1:34:52] music but we've got to have the word
[1:34:55] based
[1:34:56] Revival amen hallelujah hallelujah thank
[1:35:00] you
[1:35:01] Jesus he says notice it's cooled off and
[1:35:04] became a bit formal that's what was
[1:35:07] happening back there to the Ephesians
[1:35:09] the second generation coming on was just
[1:35:11] like Israel they demanded the king to be
[1:35:12] like other nations when they did that
[1:35:14] they rejected God that and read it is
[1:35:16] the history of the church it isn't long
[1:35:19] until you see them the autopsy of a dead
[1:35:21] Revival it isn't long until you see them
[1:35:24] stop doing things they used to
[1:35:30] do can I give you the words of brother
[1:35:33] brandham brother Luther I'm glad I can
[1:35:35] can I give the rest of you the words of
[1:35:36] brother
[1:35:38] brandham God they all night prayer
[1:35:42] meetings yeah the altar calls this is
[1:35:46] what he said
[1:35:48] yeah stay at home on Wednesday night to
[1:35:50] watch an episode of television
[1:35:54] and he says all of those
[1:35:56] things begin to
[1:35:59] fade and instead of the
[1:36:03] church all of those things start do
[1:36:05] things they wouldn't do initially they
[1:36:06] changed their manner of dress isn't that
[1:36:09] amazing the way that they dress is a
[1:36:10] sign that the Revival's dead
[1:36:15] amen their attitudes is a sign that the
[1:36:19] Revival's
[1:36:20] dead you say attitude towards what
[1:36:23] towards his
[1:36:28] word their behavior is a sign they get
[1:36:33] laxed that's what Ephesus means relaxed
[1:36:36] drifting that cycle of Revival and death
[1:36:40] has never
[1:36:43] failed can you say Amen to his
[1:36:48] word let me find my place here where I'm
[1:36:51] at that cycle of Revival and death has
[1:36:55] never failed so listen what brother bam
[1:36:57] says he says every we finded Esau and
[1:36:59] Jacob before either child was born God
[1:37:00] so loved one and hated the other and
[1:37:02] remember they were twins same mother
[1:37:06] same father get it twins every Revival
[1:37:12] produces somebody say it with me twins
[1:37:16] amen every Revival produces twins
[1:37:19] certainly does there's twins born in a
[1:37:21] natural man and the spiritual man it was
[1:37:24] back in the Garden of Eden Cain and Abel
[1:37:25] the same thing started off from there
[1:37:27] just keeps coming on he goes to Jesus
[1:37:30] and Judas amen you could you could think
[1:37:33] of all of these examples it always
[1:37:35] produces twins he points to all the way
[1:37:39] back to Jacob and Esau he's looking at
[1:37:40] it together in New Zealand there and
[1:37:42] brother Travis had asked me what ever
[1:37:44] happened to Esau you hear the story
[1:37:46] about Jacob and Esau whatever happened
[1:37:48] we know what happens with Jacob he gets
[1:37:50] a name change Prince he's called you
[1:37:52] know with God he goes there and and and
[1:37:54] and and you know and you know the entire
[1:37:56] Story halts upon his thigh whatever
[1:37:59] happens to to Esau it's it's amazing
[1:38:01] when you look at this because brother
[1:38:02] Adam points to this to the twins of the
[1:38:04] Revival that would be twins brothers but
[1:38:07] one had respect unto the birthright and
[1:38:10] one really didn't care about it too much
[1:38:12] amen now what's amazing is that brother
[1:38:15] bham talks about Esau and his nature and
[1:38:17] Jacob and his nature and Esau was
[1:38:19] actually a very good man good by the
[1:38:22] sense of good of the word he was nice he
[1:38:24] was kind he you know but Jacob man he
[1:38:26] was just a low down rotten stinking
[1:38:28] Rascal but notice who God put the
[1:38:31] promise in not Esau but Jacob as I've
[1:38:34] said this here before Jacob Esau was a
[1:38:37] good man but Jacob was a God man and
[1:38:40] there's a very big difference between
[1:38:41] you might be good but there's only one
[1:38:43] that's good and that is God and so God
[1:38:46] looked at the seed or the potential
[1:38:49] inside of Jacob not his outward shell as
[1:38:52] he says you men look at the heart heart
[1:38:53] but God look God a man looks at the
[1:38:55] outward appearance but God looks at the
[1:38:57] heart aren't you glad for that he
[1:38:59] doesn't look at your outward appearance
[1:39:00] he's not looking at your track record
[1:39:02] he's looking at his word his seed his
[1:39:06] promise and so notice here because Jacob
[1:39:09] goes One Way Esau we know establishes
[1:39:13] the kingdom of Edom yeah you go and read
[1:39:17] the book of
[1:39:18] um
[1:39:20] Obadiah and Obadiah brings a prophecy
[1:39:24] against Edom you go look look in the
[1:39:27] Book of Malachi how many ever read that
[1:39:29] before and God says Jacob have I loved
[1:39:31] Esau have I hated I made his dens and
[1:39:34] his waste I've made his habitation A
[1:39:36] Wasteland amen and it's actually the
[1:39:39] prophecy of Obadiah of that twin of that
[1:39:42] Revival that Esau goes into the neev and
[1:39:46] he and he and his people become you know
[1:39:49] uh uh tent dwellers they be they they
[1:39:51] they go from uh place to place
[1:39:54] and they they tell so Obadiah tells this
[1:39:57] originally we have this original pattern
[1:39:58] of Revival producing Twins and he tells
[1:40:01] of these two Nations Esau I'm sorry
[1:40:05] Israel and Edom the nation of
[1:40:08] Edom and so you notice all the way back
[1:40:11] in the word when Israel under Moses is
[1:40:14] going through the promised land you
[1:40:15] remember that in the scripture that it
[1:40:17] was Edom who withstood them yeah amen
[1:40:21] right yes these were Esau 's descendants
[1:40:24] and made their their Journey very
[1:40:26] difficult it was Esau when they they
[1:40:28] traveled the Israel the Bible says
[1:40:29] traveled through the land of Edom and
[1:40:31] the gave them a lot of trouble
[1:40:33] and they were enemies enemies with
[1:40:35] Israel from the very beginning it's
[1:40:38] amazing because God almost took Jacob
[1:40:40] and Esau Esau as two Nations and he
[1:40:43] almost took it's like the Bible produces
[1:40:46] a shadow of these two men and the
[1:40:49] Nations that go behind them and it's
[1:40:51] like an overarching principle found all
[1:40:54] the way through the Bible the Apostle
[1:40:56] Paul picks it up and says speaking about
[1:40:59] election and says Jacob have I loved and
[1:41:02] Esau have I hated and then Paul takes it
[1:41:05] further and says and he made that choice
[1:41:09] before either was born or either had
[1:41:13] done good or evil is that what her Bible
[1:41:16] says yeah amen and so and he says this
[1:41:20] these words that
[1:41:21] election that he election yes for
[1:41:26] knowledge might stand yes prise God and
[1:41:29] so so God shows this here and you say
[1:41:32] whatever happened we me brother Travis
[1:41:34] talking about it to the well in
[1:41:35] the sixth Century you go and look up
[1:41:38] historically and the Arabs actually came
[1:41:40] in and overtook this entire land of Edom
[1:41:42] expelled them completely out of their
[1:41:44] Kingdom just as Obadiah had prophesied
[1:41:47] the exact same way that Obadiah
[1:41:48] prophesized that exact actually exactly
[1:41:50] how it came through how how it came to
[1:41:52] pass and so the Arabs attack them they
[1:41:54] flee to the mountains and they go into
[1:41:57] what if you look on a map there the rift
[1:41:58] valley and then they go from the rift
[1:42:00] valley down into the netive and then
[1:42:02] they they they live there in the desert
[1:42:04] you think they're gone think they're
[1:42:05] just done away with annihilated but
[1:42:07] actually they were still alive and so
[1:42:10] the neev in your Bible is
[1:42:14] renamed and it's actually
[1:42:17] renamed as an if from the Edomite word
[1:42:21] edia if you ever look up edia that's the
[1:42:25] and they lived in this place
[1:42:28] called
[1:42:29] edia and they lost their cities and now
[1:42:32] they live in the desert say well what
[1:42:34] happened then this is incredible then
[1:42:37] later go a little bit further came a day
[1:42:40] when one of those from the
[1:42:43] Negev leaves edia travels to Jerusalem
[1:42:48] and makes a deal actually with Julius
[1:42:51] Caesar
[1:42:53] and says give me an Edomite the Throne
[1:42:57] of Jerusalem he was a client King a
[1:43:01] hirling he wasn't a Jew he was an
[1:43:04] Edomite and he makes a deal with Julius
[1:43:07] Caesar and says would you sell me the
[1:43:10] throne in Israel in Jerusalem and you
[1:43:13] know what that Roman Emperor did he gave
[1:43:15] it to him yeah you say what was his name
[1:43:17] brother Matt
[1:43:19] Herod Herod the Edomite
[1:43:24] amen now you see what it means when
[1:43:26] brother Ram says every Revival Here
[1:43:28] Comes Jesus every Revival produces twins
[1:43:32] yeah Church natural Church
[1:43:36] spiritual and so that Herod the Edomite
[1:43:39] you could imagine now he's on the throne
[1:43:42] and when the wise men come and they say
[1:43:44] where is he born King King Herod said
[1:43:50] King of the Jews and so he kills every
[1:43:52] every boy in in in in the in the in that
[1:43:55] City why because he wasn't going to let
[1:43:57] some Jew take the throne he had already
[1:43:59] taken the throne and so you say brother
[1:44:02] Matt where does it stop it doesn't stop
[1:44:03] there herod's son this is amazing
[1:44:07] herod's son was the man who killed John
[1:44:09] the
[1:44:10] Baptist amen you remember the words of a
[1:44:14] Vindicated Prophet when he said the
[1:44:17] carnal false church will always
[1:44:20] persecute the true church amen but bride
[1:44:25] cannot persecute
[1:44:28] bride so who are we showing our lineages
[1:44:32] from when we persecute
[1:44:38] bride I'm not talking about disagreeing
[1:44:40] that's one thing we can
[1:44:42] disagree but
[1:44:44] bride can't persecute Bride Can you say
[1:44:47] Amen his son killed John the
[1:44:50] Baptist his grandson was Herod the one
[1:44:53] that was ate by worms in the book of
[1:44:55] Acts his great grandson was a man named
[1:44:59] Agrippa who died in 100 AD without
[1:45:03] children without a lineage and the
[1:45:07] Disappeared why prophecy yes amen of
[1:45:11] Obadiah amen but I want to tell you that
[1:45:14] Spirit of twins continued
[1:45:17] on right we're going to we're out of
[1:45:19] time I'm three minutes in overtime
[1:45:23] sudden
[1:45:25] death soon as we score a touchdown we'll
[1:45:27] go
[1:45:30] home so you're going to be pulling now
[1:45:34] right I'm out of time I can't get to it
[1:45:36] and that's all right so every Revival
[1:45:39] produces twins
[1:45:42] amen I'm going to go through these two
[1:45:44] that I read
[1:45:45] already uh let me see if I want to get
[1:45:48] to this listen what brother bam talks
[1:45:50] about I just want to close here this is
[1:45:51] where I'll close thank you Lord
[1:45:53] let's imagine it's Monday that's the
[1:45:56] woman's worst
[1:46:01] day I'll let that sit here for a
[1:46:04] moment let's imagine it's Monday as
[1:46:07] brother bam talks about Abraham Sarah
[1:46:10] was in a temper you know had a real mood
[1:46:12] that day and it was Monday says it's a
[1:46:15] real you know woman's words day usually
[1:46:16] was listen it was when I was home I had
[1:46:19] to pack the wash water and everything
[1:46:21] and he says and I used to how I he says
[1:46:23] and and how I used to have to go cut
[1:46:25] them old Locust Limbs and Pull It in and
[1:46:28] stick it under the fire and bull the
[1:46:30] wash water and an old big old kettle on
[1:46:32] the outside my my he says remember she
[1:46:35] used to cook preserves I love this and I
[1:46:38] used to get in there I'd sweat you know
[1:46:40] in the summertime those little yellow
[1:46:42] gourd Tomatoes boy they're pretty good
[1:46:44] you know make preserves out of it put
[1:46:47] them home he says put them between hot
[1:46:49] biscuits on a cold morning I tell you
[1:46:51] they're fine and she'd poured in and I'd
[1:46:53] say ah Mama that Fire's hot enough she
[1:46:56] said oh they're not hot enough yet and
[1:46:59] Sh and they was just cooking and
[1:47:01] steaming I said why why they're they're
[1:47:04] not hot enough she said they have to go
[1:47:06] to popping before they're right popping
[1:47:09] said just keep pouring the wood till
[1:47:12] they go to popping bubbling you know the
[1:47:14] air coming up I think this is about how
[1:47:16] church should be you say well isn't it
[1:47:19] hot enough brother Matt we're saying
[1:47:20] amen no brother it ain't hot enough keep
[1:47:23] pouring the gospel on that fire keep
[1:47:25] pouring down those amens and that praise
[1:47:28] it'll start popping after a
[1:47:30] while I thought that was a pretty good
[1:47:32] illustration reminds me of a good old
[1:47:34] Holy Ghost meat and you're digging up
[1:47:35] some wood just keep throwing the fire
[1:47:37] till they start popping that's right get
[1:47:39] ready for sealing I love that get ready
[1:47:42] for sealing away then before you can get
[1:47:45] the iron hot he says get it ready to
[1:47:47] make something out of you have to get it
[1:47:49] hot put it under the Anvil beat the
[1:47:52] Sparks out of it it and let her go to
[1:47:53] molding out I love he says that in
[1:47:55] another message I remember Mom would get
[1:47:57] a great big kettle of them on cook them
[1:47:58] up i cho wood and put under there I'd
[1:48:01] say now mama he says the the them things
[1:48:03] are hot she said honey they got to get
[1:48:06] hotter I'd say why do they have to get
[1:48:08] any hotter she'd say they have to get so
[1:48:10] hot until they go to pop and go pop pop
[1:48:13] pop pop like that said then they're
[1:48:16] getting sweet praise God yeah amen amen
[1:48:21] notice not angry not b not jealous when
[1:48:25] the true move of the Holy Ghost is
[1:48:26] brother B says that's what I have
[1:48:28] against the Assemblies of God they shout
[1:48:30] they jump they dance they scream they
[1:48:32] got all of the manifestations but they
[1:48:34] got enough temper to fight a buzz saw
[1:48:36] listen when the Holy Ghost really comes
[1:48:38] in your heart you will shout you will
[1:48:40] jump you will pop but they'll produce
[1:48:42] such a sweetness out of you he says
[1:48:45] they'll get sweet after a while mixes
[1:48:47] all the juices everything that runs all
[1:48:49] the sugar with the juices and that runs
[1:48:53] them notice ready for what ready for
[1:48:55] them to be canned I thought that's about
[1:48:57] right with an oldtime Holy Ghost meeting
[1:48:59] just keep throwing the old gospel wood
[1:49:01] on there brother let her get hot enough
[1:49:03] till you have a testimony meeting pop
[1:49:05] poof pop poof pop like that runs all the
[1:49:09] devil out and gets the Holy Ghost
[1:49:11] munching around with the people like
[1:49:13] that sweetened up then you'd have an
[1:49:15] old-fashioned Revival just keep laying
[1:49:18] the wood on it blowing it just as hard
[1:49:20] as you can Fanning it God will take care
[1:49:22] of the rest of it it'll sweeten up the
[1:49:25] preserves and you can can them down now
[1:49:28] oh I wonder if this church wants that
[1:49:30] kind of Revival meeting in 2025 where we
[1:49:33] keep pouring the wood on it you say
[1:49:35] brother matter are we to get colder no
[1:49:37] brother we're to get hotter for the Holy
[1:49:39] Ghost burn Holy Ghost burn in
[1:49:43] me this ain't a revival can I just
[1:49:45] preach here for a moment this revival
[1:49:47] ain't about getting smarter even getting
[1:49:49] better getting our life you know so
[1:49:51] lined up with everything I believe in
[1:49:53] all of that but this message has got to
[1:49:55] be about a quickening power that makes
[1:49:58] us into the image of the word that
[1:50:00] changes our nature we've got enough love
[1:50:02] in our heart to love our enemy to love
[1:50:05] our brother we've got enough joy of the
[1:50:07] spirit that we don't mind saying Amen
[1:50:09] brother preach the word of God we've got
[1:50:12] the nature the character the gifts the
[1:50:15] life that's a true
[1:50:19] Revival it's a mixture of both
[1:50:23] is it one no it's one and the next it's
[1:50:26] be repent be baptized in the name of
[1:50:29] Jesus Christ believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:50:32] Christ and thou and thou house shalt be
[1:50:34] saved it's all of it brother it's not
[1:50:36] just one part of it brother R says a
[1:50:39] true Revival will always point you to
[1:50:41] not one part of the word but all of the
[1:50:44] word amen you believe in the Beatitudes
[1:50:48] I do you believe it's important to be
[1:50:50] meek gentle kind lonely
[1:50:53] amen you believe it's important to shout
[1:50:55] I do speak in tongues I do gifts of
[1:50:59] healing I do good Lord I want them more
[1:51:02] than ever before Lord I want gifts of
[1:51:04] healing
[1:51:07] amen but notice it's all of them I just
[1:51:10] heard a message Sunday night from a
[1:51:11] brother how that we must confess there
[1:51:13] it is our faults one to another and pray
[1:51:17] one for another that we might be healed
[1:51:22] Hallelujah James 5141 1314 see we must
[1:51:26] confess our faults amen one to
[1:51:33] another before we even come yeah for
[1:51:37] healing
[1:51:39] amen look at Jesus nothing what what but
[1:51:42] one bundle of love he was God manifested
[1:51:46] God expressed through him no wonder
[1:51:50] Miracles and things happened his humble
[1:51:53] life consecrated life to come from being
[1:51:57] God to be a man here on Earth to express
[1:51:59] through himself that's what made him
[1:52:01] what he was I've always said what made
[1:52:02] Jesus to God to me was the way he
[1:52:04] humbled himself he was so great and yet
[1:52:08] could be so small
[1:52:13] amen you you I'm just going to close on
[1:52:17] this you know it's such an it's such an
[1:52:20] amazing thing thank you Lord
[1:52:23] I'm not going to get
[1:52:26] to I'm just going to have to pick a
[1:52:32] spot brother Adam talks so much about
[1:52:35] this and I didn't have time really to
[1:52:36] lay the foundation of this
[1:52:39] but but he talks about the Holy Ghost
[1:52:42] and
[1:52:44] Fire he shall baptize you Matthew
[1:52:46] chapter 3 John the Baptist is word he
[1:52:48] shall baptize with the Holy Ghost in
[1:52:50] fire you know Acts 2 chapter 3 and there
[1:52:52] under them clothing tongues like as a
[1:52:57] fire and it lighted it rested upon
[1:53:01] them and so it's amazing because
[1:53:03] repentance deals with your sin baptism
[1:53:06] deals with your guilt you're washing
[1:53:08] away you're taken away brother bam says
[1:53:09] does baptism save you no it doesn't it
[1:53:12] doesn't save you even though the
[1:53:13] scripture says baptism now does save us
[1:53:15] it's saving us but baptism is an outward
[1:53:18] expression that you've taken your stand
[1:53:20] with Jesus it's important it's a part of
[1:53:23] if you if you've never been baptized in
[1:53:25] the name of the Lord Jesus there goes a
[1:53:26] birth uh birth complication right there
[1:53:30] amen but but that leads you to something
[1:53:33] greater it leads you to that Spirit life
[1:53:36] that life of Holy Ghost and
[1:53:40] Fire that life of TR the true baptism of
[1:53:43] the Holy Ghost with the Holy Ghost and
[1:53:48] Fire can I just have just a minute I'm
[1:53:50] feeling pressured can I just have a
[1:53:51] minute can you give give me
[1:53:54] Grace I going to be praying extra hard
[1:53:56] for my dad to get
[1:54:00] better I love this scripture Leviticus
[1:54:03] chapter 6 turn there if you could just
[1:54:05] before we close brother Mark if you want
[1:54:06] to put it up Leviticus chapter 6 almost
[1:54:08] open with this but I just want to bring
[1:54:10] this thought and and end it Leviticus 6
[1:54:13] chapter chapter 6 verse
[1:54:17] 12 and uh if you get it in time good
[1:54:20] it's it's all right if we don't such a
[1:54:23] powerful scripture Leviticus 6:12
[1:54:26] speaking about the fire and he says and
[1:54:29] the fire upon the altar shall be burning
[1:54:33] in it it shall not be put out and the
[1:54:38] priest shall burn wood on it every
[1:54:40] morning and lay the burnt offering and
[1:54:43] odor upon it and he shall burn thereof
[1:54:45] thereon the fat of the peace offering
[1:54:48] look at verse 13 the fire shall be sh
[1:54:52] the fire shall ever be burning upon the
[1:54:56] altar it shall never go out oh if I
[1:55:01] could just preach here for a moment and
[1:55:03] say Lord if I want a Revival I I want
[1:55:06] that kind of Revival God a fire that
[1:55:09] never goes out a fire that is constantly
[1:55:12] friends I just want to tell this is what
[1:55:14] the Lord inspired upon my heart I
[1:55:15] believe he did it for a reason we need a
[1:55:18] fresh Revival we need a stirring inside
[1:55:21] of our heart we need something something
[1:55:22] to wake us up
[1:55:25] again just talking with my mama I wish
[1:55:28] so bad you to finish that voice message
[1:55:30] but she got so lit up she's sending me
[1:55:32] audio messages telling me about her
[1:55:34] first experience when she came to the
[1:55:36] Lord how the Lord began to deal with her
[1:55:38] even before she came to the message
[1:55:39] about not cutting her hair and wearing
[1:55:41] you know not wearing pants and all of
[1:55:43] these things God began to do she started
[1:55:45] this to testify about some of the early
[1:55:47] original things that happened even in my
[1:55:49] papa's testimony she stopped there you
[1:55:51] know some of the supernatural things and
[1:55:53] I I just want to say friends I don't
[1:55:55] believe that it's that it's the that the
[1:55:58] evid that that there should I don't
[1:55:59] believe that should be lessening I
[1:56:01] believe that should be more and more and
[1:56:04] more as the as The Headstone nears the
[1:56:06] body we should be more on fire brother
[1:56:09] we should be more with passion if we
[1:56:12] ever had passion in our life to serve
[1:56:14] God it should be right
[1:56:17] now amen we ever needed Revival services
[1:56:22] oh they where you know you almost laugh
[1:56:24] at it sometimes I I just say it here
[1:56:26] today almost people almost get you know
[1:56:28] to the point you you you go to sometimes
[1:56:30] you go to church some Churches you know
[1:56:32] and some meetings you go to sometimes
[1:56:34] there's just an you go just for the
[1:56:36] anticipation of what might happen at
[1:56:38] that
[1:56:39] meeting and I've heard that criticized
[1:56:41] can I just say a not something can I
[1:56:43] blow your minds I don't believe that
[1:56:45] should be criticized I believe church
[1:56:47] should be something we go to with an
[1:56:49] anticipation to say I wonder what the
[1:56:51] Lord's going to do tonight I wonder what
[1:56:54] the Lord what would it be if all of us
[1:56:56] came with that
[1:56:58] expectation I wonder what's going to
[1:57:01] take place wonder who's what's going to
[1:57:03] happen come on
[1:57:05] Amen it's not the time to go backwards
[1:57:08] the fire shall be upon the altar it
[1:57:11] shall
[1:57:13] never go out say Lord don't let it ever
[1:57:18] don't let it ever go out Lord amen Lord
[1:57:21] Brother tells that story about the you
[1:57:24] remember that about the glacier yeah how
[1:57:27] many remember that story and and and
[1:57:29] brother bram's talking about it that
[1:57:32] that they uh in yane was it yane I think
[1:57:35] it was and he and he and he talks about
[1:57:38] how that you know that they all came for
[1:57:40] that great big old
[1:57:42] event and they had taken all of the
[1:57:44] trees that had fallen in
[1:57:47] yede and they would go up on the top of
[1:57:49] that mountain and they would the
[1:57:50] bulldozers would come and they just pile
[1:57:53] the you know all of the the the the uh
[1:57:56] the trees and all of the shrubs and all
[1:57:58] of the bushes and you know they'd pile
[1:58:00] it up in a big old pile and and and that
[1:58:03] they had this special event and and and
[1:58:06] it was it was it was where that they lit
[1:58:09] this big old thing on fire you could go
[1:58:10] see it in yosee even brother Brandon's
[1:58:12] time you know and they would gather all
[1:58:15] those trees that had falling and and and
[1:58:17] they would pile them upon this great big
[1:58:19] Stone part of the mountain and all these
[1:58:21] people would go go to the bottom of that
[1:58:23] mountain and and they would they would
[1:58:24] watch this great big massive pieces of
[1:58:27] wood these great big trees that had been
[1:58:29] pwed up and this great bonfire on the
[1:58:31] edge of this cliff and they you know
[1:58:34] they would come you know they would
[1:58:36] light it on fire and it would come
[1:58:38] cascading down and it looked like a
[1:58:41] waterfall how many remember
[1:58:43] this and he says it looked like a
[1:58:45] waterfall and he said it was just
[1:58:47] falling fire that would just fall down
[1:58:50] uh you know it would fall down to the
[1:58:52] bottom of the mountain and it was
[1:58:54] amazing because right before you know
[1:58:57] the the the when they would light it on
[1:58:59] fire you go read this I'm not making
[1:59:00] this up you go read this right out of
[1:59:02] the news I read it for myself this
[1:59:04] morning they'd go back they'd go to yane
[1:59:07] and thousands of people sometimes not
[1:59:08] thousands but hundreds of people down to
[1:59:10] the base of that mountain and it was a
[1:59:12] tradition that they would yell out Let
[1:59:15] the Fire Fall amen right and they would
[1:59:18] yell out Let the Fire Fall remember
[1:59:21] brother bam talks about that and he says
[1:59:23] then they'd push all that fire and it'
[1:59:25] come tumbling down that great big fire
[1:59:27] coming down the
[1:59:29] mountain it's so amazing because there
[1:59:31] was a man just recently who went there
[1:59:34] to yosee and he heard that and he went
[1:59:36] up to a park ranger and he said hey he
[1:59:39] said what time is you know that fire
[1:59:41] lightting event he says Oh you mean he
[1:59:44] says you you mean where we' you know the
[1:59:45] fire that come down the granite and the
[1:59:47] big waterfall of fire and he says yeah
[1:59:49] that one he says oh no the fire don't
[1:59:51] fall anymore come on how was his words
[1:59:54] we don't Let the Fire Fall they don't do
[1:59:56] that
[1:59:56] anymore and I just took that for a
[1:59:58] minute and thought you know something
[2:00:00] natural for safety reasons whatever
[2:00:01] reasons but I thought isn't that about
[2:00:04] like our churches
[2:00:06] now could that be said about us friends
[2:00:10] oh a Time way back before you know when
[2:00:12] the fire fell but we don't Let the Fire
[2:00:15] Fall anymore we don't Let the Fire Fall
[2:00:18] you know one time there was a bright
[2:00:20] burning brilliance passion one time
[2:00:23] there was a you know they there came
[2:00:25] with an expectation and the fire of God
[2:00:27] would rain down upon us oh but you know
[2:00:30] they got to the point to where
[2:00:32] firefighters got so sick of fighting
[2:00:34] fires even in yane to where they become
[2:00:37] real scientific about it and now they
[2:00:39] had devices and cameras that would pick
[2:00:41] it up and they'd put the fire out right
[2:00:43] away as soon as it lit it would fire you
[2:00:45] know what they found though and that
[2:00:46] that those Sherman Pines and some of
[2:00:48] those great big redwoods is that those
[2:00:51] seeds would actually cautify and they
[2:00:53] would become so hardened that they would
[2:00:56] never grow and so they instead of
[2:00:58] letting the Fire Fall because the fire
[2:01:00] would actually burn out the undergrowth
[2:01:03] and it would allow seeds new seeds to
[2:01:05] fall into the ground and to become
[2:01:07] germinated and New Forest oh boy I could
[2:01:10] have preached this my whole sermon New
[2:01:12] Forest would grow up but now they got so
[2:01:15] scientific about it they squelched the
[2:01:18] fire can I give you the words of the
[2:01:20] Bible quench not the the spirit don't
[2:01:23] quench it don't stop it there's a reason
[2:01:25] God sends a Revival fire it's to burn
[2:01:28] out all of the undergrowth so that new
[2:01:31] seed can come forth oh I believe we
[2:01:33] ought to have a church as I close today
[2:01:35] and say Let the Fire Fall God let the
[2:01:38] Revival fire I wonder if somebody would
[2:01:40] stand to their feet and say Let the Fire
[2:01:43] Fall oh God in my life Let the Fire Fall
[2:01:46] in our churches Let the Fire Fall God
[2:01:49] and bring such a Revival it brings
[2:01:52] repentance it brings faith it brings
[2:01:54] baptism it brings a new birth a born
[2:01:57] again trueu fire Born Again experience
[2:02:00] that burns everything that's unlike you
[2:02:03] Lord let it burn let it burn don't try
[2:02:07] to quench it they got to the point to
[2:02:09] where they so quenched the fire and so
[2:02:13] squelched the fire they thought they got
[2:02:15] smart about it that now they have no new
[2:02:17] life
[2:02:22] no new
[2:02:24] life you know I wonder if we could just
[2:02:27] say with our head bowed thank you Lord
[2:02:30] our eyes
[2:02:33] closed Lord I need new
[2:02:38] life New Life thankful for what you did
[2:02:42] in my life but I need new life Lord I
[2:02:48] need I'll be honest if you want I'll be
[2:02:50] honest and raise my hand and say Lord I
[2:02:52] need a fresh
[2:02:54] Revival I need a passion more passion to
[2:02:57] know your word I need a fervent desire
[2:03:00] to please God how many want that friend
[2:03:02] just raise a hand and say Lord I want a
[2:03:04] fervent desire to please you in my life
[2:03:08] I want a passion to know your word I
[2:03:10] want the cry for reaching out in the
[2:03:13] spirit Lord I don't want it to fade I
[2:03:15] want it to go grow brighter I want it to
[2:03:18] grow greater I want to know you more
[2:03:20] Lord in a great G way than I've known
[2:03:23] you you don't stop you've got to start
[2:03:26] at justification but friend you don't
[2:03:27] stop there you got to start at
[2:03:29] repentance but don't stop there you
[2:03:31] don't even stop when you get a real true
[2:03:34] genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost on
[2:03:36] your flesh you press on we've got to
[2:03:39] move Beyond as Paul said not laying
[2:03:41] again the foundation of repentance but
[2:03:43] let us move to
[2:03:45] Perfection I believe that's what God's
[2:03:47] calling this bride to move to maturity
[2:03:50] and perfection
[2:03:52] move up into the higher atmospheres
[2:03:55] don't become so
[2:03:57] Earthbound so Earthbound and as brother
[2:03:59] B him says that eagle was so chained
[2:04:01] down tied
[2:04:03] down but let us set ourselves
[2:04:06] free let oursel let our let our
[2:04:09] experience burn let it burn bright once
[2:04:12] again oh I just raise my hand and say
[2:04:15] that Lord with a sincere heart let my
[2:04:17] experience burn let it become a raging
[2:04:20] Inferno Lord a fire as Leviticus says

[2:04:26] never grows cold oh that Fire's hot
[2:04:30] enough Mama it's not hot enough yet it's
[2:04:32] got to be popping you got to keep
[2:04:34] stoking it keep stoking it keep pouring
[2:04:37] on the wood keep on don't let your
[2:04:39] experience become ashes of what was
[2:04:42] yesterday oh friend if they become just
