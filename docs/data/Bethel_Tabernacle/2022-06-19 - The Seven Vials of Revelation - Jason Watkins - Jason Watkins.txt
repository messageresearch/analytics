the back office i appreciate all of the wonderful talent that god has given to us for singing and playing music and amen preaching ain't half bad praise the lord so hey man we bet it better it better bring something to the plate because i can tell you people are hungry for the word of god amen but i'll just you know burst your bubble now you know nothing in my arms i bring simply to his cross i claim amen i have no way to help you at all uh mike could loan you 50 bucks but other than that you need what way more help than what i could put in your pocket amen got to get something done into that soul and the human can't reach that that takes god amen now how many want god to reach down all the way down get past your flesh past your spirit all the way down and and effect changes down inside your heart that's what i want this morning that's why i'm a believer that's why i love the lord it's why i believe every word of god because i know it has that ability greets you all in the name of the lord today happy to have visitors let's see a number throughout the audience we're glad you're here we got a number of families away visiting so amen lord gave us some visitors to fill up seats we've got a number of families out and some out of town and others different reasons but the lord is here and i'm looking forward to the word i made you a promise that we're going to start to look into something out of the book of revelation concerning the seven vials particularly the seventh vial and that seems like a millennial leap because we're jumping past say well when did we cover ages and seals and trumpets and all of that well just hang on we'll we'll we'll get there amen but i just have a burden on my heart today so i'm going to just uh start it on it today on this seventh vial of the book of revelation it's you're gonna see just shortly how relevant it is to the hour that you live in say well i thought all of that's in the tribulation well you'd be mistaken amen there's elements of it that are uh breaking in our age where we live in and it is actually the rhyme and reason of of all of the madness you see uh in the minds of man total insanity amen is because of these things so we're going to invite you to revelation chapter 16 and i heard all the fathers greeted wanna do the same thing and wish you all a very happy father's day amen i've been getting notices from all points and uh we want to make sure that everybody um is is welcomed here today and to say happy father's day in the building here and all of those out and all of those streaming amen praise the lord brother matt worked some of his magic today we i got up this morning the website was down so all you streamers y'all are about to have nothing so i got a hold of brother matt and he uh did did what he does so well and got it back up and running so as far as i know we're going strong amen um we want to be remembered by the jd got a request for prayer battling a head coat over there and that's no fun when you're trying to preach the gospel and believe me the hours you have to keep and the pull that they put on your body last thing you want to be doing is fighting a head cold probably picked it up on the aircraft somewhere you know that put all those people in one tube and send you 35 000 feet in the air and you're up there for hours so we want to just pray the lord to have mercy on him well you remember brother jason this morning that the lord would help him amen and uh we want to see the word go forth in power when he comes home we want to hear the great testimonies of the great things god has done amen revelation chapter 16 and we just have one uh verse and where we could read quite a few but it's not relevant to today and um i'm hoping actually to get to this verse that we're going to read um verse 17. and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done let's pray father we thank you now for your word this morning and i i stand here lord and i've i'm just so thankful to you for your instructions lord because it just is such a release it's such a an end to all strife knowing that we have the revealed word of this hour we don't have to guess at these things we can go back to what was established by a vindicated messenger lord and we see it dovetail with the scriptures everywhere now that's not in question that's not in question this morning we want to look at it so we can see where we fit into it and what is our position in this great drama this great plan that's been underway and is underway and is wrapping up soon and lord we want to know uh where we fit what is what are our marching orders this this informs our thinking as to how we should live and conduct ourselves it puts an urgency in our heart lord i've had such an urgency in my heart as i've studied it lord so i pray that that can transmit today and the people have some clearer understanding of why preachers preach the things that they do and get down into people's lives and deal with spirits and deal with uh addictions and transgressions and sins and are all the time pointing to these things lord there's a there's a there's a a force behind these things and we want to identify our enemy and your enemy in the word today we want to see the plan father so i pray you open it to us give us relaxed hearts and minds as we look into it now in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated now i promised you a bunch of a bunch of images and diagrams and schematics um wednesday that when we got to it we were going to have that as i began to really try to bring it all together into preachable material i realized today that that's not going to work i may uh very likely will still have some of that going forward in fact i know i will because there's one very important one if i don't have anything else i'll need to show you that one but it won't be today so i'm i'm just going to ask you for your undivided attention you visitors don't worry my home church will tell you i'm not long-winded and i don't even actually believe in it so uh i want you to retain everything that we say so if you give me maybe you know i'll i'll hold my sermon to 35 or 40 minutes but i'm going to need i'm going to need 25 to 30 minutes to build a build a platform so is that okay so once i get start preaching then start timing me and 35 40 minutes i'll wrap it up i promise you i'll pull the pull the chute stand on the brakes and we'll jump out amen so after the after gets stopped brother branham when he comes to um bring us these great mysteries out of the book of revelation we know that the book of revelation is the bride's book of the end time it's for her it's written for this age it was a book of great myst mysterious uh symbolism and things and it come to the church after saint paul was already gone home that's why you don't ever hear paul quoting out of the book of revelation and uh and john brings it back he's the last living apostle he brings it back as an aged veteran the last one standing of the original and the book is given and sent throughout all the churches but its mysteries would remain sealed up and and and hard to decipher and understand until the last day when god would again finish bookending his ages with a prophet he started the alpha age with a prophet which being saint paul and he's going to end it and did end it with an elijah ministry prophet at the omega age and so when brother branham came he started of course with the seven church ages perfectly he started with daniel 70 weeks because he knew he would have to establish jacob's trouble that time of jacob's trouble he would have to establish and get that fixed in people's mind uh because you had all kinds of different ideas about that and so brother branham would establish you know where how that's going to come to israel and how it's going to take a gentile bride home and then there's going to be this much time in the tribulation and and how christ came in the middle of the week and was you know and crucified and then the last half of that 70th week has to be played out in the tribulation period after the bride after the gentile bride has gone from the earth he's going to make himself known to the 144 thousand and that's going to happen now it's interesting and we've said this before how that how that now and just follow me okay because i'm not you know me i'm i'm good at explaining things i'm a good storyteller i get it from sister gene and uh it's important to me that i not leave you blinking so i'm i'm gonna just draw you a mental picture all right so just stay with me and uh and i'll make it real clear to you it's a it's a real thing for me i i has to be made clear or i'll just stop until it is so last thing i want to do is leave you blinking and confused so so brother branham is going to establish you know how that's all working in that 70th week of daniel don't want to get bogged down in that and so we find that at the end of the during the tribulation you find you know that moses and elijah are martyred along with 144 000 and then but then we see them resurrected uh and they're standing there in revelation chapter 15 actually standing with the remnant of the woman's seed which was the unwise virgin because she died also in the tribulation she perished she died of martyr's death because she she rejected the bloody word that would have atoned for her so therefore she had to go in there and give her own blood because she rejected a bleeding word amen so so we realize that's what the word has done for us today friends you're not going in a rapture because you're a great person you're going in a rapture because of christ and he sent a word today that's a bleeding word that puts life down inside you and you're you're transformed paul taught us that we're transformed by the things we gaze at so now you want to think about the things you gaze at and the things you give your eyes and ears to friends it's more important than you might believe and so we need to be transformed not conformed to the world but transformed by the renewing of our mind and of course even though the the 144 thousand are standing there with the uh remnant of the woman's seed that foolish virgin we find out that the foolish virgin remain under under the position of the altar they're not in the millennium yet the 144 000 are you say well why they're there together why you know one of them has the song of moses one has the song of the lamb why do the 144 thousand get to go in and the foolish virgin have to wait till after the millennium because the 144 000 actually received this same message received the holy ghost baptism received the token and are born again see so quite naturally they're part of the first resurrection the unwise virgin will have to wait and come up at the general resurrection and the judgment where everybody gets a fair trial and that's where matthew 25 picks up they'll be granted eternal life it's obvious they don't have it because they're being judged and jesus promised that if you pass from death to life you'll never come to the judgment so isn't that beautiful amen our sins have gone ahead of us by the time you get there it's already fixed your seat on the throne is already saved with your name on it hallelujah oh mine so we're not down there before the throne being judged we're being judged right now this is god's judgment seat right now we shall all stand at the judgment seat and be judged i just choose here and now i don't want to go there and then amen so so we find then that that the that when he comes now brother branham goes from the 70 weeks he then comes into the seven church ages because he wants to show the history of the church how it's come from the days of the early apostles how we arrived at our hour now listen i want to also pitch this in i'm going to go methodically slow on purpose because i i've just been feeling quite a bit of anxiety trying to encapsulate all this into preachable material and uh it's not been easy i've got a lot to say it's going to take a lot of sermons but we're getting started on it today so if i don't get anything other than if i use up all my time on this foundation i'll still dismiss and we'll still be out and i still won't keep you long so so i'm i implore you to just stay with me because i told the lord in the back i just finally sit back took a deep breath and just slowed down and so i i really want to make this this if you miss how all of these parts build the foundation you're really going to get lost in the shuffle when we start showing you the applicable parts of it to to our lives so so we find then that you know brother branham would say out of the ages would come the seals and out of the seals would come the trumpets and out of the trumpets would come the vials and but but we realize that that the seals uh are the entire book of redemption it was that whole plan of god that he had in the back part of his mind remember brother branham and christ is the mystery said said the whole bible it's all just one goal it's all one purpose that god had in redemption his purpose was to have a family that he that would be an expression of him they wouldn't be a different part they'd be of the same part you're not of a different material you're of the same material which is why you have the ability blessed are your eyes for you see and your eyes see because the same element that makes this is the same element that lives in your heart and it was placed there as a gene of god before before you were born you already your name and the lamb's book of life and so so we find then that that he said you know the seals are the entire book and once the seals then are are given by revelation then it's all there then the understanding of the ages and the seals and the 70 weeks and the and the trumpets and the vials we understand it all but you under you want to get it that that that seventh seal is at the very top it's at the very very top everything is under that seventh seal all the six seals are understood because the seventh one opened up see and so brother branham talks about how that it was a sealed book and he talks about scrolls being rolled now i'm not i don't have a rolls of scroll but i can show you in this kind of a book and and get you to i think i can get you put an image in your mind you catch it so it's it's a it's as if it's as if right in the middle there's the first seal and then a little while later he drops a second one and then a third one and then a fourth one and then a fifth one and then a sixth one and then he closes the whole thing and now it's sealed the seventh seal has the whole thing sealed so when he breaks the seventh seal then then now we can say there's the sixth one there's the fifth one there's the fourth one there's the third one there's the second one there's the first one you understand so and and then and then when you're understanding the seals the whole plan of redemption then suddenly you get some teaching about what the trumpets are and what the vows are and how what the woes are and how god is moving down through seven church ages and he's calling a bride out for his name's sake and he's literally taking every age and giving them a piece of himself a piece of himself it goes off and then it gets restored and it comes back at the end time now for the fully unveiled word to do what to transform you into the thing you gaze at so that when the seventh seal was un was unveiled was broken it unveiled the mystery of christ and when it unveiled the mystery of christ it unveiled the bride of christ because she's a part of him oh that's so beautiful all right so because the the ages are under the seals the trumpets are under the seals the vials are under the seals uh the seals are what sealed the book in fact is the seventh seal which is the mystery of god continues unfolding all the way through the tribulation just because we leave the earth the seven still still unwinding it unwinds through daniel's that last half of daniel's 70th week it done it unwinds under all the vials and all and everything in the fullness it unwinds even in the millennium it's still unwinding in the millennium because the millennium is still in time see so consequently for those who go in a rapture how many are planning it amen good how many are planning it now planning to go in a rapture well then congratulations you're right now in the year 2022 you will see 2025 and 2028 and 20 50 and 21 85 and 23 42 and 26 19 and 28 15. you'll still be alive and time will just keep going my what we are in store for friends no wonder i say to you all the time your future is bright amen so now now say with me the devil ain't nobody oh man when that guy is finished and he's disappeared from existence i'll still be moving strong hallelujah he can't stop me he can't even slow it down amen and so so i don't like anybody trying to stop me or anybody trying to slow me down if you ain't got if you ain't as happy as me then get out of my way cause i'm happy amen if you want to complain you're not going to be my friend because i'm happy amen praise the lord i'm happy in the lord sure i got trials sure i got tribulations but if you can't help me please don't stop me get out of my way don't try to block me i got a race to run glory hallelujah how many are running it today amen praise the lord we have to learn that one guys that's that's from back in brother matt start helping me sing now we learned that when he was just a kid amen sister priscilla wallace sings that i'm gonna have to have her come down and sing it for us and teach it to us so it's all a plan of redemption that was sealed up in the book and in that book then god we found out has one purpose one goal one objective that he's been brother bottom said that he's been trying to achieve and all the stories and all the people in the bible yeah the rapture's in a three-phase cycle yes god had a three-phase plan because he wanted to make himself fully known in christ and then he wanted to get preeminence through the holy ghost baptism in his church and then he wants to restore the kingdom to its right position that fell by sin in the garden that's his three steps but he only has one goal and his one goal the three steps is just how he's pulling it off and you're in that time where god has now took seven ages to restore his brag tree and you're now with the fruit in the top of the tree in the presence of the sun ready for the sleeping saints to come back and a body change to ensue and glory bound we go hallelujah so it's really all a plan of redemption sealed with seven seals and it's just that certain parts of it he calls ages certain parts of it he calls trumpets certain parts of it he calls vials don't worry about worry about trumpets and seals we're not gonna go into that today we're only going to cover those as it as it's relevant to the vials because that's my burden because it's under that seventh vial you're going to be shocked at how the vials have played out partially all the way to now and and he poured something into the air and that's that's affecting the minds of humanity all over the world and the only people who are either not insane or not going insane is those who have the mind of christ there's only one elected son that's jesus there's only one sane mind that's christ amen and so let that mind which was in him be in you see and so because he was an elected son it's not me the man that comes predestinated it's a it's a seed of god i was in him he was predestined he is the elected son how did you get elected i was in him so i'm an expression of him how do you know because i when i saw his word i recognized it and i believed it and i and it wasn't just a mental thing i desire to become it in fact is the more i understand it the more i want to be it the more i see of jesus the less i want to be me i don't want to be me anymore me is no good i want to be him me frustrates me me gets on me nerves me hinders me we have seen the enemy and it is us that man in the mirror i said to the church for some of you visitors i said to the church please don't have don't let the greatest enemy you have live between your ears please have the mind of christ so in the excuse me in the early church then the plan of redemption of course the plan of redemption would certainly say well okay they had it in the early church and then it was lost and now we've got it so okay brother jason put all that together how did that work all right first of all you have to understand that the message we have is not a new message it's not another christ in fact is that's what they accuse us of but that they actually have a word for that in psychology and i don't have it in front of me um i could almost recall it but it's where somebody has a problem so they accuse you of having it because they actually have it themselves and they're trying to hide and so they accuse you of having the very thing that's infecting them and uh and so the world says we follow another jesus and it's exact opposite of that they're they're the ones who paul said that you would follow another jesus whom we have not preached and that other jesus is a man-made idea of organized religion and that's definitely not what we have that's what the world hides behind we have the living word and the living god say how do you know he's alive because he proves it in our lives he proves it by keeping his word in our lives every day i'm going to tell you something friends if you want to see the living god in motion then you have come to the right place because we have we have the living god and living realities in our lives the the sick are healed and teenagers are filled with the holy spirit and people are delivered and marriages are healed and and minds are healed and and people get instructed on how to come into the image of the word of god and it's a wonderful place to be see so in the early church of course then the plan of redemption of course it certainly wasn't sealed to saint paul the uh the original book of acts church actually uh we find and this is an important point i don't want to just hurry over this i because there's some confusion that that the message of the hour is something that we understand brother branham understood more than you know this message goes beyond saint paul which is contrary to everything we and branham said but that's what people believe say well is it all that dangerous it sure is because if the devil can get you to believe that then the next little half step he wants you to believe is you now are further than brother branham you see and then and then you say well does it get worse it gets much worse because then that that there's this thinking that that puts so much emphasis in the bride that it diminishes the supremacy of christ see and so just remember he's the main article a bride yes we have a great privilege but it's christ that's who we love that's who we serve that's who we worship that's why we live is because of him amen so it certainly wasn't sealed to paul so we find in fact is that original book of acts church is that the kind of church you want to be so it was that original book of acts church that we find saint paul as a prophet to the alpha church that's where he established i mean think about everything we believe and understand it was paul who established uh what happened in the garden at the time of the original sin he talks about it very candidly uh to the corinthians in second corinthians 11 paul is going to break it down there and in other places about what happened how it would happen and his real and that's just the that's just the nuts and bolts of it that's just x's and o's what happened paul's real fear was is what it would mean if this new fledgling church went in the same direction that eve did and that's why he says i would to god that you bear with me in my folly you remember and indeed bear with me for i've i'm jealous over you with a godly jealousy i've espoused you to one husband that i may present you to christ as a chaste virgin virgin but i fear i fear lest by any means at all any means whether it's the pleasures of sin or the entertainments of the world or misinterpreted theology or missing too much church or not having a good enough prayer life if by any means that he says as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ so and from there of course paul goes on to establish election by or the origin of god to see gene i mean how it's all god's plan paul covers all of that it's all god's plan i got all kinds of scripture references don't need to read them all your bible readers you know how that paul talks about how it's all god's plan and god's purpose and we're all called in him before the foundation of the world and then and then paul goes from there and he he goes into the book of romans and he he starts to tackle the impossible problem for all of god's family who are born in sin you know he says i find a law remember that when i would do good evil is present now here he is here he is a son of god a prophet an apostle filled with the holy spirit and says but when i would do good evil is present so he said now here's his conundrum i find uh that i delight in the law of god after the inward man but man i see another law in my members wow that's that's the guy fighting me that's the greatest battle ever fought it's warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity of the law of sin which is in my members and so so so now brother branham himself then comes in the omega age and and and and brings now a full restoration augmenting what paul says in chapter 8 verse 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ see now that's that's that's the plan that's the answer to the impossible problem that's the answer in the plan of redemption there is therefore now no condemnation paul has just said i got this problem in my flesh but i want to live after the inward man i'm a wretched man but who'll deliver me christ will deliver me because once i'm in him there is now therefore and brother branham said you're not just justified like forgiven for doing it it takes it all the way back like you never did it in the first place and what does it do it takes that sin and transgression ever sin and every transgression you ever committed or will ever commit and it puts it back on the head of the original sinner which was lucifer when he rebelled against christ and tried to establish a kingdom and war ensued in heaven spilled over into the earth and here we are fighting the greatest battle ever fought see and so we we we find that brother branham says how that it it's like putting ink in bleach it breaks it completely back to the original owner of the sin amen i want you to know something friend your sin you're not the original owner of that paul paul admits paul admits freely that at one time we all had our conversation in the lust of the flesh the things of the world and we were by very nature that's where your soul is your nature of the spirit by by nature we were all the children of wrath just like everybody else but it was god rich in mercy who loved us why were you were yet a sinner see and so so so we find that that you you you were born with that impossible condition of a fallen nature but i'm gonna say to you today that was never your original nature you're not the original sinner the original sinner was lucifer and that's why when you take your your sins and they drop in the blood of the lord jesus christ like ink drops into bleach it completely annihilates it and sends it back to the original owner of the sin satan was the first one to unbelieve he was a disbeliever an unbeliever of god's word and rebelled against it so brother branham said taught us it goes back on his head and he has to answer for everything he tripped and trapped me into goody goody goody [Music] so this was the solution to the impossible condition brother branham would would carry carry on with that how that it would answer every transgression i'd ever committed paul goes on from there of course you know he carries on with adoption and you're bible readers he places sons and he goes on from there to um you know marriage and divorce and he fixes marriage in divorce he goes on from there to the future home i hath not seen here hath not heard neither half of it or the heart of men he goes on from there to talk about the mystery of the rapture how it's in three parts how that it's you know it's it's three parts that are going to divide the the resurrection of the of the sleeping from the change of our bodies before the man of sin is made manifest paul had all of that paul understood all of that mysteries see so we've been restored back to that and that's why brother branham said i only ever preached what paul preached it's why you can't impugn the message i can tell you as a as a teacher of this message my whole life studied it since a boy and you cannot impugn the message with the bible it's impossible i've had i've challenged people around around the world no one's ever been able to even get close to doing that because why when he when he said i only ever preached what paul preached and millions shouted out we're resting on that there's not just there's not just all that group there there's this group here today saying we're resting on that see and so of course then now i'm just coming just establishing the foundation i'm just showing you how god established his church and and then and then and then we find out then that after paul passes off the scene and the ages begin to drift from the pure word and and it begins to fall away and every time every time the church disbelieves a word of god a portion of the word of god then he seals that part up see and by the time you reach irenaeus uh brother branham said he's the last one now he's only he's only the student of of polycarp uh uh who's a student of john so it's only like a you know a grandfather father and a grandson so it's not a long time that by the time you reach irena's brother branham said he's the last one with a correct complete correct understanding of the godhead and so it keeps drifting of course and we know the history keeps drifting until christ is deposed and they they they crown a false prophet to lead them to a jezebel system and you know you know you've studied the the ages i don't want to get too bogged down in all that so so then when when a prophet comes in our in our day then now christ now christ has the son of man an uh uh an officer uh in the earth again a prophet in the earth as a ministry of the as a ministry of the son of man as a as an office of the son of man and why is that important because now god christ has someone he can deliver the book to and so he's going to because brother branham couldn't open the book only christ could open the book but christ couldn't come give it to the world he could only give it to a prophet they say well why because that's how he's always done it and he said he wouldn't do anything except he refers to revealed it to the prophets that's why all the apostles had to acquiesce to paul's teaching whether they wanted to or not whether it they didn't like it or not it didn't matter you had to say what paul said see and so and even even even to acquiesces to reluctantly agree with something even even reluctantly it might it might fly in the face of everything you ever learned but i'm here to tell you when god when christ reveals himself you have to say amen to him see amen and so so now he's got a prophet here he can deliver this open book to and it's all laying there see but he he wanted he wanted to deal with with different portions of it so so then you you remember that everything in this mystery of the last age whatever it is whatever it is it must come back to redemption because it's a book of redemption see it's the whole plan of redemption whether it's israel whether it's a gentile bride whether it's red you know it's all redemption whether it's the earth it's redemption it doesn't matter once we have once you have these basic principles down then i'm taking my time because you've got to see piece by piece as we go so wherever we talk about remember you can't change whatever is taught can't fly in the face of the original purpose to express christ and so when you're following something and you're not exactly expressing the word you're not exactly expressing the life of christ like the early church or like elijah of this day then you need to go back and reevaluate what you're feeding on you're not a bad person you just need to go back and reevaluate what you're feeding on see because it doesn't matter to me you could say brother jason come to my house i i planted a lovely apple tree in my backyard and it's got apples on i want you to come taste one see how you like it i show up at your house walk around your backyard and there's a banana tree and i have the sad news to break it to you brother i'm sorry you didn't plant apple seeds you planted banana seeds oh no i didn't oh yes you did oh let me show you my quotes let me show i don't care what quotes you've got i don't care what scriptures line them up how you want build a case but i'm looking at bananas it doesn't matter what you think you built or planted how many scriptures and quotes you can tie together it's got to produce the life of christ it's got to produce and you know what it is the life of christ doesn't it just include holy living it includes power and demonstration of the holy spirit it has overcoming power it has signs and wonders it has the miraculous it has prophecy it has the gifts of the spirit it has everything under flawless perfect control because a bride now is a mature lady who has surrendered her mind to the control of the holy spirit she's not those concerns of her pentecostal childhood uh are not are it's a moot point now because christ was never coming back to marry a little girl anyway he was coming back for a mature bride and so we she has certainly established herself in the earth by feeding on the word of god so so then it it's got to all come back it's got to all it must all end in a restored atom and a restored eve back in a restored eden all right so now you're with me all right good we'll take another block all right so so then god saw under his plan of redemption that there would be seven ages and he he types it everywhere this is the beauty uh when we look at this message and and i'm going to tell you something friends you're so privileged to believe something that is so provable in this book and it just is laced and dovetailed and typed and shadowed back and forth and back and forth and not only do all the verses not only do the verses not contradict each other the types don't contradict not only do the verses dovetail the types dovetail the shadows dovetail see and so so we find then that he he's going to show you say well we had seven church ages god always knew there was going to be seven church ages he always knew that he knew israel would reject the atonement god already knew that see he typed it all the way back in the old testament there's lots of places where we're just going to make a quick reference to just to build your confidence see so you know we've not followed cunningly devised tales this stuff is linkable and connectable all right so so we find then that that he types it all the way through god knowing that israel would reject the atonement when he came that this is why isaiah speaks about a messiah stricken a rejected uh how that israel that calls you know refers to him as an offering the lamb of god but he's going to be rejected and how that god would he's a man of of sorrows and acquainted with grief and and how that god would would take this oh my would take the sin of the whole world and put it on one man so that he could redeem his entire family and give an opportunity for even people who weren't in his gene pool as elected but but they all came from all life comes from god and he's going to give everybody a a an equal opportunity employment to believe the word of god and save yourself from this untoward generation but to his family you didn't choose him he said i've chosen you hallelujah he knew they would reject messiah isaiah referred to it david spoke of how they would expose his bones through beating and tearing of his flesh all my bones they stare at me david as a rejected king weeping over jerusalem jesus doing the same thing there weeping over jerusalem jerusalem jerusalem how oft would i have covered you so so the book of moses in genesis 48 speaks then you you can look you can see manasseh and ephraim when when joseph brings his boys to his prophet daddy for his blessing and the bible says joseph is very careful he takes the oldest son in his left hand to guide him to the right hand of his prophet and he take of the prophet his dad who's a prophet and he takes the younger son with his right hand to the left hand of his dad so that his father will put the right hand of blessing on the oldest child the firstborn manasseh and he'll he'll bless the younger also but the main one's going to go to manasseh which would represent israel and that's not the kind of bride that christ was going to take even joseph himself had married a gentile bride and so when the prophet reaches out to put his hands the holy spirit crosses his hands and he puts his right hand on the younger and joseph is praying and everybody's praying and everybody's happy and joseph is so happy until he opens his eyes and he's seeing a prophet do something he don't agree with now he's upset yeah the bible said he was he said he would i forget the word the king james uses all he got he was alarmed almost like angry and he he actually is so audacious that he lifts the hand of a prophet then mid blessing mid prayer when a prophet is talking to god and joseph is so upset in his human spirit he lifts his hand and says not so father gonna correct the prophet and the prophet pulls back and refuses to uncross it says i know my son you know what you think i don't know this said the lord hath crossed my hands said don't worry about manasseh god will bless him too and he'll become a nation but this younger one this is the one who's going to get the big blessing this is the one this is a gentile representation that it's going to cross over into the gentiles and there's and there and they're not going to be believers just just a little in a little tiny area of palestine that a jew can't even leave without being backslid this thing's gonna go global and it doesn't matter and jesus said the time is coming and now is when you won't say it we'll worship in jerusalem or we'll worship in here but but whoever will worship will have to do it in spirit and in truth wherever he is it won't matter where he's from or what he's done or how he was born he can have access back to god that's the plan of redemption see and so he knew then see he he he knew uh you know too even if you take the trumpets okay and i'll just mention them like this just this for a second i'm just showing you all i'm doing is i'm not teaching on the trumpets today i'm only showing you that that god knew everything in advance this is why when john is is being given the tour through the book of revelation or signifying angel comes john tries to worship this signifying angel several times and the signifying angel keeps stopping him and says don't worship me i'm just your brother i'm your fellow servant and one of the prophets worship god and so here john now is god so now when you read the book of revelation and you read about this prophet from the future see and so here in the book of revelation people say why why are you always talking about a prophet at the end time well it was in the bible and john is actually having a conversation with this prophet from the future and it is this prophet from the future who's showing him all of these mysteries and taking him it's it's the same one he comes up under the vials because the the the of course the messengers under the vials would be the same as the seven messengers to the ages because vows are judgment it's it's the it's the rejection of their seven age messages of why the judgment's coming does that make sense to you see just like brother branham talks about that under the seals he set a seal partially opened and a messenger catches it and runs with it and the people gather around the word and then the messenger goes off the scene god lays away that age and uh lays them away in the grave lays them asleep remember jesus said you know in the midnight hour because every age slept every age slept every age slept but in the midnight hour coming to now the end time says a christ said the bridegroom cometh see and all of them rose to try to trim their lamps this is flat trimming time and so he so we we find that that that brother branham says and then and then there and then god drops a temporary judgment on that age in that church age for why for rejecting the word see and and that's why you read that that's why i'll show you my next the next time we're covering this i'll show you that the trumpets and the vials uniquely run together they they all they're all perfectly harmonious they they even the judgment is on the same thing only in the trumpets you read about a third of this and a third of that a third of this because this is the judgments falling on israel uh down through the ages but then there's there's an element of the vial also that's matching the trumpet age for age that's falling on the antichrist system and falling on the world partially you see in the end time when it comes to the seventh the seventh is the completion of everything and that's why after the trip when the during the tribulation when the bride is gone then you have the vials in their fullness they're fully poured out and here comes seven angels to do it and one of the seven coming and he's the same one who would show him the great harlot he's the same one who would show him the bride the lamb's wife if that's not elijah the prophet i don't know my bible i'm here to tell you something friends because why the world has rejected the the complete message of redemption and now the bride is gone and the man of sin goes into flesh and he begins his right and you don't want to be here during that time now everything i just said might have left you blinking don't worry i'll cover that again i just had to get that out we'll cover it a little slower so i i'm just showing you that that so that you can see how god knew it all i mean when when he you know when he's gonna when he's going to come to the ages or when he's going to come to the trumpets this is exactly why the trumpets in order to understand them you have to go back all the way back to the other book of moses leviticus and you have to catch the seven feast times and you you have to you have to start you know you have to you have to start with christ and and i and i'm not here to teach on the feast days that's a whole other topic in and of itself but but you find that it that it's it's gonna go from christ the lamb it's all christ in his earthly part first three are christ in his earthly ministry because from the time that that that you come from this this lamb of god this this past uh this this this passover feast then what are you gonna have you're gonna go to the unleavened bread because christ had no leaven in him see and then you're gonna go to first fruits the third one because why he's up out of the grave see he's the first fruits of them and and everybody's gonna come up just like that and then what's your fourth feast it's pentecost that's the holy ghost falling see god knew that god knew that all the way in the old testament he knew that would play out and at sixteen hundred years later the cycle would start and then that would run two thousand years and so god literally predicts the future in the history and then it comes to pass and then people say they don't believe it and it literally and that's why that that when it comes to the to the pentecostal now it's not unleavened it's not an unleavened bread it's two loaves and they have leaven in them because why it's jew and gentile and it's got sin in it it's gonna have to be burned by fire under the pentecostal experience that's the only way you get the leaven and the sin out of you is to the fire of the holy ghost baptism and then for 2000 years we're going to go under the feast of pentecost all the way until the time of the feast of trumpets for the jews and what does it do starts calling israel back home which that's exactly what happened in the book of revelation i'm getting way ahead of myself and then and then of course what's their then then they're going to come from the feast of trumpets then they're going to come to the sixth one and and here's the feast of atonement and what is it moses and elijah bringing them the one they rejected after the bride's done going home and then the only thing left now oh my then they come to the feast of tabernacles because that's the change of bodies that's the millennium and you can't make this stuff up that fits flawlessly and history uh proves it because every way as brother branham went through the ages and he went through the seals and he correlated it to history that you can google and you can see that the history matched the word thousands of years in advance then why would i not believe this message of the hour when it come in the last day just like it promised it would to do what to open the seals and reveal christ and reveal the word and we could eat our way into a body change friends see so this is why you see it happening like that all right now i'm almost out of time i got 10 minutes now a lot of the stuff i just said in overview i'll show it to you a little more clear it comes with repetition the more you hear it suddenly you'll start to remember it suddenly the puzzle starts to come together and you see a picture don't stress over today if you're sitting there and you're like okay well wait which came from i mean who'd he what who's on first what what i mean wait a minute was it a what feast to what trumpet don't worry don't worry breathe just calm down it's all good i'm going to take my time and we're going to really break it down slow but now i want to come a little bit and touch on my burden today i'm just now getting to my to my first verse so brother branham says in the message in 1960 the revelation that was given to me because i'll just give you a preview of my burden okay this is good i should do this yeah this is a good idea people think that brother branham said well brother i'm never preached on the trumpets you'd be mistaken he took a whole series on it over over a whole more than a month and preached it at home in his own pulpit brother branham comes in 1965. now i'm just going to tell you a little story and i'm going to read a couple quotes and we're going to stop for today okay so brother branham comes to the pulpit in july 1965. and he comes to the tabernacle oh i think on july i believe the 11th and the message is shamed and brother branham says now we came here for the express purpose to preach on those vials and he said i've got it on my heart feeling definitely led and he said we tried to get the school auditorium they wouldn't give it to us they said no too many people crowd in things get broke and tore up and billy you know we love you uh you're a hometown boy but we're not gonna let you do it anymore it's just it's just too many people come to hear you and so so brother branham comes back and sits down with the board of trustees this is all on tape and he's just describing it and he he says now i talk to the board what can we do he said now we don't have enough room here in the tabernacle for all the people he said could you imagine us because they had done done that in the seals and they seen what how i mean that really got bad i mean that was like crowding extraordinary fire marshal would have put everybody in jail if they had caught him i used to go to the tabernacle it only holds so many people and and so he says now we can't just crush everybody in here and he said can you imagine trying to take you know seven seven services and cover those vials he said my he said because by this time now now the message is really people have realized what it is and they would come it would even be more than when he opened the seals and he says so he says what we've decided to do is he said beginning next week and he's going to he's that's the 11th and i think then he's going to come i think on the on the uh 18th i think and he said then we're going to start it on the 18th and he's going to start coming with certain with sermons trying to do god a service without it being his will and then he's going to come back uh the next service anointed ones at the end time and then he's going to come back with with another one and another one and another one and another one and and brother branham all through there what people miss is because brother branham didn't title it the vials but if you go in the and what we're going to do as a church what the lord has on my heart is i want to go through those sermons and show you where brother branham is pointing at at the madness and the craziness in the world and saying this is why because he released something in the air that's caused the world to go insane and i'm going to make the i'm going to connect all the dots for you i'm going to show you how that that those three unclean spirits like frogs you say all the vials are only in the tribulation well then how's how does he identify three unclean spirits like frogs as a trinity doctrine rising up at the end time to lead the church away from the word see how does he identify rock and roll music and worldly music and and show by the bible that the two things that will lead the world to armageddon is the trinity doctrine and rock and roll music and to the religious it'll be the trinity and to the non-religious it'll be hollywood motown nashville it'll be all of the all of that worldly entertainment that like a pied piper will lead the whole world to armageddon you think about that young person next time you jump in your vehicle and the devil tells you to hit that radio dial or pull up that to pull up that tune you just remember that's the same demons that came out of a bottomless pit that went into the earth and are corrupting the minds of men and it's leading them to armageddon and it'll drive you crazy as well and so so we find that brother branham goes from there he said now what we'll do is next weekend i'll take two sermons and then the next weekend i'll take two more and then the next weekend i'll take two more and he's going to cover seven services and all through there you're going to be hearing you're going to be hearing certain and i have went through and i've worked my way through the first two i've listened to them multiple times i'm going very slowly and i'm pulling out the references that tie back to say now i see why this is in the world because of this now i see here's the warning to us because this happened and brother bradham comes all the way to the end of he say yeah but he didn't why didn't he call it the vials but when you go to the last one when you go to that seventh one brother branham you know what he says he says to the church he says now he says now i hope you understand those vials a little better amen and people miss that because he never called it that but hit the burden on his heart during those seven services over covering over four weekends that's the burden on his heart is to teach on the vials to show you the judgments falling on the world to show you what's causing what's causing us to have a mass shooting in this country more than once a day now greater than once a day it's almost 1.6 i think it's 1.6 times a day this nation has a mass shooting of four more people killed not in not including the shooter this is why they go into elementary schools and kill first graders and fourth graders and seventh graders this is why they do it in shopping malls brother branham warned that this would happen he said the whole world's going insane this is why you have the polarization this is why you have uh uprisings and fights and riots and everything in the streets and and everybody's screaming for justice yet nobody wants nobody really wants justice you say well that's an aw that's a presumptuous statement no it's not the only the only one that's justice is this and nobody wants this so i just i don't tell you they they can carry the the the white supremacists can carry their signs the african-americans and brown people can carry their signs the the asian people can carry their signs but i'm here to tell you the only justice is here the republicans can rant and rave and the democrats can jump up and down and the independents can curse both of them and the atheists can run and the heathen can rage but here's the only justice here's the only truth here's the only peace hallelujah i'm so glad to be a part of the family of god where it doesn't mean that what color you are it doesn't mean that what nation you're from it doesn't mean that how you were born it doesn't mean that how you were cultured we're all the family of god in love one with another and marching to zion and we see the madness of all sides everything outside of the word is insane and that's where we are friends and that's where we've arrived to and so i want to take and i had two laid out today i'm not even going to get to touch them it's going to read you a couple of quotes and we're going to stop i got 60 seconds brother branham says in the revelation that was given to me listen to this in luke as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man see at the coming of the son of man now watch close abraham there's always three classes of people on the earth believers make believers unbelievers now watch him as it was in the days of sodom now there were there was a unbelieving nation called sodom very sinful very bad and they had some believers down there the church natural lot his people see now abraham represents means church spiritual he had separated himself from the unbelievers and the make believers a very beautiful picture of the church today you know why that's a beautiful picture because the word church means the called out so that's why that if you're not separated from the world you're a fake christian i'm not trying to hurt your feelings i'm trying to wake you up you're a fake christian if if you have if you're still entangled with the world if you love the world or the things of the world in your heart that jesus said it's because the love of god is not in you see he's not insulting you he's trying to help you trying to get you to wake up and go wow i'm not as safe as i thought i'm not okay no you're not okay see you want you want to have that nature completely changed and so brother branham says that's what the church means the called out that's what the church is today are called out so that so now elijah the only one with the authoritative voice to do it elijah has now just disqualified every christian church in the world that's not living separate from the world he has invalidated their charter immediately under the word of a prophet this is why he this is why he could come and indict an entire generation and they didn't want to believe him and they got mad and they stomped out and it didn't matter brother branham says i do this in the presence of the judge amen and that's the one they couldn't dare deny because he brother branham could prove he's here said he said if if that pillar of fire brother said oh well if that's in question that can be proven and nobody wanted to speak against that and that's the same one he says now the angel of the lord he says i do this in the presence of the judge i indict this generation for the second crucifixion of jesus christ calling him your lord calling as calling him your husband and you're an adulterous woman who's still partying with the world and and and believing every kind of nonsense out of manmade systems so he says now it's time for the end time then there were three men that met abraham two of them were angels but they looked like men dust on their clothes dirt on their feet abraham said come sit down under the oak wash your feet i'll bring you a piece of bread then you may go on see abraham was looking for something that's what the church the believer is today watching for something he knew the time was growing close just like noah watching enoch when enoch went up noah knowed the storm was close see because there's an application of noah as the foolish virgin but primarily noah represents israel brotherhood said that taught that right on tape and so so enoch represented the bride taken in a rapture see and so of course it's a double application i'm not teaching on that today but but but it comes down to this friends that that these men whether it was abraham whether it was noah whether it was enoch whether whoever it was they were just like john they were watching the times they were watching prophecy just like daniel he was learning by books and he knew it's about time for us to go home we were only supposed to be here 70 years and we are right pegging that now and daniel started setting everything in motion before before it before it even was going to come to pass daniel was already starting to be a voice and god was already moving in politics and anointing a heathen king to allow israel to go back home you think that king would have done that on his own volition nothing doing there's nothing in it for him but to let a rebellious nation who were historically known to be rebellious and to let them go back and build a fortified city are you kidding no what king would do that in fact is when when when sanbalot and all them saw what was happening they wrote to the king and said you know your majesty you do you know the history of these people you let them come and and and build a temple and they're zealots and they're building a wall and do you know do you not know that they're rebellious to to your forefathers and your predecessors and then the the king finds out says oh my goodness shut it down shut it down he issues an edict and quickly this is in the book of ezra yeah let's shut this down no i don't how did that happen who who gave them permission uh sir your majesty there's an edict from cyrus oh wait wait wait hold it hold it up what what did he say well he said they could go and he actually gave him money out of the national treasury and he even said if anybody interfered with them they should be killed and their families killed and impaled on stakes and their houses crushed the powder okay we better let them go because the the the laws of the medes and persians could not be countermanded even even even when a king gave up word he even he couldn't change it once it went out it became law it was unchangeable so god had already preserved them and it didn't matter that it didn't make sense to the common world it was god's plan it doesn't matter that you seem like a bunch of backwoods backwash hillbillies who don't know nothing you're actually the apple of his eye are you glad for that today listen friends we've got to be watching for these things now i've i what am i going to do next time when i continue on i don't know that'll be wednesday but i got to give up some of these other brothers uh getting getting there wanting to preach that's fine we love to hear them but i might be preaching wednesday i ain't giving it up yet so don't anybody jump in yet so we'll just have to see so uh i i'm unlike brother harold hildebrandt said one time years ago he said i don't really like how i preach and boy did i relate to that and he said i don't really like how i preach he said now i do like what i preach so i don't like how i preach but i do like an awfully lot what i preach because i love seeing the image of christ come so plain and being able to get other people to see that as a reward extraordinaire so so we're we're going to go forward next time and we're going to put up some diagrams and we're going to try to again in a elementary way just foundational make a few of the statements i've made and show you a picture and get it fixed in your mind because listen here's why here's why here's why by the time i get to those seven services and we start bringing out things that brother branham said i don't want any doubt in your mind that that was supposed to be said it's true and i need to obey it because i've i've seen by prophecy where we are and there's no more time
