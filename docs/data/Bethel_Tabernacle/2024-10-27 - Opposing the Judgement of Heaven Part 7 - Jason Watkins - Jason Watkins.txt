it's not as bad as I my I had a former Pastor who was got preaching and just got going and he wanted to make an example he's going to use his daughter and you know like I would look here at Zoe and he just he just said just like my daughter uh what's your name sweetheart I'm not that bad amen praise the Lord God bless you Hebrews chapter 11 man my didn't we have a wonderful time at Camp Amen Let me just uh while you're finding your spot there in Hebrews let me just uh say to the uh streaming audience we are hopefully we have everything back it you don't realize what it is to literally they take everything all the wires connectors computers equipment speakers microphones everything everything gets pulled out taken to camp and then the brothers have an arduous task to put it all back together and get it all working amen because it's got to work they don't want me to get on them it's got to be working amen so we appreciate their hard work and dedication and as to that um that cutting out on the audio we're still working on that we've thought we've had it several times uh brother Bradley thinks he's got it isolated because I think it was doing it at the camp so that means it can't be our Network so we've got to figure out where that Gremlin is excuse me so um I want to also just uh make a quick announcement next Saturday uh for you Brothers you probably saw brother Matt sent it out there's a Bible study a men's bible study breakfast at 9:00 am. brother Joe Adams is going to be here with us next weekend we're looking forward to that him and sister Jessica I told I sent a message to Sister Jess and I said you know you can't be a respector of persons and you've never sang at bethl Tabernacle even she was here and didn't sing somehow she snuck onto the radar and I said so you owe us a mini concert amen so we're going to try to put at least make her sing a few songs for us it's a wonderful blessing to the bride of Christ so uh but anyway we're having a men's uh Bible study breakfast on Saturday November 2 9:00 a that'll be with brother Joe I've invited a number of other churches that evening brother Joe is going to do a youth service I've sent out um to probably a half a dozen or more churches over brother blue brother Samuel the churches in Columbia pastors and let them know for youth of all ages and we're going to have refreshments and and fellowship afterward and I just want to say on the internet that anybody that's hearing and wants to come come on we can always go buy more food it's right up the street amen might be a fried chicken but it'll go with the pizza it'll work amen so any anybody that wants to come we can always get more food amen we want to be praying for brother Bradley to have a speedy recovery and trusting the Lord that all of that amen falls into place for him may I say this morning that and I don't I I almost never know how many people are out here for the adult Sunday school class I know it's not attended like the group I see now and uh you know I don't want to go down a road of that I I just want to say that boy if you're not making it to the adult Sunday class you are missing out brother Jason has been on a series correcting all of the woke eras of the age and that's what it's been about our young people are inundated flooded deled with woke ideology and the complete fracturing and destruction of the nuclear family A Woman's Place a man's place and uh I I have been hearing very very balanced teaching on that and I would encourage you especially if you have uh a raising teenagers Sons or daughters or both that you get those and for you husbands and and and wives and Dads Moms you make sure that you go back if you've missed those because I'm here to tell you the word corrects the error and we are not here to let Satan's Eden uh poison the minds of our young people and so uh I I I told Brother JD I said I'm going to come out and say my name is Jason Watkins and I endorse this message that you have been hearing it has been phenomenal amen I think it's worth a round of applause amen and brother and brother JD and only the way that he can do he just so methodically just drops bomb after bomb right from the scriptures right from the message you can't impune the brother because he's backing everything up he's saying with what a prophet taught us but it has to be as Peter said stirring you up by way of remembrance I'm going to tell you something friends we're never this ministry team is never going to back down and let the world steamroll us that's not the program of this pull pit we're here to take a stand for the word of God is that how you want it praise the Lord then you have come to the right place amen Hebrews chapter 11 amen figure out where I want to start Hebrews chapter 11 let's just look at verse one now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report now that's two two big points already that it was the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen number two the elders obtained a good report by the operation of it and look at number three through faith we understand that the worlds were framed think about that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that and here's a mindblower This Will Blow fuses so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear so there's nothing in nature that constructed itself this was all initialized designed well thought out by the Creator and he has an absolute purpose in all of it amen let's bow our heads father we thank you now for your word and we want to look into it now master and we pray that your that that mind of Christ will flow freely Lord we're dedicating our hearts and Minds to you now Lord we have set ourselves aside we've studied this thought we've prepared ourselves and we're a vessel standing here today uh Lord with Clean Hands of course that's only because of the blood of the Lamb has been applied to us none of us are worthy Lord but you have made us worthy and we have followed you now I pray that with nothing hindering that the enemy be be put aside and let the word go forth Lord let the preaching of the Gospel drive back as a prophet described it it cast out Devils by driving them back and allowing the Holy Spirit to sew the word in the hearts of the people uh so Lord let it be so now we commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated we finished last time speaking about how that our lives are infused with eternal life and this gives us it ought to give us an eternal perspective now I know I'm starting late to today um that's on me I asked brother Tony for some extra time and that's why he went so long and then I had a few announcements to make I won't I won't preach keep you here all day so just give me out just a little bit of time and we're going to move through this today I'm not trying to get through it all unless I do unless I can um but we'll just look at that we'll watch that time closely we won't no death worse than being drugged to death right amen praise the Lord so we found that that perfect faith has is where we're speaking on and this of course and I I be honest with you I didn't expect when I started the series opposing the Judgment of Heaven I really didn't expect to come to perfect faith I was thinking about it I thought it'd be part of a different thing I realized that the Lord wanted to incorporate it in this thought now you remember that the excuse my voice this morning it'll get straightened out amen I'll preach it and blow it out once I get preaching but um we we the the whole premise uh of the of our series opposing the Judgment of Heaven is that the world is so opposite of what God has decreed in his word and that we started out by saying as just as a reminder that you would think that that creation would look at its creator and when the Creator weighed in on a topic and gave his judg on the matter you'd think that a knowledgeable creation full of wisdom would go yes sir thank you sir we'll get on that right away but but it's actually the opposite not only do they not in Mass receive his judgments they and there's many of them don't even believe in him at all and they if they do believe in him they believe he's impersonal and not connected and we're just on our own anyway uh and I'd rather believe he don't exist than to believe that but we find that that there is and there was prophesied in the word and Jesus made it clear that those who do hear his word hear it because of the origin of where they came from he taught that in John's gospel so many different places St John 6 St John 8 St John uh 12 so many places where he shows that those who hear his word have been taught of God not only are you being taught of God now but there was a time that's somewhat murky to us we we have enough to know that there was a time when morning Stars sang together and we know that there was a time when sons of God shouted for joy and we know a prophet talked about how that that was the plan of redemption and they were being shown the plan no wonder they're rejoicing I'm still rejoicing over that plan because we see ourselves as a part of it and that's the real strength I can tell you friends that's the real strength of being a Christian is when you can see yourselves as part of it that it's not just Doctrine it's not just teaching it's not just a learned lifestyle amen that it actually is intrinsic it actually is is self-evident when the eagle screams you something happened and sometimes it even defies your own ability to explain it to your loved ones who knew you before and say what's happened to you well I I I I heard a I went to church well everybody goes to church yeah but I heard a sermon everybody he that yeah but I I looked at something and I there was an identity there was something you you're you sound crazy I might be but I'm happy this way all I know is that there's some kind of a alien life living inside me that says Amen to every word of God and it causes me to want to go toward the word and it makes me want to live like this that's a nature change that's the new birth a human can't do that to themselves fact is when they're born in sin they're the opp opposite of that amen so it's not just about a learned behavior and that's why it's not a a a book of rules it's a book of life yeah amen you understand it's not about a book of conduct it's about a book of origin it's about a book that shows you that you had a you came from God you believ God you you're you're you're part of the word that came from God am so we find then that that that that's the that's the part where perfect faith can begin to operate if you if you don't are not in that position in your life full of the holy spirit of God to operate perfect faith is going to be very difficult for you amen amen very difficult for you because you're you're too as brother brandom used the old timey word galed up you're you got too much gum you got too much sludge you got too much of the world there's too much obstacle the word can't flow through you you're a conduit that's what you're here for you're a conduit you're supposed to be the word made flesh living on the earth again while Jesus is in heaven amen amen that's the mission that's why the gospel came so so naturally our job then we found out to be able to operate perfect faith is that we we we have found that it's all about our dedication to God our belief in his word our trusting uh in his life and I'm I you know I I I I'm just trying to figure out how I want to bring this today so so we we found out that then because Satan knows Satan already knows he can't stop the word amen that's been tried he failed miserably every time he's ever tried that he fails so what he does is a prophet said he attacks the vessel that carries it now as preachers we know know that he does that by putting sickness and attack us and we try to come to preach and our throat is uh you know grally and we're trying to we don't have enough strength or whatever and it takes the anointing to help us he's always trying to hinder The Vessel but that's also that's you and me in our daily lives his his goal is to try to fill you up with the stuff of the world turn your eyes away from Jesus put your eyes on Hollywood put your eyes on the nonsense put your eyes own career and education nothing wrong with those things but Satan Jesus said seek ye first in other words it's it's that's the order of things your life should be word driven Christ first that brother brandham said he needs to be first in your life he doesn't want to be second he doesn't deserve to be second I think that's such a true statement he doesn't deserve to be second see and and everything you do and it's not just I'll put him first and then okay he's at the head of the line now I can pay attention to everything else it's not it's more than that it's the order of everything all of the other things down your list of career and education choice for a spouse how you live Recreation entertainment vacations whatever you do Christ ought to be the first consideration in every one of those every one of those areas and and that's how perfect faith can operate and we found out that perfect faith is not just something under the opening of the seals we found out it's a very ancient power that Joshua operated job operated it Abel operated it see and so it's a revelation that you receive of God's word and you you live your life in such a way that God can flow through you so this is you know we we finished off last time when we were talking about I said you know there there Hollywood has their ideas and science has their ideas what they call a Multiverse and that's uh almost become uh you know ubiquitous today when they're describing realities and ples of reality and they they talk about a Multiverse there is a Multiverse just not like they think we can see in Daniel where we read last time 8:13 then I heard one Saint speaking and another Saint said unto that Saint uh unto that certain Saint which spoke how long shall be the vision we know that that that that Ezekiel talked about Joshua the high priest standing there before the king and he says if you'll keep my word and obey my statutes I'll give you place among these you see so I know there is a Multiverse I know there's more than this I know there's another world I know it's coming I know that's our destiny I'm telling you I say it all the time our future is bright friends don't let this world drag you down don't let it depress you and fill you full of anxiety your future is bright don't let it cause you to think suicidal thoughts and think oh it's no use in trying listen friends try as hard as you want you'll never get there somebody's already paid the way for you all in 10 so the the whole trick is is is when I when I think about as I said closing last time in part six that when I think about you know putting my my affections on things above that that that that's you know more than just setting my mind on teaching that my mind continually perpetually thinks about my loved ones who are on the other side who are still alive More Alive than me and I'll see them soon I think about that morning when the trumpet sounds and I'll walk in my living room and the prophet said you have a funny little feeling I'm looking forward to that funny little feeling he talks one time it'll be like a little twinge of pain but it'll be the last pain you ever feel in your life oh Hallelujah friends we have not a lot to live for we have everything to live for there is nothing to equal what the reward for dedicating your life to God and there is not such great a loss and needless loss as refusing to do that and missing out God don't let it don't let it be any of us so we find that that the key to operating perfect Faith the main key is that and we we we showed you last time I think I did I preached some of this in Phoenix I don't remember what all I said here but but to really understand the key to perfect faith is that's the Sunday evening service go to brother brandham Sunday morning service that set up that service and he preaches How can I overcome and from there he comes back a few hours later and Carries On and starts talking about a perfect faith and he says he he starts talking about he says I was hunting and I was in the woods and he said there was an old dead log laid across the creek and he said I it was too far to jump so I was going to go across this dead log and he said and just as I jumped up on it the whole thing gave way he said it was rotten on the inside you couldn't tell on the outside it looked fine he said on the outside it looked just like a Christian strong said you know ready to Bear me up but said inside it was all rotted out and he said the reason that it was so rotted out is because it was laying over the top of water he said dead wood in the presence of water rots twice as fast so you come to church and you you know we're not just let me just take it on out not just about coming to church on some some service you're here today for a service but what is your life I mean you you certainly ought to be coming into contact with the Lord more than just a coming to service that's the whole that's the whole thing we're discovering about applying the token yes amen listen friends Brother Brad and I were talking about this last night and brother brother Tony we were talking and I was saying listen I said every year when I come to Youth Camp we're finding greater and greater and it it does match the scripture greater and greater instances of young people struggling with anxiety teenagers yeah having nervous breakdowns and panic attacks you're young what in the world get my age and you'll have a panic attack my goodness full of Youth and vigor and vitality you're beautiful you're strong you're healthy what do you got to be anxious about see so so so you got your whole life ahead of you but Satan is attacking the minds that's part of the insanity brother brandom called it a plague that's on the age the God of this evil age and that's the madness you see on the streets that's why you see the burgeoning of woke ideology it would have never got past first base 20 years ago but people are going crazy and they're accepting craziness to denying basic science of gender identity for crying out loud it'd almost got cut to that chase because you know they can't deny that okay let me just cut to the chase I'll just give you one you can't deny how about what's what's a man and what's a woman well they won't even tell you yeah amen amen I mean you you don't even know what to say sometimes and I don't want to go down that road because I get it's too [Laughter] fun sometimes I want to ask them if they have rabies or do they have what how are they possibly thinking that but it is the anxiousness of the hour brother brandham listen brother brandham was already calling it a neurotic age Amen in the 60s come on in the 60s we more than half a century deeper than that he was already saying back then it was a neurotic age filled with neurotics see so this so this this anxiety and this this perplexity of mind and the Bible says in the last days men's Hearts would fail for fear and that's anxiety fear is the fear and the greatest fear is the fear of the unknown everybody knows something's wrong nobody knows what it is and worse yet they don't know how to fix it and they just hope against hope they just close their eyes and hope it's not the end well it is and it isn't hallelujah it's going to be the end of this world order but it's not going to be the end of me it's not going to be the end of you it's not going to be the end of the Earth Hallelujah so so so so then when I when I look back at that now now I begin to see cuz as I was saying in our youth camp and every year this is our fourth year and every year it's increasing young people coming up with fear and anxiety and last year it was like a third like a third of young people this camp we had almost brother Matt gave us the count it was almost just nearly 70 different churches represented at our youth camp amen and and time after time they were coming up fear anxiety fear anxiety fear anxiety fear anxiety and and we find out that I began to think about that and I realized as I was pondering that I said Lord I think that we weren't catching the real full depth of meaning that the Holy Ghost was trying to get across to the people in the 60s when he had a prophet preach the token amen and he said apply the token to your home to your family to your children and we've sold you many times that when you apply something you if you're going to put a veneer or laminate what do you do you apply it you bring it into contact applying the token is not a message cliche amen it's an instruction to bring your home into contact with the Holy Spirit bring your children into contact with the Holy Spirit I'm bringing them into contact twice a week but I don't live with you they need to be brought into into contact by the parents and I and I think that we underestimated how neurotic and crazy the age would come and I think we might need to go back and reassess and say oh I need to apply the token to my children to my home to my family because that's the only thing to combat the Neurosis that's on the streets amen and if you're not doing it no wonder your children are full of fear anxiety and it it was even increased again this year I think it was more than a third brother Donnie I heard went home I haven't heard it yet he went home his own assembly last Wednesday and preached the whole sermon on it it's shocking it's alarming to us as ministers I'm here to tell you something friends the Holy Ghost brings a peace that passes understanding it that's the scripture is that the scripture that's the promise of the Holy Ghost I understand genes and heredity and I understand menopause and I understand hormones I get it but I'm here to tell you there's an answer in God's word there is a solution there is a peace that you can have and you deserve it and your children deserve it and your family deserves it this church deserves it why because we are believers we are we are entitled to these things the whole world is Marching for their rights what about you they were the the devil listen the devil and I'm way away from I'm in my notes but I'm all up and down the devil was strictly instructed and warned by the holy spirit in in the Book of Revelation see thou hurt not the oil and the wine you're going to do everything to them you're going to have a white horse of deception you're going to have a red horse you're going to have a sword you're going to have a black horse you're going to take their Bibles but don't you touch that oil and wine I strictly forbid that so the devil cannot take that those things away from you they are your inalienable rights that means you don't need anybody's permission to believe God you don't need anybody's permission to have faith you don't need anybody's permission to get the Holy Ghost it's already promised to you Hallelujah see and the devil can't deny it unless you give him that permission unless you you know walk in your life and run your home home to the tune and and let and let the siren song of leoa Let the P Piper of leoa uh take you and your children right over a cliff I say not so we shall not stand for that we're going to keep preaching the word of God and if it gets uncomfortable buckle up it'll get more uncomfortable we want to see the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit and parents if you won't preach it to your children you're going to have a problem cuz I'm going to do it and they're going to say why does brother Jason preached this at church but you and Mom and you and Dad do this why do I have this at church but I don't have this at home and you're going to be embarrassed and put on the spot don't look to me for pity I'm going to take a stand on the word of God I'm their Pastor just like I'm your pastor and we're going to give him the unadulterated bare fisted word of God hallelujah if you don't like that you're at the wrong church because we stand on the word of God again and again and again and again and I'll keep saying it again the the the the token must be applied to your home no excuses the whole world marches and demonstrates for their rights and we give ours away to the devil constantly so so perfect Faith then we have found and see this is why it's so fitting for the series opposing the Judgment of heav CU as I said to you in one of the parts one of the installments everything the world you see on the news and all their marches and all their demonstrations and all the signs they're holding up and all the liberal media they have oh o opposes everything God is for and they are for everything that God opposes that's right tell me I'm wrong tell me I'm wrong look on the news look at the headlines look at the marches look what they're saying I I mean look look at the resistance against Israel look at the resistance against the nuclear family look at the resistance again against common sense in biology amen right and they're and they're getting more and more the power and the force of law behind them and people are being harassed and I'm not here to preach get on a political bandwagon the whole thing's going Dash and Cinder anyhow Hallelujah I don't I don't care to sin about that who who do you want to be president exactly who the Lord has in mind I'm not Prejudice I hate both of [Applause] them I don't really I pray I I pray the Lord will break through on them either one of them could be children of God unbeknown even to them you know uh but but at the same time you know my goodness after a while you go where where's all this hoopla I mean does anybody care about the word of God see so so perfect Faith then we have found out is the mind of Christ flowing through you unfettered that's what it is it's not something under the seven Thunders the seven Thunders came to tell you who you are because that confidence in who you are is a necessary element to operating perfect faith brother BR teaches that in perfect faith and so so we find that we have so many you know where Daniel was there we were there last time and Daniel had been shown the sequence of end time events and how they've shaped the world and they've come to pass perfectly events in Prophecy unfolding into history and and not merely from Daniel's day but all the way back to Genesis and you know Daniel was able you know to have faith like job job caught that Revelation I know my redeemer liveth Daniel went away with a confidence that it's G to be all right God's got it in complete control Daniel wouldn't see it he told him you won't see it Daniel it be for the end time but don't worry seal it up this is what's going to happen and that's exactly and Daniel went to sleep with his fathers with the confidence that God's word would Prevail if I go if I sleep with my fathers by tomorrow you just know that I went down in faith and I'll rise up in that same Faith Hallelujah it allows us to look at the world and observe the world and yet find comfort and find direction and find satisfaction in a life well- lived and and may I say that's more rare than you might think it is a life well-lived because I'm not talking about adding zeros to your bank account or a third and fourth vehicle to your garage that's not what I'm talking about I'm not talking about adding you know linear feet to your yacht because people who have all that linear footage of Yachts jump out of 30 stor Windows people who have all of those garage full of cars end up on drugs and kill themselves on overdoses so don't tell me that's where peace is that's not where peace is peace is right here see the real satisfaction that comes in knowing that your life has realized its perfect course and I and I don't remember if I said this here in Phoenix but my life is circular it's not linear because if it's linear than I started here and I'm obviously finishing here my life is circular from home to home I came from home I'm going back home Hallelujah and that knowledge helps me to operate perfect Faith see so because listen friends I mean goodness what's the what's the alternative living a reactionary life that's just animal that's how animals operate off of stimuli this happens in they don't reason things I'm hungry there's an animal I kill it and eat you know uh I I I'm walking here comes a predator I run and animals everything is about stimuli and and and but but that's not we are the Human animals uh and without the Holy Ghost that's all we are just Peter called us brute Beast so don't stay that let the Holy Spirit come in and make you what you were supposed to be here for see so um you know there's all kinds of advantages we have as human beings but my it's a it's a pitiful life that that does not come to the enlightenment of the word and allow the Lord to live through their lives I'm trying to figure out what all I want to cover today and so so you You' realized then that there is a much higher purpose and that you have a much higher calling you've been called from a higher place to a higher place and that's what that's what John was called at the end of the ages yes the end of chapter 3 the beginning of chapter 4 certainly there's where the Rapture takes place in one sense because we're not looking for an eighth age and we don't need an eighth messenger the messenger we have is Christ in the word and uh but we and we are in a bride's Revival a bride's time a bride's age a Harvest Time amen there's an Endtime sequence to events uh and and and John was certainly called up and the whole is that you're called up into the revealed word because that's what an Open Door represents he had a door opened in heaven and the door is always Christ so it's a revelation of Christ that calls you up spiritually so you can go up naturally when you get called up spiritually the message comes to you and the message is come out of her my people be not a partaker of her sins so that you don't are a partaker of her plagues why and I'm not just talking about the tribulation why would you volunteer to be under her plagues that are affecting her right now and the madness on the streets you don't you say how do I get free of it don't be a part of her Works come out of that come into Christ come up into the revealed word let the light shine on your life change whatever you have to do to change change whatever you have to change to keep Satan from always filling you up and plugging up the conduit it's really that simple Daniel was taken aside to be taught this John was taken aside to be taught this and if you look at what Daniel and John went through when you get taken aside to understand God it's not always a pleasant experience humanly speaking and Jesus never said it would be he never said it would be easy he said it would be worth it see but but ultimately he said take my yoke upon you for my yoke is easy and my burden is light and and and if you feel that it is a burden on you to live like a Christian it's because you're not born again enough said because that you're you're you're contradicting the word it it that there should be a natural innate desire within you to be like God I'm not saying your flesh won't struggle against it and kick and buck and do every kind of other thing and that's why you come to church and that's why you read your Bible remember something as mechanical as instead of reading your Bible one two or three days a week you read it four days and on that fourth day something magic happens remember I gave you that that resource you know I'm GNA tell you something friends I have proven that that's true over the years brother brandham said a real Christian reads their Bible every every day chapter after chapter after chapter now I'm going to tell you something you didn't know I knew you don't do that right amen say how do you know because even I don't do that say Are you ashamed to admit that I am yeah and I know there are some Christians who do open their Bibles every day but I'm I'm trying to make the point friends that sometimes I have found myself allowing business or task or stuff righten and I go my goodness it's 5:30 in the evening I haven't even opened my Bible today and I listen we're humans but let me say it again say it again and say it again this is the greatest resource of strength you have open its Pages go through it chapter after chapter do it in a quiet place do it when nobody's uh busying you right it's work it's effective it works see so to those of you who do read your Bible more than four days a week 5 days a week six days a week and those of you who read it seven days a week God bless you I'm in that club as well I'm only making the point that sometimes I have found myself too careless with that and I I can tell immediately almost immediately within a day I can say my goodness where's my nerves at let me get my Bible let me turn on the tape let me go in my office and get on my knees and pray give your burdens to Jesus Friend oh he's a friend oh my goodness there is nothing so so effective as the presence of God sometimes you can be isn't it true come on humans isn't it true that sometimes we can be so Twisted torn up upset angry whatever is happening the this is happening in the home this is happening on the job this is happening and man you're just about to come apart and then suddenly you'll you you'll read a verse of scripture or you'll hear a song of worship and you'll start to think about the Lord and and it won't even take very long it's just like and then you're gone and your troubles you've hit altitude you've soared above them all friends there's nothing like it oh I invite you live in that upper atmosphere live in those High atmospheres don't let the world and its busyness rob you of that you're entitled to that but Satan though he's forbidden to take it from you will do it if you give him permission see oh my your life afterward friends I'm here to tell you your life afterward your presence Seated on that Throne Matthew 25 when you're seated there with Christ there in the Book of Revelation when the sea gives up its dead and the heavens depart like a scroll and the dead both small and great stand before him and the bride is seated with him on the throne you know we've got a little over 8 8 and a half billion people on the Earth today they estimate that there have been roughly about somewhere between 108 to 110 to7 billion people in the earth since as far back as they can date history uh works for me I don't know but that if that's the number they give but I'm here to tell you something friends when you're Seated on that Throne that's going to demon state to all 110 billion of them uh that you were you were not merely part of the vast numbers of humanity of the World when they see me and you seated there with Christ they're going to realize that we were not just part of the masses and I don't want to be just that I want to be seated on that throne and I want to convince as many people as I can to please come go with me amen Amen brother brandham said it like this and I'm going to have to hurry I'd like to close in about 15 minutes you you good brother brandham says in the church age book of the revelation of Jesus Christ Christ Jesus is our King he's the king of saints right now it's a spiritual Kingdom it is not of this world system even as we are not of this world that's the reason we act different from the world here it is here's the reason our citizenship is in heaven amen listen to this poetry we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth that is beautiful our citizenship is in heaven we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth it causes you to think different it causes you to act different your world view becomes different your motives are different your objectives are different and you know um I I don't want to I don't want to take a a dark side to this but let me just say that if if these kinds of things I can stand up here all day and talk about this but if these things don't appeal to you um then it may not be for you and God won't Force you I I heard some advice given one time to my sister I don't think she'd mind me sharing it she's told it before uh a minister who we both loved had a lot of confidence in and Lisa was struggling she was in college and different things and struggling pulling on her mind raised right and knew knew better than than some of the stuff she was involved in I was there we were all there and and and this Minister had counseled her a number of times but you know how sometimes teenagers are always putting things off they's always putting them off I'll get there some day well you might you're not even guaranteed the rest of this day to say nothing of cashing checks on tomorrow's day you're not even you don't even know if you'll get through this day see your life is just a vapor it just appears for a little while vanishes away see and he just finally one day I thought it was brutal it was brutal it was tough but it did the job it caused her to think correctly that's her testimony and I've seen the evidence of of it and he just said to her sister Lisa look how many times are we going to sit down here and talk about this said listen if you're not going to serve the Lord then eat drink and be merry go for it have the best life you can get all you can do all you can do this will be it for you so live it up if you're not going to serve God and you're not going to make Heaven your home then just go at it as hard as you can and when it's over it's over and that was a brutal you know almost like a slap but it shook her and she thought about that and I thought about my goodness no Lord and that was my conclusion that was her conclusion I hope that's your conclusion no goodness no that's not what I want out of life no sir I want him I want eternal life I want heaven I don't want no no no no take this world and give me Jesus Hallelujah see th this is where we have arrived to friends this is where we have arrived you're but remember you're a free moral agent and God is only offering you an opportunity to live fully as a free moral agent amen the devil's never going to let you live as a free moral agent he won't let you choose that nature of sin won't allow you to you think oh I I need to leave the I need to leave the message so I can go live free you're not that's the opposite of of free that's under the bondage of the God of this evil age you won't get to make any of your decisions he'll drive you to every kind of ungodliness and you won't be able to stop you I'm here to tell you there's only one way you've got to pass from Death to life you got to be reborn rejuvenated Hallelujah let the Holy Ghost come into your life and then you're not just operating perfect Faith you are perfect faith your perfect Faith living in in skin you're lifted up from the death you were born into and called up into a higher life and a higher understanding this is Harvest Time friends that means brother brandham talks about the sound Berry he said once you go past that then it's unlimited this is Harvest time we're in the time of unlimited there is nothing limited that God can't do for you amen if you can believe it and accept it you don't have to be bound as we taught in part two or I think part three about the you're not under the you're under a law of Liberty the law of love you're not under the the Old Law see and so you're under a new law and we found ourselves many of us were were willing to go beyond the camp of our human weakness I just say Lord It's you know they used to uh when when the dust bowl came there they over overworking the land and destroyed all the top soil and then you know they're in the 30s and they the great dust bowl that came across those planes and people were headed to California and they had all their you know the back of their modeles and they had a sign California bust you've seen old pictures like that I'm I'm going to tell you something it's um I I I I just say it's it's it's heaven or bust it's Christ or nothing Hallelujah I'm ready to go beyond my human weaknesses um the ones that I was born with and that's what the devil's afraid of the devil's afraid you'll do that he knows he can't stop you if you do that see so so you have those rights in the holy spirit amen so I I I so when we talk about resisting the devil you know the the devil is always trying to keep you from it to deny those rights to you and but you have the right to rebuke that just like Jesus did just like Michael did disputing over the body of Moses the Lord rebuke thee see and so because you have that right I mean that's where I think we we when we came down to Daniel listen let me just say this as I as I'll go off the air with this and I'll just I'll just pause right here got a lot more to say we'll stop right here Daniel was in a position very much like we are he was captive in a heathen Nation he he was actually worse off than you because not only was he captive in a heathen na in a heathen nation which meant that everything that Nation went through he suffered all the madness of Babylon of Babylon Daniel had to live under that all the craziness of this age of leoa you say Lord you've left us here too long well that's certainly a legitimate feeling but in the plan of God that's impossible there's nothing out of cater nothing out off kilter God knows exactly what he's doing he has us here for a reason we' all like to be home but he's got me here so I just say Lord then I'll keep fighting until I'm not here cuz I'll be here till I'm not so while I'm here I'm going to keep fighting and I but I know that we're at the end of all the ages and Daniel was coming you know near the end Israel wasn't going to be there forever there was coming a day when they would go back and rebuild the Temple amen and Daniel when he saw when Daniel saw the things that you and I would face now he didn't see everything on our streets but what he did see is Beast representations of the political am religious and Demon power that triun of power at the end time he saw religious symbols political symbols and demonic symbols amen and it was very bad and Daniel was very concerned my Lord When shall these things be and it was so it was so amazing because every time the Lord would come to to give him something Daniel would faint and I mean we get like that sometimes sometimes this world you just are almost overwhelmed and then the presence of God comes in Daniel get up on your feet and first he set him up on his knees and he said I I was laying there like my face to the ground I thought Lord how many times have I fell like I'm just steamr I'm just laying there unconscious with my face on the ground but a hand came down upon him and said Daniel sit up you've got to know these things and and he lifted him up to his knees and he's all wobbly and then another place it happens to him again and he said I went down again and there I was and my face to the ground and even the men around me this world around you they don't even hear the voice you're hearing they don't even know what you're experiencing you're crying you love the Lord what's wrong with you they the men that were with me did not didn't hear the voice they didn't see the light but it knocked me to my face and Daniel get up and he said and he finally the angel calls out to the Holy Ghost over the water come said you you've got to you've got to help and he comes and he puts his hand on him Daniel get up and he he said he stood me up on my feet oh I'm going tell you something friends that's what the Lord will come for you that Holy Spirit will stand you back up on your feet I know a crazy world and I know that it's so forboding and the things that we see in Prophecy in the world but just like the Holy Ghost came to Daniel he'll come to you he'll come to your home he'll come to your family he'll stand you up on your feet because with Daniel listen with Daniel he was only told now write it all down okay I've got it you got it I got it okay now Daniel you're done go you'll sleep with your fathers when will this happen that's going to be a sealed up to the end time nobody is going to know that till they know it and and and you're going to sleep with your fathers but I'm here to tell you something friends I don't expect to be one who sleeps with my fathers I'm looking to be alive and remain at the coming of the Lord and I can't be on my face because thou must prophesy we're like Daniel we got to get the word out so get up and stand up and say Lord God put strength in me and let me declare the truth of this message oh let's stand to our feet all over the building say father help me today help me Lord God to be a to be a a a declarer of the word of God for this hour that's what I desire friends I trust that that's what you desire I was I was yesterday or day or two ago I was out on my bike and and I just was talking to the Lord and it's a great time to get alone with God and talk to the Lord and and and and I was just start I thought about all that God has done in this life in this world for me in this message in my family in my home and I said Lord You've followed me all the days of my life you're like David it's like it's like David said I I'll dwell in the house of the Lord forever surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life and I know that that whatever you choose sister debor brother Anthony whoever just play something for me and I know I know that God's hand has been on me do you know that today do you know that the hand of the Lord has watched over you your whole life you're here today and you say no I I just all I did was I got invited somebody we got in the car and drove here no you don't you didn't just do anything the spirit of God leads people and sometimes we don't even know when we're being led and we get four or five steps deep into the leaders ship we turn around and go oh my goodness he was leading me right there I didn't know

studying trying to prepare today it just seemed like I was above and then below and then pulling the lower part to the middle and then the upper part back down and moving stuff around and even standing here preaching it I've just tried to follow the mind of the Holy Spirit but yet in all of it I can see it's you I can see sometimes Lord that the chaos of our lives and we're not even aware Lord we sell ourselves short we miss out on opportunities we come here to the house of God we hear a a sermon like this and it challenges us Lord I trust it does father I trust that it challenges the people at a deep level you've done so much for us Lord don't let us live ungrateful lives like spoiled children with all that you've done and then our lives are not given to you wholly and completely Lord I want to raise up my both hands today say master I'm sorry for every time I ever didn't meet the mark and take the challenge and make the grade that I needed Lord I I'm asking you to help us Lord God help us as an assembly we do we see the insanity of the age that we live in we know these perils and perilous times are all around us Lord and yet we know we have a commission thou must prophesy again to people's tongues and Nations Lord the enemy battles us because we don't always seem coming sometimes he slips in something we thought was harmless Lord there's people standing here right now as soon as I say that they've got something in their mind they know yeah mm yeah that one slipped in on me I didn't know and now it's got a hold Lord I pray you break it I pray that no one should leave here today bound up with any feeds of Life whatever you did for these young people at Camp Lord God multiply it I pray the Holy Spirit would grow it don't let it slack off a prophet said
