TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. As message believers, we have certainly been impacted by these cultural developments. Um, it doesn't seem that we've necessarily followed exactly suit with how the world has done it, but there's been sort of like some, like I said last time, uh, right-wing people aren't setting their feet in stone and saying, "This is what I believe. This is where I stand." There's sort of like the left is going this way and the right is following that way. And I I think I would say as message believers instead of saying this is what the word of God says. I plant my feet here and this is where we go. We've said, "Oh, the world's doing it this way. Okay, they're going left. We'll go this way with them." And there's a there's a there's a great danger like that. I don't know. You you can do whatever you want to do in your own home and your own family, but I want to do my best to follow the word of God and to protect myself and save those save my children from the heartache and the pain that they would go go through should they do it the way the word world is doing it. Obviously, we don't necessarily see a widespread casual dating jumping from person to person. um around the message, but social media has definitely caused a great shift in how things are done. Um maybe not so much somewhat Facebook for some demographics, but most uh demographics, it's Instagram and Snapchat. And th the advent of those things has really brought forth a totally different system in many ways. There seems to be there seems to have been become sort of a phase where you take social media whatever form it is um me messaging how you know I I don't keep up too much with all this stuff but in other words kids are using their phone to get in touch with each other and find out whether they would be interested in each other instead of following doing the order that the word would say to do it. They're trying to bypass that in a private way. And there is emotional attachment taking place outside of the area of protection where God would place that. How would I ever know if I'm interested in them if I don't text them or talk to them on the phone? Logical. You saw them at the youth camp. You saw them at special meetings. You're interested now. Suddenly, they're popping up on your snap Snapchat. So, I'm going to start communicating with them. Okay. Plus, there's also this fear that people have is, well, if I make every boy talk to my dad before we start Snapchatting, it's going to be awkward and uncomfortable. It's supposed to be. It's absolutely 100% supposed to be because this is a absolutely reverent. I don't know about you, I treat my daughters with great reverence because I I want them to be delivered to the young man that God has ordained for them. Don't don't turn too red, girls. I'll just make it general. If if I was a father of girls, I would want to make sure, and I'm sure you would, too, that they were delivered in purity and in righteousness to a young man, having been protected and h having been honored by their father, knowing that this is what they'll demand from the person that they're going to spend their life with. Amen. And it's supposed to be awkward because young men are supposed to take be able to take the risks and do the difficult things and face the challenges. And if the young man is too much of a coward to face the father of a girl that he likes, maybe he's not the right one for you. God bless you. I hope you still love me. as brother Luther would say. And of course, there's this there's become this talking phase. There's a non-serious deciding if you want to take the next step of being in serious courtship. Now, I'll back up um blowing up my time just a little bit, but I'll back up and say, you know, it should be normal amongst youth group for for young people to be friends, boys and girls to be friends, to talk to each other. And a if if a boy and a girl are talking, I would say in a public thing amongst a youth group or a get together at the home, please parents and everybody around, don't be weird and say, "Oh, you're getting married. You looked at a boy and talked to him and now you're getting married. Let's let's stop being dumb." Because when we do that then it makes it then then we you know it's it is funny but at the same time it's serious because you create an an atmosphere where there is a fear to get to know each other in a public place and we have to do it private right why why that's wrong we want them to get to know each other in public in groups this is the proper way of doing it and we're good we should be good with that as parents we have to watch over it we have to use wisdom We have to be prayerful about it. We have to be a part of it. Very critical to be a part of it. And yet, this is the this is the area where in in healthy, positive, good relationships, kids can get to know, do we like each other? Right? And it it it doesn't need to be become this weird exclusive thing until God leads leads a young man down that road. um turning a corner a little bit, what what they're finding now is that basically the norm of meeting someone is not face to face in public. the norm of meeting someone is online, whether it's using dating apps or using social media. And so, it's somebody you might know uh from a public thing, and then you use the internet to make a connection that you're too scared to make face to face. Jenzie, please stop doing that. Stop being scared to talk to people face to face. and parents with Gen Z kids, please make them learn how to talk to people face to face, to adults, to look people in the eye, to be respectful. Force them to do it. If they don't want to put their phone, take their phone and put it in in the safe. Praise the Lord. So, there's a website called internetmatters.org. website founded in 2014 to stutter study internet usage by teens and to help parents increase safety for their children. Says according to teens the best and easiest way to meet and engage with love interest is through their social media accounts. And of course they're saying we're looking into the positive aspects of that. But th this is this is what the development has come to. Online relationships can remove barriers that children may have when meeting for the first time, and it allows those who are shy or socially anxious to develop their social skills in a space where they feel safe to do so. Although using so apps and online platforms can help children maintain relationships, concerns have been raised about teen safety when exploring romantic relationships online. What can seem be seen as harmless? A harmless chat can turn into something harmful. If a child is lacking in critical thinking or is considered vulnerable, it may be harder for them to spot. When a chat with a new friend can put them at risk of grooming or being lured into sending nudes, for example, this is this is a huge thing. We think of human trafficking and we think of it as well that only that only happens like at some gas station and some guy swoops up your kid. That's not what they do at all. And that's not how it works. It's almost always something that they're lured into online. They they they think they're talking to a teenage boy and he loves me. He's sent me this. He's done this for me. He's promised me all of these things. The heart is opened up. And they're like, "Come meet us over here and and we'll do something." Then they willingly go there and step by step they're lured into this lifestyle of prostitution. Think thinking at first that this is love. This is what love is. It's not smash and grab anymore. It is here. I'm giving you something that you really This is how the devil works. I'm giving you something that's really good that you'll really enjoy and really appreciate. Oh wow. This is wonderful. No one's ever talked to me like this. No one ever No one's ever seen me before. I really feel seen by this person that I've never seen before and never met and doesn't know me and is probably a dirty old man. One in five children are happy to have an online only romance. Onethird of 14 to 17 year olds have sent uh sexual photos to someone they like. One-third of young people have started a relationship with someone they met online. Half of 14 to 17 year olds had at some point chatted online about the kinds of um various sexual things uh that they'd like to do with someone they're interested in. This opens young people up to blackmail, getting groomed, and being trafficked for the sex trade. Amen. According to Pew Research, most teens uh do not start the relationship online, but the social media is the main venue for getting it getting it moving. In other words, they might know him face to face, but they use social media because they're too scared to actually talk to him face to face. Let me skip forward a little bit. Even though you could say the majority of the time among young message believers, social media that social media aspect of communication is innocent, but it does add a layer of communication that can seem appropriate and start appropriate and move to a place that isn't appropriate. All right? Because it's done something done in secret. Jeremiah 17:9 says, "The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. Who can know it?" Yes, your sweet little kids. Their hearts are desperately wicked. And so are you. And the Bible says to abstain from all appearance of evil. Brother Brandham says, "Many times I go to houses and there are women standing out there and I go to the house, knock on the door, and a sister would come to the door. Come in, Brother Brandham. If her husband's not there, unless it's a case of sickness and somebody with me, I don't go." And then they call me to a hospital, to the room, say, "Brother Brandham, come over here. I'm sister so and so from so- and so. I'm here at the hotel. I brought my mother along. She's sick. I take my wife If I don't, I take some other brother. See, I don't I I don't think I think it would be all right for me to go in there. But what if somebody's seen me go in there? See, what if somebody seen me do it? That see then the first thing you know, they would say he went in there with that went in there where that woman was. He's chasing after women. That see that would be a thing I shouldn't do. See, should never do anything like that because he put a stumbling block in somebody else's way. See, I don't believe that I would do anything wrong in there. would I would and trust God to go in there no matter what the thing was. I would trust God. But yet, see, I love the Lord well enough till I wouldn't do it. It's a love. It's a love you have. You'll not do it because it's a duty to do it. You do it because you love the Lord. You don't have to do it, but you do it anyhow. We shouldn't put ourselves in a compromising position of being alone with a person of the opposite sex that you're not married to or related to. It leads to the appearance of evil and also can lead to many temptations. It can lead to a friendship that turns into an emotional attachment or even lead to sexual temptation. The standards that govern real life are the standards that govern govern virtual life. Right? How can how can we divide the two and say it's okay to do this this here, but it's not okay to do this here. Well, if that's the case, is it okay to look at pornography online? Then if it's not okay to do do that in real life and online, what about bypassing God's word online? Should we bypass it because we want to get to know somebody? You can do what you want with it, but Amen. I believe that the the the standards of the word of God that govern us in the real world will should govern us govern us in the virtual world. So whatever standards we have for relationships here face to face, same thing that we would do online. And whose job is it to oversee that if you're a young person govern if you've heard the truth, obey the truth. Live it. But parents, it's our duty and job to be the pastors of our children. Amen. We we're the ones that should know what they're doing online, what they're doing on their phone. We should set the standards of what social media is allowed or isn't allowed based on their ages. And we should be consistent about it and use wisdom and oversee everything. Just as you would oversee a relationship between a young man and a young lady, you uh in real life, you do the same thing in virtual life. Amen. this. I hope that makes sense. All right, we're going to close there. That's a That's a good spot to finish. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word. We thank you for your light and your life. We pray that you'd quicken yourself to us. You be glorified among us. We commit ourselves to you. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. [Music]
