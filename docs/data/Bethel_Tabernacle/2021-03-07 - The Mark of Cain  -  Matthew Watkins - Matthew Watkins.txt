[Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] if you have your bible let's go to genesis chapter 11 amen genesis chapter 11. i'd like to just look at something here just maybe for this morning that we were in a conversation some fellowship uh friday evening i think it was and the lord just started to uh put this upon my heart so i thought i'd cover it here today i'd like to speak to you on the mark of cain the mark of cain let's look at genesis chapter 4 and brothers i have a pdf if you have that ready i sent you can just display it and scroll with me amen genesis chapter 4 and we'd just like to begin reading here let's begin at verse seven let's let's actually go back beyond that let's go all the way to verse four and abel he also brought up the first liens of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and his offering but unto cain it is offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen if thou do as well shall thou not be accepted and if thou do is not well send lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shall rule over him and cain talked with his brother abel and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him and the lord said unto cain where is that where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brother's keeper and he said what is thou done the voice of thy brother's blood cryeth unto me from the ground and now are thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand when thou tilt the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shall thou be in the earth and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can bear behold thou has driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from the faith and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain vengeance shall be taken upon him sevenfold and the lord set a mark upon cain lest any finding him should kill him and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden you can be seated this morning we answered the very simple direct question what was the mark that god put upon cain and i don't think we have uh we could speculate and all of us could could uh come up with a different revelated um you know broke down a type or idea that we can have we don't really know not that i'm aware of that we have any specific um uh definition that the bible gives us or the prophet really gives us though he gives us enough and i'd like to look at that here today just for a moment what was this mark and brothers i have that um i have that pdf if you can display that i'd like to look at a few things here that the prophet of god says because i think this ties directly in with the mark of the beast when you say the mark of cain you're referring to the mark of the beast so then we ask the question what is the mark of the beast and if you want to go into the weeds just google that one time and you will find about every definition uh and every idea that people have came up with about what the mark of the beast is there's a lot of conspiracy surrounding it you'll you'll find it today on the internet people constantly putting out something that the government does or some law in congress or something and it's it's always about this mark of the beast i think it's interesting because uh it's upon people's minds today now more than it ever has been before and you could you could kill that side screen if you can um yeah i wouldn't open it in the browser i'd go to the actual finder and then open it in uh and preview i wouldn't open it in the in the in the browser it's going to display that you we don't need it right this second so we look at this uh i have just some slides and we'll read some quotations from the prophet that i i just thought was real important to cover but what's important to understand is that here uh god drives out this wasn't just a specific location as we've said many times before but it's actually being expelled from the presence of god because that's what adam and eve uh were expelled from it wasn't just a garden or a physical location or geographical location but it was from the presence of god that adam and eve are driven from and then cain also says i'll be driven away and i'll be hidden from your face and so they're driven out from the presence of god a place where they had access to all of the spirit of god all of it 100 of it whereas today we just have a portion and we we have access to the presence of god but we get that in uh we're not always living there there's times when we fill the presence of the lord in times when if we'd be honest um at a stoplight in traffic we're not always in that presence of god and so something something will happen to you and then immediately you realize just how close your carnal flesh uh can be amen but but here adam and eve had this constant access always in the presence of the lord you know that's really what eternal life is to know him is life and so he's the source of all life and so there was no death there was no there was no dying there was no uh no degrading no no corrupting there was no law of corruption in human beings at that time but sin brings in a law of corruption and and being driven from the presence of god brings in that law of corruption and so man becomes the bible says in genesis 3 23 you don't have to turn i'll just read it to you therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so man becomes earthbound where he's there is there is there is a a a a a barrier now that wasn't there before there's a curse there that wasn't there before he's possessed when i say earthbound i mean it more than just the soil or the trees or the planet but this this is earth right here your body that you have is part of the earth amen so your your body is part of the earth so now you're bound to five senses you're bound to a carnal nature you're you're bound to carnality that's that's what sin really is a corruptible nature and so the the the the uh you have that ready gideon if you have that just go ahead and display that i want to read these right here so the prophet of god says here he says and remember that we found out that we found without one mistake that the mark of the beast is a mark of apostasy that's really clear the mark of the beast is a mark of apostasy there you go you can just display it full screen and then you can zoom in use the track pad and pinch the zoom there you go up up up more you've got to go a lot until they can see it there you go yep can you see that all right there in the back and then just try to scroll over so that it stays center good job good job and remember that we found without one mistake the mark of the beast is a mark of apostasy that is church members hanging to their churches instead of walking in the light boy that really brings it real simple and really close to home now it's not a microchip right now it's not something they insert in your skin the mark of the beast is a mark of apostasy it's a branding that's what brother branham calls it it's a branding and not not it's it's a sense of it's a it's a sign of ownership listen let's just keep going that is church members hanging to their church instead of walking in the light they reject light and there's nothing left by darkness that's right both catholic and protestant these are just split up in into different quotes here so we'll just read them as as as they come the mark of the beast question mark is to reject the holy ghost a mark of apostasy where do you say the mark of the beast begin now listen here where we just read in the in the garden of eden mark of the beast and the sill of god was performed in the garden of eden aha now paul's looked this way now we have a parallel here a mark of the beast and a mark of the holy ghost they're the same a mark of the beast and the mark of the holy ghost what do we what do what does the bible say grieve not the holy spirit whereby you are sealed and remember the random said that was the seal of the uh uh at the the railroad uh boxes he said he would seal that to give his stamp of approval that it was ready it was packaged and ready so when you're sealed with the holy ghost you're marked by the holy ghost right remember the bible speaks of a separated angel that would come and when the weed the wheat and the tares were growing together and jesus said don't try to separate them now and he said but later the angels will come and separate them and so there was what are they separating them mark and a seal both of them notice what he says here he says where did you say the mark of the beast and the guard of the beat the mark of the beast and the sill of god was performed in the garden of eden that's the very top if you're trying to find that next paragraph now we find out that the first marking of a human being started in genesis 4 15 god marked cain that's where the first mark of the beast was ever put out put on was put on cain he is the beginning of it so what is where did the mark of the beast if you say brother matt where did we find the mark of the beast revelation the book of revelations no you could actually go the complete opposite of that and find it in genesis when where the mark of the beast began was in the beginning in genesis when you have abel whose offering is accepted by revelation and cain whose offering is man-made religion so now you see what god was marking there was a separation there was a difference and we know these were these two boys were twins and the prophet of god says there's always been twins throughout the whole bible two lines two seed lines uh twins he says there's twins born out of every revival so twins born out of every revival ours excluded no not ours excluded but but but there's twins born out of every revival out of this revival there's twins how do you separate them one is going to be into you know all kinds of uh of he of uh heathenism and and uh and rock and roll and no no no they're both very religious both very religious everything all right back there guys good okay um i thought they were trying to get my attention so both very very religious kane as we've learned so many times the brother branham saying he was religious he he just like jacob and esau same exact thing twins uh but one despised the the birthright in other words one had no value of the birthright right y'all awake this morning he says let's just keep reading here he says now we find out the first mark that's where cain he says that's where the first mark of the beast was ever put on was put on cain he is the beginning of it now you say cain having the mark of the beast all right let's notice he said thy seed shall bruise the serpent's head and his head shall bruise thy heel watch the lineage of cain as cain come down become scientist smart men great men owned down like that but the seed of seth as it come down become peasants sheepherders farmers so you see there is notice he speaking of cain went out from the presence of god when he was marked two classes one will have the mark of the beast the other one have the seal of god just like canaan seth in the garden of eden comes to that thing many people has placed it way over into a day that's yet to come someplace in he says someplace it in this day but for myself i believe that it began at the same time the holy spirit fell now as this is a different quote referencing something else here that's what the bible said men of old foreordained to this condemnation to turn the grace of our lord into lasciviousness that's exactly right in jude the third verse of jude you can find it notice all those things proving that there is the mark of the beast that there's where it's at and and what's amazing is when you study the book of jude you get that parallel so clear that that that that twin that false church that false religion that false approach that way of cain is so interwoven and interwound with the with the way of god in so much that that even i'm almost tempted to pull it up and read it but you remember in the book of judy says they are spots in your cheat feast of charity and he says they're in other words they're right in church they're right intermingled with you two seeds cain and abel judas and jesus jacob and esau but it's not a physical not that here's what we can we can deduct for sure it's not a it's not a physical bloodline we're all mixed up and messed up all of us here go to ancestry.com if you don't believe me you can you can't trace yourself back to any one pure bloodline you got all kinds of of peoples and and nationalities all kinds of different things in your in your history and it's not about a physical this isn't it never was about a physical bloodline it's about a spiritual mark remember brother adam says the mark of the beast a sign it says a mark in the forehead and the sign on the hand and he says it wasn't he says what is that mark he says it's not a physical mark he said you're the mark in the head the forehead speaks of your revelation and he said in the mark in the hand is what you'll do about it the action that you'll take and he said because some some will just give up a place to the beast they'll do his work they'll do his will we're going to get to that here in a second but it wasn't about a physical uh bloodline or to trace it back to your physical blood but it was he says there's spots in your feast of charity uh feasting feeding themselves without fear raging waves foaming out of their own shame he says these speak these are he says these be they who separate themselves sensual this is this is going to be too much to not get pull up jude pull up jude i just want to turn there real quickly and have that ready to go right back up pro presenter and pull up jude and let's just read it just a few verses of this in fact i i need to pull it up here for myself so jude is just a wonderful little book and i believe it speaks so much to this and brother branham just reference that let's look at jude chapter one and i'll just we'll just go through some of these look at this separation because remember in jude you have the first church you have that first book of acts holy ghost filled fire breathing works and signs church in acts and under the apostles but now you come to jude right before the new testament goes into the book of revelation and then it's going to end and now you get sort of just a uh a a just a shot in time you get a a screenshot to be able to look and see what what's happening in that first church and he says here for there verse 4 of jude for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ and we'll just move on past this and he says in verse 10 but these speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally as brute beasts in those things they corrupt themselves in those things they know naturally intellectually by rationale by deduction by theology by seminary by schooling what they know intellectually these be they let's read it again they speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally carnally is really all it means what they know by their own carnal nature and what do we see in this age more than ever before people trying to to to worship and serve god and and and create a religion based upon education and not revelation what do you see abel and cain all over again is that clear to see and he says in verse 10 they know naturally as brute beasts and those things they corrupt themselves woe unto them for they've gone in the way of cain interesting he brings up this one figure he could have used anybody else but he uses cane right here they've gone in the way of cain so what do you see producing here again that twin out of every revival interwoven right in the church listen he says and greedily after the bail uh he says and and ran greedy after the air of balaam for a reward and perished in the gang said of course these are spots on your feast of charity when they feast with you without he says feeding themselves without fear clouds air without water carried about of winds trees fruit withers without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots you try to identify this try to try to identify not people but the spirit because people die spirits don't die i said people die you're not going to go back and find these exact people that jude is pointing to he's thinking of specifics you won't find them they're dead but you what you'll find is the same spirit that after they died just jumped on to the next generation and that spirit is still here today and he says they're spots and feasts of charity when they feast defeat himself let's go to 13 raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom reserve the blackness of to whom has reserved the blackness of darkness forever verse 16 these are murmurers complainers walking after their own lusts and their mouth speaketh great swelling words having men's persons in admiration because of advantage and that word advantage actually means skill or eloquence or gift having men's person's an aw admiration boy he just speaks so good what did brother adam tell us about the serpent he was a smooth talker eloquent and he says there he says but beloved but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before the of the apostle of the lord jesus christ how that they told you there should be these people here should be here don't be shocked don't be alarmed don't be surprised they should be yeah and he says that he says but beloved remember the words were spoken before they told you there should be markers last time who shall walk after their own ungodly lust these now here he's going to continue to identify these be they now it's amazing because paul identifies people directly he identifies hymanius and filthus if you if i'm pronouncing that name right and others who he identifies by name but jude isn't going to there's you won't find a name here you just hear him say these be they they are they feed these they these they because as i said it's not people it's spirits and he says these be they who separate themselves then he uses a very interesting word here sensual sensual you know brother brandon talks about cain and abel and he says any and he begins to dramatize the the offering that cain has and the dramatizing the offering that that abel has and it's amazing when you go back and you listen to what the prophet of god says and he says here was cain he just had this beautiful just beautiful pleasing to the eyes very aesthetically pleasing and perfect and had everything just laid out in this garden and all of his flowers and a man all the you imagine what it must have looked like this how he was gifted he was get gifted to with the things of the of the earth of the ground and he says always just oh it's just so wonderful and emotional it's very emotional you know if we're not careful it's good to have an emotional worship for the lord it's good to have an emotional church service good to have an emotional singing emotional preaching but let's be careful that we don't just so become so emotional that we have no substance and so emotional that there's no real meat there's no real life there it's good to have emotion i hope you don't misunderstand me here today in fact i think that's the last thing we need to be preaching on we need more we need more of it we don't have enough of it but let me just say it's not just about an emotional pleasing aesthetically pleasing it's soothing to the ears we don't just need sermons that are just beautiful sermons because the difference between abel and cain was that abel's wasn't so pretty how very different it brother branham says you can hear that the the the screeching sound from that little that little sacrifice he says his cain took the knife and slit the throat of that little animal and he says and then blood began to come down what was it wasn't as emotional wasn't as beautiful wasn't as you know aesthetic to aesthetically pleasing to look upon and made it didn't make everyone very comfortable didn't make you comfortable when i just repeated it but it was acceptable to god by revelation abel offered a more plea more excellent sacrifice than that of king and god had respect unto abel's offering and so now now think of that here when jude put jude back up for me getting in there he says these be they who separate themselves sensual having here's the most important verse here verse 19 jude verse 19. these be they who separate themselves sensual having not the spirit that is the key differentiating mark of denotation there having not the spirit but you now he points to the spirit filled but you beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life what an admonishment after just identifying cain's seed after just identifying the way of cain after just identifying this group sensual having out the spirit and you know and all of all of the beloved and believers are feeling pretty good about themselves right and he says hold on a minute but lest you unless you get a spirit of arrogance or a spirit of of of pride in your own self and he says keep yourself in the love of god keep yourself looking for the mercy not the condemnation not the judgment not just to say all the bunch of devils over there and we got god here and they're all all just worshiping the devil keep yourself in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life and of some have compassion making a difference and others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory i say lord keep me from falling and present me faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy to the only wise god our savior be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and forever amen you can stand to your feet this morning lord we thank you for this teaching this morning didn't cover nearly what we wanted to but we just leave that to you lord i pray father that you would continue to lord just visit us here by your spirit lord in this church service today we ask in jesus name amen
