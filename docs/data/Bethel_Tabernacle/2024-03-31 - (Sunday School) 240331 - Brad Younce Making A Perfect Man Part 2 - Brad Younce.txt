be with the the main service our pastor father when he brings forth the word Lord may you just help us father to do your will we love you in Jesus name amen we're going to read out Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 read about three scriptures there and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the Statue of the fullness of Christ may God has blessings you can have your seats you know for a title it's going to be the making of a perfect man part two you know we know Jesus says and we said this last time we go real quick be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect and that word perfect was brought to its end it's finished it means you don't need nothing else everything you have you've already got you don't need your your you're perfect you're wanting nothing necessary to completeness is anyone here at this point in your life are you perfect are you perfect as god is perfect cuz what Jesus says be ye therefore perfect even as our father in Heaven is perfect I want to be perfect you know you come to church this morning before you came to church you put on your best clothes you looked up you looked in the mirror I have reached Perfection brother Caleb did you do that when you looked in the mirror no we've reached the goal there's an ultimate goal that we're we're trying to attain and that go is what we need to obain to be a stature of a perfect man and that definition again was a stature was quality or a status gained by growth a development or an achievement you know when you first get saved and receive the Holy Ghost you're just a little baby you haven't reached your full potential when you get first get saved you're not a full mature bride we're not what we're supposed to be we're not a full mature as as soon as we get saved you know it's like a baby when it's born you know you mothers you bring it out of the hospital you're sitting there carrying it all that sweet little thing what do you do all right you're born you're a human there's the car go walk in it go walk to the car get it and drive it we're going to Dockside for lunch no the baby has to have milk first he can't have dock side to start out with he's got to have milk so the baby's growing it's a it's a a state of growth but you're holding that baby you're going to have to take care of that baby you're going to have to nurture that baby so it's what God's doing to us when we first get saved he nurtures us he sits in Hope Us in his arms you know when you first get saved everything is so easy amen you know what I'm talking about you know that song bring back to New Again you remember how it was you first got saved you listen to every tape you could you read every every book of the Bible you prayed all the time what happened Lord sometimes I want to bring back the new again Lord bring back that feeling that feeling of newness not back we don't want to go back to being a baby in the word but we want that newness that fullness that building I'm talking about a perfect body but you're not going to put that baby down and say all right go walk to the car no you're going to carry that baby to the car that's what happens when we become born again you're like a baby we don't become a full mature bride as soon as we're born again you know you'll look at look at things new when you first get saved you're looking at things it's all new oh man predestination that's a new thing it's like a baby you watch your baby they're all the time looking around and they'll find something they'll sit and stare at it trying to figure out what it is don't look in that light because you can't see nothing I can't even see what I got wrote down here that's what happens when you get born again remember how it used to be when you first got saved but you're carrying this little baby then all of a sudden they're grown up and that sweet little baby has turned into Jackson it's grown it's a man stature a full grown adult of full age a mature bride the making of a perfect man how do we get there I'm going to tell you God has a have the image he has to have an image that he's going to produce it's not going to be brother Brown's image it's not going to be brother Jason's or some great man he's going to be in the image of almighty God God wants us to be perfect so what does he do he don't choose a moral man he chooses one person that was perfect and that was a Jesus Christ that's who who the image were be if God uses a man it'll be a mess but God wants us to be perfect so what does he do so what did he do he came down says I'm going to have have a body born of a virgin I'm going to go to the Cross I'm going to be beaten I'm going to take these Stripes I'm going to die I'm going to go to hell take my take your sins to Hell he's going to raise again on the third day that's the image of a perfect man is Jesus Christ but this image won't come easy making this image won't be easy you can't just say I've got the Holy Ghost I've reached Perfection God says no you haven't now that I've got your soul sealed it's time for testing there's going to be testing and trials that's going to come with it there's going to be molding and beatings we don't like that part of it do we amen BR says you know in the o old time when they used to make gold before they had a smelter to burn it out they used to beat the goat out they beat out the sludge the the iron and the copper and the stuff out they just keep beating and they'll turn it over and keep beating it you said the Indians do that now beating the gold and they beat it you know how they could tell that the iron was out of it and all the dirt and stuff and the Dres out of it when the one that was beating it could see his own reflection like a mirror in it it was clean and clear enough that it reflected the beater that's what God does he takes this gold that he's found in the earth and he beats it by the Holy Spirit turning it over and over and over and beating it until he can see his own reflection and that's what we're supposed to do to reflect the Son of God God look look at me and see yourself that's the making of a perfect man of second Peter chapter 1 verse three according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us from to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great more than great Beyond Great the greatest we can't receive no greater our minds can't even comprehend that whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises we know what precious is it's valuable it's costly esteemed beloved honorable most precious precious promises that by these ye might be partakers partakers which is a partner your associate you're a companion you're a share in everything because we heard brother Jason talk about Wednesday night he says the king in the old days will say I'll give you half of my kingdom it was just half his kingdom he was a share of all of the Kingdom so it's what God has done to us he has given what's you know the king says what's mine is yours you know Sarah always goes around says what's hers is hers and what's yours is mine so everything I have Sarah's got everything God's got it's yours amen partakers you're a partner all that God has it youres we are partakers of God's divine nature and all that he has belongs to us so ye might be partakers of divine nature the nature of God haven't escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust we have escaped the corruption we have permission to escape you know when you're a prisoner you go to jail you ain't getting out they try they try to get out but most the time they ually get caught sometimes they'll get away but we have permission for to break our chains to escape this world of corruption then when you do all of that then you will become part partners with that divine nature and besides this given all diligence speed eagerness be Earnest you need it haste and besides all this give diligence add to your faith add to your faith so he's not saying take your faith and add it to something you got to start somewhere you got to start with your faith your faith is a persuasion a Reliance upon Christ for salvation it's your belief it's your belief in God and and now Faith and Hebrews 11 says faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen you know we can't even please God without faith that's what it says in Hebrews 11 but without faith it is impossible to to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that Dil ently seek him there's that word again diligent because faith is a foundation you know there's a process when you go build a house you just don't get a piece of property and see a nice piece of land and throw your a wall on it well Travis it's going to fall over you got to put a foundation in so when when you're building this statue of perfect man you can't say I want brotherly kindness first that seems to be easy I can be kind to to people no you got to start Foundation why is the foundation so big it's got to hold up this man so you got to have perfect Faith the faith of God not not our human faith our human faith that gets us in trouble but we got to have the faith of God you heard that song have faith in God have faith of God so there's there's a process you can't say I'm going to get brother kindness first there's there's an easy one there's an order to build this house you got to put the foundation in first because the house won't stand there's an order we need this foundation and Christ is that foundation so besides this giv all diligence add to your faith so once you got faith you got to add something to it when you get a foundation to the house you just say there's my concrete I'm moving in it's not ready there's things you have to do so you got to put the walls up so you got to get virtue what's virtue you got to have the same virtue that Christ has it's his power you know when Jesus was walking by in the crowd and this woman with the issue of blood reached out and touched the him of His Garment Jesus stops say somebody touch me cuz I felt virtue leave me do we have that kind of virtue when somebody else is in need that they can come to you and you won't sit and make fun of them and drag them down but they can actually draw the strength from you draw strength strength from you amen Jesus says virtue has left me the woman took of his strength hallelujah or do we just look at somebody I don't have time for you but do we have strength that somebody can actually be around you and they leave a better person they said man I I was around I was around brother Travis and when the time I left I was walking on clouds amen Travis has that effect on people if you had talked to Travis talk to him for a while you'll leave our feeling strength that's the virtue that's the virtue you need and add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge know what you're talking about you know what you believe in you got to believe every word knowledge is saying Amen to every word not just the parts that we love but the parts that hurts us some of the parts that cuts us deep that molds us so add to your knowledge add to your knowledge free me from alcohol that ain't what it said Temperance that a't get yourself free from alcohol you should have already been free from alcosol when you got saved Hallelujah I'm getting rid of drinking that's not it you're going to add self-control that's what Temperance is temperance is self-control you don't fly off the handle when somebody pulls out in front of you y temper somebody says something about you you want to get at them let me at them oo Temperance have the temperance of God what do you do when somebody somebody pull out in front of you put on your brakes God bless you preaching to me boy somebody gets your seat you come to church I've been sitting in that seat for years and these people move in and take my chair Temperance God's temperance it's like when he was being beat and that beard plucked out and that whip Bea in his back when he was nailed to the cross he didn't say a word can we do that can we honestly say when people are sitting talking about you or saying awful things and you know it's not true can we just stand there and not say a word amen Temperance temperance and to Temperance patience Lord I want patience and I want it now how many prayed for patience lately you pray for patience you're going to get tested I believe that's the that's the one you get tested on the most is our patience I'm a pretty patient man till I get behind the wheel of a vehicle and then I lose it cuz everybody on the road idiots but me patience God help me patience with each other when somebody does you wrong you got patience for them Lord forgive them they don't know what they do whoa where that where we hear that before when Jesus was on the cross forgive them Lord for they know not what they do he has patience and to your patience godliness amen Pi piety you're devoted to this you have a reverence you're devout it's your duty you're obedient is Holiness is to be like God and to Godless brotherly kindness love of your brothers and sisters kind to one another not just the people you like but those that done you wrong you be kind to amen so you got to add all these together they stick together BR says talk about Jesus he had a gift he knowed all things for in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily they had even seen him perform Miracles by telling people what was wrong with them and so forth they put a rag around his head like that around his eyes and hit him with a stick and said prophesy and tell us who hit you we'll believe you see he had Temperance if you got it like that add it to your faith if you still blow up and Sass and fuss and stew and carry on uhhuh you ain't got it you can't add that cause it won't add it won't vulcanize right amen vulcanize is to treat with so and heat imparting strength and greater elasticity and durability vulcanize you know it sounds like something from Star Trek that's the explation behind this word has more to do with ancient mythology than it does with science fiction it evolved from heating rubber is where this word come from in a combination with sulfur they have they even named it after the Roman god Vulcan oo who was a god of fire and skills that use fire such as metal working so when Charles goodwi goodear discovered that high heat would result in stronger rubber he called the process vulcanization after the god of fire so high heat what's it do it vulcanizers you so if you get high heat you add to your faith virtue it sticks you add your Temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness it sticks it's vulcanized says you can't take a piece of rubber you know and vulcanize to a piece of iron it just won't work it's got to be flexible just like the rubber is so when your faith and your Temperance becomes the same kind of Holy Ghost Temperance that he had that it will vulcanize with him you you're added to it so when your virtue is like his add to it when your knowledge is like his knowledge I come to do thy will oh God see with the father's word he defeated every devil heavens and earth will pass away but the word will not when you're that kind of knowledge it'll vulcanize with your faith and with the right kind of temperance like he had it'll vulcanize if you haven't just a man-made halfway SED up belief or temperance oh I ought to slap him but maybe I better not cuz they might put my name in the paper that ain't that kind of temper he's talking about don't try to add that it won't work but when you can really with a sweetness of your heart forgive every man hold your peace and let it be gone it'll voize and you can add to that to your faith even one time he says when that Rebellion bunch of people had such impatience they caused Moses to do something was wrong but yet when it come to a showdown God sick of their action he said separate yourself Moses and I'll kill the whole bunch and start over he throwed himself in the breach talk about Moses and said God don't do that patience with the people that was rebelling against him and I wonder if we could do that if you can't don't try to build on this cause it don't change you know that's the way the first one was vulcanized into this that's the way every one of them has to be vulcanized and if you don't you don't come to that statue stature of the dwelling place of the Living God if you haven't got patience patience one with another all right so to your brotherly kindness this is a Capstone this this is the Capstone this is where the perfect man is completed here comes the Capstone that finishes up this perfect man charity love it's not human love human love can fail amen That Kind of Love Changes it doesn't last forever but this love is a gape love that this is God himself coming down to cap off this perfect man charity is a gape love this definition a love feast or a goapa feast is a fellowship that's what that means a fellowship meal that's what we do when God comes and caps us we're have communion with God fellowship with God verse eight for if in these things be in you and abound they make that you should neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off but wherefore rather Brethren give diligence make haste to make your calling this word make has a lot of definitions but there's one that stuck out to me lighten the ship you know what happens when they lighten the ship the ship's loaded down the cargo and it's going into storms and the the the water's filling up they're sinking says we got to get rid of some things so they start throwing out the old temper they all patience they all human Faith they start thowing they're start Lighting in the ship Hallelujah they got rid of all these things that keep them from staying above water they were lightning the ship amen so make yourself wherefore Brethren make your calling an election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fail amen I like this last verse right here for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I want to read I want to read that section out the NLT they should have it by his divine power God has given us everything we need for a Godly life amen we have received all of this by coming to know him the one who called us to himself by means of His Marvelous glory and Excellency and because of his glory and Excellence he has given us great and precious promises these are the promises that enable you to share his divine nature and escape the world's corruption caused by human Desires in view of all this make every effort to respond to God's promises supplement your faith with a generous provision of moral excellence and moral Excellence with knowledge and knowledge with self-control and self-control with patient endurance and with patient endurance godliness and godliness with brotherly affection and brotherly affection with love for everyone the more you grow like this the more productive and useful you will be in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus but those who fa fail to develop in this way are shortsighted or blind forgetting that they have been cleansed from their old sins so dear brothers and sisters work hard to prove that ye are really are among those God has called and chosen do these things and you will never fall away and then God will give you a grand entrance into his eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I one final quote this is my Easter message if we want to be in that Resurrection if you die they'll take the blood out of a man you take the blood out of a man he's gone the only thing you can do is put another Blood back in him if he is going to live again you took his blood out so now we we' put the blood of Jesus Christ Inc and that's what brings the faith of Jesus Christ the virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus Christ the godliness of Jesus Christ the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ the love of God which is Jesus Christ he is the head that controls you and your feet are the foundation Faith controlled by the head there you are there is the perfect man of God when he possesses those virtues amen amen
