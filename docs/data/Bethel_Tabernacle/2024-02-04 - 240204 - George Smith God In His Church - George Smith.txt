stay resting most of the week recover uh wasn't going to miss today for anything amen so we're happy to have brother George he's a friend of our family for many many years since I was a boy probably seven eight years old first time I ever met him amen praise the Lord and we're happy to have him uh with us today brother George is unique in the sense that he really is uh at this point um you know Paul spoke about those on the mount there above 500 Paul said of which many are still alive to this day to give a living testimony amen and brother George is really with the passing of brother Billy Paul he's the last one to have an adult's memory I realiz Brother Joseph was a small boy but wouldn't be exactly the same he even uh has admitted to having very few memories but brother George was right there amen with the family as an adult one of the last uh living people that can testify what it was like we had him wed uh Friday night with with the youth we streamed that uh around the world we had a lot of live connections and by the next morning it was a couple of above a couple thousand people were archiving that so we appreciate the Lord loaning us his servant today amen amen I want you just to give him your undivided attention a wonderful brother with a just a wonderful perfect Spirit we love him loved him for many years amen so let's sing that again brother Anthony he's my Lord amen Let's uh let's just slow it down just a little bit I want a little bit more of a flow to it oh he's my [Music] Lord there is no one who can oh who can call the storm of light my my my he gives rest oh he giv rest to the wey brains new Li to the Hopeless there's no doubt no doubt about it about it he my Lord one more time friends let's raise our hands all over the building sing it to Jesus he my Lord oh you're our Lord today Father there is [Music] no the storms of life like my my Lord he gives rest to the wey and new life to the hopess there's no doubt I about it he's my Lord let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your mercy to us today we thank you Lord that you brought each one into the house of prayer and Lord The Empty Chairs never scare me what we're concerned about is that each one that's here may take something home with them to help them along the way thank you Lord for each one we thank you for the invitation we just pray that your presence would be here now as we go into your word help us we ask in Jesus name amen you may be seated it's good to be here on the coast again it's always been my opinion that everything works better sea level except when there's a storm coming you better go go farther away but um I um have been planning a long time to come here there will be no more music yeah you're safe now um and so it just worked around to this time uh brother Jason has invited me many times many people wonder who are you well I'm your friend I'm your brother and when you get in if you arrive to Heaven first you watch for me I'll be there someplace yeah look around and so uh what I do is I'm a representative of a mighty message I've been in there this since 1963 long before many of you was even born and so for the last 50 years I've been ministering the word both in English and Spanish and it's only uh 17 minutes to 12 and church doesn't start over brother Samuel's this evening till 5: so we might be here a while if I see people living yeah we're going to lock the doors but um in the process of all this I've been translating the message into Spanish uh and that's what a lot of people throughout the entire Spanish speaking world are feasting on and studying is the the message in their language if this message came in French you wouldn't be sitting here putting up with the translation because Americans aren't built for that no you would stay in the Baptist Church or whatever where they speak your language but um the people are anxious they're hungry for the word so they you know they listen and um so there's three reasons that I'm here today one is because brother Jason's invited me which I'm thankful and that's good because we've been friends from I mean he was about so tall and um so somehow we've been friends all these years and so number two is that there's time slot that we could actually be here but number three is the fact that um you know God deals in dreams and some are good and some are not so good but you know God deals in dreams I don't do a lot of dreaming when I dream it's all disappears by the time I get coffee hot you know but um other people dream then they tell me hey this is what happened so um several months ago a brother friend of mine called me and said man I had this dream last night and he said I was in brother brandom's um living room there in Jeffersonville like like a fly on the wall watching everything he said now you and Rebecca were sitting by the fireplace and over here in these chairs was brother Neville and sister brandham they were just talking and so they were talking about current things you know and so directly brother Neville got up to leave so he's over by the door and sister brand goes over to see him out and then they said uh Rebecca come over here with us so when you put put it all on paper brother eille died in 74 and sister Bram left in 81 and Rebecca died in ' 06 so they're in this other dimension and so they looked back at me and they said you keep doing what you're doing so that was a great consolation because I do have a few people out there that don't like what I'm doing but that doesn't matter I'm here to please God follow his word and press forward okay so this morning we're going to look into into the book of Acts you keep your Bible handy because it's going to come in real necessary and um we want to try our best to make the word real to you now we're not going to spoon feed you every verse of the Bible it's your job to go in and read it for yourself because as we gave the uh youth on Friday night I was asked the question well how do we how do we help the youth and so forth well it's real simple um there's four steps and this would be good for every one of you from the guy here that's not paying attention to good yeah you I know who you are um first you read one chapter out of your Bible now these are minimums go farther one chapter out of your Bible every day you read one page out of the church age book every day you listen to at least 20 minutes of God's prophet got it so far three simple steps and you pray all the time especially when you're in traffic when the bridge is up and all that kind of stuff you have time to pray so you you follow those four steps you will be a better Christian the church will be ahead and the pastor won't have so much work I like that because what happens you come in here all flustered because you argued on the way to church and there was a red light and the coffee was cold all these problems and you come in here and with a couple songs you think you're going to get settled down no it takes a little more than that you got to get ready okay and so in the process of all that you will stay balanced and that's why I carry this level with me first we check it out see if the pulpits level yeah perfect God sometimes it's not we got to start over but that's so that you'll remember to stay level because things happen to put you out of out of level you know these boats out here they got to they got to stay level if they can you know so the people we're going to talk about here in the book of Acts today uh these people all had trials they were they were in the first church we're here at the end and there's been trials all along but we go back into the book of Acts to see where it began how how this Foundation started to help you like Paul said this stuff is here for your admonition upon whom the ends of the world have come which it wasn't then it's now we're the ones that on whom the ends of the world came and so so they had relatives like we have and um ministers preached to mixed crowds now our Prophet said that in every congregation there's three kinds of Believers I'm not spiritual enough to know who you are you know who you are don't worry about who your neighbor is who are you and when we get over here at lunch and you start complaining about a b and c and the bald preacher and so forth we'll know which one you are you know but um only in heaven will there be no make Believers or unbelievers the Lord as long as we're here they're going to be around and you got to have enough spirituality to get through it you see and so these people we're going to talk about here in the book of Acts someone to prison prison is not something that Believers don't know about yeah they know about prison and uh they were mainly uh persecuted for employing the name of Jesus Christ people weren't mad because somebody was healed because of this and that and the other no just don't use that name anything you want to do just don't use that name and that's been the problem all along even today down here at the you know next Church they can't baptize in the name you know it's just a problem so um you you also find out when you read through the book of Acts that nobody employed the red-letter words of Jesus Christ from Matthew 28:19 he just told him a few days ago this is what you're going to do you're going to go make make disciples and you're going to baptize them in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost oh that was named singular well that didn't dawn on right then you know to a lot of people so what these people did they they heard what he said and they weren't repeating his words all through the book of Acts you don't find any Red Letters uh to where he they were repeating what he said yeah Jesus said you're wrong because I heard it right no they were preaching the word because they were moving out into the deep Waters of Revelation of Jesus words you see and so we may face persecutions we probably will but it won't be for a split nail no it'll probably be for genuinely genuinely suffering for the name of our Lord so if we look at chapter 6 and verse one it says and in those days now we've already covered five chapters it's your job this week to go read those and see what all happen there but in those days when the number number of the disciples was multiplied so it wasn't just added to a couple here and a couple there no multiply means you know increase uh they multiplied there arose murmurings of the grecians against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily Administration that means that there were some disputes came up among the people in the church like this uh about some of the widows not receiving proper attention now it doesn't say discrimination but you know that's the word we use today well we feel left out you didn't give us enough and so forth we see they needed balance they they were waffling you know and there were the Native born Jews those Jews that immigrated uh from other countries were also there and the widows in particular depended on assistance from the church just a few dollars to help them get the next week you know so the apostles had to Institute Church order which is simply practical ideas for current situations they had no Bible for this but it was a problem today we got to deal with it you know now these assistants to the ministry had to have certain qualifications look here in verse three says look amongst you and um look for uh those that of honest report full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business they needed help in the Daily Business that's going on yeah now if yall behave and stay awake we're going to go to lunch after a while I already know there's at least one dish that's good over there I don't know about the rest of it but somebody had to cook it somebody had to bring it somebody has to clean up the mess well Pastor can't be know all that he's got people well that was what's happening back here they were they had more important things to do so they put these people over that business and their first assignment was social work now you might think this is kind of simple but it's Bible and you would do good to follow those four steps read your Bible our Prophet said over 200 times back to the word so it's not just a suggestion right and so they were going to do social work something that was commonly left for the women serving meals and so forth and some of these men graduated on to very active Ministry of the word now the disciples were growing uh the number was growing very rapidly in chapter 1 verse1 15 there was only 120 Believers Amen in the upper room hiding for fear from the Jews because Jesus told them y'all need to go over there and stay until he didn't give them ABC is going to happen you'll know when it happens yes amen but like brother Jason just quoted the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 15 over 500 saw him Ascend now 500 minus 120 that 76% didn't make it to the upper room only 24% made it there interesting so there's the 120 then in verse 41 of chapter 2 after a very brief preaching by Peter 3,000 were added to the church on the first gospel meeting now when I get to heaven you might notice me looking for Peter and I'm going to find Peter and I'm going to ask him if I'm still in my right mind now Peter with all due respect where did baptize 3,000 people there's no River and there's no Lake in Jerusalem H but it happened okay then in verse 47 of chapter 2 added to the church daily such as should be saved predestination it wasn't you know the gospel isn't for everybody all the people on this street ought to be in church but they're not because God's not in their heart in the first place so it's only for believers so they were added daily in chapter 4:4 about 5,000 men and just not just men here today there were women and there were children and they had no microphone how they do all that kind of stuff very interesting and so it could have been as many as 20,000 joined the church that day you know in chapter 5:14 and the Believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes of men and women so this thing is growing we're only in chapter 6 and in chapter 6 and verse 7 it says says and the word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priests were obedient to the truth ah these are the guys that could read because they didn't have education like we have so the priests could read they've read all the Old Testament they knew all the Promises by heart but here it was coming into full bloom it's one thing to buy go over here and buy a rose bush but when it comes into bloom then we'll know if the sticker is right or not if it's white or red or what whatever so it's coming into bloom and they're they're paying attention and so now they're seeing the manifestation um of the word that they had memorized okay with me so far are you going to read the book of Acts this week carefully and we have the we have the added benefit that we have a Scofield bible and there's all these little notes in the middle and references that you need to trace down and get the full picture now if you study at all you'll know that Dr scoffield was a lawyer and he had the Bible but he saw that hey there's more to this so he got busy studying no computer thank you pencil and paper only and a few helpers and they worked all this out like a puzzle and it was all finished by January 1 1909 yeah and so here it is in our hands that we can we can study it and so we're very thankful but now in verse 8 of chapter 6 it says uh and Steven it's one of the seven up here in the early part of part of the chapter and Steven full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles amongst the people so here he is a man of Faith Holy Ghost had a great ministry of um wonders and miracles and he actually became the church's first martyr now every Revival produces twins and you're going to hear maybe some new things here but it's mostly what you've already heard before because we're not here to bring you no shortcuts or because I was God you know God's Prophet son and all that I've got a shortcut over here no we got to come back to the word okay so every Revival produces Twins and most of the Believers back then Lov Stephen he was used of God to minister the word you know in uh the word in great Miracles and so forth but there was a few people those kind of oddballs there that that um they they arose to dispute that means to argue with the man of God now as a word of encouragement for brother Jason and the other ministers everybody we preach to isn't a born again red-hot believer we got all kinds of people in the audience amen and God puts those certain people there for Jason's Perfection yeah you can't run them off you can't kill them you can't say Hey brother Tim take these people no they're there for your Perfection so just smile and move forward so that's what he was dealing with he had these people they were arguing with him and so forth and in verse 10 when they couldn't out argue because he was wise too God was with him verse 10 and when they were not able to resist or you know the wisdom and spirit of which he spake then they suborned that means they paid money under the table yeah this is Old English but it's real they uh they paid money to men and they said now we have heard him speak Blasphemous words against Moses and against God no he didn't that's a lie it's a misinterpretation of the facts you see and so they were paid a bribe and So based on these allegations which were false then the religious police came along and they grabbed him and then brought him before the religious Council and those guys also set up false Witnesses and they didn't even agree There Was You Know confusion there amen and so they were bringing confusion confusing accusations by repeating misquotations how much trouble have we seen in our short lifetime of people that use just a little piece of the truth and we got a whole storm because they're not honest enough to tell the whole story well anyway so um you know little pieces of the message in the wrong order misplaced out of Harmony look at verse 13 and they set up false Witnesses which said this man ceases not to speak Blasphemous words against this holy place in the law for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the Customs which Moses delivered unto us well um they're partly right but it's not the whole story and all that sat in the council so here's here's Steven standing there all the council which was the most important people on the Earth we didn't believe it just ask them they had all the arrogancy everything go with it and here's all these important people and um all that sat in the council looking steadfastly on Steven saw his face as it had been the face of an Angel well if that's true why weren't they on their knees worshiping God because they were filled with hate amen the same thing that's going on in the Middle East right now the Israeli people have only brought peace and prosperity to the region but these other people being from the seed of you know the wrong one they just want to kill they want to push him into the ocean like they never existed they've been going on for centuries but God's eyes are always on the Jews okay it's another subject so he looked like an angel in verse one of7 then said the high priest uh sir are these things true that they're saying about you so he gives the microphone to Stephen H I hope you got a lunch because this last a while it said um and he said men and Brethren um and Father's Heart the god of Glory appeared unto our Father Abraham so he starts into a a long dialogue here it goes into the deep water it was God's way of refocusing the attention of the Believers away from Jerusalem didn't all happen here here we are but it happened out there and so his eloquent history lesson makes four major points you can study this later Point number one 2-8 is the founding of the Hebrew Nation did not occur right here in Jerusalem no out m Mesopotamia all about Abraham so forth part number two 9 through 37 all about the Patriarchs see this is just history that oh yeah yeah you're right okay I'll all agree and so forth you know so all about Patriarchs Moses liberation of God's people didn't occur here in Jerusalem out in other places Egypt the Red Sea the Wilderness uh part three is verse 38 the law was not given in Jerusalem but out in the desert all of this is true then he lets the hammer down verse 39 through 50 all about the idolatry of the Hebrews out in the desert yeah the building of the Temple look at verse 47 for example where's it that here verse 47 of chapter 7 says here but Solomon built him a house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made of hands as saith the prophet you know get serious people Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol and what house will you build me sayith the Lord or what is the place of my rest ha not my hand made all these things and so God doesn't just live in this building no he's he's here because you're here you brought him you know it was just four walls before he got here this morning you know and so um and then verse 51 says here he's stiff necked and now he's getting serious all this is true everybody could agree but now we get to the main point ye stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers so do you which of the prophets have not the fathers persecuted and they have slain them which showed before the coming of the just one of whom you have now been the betrayers and the murderers y all did it who have received the law by disposition of angels and have not been able to keep it so he gave them a real real Stern blast and uh this view of History by Revelation only brought to a real boil the growing conflict between the religious movement that was starting and the city fathers right it was already going but it just brought it up verse 54 and when they heard these things they were happy and took up a missionary offering no they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they nashed on him with their teeth we're going to get this guy and he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly yeah right through the roof looked into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God huh how about that and he said behold I see the heavens opened I see the son of man standing at the right hand of God and they cried out with all the louder voice and stopped their ears and they ran upon him in one Accord boy we're going to grab this guy we're going to squeeze the life out of him and they cast him out of the city and they stoned him and the w Witnesses laid their clothes at a young man's feet H whose name was Saul and they stoned Steven calling upon God and saying Stephen is saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit and he kneel down fell to his knees and cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said thus he fell asleep first martyr of the new movement and so concludes the third persecution you can read the other three um the other two before that so the death of a deacon the first martyr Christians are not foreigners to persecution to jail to problems we're going to have them but we got a promise of something better coming yes so right here is the first mention of our friend Saul he was young he was in training he didn't throw any Stones he was just watching over the stuff while they did the work you know so um he witnessed the death of Steven the first martyr he was probably too young to participate but he was a Pharisee in training that wasn't a six-month course no he didn't throw rocks but um what they hated what what was what was the problem just because he said a few words they didn't like no the problem was that the persecutors hated the manifestation of God's word in present tense that's always been the problem brother br's whole Ministry was to declare he's here all these promises that come to pass right now and that's what we're saying today all this back here it's real we're leaving soon you see and that's what the problem was back then sure historical find quote all you want historically but we're not going to put up with any fulfillment or manifestation of the truth you see so when when we see that the truth is preached and then we see that people don't pay attention they just keep going on well they're classified something other than real Believers because they're not paying attention not with program you know so um the um uh this whole idea just say what he said don't start don't don't temp me because I've been listening for over 50 years also and you come up with that nonsense okay he also said this and this and this and this you're out you know so uh they want to quote it they want to manifest it w still going onow so we've got to have balance what are you going to do with with the fact it says right here there was 120 in the upper room and then William random comes along as a man I knew him and he said there was 150 in one place well let's see oh there's 120 he was human amen have you made any mistakes preaching brother Jason a few yeah a few me too I mean beyond the curtain of time the angel says and you're going to be judged for what you said he didn't start biting his finger finger nails and oh man I got to go back no he just said about Paul well he's going to be judged too well then no problem because if Paul gets in with his people I get in because I preached what Paul preached and we all said we're depending on that it's not so important about these little details and how many was in the upper room but you preach what Paul preached okay so the Pharisees which was you know Paul and them it was the religious Elite of Judaism the people that did believe in the resurrection they believed in the Supernatural and they were very self-righteous now there probably nobody like that down here in this low land but where I come from there's a lot of self-righteous people you know and so and they were the only ones who were really right I mean a lot of people could quote it and put it in order but they were the only ones that you know knew how to do it and so um uh Revelation was the last thing on their mind forget that everything had to be letter perfect and today we call them legalists now the Sadducees were also very important religious people at the time they denied Supernatural they denied Angels especially Resurrection they were the religious rationalists of the time they reasoned and rationalized and they argued over there in Israel because I've been there many times I got a lot of friends and they say when two Jews are arguing there's at least three opinions it's not just mine versus your you know it's serious so in chapter 8 and verse one it says and Saul was consenting unto his death it's just a continuation of verse of chapter 7 and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria except the apostles now why do you think that is it's because God speaks something and then he knows how he's going to bring it to pass pass now he said over in in chapter 1 you you're all going to be my Witnesses right here in Jerusalem or in Judea over Samaria and un the uttermost part of the earth even to those low Islands over there in South Carolina it had to come to pass so so because of this persecution because the Deacon got killed well they thought man we got to we got to do something we got to raise our family somewhere place else so they they started moving started going out in fulfillment to fulfill those words you see yes amen and so with each persecution the plan came into sharper focus and this was several years since Acts chapter 1 and everybody was still you know huddled at Jerusalem and it took persecution to move the Lord's people into action just like right here it's just going to take a little bit of pressure to get you serious you know and I'm not trying to scare you but it's facts you know I mean I I used to know the short piano player a long time ago but see God pinched him and he had to move and same with all of us we we made some decisions you know and so um Pharisees Saul was one of the main troublemakers instigators and bringing persecution on the early church look at verse three of chapter 8 as for Saul he made Havoc of the church entering into every house and hailing men and women committed them to prison so they were going house to house just like some of the so-called missionaries today yeah now these so-called Jehovah's Witness that is the most fake thing there is because for the last 2,000 years they've been calling him Jesus Christ so you guys aren't nearly old enough to be a witness and if he was if you were one of his Witnesses you might dress a little different you know so they don't count but they go house to house just like they were doing here and so uh in in in Saul's own words he confesses yeah I made Havoc of the church Havoc means to uh bring trouble confusion so forth but guess what God is not the author of confusion if you feel confused here well you need to go home read your Bible and come back this is where there's peace this is where we believe all the word all the word comes in sections comes in times and God has a us here in this last time so when you see something confusing and by the way St off the internet do yourself a favor and the pastor a favor don't go trying to argue with those clowns because they don't know what they're talking about and you're just going to get yourself in trouble so where there's confusion go the other way you're not going to win there's too many and they're devil possessed it's not God okay so much for that but you see the death of the death of Judas is scariot their church leaders got together and they looked for a man that might be able to fill the position okay this man paids ties uh he's got a you know spotless Life we'll choose him his name was Mias okay but we don't get much more out of him he was kind of around there for a while God had a different idea brother Bram says if it had been up to the Americans to choose the replacement we would have never chose Paul no but God says don't touch him he's my man now he let him go through some stuff but he chose him so what did he choose a short hook noosed sarcastic high-tempered Jew I mean how much wor can it get you know and um he was the one that was dragging converts into court if they even looked if they saw a little picture of a fish on the wall you're one of them let's go to and kill them and by the way there's a film that was in the theaters a few years ago you might have seen it I I took some people to the theater that had never stepped foot in a theater they were so holy but it's called Paul Apostle of Jesus Christ you can buy it online excellent film right out of the Bible okay and so um they were they were watching for people that were part of this new way because they had it all figured out it's going to happen this and this and this and this anything different is wrong and Paul was one of these guys he the traditions of the fathers it's right and let's give him a break 400 years gone by with no Prophet okay everybody couldn't read back then and so they just believed what they heard and of course they were way off track then Jesus comes along and now we're into the early church okay so what was their sin that they were following Jesus they were following the Lamb of God you see and it's still happening today and all we have to do is walk in the light that God provides don't go by some personality because so and so said because they printed oh just go by the scripture go by the word we have it on record it's on every cell phone everything William brandom said is on your cell phone and everybody else's cell phone in several languages so there's no excuse okay so um Paul you know he's he's converted and uh when converted God used him in a marvelous way even to be responsible for a large portion of the scriptures of the New Testament much later after preaching the word openly uh and he was accused falsely he confessed to the authorities this I confess after the way which they call heresy that's the way I worship the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets and we can say the same thing you see amen so we'll see more about him directly before we go to lunch now these people could have compromised they could have said well this isn't so bad you know okay we we'll take the little fish off the wall and we'll we'll we'll let our ladies have the skirts a little shorter and okay yeah we'll trim the hair a little bit and to get along right we let the boys wear their bangs well we'll just let you know okay we want to get along want to have peace they didn't have a lot of money they couldn't move far away so they could have compromised okay choose a easier path no resistance no criticism path of compromise they want they could have H hands with the religious leaders and try to get along but you know the fifth messenger Martin Luther do good to go read about him sometime Christ Alone he had to withstand the Catholic Spirit yeah which was idolatry and it's still here today in the highest places be careful Christ alone okay let's get on to something here so you see the fact is God's map is all on one page now all you people under 30 you you depend on our friend here to get from here to there it's real simple she knows everything she tells you just how to get there she can see through the clouds through the snow through the rain it's marvelous but used to be we had a mapbook to cost 12 95 and it's an alphabetical order so if you're going to go from South Carolina to Arizona you had to keep flipping through see how to get there remember yeah but God's map is all on one page he knows exactly what's happening you see he can see from the beginning of the end he knows all the details of your individual life he knows where you're going to be at lunch where you going to be tonight what kind of trouble you're going to try to get into tonight or tomorrow he already sees all that and he's given you word to try to keep you balanced you see and so um you'll only be at peace when you fully surrender to God's spirit not to me not to the pastor not to the name of William brandom to the spirit of God you see yes Lord I Give You full control I'll put my hands in my pocket you lead you be the guide I'll sit still and I'll follow that's right you do that your life will be better but you go to try to figure it out and try to you know change the the balance on the checkbook and all this kind of stuff it's nothing but problems so where are we at chapter 8 verse4 therefore they were scattered abroad and every um and went everywhere preaching the word hm so these are all preachers I don't think so they're people just like you you see and they took off preaching the word the apostles stayed at Jerusalem and um they were Believers in the way living their testimony okay just live your message that's what brother random said just just live it you don't have to argue it and you know slam everybody just live your message um how many of you came from the Catholic Church let's see be real honest okay you remember back then you had Francis of AIS remember that Saint well he's there so he was a preacher 900 years ago over in Italy brother R said he was a preacher of the gospel and he said preach always comma use words when necessary that's what these people were doing they preached they went and preached everywhere yeah they were just living their life now when your sisters go to Walmart and you're the only one in the store with a long dress and with a long hair there's some people take exception to it oh don't touch me well they're on their way to hell now the ones that say God bless you where you go to church they might be taking the first step in the right direction you're preaching just by showing up you don't have to argue you don't have to have big sign in no none of that no so um these were the first missionaries of the New Movement they traveled far away and they were only preaching only living amongst Jews because Jesus told them in chapter 10 only to the house of Israel okay that's the whole thing Jesus came to Israel for Redemption okay then we'll see later how it spread to us but anyway they only lived there so they went to Phoenicia which is Lebanon 120 Mi North they sail over to Cyprus the island 150 miles and they went up to Turkey to Antioch 100 about 300 miles that was the size of their world they knew Rome was over there and Spain was a little farther they had no concept of the rest of it you know so over in verse five of chapter 8 we have a man by the name of Phillip now this is one of the helpers of chapter 6 verse5 not Phil the Apostle of Matthew 10 and so he felt inspired to go up to Samaria less than 50 Mi North and he was having great meeting up there big tent meeting let's say Big Revival and many were healed there was great joy H but every Revival produces Twins and so amongst the people listening amongst the people of the town there there's a man called Simon the Sorcerer he was a magician he had the crystal ball and he had the cards and so forth right and and uh using magic he was from the Dark Side he was involved in the occult and in verse 9 giving out other words announcing that he was the great one and this man was so obsessed with power and self-importance that the people said this man is the great power of God what else who else can do this kind of stuff you know so he had many followers no one seemed to criticize him it's all in your Bible and so um and uh but they rather marveled at the supposed importance but God wasn't part of the picture so when the people uh you know these same followers when they heard the preaching of the word over there in the name of Jesus Christ and signs and wonders many of them are believed and were baptized even Simon you know um look at verse 16 what say here uh let's see where we at the apostles wrot Jerusalem okay they heard about the about Samaria but anyway they heard that there was something going on so they came down Peter and John came down and they um uh they were laying hands on the people who reive the Holy Ghost they were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and Simon was right around there at the same time and so uh when he saw what was going on you know uh he saw the results of laying on of hands of these two important people he offered them money huh we're back to the same old thing the dirty money he said you know maybe I can buy this magic trick you know yeah look at verse 19 where it says um give me also this power that on whomsoever I Lay My Hands he may receive the Holy Ghost huh really of course it wouldn't be for free would it like Peter and John no no they'd be a little bit of money trade hands and um and so in other words I I could help you guys and and of course the ministry wouldn't be for free he heard the truth he wanted to be a part of the move of God but just couldn't detach himself from the old Simon he's right there he couldn't let the old Simon die and yield himself so God anointed a preacher of all things preacher of the Gospel to shake this man into reality verse 20 but Peter said thy money perish with thee because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money you have neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of God okay shook him and therefore repent of this thy wickedness and pray to God if perhaps the thought of thy heart might be forgiven you for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity pretty strong words another translation says I see that you're poisoned by bitterness and bound by iniquity so he discerned his case then Simon immediately asked for prayer verse 2 before and we don't know any more about it he may be there I don't know so in the midst of this wonderful Revival that's going on up in Samaria north of Jerusalem the angel of the Lord appears to Phillip amen you know everything's going fine in verse 26 and the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip arise and go towards the South unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza which is Desert so anybody that's you know been awake the last few weeks Gaza is in the news every day because that's where the bad boys live that's the boys that killed Jews and so forth it's still there and so uh he's calling him 70 M Southwest of Jerusalem go down that way go that way he didn't explain he said get up and go so brother Braham says God doesn't tell His prophets everything prophets aren't God they don't know everything they know what God shows them you know but God does arrange the details so in verse 27 we have a very important man he's a Believer he's a black man he's unmarried he's officer of the royal household household of the of Egypt he's actually The Treasure of the king Kingdom of Ethiopia yeah okay this comes from the time of Solomon remember yeah the Queen of Sheba she had heard and now she's going to go see now you guys that are musicians go look for uh I think it's a box Arrangement the arrival of the Queen of Sheba it's a three minute composition it is beautiful and fits right with brother R's description of her arriving okay arrival of the Queen of Sheba so she was convinced and she took the religion back to uh Ethiopia and so from then on there were people in Ethiopia worshiping the one true God according to the you know religion and so forth of the Jews because it was real at the time and that's what they were doing so here we are clear over here in the New Testament this man was The Treasure of the Kingdom he had been up to Jerusalem to worship he's on his way home thousands of people had done that and so he's um he's reading you know what would we would call A Spoken Word Book in verse 28 yeah uh here in verse 28 um he's returning and reading from Isaiah the prophet and the spirit said unto Philip go get close to the Chariot and join thyself to The Chariot so now here he boom he's down here 70 miles here's a chariot out there about 50 yards hey go up and get close to it so he gets close to the to the Chariot and um he um he says uh do you do you understand what you're reading because he heard him reading out loud you know and so he uh he goes up there he was obedient he was not questioning he wasn't worrying and um he runs up alongside he heard him reading out loud Hi how are you do you understand what you're reading good question verse 31 and he said how can I accept a man a preacher a prophet or you know evangelist somebody should guide me and he desired Philip that he could come up and sit with him also now Philip's in the nice Chariot and it's not no Volkswagen it's it's nice Chariot with nice horses this is a government official you know so he's in the Chariot now and um here's the prophetic manuscript from Isaiah 53 and verse 32 U where's it at and the place in scripture who he was reading he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and so forth and um down there in 33 for his life was taken from him and the unic says to Phillip now tell me please um uh who's the prophet speaking of himself or some other man well as a person knew to these words and the unit answered Philip and you know who who is he talking about so when you give the microphone to the to the Evangelist watch out so from that point he starts telling him and they got as far as baptism yeah amazing huh without missing the opportunity and they got to baptism and the man said well well here's some water what what hinders look at 37 and Philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest be baptized and he answers that I believe that Jesus Christ the son of God and he commanded the Chariot to stand still and they went both of them down into the water both Philip and the unic and he baptized him we're not going to get into any arguments but by immersion and um when they come up out of the water the spirit of the lord caught philli away and the unit couldn't see him no more and he went on his way rejoicing back home well um this obedient evangelist experienced time travel amen okay he baptized the first African convert and he preached to three different ethnic groups in three different locations in one day wow go read it we have no title for it today but God put him there you know well the story goes on and it's we only been at this 44 minutes we got time so chapter 9 verse one and Saul yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest and desired of him you know I need letters I want to Damascus and you know if there be any found of this this way anybody even looks like a Christian whether it be men or women might be bring them bound back to Jerusalem so Saul here's a fiery young Pharisee legalist I mean it's got to be what the prophets said or nothing filled with hatred and murder against the Disciples of our Lord and see there's a clue when you have people today well we got to say exactly what brother R said and they'll fight you for it and they'll kill you if they could something's not right that's right the word brings peace but this doesn't you see and so here he was uh he persecuted the new Believers our brothers and sisters he didn't wait around for orders when the na mail comes no he was over there begging for it you see anybody associated with the way would be arrested brought back to headquarters Jerusalem and um so the people they left seeking better surroundings now this could have been four years after the resurrection I don't know but um God allowed this persecution of the Believers that they might scatter and uh begin to bring order to what he said to the ends of the Earth you know so you might not understand how certain things are going to happen because there there's all kinds of promises you know we sang earlier about the you guys did about about the about the promises of God well guess what we spend all kinds of time on the positive promises and yah but there's negative promises also and they will also come to pass such as Matthew 24:24 somebody's going to rise up that's very knowledgeable with the message has it all together and steer people away gently and it's happening today amen so when you don't understand how things are going to happen just remember the sign be still I'm God I got it all figured out don't need your opinions you know God is in charge he doesn't need our opinions only our obedience so the this young Saul was a zealous government agent okay out looking for anybody that wasn't complying and uh no regard for human rights no problem with profiling and if you even looked like you were part of the way you know the way the truth and life there was torture prison probably death but he's on his way to Damascus because he heard there was some you know some of those Fanatics down there so he's got the arrest warrants and so forth but his his m message and his his uh his journey is interrupted by divine intervention verse three so I've looked back through the scripture into chapter 9 1-8 chapter 22 chapter 26 and we got a summary of his story so it's a bright hot sunny day okay it's desert they're eagerly moving towards Damascus about 130 mil Northeast of Jerusalem and a bright hot sunny day which means 100° over there and about noon all of a sudden a much brighter light appears okay it shined all around them knocked them all off their horses and now they're very confused this Fearless Commander Pharisee in charge of the anti-christian campaign is now fa down in the dirt oh we got a problem his uniform is all dirty and it looks like he's talking to himself oh it's got a real serious problem now they all saw the light and um they all fell off their horses they all heard some kind of noise but only Saul heard the voice in his language thank you God speaks to you in your language Saul Saul why are you persecuting me who are you I've been after these Christians you know Lord who are you and um but you see this was the brilliant light the power where's this coming from I am Jesus of Nazareth the one that you've been persecuting you know immediately what do you think flashed in his mind the death of Steven aha that's where it began you see immediately he was totally disarmed he had no more to say helpless even blind from the Brilliance of the glory of God and he yielded completely so if you are one of God's elect and we trust that everybody is I don't know I'm not a prophet I can't say you're going and you're not going but if you are going to God's elect he will hunt you down you can put on the front yeah fool your parents and fool the girlfriend all that nonsense God knows who you are and if you're one of his he will bring you in now you can come peacefully yes Lord I'm sorry or be like cracking a walnut or cracking something else he will get you you see so no matter what your ideas and your goals might be so Paul says well okay I'm finished what do you want me to do arise and go on into Damascus they were only two or three miles out of town going into Damascus he had a glorious conversion look at verse 8 uh where we at here eight and Saul Rose from the earth and when his eyes were open he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him to Damascus and he was there three days without sight neither did he eat or drink okay you try that starting you know 1:00 see if you can go three days without drink or food God was with him you see he's already figuring things out verse 10 and uh there was a certain disciple of Damascus named ananas and to him the Lord said in a vision an anas and he said behold I'm here Lord and the Lord said unto him arise go down to the street called straight look for the house of Judas there's one guy there Saul of Tarsus behold he's over there praying and he has seen in a vision already a man named ananas that's you sir coming in putting his hands on him that he might receive his sight H very interesting see God works on both ends God doesn't just tell you yeah this or that no he works on both ends and uh he prepares everything now this ananas you know we always think of the the deceptive property owner in chapter 5 uh and there's another one over in chapter 23 self-righteous high priest and so forth but this ananas in verse 10 he's a Believer a follower of the way and he had heard all about Pharisee Saul they that news got around and he was very cautious look at verse 12 uh okay he's seeing you coming and uh then ananas said Lord I've heard of this man and how much evil he has done to thy Saints in Jerusalem and here he has Authority from the high priest to bind all that call on thy name in other words he's shaken you you know the Lord said go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me really to hear uh to Bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and children of Israel for I will show him great things that he must suffer for my name's sake the gospel started West with this man amen up to then it's only Israel only the Israelites but here he says the Gentiles it's going to come all the way over here so um the um you know he's very cautious God says go so he went you know put on his hat went out found the address and there's a blind man kneeling down praying no questions simply goes straight in verse 17 and ananas he's still you know he's he's human he's maybe shaken a little bit but he did what God said he went his way entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother Saul wow imagine what that was like this is the man that killed Grandma yeah brother Saul the Lord even Jesus um that appeared to thee in the way when thou camest he sent me that you might receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost and immediately there fell from his eyes like scales he received his sight arose was baptized wow and when he had received meat he was strengthened and uh he was there certain days with the disciples in Damascus so things were happening fast okay he began to preach immediately there in Damascus and um uh he was totally consecrated to God God's grace can overcome anyone's background no matter who you are we don't have time to hear all your sad story and all the people you killed all the drugs forget it God brought you here repent now let's go forward amen so no matter what you've done I mean the Bible's full of people I know people in this Century that have committed horrible things but God reached and got them all that money they accumulated print books you know so God can do things you see and um he was converted and you know uh when God reaches you and you trust and Obey you can't continue with your goofy ideas and opinions Just Surrender I'm finished you know so Saul confounded you know these people that a few day days ago was his closest Associates and buddies now he's preaching against them he's inspired he knows the word so we're thankful that God has given us all these testimonies all these records you see so after a few days preaching in verse 23 says here and after many days were fulfilled the Jews took counsil how to kill him H this guy jumped ship he's with those guys we got to kill him too now you know and so um then um let's see 23 on to 24 where it says here uh but laying weight uh laying away was known their you know their their plan was known of Saul and they watch the gates day and night to kill him you see all the cities back then had a wall around them they didn't have airplanes they going to attack you got to come through the gates you seen the movies of the you know Past Times so they're watching these Gates okay watch for him and um then the disciples took him by night and led him over the wall in a basket H didn't go through the gate you know and when Saul was come to Jerusalem he uh say in other words he he checked it out how to join himself to the disciples but they were all afraid here's the mighty disciples they they they saw the resurrection saw all this stuff and they're afraid of this one man because they did not believe he was a disciple but Barnabas son of encouragement took him and brought him to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way and that he had spoken to him and so forth and give him the whole story and um and he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and the disciples uh and disputed against the i s but they went about to slay him they just got to get him somehow you know because they're anointed to do that so he um uh they wanted to kill him that's the second attempt on his life already and people had such a hard time adjusting to change God's word is all about change brother Brown talks about it in the the symphony and how there's shifts in the music and so forth things happen you got to know your Bible you see and so you you know getting with God's program today receiving the revelation of the word you see anybody can read and repeat they're doing that in every Baptist Church in South Carolina this morning they're reading repeating but there's no life because they're not with program today you see they have to have the revelation of the word and so it'll live through you it'll make a difference so changing the scene while Saul was away and tripped to his hometown Peter and the other disciples were very busy in 32 33 through 35 healing of anaas paralyzed for8 years and um notice he didn't pray he simply spoke the word look at verse 34 of chapter nine see here and Peter said unto him anaus Jesus Christ makes thee whole arise make thy bed and he arose immediately and all that dwelt at Jerusalem all that dwelt at L and saon saw him and turned to the Lord we don't know if it was 100% but many of them turned to the Lord okay and then he went over and prayed for the for the Tabitha Dorcas the disciple you see the world is watching your life every day they're watching to see what how you're reacting to the current crisis we're not worried about stuff that happen 30 years ago we're worried about today we're attacking the Arabs something big is coming down watch out prices are going up and people are watching you see in John Chapter 13 Jesus said now this is how they're all going to know that you're part of me not that you carry a Bible they all got Bibles not that you got William brand on your cell phone that's at least their problems but the way you treat each other the love that you have one to another that's how they'll know you're part of me you see now you take for example the Amish people they work together they help each other they're they're they're great you know to the part they know they they fulfill it I've got more respect for them than a lot of people carrying spoken word books because they work together they're they're true to the vision of 300 years ago but they're real you know that's right and so uh but we have been entrusted with the secrets of the Kingdom we are the Bride of Jesus Christ if we're following the word of today and so just live what you know is true if you don't understand anything stick with it a little while God will reveal it to you okay now there's 28 chapters in Acts but we're not going to go through them today so here thank you for your attention and I will have to come [Applause] back let's stand you know I was struck with how relevant the book of Acts becomes when you look at it like that and you break it down line for line and you get to see in fact as I was deeply appreciating that today it's the same effect that I had watching the the one where just the whole um oh I can't think of it now words the life of Jesus chosen thank you brother Bradley yeah because it it it deals with the humanity side and you realize that that these people in the book of Acts we're just you and I and that something you know we we look at it we we we can't hardly there's a lot between the lines that you I just think on the other side that we're going to get a chance to interview these people and go wow you know I kind of I didn't catch that perspective and they go oh yeah well you know I that's why we thought you couldn't make it at the end time amen because it got too dark I think we're going to have a lot of aha moments Amen on the other side amen I I so appreciate that because it makes the gospel real you know I was I was just doing a quick cross reference as brother George was talking about the you know the translation brother Bram talks about how that you know when he brings up that Ethiopian unic up out of the water teleportation soon he's gone you know many many many miles away he's founded another place and uh you know I've I've I remember talking to um brother um brother Jim naichi Jim Copus they call him in Ghana he had an experience like that and he was actually doubting this is when he was doubting the supernatural wasn't even a Christian and he went to see they said there's some great holy man who sits up under a tree now that man was basically almost like a witch doctor and brother Jim said I I I came to him as a as an unbeliever you see there's that Spiritual Works on both sides there's Realms that you don't understand and and he said I I doubt you they say that you have all this power but I don't believe it and the old man looked up at him and he said take a hold of my cloak and brother Jim said I reached down and just grabbed his his cloak and he said the next thing I knew I was walking into a village about 50 miles away and he said just in in a moment and you know the these kinds of things are real and I was looking and and brother Bram talks about that that event and I was looking and you it's it's amazing that I could couldn't find just and I was just doing a quick just a quick reference as I was sitting there and I even made a note about it that I couldn't find any commentator who would even begin a knowledge most of them wouldn't even comment on that 40th verse it's like they just jumped it we don't talk about that and the other ones just you know there was two or three that said two or three of my favorites who said well you know it's probably just the leadership of the Lord he went on up the coastline and walked on I'm said wow that's not what I read I'm glad I can believe for the Supernatural friends that should work as just reading this morning brother brandham said those same things should be working among us because this is the hour of that complete restoration you know I was struck with the thought of how that such a simple statement that had such profound meaning to me and you know I don't know if you caught it brother George was talking about you know sometimes you'll get a plant and you've got a little label that tells you what it is or a lot of times where this really comes comes in as if you're buying seed and the seed has a label or a sticker that tells you what it is and uh but you're really not going to know till the flowers bloom it might tell you that it's you know pink impatience or purple this or that but until you actually see it Bloom you're not going to know and I mean you know you can have people say I'm a Christian but let me let me see what what it looks like when the flower blooms amen how many want to bloom the way the SE of God the way that the word of God tells us and and lastly I I just want to give you my my thoughts and Reflections I was thinking as brother George was going through that I love that kind of expository teaching where you're going verse by verse like that I do a lot of that online in the Book of Revelation but I I went back and I thought goodness gracious here is Stephen and for 50 verses that's it's a good section through through a whole chapter Stephen is preaching to them a truth that's a little bit um it's it's a little bit not everything he's saying they want to hear he's talking about in the wilderness and the things that went on and you all know we don't have a perfect track record and he was saying that to all these Jewish leaders and they kind of like it's a little awkward and we're a little comfortable but it's the truth it's the truth we'll just have to keep going amen amen amen and then he comes down and after 50 verses of the truth and they're going along with it and then he just's three verses from 50 and then three verses and he's still telling the truth which of your fathers didn't didn't which which prophet didn't your fathers persecute and kill and that was the truth also but after 50 verses three verses sent them over the edge and they they and they martyred him you know it's amazing that the world when when brother Brandon would talk about you know the history of the church and those religious leaders they couldn't deny it they couldn't deny it and brother Brandon would talk about where you stood when we started out in Pentecost and look where we are now and it's a little bit inconvenient a little bit awkward but everybody's waiting on that gift to come but you know when brother Brandon began to really turn the and begin to tell them you're going to that is going to take you and lead you to the mark of the beast that's when they were I just say yeah shake the dust off I'll take every bit of it if you don't want it how many want the whole truth the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth please thank you that's what I want I I don't want to hide behind you know my own weaknesses and ups and downs I just say Lord here I am just lay L it out to me I just want to know just give it to me straight so that at least I can know where I stand and I can get myself right I want to be right you want to be right are you glad for a message that didn't pull any punches and tells the truth and because there is a not many just like in the book of Acts the majority didn't want to hear it but there was a small minority there's one man from Ethiopia and obviously he's searching for something in his life because he's reading the word of God I've been there reading the word of God Amen sounds like we're going to sing some more that brother Tony go ahead let's sing it and then one day oh yes I'll cross I'll cross the river I'll see [Music] and no war with pain are you glad for that day coming Final War my give way to Victory oh I want that Victory I'll see
