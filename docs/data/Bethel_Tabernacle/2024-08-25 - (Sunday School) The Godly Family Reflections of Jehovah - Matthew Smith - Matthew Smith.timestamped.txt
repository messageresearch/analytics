[5:58] e e
[6:49] this is Genesis chapter 1 verse 27 um
[6:54] says so God created man in his own
[6:56] image in the image of God created he him
[7:00] male and female created he them y'all
[7:02] can be
[7:03] seated
[7:06] um so this morning I I titled let me
[7:10] pull up and see what I texted the booth
[7:12] What My Title was
[7:14] um my title for this
[7:17] morning is The Godly
[7:20] family with a subtitle of reflections of
[7:24] Jehova
[7:26] so um I was I Brother JD was out out of
[7:29] town today and he was scheduled so he
[7:31] asked me to cover for him and then so I
[7:33] was I was preparing something very
[7:34] different um for today and then this
[7:36] morning I just
[7:37] got hooked into this um just wouldn't
[7:40] leave me alone so Lord changed my
[7:42] direction um
[7:44] entirely
[7:46] um and I guess you know brother JD's
[7:49] been covering the his family Series so I
[7:51] guess someone needed to hear about the
[7:53] family today um so I I had some a long
[7:57] time ago I had done a study on on just
[8:00] sort of marriage and and the Dynamics of
[8:03] the man and the wife and and
[8:06] how the the a man and a wife coming
[8:10] together in
[8:11] marriage why it's important what it does
[8:13] and and and a lot of just different
[8:15] things about that um and ultimately like
[8:18] I said it is about creating a
[8:22] family and um so this morning I I maybe
[8:26] just want to take a moment and think
[8:27] about why this is important and and you
[8:30] know because it occurred to me all right
[8:31] so you know brother JD's been covering
[8:33] the family and then it just seemed like
[8:35] it hit me out of the blue this is what I
[8:36] need to cover this morning so I'm
[8:37] thinking you know Lord why why is this
[8:39] important and so I'm kind of meditating
[8:42] on this and just some thoughts that came
[8:45] to me is you
[8:46] know here it is that God created man in
[8:50] the
[8:52] beginning um male and female right that
[8:54] that God makes
[8:57] man with male and female to together and
[8:59] then later separates in Genesis chapter
[9:01] 2 um separates the female from the
[9:05] male and and creates a family
[9:10] right
[9:13] and
[9:15] this ultimately when when God made man
[9:18] in his own
[9:20] image what is going to happen with Adam
[9:22] and Eve and what Adam and Eve are and
[9:25] become and do is a pattern of God
[9:28] because if Adam is made in the image of
[9:30] God then we can make some determination
[9:33] about what God is based off of what Adam
[9:36] was
[9:38] so here you have Adam dwelling alone in
[9:41] the garden and it's not good he's lonely
[9:43] he needs he needs another another human
[9:46] to be there so God takes a portion of
[9:49] Adam and makes a helper for him makes a
[9:51] a a
[9:53] companion and these two
[9:56] people um you know that so that man
[9:59] would be alone right because he needed a
[10:01] family God you the man needed a family
[10:03] well this is an indication that God
[10:05] needs a family right we can we can say
[10:07] that God self the self-existing one
[10:09] dwelling alone you know nothing created
[10:12] him the the unmoved
[10:16] Mover sees that he's alone and he that
[10:18] he needs he needs companionship so what
[10:20] does he do he reaches into himself and
[10:23] takes a rib or something and makes
[10:26] Humanity out of that right he makes a
[10:28] church he makes a bride out of himself
[10:31] right and
[10:33] so we so you you you know we can see the
[10:36] pattern here that with Adam and
[10:39] Eve here they are
[10:43] um
[10:45] uh with you know as as
[10:50] um I guess so I guess my my point is
[10:54] with um the reason it's so important to
[10:57] study these things right this to to to
[10:59] really pay attention to what your
[11:00] marriage is doing right I I if if you're
[11:03] if you're married or or looking to get
[11:06] married or whatever your situation may
[11:08] be your relationship with your
[11:11] spouse is going to inform your
[11:13] relationship with
[11:14] God right these two things your family
[11:17] should be patterning itself after the
[11:19] family of God right God's program is the
[11:22] pattern that you're supposed to be
[11:24] patterned off
[11:25] of if your family is if you are in the
[11:27] image of God and your family's in the
[11:28] image of God it's going to look a
[11:29] certain way it's going to be organized a
[11:31] certain way it's going to function a
[11:32] certain kind of way and if it's not
[11:33] functioning that way it means
[11:34] something's out of cater and something
[11:37] about your view and your relationship
[11:39] with God is out of whack because if your
[11:41] relationship with God was right then
[11:43] your marriage would be
[11:45] right right if and if you're and so vice
[11:48] versa if if there's a so if there's a
[11:50] problem with one there's a problem
[11:52] somewhere
[11:53] else
[11:56] so um
[12:02] keep track of my time here um I want
[12:07] to and then furthermore um obviously you
[12:11] know with with a marriage it creates
[12:13] children so many times and with
[12:16] kids we know that what um you know we
[12:21] know that with the the parents are the
[12:24] first version of God that that kid's
[12:26] ever going to see right if you're
[12:29] marriage is not in line with the word of
[12:32] God then you're going to produce effects
[12:35] in those kids that are not it's going to
[12:38] multiply right whatever your marriage
[12:40] problem is is going to end up baked into
[12:42] the psychology of your kids and those
[12:45] kids are going to suffer and they're
[12:46] going to end up with baggage because
[12:48] your marriage wasn't squared away am um
[12:52] you know you great I've seen this happen
[12:56] a lot um in both extremes just as an
[12:58] example
[13:00] you know you take a um a man who's a
[13:05] tyrant right he's he's got a little too
[13:07] much pride and he thinks that he's just
[13:08] the the you know biggest baddest guy in
[13:11] town and he's going to rule his family
[13:13] with an Iron Fist and there's no Grace
[13:14] and there's no anything right there's no
[13:17] no room for error and he's kind of
[13:19] legalistic well what happens
[13:22] is the kids end up with a with a because
[13:26] that's the first version of Jehovah they
[13:28] will ever see
[13:30] so now without consciously thinking
[13:32] about it right without them sitting down
[13:34] and and and doing the math it's just
[13:37] sort of baked into that kid because they
[13:39] were raised in that environment their
[13:41] view of God is going to be one of a
[13:43] tyrant with no Grace and legalistic and
[13:47] there's no room for the flesh whatsoever
[13:50] it you no no room for the grace for the
[13:52] flesh so there's no chance at at walking
[13:56] any sort of Christian life because the
[13:58] first time you stumble and fall and
[13:59] you're just done and worthless and and
[14:00] God's done with you right and so you
[14:02] might as well not even try and there's
[14:04] no there's no Grace for anybody else and
[14:06] there's certainly no Grace for
[14:07] yourself right if that's the if and I've
[14:10] seen that happen with kids where that's
[14:12] the environment they were raised in and
[14:13] that's and so they end up not even
[14:15] trying to be a Christian because there's
[14:18] it's pointless in their mind right
[14:20] because their view of God was directly
[14:22] informed by the view
[14:24] of their parent right by by the by where
[14:29] the man was not operating in accordance
[14:32] to the word of God but then you can go
[14:34] on the other side and you have a dad
[14:35] who's
[14:36] completely just just no backbone will
[14:39] just let anything slide no you know just
[14:43] let things come and go way too overly
[14:44] permissive and so now the view of the
[14:47] kids that the kids end up having going
[14:49] in their view of God is that well
[14:51] anything goes God doesn't really care I
[14:53] can live like the devil and it doesn't
[14:54] matter as long as I come to church and
[14:55] raise my hand and Praise Jesus on Sunday
[14:58] right right and that it's and so what
[15:01] you've done there is now the man has
[15:02] abdicated his responsibility as headship
[15:05] right he's completely completely
[15:07] abandoned his position as being a leader
[15:10] in the home and giving it over to the
[15:13] mom who's you know the the woman in the
[15:16] household so now you have a female
[15:17] headship in the home and it creates in
[15:20] the kids a denominational
[15:22] attitude because think about it right
[15:24] what's a denominational system it's when
[15:25] the church has usurped Authority in the
[15:27] relationship between the church and God
[15:29] Amen right it's the church is putting
[15:31] their own mentality their own ideas
[15:37] over uh you know what what morality and
[15:40] goodness and and the right way to live
[15:41] is and and kind of letting um you know I
[15:46] just read this the other day um Isaiah
[15:48] chapter 30 verse one I'll actually
[15:50] just uh let me pull that up real
[15:54] quick um it says woe to the rebellious
[15:58] children sayith the Lord that take
[16:00] counsel but not of me that cover with a
[16:03] covering but not of my spirit that they
[16:05] may add sin to sin yeah right that this
[16:09] is a denominational attitude that here
[16:11] Adam and Eve are in the garden they sin
[16:12] what do they do they make their own
[16:14] covering a sort of religious covering
[16:16] well I'll just go to church I'll go do
[16:17] some good deeds I'll pay Ms and give
[16:19] some charity but when it comes to
[16:22] actually affecting my my real lifestyle
[16:24] what I do what I crave what I desire
[16:27] what I spend my time on I will not let
[16:29] that be subjugated by the word of God
[16:32] right and so you have the church now
[16:36] taken Authority in the relationship
[16:38] between God and the church that's a
[16:40] denominational attitude amen right and
[16:43] so now you end up with when you have an
[16:45] overly permissive husband who just
[16:47] allows anything to go and lets the woman
[16:50] run the household then you end up with
[16:53] kids who have a view of God that just
[16:57] allows anything to go and that they
[16:59] particular view of what is good and
[17:01] decent and
[17:03] right completely out you know in their
[17:06] own mind outweighs whatever you know
[17:08] they they well you know God God will
[17:10] just let it slide it's because I I love
[17:12] God and it's it's all good in the end
[17:15] right and you know they're completely
[17:18] failing to recognize that this
[17:20] is they're they're living in a in a
[17:22] spiritual
[17:23] fornication you know it there and and
[17:27] you know it's no it's no surprise that
[17:29] in this day and
[17:31] age
[17:34] where you know brother brand call it the
[17:36] woman's age right and and we see it in
[17:40] this I mean if you study history at all
[17:42] whatsoever you a lot of people talk
[17:44] about well women are oppressed today
[17:46] compared to what compared pick a time in
[17:49] history and tell me when it was better
[17:51] um you know and and you know that's not
[17:52] to say
[17:53] that anyways my my point is women have
[17:56] it better off now than they've ever had
[17:57] it um
[17:59] in in a lot of ways it's gone way so far
[18:02] the other direction where it's it's like
[18:03] you know women can can do no wrong and
[18:06] and and there's no there's no
[18:07] accountability there's no check right so
[18:10] so now there's it's it's the woman's age
[18:13] right the prophet said that it would be
[18:14] this way
[18:16] um and again like you know there there's
[18:20] other times in history where it was the
[18:21] other way and and not to not to say that
[18:23] it's you know Justified to to abuse
[18:24] women but my my point simply is that
[18:27] when you get to a point where women have
[18:29] totally taken control that now you know
[18:32] the the household the typical American
[18:35] household is so heavily controlled
[18:38] everything is the the the idea the
[18:40] culture
[18:42] completely humiliates the idea of of a
[18:45] strong man right that that you know you
[18:47] any any kind of mainstream depiction of
[18:50] a of a nuclear family shows the the man
[18:52] as a bumbling idiot at best and and the
[18:56] woman as sort of this this smart
[18:58] intellig
[18:59] person who's really running the show um
[19:02] and so they've completely degraded and
[19:05] and and and um mocked the idea of of
[19:09] male leadership to the point that it's
[19:12] almost laughable that that a man would
[19:14] be the head of the
[19:16] household
[19:19] and it's not a coincidence that in that
[19:24] environment we also see the rise that it
[19:27] would be this day of all days in this
[19:30] age that the the prophet for our our day
[19:34] like his one of his fundamental primary
[19:38] things that he came to tell people was
[19:40] that it would be this day above all
[19:42] other days above all other
[19:45] ages that the church would take Supreme
[19:50] political
[19:51] Authority that's the culmination of this
[19:53] age that a World Council of churches
[19:56] will rule the world that all po iCal
[19:58] power will be subsumed by a religious
[20:01] system
[20:03] that history of the world that a church
[20:09] would have supreme authority over the
[20:11] entire
[20:13] planet so when he says that it's a
[20:15] woman's age it's more than just social
[20:19] standing in women it's also the fact
[20:21] that the church which is a type of a
[20:23] woman is going to take supreme authority
[20:26] and and the whole world will do it
[20:29] willingly and gladly and and think it's
[20:32] a beautiful wonderful thing when they do
[20:34] it why because they want a
[20:38] covering right they they want counsel
[20:41] for their lives but not God's counsel
[20:44] they want a covering but not God's
[20:46] covering right because every human
[20:49] instinctively knows that your sin needs
[20:50] a
[20:52] covering right that's why Adam and Eve
[20:54] instinctively made coverings when they
[20:56] failed
[20:59] but it's not God's
[21:01] covering it's not God's
[21:04] covering you know it's not the not the
[21:06] blood of a lamb it's a it's a man-made
[21:08] construct that that can ease our
[21:10] conscience and make us feel less um you
[21:15] know less ashamed of what we've
[21:17] done um I have completely derailed off
[21:20] of the family
[21:22] um uh but but this is but so this is
[21:27] this is the this is the the result that
[21:29] we we have when when
[21:33] headship is
[21:35] not in its place right when when the man
[21:39] is not in it in in his place when the
[21:41] woman's not in his place and when it's
[21:42] everything's functioning functioning
[21:43] correctly and everything's functioning
[21:45] the way it's supposed to and it's after
[21:47] the pattern of God's word then it's
[21:49] beautiful and you end up with with
[21:51] healthy children and and and good
[21:54] relationships with God and you end up
[21:56] with with
[21:59] uh you know all this dysfunction that we
[22:00] see in the world is a direct result of
[22:03] again the family not patterning itself a
[22:07] in in the way that God intended it to to
[22:10] function
[22:13] um I do want to actually get to my notes
[22:16] at some point
[22:20] um we'll go to Ephesians chapter 5 and
[22:24] verse 21
[22:47] says
[22:53] um submitting yourselves one to another
[22:56] in the fear of God wives submit
[22:57] yourselves unto your own husbands as
[22:59] unto the Lord for the husband is the
[23:02] head of the wife even as Christ is the
[23:05] head of the church and he is the savior
[23:07] of the body therefore as the church is
[23:09] subject unto Christ so let the wives be
[23:12] to their own husbands in
[23:15] everything husbands love your wives even
[23:17] as Christ also loved the church and gave
[23:19] himself for it that he might sanctify
[23:22] and cleans it with the washing of the
[23:23] Water by the word that he might present
[23:26] it to himself a glorious Church not
[23:28] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[23:31] but that it should be holy and without
[23:33] blemish so ought men to love their wives
[23:36] as their own bodies he that loveth his
[23:38] wife love himself for no man ever yet
[23:41] hated his own flesh but nourisheth and
[23:45] cherisheth it even as the Lord the
[23:48] church for we are members of his body of
[23:51] his flesh and of his bones for this
[23:54] cause shall a man leave his father and
[23:56] his mother and shall be joined unto his
[23:58] his wife and they two shall be one
[24:02] flesh so um just kind of
[24:09] um you know it's this is a very common
[24:12] scripture read anytime you're talking
[24:14] about marriage and family and you know
[24:17] uh headship and all that stuff um the
[24:20] the what I what I thing that I I really
[24:24] want want to point a point that I want
[24:25] to make I've got five minutes left
[24:30] um is that you know this scripture is
[24:34] often thrown out as wives submit
[24:37] yourselves to your husbands right that's
[24:39] the first part of the the passage and
[24:42] that is true you know you submit
[24:43] yourselves even as Christ uh is as a
[24:46] church under Christ you know and and
[24:48] again so if if you have a wife not
[24:50] submitting herself to her husband then
[24:51] it's an indication that there's a
[24:53] problem there because it's
[24:56] it's there's no submission into to the
[24:58] word either right and likewise but but
[25:02] there's the other side of it as well
[25:04] which is that the you only get that you
[25:07] only get the submission of the wife to
[25:10] the man if the man loves her the way
[25:15] Christ loved the church right you don't
[25:17] get one without the other and if you try
[25:20] to have one without the other then you
[25:22] end up with an imbalance and you end up
[25:23] with Calamity and you end up with a
[25:27] broken home right something
[25:29] dysfunctional and evil
[25:32] um and so I you
[25:36] know we
[25:37] can a lot of times people will take one
[25:39] angle or the other and and they'll go
[25:42] you know uh beat the women into
[25:44] submission or they'll take the men and
[25:46] beat them into submission um really what
[25:50] I think that would behoove us all is to
[25:52] recognize that this is a this is a
[25:53] partnership at the end of the day we we
[25:56] are married because we want to love each
[25:57] other
[25:58] right we this this isn't winning it's
[26:01] not a team sport right you're not it's
[26:04] not it's not a a uh uh you know when God
[26:08] made man and he he had man and then he
[26:10] separated Eve from
[26:13] Adam he had to do it that way because
[26:17] now there was they were from the same
[26:20] flesh right so there's immediate
[26:22] connection there they they're drawn to
[26:23] each other there's already connection
[26:26] right so they can finish each other's
[26:28] sentences and yet because she has
[26:30] feminine nature and he has none of that
[26:34] therefore she can do things that he
[26:36] can't she can see things that he can't
[26:39] you know they can they can connect they
[26:42] can intuitively
[26:43] communicate and yet she can say stuff
[26:46] that he'll never it'll never occur to
[26:48] him right like you know we should turn
[26:52] the temperature down when we're trying
[26:53] to sleep at night it would never occur
[26:55] to a man to do that um and yet my wife
[26:58] does all the time um and it doesn't
[27:00] occur to me to do that I'm making a joke
[27:02] but the point is women do that the women
[27:05] will know things intuitively about a
[27:07] situation that a man will completely
[27:10] Miss and because she's got wiring that
[27:12] he doesn't have she he has she has like
[27:14] extra senses that he's completely
[27:16] oblivious to and
[27:19] likewise the way a man thinks a woman
[27:21] will never get her head around that half
[27:23] the time because they need each other
[27:26] God made them to to need each other to
[27:28] not be able to function without each
[27:29] other so they're tied together and can't
[27:33] leave because you know humans would if
[27:36] we could half the
[27:39] time and so because it's a it's a team
[27:42] effort it's it's both parties putting in
[27:45] in
[27:47] 100% then we end up you know then you
[27:49] can have a situation where it's you know
[27:53] you can have the balance that the that
[27:55] Ephesians is trying to produce that
[27:59] the the man the the wife is submitting
[28:01] herself to the husband and she's she's
[28:03] following the example you know like
[28:04] brother JD's been hitting a lot lately
[28:07] with and fair no no criticism there it
[28:10] needs to be said listen the man is the
[28:12] head of the home when he says he his
[28:14] word supersedes everything but that's
[28:17] because he's the one making the
[28:21] sacrifice right he's the one who if he's
[28:25] in the position of Christ that means
[28:27] that he has to do what Christ did which
[28:29] is of his own valtion go give his life
[28:32] for her and that doesn't just mean like
[28:35] dying that means giving your whole life
[28:38] for somebody everything that you wanted
[28:40] all your dreams and hopes and Ambitions
[28:42] are now subject to making sure that that
[28:44] your wife is taken care of right
[28:47] everything that you want goes to the
[28:49] side because your family comes first
[28:52] right that is the sacrifice of Christ
[28:54] and if it's not if that's if if you're
[28:56] putting your
[28:58] entertainment and Sport and whatever you
[29:02] you if the man is putting him his own
[29:04] desires ahead of the needs of his family
[29:06] then he is not being Christ in his
[29:10] family you know if if nothing wrong with
[29:13] anything in particular but when a man
[29:15] makes his whole life about something
[29:17] that's not his
[29:18] family the family's going to suffer and
[29:21] he's going to answer for that there's
[29:22] going to be a price to be
[29:24] paid and likewise you know when when the
[29:28] wife doesn't submit to that because at
[29:30] the end of the
[29:31] day the man's responsible for everything
[29:34] that happens right if the if the man is
[29:36] the head and the wife is the body right
[29:38] as as as the Bible
[29:40] says then you know in the Bible when
[29:43] when say you know if a if a man murders
[29:46] another man the Bible always the
[29:47] phrasing is always the the murdered
[29:50] man's blood is on his head it wasn't the
[29:53] head that stabbed the man it was the
[29:55] hand right what the hand does the head
[29:59] is responsible for okay what the wife
[30:02] does the husband is responsible for
[30:06] right you with the what the body what
[30:08] your family is doing or not
[30:11] doing the husband is the ultimate the
[30:13] the the man of the house of the ultimate
[30:16] Authority there god holds him
[30:17] accountable that's why he also has the
[30:20] final say it's not fair to give him all
[30:24] the the the responsibility but none of
[30:27] the
[30:28] Authority right and so this is this is
[30:31] the kind of dynamic and when it's
[30:33] working properly and it's working in
[30:35] accordance to the word of God then we
[30:37] get something beautiful that everyone is
[30:39] ultimately happy
[30:41] with which we will have to talk about at
[30:45] a later date because I'm out of
[30:46] time so let's stand and have a quick
[30:49] word of
[30:54] prayer
[30:56] father Lord I hope that something I've
[30:59] said would be a help that someone could
[31:02] take something away from this that
[31:03] wouldn't just simply be a a nice thought
[31:06] but Lord that it would
[31:07] be uh edifying that it would help them
[31:10] draw closer to you
[31:12] and to see you and in everything that
[31:15] they do lord it's our desire that you
[31:18] would take total control of everything
[31:20] that we do all of our relationships and
[31:22] our and our families and everything that
[31:24] we would patter ourselves after you and
[31:26] and your perfect pattern
[31:29] we ask that You' be with through through
[31:30] the remainder of the service be with us
[31:32] in the song service that we'd be able to
[31:33] open our hearts to you and we be able to
[31:36] worship and create an environment in
[31:37] which you'd be pleased to dwell in ask
[31:39] this in the name of the Lord Jesus
[31:40] Christ
