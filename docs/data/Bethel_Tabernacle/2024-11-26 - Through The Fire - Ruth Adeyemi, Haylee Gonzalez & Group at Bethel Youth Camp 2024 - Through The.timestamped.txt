[0:01] God bless you
[0:02] church amen we're going to be singing
[0:06] through the fire and I pray that the God
[0:08] Almighty bless you as we sing in Jesus
[0:10] name amen
[0:30] so many times of
[0:32] questioned certain
[0:36] circumstances or things I could
[0:39] not
[0:42] [Music]
[0:43] understand many times in
[0:47] Trials weakness blurs my
[0:50] vision my frustration gets so out of
[0:57] hand it's then I am
[1:00] minded I've never been
[1:04] forsaken I've never had to stand the
[1:07] test
[1:10] alone as I look at all the
[1:14] victories the spirit Rises up in me and
[1:18] is through the fire my weaknesses made
[1:25] strong he never promis that the cross
[1:30] would not get heavy and the hill would
[1:33] not be hard to
[1:39] climb he never offered a we fight even
[1:45] he said help
[1:52] will just remember when you
[1:55] standing in the valley of decision
[1:59] and the adversary says
[2:04] give just hold
[2:08] on our Lord will show
[2:11] up and he will take you through the fire
[2:17] [Music]
[2:20] again I know within myself that I will
[2:25] surely
[2:26] perish but if I draw the hand of God you
[2:31] show the Flames
[2:34] again all
[2:39] again he never promised that the cross
[2:43] would not get
[2:45] heavy H would not be hard
[2:53] to he never
[2:55] offer a without fighting but he
[3:00] [Music]
[3:02] said
[3:05] time just when standing in the valley of
[3:12] theion and the adversary say
[3:18] G just so
[3:22] long our Lord will show
[3:25] up and he will take you through the
[3:32] again just for
[3:35] long our Lord will show
[3:39] up and he will take you through the fire
