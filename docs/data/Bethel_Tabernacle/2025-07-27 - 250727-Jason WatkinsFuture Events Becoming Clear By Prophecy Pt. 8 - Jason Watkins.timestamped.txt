[4:22] &gt;&gt; It's good to be in the house of the
[4:23] Lord.
[4:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just sitting quietly before the
[4:27] service just focusing on him, looking
[4:30] under Jesus, the author and finisher of
[4:32] our faith. Amen. I want to welcome Jim
[4:36] with us today. He helped work on the
[4:38] fellowship hall a little bit last week.
[4:42] Amen. And then um I do have a testimony
[4:46] this morning from brother Doug.
[4:49] Now his his boy Teddy
[4:52] has had uh one eye was like 20 over 200
[4:55] which is legally blind
[4:58] and he was at Louisiana
[5:01] camp two years ago and he was told then
[5:04] that God was going to heal his eyesight.
[5:08] So that month Teddy took his glasses and
[5:11] destroyed them. And um just last night
[5:16] after service, Brother Andrew was
[5:18] preaching, but he he walked over to his
[5:20] mom and dad and said, "I can see better
[5:22] out of that eye than the other one."
[5:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[5:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Two years. Sounds like the faith
[5:27] of Abraham. Amen.
[5:30] Thank you, Jesus.
[5:33] Amen. In in his time, he makes all
[5:35] things beautiful. Amen. I have a request
[5:39] for Elliot this morning. He's been
[5:41] running a fever. Sister Meredith is home
[5:43] with him and um she mentioned that it
[5:46] had been like 102 and 103, but he's
[5:49] doing better this morning, but we just
[5:51] want to pray. She thinks it's probably a
[5:53] little bit of the virus that Hazel had
[5:55] deal dealt with, too. So, we want to
[5:57] remember that this morning. You have a
[5:59] request upon your heart this morning.
[6:02] You know, our brother brought a Sunday
[6:03] school lesson and you know, Martha and
[6:06] Mary so busy about so many things. So, I
[6:09] just want you to be like Mary this
[6:11] morning. Set all that stuff aside. Amen.
[6:14] And sit at the feet of Jesus and you
[6:17] everything else will be just fine. Amen.
[6:19] Let's pray.
[6:21] Father, I love you. How many times,
[6:24] Lord, you you come and comfort me, help
[6:28] me along, Father, and tell me to keep
[6:31] pressing.
[6:33] This grace is sufficient for me, Father,
[6:35] as well as each and everyone here. I
[6:38] thank you for that, Lord, on the cross
[6:41] where you said the work was finished and
[6:44] it is. We pray for Elliot this morning
[6:47] and the hands that were lifted. Father,
[6:50] we remember them before you praying in
[6:52] the name of Jesus Christ. You said that
[6:55] by your stripes, we are healed. Father,
[6:58] whatever ails us, Lord, mentally,
[7:01] physically,
[7:03] Father, we pray that you would just work
[7:04] upon us. We remember the sick amongst us
[7:07] this morning, Father, always lifting
[7:10] them up before you, Father.
[7:12] And Lord, we just pray for those that
[7:14] are streaming. We come, Lord, to see you
[7:18] this morning. And we believe that we
[7:20] will see you in spirit and in truth as
[7:22] you break open the bread of life to us.
[7:25] Let us break open our hearts to receive
[7:27] what you have for us. Father, I pray
[7:30] that you would bless the tithes and
[7:31] offerings. We thank you, Lord, for the
[7:33] bounty that you give us, Lord. And we
[7:36] pray that we just return it tenfold to
[7:38] you.
[7:40] I love you this morning. I thank you for
[7:42] your mercy and grace, Father. I pray for
[7:45] those souls that are in need of
[7:47] salvation this morning, dear God. You
[7:50] would reach down and touch that little
[7:52] seed inside, spring it to life. Father,
[7:56] help us to make decisions, Lord, that we
[7:58] never go back on by your grace. In Jesus
[8:01] name we pray. Amen.
[8:05] [Music]

[32:55] to please.

[38:14] and I
[38:17] [Music]
[38:22] Lord please come
[38:26] take control.
[38:29] I feel the hope
[38:35] in worship. I come to hear the word
[38:42] and with each line and praise.
[38:51] He was calling
[38:56] to give
[38:57] a higher
[39:00] praise.
[39:05] There's a deep
[39:09] call to the deep
[39:12] like a great man
[39:16] pulling me.
[39:19] I know for sure
[39:24] to go home
[39:26] cuz I feel the poor.
[39:33] I feel the
[39:37] [Music]
[39:39] I hear the call.
[39:44] [Music]
[39:51] through
[39:53] me.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; My
[39:56] Are you giving your all today?
[39:58] Hallelujah.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; My
[40:01] speak to me.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Speak to me.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Here's my part. Here's my part. I agree.
[40:11] Yes, Lord. I agree.
[40:17] Come and take control.
[40:22] I feel
[40:25] &gt;&gt; the pull.
[40:28] Let's bow our heads this morning.
[40:29] Master, we thank you. We thank you for
[40:32] your great word and the great liberty of
[40:33] your spirit that we feel and we sense.
[40:35] Lord, thank you for all the worship and
[40:38] the singing. Lord, we come now to that
[40:41] moment where our hearts and minds are
[40:44] now ready, made ready and tuned to hear
[40:46] the word of God.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Grant it to us, Lord, that it would be a
[40:50] living word. That as we hear it, Lord,
[40:52] it would take root in our hearts. And
[40:54] from deep within, there would be that
[40:56] amen that says, "Yes, Lord, so be it
[40:59] unto me." May you grant it today, Lord.
[41:01] May you be with the speaker and the
[41:03] hearer. Give us hearing hearts today. We
[41:06] pray. We commit it to you, Lord. That's
[41:08] all we can do. We can prepare. We can
[41:10] come. We can make you welcome. I believe
[41:13] that's happened now, Lord. Now, you
[41:15] come, Father. Without you, Lord, it
[41:17] won't be accomplished. So, we we sense
[41:20] you're already here. And we believe now
[41:23] that you'll bless your word in Jesus'
[41:25] name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Say,
[41:28] "Amen."
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Going to invite you to
[41:32] Daniel chapter 12 this morning. And um
[41:36] want to just be remembering those prayer
[41:37] requests. I heard them go out. Amen.
[41:40] Want to trust the Lord that Amen. Ellie,
[41:42] it'll be just fine. And then um I heard
[41:46] that testimony brother Luther gave. And
[41:48] uh so just wonderful. And uh Brother
[41:51] Tony will be heading today to academy.
[41:55] So just be keeping him in prayer, would
[41:57] you? Amen. Praise the Lord. I I know
[41:59] he'll do fine, but Amen. I want the Lord
[42:02] just to let him know he'll do fine.
[42:04] Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Matt is
[42:06] away ministering. Brother Brad is away
[42:08] ministering. Want to be in prayer for
[42:10] them today. Amen.
[42:13] You love him.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; What do you need to do next?
[42:18] Turn around, shake hands, say, "God
[42:20] bless you."
[42:24] After 30 years, you already ought to
[42:25] know me by now. Praise the Lord.
[42:31] Daniel chapter 12. while we have you
[42:33] standing.
[42:38] Verse one.
[42:42] And at that time shall Michael stand up
[42:45] the great prince.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Which standeth for the children of thy
[42:49] people.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; And there shall be a time of trouble
[42:52] such as never was since there was a
[42:54] nation even to that same time. And at
[42:58] that time thy people shall be delivered.
[43:00] Everyone that shall be found written in
[43:02] the book, and many of them that sleep in
[43:05] the dust of the earth shall awake, some
[43:07] to everlasting life, and some to shame
[43:10] and everlasting contempt.
[43:13] And they that be wise shall shine as the
[43:16] brightness of the firmament, and they
[43:19] that turn many to righteousness as the
[43:22] stars forever and ever. Amen. But thou,
[43:26] oh Daniel, shut up the words, and seal
[43:29] the book, even to the time of the end.
[43:33] Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge
[43:35] shall be increased.
[43:37] Then I, Daniel, looked, and lo, I'm
[43:39] sorry. Then I, Daniel, looked, and
[43:41] behold, there stood other two, the one
[43:44] on this side of the bank of the river,
[43:46] and the other on that side of the bank
[43:48] of the river. And one said to the man
[43:51] clothed in linen, which was upon the
[43:53] waters of the river, this represented
[43:55] the Holy Ghost, the one on the water,
[43:58] "How long shall it be to the end of
[44:00] these wonders?" He's the only one that
[44:02] would know. And I heard the man clothed
[44:04] in linen, which was upon the waters of
[44:07] the river, when he held up his right
[44:09] hand, and his left hand unto heaven, and
[44:12] swear by him that liveth forever, that
[44:14] it shall be for a time, times, and half.
[44:20] And when he shall have accomplished to
[44:23] scatter the power of the holy people,
[44:25] all these things shall be finished. And
[44:29] I heard, but I understood not. Then said
[44:32] I, oh Lord, what shall be the end of
[44:35] these things? And he said, Go thy way,
[44:37] Daniel, for the words are closed up and
[44:40] sealed to the time of the end. Many
[44:43] shall be purified and made white and
[44:46] tried, but the wicked shall do wickedly,
[44:49] and none of the wicked shall understand,
[44:51] but the wise shall understand.
[44:55] And from the time that the daily
[44:57] sacrifice shall be taken away, and the
[45:01] abomination that maketh desolations
[45:03] desolate setup, there shall be a,290
[45:07] days. Blessed is he that waiteth and
[45:10] cometh to the,35
[45:14] and30 days. But go thou thy way till the
[45:18] end be for thou shalt rest and stand in
[45:21] thy lot at the end of thy days. At the
[45:25] end of the days. May the Lord bless the
[45:28] reading of his word. You can be seated.
[45:32] I covet your prayers this morning. We
[45:34] are
[45:36] moving into
[45:38] um a point that is very very dear to me
[45:41] and I I really want to be very clear on
[45:44] it and uh I believe that the Lord will
[45:47] help us. Do you believe that?
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm quite sure that he will. Amen.
[45:53] Praise the Lord. Let me get my ducks in
[45:55] a row here. All right.
[45:59] So, we're reading, of course, about the
[46:01] consummation of all things and and um
[46:05] Daniel is an amazing book. Probably I I
[46:09] think I heard a figure that at more than
[46:12] 3/4 of the book of Revelation
[46:15] quote and or referred directly from the
[46:18] book of Daniel. And so, it is u it is an
[46:21] incredible thing, brother. And he's he's
[46:23] he's hearing about the end of uh his
[46:27] people, the coming of the kingdom. This
[46:29] was always a question. You remember the
[46:31] disciples, people were gathering around
[46:33] Jesus, you know, with the belief that if
[46:36] you be the Messiah, then uh let us make
[46:39] you a king. And Jesus was certainly
[46:42] going to be a king, but all things had
[46:44] to be in the right time sequence. That's
[46:47] a super important point. You can't God
[46:50] don't run ahead of himself. He doesn't
[46:52] allow history or the future to run ahead
[46:55] of his plan. If he does, he will speed
[46:58] up and drop back to adjust. And because
[47:01] the because one of the problems that the
[47:03] Lord runs into is not that nature runs
[47:07] ahead of him, but mankind is always
[47:09] trying to run ahead of him. He started
[47:11] in the Garden of Eden when he tried to
[47:13] run ahead of the plan. And so, we're
[47:16] realizing that God uh makes the
[47:18] adjustment as he goes along. You have to
[47:20] appreciate that prophecy is happening in
[47:23] real time. It's happening right while
[47:26] you live. That's not new. That's not
[47:27] novel or unique. That's the way it's
[47:29] always been. And so as the prophecy
[47:33] unfolded, then it became clear they, you
[47:37] know, you remember brother Brandham
[47:38] would say things like, you know, how
[47:40] that that you know, scholars, they
[47:42] argued over Isaiah's prophecy for more
[47:45] than seven centuries, 712 years to be
[47:49] precise. They argued over what Isaiah's
[47:52] prophecy could mean. a virgin shall
[47:54] conceive. And but brother Brandham would
[47:57] say when God got ready and it wasn't
[48:00] that they didn't have opinions and
[48:01] sermons and doctrines, but when God got
[48:04] ready to actually interpret it himself,
[48:07] he just brought it to pass and the
[48:09] manifestation was the interpretation.
[48:12] Just the same way Mark 16, you know,
[48:15] that the church was given a commission
[48:17] to go into all the world, preach the
[48:18] gospel to every creature. These signs
[48:20] shall follow them that believe and my
[48:22] name they shall cast out devils. They'll
[48:24] lay hands on the sick. See, and they'll
[48:26] recover. And so they argued in this day,
[48:29] what does that mean? How do we interpret
[48:30] that? And brother Brandham, you know,
[48:32] oh, it must have been for a past day.
[48:33] And brother Brandham would just say,
[48:35] look, when when God interprets his word,
[48:38] he interprets it by manifesting it. And
[48:41] so the manifestation is the inarguable
[48:44] interpretation. You can argue all day
[48:47] long with the Greek and the Hebrew and
[48:48] your opinion of this and opinion of
[48:49] that. But in the face of manifestation,
[48:52] all your theory falls down.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; So, so this is why we are we are not
[48:58] just, you know, our message to the world
[49:01] is not merely what God has said, but
[49:04] what God has done.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; And not merely what he has done, but
[49:07] what he is doing.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; And what because what he has done has
[49:12] led to what he's doing. and what he's
[49:14] doing will lead to what he's going to
[49:15] do.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; And so I want to know what's happened. I
[49:18] want to know what's happening. And I
[49:20] want to know what's going to happen.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of that because we
[49:24] have come to the consummation of the
[49:26] ages.
[49:28] Daniel was told it would be a day like
[49:30] no other. We know the tribulation time
[49:32] will be such a world uh when the world
[49:35] order will collapse. And the world is
[49:37] not ending, just the world order is
[49:39] ending. And I don't want to get
[49:40] sidetracked on that today. I have a
[49:42] sermon I'm working on concerning the
[49:44] world order. We won't get there today,
[49:46] but we realize that that the world is
[49:50] transitioning. And I I hate to use this
[49:52] term because it's been coined in
[49:54] conspiracy theory. Uh but but but it is
[49:58] true. There is coming a new world order.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; And it's really not about Illuminati.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; There is a new world order that's
[50:07] actually not just coming. It's already
[50:10] starting to transition and it's already
[50:13] moving in and that is one of the things
[50:16] that was prophesied to happen when the
[50:19] mystery of God would be uh understood at
[50:22] the end time. So, you know, we have an
[50:25] explanation for the madness that we see
[50:27] in the world, the impossibilities that
[50:30] we face in this unprecedented time. You
[50:33] live, and I've said it before, you live
[50:36] in a in an a a a a perverse age the
[50:41] likes of which has have never been faced
[50:44] &gt;&gt; by any age. We have so many things that
[50:48] are unprecedented in human history and I
[50:52] could just say Bible history because
[50:54] Bible history starts with human history
[50:56] and it goes all the way back predates
[50:58] human beings walking on the earth. Of
[51:00] course, Adam was in the in God, but then
[51:03] God put him in the flesh. And the Bible
[51:06] records how it all got started, how it
[51:08] all went wrong, and how God has repaired
[51:12] it, and how he has given a plan of
[51:15] redemption for all for whomsoever would
[51:18] like to have it. Uh salvation can be had
[51:23] by any sincere heart. Now, we know
[51:25] salvation and redemption are are
[51:28] different in some ways. redemption is
[51:30] the next level of of salvation. We know
[51:33] that there will be millions in glory who
[51:35] are saved from destruction, granted
[51:38] eternal life. That's inarguable in the
[51:40] Bible. But we also know that there was a
[51:43] a section in the lamb's book of life of
[51:45] election whose whose members were in God
[51:48] and part of God before the foundation of
[51:50] the world. That is just as inarguable.
[51:54] So we we realize that we are facing a
[51:58] perverse age uh never faced by any age.
[52:01] It's it's it's broken all previous
[52:03] records. We have uh you know Satan. I
[52:07] mean look I I would just say that we are
[52:09] facing an age that was not faced by any
[52:12] of the Old Testament saints including
[52:14] the Anidolivian world.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Say well but every man's mind was evil
[52:18] continually. Okay I get it. But that was
[52:20] just the days of Noah. But in Abraham's
[52:23] time, he had to face the days of Lot and
[52:26] and Sodomy uh beginning to take root.
[52:29] But our day, we face both of those
[52:31] simultaneously in their
[52:33] &gt;&gt; zenithmen
[52:34] &gt;&gt; globally.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; And so so we realize that it's uh you
[52:39] know even even in the days of Jesus, you
[52:42] face a darker day than the days that
[52:45] Jesus faced.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; I only got sister Jean amening that.
[52:50] Come on.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; You face. You fa Jesus warned the church
[52:55] about the day coming
[52:57] &gt;&gt; and said, you know, in me you'll have
[52:59] tribulation. Here was his words of
[53:01] comfort. Be of good cheer. I've overcome
[53:03] the world.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; See, so this is why he would implore his
[53:10] church that and he would warn them to
[53:12] say, remember that only in me can you
[53:16] accomplish anything.
[53:18] Now, there's there's people who the
[53:21] world is filled with people who
[53:22] accomplish amazing things. But let me
[53:26] just say it like this. If you want to
[53:28] accomplish something that counts
[53:31] &gt;&gt; eternally, then you better be in Christ.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Because you can say, well, I might
[53:36] accomplish getting the whole world. I
[53:39] might accomplish ruling heavens and
[53:41] earth. Heavens and earth will pass away.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; But only the word of God will remain.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you want to find your place
[53:49] trusting in the word. We face an age
[53:53] worse. It was not faced by Jesus. It was
[53:55] not faced by his disciples. Uh Satan at
[53:59] that time had only had 4,000 years to
[54:01] rebuild his Eden. So, brother Brandon
[54:04] when he comes to Satan's Eden, the God
[54:05] of this evil age, and different
[54:07] messages, and he points uh he says, you
[54:09] know, now just like God took 6,000 years
[54:13] to build his Eden, now Satan's had 6,000
[54:15] years to build his. So now, uh and then
[54:19] and then he goes into Paul's teaching
[54:21] about how that, you know, there's coming
[54:23] a time, a perilous time, and there's
[54:25] going to be a man of sin revealed, and
[54:27] the end can't come until all that has
[54:29] been manifested. And and so, Brother
[54:32] Brandham goes back to show in in the God
[54:35] of this evil age where Satan would
[54:38] actually accomplish his vision that he
[54:40] had been trying to accomplish for 6,000
[54:43] years and couldn't get it done until the
[54:44] last day.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; And that is that he would be worshiped
[54:48] like God and he would be the worshiped
[54:51] being. And even to even under such a
[54:54] deception that millions and perhaps
[54:58] billions would sit in Christian churches
[55:02] and worship and believe they're
[55:04] worshiping God and they're actually
[55:06] worshiping Satan.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Paul referred to him as another Jesus
[55:13] whom we have not preached. And it's a
[55:16] concoction of man-made theory and
[55:18] Satan's right in the middle of it. So,
[55:21] so we realize that we are living in a
[55:24] time and I I want to say this also.
[55:27] We're living in a time far more perverse
[55:29] even than the days of William Brandham.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; You have now reached a point where
[55:37] Isaiah 60 is fully made manifest.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; That darkness now covers the entire
[55:45] world. Remember that before America
[55:48] rejected the gospel for the last time in
[55:51] 1956, there was still a blessing in
[55:53] light.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Because the gospel had traveled from the
[55:56] east to the west. Once America, the last
[55:59] western culture all the way to the west
[56:01] coast where Isuza fell. After that,
[56:03] you're going to start heading back east
[56:05] again. You're going to find that once
[56:07] that happened and uh Christ was
[56:10] crucified the second time, indicted by a
[56:13] prophet, then Isaiah 60 was in full
[56:16] steam. They had rejected the opening of
[56:19] the seals, which was not knowledge.
[56:23] The opening of the seals was Christ.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; You're going to want to really remember
[56:29] that. I'm choosing my words with great
[56:32] care today because when you when you
[56:35] when you think of the book and we go to
[56:39] the book of revelation and there's a
[56:40] closed book and there's one they're
[56:42] they're calling let whoever's worthy
[56:44] come and then we find that a worthy one
[56:46] stepped from eternities and took the
[56:48] book.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; You you you need you're going to need to
[56:51] realize that a lot of what John is
[56:54] seeing is in symbol form. So don't don't
[56:57] think of a a leatherbound book filled
[57:01] with paper pages.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandon would say Christ
[57:08] broke those seals off of himself.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; One place he said he broke them out of
[57:13] himself.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; So we realize that it's and brother
[57:16] Brandham is going to be making it very
[57:18] clear that it's Christ. It's the word.
[57:20] It's the revelation of of Christ
[57:23] &gt;&gt; that had parts of which had been hidden
[57:25] down through the ages only partially
[57:28] revealed until it gets to the end time
[57:30] and the full disclosure
[57:32] &gt;&gt; with everything else that makes now
[57:34] makes sense. Now we understand why they
[57:37] rejected Christ, why it went into Isaiah
[57:40] 60. Now darkness is covering the whole
[57:41] earth. Why a prophet would indict them.
[57:44] Why why in denominationalism that leads
[57:47] to the mark of the beast. Now we
[57:49] understand why that is. You see? So we
[57:52] understand exactly who the man of sin is
[57:54] and we understand exactly what the image
[57:56] to the beast is is. We understand the
[57:59] false prophet the red dragon. We get all
[58:01] of that. We understand the ages.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; See? So so now we're we're we're
[58:06] actually this is why brother Brandon
[58:08] would say you're feeding on the body
[58:10] word not of a man but the body word of
[58:13] the son of man. Because those seals were
[58:15] broken off of him. now. And now you've
[58:18] been called to the feast of the lamb.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Which which if you eat at this feast,
[58:24] you'll eat at that feast.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; You'll eat at my father's table.
[58:28] Hallelujah, friends. That's the one I'm
[58:30] looking for.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; So, you are eating your way to a body
[58:34] change to have a body like unto his
[58:37] glorious body.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; So, we see Satan's Eden. We see he's the
[58:41] god of this age. We see darkness around
[58:42] the world. see men's minds uh completely
[58:46] covered over in darkness. But brother
[58:49] Brandham comes here in 1964 and sir, we
[58:52] would see Jesus. Let me have my title
[58:54] slide. Brother Mark, by the way, I'll go
[58:56] ahead and get that up and running and
[58:57] make sure that I'm operational.
[59:00] Turn it off. Turn it on. Okay, I think
[59:02] that should work. Perfect. Okay, so I
[59:06] don't have this quote here on purpose. I
[59:08] just want to read it to you. So now we
[59:10] we talk about how wicked and how dark
[59:13] and how evil we are. And we have a
[59:16] darker day than Jesus had, a darker day
[59:19] than the church through the ages had, a
[59:21] darker day than William Brandham had to
[59:24] experience. But brother Brandham would
[59:26] come around and say, "There is nothing
[59:28] wrong."
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Everything is going to turn out all
[59:33] right.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Don't be scared. I'm so glad. Amen.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that after he comes with an
[59:40] indictment and it sounds like it's
[59:42] hopeless. After he preaches souls in
[59:44] prison and scares everybody to death,
[59:46] including his own self, he comes around
[59:48] and says, "Don't be scared. God's big
[59:51] time piece is ticking right along. It'll
[59:54] be there. It'll have a church without
[59:57] spot or wrinkle." It was in his
[1:00:00] thinking.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:03] So, we see
[1:00:06] terrible signs of the time around the
[1:00:09] world. We've talked about some of them.
[1:00:12] We've identified events made clear in
[1:00:14] prophecy that have been in the past.
[1:00:16] We've
[1:00:18] talked about the present day. We can we
[1:00:20] could sit here and I could make this
[1:00:21] whole thing a a teaching on prophecy
[1:00:23] about, you know, what are we looking for
[1:00:25] in the Antichrist and the money and the
[1:00:27] sellout and the and the and the false
[1:00:29] prophet, how it's going to take over and
[1:00:30] how it's going to control this. Uh, you
[1:00:32] know, I'm not here just to fill you with
[1:00:34] knowledge today.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Because that's not that that'll actually
[1:00:38] harm you if you don't know the person.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. See,
[1:00:43] George Baros is the Russia team and
[1:00:48] geospatial intelligence team lead at the
[1:00:50] Institute for the Study of War.
[1:00:53] His work focuses on Russian information
[1:00:56] operations, the Kremlin's operational
[1:00:58] art and the campaign design in Ukraine
[1:01:00] and Bellarus,
[1:01:02] as well as Ukrainian politics. He he
[1:01:04] himself is uh I believe Ukrainian. He's
[1:01:07] a he's an expert. He regularly briefs
[1:01:11] senior military and political decision
[1:01:13] makers and his work has been featured in
[1:01:17] various media outlets including the
[1:01:19] Hill, the Washington Post, the BBC and
[1:01:22] Routers.
[1:01:24] He makes this statement very recently
[1:01:28] in terms of the global situation. I read
[1:01:31] you his credentials so you know this
[1:01:33] ain't just somebody in a basement with a
[1:01:35] YouTube channel,
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:01:38] in terms of the global situation.
[1:01:41] We are in a 1937
[1:01:44] moment on the global scale. Now that's
[1:01:47] just as the second woe was starting to
[1:01:50] ramp up
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; and bring Hitler had already been years
[1:01:54] as chancellor according to prophet's
[1:01:56] vision and now things are beginning to
[1:01:58] move forward. And he's he's he's he's
[1:02:01] juxtaposing World War II with what he
[1:02:04] believes is about to be World War II.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; And so he says we have once again come
[1:02:09] to a moment. We are in a 1937 moment on
[1:02:14] the global scale. Our adversaries are
[1:02:17] teaming at the door. They sense blood in
[1:02:20] the water. They sense opportunity.
[1:02:24] War is tragic.
[1:02:27] I when I read this, I just thought, my
[1:02:29] goodness, war is tragic.
[1:02:33] I'm sorry. War is a tragic and
[1:02:36] inevitable part of the human experience.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:42] We are overdue for another big global
[1:02:46] war. Really?
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; This is the man who briefs the military.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; This period of 80 years of relative
[1:02:55] stability and global peace that we have
[1:02:58] had since 1945 to the present has been
[1:03:01] an anomaly in the human experience.
[1:03:04] And we need to prepare for the worstc
[1:03:07] case scenarios moving into the future.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:13] When I read that, I could almost feel
[1:03:16] nervous for me, for you, for my
[1:03:19] children. What's the world going to
[1:03:21] face? But then I come back around and
[1:03:23] now listen to it again. There is nothing
[1:03:25] wrong. Everything is going to turn out
[1:03:28] all right. Don't be scared. God's big
[1:03:31] time piece is ticking right along. It'll
[1:03:33] be there. It'll have a church without
[1:03:35] spot or wrinkle. It was in his thinking.
[1:03:37] You were in his thinking. I'm in his
[1:03:39] thinking. Hallelujah.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; So, so, okay. So, we're at a 37 moment
[1:03:44] and maybe World War II is by 27. Who can
[1:03:48] say? I don't know. He's not trying to
[1:03:50] say. But what he is saying is this 80
[1:03:52] years, don't get used to it because it's
[1:03:54] an anomaly.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; It's not. It doesn't match history.
[1:04:05] a friend of mine who's a pastor, very
[1:04:08] well-known, very good friend of mine, my
[1:04:09] family. We've we've been discussing for
[1:04:12] a number of days some things and
[1:04:16] he told me one time he he I made a
[1:04:18] statement to him and he told me the next
[1:04:20] day he said, "Hey buddy," he said the
[1:04:22] next he said, "I yesterday in the pull
[1:04:24] pit," he said, "I I unabashedly quoted
[1:04:27] you verbatim and I didn't even name drop
[1:04:28] you." He said, "I took all the credit."
[1:04:30] And so, so I wrote him this morning. I
[1:04:33] said, "Hey, I'm getting ready to quote
[1:04:34] you verbatim because the statement you
[1:04:36] sent to me, I can't improve on it, and
[1:04:38] I'm pretty good at improving on
[1:04:39] statements. Writing is what I do best."
[1:04:42] But I I said, "This this needs no uh no
[1:04:45] improvement. Listen as I read."
[1:04:48] He says, "This seventh angel,
[1:04:51] the messenger to the Leodysian church
[1:04:54] age, does not come bringing new
[1:04:56] doctrines. He comes with a restoration
[1:04:59] of the original faith.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; The faith which was once delivered unto
[1:05:03] the saints according to Jude 1:3.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; His ministry does not add to Paul's
[1:05:08] gospel. It restores it.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; He brings back the apostolic message in
[1:05:13] power and clarity. I'm so glad
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; unveiling the mysteries that had been
[1:05:18] sealed within the book for generations.
[1:05:21] Yet it is undeniable. This is where this
[1:05:25] is where our discussion has been. Yet it
[1:05:27] is undeniable that more has been
[1:05:29] revealed in this age, not by
[1:05:32] contradiction to Paul, but as the
[1:05:34] unfolding of what was already there
[1:05:37] hidden beneath centuries of creeds and
[1:05:39] traditions.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; See, so that so so it's a fine line
[1:05:45] between saying that this message isn't
[1:05:48] anything new. It's only a restoration of
[1:05:50] what Paul said, which is a thousand%
[1:05:52] correct. But at the same time, you're
[1:05:55] going to understand this morning that
[1:05:56] God unveils his word. God operates on a
[1:06:00] need to know basis.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; And he unveils his word according to the
[1:06:03] time and the season. You understand?
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; So, so, so we find that you can go back
[1:06:09] to Paul, but you don't find Paul
[1:06:11] teaching on Daniel 70 weeks.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; You know why? It wasn't relative to
[1:06:15] them. You don't find Paul even talking
[1:06:19] that brother Brandham said that the all
[1:06:21] I mean all the gospel is built on the
[1:06:23] foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[1:06:25] Is that what the Bible says?
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; But you don't find them talking about
[1:06:29] the seven church ages. And even when
[1:06:31] John comes with it in a book, it's all
[1:06:33] sealed and nobody even knows what it
[1:06:35] means. And brother Brandham said God
[1:06:37] wouldn't let them know
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; that there was going to be 2,000 years
[1:06:41] and seven ages and he wasn't coming
[1:06:43] imminently because that would have
[1:06:45] destroyed their expectancy and their
[1:06:46] zeal. You understand? So God wouldn't
[1:06:48] even let them know that. And so at the
[1:06:50] end time now that it's relevant now a
[1:06:53] prophet comes and goes back to cover
[1:06:55] things Paul never needed to cover.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; We've come through seven ages and it
[1:06:59] went into the dark ages and it came out
[1:07:01] under Luther Wesley. It's the
[1:07:02] restoration of the bride. They never
[1:07:04] knew the bride tree was going in the
[1:07:06] earth, going into the ground. They never
[1:07:08] knew it was going to die and be buried.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; See, they were certainly on their way to
[1:07:14] the rapture. They had the abstract
[1:07:16] title. They had the token. They had the
[1:07:17] ministry of the son of man. They had the
[1:07:19] perfect word.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; And they were on their way, but that
[1:07:22] church backslid as the apostles died
[1:07:24] away. It backslid. And we find then that
[1:07:27] that that that the church backslid. And
[1:07:30] then history goes along and now it's
[1:07:31] ages and now there's seven messengers.
[1:07:33] And no one knew that seven spirits of
[1:07:36] God or the seven human messengers sent
[1:07:38] into the church in each age. Wait, huh?
[1:07:40] What? What? What did you say about an
[1:07:42] age? A messenger? A spirit? Huh? What
[1:07:43] are you talking about?
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you I if if you would
[1:07:47] go back there and preach this kind of
[1:07:49] reality that's true cuz we know it's
[1:07:52] happened. They would go, "What are you
[1:07:54] talking about?" All right.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; We just heard the apostles say, "He
[1:07:59] that's coming will not tarry." You're
[1:08:00] talking 20 centuries minimally.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; And in fact is we're going to be in the
[1:08:05] 21st century after you. And it's still
[1:08:09] not happened.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; So, so you have to realize then that
[1:08:13] it's not But here's here's the beauty of
[1:08:15] it. This is why you don't hear the
[1:08:17] Apostle Paul quoting from the book of
[1:08:19] Revelation because he was already dead
[1:08:21] and gone when John comes back with it.
[1:08:23] So the mysteries are starting to be
[1:08:25] sealed up more and more and more down
[1:08:26] through the ages. You can go all the way
[1:08:28] into Iranius and you still find the
[1:08:31] truth of the godhead. Perfect. Brother
[1:08:32] Ram said he was the last one.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; He had a clear understanding of the
[1:08:36] godhead. And then after that, by the
[1:08:37] time you get to Martin, it's already
[1:08:39] faded. Then Colombia, it's way faded.
[1:08:41] And then after Colombia, you're going
[1:08:42] into the dark ages in 606 because now it
[1:08:46] wasn't just na at 3:25. Uh that's where
[1:08:49] that was that that the whole thing was
[1:08:51] spawned. But it actually took till 606
[1:08:55] until finally they crown a false
[1:08:57] prophet, set him on a throne at the seat
[1:08:58] of Jezebel. And now and now you go into
[1:09:01] a thousand years of dark ages.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; And not until Luther comes along with a
[1:09:06] single revelation. You know how he
[1:09:08] caught that revelation? A seal partially
[1:09:11] opened.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; And dropped a mystery and a messenger
[1:09:14] caught it. The early church wouldn't
[1:09:16] have understood that kind of lingo.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; But here's the beauty of it. When a
[1:09:22] prophet comes and preaches the opening
[1:09:24] of the seals, everything he preaches
[1:09:27] agrees with everything Paul taught.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; So, we have a more sure word of
[1:09:33] prophecy. Just like Peter could say, the
[1:09:36] you guys, you Jews, y'all understood
[1:09:39] that Messiah was coming and you had a
[1:09:41] word of prophecy that he was coming.
[1:09:42] Well, guess what? We've had the word of
[1:09:44] the prophecy made more sure to us cuz we
[1:09:46] know he came.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; See, so they had all that prophecy, but
[1:09:51] today you have a more sure word of
[1:09:53] prophecy than the early church had. You
[1:09:56] get that? Does that make sense to you?
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; It's not a We didn't need an eighth age
[1:10:01] or an eighth messenger to tell us these
[1:10:03] things. It's just recognizing where we
[1:10:05] are in prophecy, where we are and what
[1:10:08] God has done in this hour. And the only
[1:10:10] messenger after Elijah was you and me.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit in the bride
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; is the final voice.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; So he goes on, my friend, yet it is
[1:10:24] undeniable that more has been revealed
[1:10:26] in this age, not by contradiction to
[1:10:28] Paul, but as the unfolding of what was
[1:10:31] already there, hidden beneath centuries
[1:10:33] of creeds and traditions. We now
[1:10:35] understand the seven church ages and
[1:10:37] their messengers. We've been shown the
[1:10:39] mystery of the Antichrist spirit working
[1:10:41] through the ages. The man of sin, the
[1:10:43] beast, the false prophet, things that
[1:10:45] had not yet occurred in Paul's day, but
[1:10:47] which the spirit had made known has made
[1:10:50] known in this final hour.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Now, they were prophesied. Jesus
[1:10:54] prophesied about it.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; It was in the book of Revelation, but it
[1:10:58] was all hidden under mystery.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; You follow that? See, now you can say,
[1:11:03] "Well,
[1:11:05] maybe Paul knew more than we realized.
[1:11:08] Maybe he did
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; if he knew. He didn't say
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; if he knew about the ages. He was caught
[1:11:13] up to the third heaven.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; He was caught. He saw what John saw in
[1:11:17] the throne room. And he said, he said,
[1:11:19] "There's things I heard I can't even
[1:11:21] repeat. It's not even lawful to repeat."
[1:11:23] See?
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; So, so, so if he knew, he didn't say.
[1:11:27] Brother Ram said, "God don't always tell
[1:11:28] his prophets everything, and his
[1:11:29] prophets don't always tell the people
[1:11:30] everything."
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; So, so that that's really not not the
[1:11:34] point. The point is now that the book
[1:11:36] has been unsealed. So he says, "So, uh,
[1:11:40] but now through the ministry of the
[1:11:42] seventh angel, the seals have been, or
[1:11:44] wait a minute, down through the ages,
[1:11:45] that antichrist spirit steadily closed
[1:11:48] the book, wrapping the truth in layers
[1:11:51] of man-made theology. But now, and it
[1:11:53] finally led to the dark ages. But now
[1:11:56] through the ministry of the seventh
[1:11:58] angel, and I might add, through the
[1:12:00] ministry of the fifth and sixth and
[1:12:02] seventh angel, because that's where the
[1:12:03] restoration began. But now through the
[1:12:06] to to the culmination of it, we find
[1:12:09] that through the ministry of the seventh
[1:12:11] angel, the seals have been loosed. The
[1:12:14] book has been unsealed. And we've been
[1:12:17] brought back not to something new, but
[1:12:19] to what Paul had, the original word,
[1:12:21] restored and revealed in its fullness.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; We have returned to the land, I love
[1:12:26] this. We have returned to the land of
[1:12:28] the Bible, to the landmarks of truth
[1:12:31] that Paul laid down. Not one word added,
[1:12:34] not one word taken away. The same
[1:12:36] gospel, the same mysteries, no longer
[1:12:38] hidden in shadow, but shining in the
[1:12:41] full light of this bright age.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; I just say amen.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; We've learned in our series about an
[1:12:50] intrinsic nature uh that li that comes
[1:12:53] from God that is in his offspring. You,
[1:12:57] you know, and brother Brandon would use
[1:12:58] the natural typing, the spiritual. There
[1:13:00] are so many things that the older I get,
[1:13:02] the more I remind my own self of my dad.
[1:13:05] I didn't used to see that when I was
[1:13:07] younger, I thought I was so much more
[1:13:08] handsome than him that I
[1:13:11] but but but these days, you know, and
[1:13:14] sister Debbie doesn't help matter. She's
[1:13:15] all the time going, "You're just like
[1:13:16] your daddy." Now, she's meaning it as a
[1:13:19] compliment, not as an insult. And I'm
[1:13:21] going, "Wow, really? Thank you." It puts
[1:13:22] a smile on my face. Sometimes I'll catch
[1:13:24] myself sitting with my hands a certain
[1:13:27] gesture or I'll be sitting eating
[1:13:28] thinking and I'll be doing the same
[1:13:30] expression he was doing. So it's it's
[1:13:32] intrinsic to me. It's innate. I got it
[1:13:35] from him. It's a passed down thing. You
[1:13:37] understand? So, we realize then, as I
[1:13:40] said to you in a previous uh
[1:13:43] installment,
[1:13:45] Brother Brandon would show us that in
[1:13:48] order to get the understanding of the
[1:13:50] water baptism, all you need to be able
[1:13:52] to do is read.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; It doesn't even require a revelation if
[1:13:56] you can just read. And that's read the
[1:13:58] Bible and read history or put them
[1:14:00] together. They all declare the same
[1:14:01] thing. And he and he goes on to talk
[1:14:04] about the original sin of the serpent's
[1:14:06] seed. And brother Brandon would say a
[1:14:08] 12-year-old child could understand it.
[1:14:10] It's so clear. And it is. And we've
[1:14:12] proven how clear it is. And so we've did
[1:14:15] that publicly. And so, but now when it
[1:14:17] comes to the Godhead, even when you it's
[1:14:20] so um it's so vast a topic that even
[1:14:25] within the revelation, a mystery
[1:14:28] remains. See, now that's that's a
[1:14:30] Scofield statement that brother Brandham
[1:14:32] endorsed and repeated that even he read
[1:14:35] it from Scofield's notes and and he
[1:14:38] endorsed it on on tape. So even within
[1:14:40] the mystery, that's how amazing it is.
[1:14:42] That's why we can never fully grasp the
[1:14:46] the book of life on this side cuz that's
[1:14:48] on that side. It's in another realm and
[1:14:51] it's the God's person. Hallelujah.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So it requires revelation to even
[1:14:59] get to the level of understanding that
[1:15:01] will give you redemption.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Because there because you have to have
[1:15:06] that to in order to come to redemption
[1:15:08] because that's the requirement of this
[1:15:09] age. It wasn't in the other ages. Christ
[1:15:11] was in the eternities winking at their
[1:15:13] ignorance. They didn't understand that.
[1:15:14] Luther didn't understand it. Wesley
[1:15:16] didn't. Many of the Isuza fathers. Great
[1:15:18] men of God. I think of Wigglesworth.
[1:15:20] What a great man of God. So powerful and
[1:15:22] yet prayed to a thrice god. I think of
[1:15:24] Arthur Pink, a beautiful mind. No, I
[1:15:26] mean, so so astute in the word of God
[1:15:28] and yet prayed to the thrice God.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; I think of I think of Spurgeon and all
[1:15:33] these different ones and they didn't
[1:15:35] understand these not three people.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; See, and brother Brandham was coming in
[1:15:40] the last day because the open door was
[1:15:42] set between the end of the sixth and
[1:15:44] opening of the seventh and it was going
[1:15:46] to be a restoration of the deity of
[1:15:48] Jesus Christ. That's why I believe the
[1:15:50] first sermon we have recorded is 1949,
[1:15:52] the deity of Jesus Christ. And so,
[1:15:55] Brother Brandon would not just show that
[1:15:57] he's one. That's not what the seventh
[1:16:00] seal stopped at. That's because the
[1:16:03] oneness understood. Now, they had a
[1:16:05] misunderstanding of how he's one and and
[1:16:07] and and so brother Brandon would say,
[1:16:10] "Well, the oneness are wrong and the
[1:16:11] trinitarians are wrong." But but what
[1:16:13] came to us under the seventh seal was
[1:16:16] the true revelation of how he's one by
[1:16:19] expression. He keeps expressing himself
[1:16:21] in new forms. It doesn't make him
[1:16:22] multiple people. It's just God changing
[1:16:25] his mask. And the beauty of it was that
[1:16:28] just like Christ came out of God, he was
[1:16:30] the word and that word was made flesh.
[1:16:33] And then that word, the life in that
[1:16:34] word now lives in us. And now the bride
[1:16:36] becomes part of the godhead.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; That's what the seventh seal broke to
[1:16:41] us. Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; That you are actually part of. And
[1:16:44] brother Brandham uses that kind of
[1:16:46] language in a number of places. How that
[1:16:49] we're literally we're literally seen in
[1:16:51] the in the trinity in the in the three
[1:16:54] uh father, son, and holy ghost. That's
[1:16:55] right on tape. And that brother Brandon
[1:16:58] would talk about any son and daughter of
[1:17:00] God that's born again of the spirit of
[1:17:01] God that you are in Godhead. You are in
[1:17:04] God's godhead.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; And that's the beauty. That's what
[1:17:08] that's what separates us. We're not
[1:17:09] we're not following cunningly devised
[1:17:11] tales. We never followed a man. We're
[1:17:13] not feeding on a man. We we it the
[1:17:16] Godhead has been revealed to us and we
[1:17:18] found out he's always been the word and
[1:17:21] I've always been a part of that and
[1:17:23] that's why I believe it.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; That's why I can't not believe it.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:17:30] so the only way re we can receive the
[1:17:33] revelation of the Godhead is because we
[1:17:36] are a part of the Godhead. Amen.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; So the revelation of it is intrinsic to
[1:17:41] you being of a gene of God.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; This is why those whose names are not in
[1:17:46] the section of election can never catch
[1:17:49] the full revelation of any age.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Whatever at whatever level it was, you
[1:17:55] had to be part of that original fabric
[1:17:57] of God Almighty.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:01] So its truth then is intrinsic to us as
[1:18:04] after the new birth and it becomes
[1:18:06] self-evident at our conversion because
[1:18:09] it gives us a real and life-changing
[1:18:12] experience. And if it doesn't give you a
[1:18:13] real life-changing experience and it
[1:18:15] hasn't become a revelation to you yet.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; It's not to insult you. That's to help
[1:18:20] you.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; See, so this is why brother Brandon
[1:18:23] would say we reflect the spirit of the
[1:18:25] world of our rebirth. This is why you're
[1:18:28] an alien. This is why you live in a
[1:18:31] world you seem unfitted to live in.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Here's why.
[1:18:36] Um, in Revelation 15:3 it says, "And
[1:18:39] they sang the song of Moses, the servant
[1:18:42] of God, and the song of the Lamb,
[1:18:44] saying, Great and marvelous are thy
[1:18:46] works, Lord God Almighty. Just and true
[1:18:50] are thy ways, thou King of saints."
[1:18:53] The lamb, the high priest holding his
[1:18:55] blood as an atonement
[1:18:59] on the mercy seat for our sins is the
[1:19:03] Lord God Almighty. Now, I'm not sure how
[1:19:05] I didn't get it this little last
[1:19:07] sentence in here. I I think I was
[1:19:08] transitioning between screens. It's not
[1:19:10] here. But he goes on to say, he says,
[1:19:14] um, "His blood as an atonement on the
[1:19:16] mercy seat for our sins is the Lord God
[1:19:19] Almighty." That is his present office.
[1:19:23] That is what he's doing now, pleading
[1:19:26] his blood for our sins. So don't let
[1:19:29] somebody tell you that because the seals
[1:19:32] are open and the presence of Christ is
[1:19:34] among us that we no longer have an
[1:19:36] advocate.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Because this is what he's doing now.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; See, and I get that someday we won't
[1:19:43] need an advocate. But I'm sure glad I
[1:19:45] got one right now.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:49] But one day the lamb will become the
[1:19:53] lion of the tribe of Judah. They say,
[1:19:56] "Well, I thought he was already John
[1:19:58] turned to see a lion and he saw a lamb.
[1:19:59] I thought the lion has already stepped
[1:20:01] forward." You understand? John is seeing
[1:20:02] symbols. And God is is going to play it
[1:20:05] out in time. You can't get too
[1:20:07] transfixed on the symbol and and and
[1:20:09] mess up your whole picture. You've got
[1:20:11] to take the whole flow of revelation.
[1:20:13] Watch. But one day the lamb will become
[1:20:16] the lion of the tribe of Judah. See that
[1:20:18] means he'll he is already the lamb. But
[1:20:22] that's not in effect yet to the Gentiles
[1:20:24] because we're still here.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; You understand? He is the l the lion.
[1:20:29] But right now he's a lamb interceding
[1:20:31] for you and I.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Thank God for that.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:20:37] He is he is the coming king. I'm sorry.
[1:20:41] But one day the lamb will become the
[1:20:43] line of the tribe of Judah. That means
[1:20:44] in effect he will come forth in power
[1:20:47] and glory and take his authority to
[1:20:48] reign as king. And see this is all in
[1:20:51] the millennium. He's coming king of the
[1:20:52] earth. Of course that does not say he is
[1:20:55] not king. Now you see how that goes back
[1:20:57] and forth. For he is our king, king of
[1:21:00] saints right now. It is a spiritual
[1:21:03] kingdom. You following me?
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; It is not of this world even as we are
[1:21:09] not of this world. That's the reason we
[1:21:12] act different from the world. Our
[1:21:14] citizenship is in heaven. We're nothing
[1:21:18] but a cult.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Did I read that wrong?
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Our That's the reason we act different
[1:21:27] from the world. Our citizenship is in
[1:21:31] heaven. And we have a a stringent list
[1:21:34] of dos and don'ts.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; If you make a mistake, we'll put you out
[1:21:39] of the message.
[1:21:43] It is not of this world the spiritual
[1:21:45] kingdom even as we are not of this
[1:21:48] world. That's the reason we act
[1:21:50] different from the world. Our
[1:21:52] citizenship is in heaven. We reflect the
[1:21:56] spirit of the world of our rebirth.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Where Jesus is the king already.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; I'm sitting together in heavenly places
[1:22:05] in Christ.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says, "This is why there
[1:22:12] here there here's the reason. This is
[1:22:14] why our women do not dress in men's
[1:22:16] clothing or cut their hair or use all
[1:22:19] those cosmetics and other things that
[1:22:21] the world likes so much. That is why our
[1:22:24] men don't drink and smoke and carry on
[1:22:26] in sin." Here's why. Our dominion is the
[1:22:30] dominion over sin. And it is enforced
[1:22:34] through the power that is that is the
[1:22:36] spirit of Christ that indwells us. Every
[1:22:39] kingdom on earth is going to be torn
[1:22:41] down but ours will remain.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; So brother Brennham comes now to we've
[1:22:52] been studying a lot from who is this
[1:22:53] Melzdc. You still with me?
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; All right. I'm doing good on time. I I'm
[1:22:58] going to make my mark today. It's going
[1:22:59] to be perfect.
[1:23:01] So he says,
[1:23:03] I won't get to everything I wanted to,
[1:23:04] but that's okay. I can see where I'm
[1:23:06] going to get. So he says, now we find
[1:23:09] him at the beginning, his attributes,
[1:23:14] and now this is what we've been taking
[1:23:16] service after service to drill into us.
[1:23:18] And now you were with him then. Then
[1:23:23] then is when the book of life comes into
[1:23:27] view.
[1:23:29] Then now he's talking about about God's
[1:23:33] person, how that you are in him. And now
[1:23:36] we're talking about the book of life.
[1:23:39] All right? Now remember, not a leather
[1:23:40] bound with paper pages. The the the
[1:23:43] mystery is Christ. He broke the seals
[1:23:46] off of himself. You understand?
[1:23:49] So it's not a leather bound book with
[1:23:51] paper pages. Remember, John is seeing
[1:23:53] symbols. So, brother Brandham, you know,
[1:23:56] and and and he and I've already told you
[1:23:57] the quote about breaking them off
[1:23:59] himself and even from within himself.
[1:24:01] So, so you don't So, let me just say the
[1:24:03] reason I'm emphasizing that is to say
[1:24:06] because of what it actually is, then you
[1:24:10] don't get to pick and choose when the
[1:24:12] book is sealed or open.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so it's it's been it's been
[1:24:19] closed and opened at various levels down
[1:24:23] through the ages. Let me point out to
[1:24:26] you that Christ began revealing parts of
[1:24:31] his mystery to Abel.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Right out of the garden.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; See, he went on from there to reveal
[1:24:38] himself to Enoch. He went right on there
[1:24:40] to reveal himself to Noah. He went right
[1:24:42] on from there to reveal himself to
[1:24:43] Abraham. And he and he goes on to pick
[1:24:46] up Moses. And then he says to Moses,
[1:24:48] "You're knowing me in a way Abraham
[1:24:49] didn't. I don't I wasn't known but to
[1:24:51] him by his Jehovah Gyra, even though he
[1:24:53] knew that's who I was. That's not how we
[1:24:55] rolled. That's not how I operated. But
[1:24:57] now I've got a family. I'm going to lead
[1:24:59] you out of Egypt in a first Exodus.
[1:25:01] There's going to be three of them. And
[1:25:03] the third one's going to take my gentile
[1:25:05] bride home to glory.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; The second one is going to lift him up
[1:25:09] out of a grave. and all those who died
[1:25:11] in faith are going to rise with him and
[1:25:13] empty out paradise.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; So he goes on to reveal himself to
[1:25:18] Abraham on and on and on. Then to the
[1:25:20] Jews he further reveals himself as
[1:25:23] Jesus.
[1:25:25] And then to the world he reveals himself
[1:25:28] through his church.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; You understand the plan was never for
[1:25:33] Jesus to get resurrected and go back to
[1:25:36] walking the shores of Galilee. Right.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; The plan was that I'll be with you, even
[1:25:40] in you, and that you will go into all
[1:25:42] the world and preach the gospel to every
[1:25:44] creature,
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the
[1:25:47] uttermost part of the earth. Then when
[1:25:48] this gospel has been preached in all the
[1:25:50] earth, the end will come.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; See, they didn't know it would be seven
[1:25:54] ages, but it would be.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; So, so, so it negates the question then.
[1:26:01] It it it totally makes a mood point of
[1:26:04] the question, was the book sealed to
[1:26:06] Paul? That's a mood point,
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; It completely negates that question
[1:26:11] because we're not talking about a
[1:26:12] leatherbound book.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the revelation of
[1:26:15] Almighty God revealing himself in stages
[1:26:18] down through the ages. See,
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; so none of the mystery of Christ I can
[1:26:23] tell you this that none of the mystery
[1:26:26] of Christ say, "Well, okay. Well, did
[1:26:28] then maybe Paul didn't understand Daniel
[1:26:30] 70 weeks. Maybe he didn't understand." I
[1:26:32] think Paul understood a lot more than we
[1:26:33] give him credit for. He understood the
[1:26:35] rapture in three phases. He understood
[1:26:37] who was Melzdc. And he had way more to
[1:26:40] say about Melzdc than he could write. He
[1:26:42] said, "I have much more to say, but
[1:26:43] you've already become dull of hearing."
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; He already understood that the rapture
[1:26:47] can't come till the man of sin be
[1:26:49] revealed.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; You understand? He knew he was a false
[1:26:52] prophet. Jesus had said that.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; So, so you but but here here's the
[1:26:58] bottom line. None of the mystery of
[1:27:01] Christ that was needed for his day, nor
[1:27:04] anything that would be necessary for
[1:27:06] redemption was ever hidden to Paul.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Nothing. He had the gospel of redemption
[1:27:14] for God's people that we are still
[1:27:16] reading from and standing on and basing
[1:27:19] every doctrine we have based on what he
[1:27:21] said.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; So yeah, and and not even in the ages.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:28] Because even even in the ages, the seals
[1:27:31] were being cracked open, partially open
[1:27:34] to release a mystery down to messengers
[1:27:37] in each age to give that age what was
[1:27:40] necessary. Not more, but just what was
[1:27:43] necessary for that age.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; You got that?
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; See, because it because what did you
[1:27:50] say? Necessary for what? Necessary, you
[1:27:52] know, so that they could so that they
[1:27:54] could uh be happy. The word in every age
[1:27:58] brought enough to enough necessary
[1:28:01] revelation for them to come to their
[1:28:05] pre-ordained
[1:28:06] uh order in God.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Everything that Christ had saw in
[1:28:11] position, John saw it. Oh my goodness,
[1:28:14] friends. And everything that God's
[1:28:15] family has ever been ordained to come to
[1:28:17] as a position in God, he's given it. And
[1:28:20] today, we have all that he's ever opened
[1:28:23] to this point. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Because this bride has to come to her
[1:28:32] position also as the final voice. So how
[1:28:35] could she do that if he's hidden part of
[1:28:37] the word from her?
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; See, so brother Brandon would would say,
[1:28:42] uh, let me see. Do I want to read? No,
[1:28:45] not not yet. All right. So I I didn't
[1:28:48] put this one up. Here is a questions and
[1:28:50] answers 1963.
[1:28:52] So now he says, "Brother Brown, I'm
[1:28:54] talking about this book." He says, "The
[1:28:56] book holds that mystery and the book is
[1:29:00] only unfolding it." Now, now watch what
[1:29:03] he says. He said, "Brother Jason
[1:29:05] thought, you said it's not a
[1:29:06] leatherbound book." Hold on. The book
[1:29:09] holds the mystery and the book is only
[1:29:12] unfolding it now. Not each one's name,
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; but what the mystery of the book is
[1:29:19] while it's calling those names. Amen.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; So even the names were not being called
[1:29:24] out as a list of names, but the mystery
[1:29:28] of of God was unfolding to God's family,
[1:29:32] revealing to them that they were part of
[1:29:34] the mystery that it was being revealed
[1:29:37] to them in their age, in the age that
[1:29:39] they lived in. The fact that it's
[1:29:41] revealed to you proves you're in the
[1:29:43] book. You're on the roll.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; You say, "So, so there is a book.
[1:29:48] There's certainly a record in heaven.
[1:29:50] The Bible says in the book of
[1:29:52] Revelation, the book of life was open.
[1:29:53] The books are open. Not saying there's
[1:29:55] not a book. There's not a record.
[1:29:56] There's not a role. I'm trying to get
[1:29:57] you to understand and look beyond the
[1:29:59] symbol. This was not a some leather
[1:30:02] bound book that Christ had on this one.
[1:30:04] This messenger didn't have it and this
[1:30:05] one did. It's all been the unfolding
[1:30:07] mystery all down through the Old
[1:30:09] Testament and in the New Testament to
[1:30:11] the very hour we and I, you and I live.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; And at whatever level it was being
[1:30:16] revealed was always the message of the
[1:30:18] hour.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:30:22] so you're not merely being identified in
[1:30:25] the eternal record of heaven,
[1:30:28] but you are yourself.
[1:30:31] You are I want to say this very
[1:30:33] carefully. You are yourself a an
[1:30:37] unfolding revelation of the word.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; I'm say it again. You're not merely
[1:30:45] being identified in the record of
[1:30:47] heaven. More than that, you are in and
[1:30:51] of yourself an unfolding revelation of
[1:30:54] the eternal word, which is Christ in
[1:30:57] you, overcoming this impossible
[1:31:01] darkness.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; And if you didn't have it and didn't
[1:31:05] have faith in, didn't have a revelation
[1:31:06] of it, you would never overcome this
[1:31:08] impossible darkness because it's
[1:31:10] impossible. It's not because you're a
[1:31:12] great person. It's not because you got
[1:31:14] great strength, but because God has
[1:31:16] declared it in his word. He's going to
[1:31:19] have a bride without spot or wrinkle.
[1:31:21] And she'll believe his word. And I just
[1:31:23] say, "Amen, Lord. Nothing in my arms I
[1:31:26] bring. Simply to thy cross I cling."
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; See, so I love I love when brother Tony
[1:31:35] sings, "It's already done from Sister
[1:31:37] Brenda." Love that. It's already done.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; The battle is over.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; The victory is won. It's already done.
[1:31:45] Why? because it was done in Christ
[1:31:47] before the foundation of the world.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; So Daniel until the time of the end
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; or until the ending of Christ's
[1:32:00] mediation. You understand? For the
[1:32:03] Gentiles.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; All right. So it was not that the
[1:32:06] revelation of God's mystery would never
[1:32:09] be known until the end time. As I said,
[1:32:11] he started giving that revelation to
[1:32:13] Abel. Yeah.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; See, so it's not that the that the
[1:32:16] revelation of God's mystery would never
[1:32:18] be known until the end time. He
[1:32:20] certainly kept revealing himself to
[1:32:22] humanity long after Daniel.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; He was revealing himself long after
[1:32:28] Daniel. And it wasn't yet yet the end
[1:32:30] time. So you see, it's a progressive
[1:32:32] process that God is doing. It it's
[1:32:34] always been
[1:32:36] it's not about that. It's not about, you
[1:32:38] know, was it to Daniel? Is it the end
[1:32:40] time? Nobody can know. It's not about
[1:32:41] that. It's always been about the word of
[1:32:44] God coming forth to live in the lives of
[1:32:48] his offspring. And they were they would
[1:32:50] be dispersed across all the Old
[1:32:52] Testament and New Testament ages.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; And it was always the revelation was not
[1:32:58] about knowledge.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; It was always coming forth to live in
[1:33:04] the lives of his offspring.
[1:33:07] So, it's not merely about secret
[1:33:09] knowledge or even primarily that cuz
[1:33:12] listen, knowledge puffs up.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Knowledge fuels pride. And that's why
[1:33:17] seeking knowledge without a new birth is
[1:33:19] always a train wreck.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll be a train wreck for you if
[1:33:22] you don't get the new birth and try to
[1:33:23] seek after knowledge. That's partly
[1:33:25] what's been responsible for the nonsense
[1:33:27] that's went on in so-called message
[1:33:29] camps. They don't been message camps.
[1:33:30] They've been man-made man-made camps. He
[1:33:33] only has one camp and that's gathered
[1:33:35] the eagles gathered around his carcass.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham says
[1:33:42] in things that are to be, he had showed
[1:33:45] the people
[1:33:47] and proved to them that he was Jehovah
[1:33:52] manifested in the flesh.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; It's a quote. Now, go with me to, you
[1:33:59] know, we're going to turn, but you're
[1:34:01] it's familiar to you. Matthew 24 and
[1:34:03] Jesus is telling about what's coming.
[1:34:06] Now, they didn't they still didn't know
[1:34:07] it's going to be 2,000 years. It's going
[1:34:09] to go across time, across seven ages.
[1:34:11] But he's he's giving them information.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; He's giving them knowledge. He's giving
[1:34:16] them some insider trading secrets.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; You see, and so, so, but in Jesus in
[1:34:22] Matthew 24, here's my question to you
[1:34:24] today. in his in his Matthew 24
[1:34:26] discourse, which do you imagine
[1:34:30] was more important? Jesus a Jesus
[1:34:34] dropping hints and knowledge about the
[1:34:36] coming ages? Remember, you shall hear of
[1:34:38] wars and rumors of wars. See that you've
[1:34:41] been remember that
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; and and whi which is more important
[1:34:45] Jesus dropping knowledge and hence about
[1:34:47] the coming ages or that he was Jehovah
[1:34:50] manifested in the flesh?
[1:34:53] That's what brother Brandham said. He
[1:34:55] come to prove that he was Jehovah. Man,
[1:34:58] what good would it do you to go to his
[1:35:00] services and hear his preaching and even
[1:35:03] say amen and get all excited if you
[1:35:05] didn't believe that he was Jehovah
[1:35:08] manifested in flesh.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; See, so the revelation then of the
[1:35:15] mystery is about the manifestation of
[1:35:18] the living word living behind living
[1:35:21] skin.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that?
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; The great mystery of God manifesting
[1:35:26] himself through his redeemed family. I
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; want to say it again. The revelation of
[1:35:32] the mystery is about the manifestation
[1:35:36] of the living word living behind living
[1:35:39] skin. Amen.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; And every age
[1:35:45] that followed the word that had it
[1:35:47] revealed from Abel to now, they were an
[1:35:53] event made clear in prophecy.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; They themselves were the event made
[1:36:00] clear in prophecy. It was never about
[1:36:02] knowledge. It was about a living God
[1:36:05] living his life behind living skin in
[1:36:07] his church.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so they they always they had
[1:36:12] always been an event made clear by
[1:36:13] prophecy. It's how God calls his family
[1:36:16] from among the dying to to to live among
[1:36:19] the living in their own modern day. In
[1:36:21] their own modern day, now your own
[1:36:23] modern day. He's called you from dying
[1:36:25] to living. He's called you from darkness
[1:36:27] to light.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; So he, as I said earlier, he he manifest
[1:36:35] he unfolds prophecy and manifestation on
[1:36:38] a need to know basis. I want to finish
[1:36:40] this before I may not get back to my
[1:36:42] quotes or I might. It looks like I
[1:36:43] might, but it's all right.
[1:36:46] So now let me just give you some more
[1:36:48] examples. I've already given you a
[1:36:50] number of them. All right.
[1:36:54] I said, "We have all the knowledge
[1:36:57] revealed to date."
[1:37:00] Well, there are parts of the seven
[1:37:02] trumpets that we still don't understand.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because it doesn't apply
[1:37:07] to us.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; It's on a need to know basis. We know
[1:37:11] parts of it. God revealed parts of it. I
[1:37:13] can go back and see the trumpets and the
[1:37:15] vials. We've preached on that and show
[1:37:17] show how it's been unfolding through
[1:37:19] history. The trumpets have unfolded in
[1:37:21] Jewish history just like the seals
[1:37:22] unfolded in Gentile history. See,
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; and God was was opening temporary
[1:37:28] plagues on the earth the same way he was
[1:37:31] opening temporarily seals.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; You understand? Partial partial. But in
[1:37:36] the tribute, but at the end time, all
[1:37:38] the seals have been made known. And now
[1:37:39] we're ready for tribulation. And all of
[1:37:41] those bowls, all of those vials are
[1:37:43] going to be poured out in the
[1:37:44] tribulation. Amen.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; So, there are questions we have
[1:37:48] concerning the appearance of Moses and
[1:37:50] Elijah and how it'll all unfold and what
[1:37:52] it will all look like. See, we don't
[1:37:55] know. We don't know how what that'll all
[1:37:57] look like. We know they're coming.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; I know the bride's leaving.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; I know Moses and Elijah are going to
[1:38:03] them. Are they there? Are they not? Is
[1:38:04] it the literal? Is it men? We don't
[1:38:06] know. Brother Bam didn't know. He had an
[1:38:08] opinion.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; We've got opinions.
[1:38:11] It's It's not relevant to your
[1:38:12] redemption because it doesn't apply to
[1:38:14] you.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Here's what applies to you. If you want
[1:38:18] to hear come up, make sure you hear come
[1:38:20] out.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; So, it doesn't apply to us. So, we only
[1:38:26] have a partial understanding.
[1:38:28] You say, "Well, how and how will it be
[1:38:31] made known?" It'll be made known as it
[1:38:35] is manifested.
[1:38:37] See,
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; some things occur within the beast
[1:38:40] system controlling the world economy
[1:38:43] that we don't have a clear picture of.
[1:38:46] All we have the best we have is
[1:38:48] prophetic surmising.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham admits to that. He
[1:38:52] says, you know, the the Rome will make a
[1:38:55] deal with the Wall Street Jews and then
[1:38:57] in the midst of it, they'll break that
[1:38:59] covenant. We're long gone. Thank God.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; And they'll break that covenant. And
[1:39:03] then later on in cood they ask him
[1:39:05] brother Brandham where in the scripture
[1:39:07] you were saying that there's a a deal
[1:39:09] made between the Rome and the Jews and
[1:39:11] where is that? And brother Brandham says
[1:39:13] his answer is very unambiguous. He says
[1:39:15] well I don't have an exact scripture for
[1:39:18] that. He said but but based on
[1:39:20] everything I do see that's what I
[1:39:22] believe it will be. I can't think it
[1:39:23] could be any other way.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; So it's still it's that's just a
[1:39:27] prophetic surmising. You understand it
[1:39:29] wasn't necessary. And if he ever did
[1:39:31] know, he didn't need to tell us or we
[1:39:33] would know.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; You understand? So you don't So I'm I'm
[1:39:37] I'm saying all this so you don't get
[1:39:39] trapped in that question was, you know,
[1:39:42] is was the word sealed to Paul? Was it
[1:39:44] not open to Paul? It was open long
[1:39:46] before Paul. And it's open to Paul and
[1:39:49] through the ages and today. And all it
[1:39:51] is is a continual. Was it was it sealed
[1:39:54] off from the ages? Almost all of it was.
[1:39:56] Every time it got another age, it got
[1:39:58] more and more sealed. More and more
[1:39:59] sealed. until it went into complete dark
[1:40:02] ages until God cracked open another seal
[1:40:05] and sent Luther to the earth with a
[1:40:07] revelation and that began to restore the
[1:40:09] bride tree.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; You're you and I are at the long tail
[1:40:14] end of a restoration message.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; See, so some things that occur on the
[1:40:23] world economy, I know we I know I know
[1:40:25] this. I know when they can't buy nor
[1:40:27] sell except you have that mark. I know
[1:40:28] we're already gone then. See, so it's
[1:40:31] not relevant to us because why? Why is
[1:40:34] that not relevant to me, Brother Jason?
[1:40:36] I should worry about it right now. I
[1:40:37] should go build a bunker and fill it
[1:40:39] full of canned goods. I should get nine
[1:40:41] rifles and three handguns and be
[1:40:43] prepared. Well, if you plan to miss the
[1:40:46] rapture, I would advise you to do all of
[1:40:47] the above. But I don't plan to need that
[1:40:50] or be here. I'm I've come out, so I'm
[1:40:53] coming up.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, whatever happens in the
[1:40:58] tribulation is not relevant to me.
[1:41:00] That's only relevant to Lot's children.
[1:41:03] Lot's children will manifest that in the
[1:41:05] tribulation. Not Abraham's children. The
[1:41:08] Abraham's children leave prior to that
[1:41:10] in the third Exodus. Glory to God. I
[1:41:13] say, Lord, come quickly. Lord Jesus, I'm
[1:41:16] so ready to depart this mad world.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; So, stop thinking of it as a mere book.
[1:41:23] I'm not suggesting there's not a record
[1:41:25] in heaven. But don't just merely get
[1:41:28] locked down to this. It's a it's a
[1:41:30] leatherbound book and is it open or is
[1:41:32] it not open? Was it open? Was it not
[1:41:34] open?
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; So, you know, you got to stop thinking
[1:41:38] of it as a book. I mean, look, friends,
[1:41:41] that you've got your Bible,
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Is this a book? Sure.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; But this wasn't even his first Bible.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; It wasn't even his second Bible.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; The stars were his first. Enoch's
[1:41:53] pyramid was his second. This is the
[1:41:55] third iteration. And I'm gonna tell you
[1:41:57] something. There's coming a day when
[1:41:59] he'll have another Bible. And it'll be
[1:42:01] you. It won't be this. When the books
[1:42:03] are closed for the last time, the word
[1:42:05] will be flesh.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; You will be the word of God. You are
[1:42:10] already being turned into that.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; See, he will have another Bible and
[1:42:18] it'll be you and you'll be the last one.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; A kingdom of saints. And I'm glad my
[1:42:25] Bible says that's an everlasting
[1:42:27] kingdom.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; I'm done. Stand up.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; I was going to bravely go trudging
[1:42:36] forward, but I see my time and I I I
[1:42:39] there's so much more I want to continue
[1:42:41] to say. I don't want you to get over
[1:42:43] sponge. Do you love the Lord?
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come, brother Kenny. Come. Amen.
[1:42:47] Have a song or two for us. Oh friends,
[1:42:51] what a privilege that we have for the
[1:42:54] things that God has shown us in this
[1:42:56] hour. So I, you know, I I want you to
[1:43:00] fully grasp I th this series I'll have
[1:43:03] probably have at least one more part,
[1:43:05] maybe two more parts at best. And so
[1:43:07] that would be part nine and part 10. Uh,
[1:43:10] come on. Oh. Oh, sorry, Mace. You want
[1:43:12] Mace to play? You want to get on the
[1:43:13] Yeah. Yeah. Okay, let's do that. Amen.
[1:43:16] Give this young man some practice. Amen.
[1:43:19] Make use of that nice haircut.
[1:43:25] Praise the Lord. I need you on the base
[1:43:28] anyway, big dog.
[1:43:30] Amen. Praise the Lord. You can't believe
[1:43:33] how famous brother Aaron is around the
[1:43:35] world. We were in Poland and they
[1:43:37] literally have almost uh made a carbon
[1:43:40] copy. They even have the picture like
[1:43:42] that. I was telling the brother, I said,
[1:43:43] "Brother, you got the same picture we've
[1:43:44] got." He goes, "Yes, brother." uh
[1:43:46] embarrassed to say we kind of copy
[1:43:48] everything you do.
[1:43:50] They they they they've even got it
[1:43:52] arranged like this. They've got, you
[1:43:54] know, all of these musicians. They got a
[1:43:56] they got a big guy with a beard on bass.
[1:43:58] They got piano players. They got uh
[1:44:01] drummers. Except it ain't quite that.
[1:44:02] It's the kind that you see Chris
[1:44:04] sometimes in the fellowship all sit on
[1:44:05] and plays, you know, beating it between
[1:44:06] his legs. And uh and the only thing they
[1:44:09] don't have, Sister Ruth, they don't have
[1:44:10] a black organist, but they have a white
[1:44:12] girl who's a cello cello player. Well,
[1:44:15] you play the cello. Okay. Oh, you don't?
[1:44:17] How fast can you learn?
[1:44:21] And and then literally when you if you
[1:44:23] pan my video, it goes across and they've
[1:44:25] even got a John Linichek in the corner
[1:44:27] on a guitar.
[1:44:31] It was complimentary and funny at the
[1:44:33] same time. Amen. Oh, I love to be part
[1:44:36] of the family of God. Don't you friends?
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; It's worth it, isn't it?
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's worth believing. Let's go sing,
[1:44:42] Brother Kenneth.
[1:44:45] Oh, let's do it, brother. Amen. That's a
[1:44:47] good song for you. Finish a sermon like
[1:44:49] this. Amen. Give us the words.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Test, test, test. I don't know if this
[1:44:54] is on.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; It's all you, brother Ken. Okay, you
[1:44:57] better get a mic that works. There you
[1:44:59] go. All right. Give him the white one,
[1:45:01] Jackson.

[1:49:58] Feel this place. I just wanna be with
[1:50:05] you.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; I just want to be with you.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; King of glory. King of glory. All
[1:50:13] together now. Oh,
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; king
[1:50:17] of glory.
[1:50:21] Build this place. I just want to be with
[1:50:27] you.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; I just want to be with you.
[1:50:31] I just wanna be with you.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Just play that softly for me, Debb.
[1:50:37] Let's bow our heads. Master,
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; you are indeed the king of glory. You're
[1:50:42] our king. You're our coming king, but
[1:50:45] you're our king right now. You're a king
[1:50:48] of this spiritual kingdom of which we
[1:50:50] are members, Lord, and very happily so.
[1:50:52] We thank you today for your word, Lord,
[1:50:54] for your revealed word to us. It's been
[1:50:56] very real, very moving. We see ourselves
[1:50:59] Lord clearly. We want to be in position.
[1:51:02] We want to be in the right time, the
[1:51:04] right place, saying, feeling, doing,
[1:51:06] thinking the right things. Everything in
[1:51:08] our lives, Lord, that is unpleasing to
[1:51:10] you, may you take it away, Lord. We
[1:51:13] could not possibly hear a sermon like
[1:51:14] today and realize this lofty position of
[1:51:16] your bride and and have any notion to
[1:51:19] hold on to the things of the world. May
[1:51:21] it not be. May it never be. Go today
[1:51:24] with us, Lord, as we get ready to
[1:51:26] depart. We continue to sing and praise
[1:51:28] you. But Lord, let the let the work of
[1:51:30] the Holy Spirit now do that thing that
[1:51:32] only you can do. Do that thing, Holy
[1:51:35] Spirit, which you do so well. Lord, even
[1:51:38] when words of preachers and friends and
[1:51:41] family, and even when a manifested life
[1:51:44] right in front of somebody, even that's
[1:51:45] not sufficient. They can hear the word
[1:51:48] preached. The the Bible says their sound
[1:51:50] went into all the earth. Have they not
[1:51:52] heard? Yay, they've heard the sound went
[1:51:54] into all the earth. But with some of
[1:51:56] them he was not well pleased for they
[1:51:58] heard but they did not believe. They did
[1:52:00] not mix it with faith. Lord I pray that
[1:52:02] be nobody of Bethl Tabernacle. May we
[1:52:05] all mix our faith with your word so that
[1:52:07] it can become a living life Lord and we
[1:52:10] can daily daily and daily and every day
[1:52:12] coming. However many days we have left
[1:52:15] we can surrender more and more to the
[1:52:16] vision of your word for our lives. I
[1:52:19] pray you grant it. Lord, someday
[1:52:22] every man will bow as the song sings
[1:52:24] that we're singing. Someday every man.
[1:52:27] It's not a question of of if. It's only
[1:52:30] a question of when and where. Lord, let
[1:52:33] us bow now while there's mercy. Let us
[1:52:36] bow before the throne of your word where
[1:52:38] you are seated Lord as king. Father, I
[1:52:40] pray that every word of God would be yay
[1:52:42] and amen in our hearts today as take the
[1:52:45] people from here Lord and may you
[1:52:47] continue to grow them. Speak to them.
[1:52:49] speak to them about things that I can't
[1:52:51] know, Lord. Things about their life,
[1:52:52] things that only you and they know, Lord
[1:52:54] God. And they and and maybe if they're
[1:52:57] anything like me, they've got areas in
[1:52:58] their life they'd like to see more
[1:53:00] victory. If they're anything like me,
[1:53:01] they often have to turn around like Paul
[1:53:03] and repent and die daily. Lord, I pray
[1:53:06] that you'll give us courage to just keep
[1:53:08] going forward and die daily as I have to
[1:53:11] die and surrender as I need to surrender
[1:53:13] and accept your word for my life. Lord,
[1:53:16] may you grant it. May you be the king of
[1:53:18] glory. May you be the king in my life
[1:53:20] that brings that my life might bring you
[1:53:23] glory. We love you. We thank you for it
[1:53:27] Lord in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:53:31] Amen. You love him.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; King of gloryy.
[1:53:36] Oh fill this place. I just want to be
[1:53:43] with you. Yes Lord.
[1:53:46] I just want to be with you.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; King of glory. Hallelujah.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; King
[1:53:55] of glory,
[1:53:59] fill this place. I just want to be with
[1:54:05] you.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; I just want to be with you.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Lift your voices. King of glory.
[1:54:15] King of God.
[1:54:20] May God bless
[1:54:23] this place. God bless you.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; I just want to be with you.
[1:54:30] I just want to be with you.
[1:54:36] Yes. The world
[1:54:40] will bow down and say you are God.
[1:54:46] [Music]
[1:54:48] Every man
[1:54:51] will bow down and say you are king.
[1:54:59] So let's start right now.
[1:55:05] Why would we wait?
[1:55:10] King of glory
[1:55:16] fill this place. Just want to be with
[1:55:22] you.
[1:55:25] I just wanna be with you.
