[27:39] Lord we're looking for today and um I've
[27:43] U trying to bring this ninth installment
[27:46] of uh abiding in Christ and I really
[27:49] think I might finish it today now that's
[27:52] that's my purpose that's my plan and I'm
[27:55] GNA try to be real studious and real
[27:57] methodical and if I do that and don't
[28:00] get preaching really hard which I'm not
[28:02] too good at not
[28:03] doing then we'll we'll get through it
[28:06] amen I uh because I can see more
[28:08] material but I also can see that it's
[28:11] kind of going in a different direction
[28:12] so maybe today will be the day praise
[28:16] the Lord amen I was enjoying uh all the
[28:19] brother Tony uh he walked by my office
[28:22] and and stuck his head in just to check
[28:24] on me as he always does I said man you
[28:27] went old church today hey I said wow I
[28:29] was in the back office and they were in
[28:30] there practicing my toe was tapping I
[28:33] was like wow that that is wonderful I
[28:35] love those old church songs and then uh
[28:39] and then he also uh brings in all of the
[28:42] modern stuff so it's wonderful wonderful
[28:44] I love it amen props to Brother JD for
[28:46] that uh tremendous Sunday school class
[28:49] amen this morning I was telling brother
[28:51] Jason a little bit of feedback CU
[28:52] preachers like to hear a little bit of
[28:54] feedback and um you know and believe it
[28:57] or not they want to hear constructive
[29:00] criticism if you got the right
[29:03] attitude but I was telling him that I
[29:05] was speaking to a brother personally the
[29:07] other day and he was telling me that we
[29:11] he was just testifying about you know
[29:15] having your home having everything in
[29:17] order you remember the Bible says that a
[29:19] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[29:24] ways so if he if he's double-minded
[29:26] which means he's just not really
[29:28] operating by faith in God's word if he
[29:31] really believed it brother brandham said
[29:33] you know these things that we do
[29:34] sometimes which are not sin he said you
[29:36] do those things because you're an
[29:37] unbeliever if you were a real believer
[29:40] in God's word and you believed it and it
[29:42] was a revelation in your heart you
[29:43] wouldn't do those things your life would
[29:45] be different amen and so when you when
[29:48] you when you get double-minded like that
[29:50] where you know it's true and but you're
[29:52] not surrendering and you don't want to
[29:54] go to hell and you want to go in the
[29:56] Rapture but you're not willing to make
[29:57] that full commitment then you know what
[29:59] you find is that there's is that when
[30:03] you're double-minded like that there's
[30:04] instability in all your circle in your
[30:08] home and your marriage and your family
[30:10] and your parenting and your job and your
[30:12] business and your reputation it will
[30:14] affect your whole circle see so have
[30:17] faith in God Amen and believe and accept
[30:21] his word and this brother was just
[30:22] testifying that you know he he um he
[30:26] said I was sitting there a couple of
[30:27] session ago and brother Jason was on
[30:29] this
[30:31] series and he just made a statement and
[30:33] he said and it just went through me like
[30:35] like thunder like he just he said it
[30:37] just hit me and Dove deep and and he
[30:40] said I realized in that moment just that
[30:43] Moment of clarity he said that I
[30:45] realized that in in areas of my home and
[30:48] my family and my leadership my marriage
[30:51] child rearing my business everything he
[30:54] said I realized that I could allow the
[30:56] Lord far more more freedom to move and
[31:00] operate through me than I had been and
[31:02] he said he made up his mind right then
[31:04] he was going to make some of those
[31:06] changes so I tell you something friends
[31:08] when when you live in a way that God can
[31:10] get behind that that's oh that's gold
[31:14] that's premium amen you don't want to be
[31:17] uh the obstacle to the Lord being able
[31:20] to that's why brother BR was brother
[31:22] brandom's whole theme in door and doors
[31:24] you know that uh God wants to use you as
[31:27] I read here in a a quote here a session
[31:30] or two ago I think it was the last
[31:32] session that you are transmitters
[31:34] remember that one and he wants to
[31:36] transmit his word through you so we're
[31:38] going to look at a number of things
[31:40] brother brandham said to try to finish
[31:42] out our thought today and uh we're going
[31:45] to just ask you to be in prayer uh when
[31:48] we uh read our scripture and we pray
[31:50] amen I don't see sister Brenda I don't

[39:01] bless you friends you can be
[39:13] seated want to be
[39:15] uh also
[39:17] remembering um there's a there's some of
[39:21] the church down went down to be with uh
[39:24] brother Joe in those meetings there I
[39:25] know Matt was there ministering last
[39:27] night tonight and I think he was going
[39:28] to stay through this morning thank you
[39:30] brother Tony and uh so he'll be driving
[39:32] in I know brother Brad and Sister Sarah
[39:34] also I believe uh went
[39:37] down fact is I know they do they that
[39:40] they did now that I think about it um so
[39:43] brother Brad was talking about what a
[39:45] wonderful service it was last night
[39:47] brother Matt ministered there and so
[39:50] just want to be praying for them uh on
[39:52] their drive back will you do it amen and
[39:55] any others who perhaps are awayed today
[39:57] I see brother Steve sister Emily's still
[39:59] away so we're missing them as well and
[40:01] every different person also all right
[40:05] so when last we left off in our study we
[40:10] were
[40:11] comparing the Generation of Vipers in
[40:16] Matthew chapter 3 the ones that came out
[40:19] to see John's baptism you remember that
[40:22] and the Bible says when the Sadducees
[40:25] and Pharisees came and John saw them
[40:27] coming to be
[40:29] baptized he said to them who has warned
[40:32] you to flee from the wrath of God it
[40:36] seems apparent to me that what was clear
[40:38] to John was that they were not coming
[40:41] because they were LED of the holy spirit
[40:44] that they were coming of their own
[40:46] accord for reasons that that aren't made
[40:49] clear but whatever the reasons were I'm
[40:52] not here to say I know what was in their
[40:54] heart but apparently the prophet Elijah
[40:58] standing there knew that it wasn't a
[41:01] good
[41:02] reason amen that they were there for
[41:05] some nefarious reason some nefarious
[41:08] purpose and he asked them you know who
[41:11] has warned you to flee from the wrath of
[41:14] God it's obvious pretty obvious that it
[41:16] wasn't God because the Sadducees and the
[41:19] Pharisees did not believe John and fact
[41:21] is when Jesus uh challenged them in the
[41:25] public whether his ministry were of God
[41:27] or no uh they would not answer that
[41:30] question because they they said within
[41:33] themselves and they reasoned they
[41:34] huddled up and said well if we say no
[41:37] cuz we really don't believe that he was
[41:39] that prophet and we sent people to even
[41:41] ask him and he denied that he was which
[41:43] a prophet would always do and so you
[41:47] know we don't believe he was because you
[41:49] know we didn't we didn't agree with his
[41:51] message he he rebuked the king for his
[41:55] marriage and divorce situation and and
[41:57] we had him killed and so no we don't
[41:59] believe in him but we can't say that
[42:01] because the people believe he was a
[42:03] great prophet and they might kill us if
[42:05] we say that but then we also can't say
[42:08] that we do believe him because first
[42:10] that would be a lie but then second
[42:12] Jesus would immediately say then if he
[42:15] was of God why do you not believe what
[42:17] he said about me he said I'm the Lamb of
[42:19] God that I've come to take away the sin
[42:21] of the world he said he saw the spirit
[42:24] of God descend like a dove and rest upon
[42:26] me amen so if he was of God why do you
[42:29] not believe me see so so it was a it was
[42:33] a conundrum for them unsolvable gordian
[42:36] not they weren't they're going to try to
[42:38] to
[42:39] unravel and because there was no good
[42:41] answer they could give I would I just I
[42:43] just would hate to be that guy I just
[42:46] would hate to where I I I I I couldn't
[42:50] acknowledge the truth if I could to say
[42:51] it that simply I'm glad today I can
[42:54] acknowledge the truth I'm glad to and
[42:58] and and and the truth doesn't always
[43:01] agree with the way I act and therefore I
[43:04] repent and I come back and I say Lord
[43:07] I'm sorry I didn't follow your truth cuz
[43:09] I want to follow your
[43:13] truth there I go preaching
[43:18] already so we find then that John
[43:21] identifies this Generation of Vipers and
[43:23] we were comparing that Generation of
[43:25] Vipers
[43:28] in Matthew 3 with the generation of
[43:30] Jesus Christ from Matthew
[43:32] 1 and we were pointing out that one of
[43:35] the things we're pointing out is that
[43:38] that they were both identified in the
[43:42] singular now that's an important point
[43:45] they were both identified you
[43:48] Generation of
[43:50] Vipers single generation of plural
[43:54] people or are you part of the gener
[43:57] generation of Jesus Christ and he tracks
[44:00] it back you know from Abraham 14
[44:04] generations to David from David 14
[44:07] generations to the to the to the uh
[44:10] captivity and then from the cap the
[44:12] restoration then 14 Generations uh
[44:15] coming to to uh Joseph now we know that
[44:20] none of them were
[44:23] biologically connected to Jesus amen but
[44:27] yet they were that seed line of Christ
[44:31] that treed its way through the Scripture
[44:35] it it it was a marker all the way
[44:38] traveling through the word that there
[44:40] would be a seed of God in the earth and
[44:43] there would be people to receive it and
[44:46] people would display what was really
[44:49] inside of them and it had always been
[44:51] there before the foundation of the world
[44:54] Amen now we're not talking about since
[44:56] the foundation of the world the remnant
[44:58] of the woman's seed in every age There
[45:00] Was An Old Testament Remnant there was a
[45:03] new testament Remnant sometimes you'd
[45:04] call them the unwise Virgin there was a
[45:07] Remnant in every age and they're always
[45:10] listed as having been known of God since
[45:13] the foundation of the world since the
[45:15] book of life and their names remained in
[45:17] that book of life only concerning Jesus
[45:21] Christ and his elect bride the Bible
[45:26] doesn't say since the foundation of the
[45:29] world in every case there only three
[45:31] times and in all three three out of
[45:33] three times it says that Jesus and his
[45:36] bride were with God before the
[45:39] foundation of the world and that's the
[45:41] only one it applies to all the others
[45:43] are since the foundation of the world
[45:45] Amen so so we realize then that this
[45:48] generation is a single generation they
[45:51] were both identified in the singular and
[45:54] not the plural proving firstly
[45:57] that they both have a single source of
[46:01] life amen governing I should say
[46:04] governing their life cuz Satan can't
[46:06] create life but the Generation of
[46:10] Vipers are governed by a single Source
[46:13] of Life the generation of Jesus Christ
[46:16] are governed by a single source of life
[46:19] amen you're following me see now make no
[46:24] mistake today you your life is either
[46:29] being guided from above or beneath
[46:33] that's right full
[46:36] stop amen I'm not now I'm not even
[46:39] talking about whether you're a c Gene of
[46:41] God whether you're even born again I'm
[46:43] talking about what is controlling what
[46:46] is influencing your life what are what
[46:48] are your priorities in life and how much
[46:51] position as we were saying with the
[46:53] brother testifying how much ability does
[46:56] God
[46:57] have to flow through
[46:59] you
[47:01] unhindered and that's what's been the
[47:03] theme of our our whole series we're not
[47:06] talking about coming into the new birth
[47:09] where come to me you weary or heavy
[47:11] laden and I'll give you rest but then
[47:13] we've proven you by the Bible that he
[47:15] goes on to the next level and he says
[47:18] now now learn of me take my yoke upon
[47:22] you and I will give you rest for your
[47:25] souls that's next level
[47:27] that's where you are resting in Christ
[47:29] completely your life is hid in Christ
[47:32] Hallelujah and the Holy Spirit has free
[47:35] reign over every aspect of your life oh
[47:38] my God
[47:40] Amen if any aspect of your life is not
[47:43] God honoring then it's been controlled
[47:44] from beneath period
[47:49] amen because that you are
[47:52] born the wrong
[47:54] way you are born in sin and you come
[47:58] into the world under the control of the
[48:02] beneath
[48:04] righten that power let me say to you
[48:07] today that power has one goal just like
[48:11] God has one goal brother randam said in
[48:12] all the Bible and all the people and all
[48:15] the stories was all in expression of
[48:17] that one goal and that was that God
[48:20] wanted to have a kingdom that he could
[48:22] express himself into so we realize that
[48:25] God it's not it's not it's it's not
[48:28] wrong to say God created a family cuz in
[48:30] the beginning God created and said let
[48:32] us make I get it but but it doesn't
[48:34] entail God's full expression in the
[48:37] godhead here's a better way to say it
[48:39] God became a family see and this is why
[48:43] Jesus is the express image of the father
[48:46] as a human amen we'll talk about that a
[48:48] little more as we
[48:50] go so they both got a goal so let me say
[48:54] this again because you were born born
[48:57] the wrong way not by the original spoken
[48:59] word
[49:00] way you are born in sin because you were
[49:03] born under a sex birth and that was not
[49:05] the original way that's what that's what
[49:08] that was the sin in the Garden of Eden
[49:11] and so we realize then that because that
[49:13] you are born that way you come into the
[49:16] world under the control of that which is
[49:19] beneath and that power has one goal and
[49:22] that goal is to take you from the Cradle
[49:26] to the Grave
[49:27] to hell yeah amen full stop yeah amen
[49:31] from the Cradle to the Grave to
[49:35] hell and unless there is a power from
[49:39] above that reaches down and saves you
[49:43] right amen that will be your end Destiny
[49:46] that's right that is the final stop of
[49:48] your train amen from the Cradle to the
[49:52] Grave be a good person be ever so
[49:56] whatever you do all kinds of heroic
[49:58] Deeds there there's been many PE and I'm
[50:01] not saying God doesn't take account for
[50:02] that I'm not saying that at all but I'm
[50:04] just simply saying when it comes to
[50:07] being redeemed God has one provided way
[50:09] to redeem you God's goal is to save
[50:14] everybody I want that clear God's goal
[50:18] is to save everybody amen even those who
[50:21] are not part of his elected family he
[50:23] still makes a way for salvation for any
[50:26] one who God's never going to send anyone
[50:28] to Hell the man sends himself there see
[50:32] and and that's why brother Brandon
[50:34] pointed out said God will never condemn
[50:35] a man for being a sinner because the man
[50:38] was born a sinner God knows that that's
[50:40] not even his fault he didn't volunteer
[50:42] to come that way so brother Ram said God
[50:44] will never condemn him for being a
[50:45] sinner what will condemn the man is he
[50:47] remained a sinner when he didn't have to
[50:50] that the sacrifice of Christ is
[50:52] sufficient to give you salvation see so
[50:57] so I'm just going slow you good these
[51:00] are things that we know well but I want
[51:01] to go over
[51:03] them so God's goal is to save everybody
[51:06] we know that he takes no pleasure even
[51:08] in the death of The Sinner he would that
[51:10] all men come to Salvation Jesus died for
[51:13] the sins of the whole world there's
[51:15] loads and loads of scripture to prove
[51:17] that but you have to
[51:21] choose you say him hold on you better
[51:26] Define him him first cuz he's his word
[51:29] amen when you choose him we're not
[51:32] merely talking about the man 2,000 years
[51:35] ago that walked the shores of Galilee
[51:38] before he was the man on the cross he
[51:40] was
[51:42] this and just because he became the man
[51:44] on the cross didn't stop him from being
[51:46] this he said I come from this I go back
[51:49] to this see he lived as a human to pay
[51:52] the price of redemption a price you
[51:54] couldn't pay even if you followed in his
[51:55] footsteps and died on the cross it
[51:57] wouldn't have mattered because you were
[51:59] born in sin he
[52:01] wasn't it was God's beautiful
[52:04] Masterpiece so you have to choose to
[52:08] accept his provided way and as brother
[52:12] JD was showing us Wednesday night the it
[52:15] it is the way of faith in his revealed
[52:19] word that is God's provided way that's
[52:23] not new that's always been
[52:27] you have to come God's provided way and
[52:31] that and his provided way has always
[52:34] been through faith in his revealed word
[52:38] it started with the First Acceptance of
[52:42] it after the fall after the fall the
[52:44] First Acceptance of it proving that
[52:47] anyone that that wants to follow it can
[52:50] and that was in Abel Abel accepted God's
[52:53] provided Way by faith which is a
[52:55] revelation
[52:57] Cain would not do it even when he had it
[53:00] explained to
[53:03] him you see Abel caught it by
[53:07] Revelation Cain didn't catch the
[53:09] Revelation and when he heard about it he
[53:11] got angry and even God come down and
[53:13] explained it to him like talking to a
[53:16] nine-year-old yeah if you just do as
[53:18] your brother
[53:20] amen so you're not going to impune God
[53:22] not not by any means he's fair and
[53:25] Equitable in all of his ways
[53:28] so we realize then that you know and
[53:30] it's a fair question I I agree that it's
[53:32] a fair question why did he condition it
[53:36] like that faith in his revealed word why
[53:40] is it conditioned that eternal life you
[53:44] come born in sin you you don't want to
[53:46] go to from the Cradle to the Grave to
[53:48] hell you want to go from the cradle find
[53:50] Christ and Christ find you and and you
[53:53] live in glory amen is that your desire
[53:55] if it's not on white you're here today
[53:57] see so so but so you have to come his
[54:00] provided way of faith in his revealed
[54:03] word why did God condition it like that
[54:07] by faith in the word that he reveals as
[54:11] Jesus taught us in Matthew 11 and he to
[54:14] whom the son will reveal him that's the
[54:16] scripture that's what you say why'd he
[54:18] do it like that someday you can ask
[54:20] Jesus but I'm going to give you the
[54:22] answer that he gave me when I asked this
[54:24] morning Lord give me good answer for why
[54:27] you did it like that I'd like to be able
[54:29] to tell the people something that will
[54:31] make sense to them and that anybody
[54:34] could hardly disagree
[54:36] with why did he condition it upon faith
[54:40] in his word that he
[54:42] reveals why not if you want to share
[54:45] your eternal life with everybody why not
[54:48] just make it like a bowl of candy you
[54:51] pass
[54:52] out because salvation first of all is
[54:54] not trick-or treat right amen this ain't
[54:58] a a a grab bag for kitties you
[55:02] understand the gospel's not trick-or
[55:05] treat the gospel's not candy in a bag so
[55:08] why do you have to come God's way so
[55:13] that it eternal life can't be
[55:18] stolen amen it's free yes but you can't
[55:21] steal it amen it has to be offered has
[55:24] to be revealed then you have a choice to
[55:26] make you either surrender or you don't
[55:29] because we're not talking about your
[55:31] choice being intellectual
[55:33] agreement somebody's pretty crazy to to
[55:35] intellectually disagree with God's word
[55:38] so it's not just about intellectual
[55:40] agreement it's about surrender amen it's
[55:43] about I have nothing to offer he's I'm
[55:46] nothing he's everything I take him
[55:48] completely I Surrender my whole life
[55:51] everything about me I don't want to be
[55:52] me anymore now that I've met him I don't
[55:54] want to be me I want to be like him
[55:57] and that is the pathway to the baptism
[55:59] of the Holy Ghost and if you're not
[56:00] willing to come to that surrender you
[56:03] can you can intellectually have human
[56:06] faith in the man of Calvary all day long
[56:09] till the cows come home as as brother
[56:11] Gerald Hugh says till the cows come home
[56:13] and the calves cry for
[56:17] buttermilk but it's you've got to come
[56:19] God's provided way of accepting the
[56:23] Revelation and by faith in his revealed
[56:27] word he does that so that you can't
[56:30] steal it so that you can't let me say it
[56:32] like this and this is going to trigger
[56:34] your your your your brain so that you
[56:37] can't put your hand on the tree of life
[56:41] and live forever in a fallen
[56:44] condition he had already chased Adam and
[56:47] Eve out of the garden for that very
[56:50] reason go read Genesis 3 right amen he
[56:54] had already came into the valley of Shar
[56:56] and stopped the Tower of Babel Midstream
[56:58] and just scattered all over the world
[57:00] because they were breaking in they were
[57:02] getting too close to something and they
[57:05] and they were determined to go back uh
[57:06] break their way they said that that's
[57:08] their testimony that they were trying to
[57:10] break back into heaven and so we realize
[57:13] that he chased Adam and Eve out of the
[57:16] Garden of Eden he said in Genesis 3 I
[57:19] think 31 maybe three somewhere in three
[57:22] might be in 20-some and he says now lest
[57:25] he put forth his hand and take the tree
[57:28] of life and live forever and so God used
[57:31] cherubims with flaming swords at the
[57:33] entrance and drove man from the garden
[57:36] amen and those Angels standing there
[57:38] with flaming swords and I'm here to tell
[57:41] you something friends don't think about
[57:42] a path we're not talking about a path
[57:45] we're talking about the way of the tree
[57:47] of life that and from then on it's going
[57:49] to become only by Revelation and whom
[57:53] the son will reveal him to am amen and
[57:57] so the the the word of God actually is
[58:00] the sword that blinds the people Jesus
[58:03] was still swinging that same sword that
[58:06] those angels were swinging at and
[58:08] guarding the way of the tree of life he
[58:11] was still swinging that sword when he
[58:12] said except you eat the Flesh of the son
[58:14] of man drink his blood you have no life
[58:15] in you and he didn't explain
[58:18] that and he knew it would take 85% of
[58:21] his church and he let it
[58:25] happen they misunderstood where he was
[58:27] even born and he didn't even correct
[58:29] that he could have easily corrected that
[58:32] oh no the messiah's got to have to be
[58:34] born in Bethlehem and this guy you know
[58:36] was out of Nazareth does any good thing
[58:38] come out of Nazareth no we We Know by
[58:40] the word of God he's not Messiah and he
[58:42] could have so easily he said well
[58:44] actually guys um you see what happened
[58:47] was yeah I was born in Bethlehem but my
[58:49] my father you know uh got got a
[58:52] visitation from an angel and we had to
[58:53] flee to Egypt and because the King was
[58:56] trying to kill all the newborns and I
[58:58] actually was born in Bethlehem but then
[58:59] we fled to Egypt for two years and then
[59:01] I got brought back and we we ended up in
[59:03] Nazareth so it's just a misunderstanding
[59:05] don't worry I was born in Bethlehem amen
[59:07] he never even corrected it just went
[59:10] right on see now he's not worried I want
[59:14] to say to you today he's not worried
[59:17] about operating that way because he
[59:20] knoweth them that are his he knows he
[59:24] will not lose one of them
[59:26] he knows according to acts 13 he knows
[59:30] that all those who are ordained will
[59:34] believe amen amen acts
[59:40] 13:48 so let me say to you today
[59:44] that that merely joining a church will
[59:48] not save you right
[59:52] amen could I take it another step
[59:56] even being a part of a a true church
[1:00:01] right that preaches the revealed word
[1:00:03] but your attendance is just casual or
[1:00:06] social and there's no real experience
[1:00:11] there if that's you today I'm glad
[1:00:14] you're here but I would love to see you
[1:00:16] let him come in and make a new creation
[1:00:19] out of you I'm never going to pull the
[1:00:22] horse away from the water even if he's
[1:00:23] not drinking it because at least if he's
[1:00:25] close might drink it right so so a lot
[1:00:29] of times we I have a tremendous level of
[1:00:32] Toleration for people to come in and set
[1:00:34] for years as long as they'll be decent
[1:00:37] and moral not cause trouble and they
[1:00:39] won't they won't bring you know extreme
[1:00:42] disgrace to the name of Christ in this
[1:00:44] message we'll let them sit right here
[1:00:46] because look this is a hospital for the
[1:00:48] sick and dying that's what it is we hate
[1:00:51] imagery we're not about that we've never
[1:00:53] been about that brother Jason has never
[1:00:55] been about that I I I I'm I'm not
[1:00:58] worried about your wins and losses
[1:01:00] column I don't look at the WL columns
[1:01:02] every day uh in the newspaper about how
[1:01:05] you're living I don't follow you around
[1:01:06] I don't have drones flying over your
[1:01:08] house I even sold my drone just so you
[1:01:11] wouldn't worry about that and don't
[1:01:13] worry brother Michael doesn't do that
[1:01:15] for me he's not a secret agent flying
[1:01:16] the Drone around watching how y'all
[1:01:23] live I can't get most started because we
[1:01:25] we'll be on a row here
[1:01:29] so what's what's the
[1:01:31] criteria is that you might come into the
[1:01:34] house of God and come near The Well of
[1:01:37] Water of Life That's where elaser sat
[1:01:41] when the fair Rebecca came and he said
[1:01:44] Lord here I sit by The Well of Water by
[1:01:47] The Well of Water of Life and she came
[1:01:50] and she did exactly like he prophesied
[1:01:52] she would do in his prayer amen
[1:01:58] so even casually or socially attending
[1:02:01] even a true church with a true vision
[1:02:04] and a true version of the original
[1:02:06] gospel that won't save you amen that
[1:02:10] won't take you from the Generation of
[1:02:13] Vipers which you were born
[1:02:15] as and put you in the generation of
[1:02:18] Jesus Christ it won't even give you
[1:02:21] basic salvation amen you understand even
[1:02:24] basic salvation you there's a certain
[1:02:27] minimal requirement for faith in
[1:02:30] whatever God reveals to you either way
[1:02:32] you have to come God's provided way even
[1:02:35] the foolish virgin have to believe the
[1:02:38] amount of word god reveals to them or
[1:02:41] they get there at the Judgment Day and
[1:02:43] they find that their names had been in
[1:02:45] the book of life but it had been
[1:02:49] deleted billions will be in that
[1:02:52] category
[1:02:56] you know it's funny
[1:02:59] because sometimes
[1:03:01] people they have this very uh you know
[1:03:06] Grandeur you know some great lofty idea
[1:03:09] that oh you know I want to I want to I'm
[1:03:12] going to leave a Heritage and and I'm
[1:03:14] going to live on in my Offspring and
[1:03:17] then I'll live on and my you know this
[1:03:19] will be this will be my uh you know my
[1:03:21] family tree and it'll go on and long
[1:03:23] after I'm gone I I'll still be living
[1:03:26] because they they they had the
[1:03:28] opportunity to actually still be living
[1:03:31] but they passed it up in life and they
[1:03:33] chose some esoteric
[1:03:35] philosophical you know some way of of
[1:03:38] Eastern religion or or some type of
[1:03:41] gnosticism and that you know I I realize
[1:03:44] now that scientists are starting to
[1:03:45] actually acknowledge that there was an
[1:03:47] uncaused cause I just heard this
[1:03:49] recently but they still don't call it
[1:03:51] God like we would call it they just
[1:03:52] simply call it some unknown
[1:03:54] unexplainable energy I wish they'd let
[1:03:57] that unexplainable energy go through
[1:03:59] them one time and they'd realize that's
[1:04:01] tied to a Life
[1:04:05] Source but people imagine that they will
[1:04:08] you know oh I have this this wonderful
[1:04:11] dream that I will live on in my
[1:04:12] generations and generations and
[1:04:14] generations now I don't want to burst
[1:04:16] your bubble but I'm going to give you a
[1:04:17] reality check going to cover a little
[1:04:19] bit of biology today you good amen I'm
[1:04:22] not a geneticist I'm not a biologist I
[1:04:25] study numerous disciplines of science
[1:04:27] because as a hobby but I'm I had to
[1:04:29] really do a lot of research to come up
[1:04:31] with these
[1:04:34] answers after 20
[1:04:39] Generations there is
[1:04:42] only
[1:04:51] 0.004% of
[1:04:53] you genetically in them amen after 20
[1:04:59] Generations there's almost nothing of
[1:05:01] you left right now I'm not saying DNA
[1:05:04] DNA is way more than just genes and
[1:05:06] chromosomes and I don't want to get into
[1:05:08] an explanation of that but but they
[1:05:11] contract DNA way back and they find
[1:05:13] fossilized records I'm not I'm not
[1:05:15] saying that there's not some portion of
[1:05:17] DNA there's there's different DNA is not
[1:05:19] just one thing but as far as like
[1:05:21] genetically your
[1:05:23] genes in them yeah after 20 Generations
[1:05:27] it's almost non-existent amen it's like
[1:05:30] it's less than one it's it's it's um
[1:05:34] it's four what would that be 10 10
[1:05:37] hundred a th000 10,000 yeah it's four
[1:05:40] 100s of a thousand of a thousandth four
[1:05:44] 100 four
[1:05:47] 100,000 of one amen after 20
[1:05:51] Generations amen say why is that
[1:05:53] relevant because from Abraham to Jesus
[1:05:57] was more than double that 42 Generations
[1:06:02] right 42
[1:06:05] generations and yet Abraham is is the is
[1:06:11] part of the firstborn family of Jesus
[1:06:15] and so was David and so was Isaiah and
[1:06:18] now you through Christ through the
[1:06:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost through the
[1:06:21] blood of Christ are en joined back to
[1:06:23] God now Abraham is your brother
[1:06:26] amen and it was 42 Generations from him
[1:06:30] to Jesus and now we've got 2,000 years
[1:06:34] worth of generations to now but I'm here
[1:06:36] to tell you that the gene that was
[1:06:39] inside of me is does not diminish and it
[1:06:43] only even took one gene from God and it
[1:06:46] didn't matter all my failures all my
[1:06:49] mistakes all my troubles how I was born
[1:06:52] whatever I did I stand here today non
[1:06:55] diminish I'm still a first child son of
[1:06:59] almighty
[1:07:00] God I'm still a part of that original
[1:07:04] generation
[1:07:07] amen it's interesting how people have
[1:07:09] that you know that star-eyed Vision you
[1:07:12] know and and and this geneticist that
[1:07:14] was talking about it he was giving a
[1:07:15] talk I was listening to and he made this
[1:07:17] point he said he said if you struggle
[1:07:20] with that he said does anyone know the
[1:07:23] first names of all four of their great
[1:07:26] great
[1:07:28] grandparents does anyone know all four
[1:07:32] names of their great great grandparents
[1:07:36] and of course Fil A stadium with 20,000
[1:07:39] people and nobody will will hardly know
[1:07:41] that and then his next question is and
[1:07:44] does anyone
[1:07:47] care no one cares I don't know the for
[1:07:50] names of my great great grandparents and
[1:07:54] I don't care they were that was then
[1:07:57] this is now I I I I'm not worried about
[1:08:00] trying to be part of some biology I'm
[1:08:03] not worried about because sometimes you
[1:08:06] you live you say oh I want to live on
[1:08:08] and I'll be famous well you might be INF
[1:08:10] famous you might live on in infamy and I
[1:08:14] don't want to live on in infamy I want
[1:08:16] to live on in I want to be famous I want
[1:08:19] to know that God is my father and
[1:08:21] Abraham is my brother and David is my
[1:08:24] brother and Jesus is my
[1:08:27] brother H he's the first born among many
[1:08:31] Brethren and it literally trumps every
[1:08:35] possible way the devil even though I was
[1:08:37] born in sin I got recovered and even
[1:08:40] though I make mistakes I'm still a part
[1:08:42] of it even though I have failures I'm
[1:08:43] still a part of it even though I I I I
[1:08:46] have to repent every day but I'm still a
[1:08:48] part of it and I'm not any less a part
[1:08:50] of it no matter the accumul the
[1:08:53] accumulative effect of all my wrong
[1:08:55] birth and all the things I went through
[1:08:57] and all the mistakes I've made or will
[1:09:00] ever make it does not change my
[1:09:02] genealogy at
[1:09:07] all not at
[1:09:10] all
[1:09:11] so you know I I thought about that and I
[1:09:16] thought you know it's sad because you
[1:09:17] know they have and they have a lot of
[1:09:20] information about this now because they
[1:09:22] have What's called the Human Genome
[1:09:23] Project but I I was talking to brother
[1:09:25] the Mark about I said you know I said
[1:09:27] the problem is firstly is that they
[1:09:30] don't realize that they've mapped a
[1:09:32] failed
[1:09:33] system and secondly they've mapped a
[1:09:36] temporary system that's passing away I
[1:09:40] don't plan to go to heaven like this I
[1:09:43] plan to be a new creation and have a new
[1:09:45] body a body like unto his glorious body
[1:09:49] oh I'll have a body like his how about
[1:09:51] you friends a life that that a life that
[1:09:54] come on a life that doesn't carry scars
[1:09:58] and wounds and complexes a life that
[1:10:00] doesn't have grief and and failures oh
[1:10:03] I'm going to have a body like under his
[1:10:05] glorious
[1:10:07] body amen I'll be happy to see this
[1:10:10] version of me Fade Out and replaced with
[1:10:13] an everlasting
[1:10:14] one oh
[1:10:17] my I won't need anyone to come and live
[1:10:21] after me or live in my stead I I my my
[1:10:25] people people will long enjoy the works
[1:10:27] of their hands I don't need anyone to
[1:10:30] come live for me my people will long
[1:10:33] enjoy the works of their hands they
[1:10:35] won't build and another inhabit but they
[1:10:37] shall be the children of the most high
[1:10:40] God
[1:10:44] hallelujah brother
[1:10:48] brandham comes with a we we're all we're
[1:10:52] all very familiar with this statement
[1:10:53] all at once I looked up and I said I'm
[1:10:55] not the son of Charles and Ella branam
[1:10:59] there's something calling we're all
[1:11:02] familiar with that they're in communion
[1:11:04] his last one of his last sermons his
[1:11:07] last text sermon was leadership but here
[1:11:09] he is in communion it's the last time
[1:11:11] he'll be in a pull pit and and he opens
[1:11:13] his scripture and takes and he's having
[1:11:15] a communion service and he's he's given
[1:11:17] this and and here's the context of it he
[1:11:19] says what was it he said there was
[1:11:22] another William brandham SE a little
[1:11:26] spot of eternal life down there from the
[1:11:28] genes of God the word of God that was
[1:11:31] placed in there each one of you can
[1:11:33] think of similar things see it was
[1:11:36] working then look up to the trees and I
[1:11:39] think Leaf I seen you fall off last year
[1:11:42] and why are you back here back there
[1:11:44] again where where'd you come from what
[1:11:46] brought you here see it was that eternal
[1:11:49] life working in the body I I now then
[1:11:54] one day as I walked on that voice
[1:11:57] talking don't never smoke drink so forth
[1:12:00] and the young fellas and all got older
[1:12:03] see there was something
[1:12:05] moving but yet all at once I looked up
[1:12:08] and I said I'm not the son of Charles
[1:12:10] and L branam there's something calling
[1:12:14] like my little Eagle story I'm not a
[1:12:16] chicken there's something up yonder
[1:12:18] somewhere oh great Jehovah whoever you
[1:12:21] are open up I want to come home
[1:12:25] something in me calling do you have
[1:12:27] something in you calling when you say oh
[1:12:30] great Jehovah you might have been born
[1:12:31] in sin you might have winning sin to
[1:12:34] this very hour but something Burns in
[1:12:36] your heart and you want to say oh great
[1:12:38] Jehovah open to me I want to come
[1:12:42] home
[1:12:45] my something
[1:12:47] calling then I was born again that
[1:12:51] little life was laying there the life of
[1:12:54] water was poured on it then it began to
[1:12:56] grow now that old life was forgiven put
[1:12:59] in the sea of God's forgetfulness to
[1:13:01] Never Be Remembered against me no more
[1:13:04] now we stand Justified as though we had
[1:13:07] never sinned in the presence of God in
[1:13:10] the presence of God that's how you stand
[1:13:13] am I I saw and I I hate to keep going
[1:13:16] down sidetracks and I might not get
[1:13:18] through with this and we might have a
[1:13:19] tenth installment but is it okay yeah
[1:13:22] amen I I I've got I can't pass things
[1:13:25] when the Lord quickens it to me and I
[1:13:28] didn't put this in my notes but I
[1:13:29] thought if I remember it if the Lord
[1:13:30] brings it to me I'm going to tell it I
[1:13:32] you know he says here you know in the
[1:13:35] presence of God we stand Justified as
[1:13:37] though we never sinned in the presence
[1:13:39] of God and I I saw recently uh a reel
[1:13:43] that some church put out and it was
[1:13:45] wonderful it be make a great skit where
[1:13:48] there was a whole group of people in a
[1:13:50] line coming up and they were coming up
[1:13:52] to the Pearly Gates and there's one
[1:13:54] supposed you know I guess an angel
[1:13:56] whatever and he's standing there looking
[1:13:58] through the record and they come up with
[1:14:00] all of this it reminds me of Matthew 25
[1:14:02] and they're going to say well we did
[1:14:03] this and we did that and we did this in
[1:14:05] your name we preach the gospel we did
[1:14:06] all these Mighty works and he's going to
[1:14:08] say depart from me you workers of
[1:14:09] iniquity I never knew you and one after
[1:14:11] one they're coming up and say and
[1:14:13] they'll say well I I I went to church um
[1:14:17] well the next one comes up but I it was
[1:14:18] my mother's Church well I I did all
[1:14:22] kinds of good deeds in the in the earth
[1:14:23] step on the scale and they step on the
[1:14:27] scale and one right after another
[1:14:29] everybody has to step on the scale they
[1:14:31] get weighed Paul warned the world that
[1:14:36] would happen yes amen we shall all stand
[1:14:39] before the Judgment seat of Christ and
[1:14:41] give an account of our Deeds whether
[1:14:42] good or bad the only way you escape that
[1:14:45] judgment is to be seated on the throne
[1:14:47] with
[1:14:48] Christ see and that's why the Bible says
[1:14:51] that that that what you want to be is
[1:14:53] the man whose sins go before for you and
[1:14:56] that way when you get there they're
[1:14:57] already taken care of you've already
[1:14:58] been adjudicated and you're you're good
[1:15:00] take your place on the throne what you
[1:15:02] don't want to be is the man who got
[1:15:03] there and your sins followed some men
[1:15:05] sins follow them and then you got to
[1:15:07] answer you got to give an account for
[1:15:10] what you did or didn't do and every
[1:15:13] person was coming up well you know I I I
[1:15:15] never lied and I never cheated and I
[1:15:17] step on the scale sir step on the scale
[1:15:19] and step on the scale go sorry and then
[1:15:23] Here Comes Here Comes some person and
[1:15:27] says well I I uh sir I don't even know I
[1:15:31] I really can't think of anything good
[1:15:33] that I did I uh but and then suddenly
[1:15:36] Jesus steps
[1:15:38] up and the angel when when the person
[1:15:41] portraying Jesus got Jesus written here

[1:17:13] start breaking some of this down and I'm
[1:17:15] G to have to I can't I know I can't stop
[1:17:17] and preach on it but watch he comes from
[1:17:22] 1951 look deity I'm a part of Charles
[1:17:25] Brandon because I was born from Charlie
[1:17:27] brandham my Daddy I'm a part of him I
[1:17:30] got a forehead like him my hair was like
[1:17:32] him I'm a small man like him I'm in the
[1:17:34] ner n nature like him because he's my
[1:17:37] dad and if we become in spirit sons of
[1:17:41] God deity dwells in the man don't you
[1:17:45] love a hillbilly explanation amen my I
[1:17:49] love this there's no Greek words in that
[1:17:51] no Hebrew no apologetics you don't need
[1:17:53] to uh it's just straight forward that's
[1:17:56] sassr good
[1:17:58] stuff there's Honey in the Rock my
[1:18:01] brother then you talk about blind eyes
[1:18:04] being open see now this is Christ being
[1:18:06] able to work through you you talk about
[1:18:09] blind eyes being open they said nothing
[1:18:11] impossible to God God said nothing
[1:18:13] impossible with you if you believe
[1:18:17] not with you if you'll believe not with
[1:18:21] God but you deity is is in man the very
[1:18:26] God that I love this statement the very
[1:18:29] God that stood back there on the
[1:18:31] mystical platform of the eternities and
[1:18:34] rolled worlds off his hands and created
[1:18:38] these things give you the privilege to
[1:18:41] be his son and you're a part of him
[1:18:46] isn't that
[1:18:50] beautiful and God dwells in mankind
[1:18:54] and man himself is deity Hallelujah
[1:18:57] there you are might choke you but study
[1:19:01] over that a little while God dwells in
[1:19:04] man and man becomes a Son of God not in
[1:19:07] himself but the Holy Spirit that's in
[1:19:10] him is God the Creator lives in the
[1:19:13] creation you see the difference between
[1:19:16] this and
[1:19:17] Mormonism Mormonism takes you to
[1:19:20] actually become God and brother Bram
[1:19:23] starts saying the man is Divine but then
[1:19:25] he he's going to he's going to focus the
[1:19:28] lens further and he's going to show you
[1:19:29] this is not Mormon teaching because now
[1:19:32] he goes on to say the man becomes a Son
[1:19:35] of God not in himself but the Holy
[1:19:39] Spirit that's in him is God the Creator
[1:19:43] lives in the creation you with
[1:19:46] me he goes on finally in this sermon oh
[1:19:50] my how I love that then stand with
[1:19:55] then stand with an unwavering faith and
[1:19:59] ask what you will and it'll be done unto
[1:20:02] you there he is God there he is it's God
[1:20:08] dwelling in you and you surrendered to
[1:20:11] him and then you ask what you will CU it
[1:20:13] won't be you asking or even thinking
[1:20:15] what to ask or speaking it'll be God
[1:20:17] because you are abiding with Christ and
[1:20:21] Christ with you and then you will ask
[1:20:23] what you will that's what Jesus said
[1:20:26] right after he said abide amen good see
[1:20:31] so this is the very thing we've been
[1:20:32] trying to get across you now he's going
[1:20:34] to come forward that's 1951 here's
[1:20:37] 1956 so now he's going to go to the
[1:20:41] Jordan where John is baptizing
[1:20:47] watch and John said I suddenly don't
[1:20:50] hear myself anymore brother to switch me
[1:20:52] to the pull pit mic if you need to
[1:20:55] and John said I bear record seeing the
[1:21:00] spirit of God like a dove this is going
[1:21:01] to help you to understand how Jesus was
[1:21:05] completely a man but completely
[1:21:09] God I bear record seeing the spirit of
[1:21:12] God like a dove coming down and abiding
[1:21:14] on him Hallelujah there you are the Dove
[1:21:18] and the lamb United together that's when
[1:21:22] God and man became one that's when
[1:21:25] Heaven and Earth embraced each other
[1:21:28] Hallelujah that's when God was made
[1:21:32] flesh brought it that's when let me move
[1:21:35] this screen that
[1:21:37] um that's when God was made flesh
[1:21:39] brought it that's when God came down
[1:21:42] from the spirit form and was made a man
[1:21:45] and dwelt Among Us that's when all
[1:21:47] eternities embraced each other that's
[1:21:50] when the human Fallen race of Adam's
[1:21:52] people and Jehovah God and every Angel
[1:21:55] come together when God and man was made
[1:21:58] one on that great Memorial Day when John
[1:22:01] baptized
[1:22:03] Jesus see so so prior to his baptism he
[1:22:06] lived as a as a man and now he didn't
[1:22:09] need the Holy Ghost to give him a new
[1:22:11] birth he didn't come Fallen but it came
[1:22:13] to empower his ministry so they could go
[1:22:16] forward and it and it was the embracing
[1:22:18] of Heaven and Earth in a single man and
[1:22:21] now God brother random said it's so
[1:22:23] simple God dwelt in a man called Jesus
[1:22:26] Christ
[1:22:28] see all right the perfect now he comes
[1:22:31] to the Masterpiece oh this gets good the
[1:22:35] Masterpiece let me see if I'm uh still
[1:22:38] in line I am
[1:22:40] good The Perfect Image the God man God
[1:22:45] in morphe had changed from Supernatural
[1:22:49] to the vision and the vision was
[1:22:50] projected into the image and the image
[1:22:53] was smitten so that the Supernatural
[1:22:55] could taste the feeling of death God's
[1:22:57] perfect Masterpiece is that easy Jesus
[1:22:59] was the image of God see the express
[1:23:02] image the Bible calls him so he says he
[1:23:05] could not do it in Moses he could not do
[1:23:08] it in the prophets Isaiah who was sawed
[1:23:11] with saws till he sawed to Pieces he
[1:23:13] could not do it in the prophets that
[1:23:14] were stoned he could not do it because
[1:23:17] he couldn't feel it there was just a
[1:23:19] portion of him speaking of those great
[1:23:22] prophets there's just a portion of him
[1:23:24] but in this perfect
[1:23:26] Masterpiece he was the fullness of the
[1:23:30] godhead bodily he could not only project
[1:23:33] Moses he could project his entire being
[1:23:35] into this person and taste death for the
[1:23:38] whole human race God's perfect
[1:23:41] Masterpiece this blows trinitarianism
[1:23:44] out of the water God's perfect
[1:23:47] Masterpiece God so inspired by seeing it
[1:23:50] he become a redeemer of all ages to
[1:23:53] speak for those in the back grounds who
[1:23:54] had been before and now all promises was
[1:23:59] met in him he was the Perfection of the
[1:24:02] Perfection all types was fulfilled in
[1:24:05] him our kinsman redeemer in Ruth and
[1:24:08] Boaz our lawgiver from Mount SII our
[1:24:11] Prophet from the Wilderness as he come
[1:24:13] from the mountain as he come from the
[1:24:14] Wilderness as he come from eternity and
[1:24:17] became man The Perfect Image hallelujah
[1:24:23] amen the Perfect Image see so so you
[1:24:29] know oh no I can't I can't I can't I
[1:24:32] want to finish these
[1:24:33] quotes we'll have to maybe make that a
[1:24:36] next a next installment let me keep
[1:24:39] going 1965 God's only provided place of
[1:24:45] worship I stood Yonder in Los Angeles at
[1:24:49] Forest Lawn one day there is a statue of
[1:24:52] Moses by Michelangelo
[1:24:54] that great something in that sculpture
[1:24:57] that Vision that he had of what Moses
[1:24:59] ought to be with was only portraying and
[1:25:03] type of the great father God and he had
[1:25:06] in his heart before the foundation of
[1:25:09] the world a son because he's a father so
[1:25:12] he's he's saying like like Michelangelo
[1:25:15] had something inside him that had to get
[1:25:17] out by expression and so he crafted with
[1:25:21] tools he built he built a body and he
[1:25:24] was so inspired because of the vision
[1:25:26] I'm just taking a sidebar he got so
[1:25:28] inspired from the vision that he took
[1:25:30] his hammer and smote it and said the
[1:25:33] most illogical thing that him a man of
[1:25:35] science should know better
[1:25:37] speak which was ridiculous it's Stone
[1:25:41] but that's how inspired he got because
[1:25:44] he saw an inward Vision imagine how
[1:25:47] inspired God get God was when he saw
[1:25:50] Christ willing to say not my will thine
[1:25:53] be done imagine how inspired he is for
[1:25:55] you brothers and sisters teenagers
[1:25:58] married single when you would say not my
[1:26:00] will Lord I don't want this world I want
[1:26:02] you I want your image I want my whole
[1:26:05] life to be an image of you something you
[1:26:07] can be proud of something you can walk
[1:26:09] through and live through and talk
[1:26:13] through and the and and and so brother
[1:26:16] Brenham says when he struck it on the
[1:26:18] knee a piece flew off and he said you
[1:26:21] can even put
[1:26:22] your hand in the indention where he hid
[1:26:25] it and they they portrayed it like a
[1:26:29] tragedy oh man this was a a perfect
[1:26:31] Masterpiece but he's he HIIT it and it
[1:26:33] and now it's marred but brother brandham
[1:26:35] because this is the way prophets would
[1:26:37] think brother brandham said well to me
[1:26:40] the the marring is what made it a
[1:26:43] masterpiece and I because that's what
[1:26:45] made Jesus a masterpiece that he was
[1:26:47] marred and see and it showed there was a
[1:26:50] sacrifice it showed that someone paid a
[1:26:52] price for me paid a price for you and I
[1:26:55] thought I remember way back in the day I
[1:26:56] was just a young preacher and that
[1:26:58] stirred up my heart and I thought that's
[1:27:00] exactly right because if if if he's the
[1:27:04] Masterpiece it means and a piece flew
[1:27:06] off and that's me I came from him and
[1:27:11] I'm a peace and he's the master
[1:27:15] peace Hallelujah he's the master to all
[1:27:18] the pieces and I'm part of him and I was
[1:27:21] in him and I came from him and I'm going
[1:27:23] back to him and there's going to be a
[1:27:24] whole Kingdom of
[1:27:27] him oh my oh you're guaranteed friends
[1:27:31] when you when you follow this message
[1:27:33] you're guaranteed to hear things you
[1:27:34] don't hear in the average Sunday morning
[1:27:35] pull pit Oh Glory to
[1:27:39] God
[1:27:41] Amen so he goes
[1:27:43] on he
[1:27:45] says so I I just had to I just had to
[1:27:47] blow that out he had in his heart before
[1:27:50] the foundation of the world a son
[1:27:51] because he's a father but it was still
[1:27:54] in the genes of his word and he created
[1:27:57] a man and he had to put him on free
[1:27:59] moral agency but that man fell but the
[1:28:02] great sculptor God who made man from the
[1:28:05] dust of the earth he didn't settle for
[1:28:07] that he started making man again I don't
[1:28:10] have it here today on this quote on
[1:28:12] these quotes but brother brandom oh it's
[1:28:14] so grips it tears the heart out of me it
[1:28:16] fills me with inspiration and brother
[1:28:18] brandham says when when he saw oh my
[1:28:23] when he saw his great
[1:28:25] creation Adam and his bride and a garden
[1:28:30] and God had made it perfect and it was
[1:28:32] beautiful and it was Flawless and he
[1:28:35] said when he saw his Masterpiece laying
[1:28:39] face down in ruin he said he did not
[1:28:43] throw it away he started over he said
[1:28:46] because he's God and he won't be
[1:28:50] defeated I'm so glad today I can't
[1:28:53] defeat him you can't defeat him
[1:28:55] Hallelujah I'm part of his Heritage and
[1:28:58] there's not enough devils in hell to
[1:29:00] stop me from being rebuilt Into His
[1:29:03] Image Hallelujah yes sir and he
[1:29:08] says he oh I got to get past this quote
[1:29:11] my goodness he had to put it on free
[1:29:13] moral
[1:29:15] agency but that man fell but the great
[1:29:18] sculptor God who made man from the dust
[1:29:21] of the earth he didn't settle for that
[1:29:23] he started making man again and he made
[1:29:26] a Noah he died drunk he made a Moses
[1:29:30] imagine this he made a Moses that failed
[1:29:32] to keep his word he made prophets that
[1:29:35] run in the time of trouble and he kept
[1:29:38] building and molding until after a while
[1:29:41] he wanted a masterpiece to reflect him
[1:29:45] his nature that was in his heart what a
[1:29:49] son should be on one day down on Jordan
[1:29:55] after that Masterpiece had been formed
[1:29:57] and made here he come descending down on
[1:30:01] the wings of a dove and said this is him
[1:30:05] he was so enthused with this masterpiece
[1:30:08] until he struck him on Calvary that he
[1:30:11] would die for the rest of us that's
[1:30:14] imperfect that through the shedding of
[1:30:17] his blood he might bring many
[1:30:20] masterpieces being his bride to his son
[1:30:24] we who were imperfect come on we who
[1:30:28] were
[1:30:29] imperfect he traded the a perfect for
[1:30:32] the imperfect oh
[1:30:35] Hallelujah Masterpiece is scarred
[1:30:38] because of the enthusiasm of God to see
[1:30:41] such a masterpiece he struck him for us
[1:30:43] all see there he died to perfect we who
[1:30:49] are say it with me imperfect read it
[1:30:53] again he died to perfect we who are
[1:30:58] imperfect there's no denominational
[1:31:01] mixture in it anywhere my house my
[1:31:06] children born of my genes amen glory to
[1:31:11] God my genes are in them I will put my
[1:31:15] word in them I'll write them upon the
[1:31:18] tables of their heart that's my family
[1:31:23] the family of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:31:28] the family are you the family of the
[1:31:31] body of Jesus Christ then if we are
[1:31:35] brother brandham said if you found he
[1:31:37] said he talked about the old back in
[1:31:39] slavery days and the one that they
[1:31:40] didn't have to drive him at all he
[1:31:42] worked because he realized way across
[1:31:45] the ocean he was a son of a king and
[1:31:48] though he was captive against his will
[1:31:50] he conducted himself like a King's son
[1:31:53] do you realize that you're part of the
[1:31:55] body of Jesus Christ you're the family
[1:31:59] of almighty
[1:32:00] God we should conduct ourselves so amen
[1:32:04] do you believe that will you accept that
[1:32:06] will you accept that that's what abiding
[1:32:08] in Christ is all about
[1:32:11] amen it's not just it's not just it's
[1:32:16] not just you who came to him weary and
[1:32:19] heavy laden it's you who have been
[1:32:21] willing since that day to learn of him
[1:32:24] it's you who have been willing to take
[1:32:26] his yoke upon you or not but if you have
[1:32:29] been then you have gone to a next level
[1:32:31] of rest where you can say to this
[1:32:33] mountain because it's actually him
[1:32:35] speaking through you because you're the
[1:32:37] body of Jesus Christ you're part of the
[1:32:39] family by a gene of
[1:32:42] God I'll give you this one finally and
[1:32:44] we're going to go home here it is I told
[1:32:46] you if these last two screens it's one
[1:32:49] quote I just had to put it on two
[1:32:50] screens so you could see
[1:32:52] it I I could this could be the last
[1:32:54] words out of my mouth in a pull pit and
[1:32:56] I could face God and sayl I gave it my
[1:32:58] best and I I sh not to declare unto them
[1:33:01] the whole Council of God leadership
[1:33:06] 1965 what a rebuke to
[1:33:09] Christianity we're supposed to represent
[1:33:11] God and eternal life there's only one
[1:33:14] form of eternal life and that's God he
[1:33:16] alone has eternal life and we are
[1:33:19] products of his because we're genes of
[1:33:23] his spirit
[1:33:24] it then we should conduct ourselves
[1:33:28] women and men like the Bible said for us
[1:33:30] to do not Jezebels of the street and
[1:33:33] Ricky of the organization but Christian
[1:33:36] gentlemen Sons and Daughters of God born

[1:33:51] those last three words there so it can
[1:33:53] never be challenged

[1:33:57] what he said and he said yep that's
[1:34:00] exactly
[1:34:02] righten that we should conduct ourself
[1:34:06] women and men like the Bible said for us
[1:34:09] to do not Jezebels of the street and
[1:34:11] Ricky of the organization but Christian
[1:34:14] gentlemen Sons and Daughters of God born
[1:34:17] of the spirit of God manifesting the
[1:34:20] light in our days and scattering it

[1:35:10] installments later you should really

[1:35:16] level of rest that the Lord is calling
[1:35:19] us
[1:35:20] to I have proven to you that that's
[1:35:23] going to be the Avenue through which the
[1:35:25] third pole

[1:35:32] operating in you because that's the
[1:35:34] spoken word see that's and and and that
[1:35:38] and that that it it's even at a level in
[1:35:41] the day and hour that you and I live in
[1:35:45] we were talking about this a couple
[1:35:47] installments ago where brother randam
[1:35:48] said it won't be used in a big way you
[1:35:51] remember that and we were kind of like
[1:35:53] wait what
[1:35:54] you you created animals out of thin air
