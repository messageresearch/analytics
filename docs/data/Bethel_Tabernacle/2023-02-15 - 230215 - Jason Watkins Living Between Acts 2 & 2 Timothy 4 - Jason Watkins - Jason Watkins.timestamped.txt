[2:31] Lord, first of all, I just want you to
[2:32] know I love you.
[2:35] And I'm so sorry for the failings in my
[2:38] life, Father. How I long for that day
[2:40] when this old mortal will put on

[2:45] There'll be no negative thoughts.
[2:48] no negative actions.
[2:51] It'll all be yay and amen according to
[2:53] your word. Father,
[2:55] I pray that you'll bless the people that
[2:57] gather this evening. Bless those that
[2:59] are streaming.
[3:01] Lord, you always have a purpose.
[3:04] You always have a an objective for each
[3:08] and every one of us, Father. You're not
[3:10] like we are, Father.
[3:13] There's not a shadow of turning.
[3:17] I praise you this evening, Lord. I thank
[3:19] you for this opportunity to gather with
[3:21] your children. Father, I pray you bless
[3:24] each one. And as we gather the tithes
[3:26] and offerings, Father, bless the
[3:29] cheerful giver, Lord.
[3:31] Most of all, Father, magnify the gift,
[3:36] Father, the ministering of your word
[3:38] that it would touch each and every heart
[3:41] and may we leave closer than when we
[3:43] came in.

[25:53] Give the Lord a hand this evening. Let
[25:55] him know how much you appreciate him.
[25:58] Amen.
[26:00] Amen. I certainly do appreciate him.
[26:03] Appreciate all of you being out here
[26:04] tonight. We're going to invite you right
[26:06] to the book of Acts, chapter 2. Greet
[26:08] you in the name of the Lord. I want to
[26:10] by the help of the Lord um take a um a
[26:15] scripture or rather a text tonight. It's
[26:17] a little lengthy, but uh I want to take
[26:20] a thought on living between Acts 2 and 2
[26:25] Timothy 4, the path to redemption. Amen.
[26:30] So, the Lord being our helper tonight,
[26:32] we will start in Acts chapter 2. Now, of
[26:36] course, this is uh Peter's indictment
[26:39] message. And as I've pointed out to you
[26:42] many times before, Peter was not
[26:45] preaching to drunkards and whoreongers.
[26:48] He was preaching to devout Jews who were
[26:51] there for church.
[26:53] They had came in from all all points of
[26:55] the world to worship because they were
[26:58] there for the feast. And so they were
[27:00] devout Jews. So when he, you know,
[27:03] remember that when it when it's all
[27:06] about repentance, what Peter's point is,
[27:09] accept the word. Accept it. Repent of
[27:12] your old thinking. Come to the word. See
[27:15] that? Now this is exactly if you think
[27:17] about that, you'll find brother Brandham
[27:20] saying
[27:22] drinking, smoking, committing adultery,
[27:24] that's not sin.
[27:26] That's not sin. That's just merely the
[27:28] byproducts of sin. That's the attributes
[27:30] of unbelief. You do those things because
[27:32] you've not been converted. You're not a
[27:34] believer. See? And so, but but sin is
[27:37] unbelief. And that was what they were
[27:40] guilty of. They they were devout men.
[27:42] They didn't drink and smoke and run
[27:45] around. But they were guilty of sin
[27:47] because when the word came in flesh,
[27:49] they didn't recognize it and they
[27:50] crucified it. And so they said, "What
[27:53] must we do now that we've done this?"
[27:54] And Peter said, "You got to repent."
[27:56] See, so the whole aspect of because the
[28:00] promise is unto you, right? But the but
[28:04] the requirement for that is to say amen
[28:07] to every word of God. That's got to be
[28:10] first. And that's got to start with an
[28:12] admission that you've been wrong.
[28:15] Amen.
[28:15] Amen.
[28:17] And and that's the real spirit on the
[28:18] bride today, Brother Brandham said, is
[28:20] the is this is the spirit to say, I'm
[28:22] I'm wrong.
[28:24] Only he's right. Amen. All right. So,
[28:27] let's read Acts chapter 2 and um let
[28:31] we're just going to catch from verse 37.
[28:37] Now, when they heard this, they were
[28:39] pricricked in their heart. He had just
[28:41] told them, "You killed the you killed
[28:42] the son of God." Now, when they heard
[28:45] this, they were pricricked in their
[28:46] where? In their heart. And said unto
[28:49] Peter and to the rest of the apostles,
[28:52] "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[28:54] Then Peter said unto them,"Repent
[28:57] and be baptized, every one of you in the
[29:01] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[29:04] of sins, and ye shall receive the gift
[29:07] of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is
[29:10] unto you and to your children, and to
[29:13] all that are a far off, even as many as
[29:17] the Lord our God shall call." So forever
[29:20] the path to the new birth comes by
[29:25] saying amen to the word of God.
[29:28] Amen.
[29:28] That's the pathway.
[29:30] Amen. All right. And that's going to be
[29:32] for all generations. All right. Then
[29:35] says, "And with All right. And uh and
[29:38] verse 40, and with many other words did
[29:41] he testify and exhort, saying, save
[29:44] yourselves from this untoward
[29:46] generation." Then they that gladly
[29:50] received his word were baptized. And the
[29:53] same day, didn't say everybody did it,
[29:55] but the ones that received his word
[29:58] gladly were baptized. And the same day
[30:01] there were added unto them about 3,000
[30:04] souls. Now I love this next verse. And
[30:07] they, now here's an evidence that the
[30:09] new birth took place. And they continued
[30:13] steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and
[30:16] fellowship and in breaking of bread and
[30:18] in prayers. So it was obvious that going
[30:21] forward they lived a different kind of a
[30:23] life.
[30:23] Amen.
[30:24] Amen. And that which they had formed the
[30:27] the reason I'm you're going to
[30:28] understand that when I read 2 Timothy 4
[30:30] and we're going to uh we'll just catch
[30:32] we'll start at verse one right before
[30:35] the book of Hebrews. you'll run right
[30:38] right over to second Timothy and you're
[30:41] you're going to find now an agreement
[30:45] worded a different way.
[30:47] You're going to find an agreement with
[30:49] what I just taught you about Acts two
[30:51] only worded a different way. All right.
[30:53] Verse one.
[30:55] I charge thee therefore before God and
[30:58] the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge
[31:01] the quick and the dead at his appearing
[31:03] and his kingdom. So those go together.
[31:05] Amen.
[31:06] Preach the word. Be instant in season,
[31:09] out of season. Reprove, re, rebuke,
[31:12] exhort with all longsuffering and
[31:13] doctrine. Now watch him prophesy about
[31:15] the day you're living in right now in
[31:18] real time. All right. For the time will
[31:21] come, that's now, when they will not
[31:24] endure sound doctrine. Now, where was
[31:28] where was what were they what had he
[31:30] said just before this word doctrine?
[31:32] Preach the word. So they're it's not
[31:35] just about resisting doctrine. It's
[31:37] about resisting the word.
[31:38] Yeah.
[31:39] All right. For the time will come when
[31:41] they will not endure sound doctrine. But
[31:43] after their own lust shall they heap to
[31:46] themselves teachers having itching ears.
[31:48] You remember that I said to you that
[31:51] when you are not born again of the
[31:53] spirit of God, you will hunt around
[31:56] until you find the version of the gospel
[31:59] that you want to be true.
[32:01] Amen. Not maybe the version that is
[32:03] true, but the one you wish was true.
[32:06] See, and there's plenty of it out there.
[32:08] There's 30 north of 33,000 versions of
[32:12] the gospel. Can you believe that? That's
[32:15] the truth. And they shall turn away.
[32:17] Verse four.
[32:19] And they are, let's read verse three
[32:21] again. Sorry, Ethan. For the time will
[32:22] come when they will not endure sound
[32:24] doctrine, but after their own lust, see
[32:28] the one they want to be true, shall they
[32:30] heap to themselves teachers having
[32:32] itching ears, and they shall turn away
[32:35] their ears from the truth. Can you
[32:37] believe somebody would do that? It's
[32:39] hard for us to believe as believers
[32:41] anybody would be that crazy. But this is
[32:44] exactly what the prophecy was for the
[32:46] end time. They shall turn away their
[32:48] ears from the truth and shall be turned
[32:51] unto fables. And how my verse five, but
[32:56] watch thou in all things, endure
[33:00] afflictions, do the work of an
[33:02] evangelist, make full proof of thy
[33:04] ministry, for I am now ready to be
[33:07] offered, and the time of my departure is
[33:10] at hand. I love this. I have fought a
[33:13] good fight. I Paul is saying I have
[33:17] finished my course. Now, can you say
[33:21] amen?
[33:22] Amen.
[33:22] Why? He's talking about himself, not
[33:24] you.
[33:25] Why are you saying amen?
[33:26] Unless you're included, too.
[33:29] Amen.
[33:31] See, it's great for Paul. What about me?
[33:34] Brother Brandham talks about Jesus said
[33:36] he rose from the grave. That was great
[33:37] for him. But what does that have to do
[33:39] with me?
[33:40] Unless I am enjoined to him. See, then
[33:44] it's just a Easter is just another day
[33:46] on the calendar where we dress up. All
[33:48] right. For I am now ready to be offered
[33:51] and the time of my departure is at hand.
[33:53] I have fought a good fight. I have
[33:56] finished my course. I have kept the
[33:58] faith. Paul, can you throw me a bone? I
[34:01] will stand by. Henceforth
[34:03] there is laid up for me. Come on, Paul.
[34:06] Help me. A crown of righteousness.
[34:08] Wonderful. What about me? Which the
[34:10] Lord, the righteous judge, shall give
[34:12] me. Come on, Paul. Help me. At that day.
[34:15] Yeah, I'm at that day. And not to me
[34:18] only, but unto all them also that love
[34:22] his appearing.
[34:24] So your path to redemption is through
[34:27] the love of his appearing.
[34:29] So it's Acts two set a different way.
[34:32] You've said amen to the word because
[34:34] why? The word has become your love. And
[34:37] now when he appears in this last day in
[34:39] the form of his word, you're in love
[34:41] with that.
[34:44] See, so you're living between Acts 2 and
[34:48] 2 Corinthians 4. Now, it's broader than
[34:51] that. I'm just using that for a title
[34:52] tonight. Let's pray. Father, we thank
[34:55] you for your word. Thank you for the
[34:56] anointing I already feel. I pray your
[34:59] blessing will be upon the remainder of
[35:01] the service. Bless speaker and hearer.
[35:03] We commit it to you in Jesus name. Amen.
[35:05] God bless you. You can be seated.
[35:16] When we look at the realities of the
[35:19] word of God and try to give me your
[35:21] focus pretty quickly here because I'm I
[35:24] want to I want to go right through it
[35:26] and I don't want to go slow. Uh we want
[35:29] to have time for prayer. and I got a
[35:30] number pretty good list for prayer
[35:32] requests tonight and we hope maybe
[35:33] somebody have a testimony or two. So
[35:36] when we look at the realities that the
[35:39] word brings to us in this day, you know,
[35:42] the the scripture is is not short as we
[35:44] have said many times that the Lord did
[35:47] not leave us short when it came to what
[35:49] we would need to face the enemy in this
[35:52] hour. We've not been left short-handed.
[35:55] Our ammunition supply isn't low. Our
[35:58] weapons are are are they are they are
[36:02] they are for the day that you live in
[36:05] that God has sent a cuttingedge weapon.
[36:08] As I've said to you before, I don't have
[36:11] any power. I can't give you the new
[36:13] birth.
[36:14] But I do have a weapon.
[36:16] I don't have any power to heal you, but
[36:19] I do have a weapon.
[36:20] I don't have power to drive the enemy
[36:22] from you, but I do have a weapon. And it
[36:25] has all kinds of power. and and and and
[36:29] part of its power is revealing to you
[36:32] the position you hold which is a
[36:35] position of authority.
[36:37] So now it's not about power at all. It's
[36:40] about authority and it's about
[36:42] recognizing who you are and the very day
[36:45] and hour that we live in. And that's so
[36:47] important. speaking to a brother uh just
[36:50] before service how that that this is the
[36:53] day we already read Paul's prophecy
[36:55] about the day that would come and where
[36:57] we're in it where they would um they
[37:00] would turn aside to fables they would go
[37:02] for 20 centuries and the Christian
[37:05] church would stand for certain
[37:07] principles that were for 20 centuries
[37:10] immovable
[37:11] unbendable no compromise and now today
[37:15] they compromise on almost every last one
[37:17] of them
[37:19] And you you know it's it's amazing that
[37:21] that that you that you can find uh this
[37:24] going on in the day and hour that we
[37:26] live in. And so we realize that the hour
[37:28] would come at the end time where mankind
[37:31] would lose his ability to discern
[37:33] between right and wrong. Now that's
[37:34] where we were Sunday.
[37:36] We were showing you from Ezekiel how
[37:38] that there were there was a priesthood
[37:40] that worked the outer court and the
[37:42] inner court. And they could tell you
[37:43] they could be at the at the brazen
[37:45] altar. They could be at the at the
[37:47] washing. They could be at the at the
[37:49] seven lampstands. They could be at the
[37:51] table of shoeb bread. Not saying they
[37:53] didn't have the gospel. Yeah. I'm not
[37:55] saying Billy Graham didn't have the
[37:56] gospel. He could tell me about Jesus. He
[37:58] could tell me God so loved the world. He
[38:01] could tell me Christ died to save
[38:02] sinners.
[38:04] You understand? There's all kinds of
[38:06] priesthood that have definite callings
[38:08] on their life to do exactly that. To
[38:11] tell me some of those things. But then
[38:13] there there was there was a there was a
[38:15] family, not not really a tribe, but an
[38:18] exact family. And unto that one family
[38:21] was committed, the discernment upon that
[38:24] family was the discernment to discern
[38:26] between right and wrong. And if there
[38:29] was ever a day that we needed God to
[38:31] send a messenger with a discernment that
[38:33] could tell me more than just about Jesus
[38:36] loved me and died to save sinners, I
[38:38] need that.
[38:39] I've got to have that. I've got to
[38:41] accept that. But I'm in a day where
[38:44] they're all calling wrong right. And I
[38:47] had to have a voice that could say this
[38:49] is right and this is wrong. And it'll be
[38:51] that way in the 1960s. And it'll be that
[38:54] way in the 21st century.
[38:55] Amen.
[38:58] And what's right will be right until the
[39:01] day you leave. And what's wrong will
[39:05] still be wrong until the day the saints
[39:08] resurrect and we are changed.
[39:11] So th this is the beauty of uh uh that
[39:14] God has not left us as I said under
[39:16] equipped. And we find then that that the
[39:19] Bible prophesies that the people at that
[39:22] hour the people where who the the family
[39:26] of God and this has never been true
[39:28] until now. Just like just like Satan's
[39:30] Eden has never been true until now. Now,
[39:32] Brother Brandon proved that from Paul's
[39:34] writings that that this is the he's the
[39:37] god of this evil age. That had never
[39:39] been true until after the seals were
[39:41] opened. See, and it couldn't have been
[39:43] it couldn't actually not only couldn't
[39:45] have been, it couldn't be because they
[39:48] first they they first had to crucify the
[39:50] word. And they they couldn't crucify
[39:52] Jesus before they had him.
[39:54] Right. Amen.
[39:55] And there's no way in this day to
[39:57] crucify the word until they had it. And
[40:00] then when they crucified the word, then
[40:02] an indictment could come and then God
[40:04] could call a bride out of a church
[40:06] honoring Elijah anointing and you would
[40:08] be the final voice to the final age.
[40:10] Is that easy?
[40:11] Amen.
[40:12] And we would be that group who at the at
[40:17] this particular special last day, the
[40:21] end of the end time, that the people in
[40:24] that day who know their God, now it's
[40:27] not a head knowledge,
[40:28] right?
[40:29] You understand? And we're talking about
[40:30] to know like like a husband knows his
[40:33] wife like Adam knew his wife Eve. That
[40:35] kind of relationship, that kind of
[40:38] intimacy. The people who in that day
[40:41] when nobody could tell right from wrong,
[40:43] in that day when they turn uh itching
[40:45] ears, they get preachers with itching
[40:47] ears in that day when they turn from
[40:50] truth into fables.
[40:52] Amen.
[40:53] In that day, they won't have a a
[40:56] tolerance for the word. And if you try
[40:59] to give them the word, then they cancel
[41:02] you.
[41:03] Amen.
[41:04] See?
[41:05] And so that that's the that's the
[41:08] prevailing attitude. And it's at that
[41:10] day that whoever is alive at that day,
[41:14] the people within that last part of
[41:16] humanity who know their God will do
[41:20] great exploits. Now friends,
[41:23] if the Bible takes the time to point
[41:25] that out, it's not like exploits hadn't
[41:28] been done all through the Bible.
[41:30] So if the Bible is pointing out a book
[41:33] full of exploits that the people of that
[41:35] day will do great exploits, I would say
[41:38] it had to be something pretty special.
[41:40] And that's where you need to be tonight
[41:42] for your strength. You need to recognize
[41:44] I have arrived at that day. I am that
[41:47] person and God is looking to me to do
[41:50] great. We say, "What? What will I do?
[41:52] Why don't we leave that up to him? How
[41:54] about we do this? How about we know him
[41:56] in the power of his resurrection?"
[41:58] Amen.
[42:00] We're not chasing works. We're not
[42:02] chasing signs. We're not chasing
[42:03] sensations. We're chasing consecration.
[42:07] And you don't really chase that. You
[42:09] surrender your way to it.
[42:10] Yeah.
[42:11] You pursue it in that in that regard.
[42:14] You pursue by humility, by surrender.
[42:17] You know, Paul said, "Press toward."
[42:21] And that word press in the Greek means
[42:22] to stretch, to strain. And a lot of
[42:25] times, you know,
[42:27] listen, you know as well as me. I'm not
[42:29] going to tell you anything new with this
[42:31] sentence coming. You know as well as me,
[42:34] Leodysa has a way of making you not need
[42:36] to strain.
[42:39] Everything just easy.
[42:42] And it's that's by that's by design of
[42:45] the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[42:48] But you see to get something worth
[42:51] something there needs to be a price.
[42:54] There needs to be a struggle. There
[42:56] needs to be a press because that's the
[42:58] kind of people that's what builds
[43:00] character. And God is building not a
[43:03] kingdom full of intellectuals.
[43:06] He's building a kingdom full of
[43:08] character
[43:09] and people who are willing to take the
[43:12] way with the Lord's despised few.
[43:15] They're not only a few, but they're
[43:16] despised.
[43:18] See, that's that was uh Elijah's word to
[43:21] Elisha. You know, help you know, let me
[43:24] let me go and and tell my mother, my
[43:26] father. He says, you know, what what
[43:28] have I to do with thee? He just cast his
[43:30] mantle on him. Knight's saying, what
[43:31] have I to do with thee? you know, and
[43:34] and and and you know what if you if you
[43:37] go back and I don't have time for the
[43:38] lesson tonight, but when you go back and
[43:40] break down the Hebrew, what what Elijah
[43:42] is saying to Elisha is, "Listen, Elisha,
[43:46] think this through. I'm not a popular
[43:49] man.
[43:50] The the king hates me.
[43:53] The queen's trying to kill me. All the
[43:55] churches have forsaken me. I live in the
[43:58] desert. My life is hard. you you you've
[44:02] got your hand to a plow. I see you've
[44:04] got your hand to a plow. Let me give you
[44:05] a principle that's going to become true
[44:08] in and in in some hundreds of years when
[44:10] Jesus says it, but it's still already
[44:12] true right now. You've got your hand on
[44:14] a plow and you can put it on, take it
[44:15] off. But the plow that I'm talking
[44:17] about, once you put your hand to that
[44:19] plow, you don't take it off, Elisha.
[44:21] You don't take your hand off of this
[44:23] plow. The one that plow is fine. Not the
[44:25] one I'm talking about. See? And so, you
[44:28] know, this thing isn't for sissies.
[44:32] This thing is for character. This is for
[44:34] people with courage. This is for people
[44:36] who are willing to do what it takes to
[44:39] have the spiritual recognition that they
[44:41] need, the spiritual sensitivity that we
[44:43] need. You're only going to you're not
[44:45] going to get that, listen friends, by
[44:46] intellectualism or by emotionalism.
[44:48] You're going to get that by a personal
[44:50] one- on-one close constant often
[44:54] relationship and contact with the Holy
[44:56] Spirit. And the only way that that's
[44:58] going to be possible is you're going to
[45:00] have to get rid of some stuff out of
[45:02] your life that Satan uses to bog you
[45:05] down, take all your time, frustrate you,
[45:07] tire you, wear you out, irritate you.
[45:11] Entertain you,
[45:14] you're you've been entertained so much
[45:16] the Lord can't even entertain you
[45:17] anymore because you're so bored with
[45:19] entertainment.
[45:20] [Music]
[45:22] you you you've spent so much time
[45:24] talking on social media, you don't feel
[45:26] like talking to the Lord.
[45:29] And we're getting close to home tonight.
[45:32] But it takes a people who are willing to
[45:35] recognize the day and hour that they
[45:36] live in and say, "I'm not going to be
[45:38] the dumb driven cattle that go into the
[45:41] tribulation. I'm going to be different."
[45:43] Amen.
[45:44] I'm going to be these people that do
[45:46] great exploits. I'm going to be these
[45:48] people who recognize his appearing and
[45:50] love it and my life is going to prove
[45:53] where my love is.
[45:56] So, we have all of these realities and
[45:59] the clarity of the word,
[46:01] you know, the clarity of the word that
[46:03] we have today gives us uh gives us the
[46:07] ability to discern between right and
[46:11] wrong. Brother Luther, if you could
[46:12] fetch the water, please. gives us the
[46:14] ability to to discern between right and
[46:18] wrong. And and that's an important point
[46:22] because
[46:24] the word that God has sent you. Now, I'm
[46:26] going to I'm going to really lay slather
[46:29] the old southern word. We were talking
[46:31] about that the other night. I'm going to
[46:32] slather this one on thick because this
[46:34] is a big big point. And I didn't even
[46:37] realize how big it was till I said it
[46:39] out loud to myself today on the when I
[46:43] was having commentary on uh brother
[46:45] Jack's morning Bible study lesson and
[46:47] and I was called on for commentary and I
[46:49] made this statement. I said, "Wow,
[46:50] that's amazing." And then the more I
[46:52] said it, the more I realized it. But
[46:54] when you think about what God has given
[46:56] us in this in this day, he has given you
[47:00] in the word that he brought. I'm going
[47:03] to add some value. I promise when I get
[47:05] done saying this, you're going to have
[47:06] more value in the word of God that God
[47:08] has given us in this day. What it has
[47:11] done is it has given us the ability to
[47:15] discern between the spirit of Christ and
[47:18] the spirit of Antichrist
[47:21] in the modern day. You say, "Oh yeah,
[47:23] that's kind of we kind of known that for
[47:25] a long time." But I I wonder if you've
[47:27] really thought about how epic that is
[47:30] because think about how impacting
[47:33] to humanity to let me let me use a a
[47:38] more gripping phrase to human
[47:40] civilization.
[47:44] Think about how impacting this principle
[47:47] is to human civilization. That is given
[47:51] that the entire population of humanity
[47:56] will be annihilated following uh the in
[48:00] the tribulation following the antichrist
[48:05] unaware.
[48:07] I'm going to say that again. The entire
[48:10] population, the global population of
[48:14] humankind
[48:16] is going, the entire population, 7 and a
[48:20] half billion are going to follow the
[48:23] antichrist
[48:25] into destruction unaware, save only the
[48:30] small bride that's taken out before the
[48:32] tribulation, and the small remnant of
[48:35] the woman's seed, the unwise virgin, and
[48:38] a small remnant of elected Jews, only
[48:41] 144,000 of them, and save those three
[48:44] little tiny groups. Other than that, the
[48:47] end and those second two actually have
[48:49] to go into the tribulation and get
[48:51] martyed.
[48:53] So now, how much weight are you willing
[48:57] to put in your heart and mind and take
[49:00] ownership of of how much that God has
[49:03] given you the ability to discern between
[49:06] Christ and Antichrist.
[49:10] Uh the difference is the entire
[49:12] extinction of the human race
[49:15] versus not.
[49:20] Yeah, that's pretty heavy, isn't it?
[49:23] Can you think of anything greater? I
[49:25] just want you to think for a minute, and
[49:27] I'll give you a minute. I'm going to
[49:29] give you a minute, but I'll give you a
[49:30] second or two. Can you think of anything
[49:33] greater
[49:34] of greater importance than given what
[49:37] I've just said? Can you think of
[49:39] anything at all? strain your brain to
[49:43] think of anything
[49:46] given what I've just said to you that
[49:48] we're talking about the difference
[49:50] between the global extinction of the
[49:52] human race
[49:54] and only a sliver escape it and the
[49:56] difference was some were given the
[49:58] discernment by the word to follow Christ
[50:00] and the others rejected it and followed
[50:02] the antichrist
[50:04] and can you think of anything of greater
[50:06] importance than the ability to discern
[50:09] between those two spirits.
[50:17] Get it right, you go in a rapture. Get
[50:20] it wrong, you go into tribulation. You
[50:23] get annihilated. And then you're bound
[50:25] over for a thousand years in hell
[50:27] waiting for your trial.
[50:29] I would say the odds are massive. The
[50:32] stakes
[50:33] are massive.
[50:35] You see, this is exactly how we know. If
[50:38] you think about this, this is really how
[50:41] we know that the word that we've
[50:44] received today is part of the eternal
[50:47] mysteries of God because we still find
[50:50] guidance
[50:52] even in the 21st century
[50:55] of of doctrine that was laid down in the
[50:58] 1960s.
[51:00] Amen.
[51:01] And the do and the world is nothing like
[51:03] it was then. Now it's it's exponentially
[51:05] many many hundreds of times worse. We've
[51:08] gone to unimaginable perversion.
[51:10] Amen.
[51:11] Even when we knew back in the 70s and
[51:12] 80s turn of the century and we knew
[51:14] Sodom was coming. We knew it was all we
[51:16] knew when none of us ever imagined
[51:19] the the kind of woke cancel culture uh
[51:23] that of perversion and filth. And it is
[51:26] so unbelievably filthy. You actually are
[51:30] taught to stay away from it. You don't
[51:32] even have an appreciation. But but I'm
[51:33] here to tell you sometimes in the
[51:35] activities that I have to be involved
[51:36] with, I get around people and hear
[51:38] conversations and I am like I cannot
[51:41] believe the depravity that is standing
[51:44] around me and civilized people.
[51:47] I say thank God for a word that restored
[51:50] a discernment that I could discern
[51:53] between Christ and Antichrist
[51:56] because I can. I won't die.
[51:58] Now what are you going to put above
[52:00] that? Because I have accepted the word I
[52:04] can never die.
[52:07] Hallelujah. What's more valuable pray
[52:10] tell than that.
[52:14] If I stood here till midnight I promise
[52:16] no one in here could think of something
[52:17] more vital.
[52:19] Amen. Amen.
[52:21] See, and I know it's the mysteries of
[52:24] God because a word that was given
[52:29] 50, 60 years ago is still guiding me in
[52:34] unimaginable darkness.
[52:38] Without any revision,
[52:43] God didn't have to send a prophet back.
[52:45] He don't have to send a prophet back to
[52:47] fix anything. God sent us a message and
[52:50] with no revisions. The last update was
[52:53] 1965
[52:55] and every word is viable today to make
[52:58] me an overcomer and have eternal life.
[53:01] Oh, we are to rejoice in the plan of God
[53:04] for this hour. Do you realize who you
[53:06] are and what God has expended for you?
[53:11] Amen.
[53:12] See,
[53:14] and even though it came
[53:17] and finished coming to us in 1965, it's
[53:20] still a Roman candle that has been
[53:21] unfolding.
[53:22] Amen.
[53:23] Amen.
[53:25] Not in a not in a continuation of of the
[53:28] message, but in a continual
[53:30] manifestation.
[53:33] Because you're unfolding every day into
[53:36] the word. You say, "How do you know
[53:39] that?" because the world's going
[53:41] backwards and you're not.
[53:42] Amen.
[53:44] The fact that you're still going
[53:45] forward. You say, "I don't think I'm
[53:46] making a lot of forward progress." That
[53:48] you're not going backwards is more
[53:50] amazing than you realize. And that's why
[53:53] I've said to you so many times, God is
[53:55] doing more in you, for you, to you, and
[53:58] through you than you are even aware of.
[54:02] You are to wake up every day and say,
[54:04] and rejoice. Say, "Lord God, I love you
[54:06] today. You're going to do more than I
[54:08] can even think to ask you to do.
[54:12] It's still imparting eternal life in
[54:16] this message that is decades
[54:20] uh since its last update.
[54:23] It is still imparting
[54:26] eternal lifechanging experience.
[54:31] How many believe it will carry us on to
[54:33] the coming of the Lord? Amen.
[54:36] See, nothing else will,
[54:38] nothing else can.
[54:41] Only his original seed word is capable
[54:45] of that. See, so you know, I I I I want
[54:51] to just drop that on you tonight. I
[54:53] could almost close and go home and I
[54:54] think you you will leave here today with
[54:56] a greater appreciation for what you're
[54:58] involved in,
[55:00] for what God has done for you in this
[55:01] hour. See, so our existence, we find
[55:06] that our very existence is in the word.
[55:10] I mean, that's why we ascend to the
[55:13] throne.
[55:14] Amen.
[55:15] You will ascend to the throne.
[55:17] That's right.
[55:18] Say, I'm not good enough. It ain't got
[55:19] nothing to do with it.
[55:20] You're part of the word. How do I How do
[55:21] you know? Because you've loved his
[55:22] appearing.
[55:25] I I do. Yeah. You You You didn't You
[55:28] didn't just repent of sins. You repented
[55:30] of your whole self.
[55:32] You didn't want to be you anymore at
[55:33] all.
[55:34] You wanted to be him.
[55:36] When when when he came in, I can't
[55:38] imagine somebody seeing Jesus in all of
[55:40] his glory and still wanting to be
[55:42] themselves. But yet, the overwhelming
[55:44] majority, 99.999%
[55:47] of Earth's humanity choose that
[55:50] because so sadly they have rejected the
[55:54] light of their hour. And here you set a
[55:56] little group of nobodies and you've got
[55:58] eternal life. and you're not going in
[56:01] the tribulation
[56:02] and God is moving among us.
[56:05] I want you to have faith that that's the
[56:07] hour and have faith that you're that
[56:09] person and and put the devil in his
[56:11] place.
[56:14] You need to be cognizant of the
[56:16] authority that you wield the the the the
[56:19] energy of the Holy Spirit. It's a sword
[56:22] in your hand and and the devil is
[56:25] terrified that you'll believe that
[56:27] tonight. I'm here to make sure you
[56:29] believe it tonight.
[56:32] We offer him no quarter. We rebuke him.
[56:35] He comes in, we cast him out.
[56:37] We don't ask. It's not a It's not a
[56:39] truce or a treaty or an armist. I don't
[56:42] need any of that stuff with him. I don't
[56:44] have to I don't have to He's in no
[56:46] position to to make a deal. I have all I
[56:50] have all the authority.
[56:52] I don't have to compromise with him
[56:54] because why? I have committed my life to
[56:56] the son of God and the holy spirit rules
[56:58] and reigns in my life.
[57:01] Amen. Do you believe that?
[57:04] See,
[57:05] so our our very existence is in the word
[57:08] and that's why we ascend to the throne
[57:10] because the the word is headed to the
[57:12] throne. It's why brother Brandon would
[57:14] say when he he's standing there and he
[57:16] saw those sainted group of little girls
[57:19] come by marching to the step of the
[57:20] gospel said she was smooth, clean. What
[57:23] a contrast she was to the that had
[57:25] went by before.
[57:27] And the harlot daughters,
[57:28] they were so nasty. A prophet had to
[57:30] turn his head.
[57:32] He couldn't even look at a vision from
[57:33] God. He had to turn his head in shame
[57:35] and embarrassment.
[57:37] That's how bad you you realize God the
[57:40] the age is so nasty. God couldn't even
[57:44] clean up the vision enough that a
[57:46] prophet didn't have to turn his head.
[57:50] Amen.
[57:51] That's that's where we live, friends.
[57:52] Thank God we got a word.
[57:54] Thank God we got the presence of God
[57:56] among us.
[57:57] Amen.
[57:58] Thank God you there was something inside
[58:00] you that loved his appearing.
[58:04] See,
[58:05] and so so we find out that that he said,
[58:09] you know, here she come smooth, clean,
[58:13] marching to the step of the gospel. And
[58:15] brother Bham says these wonderful words,
[58:17] she was the word.
[58:18] Amen.
[58:20] Oh friends, do you realize you're the
[58:23] word of God? Do you realize that's a
[58:25] direct statement from William Brandham?
[58:27] She was the word. What's the result of
[58:30] me being the word? Instead of going
[58:32] down, she started going up. Hallelujah.
[58:35] Say, I don't know if I can. I don't know
[58:37] if I'm going to be able to go up. Don't
[58:38] worry. You're the word. The word is
[58:40] going up.
[58:42] Hallelujah.
[58:43] Amen.
[58:45] So we live between these realities.
[58:49] You know, we identify ourselves with
[58:51] Acts 2. Those devout Jews in Acts two,
[58:53] as we as we started waiting into, and I
[58:56] got to go a little faster.
[58:59] Those devout Jews in Acts two are people
[59:01] who were
[59:03] uh they were more than merely convinced
[59:06] in their minds. They were pricricked in
[59:09] their hearts. See, and when and when
[59:13] they heard the word under divine
[59:16] interpretation,
[59:17] it had nothing to do with their minds.
[59:20] It pricricked their hearts. They
[59:23] realized their mind had misled them.
[59:26] They realized their theology had misled
[59:28] them and it pricricked their heart. What
[59:32] what pricricked their heart? When the
[59:34] word was brought to them with divine
[59:37] interpretation, I'm here to tell you
[59:39] when the when we heard the word made
[59:41] clear under divine interpretation in our
[59:43] day, something took place. Something
[59:46] took place. It was far more than my
[59:48] head. Something something took place
[59:50] that really that we could all look at
[59:52] each other and go, you know, sometimes
[59:55] it's difficult to express in words. you
[59:57] know, at at least uh you know, at at
[1:00:00] least at least it's hard to someone who
[1:00:02] hasn't who hasn't heard that inner voice
[1:00:04] say amen. But when we get around one
[1:00:07] another and and we and and I say, you
[1:00:09] know, there was something inside me that
[1:00:11] just started saying amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:14] Oh, I couldn't resist it. You know what
[1:00:16] we did? We did what they did. We
[1:00:18] followed the command of the word
[1:00:21] when we heard the word delivered under
[1:00:23] divine interpretation. Hattered the same
[1:00:26] way they did under divine
[1:00:28] interpretation.
[1:00:30] I followed the command of the word.
[1:00:34] We repented, friends. And we didn't
[1:00:36] repent just for our past sins. As I said
[1:00:39] a while ago, we repented of our whole
[1:00:41] life,
[1:00:42] including all including all my previous
[1:00:45] misunderstandings about God and what it
[1:00:48] means to be a true Christian. Say,
[1:00:50] define true Christian. Original
[1:00:52] Christian,
[1:00:54] original one, not the 33,000 derivatives
[1:00:58] that that has spanned 2,000 years. It
[1:01:00] this word once it came back to a divine
[1:01:03] interpretation. It's reproducing the
[1:01:05] original Christian. Amen.
[1:01:08] See,
[1:01:09] we took on his name in baptism and from
[1:01:12] there, what did we do? We did just what
[1:01:14] they did. We continue in the doctrine of
[1:01:17] the apostles and prophets.
[1:01:18] Amen.
[1:01:19] See, so it so now that means
[1:01:24] it takes over our lives.
[1:01:27] So it's not just about repenting of your
[1:01:29] past sins.
[1:01:30] It's about following to re all the way
[1:01:33] through regeneration and then and then
[1:01:35] getting on the king's highway and you
[1:01:38] follow the teaching of the apostles and
[1:01:40] prophets and it molds your life and
[1:01:41] molds your life and it molds your life
[1:01:43] and it guides you and keeps you and you
[1:01:45] you know you're going to you're going to
[1:01:46] amen your way all the way into a body
[1:01:48] change.
[1:01:49] Hallelujah.
[1:01:51] Get used to saying it because we're
[1:01:53] going to amen your way all the way to a
[1:01:56] body change.
[1:01:57] Oh, hallelujah. I'm going to have my dad
[1:02:01] pop in my living room one of these
[1:02:02] mornings and he's going to I'm going to
[1:02:03] say, "Dad, you're here." And he's going
[1:02:05] to say, "Yeah, hang on. Yours is coming
[1:02:07] right quick." And I'm going to say,
[1:02:08] "Amen.
[1:02:10] Amen." And the next thing I'm going to
[1:02:12] hear my voice get younger and my
[1:02:14] shoulders get stronger and I'm going to
[1:02:16] start jumping. Amen. Amen. Amen. I
[1:02:19] amened my way home.
[1:02:22] Hallelujah.
[1:02:25] See? Amen.
[1:02:26] So, we identify ourselves
[1:02:29] with 2 Timothy 4. We we hear the love
[1:02:34] letter from the Lord.
[1:02:36] The love letter tells us that we have a
[1:02:38] crown to look forward to. The love
[1:02:42] letter tells us that we have not run in
[1:02:44] vain.
[1:02:46] uh you know, we know who we are and our
[1:02:49] position and we have an inner witness uh
[1:02:52] that that that these things are not just
[1:02:55] true, but they're true of us. When I
[1:02:58] read what Paul is saying about him, I
[1:03:01] know it's just as true about me.
[1:03:04] Hallelujah.
[1:03:06] Oh my. Say, well, you're not St. Paul. I
[1:03:09] was not ever supposed to be St. Paul.
[1:03:11] I'm supposed to be the word. St. Paul's
[1:03:13] my brother because he was part of the
[1:03:15] word also.
[1:03:17] See, so it's never been about a a
[1:03:19] following a man. Following a man might
[1:03:22] get you part of his inheritance when he
[1:03:24] dies. It won't get you eternal life
[1:03:26] because no man can give you that. We're
[1:03:28] not following a man. We're following the
[1:03:30] body word of the son of man. Hallelujah.
[1:03:33] See,
[1:03:35] we have this inner witness because like
[1:03:37] Paul,
[1:03:39] we have loved his appearing in our day.
[1:03:42] Henceforth there is laid up for me a
[1:03:43] crown of righteousness which the Lord
[1:03:45] the righteous judge shall give me at
[1:03:47] that day and not to me only
[1:03:50] but unto all them also that love his
[1:03:54] appearing. Yes.
[1:03:57] So, I I've had the experience of Acts
[1:04:00] two.
[1:04:01] And the experience of Acts two is that I
[1:04:04] caught a revelation of the word of God
[1:04:07] and I said amen to it and I repented of
[1:04:09] all my sins and I took on the name of
[1:04:12] the word in baptism and I can and I
[1:04:14] followed in the teaching of the doctrine
[1:04:16] of the apostles and prophets.
[1:04:18] See, there's no question. Say, is it an
[1:04:21] experience? You better believe it. What
[1:04:22] will it do? It'll change everything
[1:04:24] about you. It won't leave any of you
[1:04:26] left. You're You say, "Well, I I still
[1:04:28] got my body and I still got imagination,
[1:04:31] memory, conscious, reason. I got all
[1:04:32] these senses that are still falling."
[1:04:34] Sure. But I'm here to tell you
[1:04:35] something. The real you is inside of
[1:04:38] those things. And the real you has
[1:04:40] already moved into the realms where God
[1:04:42] lives. I'm already sitting together in
[1:04:45] heavenly places.
[1:04:48] See? And and so so what what is Acts 2
[1:04:55] describing?
[1:04:57] Second Corinthians 4:8.
[1:04:59] Amen.
[1:05:00] They're saying the same thing. The
[1:05:03] people that that that get a that get a
[1:05:07] crown in 2 Corinthians 4:8, they get a
[1:05:10] crown of righteousness and a new body.
[1:05:12] They're the exact same people
[1:05:15] from from 2 Corinthians 4:8. They're the
[1:05:17] exact same people of Acts 2.
[1:05:19] say, "Why did they get the same reward?"
[1:05:21] Because they did the same thing.
[1:05:23] They loved his appearing. They believed
[1:05:25] his word. They followed the teachings.
[1:05:28] They changed their whole life. They
[1:05:29] repented of everything.
[1:05:31] See, it was it didn't just affect their
[1:05:33] head. It pricricked their hearts.
[1:05:37] See?
[1:05:39] You get that?
[1:05:41] So, so we see then that brother Brandon
[1:05:45] would come in this message. This is
[1:05:46] exactly why it was so important to him
[1:05:49] when he comes to
[1:05:51] sers is this the time
[1:05:55] cuz he's looking at all this prophecy
[1:05:56] that's supposed to be and he starts and
[1:05:59] he's now seeing
[1:06:01] wow
[1:06:03] a lot of the stuff that was supposed to
[1:06:04] be at the end time we're here.
[1:06:07] We've got it. There's a lot of these
[1:06:09] mysteries that we already understand.
[1:06:11] Amen.
[1:06:12] And he, you know, he he he goes into Dr.
[1:06:16] Scoffield's notes by admission.
[1:06:19] By admission. It's funny how many people
[1:06:22] actually plagiarize and never tell, give
[1:06:25] any credit to anybody. And the man they
[1:06:27] want to accuse of plagiarism said all
[1:06:29] the time, "I study the works and quote
[1:06:31] other men." He said it constantly. So
[1:06:33] that argument is stupid.
[1:06:35] I'm sorry, little children. Mom may not
[1:06:38] allow that word for you if you forget
[1:06:40] about Jason. They're they're they're
[1:06:42] willfully ignorant.
[1:06:46] It's a ridiculous argument.
[1:06:49] And so so he goes to Scofield
[1:06:52] and he actually starts reading. Scofield
[1:06:55] has a you can read it yourself. You can
[1:06:56] get a SCO if you got a Scoffield study
[1:06:58] Bible, but go to Matthew 13 and you'll
[1:07:00] find uh these listings. And he goes down
[1:07:03] through 11 notable mysteries. And
[1:07:05] brother Brandham just starts reading
[1:07:06] them. The mystery of the kingdom of
[1:07:07] heaven. Matthew 13 3-50. Number two, the
[1:07:10] mystery of Israel blindness during this
[1:07:12] age. Romans 11:25, the mystery of the
[1:07:14] translation of the living saints at the
[1:07:16] end of this age. 1 Corinthians 15, 1
[1:07:17] Thessalonians 4. Now, gladly, I I I'm
[1:07:21] happy to raise up my hand and go, "Yeah,
[1:07:22] but once the seals were open, a prophet
[1:07:24] understood 1 Thessalonians 4 like
[1:07:27] Scoffield never understood a shout and a
[1:07:30] voice of trumpet." They never they never
[1:07:32] caught that. The rapture is a cycle
[1:07:36] of three events. And it's Christ doing
[1:07:38] all three while he's descending.
[1:07:40] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[1:07:42] He's only got so far to descend. And
[1:07:44] he's been descending. Your homegoing is
[1:07:46] soon.
[1:07:49] Hallelujah.
[1:07:49] Hallelujah.
[1:07:51] Amen.
[1:07:52] The mystery. Number four, the mystery of
[1:07:53] New Testament church as one body
[1:07:55] composed of Jews and Gentiles. Ephesians
[1:07:57] 3, Romans 16, uh, Colossians 4. The
[1:07:59] mystery of the church as the bride of
[1:08:01] Christ. Ephesians 5, the mystery of of
[1:08:03] the of the in living of Christ living in
[1:08:07] inside us. Galatians 2 and 1 uh
[1:08:09] Colossians 1, the mystery of God, even
[1:08:13] Christ, that is that Christ as the
[1:08:16] incarnate fullness of the Godhead
[1:08:17] embodied in whom all the divine wisdom
[1:08:20] and man subsist. Now, they still see him
[1:08:23] as as three persons,
[1:08:26] but at least they do understand at least
[1:08:28] the uh they're on their way to an
[1:08:30] understanding. if they can just accept
[1:08:32] divine interpretation.
[1:08:34] Ver number eight, the mystery of the
[1:08:36] process by which godlikeness is restored
[1:08:38] to man. 1 Timothy 3, the mystery of
[1:08:40] iniquity. You remember the mystery of
[1:08:42] iniquity. 2 Thessalonians 2, the mystery
[1:08:44] of the seven stars. Revelation 1:20.
[1:08:47] Amen.
[1:08:47] See the mystery of Babylon in Revelation
[1:08:50] 17. So these great men with in under
[1:08:53] that man age, they were anointed with
[1:08:56] brilliance. They their their minds were
[1:08:58] anointed. They're they're amazing
[1:09:01] to go through the Bible. I I read from
[1:09:03] their commentary constantly because now
[1:09:05] I've I've got the I've got the the the
[1:09:08] hyper version that I can take a lot of
[1:09:10] their hard work, plug it into the
[1:09:12] message and amplify it to a whole new
[1:09:14] level.
[1:09:15] You see,
[1:09:16] and so so the the mystery of Babylon. So
[1:09:20] so we see, you know, the the major
[1:09:22] corrections and and brother Brandham
[1:09:25] comes down. He says, "Now, that's some
[1:09:27] of the mysteries that this angel of
[1:09:31] Revelation 10:7, this angel is supposed
[1:09:33] to wind up all the mystery, all the
[1:09:37] mysteries of God." And so, and so now,
[1:09:41] Brother Brandham is looking at
[1:09:43] Scofield's list and he's saying,
[1:09:45] "Goodness, y'all, we we understand all
[1:09:48] of these things even better than Dr. SC
[1:09:51] Dr. Scoffield,
[1:09:53] right? because now we we we we we we've
[1:09:56] got, you know, the major corrections to
[1:09:59] the Godhead, you know. And brother
[1:10:00] Brandham, he goes on now, he says here,
[1:10:02] and he says, "And and the other and may
[1:10:05] I say this with reverence
[1:10:08] and not referring to myself, but
[1:10:11] referring to the angel of God." He's
[1:10:13] going to need an angel of God because
[1:10:15] he's not a scholar. Scofield was a
[1:10:17] scholar and didn't have half the
[1:10:20] understanding that a Kuckian's going to
[1:10:22] get from an angel. See,
[1:10:24] and he says that's some of the mysteries
[1:10:27] that this angel, so when he saw that, he
[1:10:28] thought, "Wow, we must really be at the
[1:10:30] end time." But he says to his audience,
[1:10:32] now he says that this angel is supposed
[1:10:35] to bring those things. And the other,
[1:10:37] and may I say this with reverence, not
[1:10:39] referring to myself, but referring to
[1:10:41] the angel. There's other things that we
[1:10:43] have went further than they did like the
[1:10:47] true mystery of the Godhead, the true
[1:10:49] mystery of water baptism, the true
[1:10:52] mystery of the original sin and what
[1:10:54] happened. And brother Brandham goes on,
[1:10:56] the serpent seed that's been hidden, a
[1:10:58] hidden mystery all through the years,
[1:11:00] the grace straightened out, not
[1:11:03] disgrace, but real true grace. Because
[1:11:06] you have the argument between the
[1:11:07] Calvinists and the Armenians. And and
[1:11:09] brother Brandham says, "When the church
[1:11:11] gets too loose, then I'm an Armenian.
[1:11:13] But when they get, you know, I if if if
[1:11:16] but when they get too legalist, then I'm
[1:11:18] a Calvinist." Neither one of them were
[1:11:20] correct, but they had some part of them
[1:11:23] that was correct. And a prophet stood in
[1:11:24] the middle and was able to to discern
[1:11:27] between right and wrong and say, "It's
[1:11:29] not disgrace, but there is a real grace.
[1:11:33] There is a real blood that atones for
[1:11:36] you. And God cannot see your mistakes
[1:11:38] and your sins and your failures.
[1:11:41] And you stand before God completely
[1:11:43] innocent as though you never done it in
[1:11:45] the first place.
[1:11:47] Say, "That gives me a license to sin."
[1:11:48] It actually does just the opposite. It
[1:11:51] liberates you and frees you to believe
[1:11:53] every word of God. And then a
[1:11:55] supernatural God is able to change your
[1:11:57] very nature
[1:11:59] and begin to build the principles of the
[1:12:01] word of God in your life. And you amen
[1:12:03] your way all the way every day.
[1:12:05] Amen.
[1:12:08] See
[1:12:10] the grace straightened out.
[1:12:13] No such a thing as eternal burning hell.
[1:12:15] You'll burn for millions of years
[1:12:16] perhaps, but anything that was eternal
[1:12:19] had never a beginning or end and hell
[1:12:22] was created. He goes on, the mystery of
[1:12:25] water baptism, the pillar of fire. I
[1:12:27] love that one.
[1:12:28] Amen.
[1:12:29] The pillar of fire returning back.
[1:12:32] That's the thing that's supposed to take
[1:12:34] place and we see it.
[1:12:36] That's why prophet is in this message.
[1:12:38] Is this the sign of the end sers?
[1:12:41] We see everything on Scoffield's list.
[1:12:43] Plus, listen to all this other stuff.
[1:12:45] Listen to all this other stuff we see.
[1:12:47] And now, as if that's not enough, now
[1:12:50] we've got the return of the pillar of
[1:12:51] fire. Is this the sign of the end? Are
[1:12:54] we really there? And he he says and the
[1:12:58] here's another one. The sounding of a
[1:12:59] trumpet in the Bible how that it means
[1:13:02] get ready for scripture or war. And he
[1:13:04] he he says this now watch
[1:13:07] somebody has to you know here he's going
[1:13:10] to talk about the ages. So he says
[1:13:14] now and if you're going to reject a
[1:13:16] prophet
[1:13:18] then here I'm going to read where you're
[1:13:20] going to have to live. Okay? Somebody is
[1:13:23] going to come forth with a chart and
[1:13:26] draw it all out.
[1:13:28] Good. Excellent. And somebody is going
[1:13:31] to come forth with another thing and
[1:13:33] draw it all out contrary to the other
[1:13:35] guy.
[1:13:37] So, who you going to believe? Scoffield
[1:13:39] or Larkin.
[1:13:42] Maybe they're both wrong. Maybe Pink was
[1:13:43] right.
[1:13:45] Maybe he was wrong. Maybe they were all
[1:13:46] three wrong. Maybe maybe this one was
[1:13:48] right. Well, maybe that one was right.
[1:13:51] You see? And they all had a right. They
[1:13:53] all had some right.
[1:13:55] You understand? Calvin had some right.
[1:13:57] Even though even though you know they
[1:13:59] they they said to brother Brandon one
[1:14:01] time said you know Calvin he was a
[1:14:02] murderer. And he said well he said look
[1:14:04] Calvin was a murderer. He said the
[1:14:06] problem with Calvin is he needed
[1:14:07] converting himself.
[1:14:10] Wasn't even born again. He's preaching
[1:14:12] the gospel. See and brother isn't
[1:14:14] judging his eternal destination. Maybe
[1:14:16] he ended up getting it. Prophetus said,
[1:14:18] you know, when he murdered that guy, he
[1:14:19] needed the he needed a conversion
[1:14:21] himself. See, and so, so, so we find
[1:14:24] that, so he says, you know, but God, but
[1:14:26] watch this now. Oh, no, no. I don't want
[1:14:29] to, I don't want to be, let's make a
[1:14:30] deal. I don't want curtain number one,
[1:14:32] curtain number two, curtain number
[1:14:33] three. This is my eternal life. Are you
[1:14:35] kidding? I can't play a game show with
[1:14:37] my eternal life.
[1:14:39] And brother Brandham says, "But God
[1:14:42] comes in the power of his resurrection."
[1:14:45] And who's going to speak against it?
[1:14:48] They might speak whatever they want, but
[1:14:49] it's not it's not it's invalid because
[1:14:52] God has proven by the presence of the
[1:14:55] pillar of fire what the word that will
[1:14:58] bring you eternal life has h has come
[1:15:00] upon us in this day.
[1:15:03] And there's no question. It's Jesus
[1:15:06] Christ. The same yesterday, today, and
[1:15:10] forever. He does the same thing that he
[1:15:13] did yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:15:17] See,
[1:15:19] bringing forth a a different ministry
[1:15:24] from all of those chart drawers.
[1:15:26] Yes. Amen. He brought forth a different
[1:15:29] ministry that didn't just keep taking
[1:15:32] people forward in argumentative
[1:15:35] understanding.
[1:15:37] He brought a word that took us back
[1:15:40] to the original.
[1:15:43] He didn't even try to scrap it and let's
[1:15:45] build it back. He wasn't interested in
[1:15:47] reforming the church. He wasn't a
[1:15:49] reformer. The church was dead. It had
[1:15:52] kicked Christ out. And Elijah was sent
[1:15:54] not to reform the church, but to call
[1:15:57] you out of it.
[1:15:59] See, because once the life came through
[1:16:02] the stalk and into the tassel, it was
[1:16:04] never going to go back in the in the
[1:16:05] stalk again. Stalk died. Once it went
[1:16:07] out through the into the ear, went
[1:16:09] through the shock and came out to the
[1:16:11] grain, it was never going to go back
[1:16:12] through those cycles again. It was going
[1:16:14] on to harvest.
[1:16:16] See? And so he so so we we see th this
[1:16:22] ability to bring a a global brag from
[1:16:25] every nation uh back to the original
[1:16:28] life. We see the sea gene of God.
[1:16:30] Amen.
[1:16:31] I is this the sign of the insers? You
[1:16:33] know what my answer is? Yes.
[1:16:36] That that became clear when brother
[1:16:38] Brandham is preaching. Is this the sign
[1:16:42] of the insers? The seals prove the
[1:16:44] answer. Yes. This is the sign of the
[1:16:48] end, the time of the delay. When he put
[1:16:52] one foot on the land and one on the sea
[1:16:54] and raised his hand and swore, "The
[1:16:56] delay is over. I won't hold back
[1:16:59] anymore. I'm going to break the seals.
[1:17:01] I'm going to reveal the mighty God."
[1:17:05] See,
[1:17:06] time that those ages shall be no more.
[1:17:11] See, we see a C gene of God. This
[1:17:13] adjusted our understanding of
[1:17:15] predestination and election cuz we
[1:17:17] realized it was all it wasn't based on
[1:17:19] being fortunate or or unfortunate. It
[1:17:22] was based on origin.
[1:17:23] Amen.
[1:17:24] Once we understood cene then we
[1:17:27] understood it's all origin. See
[1:17:31] it's not a it's not a choosing like like
[1:17:34] you would you either got picked for the
[1:17:36] team or you didn't. Wasn't that
[1:17:39] it's it's origin.
[1:17:42] I come from God.
[1:17:44] So naturally, I'm going to recognize
[1:17:45] God. And naturally, I'm going to go back
[1:17:47] to God.
[1:17:49] You see, and listen friends, there's
[1:17:52] nothing that can stop or prevent that.
[1:17:57] You can't do it. The devil, there's not
[1:17:59] enough devils in hell.
[1:18:01] And hell is even enlarged itself.
[1:18:03] There's not enough of them. If they all
[1:18:06] teamed up on you and left all the rest
[1:18:07] of us alone and all of them teamed up on
[1:18:10] you, they could not stop God's election,
[1:18:13] which means they cannot stop your
[1:18:15] predestination.
[1:18:18] Hallelujah.
[1:18:19] Amen.
[1:18:19] See, so the Bible is one great book
[1:18:23] about Jesus Christ and his plan for
[1:18:25] redemption. And we realize by the
[1:18:27] unveiling of God that we are part of
[1:18:29] that,
[1:18:30] that we're actually a part of God's
[1:18:32] Godhead.
[1:18:34] We learn about
[1:18:36] the foolish virgin. We learn all these
[1:18:38] things that we didn't before know.
[1:18:40] There's a lot of things we didn't know.
[1:18:43] We didn't know it was a seed gene.
[1:18:46] We thought as brother Brandham explained
[1:18:48] it many times. God just by his
[1:18:50] fornowledge. You know why brother
[1:18:52] Brandham taught it that way? Because he
[1:18:54] hadn't had he hadn't progressed yet to
[1:18:56] understand it's a gene of God. He
[1:18:57] doesn't even use that kind of language
[1:18:58] until the last four sermons of his life.
[1:19:02] We found out that wow, we thought the
[1:19:06] only way to get into heaven is to be
[1:19:09] born again. Now, that's true. But what
[1:19:12] we found out is to our shock and
[1:19:15] happiness is that the unwise virgin are
[1:19:19] not born again, but they in are granted
[1:19:21] eternal life.
[1:19:23] And we never knew that. Like, wow, go
[1:19:25] figure. They they that you say, "How in
[1:19:28] the world?" because they were righteous
[1:19:30] people and they and they under and they
[1:19:33] believed God for everything they knew.
[1:19:35] Remember that you can't disbelieve what
[1:19:37] you don't know. And there and if they're
[1:19:38] not ordained, if they're not part of
[1:19:40] that origin tree of the election of to
[1:19:42] be in the bride, there's no way. Brother
[1:19:44] Brandham says it's not him that will him
[1:19:46] that runth. It's God that showeth mercy.
[1:19:48] He said, "If my name was there, I'm sure
[1:19:50] to be there. If it wasn't, I won't be."
[1:19:51] That's all. William Brandham.
[1:19:53] You understand, friends, that do you
[1:19:55] understand that? That the fact that you
[1:19:58] can sit here tonight and love his
[1:20:00] appearing. I'm not talking about
[1:20:01] understand all the doctrine, but you
[1:20:03] love his holiness. You love his life.
[1:20:05] You love his presence. You love his
[1:20:07] righteousness. You love his word. That
[1:20:09] that you are to be the happiest people
[1:20:13] in all the world to know that. Say, "But
[1:20:15] I make mistakes." They don't count.
[1:20:19] But I got failures. They don't count.
[1:20:22] There is thou now therefore no
[1:20:25] condemnation to them which are in the
[1:20:28] election.
[1:20:30] See,
[1:20:31] so we gained we learned this about the
[1:20:34] sea gene. We learned this about the
[1:20:36] foolish virgin.
[1:20:39] We gained a greater understanding
[1:20:42] between the fundamentalist
[1:20:45] and and the auza revivalist.
[1:20:49] We understand the difference. I think
[1:20:51] that it was brilliant of God to for
[1:20:55] William Brandham to cut his teeth on
[1:20:57] fundamentalism. Amen.
[1:20:59] He was ordained in the Baptist church.
[1:21:01] He's fundamentalist. And then he
[1:21:03] contacted this revivalist. We call them
[1:21:06] Pentecostals. It's a little bit of a
[1:21:07] misnomer, but we'll just use it because
[1:21:08] brother Brandham used it. So he meets
[1:21:11] the Pentecostal
[1:21:13] denominational movement. By that time,
[1:21:14] they're he's a he's I'm one born out of
[1:21:16] season means he's late to the party.
[1:21:18] Time he gets there, they're already
[1:21:19] fractured. They did just what the Welsh
[1:21:22] revival did in 1904. Two years later, it
[1:21:25] started fracturing and breaking apart.
[1:21:27] and it became denominations. It jumped
[1:21:29] the channel. It jump it jumped the the
[1:21:31] pond and landed in Isuza on Isuza Street
[1:21:33] in California and started a revival. And
[1:21:35] it it didn't even take two years and it
[1:21:37] was already denominating and fracturing.
[1:21:39] Amen.
[1:21:40] And brother Brown said, "By goodness, by
[1:21:41] the time I got I was just a young
[1:21:43] preacher. By the time I come down, he
[1:21:45] said and said in that first meeting, he
[1:21:47] said, I found they were just as broke up
[1:21:49] as we Baptist were."
[1:21:52] See, but he could also see they had some
[1:21:55] the Baptist didn't have. But then he
[1:21:57] would I I so appreciate brother
[1:21:59] Brandham's perspective because he he
[1:22:01] lived in both of those worlds. And he
[1:22:04] said, you know, he said, "If I could
[1:22:05] just ever," he said, "It's like a man,
[1:22:07] the fundamentalist is like a like a you
[1:22:09] know, he's got he's he he knows
[1:22:12] everything, but he don't have any funds
[1:22:13] in his account. He knows how to write a
[1:22:15] check, but he's broke.
[1:22:17] But the Pentecostal, he's got a bank
[1:22:19] account full. He don't know how to write
[1:22:20] a check. And he says, "If I could ever
[1:22:22] get them two guys together, we could
[1:22:24] have something here." See? And and so so
[1:22:26] so we learned about a gene of God. We we
[1:22:30] we learned about a foolish virgin who
[1:22:34] receive eternal life. We learn, we gain
[1:22:36] further understanding of the balance
[1:22:38] between the fundamentalist and the Isuza
[1:22:41] revivalist regarding the new birth, the
[1:22:43] the true original experience of
[1:22:47] Pentecost during the time of the first
[1:22:50] believers in Jerusalem. That's what
[1:22:52] we've been taken back to. We understand
[1:22:55] what really happened.
[1:22:59] They receive. Say, why did why did those
[1:23:02] apostles have this dynamic experience?
[1:23:06] Because they believed the word.
[1:23:08] Amen.
[1:23:09] They believed the word that entitled
[1:23:10] them to the Holy Ghost. Peter says to
[1:23:13] them, if you'll believe the word too and
[1:23:14] repent of all your sins, repent of all
[1:23:16] your unbelief, then you too can have it.
[1:23:19] And not only you, but your children and
[1:23:21] everybody, whoever can come by a divine
[1:23:24] revelation and catch a revelation of
[1:23:26] Jesus Christ personally. To them the
[1:23:28] Holy Ghost is given that that that
[1:23:30] brings a new birth.
[1:23:32] The revelation what is it? What is a new
[1:23:34] birth? Brother Brandham said it's
[1:23:35] nothing in the world but that gene that
[1:23:37] seed coming to life.
[1:23:39] Amen.
[1:23:40] See
[1:23:41] I got a quote here for that. He says so
[1:23:43] he so he says here
[1:23:46] so we we see that this it's a seed
[1:23:48] coming to life. He said oh here it is
[1:23:51] sign of the is the sign of the insert.
[1:23:53] the mystery, the mystery of the baptism
[1:23:55] of the Holy Ghost without sensation, but
[1:23:58] the person of Christ forming in you the
[1:24:00] same works that he did. Do you realize
[1:24:02] that second part of that shows? And I
[1:24:05] don't know why people sometimes get
[1:24:09] stuck on that. That's he's only speaking
[1:24:11] about an initial new birth. And there is
[1:24:14] an initial experience. You have to be
[1:24:16] born again.
[1:24:17] Yes. Amen.
[1:24:18] You better believe it. You can't bypass
[1:24:19] that. You're a gene of God, but you got
[1:24:21] to be born again. See, that seed's got
[1:24:23] to come to life. And and so and it will.
[1:24:26] Brother Brandham said, if if the light
[1:24:28] ever flashes over that seed, it'll come
[1:24:29] to life as sure as anything. You can't
[1:24:31] keep it down. See?
[1:24:33] So, so it's not him that willth or him
[1:24:35] that runth. It's not you chasing it.
[1:24:37] It's God showing mercy
[1:24:40] and you realize you're a part of the
[1:24:41] word. Oh my. But I don't know why they
[1:24:45] limit it to to an initial experience.
[1:24:47] The baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now, this
[1:24:48] ain't Scofield. This is brother Brandham
[1:24:51] saying this is what we've understood
[1:24:52] further than Scoffield by that angel.
[1:24:55] And I don't know why they limited the
[1:24:57] Holy Ghost without sensation. That that
[1:25:00] the whole argument is a ridiculous
[1:25:01] argument. They're arguing over nothing.
[1:25:04] They're arguing over what's the what's
[1:25:06] the initial evidence? Well, it's not a
[1:25:07] sensation. Well, but you're going to
[1:25:08] have a s and the whole goes back and
[1:25:10] forth. It's it's not even I don't know
[1:25:12] why they limit it. The the quote doesn't
[1:25:14] limit it. The quote shows that it's the
[1:25:17] person of Christ performing in you the
[1:25:19] same works he did. So what it's showing
[1:25:21] it's more than an initial moment of a
[1:25:23] new birth. It's a gene coming to life
[1:25:26] and it's a whole lifetime
[1:25:29] of you moving forward by faith not by
[1:25:32] sensation.
[1:25:34] Because when you fail, you have a
[1:25:36] sensation. I failed. You're depressed.
[1:25:38] Your faith, but you don't go by
[1:25:40] sensation. And the Holy Ghost doesn't
[1:25:43] depend on your sensations.
[1:25:45] Say, "Oh, I feel on top of the world."
[1:25:47] It don't do it. Don't depend on that
[1:25:48] either. It It depends on are you
[1:25:51] believing the word of God? Is your whole
[1:25:53] heart and your whole mind saying,
[1:25:54] "Amen." Amen. Amen.
[1:25:58] See,
[1:26:00] so he says, "Who is this? Melzdc."
[1:26:03] And then here's what happens when you're
[1:26:05] born again. Then when you become subject
[1:26:09] to that spirit,
[1:26:11] it throws your whole being subject to
[1:26:14] that spirit.
[1:26:15] And that spirit, Holy Ghost, that spirit
[1:26:20] is nothing in the world but this seed
[1:26:23] word made manifest or quickened.
[1:26:25] Hallelujah. Made alive. And when the
[1:26:28] Bible said don't do this, that body
[1:26:30] quickly turns to it. There is no
[1:26:32] question. Your whole nature is changed.
[1:26:35] There's no more desire of the world.
[1:26:38] See, say, "Will I stumble?" You might,
[1:26:40] but you'll repent. You know why? Because
[1:26:41] you can't live that way anymore.
[1:26:44] And what is it? What is it? You say,
[1:26:46] "Are you sure he's talking about the
[1:26:49] Holy Ghost?" Here's his next line. And
[1:26:51] what is it? Now, remember the it is the
[1:26:56] seed word made manifest, quickened.
[1:26:59] All right. What is it? It's the earnest
[1:27:02] of the resurrection.
[1:27:04] This body will be raised up again
[1:27:06] because it's already started.
[1:27:10] Wow.
[1:27:12] Say, can you miss the rapture?
[1:27:14] Impossible.
[1:27:16] I'm already on my way.
[1:27:18] I've already passed from death to life.
[1:27:21] So, it's more than than just a a silly
[1:27:23] argument over some initial moment of the
[1:27:26] new birth. The new birth comes by saying
[1:27:28] amen to every word. Not your head, your
[1:27:31] heart. See, it's all the minds I It's
[1:27:35] all the mind battles you face every day
[1:27:38] and Satan condemns us because we stumble
[1:27:41] and you struggle. As I've been preaching
[1:27:42] from Sunday, I I read to you how many uh
[1:27:45] men of God have their ups and downs. We
[1:27:47] we went to Paul. We went we went
[1:27:50] backwards to Elijah. We went on back to
[1:27:52] David. We went on back to Moses. And
[1:27:54] brother Brandham said, "Every last one
[1:27:55] of them, and even Moses committed the
[1:27:57] worst sin that any man of God has ever
[1:27:59] committed.
[1:28:01] said that one time it threw out and
[1:28:03] broke the whole plan of God. Nobody had
[1:28:06] ever done that.
[1:28:08] See,
[1:28:09] and so we find out that we struggle with
[1:28:11] our ups and downs in our daily walk. But
[1:28:13] you know what? You keep chasing
[1:28:15] something, you know, and and and and
[1:28:18] here here's the here's the sad part.
[1:28:20] people who have loved his appearing and
[1:28:24] have walked with God and love it and
[1:28:26] they know they love it and their whole
[1:28:27] nature has changed and they make a
[1:28:29] stumble and the devil tells them, "Oh,
[1:28:31] you're done and now you're all defeated.
[1:28:33] You're you're chasing sensations.
[1:28:37] It's not even about that. It's not has
[1:28:39] it's the Holy Ghost without regard." Can
[1:28:42] I say it that way? It's the Holy Ghost
[1:28:44] new birth without regard to how I feel
[1:28:47] or what you think. It's my love for the
[1:28:49] almighty word of God
[1:28:53] and it goes my entire life. That's why
[1:28:55] brother Brandham in the second half of
[1:28:56] it describes a life going forward, not
[1:28:59] just an initial event.
[1:29:01] See the arguments in the wrong place.
[1:29:03] That's why they argue over it.
[1:29:05] See, and we struggle and then you know
[1:29:08] you you then Satan gets you down and
[1:29:10] then you know what you do? You start
[1:29:12] chasing something you already got. Amen.
[1:29:16] And the next thing you know, you're not
[1:29:17] sure and you're back to the altar again.
[1:29:18] Do I got the Holy Ghost? Am I really
[1:29:20] Christian? Where's your heart? Listen,
[1:29:22] listen to what Listen to what brother
[1:29:23] Brandham, he he he he's going to come
[1:29:25] down to here. It's a beautiful quote. He
[1:29:27] says the in the masterpiece, he says on
[1:29:30] the interview a few moments ago, I was
[1:29:33] speaking to a person in the room that's
[1:29:35] present now. Now, this was Sister
[1:29:37] Georgie Bruce. He tells about it in
[1:29:39] another place.
[1:29:40] Yeah. a godly sister, full of the spirit
[1:29:43] of God, had been a Christian for many
[1:29:45] years. She's sitting in brother
[1:29:46] Brandham's office before he goes out to
[1:29:48] preach. She says, "But Brother Brandham,
[1:29:50] I'm not sure if I'm born again." See, he
[1:29:53] says, "On the interview a few moments
[1:29:54] ago, I was speaking to a person in the
[1:29:56] room that's present now said, "But
[1:29:57] brother Brandham," now here, Brother
[1:30:00] Brandham is a prophet trying to tell her
[1:30:03] what I'm telling you.
[1:30:04] See, look at look at your attitude
[1:30:06] toward the word. Look at your whole
[1:30:07] heart. Look at your life. Look what's
[1:30:08] changed here. Here's her rebuttal.
[1:30:12] Let me say it to you tonight. Don't
[1:30:13] rebut the prophet.
[1:30:15] But, Brother Brandham,
[1:30:17] I have so many things, so many things
[1:30:22] that I know that's wrong. And he says,
[1:30:25] "And a godly little woman." I said, "But
[1:30:29] look, sister, everybody listening?
[1:30:31] You listening? Here's Elijah. This is
[1:30:34] July 1964 in a sermon called the
[1:30:37] masterpiece."
[1:30:39] You know what made him a masterpiece? A
[1:30:41] piece flew off.
[1:30:42] And he's the masterpiece.
[1:30:45] He wouldn't have been a masterpiece if
[1:30:46] there wasn't another piece. He's the
[1:30:48] masterpiece.
[1:30:50] And you're you're you came from him.
[1:30:54] And I said, "But look, sister,
[1:30:57] you don't look at yourself."
[1:31:00] Hallelujah.
[1:31:01] It's the Holy Ghost without sensation.
[1:31:03] Amen.
[1:31:04] Stop stop letting your emotions dictate
[1:31:07] to you whether or not you have been born
[1:31:10] again. Say, "Well, how do I know when
[1:31:12] from your heart you can say amen to
[1:31:14] every word of God?" And that means so be
[1:31:17] it unto me my whole life. I want the
[1:31:20] word. I want everything. I want I want
[1:31:22] more of him, less of me, more of him,
[1:31:23] less of me until it's all of him and
[1:31:25] none of me.
[1:31:27] You'll have that on resurrection
[1:31:29] morning. But my advice is to you, pursue
[1:31:31] it. Now you want to press, press. Now
[1:31:33] you want to stretch stretch for that.
[1:31:36] Hallelujah.
[1:31:37] See that's why brother Brandham that I
[1:31:39] mean I mean if you think about it
[1:31:40] friends brother Brandham says see you
[1:31:42] don't look at yourself because that
[1:31:45] that's why brother Brandon would say
[1:31:47] away with experience as your measuring
[1:31:49] line.
[1:31:50] He says that in the church ages away
[1:31:52] with experience. We have gone by
[1:31:54] experience and not the word. Away with
[1:31:57] experience as your measuring line. There
[1:32:00] is only one plum line, only one rod, and
[1:32:02] that is the word of God. So away with
[1:32:05] experience. I don't care whether it's
[1:32:07] ups and downs, good or bad, happy or
[1:32:10] sad. It's not about sensations or
[1:32:13] experiences. It's about my faith and my
[1:32:17] acceptance and my whole heart in love
[1:32:20] with this his appearing in this hour.
[1:32:22] That's how I know that our crown is
[1:32:25] awaiting me like it's awaiting Paul
[1:32:28] because I like Paul have loved his
[1:32:31] appearing.
[1:32:34] Amen.
[1:32:35] See, Paul didn't say because I shook.
[1:32:39] Paul didn't say because I had some
[1:32:41] sensation or experience. He said, "I've
[1:32:42] loved his appearing." There's a crown
[1:32:45] for I have loved his appearing.
[1:32:47] Thank you, Lord. See?
[1:32:50] And I said, "But sister, look sister,
[1:32:54] you don't look at yourself.
[1:32:56] It's just what your desire is and what
[1:33:00] you try to do. And if you really love
[1:33:04] the Lord now, if you really love him and
[1:33:07] it's not just lip service and you're not
[1:33:09] just a church member warming up, but if
[1:33:13] you but if you and if you really love
[1:33:16] the Lord, you try to serve him with all
[1:33:21] your heart and then
[1:33:25] and then should I do a cliffhanger and
[1:33:27] make you wait till Sunday? No, you'll go
[1:33:29] home and read it. And then
[1:33:32] all your mistakes is hid in the blood of
[1:33:37] the Lord Jesus.
[1:33:39] See, see, he made a way.
[1:33:45] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:33:47] Oh, where do you live, friends? I live
[1:33:49] between Acts 2 and 2 Corinthians 4. I
[1:33:52] have repented of my sins. I've been
[1:33:54] baptized in his name. I've loved his
[1:33:56] appearing. I've received the word for my
[1:33:59] hour. My whole heart and life are
[1:34:01] changed and I'm trying to serve him and
[1:34:03] I'm striving and I'm not going to worry
[1:34:05] about how I feel. It's not about
[1:34:07] sensations. I'm not going to trust
[1:34:09] experiences. I'm going to trust my heart
[1:34:12] that I know that I know that I know I
[1:34:14] love every word and even in my ups and
[1:34:17] downs, I come back to it again and again
[1:34:20] and again because I can't get away from
[1:34:22] it. I don't want any other life.
[1:34:26] I only want his life. H I have loved his
[1:34:30] appearing. How many love his appearing?
[1:34:33] How many want only his life?
[1:34:37] Let's stand, friends. Oh, I've loved his
[1:34:40] appearing. I don't want see when you
[1:34:42] really love him the right way. Say, "Oh,
[1:34:44] yeah. I love him." And if you really
[1:34:46] love him, if you really love the Lord,
[1:34:50] now let me say
[1:34:53] if you really
[1:34:56] really love the Lord,
[1:35:02] then you love the commandments of his
[1:35:06] word
[1:35:07] because he is his word. And if you
[1:35:11] really love the Lord, you might stumble,
[1:35:15] but your heart wants all of God's
[1:35:19] righteousness. And you don't care what
[1:35:21] the word tells you to get rid of. You
[1:35:23] don't care what comes across the pull
[1:35:24] pit that tells you to clean up and get
[1:35:26] rid of it and sanctify your life and
[1:35:28] dedicate your heart. You love the Lord
[1:35:30] and you love the word no matter what the
[1:35:32] word says. That is saying amen to every
[1:35:37] word. Amen.
[1:35:38] Saying amen to every word is not a head
[1:35:40] thing.
[1:35:41] Saying amen to every word is a desire to
[1:35:43] say Lord so be it. Brother Bram said
[1:35:45] amen means so be it. You're saying so be
[1:35:49] it unto me everything in your word. No
[1:35:52] matter what it is, no matter what it
[1:35:54] caused me to separate from. Amen. No
[1:35:57] matter what it caused me to to to
[1:35:58] change. Amen. No matter what it c tells
[1:36:01] me that that I got to do this instead of
[1:36:03] that. Then I'll do this. I'll say amen
[1:36:06] to till to your whole life. you. What
[1:36:07] you find, friends, is as you start
[1:36:09] growing spiritually, you find that
[1:36:11] amen's come a lot easier. And no matter
[1:36:13] what the Lord says to you, it means so
[1:36:16] little and he means so much. The other
[1:36:18] the world might look at that and go,
[1:36:20] "Are you crazy? You're going to throw
[1:36:21] away. You're going to throw that away."
[1:36:23] And you you got your whole career and
[1:36:24] your life and everything's invested.
[1:36:25] That means nothing. Like brother
[1:36:27] Brandham said, when you get this kind of
[1:36:28] revelation, this world, this life means
[1:36:31] very little. Only only No, I'm not being
[1:36:34] killed. I'm okay. This life means this
[1:36:38] life that we live means very little.
[1:36:43] The only thing that counts is home.
[1:36:47] Sister Debbie and I were talking about
[1:36:49] that sitting out. I stepped out of my
[1:36:53] office. Wonderful thing to get a text
[1:36:55] from your wife. Sitting in there
[1:36:56] studying all day. Get a text from the
[1:36:58] woman I love. Says, "Hey, beautiful day.
[1:37:01] You want to sit on the porch on the
[1:37:02] swing?"
[1:37:04] That's a no-brainer.
[1:37:06] beautiful woman, invite me to sit on a
[1:37:07] swing. Are you kidding? Yes. And we sit
[1:37:10] out there and we just start talking
[1:37:11] about the Lord. And I said, you know,
[1:37:13] sweetheart,
[1:37:15] you know, we are when brother Brandon
[1:37:17] made that statement
[1:37:19] that this life means very little. And he
[1:37:23] said, you know, he said, and the older
[1:37:25] you get, the the more that becomes real.
[1:37:28] And I said, you know, we're already two
[1:37:30] years older than he was when he said
[1:37:32] that. Yeah,
[1:37:34] he passed away at 57 years old. We're
[1:37:37] already more than two years older than
[1:37:39] he was when he said it. And in a world
[1:37:41] much worse,
[1:37:43] I'm here to tell you, the older I get,
[1:37:46] the more that world means, the less this
[1:37:49] world means. Is that is that is that
[1:37:51] your heart tonight, friends? Wow. I hate
[1:37:54] to keep bringing these kind of weighted
[1:37:56] sermons on a Wednesday night. It just
[1:37:58] comes to me and I got to preach it. I've
[1:38:00] been hogging it so much like crazy, but
[1:38:03] I'm having a good time. You love the
[1:38:06] word.

[1:40:42] Brother Luther has a very special
[1:40:44] unspoken request
[1:40:47] and he's asking prayer for Sister
[1:40:49] Melissa writes, "Brother Jason, I need

[1:41:29] place. Said she's aware of the young boy
[1:41:32] we have been praying about that I have

[1:41:45] that.
[1:41:47] Um,

[1:42:31] they started saying his leg is five
[1:42:33] times normal size and they may have to
[1:42:35] amputate it. And so they're asking

[1:42:51] son, and we all most of us know brother
[1:42:53] Samuel and the Lord uh delivered him
[1:42:58] several years ago. Brother Matt, where
[1:43:01] you at, Matt? Uh behind me. You remember
[1:43:03] you prayed and he was he was hearing
[1:43:05] those voices and the devil and he he his
[1:43:08] pathways were corrupted when he was a
[1:43:09] baby. Had an episode and so he he can't
[1:43:12] fight against it like you and I can. And
[1:43:14] and he was actually going crazy. Very
[1:43:17] devout young man, very godly, wants
[1:43:20] nothing to do with the world. He must be
[1:43:21] 18 or 19 by now. and uh and and the
[1:43:26] devil talking to him, driving him nuts
[1:43:28] and hearing voices almost, you know,
[1:43:31] even even had suicidal thoughts. And
[1:43:33] brother Matt actually prayed for him and
[1:43:34] God healed him on the spot instantly.
[1:43:36] And he was completely recovered and
[1:43:38] stayed that way for years. Sister Lisa
[1:43:40] informs me that the enemy is bringing
[1:43:42] that back on him again. And uh we're
[1:43:44] going to pray it right off again.
[1:43:46] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Come,
[1:43:50] Sister Melissa. My ministers gather over
[1:43:52] here in the middle with me. Uh, step
[1:43:54] right there, sis. Let me have all my
[1:43:56] ministers right here. Put your hand
[1:43:57] right on top of that, sister. Amen. Let
[1:43:59] brother Joe through there, brother Matt.
[1:44:02] Amen. Come ahead, brother. All right.
[1:44:05] Praise the Lord. Uh, yeah. Slip on down
[1:44:07] here, son.
[1:44:10] Now, this is the husband of the
[1:44:12] coworker. All right.
[1:44:20] Oh, wow.
[1:44:22] Right. All right. We're going we're
[1:44:24] going to send this out. All your
[1:44:26] brothers, put your hands here. Father,
[1:44:28] in the name of the Lord Jesus, having
[1:44:31] seen you already work, Lord, how could
[1:44:32] we doubt? With eagerness, Lord, we send
[1:44:35] forth this prayer cloth that it should
[1:44:37] defeat the enemy, Lord, on all points
[1:44:40] that the Lord Jesus Christ would be
[1:44:42] glorified and magnified. That Jesus
[1:44:44] lives and Jesus saves and Jesus heals.
[1:44:47] That he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:44:49] forever. That we are believe that we are
[1:44:52] that group who know their God and we
[1:44:54] will do great exploits. And Lord, we ask
[1:44:56] that the enemy, Father, be rebuked by
[1:44:59] the Holy Ghost. And father, may you
[1:45:01] bring complete victory and may it be a
[1:45:03] witness to those who are under
[1:45:05] observation of it. We commit it to you
[1:45:07] now in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you,
[1:45:10] sister Melissa. Let's pray. Let's stay
[1:45:12] right here. Let's pray for Samuel. Uh
[1:45:14] take the hand of someone standing near
[1:45:16] you and we're going to take up all of
[1:45:18] these requests. Father, in the name of
[1:45:21] the Lord Jesus, Lord, we stand for
[1:45:24] brother Samuel St. John. Lord, you've
[1:45:26] already delivered him of this and that's
[1:45:28] just a devil tormenting him. Father, we
[1:45:31] ask that Satan take his hands off of
[1:45:34] God's property. We ask the Holy Spirit,
[1:45:37] who is the enforcer of God's word, that
[1:45:39] he would soundly rebuke the enemy. May
[1:45:42] he be humiliated, Lord, and go into dry
[1:45:45] places and leave tormenting your son. I
[1:45:48] pray for Samuel's complete deliverance
[1:45:50] right now. Father, for every demon of
[1:45:53] anxiety, we call for the complet
[1:45:55] deliverance, your bride, Lord God, in
[1:45:58] this world that it's a plague upon even
[1:46:00] our even your family. And we call for
[1:46:02] freedom, oh God, in this hour right now.
[1:46:05] We're believing, Lord God, for the
[1:46:07] special requests that Brother Luther
[1:46:08] has. We're believing, oh God, that
[1:46:10] you'll comfort the family of Brother
[1:46:12] George. We're believing, Lord God, these
[1:46:14] requests that you will meet them, Lord
[1:46:16] God, by the power, Lord, of your
[1:46:19] resurrection. Meet these special
[1:46:21] unspoken requests and all the written
[1:46:23] requests that have been sent to us.
[1:46:25] Lord, we've read them and called them
[1:46:26] out before you and we commit them now
[1:46:29] into your hands. Lord, may you grant it.
[1:46:32] Remember Brian, Father, I pray you
[1:46:34] rebuke that infection in his leg and may
[1:46:37] he be made completely whole in the name
[1:46:39] of the son of God, the Lord Jesus
[1:46:42] Christ. Amen. Amen. Turn around, shake
[1:46:45] hands with somebody near you. Amen.
[1:46:47] Sister, sweetheart, God bless you. Amen.
[1:46:51] Praise the Lord. Praise the name of the
[1:46:54] Lord. You love the Lord.
[1:46:55] Amen.
[1:46:56] Anybody got a testimony before we go?
[1:46:59] Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Matt, uh
[1:47:01] Tony, we're going to Where's the Where's
[1:47:03] our Oh, here we go. I get it.
[1:47:10] All right, Matt. I think you're should
[1:47:13] be fire in the hole. Um we on? All
[1:47:16] right. Um this is actually on behalf of
[1:47:18] my wife Katie. Um the other couple weeks
[1:47:21] ago we were sitting on the couch and she
[1:47:23] got up to go get some tea and she
[1:47:25] tripped over the cat and face planted
[1:47:27] right into a cabinet and the corner of
[1:47:30] the cabinet went into her eye and
[1:47:32] instantly went blind and the eye just
[1:47:34] just had a concussion. Um and um
[1:47:39] immediately I laid hands on her and we
[1:47:40] we went to prayer and um as soon as I
[1:47:44] finished praying, vision was restored in
[1:47:46] her eye and um I mean the whole time she
[1:47:49] was blind and then when we finished
[1:47:52] praying she could see again. There's
[1:47:53] still a lot of pain. Um she was real
[1:47:56] concussed, very very bad. Um to the
[1:47:59] point where I was about to take her to
[1:47:59] the hospital because she couldn't keep
[1:48:01] her sentences together. Like she was
[1:48:02] slurring real bad. Um, she was having
[1:48:05] like cognitive issues where she could
[1:48:07] not like she there was a carton of heavy
[1:48:10] cream on the table and she could read
[1:48:12] the word heavy cream and knew what it
[1:48:13] meant but she couldn't say it and that's
[1:48:15] not good. I mean that's at that point I
[1:48:18] was ready to take her to the hospital
[1:48:19] and we kept praying and she said it was
[1:48:21] like a someone flipped a switch and all
[1:48:24] the any kind of cognitive effects
[1:48:26] completely cleared immediately
[1:48:28] and um it was
[1:48:30] I just want to thank the Lord cuz there
[1:48:32] was one one final detail to that that
[1:48:34] was kind of miraculous in its own right.
[1:48:37] Um, she was wearing her glasses when she
[1:48:40] hit the the table. And that particular
[1:48:43] pair of glasses had just been beat all
[1:48:45] to thunder and the the lens on the
[1:48:48] glasses, the screw had been replaced
[1:48:51] several times cuz it kept on popping
[1:48:52] out. And that that lens just wouldn't
[1:48:54] stay in the frames at all. And when she
[1:48:56] hit that just full force onto that lens,
[1:48:59] it stayed in the frame and it didn't
[1:49:01] come out. I don't know how that's
[1:49:02] possible. like you could just pop it out
[1:49:04] with your fingers
[1:49:06] and it folded her glasses basically in
[1:49:09] half. But that that lens protected her
[1:49:12] eye or it would have I it would have
[1:49:14] tore eye out in the name of the Lord.
[1:49:16] So I just want to thank the Lord.
[1:49:17] Amen to that.
[1:49:22] Anybody else? Praise the Lord. Anybody
[1:49:24] else? Oh, brother.
[1:49:29] Brother Matt, you probably remembered
[1:49:31] last time you preached here on a Sunday
[1:49:32] morning, you had a prayer line up here
[1:49:34] for a lot of people when I come in the
[1:49:36] last several months. I just I just
[1:49:40] realized today I was like, man,
[1:49:43] I've been having prayer for my lower
[1:49:45] like kidney stones or something. It's
[1:49:47] like every three weeks I'd have pain in
[1:49:49] my lower abdomen.
[1:49:52] And so I come up for prayer and all the
[1:49:53] brothers laid hands on me and just
[1:49:55] realized today it's been two months.
[1:49:57] Wow. since I've had a pain.
[1:49:58] Hallelujah.

[1:50:16] She's been hurting in her side. And I
[1:50:18] want to get a prayer cloth to take to

[1:50:47] come in contact with our dear sister
[1:50:49] Becky, that every afflicting devil would
[1:50:52] have to flee by the power of the risen
[1:50:55] Christ. We take authority over it. Lord,
[1:50:58] your your family is entitled to help.
[1:51:02] Father, you purchased it at Calvary and
[1:51:04] we will not surrender the rights of our

[1:51:27] Holy Spirit that Lord, the supernatural
[1:51:29] power of God would surge through her.

[1:51:34] inflammation or damage or whatever it
[1:51:36] might be. We condemn it. We let let
[1:51:40] heaven record that at this moment as as
[1:51:43] the duly authorized family of God, we
[1:51:47] condemn the work of this evil spirit
[1:51:49] tormenting my mom. And we ask that the
[1:51:52] Holy Spirit rebuke the devil. We ask
[1:51:55] that he take his hands off of God's
[1:51:57] personal private property. May she be
[1:52:00] well in Jesus name. Amen. All right,

[1:52:40] miracle.

[1:52:45] Lord, that it's going for a specific
[1:52:47] need. Lord, the enemy, he's already,
[1:52:50] Lord, trying to figure out how to
[1:52:52] prevent this. He's He's already beaten.
[1:52:54] He's already defeated. We call for his
[1:52:57] complete defeat. We call for all of his
[1:52:59] works to be overthrown. May the Holy
[1:53:02] Spirit overthrow all of his works and
[1:53:04] plans. And may there be deliverance,
[1:53:06] Father, in the name of Jesus Christ. Let
[1:53:09] the Holy Spirit travel now and bring
[1:53:12] this to pass in the name of Jesus
[1:53:14] Christ. We believe it. Amen. Now, don't
[1:53:18] you doubt it a bit. Amen. Praise God.

[1:53:37] won't happen. We've already called for
[1:53:39] it to happen. We've already seen it
[1:53:41] happening. We know by the Bible. Is this
