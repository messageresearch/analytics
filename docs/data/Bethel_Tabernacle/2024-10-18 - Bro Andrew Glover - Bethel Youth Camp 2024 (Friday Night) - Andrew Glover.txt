Lord just carry on brother Andrew you ready to receive tonight you're believing you know the third chapter of John Jesus talk talks about the the condemnation of the world is that light shined in darkness and darkness comprehended it not think about how privileged you are to to be here tonight and to be able to comprehend the light of this hour now he made two points Jesus makes two points and you're going to decide right now which one you're in he said the world who loves sin hates the light and the reason for that is is because the light exposes their sinfulness so they don't want nothing to do with it but he talks about that the righteous love the light and they come to the light now I don't want my problems exposed to you and you don't need your problems exposed to the person beside you but I sure want to be exposed to me I want to know if I got a problem I want to come to light how many say Lord I want to come to the I'm willing to submit myself to the to the to the microscope to the spotlight of the Holy Spirit and say Lord let your word shine down into my heart tonight and show me what I need how many how many is that the category you want to be say Lord I need to know what I need to know about me and how I can be more like you oh that's why we're here friends we're not here as a social Gathering my this isn't a club this isn't a a social gospel we're here to meet with the Lord he's in his word you believe it now we're going to sing it again as we invite brother Andrew so happy to have him again this year get your hearts and Minds ready oh Lord I receive I tell

Jesus is here oh Jesus is here you believe that tonight Jesus is here all things are possible for Jesus is here oh Jesus is here Jesus is [Music] here all things are [Music] possible for Jesus is here amen how many believes he's here tonight amen we have firm Believers tonight that Jesus has told us that we're two or three are gathered together in my name he said there I will be in their midst and amen I was looking around tonight and there's more than two or three here amen but there's a whole house full of Believers tonight amen that believe that he is the same yesterday today and forever and I heard the prophet of God say just the other day he said now he made that promise that we're two or three are gathered together he would be in their midst he said but it's he said it's really depending on the attitude of the two three that's there towards the one who's in their midst and I wonder tonight how many say Lord just give me the right attitude amen the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass you believe that tonight maybe we just bow our hearts for a word of prayer I know there's many needs here tonight I know there's many lives and situations amen but we know the Lord is here tonight let's just join together and pray Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers father have gathered here on this Friday evening Lord father the second service of this Youth Camp Lord we've not gathered here to be seen or to be heard but Lord we've gathered here to worship you and to honor you and Lord to lift up the inside that you sent in this generation Lord as your word said if I would be lifted up I will draw all men unto myself Lord we're not here tonight as we heard it spoke in the service yesterday we're not here to lift up a preacher or to lift up a man lift up a church or an idea but Lord we're here to lift up the king King of Kings and the Lord of lords and we know that when you come in the midst of the congregation father we know that miracles happen and we know that hearts are changed and lives are touched and father as these Believers have gathered here this evening Lord I'm reminded of how that in the Garden of Eden in the cool of the evening your Prophet told us that you would come down and you would fellowship with Adam and Eve Lord you would ask them how they enjoyed their Earth their stay on Earth that day you would ask them and fellowship with them and Lord we know what happened and how there was a fall in the garden and communication and and fellowship was broken but Lord by the blood of Jesus sent AET ination who said we are back and our souls are back communing with Lord father in this evening time I invite you to come in this meeting tonight Lord we join our faith together and we rebuke every Spirit of the enemy oh God lord every devil that would try to hinder these meetings and hinder the moving of the Holy Spirit SP father we bind it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we invite the liberty of the Holy Ghost father may you come Among Us May the angel of God that changes lives Lord may you come in this building Lord and we'll be sure to entertain your presence father May a heart be touched tonight oh God and Lord when we would leave this meeting tonight may we be able to say Lord did not our hearts burn within us not as brother Andrew talked to us along the way but as the same one that walked the emus Road 2,000 years ago would come present and speak to our hearts here tonight now father we commit this meet in thy faithful hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God Rich you bless you this evening how many's happy Amen to be at Camp again amen amen well what's the rest of y'all happy about amen how many's happy to be at Camp again amen we thank the Lord amen Give the Lord a hand clap of Praise it's all right amen how many thanks God for these meetings and you thank God for the burden and the vision of brother Jason and brother Matt in the assembly we want to say thank you brother Jason brother Matt God bless you all and amen all the ministry team here in the local church there we not here but in the local church there in Buford at bethl Tabernacle all the workers it's working we say God bless you all and amen isn't it just an honor to serve the Lord in this time amen we want to bring a greetings tonight from our pastor brother Matt Morris the Saints there at Grace Tabernacle amen the Lord actually just recently moved us there to Arkansas with brother Matt and the assembly there and helping them and working out of the church there there and evangelizing and so brother Matt said to be sure and bring his greetings here I'm sure we'd have probably had some young folks from the church here this weekend but we're actually uh having meetings there this weekend so amen I preach there Wednesday and come over here on Thursday so amen it's an honor to be here and we want to thank the Lord again for this opportunity to be speaking with brother Donnie amen a real man of God a friend of ours and a buddy how many appreciate that word last night amen wasn't that a masterpiece amen amen I tell you I sitting there I sitting there listening to brother Donnie preached last night about halfway through that I thought the devil's probably hating the fact that he sent that hurricane amen through these mountains amen CU he didn't know a Son of God was going to take what he'd done in the natural and take it to the spiritual and expose that devil amen but we say God bless you brother Donnie thank you for your labors and we know it is a real sacrific for him to be here this weekend and of course all the ministry all the ministering Brothers God richly bless you all and amen we love the Lord tonight if you have your Bibles we want to go to the book of Psalms the 132nd chapter but first rather we're going to go to Psalms 23 I know this is a very very familiar scripture to us tonight in Psalms 23 and then we'll go to Psalms 132 and also Philippians chapter 4 amen you love the Lord tonight amen as I said this is a familiar Psalm I believe even brother Donnie referred to it last night but in Psalms chapter 23 and verse one David here is writing he says now the Lord is my shepherd He says I shall not want when you look at the definition of that word want it means to diminish for a lack of need so David is saying I have needs but the Lord is my shepherd and my needs are not going to cause me to decrease or to diminish so we could say the Lord is my shepherd I shall not diminish for a lack of something to supply my need now in the book of proverb Psalms 132 Psalms 132 I want to read a portion of scripture there in Psalms 132 and beginning at verse number 13 David here again is writing in Psalms 132 and verse 13 and he says for the Lord hath chosen Zion so this is not something he's doing but it's something he's already done for the Lord hath chosen Zion and he hath desired it for his habitation this is my rest forever here will I dwell for I have desired it now watch verse 15 I will abundantly bless her provision and I will satisfy her poor with bread notice who's doing this the Lord I will also clothe her priest with salvation and her Saints shall shout Al loud for Joy there will I make the Horn of David to Bud for I have ordained a lamb for my anointed I love Verse 18 his enemies will I clothe with shame but upon himself shall his crown flourish in other words David's enemies would be clothed with shame but David would be exalted in the book of Philippians chapter 4 I want to read one verse there in Philippians chapter 4 I know that's another very very familiar reading to you but in Philippians chapter 4 and: 19 Paul here writing he says but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus let's just read that verse together but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches and Glory by Christ Jesus we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight if I would take a title here tonight I want to talk to you for a few moments here on Zion accepting God's provision Zion accepting God's provision now we read there in Philippians chapter 4 and verse 19 and I just want to share that verse to you uh from the Amplified Bible if that'd be okay he says there in Pro Philippians 4:19 he says my God will liberally Supply he will F until full your every need amen my God will liberally Supply he will F until full your every need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus now I I just want to read a quote here to lay a foundation 1963 accepting God's provided way at the end time he says and now for a text I would like to speak from this on this is accepting God's provided way for the end time he said now let me quote that again because on the tapes I believe they're taping these messages how many's thankful for the tapes amen he said and all these tapes that we have we have some 500 texts that I guess I've preached from he said now they've got something similar to that amen but not exactly this see they've got something similar to that but not exactly this accepting God's provided way at the end time now you that studied the message you know he preaches God's provided way for healing and God has made a way he preaches many sermons even back in the 40s and the 50s leading up to this time preaching on God providing a a way but in 1963 right at the change of the ministry he says now God has provided a way at the end time so he's no longer just saying what God has done amen but now he's saying what the god done back there amen he is able to do here because we're no longer in the beginning amen but we've now come to the end he said now you know there's many ways that people can take but really he said there's only two ways that a man can go he said that's the right way and the wrong way and all of us here tonight he said we're on those roads the right or the wrong one see there's no middle ground because Jesus said you cannot serve God and Mammon which he meant the world he said we're either right or we're wrong he said now if we'll just get away from our own way is the only way that we can get into God's way I want you to think about that looking here tonight maybe 350 400 people amen there's there's many different ways amen represented here tonight like you have a way you do something you have a way you do something and that's in the natural amen but if we turn it to the spiritual if you're going to see God do anything in the in the meeting or in the services you got to come out of the way you think it ought to be done and you've got to come into what God has established by a Vindicated Prophet see he said God has made a way amen provided a way for everything he has provided the way he said and where we get in trouble is not following that way and injecting into it our own ways and that makes a perversion and anything that is that is perverted amen is not dependable so any way out side of this message amen is a perversion therefore it's not Dependable therefore it should not have any time in our services or in our lives God Amen has made a way now when God makes a way man as always usually amen rejects the provided way of God Amen and begins to try to add to the way or to improve it or to amen take something out of it but let me just say this God's ways amen are perfect amen they're not they're not imperfect they're not partial amen but God 's ways are perfect therefore amen how can you add to or take away from Perfection amen if you take away from it it's no longer perfect amen and if you add to it it's no longer perfect amen because perfect is perfect whether you think it is or not I think of Solomon's words when he said there in Proverbs 14:12 he said there is a way amen which seeth right unto a man amen but the end thereof are the ways of death now I just want to say this there is a vast difference a in something that seeth right amen and knowing something is right right amen it's one thing to think something is right or to feel that something is right or to amen have some type of inclination that something is Right amen but when you can stand there and say I know this is right amen you have now gone beyond the element of presuming and you have stepped over into Authority now you know as brother Donnie said last night there's many denominations amen and every one of them are walking Amen in the way which seeth right amen unto a man very funny thing to me that people say the people the message amen are following a man amen but in reality the Baptist or baptizing the way a man thinks they ought to baptize amen the Pentecostals are breaching the evidence of the Holy Ghost based on Amen the way a man thinks the Holy Ghost should be identified in the life of a Christian but here a Prophet come among us and said see all these denominations are walking amen but they don't have an absolute and so because they don't have an absolute amen they've G got to find something or make a choice or somebody has got to raise up among them and say this is the way to go and this is the way to baptize amen are you hearing me tonight what they do is they choose to walk Amen in a way that seeth right but a prophet said see you've got to come amen not the way that seems right amen but the way God says is Right amen see and that's the way of the Cross amen we ought to just get it out in the open tonight there's no other way a man can be saved amen out side of the shed blood of Jesus Christ that is coming in this age amen by the preaching of the Cross of Calvary there is no other way amen joining a church is not God's way it's a way that seems right amen just accepting that God has sent a prophet amen is not God's way it is a way that seems right amen now let me just go ahead and say it amen just going to a certain church or following on a certain Ministry amen and getting some idea that I'm okay amen that's not God's way God's way is the cross I say then tonight that the way of God Amen is right because it's the way amen of the word brother said what a Christian needs today in this atomic age this time of uncertainty amen you need something besides just an experience amen of joining church he said what you need is an anchor what you need is an absolute that you know because churches will fail and people will fail but Christ amen cannot fail he is the ABS absolute to the believer and if Christ is your absolute you are tied to him and if he is your absolute you are tied to him then you're tied to the word now that tells whether we got the right absolute or not see if you can read it in the scripture amen something that Christ has ordained or commissioned us to do and because there's some twisting around if someone would tell you well that was for the disciples or that was for someone else you don't need to hold on to that amen then Christ is not your absolute the very second a person tells you something amen contrary to the word of God and you begin to walk in what they've told you amen you're no longer walking with an assurance amen that the way you're walking in is right he said the person amen who led you out of the way is your absolute he said but if that word Christ still holds amen see then he's your absolute and we mustn't let anything stir us amen out of the way of the word I really don't care care what Hollywood thinks I really don't care what denomination thinks I really don't care what Society thinks listen God has sent a message in this generation and it is not something that has been done in a corner somewhere it has been Vindicated around the world seven times if there's ever been a time that we ought to come back Amen to the homeland of the church amen the message of the hour amen the absolute that has been brought to this age I say now is the time to do it I say thank God tonight we are not walking amen in a man's choice we are not walking in a man's way but we are walking in God's choice he said all these denominational ages 900 and something amen different Protestant denomination he said each one of them of course you could see their idea he said I can't blame them amen each one claims that they are the truth now think about that they're everyone claiming that they are the truth he said that they have the truth and the people that belongs to those churches should believe that because they have St amen their destination listen their Eternal destination upon the teaching of that church and they're so much different one from the other till it makes 900 and something different questions therefore being 900 and something different questions there's got to be one correct answer listen 900 denominations amen but every one of them has their own answers amen but there's only really one correct answer he said listen and I would like for us tonight amen being that we are trying to go to heaven and to meet our lord Jesus who we all love he said I would like to search in the scripture Amen to find that one correct answer listen I know you may not think it's very important what you believe amen but let me just tell you tonight amen what you believe amen will make a journey and that Journey has a destination and I don't know about you I'm not headed for tribulation I'm not headed for hell I'm not headed for the world Amen I have come from God and I've got to go back to God you have come from God you got to go back to God and there's only one thing that can take you back amen is what God has provided to get you there listen friends I want to say it as plain as I know how our destination is heaven amen our destination is heaven and the prophet of God said don't be afraid no matter how many atomic bombs they have how many hydrogen bombs they have how much they speak of this and this is going to happen amen don't you be scared because God is at the whe amen he knows amen by his grace oh Church of the Living God I have just identified your transportation amen from time into eternity I have just identified amen what's going to carry you out of Leota into the future home it's not going to be your works it's not going to be your education it's not going to be human ability but the only thing that has the power Amen to pack a sinner amen that has been saved by the blood of Jesus Christ is the grace of God well devil get out of our way we ain't a legalistic church we ain't a bunch of legalistic young people we are the Bride of Jesus Christ and we have received a message it was not a message of law it was a message of Grace amen Grace is going to take us to our destination if there is a Bible question then there should have a Bible answer well let me just say what a prophet said he said notice being personally identified by the original headship amen we have the answer to the devil's question amen glory we have the answer it is he Christ is risen and has paid the price and is raising up the body and the devil can't stand it he said that's the reason these ecumenical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're doing what they're doing now amen that's the reason the devil is howling the way he is is his wickedness his scheme has been uncovered amen by the resurrected Christ in the headship over his body listen as long as it's a headless body it does not have a Direction but when a head comes to a body wherever the head goes amen there is where the body will go oh young people thank God tonight we're not following 900 different denomination but there has been a resurrection in the end time it has come the rising of the Sun and we now have original headship returned to the church listen we're not following this man and following this program we're following the same Pillar of Fire that led Moses out of Israel that led Paul to the road Damascus and changed him from Saul to Paul has come right here Amen to Carolina points on a Friday night Amen to meet somebody who is a part of the rapturing Church of Jesus Christ and their bodies shall come subject to the absolute that has been revealed in the age we're living in listen we're not following the first pull it's already fulfilled we're not looking for a repeat of the second pull it's already fulfilled our pool is a third pull come on young people our pull is a third pull brother said see in that Vision he said I heard him speak he said now I'll meet you in there now you young people know that there's been a lot of people add to that and take away from it amen and they've got this idea and they got that idea but let's just say what a prophet said he said and there there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead amen deity through his church listen the third pull is the revelation of the word coming into the Flesh of the church and Christ for the first time in 2,000 years having Supreme preeminence in a redeemed body he said see through his church having the preeminence in this church he said what the anointed man am but now the anointed people oh my to bring back amen the anointed bride and the bridegroom he said anointed by what what are we anointed by are we anointed by the music are we anointed by fancy words are we anointed by cliches are we anointed by a preacher's personality listen we are anointed amen by accepting what Eve turned down and Adam see coming back with the anointing of the word because he said that my word is spirit see it's the anointed with the word listen what Eve turned down he will come back and we accept what Eve turned down will return and we will accept it no wonder a prophet stood there and said accepting God's provided way in the end time he knew what they rejected in the beginning but there was a promise if there was a first Adam there would be a second adom if there was a first Eve there would be a second Eve oh young people you are the second Eve tonight who has come in contact with the return of the authority of the Resurrection In the Flesh of the redeemed Church my my my listen Eve turned it down but it's going to come back and somebody's going to accept it well I want to put that devil on notice I'm a part of the second Eve I'm a part of the Church of the firstborn I refuse to accept a man's idea I refused to accept the denomination I have been privileged to accept the original word in the power of its Authority listen according to Matthew 5 my Bible says this blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for what they might be filled there's a possibility they might get something no my Bible says they shall be filled he said if God has given us that blessed promise then the only thing that would keep us being filled with everything we thirst for for would be because we do not believe it we could just believe now that God will give the very thing that we're here for we'll all go home tonight and be happy and satisfied I'm so glad that he supplies our every need he promised he would do that he said now he never promised that he would Supply our wants but it was our needs that he would Supply he said I'm so glad of that because there's many times here a prophet now there's many times that we want things that's not good for us there's many times that we want things that's not good for us now amen it's Youth Camp so can I just preach a little bit amen you know what you want sometimes you want a new iPhone you want a new iPad or a new computer or a new video game or you get to that age amen amen that little car that you just so happy to get five months ago you get embarrassed of it you know you know what I'm talking about you start warning things can I say this there's a difference and our wants and our needs let me say this we want a new car or we want a new boat or we want a new iPad we don't need a new iPhone we don't really need a new iPad if we really let the rubber hit the road what we need is a Rapture what we need is a body change what we need is a resurrection what we need is this world Amen to pass away and come underneath the Redemption process of the word of God what we really need is to go to heaven what we really need is to see our babies saved what we really need to see is the Holy Ghost amen fill every hearts and fill every life I say oh God come among us this weekend as the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob who swore he would give us the things that we have need of yes sir see that's the confidence of the believer in his maker is he promised to meet the need now I haven't left my title amen Zion accepting God's provision look at this word provision Webster says it is the action of providing or supplying something for use right so when something is a provision it's not just there to be there but it's there for use see it's an amount or things supplied or provided it means to supply with food or to drink amen or equipment especially for a journey so brother John there is a direct connection between amen amen our provision our journey and our destination our provision our journey and destination in Psalms 132 David says these beautiful words he says the Lord hath chosen Zion 1964 future home brother comes along and says now remember amen Zion is always the bride so I could very well say Amen the bride accepting God's provision in Psalms 132:15 he says I will abundantly bless her provision Church of the Living God you want something to shout about amen amen it ain't a new song It Ain't a hot guitar it ain't a good set of drums amen if you want to shout about something amen you ought to be shouting that God who is rich in Mercy has provided an abundance of provision in the age you're living in when denominations have dried up when the world has fallen apart when systems have reached their end when men have gone crazy trying to fix the problems of the world but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound there will be a message that will tie all the loose hands together and there will be a table that will be set in the presence of my enemies I will feed on a seven course meal I will feed on the Seven Seals you will feed on the Revelation in an age that's in a famine God has provided an abundant provision look at this word provision you know what provision is it's a food supply oh brother R said look he said if we're going to have an understanding of God it must come out of God's word for the word is what God has gave us to feed our hungry souls and the holy spirit amen was sent to take the word of God and to feed us by the word you see it the holy spirit is sent from God to take the word of God and to give it to us as we have need now I'm so glad that God has made a provision like that aren't you that he would feed us David goes on to say I will abundantly bless her provision and I will satisfy look at this word satisfi it means to be fulfilled it means to have one's feel of it means to have an excess so here David is saying God will give us an excess amen I will satisfy her poor look at this word poor it means to be in want to be needy to be chiefly poor amen I think that's amazing amen that David uses a word that says chiefly poor and then Paul writes and says I'm the chief of Sinners David goes on to say a person who is subject to oppression and abuse and is needing help come on church amen a deliverance from trouble especially as delivered by God this is a general reference Amen to the lowest class so if you think you're high class this don't affect you if you think you're better than somebody else this won't affect you if you think you got it all figured out because some man has come up with a way that seems right to walk in then you have no need for this sermon but if you're like me and the rest of us who was the lowest of lows who was the down of the Downs who was the broken of the broken who was the Lost of the lost but God who is rich in Mercy fulfilled his word by supplying a bread that would feed the hearts of those who was in a time of need my brother says in the absolute 196 3 he says Lord I pray that you'll bless us today as we further go into this service he said that you would break to us the bread of life which is the revelation of Christ my I want to stop and Shout for 30 minutes right there are you hearing me amen I will feed amen her poor I will satisfy her poor with bread and a prophet comes along and says what is the bread it's the revelation I will satisfy those who are oppressed who are abused listen he didn't say he would do it by an emotion he didn't say he would do it by feeling he didn't say he would do it by gift he didn't say he would do it by sensation he said but I will provide a bread and that bread will be a revelation it will be the staff of life it will be the food that will put a vitamin power in the hearts of the young people that they can stand up on their own two feet and say Satan I Know Who You Are I'm not following a man I'm underneath the original headship and everything you know every scheme you've got every trick You' playing has been exposed by the revelation of Jesus Christ in the power of the authority of the word listen friends we are promised an abundance of Joy well I think it's time amen God bless you brother Drew forny I think it's time to kick that Rousy Rousey wo poor pitiful me devil right out of the house of God Amen it ain't spirit spiritual to be sad it ain't spiritual to be oppressed it ain't spiritual to be downtrodden and you know what else it ain't it ain't spiritual to be formal either well glory to God are you hearing me we ought to kick that devil out of here and remind him who we are we are the sons and daughters of Abraham we are Abraham's seed and we have Abraham's faith and we have a right by the blood to walk in the provision that God has made we have an abundance of joy we have an abundance of Peace we have an abundance of life we have an abundance of Health come on we have an abundance of healing we have an abundance but the greatest one of them all amen Eli is we have an abundance of Revelation that means we don't have to have one dead church service I know people say dead church services that churches ain't doing certain things but let's just say what a prophet said he said the last plague to strike Israel was spiritual death he said and spiritual death come because they lost their ability to discern between what was right and what was wrong and so when things come in rather than feeding on the Revelation that give him strength well can I preach amen that give him strength to stand up listen now amen Devil's coming around and saying you know it really don't matter if you wear a little makeup it don't matter if you paint your nails it don't matter if you put a pair of high heel shoes on it don't matter if you wear shorts boys that was just brother braham's opinion well let me say this I refuse to leave the the table of the Seven Seals I refuse to leave the table where there is a bread of his presence by the revealing of the son of man I refuse to begin to feed on a way that seems right when God has spread a table it's an abundance of Revelation to give you a strength to withstand the devil that's coming against you let me just say it like this in other words we are living in the Overflow brother Peter in other words we are living in the Overflow now you all know amen I hate to ask this but it's getting a little cold up here if they could turn that up amen there was a natural Israel amen but then there was a spiritual Israel brother said see as the Lord met with natural Israel he is meeting with us because they were on a journey they were on a journey so they were going somewhere but in order to get to their destination they must have a provision he said now what Israel was in the natural is what we are in the spiritual he said God is leading Israel naturally is what he doing for us spiritually today the lowest class of people on the face of the Earth are being led by the highest General that's ever been the most rejected class of people are being led come on church do you realize right now that our world I don't want to get in politics but just let me preach a second amen our world has forgot that a nation that turns against Israel is a nation that God will turn into the pits of Hell come on now because God is with Israel do you realize it's been over a year since them bunch of devils in invaded Israel and slaughtered and massacred and just tortured lives amen but today Israel is still fighting you mean they've been fighting for a whole year come on in other words it's been a whole year since bethl camp in 2020 three and some of you all are back here again this year and you still got a sword in your hand you still got a shield in front of you you still got a song in your heart you still got a Hallelujah in your voice you still got an amen in your soul you know why because you're not just church members You Are Spiritual Israel and if God can take Natural Israel and keep them in a battle for a solid year and every General that rose up against them they have slain might as well preach do you realize how bad it's getting amen Hamas can't even get Generals in fast enough before Israel takes them out they can't even get somebody installed in officially placed before Israel takes that leader out and they have to go get somebody else oh I feel like preaching right there what about you young people the devil has got Kings of lust he's got Kings of pornography he's got Kings of unbelief and kings of depression and kings of anxiety and every one of them he's put in power Amen to try to defeat you you have overcome because you're not just following a man you're following General Jesus you're following the King of Kings and the Lord of lords well I want to tell that devil God is on my side hey God is on my side and as long as God is fighting for little Israel she will prevail a solid year and they're still fighting brother Donnie a solid year and they're still getting up every morning and laying out there every night I got to move on I'll stay there too long you know why because they got a promise they got a destination see what Moses did in the natural was he led them in their journey by a god-given promise brother said now they were going to a promised land they were coming out of a chaos into a Promised Land from the ridiculous to the sublime see God had chosen Israel same as God has chosen Zion to fulfill his promise through therefore if he has chose us to be a part of the greatest battle that has ever been fought then that tells me that we are his responsibility fully so in other words if you join the United States military you don't have to go down to the local Bass Pro and buy you a gun to go fight with if you join the if you join the military you ain't got to go amen dig through World War I and World War II weapons and try to find something Amen to fight with but if God calls you into a position in the army of the Living God then he is under he is under mandate to give you something Amen to fight your enemy with you know what I'm telling you Church you ain't got to go to the Baptist to find something to fight this Devil with you ain't got to go back to Pentecostalism to find something to fight this Devil with but God has put a sword in your hand it's a two-edged sword it's the king sword it's the third pull it's the word of the Lord and it's here tonight to defeat the Devil anywhere anytime any place under any conditions when we come out and separate from The World God supplies our good times so you mean in this battle we're going to need something in our journey to our destination Brother D we're going to need a good time so you know what God said he said okay I'll give you a good time you won't have to go to the bar to find it you won't have to go to The Honky talk to find it you don't have to go to a club to find it you don't have to go to a joint or some or some or or some medically approved drug you don't have to go there listen if you'll come under my head SHP if you'll allow me to be your absolute if you'll walk in the way that I've proven to be right then on a Friday night I'll let you get your drunk on the holy ghost that you forget get your name and listen when you get done drinking you'll still be able to pick up a sword and fight well I feel like shouting on that one hey you get a man drunk in the natural he ain't very capable of picking up a sword the next morning because he can't discern what his enemy is but if you get a man drunk of this new wine listen it'll make you fight better come on it'll make you fight better you know what the part of God said he said you'll get so drunk you'll love everybody you want to fight the devil falling over Jesus and fight that Devil by loving your brother and loving your sister and forgetting who offended you and forgetting who let you he promised to supply our good times he promises to supply our bread he supplies everything that we have need of listen God Amen has revealed his secrets to this age and God has manifested which that word manifested is an action his word amen God Amen God has manifested his word and by manifesting his word he has brought a provision into existence for the church to use now you know in every scripture we find brother in scripture we find that there are seven compound Redemptive names of Jehovah how many knows that he says now what he appeared amen as God to the human race in the beginning so in the beginning he has to continue on under those names and under that provision so there is a connection between the food supply of the church and the name of God if he didn't then he certainly told something that was wrong when he appeared to the human race and said that's what he was and look what You' make God then just a man you would make him a liar he said if those Redemptive names did not apply to Jesus then he isn't the Savior and if all those Redemptive names was in Jesus well then he's the same yesterday today and forever in your journey you have some yesterdays in your journey you have some today's but you also have a destination or a future listen he's the same yesterday today and forever now this is what I love brother Ronnie there's no way out of it testing one two there's no way there's no way there's no way out oh God there's no way out of it they are inseparable if Jehovah appeared as Jehovah that will provide the sacrifice then he appeared as Jehovah that will heal he appeared as Jehovah our Banner Jehovah our Shield Jehovah our strength Jehovah Our Praise all these different names he appeared in he has to remain that because he introduced himself to the human race amen by those names what name name was it Jehovah he said now watch God his attitude towards the people amen from Eden now listen Back to Eden is wrapped in the seven Redemptive names what Eve turned down would return in the end time and there would be a bride who would accept it and there's no way out of it can I just say it like a prophet said it he said there I was out there the other day in the those in those in those squirrel woods and I was out there hunting he said and all of a sudden the Revelation came it's in the message of Grace if you want to hear the whole testimony he said all of a sudden the Revelation came and here it is the Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the new so a revelation what is bread it's Revelation so a bread of his presence came to a prophet who recorded on books and TBL and send it out to the bride who is spiritual Israel which is a type of Zion because it would be more than just a word in 1961 but it would be a food to feed on in 2024 in the middle of the Youth Camp you say brother Andrew Jehovah amen yes the one we know so well amen is Jehovah Gyra right amen now let me just say something to you I'm not going to read it to you I'm going to preach it amen Jehovah Gyra appeared to Abraham right right now do you all know that Abraham took his son Isaac who he had waited for young people he had waited brother brother John Moses he had waited for years for this child to come into existence amen and one day he's told by the Lord Tanner he says take Isaac up on the mountain and offer him as a sacrifice now there's something that stands out to me is when Isaac and Abraham when they took off walking Abraham looks over oh God he looks over at him and he says I and the lad will go Yonder worship and I and the lad will return okay but I but Abraham you're going up there Amen to slay Isaac so you will return but Isaac won't but see Abraham had a revelation that somewhere oh god brother Jason I got to thinking about this other day amen somewhere between the time Abraham and Isaac left Abraham had this revelation God is going to provide something between here and there so I can bring my son back here somewhere from the beginning to the ending God somewhere from the alpha to the Omega somewhere something is going to come into existence and it's going to be a provision and it's going to allow me to bring my son back he didn't know if it was going to be a resurrection he didn't know if he got up on that mountain there would be another child laying there but there was a revelation in his heart because he had been feeding on a bread as a part of the Israelite race oh church and said my God will provide something between here and there and my and my son will return so they both went together and it came to PL pass when they got to the place which God told him of that Abraham built an altar there and he laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the Altar and Abraham stretched for his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord come on in the room Lord he called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham he said here am I he said lay not thy hand upon thy lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know for now I know that thou fearest God seeing thou Hast not withheld thine only son can I just say something to you young people God was not looking for Isaac he was looking for Abraham's obedience to what he would provide come on church he was looking amen for Abraham to believe that what he would provide in the stad of his son would be sufficient to fulfill the prophecy that I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and I am the lad will return brother said see what obedience is it's what God wants you realize what obedience does it produces more than we realize he said see look Abraham called the name amen the place of Jehovah Gyra now let me just ask you something okay Abraham is up on top of the mountain there's no water there there's no food supply and all of a sudden he looks over and there's a ram can I ask you a question how could a ram get up there when there was nothing to grow one up there there was no water for it to live up there listen what the prophet says he said the text explains it he's Jehovah Gyra he spoke the ram into existence that's the reason Abraham called the place of the name Jehovah Gyra because if God has made a promise then God can provide the thing for that promise when God makes you a promise he doesn't leave anything up to you Amen to fulfill to bring that promise to pass when I say that what I mean is if he says I am the lad will go Yonder and worship and I am the lad will return then God will not get you up there and make you work something up or make you try to fast something up or try to beat something out of the altar he will provide something by the authority of his spoken word listen the only thing you have to do is accept what he provides oh I'm trying to behave God is able this morning to send in our midst the Holy Ghost he's able to send the power to heal the sick to save the lost to do anything that he has spoken of listen he is a true Messenger from God if he is he believes that God is able these stones to rise children unto Abraham he said he holds on to that listen Jehovah Gyra God will provide how's it going to happen brother Brandon I don't know there was a man of God stood here behind this pull pit last night and said God was going to deliver some of you are you hearing me now listen it was more than just a sermon it was a burden on his heart to stand here and say the spirit of the Lord spoke to my heart and said to deal with that right brother Donnie to deal with that spirit of suicide listen brother Donnie didn't come here knowing who had it he didn't come here knowing amen who had it how they was going to lose it but he came here as a man of God under an authority by the bread that he's been feeding on as the revelation of Jesus Christ and he stood behind that pull pit and he held the Word of Deliverance up to you listen friends I don't know how God does it but I just raised my hands and say Lord I've seen you do it too many times to believe you're still not able to do it again I've seen him save I've seen him heal brother the end I've seen him give the Holy Ghost I've seen him take lives that were shipwrecks and transform them by the renewing of their mind and the power of transformation oh let me say it with everything within me if he did it before he can do it again if he saved before he can save again Hallelujah I'm not a crazy man I am a Seed of Abraham who believes my God is still Jehovah Tyra to say what a prophet said look here brother BR the doctor said I had cancer and he told me I was going to die he said I got 30 days to live he said I was going to die now how in the world is something I can't see touch feel smell taste or anything else how in the world is something like that going to take this cancer out of me what's going to come down here and literally move that cancer aren't you thankful for an honest Prophet are you ready for it it's a real deep answer okay got your notebooks out you ready I don't know I'm reading you brother R's words I don't know but God promised it Hallelujah I don't know how he's going to do it but he promised to do it I don't know how he's going to move the cancer but he promised he would do it I don't know how he's going to bring you out of the pit that you're in but I know he promised he is able these stones to rise children un Abraham I don't know how I don't know when I don't know what he's going to use to do it but I know one thing Gideon he's more than able to do it he's done it before and I stand here tonight and say he can do it again because the Jehovah of the old is is the Jesus he's the Jesus of the new I don't know how I don't know how but I know he can what are you saying can I say what a prophet said because he's just as much Jehovah Gyra right now brother Chris he's just as much Jehovah Gyra right now as he was then okay so here's Isaac on the alar stay thy hand what Lord there's a ram in the thicket so Abraham goes over there sorry y'all forgive me okay there's the ram brother Jason there's a ram look at it man there's a ram Isaac look over here son there's a ram

ramp come on tell mama there's a ramp look there put it on the internet there's a ram right there's a ram do you see the ram it's a beautiful Ram come on come on if he would have walked around it like that he would have had to taken Isaac's life that Ram was of no use to Abraham until he went over and picked it up are y'all hearing me some of you all had this message your whole life and you've been

Moses had been CAU up under some good teaching his mother had been taught had taught him the way of God but when he got up there and met this person his mother had taught him about you see what I mean he said many people take the Bible and they understand it he said they take the Bible and understand the intellectually perfect but that's not it that's not what we're talking about no matter how well

brother Ed preached it years ago amen a bread of this presence to feed on and when you start eating on this food you start looking for the devil my Bible says you have a boldness to enter into the Holy by the blood of Jesus Jesus not an old way but a new and the living way but said that was the dead way in order of law but now we enter by grace through the holy spirit it's not what you do it's what he does for us by Grace we just accept it brother digs picked it up this morning I'm going to pick it up tonight flood relief is here it's here it's here Christ takes away the sin we believe it hear the gospel believe it accept it then if we truly accept it from the depths of our heart God gives us the Holy Ghost as a witness I brother sister I don't want you to think I'm a Fuster at other churches and trying to put that Pat this church what I'm trying to do is get the carnality out of the church he said the churches when they organize their churches the things they do they block the blessings of God by their theology that God cannot break through to bless his people they get their church so formal and so stiff and so starchy till the Holy Spirit can't even come into the church and then when the devil seen he had that made and some was going to break through anyhow then he let them open other channels that was was at the gospel and run them off in fanaticism they either get to a bunch of Fanatics or a bunch of starches but in the middle of the road brother Jason Bears the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ can I go ahead and say it the gospel is not a Frolic and neither is it a funeral procession but a prophet of God's a prophet of God said it's a feast it's a it's a so what do you do at a feast you Feast at a feast you feast and you get full my God shall supply all of your needs he shall liberally fill until you're full come on Church you know what I can I have a liberty here you know what I'm talking about amen you come to church and you come in on Wednesday night or Sunday morning and you get in there and even maybe here in this Camp you come in and sit down and the world's on your shoulders in this problem in this situation and she didn't look at you and he didn't like it it's Youth Camp come on are you hearing me well I thought I was a part of this click and I thought I he you come in here with all that on you and really what you're in is you are in a prison you're in a flood as you heard last night you're over loaded as you heard this morning what you need is a way out what you need is a way out brother said look he said see the old pasal lamb passed away he said and today they've crucified the word he said but look that's just been recently they've accepted a Creed in the stead of the word he said that's the day the word come into full effect that's just been read recently he said see and now if the churches would forget their Creeds forget their dogmas and just take the Bible and plead the promise then the promise would become effective to them see well that's the same thing with your Traditions they make the word of God un effect he said the spiritual bride of today the so-called Church she takes the word of God but she won't accept it so she takes it but she won't accept it no she accepts dogmas of it instead so the words not effective to her so in other words she don't realize the prophet of God said it's already provided for you to accept now can I just say something to you barema sat in a prison okay they were offering Pascal Lambs down at the temple but brother Donnie up on a cross there was the Lamb of God who was dying for the sins of the world brother Diggs they were down there in the temple underneath the law offering a sacrifice killing a lamb when Jesus hung on the cross and cried it is finished the very minute he spoke those words it is finished this become of none effect so to stay there you went out the same way you come in because now The Mercy Seat has changed from here to there but let me tell you something the only way you can see that there is you got to lift up your head you got to lift up your head from looking down at where he has been and start looking up to where he is are you hearing me in other words if you're in a valley if you're going to see the top of the mountain you got to look up brother said see what is this bride she is a special designation of himself he's the creator of that church he created the bride his own bride in other words this bride has been predestinated and designed by predestination to be accepted in the Beloved let me let me I'm I'm going to I'm going to give you a loaf of bread and we're going to go home okay or or wherever having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by not a loaf by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise to the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved look at this word accepted to be highly favored to pursue with Grace brother B said then just by accepting it won't only do it but God's got to vindicate back that he has accepted you see you can accept him but then he accepts you the god of Heaven has accepted you and his life is in you and you are the sons and daughters of God there is no more condemnation you are free from sin you are free from the cares of the world why to them that have been by one Spirit baptized into one body the blood of the Lamb has been applied future home Heaven and Earth have met God and man is reconciled a restored Eden a restored Eden has begun see all the curse is gone just like all the curse of sin is gone when the Holy Ghost accepts you are y'all ready for this are you awake are you ready to are you ready for a piece of bread you don't accept it it accepts [Applause] you feed on that one time you don't feel like crazing your hands feed on that piece of bread one time and it'll put such a strength in you he'll say devil get out of my way it ain't up to me he's already accepted me I am the possessor I am the possessor of Eternal Redemption what are you saying preacher I'm saying here it is you say what is that what are all these quotes what are all these scriptures you've been reading are you ready help God is our refuge I I told the devil I was going to dedicate something to him so here it is God is our refuge and strength he is a very present help in the time of trouble therefore will not we fear though the Earth be removed and through the mountains be carried in the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled though the mountains Shake where the swelling thereof there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high are y'all ready for this sign I'm reading about you Psalms 46 is you God is in the the midst of her devil hear me and hear me well God is in the midst of this Camp God oh the devil didn't like that did he God is in the midst of this Camp you say preacher the devil don't like me good he don't like me either but it don't change the fact that God is in the midst of the habitation that he had chosen to dwell in God is in the midst of her are y'all ready for the rest of to what he said about you she shall not be [Applause] moved God shall help her and that right early the Heathen raised the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice the Earth melted the Lord of host is with us Glory Glory Glory I'll shout by myself the Lord of host is with this young people the god of Jacob Jacob is Grace the god of Grace can I buy 10 minutes Matt is that okay brother J the god of Grace is with her come Behold The Works of the Lord I want to preach here for an hour what desolations Heath made in the earth you know the Bible prophesied he would inherit the desolate heritages the waste places the places that mankind had bypassed God said I'll inherit those and by my transforming power I will transform those desolate heritages into memorials come Behold The Works of the Lord he maketh Wars to cease unto the end of the Earth he breakthe bow he cutteth the spear in Sunder he burneth The Chariot in fire be still and seem like you know that I am God be still and know stand under the message one time and know that I am God and I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted the Earth the Lord of hosts is with us young people I wish I had the voice of a Thousand Angels he's with us tonight we're not alone the god of Abraham and Jacob is with you he's in you he's in the midst of you you know what I said he leoa won't move you Hollywood can't move you depression can't move you there's only one thing that can move you and that is the quickening power of the revelation of the word help is here but it's in the form of spiritual Revelation y'all remember Jesus stood there in Matthew 16 he said these words who do men say that I the son of man am remember that remember he said then he said well some say you're John the Baptist some Elias jeremias or others but whom say ye that I am now are you with me of all people to answer Here Comes Simon Peter the one who lied the one who cursed brother Donnie preached years ago uh Peter a cussing preacher out fishing on the water naked right something like that had all kinds of problems problems I mean he was a mess can I say this to you and and and and this is what I won't get to before you go wherever not home mother Jason of all the ones that should have spoke up the one with the most mistakes of all the ones that were qualified to speak up and say Lord I know who you are the one with the most mistakes speaks up and says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God can I just drop something to you is that okay you know what that tells me that Peter had more Revelation than mistakes he had more Revelation than mistakes some of you all have left the devil silence your voice when it comes to quoting the promises of God because you made this mistake and you made this failure and you have this blund and this is in your history and this is in your past well I want to tell that devil this is a church full of a bunch of Simon Peters we got mistakes we got failures we got shortcomings but we got more Revelation and we got mistakes we got more Revelation the full word has been delivered to this age and we fed on it hallelujah hallelujah I accept the Revelation I accept [Applause] it because Revelation Revelation I got here too late Revelation brings hope as our musicians are coming tonight y'all remember Joshua and Israel you know the Bible says that God as we've already said God was on their side right they were a promised people of Victory brother sister they were never supposed to go into one battle and walk out defeated every battle they went into because of who they were and whose they were they were to carry out the victory so one day they go fight that great old big Battle of Jericho brother one probably the biggest battles and they win it I mean man they went to bethl 2023 and they fought that devil they got the victory they fought that devil and prayed through and the Holy Ghost come and then they went to another battle like Israel who went to the Battle of AI and though it's not artificial intelligence they went to the battle of AI right after the biggest battle of their history Jericho and lost it they went from the biggest battle to one of the smallest battles and lose it and Joshua said well I guess that's just you know I guess that's just the way it is I mean I guess we just accept defeat I guess we just see what next battle holds I guess we'll just keep on floating along till something changes Joshua said hold it a second he said listen there's something wrong somewhere you know what he did he fell on his face and began to pray in Joshua 710 the Lord said un Joshua get thee up wherefore thou has line upon thy face Israel has sinned and they have also transgressed my Covenant which I command them for they have even taken the accursed thing and have also stolen and disassembled also and they have put it oh [Music] God let me just say it like this aens who he's talking about and they brought a golden wedge into the tent and put it even among their own stuff so televisions come back in homes and I know it's not popular no more but it's still in the message so let's just let's just preach the bread okay therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies but they turned their back before the enemies and they were accursed but Joshua hears the Lord sanctify yourselves sanctify the people for thus say the Lord of God if Israel there there is a cursed thing in the midst of thee oh Israel thou can't stand before thy enemies until you take away the cursed things from among you so brother Jason Joshua figures out it was the golden wedge in the camp that was in the home of aen you know what he done they went down there and they burned Aken they burned his family they took the burned Ashes to the valley and spread them and upon and spread the ashes and covered up with the Rocks then they went back to the battle and was Victorious now will you go with Joshua 7 to the book of Hosea with me there's a story of redemption and it's Hosea a prophet asking the Lord Lord with all of Israel's mistakes and with how they backslid and things they've got involved in and things they've done things they've done all that how can you still love Israel can I can I just break this down in simple other word terms for you in other words Hosea you go marry yourself a harlot and you have kids by her and then you'll understand how that I cannot turn my back on my own seed and you'll understand why with Israel and all of her mistakes I cannot throw her away Israel goes back into her whoredom and her all the problems but in Hosea chapter 2 and verse1 14 I want to read this to you therefore behold look what he says I will Allure her and I will bring her in the wilderness and I will speak comfortably unto her who's her can I say that you look at this word Lord it means to attract it means to be open oh God so brother Ronnie he will open something and what he opens will get their attention and it will Allure her to the valley oh god brother said look Christ vindicates his word the word of God attracts the bride of Christ so he will Allure her verse 15 and I will give her Vineyards from fence and the valley of acor for a door of hope so you've been in the flood waters you've been overloaded you got to get out there but you need a door you need a door and if you're going to go through the door you got to have strength to get up and walk out of the condition I feel like preaching right now and shall sing there she shall sing there as in the days of her Youth and as in the days when she came up out of the land of Egypt listen in other words what happens is God said I love Israel enough I will give her a place to deal with her sin and I will cover it or I will hide it and I will bring her back to Victory oh young people if he had a Door of Hope are you hearing me are you hearing me do you know what the valley of acor was it was the place that ain's ashes was buried God have mercy it was the place where God had buried the sin that was in the camp but the place where he buried the sin is where he led Israel to tell her there's a Door of Hope in the valley of acor oh God I wish I could say it like I feel it right now young people you're in the valley of acor tonight but get up there's a Door of Hope in the valley of acor there's a revelation of Jesus Christ that has come into your heart it has come into your life if you can rise in faith and believe it you can walk out of that Valley tonight don't you to stand to your feet with [Applause] us I will pursue her I will provide for her I'll give her a bread I'll send a message and that message will get her attention and Thomas by that message I'll open the secrets I'll take their teenagers and reveal to them things that confound theologians I'll take the lowest of class of people and I'll show them the deepest secrets of my word spread a table for the bride I'll raise up an inside and I'll get her attention and I'll just start dropping things in the 40s like Dei is not in heaven it's in you and then I'll come a little bit later and I'll drop a little another handful of purpose and I'll say see it's not law it's Grace and then I'll come a little bit later we're not ination and then I'll have my servant tell them why we don't believe in Lord organized religion and then I'll help them all understand what happened in the garden in 58 I'll have him preach the serpent seat and then we'll get over there in the 60s and I'll have him preach the revelation of Jesus Christ and we'll go over in 62 and I'll have him stand there and preach things like the absolute and presuming and stature of a perfect man having preached those things and then I'll get over there in about 63 and I'll start opening the first seal and the second seal in the is that okay and I will Allure her her I will lure her to a place and then I'll get over in 64 brother Donnie and I'll say this I'll drop a heavy one on them the Mighty God is now unveiled and she'll feed on that one for years then I'll get over in 65 and I'll drop a big one on who is MDC I'll Allure her up there to about mid 65 and I'll preach the Easter seal and tell them about quickening power that's in their bones they'll never never leave him and then I'll lead him over there about 65 latter part of 65 and I'll lead my servant down to a meeting in in streetport Louisiana and I'll put some Pentecostal preachers there who are walking in a way that seeth right about predestination and I'll try to shut that I'll try they'll try to shut him up shut him down and tell him he can't preach but I'll confuse them and they won't even get the right hotel number they won't be able to find him because he's going to walk to a pull pit and here's what he's going to do he's going to give them the biggest piece of bread they've had yet you're the sinless Spotless bride of Jesus Christ you never even done it in the first place and then I'll lure him over there to Yuma Arizona and I'll have him stand up there and say Here's the revelation of the Rapture and then I'll say this you were with him in the beginning that's why you're with him now can I say this to you tonight young people God is in this building I'm not a crazy man I'm looking at Zion and I am beholding the habitation and the Lord has pursued it he's pursued you with Grace do you love him tonight won't we bow our hearts [Music] together I I will exalt her I will satisfy her poror with bread I will clothe her enemies with shame I not a man I the Lord I will lure
