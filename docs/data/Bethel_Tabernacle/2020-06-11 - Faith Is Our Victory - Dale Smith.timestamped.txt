[38:41] first John chapter five and verse wait a
[38:48] minute I'm sorry oh that's why they're
[38:54] now they oh now it's looking a lot
[38:57] better let's go to verse three that's
[39:00] why it says verse three right there on
[39:02] that page and I was looking at the wrong
[39:05] thing here yes first John five and verse
[39:11] three and four there we go now things
[39:13] are starting to come together
[39:15] for this is the love of God that we keep
[39:18] his Commandments and His commandments
[39:19] are not Grievous for whatsoever is born
[39:23] of God overcometh the world and this is
[39:27] the victory that overcometh the world
[39:30] even our faith may the Lord bless the
[39:34] reading of the word this evening as you
[39:36] have your seats
[39:39] levan preach this message called faith
[39:42] is our victory and our faith is the
[39:46] victory and I will make that the title
[39:51] this evening faith is our victory
[39:55] several things that we want to call to
[39:58] your attention here the first thing is
[40:03] the there's a grammatical definition of
[40:08] of a grammar within language and it is
[40:14] called a meta nanami and a meta Nanami
[40:17] what it is is where they use a word in
[40:22] place of another word and so if the
[40:26] dictionary example that they give us is
[40:30] if I was to say that there's a man that
[40:32] works at an office complex down here and
[40:35] I would say yeah he's one of those suits
[40:37] down there we call him a suit well a
[40:40] suit is a meta nanami for a businessman
[40:44] or if we were going to go to the track
[40:47] well track as a meta nanami for we're
[40:50] going to the horse races
[40:52] you understand or NASCAR whatever so
[40:55] you're using that word track the word
[40:57] faith that is used here in the Bible
[41:00] inch inverse form is as even our faith
[41:03] faith here is a meta Nanami and that
[41:06] meta Nanami stands for our belief it
[41:10] stands for the message it stands for the
[41:15] Word of God
[41:16] it stands for victories amen it stands
[41:20] for anything that you want to place in
[41:23] there and it references several things
[41:27] that I wanted to look at here there are
[41:32] faith it represents our belief it
[41:36] represents the gospel it represents the
[41:39] word it represents the message of the
[41:42] hour and so now then so when we look at
[41:45] this Bible verse here that says that
[41:48] that hour that that this is the victory
[41:52] that overcometh the world even our
[41:57] belief even the message of the hour
[42:00] because without this faith it is
[42:05] impossible to please God without this
[42:08] faith amen you are your your absent from
[42:12] the love of God for for because faith
[42:14] amen is what spreads that love of God in
[42:18] our heart by the Holy Ghost faith is a
[42:21] revelation for them tells us and so we
[42:23] find that when God reveals his will to
[42:27] you because faith was designed to know
[42:30] the will of God amen and the will of God
[42:33] is his word and so when God reveals
[42:36] something to him then you can stand on
[42:39] that it's the immovable aim every man
[42:42] said the Rock of Gibraltar
[42:44] was a great stone that was a it was a as
[42:48] a great monument of a great a great rock
[42:52] that was immovable he said by the said
[42:55] the rock of Revelation is even more
[42:58] unmovable than the Rock of Gibraltar
[43:00] hallelujah so where
[43:04] so when we begin to look at this faith
[43:07] and we want to just follow these some
[43:13] quotes that I have here and we're just
[43:16] going to hit these quotes as quickly as
[43:18] possible make a few comments and move on
[43:19] I have a lot of like little one-liners
[43:22] here that the Prophet gave us that are
[43:25] there you know sometimes you just need
[43:27] that one of those little little by
[43:30] little verses would call it but those
[43:32] little verses out of the book of Elisha
[43:34] Amen that you can just call on that and
[43:36] and you know that God will back it up
[43:39] because he backed up his prophet is that
[43:40] right but them says he's our refuge and
[43:44] while you're in this refuge you got
[43:49] right to anything that's in the refuge
[43:53] and so we go back and we find in the
[43:55] Bible tells us that there was six cities
[43:58] of refuge I believe it was and that
[44:00] these cities of refuge was a place for
[44:02] the man to run into when he was running
[44:05] from the manslayer and so if he had
[44:08] accidentally killed somebody or
[44:10] accidentally it'll cause bodily harm he
[44:13] could run to one of these cities if it
[44:15] was an accident
[44:16] and so it was it was graced to him once
[44:20] he entered into the city of refuge but
[44:23] once he got there he would be an alien
[44:25] he would be and not maybe not a resident
[44:27] there but once he got there then once he
[44:30] come through that gate and it shut
[44:32] behind him the manslayer was outside he
[44:35] was inside brother and said he can let
[44:38] off the pressure huh hey man hey what's
[44:40] he got in there he can let off the
[44:41] pressure and he says everything that was
[44:44] in that city of refuge now became his he
[44:48] said Christ is our refuge and everything
[44:52] you have need of is in him amen in
[44:55] sickness don't build up pressure let off
[44:58] pressure well I wonder brother branham
[45:01] you don't wonder you just let the
[45:04] pressure off commit your case to God and
[45:07] go on as if it was all over
[45:12] you say well is that like positive
[45:15] thinking is that is that apple pie in
[45:17] the sky is that a pipe dream is that
[45:20] there's an arrow amen
[45:21] here's it's not pretend friends it's
[45:24] faith in action because phase without
[45:28] works is dead and so you have to commit
[45:32] your way to God and go on as if it was
[45:35] all over don't build up pressure let off
[45:39] pressure I'm so worried brother
[45:41] Bannerman
[45:42] I just don't know let off the pressure
[45:45] in the city of refuge he took your worry
[45:49] so you don't have to have it cast your
[45:52] cares on him for he careth for you don't
[45:56] you worry about your cares all but man I
[46:00] got this problem and I got this business
[46:02] and and you know and and and this komen
[46:04] thing going it's breaking down the
[46:06] litter there the infrastructure and now
[46:08] with all these riots and now we got this
[46:09] this situation in that situation oh I'm
[46:12] so worried I don't even know if there's
[46:14] gonna be an economy I don't even know if
[46:15] there's going to be a tomorrow
[46:16] hey man don't worry about it what will
[46:20] wearing do for you Lee said he said well
[46:24] my faith he said what will faith do
[46:26] before he said what will fear do for me
[46:28] he said if they was going to execute me
[46:31] tomorrow he said what good would fair
[46:32] fear do me he said but faith might give
[46:35] me out don't worry about it watch I'll
[46:43] save this for the last that's the don't
[46:47] worry about it that's his business
[46:51] that's his business oh it's God's
[46:57] business to worry about your worries
[46:58] it's God's business to worry about your
[47:01] cares and he don't worry he don't fear
[47:05] he don't fret he don't slumber he'll
[47:07] sleep hallelujah from authority of God's
[47:15] Word just go like you've never had
[47:22] nothing wrong with you just bless God
[47:26] and be thankful just go active never had
[47:30] to can you imagine
[47:31] I believe our doctor here could tell us
[47:35] that people that accept or that fear the
[47:41] disease that usually overtakes from but
[47:45] the people who commit it to God and go
[47:48] on and keep a positive attitude many
[47:50] times just a positive attitude will get
[47:53] them past the sickness because the body
[47:56] is designed to heal itself or that God
[47:59] will allow the body and then God does
[48:02] the healing but remember said at the
[48:05] right mental attitude towards any
[48:07] promise of God will bring it to pass so
[48:10] if you if you had the mental attitude
[48:12] that you never had nothing wrong with
[48:16] you can you imagine oh well the doctor
[48:21] said this so the doctor said that or or
[48:24] or the you know my symptoms are this
[48:26] well if you if the Bible says that if
[48:29] you observe lying Vanity's you forsake
[48:32] your own mercy oh but if you can go on
[48:35] and take the Book of Elijah and say
[48:38] nothing's wrong with me maybe say well
[48:40] that would be Ryan
[48:41] they asked brother branham the same
[48:42] question he ate beans and onions and his
[48:45] stomach was all tortilla that's
[48:47] hardening of the stomach lining and then
[48:49] with the male they said you have to live
[48:51] with that is nothing we can do about it
[48:52] he went home he gave some beans and
[48:54] onions I like bold be pretty good a
[48:59] green chili in there
[49:03] the Easterners don't know anything about
[49:05] good food I'm telling you but you take
[49:09] you take it ain't that he's walking down
[49:12] the street they said brother how you
[49:14] doing
[49:14] so I'm healed in Jesus name my stripes
[49:17] I'm healed some healed said oh okay walk
[49:21] down there swallow it back there how you
[49:25] doing on the hill
[49:27] except buddy you're sick no I'm healed
[49:29] because his word says I'm quoting the
[49:33] word just like you had nothing wrong
[49:36] with you
[49:39] the prodigal son over in Luke chapter 15
[49:43] I want to look there if we made
[49:55] by the way sister giant sends her love
[49:57] and greetings and she would have been
[50:00] with me but she had medical procedure
[50:05] today they had to give her a little shot
[50:08] of inflammation or any inflammatory in
[50:12] one knee and then they diagnosed her
[50:16] other knee with a torn meniscus and they
[50:19] scheduled her for a repair on that in
[50:23] August so we're glad to have them talked
[50:31] about having medicine said we appreciate
[50:33] our doctors who said they're a gift from
[50:35] God and so we appreciate our doctor he's
[50:38] he's very conscientious about her pain
[50:40] and so he wants to get that fixed as
[50:42] soon as possible
[50:44] so unfortunately August is as soon as
[50:47] possible I wish it could have been a
[50:49] little sooner but nevertheless so maybe
[50:52] a little towards the end of the year
[50:54] we'll get to come spend a little bit of
[50:55] time but as it is right now we're busy
[51:00] as a one-armed paper hanger in a
[51:03] windstorm that's busy Luke chapter 17 or
[51:15] chapter 15 I'm sorry and yes here we go
[51:24] and so I just want to read here just for
[51:27] a moment and for starting in verse 14
[51:29] and so and when he had spent all there
[51:33] arose a mighty famine in that land and
[51:35] he began to be in want and he went and
[51:39] joined himself to a citizen of that
[51:41] country and he sent him into the fields
[51:44] to feed swine and he would have filled
[51:47] his he would have would fain have filled
[51:49] his belly with the husks that the swine
[51:51] did eat and no man gave unto him now
[51:54] watch this and when he came to himself
[51:56] he said how many hired servants of my
[52:00] father's have bread enough and to spare
[52:03] and I
[52:04] perish with hunger now if you remember
[52:09] brother Abraham Myra actually took this
[52:13] thought when he was here and he was
[52:15] dealing with citizenship and the
[52:18] privilege of citizenship and but yet we
[52:20] find that this man was in a and was
[52:23] joined himself for the man of another
[52:24] country and so so now he had as an alien
[52:29] he had lost all of his native rights and
[52:34] so he was with this man now notice here
[52:38] that this is a Hebrew boy and this
[52:41] Hebrew boy has left his land of his
[52:43] Nativity he has now joined himself from
[52:46] a man of another country who is now has
[52:49] the diet of that country which is so
[52:53] contrary to what this young man was
[52:57] accustomed to because this man's diet
[52:59] was from the pigs that he fed they have
[53:03] no no value other than for consumptions
[53:06] you know and so so we can see here that
[53:11] he was of a different religion he was of
[53:13] a different nation and so they were so
[53:17] but we find here that this boy that this
[53:22] this protocol that he wasn't even eating
[53:25] the diet of the country that he was in
[53:29] but he was eating the diet of the pigs
[53:32] that were in that country he was eating
[53:36] pig food he would have liked to have
[53:38] eaten pig food but that the big they
[53:41] don't share I shared a little quote with
[53:44] my my daughters the other day that if
[53:47] you give to a pig every time he grunts
[53:51] and you give to a child every time it
[53:54] cries you will have a good pig and a
[53:57] spoiled child
[54:01] let that be a lesson but we find that
[54:05] this boy this this boy he was he he came
[54:09] to himself I want to pick up right there
[54:12] from them what the prophet of God says
[54:13] and that's what the church needs to do
[54:19] today that's important night is
[54:24] something that's how you know out there
[54:26] in the misty blue somewhere that's what
[54:28] the church needs to do at the next camp
[54:31] meeting or next year or at watch night
[54:35] on the 1st of the year or that communion
[54:38] service or whenever but no brevet said
[54:41] that's what the church needs to do today
[54:43] it's calm to themselves to realize watch
[54:48] what he says here who is your father for
[54:54] sometimes we act as though we have no
[54:58] Heavenly Father I believe that that's
[55:01] that's the the crux of the other of the
[55:05] situation we can say globally today that
[55:09] the world has rejected God they have
[55:12] turned their back on the only one that
[55:14] can help him and they have acted as
[55:18] though there was no recourse they've
[55:20] acted as know that there was no a
[55:23] Heavenly Father
[55:24] there was no accountability there's
[55:27] nothing there's no responsibility and
[55:29] that God doesn't exist and he's not
[55:31] there but let me tell you God cares God
[55:35] cares about their sin God cares about
[55:37] their their rejection God cares and he
[55:40] has indicted the generation well for the
[55:43] second crucifixion for all oh my this
[55:51] this here's a this is nuclear for all
[55:57] the goodness of Heaven belongs to the
[56:01] church
[56:03] what Brunel said you won't need divine
[56:07] healing in the Millennium you have a
[56:10] glorified body you won't need it so if
[56:14] that be the case but there's that
[56:16] goodness that's in the Millennium that
[56:19] peace that passes all understanding is
[56:22] in the Millennium if there's joy over
[56:24] there that's unsearchable and
[56:26] unspeakable then if the Holy Ghost is an
[56:31] earnest on a life that will never sin a
[56:34] lie a body that will never get sick a
[56:37] mind that will never be troubled over in
[56:40] that world and the Bible says that the
[56:42] Holy Ghost is the earnest oh then we're
[56:46] drawing dividends on a world hallelujah
[56:50] let me tell your friends Haven just make
[56:52] her withdrawal tonight just write a
[56:54] check in Jesus name and put what you
[56:56] need on there and cash it in to the to
[57:00] the Clearing House of God's Word and the
[57:03] abstract Haven the earnest the title the
[57:07] abstract has been paid for that debt has
[57:09] been paid in full and Jesus said it is
[57:12] finished or mine for all the goodness of
[57:19] Heaven belongs to the church divine
[57:22] healing salvation freedom from worry or
[57:24] anything all belongs to the church Jesus
[57:28] died and we inherit all that God has
[57:31] through him heirs of the kingdom rich
[57:37] rich my father is rich in houses and
[57:43] lands oh he holds the wealth of the
[57:48] world Romans chapter 4 and verse 3 just
[57:59] want to get a few of these Bible verses
[58:02] sometimes we get a little bit quote
[58:05] heavy not that I'm afraid of quotes by
[58:08] any stretch of the imagination but I
[58:10] just love it when the Bible and the
[58:13] message just dovetail together
[58:15] and create that that great rainbow of
[58:19] faith for God's believe in children
[58:23] rainbow rainbow Romans rainbow a man
[58:30] Romans chapter 4 and we start at verse 3
[58:36] speaking of Abraham he said for what
[58:39] saith the scripture abraham believed God
[58:42] and it was counted unto him for
[58:44] righteousness now it to him that worketh
[58:46] is the reward not reckoned of grace but
[58:51] of debt but to him that worketh not but
[58:55] believeth on him that justifieth the
[58:58] ungodly his faith is counted as
[59:02] righteousness and so now that what if so
[59:06] his so here's one that believed abraham
[59:08] believed and said of those things and
[59:12] spoke of those things which were not as
[59:15] though they were and is that right and
[59:18] so the angel there the angel the Lord
[59:20] told Abraham you're gonna have a child
[59:22] by Sarah and so he believed it and he
[59:26] asked her said how do you feel sir she
[59:28] said I feel the same said it's all right
[59:30] it's gonna be a greater miracle five
[59:32] years ten years fifteen years later how
[59:34] do you feel Sarah's saying I feel I'm
[59:36] feeling nervous and it's alright you're
[59:38] going to hear we're gonna have a baby
[59:40] today the Lord closed we're gonna have a
[59:42] child and so we find said but just kept
[59:44] getting the pins in the bird I kept
[59:46] saying most people didn't know what bird
[59:48] is you know having knows without saying
[59:52] how many knows what bird is they're all
[59:56] over 60 that's why bird eyes diapers
[1:00:04] write that down so you don't forget it
[1:00:06] next time brother man says that he said
[1:00:08] get the bird I ready what was bird up
[1:00:10] bird I was a brand name I think of cloth
[1:00:14] diapers mostly women going 12 back
[1:00:19] the idea of a cloth diaper oh my
[1:00:22] goodness well but that's what they used
[1:00:26] back in the day and you had to wash them
[1:00:28] out that was a real problem but they
[1:00:32] were reusable so it saved a lot of money
[1:00:38] I'm just speaking by hearsay cuz I've
[1:00:42] never done that my dear wife bless her
[1:00:45] heart and so brother man picks this up
[1:00:50] here and I want to this is interesting
[1:00:55] thought I'm gonna I'm gonna bring right
[1:00:58] here a little abstract but I'll bring it
[1:01:00] back brother branham is talking about
[1:01:04] praying for the letters he says now when
[1:01:09] you get these letters now place the
[1:01:11] little handkerchief on your underneath
[1:01:14] garment so when you've got a prayer
[1:01:16] cloth from from random evangelistic
[1:01:21] association if you wrote in to
[1:01:23] Jeffersonville they would send you an
[1:01:24] envelope and there there would be a
[1:01:26] little card or a letter that would give
[1:01:29] you this little explanation as to what
[1:01:32] you were to do with the prayer cloth
[1:01:35] once you got it and and so then they
[1:01:37] would take it you pin it on your
[1:01:38] underneath garment he said if there's
[1:01:41] any sin in your life ask God to forgive
[1:01:44] you if there's this is not just for
[1:01:49] prayer cloths this is for when you come
[1:01:51] up here and stand this anytime you come
[1:01:53] for prayer anytime you've got a need
[1:01:56] make sure you take the promise get it on
[1:02:01] with your faith if there's any sin in
[1:02:07] your life ask God to forgive you if
[1:02:10] there's anything that you have done
[1:02:12] wrong go make it right what does the
[1:02:16] Bible says and many are sick among you
[1:02:19] and some sleep why because it did not
[1:02:22] discern the Lord's body and they didn't
[1:02:25] go take care of these things and they
[1:02:27] put
[1:02:28] the Lord's Supper is that's just the
[1:02:30] elements that's just representative how
[1:02:34] much more when you come to get anointed
[1:02:37] with all and get prayed for in the hands
[1:02:39] laid on you if you don't haven't done
[1:02:41] this other things first then you're not
[1:02:44] going to get past first base friends if
[1:02:51] you've done anything wrong go make it
[1:02:52] right if your pastor believes in healing
[1:02:55] have in there with you but if there is
[1:02:58] no one no pastor near get some of the
[1:03:01] Christians in the neighborhood in and
[1:03:03] pray and believe now what he says and
[1:03:07] then act as if it's already done I you
[1:03:15] know you think we should have a
[1:03:17] correspondence course or we should have
[1:03:19] some kind of a you know a seminar or
[1:03:21] some kind of a you know some sort of a
[1:03:24] you know two-week revival on how to get
[1:03:27] healed no it's in one paragraph repent
[1:03:32] believe be saved
[1:03:34] repent get right fix everything that's
[1:03:38] in your life nothing between your soul
[1:03:39] and your Savior come and anoint them
[1:03:41] with oil pray the prayer faith and they
[1:03:43] shall recover friends but people won't
[1:03:47] do the first works and so then pride
[1:03:51] stands in the way and now there's
[1:03:53] something between their soul and the
[1:03:54] Savior and now there's no possible way
[1:03:57] for faith to work but brother says if
[1:04:02] you met the requirements we'll get to it
[1:04:04] here in a minute when I want to follow
[1:04:08] that with another quote he said we send
[1:04:11] out handkerchiefs and so forth all over
[1:04:13] the world we'd be glad to send you one
[1:04:15] if you want we've got something here
[1:04:17] tonight to be prayed for and the biggest
[1:04:20] part and the greatest amount of miracles
[1:04:24] that I know of is being done by the mail
[1:04:30] huh why because they got the little
[1:04:33] paper they read it they did what they
[1:04:35] were supposed to they pin the pin on
[1:04:36] brother Branham and pray for it and then
[1:04:39] got healed and it was miracle after
[1:04:41] miracle after miracle
[1:04:43] so is that over is the days of miracles
[1:04:48] past if we preach such heresies as that
[1:04:52] then brother Branham said if we say that
[1:04:54] the days of miracles are past he said
[1:04:57] then that is a seed of discrepancy but
[1:05:01] I'm here to tell your friends that if
[1:05:02] you can believe and obey the scripture
[1:05:05] and follow them in the guidelines of
[1:05:08] God's prophet then the same benefit that
[1:05:11] they got in that day you will get in
[1:05:13] this day and if we ever needed it we
[1:05:17] need it today now that's for the sick
[1:05:29] and afflicted to be pray for now no
[1:05:31] matter what your troubles are what no
[1:05:36] matter what no matter what maybe yours
[1:05:41] is well I got a quote on that - better
[1:05:45] not better not lead you into that one he
[1:05:49] says no matter what your troubles are
[1:05:51] what kind of disease you God how bad off
[1:05:57] you are as he could pretty well covered
[1:05:59] all this I think when you accept Christ
[1:06:03] his word then you call the things which
[1:06:05] are as though they were not if they're
[1:06:08] contrary to God's Word the prayer of
[1:06:12] faith shall save the sick well if God
[1:06:14] said that that settles it then let's put
[1:06:18] our minds our hopes and act as though
[1:06:21] it's already done that's just already
[1:06:25] finished when we accepted Jesus 2,000
[1:06:30] years ago said it's finished your
[1:06:33] healing was finished paid for in full in
[1:06:36] stripes in blood brother Graham said if
[1:06:40] he was standing here tonight Jesus
[1:06:43] Christ in the flesh he could not heal
[1:06:46] you
[1:06:47] he said because he already healed you he
[1:06:51] says by His stripes ye were past tense
[1:06:55] healed already hey man just lay claims
[1:06:58] on the promise that God has already made
[1:07:01] and and believe the Word of God when he
[1:07:04] said it's finished friends he meant it
[1:07:09] but you just get that out of your mind
[1:07:12] that your case is too hard nothing is
[1:07:17] too hard for God oh I love this quote
[1:07:24] may these people come to this meeting
[1:07:27] tonight may they come with such Stern
[1:07:32] determination what stern determination
[1:07:38] you know but I find that a lot of people
[1:07:40] come with with with Chef Boyardee
[1:07:46] determination with noodled determination
[1:07:54] dishrags determination huh wishy washy
[1:07:59] silly putty huh Plato some people who
[1:08:04] are silly putty is silly putty
[1:08:07] determination any old thing yes
[1:08:11] noodle determination way weakest water
[1:08:16] determination well you're not going to
[1:08:18] get anything like that
[1:08:21] but brilliant said may they come with
[1:08:23] such Stern determination that nothing is
[1:08:27] going to bother them no more watch may
[1:08:32] faith be instilled in their hearts look
[1:08:39] I just had to sit there and look at that
[1:08:41] for a good long while I just went and
[1:08:44] got my dictionary instilled this this
[1:08:49] this faith instilled well what you know
[1:08:54] I think we lose something they're just
[1:08:56] you know oh well it's just instilled it
[1:08:58] kind of got wife gone
[1:09:00] you know kind of osmosis kind of a you
[1:09:03] know who's got smeared on somehow I got
[1:09:05] no makeup he said with this Stern
[1:09:08] deterred may it be instilled well I
[1:09:12] wouldn't looked at the thesaurus I
[1:09:14] wanted to get a broader understanding of
[1:09:17] this word instilled it means to implant
[1:09:21] in green impress imprint introduce to
[1:09:26] engender to produce to generate to
[1:09:29] induce inspire or promote to foster or
[1:09:33] to drill into oh let me tell you I would
[1:09:37] determinated faith amen
[1:09:39] so that that faith will be drilled in
[1:09:41] the mind a man had to be instilled into
[1:09:44] me to be induced into me to be produced
[1:09:47] out of me hallelujah Oh glory to God to
[1:09:54] inspire oh could you
[1:09:56] what about inspired faith regulated
[1:10:00] faith revelation belief that the message
[1:10:03] of the hour because become Revelator
[1:10:05] into our souls in this such a way to
[1:10:09] promote to foster to inspire to infuse
[1:10:12] into to inject to indoctrinate or to
[1:10:18] teach I believe that many times that
[1:10:23] that's so perfect the Word of God
[1:10:25] because he said faith cometh by hearing
[1:10:30] hearing by faith the word the message
[1:10:37] hallelujah oh my may faith be in their
[1:10:43] heart instilled in their hearts till the
[1:10:46] devil's of Hell can't shake them no way
[1:10:49] oh my there comes the devil he tries to
[1:10:54] shake me and these kind of things that
[1:10:56] let me tell you the heavens will be
[1:10:59] shaken but that so that those things
[1:11:02] which cannot be shaken will be will
[1:11:07] remain the Bible says hallelujah he says
[1:11:12] we hear the question
[1:11:14] any turns would he find faith he never
[1:11:18] questioned whether he did find
[1:11:19] righteousness or whether he had fine
[1:11:21] Christians but would he find faith when
[1:11:24] he returned now watch was we've heard
[1:11:29] that many times but did you hear this
[1:11:32] part knowing that that would be one
[1:11:35] thing the people would let go on the one
[1:11:39] thing that he was saying that he needed
[1:11:41] to find when he come was faith and
[1:11:43] that's the one thing that people would
[1:11:45] let go on oh but we can have you know we
[1:11:48] can have choirs and we can have music
[1:11:51] and we can have singing and we can have
[1:11:55] organizations and we can have camp
[1:11:57] meetings that we can have prayer lines
[1:11:59] that we can have all these kind of
[1:12:00] things and that's fine and that's good
[1:12:02] and those things gender and and and
[1:12:06] propagate people into an atmosphere but
[1:12:09] faith comes by the word and the word
[1:12:12] must be a revealed word it must be a
[1:12:15] known seasoned word it must be a timely
[1:12:18] message because without them we can't ,
[1:12:20] Moses's message we can't carve a
[1:12:23] Wesley's message we can't even come on
[1:12:25] Pentecost message because we're beyond
[1:12:27] Pentecost hallelu that's right we're
[1:12:31] beyond Pentecost he says this is no
[1:12:33] Pentecostal age this is Friday or you
[1:12:37] say well what about the chronological
[1:12:39] order of the spectrum and the stars and
[1:12:41] all line up no let me tell your friends
[1:12:43] the cedar goes out to the to the end of
[1:12:46] the consummation but there's a bride
[1:12:48] people that are being called out by a
[1:12:51] message and he's establishing their
[1:12:53] hearts and her words are separated from
[1:12:56] the rest of the tommyrot of this world I
[1:13:04] want to bring it to this because brother
[1:13:06] Branham referred to the emphatic die
[1:13:08] Glocke many times brother Branham
[1:13:11] references the die Glocke here he says
[1:13:13] the diagon says rather shall he find Z
[1:13:18] face these things not just a faith but
[1:13:23] the faith what is B faith but it was the
[1:13:26] faith that Jude tells us about beloved
[1:13:29] while I was diligent to write unto you
[1:13:31] concerning the common salvation I found
[1:13:33] it necessary to write unto you
[1:13:34] Amen exhorting you to contend this is
[1:13:37] one place for the man said we should
[1:13:38] contend earnestly for the faith be faith
[1:13:45] which was once delivered to the Saints
[1:13:48] that's the faith that they came out of
[1:13:51] an upper room on that's the faith then
[1:13:53] they said this is that we can't say that
[1:13:58] we can't say this is that Joel's
[1:14:00] prophecy and is it applied now there's a
[1:14:04] part of it that applies but it was
[1:14:06] fulfilled in the day of Pentecost
[1:14:08] but we could say that God said and then
[1:14:11] I'll send you Elijah the Prophet before
[1:14:13] the great and Carol the devil did
[1:14:15] terrible day of the Lord so what the
[1:14:19] Bible says and then he would turn or
[1:14:22] restore or turn the hearts of the
[1:14:24] children back to the Apostolic Faith we
[1:14:27] can say this is that and you'll give the
[1:14:31] same results today that they got on the
[1:14:33] day of Pinnacle when you see and
[1:14:35] recognize and act upon the Word of God
[1:14:37] for your hour if you want to believe
[1:14:44] tonight be of a good cheer it is I be
[1:14:48] not afraid what nothing is going to
[1:14:52] happen but good if you'll just believe
[1:14:54] him but I was talking about in the East
[1:14:58] he says that that when the in the in the
[1:15:01] east when the UM when the when the
[1:15:05] Shepherd was how to herd of sheep and
[1:15:10] I've seen this and and and and the
[1:15:14] Shepherd he just leads out across the
[1:15:19] street cars stop everywhere whole herds
[1:15:24] of sheep walk across the road cars have
[1:15:27] stopped why the Shepherd has the
[1:15:32] right-of-way
[1:15:36] that's the law the Shepherd has the
[1:15:40] right of way and so brother Bram says
[1:15:43] this and that's the way our Shepherd is
[1:15:46] amen he gets the right of way
[1:15:50] brother Brown said you committed to God
[1:15:52] there is no higher appeal he will lead a
[1:15:57] sheep and nothing is going to harm or
[1:16:00] bother them if you know that you have
[1:16:04] met his requirements and you've done all
[1:16:07] that you know to do this is important
[1:16:10] it's repented you know you've pinned a
[1:16:13] little pin on or or by faith sometimes
[1:16:16] you know if we don't have a per clock
[1:16:18] that's not some mandatory thing maybe
[1:16:21] you don't have a per cloth maybe don't
[1:16:23] have one but I can still pin faith to my
[1:16:25] heart and I can still I can still repent
[1:16:29] and I can still make it right and I can
[1:16:31] still do everything brother Brown said
[1:16:33] and then pin that faith to my heart and
[1:16:35] I know that I've met the requirements
[1:16:37] and you've done all that you know to do
[1:16:39] then faith doesn't waver it just sits
[1:16:43] still and thinks positive faith takes
[1:16:47] it's everlasting grip around the Rock of
[1:16:50] Ages and it doesn't move hallelujah Oh
[1:16:55] think about that amen just takes its
[1:16:58] grip around the Rock of Ages
[1:17:08] one thing is sure that's God's word will
[1:17:11] never fail no matter how critical
[1:17:14] critics might criticize it how
[1:17:16] educational might try to explain it away
[1:17:19] how they might do this that or the other
[1:17:21] but it won't stop it one bit it'll just
[1:17:25] happen the same as as John said God's
[1:17:29] able of these stones to rise of Abraham
[1:17:30] God's doing it God's going to do it his
[1:17:35] words are going to be fulfilled in their
[1:17:38] season and nothing is going to stop it
[1:17:44] but he's talking about his word now I'm
[1:17:47] so glad of that how glad I am now watch
[1:17:52] someone that's got an understanding this
[1:17:54] is from perseverant that was from
[1:17:56] uncertain sound I want to show you
[1:17:57] something here someone that's got an
[1:18:01] understanding that God has made his
[1:18:03] promise and something has struck you
[1:18:05] that you believe it that's understanding
[1:18:10] that God's promise is to you so first
[1:18:14] you have to understand I've got a
[1:18:16] situation I've got a need I've got a
[1:18:19] sickness I've got a trouble I've got a
[1:18:21] problem I've got this that or the other
[1:18:23] I see something in the Word of God I
[1:18:27] believe it I've read it in the Word of
[1:18:30] God and I believe or it can accept that
[1:18:33] to be my own personal promise property
[1:18:38] and I hold that gear to my heart I hold
[1:18:41] it there now watch over them says he
[1:18:45] says that's understanding that God's
[1:18:47] promises to you then something is going
[1:18:50] to happen I don't care
[1:18:52] nobody in the world can talk you out of
[1:18:54] it watch what he says you're on your
[1:18:56] road then nothing is going to stop you
[1:19:01] so what did he say about the word he
[1:19:04] said God's going to do it his words are
[1:19:06] going to be fulfilled in their season
[1:19:08] and nothing's going to stop it
[1:19:10] nothing's going to stop the word when
[1:19:12] it's in its season and when you take
[1:19:15] that word that's in
[1:19:16] that season and make it your personal
[1:19:19] property nothing's going to stop you or
[1:19:21] your faith either so you just move out
[1:19:25] in faith say it say it so act like
[1:19:28] nothing ever happened
[1:19:29] press right into it and watch the
[1:19:32] supernatural take place in your life but
[1:19:40] I said that Peter he said see all the
[1:19:43] father's given me will come see they
[1:19:47] believe it they act on it knowing
[1:19:49] nothing is going to hold them no matter
[1:19:54] how much you come in emotion how much
[1:19:57] you do it it won't work until that
[1:20:00] perfect faith has manifested and
[1:20:03] identified itself in you as a substance
[1:20:08] and when it's there there's nothing
[1:20:12] going to shake you from it
[1:20:16] what does it say and faith is the
[1:20:19] substance it's substance faith he said
[1:20:23] it's a sixth sense
[1:20:27] nothing's going to shake your faith from
[1:20:29] it now faith listen what he says about
[1:20:34] faith I've read this here before but I
[1:20:36] really like it
[1:20:37] faith is a conqueror faith is an
[1:20:41] overcomer it isn't a peacemaker
[1:20:49] faith is not a peacemaker well it just
[1:20:53] you know it's part of my my anatomy or
[1:20:56] as part of my genetics and well I'm
[1:20:58] supposed to have these because my mother
[1:21:00] had it and my grandmother had it and so
[1:21:03] now I'm supposed to have hog walk oh no
[1:21:09] faith isn't going to make peace with
[1:21:12] that
[1:21:13] he's not going to accept this I'm gonna
[1:21:16] roll over and take that layin down no
[1:21:19] sir that's gonna stand up gonna put his
[1:21:22] dukes up hey man go poopoo let's get it
[1:21:25] all my faith has got muscles my faith
[1:21:27] has got hair on his chest my faith is
[1:21:30] not gonna back down
[1:21:31] it's Bulldog face I was reading uh you
[1:21:38] know the other day talk about a stubborn
[1:21:41] man an obstinate man he said he said
[1:21:45] that obstinate man was was like a
[1:21:47] bulldog
[1:21:48] he said he'd bite onto something the
[1:21:50] only way you'd get him to turn loose is
[1:21:51] cut his head off that's one stubborn dog
[1:21:55] right there but I want my face to be
[1:21:58] that way I wanted to be an unwavering an
[1:22:02] unmovable it isn't a peacemaker it
[1:22:12] overcomes faith is the victory that
[1:22:15] overcomes the world what does it do what
[1:22:18] is faith it is to conquer conquer and
[1:22:23] victory is the same to conquer means to
[1:22:26] beat down to override to handcuff to

[1:22:55] nose and drag me around to every
[1:22:57] perverted thing you can imagine and it
[1:22:59] had controlled me but then one day a man
[1:23:02] Jesus came and the Templars powers were
[1:23:05] broken amen and now my faith overcomes
