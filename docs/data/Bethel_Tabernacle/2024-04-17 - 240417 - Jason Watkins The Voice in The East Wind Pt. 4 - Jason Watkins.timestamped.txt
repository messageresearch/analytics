[31:47] for forward to that amen I've never had
[31:50] to travel three states to marry
[31:54] somebody so uh it's had to be
[31:58] yeah amen praise the Lord all right
[32:02] Revelation chap 2 and we're going to
[32:05] catch verses 12- 17 the pergami and
[32:10] age now before I read
[32:14] this I want to make just a point before
[32:17] as we go into
[32:19] it you you're going to want to
[32:21] understand
[32:23] that all the messages to all the angels
[32:28] of all the ages a message to each angel
[32:31] of each age does not become
[32:36] true in that age it's just simply a
[32:41] revelation of an eternal truth that had
[32:44] always been
[32:45] true amen so in fact is when you when
[32:50] you read this you're going to find a
[32:53] number of things that look like it would
[32:56] just be applying to this AG but actually
[32:58] brother brandham is going to push it all
[33:00] the way out and particularly the hidden
[33:03] Mana which we've been talking about
[33:05] quite a bit we dealt with it a little
[33:07] bit Sunday and so we want to look at it
[33:11] uh some more this evening but I just
[33:12] want that in your mind lest you think
[33:16] that well whatever was applying here
[33:19] doesn't apply to
[33:20] us you better hope it does you better
[33:24] hope that everything of the lion and of
[33:26] the ox and the man is in the eagle
[33:29] because I'll promise you everything in
[33:30] the White Horse and the red horse and
[33:32] the black horse is in the Pale Horse
[33:34] amen so you're going to need it you know
[33:37] brother Matt and I were in the back and
[33:39] we were talking about I had to ask him
[33:41] have you ever heard of this word and I'm
[33:43] I'm pretty Adept at at at at archaic
[33:46] words because of a lot of the commentary
[33:49] I read are you know Brilliant Minds from
[33:52] yester year but I'd never heard this
[33:55] word uh heterodox I said' Matt you ever
[33:58] heard of heterodox what is heterodox and
[34:01] so I looked at and so I had to look it
[34:03] up and the reason it came came up is
[34:05] because this uh Spurgeon is the editor
[34:08] he's the one who did this Bible and he
[34:11] has his own handwritten note here uh and
[34:15] he's saying right in the middle of the
[34:17] pergami and age he says let none of us
[34:22] imagine that an orthodox Creed can be of
[34:27] any use used to us if we lead a
[34:30] heterodox
[34:32] life so let me just modernize that a
[34:35] little bit there there there's no
[34:38] Doctrine however
[34:40] true and you believe it to be true but
[34:44] if your life doesn't match the word then
[34:48] that Doctrine to you is really a of
[34:51] almost none very limited use gives you
[34:54] some understanding and so if for no
[34:57] other reason reason that you can see
[34:59] that Charles Spurgeon was having to deal
[35:02] with people in
[35:04] churches claiming to be Christians but
[35:07] not living a real Christian lifestyle so
[35:11] that's not a 20th or 21st century
[35:14] problem Spurgeon was dealing with it all
[35:16] the way back here when he was teaching
[35:18] and so so so now that gives you another
[35:21] piece of evidence to see that you know
[35:24] he's the same Christ is the same
[35:26] yesterday today and forever ever and so
[35:29] everything that we're going to read here
[35:30] now has direct not an indirect it has
[35:34] direct application to our lives right
[35:37] now in 2024 all right enough teaching on
[35:42] the scripture before we read the
[35:43] scripture verse 12 and to the angel of
[35:47] the church in pergamus write these
[35:50] things saith he which hath the sharp
[35:52] sword with two edges I Know Thy works
[35:56] and where thou dwellest even where
[35:58] Satan's seed is and thou holdest fast my
[36:02] name and H has not denied my faith even
[36:05] in those days wherein Antipas was my
[36:08] faithful martyr who was slain among you
[36:11] where Satan
[36:13] dwelleth but I have a few things against
[36:15] thee because thou Hast there them that
[36:19] hold the doctrine of balum who taught
[36:22] Balo to cast a stumbling block before
[36:24] the children of Israel to eat things
[36:27] sacri riced unto idols and to commit
[36:30] fornication brother Brandon went right
[36:32] back to the Old Testament in the book of
[36:33] numbers and picked up that story and
[36:36] brought it in one of the most powerful
[36:37] sermons we have in the message verse 15
[36:41] so hast thou also them that hold the
[36:44] doctrine of the nicians which thing I
[36:47] hate repent or else I will come unto
[36:51] thee quickly and will fight against them
[36:54] with the sword of my mouth he that hath
[36:57] an ear is an important verse it's at the
[36:59] end of every age he that hath and
[37:01] there's a reason it is we're going to
[37:03] deal with that in a minute he that hath
[37:05] an ear let him hear what the spirit
[37:09] saith unto the churches to him that
[37:11] overcometh you want to
[37:13] overcome will I give to eat of the
[37:16] Hidden mana and will give him a white
[37:19] stone and in the stone a new name
[37:20] written which no man knoweth saving he
[37:23] that receiveth it now I'm not teaching
[37:26] per se tonight on the
[37:31] pergamano speed on the things that we're
[37:34] dealing with the spirit of balum we're
[37:36] dealing with the nickan thing see we're
[37:38] dealing with Satan seat had a historical
[37:41] meaning back here and brother brandom
[37:43] explains it uh how that adelus III fled
[37:47] Babylon into pergamus but then it moved
[37:51] into Rome and it's never listed in
[37:53] pergamus again never shown to be back
[37:55] there again it's now in Rome s SE is so
[37:59] that part of it is historically
[38:01] referencing an exact frame but the
[38:04] greater principles of it chiefly that
[38:07] one at the end he that hath an ear let
[38:10] him hear what the spirit saith to the
[38:13] churches amen all right let's uh let's
[38:17] pray father we thank you and we're
[38:20] asking now for your Divine unction Lord
[38:23] upon the word we commit ourselves into
[38:25] your hands Lord my mind now father may
[38:28] you just take over everything let our
[38:30] hearts be pure before you we commit it
[38:33] to you now it's important Lord It's Your
[38:35] word there's nothing more important you
[38:37] value it above your name Lord and so I
[38:39] pray that you will come right now Lord
[38:42] and bring and break the bread of life in
[38:44] these important times we commit it to
[38:46] you in Jesus name amen God bless you can
[38:49] be
[38:56] seated I'm
[38:58] continuing in this series and I debated
[39:01] whether to continue with the title The
[39:03] Voice in the East Wind and I decided to
[39:06] carry on this in this service and again
[39:08] and maybe even a sixth or seventh part
[39:11] we're not sure got a lot of material in
[39:13] front of me that I'm not going to get to
[39:15] tonight but I'm going to tell you
[39:17] something friends we're in a we're in an
[39:19] amazing hour and it's a very trying time
[39:22] that tries The Souls of men we're in a
[39:24] we're in the in the the last of the last
[39:28] age I I've stopped saying you know that
[39:30] we're just at the end time because we're
[39:32] actually at the end of the end time and
[39:35] there are no more ages all seven stars
[39:38] in his right hand have been deployed the
[39:40] bride has her final message amen the
[39:43] next Revival goes to Israel and so we
[39:46] realize that what the bride is waiting
[39:48] for uh is is is a a daily greater and
[39:53] greater and greater manifestation say
[39:56] how long all the way to the body change
[39:59] this is a unique hour as I said to you
[40:02] last Sunday you are living in a very
[40:04] unique hour and I I started to put it up
[40:07] on a PowerPoint and show probably a half
[40:09] a dozen or more things thank you brother
[40:12] Tony that make the hour that we live in
[40:15] unique from all other ages prior to this
[40:20] age and so one of the things that stands
[40:23] out the most is that this is the age
[40:26] where the Saints brother brandham said
[40:29] he says that the Dynamics of this church
[40:32] will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[40:34] that we've worked in a small way he goes
[40:36] on down and goes on he starts talking
[40:38] about he says where that that the the
[40:41] body of Christ that she'll come into
[40:44] such an a a matching image of Christ
[40:47] that he said Saints for hundreds of
[40:49] years and even thousands of years will
[40:52] rise from the graves around the world
[40:56] and we would which are alive and remain
[40:58] shall be changed that's never happened
[41:01] before on a global scale so we realize
[41:05] that we have gone back under under
[41:08] Redemption we've gone back under
[41:10] restoration of the word to where that
[41:13] first age after the death of the
[41:15] Apostles it apexed and began to decline
[41:18] and we have gone back with this message
[41:21] to that point where they began to tip
[41:23] over and decline down and we have now
[41:26] been brought back to that that point and
[41:28] we take it on into a body change amen
[41:31] Lord all right so we read this quote to
[41:34] you so so I think it's necessary then
[41:36] that I carry on with the voice in the
[41:38] East Wind because the East Wind is
[41:40] Judgment we've been teaching on that and
[41:42] so the world is facing its judgment time
[41:47] it's facing Total Insanity it's facing
[41:50] Satan's Eden it's facing where Lucifer
[41:54] himself has been elected by the people
[41:57] to to be the worshiped being of the age
[41:59] he is the God of this evil age all of
[42:03] these things are unprecedented in in the
[42:06] history of the church going all the way
[42:08] back even into the Old Testament so it's
[42:11] a unique hour but you're a unique people
[42:14] and you're you're you're having a unique
[42:16] experience you're having the experience
[42:20] that the disciples wanted to have you're
[42:23] having the experience that they wrote
[42:25] about that Paul wrote about and longed
[42:28] for and John wrote about and different
[42:30] ones and Peter wrote about you're it
[42:32] you're living it you're literally going
[42:34] to be the people the unique people who
[42:38] your Perfection literally will perfect
[42:41] all the saints for 2,000 years prior and
[42:44] bring them out of their graves that's
[42:46] not a small thing
[42:49] sir that's not something little that's
[42:53] large and it looms large Upon Us brother
[42:56] Brandon makes this statement that we
[42:58] read last Sunday where he said this
[43:01] leayer to see in church age is the
[43:03] grandest of of all the church ages
[43:06] because it's the ending of time and the
[43:09] blending of Eternity sister Don I just
[43:11] realized that was you God bless you
[43:13] happy to have you tonight this must be
[43:14] your family God bless you so he says
[43:18] this layer to see and age is the
[43:20] grandest of all the ages because it's
[43:22] the ending of time and the blending of
[43:25] Eternity he said and then in
[43:27] contradistinction he says and then it's
[43:29] the greatest sinful age it's more sin in
[43:32] this age than there's ever been yeah
[43:34] amen and the powers of Satan is many
[43:38] times harder to fight against than it
[43:40] was in any age and that this was in' 63
[43:43] think of what it is now think of what
[43:45] your children are facing I'm going to
[43:47] tell you something parents you can ill
[43:50] afford to not have a home where prayers
[43:53] are prayed where the word of God is
[43:57] shared where the token is on
[44:01] display it's the only thing Satan will
[44:03] fear he doesn't care how right you are
[44:06] in your Doctrine on now he does not care
[44:09] he's not afraid of that he does not care
[44:12] how religious you are he does not care
[44:15] how right you are in your Doctrine he
[44:18] because he has a secret he knows that if
[44:20] you miss that life you won't come up
[44:23] anyway and he'll win in the end see so
[44:27] so we find that it's the greatest sinful
[44:29] age many manytimes more he says uh than
[44:33] in any age uh harder to fight against
[44:35] than it was in any age it's so deceiving
[44:38] this is the great age of deception when
[44:41] Christ said so the two Spirits would be
[44:43] so close in the last days till it would
[44:45] deceive the very elected if it was
[44:47] possible see remember Christ spoke of an
[44:50] elected people for the last day Christ
[44:53] did I'm not here telling you there's an
[44:55] elected people for the last last day
[44:57] Jesus said that see so he says but now
[45:01] watch that he's he's dealing with the
[45:05] spirit that Jesus
[45:07] warned that there would be an elected
[45:10] people and we know that because of his
[45:12] statement that the two Spirits the and
[45:16] and they're vastly
[45:18] different right versus
[45:21] wrong Christ versus Satan you can't get
[45:24] more Polar Opposites than that
[45:27] but now think of the Paradox that they
[45:30] are they are Polar Opposites but yet at
[45:34] the end time very uniquely they come so
[45:38] close that Satan's soul is able to
[45:43] impersonate the true church so close
[45:46] that Jesus said it'll get so close that
[45:49] it would even deceive the elected that's
[45:52] how we know there's elected if it were
[45:55] possible so now we know it's not
[45:56] possible POS but we but we do know it's
[45:59] here and it's now and it's happening in
[46:02] real time and you're it friends and and
[46:05] when the enemy comes in like a flood God
[46:08] raises a standard and that standard has
[46:11] always been his church his body raised
[46:14] up under the power of the inspiration
[46:17] with faith in the word of God and a
[46:19] token on display and that's what causes
[46:21] Devils to howl and
[46:25] faint but Now watch how close this can
[46:28] be and then we're going to look at it in
[46:30] the scriptures because it's an
[46:31] astonishing statement of what he's about
[46:33] to say and if you don't know your Bible
[46:36] it sounds
[46:37] impossible he says here that speaking of
[46:40] what Jesus prophesied there in Matthew's
[46:43] gospel that it would deceive the very
[46:45] elect if it was possible see so remember
[46:50] Christ spoke of an elected people for
[46:52] the last day that it would deceive the
[46:55] very elected if it were POS possible say
[46:57] all right give it to us in brass tax
[47:00] what is this deception give it to us in
[47:04] plain terms thank you for asking it's
[47:07] what a prophet
[47:08] does here it is
[47:12] people and you're going to find out it's
[47:14] actually good
[47:15] people people so
[47:19] live people can live a clean oh yeah
[47:24] holy life
[47:27] not be sinful adulterers drinkers Liars
[47:30] gamblers they can live above that see
[47:33] and he's actually saying they're not
[47:36] sinful they're not adulterers they're
[47:39] not drinkers they're not Liars they're
[47:41] not gamblers they live above that they
[47:43] live a clean holy life and still not
[47:48] with it meaning they don't have the Holy
[47:51] Ghost they're not actually born
[47:54] again now we already know know in case
[47:57] that blows your
[47:59] fuses we already know that the unwise
[48:02] virgin of Matthew 25 who has no oil in
[48:06] her lamp but they but but they have all
[48:11] of those all of that
[48:14] list the Bible shows us that that when
[48:17] in Matthew 25 they're standing before
[48:21] the Judgment the great judgment now we
[48:24] know they're not born again because even
[48:27] though the king calls them
[48:31] righteous and if you go into into the
[48:33] Book of Revelation he actually calls
[48:35] them saints and Saint means Sanctified
[48:40] one so they live these unwise virgin
[48:44] remember don't ever cor try to correlate
[48:47] the unwise Virgin to the Harlot
[48:49] daughters they're not harlots they're
[48:52] virgins under Christ but they're lacking
[48:55] the oil the oil is the Holy Ghost they
[48:57] don't they're not actually bornn again
[48:59] and the pro we know that because that
[49:02] they're standing in Matthew 25 before
[49:04] the great judgment but in St John
[49:08] 5:24 Jesus had already promised uh
[49:12] brother um I'm sorry sister Esther
[49:14] sister Esther uh give me St John 5:24 I
[49:18] thought brother Mark I about to say
[49:19] brother Mark it's definitely not brother
[49:23] Mark amen sister eser St John 52 24 so
[49:28] we we're going to find that St John 5:24
[49:32] don't read ahead of me we'll read it
[49:33] together but you're going to see that it
[49:35] promises that no person who has passed
[49:39] from Death to life will ever be standing
[49:42] at that great
[49:44] judgment he says here he says verily
[49:47] verily truly truly I say unto you he
[49:49] that heareth my word and believeth on
[49:50] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[49:53] and shall not come into condemnation but
[49:57] is passed from Death To Life
[49:59] condemnation another Greek word for that
[50:00] is the Judgment you'll never stand the
[50:04] the the the and I don't have time to
[50:05] teach on it tonight but the Bible is
[50:07] replete with evidence that the the bride
[50:10] or as the Apostle like calling her the
[50:13] elect lady she is seated with Christ on
[50:17] the throne
[50:18] judging the Nations the Angels the the
[50:22] the the populations of the world she's
[50:24] not being judged because
[50:27] her sins went ahead of her to judgment
[50:29] in Christ so that by the time she
[50:32] arrives she's already been judged in
[50:35] Christ found innocent and she has a
[50:37] reserved seat on the
[50:38] throne it what you don't want to be
[50:41] guilty of is letting your sins follow
[50:43] you there see so it becomes very clear
[50:48] that these righteous Saints who are
[50:51] being judged have lived a holy life
[50:55] lived above sin were not adulterers
[50:58] drinkers or gamblers or Liars but yet
[51:00] they were not born again if they had
[51:03] been St John 5:24 guarantees they would
[51:07] not have stood in the Judgment see so
[51:11] it's clear that there that there's more
[51:14] to the New Birth than even a Holiness
[51:19] lifestyle imagine if you're a nominal
[51:21] Christian who doesn't even have that
[51:26] amen I mean Peter taught us in in one of
[51:29] his letters that if the righteous is
[51:31] scarcely saved where will the ungodly
[51:33] stand the foolish virgin are called
[51:35] righteous people if the righteous are
[51:38] scarcely saved where will the ungodly
[51:41] and The Sinner stand see so we already
[51:45] know and we can prove by the Bible that
[51:47] the unwise Virgin with no oil has all of
[51:52] these characteristics of Holiness we
[51:54] already know and we proved by the Bible
[51:57] that the real New
[51:59] Birth is a revelation of Faith given by
[52:04] God to an
[52:06] individual you certainly can't birth
[52:09] yourself again Nicodemus knew that he
[52:13] knew enough to know he couldn't do that
[52:15] and and and so we realize and I want to
[52:18] say it again we know we're going to
[52:20] prove it by the Bible that the real New
[52:24] Birth why is it how is it possible that
[52:28] those unwise virgins who believed on
[52:31] Christ and lived holy lifestyle and
[52:34] lived above sin and didn't drink or
[52:37] smoke or cuss or crous or run around and
[52:39] and have all kinds of vulgarity how is
[52:42] it that they they were trusting in
[52:44] Christ but they weren't born again be
[52:46] you're going to find out that to be born
[52:49] again requires more than just a mental
[52:52] acceptance of Jesus Christ it's got to
[52:55] have something happen in your heart and
[52:58] that's the mercy and grace of God that
[53:00] can do that for you if you'll let him he
[53:03] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[53:07] spirit saith to the
[53:10] churches so so we we find then that that
[53:14] we can prove it here that the real New
[53:17] Birth is a revelation of Faith that's
[53:19] given by God to an individual it's God's
[53:22] unmerited favor it's not a Whimsical
[53:25] decision made by a
[53:28] person someone decided to they wanted to
[53:31] go to heaven so they turned over a new
[53:32] Leaf joined a church and became a better
[53:34] person I'm all for you joining a church
[53:37] and becoming a better person The unwise
[53:40] Virgins are better persons but I I'm
[53:43] looking for more than that I'm looking
[53:46] for a body change I'm looking for a
[53:48] token to be on
[53:51] display remember friends it's God's
[53:55] unmar favor say I thought it's free
[53:58] correct which means you can't steal it
[54:01] it has to be given to
[54:04] you John
[54:06] 146 we're going to find out sister
[54:09] Esther John
[54:10] 146 we'll read it together uh I just
[54:13] have one the latter portion of it that I
[54:15] want to concentrate on but we'll give
[54:17] you the whole thing here uh Jesus saith
[54:19] unto him I am the way the truth the life
[54:22] watch this no man cometh unto the father
[54:26] but by me that's it you're never going
[54:30] to have peace with God except through
[54:33] Christ be a better person do whatever
[54:36] you want to do but you've got to be born
[54:39] again by the life the indwelling life of
[54:42] Christ no man cometh unto the father but
[54:46] by me so this is the first uh of many
[54:51] pieces of evidence that we're going to
[54:54] look at to show that you can't just
[54:57] decide to be born again right you say
[55:00] well I'll just get to God you can't get
[55:02] to God except through Christ that's it
[55:06] job wanted to get to him job said if I
[55:08] just knew where he lived I'd crawl up on
[55:09] his porch and beat on his door but job
[55:13] there was no way for job to do that so
[55:14] God had to come down and talk to job see
[55:18] so in Luke chapter 10 now watch this I'm
[55:20] going to show you another piece of
[55:22] evidence Luke chapter 10 and we're
[55:24] looking at 21 and I believe um 22 uh 21
[55:29] to
[55:30] 22 in that
[55:32] hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I
[55:38] thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and
[55:42] Earth that thou Hast what did he
[55:45] do you've hid these things see all right
[55:50] so just just let me stop right there so
[55:53] just hold that uh sister Esther but take
[55:55] it down for for right now
[55:57] so so we're now we're beginning
[56:00] to create a picture to show
[56:05] you that
[56:08] it I'm gonna be born again and go to
[56:11] church and go to heaven first of all you
[56:14] you got to have peace with God and you
[56:15] have no way to do it unless Christ rich
[56:17] in Mercy offers it to you see you say
[56:21] well I I'll just get it on my own you
[56:23] can't because it's been hidden
[56:26] see so so now when we think about Christ
[56:30] in Revelation 2 calling it The Hidden
[56:34] Mana see that's what he called it hidden
[56:39] Mana see Jesus said oh you think Moses
[56:42] gave you that bread he said he didn't he
[56:45] gave you bread but it wasn't the bread
[56:47] you think it was he said because you
[56:49] don't recognize me and I'm actually that
[56:51] bread see and so what what were they
[56:54] refusing they believed Moses law but
[56:56] they're refusing the one Moses wrote
[56:59] about Moses said the Lord will raise up
[57:02] a prophet like me and whoever won't hear
[57:05] him will be
[57:06] destroyed and so and but they came in
[57:08] their traditions and Jesus tried to warn
[57:11] them but you you're sticking with your
[57:13] Traditions you're not seeing the
[57:15] advancement of the light I'm now the
[57:17] light of the
[57:19] world for, 1600 years as Paul would
[57:23] later tell them in the book of Acts 1600
[57:25] years God winked at that ignorance he
[57:27] allowed the blood of bulls and goats and
[57:29] lambs and turtle does but Paul said but
[57:32] now not anymore Christ has come the Lamb
[57:36] of God has been slain the sacrifice has
[57:39] been made and now he requireth it's not
[57:42] he's not trying to talk you into it he
[57:44] now requireth all men to
[57:48] repent and come to the light of the
[57:51] truth for this hour that's what Paul was
[57:53] saying 1600 years of tradition have been
[57:57] now wiped pushed aside and he will no
[57:59] longer honor that see so we so it should
[58:03] not surprise us when Jesus thanks the
[58:07] Father the Lord of Heaven and Earth that
[58:09] he had hid the things so when he so when
[58:12] this same Jesus is talking to John in
[58:16] Revelation Chapter 2 and he says to the
[58:19] Overcomer I will I will give because the
[58:22] only one who can I'll give the hidden
[58:24] Mana what what hidden Mana that that was
[58:27] hid by my father that nobody can get to
[58:30] unless I give it to
[58:31] him see so so that's why he said he that
[58:37] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[58:40] saith unto the churches we're going to
[58:42] come back to our to our scripture there
[58:43] in Luke in a moment but let me just let
[58:45] me just sew this up so so that's why in
[58:48] our text he that ha an ear let him hear
[58:51] what the spirit saith to the churches to
[58:54] him that overcometh will I give to eat
[58:57] of the Hidden Mana he that hath an
[59:00] ear so so who is it who is he that hath
[59:04] an ear the answer to that is very easily
[59:07] in verse 12 and to the angel of the
[59:10] church
[59:12] right see write these things saith he
[59:15] which hath the sharp sword with two
[59:17] edges so whoever is willing to hear the
[59:21] angel sent to the church that's the ones
[59:26] who have an ear to hear and that's the
[59:29] ones who get the hidden mana and that's
[59:31] the ones who are Overcomers and that's
[59:34] the ones who are born again and that's
[59:36] the ones who go in a body
[59:38] change that's the ones who are seated
[59:40] with him on the
[59:42] throne he said that in other ages
[59:45] there's all kinds of benefits when
[59:47] you're willing to have an ear to hear
[59:49] what the spirit said to the say say what
[59:53] it's what he said to the church it's
[59:55] what he said to the angel for the angel
[59:59] to say to the church you say well I'll
[1:00:02] just get a revelation myself I'll just
[1:00:04] believe on Jesus how's that going to
[1:00:06] work for you when the when the mystery
[1:00:09] of Christ is hidden and it's only given
[1:00:11] to the angel how do you how's that going
[1:00:14] to work how do you plan to get there
[1:00:17] when you're not accepting the message of
[1:00:20] the messenger that's sent to the age
[1:00:22] he's the only one given the hidden Mana
[1:00:25] amen to the angel
[1:00:30] singular to the angel
[1:00:33] singular write these
[1:00:36] things so he's the only one given the
[1:00:40] hidden Mana to give to the people so now
[1:00:44] we come back to Luke 10 all right let's
[1:00:45] go back with it sister Esther I thank
[1:00:47] thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth
[1:00:50] that thou has hid these things from the
[1:00:51] wise and prudent and has revealed them
[1:00:53] unto babes even so father for so it
[1:00:57] seemed good in thy sight all things are
[1:01:00] delivered to me of my father and no man
[1:01:04] knoweth who the son is but the father
[1:01:08] and who the father is but the son and he
[1:01:12] to whom the son will reveal
[1:01:18] him so the very
[1:01:21] Revelation that you need for the new
[1:01:24] birth is is the hidden Mana Paul called
[1:01:30] it a hidden
[1:01:32] Mystery that's what Paul called it we'll
[1:01:34] look at that in a second get ready to
[1:01:37] Let's go to Colossians chapter one
[1:01:38] sister rester so let's look at what Paul
[1:01:41] had to say here Paul speaking in
[1:01:43] Colossians chapter 1 verse 26 very first
[1:01:47] thing he calls it this is in his very
[1:01:50] first chapter this is opening volley to
[1:01:52] the Colossians even the mystery which
[1:01:55] hath been hid hid from ages and from
[1:01:59] Generations but now is made manifest to
[1:02:03] his Saints so it's made manifest so it's
[1:02:08] not just knowledge they had an
[1:02:12] experience it's not just knowledge it's
[1:02:15] it was manifest to the Saints this was a
[1:02:18] living breathing experience of the new
[1:02:22] birth it wasn't just the adoption of do
[1:02:26] even true Doctrine it's not just mental
[1:02:28] Ascent or agreement with correct
[1:02:31] teaching the devil don't care how right
[1:02:34] you are in your Doctrine he's not afraid
[1:02:36] of that at all what he's afraid he's not
[1:02:38] afraid of
[1:02:39] Jesus it's the life behind the name
[1:02:44] Jesus that's what he's afraid of that's
[1:02:47] what will move him when you say in the
[1:02:50] name of Jesus the seven sons of ska
[1:02:53] tried to move him by the name we adure
[1:02:55] you by Jesus whom Paul preaches and the
[1:02:57] devil figured okay if they're going to
[1:02:59] engage me intellectually I'm I'm that's
[1:03:01] just my game and he comes right back
[1:03:04] okay Paul I know yeah Jesus I know but I
[1:03:09] don't know who I don't know who you are
[1:03:11] who are you and the Bible says those
[1:03:14] spirit and that man jumped on those
[1:03:15] seven brothers and beat the tar out of
[1:03:17] them stripped them naked and sent them
[1:03:19] running into the
[1:03:21] night he's not afraid sir of the of
[1:03:24] Jesus
[1:03:26] what he's afraid of is that you'll have
[1:03:28] F AI H Hallelujah that's what he's
[1:03:31] afraid of and faith is not mental Faith
[1:03:35] it's a revealed Faith it's a hidden Mana
[1:03:39] it's a mystery of Christ Christ is the
[1:03:42] mystery of God revealed
[1:03:46] revealed see so it's an experience they
[1:03:49] had verse 27 to whom God would make
[1:03:53] known what is the riches of the glory of
[1:03:57] this mystery among the Gentiles which is
[1:04:01] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:04:07] see so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:04:11] the hope of glory you understand so
[1:04:14] you've because you've passed from Death
[1:04:17] to life I I wasn't going to go here
[1:04:20] tonight but sister Esther let's go to
[1:04:22] Romans 8:20 and 21 I believe this is
[1:04:25] just from memory but I believe that's
[1:04:27] that's where it's at let's take a look
[1:04:29] at Romans 8:20 and 21 all right we're
[1:04:32] going to talk about we're talking about
[1:04:35] the baptism of the Holy Ghost being your
[1:04:36] hope hope of glory you've passed from
[1:04:39] Death to life all right for the creature
[1:04:42] yeah here it is for the creature or the
[1:04:45] creation was made subject to vanity not
[1:04:48] willingly but by reason of him who hath
[1:04:53] subjected the same and there's that word
[1:04:55] in hope all right verse
[1:04:58] 21 because the creature itself creation
[1:05:02] itself also shall be delivered from the
[1:05:05] bondage of corruption into the Glorious
[1:05:08] Liberty of the children of God so that's
[1:05:11] why the whole the whole earth is
[1:05:12] groaning waiting for the adoption of the
[1:05:14] sons of God because nature knows it's
[1:05:17] coming back also
[1:05:19] Hallelujah and so so what what is Paul
[1:05:21] trying to say to the Roman Church that
[1:05:23] look that this was the god had this plan
[1:05:27] and and and and it wasn't that Satan
[1:05:30] sucker punched God In the Garden of Eden
[1:05:32] snuck up on on on Elohim and socked him
[1:05:36] it wasn't that Satan you know got away
[1:05:39] with one Satan was the king of all
[1:05:42] puppets and he's still the king of all
[1:05:45] puppets see he's just a a tool in God's
[1:05:49] hands and God allowed that fall to take
[1:05:51] place because how's he ever going to be
[1:05:53] a redeemer if there's nothing lost and
[1:05:55] and how's he ever going to be a Healer
[1:05:57] if there's nothing sick how's he ever
[1:05:58] going to be a savior if there's nothing
[1:06:00] to save how's he going to be a champion
[1:06:03] and Captain and a Buckler and a provider
[1:06:05] and a presence Hallelujah if if we
[1:06:08] weren't coming here to to be in war he
[1:06:10] wouldn't need to be in of those things
[1:06:12] but I'm glad he is cuz I'm here in
[1:06:15] war Hallelujah so it's so it was
[1:06:19] subjected to it you were subjected to it
[1:06:21] this is why this is why brother Brandon
[1:06:24] would say and I I never fail at a
[1:06:26] funeral I just preached a funeral in my
[1:06:28] chaplaincy service recently to a man for
[1:06:31] a man I didn't know and I and I always
[1:06:34] make this statement I said I I always
[1:06:36] tell them I say I heard an oldtime
[1:06:38] preacher from way back in the day
[1:06:39] referring to God's prophet and I say he
[1:06:42] made an astonishing statement that was
[1:06:45] going to shock you to hear a preacher
[1:06:47] make and here's what he
[1:06:50] said God will never condemn a man for
[1:06:54] being a sinner
[1:06:57] sure wait what are you a preacher of the
[1:07:00] Gospel yeah so God will never condemn a
[1:07:03] man for being a sinner no God's too just
[1:07:06] to do that as as brother brandham said
[1:07:08] God will never condemn a man for being a
[1:07:10] sinner because the man was born a sinner
[1:07:13] it's not like he volunteered to do that
[1:07:15] Paul that's Paul's whole point in Romans
[1:07:17] 8 he didn't Vol we were subjected to it
[1:07:19] nature was subjected to it's all the
[1:07:21] plan of God but verse 21 let me have
[1:07:24] verse 21 again sister Esther because the
[1:07:26] creation itself also shall be delivered
[1:07:29] from the bondage of corruption and the
[1:07:31] Glorious Liberty of the children of God
[1:07:33] he was always going to bring it
[1:07:36] back I know I'm born in sin I don't
[1:07:38] really like that but I am but I'm on my
[1:07:41] way back he was all he was never going
[1:07:44] to leave me like this he was always
[1:07:46] going to take me back to
[1:07:49] Perfection
[1:07:52] Hallelujah Christ you the hope of glory
[1:07:56] so I was always coming back to
[1:07:58] Perfection Colossians
[1:08:01] 4:3 let's catch that one real fast you
[1:08:04] good man this we're hustling through
[1:08:06] some Bible verses is that all right you
[1:08:09] love your Bible sir you need to be able
[1:08:11] to prove it I've said to these young
[1:08:12] people to tonight brother Jason's
[1:08:14] proving to you what I've said that you
[1:08:16] don't need to back up on anything this
[1:08:18] message is provable in the scriptures
[1:08:20] there's no other single message more
[1:08:22] provable even anywhere even close to
[1:08:25] being pro
[1:08:26] so we can go scripture to scripture to
[1:08:28] scripture Colossians 4:3 with all
[1:08:31] praying also for us that God would open
[1:08:34] unto us a door of utterance to speak the
[1:08:38] mystery of Christ for which I am also in
[1:08:41] bonds so Christ is the mystery of God
[1:08:45] revealed it's a revelation what is the
[1:08:48] revelation of Christ it's a revelation
[1:08:51] of the word for your day and I see it do
[1:08:57] you see it are you glad that you can see
[1:09:00] it there was nothing you could do to see
[1:09:02] it it's God rich in
[1:09:06] Mercy
[1:09:08] Hallelujah I'm on my way back to
[1:09:10] Perfection because I have believed on
[1:09:13] him whom God hath sent that's the works
[1:09:15] of God how can we do the works of God
[1:09:17] they asked Jesus believe on him whom God
[1:09:20] hath sent see he sent Christ into the
[1:09:23] world and Christ is the word
[1:09:26] I love that that hillbilly logic my it
[1:09:30] just stops theologians dead in their
[1:09:32] tracks there's nothing they can do it
[1:09:34] they can't get around that he just says
[1:09:37] he put his name in Christ he put his
[1:09:40] name in Jesus Jesus said I come in my
[1:09:42] father's name so he put his name in
[1:09:45] Christ that's what he was always going
[1:09:46] to do the Bible prophesied that his name
[1:09:48] would be called
[1:09:50] Emmanuel he would his name would be
[1:09:53] called the Everlasting father
[1:09:56] amen so he put his name in Christ and
[1:09:59] according to John he Christ is his word
[1:10:03] so so there's no way it's it's it's in
[1:10:06] congruous to imagine that you can have a
[1:10:10] historical agreement and belief in a man
[1:10:13] that lived 2,000 years ago walked the
[1:10:15] shores of Galilee went about doing good
[1:10:17] that's the Son of God died to save
[1:10:18] Sinners died to save me that's true
[1:10:20] that's true that's true it's all true it
[1:10:23] really happened he was the son of God he
[1:10:25] did die he God so loved the world he
[1:10:28] gave his only begotten son that
[1:10:29] whosoever would believe in him would not
[1:10:31] perish that's all true but you cannot
[1:10:34] separate that man from this book and you
[1:10:38] can't say I believe in that man but I
[1:10:40] don't believe everything in this book
[1:10:42] that's in Congress that doesn't work
[1:10:45] you'll never find Acceptance in the
[1:10:47] presence of God by denying even one of
[1:10:51] his words
[1:10:55] Romans
[1:10:57] 9 uh 15 and
[1:11:00] 16 see so I I've made the statement that
[1:11:03] it's a revelation of the word that's how
[1:11:06] the new birth
[1:11:07] comes I think I've been proving it to
[1:11:09] you I want to keep going can I it's a
[1:11:11] revelation of the word it's he that hath
[1:11:14] an ear let him hear receive the hidden
[1:11:17] manner receive the mystery of Christ
[1:11:19] what is it it's Christ in you it's the
[1:11:21] new birth it's the Holy Ghost it's on
[1:11:23] display causes you to say Amen to every
[1:11:27] word see Romans 9:15 to16 let's look at
[1:11:31] some
[1:11:32] more for he saith to
[1:11:35] Moses I will have mercy on whom I will
[1:11:38] have mercy and I will have compassion on
[1:11:41] whom I will have
[1:11:43] compassion you say oh well that's in the
[1:11:45] Old Testament excuse me we're in the New
[1:11:49] Testament so then Paul says so then it
[1:11:53] is not of him that will willth nor of
[1:11:56] him that runneth but of God that showeth
[1:12:03] Mercy it is God who reveals the hidden
[1:12:06] Mana to you or you don't get it it's God
[1:12:10] who reveals himself as a manifestation
[1:12:13] in your life or you can't have it
[1:12:16] see First Peter chapter
[1:12:20] one amen giving our uh viewer person
[1:12:24] back there work out 1 Peter chap 1 verse
[1:12:28] 23 how are we born again glad you ask
[1:12:32] being born again not of corruptible seed
[1:12:36] but of Incorruptible by the
[1:12:38] what by the word of God which liveth and
[1:12:42] abideth forever is that easy see oh how
[1:12:47] did I get born again oh I decided to get
[1:12:49] born again no you didn't you got born
[1:12:51] again by the word of God see James 118
[1:12:55] let's hit James
[1:12:57] 1118 um of his own will James 1118 wait
[1:13:02] I'll wait on

[1:13:08] own will begot he us of whose
[1:13:12] will his not yours his of his own will
[1:13:18] begot he us with what the word of truth
[1:13:22] how are you begotten by the word of
[1:13:24] Truth that we should be a kind of first
[1:13:28] fruits of his creature so you're The
[1:13:32] Offspring of something
[1:13:34] Eternal you understand you're the off
[1:13:38] why do you say Amen to the word cuz
[1:13:39] you're a part of the
[1:13:41] word why do you love the Lord because
[1:13:43] you're you're part of the family of God
[1:13:45] you always were part of the family of
[1:13:48] God you're you're literally he's
[1:13:50] literally saying of his own will begot
[1:13:52] he us with the word of truth that we
[1:13:55] should be a kind of first fruits of his
[1:13:57] creature I Am The Offspring of a of of
[1:14:00] something that's
[1:14:03] Eternal the ET there's only one thing
[1:14:06] Eternal and that's God and there's only
[1:14:07] that's and that's the word there's only
[1:14:10] one form of eternal life and that's the
[1:14:12] Eternal Word you understand you
[1:14:16] understand see that's the hidden
[1:14:18] Mana that's the mystery of Christ 2
[1:14:22] Thessalonians chapter 2
[1:14:26] and we will catch
[1:14:28] verses um sister Esther let's go verses
[1:14:32] 13 through 15 2 Thessalonians 213
[1:14:36] to15 but we yes but we are
[1:14:40] bound to give thanks always to God for
[1:14:43] you Brethren beloved of the Lord because
[1:14:48] God hath from the beginning chosen you
[1:14:52] to Salvation how how' it come through
[1:14:56] the sanctification of the spirit and
[1:14:59] belief of the
[1:15:02] truth I mean how this isn't this isn't
[1:15:04] rocket science so look at it again but
[1:15:07] we are bound to give thanks all give
[1:15:09] thanks always to God for you Brethren
[1:15:11] beloved of the Lord because God hath
[1:15:13] from the beginning chosen you to
[1:15:15] Salvation through sanctification of the
[1:15:17] spirit and belief of the truth so so
[1:15:21] belief of the truth entitles you to the
[1:15:23] Holy Ghost when it when it's really a
[1:15:26] revelation and it's a manifestation in
[1:15:28] your life then you're entitled to every
[1:15:31] Redemptive blessing that Christ
[1:15:33] purchased at Calvary wherein to he
[1:15:37] called you by Our Gospel so he Paul is
[1:15:41] saying here we until he called you by
[1:15:43] Our Gospel so why why because from the
[1:15:46] beginning you were chosen to Salvation
[1:15:50] by believing the truth and so Paul is
[1:15:54] simply knowing here that his gospel was
[1:15:57] the truth that his gospel was as Eternal
[1:16:01] as God was
[1:16:03] eternal that's how Paul can so boldly
[1:16:06] make this statement see wherein to he
[1:16:09] says but we are bound to give thanks
[1:16:11] always to God for you Brethren beloved
[1:16:13] of the Lord because God hath from the
[1:16:15] beginning chosen you to Salvation
[1:16:17] through the sanctification of the spirit
[1:16:19] and belief of the truth wherein to he
[1:16:22] called you by Our Gospel see to to to
[1:16:25] what end to the obtaining of the glory
[1:16:29] of our Lord Jesus Christ therefore he
[1:16:32] says verse 15 therefore Brethren Stand
[1:16:35] Fast and hold the Traditions which ye
[1:16:38] have been taught whether by word or by
[1:16:41] our epistle so it's Eternal
[1:16:45] truth so you don't get to change
[1:16:49] it I'm sorry you you can't 21st centuri
[1:16:54] eyes
[1:16:56] the
[1:16:56] word there's no there's no biblical
[1:16:59] concept called Truth
[1:17:02] light than Jesus there's no yeah there's
[1:17:05] no message light there's no Gospel Light
[1:17:08] there's no 21st century watered down you
[1:17:11] can't move the ancient
[1:17:13] landmarks that because it's an eternal
[1:17:16] word you're not even going to try to do
[1:17:18] that if you're born again by the Eternal
[1:17:21] Word see so you don't get to change it
[1:17:24] because it's an eternal truth it's an
[1:17:26] eternal Mana it's a hidden Mana it's a
[1:17:29] revealed Mana the bread from
[1:17:33] Heaven all right now last time let's uh
[1:17:38] let's uh let's have Luke 12:55 we'll
[1:17:41] just read it right quick we've read this
[1:17:43] in the previous sessions all I'm that
[1:17:46] clock is my enemy I'm racing right so I
[1:17:49] want to stop in six minutes I won't make
[1:17:51] it but I want
[1:17:53] to but but I'm going to get
[1:17:56] close amen so Luke 12 and uh
[1:18:03] 54-56 so Jesus here is reasoning with
[1:18:07] these religious leaders of his
[1:18:09] day and verse 54 and he said also to the
[1:18:14] people when you see a cloud rise out of
[1:18:16] the
[1:18:17] West straightway you say there cometh a
[1:18:21] shower so it is and when you see the
[1:18:24] south wind blow you say there will be
[1:18:27] heat and it cometh to pass see and Jesus
[1:18:31] now they just passed the test and Jesus
[1:18:33] is about to call them
[1:18:35] Hypocrites because he's about to make a
[1:18:37] very obvious point he says you
[1:18:40] Hypocrites you can discern we're going
[1:18:43] to look at that word you can discern the
[1:18:46] face of the sky and of the Earth but how
[1:18:50] is it that you do not discern this time
[1:18:55] you're so good at watching the weather
[1:18:58] and reading the almanac you're so good
[1:19:00] at understanding nature but how is it
[1:19:04] that you got so much wisdom that you can
[1:19:06] read the face of the sky and the face of
[1:19:08] the Earth no small feet and yet here is
[1:19:12] the word made flesh standing in front of
[1:19:14] you and you don't even know your hour
[1:19:16] you don't even know that I'm the one
[1:19:18] Moses spoke of and that to reject me is
[1:19:22] a death sentence see and so this word
[1:19:26] discern so they're they're not able to
[1:19:29] discern the time I'm not going to give
[1:19:31] you the Greek words nor a lengthy
[1:19:33] breakdown we're not here for that
[1:19:35] especially on a
[1:19:36] Wednesday but it it this word discern
[1:19:40] that Jesus is using it and there's a
[1:19:43] several derivatives some synonyms and an
[1:19:45] antonym that we'll catch so it's it
[1:19:48] literally comes from a a h it's it's a
[1:19:51] compound word made up and comes from
[1:19:53] another Greek word that means
[1:19:56] tested it means approved it means to try
[1:20:00] to try something to prove something to
[1:20:03] discern something to
[1:20:05] distinguish so you can see that not
[1:20:08] everything laying here is the same
[1:20:11] because that's the
[1:20:12] prevailing amalgamation under
[1:20:15] Christianity Today under the 21st
[1:20:17] century we're all Christians we're all
[1:20:19] the same and you what you do have is you
[1:20:24] do have them all grouped together Under
[1:20:28] The Binding of the tears yes they are
[1:20:30] the same they're all getting Bound for
[1:20:34] the
[1:20:35] burning but they're not the same as the
[1:20:38] wheat that are going to the
[1:20:41] Garner but the prophecy is that first
[1:20:44] you bind the tears and that's what's
[1:20:46] happening now and that's what's going to
[1:20:48] happen in the tribulation but that's not
[1:20:50] the gar that's not the wheat headed to
[1:20:52] the Garner they're not the same I am not
[1:20:55] among the
[1:20:57] tears I don't want to
[1:20:59] be I love righteousness and Holiness I
[1:21:05] love Faith I love the revealed
[1:21:09] word around I drink it I eat it I think
[1:21:13] it I live it
[1:21:15] Hallelujah see so I'm able to to try it
[1:21:20] to distinguish it to approve yeah Jesus
[1:21:24] is saying you can discern the nature but
[1:21:27] you you approve of that but you you
[1:21:30] don't approve of what's Happening you
[1:21:31] you're not able to prove anything it has
[1:21:34] it has the notion of proving a thing
[1:21:36] whether it is worthy or not
[1:21:40] metaphorically to it means to make a
[1:21:42] trial of or to put to the proof or to
[1:21:47] examine by implication to examine and
[1:21:51] judge and this is this is where they
[1:21:54] were failing because they were in their
[1:21:57] assessment and in their judgment of him
[1:22:00] who was the word who was the Prince of
[1:22:02] Life their final Judgment of him was he
[1:22:05] is
[1:22:07] Beelzebub he's the prince of devils and
[1:22:09] that's how he does these Miracles H you
[1:22:12] know when when they stood before Pilate
[1:22:16] and and they said he must be crucified
[1:22:18] what why I find no fault in he's a
[1:22:21] blasphemer now they couldn't
[1:22:23] substantiate that in in the Bible just
[1:22:26] like critics today they try to
[1:22:27] substantiate criticism of the message of
[1:22:30] the hour there's no way to do it in the
[1:22:31] scriptures right I've challenged them
[1:22:33] around the world they're a bunch of
[1:22:34] scared chickens have no interest at all
[1:22:37] I've tried to even Bait them to my shame
[1:22:39] I've tried to do I shouldn't do
[1:22:41] that but but but they they have no
[1:22:45] answers at all and they won't face me
[1:22:47] and I've tried to get them to face me
[1:22:49] and then they write letters some open
[1:22:50] letter to me went around the world
[1:22:52] somebody said you know there's an open
[1:22:53] letter to you I said yes I heard you
[1:22:55] read it no don't
[1:22:56] care you know they under they understand
[1:22:59] I we brother Burley preached uh at our
[1:23:02] youth camp about three years ago first
[1:23:05] one was that three years ago and uh he
[1:23:08] told the eagle story and and showed what
[1:23:11] we all know about eagles and how you
[1:23:13] know and how eagles nurture their young
[1:23:15] and carry them on their wings and and
[1:23:16] different things like that and brother
[1:23:17] Brandon was an eye witness of it in the
[1:23:19] wilderness said I saw that mother she
[1:23:20] laid her wings out and those little guys
[1:23:22] got hooked their bill in and she lifted
[1:23:23] them up with all them went right into
[1:23:25] that back into the cliff so we know it
[1:23:27] does it and so you know I had uh some
[1:23:31] deception team
[1:23:34] notice and and you know we we want you
[1:23:37] to uh to correct Burley Williams and I
[1:23:41] said okay who are you we're the
[1:23:42] deception team notice okay well who's
[1:23:44] that well we're not going to tell you

[1:24:29] well then I as soon as you give me your
[1:24:31] credentials and tell me who you are then
[1:24:33] I'll give you my evidence that B that
[1:24:35] brly Williams was correct and they they
[1:24:38] keep writing me letters for three years
[1:24:39] and I just keep sending the same one
[1:24:42] send me who you are send me your
[1:24:43] credentials so that I can know who you
[1:24:45] are and you're not an idiot and and this
[1:24:49] has been going on they just wrote me

[1:24:52] short answer silence that's the most one
[1:24:54] debie said just give them silence people
[1:24:56] hate that they do man they do wow women
[1:24:59] are good I mean they're not never
[1:25:05] mind so sorry sweetheart so so we we
[1:25:10] find that that and and I went on and
[1:25:14] they don't know it but I and I'm a
[1:25:16] researcher it's what I do and I went on
[1:25:19] I went to the Smithsonian I went to
[1:25:20] zoology websites I have I have long
[1:25:24] lengthy quote quotes from the
[1:25:26] Smithsonian I have men who have been
[1:25:29] world renowned uh the people who who do
[1:25:32] that kind of thing who watch birds and
[1:25:35] uh it's not just a birer but they're
[1:25:37] actually like a scientist of it and and
[1:25:39] they've been in the Amazon and they've
[1:25:41] been in the rainforest and they've
[1:25:42] they've observed the Western and the the
[1:25:45] Southern Hemisphere and they've went all
[1:25:46] over the world observing Eagles and they
[1:25:48] absolutely do what brother Burley said
[1:25:50] and absolutely do what William brandham
[1:25:52] said but I'm not going to I'm not going
[1:25:53] to s it to them I've got a whole a whole
[1:25:56] PDF Pages thick with with citations
[1:26:00] ready to go all they got to do is tell
[1:26:01] me who they
[1:26:03] are and they won't so I
[1:26:05] won't I have no plans to and they they
[1:26:09] can they can send me emails till the
[1:26:10] cows come home and the as how's brother
[1:26:13] Gerald H say till the cows come home and
[1:26:16] the calvs cry for
[1:26:18] buttermilk they won't get an answer from
[1:26:21] me although I've got a big big answer
[1:26:23] for them
[1:26:25] so so it it comes down now to proving
[1:26:28] something to examine it by implication
[1:26:31] to examine and to judge something and it
[1:26:33] refers to the Book of Malachi in chapter
[1:26:36] 3 now that's very interesting to me
[1:26:39] because there's almost no other book in
[1:26:42] the Bible if you go back and you read
[1:26:44] through Malachi chapter 1 uh chapter 2
[1:26:48] chapter 3 I mean place after place after
[1:26:51] place after place the people have have a
[1:26:54] have a difficult time judging God and
[1:26:58] you'll you'll find this language more
[1:27:00] there than anywhere else in the Bible
[1:27:02] and God will say you know where wherein
[1:27:04] you have said such and such and such and
[1:27:06] such about me and it's not even true
[1:27:09] right well and they'll say well you've
[1:27:11] did this and God was God's in a
[1:27:13] discourse with these people well you
[1:27:16] have said this and this and that but I'm
[1:27:18] here to say this this and the other and
[1:27:21] the whole book is about people who
[1:27:23] cannot deserve turn the mind of God and
[1:27:27] God is saying and and and I should
[1:27:29] probably turn and and read one of my
[1:27:31] favorite passages there but I'll just
[1:27:33] I'll paraphrase it for you they they you
[1:27:36] know that's the one where you know God
[1:27:39] says how will you why will you rob God
[1:27:42] on tithes and offerings you know that
[1:27:43] that's we're familiar with that and they
[1:27:45] say huh how have we robbed God what are
[1:27:47] you talking about I ain't robbed God and
[1:27:48] he said you don't pay your tithes and
[1:27:50] offerings you're robbing God you see the
[1:27:52] disconnect you see that disc connect
[1:27:54] between the people and and he says you
[1:27:57] you say you're a holy righteous people
[1:28:00] yeah we are what what's the problem well
[1:28:03] why is it that you tell all the Sinners
[1:28:07] it's okay God loves you anyway and you
[1:28:09] can just act like that and you'll still
[1:28:10] get to go to
[1:28:13] heaven and God took exception to that he
[1:28:16] didn't like them telling people that he
[1:28:18] told he was going to destroy him for it
[1:28:20] you can read it in the Book of Malachi
[1:28:21] go home and read it it's just four four
[1:28:22] short chapters and so constantly
[1:28:25] constantly they're they're they're
[1:28:28] misjudging God it means it it's a
[1:28:30] synonym of a Greek word to discern as
[1:28:33] Jesus was saying means to investigate
[1:28:35] and it usually means judicially as a as
[1:28:38] an antonym it uses a Greek word which
[1:28:41] means to reject as the result of
[1:28:44] examination and disapproval to do away
[1:28:47] with what has been laid down to make
[1:28:49] void to nullify to disan to deny to
[1:28:52] renounce to reject
[1:28:55] and we've got plenty of that that they
[1:28:58] misjudge the word of God and misjudge
[1:29:01] what God has done in this day and
[1:29:04] disallow it and reject it and feel fine
[1:29:07] doing it good luck with that I'm here to
[1:29:09] tell you I my faith is stronger today
[1:29:12] than it's ever
[1:29:14] been so in Luke 12 Jesus foretells of a
[1:29:17] fatal flaw in their comprehension that
[1:29:21] would ultimately Doom them that that's
[1:29:24] the sad part of it ultimately this isn't
[1:29:27] some small thing if you don't hear what
[1:29:30] the spirit is saying to the churches
[1:29:33] it's going to Doom you and so you know
[1:29:36] they they would they would literally
[1:29:37] falsely judge Christ from envy and they
[1:29:41] would crucify him and then you know what
[1:29:42] happens then you see the same devil
[1:29:45] because then in the book of Acts they
[1:29:47] turn their murderous Envy onto his
[1:29:50] disciples and they and they say oh you
[1:29:52] know this this this Holy Ghost and this
[1:29:55] rushing Mighty Wind they don't even
[1:29:57] realize that God sent that wind to help
[1:30:00] them he sent that wind to give them
[1:30:03] another chance to give them the Holy
[1:30:05] Ghost and and some of them believed it
[1:30:07] Peter preached to them and said you
[1:30:09] crucified him oh what must we do it's
[1:30:12] okay breathe calm down because the Bible
[1:30:15] says in David he won't leave his soul in
[1:30:17] hell so it's all good he rose from the
[1:30:19] dead don't worry you killed him but he
[1:30:21] rose the Lord rose him and now all you
[1:30:24] got to do is repent and be baptized in
[1:30:27] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:30:28] you can receive the same Holy Ghost I
[1:30:31] have I'm here to tell you tonight I
[1:30:33] don't care what your life has been in
[1:30:34] the past you can repent you can be
[1:30:37] baptized you can receive the Holy Ghost
[1:30:39] and you have the same experience I have
[1:30:42] the same experience Paul
[1:30:46] had so they failed to realize that they
[1:30:49] could they could discern the times and
[1:30:51] the seasons that they were in but
[1:30:54] spiritually they're blind see they they
[1:30:57] were not they were not able to access
[1:30:59] anything of Eternal value to say nothing
[1:31:01] of responding correctly to it and Jesus
[1:31:04] warned them Jesus actually warned them
[1:31:08] I'm coming to a close five
[1:31:11] minutes Jesus warned
[1:31:15] them there won't be one stone left upon
[1:31:21] another that doesn't get thrown down
[1:31:26] and by the
[1:31:27] time they caught the Revelation it was
[1:31:30] too late Titus was already storming the
[1:31:34] Gates of
[1:31:35] Jerusalem you know where they ran you
[1:31:37] know what history tells us they ran into
[1:31:39] the
[1:31:40] temple the very Place Jesus said would
[1:31:43] be
[1:31:44] flattened they ran into the very thing
[1:31:46] thinking that if they went into church
[1:31:48] God would save them what they did not
[1:31:51] know that the Old Testament Prophet had
[1:31:53] told them Ezekiel is the shakina left
[1:31:56] that Temple a long time ago and he's not
[1:32:00] coming back until the Millennium he's
[1:32:03] gone he's not in there and they ran in
[1:32:05] there and that's the very thing that
[1:32:07] Armageddon is going to produce people
[1:32:10] running to what they believe is
[1:32:12] salvation and they even say peace and
[1:32:14] safety and then cometh sudden
[1:32:20] destruction they thought God would save
[1:32:22] them he left that Temple a long time ago
[1:32:26] I I said this to a brother in the back
[1:32:30] office and I was going to save it
[1:32:32] for part five we'll get to part five but
[1:32:36] just the Holy Spirit anointing me just
[1:32:38] to say it
[1:32:41] tonight the greatest
[1:32:47] problem in the ranks of the
[1:32:52] message is
[1:32:54] not misunderstood
[1:32:59] Doctrine the great that's a problem
[1:33:03] that's not the greatest problem that's a
[1:33:05] problem but that's not the greatest
[1:33:07] one the greatest problem in the ranks of
[1:33:10] the message is not misunderstood
[1:33:14] Doctrine the greatest problem in the
[1:33:16] ranks of the message and always has been
[1:33:18] in every
[1:33:19] age
[1:33:21] is people living
[1:33:24] among the ranks of the Born
[1:33:28] Again In varying degrees of
[1:33:32] sanctification but not having the
[1:33:35] literal token life
[1:33:40] itself that
[1:33:42] is has always been the greatest problem
[1:33:46] in every
[1:33:49] age
[1:33:51] like but it's people
[1:33:54] who who sit in the ranks of the born
[1:33:58] again and they themselves are not born
[1:34:01] again and they just live in varying
[1:34:05] degrees of
[1:34:08] sanctification and they're they do not
[1:34:11] have the literal Life of Christ
[1:34:17] itself are
[1:34:20] you or or are you not
[1:34:24] willing to come with the unleavened
[1:34:28] bread of
[1:34:31] sincerity preach this
[1:34:33] Sunday the reason that it's so important
[1:34:37] as the unleavened bread means it's not
[1:34:39] mixed Christ was the unleavened bread
[1:34:42] the Passover he was the unleavened bread
[1:34:44] he was the first
[1:34:45] fruits understand those first three
[1:34:48] Feast from Leviticus 23 refer to Christ
[1:34:51] Earthly Ministry the fourth feast Feast
[1:34:54] is the Jubilee the Feast of Pentecost
[1:34:56] and that runs all the way through the
[1:34:58] Gentile age all the way to the Rapture
[1:35:01] and then the fifth Feast sixth Feast
[1:35:03] seventh Feast is all to Israel the
[1:35:06] seventh Feast we find in the is in the
[1:35:10] millenum and
[1:35:12] so the question becomes
[1:35:15] tonight are you or are you not willing
[1:35:19] do you hear the voice in the East Wind
[1:35:22] the East Wind of judgement that is
[1:35:24] coming to this world young people think
[1:35:26] seriously now because it's not coming
[1:35:29] it's
[1:35:30] here we're almost
[1:35:34] home bow your heads with
[1:35:38] me let me just hold the musicians at
[1:35:40] their seats for just a moment give them
[1:35:42] an
[1:35:43] opportunity with all heads
[1:35:47] bowed are
[1:35:50] you or are you not willing
[1:35:54] to come with the unleavened bread of
[1:35:57] sincerity and
[1:36:00] Truth are you or are you not willing to
[1:36:05] cast down from your mind from your mind
[1:36:10] and from your life the old leaven of
[1:36:14] malice and
[1:36:16] wickedness that's what Paul wrote to the

[1:38:54] hearts and honest hands that sat here
[1:38:56] Lord and took a journey Lord that's what
[1:38:59] we did tonight we went on a journey
[1:39:01] through the pages of your word it it it
[1:39:05] if if a preacher's going to make some of
[1:39:07] these statements if a prophet's going to
[1:39:09] make that astonishing statement it's got
[1:39:12] to be provable in the
[1:39:14] Bible Lord and so we wanted tonight to
[1:39:17] come
[1:39:18] unabashedly without any second guessing
[1:39:21] or hesitation we wanted to be able B to
[1:39:23] demonstrate from the Bible that what we
[1:39:27] believe is the
[1:39:28] truth Lord it it when you can believe it
[1:39:31] like that it'll produce the Life of
[1:39:33] Christ every time when you can say Amen
[1:39:36] to every word of God in your life then
[1:39:39] you're that entitles you to the Token in
[1:39:42] this hour what the token is in this hour
[1:39:45] Lord we know is much more than it was in
[1:39:47] the ages because that was a dip and this
[1:39:50] is the
[1:39:51] fullness the token always
[1:39:54] it's always corresponds to the level of
[1:39:58] of the word of the revelation of the
[1:40:00] word for the age and we have come back
[1:40:03] to the full token it's not something new
[1:40:06] it's we've returned back to the
[1:40:09] original that's what that early church
[1:40:11] had they had the token they had the
[1:40:14] abstract title deed they had the full
[1:40:18] Jubilee Lord they had it they had the
[1:40:20] ministry of the son of man they had the
[1:40:22] office in operation of the son of man

[1:40:28] Mrs Jesus of that day and now father you
[1:40:33] have come full circle at the end of the
[1:40:35] seventh age you've brought it all back
[1:40:37] around and you've restored it back to
[1:40:39] its
[1:40:40] original Lord I stand tonight such a
[1:40:45] failure so often Lord in my life I can't
[1:40:48] even explain it to me the failures I
[1:40:51] have much less try to explain it to you
[1:40:53] you but Lord I stand here before these
[1:40:56] people tonight and I confess that I am

[1:41:00] Christ it is the power of God unto
[1:41:03] salvation and I'm a Believer Lord and I
[1:41:06] pray that you will help us tonight Lord
[1:41:08] to bring our lives subject to every word
[1:41:10] of God bring our homes subject to every
[1:41:13] word of God I feel very sad Lord for

[1:41:24] heart for all those who could and were
