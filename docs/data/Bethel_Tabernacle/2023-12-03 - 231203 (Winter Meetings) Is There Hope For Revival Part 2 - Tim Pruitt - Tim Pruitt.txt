and I'm trying to all right keep well brother got me first with a song this morning U my old friend uh Tom Brown he's he's not gone on to be with the Lord but he would request that song and I've had my mind just so much on the Rapture Glen Hallelujah in these meetings I can't tell you just my own personal trial bear with me one second I have said I have all these things too much and I do have a lot of pressure on myself right now and uh it's a total sacrifice just to be here and uh he knows all things than God and there's just in my business there's millions of dollars being decided and consequences that affect me directly that uh I've had pressures on and along with all the trials of life that everyone goes through not to belittle anybody's issue but it just doesn't matter and and he's bought he's brought me other ones I know to a place where you know what the footsteps of the righteous were ordered not requested amen order of the Lord yes sir and so my own personal thought is he's taking all these things of the world not necessarily the the the good things that you enjoy but he's taking all of it and bungling it up and saying you can try and be aart you can try and mold it to your will but it just doesn't matter because our sight is on things above brother brandham preached look look up look up Hallelujah the brass serpent up here here don't look down here look up and

the Lord and you know I I it's not all about me or all about evening light Tabernacle God's got a bride around the world and and I'm interested in you because you know I can I receive the Holy Ghost and you didn't receive it the same day I did but I can't go into Rapture until you do that's right amen amen so I can't go without you and if you're a part then it's in my best interest to see that you're ready to go oh yeah so I have an interest in you and the body of Christ around the world no matter who they are may God bless them as the bride is gathered all the way from the East and the West over in over in Japan the church there is church of the Rising Sun they've already had their service and and uh you know it's they've already posted their pictures of the congregation and they're meeting there and here we are now on the east coast and our services will start here over in Louisiana in another hour and or starting probably about right now and so you know but here there and it will go all the way to the setting of The Sun yes cuz God has the people out of every Kindred tongue Nation tribe and people that's right and it isn't all about me or all about just you it's about him and if I can get you to fall in love with Jesus if nothing else happens but that you just come falling in love with Jesus amen then that would be the goal so let's talk to the Lord just a moment and ask him just to speak to your heart yes our hearts this morning may he may he just come Among Us yes Lord and speak to us today Father we want to thank you Lord for this assembly right here in Buford right way over on the on the East Coast Lord I think the gospel would come to America First out here on the east coast and move Westward oh God in in the in the westly Revival and and and we wound up with all up and down these Coast Church after church after church and populated areas where the gospel is spread and and then the further west we go it seems Lord the more sparse and the fewer there are but Lord we want to thank you for every Lighthouse Lord we want to thank you oh God for everyone that has stood for the word of God May Lord they be increased today not so much in numbers but Lord in increased in faith May Apostolic times be seen among them and Lord your healing and deliverance be theirs we see it Lord but we just want to see more of it Lord and we're just asking God that you'll magnify yourself Among Us those that are sick some of them have the flu or covid that we hear even some back home and some in our midst Lord there's others with with cancer and horrible diseases Lord our our brother Tim has wrote about his wife with with a a great need today Lord we pray that you'll meet that need father heal your people deliver your children undertake for your the sons of God move on the scene let us see Lord today that you're in our midst and that you're the same yesterday today and forever now Lord I can do nothing without you so I'm looking to you Lord to help me today I pray Lord it'll just flow like Sparks from an anvil let it just flow Lord unhindered and you speak to your children in Jesus name amen amen God bless you why don't you turn with me to Matthew chapter 8 and we'll read from verse 23 Matthew 8 and verse 23 and when when he was entered into a ship his disciples followed him and behold there Rose a great Tempest in the sea in so much that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep and his disciples came to him and awoke him saying Lord save us we perish and he said unto them why are you fearful oh ye of little faith then he rose and rebuked the winds and the Sea and there was was a great calm but the men marveled saying what manner of man is this that even the winds and the way the sea obey him and when he was come to the other side into the country of the G genes then there met him two possessed with Devils coming out of the tombs exceeding Fierce so that no man might pass by that way God bless you you can be seated amen thank you very much we appreciate the musicians and all the contribution to the Lord the wonderful singing today and the worship unto the Lord it was is always wonderful Amen to see the Holy Spirit move and the songs and worship and you know we just have to keep pressing the battle with all that we have even when we come to church it's You Know The Enemy will come and try to pull you this side or that side but you have to focus in Amen Let the Holy Spirit speak to you very because he speaking expressly in this hour now today I am I'm actually going to um do a little bit of of um review of yesterday in the ministers meeting and and go from there I wonder how many of you streamed or heard the or was here for the for the ministers meeting raise your hand let me just see all right so there may be a tenth um of the congregation that was that has listened so anyway um you know we we did stream that yesterday for those who wanted to hear but um today as we're looking into the scripture I'm going to I'm going to take a a thought and I really I will recap a few things that I spoke yesterday in the ministers meeting but I will also um go into a lot of more new material today and I'm going to be speaking on is there hope for Revival so that's a question that comes on many hearts today is there hope of Revival and for the ministers that was there this will be part two for you and so I'd also like to take a scripture reading from Matthew chapter 14 and verse 22 and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus uh went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straight way Jesus spake unto them be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt and when they were come into the ship the wind ceased then they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying of Truth Thou Art the Son of God now you know I I spoke to you um on Friday night on you know in an Evangelistic Manner and and brother Timothy has ministered a couple of very marvelous Evangelistic sermons but today we're just going to be laying in the the word of God in a little different format this morning and um talk about the day and hour that we're living in maybe this being Sunday use this as a little Sunday school teacher teaching and also for the ministers that might listen to this maybe to take this maybe a little step further than what we went and maybe to recap some of the things but uh for you for you young people that are here today um and and even some middle age you don't realize the the the great impact of the Revival that is that is taking place in this in this uh past Century oh starting with the zza street and there just was marvelous things that took place it was a true Revival of God and the supernatural worked in great ways and I don't even have time to even talk about their Revival but it was actually um part of the of the former reign in the sense of um preparing the ground softening the ground or preparing it for the planting to come right and so you know it would it would actually get an atmosphere of faith in people's lives where they would start believing in Miracles and Supernatural and and whatever it was preparing them for God to do greater things and so then of course in 1946 there would be the angel of God would come to brother brandom in U and in in the room and there when he he comes it was it came as a light as a pillar of fire about about like this and it was a a whirling fire and there and and then out of that fire stepped a man that was 200 lbs and 6ot tall and and uh had a white robe on and and was standing there there and and looking at him and and said you know that I I've come to explain to you about your misunderstood life and and um and explained to him about his gift that was in his life and what God had planned for us in the end time to prepare us for a time of for the Rapture now of course as you as you know that that spark to Revival um it it began with with just a miraculous beginning to happen one thing after another after another um and and um and it would just it would just grow in volume and then there would be people from everywhere that would come there was there was such a a Zeal that people would come and and lay under um the their trucks or their cars you know they would take a town of couple of thousand people in Jonesburg Arkansas and swell it to 30,000 and there's no accommodations for them so you know they're out there camping under their trucks or their cars or whatever else and coming to the meetings and it was a it was a tremendous time and and um brother Brandon made these comments and and maybe this will help U catch a little bit of glimpse of of what he witnessed he said we just witnessed one of the greatest revivals I've believe that the world has ever seen in this last 10 or 15 years it's been a Revival not just like the days of Billy Sunday or the days of the Welsh Revival the days of wesling Revival or the Moody Revival or Billy Sunday Revival has been a worldwide sweeping Affair around the world and great healing services and great Revival fires has burned practically on every heel there is in the world right tonight AC way over across in the lands of Africa down in China Japan this gospel is being preached and people are being healed right this very minute around and around the world it's been one of the greatest revivals because I believe it's one of the last revivals this world will see a world sweeping Revival but now in these last few years is quen down you you don't notice the enthusiasm in the people that used to be I I remember having the privilege by the Holy Spirit to spearhead that Revival that started when that angel of the Lord appeared on the river and said that about many years ago and to see it happen and see it set ministers hearts of fire and everywhere revivals broke out while you could just simply walk into a building and the people just get up out of their Cs and stretches and walk away healed you didn't have to say one word just being there that's all it taken I remember one night in vandelia Illinois I walked into the meeting and had no longer been in the meeting over five minutes there wasn't a feeble person around the place anywhere wheelchairs pushed out and piled up and blind was seeing and deaf and dumb speaking just simply the spirit of the Lord was present and he just healed the whole group of them but now that's when you can do something when Revival is going but let that Revival fire die down then you can hardly then people are still Christians they're they're not but they're not revived into that spirit that great atmosphere that does something notice that an atmosphere that does something how we must drive to have that atmosphere within our churches it's just like in in a forge in a blacksmith's shop you got to get the iron hot before you go to pounding it on an anvil if you don't you'll never straighten it out and that's what it takes to have a Revival is everybody under the heat of the spirit that's brought down the powers of God and a Revival me moving and there is prayer meetings going every going day and night every minute everywhere why the people wouldn't even leave the grounds and of course you know those meetings would go even brother Bron would try to pray for everybody and the prayer lines got even longer and and after he said I'll pray for everybody in 8 days and 8 night he was there in the prayer lines in Jones on in Jonesboro Arkansas so many things that happened you know dur during that time but brother brandom you know came and he and he and he he proclaimed the end of the isua and Divine Healing Revival and by the end of his ministry um people were simply no longer enthralled wow the the FI had been crowded with every kind of gimmick of the Janice and jambre that had been done remember this is exactly what happened in the first Exodus you know Moses goes out he casts down his his rod and it becomes a serpent well here comes Janice and Jem Brees they cast down their rod and it does it too now you say how did that happen well I'll tell you how that happened by the power of God amen amen amen because Satan can't create Satan can't heal Satan can't do that so but by but there by by using the the the faith and the power of God here they impersonated what Moses did amen but what did it do it was to try to keep them in Egypt yes in bondage not set them at Liberty are you with me so you see this is exactly what had been done there there're rows of hundreds you know there that was impersonating using gimmicks everything else that they could do and um by 1956 brother Brandon prophesied that that year America would reject the gospel and it would begin a spiritual Decline and and then you know he actually and I don't remember what the new title is it used to be called visions and prophecy in 1956 but anyway um brother brandham talks about um that where that he mentions that the Revival is over and I believe that this year that America will either accept or reject the gospel now you have to listen to the tape to get this but when you listen to it after brother brandham says that it just breaks out into pandemonium where that there is speaking in tongues all over the building I mean all I mean hundreds of voices all at one time and unity began to speak in other tongues and and so as it does I just want to remind you now what what happens is here brother Brandon makes his prophecy here tongues break out in unison all over the building I mean hundreds at one time begin to speak in other tongues and brother brandham said U you know about this in the church age book he said now tongues isn't the evidence of Revival it is the evidence of death tongues proclaim the the evidence that the ceremonial religion of the Jews was over and a new era had begun tongues today is ringing down the curtain on the Gentile Church ages and the gospel is going back to the Jews people are talking about tongues heralding in a great spiritual move they have missed the boat the truth is that that it is writing the Finish to all of man's ideas programs and kingdoms and the kingdom of God is being ushered in wake up people of God wake up now of course that that doesn't mean that if you speak in tongues that's the evidence of death no that but all of this going on as it as he said tongues rain down the Gentile Kingdom you know what he's talking about because there in in Daniel when Daniel was there in the Kingdom of of um belzar what what happened a handwriting came on the wall and it was in other tongues yes right amen but it it would take a prophet now to identify what was being said is that right amen so you know it would even be so for us in this last day God said things even in the Book of Revelation in symbols and is wrote in symbols but nobody knows what it means until a prophet comes on the scene there again is written many many Te You Farson what's it mean this guesses that this guesses this this and guess another but when a prophet comes on the scene now the Revelation becomes made known what God had actually said you're weighed in the balance and found wanting now so again he there he would stand in Life Tabernacle in spport Louisiana and preach the invisible Union of the Bride directing his sermon to the church now you know a Life Tabernacle is still exists today it's um moved in its location from where brother Brandon preached but they're now just a little Charismatic Church they got actually a little museum inside uh of a room with paraphernalia of the of the Revival past of crutches and different um items you know and testimonies of people being healed and and things like that you know just a museum a memory of what the Revival used to be are you with me yes amen now so again you know he stood in Life Tabernacle preached the invisible Union of the Bride he directing his sermon to the church the body of Christ and he said believing that the coming of the Lord is at hand and he said much more it's it's 20 years closer than what it was the first time I came to sort that would have been 1946 the beginning of the Revival and so much has happened since that time now we're looking forward for the coming of the Lord in our generation I'm not looking for Revival in our generation I'm looking for the coming of the Lord in our generation so as as we as we look at that for a moment and examine his quote he was not looking for another worldwide Revival this had been declared over now I you know I was there in those meetings and I I will tell you there was still the the the discernment that was still calling out people and their name and their address and so on like that there was there was things that was still happening in the Supernatural realm but the the great the great um move of the spirit that were there were massive healings and deliverance it wasn't there you see the Revival had died down and the expectations of the people were H wow you know you know brother bram's a prophet but you know holding there hey I watched him in invisible Union of the Bride when brother brandham actually was speaking about how that women were living in dressing and men and so on like that in the condition of the world and and women you know poking one another and giggling and laughing at the prophet of God I watch people walk out of the meeting amen amen so you you see there was all kinds of things that that as the the Revival was being turned down you know they would have brother brandham just for the phenomenal of the gift but they didn't want to hear them message so you know he he was saying he said now uh as he said in Albuquerque and God hid himself in Simplicity now you hear me if you believe me to be a messenger sent from Christ to you you believe me if you're not in the kingdom of God you better press right quick it will not get better it will grow worse all the time just Mark that down just remember whether to see whether it's right or wrong you see if it's going to be right or wrong it's it's not going to get better it's going to get worse it's going to get harder all the time the Revival is gone you're only gleaning in the field she's over you say I disagree with that fine it's okay if you do that's all right that's my conviction that's my hearing from heaven and he said what we have entered into the the leoan age where it's lukewarm and God spews her from her mouth and he said you are in the spewing stage so remember we are here in the leoan age the lukewarmness of the lukewarm rather of Le oia is spewed out of the mouth of God for rejecting the Pentecostal message yes this message we have is the Pentecostal message it is the message Paul preached come on now we're not talking about Aus Street don't get confused they they were they were wrongly named Pentecost amen they are they are mislabeled Pentecost they are not Pentecost but they were actually an extension of the man age the eagle hadn't even come are you with me so remember we are in the aloan age where um where they are spewed out of the mouth of God for rejecting the Pentecostal message if if you listen to brother brandham in as he as a seventh angel taking the seventh Church age as he preached it the leoan church age he said you see as Rich have need of nothing but you have need of the greatest thing and haven't got it Jesus standing outside trying to get back in with Pentecost he said what would you think tonight in the Methodist Church and I want you to think message church if the Holy Ghost fell upon the church and they begin shouting and jumping and speaking in tongues and acting like drun bunch of drunk people why the conference would throw that Methodist Church out of the conference what would happen in the Baptist Church that that happen the same thing Pentecostal what there's many of them it's happened the same thing yes sir they wouldn't put they wouldn't put up with that nonsense they'd say wow they've even spoiled our new carpets uhhuh um what a miserable Bunch they are you see now sadly message churches today and I I'm speaking I'm still continues to speak to the ministers I speaking to and the audience not just this one here but you know listen here because whatever you do not want to be caught in a lukewarm condition amen wo amen amen because if so you'll be spew out of the mouth of God you will not speak for him you will not be his representative so sadly today message churches are not immune to this people are getting so hard and are not tens tender and sensitive to the holy spirit that they are absolutely lukewarm about it so brother Bron would tell us in the same sermon of invisible you he said you see she's pregnated with something because she's bringing forth members all the time she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering two acts 238 miserable creatures that she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific Society Church that she belongs to oh yeah amen so she don't want to be pregnated with the word because that's the only kind the word can bring forth that's right so the the church would actually become ashamed of the Pentecostal experience amen now so you see he he even said in the message is shamed he said the Revival amongst the churches is died everybody knows that you feel it in this Tabernacle and I just say you're going to feel it in your church all right amen you're going to feel it everywhere amen there's a thump a dead feeling it's just something that isn't right is because Revival enthusiasm has gone away from the people you go into churches you'll see them sitting there and the pastor stumbling around for a message or something another and the first thing you know he's turned off on some kind of party they're going to have or something it just seem to be a dead thump everywhere but I'm going to tell you friends somebody's going to overcome this amen because even when he said I'm going to spew him out of my mouth he also said him that overcometh so God's going to have Overcomers in this age somebody's going to rise above the lethargic they Osa luk War condition and they're going to have an enthusiasm for this message and a desire to serve God with all of their heart Hallelujah yes sir now many times because of the lack of the spirit men are turning to psychology to put bandaids on sin problems yes are you with me so as he says and the world Fallen apart but the church set spiritually dead gone the hours past them they're in a slump hardly know what to do one running this way one that way and hear every promise that God made in the Bible every one of them is laying there just as good as they ever was it's the hour what makes the church like this it's the we're in the leoan age or the age of Leo deia when she got to come this way so is there hope for Revival is there Revival for the bride or will God just Rapture us in our lukewarm condition that makes him sick no move of the spirit no Spiritual Awakening and that just because that we sit on a message Pew we're just automatically going into Rapture now as he said I'm not looking for Revival in our generation I'm looking for the coming of the Lord now so I want you to understand the bride's Revival is the coming of the Lord yes sir yes now so in this he makes a distinction between the bride and the church he said some of you that really believe this to be the truth that we're entered into another Age We entering to the rapturing age you know the church can't go in this condition and it can't get any better it must get worse how many knows that now that's the church amen it's get worse it can't go like this see it's got to be something that's moving right now friend it's on the move is is own for the bride that's the truth th thus sayith the Lord amen amen so the church goes into decline remember vision of the Bride the church goes down the bride goes up amen this is the time of the Ascension amen as the as a as the world is falling as Satan falls from heaven come on Church as our society is falling all around us in that moment there's a bride [Applause] ascending hallelujah amen Revelation 12 shows Satan cast down the bride going up as he comes down the bride goes up as hell comes down up on the earth amen we are moving toward Heavenly [Applause] rounds I'm not looking for for Revival in our generation I'm looking for the coming of the Lord yes okay but you realize that the coming of the Lord comes first as the word to a prophet yes absolutely that's the amen this is this is the mystery of his coming amen behold I show you a mystery it happened in phases are you with me amen so then then of course but that ain't all of it it ain't all just God sending us a message and glory to God we got new Theology and we got new understanding it's not just that amen but now then the word must take on flesh of people who eat the book and become the word and speak the word so you see it must then take on flesh and be in full fully manifested in Bride form and then finally and ultimately to meet the Lord in the air shout voice and Trump now you know we we know the we know the shout is a message Gathering the people together bringing them back to the word amen Revelation 101 shows the mighty Angel comes down and what does he do amen he cries with a loud voice he's not weeping he's not snotting you know he is shouting right he shouts with a loud voice amen now so so again he would Shout with a loud voice and when he shouts when the message come seven Thunders utter their voices amen mysteries of God that have been held up sealed away to this last day become revealed now so again he shouts with a loud voice notice again the the the next phase of the Rapture is from shout is voice and it's the voice of the Archangel yes yes now scripturally go to me go with me anywhere and where are you going to see the voice of the Archangel except in Revelation 10 because in re ration 10 there the mighty Angel listen he comes down and does what he hands the book to the people so that they might prophesy again and become the voice when a church is being spewed out of the mouth of God for their lukewarmness because they made God sick and they rejected his gospel somebody help me preach amen while they are cast out the mouth of God there is another who is the mouth of God and they are the final voice to the final [Applause] age amen so it takes the fullness of the word to produce a bride a mature bride yeah Christ came in word form to the prophet but now the word must make a progression you say well I've seen God send a prophet I I listen to the tapes and I believe it's the message okay but that can't remain on shape amen you sure that's where the voice of God was that's where it sounded from but the days of the seventh angel and his voice is over with he's no longer bringing a new sermon from Jeffersonville and a new message God God that voice is now silenced not that we don't have it tape listen I can say the same thing about Paul Paul's not here preaching amen amen but but we still have his recordings but that's not Paul's message he's not bringing a new revelation or bringing a new expounding are you with me the same thing happens that and the same thing it changes now from the prophet to his prophecy that's right and his prophecy listen this this was never about God sending a Prophet this was about what God had in his mind before the world began and that was that he the lonely God wanted a family Hallelujah and everything he's ever done has been for that motive and purpose that God would have a family and God is determined he will have a bride without spot without a wrinkle without a blemish or any such thing I may I may need three sessions hallelujah amen now so the coming of the Lord would require that he come as word first because unless the word is restored there's nothing to make a bride out of because she's got to be a word bride is that right so then the word come restored but that's not remember it's the restoration of the brid tree yes yes now and then finally it comes manifested in Groom form where we meet him in the air listen don't ever ever forget if if if it doesn't materialize in the coming of the Lord Jesus where we meet the physical Lord Jesus in glorified bodies this has all just been air castles and pipe dreams our ultimate goal is to meet Jesus but to meet him we got to be dressed to meet him amen amen you've going to have to be dressed to meet you don't want to meet him in spotted garments amen spotted with sin you can't do it you're going to have to be ready I remember you know we live in a small town and it's yeah and our our our probably our our whole County don't have as much population is your city of Buford I don't know how many is here but there ain't many in our in our County how much so anyway you know and I and I we we are very small as far as populists in are there and you know I this has been years ago now but I I was working around the farm and and and you know I had my barn clothes on and manure stains on my on my pants and my shirt was messy and I was sweaty and I looked at oh my goodness I've got to run to the bank you know I I've got to do this right now and and if I don't do it this minute I I I'm I'm going to miss this and this is important to get there so I grab my stuff and I don't have time to change clothes and and I run run to the bank and nobody has seen me in this town you know you can walk in that bank and ain't nobody in there but me and that teller and that's it so you know okay I'll embarrass myself with one person but ain't going to be nobody else I get to that bank and the bank president meets me at the door with a tuxedo on his wife's in this bald dress and there are other dignitaries in the town and and they're all dressed up to the it was the 100th anniversary of the bank and I'm looking like this the the preacher what I'm trying to tell you the point I'm trying to make you you don't want to try to go to that marriage supper and you're not dressed for it you won't just be embarrassed they will throw you out luckily luckily the guy said come on in here Tim make your deposit son but it won't be that way there you will you'll be turned away don't you know Jesus told us that they would appear at the marriage supper sir without a wedding garment on you're going to have to be dressed with the Robes of this word or you're not going to make it wow it brother don't make any excuse It's see it's spotted a little bit with the world here and listen that has stand out really big [Applause] [Music] there you'll be cast out into our outer Darkness yes where there's weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth Great Tribulation says becoming begins with return of Christ the word and the message absolute and and I in some ways I wish I could have put this on the screen but it's from the message absolute it's paragraph 225 and 6 but um brother brandham says his this 1621 12-30 but he says I remember when he swept down in that big light Yonder standing Yonder at the bottom of the River 1933 in June he said as John the Baptist was sent forth and forun the first coming of Christ I send you with a message to the world to forerun the second coming of Christ and around the world she's went I want you to watch the language she's went he's talking about his ministry when Revival fires has been built for 15 years on nearly every Mountain Divine Healing Across the Nation and the power and restoration now this is where he says where where people have taken and I think it was in the Nugget book it started out you know where with brother Jack Palmer making his notes in this that Rapture and Faith lays on the tapes but that's not what it says there's no quote that says that all right and I'm not even going to argue with you that Rapture and Faith isn't in the message I believe we have a Rapture Revelation yes but that's not what this quote says so he say he says and I believe she's watch's this is ready to strike that final climax Yonder to bring forth a faith that will Rapture the church into glory and she's laying in the messages so he's talking about his ministry and he has been laying in sermon after sermon after sermon hey you can do something all right let's try yeah there you go got amen I knew Matt Watkins come through for me so now so let's just look at this now now I believe she's ready to strike that final climax I'm go back to the next paragraph I want you to see this because he says around the world she's went when Revival so what's his language what's he talking about his ministry has now caused Revival fires to be buil for 15 years on nearly every Mountain Divine Healing across the Nations and the power and restoration and now I believe she speaking about his ministry is ready to strike that final climax Yonder to bring forth a faith that a Rapture the church in the glory and she's laying in the messages he's preached the church ages Daniel 70 weeks statue of a perfect man wisdom versus Faith restoration of the brid tree he just been laying one sermon after another building a v Foundation yes are you with me and we're really at the end time we've talked about it and everything but the thing is moved upon us now yeah yes sir here's one that's right okay so you see the the quote there we're really in the end time and he says I believe she's ready to strike that final climax I want you to get this we are in the final climax it's the final climax for the Gentiles for the world history oh yeah it's the final climax for the Bride of Seven Ages we are in the final climax amen and he said he would bring forth a faith that would Rapture the church for striking that final climax even in his ministry because now you know all of the Divine Healing movement had done was prepared the way he called it the former rain or the teaching rain so that the latter rain could follow and the latter rain would begin Now with an outpouring of the spirit but now it's coming in a way it's a mystery that the world is missing is coming because it's coming as word that's first a message first but it's Vindicated what the power that lays in that message with W with healing with salvation had he writes children with with the tumor with sister brandham on and on and on the the SP the creation of of squirrels you know what I'm talking about all of these one thing after another the speaking to the squirrels of the squirrels and the speaking to the storm all of these things that happens what to show us the power that's right that lays in the open book I'll tell you what I believe we have untapped resources sir we haven't even begun to discover the power that lays in this word this is a word that created the world and created the heavens and the Earth come on and that same word has power in it this morning to transform you from a sinner to a saint or to Quicken your mortal body and you be healed or Quicken your mortal body and Rapture you [Applause] Hallelujah now brother brandham said again in perseverance 62 he said I I believe the Revival's over he said the Revival doesn't lasts very long this been going on 15 to 16 years but he says it's the last Revival but I believe the next so next Revival will be pulling the church the elect from the groups and take them together and away it will go and we're looking for it to happen so the next Revival would be as he had the third pull Vision you know you know the next Revival would be catching the Covenant people the rainbow trout am are you with me so you see but we can see the Revival fires are burning down Lo so that Revival has died but there is another Revival that is going on come on that this one has made the way far that's right listen you couldn't have any confidence you well I tell you what it's the word that brought me to this message okay I I get that I understand that but listen if it had not been for the Vindication first you would have never you it would have never been known that's right that's right amen amen now so brother Brandon when he comes to the third seal he says he says this maybe smart man can bring this up again this third seal paragraph 182 that's the reason today the revivals we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring so he looks back back and he says okay now what has happened and he would explain it question answer 64 he said I actually he said I actually won millions of people and and and he said um 3/4 of a million of my converts went to the Assembly of God and then to others they just became denominational Christians so what's what he says now we haven't add a real St no no no no don't no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere now it's all just died down and but we got church members out of it now listen God wants more than there just to be Buford Tabernacle or bethl Tabernacle he wants more than just another message church here and that that's he's not looking for buildings he's not looking for groups he not going to Rapture this church he's going to Rapture individuals out of this [Applause] church and if you're not ready you're going to be left behind that's right if you just decide you're just going to stay lukewarm you're going to be left behind there some of you ain't going you're going to miss the boat well I don't like that Brother D well amen that's what it was in Noah's day that's right yes yes you either got on the boat or you didn't make it that's right amen you either walked out with lot amen and and that type walked out with lot or you didn't you burning the fire yes yes one or the other so we he said we've had denominational revivals we hadn't had a real stirring no no no no sir no don't think we got revivals we have oh they got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere he he says again and and just hold that right up for me he says oh we hear Revival this is just once more Lord in 63 we yeah we have denominational Revival getting more members in and things like that but look at the morals it's constantly decaying look how further and further away from God they're getting all the time getting away from the word amen so now he goes on to this next statement and and and we're going to cover this the bride hasn't had a Revival yet so now we've had a Revival among the church and you know and and the the miraculous being done but the bride hasn't had a Revival there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God disturb the bride yet right now they were stirred people actually they would they if you went to a brandom meeting buddy they they were in the in their six hours before service started they they wanted the best seat and you know they would even take their lunch in the church or slip out and get it while somebody held her I mean they camped out in there when the doors open look out you'd get run over yeah now but you see but but watch it stirred people and they got stirred up and revived and they become members of a church yeah yes good people maybe quit smoking or drinking or nice families or this or that but the bride hadn't had a Revival no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it now what she was dead so you know here again he brings it on down and then he says if the churches would just forget their Creeds and forget their dogmas and and and just take the Bible and plead the promise it become affected to them but but see Jesus said your Traditions make the word of God non affected to well the same thing today with spiritual Eve the spiritual bride today so-called Church she takes the word of God and she won't accept it and she accepts dogmas and Stu said therefore the word is not effective to her because she tries to inject her Creed with the word and it won't work do you know what Creed means anyway it's not a bad word it means I believe what I believe and and this is what how we have hybridized the message with many of us putting in what we think and it and it'ss that what I think into the with the word and it won't work that's right in fact what it does it brings a false Revival with with a new self-proclaimed King building a kingdom now so he talks about Herald of his coming and if you'll just hold that right there on that Revival I'm going to come back to that for a moment now now he talked about the herald of his coming and he said how that you know I know those people they're wonderful people they you know they're always praying and and calling on God well if you said this brother and sister Moore you know they I know them they're they're good people and so on they're always crying out you know uh about Revival and um you think that was Jack Moore no it wasn't Jack Moore it was out from Los Angeles there in California it started in The Herald of his coming started back in 1941 with Willard SE and Sarah Sarah Fox Moore they traveled and held meetings and Brother Moore teaching on prayer and overcoming life and Gathering people to prayer and they had this magazine that they sent out and brother Bram reading this magazine said I I read it and world falling apart he said that that the church has cried the loudest what are we hollering about Revival we're hollering about a messiah what are we hollering Revival in our time back this that the other what are they what are they looking for to do it what more do you want what does the church want anyhow we've already got it God gave it to us his promise for his hour we look in the Bible we see it everywhere Through the Bible anointed ones come on and make the word live again right in the hour for that hour and we've got the Messiah yes and this is him the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and and the word remains God Hebrews 16 and8 the same yesterday today and forever and we know what's supposed to take place in this day we're one a messiah and God gave us the Messiah his promised word for this day is waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and make it live again yes sir it's a real Messiah it's the word of God which Jesus said both heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never but the church say spiritually dead gone the hour is past them they're in the slump hardly know what to do and hear every promise is in the God made in the Bible every one of them are laying there just as good as they ever was it's the hour what makes the church this way we're in the age of Leo deia she has to come this way this is the hour for it so now again he would refer to the same thing the editor of this and recognizing your day and this message the editor brother and sister more how you could they won't print anything except fast pray fast pray sound the trumpet how many reads it you know you see it all the time fast pray fast pray it's all you hear fast pray of course we don't write that anymore we just say pray fast so we kind of modernized it a little bit microwaved it we're going to you know that fast pray we're going to have a great breaking of the day there's going to be great thing happened going to happen all of you pray pray pray we're not too late yet why do they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing that there will be an Awakening they're good people and why is it why what have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride but being Christians they feel the pull of the hour but they hadn't recognize what's been done and that's what's making them feel that way and they're looking for something supposed to happen they're looking for way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you so you see and and I want you I want you to understand this is the whole deal what had happened the seven Thunders had had the voice of God had spoken revealing the Mysteries contained in the seven SE and that was what was required to bring a bride's Revival to awaken a bride now I just ask you are you still sleeping we're not still sleeping we have been awaken amen what happened seven Thunders uttered their voices I couldn't sleep through this thunderstorm it woke me up amen God was speaking and let me tell is no longer Thunders anymore it's the voice of God it is the revealed voice it's no longer a mysterious Thunder now we know what the other ages could not know because why we're at the end time so God tells us okay you've arrived at the end you're in the seventh age you're in the last days yes now is the time for me to reveal to you my the secret of my coming absolutely Hallelujah now this quote right here has been used by ever WN toe eighth messenger self-proclaimed Apostle everything else I but I I I just want to say I'm so sorry you know uh you you come up to be the next Apostle or next leader of the Bride the next Joshua you know you you come up to be the eighth messenger or you know the the one with the the the the latest I just say to you take a number get in line you're not the first one you won't be the last one amen but if you ever make it up to the front of line you'll find out you ain't who you think you [Applause] are amen that it's already God has already sent his message we have found the Messiah we don't need an eighth messenger we don't need another jise we don't need another kingdom Builder we don't need an apostle to clarify what the prophet said it's already been brought yes sir so they go well but the bride hasn't had her Revival yet well I'm sorry I'm in my [Applause] Revival and it begins with the word Revival that's right amen begin that's where it begins but don't let don't let you don't get get don't get stalled there it's got to cresendo it's got to keep progressing until the word is made flesh in you and you give voice to the word your life is what liveing out of your life oh not just preaching sermon but your life preaching a sermon yes sir being spoke out of your lips you become the final voice to the final age amen Bri has hadn't hasn't had a Revival yet sure she hadn't there had been no Revival there no manifest ation of God to stir the bride yet we're looking for it and he tells us what it'll take it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again these Thunders is what's going to take to wake her up yes yes now so the seven Thunders have sounded amen and I hurt I hate to hurt anybody's feelings but they had nothing to do with the Seven Virtues absolutely nothing to do with the Seven Virtues amen amen oh well you got to have the Seven Virtues yeah you need to add your faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience whatever amen be and be filled with the Holy Ghost amen but all that's important but it has nothing to do with seven Thunders amen for how could Peter write what John was forbidden to am what a good amen now actually that came to me when I was about before I got married I was out on the Hayfield and you know that some of the brothers came down from south Louisiana and they had all you know jumped into this clan of seven Thunders and oh we got a seven Thunders Revival and and and and and I was out raking ay and and my dad was Baal and I The Rake I had I had to make was a single file rake you make one wind row it makes half you turn around you come back and and pile it on the other and you make one wind row and then the Bor comes along bails a hey and we're taught you know you make hay when the sun shines so we're in a hurry so here I look and I see this preacher comes walking across the field you know and he Flags me down on the tractor and he he said Hey brother Tim I just want you to know we just got the revelation of the seven Thunder system you did well great I said what a oh well that's wonderful I said there're they're to give Rapture in faith for the going away so uh uh what are these Thunders well he said you know that in what Peter said you know add your virtue Faith virgin Virg knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience yeah yeah I said okay he said well when these Thunder out of your life God's going to cap you off with a with a cap us off and we're going to go into Rapture but what they was really preaching was no one had the Holy Ghost so once you ever get good enough God would finally feel you and You' be finally in the Statue of a perfect man and these things had to be thundering out of your life so then God would seal you and until then you got to work a little more so it kept the people in bondage in slavery trying to be good enough to get what God has given us by Grace amen are you with me so here here he comes again as we as we as I I said will you see that man behind me that's right he said yeah I I said that's my dad on a Bor and I said we got to make hay when sunshines see you later and I left him standing in the field and I started rean and as I go to rean hey I'm thinking about what he said and the spirit of God speaks to me says how could Peter write what John was forbidden to wow wow amen and and you see it kept me from a cult movement where they made a man a deity where they made him a apostle to clarify what the prophet bring Clarity to what the prophet said this message does not need man's Clarity God said it the way he wanted it that's right and he wants you to say it the way he said it and you to believe it that's right that's right so the message of Malachi 4 will the messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely mystery revealed truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers all I say is just go listen to what is he you know it used to be CES at the time they didn't change the titles what is the sign of the ERS so you know again they you just go listen to that again and brother bram's going west to meet with seven angels to get the revelation of seven Thunders and he comes back and preaches Seven Seals yes amen so so what what was his commission go there get the revelation of the seven Thunders and he comes back and preaches them and night after night the angel of God comes into his room and there in the presence of that ball of fire amen Revelation comes I was just going to say what the other theologians have said and I thought that was good idea and it sounded good to me but about that time he came in the room and changed my thinking hall hallelujah I want you to know the message we have received is not from a man it is from the angel of his presence amen amen we're not following a man we're following the message of an angel of God true well you said well John Smith got that and he started the Mormons well let me tell you this is no John Smith we did not have to write a new Bible we didn't even have to do like Jehovah witness and go and reinterpret the Bible to make it say what we wanted to say in our own version amen we didn't even need a new Bible like that amen but what it did what it did was not a new Bible not a different Bible not an addition to the Bible not not something extra amen but revealing the same gospel that Paul preached coming back with the same mystery truths so that there could be a bride here in the end time that would be exactly like the bride at the beginning amen yes sir cuz God started a church the way he wanted it now he wants the church the way he started it amen now again have the seven Thunders which equal seven Mysteries been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but not yet known to us as Thunders yet no they were revealed in the seals that's what the Thunders was about amen amen once they were sealed voices now they are known voices amen am so let's let's stop just for a moment they were once sealed up now God had to write it in the word so he wrote it in symbols yes so the first seal opens and here's the symbol what is it a white horse rider right well who is it uh one Theologian says Christ another said an well wonder what happen um one says um back here or there uh somewhere in the tribulation they'll ride ahead all kinds of ideas yes it's kind of like in the days of Daniel I was talking about something was wrote and it was wrote in symbols yes many many tle you Farson but nobody knows what it means it's a symbols a handwriting on the wall speaking in tongues on the wall yes but what does it mean I don't know it's speaking in tongues to me well what does it mean that book of Revelation I don't know it's speaking in tongues to me what does it mean I you know Patrick you know not Patrick Matthew Henry you know he's got his idea who was it Swiss um um apocalypse and they got their idea and lens's got his idea this others got their ideas and they all lay out their ideas one was just as good another yes once suser comes up well oh King I think it means this well you know say you had a little problem you said I think so you really don't know do you no sir I really don't but I I think well other said well but I I think it I think it might mean this I think and another comes finally said listen this is a much of confusion nobody knows what it is and there's a hand that's written on the wall well but there is a prophet in the land let's call the prophet yes so they called Daniel and Daniel looks up and and said okay here's what the symbol means many many tle you far you you're weighed in the balance and you're found wanting right so you see this is exactly what God did in our day we had every body probing at the book everybody's guest and your guess was as good as mine and yeah that's plausible and yeah I think that's a good educated guess but friends this is no educated guess amen Amen brother amen this is not even a seventh grade kian's idea that's right amen this is something Way Beyond that this is from the very Mindy God the one spoke it sad now this symbol that it wrode forth is is now not Christ he is the Antichrist and here he progresses from that gets bloodied with the sword and red and then the black with the Dark Ages and then finally to the pale and then he begins to place others who are in the book people we didn't know who was in the book Martyrs slain under the Jewish and the Jewish dispensation I mean the Gentile dispensation and God said I hadn't forgot them they stood for the testimony they knew are they held yes and I give them white robe just be Qui until the rest of them the 144,000 are slain like you amen then it breaks into the Sixth Seal and what is it a multitude without number come out of Great Tribulation some said it was a bride some say even brother brandham thought it was a bride but he comes along by revelation and he says it's not the bride at all it's the church she goes through this Great Tribulation that's right amen then the 144,000 aren't you glad aren't you glad aren't you glad this was place for us yes when Joshua goes into the land brother Jason God says okay leave Mount sier alone that's not yours leave Moab that's the children of Lot leave them alone children of Esau the children of Lot leave them alone that's I've given them that yes but that's not your inheritance and he defines the inheritance for Israel and says here okay here is our borders here's what belongs to don't you know you don't have to try to be the tribulation Saints you don't have to worry about that you don't have to be the 144,000 you know who you are because why God set you in in the land and said now every promise that pertains to the Gentile bride is yours possess itall if healing in it possess it if the Holy Ghost is in it possess it amen whatever it is Miracles possess it Mysteries possess it it's yours go take it so the move is on for the bride that's thus sayith the Lord but notice now notice now we want to get something here it's not just receiving the mechanics of the message because mechanics without Dynamics will go nowhere yeah and so brother Bram tells us in it is the rising of the sun he said until that church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved him to do the things he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride amen for he said in John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and and he says I'll give him a charge of my Dynamics in his mechanics that the world will not be able to stand it and I will raise it up at the last day that's the Easter message the Dynamics and the mechanics together amen the mechanics without Dynamics no good neither is Dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to and deny this word so sound like Dynamics has a little bit of screaming and shouting or maybe a whole lot out of it of screaming and shouting and jumping up and down come on Amen it's not just a dry formal religion your your religion without emotion is dead it ought to be buried amen so you can scream and shout and jump up and down on you want you deny this word it won't do any good but I tell you we are not word deniers hallelujah if anybody's got a right to shout if anybody's got a right to dance if anybody's got a right to Rejoice you the bride has a right Hallelujah you have a right to shout with the shth am me to be the voice with the [Applause] voice that's yes sir it's the hour to fulfill the Great Commission yes the Great commission's already been fulfilled no it hasn't denominations could not do it invisible Union brother brandham said and this he said we know this 279 we know the modern Church in its present condition in is in no condition to finish up the Great Commission that God gave for the church so I want you to understand it lays on our shoulders what is a Great Commission you remember go into all the world and preach the gospel where to Every Creature yes amen we got responsibility before but listen this is not about us and us four us four and no more there's a bride around the world we got a responsibility are you with Meen amen so you know again again we have to finish up the Great Commission go preach brother brandom said this is not teaching he said it's demonstrating yes demonstrating the gospel and he said then he said and then these signs shall that's not a maybe so church amen that you know might good if they feel like it these signs shout follow them that believe are you a believer that in my name they shall cast out devils in my name they will speak with new tongues come on if they lay their hands on this sick they shall recover that's the promise of God if they drink any deadly thing they'll not harm them amen amen amen no sir amen now he said we know that the church couldn't not the Pentecostal Church by no means by no means could carry out the last day message in its present condition could it why it can't even agree on one or two words in the Bible how's it going to do that so you see denomination out it's going to be an elected people that's elected for it are you with me now so so again you know an elected people that's elected ver let me just make something clear the apostolic age is not over just because the healing Revival is over doesn't mean the apostolic age is over it never ends until the last predestinated member of the Bride comes in yeah is that right amen now I got just a few more minutes man now I know what it is when you start getting hungry I know there's a big dinner and I do not want to be looking like a bunch of [Laughter] baloney now this gospel has to be preached Matthew 24:14 say and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached into all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come you want the end to come find the last predestinated [Applause] sheep now only those to whom the whole book is given can fulfill the Great Commission now this is the restoration of the brid tree now brother brand and the scripture would say when the Fig Tree but you don't notice it says in all the other trees so we see Israel the Fig Tree but what about the other trees putting forth their buds well then you know that summer is not so in other words that we can look then for a harvest season is that right so so he said you know they they've all put forth their branches Methodist Baptist Catholic Pentecostal toor Roberts all them all their have and all El are having their revivals putting forth this Branch then we know that time is at hand but I want you to understand that remember this atmosphere of the breaking forth of the Holy Spirit was not just was not for all them other trees what God in his mind was a bride tree yes yes so so you see again the the bride tree must produce its fruits and it has to produce the same fruits that the groom tree did so that what was done in the ministry of Christ must be done in the ministry of the Bride amen so he said now we know that the Revival we just went through his ceas there must be coming something else that's glorious and great I thought there was nothing else he said this revival cease but there's coming for something that is glorious and great amen I am beginning to believe that is right and he said that that um let let me back up he said so I've been studying hard to find these places in the scripture and I think our Revelation must be scriptural then we know it's right if it's a scripture is from the Lord and I'm beginning to believe that that's right that there's coming a ripening time for the evening fruits so we're not just going to have fruit we're going to have ripened mature fruit that's ready to be picked to put on the master's table amen so you see there's a brid tree coming forth bringing for this fruit and down through the Dark Ages and all we know it was cut down but he said I will restore don't forget that's what we have preached about is that this is a restoring message we're riding on that wave of restor restoration that's right amen so you can have your home restored your family restored your children restored whatever come on because we are riding on that wave and it's all conclusive yes Hallelujah yes you know he said he'll bless you in the city he'll bless you in the country he'll bless you in the field amen he'll bless you come on go in in and coming out he's going to bless you in every kind of way that's what God's going to doen well but brother Tim you didn't read that other part brother Tim where he said now if you don't walk in the word and whatever you're going to be cursed with this and cursed with that let me tell you something that don't apply to you let me tell you why he took your curse he took your curse you ought to start expecting to be blessed I'm going to be blessed in my home I'm going to be blessed in my family we're going to be blessed in this church we're going to be blessed in our finances we're going to be blessed every way we look God's blessings on my life he's going to bless me with healing bless us with Miracle bless us with signs bless us with the Holy Ghost pouring out into our meeting he's going to bless us every way we look Lord every way we turn I am blessed I am blessed I am blessed I'm under God's blessing the Devil can't curse me the devil can't push me down I am blessed I am blessed I am [Applause] blessed abs and we're here at the top of the tree in the light where the fruit ripens yes hallelujah amen glory amen now so speaking of the early Church in domestic conference brother brandham says notice you know the Catholic Church claims to be the first church he said if it's the church then when they've obeyed what God Said originally and it's the word of God look at the signs Miracles and signs and so forth they had and you don't have them at all today is an Evidence that God is not with you amen now wait wait a minute many times we're running out here oh you know he said you know there would be those who said Lord Lord you know have not we done many mighty Miracle but if the signs are not following Believers it's the evidence that God is not with [Music] you so you cannot dismiss it by just saying well the false is the false you know many will come to me no the bride has to have the manifestation she has to produce the fruit now signs will follow them that are believers it is impossible for it not to listen again this is um from uncertain sound now what kind of signs is going to follow them these signs well on some of them that it'll follow perhaps it will maybe it will these signs shall follow them they'll believe in healing they'll believe in casting out Devils they'll believe in speaking with no tongues they'll believe in the Supernatural works the resurrected Jesus working with them then is that the truth that God's last word right remember I talked to uh some of you were there yesterday when I talked about Lincoln's you know the final moments there in the book that was written about uh about Lincoln you know and his last days and describing that and how God was trying to impart to us in the message what he wanted with the last words from Jesus commissioned you go preach how dare some so-called headquarter tell us to sit down they didn't call me God called me God called me man didn't call me I didn't get my calling from my headquarters nobody can tell you to sit down and shut up amen for we are the final voice to the final age yes sir the voice of God brother Brandon said would come through the ministry it's in the bride the voice of God is in [Applause] you Hallelujah was the Pentecostal church and noisy church back in the beginning when the Holy Ghost first fell the Virgin Mary she was a drunk staggering under the power of God and all them like that and the people said they're full of new wine that's the way the church was ordained that's the way every church is ordained every time God has a church it'll be that same kind of church Hallelujah I believe God's a church got a church amen you might can pick and pull this and up since you're trying 56 11:25 secondhand robe brother brandom says they say Divine Healing cannot work the days of Miracles is passed if the days of Miracles is passed the day of God is passed the church that don't believe in Supernatural will finally die and God will leave the church it has to so here we come back along you know you know is there hope of Revival let me just share this and from God of this evil age just just a couple right here here that that he said when she as Eve had the feeling of God's word in her hand she could have took God's word but what did she do in to that instead of tearing for the baptism of the Holy Ghost let science prove to her that the Holy Ghost was only for the disciples instead of keeping Divine Healing going when she ought to be now raised the dead and doing great Miracles she has L Satan under his leadership of relig man take the word of God and try to say was for another age and she believed it well you know that was only for brother Brandon that was only 50 years ago that you know that's all dead now God's word ain't [Applause] dead the Revival might be dead but God ain't dead am Amen in the message once more in in in in 1963 he said there ought to be a holy power surrounding in the church that will make demons flee instead of that it's become a laughing stock what is it the mechanics instead of the Dynamics amen there again you know he said he he he goes on to say he's still the same God of History he's the one was with Daniel and the Lions Den with the Hebrew children the furnace he's still the same God of History he's waiting on his people to calling up out of History amen the same God remains God he's God forever but our Traditions we've taught it away from the people and it's happened you don't need to speak with tongues anymore now you know the gifts are all laid on the shelf and there ain't even quote for that well that which is perfect has come and that which is part is done away with yeah that's right when the whole word comes just having part is done away with we have the whole book we have every promise in it well jumping up and down and trying to speak in yeah trying to speak in tongue trying to work something that's over with that's baby stuff we've learned better than that amen but speaking in tongues ain't over with amen that's a gift that's always to be in the church what am I trying to say Tim you want a bunch of gifts and signs and wonders well I guess I do Paul did say desire them yes so I guess I do but but friends what what I what I'm really trying to say is I'm not trying to emphasize gifts or signs or wonders or Miracles or healing I'm trying to say we have an open book are you with me yeah amen we have the book has been revealed the Mysteries have been revealed it is opened up the book so it opens up healing it opens up signs it opens up wonders it opens up overcoming life it over come on whatever it is it lays in the book I'm saying whatever's in the book whatever's in the book is mine if I need healing is mine if I need God to speak to me he's got a voice and I've got an ear whatever it is God is still [Applause] God that is the truth well you're emphasizing well maybe because it's been deemphasized so then you have to kind of overemphasize sometimes to real to point out things that have been forgotten and he says testimony on the sea he said when then we begin to find out Miracles isn't taking place no more like they were the sick go home sick and it isn't because of God it's because of the lack of Revival among the people there is no Revival they just sit and listen go home and say well I guess that was pretty good mhm great sermon brother brother Jason kind of like a little boy standing with his grandma Yeah standing at the back door and the the the pastor was standing the back door shaking hands as they went out and old granny comes by and said oh Pastor dear I I was just so filled with your sermon and he looked down little boy yes sunny boy what did you think of it he said well frankly sir I got a belly full of it myself you blondes will get that tomorrow but that's the way it is it's just H we've got the greatest message there ever was why why why listen you shouldn't be looking for excuse not to come to church you need to look for every reason to come to church God fill My Heart Lord we gather together let me be a part of the atmosphere let it be that all around me people can see that God is moving that I'm inspiring somebody else to be saved to be healed to be delivered yes that's true amen I realize it isn't in a lot of noise that isn't it but yet I mean that's only half the quotes by the way that's only one side the other side says everywhere Jesus is there is noise amen so it isn't the noise you can have noise and not have Jesus but if you have Jesus I think you're going to have some kind of noise cuz everywhere he is there's noise amen course we've seen people shout and praise the Lord and have not have enough Faith to heal a tooth a I and I know there are those that trained to conversation yeah their congregation I mean to give a response of just running up to the platform standing shouting screaming to the preaching noise that some have even confused as the evidence of the Holy Ghost and much of it is no different than from the priest of Baal who Elijah mocked as he tried to scream down the power of their God so the evidence of the token is not noise but a surrendered life to God that's what you want to look for not who hollers and screams and runs the a of most but is that life surrendered to God Amen sure there's a lot of difference between blessings and and power brother brand said he said brother the whole floor was dancing in the spirit not enough Faith to heal a toothache you call that power that's not power that's blessings there's a lot of difference between blessings and power but don't lose your balance here though it is not power and neither is there any faith in it maybe it is blessings yes yes and blessings are needed yes yes shouting is needed yes let me tell you the Bible they they didn't discourage shouting they encourage courage shouting come on Psalms 32:11 be glad in the Lord and rejoice you righteous and Shout for joy and all ye that are upright in heart are you upright in heart are you righteous then you got a right to shout and that's what brother Bram said I don't care how high you you jump he said just live as high as you jump so if you're living this this high you can jump that high if you're living that high you can jump that if living like that you can jump that high are you with me Psalms 47:1 oh clap your hands all you people shout un to God with a voice of Triumph it is a part of worship it is a part of worship amen it says sick them boy amen but let me tell you something dry theology won't work that's right you see in the churches book brother Bram said in in the Ephesian Church age said Paul saw it come and he warn warned them about this subtle priesthood that would come and take over with its false doctrines he knew they would Implement a way of worship now watch Implement a way of worship now they're going to use quotes to do it sir are you hung up on me try that again they would Implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part in a holy spirit Ministry and even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there's not too much freedom in the Ley and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to ass Serb it and this is a far cry from Paul who said when all came together and all had the leading of the spirit and all participated in spiritual worship so so there there again you see this is this is word that we've got off to that we don't want the Holy Ghost it would embarrass us to have an act two experience we would be embarrassed and me in fact people people say just like brother Bram quoted back at then he said I'm afraid I might speak in tongues and act like some of them I I don't believe I want the Holy Ghost brother brand said I don't care if it makes you scream and cry and ball at the altar he said and and and run around like a chicken with his head cut off that's what he said by the way I'm quoting him amen he said I don't care what way he said a new birth is a mess but we want it in a formal way a classical way but that ain't the way it happened in the book of Acts and it's not going to happen that way for you that's right when it comes it's a supernatural experience it's not just a mental essent assertion that I believe the message it is an [Applause] experience Hallelujah now coming down to my message finally still shorter than you brother Matt become afraid of the new birth afraid to shout the Praises of God afraid of the gifts of the Spirit they want nothing to do with that they just might be called Pentecostal I hope we are called Pentecostal they're afraid of the new birth hey you know what I'm I'm just going to read a couple of these it'll make you go into overtime that's okay I'm I'm going to borrow some of brother Matt's next sermon bring it here so he can shorten his up I'm going to steal a few minutes from him God this is from thirston and life 1960 March before people are afraid of the new birth they're afraid of it now any birth I don't care what level it's on it's a mess you can take it if it's out yonder in a pig pin any birth makes a mess if it's a pig pin if it's in the cow table if it's in a pink decorated hospital room I don't care where a birth takes place it's a mess and the new birth is the same it might it'll make you do things you didn't think you would do you might cry boohoo rub around on the altar no matter what you do I I never asked God it wouldn't do no good to try to bring the new birth to my level I want to meet God's level of the new birth and receive it I don't care what I have to do someone said long not long ago I'm afraid to receive the Holy Ghost I'm afraid it make me speak in tongues like them others I don't care if I spoke in tongues talked in tongues crowed in tongues or anything else I want the Holy Ghost that's the main principle I don't care what level it is I'll meet God on his level then he goes on to say the new birth that changes a man changes a woman changes the Desir their appetites now let me bring you to the other this is a deceived Church by the world brother brandham speaks about Samson he will talk about this for all through after saying Revival is over he shows another Revival a new crop coming are you with me Samson is blinded taken prison that's the church it's in this horrible condition but there's a new crop coming where the power returns are you with me yes so he comes right in he says this he says we all know about that birth I don't care where it is where abouts if it's a mess if it's a baby born on a Shu pile or a hard floor a pink decorated hospital room it's a mess anyhow birth of a c birth of anything else is a mess and the new birth is nothing less than a mess but people so starchy we'll go over where they shake hands we'll go over where they don't ball and cry and beat on the Altar and cry out you want to be too human what we need is a birth to die now to bring forth life old sea potato oh potato sea potato you might take that potato put it in the ground until you can to have until you can have new potatoes that old potato has to rot a corn cannot produce light new life until it's rotten and a man or woman can never have a new birth until their intellectuals and their own self is rotten Dead die out at the altar and scream and get all messed up to a place the starch get out of your collar and you're born again by the spirit of God I don't care if you Squall speak in tongues jump up and down flop like a chicken with his head off you're bringing forth new life amen but we substituted something for it we want it the classical way because we actually become ashamed of him we are embarrassed for the church to bring forth children they might get out of order well I ain't never seen any kids that didn't take them to a restaurant you wish you hadn't they going to get out of order amen take them to church makes it a lot of beating for them to learn to sit still yeah but I mean you can read the the ashamed of him and so on but brother Bram goes on into this he takes these that I've read from the Revival and we've had the revivals but he said we are resting between revivals so if we're resting between revivals there's another Revival coming that just because that other is over with doesn't mean God's through and he said we've been resting between revivals and we've been testifying and you know and we're testifying oh my glory to God you know the Miracles the signs of Wonder oh look what he did well you remember you remember there brother Billy Paul tells about it you know he said I was standing one of the greatest Miracles I saw he said was you know was there's a little girl come up just had slits for her eyes and she's standing there in the prayer line and and and and and and he said uh just little slits there and he said darling do you want to see yes sir you believe me to be God's servant yes sir he said well that's what he said you get the people to believe and he said pulled her up to him started praying he said oh I'm sorry darling what color did you want those eyes she said well I heard blue was pretty he said Lord give this girl beautiful blue eyes he said about that time he saw a ball of fire come right down from heaven stand right there and out of there went two lights right down into those eyeballs and here come a blue eye there and a blue eye there and that little girl could see we're talking about the power of this word yes amen I tell you what but we've talking about the Miracles oh that's what God was and that's what God did and that's got got healed and now well I find you a good doctor man you know that's what you need to do you know put all your faith in there well you better have some Faith you're going to go to a doctor amen they're practicing medicine yes that's exactly they're going to practice on you yes yes amen amen amen and I tell you the medicine you they got it's going to come from the Tree of knowledge so you better really understand it's got his side effects got good and evil yes yes and if you ever believed in Mark 16 when you take medicine you believe it because if you take any deadly thing it won't hurt you Hallelujah pray over every drop of it yes yes what I tell brother Ron and sister my church has got has cancer she been taking chemo I said you pray over every dose amen yes but before Jesus went to sleep in our boat you know we started on this journey and he's over there we got him but he's asleep and there's where he is in most places most people they got him but he ain't you know he just kind of out of sight out of mind we got him we got the Holy Ghost we got we we we're message Believers brother Tim you but he's asleep Trouble Comes and now you know as the as the storm starts Brewing you know we we start you know Satan comes with this poisonous breath brother Brandon saying days of Miracles are past no such thing as Divine Healing poisonous breaths all of this first thing you know we got these OES That was supposed to help us along these doctrines helping us along getting us going you know uh while while um while the wind's not blowing we're waiting for the wind to pick up you know and right now we we've been using the ores and testifying and you know man that great mystery of God and oh my did you get that on the seals and this Revelation there and and first thing you know we start arguing oh my and and now these things that was supposed to these doctrines That was supposed to help us along we take those ores and beat one another with them my good and we start fighting in the boat and the and the storm's getting worse I don't know if you've looked out your boat lately but the waves are higher than this Tabernacle there's trouble everywhere you look there's sin everywhere and it's not going to get better is going to get worse and finally somebody got a revelation it's time that the rest is over on and that's what I'm announcing to you today the rest is over we've got the mechanics we don't need it explained anymore we need the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost we need to awake Jesus in us hallelujah we need to awake Jesus he needs to be awakened in our boat and brother bam said he's not really asleep you've just forgot he was there but he's not that far away from you and but it'll take your faith to awaken him somebody who'll start believing the promise somebody that'll call him action somebody say Jesus help me save me let's I perish yes Lord hallelujah hallelujah the truth rest is over am let me tell you again I'm announcing to you we've had 60 years of mechanics and studying them and Fiddle fatling with them and discovering these are the vows and these are the whatever carburetor here's the this and here's how that works and here's how that work and explaining this and explaining that we don't need more explanations we need the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost in the church to make alive what we've already [Applause] know yes Lord Jesus when brother Bram left us he left us a car that would drive down to Divine Healing it would drive down to Miracles it would drive down come on it would go somewhere it wasn't dead it was alive I don't know who is fiddle fle with it I don't know who's been turned off but I want to tell you if God had a a car that would drive he expects us to get in and drive down to Miracle drive down to Divine he drive down come on to every promise of God until we take a [Applause] Rapture Hallelujah glory to God praise God but the other is some of you have went out on this journey and Jesus has never been in your boat and you've talked about the message too and you said oh it's the truth and you've testified on the sea too and you rejoiced in the Miracles also and you said yeah this is right well that makes sense that's logic I These are nice people we're good people this is a good Society of a church to belong to and we're just members here and you've went off without Jesus and storms are hit your life yes oh God help me to pre this for and the very thing you need you're afraid of here he comes walking on the water and you're afraid of it you're afraid you might get out of order a little bit I hope you do get out of order long enough to get saved that's a quote by the way and you went out without Jesus you got a profession you've been testifying to yeah God sent a yeah I believe that sure that mean that's logic you given a mental Ascent to it you've joined the church you're good denominational believer you got your little little group little Club little little click and I'm not just speaking to you I'm still speaking to the ministers and Jesus is not in your boat but that ain't the End Amen brother here he's coming in this last days walking on your Troubled Waters here he's coming right now amen and bth Tabernacle this morning walking down these aisles you don't have to be afraid of him invite him in your boat and if

that there's a promise of God that lays in there that you don't have to stay there you know when your heart so scarred with so much theology until you can no longer believe my good till we become a faithless group of people whose only weapon is argument heart scarred with theology only concerned with theology I I believe the message I I believe the I believe this is I believe it's coming I

not to know his theology is life but to know him is life amen so you see you see but but what is it what am I concerned about there's so many that still need Jesus among us and this little this little man this little man on the other side Jesus is way across the sea and he just came to himself enough one day to say God I need help yes help me and he went right back into his demonic life but on all the way on the other side of the shore hallu was Jesus and he heard that Whisper of that heart if he'll cross the sea he'll come all the way from Heaven this morning right to where you are just a whisper God I need you I can't I'm broken I'm chained I I I I have chains of pornography and chains of gaming and I you know I can't even function as a man as a as a father I my home is broken up my

to lunch we came back something happened in our ministers meeting that's never happened in 15 years Amen brother Tim coun come with such a broken burden and it so affected all of the brothers after what we had you know what we heard we heard part one to what you heard today part two yes and we as one and all made a decision that we would come forward before we would even continue in the afternoon service we just felt like and I bet it had to be better than 20 or more ministers gathered in a big circle up here and we called on the name of God just like these people were coming up just like you were feeling it right there and we started repenting and we started rejoicing and we started calling on God and we wanted what you wanted a fresh Revival Hallelujah we wanted to see the Holy Ghost in fire we wanted to see the Dynamics of this church be a refilling of the Holy Ghost yes Hallelujah starts with decision to rededicate your life to God if you want those Dynamics if you want a refilling of the Holy Ghost that starts with fresh commitment and that's what we did a fresh commitment we opened our hearts up and rededicated and reconsecrated our hearts to God hallelujah thank you Lord I didn't even bring my iPad up here I had so many notes and I uh I I just knew I'd never step away I'd start preaching so I left it back there on purpose but I just want you to know something friends this this these Services you have been privileged to be in the presence of the king amen the presence of the king brother Caleb can I tell what brother Timothy said to you just a joy it's okay when sister Joy come up for prayer just wanting the Lord to help her with all the things you mothers can imagine losing a baby all the conflict in her heart that the devil would take advantage and the sister come humbly I need help and brother Timothy didn't even know what was who were what who were praying he didn't really know but but while that was going on the Lord was speaking to him to the side you need to pray for that couple who just lost a baby and there they stood and we brought him back up and prayed again Hallelujah I believeing God will do great things Hallelujah I'm telling you he's real he's real hallelujah hallelujah he's real any brother Josh he's real hallelujah oh the power of God is real whatever was your need you know and I've said this to some of you in the prayer line whenever I hear a prayer request I'm leaning heavy on my years of studying God's word I'm leaning heavy on my on my on my knowledge of God's word to say Lord I'm I'm I'm judging it this a house of judgment and every request I get I judge it against God's word to see if it's according to his promise and if it is then I know I can assure that person because you're praying according to his word the Apostle said we know that if he that if he hears us how do we know he hears us cuz we ask according to his will and when we know he hears us then we know we have whatsoever we've asked is that the Bible then we have it it's your right if you don't let the devil take it from you oh my friends we have rights we're Sons and Daughters of the king hallelujah hallelujah I'm going to pray a prayer of dismissal and I'll give every person one last chance if you haven't found the wherewithal in your heart to say Lord give me a clean heart give me a fresh cleanness give me a fresh P purging give me that I might have a fresh refilling that that the that the power of God could flow through my life down into my home down into my family down through my children down through my Association oh Hallelujah Lord in the name of Jesus Christ Lord we're calling once more Lord once more Lord God may you give us a complete purging of our heart and mind once more may you give us that freshness of the Holy Spirit yes Lord if anyone doesn't know you in the power of your Resurrection May they know you that way right now Lord Lord life has a way of just draining us down Satan's Eden but yet you
