[3:59] I was working in town one afternoon
[4:04] attending some business affair.
[4:09] I heard a commotion a couple streets
[4:13] over. I wondered what's happening there.
[4:18] A young man was running from within that
[4:22] direction and he stopped just to catch
[4:25] his breath.
[4:27] I asked him to please tell me what was a
[4:31] hurry.
[4:33] He smiled up to me.
[4:37] I was trying to catch you

[7:58] [Music]

[8:08] what
[8:10] they think you're like, but I've heard
[8:16] the tender Hear whispers of love
[8:20] in the dead of night. And you tell me

[16:17] Happy to have you here in the house of
[16:19] God tonight. Amen. Glad to be home.
[16:23] Amen. had a nice little trip to Poland.
[16:26] Uh, brother Matt and I were ministering
[16:28] there. Zoe and Pete were with us and so
[16:31] we had a really nice time. Sister Ma was
[16:34] there with us and we had a really nice
[16:36] time and um so uh I I all day long I've
[16:41] been I actually got this thought tonight
[16:44] from Poland. So it's important.
[16:48] Is that all right? Amen. I actually
[16:50] thought that I um might I I had already
[16:54] actually already preached my services
[16:56] there, but it was something that in my
[16:59] preaching uh something came to me and I
[17:02] began to look at it and feel the
[17:04] direction of the Lord and thought I
[17:06] might share it with just the pastor
[17:08] there oneon-one, but that didn't work
[17:10] out. And as I came home and began to
[17:13] look, I just kept this thought in the
[17:15] back of my mind just kept trying to push
[17:16] forward. So, we're going to look at it
[17:19] tonight. And as it turns out, it'll be a
[17:21] perfect uh stepping stone for the
[17:24] weekend. Praise the Lord. We're going to
[17:26] invite you to St. John chap 11.
[17:30] Amen. St. John chap 11 and we're going
[17:35] to catch a lengthy reading. So, we'll
[17:37] just read the first couple of verses.
[17:38] We'll let you be seated. While you're
[17:41] turning to that, um I want to just make
[17:44] a Where do I have it? A quick
[17:47] announcement.
[17:49] Um so you all know of course every year
[17:52] brother Samuel and the Spanish church
[17:54] has their July meetings July 19 um 19
[17:58] and 20 and um I was thinking it's
[18:02] usually three but this apparently only
[18:04] has the 19th and the 20th. Um maybe
[18:07] brother Samuel's um not holding that
[18:10] third service. That's the dates I have
[18:11] here. 19 to 20 as far as I know that's
[18:14] accurate. But um brother uh Joe Adams is
[18:19] coming this year from Louisiana there,
[18:22] brother Tim Pru Church. We've had
[18:23] brother Joe here. We sure love him, him
[18:25] and his family. And so that he'll be
[18:27] ministering that. So I just think it
[18:29] would be grand uh if we could really and
[18:32] actually to brother Samuel actually
[18:34] called brother Matt and I reached out to
[18:36] us while we were abroad and and ask us
[18:40] to please uh ask this church as many as
[18:43] possible. I think that with um some of
[18:46] the deportation issues that are going on
[18:48] in Texas right now, there's a large
[18:51] group of Hispanic believers that
[18:52] normally come every year to that meeting
[18:55] and uh they're a little bit afraid to
[18:58] move around right now from state to
[19:00] state. So,
[19:02] um so brother Samuel has asked if we
[19:04] could make an extra effort and uh I I
[19:07] assured him, brother Matt assured him we
[19:09] certainly would. So, I just want to
[19:10] start announcing that tonight. We'll
[19:12] announce it again this weekend. See if
[19:14] you can make plans uh to drop in on the
[19:18] uh let's see. So, it looks like um
[19:23] that would be at least we can make the
[19:25] Saturday um which would be the 19th.
[19:29] Correct? So, I'm not sure what happened
[19:31] to Friday the 18th. That's usually a
[19:33] three-day meeting. But, at any rate, if
[19:35] I if the dates change, I'll update you.
[19:38] But it'd be grand if we could make a
[19:39] really concentrated effort to at least
[19:41] drop in there on Saturday. Those
[19:43] believers support all of our meetings
[19:44] and have for years. And we do the same
[19:47] uh for them. And so, Brother Samuel's
[19:49] actually increasing the facilities and
[19:52] restrooms and things uh to accommodate
[19:55] larger crowds. So, note that on your
[19:57] calendar and uh Brother Samuel and the
[20:00] church there will appreciate that. St.
[20:02] John chap 11. Let's catch a couple of
[20:06] verses and then we'll let you be seated.
[20:09] Very familiar reading Jesus at the tomb
[20:12] of Lazarus.
[20:14] Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus
[20:18] of Bethany, the town of Mary and her
[20:20] sister Martha. It was that Mary which
[20:24] anointed the Lord with ointment and
[20:26] wiped his feet with her hair, whose
[20:29] brother Lazarus was sick. Therefore, his
[20:33] sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord,
[20:36] behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
[20:40] Let's pray. Father, we thank you for
[20:43] your word tonight, Lord. And just
[20:46] reading it now, Lord, we have some more
[20:47] that we wish to read. And I'm just
[20:50] trusting in you, Lord. This thought has
[20:52] been burning on my heart for a couple of
[20:53] days now. And I was so enjoying as I
[20:57] dove into it today. tired and weary in
[21:00] my mind and body, but my I feel so
[21:02] invigorated with this thought, Lord. And
[21:04] I ask your help tonight, Lord, as I
[21:07] stand here to assist you. Bring this
[21:10] word to the church tonight, Lord. And
[21:12] those who are not able to be here,
[21:14] perhaps are watching a live stream or
[21:17] catch it on an archive later, Lord. It
[21:19] should be instruction instruction based
[21:21] to us. And so I I pray for your help
[21:24] tonight that I can deliver it, Lord, in
[21:27] the way that it burns in my heart. I
[21:29] commit it to you uh for the end, Lord,
[21:32] that it should glorify you and your
[21:34] kingdom and instruct us a little more
[21:36] clearly how we might best be of service
[21:39] to you at the at the highest level. We
[21:42] commit ourselves now to this end in
[21:44] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you friends.
[21:47] You can be seated. We'll keep reading.
[21:50] Amen. Verse
[21:55] three again. Therefore his sisters sent
[21:58] unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom
[22:02] thou lovest is sick. When Jesus heard
[22:05] that, he said, This sickness is not unto
[22:08] death, but for the glory of God, that
[22:11] the Son of God might be glorified
[22:14] thereby.
[22:15] Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister
[22:18] and Lazarus. When he had heard therefore
[22:23] that he was sick, he abodeed two days
[22:25] still in the same place where he was.
[22:30] Then after that saith he to his
[22:32] disciples, let us go into Judea again.
[22:36] His disciples say unto him, Master, the
[22:39] Jews of late sought to stone thee, and
[22:42] goest thou thither again? Jesus
[22:45] answered, Are there not 12 hours in the
[22:48] day? If any man walk in the day, he
[22:51] stumbleth not, because he seeth the
[22:53] light of this world. But if a man walk
[22:56] in the night, he stumbleth, there
[22:58] because there is no light in him. These
[23:02] things said he, and after that he saith
[23:04] unto them, our friend Lazarus, Lazarus
[23:08] sleepeth, but I go that I may awaken him
[23:12] out of sleep. Then said his disciples,
[23:15] Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. How
[23:19] be it Jesus spake of his death, but they
[23:21] thought that he had spoken of taking of
[23:24] rest in sleep. Then said Jesus unto them
[23:27] plainly, Lazarus is dead. And I am glad
[23:30] for your sakes that I was not there to
[23:33] the intent you may believe.
[23:36] Nevertheless, let us go unto him. Then
[23:39] said Thomas, which is called Ditimus
[23:41] unto his fellow disciples, let us also
[23:44] go that we may die with him. Then when
[23:48] Jesus came, he found that he had lain in
[23:51] the grave 4 days already. Now Bethany
[23:55] was nigh unto Jerusalem about 15
[23:58] furlongs. And many of the Jews came to
[24:00] Martha and Mary to comfort them
[24:04] concerning their brother. Then Martha,
[24:07] as soon as she heard that Jesus was
[24:09] coming, went and met him. But Mary sat
[24:13] still in the house.
[24:15] Then said Martha unto Jesus,"Lord, if
[24:19] thou hast been here, my brother had not
[24:22] died. But I know that even now,
[24:25] whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God
[24:28] will give it thee." Jesus saith unto
[24:31] her, "Thy brother shall rise again."
[24:33] Martha said unto him, I know that he
[24:35] shall rise in the resurrection at the
[24:38] last day. Jesus said unto her, I am the
[24:42] resurrection and the life. And he that
[24:45] believeth in me, though he were dead,
[24:48] yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth
[24:51] and believeth in me shall never die.
[24:54] Believest thou this? May the Lord bless
[24:57] the reading of his word. Uh just even as
[25:00] I read that, there is so much
[25:02] ministering. I would like to just stop
[25:04] and take my time and go through there.
[25:07] But I wanted to just come to this one
[25:10] particular point tonight if we'll just
[25:12] get one fold of it and aim at it really
[25:14] hard. Uh I want to speak to you tonight
[25:17] on a t on a title. The sum of our lives.
[25:21] It's not part of for the booth. It's not
[25:23] part of any of my series um the the
[25:27] modern events or future events uh
[25:29] series. This is a standalone. But it
[25:32] will, as I said, prop me up pretty good
[25:35] uh for uh Sunday because to Sunday has
[25:39] um well, it just has some mindbending
[25:44] material. So, tonight we're going to
[25:46] stay a little little closer to um to the
[25:49] to the home to where the road see if
[25:52] that is helpful to us. Amen. Now, um, in
[25:57] in in in reading this text and taking
[26:00] this title, the sum of our lives,
[26:04] I you're going to see here in a minute a
[26:06] quote that I read to you recently, and I
[26:09] didn't post it to the church in Poland,
[26:12] but I quoted from it where uh, Brother
[26:15] Brandham makes reference to um, that the
[26:19] sons and daughters of God are actually a
[26:22] part of God's Godhead. You've heard me
[26:24] quote that many times. You're actually
[26:26] in God's Godhead. And and I came across
[26:30] another quote that was in 1965. And I've
[26:33] got that. We're going to look at it
[26:34] fresh again. But you're also going to
[26:37] notice the quote just before it from
[26:39] just after the seals and one of brother
[26:41] Brandham's other mindbending sermons.
[26:44] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[26:46] And he's going to actually say some
[26:49] things there that I'd never caught until
[26:51] just today. actually even though I had
[26:54] I've have had this quote as I say um on
[26:57] a file since uh a couple days ago uh on
[27:01] on Sunday when I ministered there in
[27:03] Poland Sunday afternoon service we had
[27:05] an outstanding time by the way. Amen. So
[27:09] I want to focus on this thought that
[27:11] I've made this comment to you before.
[27:13] It's not original to me. I heard brother
[27:15] Clark Thomas make it in a minister's
[27:17] meeting some years ago. I've never
[27:19] forgotten it. and and he he started
[27:22] talking about how that people uh think
[27:25] of the resurrection as an event on a
[27:28] calendar. And there's nothing wrong per
[27:30] se with thinking that because the
[27:33] resurrection is an event on a calendar.
[27:36] I don't think it pays any attention to
[27:38] our calendars, but I know God has it on
[27:40] his calendar. So, whatever day his
[27:42] calendar corresponds to our calendar,
[27:44] well, that'll just be the Earth Day that
[27:46] it happens. But Jesus already knew 2,000
[27:50] years ago on the Mount of Olives when
[27:52] they asked him concerning the
[27:54] restoration of Israel as a kingdom which
[27:57] happens in the millennium. Israel will
[27:59] be reestablished as the leading nation
[28:01] of the world and and the king will rule
[28:04] for that at Jerusalem will be his
[28:05] capital. And so uh so we realize that
[28:09] that that that Jesus knew that the
[28:12] father has an exact time in his mind
[28:15] when the resurrection when the
[28:16] restoration when the kingdom shall be
[28:19] restored.
[28:20] Amen.
[28:21] So but brother Clark was making the
[28:23] point that you you don't want to just
[28:25] think of it as a date on a calendar as
[28:27] some somewhere over a rainbow. That's a
[28:31] horrible version of it. But it it's not
[28:34] just somewhere over a rainbow. Uh and
[28:37] it's not just a date fixed on the
[28:39] calendar, though it is. But but brother
[28:42] Clark was making the point that it's not
[28:44] merely a date. It's not merely a thing.
[28:47] It's not merely an event. Jesus said, "I
[28:51] am the resurrection." So the so the
[28:54] resurrection is a broader word. You need
[28:56] to have that in your minds that it's
[28:58] broader than just some event. Uh you
[29:01] know the the message of the hour isn't
[29:04] just an event. You know what happened in
[29:06] Arizona? What happened in
[29:07] Jeffersonville? What happened in the
[29:09] room? The pillar of fire coming in
[29:11] there. It's not just an event. That's
[29:12] not just a story we tell. Though valid,
[29:14] though true, though meaningful, though
[29:16] purposeful, but it's more than that,
[29:19] friends. You're not just believing
[29:20] doctrine. And the message didn't come
[29:22] just to fill you up with doctrine and
[29:24] give you, you know, uh, stories of the
[29:26] supernatural, though they're all true
[29:28] and though they're all relevant and
[29:29] though they all encourage us, but it
[29:31] it's it's more than that. The message,
[29:34] as we've said to you for many years,
[29:36] I've said it from the Bethl Tabernacle
[29:38] pullpit, probably since I became pastor
[29:40] in 1995, that the message is a person.
[29:44] It's not just books and tapes and
[29:46] quotes, which are the vehicle. Not only
[29:48] do we have books and tapes and quotes,
[29:50] but we have digital, we have internet,
[29:52] we have all we have video, we have
[29:53] everything. That's the vehicle. But the
[29:56] message is the person of Jesus Christ.
[29:59] And he has a message. And the message is
[30:01] come out of her, my people, and be not a
[30:04] partaker of her sins. And that's not
[30:07] just come out of a denomination. That's
[30:09] come out of a barroom, come out of a
[30:11] denomination, come out of a
[30:13] organization, come out of whatever you
[30:15] have to come out of that's holding you
[30:17] back from having a daily lively uh uh uh
[30:23] rich relationship with the person of the
[30:26] word.
[30:26] Amen. Amen.
[30:30] So, I want to read I think I have um
[30:33] one, two, three, four, five. I have five
[30:36] quotes posted and we're going to look at
[30:37] them now. Let's have my title slide. Um,
[30:40] Sister Sarah and then we'll I'll take it
[30:43] over from here. The sum of our lives and
[30:47] brother Brandham comes right on the
[30:49] scene here. And I want you to notice
[30:50] that we're going to look at five
[30:52] different things. The um uh a as it
[30:56] relates to um how would I say this? Um
[31:01] being a part of something.
[31:02] Amen.
[31:03] All right. So, and that's what that's
[31:05] what the Lord began to lay upon my heart
[31:07] when I began to quote, you know, you're
[31:10] a you're a part of God's godhead. You're
[31:12] in the quote is actually you're in God's
[31:15] godhead, which means you're you're not
[31:18] God and you're not Jesus, but you're the
[31:21] continuation of Jesus. You're Mrs.
[31:24] Jesus. You're a you're a membered body,
[31:27] the word made flesh in the earth. So in
[31:30] that sense, we're a part of God's great
[31:33] eternal expression. Now that sounds
[31:35] heady and high altitude. You're a part
[31:38] of God's expression. But you know, as we
[31:40] said the the week before we left and and
[31:43] JD had said it in his Sunday school,
[31:45] we're not just looking at these high
[31:47] altitude, top of the atmosphere truths
[31:50] that wow us and they're spectacular and
[31:52] they they're they're mindbending, but
[31:55] but hey, let's let's remember they come
[31:57] with a meaning. They don't come to
[31:59] dazzle us. They're not just It's not a
[32:01] circus act. We're not here to just make
[32:04] profound statements. This stuff is
[32:06] supposed to get down into gears and it's
[32:08] supposed to be like steam in a steam
[32:10] engine and get the train moving down the
[32:12] track.
[32:13] Amen.
[32:14] That's what it's for. And so you you
[32:18] realize and I realize in ministry over
[32:20] the years that when I see somebody
[32:22] sitting year after year after year under
[32:26] under under
[32:28] really good ministry and preaching, but
[32:31] you don't ever see their train really
[32:33] rolling down the track with any kind of
[32:35] speed. And I realize that that the that
[32:39] the general the the the heart of the
[32:41] problem is is they're not really getting
[32:44] it to the point of assimilating it to
[32:47] where it's just more than teaching and
[32:49] doctrine and wow.
[32:50] Amen.
[32:51] Now, I'm not saying they're a bad
[32:52] person. They might be a perfectly fine
[32:55] person. They might have had an
[32:56] experience in the Lord where where
[32:58] they're they're seed gene of God. Let me
[33:00] just say let me just check all the boxes
[33:02] and say you check all the boxes. You're
[33:04] all the above. You're in the mind of God
[33:06] before the foundation of the world. But
[33:08] what is it that Satan has a hold of your
[33:11] life that keeps you
[33:13] from assimilating to where the word
[33:16] becomes a lived flesh life behind behind
[33:19] skin.
[33:23] So we're part of something. And and
[33:25] brother Brandham starts out here in 1958
[33:27] in the handwriting on the wall.
[33:30] That's why the bornag again Christian
[33:34] has never an end because he has eternal
[33:39] life. Now this is very heady. Listen.
[33:42] And eternal life is a part of God. Go a
[33:47] part of God's own life. For God is
[33:51] eternal. And the same word Greek word
[33:54] Zoe that says God's life. When Jesus
[33:57] speaks and said, "I give unto them
[34:00] eternal life," that same word is used
[34:03] again. So when Jesus says, "I give unto
[34:06] them eternal life," he's activating the
[34:09] part inside of you that was God before
[34:12] there was stardust. And that's a gene
[34:14] inside you that laid dormant before the
[34:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost, before God
[34:19] chased you down. I'm glad he chased me
[34:21] down. Yes. Amen.
[34:23] I'm glad I I may have ran but I couldn't
[34:25] hide. I'm glad there was nowhere I could
[34:27] get away from him. I'm glad to be
[34:29] captured.
[34:33] I, as I've said many times, once I
[34:37] really got to know him, I didn't want to
[34:39] be me anymore.
[34:42] I I I wanted to be like him, not like
[34:44] me. Me has harmed me. Me has misled me.
[34:49] Me has disappointed me. But he has never
[34:51] misled, hurt or disappointed me.
[34:55] So he says here it's that same word that
[34:59] he has given unto them. It's part of
[35:01] God's life. Now be since you now since
[35:04] we know already
[35:06] that the that you didn't become a son or
[35:10] a daughter of God when you repented. You
[35:12] only discovered by a revelation of the
[35:14] Holy Spirit, by a revelation of the word
[35:16] that you believed that a gene of God
[35:18] came to life. You had always been
[35:21] a child of God
[35:23] and now you have the ability to begin to
[35:27] cooperate in the vision. You can you
[35:29] actually have the ability to really live
[35:33] as a way that matches intrinsically with
[35:36] your true nature. Not the nature Paul
[35:38] said we were all born just as others of
[35:41] a fallen nature. But that wasn't our
[35:43] original nature.
[35:45] Amen.
[35:46] The life of a true child of God is a
[35:51] life of shallow misery. You're just
[35:54] trudging along a few days full of full
[35:57] of trouble with all the rest of humanity
[36:00] going through a few days and full of
[36:02] trouble. But once you once something
[36:04] once the light strikes that seed, you
[36:07] realize now my goodness, I've got such a
[36:09] greater purpose. I I've got such a
[36:12] greater vision. I've got so much to
[36:14] accomplish. I wish I'd have surrendered
[36:16] my life a long time ago to the Lord.
[36:18] These are feelings that are common to us
[36:20] in the new birth.
[36:22] So he goes on here. He says, "Therefore,
[36:25] a man being born again, his spirit has
[36:30] been changed and he becomes a part of
[36:33] God." Now your spirit, as we know in
[36:35] later teaching, it wasn't your spirit
[36:37] that died. It was your nature of the
[36:39] spirit, which is the soul. So that
[36:41] fallen nature you were born with by a
[36:44] sex birth, that was annihilated. See?
[36:47] And so now the spirit has a new nature,
[36:50] a nature that was its original nature.
[36:53] And I mean, if they if that's not true,
[36:57] then I mean, the fact that that is true
[37:00] explains to me why I never felt like I
[37:03] fit in
[37:04] with the world. but with the word.
[37:09] I'm just right at home. Hallelujah.
[37:14] So he says
[37:16] he's been changed and he becomes here's
[37:18] the here's the line. He becomes a part
[37:21] of God in so much that he is a son of
[37:24] God. So now you actually have an active
[37:28] god life.
[37:30] Wow.
[37:32] Just let that weigh on you a minute.
[37:34] That's awesome.
[37:35] Now
[37:36] I I'm I'm setting you up a little bit.
[37:38] I'll go ahead and and out myself. I'm
[37:41] I'm setting you up a little bit because
[37:42] the Lord set me up. And when I began to
[37:46] read all of these things and I was just
[37:48] like, my goodness, I'm a part of God's
[37:51] own life. Eureka. Wow.
[37:54] And I and I go on down and I've got all
[37:56] these other parts that I'm a part of.
[37:58] I'm a part of this. I'm a part of that.
[37:59] I'm a part of this. And the Lord's just
[38:00] sitting there taking me to quote after
[38:02] quote after quote. Amen.
[38:04] And I was like, Lord, I'm so glad to be
[38:06] a part of something. And the Lord,
[38:07] without breaking us, not breaking the
[38:09] the rhythm, just said, "What are you
[38:10] doing about it?"
[38:12] Amen.
[38:14] Are you just you just is this just uh
[38:16] you know something to you know what's
[38:19] the old Pentecostal term? You know,
[38:21] where you know there's such a happiness
[38:23] I forget the term they use an old
[38:25] archaic term. But but it's not just you
[38:27] know that we we we jump up and down and
[38:29] we shout over these truths. Don't we
[38:31] jump up and down and shout over these
[38:32] truths?
[38:33] That's how I always that's how it works
[38:35] on me. Ever since I was young, when I
[38:37] get happy, I jump up and down. And so,
[38:39] but that but hey, I still got to go out
[38:41] the next day and fight the devil.
[38:44] So, I got to have something more than
[38:45] just to jump up and down.
[38:47] That's right.
[38:49] So, we're a part of God. Guess what?
[38:51] You're a part of God. Guess what? You're
[38:53] part of God.
[38:57] And he's just as eternal. This is you.
[39:01] Yes. Amen. You can say it like this. I'm
[39:04] just as eternal as God is.
[39:07] Amen.
[39:08] I dare you to say that within yourself
[39:10] right now. I'm just as eternal as God
[39:11] is.
[39:14] Because he's a part of God by birth.
[39:19] Spiritual birth.
[39:21] Amen.
[39:23] Brother Brandham comes along a year
[39:24] later
[39:27] and um
[39:30] nearly almost two years later by the
[39:32] date.
[39:34] Did you know
[39:36] from my new ministry, did you know God
[39:40] knew that we'd be standing here 10
[39:43] million years before the world was ever
[39:45] formed? Amen.
[39:47] Now you say, "Well, if he knows it, then
[39:51] why are you preaching?"
[39:53] That's God's part of the program.
[39:56] Preaching is his program.
[39:58] Amen.
[39:59] But Jason, why are you a preacher? If
[40:01] God already knows who's going to be
[40:02] there 10 million years before the world
[40:04] ever spun in space, why are you
[40:06] preaching? Because it's part of God's
[40:08] program.
[40:09] I'm part of God's program. I'm a part of
[40:11] God. I'm as eternal as God, and I'm a
[40:13] part of his program. So, I'm preaching.
[40:15] Why are you listening?
[40:17] Why do you come here? If he's already
[40:19] got it figured out 10 million years
[40:21] before the world was ever formed, you
[40:22] know why you're here? Because that's
[40:24] what believers do.
[40:26] Believers gather. They assemble
[40:27] themselves together. And guess what else
[40:29] they do? They do it more as they see the
[40:31] evil day approaching.
[40:33] Amen.
[40:34] Which means that they have taken steps
[40:37] to not allow the world to keep them from
[40:40] assembling more.
[40:41] Amen.
[40:42] Amen. Oh, it got a little quieter there.
[40:47] I I I I know the people who should be
[40:50] here and aren't because the world has
[40:51] done that to them probably aren't saying
[40:53] amen. But you should say amen.
[40:55] Amen.
[40:58] So he says,
[41:00] so he says that's God part of God's
[41:03] program. Preaching is his program.
[41:08] uh when he looked upon the apostles, he
[41:12] looked upon the harvest. He said, "The
[41:14] harvest is ripe and the laborers are
[41:17] few. Pray the Lord of the harvest that
[41:21] he will send laborers into his harvest."
[41:24] Now, I'm going to just I want to get
[41:26] through these five quotes, and I'm
[41:27] trying to stop stopping trying to stop
[41:30] stopping because I want to I'm going to
[41:31] take the points I want to make about
[41:33] each quote, but I want to get the quotes
[41:35] consecutively. That way if I forget
[41:37] everything else, you've left and and
[41:38] have been benefited.
[41:40] Amen. So, and then when I get down to
[41:42] it, we'll cover as much as we can with
[41:44] the time we have. But I want you to
[41:46] absorb these quotes. All right? This
[41:48] will mean a little more to you in a few
[41:49] minutes. Just here's what I want you to
[41:51] get right now. You're part of God.
[41:54] You're active and part of God's program.
[41:57] Amen.
[41:57] Amen.
[42:00] Abraham's covenant confirmed 1961. Now,
[42:03] he's coming along. I'm moving this um uh
[42:06] in time. And now we find out last night
[42:08] that he was Abram until God blessed him
[42:11] and made him made a covenant with him
[42:13] and then he changed his name from Abram
[42:15] to Abraham and Ham was part of God's
[42:18] name. Did you notice that? Did did it
[42:20] ever soak down in Abraham. Elohim. See,
[42:26] he put part of God's name because God is
[42:29] a father of all and he made his name
[42:33] being Elohim. He put part of his name
[42:36] with Abraham. See, and made him a
[42:38] partner with him. Now, that's not a
[42:41] unique thought to William Brandt. Oh,
[42:42] well, this part of it is a is the
[42:46] furthest any commentator ever reached
[42:48] out. I searched back all the way this as
[42:51] a thought that God changed his name and
[42:55] added uh the Hebrew word in there which
[42:58] I think is h eh in the Hebrew. And
[43:01] brother Brandham is spot on with Jewish
[43:04] uh the Torah, the midish, all of that
[43:07] all the way back. Uh all of their they
[43:09] they've always knew that. The apostles
[43:11] talked about it. The early church
[43:13] fathers wrote about it. this very thing
[43:15] that God imparted part of his name into
[43:18] Abraham and that's where the age comes
[43:20] from. And so so but but brother Brandham
[43:24] actually is going to uh take it a little
[43:26] bit further but I'm not going there
[43:28] tonight because it's I I have that for
[43:30] Sunday. But I just want you to absorb
[43:32] this for a moment that that God put part
[43:36] of his name in a man so that that man
[43:41] would I would would would serve to
[43:45] identify who God is.
[43:47] Amen. Amen.
[43:49] So if I said it to you tonight, I would
[43:51] say, "How many believe the message of
[43:54] the hour?" And I would say, do you
[43:56] realize that the only ones that will
[43:59] believe the message of this hour, the
[44:01] only ones who have believed the message
[44:02] of any hour was Mrs. Jesus in every age?
[44:07] And if you're Mrs. Jesus, you are that.
[44:09] And believing the message of the hour is
[44:11] only an identifier that you are that,
[44:13] that you've always been that. But then
[44:15] that means that your life now becomes a
[44:18] testimony of Jesus.
[44:22] Amen. the real Jesus.
[44:25] Amen.
[44:26] Not the similar version, the the similar
[44:30] 33,000
[44:32] different similar versions of him,
[44:36] none of which will get anyone in a
[44:37] rapture.
[44:38] Amen.
[44:39] Because Jesus said when this gospel,
[44:42] Amen. Not 33,000 different versions that
[44:45] are slightly kind of similar.
[44:48] But when this gospel, what gospel was he
[44:51] talking about?
[44:52] What gospel was he? The word made flesh.
[44:56] So when you are believing the word made
[44:58] flesh and you are the word made flesh,
[45:00] when that gospel,
[45:03] a gospel that can turn the the people
[45:07] under the ministry of the son of man,
[45:09] the word is made flesh and written
[45:11] behind skin. And you are walking around
[45:14] with part of God's identity. You're
[45:16] operating in God's program. You've got a
[45:18] part of his name. You are the
[45:21] identifier.
[45:23] Amen.
[45:24] To the world.
[45:26] You are the lighthouse.
[45:29] You're the lower lights.
[45:31] The lower lights have to be burning. The
[45:33] the the lighthouse up on the hill serves
[45:36] at distance, but when they get into the
[45:38] shallows, they've got to have the lower
[45:39] lights.
[45:40] Amen.
[45:40] See, and I It's probably one of my
[45:43] favorite songs of all time that Sister
[45:45] Jean sung for years as a boy growing up.
[45:48] Let the lower lights be burning. I you
[45:51] don't get to hear it, but I still hear
[45:52] it in her young soprano voice uh that
[45:56] I'll know she'll have back. I love her
[45:58] voice now, but the voice that she had as
[46:01] a young woman sounded like running
[46:03] water. It was just it it sounded like
[46:05] angels and uh she she sang at the
[46:07] tabernacle for years as part of the
[46:09] Brandom Tabernacle Trio lead soprano.
[46:12] So, Sister Mom, I'm looking forward to
[46:15] Amen. running the hills of glory with
[46:17] you and getting outran by you and
[46:18] hearing you sing. Amen.
[46:21] Amen.
[46:22] Amen.
[46:24] That's a reality, friends.
[46:26] See, that ain't Disney World for me.
[46:27] That's for real.
[46:29] I know that's ahead of me.
[46:32] Um, all right. So, he says,
[46:36] uh, did I get all of that one? Yes. All
[46:38] right. Did you notice that? You ever let
[46:40] it soak in? Okay. So, he said, "And made
[46:44] him." Here's here's the line I want you
[46:45] to absorb. And he made his name being
[46:47] Elohim, he put part of his name with
[46:50] Abraham. See, and made him a partner
[46:54] with him.
[46:55] Amen.
[46:56] So when he made you Mrs. Jesus Christ,
[46:59] he made you a partner with Jesus Christ.
[47:02] See, you're not just a follower, you're
[47:05] a partner.
[47:06] All right. Now, here's another one.
[47:12] Christ is the mystery of God re uh God
[47:15] revealed.
[47:18] He is the first fruits of the
[47:20] resurrection. Is that right? Watch then
[47:23] what is he? He is the head of the body
[47:27] which is his church bride. So okay. So
[47:32] brother Brandham is just simply saying
[47:34] he's the first fruits of the
[47:35] resurrection.
[47:36] Amen.
[47:36] We believe that. Amen.
[47:38] Well, then it means there has to be more
[47:40] fruit coming.
[47:41] If he's the first there, you wouldn't
[47:43] say you'd just say he's the fruit, but
[47:44] he's the first fruits.
[47:46] Under the under Leviticus 23 type, he's
[47:49] the first fruits of the resurrection.
[47:51] That means there's there's more coming
[47:53] that that's that's of the same seed
[47:56] that brings forth the same life that
[47:58] brings forth the same fruit that can
[47:59] reproduce like he reproduced. Amen.
[48:01] See, so that being the case, then then
[48:05] he is the head of the body which is his
[48:08] church, his bride. Then the bride body
[48:11] must follow the head for it is part of
[48:14] his resurrection and part of the
[48:16] mystery. So you are, you say, I'm
[48:20] waiting for the resurrection. You're
[48:21] part of it. If he's the resurrection,
[48:23] you're part of the resurrection. Amen.
[48:26] See, then then if he's the mystery of
[48:28] redemption, then you're part of the
[48:30] mystery of redemption.
[48:31] That's right. Amen.
[48:33] It's impossible for it not to go.
[48:37] Oh my. It's part of God's mystery. So,
[48:41] so I'm not here today to say to you,
[48:44] listen, uh there's going to be a
[48:46] resurrection. We got a rapture coming.
[48:49] The bar is pretty high, but if you can
[48:51] endeavor and persevere and qualify, you
[48:53] just might get in. There's only a less
[48:56] than 1%, so your odds are pretty bad.
[48:59] Uh, but if you really try hard, you
[49:01] might get Let me try to get you to
[49:03] really try hard. So, I'd like to see you
[49:05] there, and I hope I make it, too. That's
[49:07] that's not even in the in the mindset of
[49:09] the believer. The mindset of the
[49:11] believer is I'm already a part of the
[49:13] resurrection. If the head resurrected, I
[49:17] have to resurrect.
[49:19] If nothing could hold him and nothing
[49:21] could, nothing can hold me.
[49:23] That's right. Amen. Wow. Amen.
[49:27] So, it's part of God's mystery how God
[49:30] revealed himself here and raised it up
[49:33] by the word. So, he reveals his church
[49:36] and raising it up by the same word. It's
[49:40] a part of his three-fold mystery. Now,
[49:44] there's the supporting quote to the one
[49:46] about you being in God's Godhead. You're
[49:48] a part of his three-fold mystery.
[49:50] Father, Son, Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost
[49:53] part is the part that produced the
[49:55] bride, Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[49:57] That's the mystery of redemption.
[49:59] That's what Paul said was was hidden for
[50:02] years, but now has been made known.
[50:05] Amen.
[50:06] And that that it wasn't just a Messiah
[50:08] was coming, a whole kingdom was coming.
[50:12] And there's going to and it wouldn't
[50:13] just be the Jews. It would go to the
[50:15] Gentiles because Abraham was said you
[50:17] you'll be a seed of many nations.
[50:21] Amen.
[50:22] So now you're I hope I'm drawing the
[50:24] picture for you. This ain't no joke.
[50:26] This is this is real real this is real
[50:29] life. This is what gives life purpose.
[50:33] Amen.
[50:36] And then here's the quote that we've
[50:38] read to you before. There is so many
[50:41] infallible proofs that Jesus is the
[50:43] place. He is the gate. He is the name
[50:45] and only provided way that God has for
[50:48] man to meet and worship. He is the way,
[50:50] the truth, the life, the gate, the door,
[50:52] the alpha omega, the beginning and
[50:54] ending, rose of Sharon, lily of the
[50:56] valley, morning star, the alpha omega.
[50:59] He is all the whole thing put together.
[51:03] He is both root and offspring of David,
[51:05] bright and morning star. In him dwells
[51:08] the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
[51:11] Where we in there are sons and daughters
[51:14] to God in God's Godhead. Yes. As sons
[51:18] and daughters, we're in the family if
[51:20] you're in there.
[51:22] So if you're in there, you're in the
[51:24] family. If you're in there, you're in
[51:26] there because you're in the family.
[51:29] All right.
[51:31] We rejoice over that.
[51:32] Oh yeah.
[51:34] But but what are the ramifications?
[51:40] So,
[51:42] one of the quotes I'll just refer to
[51:43] here. I decided on purpose not to put it
[51:45] up. I just wanted to read those uh five
[51:48] or so. I think we had five.
[51:50] Brother Brandham talks about in the
[51:52] church age book in the Leodysian age.
[51:53] And it's familiar to us how that the
[51:57] messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10
[52:01] that he would reveal uh what he what
[52:04] brother Brandham termed as mystery
[52:06] truths.
[52:08] Amen.
[52:08] And he says it, you know, concerning the
[52:11] seven thunders in Revelation 10, which
[52:13] are the revelations
[52:15] contained in the seven seals. That is so
[52:17] easy. I don't want people can't figure
[52:20] that out. It will be these divinely
[52:26] revealed mystery truths
[52:28] that literally
[52:31] not metaphorically.
[52:33] No,
[52:33] literally
[52:35] turn the hearts of the children to the
[52:38] Pentecostal fathers.
[52:39] Amen.
[52:42] these mystery truths that we feed on.
[52:45] These mystery truths that aren't that
[52:50] have have um that don't that they're not
[52:53] still mystery to you.
[52:56] Amen.
[52:56] Not because you understand the the the
[53:00] quote memorization or the doctrine or
[53:02] how it aligns. Even sometimes preachers
[53:04] have to go back and study it again. But
[53:07] you understand the mystery of redemption
[53:09] because it's happened to you.
[53:12] And it's changed you from what you were
[53:14] to what you are. And you know it has.
[53:20] You know, an invasion force that invades
[53:24] any country is much more effective.
[53:27] We've known this whenever whenever
[53:29] there's been a war, whenever we've had
[53:31] to occupy a country, when any country
[53:32] has had to do that. If you want to be
[53:34] successful,
[53:36] you can be more more effective as an
[53:38] occupational force if you can win over
[53:42] the hearts and minds of the people. And
[53:45] so these mystery truths are given to set
[53:50] our hearts uh and minds free so that we
[53:55] can live above the the shadows, the deep
[53:59] deep shadows of life. This life is just
[54:01] filled with quandries and questions and
[54:04] conundrums and sadness and sorrow and we
[54:08] and we're interspersed with some times
[54:10] of happiness and joy and we have plenty
[54:11] of those and we we're always maneuvering
[54:13] to try to get as many happy moments as
[54:15] we can. Try as you might run as hard as
[54:17] you want, make as much money as you can
[54:19] put in a bank, you're still going to be
[54:21] a few days and full of trouble.
[54:24] Amen. There's something in a believer
[54:27] that says, "I got to do more than just
[54:29] than just be a red carpet person in this
[54:32] life." If that's all there is, no wonder
[54:34] they commit suicide.
[54:37] No wonder they they kill themselves at
[54:39] in their mid-50s with drugs and fast
[54:41] living. No wonder those kinds of things
[54:43] happen to them
[54:45] because they're trying to satisfy a
[54:47] crave. They're trying to spend money to
[54:49] satisfy a crave that you got for free
[54:52] and that you stand here and sit here
[54:54] tonight and rejoice in.
[54:57] Like Job, I know my redeemer liveth. Oh,
[55:00] what a joy that is. What a consolation
[55:03] to know. Job, in spite of all of his
[55:06] trouble, he he settled. He said, "But at
[55:08] least I know my redeemer liveth."
[55:11] In other words, I know this can't last.
[55:13] This too shall pass. I my future is
[55:16] bright no matter what the devil can
[55:18] throw at me here.
[55:20] Amen.
[55:22] So we have these mystery truths to set
[55:26] our hearts and our minds free to lift us
[55:29] up above the shadows.
[55:32] So the ramifications for our daily
[55:34] lives. I think that these quotes were a
[55:38] part of God. We've been given a name
[55:40] change. We're part of his program. We're
[55:42] part of his three-fold mystery. We're
[55:44] part of his godhead. You know, uh, you
[55:47] know, I when I when I think about it is
[55:51] I I said to myself today, what are the
[55:54] ramifications of my life realizing those
[55:57] things are true? Or at least how can I
[56:00] live in alignment with these truths?
[56:04] Yes. Amen.
[56:05] Because I may not really know everything
[56:08] I should do or the direction. And I
[56:10] don't even know what's going to happen
[56:11] tomorrow. But let me just say, Lord God,
[56:15] help me to be align my life with these
[56:19] mystery truths
[56:20] because these mystery truths are what is
[56:23] literally going to turn me back.
[56:28] I can't tell you what your day holds
[56:31] tomorrow. I can't tell you what
[56:33] challenges you might face tomorrow. And
[56:35] I I won't be there alongside you to pat
[56:37] you on the back and encourage you, but I
[56:40] but I can help you right now. I can help
[56:42] you right now if you want to be helped
[56:44] right now.
[56:47] Would you like to be helped this
[56:48] evening?
[56:50] Would you be willing? Are you willing
[56:52] when you come to church, are you willing
[56:54] to open up your mind to the teaching of
[56:56] God's word?
[56:58] Are you willing to open up your heart to
[57:00] the Holy Ghost and let him Can I say it
[57:02] like this? Not to insult you, but let
[57:04] him teach you about life. Let him teach
[57:06] you what life really is and how it
[57:08] should really be lived. Let him teach
[57:10] you about your life. There's lots of
[57:12] questions you have, questions you would
[57:14] never even tell me you got. And I got
[57:16] questions about my life. Why this? Why
[57:18] that? How about this? How about that?
[57:19] What about this? What's going on? I I
[57:21] got those questions. I'm a human. I'm a
[57:23] mortal. Same as you. But I I know I'm
[57:25] connected to some source that has the
[57:27] answers.
[57:29] And I trust him.
[57:31] I trust him. Yes,
[57:33] I can help you right now to be ready for
[57:35] tomorrow or any day afterward there or
[57:38] any challenge that Satan can throw at
[57:40] you and he will
[57:43] or at least he will try.
[57:46] So, brother Brandon was talking about
[57:48] there in our first quote, a man being
[57:50] born again, just think about that,
[57:53] becomes a part of God. He's just as
[57:55] eternal as God is eternal. I mean that
[58:00] just that is just an unbreakable
[58:02] identity. When you realize that I like
[58:06] Jesus, I came from God. I go back to
[58:09] God. That is an unbreakable identity
[58:12] that if you are born again, if you're
[58:15] born again, then your identity
[58:19] is not temporary.
[58:21] Amen.
[58:21] In fact, is the last thing that your
[58:24] identity that you are now is temporary.
[58:27] Amen. humanity. When you're born of a
[58:30] woman, you're temporary.
[58:32] Amen.
[58:33] You've got a shelf life. You've got a
[58:35] date that every man, there's already in
[58:38] God's mind a tombstone with your name
[58:40] and the date you expired.
[58:43] You understand? But when you're born of
[58:46] God, you're no longer temporary. You are
[58:49] you're still a human being, but you
[58:51] realize you have a divine origin.
[58:55] You're part of God. You're sharing
[58:57] actually already sharing. I'm not
[58:59] waiting to share it. I'm already sharing
[59:02] his life.
[59:05] You know, it is it is often said and
[59:11] true to a degree that we should uh allow
[59:17] neither our failures or our personal
[59:20] failures or personal trauma. We all have
[59:24] him.
[59:24] Oh yeah. Amen.
[59:26] And that, you know, we're encouraged
[59:28] never to let those episodes of trauma in
[59:31] our life or those personal failures in
[59:34] our life. We're always told, don't let
[59:36] that define you. And that's good advice.
[59:38] Don't let that define you. My failure is
[59:40] not does not define me. I've had plenty
[59:42] of failures. I'm glad it doesn't define
[59:44] me. I'm glad I'm a better person than my
[59:47] failures. That's why David said to the
[59:49] Lord, "Don't judge me by my works. Don't
[59:51] define me by my failures. I don't have a
[59:53] chance if you do that. judge me by my
[59:55] heart that loves you.
[59:59] But it can be very helpful
[1:00:00] psychologically. But but but hey, you
[1:00:03] know, the truth of the matter is it's
[1:00:05] often easier said than done
[1:00:08] uh to prevent these kinds of things uh
[1:00:11] from flowing into our self-esteem or
[1:00:13] creeping into our mental outlook about
[1:00:16] life. Am I wrong?
[1:00:18] See,
[1:00:20] but I want to say to you tonight that
[1:00:22] even if that is true
[1:00:25] and even if you have already allowed
[1:00:28] those dangerous effects to define you,
[1:00:31] could I suggest something to you tonight
[1:00:34] that could literally redefine who you
[1:00:37] are?
[1:00:39] Oh, that I want you to see that there's
[1:00:41] an awareness. I I know this I know this
[1:00:45] by experience that yes, I've had plenty
[1:00:47] of failures as have we all. But I also
[1:00:50] am aware that there is a faith in the
[1:00:54] word that is deep in my heart that I
[1:00:57] know is is just simply beyond me.
[1:01:02] And I don't know how to say it plainer.
[1:01:04] There's a faith in the word that's just
[1:01:06] beyond me.
[1:01:08] And my and my failures should creep in
[1:01:10] and define me. and my trauma should
[1:01:13] creep in and define me. But it doesn't
[1:01:15] define me. I've been redefined by the
[1:01:18] word of God.
[1:01:19] That's right.
[1:01:20] Amen.
[1:01:21] When I read brother Brandham saying from
[1:01:23] communion, but yet all at once I looked
[1:01:26] up and I said, I'm not the son of
[1:01:28] Charles and Ella Brandom, there's
[1:01:30] something calling me. I'm here to tell
[1:01:32] you something, friends. I realize that
[1:01:34] I'm I'm not just a sinner trying to do
[1:01:36] better. That I'm actually a firstborn
[1:01:39] son of God Almighty. Amen.
[1:01:41] I it it those those things don't define
[1:01:44] me. I'm not a sinner trying to do
[1:01:45] better. That's not why I'm a Christian.
[1:01:47] That's not why I'm a church at church.
[1:01:48] That's not why I follow Jesus. I do more
[1:01:51] than just admire his fine qualities.
[1:01:55] I'm not just trying to imitate his fine
[1:01:57] qualities. There's something more that I
[1:02:00] see about myself that my life is a
[1:02:03] continuation of Christ on the earth.
[1:02:06] Again, you say with your failures, you
[1:02:08] can think that I'm not defined by my
[1:02:11] failures. I'm defined by my faith in the
[1:02:14] word.
[1:02:15] Amen.
[1:02:17] I realize that I'm connected to the
[1:02:19] divine. I realize
[1:02:21] Hallelujah.
[1:02:22] Oh, I realize that I'm living
[1:02:25] from a source like you and I. We're
[1:02:28] living from a source.
[1:02:30] It's connected somewhere to a source
[1:02:32] beyond this world.
[1:02:33] Amen.
[1:02:35] I say that very truthfully.
[1:02:39] There's no way that I could I don't
[1:02:41] think any of us could I don't think any
[1:02:43] of us could hope. I know David didn't
[1:02:45] hope based on his works he could make
[1:02:47] it.
[1:02:48] I know that every time, you know, when
[1:02:51] when Jesus made himself known and Peter
[1:02:54] caught who he was, you know, Peter
[1:02:57] didn't he wasn't interested in, you
[1:03:00] know, being a a follower. He said,
[1:03:02] "Lord, go away from me. I I don't even
[1:03:05] feel like I can be around a man as holy
[1:03:07] as you. Just go away from me. I'm a
[1:03:10] sinful man." But you see, Jesus saw a
[1:03:12] alltogether different person than Peter
[1:03:16] saw.
[1:03:16] Amen.
[1:03:17] When Peter looked in the water and saw
[1:03:19] his reflection, Jesus saw all together
[1:03:21] different different Peter.
[1:03:24] Do you realize tonight there's a whole
[1:03:25] different version of you that one of
[1:03:27] these days you're going to step into it?
[1:03:29] You're going to step into it, friends.
[1:03:31] There's nothing the devil can do to stop
[1:03:32] it. There's a confidence in in the
[1:03:35] security of the believer because eternal
[1:03:38] life is not a it's not a a a future
[1:03:41] reward. It's not it's I mean it is I
[1:03:44] suppose we could look at it like that,
[1:03:45] but it's more than just a a future
[1:03:48] reward. Eternal life to me is a present
[1:03:49] reality.
[1:03:51] I'm already part of the resurrection.
[1:03:55] Just as Jesus was saying, I am the
[1:03:57] resurrection. So, we're able to live
[1:04:00] daily with the assurance. We're able to
[1:04:02] live a life that doesn't fear death. I
[1:04:05] don't fear I don't fear judgment. And I
[1:04:08] and I and let me just say this. I don't
[1:04:10] live in fear of failure.
[1:04:12] Amen.
[1:04:12] I I I don't serve God because I don't
[1:04:15] want to go to hell.
[1:04:17] Brother Brandham said, you say, "Oh, I
[1:04:19] don't want to go go to hell." Brother
[1:04:20] said, "Of course you don't want to go to
[1:04:21] hell." But that's not why you serve God.
[1:04:23] I'm so glad tonight it's not fear-based.
[1:04:25] I'm not here because of fear I'll miss a
[1:04:28] rapture or fear that I'm going to go to
[1:04:30] hell. I don't serve God because of that.
[1:04:32] I'm I'm bound by the chains of love. And
[1:04:35] I'm and I'm happy and I don't need
[1:04:37] rescuing and I don't need anyone uh to
[1:04:40] to to set me free. I'm happily bound
[1:04:44] to this one.
[1:04:45] Amen.
[1:04:48] I'm called to reflect his nature.
[1:04:51] Being a part of God demands conduct
[1:04:54] worthy of his nature. Do you agree?
[1:04:57] Four of you. Four of you.
[1:05:01] Being a part of God demands conduct
[1:05:03] worthy of his nature. Do you agree?
[1:05:06] Truthfulness, holiness, love,
[1:05:10] patience. Uh if anything is is true,
[1:05:15] I suppose about this sermon, I I I I
[1:05:19] tried to to say what is the most what is
[1:05:23] the kernel of this sermon tonight?
[1:05:28] And that would be that if there's I I if
[1:05:31] anything is true
[1:05:34] is that we represent his life in heaven
[1:05:39] on earth.
[1:05:39] Amen. Amen.
[1:05:42] Did you catch that?
[1:05:44] We are here as representatives of his
[1:05:46] life in heaven, but we're on earth.
[1:05:49] See, because Jesus isn't coming back to
[1:05:52] earth again until it's in the latter
[1:05:55] part of the tribulation. So, the world
[1:05:58] will never see him put his foot on this
[1:06:00] earth again. when he ascended 20
[1:06:03] centuries ago, they will never see him
[1:06:06] again walking this earth until it's the
[1:06:09] latter part stages of the tribulation
[1:06:12] period. And by then, it's way too late.
[1:06:15] So, who is reflecting his light that's
[1:06:18] in heaven now? If it's not his bride?
[1:06:21] Amen.
[1:06:22] If not you, who?
[1:06:24] Why don't you just say that? Let's say
[1:06:26] that to yourself. If not me, then who?
[1:06:29] If I'm not going to serve him, who will?
[1:06:31] Lord, you know, have they not heard?
[1:06:34] Yay, their sound went into all the
[1:06:36] earth, but with many of them he was not
[1:06:39] well pleased.
[1:06:41] But I want to be pleasing.
[1:06:45] I don't want to even let that pass you
[1:06:47] by without deeply thinking about it.
[1:06:49] Friends, be before I move to the next
[1:06:52] category, I don't want to just pass that
[1:06:54] over. I want you to really deeply take
[1:06:57] that in tonight to your soul. And if you
[1:07:00] only leave with that, then you've left
[1:07:01] with the kernel of my thought.
[1:07:04] Is that we are here to represent his
[1:07:07] life that's there, but we got to
[1:07:10] represent it here.
[1:07:12] And does my life it's it it rolls off of
[1:07:16] our tongue too easy because it's a title
[1:07:18] to brother Brandham's sermon. Is your
[1:07:20] life worthy of the gospel? And a lot of
[1:07:22] times when we say those words, we're
[1:07:24] just quoting a sermon title. But stop
[1:07:27] quoting the sermon title. look at
[1:07:29] yourself in the mirror and ask you the
[1:07:31] question, "Hey, you, is your life worthy
[1:07:36] of the gospel?"
[1:07:40] We preach because it's part of his
[1:07:42] program.
[1:07:43] Gives me a purpose. It gives me a
[1:07:46] participation.
[1:07:48] It it it's my life in God's redemptive
[1:07:51] plan. And and although that although
[1:07:53] that he knows everything and and and he
[1:07:56] he but he uses human instruments, I I
[1:07:59] didn't come up with that idea for me to
[1:08:01] be a preacher. I didn't come up with the
[1:08:03] idea in fact is humanly speaking I agree
[1:08:06] with the Bible. I call it the
[1:08:08] foolishness of preaching.
[1:08:10] That a less than perfect man is trying
[1:08:13] to perfect less than perfect people.
[1:08:16] Amen.
[1:08:19] I I've never figured that one out.
[1:08:22] But I'm called to speak. I'm called to
[1:08:25] labor. I'm called to influence others.
[1:08:27] And I want to say this, friends. Th this
[1:08:30] is the part that Satan attacks in mass.
[1:08:35] Amen.
[1:08:35] Because I it's not just about preaching
[1:08:37] in a pullpit. Your life is a sermon.
[1:08:40] Yeah,
[1:08:41] you're just as much responsible to God
[1:08:44] to preach the gospel through your life
[1:08:46] as I am in a pullpit.
[1:08:48] My pullpit ministry is God's tool to
[1:08:51] rightly divide the word of truth
[1:08:53] through a divine gift.
[1:08:55] But your duty takes it from there and
[1:08:59] lives it so that when people who never
[1:09:01] come hear me preach hear me preach when
[1:09:04] they see you
[1:09:05] and they know you, they know they can't
[1:09:07] deny. Can could would people be
[1:09:10] hardpressed
[1:09:12] to believe William Brandham was a false
[1:09:15] prophet if they knew you?
[1:09:17] Come on.
[1:09:22] I think they should be.
[1:09:23] That's right.
[1:09:24] I think they should feel very hardressed
[1:09:26] to believe
[1:09:28] that he was false if they know me.
[1:09:30] Amen.
[1:09:31] If they know that it's that it's that
[1:09:33] ministry that I have fed on my whole
[1:09:35] life since a boy. And if my character
[1:09:38] doesn't testify,
[1:09:40] Jesus said, "If you don't believe me,
[1:09:42] believe the works." They testify of me.
[1:09:45] See, so this is so you can imagine
[1:09:50] it shouldn't surprise you that Satan
[1:09:52] would attack that
[1:09:54] that that that display
[1:09:58] of the truth.
[1:09:59] Amen.
[1:09:59] You know, it's it's just like Iran's
[1:10:01] strategy to overwhelm Israel's missile
[1:10:03] defense system. Not trying to go
[1:10:05] political tonight. I'm just saying you
[1:10:06] you're familiar with it. It's in the
[1:10:08] headlines. And so Israel has four or
[1:10:10] five different kinds of defensive
[1:10:12] systems. David Sling and they got a
[1:10:15] whole bunch of different names for them.
[1:10:16] They shoot missiles to kill a missile.
[1:10:17] And and and so Iran just says, "We'll
[1:10:21] just send so many it. They'll they'll
[1:10:24] knock down, you know, we'll send a
[1:10:25] hundred and they'll knock down 90, but
[1:10:27] 10 will get through. We'll send a
[1:10:29] thousand and they'll knock down 900, but
[1:10:31] a 100 will get through." And so that's
[1:10:34] exactly what the what the devil does
[1:10:36] with with his ballistic missiles and his
[1:10:39] rockets and his kamicazi drones. And
[1:10:42] then he's got all kinds of proxies in
[1:10:44] your life perfectly positioned to bomb
[1:10:46] you all at once.
[1:10:51] He sends missile after missile. He sends
[1:10:54] work missiles, uh, kamicazi career
[1:10:57] drones. He sent, you know, he he's got
[1:11:00] he's got every possible way uh program.
[1:11:03] He'll he he's got he's got missiles
[1:11:05] aimed at educational programs.
[1:11:08] Come on, say amen.
[1:11:12] Every new opportunity that you just
[1:11:14] can't pass up on.
[1:11:17] Amen.
[1:11:18] Social media interaction missiles,
[1:11:20] social social public interaction
[1:11:22] missiles, entertainment missile after
[1:11:25] entertainment missile after
[1:11:26] entertainment missile after
[1:11:27] entertainment missile
[1:11:29] until he has until he has set fire to
[1:11:33] every block of your time that you needed
[1:11:36] to get close to God
[1:11:38] and burned it to the ground. and you
[1:11:41] collapse in the bed and go the next day
[1:11:43] at the same pace and you fall into
[1:11:46] church on a Sunday and maybe you might
[1:11:48] make it for a Wednesday and but even if
[1:11:50] you do uh he he's he's taking Monday and
[1:11:54] Tuesday and Thursday and Friday and
[1:11:56] Saturday with missile and drone and
[1:11:58] missile and drone and the you got I'm
[1:12:01] here to tell you something friends
[1:12:02] you're going to need more than a
[1:12:04] man-made defense. You're going to need a
[1:12:06] supernatural hand that can fend all of
[1:12:09] that off and keep you on fire for the
[1:12:11] Lord.
[1:12:12] Amen.
[1:12:14] But you've got to be a participant in
[1:12:16] it.
[1:12:17] Yes. Amen. Come on.
[1:12:22] I don't preach because uh
[1:12:27] I I preach to serve as a witness. So
[1:12:29] it's not I I'm I mean I'm a preacher
[1:12:33] that has been told go preach with no
[1:12:35] guaranteed results.
[1:12:40] Imagine that. Imagine if that was your
[1:12:42] life and the Lord said and called you
[1:12:44] from a young boy and said someday you'll
[1:12:47] preach the gospel. How many how how much
[1:12:51] success will I have? Lord, I don't call
[1:12:53] you to be successful.
[1:12:55] I call you to be faithful.
[1:12:56] Amen. Well, surely I can count on the
[1:12:58] fact that No, you can't. You can only
[1:13:00] count on me.
[1:13:02] You can only count on my word. I just
[1:13:05] need you to serve me. I just need you to
[1:13:07] go forward. I need you to dedicate your
[1:13:09] life. I'll take care of all the rest.
[1:13:11] You just walk forward. Just keep going
[1:13:13] forward. Just keep trusting you and I'll
[1:13:16] reward you at the end. I never promised
[1:13:17] it'd be easy. I promise you it'll be
[1:13:19] worth it.
[1:13:22] Amen.
[1:13:23] It's my assignment. It's not an
[1:13:25] achievement. If I if I fill this church
[1:13:27] up and we tripled the size of it and I
[1:13:29] filled that up, it has nothing to do
[1:13:30] with me. Preaching and winning souls to
[1:13:33] Christ is not an achievement, preachers,
[1:13:36] it's a it's not an achievement. It's an
[1:13:38] assignment.
[1:13:41] See,
[1:13:42] the harvest is ripe. And and and when
[1:13:45] the when when I hear Jesus saying the
[1:13:47] harvest isn't planted, the harvest isn't
[1:13:50] growing. When this gospel has been
[1:13:53] preached to all the world, the harvest
[1:13:55] is ripe. That that tells me it's urgent.
[1:13:58] Get out there. Be a laborer in the
[1:14:00] field. We don't have much time left.
[1:14:02] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[1:14:04] We never expected to be in 2025. And if
[1:14:06] we're here next year, it'll be another
[1:14:07] year we didn't expect. I just say, Lord,
[1:14:10] with whatever time we have, I know it
[1:14:12] can't be much, but let me run it hard.
[1:14:14] Let me run it fast. Let me be a hot. Let
[1:14:16] me be a Let me be a a ministry of the
[1:14:18] morning star
[1:14:20] to the world.
[1:14:22] Amen.
[1:14:23] We're partners. As brother Brandham
[1:14:25] said, he put his name in Abraham, made
[1:14:28] him a partner with him. I got to close.
[1:14:31] It's okay. Uh I'm going to carry on
[1:14:33] Sunday.
[1:14:36] But he put a part I'm going to stop
[1:14:37] right here for tonight.
[1:14:40] He put a part of his name in Abram.
[1:14:46] Do you know that according to the Jewish
[1:14:48] rabbis
[1:14:50] that and I've got I've got the sources.
[1:14:52] I'm not even sure I could pronounce half
[1:14:54] of them. I probably need Jason here to
[1:14:56] help me. But but according to all the
[1:14:59] rabbitical commentary on the and the
[1:15:02] Torah on all the books of Moses and all
[1:15:05] the laws of the prophets that were
[1:15:07] recorded in the Old Testament,
[1:15:10] they all had this one common rule
[1:15:16] and that is
[1:15:19] that
[1:15:20] when God put a part of his name
[1:15:25] in Abram,
[1:15:27] that the Hebrew word that brother
[1:15:30] Brandon was referring to, brother
[1:15:31] Brandon was trying to get the
[1:15:33] theological world to understand that
[1:15:35] they said it was the exact same Hebrew
[1:15:39] word that God used in creation.
[1:15:43] The very the very the very substance of
[1:15:46] creation. God was adding his creation,
[1:15:49] his creativeness to Abram.
[1:15:52] Amen. because he was going to have to do
[1:15:55] something that wasn't possible for him.
[1:15:57] It was going to take some part of God to
[1:15:59] get it done. You've got a mission you
[1:16:02] cannot complete. But you've got an
[1:16:04] element of almighty God that he's placed
[1:16:06] in you. It's the very element Jesus was
[1:16:09] talking about when he gave the parable
[1:16:11] there in Matthew 13, I think it is,
[1:16:14] where the sewer went forth to sew and he
[1:16:16] swed the the wheat and then he went away
[1:16:19] and then an enemy came in and swed the
[1:16:20] tears. You remember that parable? And
[1:16:23] they asked Jesus, "What's the
[1:16:24] interpretation?" He said, "It's easy.
[1:16:26] The the field is the world. The sewer of
[1:16:28] the good seed is the son of man. The
[1:16:30] wheat are the children of the kingdom.
[1:16:32] The sewer of the weeds is the devil. And
[1:16:35] the and the and the the the ones that
[1:16:37] come from that are the children of the
[1:16:38] devil." Yeah.
[1:16:39] And and so so you you'd be you can't
[1:16:43] believe the the the deer in the
[1:16:44] headlights look that when I was sitting
[1:16:47] there in that steakhouse all them years
[1:16:49] ago with our Baptist antagonist, we had
[1:16:52] to have a public meeting down here at
[1:16:54] the university just to settle the
[1:16:55] matter. And finally they started leaving
[1:16:57] us alone.
[1:16:59] And when I'm trying to explain to him
[1:17:02] about the gene of God and the life of
[1:17:03] God and he said, "Are you mean to try to
[1:17:05] tell me that there are people in this
[1:17:08] world who are children of God and people
[1:17:09] in this world who are children of the
[1:17:11] devil?" And he was ridiculing that. And
[1:17:14] I said, "Well, no, I don't teach that.
[1:17:15] I'm just saying that Jesus taught that."
[1:17:18] And he I said, "That's not my teaching.
[1:17:20] That's the teaching of Christ." He said,
[1:17:22] "Jesus never taught that." And I just
[1:17:23] grabbed his Bible because I didn't have
[1:17:25] one. I flipped it over to Matthew 13 and
[1:17:28] the the the the ser of the good seed is
[1:17:30] the son of man and the weed are the
[1:17:32] children of the kingdom and the sewer of
[1:17:34] the weeds is the devil and he's got
[1:17:36] children of his kingdom
[1:17:39] and you know and and and so it wasn't a
[1:17:41] struggle for me and and it's and it's
[1:17:44] not like oh I'm in you're out it's not
[1:17:47] nothing like that it's that I have come
[1:17:49] to a recognition that I would I would
[1:17:52] like to be able to transmit to you I'm
[1:17:54] hoping that you'll open your mind and
[1:17:56] your heart to say God loves you. What's
[1:17:58] more than just Jesus loves me. This I
[1:18:00] know for the Bible tells me so. You can
[1:18:02] be you can have an intrinsic reality.
[1:18:04] You can be a living experience.
[1:18:07] The ministry of the morning star was so
[1:18:09] that the word could become flesh again
[1:18:14] and from that hour. So, so when when
[1:18:17] Jesus is talking about those seeds that
[1:18:19] get sown and grow the children of the
[1:18:21] kingdom, that's a direct correlation to
[1:18:23] the Old Testament of God putting a part
[1:18:27] of his creation identity into Abra into
[1:18:31] Abram and now called his name Abraham.
[1:18:34] And according to all the Jewish rabbis,
[1:18:36] it became from that hour unlawful to
[1:18:41] ever call him Abram again.
[1:18:46] No matter how much he stumbled, and he
[1:18:48] did. Even after he got a name change, he
[1:18:50] still had issues. But it was never
[1:18:53] allowed to call him Abram again. That
[1:18:56] life and that identity was gone.
[1:19:01] And it was, as far as God was concerned,
[1:19:04] illegal. No prophet ever called him that
[1:19:06] again. It was illegal to do that. And
[1:19:09] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[1:19:10] Once you got a name change and became
[1:19:12] Mrs. Jesus Christ. It is illegal for
[1:19:14] Satan to ever refer to you to God as the
[1:19:16] same person you used to be. And the Lord
[1:19:19] says that is not that person anymore.
[1:19:21] The record you've got is a person that
[1:19:23] no longer exists.
[1:19:25] Hallelujah. I'm a new creation.
[1:19:29] Amen.
[1:19:30] Oh, let's stand to our feet, friends. I
[1:19:32] sorry I ran out of time tonight, but I I
[1:19:34] just didn't want to go over it so
[1:19:35] quickly that we missed it. And I I'll
[1:19:38] continue on uh Sunday, but I I just
[1:19:41] wanted to come with this tonight just so
[1:19:44] that we could begin to so that so that
[1:19:47] Sunday we don't get into such a upper
[1:19:50] atmosphere along the edge of the
[1:19:52] atmosphere altitude that we don't
[1:19:54] realize we lose sight of the fact that
[1:19:57] we're not here to with just wow factor.
[1:20:01] It is true that you're going to hear
[1:20:03] from any message pullpit. You're going
[1:20:05] to hear things you don't you don't
[1:20:07] you're guaranteed not to hear in the
[1:20:09] average Sunday morning pullpit.
[1:20:11] But it's not for the sake of that,
[1:20:13] right?
[1:20:14] It's for the sake of making you a new
[1:20:16] creation. The word has creative power.
[1:20:19] It's not just doctrine. It's it's a
[1:20:22] living essence that when the mystery
[1:20:24] truths are unfolded to you and you
[1:20:27] believe them and begin to begin to not
[1:20:30] just believe them, but begin to live by
[1:20:32] them. Did you know that's what it means
[1:20:34] to really eat the word of God is when
[1:20:36] you start living by it, you become the
[1:20:39] living word. Every engine has to have
[1:20:42] intake and exhaust. You've got to you've
[1:20:45] got to have an intake and and an outflow
[1:20:47] to the world.
[1:20:49] A lot of times people's engines don't
[1:20:51] run very good because outflow is blocked
[1:20:54] up.
[1:20:55] Amen.
[1:20:56] Cadillac converters get plugged up and
[1:20:58] they the car the engine can't exhaust.
[1:21:01] People can't witness. They never
[1:21:03] witness. So then they don't want to
[1:21:04] witness and and they don't want to stand
[1:21:07] out. People get embarrassed over the
[1:21:09] message of the hour. When it's eternal
[1:21:11] life and you're you're trying to get a
[1:21:14] world that's doomed and you're
[1:21:16] embarrassed over it,
[1:21:18] friends, you're you're the only hope the
[1:21:20] dark world has. Jesus ain't coming back
[1:21:23] to see them or correct them until it's
[1:21:26] too late. He's got you here for that
[1:21:30] right now.
[1:21:33] You accept it?
[1:21:34] Amen.
[1:21:35] Amen. Amen. What song are you going to
[1:21:37] sing, Anthony? Uh uh let me switch you
[1:21:40] up. Can I switch you up? Um brother
[1:21:42] Andrew, let's go with uh I feel the
[1:21:44] pull. Brother Paula Fontaine's song, I
[1:21:47] feel the pull. Amen. Come on and gather.
[1:21:49] It's already um 22 minutes till I feel
[1:21:53] the pull.
[1:21:55] Let's sing that. I feel the
[1:22:02] I hear
[1:22:04] I hear the call.
[1:22:07] [Music]
[1:22:10] And I know
[1:22:12] And I know his spirit.
[1:22:16] Oh, it's moving me
[1:22:18] to give
[1:22:19] to give
[1:22:21] my all.
[1:22:26] He speaks to me.
[1:22:31] Oh, do you agree tonight?
[1:22:34] And I
[1:22:38] [Music]
[1:22:42] Lord please come
[1:22:46] take control.
[1:22:49] I feel the
[1:22:51] the poor.
[1:22:53] I feel the poor once more. I feel the
[1:22:59] voice.
[1:23:03] I hear the call.
[1:23:12] And I know his spirit move
[1:23:18] to give
[1:23:20] my
[1:23:21] my all. Yes, Lord. My all. my own. He
[1:23:26] speaks to me. Oh granite Lord speak to
[1:23:31] us tonight Lord
[1:23:33] and I
[1:23:39] [Music]
[1:23:41] Lord please

[1:24:40] Join with somebody standing near you.
[1:24:42] Let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[1:24:46] Lord God, we thank you tonight. Father,
[1:24:50] I thank you for the blessing of being
[1:24:52] able to preach your word. I'm grateful
[1:24:55] to you, Lord. So tired in body and mind
[1:24:58] today, but Lord, you were faithful. I
[1:25:00] ask you before stepping onto the
[1:25:02] platform, Lord, you'd have to take it.
[1:25:03] And you you knew the the shape my mind
[1:25:06] and my body was in physically, just
[1:25:08] weary and tired from preaching and
[1:25:10] traveling, coming home from overseas.
[1:25:13] Lord, I can testify from the moment we
[1:25:15] read the scripture. I immediately felt
[1:25:17] the surge of the Holy Spirit. Lord, it
[1:25:19] began to anoint me. I almost wanted to
[1:25:21] preach from the very text we read and
[1:25:24] ignore my notes. So strong was your
[1:25:26] anointing here, Lord. Now, you've
[1:25:28] delivered the word that you wanted
[1:25:30] delivered tonight. Not the word that I
[1:25:32] wanted to to deliver, but you the word
[1:25:35] you wanted to deliver. And I'm sorry I
[1:25:37] couldn't get it finished. We'll carry on
[1:25:39] Sunday. If there's a Sunday, Lord, in
[1:25:42] our future, we'll carry on. Father, we
[1:25:45] we look for the coming of the Lord. As
[1:25:47] brother Brandham said, I I look for him
[1:25:50] daily. I'm always watching the eastern
[1:25:52] sky. Lord, I'm not looking for some new
[1:25:56] revival to sweep the earth. We've got
[1:25:58] the last revival the gentile world will
[1:26:01] see before the bride goes home. So Lord,
[1:26:04] I'm asking tonight that the word that
[1:26:06] was preached be effectual in the
[1:26:09] people's lives. May they go from here
[1:26:12] tonight, Lord, and think deeply on the
[1:26:15] and and ponder for hours, Lord. And
[1:26:18] tomorrow, I won't be with them. Whatever
[1:26:20] they'll face, may they ponder the
[1:26:23] challenges that they heard in the word
[1:26:24] of God tonight.
[1:26:28] I commit it to you, Lord. I commit the
[1:26:31] needs, Father. Sister Jean and Sister
[1:26:33] Rachel have unspoken requests that you
[1:26:36] know all too well what they are, Lord.
[1:26:38] And I know one of them and the other I'm
[1:26:40] I don't know. But Father, you know them
[1:26:43] very well, Lord God. And I pray that
[1:26:46] that you will see to these needs, Lord.
[1:26:48] We call out uh Brother Miles and Sister
[1:26:52] Christina before you right now, Lord.
[1:26:54] And we ask in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:26:57] that they be healed. Lord, defeat this
[1:26:59] sickness, Lord, that has has affected
[1:27:02] the home of Brother Travis and Sister
[1:27:04] Deborah. Lord, may you eradicate it,
[1:27:06] Father. It's a a time and lots of new
[1:27:09] babies coming. And Lord, we're just
[1:27:11] praying for strength and mercy and
[1:27:13] health in our homes and in their lives.
[1:27:15] We commit these things into your capable
[1:27:18] hands. Lord, be merciful to us. Help us
[1:27:21] tomorrow, Lord, in the days to come that
[1:27:24] we might realize, Lord. I pray tonight
[1:27:26] that Lord, those who were perhaps
[1:27:29] listening on the stream, Lord, and even
[1:27:32] the comments I I made about people who
[1:27:35] should have been here, could have been
[1:27:36] here. I don't say that to be rude, Lord.
[1:27:39] You know my heart. But the but but
[1:27:41] correction begins at the house of the
[1:27:43] Lord. It's only out of concern and love
[1:27:46] that I say these things, Lord. They're
[1:27:48] not said in a harsh way. Not from my
[1:27:50] heart. I don't mean it like that, Lord.
[1:27:52] I love these people and I I I I we love
[1:27:56] you, Lord. And we are so grateful for
[1:27:58] your word. We just want we just ask you
[1:28:00] to help us to be that word. Lord, help
[1:28:03] us to allow ourselves we get ourselves
[1:28:06] out of the way and not be such victims
[1:28:09] to all of Satan's missiles and his
[1:28:11] kamicazi drones and they pile in on our
[1:28:14] lives and burn up all of our time, Lord,
[1:28:17] that we could spend drawing close to
[1:28:19] you. No wonder we live sometimes at
[1:28:23] distance from you. We don't mean to be
[1:28:25] that way, but we find ourselves too
[1:28:27] often that way. Help us, Lord. Help us,
[1:28:30] I pray. We commit it to you in Jesus
[1:28:33] name. I feel the pull. I feel the
[1:28:41] [Music]
[1:28:42] Oh, I hear you.
[1:28:47] Oh, don't you love that call tonight?
[1:28:51] And I know his
[1:28:56] move in me
[1:28:59] to give my all.
[1:29:06] He speaks to me. He speaks
[1:29:12] to me. Oh, and I I agree.
[1:29:18] I agree. How many want to raise a hand?
[1:29:20] Say, Lord, I agree with all your words.
[1:29:23] Lord, please come
[1:29:26] and take
[1:29:28] control.
[1:29:30] I feel
[1:29:32] the
[1:29:33] Lord.

[1:29:38] Amen. Amen. Amen. Anybody got a
[1:29:41] testimony tonight before we go? But
[1:29:43] John,
[1:29:45] Amen.
[1:29:48] I just want to thank the Lord. I had a
[1:29:51] sinus I started having a sinus infection
[1:29:53] a couple weeks ago and it started out in
[1:29:56] my left ear and um I think we had stayed
[1:30:00] home that Wednesday or something.
[1:30:01] Anyway, I we just prayed and rebuked the
[1:30:03] devil and and a couple days later that
[1:30:08] went away. And then the weekend come and
[1:30:12] I started getting it right here in my
[1:30:14] right eye.
[1:30:16] So we come up for prayer and
[1:30:18] u brother Jason pray for us and and uh I
[1:30:23] realized later that Sunday it was gone.
[1:30:25] Well, guess what? Monday morning it's
[1:30:27] like, "Oh, you want to try to come
[1:30:29] back?" I was like, "Nuh-uh.
[1:30:31] You're out of here, Satan. You're a
[1:30:33] liar."
[1:30:33] Amen.
[1:30:34] And he tried to stick around. Tried to
[1:30:35] tried to get back.
[1:30:36] More missiles. No, he's gone.
[1:30:38] Yeah.
[1:30:39] So, thank the Lord.
[1:30:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:44] Anybody else tonight?
[1:30:47] All right. Right behind you to Right.
[1:30:49] Right behind Sister Alyssa. Amen.
[1:30:53] I just want to thank the Lord for
[1:30:54] healing Nicole's cat. She's raised this
[1:30:56] cat from a kitten. She actually
[1:30:58] bottlefed it. Um, and she believes the
[1:31:02] cat got a UTI, but it wasn't doing very
[1:31:04] well. and she'd had given it medicine
[1:31:06] and, you know, done all the things that
[1:31:08] were recommended and still wasn't
[1:31:09] getting better. And she called me um and
[1:31:12] she asked us to pray and we prayed and
[1:31:14] the cat's perfectly fine. Actually
[1:31:16] better than it's ever been. So, thank
[1:31:17] the Lord.
[1:31:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:21] Anybody else?
[1:31:23] Anybody else? Amen. while I was uh I got
[1:31:27] a little testimony when I was uh
[1:31:30] over uh in Poland
[1:31:33] and I've noticed that
[1:31:36] you remember the uh 2-year battle I
[1:31:38] fought with that shingles infection
[1:31:40] inside my right eye and uh the Lord got
[1:31:44] me through all of that and it's been
[1:31:45] wonderful for many months
[1:31:48] and uh a lot of the medication I had to
[1:31:51] take for two years was pretty strong so
[1:31:53] it left this right eye a little dry so
[1:31:55] I'm I have to use natural tears
[1:31:57] moisturizer
[1:31:58] more often now. But you know, you do
[1:32:02] that as you're aging anyway. Devil's
[1:32:04] still a liar anyway. But uh but I've but
[1:32:08] uh so I realized that when I become um
[1:32:12] overly exhausted or overly or overly
[1:32:15] exerted and uh traveling to Poland and
[1:32:20] keeping up with two teenage girls is
[1:32:22] exhausting
[1:32:24] and overly exerting and then preaching
[1:32:26] and then flying and then traveling and
[1:32:28] then chasing two girls constantly. And
[1:32:32] uh and and so I I I went to bed Saturday
[1:32:35] night there and I woke up Sunday. Um and
[1:32:38] I felt a a fresh outbreak of that
[1:32:41] shingles and it always starts up here on
[1:32:43] my head. It feels like a tender spot
[1:32:45] that I can't touch about that big
[1:32:47] around. And I was able to raise my
[1:32:49] hairline back and I could see the
[1:32:51] blistering. And I just said, "Lord
[1:32:53] Jesus." And I called Sister Debbie and I
[1:32:56] said, "Honey, I want you to pray for me.
[1:32:57] I just want you to pray because here's
[1:32:59] what's happening and I want you to
[1:33:00] pray." And I was going to have actually
[1:33:02] have brother Matt lay hands on me. I
[1:33:04] didn't actually get around to doing that
[1:33:06] because by the next day it was already
[1:33:09] down to like went from like a um a half
[1:33:12] dollar down to like a dime and then from
[1:33:14] a dime down to a dot and then by
[1:33:16] yesterday it was completely gone. And
[1:33:18] I'm perfectly fine today. Amen.
[1:33:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:29] Changes everything. Turn around and
[1:33:30] shake hands with somebody standing near
[1:33:32] you. Say, "God bless you." Amen. A
[1:33:35] greeting in the name of the Lord. We'll
[1:33:36] see you this Sunday. God bless you. You
[1:33:39] can be dismissed in Jesus name.
