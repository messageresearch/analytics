[56:56] my I was uh I was looking through my
[56:59] morning devotionals early this morning
[57:01] and I and of all the ones uh you know I
[57:04] have a whole stack of them that I go
[57:05] through

[57:09] um oh you're a fired son wow you forgot

[57:28] praise the Lord
[57:30] um so brother I was reading and I come
[57:33] across the devotional for January 1 from
[57:36] Charles Spurgeon and you know I I'm
[57:39] guessing Charles brother Charles wrote
[57:41] that uh on December 31. because he's
[57:46] talking about how wonderful it'll be
[57:50] if tomorrow we get to go home
[57:53] and he was just saying the end of the
[57:55] year what if this was just the end of
[57:57] all of our troubles and trials and it
[57:59] was all done and we were we were headed
[58:01] home tomorrow wouldn't that be grand and
[58:02] and then he he kind of reflects you know
[58:05] to say well
[58:07] if it's not
[58:08] then we'll just carry on we'll just keep
[58:11] on going you know yeah that that's peace
[58:15] forevermore but we have the peace of God
[58:17] now amen so you know they're they're in
[58:21] that wonderful divine presence but we
[58:23] got that divine presence
[58:25] so if he so he he kind of almost in a
[58:28] Melancholy way said so
[58:30] if it's not and we have to carry on
[58:32] we'll just carry on
[58:34] I thought brother oh my I'm so
[58:37] encouraged by that today I woke up this
[58:40] morning and I was thanking God I said
[58:41] Lord you give me another opportunity
[58:44] another year to forge ahead and I want
[58:48] to be in that number Amen in that number
[58:52] when the redeemed go marching home I
[58:55] want to be in that number
[58:57] praise the Lord Joel chapter 2
[59:02] we're going to catch verses 23
[59:06] through 27.
[59:09] now I want to uh remind you and I want
[59:13] to for especially being a Sunday and and
[59:16] the streaming and different things and
[59:17] brother Matt will be uh Making a Splash
[59:21] a a an advertisement for it for our
[59:23] website and oh it's up very good son and
[59:26] uh it's announcing our meetings coming
[59:28] in March uh with brother Donnie so
[59:31] spread the word near and far and invite
[59:34] all your neighborhood bring them amen
[59:37] and so I'm trying I don't know if we can
[59:40] pull it off but I would love uh to bring
[59:43] the pastor from from
[59:47] um let's see what country is he from I
[59:49] think he's from
[59:51] um
[59:53] no uh where is what's what's Lagos the
[59:56] cap uh capital of
[59:58] Nigeria who okay
[1:00:01] um the capital of Nigeria and he's uh I
[1:00:03] think he's a pastor there in Nigeria and
[1:00:07] he's actually you may have heard of him
[1:00:09] he's actually a young pastor and he was
[1:00:12] the one you may have heard the story
[1:00:14] about he was actually kidnapped by by
[1:00:18] terrorists for ransom and held I think
[1:00:21] for more than a month and of course his
[1:00:24] family was poor and we uh brother
[1:00:26] brother Emmanuel ibruka that's his name
[1:00:28] and I got to see a snippet of his
[1:00:32] testimony
[1:00:33] wow I'll just say it backwards wow and
[1:00:38] this brother was so powerful in
[1:00:40] captivity those people never got money
[1:00:41] they finally had to let him go because
[1:00:43] they realized they had a man of God
[1:00:45] and so powerful was his testimony among
[1:00:47] them that half the team wanted to kill
[1:00:49] him and the other half said we'll kill
[1:00:51] you if you kill him
[1:00:52] and by the time it was all over one of
[1:00:56] the kidnappers or maybe one or more of
[1:00:58] them now is at his church
[1:01:00] wow I mean Satan kidnapped the wrong guy
[1:01:04] and they grabbed him after a Sunday
[1:01:05] morning I thought my I've never had to
[1:01:08] worry about leaving here on a Sunday
[1:01:10] morning after preaching and I get
[1:01:12] kidnapped and then and that's literally
[1:01:15] on his way home they nabbed him and uh
[1:01:18] he has an electrifying testimony that's
[1:01:21] just a little little preview and we're
[1:01:23] trying to see if I can bring him at the
[1:01:25] same time and uh if we do get him here
[1:01:29] to be up to the if we can get him visas
[1:01:31] and all that if we do then we'll start
[1:01:34] our meetings a day earlier than the
[1:01:36] announcement because I only had the
[1:01:38] inspiration for it this morning so we
[1:01:40] will instead of starting on the third
[1:01:42] we'll start on the second we'll bring
[1:01:44] him in and we'll let him kick it off and
[1:01:46] then also take a Saturday morning and
[1:01:49] let him give his full in-depth testimony
[1:01:53] to us and then we'll turn him loose to
[1:01:55] preach the first night and then let him
[1:01:56] give his testimony or vice versa however
[1:01:58] the Lord leads amen so uh but we're
[1:02:01] looking forward to that so pray will you
[1:02:03] and that the Lord will work that out it
[1:02:05] won't be as easy as it used to be
[1:02:08] governments have really tightened
[1:02:10] tightened up especially in this
[1:02:12] political environment that we live in
[1:02:14] today but my goodness I sure would I
[1:02:16] sure hope it can work amen to get
[1:02:19] brother Emmanuel here very very fine
[1:02:21] young Pastor so we're looking forward to
[1:02:23] that all right let's read in our text
[1:02:27] Joel chapter 2 verse 23 to 27.
[1:02:33] this this is going to amaze me that I'm
[1:02:36] going to read this with a title the
[1:02:39] spirit of lawlessness all right
[1:02:41] verse 23
[1:02:43] be glad then you children of Zion and
[1:02:46] rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath
[1:02:50] given you the former Reign moderately
[1:02:53] and will cause to come down for you the
[1:02:57] rain the former rain and the latter rain
[1:03:00] in the first month so there's a prophecy
[1:03:03] when the former and latter Reign were
[1:03:05] going to be brought in the same month
[1:03:07] close together all right and the floors
[1:03:10] here will be the result this is your day
[1:03:13] in case you need a helper with that this
[1:03:15] is your day and the floors shall be full
[1:03:18] of wheat the former and latter rain
[1:03:20] because the laodicean H was the shortest
[1:03:22] of all ages so the former and latter
[1:03:24] rain fall quickly together you got that
[1:03:27] it's bringing us to harvest how many are
[1:03:29] for Harvest all right
[1:03:33] um and the floors shall be full of Wheat
[1:03:36] and the fats shall overflow with wine
[1:03:39] and oil and I will restore to you the
[1:03:44] years that the locusts hath eaten the
[1:03:47] canker worm and the caterpillar and the
[1:03:49] Palmer worm my great Army which I sin
[1:03:52] among you and ye shall eat in plenty and
[1:03:57] be satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:04:00] Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously
[1:04:03] with you and my people shall never be
[1:04:07] ashamed in other words you're not I just
[1:04:09] want to give you some re some relief

[1:04:32] and ye shall know that I am in the midst
[1:04:36] of Israel and that I am the Lord your
[1:04:39] God and none else and my people shall

[1:04:49] for your word this morning we ask for
[1:04:52] your Divine help now Lord there's much
[1:04:55] more and I I was having to take out
[1:04:58] whole swaths of my notes and put it to
[1:05:00] another time lord is just far too much
[1:05:03] to try to cover this morning sin we we
[1:05:05] want to we want to have it just laid out
[1:05:09] perfectly Lord trying to follow the
[1:05:11] leadership of the Holy Spirit and I
[1:05:13] commit it all to you now in Jesus Christ
[1:05:16] name lord they're sick among us father
[1:05:19] some of our own congregation here
[1:05:21] battling sickness and virus we speak
[1:05:24] healing for them Lord there's requests
[1:05:27] that have come in Lord and family
[1:05:29] members in distant lands and States Lord
[1:05:31] and other brothers Lord from other
[1:05:33] places and sickness everywhere serious
[1:05:36] cases Lord many of them and I'm praying
[1:05:38] and asking father for your great Mercy
[1:05:41] on this request for the Brethren
[1:05:43] Virginia on Sister phyllis's Sister
[1:05:45] you've helped her before Lord help her
[1:05:47] again oh God for our brothers and
[1:05:49] sisters battling sickness and virus Lord
[1:05:52] I was having the Brethren on the call in
[1:05:54] today pray for this church specifically
[1:05:56] that this flu virus bug sickness
[1:05:59] whatever it is be done and be sent into
[1:06:02] outer Darkness Lord may it be so I pray
[1:06:05] Grant it now we ask these things of thee
[1:06:08] in Jesus name amen God bless you friends
[1:06:11] you can be seated
[1:06:23] I covet your prayers this morning I mean
[1:06:26] that quite earnestly
[1:06:28] because as I've said I've I've whittled
[1:06:31] it down and whittled it down to
[1:06:33] something that I believe that we can
[1:06:35] cover today hopefully
[1:06:38] um we'll be able to get to it all at
[1:06:41] least everything that I would like to be
[1:06:42] able to get to amen we'll leave it up to
[1:06:45] the Lord
[1:06:46] now when we let me just try to wade into
[1:06:51] this as best I can and and it's been
[1:06:54] quite amazing to me this morning because
[1:06:57] this is actually my second time
[1:06:59] ministering I ministered the morning
[1:07:01] bible study on our uh on our call-in
[1:07:04] show and I or call in Bible study that
[1:07:07] we have and I was ministering along
[1:07:10] the same lines not everything but a
[1:07:13] certain portion of this I was
[1:07:15] ministering it this morning so it that
[1:07:17] part I'm thankful is fresh in my mind
[1:07:19] our study of the entire Book of
[1:07:21] Revelation so we're going to correlate
[1:07:22] that this morning a little bit but also
[1:07:24] even as I was driving to church and all
[1:07:26] this is on my mind and I'm thinking
[1:07:28] about you know Christmas the Christmas
[1:07:30] message that we brought
[1:07:33] um the Sunday previous and that meant so
[1:07:36] much to me friends and you know I was I
[1:07:38] was trying to emphasize to you without
[1:07:41] going back I'd love to almost go back
[1:07:43] and preach that whole sermon again but
[1:07:45] you know the some of the main points
[1:07:47] were to bring you up to speed on the
[1:07:49] fact that the the kingdom of God is
[1:07:53] already being restored and that that's
[1:07:56] what the opening of The Seven Seals the
[1:07:59] releasing of the mystery of God I say
[1:08:02] what was the Seven Seals give it to me
[1:08:05] in a short in a short description that's
[1:08:08] easy to do it was the unveil failing of
[1:08:11] the Mighty God
[1:08:12] that's what it was he was hidden away as
[1:08:15] under a mystery and revealed piecemeal
[1:08:19] down through the ages of restoration the
[1:08:22] the church we know by the history fell
[1:08:24] away and we find certain little you can
[1:08:27] you can find certain little points in
[1:08:30] history to correlate the prophecy we
[1:08:32] find if we look at the at the messenger
[1:08:34] that we would refer to him as irenius
[1:08:38] and there's different ways to pronounce
[1:08:40] that name we'll use brother branham's
[1:08:41] way because I love Kentucky grammar and
[1:08:44] so but we find that brother Branham when
[1:08:47] he comes to iridius he gives us a little
[1:08:51] clue that irenius was the last messenger
[1:08:56] uh to understand the godhead perfectly
[1:09:00] he understood Paul's teaching on the
[1:09:04] godhead and when I say that we don't
[1:09:07] mean that just that there's one God we
[1:09:10] mean that there's God
[1:09:13] multiplied into his family we mean that
[1:09:16] there's a many membered parts of God's
[1:09:19] godhead amen and that it's not Jesus
[1:09:22] only but because that's why the Jesus
[1:09:24] only group was wrong because they didn't
[1:09:27] include his body in that but once you
[1:09:30] understand that God has revealed himself
[1:09:33] through expression then it starts to all
[1:09:35] come together and make sense then you
[1:09:37] don't get stumbled and trapped by the
[1:09:39] scriptures references to the humanity
[1:09:42] side of Jesus because he was a complete
[1:09:44] 100 percent man he wasn't half man and
[1:09:47] half God he wasn't a demigod so he
[1:09:49] wasn't half man half God he was fully
[1:09:51] man yet fully God which is a paradox
[1:09:54] that can't be but it is
[1:09:56] but and that's why it takes a revelation
[1:09:58] to understand it and the the the great
[1:10:01] strength of Revelation say I'd like to
[1:10:03] understand it we're not talking about
[1:10:05] understanding the details of the
[1:10:07] doctrine and trying to dot every eye
[1:10:09] because even even as ministers there's
[1:10:12] certain elements of it that we even kind
[1:10:14] of shake our head a little bit and go
[1:10:15] well you know but here here's the real
[1:10:18] secret that when you are born again of
[1:10:21] the spirit of God the Revelation that
[1:10:24] helps you to understand the godhead is
[1:10:26] the Revelation that helps you to know
[1:10:28] who you are
[1:10:31] and in knowing who you are you begin by
[1:10:33] Revelation to understand your
[1:10:35] relationship to the father then you
[1:10:37] begin to understand Jesus relationship
[1:10:40] to the father
[1:10:41] so he was the fullness of the godhead in
[1:10:44] a single body walking the shores of
[1:10:47] Galilee going about doing good but God
[1:10:49] never intended to stay bottled up like
[1:10:52] that and Jesus said except if they
[1:10:54] wanted to make him a king he said no
[1:10:56] that's the wrong plan unless I unless I
[1:10:59] die I won't multiply and multiplication
[1:11:03] has always been the plan
[1:11:06] God expressing himself and now it's the
[1:11:09] same God not in us not the fullness in a
[1:11:13] single Body by the fullness of the
[1:11:15] godhead in a many-membered body
[1:11:18] amen the body of Christ now spread
[1:11:22] around the world that's because because
[1:11:25] he understands it's got to be a kingdom
[1:11:28] of saints
[1:11:30] the kingdoms of this world
[1:11:33] mankind has had his run
[1:11:36] the spirit of lawlessness I'm here to
[1:11:39] tell you that God opened the seals to us
[1:11:42] and revealed the Mighty God which we see
[1:11:45] ourselves now in it amen that's what
[1:11:47] Christ is Mr God is all about that's
[1:11:50] what Masterpiece is all about
[1:11:52] amen that's what the unveiling of God is
[1:11:55] all about that's what the token is all
[1:11:57] about go back and listen to those that's
[1:11:59] those are things that brother Brandon
[1:12:01] began to bring to us after the opening
[1:12:03] of the seals to make it more clear
[1:12:06] see
[1:12:08] so when you when you find God
[1:12:11] interpreting his word let me just give
[1:12:14] you a couple of principles
[1:12:17] so when they came when Jesus walked the
[1:12:21] Earth
[1:12:23] what you're literally if you had been
[1:12:25] there
[1:12:27] with the disciples
[1:12:29] what you would have been seeing and
[1:12:31] could have said and you would have been
[1:12:33] accurate
[1:12:34] you could have said
[1:12:36] the the text
[1:12:38] in the Old Testament the text that was
[1:12:41] written and recorded by by the prophets
[1:12:45] and by scribes like Ezra
[1:12:48] who chronicled these things and great
[1:12:51] prophets who testified of what Christ
[1:12:53] would be that when Jesus came on the
[1:12:57] scene text had migrated to flesh
[1:13:03] you understand
[1:13:05] text had migrated to flesh it wasn't
[1:13:08] that we did away with the text it was
[1:13:12] that now we have an understanding in
[1:13:14] Christ of what all the prophets priests
[1:13:16] and kings were about it was as if they
[1:13:19] as if the the disciples could go ah now
[1:13:22] I get it
[1:13:23] they were still struggling on the road
[1:13:26] to Emmaus
[1:13:27] and Jesus started what'd he do he went
[1:13:30] back into the Old Testament and he began
[1:13:32] to show his life in the Old Testament
[1:13:35] coming forward and then he and what did
[1:13:37] he do he first opened to them the
[1:13:40] scriptures
[1:13:42] that's what a prophet did in the seals
[1:13:44] then he opened their understanding
[1:13:48] that's what's happening right now and
[1:13:51] then he opened their eyes and when your
[1:13:53] eyes come open the Saints are going to
[1:13:54] be standing around you
[1:13:56] and it's going to be over and we're
[1:13:58] going to be headed home oh that the text
[1:14:01] is going to become flesh again
[1:14:06] because Jesus in his life
[1:14:09] gave prophecy concerning the church and
[1:14:13] when the Holy Ghost came into the church
[1:14:15] a little while the world won't see me
[1:14:17] but you will
[1:14:18] I'll be with you even in you after a
[1:14:21] while and they wrote that down
[1:14:22] well that's good we better write that
[1:14:24] down well after a while that text became
[1:14:26] flesh
[1:14:30] see and then then what could then what
[1:14:33] did the church what what advantage
[1:14:36] did they now have they could now go and
[1:14:40] say
[1:14:41] you see you see this church here with
[1:14:43] all this power and signs and wonders
[1:14:44] this is this is what was recorded by our
[1:14:48] Lord he said this would happen just like
[1:14:51] Peter on the day of Pentecost when they
[1:14:53] they looked at their action and they
[1:14:55] said you're drunk he says no you
[1:14:57] misunderstand what you're seeing this is
[1:14:59] Joel's prophecy
[1:15:01] that in the last days I'll pour out my
[1:15:04] spirit upon All Flesh this is what
[1:15:06] you're seeing that text has become human
[1:15:12] so now go to Paul's teaching in text to
[1:15:15] say oh don't you know don't worry that I
[1:15:18] know you're you're troubled over the
[1:15:20] Rapture but just let me tell you there's
[1:15:22] first got to be the Lawless one he's got
[1:15:25] to come and be exposed
[1:15:27] don't go thinking the rapture's already
[1:15:29] passed it hasn't happened yet because
[1:15:31] there's first got to come a falling away
[1:15:33] and and he goes down through all of
[1:15:35] these texts and today you're seeing that
[1:15:38] text in flesh in the world you're seeing
[1:15:41] the Lawless one in control of the world
[1:15:43] Paul's words have materialized
[1:15:47] well just keep following it because he
[1:15:50] said Don't Fear because the dead in
[1:15:52] Christ shall rise and we which are alive
[1:15:54] and remain shall be changed caught up in
[1:15:57] a moment in a twinkling I'm here to tell
[1:15:59] you that's going to become human
[1:16:02] Hallelujah
[1:16:04] and it can't help but become that
[1:16:07] because it's already underway
[1:16:12] we're all ready thank you sir we're
[1:16:14] already being transitioned
[1:16:17] the soul part of you is already sitting
[1:16:20] in Heavenly places
[1:16:23] in Christ Jesus
[1:16:26] I guarantee you
[1:16:28] you're guaranteed not to hear that in
[1:16:31] the in 99 of the Christian pulpits
[1:16:34] around the world
[1:16:36] I tell you if you want to hear something
[1:16:37] like that
[1:16:39] and understand God's plan for you that's
[1:16:41] why God sent a prophet and brought a
[1:16:43] message and broke the seals and loosed
[1:16:46] the mystery of Christ and gives your
[1:16:48] Revelation that you're part of that
[1:16:52] and I know it's happening here in 2023
[1:16:55] I'm more uh that word is more flesh than
[1:16:57] it was last night
[1:16:59] and my goal say what's your what's your
[1:17:02] New Year's resolutions I don't have any
[1:17:03] I got a goal that my goal and his goal
[1:17:06] will be the same goal
[1:17:08] Hallelujah
[1:17:10] [Applause]
[1:17:14] so the spirit of lawlessness
[1:17:17] we see it everywhere it's
[1:17:20] it's permeated
[1:17:22] I mean every aspect of human life
[1:17:27] politics religion economics Science
[1:17:30] Education
[1:17:32] the the social issues
[1:17:35] every the whole fabric of human life
[1:17:38] is permeated the lid
[1:17:40] was torn from hell
[1:17:43] see the Bible
[1:17:45] that's not brother Branham using poetic
[1:17:47] license
[1:17:48] that's the Book of Revelation
[1:17:51] The Book of Revelation shows
[1:17:54] historically speaking tying prophecy to
[1:17:57] Modern events that just before the first
[1:18:00] woe which we know to be World War One
[1:18:03] that just be the event that's happening
[1:18:06] in the Book of Revelation right as that
[1:18:08] is coming before that happens an angel
[1:18:12] is cast down from heaven and given a key
[1:18:15] to the bottomless pit and a prophet ties
[1:18:19] that angel right back to Isaiah how art
[1:18:22] thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of
[1:18:26] the morning
[1:18:28] and the and he literally has a key to
[1:18:31] open the bottomless pit and and now as
[1:18:34] brother Branham said the lid has been
[1:18:36] taken from hell and demon powers are
[1:18:40] streaming into the Earth why do you
[1:18:42] think they decided to have a global war
[1:18:44] something that had never happened
[1:18:46] how did Nations who were trying to
[1:18:49] prevent it and kings and Kaisers and and
[1:18:52] czars and and and royalty were writing
[1:18:55] letters to each other saying no no no we
[1:18:57] don't want war no we don't either no we
[1:18:59] don't either stop your armies okay I'll
[1:19:00] stop mine okay stop yours and and they
[1:19:03] couldn't stop it
[1:19:04] because demon powers had already
[1:19:07] infected the minds of men and prophecy
[1:19:10] had to become material
[1:19:14] they can say oh it's the assassination
[1:19:16] of this one I don't care what what Satan
[1:19:19] used as a catalyst it's God's word
[1:19:20] coming to pass
[1:19:25] so he's so Satan is given
[1:19:29] an increase of power
[1:19:32] in the earth that he hadn't had before
[1:19:35] he's got keys to the bottomless pit now
[1:19:37] at the end of Armageddon he's going to
[1:19:41] be thrown back into that pit and locked
[1:19:43] up
[1:19:44] and all of his powers are going to go
[1:19:46] with him and all of his influence will
[1:19:47] be gone well happy day happy day that
[1:19:51] Millennial Reign for a thousand years I
[1:19:53] won't have to worry about the devil
[1:19:55] oh my
[1:19:57] that's enough to make me run up the road
[1:20:00] screaming
[1:20:01] Hallelujah no wonder I say hasten you're
[1:20:04] coming Lord even so come quickly Lord
[1:20:07] Jesus
[1:20:11] and and then you notice you think it's
[1:20:13] an accident it's impossible to be an
[1:20:15] accident
[1:20:16] and that's that's the very same time
[1:20:19] that that in 1906 right right as Satan
[1:20:24] is released
[1:20:25] he's he's cast down and he opens the pit
[1:20:28] and demon powers are streaming and now
[1:20:31] turmoil starts in the world but at the
[1:20:34] very same time in California in 1906 God
[1:20:39] is bringing an Azusa Revival why because
[1:20:42] when when the enemy comes in like the
[1:20:44] flood God raises a standard
[1:20:48] Hallelujah to make sure his church could
[1:20:50] face the battles that it would have to
[1:20:52] face I'm here to tell you those seals
[1:20:54] were open because the battle you would
[1:20:56] have to face were unprecedented
[1:20:59] they'd never been seen no parallel for
[1:21:02] it in history Paul said it's and the
[1:21:04] Book of Emily said it's perilous times a
[1:21:05] day like never has been before you're in
[1:21:09] it the Lawless one is here but so is
[1:21:11] Christ yeah
[1:21:13] yeah Hallelujah and Satan has his
[1:21:15] material and Christ has his material and
[1:21:18] you're it
[1:21:19] and I'm it Hallelujah
[1:21:21] [Applause]
[1:21:27] these things are coming forward
[1:21:29] they're firing rapidly
[1:21:32] this is a short quick work
[1:21:34] it's a former latter rain all together
[1:21:36] runs together quickly
[1:21:39] the the Reapers
[1:21:42] from the Gentile Harvest
[1:21:45] can scarcely clear the field the field
[1:21:47] to the world
[1:21:48] they can scarcely clear the field
[1:21:50] when the Sowers for the next event are
[1:21:52] already entering the field to start
[1:21:54] sowing
[1:21:55] and the Bible says the Sowers are
[1:21:57] overtaking the Reapers
[1:21:59] because the Sowers for the next event is
[1:22:01] the spirit of Moses and Elijah to go to
[1:22:03] 144 000.
[1:22:05] but that can't happen to all these
[1:22:07] Gentile Pride members every name on the
[1:22:09] book has to be redeemed
[1:22:11] Hallelujah and we got it and and they're
[1:22:14] coming the anointing say are there so
[1:22:16] much pressure in the world there's so
[1:22:17] much brother Branham showed us that it's
[1:22:20] prophecy causing that
[1:22:22] the darkness is getting congealed and
[1:22:25] squeezed because the the approaching of
[1:22:27] the morning sun
[1:22:28] [Applause]
[1:22:28] [Music]
[1:22:29] Hallelujah
[1:22:31] and as we are being perfected it's
[1:22:33] actually causing the darkness of the
[1:22:35] world to become worse
[1:22:39] but here's the ministry of the Morning
[1:22:41] Star
[1:22:43] see
[1:22:44] and so so we find that
[1:22:48] or you know that the spirit of Moses and
[1:22:51] Elijah trying to prophecy trying to come
[1:22:53] forward
[1:22:54] and they're they're saying hey you
[1:22:56] Gentiles clear the field man going to
[1:22:59] rapture
[1:23:00] get out of here
[1:23:01] going to rapture we got to sew for the
[1:23:03] 144 000 and the bride is saying all too
[1:23:06] happy to oblige Hallelujah marching the
[1:23:09] Zion beautiful beautiful Zion
[1:23:12] Hallelujah I'm happy to be a Christian
[1:23:15] I'm happy to have a message I'm happy to
[1:23:18] have the Holy Ghost
[1:23:19] it's changing my life
[1:23:22] and it'll soon change my body
[1:23:26] unmistakably irrevocably
[1:23:29] reversibly
[1:23:31] and I'll never
[1:23:33] have to come back here and do this again
[1:23:41] so he says
[1:23:43] yep I had a pastor write to me this
[1:23:46] morning I he don't have a clue I I he
[1:23:49] said I know you're going to be preaching
[1:23:52] soon but I just got one little question
[1:23:53] on a little verse can you he had no idea
[1:23:55] he's about to erupt a volcano because I
[1:23:59] was I was all on my mind everything I'm
[1:24:00] saying now and I couldn't believe I said
[1:24:03] you got to got me ready to preach now
[1:24:04] and I'm just getting ready to come out
[1:24:07] so he I won't we're not going to take
[1:24:10] the time because I won't get to my main
[1:24:11] part I haven't got to my main part yet
[1:24:15] but we find that
[1:24:19] you asked for a comment on Genesis 4 15
[1:24:21] now
[1:24:23] Bible readers understand that this is
[1:24:25] the threat to not kill Cain
[1:24:27] and God put a mark on him
[1:24:30] and labeled him
[1:24:31] marked him said don't anybody kill him
[1:24:35] if you kill him then there's going to be
[1:24:37] a seven times punishment see
[1:24:40] and he was saying you know what's what's
[1:24:42] your take on that I said well brother I
[1:24:44] said to me that that that scripture is
[1:24:48] the the perfect if you want a perfect
[1:24:50] antithesis if you want a perfect
[1:24:52] contrast perfect Contra distinction
[1:24:55] Genesis 4 15 contrasting with Revelation
[1:24:58] 6 6 Touch not the oil and the wine
[1:25:04] see that's God warning his family don't
[1:25:07] kill Cain because that would have made
[1:25:09] sense that would have been the logical
[1:25:11] thing to do hey this this guy is
[1:25:14] Antichrist let's kill him so before he
[1:25:15] can multiply fix the problem well it
[1:25:17] wouldn't have fixed a problem because
[1:25:19] Adam had already fallen and all nature
[1:25:22] fell under him and the problem was not
[1:25:24] not cane multiplying the problem was
[1:25:26] multiplying through sex
[1:25:28] because it wasn't the original way and
[1:25:30] so even though under holy matrimony it
[1:25:33] still comes the wrong way
[1:25:35] and so no matter what no matter how how
[1:25:38] much Adam and Eve had skins of blood no
[1:25:42] matter how much they did all children
[1:25:44] would be born in sin
[1:25:47] so but God is warning his family listen
[1:25:52] you're not going to be able to destroy
[1:25:54] him
[1:25:56] there's going to have to go seven Cycles
[1:25:59] I'll deal with him in the end don't you
[1:26:01] try to do that see now you remember
[1:26:04] brother Brandon picks that up in the
[1:26:06] church age book and he said he starts
[1:26:08] talking about how then he says you know
[1:26:10] even though the Antichrist had great
[1:26:14] power in the Dark Ages he he he was not
[1:26:18] able to completely Stamp Out
[1:26:21] the family of God you remember that he
[1:26:23] got him down to just a little sliver but
[1:26:26] he couldn't finish him and brother
[1:26:28] Branham comes back and he says and and
[1:26:30] neither could the church
[1:26:32] with all their signs and wonders and
[1:26:34] preachers and teaching and everything
[1:26:35] neither could they destroy the
[1:26:38] Antichrist almost like a like a like a
[1:26:40] like a war of attrition that's going to
[1:26:42] last for two thousand years because the
[1:26:44] principal had to remain in Matthew 13
[1:26:47] when they said Lord there's tears among
[1:26:50] the wheat shall we destroy him says no
[1:26:52] let them grow together and at the
[1:26:55] Harvest Time
[1:26:57] I'll separate them out and I'll bind
[1:27:00] those bundles and that's plural
[1:27:05] that's plural
[1:27:07] bundles
[1:27:08] because Revelation 17
[1:27:11] shows how that she had names of
[1:27:16] blasphemy
[1:27:19] names of blasphemy no give me Revelation
[1:27:21] 17.
[1:27:23] let's catch it while we're while we're
[1:27:24] thinking about it
[1:27:26] so I want to start at verse one
[1:27:29] all right and there came one of the
[1:27:32] Seven Angels which had the seven vials
[1:27:35] of zelage of course
[1:27:36] it's at the end time he's carrying that
[1:27:39] seventh vial talked with me because look
[1:27:41] you're about to read the context of the
[1:27:43] end so we know which Angel it was all
[1:27:45] right it's not an angel three coming to
[1:27:47] teach Angel Church age seven all right
[1:27:50] it's seven to seven
[1:27:52] and there came one of the Seven Angels
[1:27:54] which had the seven vials and talked
[1:27:55] with me saying unto me come hither
[1:27:57] what what what message
[1:28:00] of all the ages after Paul did this
[1:28:03] Elijah of this day I will show unto thee
[1:28:07] the Judgment of the great
[1:28:09] that sitteth upon many Waters verse 2.
[1:28:13] it's very clear who it is with whom the
[1:28:15] kings of the Earth have committed
[1:28:16] fornication true
[1:28:18] and the inhabitants of the Earth have
[1:28:20] been made drunk with the wine of her
[1:28:22] fornication could I get an amen
[1:28:25] yes
[1:28:26] this is the age of lawlessness verse 3.
[1:28:30] so he carried me away in the spirit see
[1:28:33] John representing the bride it takes
[1:28:34] this messenger who has the set who also
[1:28:37] has the seventh vial to show to ID not
[1:28:40] only the one to identify Christ but he's
[1:28:42] got to identify the Antichrist because
[1:28:45] the bride needs to know
[1:28:48] and there can't be no guessing
[1:28:51] it has to be it can't be great thinkers
[1:28:55] under the man age as brilliant as they
[1:28:57] were they could get it wrong and even if
[1:28:59] they got it mostly right this had to be
[1:29:02] all correct
[1:29:04] because this would have to annihilate
[1:29:06] any charge against God's family she's
[1:29:09] going to have to receive a word that
[1:29:12] literally justifies her as though she
[1:29:14] never did it in the first place and
[1:29:16] takes her all the way back to Genesis I
[1:29:19] thank God for a messenger and a message
[1:29:22] in this day
[1:29:24] [Applause]
[1:29:26] so he carried me away in the spirit of
[1:29:27] the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit
[1:29:28] upon a Scarlet colored Beast full catch
[1:29:30] it full of names plural
[1:29:33] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[1:29:36] heads and ten horns now take it down
[1:29:37] pops
[1:29:38] so so it's names of blasphemy that's why
[1:29:42] when it goes into Matthew 13 it's it's
[1:29:45] it's it's bundles
[1:29:48] tears it's bundles
[1:29:50] not a bundle it's bundles
[1:29:53] and and because it's all of these
[1:29:56] Blasphemous names
[1:29:58] of man-made denominational systems who
[1:30:02] at the end time are secure Under the
[1:30:05] Umbrella of the Beast system
[1:30:08] oh friends you can't make this stuff up
[1:30:10] this is so perfect
[1:30:13] and and what what happens you see that's
[1:30:15] why you have to see that say why aren't
[1:30:18] we gone because that has to be on the
[1:30:20] earth first he's got to bind them and
[1:30:22] bundle them and that's what the
[1:30:23] confederation of church is all about and
[1:30:26] and I don't know that we certainly don't
[1:30:28] go all the way to the point where you
[1:30:30] can't buy or sell the bride's all right
[1:30:32] we already know she's gone by that time
[1:30:34] but but before the bride can leave that
[1:30:37] that has to materialize that text has to
[1:30:40] come behind flesh and there have to be
[1:30:42] denominational churches who think they
[1:30:45] have the gospel but what they have is a
[1:30:47] Blasphemous name
[1:30:50] because they have they have rejected the
[1:30:53] word in this hour they were fine for
[1:30:55] their day God used them in their day but
[1:30:58] now they're in those great leaders have
[1:31:00] died off and now they've they've become
[1:31:02] worse than the mother
[1:31:08] see
[1:31:11] so in the end time of harvest
[1:31:14] they are allowed we find them under the
[1:31:17] tribulation period allowed to still call
[1:31:20] themselves by their names
[1:31:22] see they don't they don't have to become
[1:31:24] Rome or
[1:31:25] or Catholic or nothing they can stay
[1:31:28] they can stay Lutheran and Methodist and
[1:31:30] Baptist and UPC and United Pentecost so
[1:31:34] they can stay they can stay all of those
[1:31:35] names doesn't matter they don't have to
[1:31:37] that way they don't lose the charter
[1:31:38] that's prophecy
[1:31:40] that's not a man's opinion that's
[1:31:41] prophecy you can read it in the book
[1:31:44] and the word is oblivious to it you know
[1:31:46] why because the spirit of lawlessness
[1:31:49] has blinded the eyes of them
[1:31:52] but Jesus said blessed are your eyes for
[1:31:56] they see and your ears for they hear
[1:32:00] that's that's how he could so assuredly
[1:32:02] say this bride is predestinated not to
[1:32:06] fall there's going to be a bride at the
[1:32:08] last day at the time of the former
[1:32:10] latter rain coming together a pride that
[1:32:13] will not be like Eve she will not be
[1:32:15] like every church that ever backslid
[1:32:18] she's going to go all the way to
[1:32:20] perfection
[1:32:25] so
[1:32:27] Revelation 17 then
[1:32:31] is being interpreted all the way back in
[1:32:33] Genesis 4.
[1:32:37] and Revelation and Matthew 13. no don't
[1:32:39] kill Cain
[1:32:41] that would that would because I'm going
[1:32:42] to use that in Redemption see don't
[1:32:45] don't break my plan don't kill him
[1:32:47] and then he it's what's a warning in
[1:32:49] both directions then he comes to the
[1:32:50] Antichrist don't you touch the oil and
[1:32:51] wine
[1:32:53] see because my Plan of Redemption is
[1:32:55] still working
[1:32:56] he just goes to show you friends
[1:32:58] and I think you ought to take courage
[1:33:00] today
[1:33:01] to say my goodness if I can start at
[1:33:04] Genesis 1 1
[1:33:06] and I can go all the way to the very
[1:33:08] first word and go all the way to the
[1:33:10] last word of the Book of Revelation and
[1:33:13] I can see that God has brought every bit
[1:33:15] of it to pass so far
[1:33:17] and he's better he's batting a thousand
[1:33:20] and I'm going to bet against that
[1:33:23] no no you go ahead go ahead with all you
[1:33:26] know as I said when you don't get the
[1:33:29] real baptism of the Holy Ghost you'll
[1:33:31] hunt around till you find a version of
[1:33:33] The Gospel that you want to be true
[1:33:36] but it won't be the real one
[1:33:38] it'll be the one you wish was true and
[1:33:41] there's plenty of them out there see
[1:33:44] so now comes the kingdom being restored
[1:33:47] see so so now so now when he when he
[1:33:50] when he says here let me let me go back
[1:33:52] to our to our opening text all right so
[1:33:56] no go back to Joel chapter 2. and let's
[1:34:00] pick up at verse 24.
[1:34:03] read through it a little slower this
[1:34:05] time
[1:34:06] perfect
[1:34:08] and the floors shall be full of Wheat
[1:34:11] and the fat shall overflow with wine and
[1:34:13] oil
[1:34:14] and I will restore to you the years that
[1:34:18] the Locust hath eaten
[1:34:20] the canker worm and the caterpillar and
[1:34:22] the Palmer worm listen now
[1:34:24] God is naming
[1:34:26] all four of them
[1:34:28] so that you understand there's nothing
[1:34:32] not going to be restored
[1:34:35] so all the years that Satan
[1:34:40] destroyed the church
[1:34:41] all your life everything Satan has ever
[1:34:45] done to you you're coming back to the
[1:34:48] kingdom friends
[1:34:49] I'm here to tell you everything that you
[1:34:52] were ordained to be in the mind of God
[1:34:55] when Jesus prayed father let thy will be
[1:34:58] done in in Earth
[1:35:00] as it is let this image look like that
[1:35:02] image
[1:35:04] you have an image that God has in his
[1:35:06] mind of you and I'm here to tell you
[1:35:08] when you go soaring through the skies
[1:35:09] you're going to be back to that image
[1:35:11] and I don't care what Satan has taken
[1:35:14] and I don't even care if you were
[1:35:16] culpable and helped him
[1:35:18] Jesus Christ is giving it back this
[1:35:22] message is restoring all
[1:35:25] that was ever done to me
[1:35:28] hallelujah it's bringing me back to Pure
[1:35:31] innocence
[1:35:33] it's destroying the effects see he goes
[1:35:35] on here watch look at it watch it
[1:35:37] destroy the effects verse 26
[1:35:40] ye shall eat in plenty
[1:35:42] see so he's destroyed the effects and be
[1:35:45] satisfied
[1:35:46] he's going to stop your crying
[1:35:49] you know we do cry but joy comes in the
[1:35:52] morning
[1:35:53] we have trouble we do sorrow but we
[1:35:56] don't sorrow as others who have no hope
[1:36:00] nothing wrong with sadness and Sorrowing
[1:36:02] sometimes God has to take you down into
[1:36:03] the valley of Sorrow to to slow you down
[1:36:06] long enough where he can talk to you
[1:36:08] it's too bad brother bam said it's too
[1:36:10] bad he said the desperation that we need
[1:36:12] a lot of times he said you you can't get
[1:36:15] desperate enough to get the faith you
[1:36:17] need because desperation is a
[1:36:19] manufacturing plant and it produces raw
[1:36:22] faith
[1:36:24] and a lot of times you can't get
[1:36:26] desperation until God brings you into a
[1:36:29] trial
[1:36:31] and then and brother Brandon just said
[1:36:32] it like this it's too bad
[1:36:34] it's too bad it has to be that way but
[1:36:37] human beings are like that see
[1:36:39] and God
[1:36:41] sometimes has to bring us down low
[1:36:44] to teach us what we need to teach when
[1:36:46] we couldn't hear it on the Mountaintop
[1:36:48] we were too busy jumping up and down
[1:36:50] and there was he said okay I'm on the
[1:36:52] Mountaintop I'm finished no you're not
[1:36:55] I'm great all I need to know you're not
[1:36:57] you got a lot you got more growing how
[1:36:59] much more until you get out of here
[1:37:02] until you get out of here well why why
[1:37:03] does why does sister Susie not have to
[1:37:06] go through my trial my goodness it looks
[1:37:09] like he likes her better than me but you
[1:37:11] know why does brother Billy why does he
[1:37:13] not have to go through what I have to go
[1:37:14] through looks like the Lord's showing
[1:37:16] favoritism Lord's not showing favoritism
[1:37:18] here's the bottom line you don't know
[1:37:20] what you'll be on the other side but he
[1:37:21] does
[1:37:22] you don't know what you need prep for
[1:37:24] but he does
[1:37:26] everybody's going to have a place and a
[1:37:28] position and Paul said in First
[1:37:29] Corinthians 15 everybody raises in their
[1:37:32] order
[1:37:33] and so you've got a mission you got a
[1:37:35] job and say it's my mission when I leave
[1:37:37] here my mission is over your mission is
[1:37:39] just starting
[1:37:41] you're to be priest and Kings you're
[1:37:43] just you're to be the Distributors of
[1:37:45] God's justice hallelujah hallelujah
[1:37:49] you're gonna set up new government in a
[1:37:51] new world called the millennium
[1:37:53] Hallelujah and there'll be Nations and
[1:37:56] peoples
[1:37:57] and there's got to be governance
[1:37:59] so you don't know what position God will
[1:38:01] have for you so you've got to be trained
[1:38:02] differently you can't get trained like
[1:38:04] me I can't get trained like you we're
[1:38:06] not going to have the same position
[1:38:09] see
[1:38:11] but his promise is
[1:38:13] can I just give you the the Bible
[1:38:15] promise you'll be satisfied
[1:38:19] and you'll praise
[1:38:22] the name of the Lord your God verse 26
[1:38:25] and you shall eat in plenty
[1:38:28] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[1:38:32] the Lord your God that hath dealt
[1:38:34] wondrously with you
[1:38:36] what God is going to do for you there
[1:38:40] you will you'll have one opinion about
[1:38:44] your life here
[1:38:46] say how is your life down there God has
[1:38:48] dealt wondrously but
[1:38:52] oh man but I saw you crying and weeping
[1:38:55] and pouting and a bad attitude and you
[1:38:58] know you quit church and you you stop
[1:39:00] paying your tithes and you criticize the
[1:39:02] song leader and the Deacon and uh but
[1:39:04] but but but I'm I'm redeemed
[1:39:07] and he cleaned me up oh what's your
[1:39:09] opinion of your life it looked pretty
[1:39:11] hard no the Lord was dealing wondrously
[1:39:13] with me oh I didn't know it but all of
[1:39:15] that was wonderful
[1:39:17] all of that hardship was wonderful
[1:39:22] see
[1:39:23] my people shall never be ashamed he
[1:39:25] shall know
[1:39:27] that I am in the midst of Israel I'll
[1:39:28] tell you something friends that has
[1:39:30] often times when we're in our darkest
[1:39:31] hour isn't that true we wonder where is
[1:39:34] God
[1:39:35] there's coming a time you'll never
[1:39:37] wonder that again
[1:39:40] you're coming to a to a reality
[1:39:43] where you will know that he's in your
[1:39:46] midst and that he is the Lord your God
[1:39:50] and none else and all those other things
[1:39:52] you worshiped were vanity
[1:39:56] and God has redeemed in my people
[1:39:59] shall never be ashamed he says again at
[1:40:01] the end of verse 27.
[1:40:05] so
[1:40:07] we find then that he's coming to restore
[1:40:11] so the effects so now here's what I want
[1:40:13] to get to
[1:40:15] so the effects
[1:40:17] of the former and latter rain falling
[1:40:20] together slash the opening of the seals
[1:40:22] slash the Mighty God unveiled slash the
[1:40:25] Revelation that has come to us
[1:40:27] and that the Revelation that you pray
[1:40:29] for every day
[1:40:31] there's nothing you should pray for more
[1:40:33] than that
[1:40:35] see it's amazing how many things we pray
[1:40:37] and ask the Lord to give us like Santa
[1:40:38] Claus
[1:40:41] and and we think of God more as a
[1:40:43] vending machine
[1:40:45] you know but really what you should be
[1:40:48] praying for is not an extra zero in your
[1:40:51] bank account or three or four model year
[1:40:53] Improvement on your vehicle or a house
[1:40:56] with an extra 10 000 square foot or a
[1:40:59] few more friends or likes that's not
[1:41:01] what you should be praying for
[1:41:03] above everything you should pray for
[1:41:06] revelation
[1:41:09] because there's nothing to give you such
[1:41:12] Prevailing Faith as revelation
[1:41:15] revelation of who he is and then you see
[1:41:19] who you are see so he's restoring all
[1:41:23] that Satan destroyed
[1:41:25] so so so and and that's that's beautiful
[1:41:28] because the the end game is
[1:41:32] and it's happening now
[1:41:34] that we get the same power signs and
[1:41:39] wonders and divine Energies
[1:41:42] that the Apostles had
[1:41:45] this thing has come full circle
[1:41:49] listen you know the it's amazing to
[1:41:53] where we talk about miracles and things
[1:41:55] that happen and we've got testimonies of
[1:41:57] even recent Miracles impossible
[1:42:00] situations
[1:42:01] where God by his Supernatural Power by
[1:42:03] simple prayer and that's all it took
[1:42:05] just a simple prayer no one had to cross
[1:42:08] the sea no one had to go up to heaven
[1:42:10] and bring it down all you had to do was
[1:42:12] pray
[1:42:12] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:42:15] they shall recover
[1:42:16] and you get brother Travis and brother
[1:42:18] Matt walking into a man with no chance
[1:42:20] of life he has terminal cancer and a
[1:42:22] quarter on the side of his neck nearly
[1:42:24] as big as his own head
[1:42:26] and all they do is just tell him what
[1:42:28] the word says and they give him a
[1:42:31] testimony of another sister Faith stirs
[1:42:34] they lay hands on him pray for him just
[1:42:36] a simple thing and and now the Man's
[1:42:38] Alive and healthy and not a trace of
[1:42:40] impossible to cure cancer
[1:42:44] that's book of Acts stuff
[1:42:46] see
[1:42:47] that that's Discerning of spirits in the
[1:42:49] word of God what is it doing it's
[1:42:50] separating out the believer from the
[1:42:52] make-believer and the unbeliever see and
[1:42:55] it's beautiful and God's doing it see
[1:42:57] and so so this is this is the
[1:43:01] restoration of all that Satan destroyed
[1:43:04] you know I get to be restored back to
[1:43:07] the image that he saw of me before the
[1:43:10] foundation of the world that is the very
[1:43:13] words I pray for many of you
[1:43:17] and and and the Lord laid it even upon
[1:43:20] my heart to pray that I I it started
[1:43:22] with a particular family that I had a
[1:43:25] burden for in South Africa preaching
[1:43:27] meetings
[1:43:28] and I come out of the meetings and I'm
[1:43:29] weeping uncontrollably I can't even stop
[1:43:32] crying and I'm in my Bungalow it's in
[1:43:34] the middle of the night I don't even
[1:43:35] know what's wrong with me
[1:43:37] and I'm weeping and crying Lord God and
[1:43:40] and and I and I I get on I said oh I've
[1:43:43] got to hear some worship music I write a
[1:43:44] text hey Deb will you go to your piano
[1:43:46] sister and and sing this song and record
[1:43:50] yourself and send it to me I wanna I
[1:43:51] wanna hear that song she's like sure god
[1:43:54] father we're happy happy to do that she
[1:43:57] gets I don't know what time it was she
[1:43:59] gets out of her bed or wherever she was
[1:44:00] stop cleaning or whatever was going on
[1:44:02] and she sits down at the piano I can
[1:44:04] hear kids playing and she's she's
[1:44:06] pounding out a song she loves it and I
[1:44:07] love it and and I sit there in my room
[1:44:09] and listening to that I'm in I'm in
[1:44:11] another continent
[1:44:13] over the seven seas and I'm sitting
[1:44:16] there worshiping in spirit and in truth
[1:44:19] and you know what happens the Lord comes
[1:44:22] on my heart and I've got a particular
[1:44:24] particular need and the Lord begins to
[1:44:28] speak to me and I can hear him forming
[1:44:30] my words and he's saying this is because
[1:44:32] they asked Jesus teach us to pray and
[1:44:34] Lord said I'm going to teach you to pray
[1:44:36] pray it just like this Lord
[1:44:38] bring them the family in my mind bring
[1:44:41] them to the image today bring them a
[1:44:45] little closer
[1:44:47] to the image you saw of them before the
[1:44:51] foundation of the world
[1:44:53] and it wasn't even very long after that
[1:44:55] the Lord started expanding it saying
[1:44:57] pray this about them too and about them
[1:44:58] and about them and about them and about
[1:45:00] them so you know I don't know what's
[1:45:01] happening in your life I don't know you
[1:45:03] might be getting a spanking for all I
[1:45:05] know but it might be my fault
[1:45:10] the Lord might be pulling rugs out from
[1:45:12] under you sorry but that's what pastors
[1:45:14] do it's what Shepherds do they pray for
[1:45:16] their sheep I got a painting in my
[1:45:18] office sister Dorothy painted it's a
[1:45:20] one-off there's not another one like it
[1:45:22] in the world she painted it just for me
[1:45:24] I said sister Dorothy I see myself it's
[1:45:26] in the late night I'm standing in a
[1:45:28] field all my sheep are bedded down
[1:45:30] asleep and I see Jesus standing on a
[1:45:33] rock and I'm standing there as a
[1:45:34] shepherd and he's the great Shepherd and
[1:45:36] I'm gesturing to this and but Lord what
[1:45:37] about this one in this case and this
[1:45:39] need and he's gesturing saying okay for
[1:45:41] this one do this and for this one do
[1:45:42] this and you go into my office and look
[1:45:44] sister Dorothy painted my vision it came
[1:45:46] out of my mind and came onto a canvas
[1:45:49] and I and I and and I don't know what's
[1:45:51] happening in your lives but brother
[1:45:52] Jason finds himself often saying Lord
[1:45:54] for this family for this brother for
[1:45:56] this sister for this teenager I pray
[1:45:58] today today that you bring him a little
[1:46:00] closer
[1:46:02] don't let them go to bed until they come
[1:46:04] a little closer to the image you saw of
[1:46:07] them before the foundation of the world
[1:46:12] see he saw the life that he saw me
[1:46:15] before the foundation of the world
[1:46:17] that's why he taught us to pray thy
[1:46:20] kingdom come thy will be done in earth
[1:46:23] as it is in heaven thy will be done as
[1:46:26] in heaven he says it in Luke backwards
[1:46:29] in heaven so in Earth see so our actions
[1:46:33] then become literally friends I don't
[1:46:34] think we realize at all times that our
[1:46:37] actions are are more often than not
[1:46:40] becoming the expression of God's mind
[1:46:44] and I think I'd like for you to go into
[1:46:46] 2023 with that
[1:46:50] on at the front of your mind because the
[1:46:53] whole Plan of Redemption at the end time
[1:46:55] was to produce a bride who would be the
[1:46:58] flesh
[1:47:00] expression of the invisible God
[1:47:04] that he would be seen by the world
[1:47:07] in you
[1:47:08] so you want to you want to prayer for
[1:47:11] for tonight say Lord thank you for this
[1:47:14] wonderful day give me a good night's
[1:47:16] resting in the morning when I Rise give
[1:47:18] me a little more Jesus so that I can go
[1:47:21] forward and I can be a greater
[1:47:23] expression of you friends don't pray for
[1:47:25] anything till you get all of that that's
[1:47:27] becoming my all-consuming prayer Lord
[1:47:29] more and more and more and more less of
[1:47:33] me more of you less of me more of you
[1:47:35] till there's none of me and it's all of
[1:47:36] you
[1:47:39] that's that's really the true
[1:47:41] interaction between Heaven and Earth
[1:47:43] that's what it's all about
[1:47:44] that's the interaction between Heaven
[1:47:47] and Earth you have a dimensional portal
[1:47:49] that's what prayer is
[1:47:52] it literally I'm here to tell you
[1:47:54] something I went through a dimensional
[1:47:56] portal here a couple weeks ago brother
[1:47:58] Matthew sat in an office and told us
[1:48:00] last night that a dimensional portal
[1:48:02] opened up and a being stepped into his
[1:48:04] office
[1:48:05] Hallelujah and I I went back and I was
[1:48:08] looking at his text he was trying to
[1:48:10] explain it to me said dad is so
[1:48:11] incredible he said I was scared but
[1:48:13] there were but it wasn't fear
[1:48:15] he said I was scared but it wasn't
[1:48:17] anxiety
[1:48:19] how do you be scared with no fear and
[1:48:21] anxiety that takes a supernatural
[1:48:23] presence
[1:48:24] oh my this is why Paul would say
[1:48:28] First Corinthians 10 11 Noah First
[1:48:31] Corinthians 10 11.
[1:48:34] now all these things happened unto them
[1:48:36] for examples and they are written for
[1:48:39] our admonition upon whom the ends of the
[1:48:43] world are come so so without the mind of
[1:48:47] Christ restored back
[1:48:49] you know I mean the the whole purpose is
[1:48:52] to see these great secrets in the back
[1:48:55] part of God's mind if we don't have that
[1:49:01] then we're no better offer further along
[1:49:05] than the Bible students of History
[1:49:10] and that that's what they had
[1:49:12] I mean there has to come something to
[1:49:15] finish this thing
[1:49:17] it can't just keep going to another age
[1:49:19] there aren't any more ages
[1:49:22] and so there has to be something more
[1:49:25] than just history students uh taking our
[1:49:28] taking giving our opinion with the rest
[1:49:30] of the theological World our opinion
[1:49:33] with 33 000 other denominational
[1:49:35] opinions that was never going to bring
[1:49:37] Heaven and Earth together
[1:49:39] it would take the voice of God speaking
[1:49:42] to us in this day
[1:49:44] Hallelujah
[1:49:47] see so that it's so that even if history
[1:49:49] can be known
[1:49:51] and much of it is and the world is still
[1:49:54] crashing and burning modern Christianity
[1:49:56] leading the way
[1:49:58] see because the way can't be known
[1:50:00] intellectually
[1:50:02] see with all of their brilliant
[1:50:05] scholarship the world is steadily
[1:50:08] getting worse and always has been
[1:50:11] and has never turned around and from the
[1:50:14] time that Lucifer was cast out of heaven
[1:50:16] and giving keys to the bottomless pit
[1:50:18] that was gonna that was going to bring
[1:50:20] on the the first woe which was going to
[1:50:22] lead to the second which was going to
[1:50:24] lead to the third which was going to a
[1:50:26] white man sweet man from the face of the
[1:50:28] Earth but there's an injunction here you
[1:50:30] got to hold up I got servants I got a
[1:50:32] seal there's a dreadful day of the Lord
[1:50:35] coming in Malachi but hold on I got a
[1:50:37] first send Elijah get my pride out of
[1:50:39] the way
[1:50:41] otherwise friends if it's not that then
[1:50:43] we're no we're in no better position
[1:50:45] than all the rest of them
[1:50:47] oh but God rich in mercy God did
[1:50:51] something more than just give us
[1:50:52] intellectualism
[1:50:56] he opened those Seven Seals you see
[1:51:03] the confusion and there was confusion in
[1:51:05] the early days I remembered I grew up
[1:51:06] through it sitting in ministers meetings
[1:51:08] and hearing them talking is the seven
[1:51:11] seal open is it not is it is it not yes
[1:51:13] it is no it's not well it's not to the
[1:51:16] public but it is to the bride what does
[1:51:17] that even mean
[1:51:18] and and you know they but now at that
[1:51:22] but now that we come these decades later
[1:51:24] I can tell you Ministry around the world
[1:51:27] understand that of course it's open the
[1:51:30] confusion as to whether or not the
[1:51:31] seventh seal was indeed open was due in
[1:51:34] part to the infant age of the Bride when
[1:51:37] she was born remember she was an infant
[1:51:39] remember when Jesus was coming three
[1:51:42] stars lined up the Wise Men followed
[1:51:43] them
[1:51:44] remember that and and brother Branham
[1:51:47] shows now as as the seals are getting
[1:51:49] ready to come as the mighty Angels
[1:51:51] getting ready to descend a seventh angel
[1:51:53] standing on the earth waiting
[1:51:55] see he's already a messenger to Leo to
[1:51:58] see it to a church age but he's not in
[1:51:59] the ministry of Malachi for you that
[1:52:01] doesn't come to the opening of the seals
[1:52:02] now he crosses under a new anointing and
[1:52:05] because the age put Christ out and
[1:52:06] rejected him and now that Prophet is not
[1:52:09] trying to get people into that church
[1:52:10] he's trying to get him out of it
[1:52:12] come out of her that's the message of
[1:52:14] the Hour come out of her my people why
[1:52:17] should I come out of this church because
[1:52:18] you're you're being a partaker of her
[1:52:20] sin and you're going to be destroyed
[1:52:22] with her
[1:52:24] see so come out come up come out where
[1:52:27] come up higher come up into the opening
[1:52:29] of the word
[1:52:32] but she was an infant when she was born
[1:52:34] brother Branham says that on tape he
[1:52:35] says five stars lined up right before
[1:52:37] the seals open he said what was it it
[1:52:40] was a it was an announcement it was
[1:52:42] announcing uh an infant bride
[1:52:46] it was it was he says it was announcing
[1:52:49] her approach
[1:52:51] she was about to be birthed like genesis
[1:52:53] by the word
[1:52:54] um
[1:52:56] see so part of the reason
[1:53:00] for the confusion was in part at least
[1:53:03] to the infant age of the word born bride
[1:53:04] she wasn't realizing that although open
[1:53:07] that although it was open now follow me
[1:53:11] closely because this is really heavy on
[1:53:13] my heart I want you to understand this
[1:53:16] concept
[1:53:18] she wasn't realizing
[1:53:20] at her young tender age
[1:53:23] that although it was certainly open its
[1:53:27] Fuller understanding would come with her
[1:53:30] future growth going forward
[1:53:33] by that I mean that when we begin to see
[1:53:36] that it was open we realize now what the
[1:53:39] prophet has said not only during the
[1:53:41] seals Seven Seals series but even more
[1:53:44] at what he said after the Seven Seals
[1:53:47] opened see that's why when you come to
[1:53:50] what is the attraction on the mountain
[1:53:52] brother Adam's a shocked and stunned and
[1:53:55] he's he's saying my goodness what
[1:53:57] happened back there in Coronado Forest
[1:53:59] 30 miles north of Tucson
[1:54:01] it's just Dawning on him even as a
[1:54:04] prophet wow I see it now it was a
[1:54:07] setting of Prophecy a setting of History
[1:54:09] and he's trying to get this young little
[1:54:11] bride to understand when we begin to see
[1:54:14] that it was open and we realize what a
[1:54:17] prophet said about it during the seals
[1:54:18] and after the seals regarding the coming
[1:54:20] of the Lord I mean the sermons preached
[1:54:23] after the seals made us realize that the
[1:54:27] mystery hidden under the seventh seal
[1:54:30] was to be understood as the word coming
[1:54:34] into the bride
[1:54:39] and I've thought a lot about how I
[1:54:41] worded that I want to say it again
[1:54:43] the sermons preached after the seals
[1:54:46] particularly made us realize as we began
[1:54:48] to grow and mature and decade fell upon
[1:54:51] decade
[1:54:52] we've begun to realize that the mystery
[1:54:54] hidden under the seventh seal was to be
[1:54:58] understood as the word forming itself
[1:55:01] and a bride
[1:55:04] you understand me that's why
[1:55:07] that's why it's still a mystery to the
[1:55:13] world
[1:55:14] and it wouldn't matter if they heard the
[1:55:17] whole seven seal series and it wouldn't
[1:55:19] matter if they heard all the Menace the
[1:55:21] sermons after the Seven Seals it still
[1:55:24] takes a revelation
[1:55:27] it still requires the Holy Spirit to
[1:55:31] break it upon us
[1:55:33] the greatest revelation we can have and
[1:55:36] the one brother Branham taught us to
[1:55:38] pray for above all other Revelation was
[1:55:41] the rebel was a revelation of who we are
[1:55:45] in Christ
[1:55:49] this is why we spend so much time
[1:55:52] getting the devil off your back about
[1:55:55] your past failures
[1:55:57] let me say today is an authoritative
[1:55:59] voice he has no charge against you that
[1:56:03] God will hear
[1:56:04] this bride stands flawless
[1:56:08] she's a flawless diamond and he will not
[1:56:12] hear a charge against her this is what
[1:56:15] the opening of the seals has done
[1:56:21] that's the super weapon of mass
[1:56:23] destruction
[1:56:24] that the devil doesn't want you to know
[1:56:27] see that's the one we wield against the
[1:56:30] devil now brother Branham says by God's
[1:56:33] spirit
[1:56:33] to discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:56:36] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:56:39] her
[1:56:41] he will be as definitely thwarted today
[1:56:44] as when Christ withstood his every
[1:56:46] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:56:48] desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we
[1:56:51] love it
[1:56:53] with true Revelation in our eye in our
[1:56:56] lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:56:58] against us but we Prevail over them
[1:57:02] I've thought about Prevail over them
[1:57:04] yeah all those demons trying to hold
[1:57:06] those Gates I just kick them down and
[1:57:08] crush them and I just walk right over
[1:57:09] the top of them walk right into my
[1:57:11] Promised Land he's not keeping me
[1:57:14] out of out of Zion Hallelujah because
[1:57:17] Zion is my promise
[1:57:19] I'm gonna restore Zion I'm gonna restore
[1:57:22] all the years that the canker worm in my
[1:57:24] arm and everything Satan did I'm going
[1:57:27] to take it all back and I'm going to
[1:57:28] finish you
[1:57:30] and as I finish you you're going to
[1:57:32] finish him
[1:57:33] see
[1:57:35] so the mystery you remember the
[1:57:37] the mystery that Paul spoke of
[1:57:41] uh
[1:57:43] Ephesians 3 Noah
[1:57:48] Ephesians 3 now watch
[1:57:50] here's the mystery
[1:57:53] verse 8. through 13. unto me who are
[1:57:57] less than the least of All Saints
[1:57:59] is this Grace given that I should preach
[1:58:02] among the Gentiles The unsearchable
[1:58:03] Riches of Christ
[1:58:05] and to make all men see what is the
[1:58:08] Fellowship of the mystery so now the
[1:58:10] mystery is not a Doctrine
[1:58:12] the mystery wants Fellowship
[1:58:15] so the mystery's a person
[1:58:18] it's not a teaching
[1:58:20] it's not books and tapes and quotes
[1:58:23] you understand it's a person
[1:58:26] Hallelujah
[1:58:28] see
[1:58:29] and here's why so Paul's desire is to
[1:58:32] make all men see
[1:58:33] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[1:58:36] which from the beginning of the world
[1:58:38] hath been hidden God see this is the
[1:58:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost who created
[1:58:42] All Things by Jesus Christ remember he
[1:58:44] said I'll
[1:58:45] pull you out of the mire and I'll
[1:58:47] sprinkle clean water on you I'll justify
[1:58:50] you of all your past sins now
[1:58:51] justification is great for your past
[1:58:53] sins I don't help you in the future
[1:58:55] see the the foolish virgin get that
[1:58:58] they get Justified of all their past
[1:58:59] sins they repent and God forgives all
[1:59:01] their sins and they even get the second
[1:59:03] stage of of the Holy Ghost in
[1:59:05] sanctification on their flesh and they
[1:59:06] live Sanctified lives because Matthew 25
[1:59:08] shows that they're righteous people
[1:59:10] they're Saints which means sanctified
[1:59:13] so the foolish version is not the Tommy
[1:59:15] right of Christianity you see
[1:59:16] represented today foolish virgin are
[1:59:18] sanctified people
[1:59:20] period in the story they're Sanctified
[1:59:22] they're righteous living
[1:59:24] see
[1:59:25] and so
[1:59:26] so but but he but he said I won't stop
[1:59:29] there I'll I'll bring you out and I'll
[1:59:31] sprinkle clean water on you I'll clean
[1:59:33] you up
[1:59:34] and then I'll give you a new spirit see
[1:59:37] there's sanctification he says but then
[1:59:40] I'll give you my spirit now there's the
[1:59:43] token and when I pour my spirit in you I
[1:59:47] will cause you to keep my word
[1:59:50] he's not saying you won't ever make a
[1:59:52] mistake he's saying you'll never
[1:59:53] disbelieve again
[1:59:55] you'll accept and say Amen to every word
[1:59:58] and even if I can't produce it I want to
[2:00:00] and even if I'm failing I say God
[2:00:02] forgive me help me help me to be all
[2:00:05] that the word
[2:00:07] has said about me
[2:00:10] to the intent verse 10 to the intent
[2:00:12] that now under the principalities and
[2:00:15] powers in Heavenly places might be known
[2:00:17] by the church the manifold wisdom of God
[2:00:20] according to the Eternal purpose which
[2:00:22] he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord and
[2:00:25] whom
[2:00:25] we have boldness and access with
[2:00:27] confidence by the faith of him wherefore
[2:00:29] I desire that you faint not in my
[2:00:32] tribulation my tribulations for you
[2:00:33] which is your glory
[2:00:35] see so so the body then
[2:00:39] so the opening of The Seven Seals would
[2:00:41] show
[2:00:42] that the body of Christ is literally
[2:00:44] seen
[2:00:45] as a pyramid
[2:00:47] now Peter Built that thing
[2:00:49] see said it starts out with a foundation
[2:00:51] of faith that's your that's your new
[2:00:53] birth you're not it's not it's not it's
[2:00:55] not perfect Faith until you're born
[2:00:57] again
[2:00:57] see and then you're adding on top of
[2:01:00] that adding on top of that you're not
[2:01:01] you're not waiting to get good enough to
[2:01:04] get the crown
[2:01:05] you're already Good Enough by
[2:01:07] predestination
[2:01:08] you've surrendered your life and
[2:01:10] repented of your sins and your past from
[2:01:12] Death unto life and now God is building
[2:01:14] on top of you this and this and this and
[2:01:16] this and this
[2:01:17] now quite naturally he's not gonna
[2:01:20] expend a lot of power through you if
[2:01:23] you're not willing to add and add and
[2:01:25] add and add an ad he's not he's not an
[2:01:28] unwise father who just spoils his
[2:01:29] children hands out Supernatural power
[2:01:31] like candy
[2:01:32] you're going to have to add to Faith
[2:01:34] virtue you're gonna have to add to
[2:01:35] Virtual you're gonna have to add you're
[2:01:36] gonna have to add in some brotherly
[2:01:38] kindness you're gonna have to add in
[2:01:39] some Temperance you're going to have to
[2:01:40] work on that
[2:01:42] see
[2:01:43] so the body is seen as a pyramid of the
[2:01:46] history of the true church it's divided
[2:01:48] into seven Church ages with their
[2:01:50] Messengers to each age and their
[2:01:51] accompanying message so the res the
[2:01:54] restoration
[2:01:55] restored Paul's vision of the mystery
[2:01:59] that's what this restoration has
[2:02:02] accomplished
[2:02:03] it has restored Paul's vision of the
[2:02:06] mystery
[2:02:08] it literally took a church in Decline
[2:02:11] the first thing it had was falling
[2:02:12] through the first through the second
[2:02:14] through the third my goodness by the
[2:02:16] time they got to the fourth they'd
[2:02:17] crowned a false prophet
[2:02:19] I mean this is bad
[2:02:21] see I mean it's where Satan's seed is
[2:02:24] goodness gracious see and so so God's
[2:02:27] got a first stop ah the decline
[2:02:32] arrested
[2:02:34] turn it around okay Luther you ready yes
[2:02:38] sir Lord all right launch and we start
[2:02:40] building it back
[2:02:42] John Wesley get ready
[2:02:45] get ready I'm ready sir
[2:02:47] six star slings it into the earth now
[2:02:50] the church takes another step get ready
[2:02:52] you Azusa revivalist because I'm going
[2:02:55] to pour out the promise of Joel and I'm
[2:02:58] going to bring restore gifts and and
[2:03:00] power back to the church you know why
[2:03:01] you know why brother I said God did that
[2:03:03] because the church didn't it although it
[2:03:06] was a true church it didn't seem to have
[2:03:08] the power at ought to have
[2:03:10] and so God turns loose gifts and signs
[2:03:13] and wonders and restores that back to
[2:03:14] the church why anybody would want to
[2:03:17] shut that down is a mystery to me
[2:03:21] I mean if you're going to shut the gifts
[2:03:23] down shut the fruits of the spirit down
[2:03:25] I want all of all of it
[2:03:27] I want all the fruits and all the gifts
[2:03:29] and I want all the operation I want all
[2:03:30] the complete Liberty of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:34] we have to be afraid of that we're a
[2:03:36] mature bride we're not an infant bride
[2:03:37] anymore
[2:03:39] chasing after Pentecostalism we got the
[2:03:42] real Pentecost
[2:03:44] the true foundation of the church
[2:03:47] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's
[2:03:51] what we're enjoying today friends that's
[2:03:53] what the sales restore to us
[2:03:56] I'll not give away my inheritance it's
[2:03:59] your inheritance it belongs to you
[2:04:05] [Applause]
[2:04:08] that's why a prophet had to see a bride
[2:04:09] brought in review twice he sees the
[2:04:12] alpha Church he's rejoicing and then
[2:04:14] here comes the here comes the Church of
[2:04:16] of of the ages and it's not really the
[2:04:19] bride it's the church and it gets worse
[2:04:21] and worse and worse
[2:04:22] until he gets to the last one he can't
[2:04:23] even look at it
[2:04:25] it's so vulgar
[2:04:27] it's such it's such vulgarity and
[2:04:30] nastiness
[2:04:31] and and partial partial you know
[2:04:34] indecency and and worldly music and
[2:04:37] they've turned Church worship into a
[2:04:39] rock and roll affair
[2:04:41] and it doesn't even matter they can
[2:04:43] stand up there when women with their
[2:04:45] bobbed off hair contrary to the
[2:04:47] scripture and cry real tears thinking
[2:04:49] they're worshiping God and they're
[2:04:51] worshiping Lucifer
[2:04:52] because the Bible teaches that they have
[2:04:55] forsaken the word of God
[2:04:57] oh come out of her my people Barry be
[2:05:00] free today I'm giving you a word of
[2:05:03] Liberty rejoice in the in the Liberty
[2:05:05] that God has given us
[2:05:09] men can get up there and smoke and drink
[2:05:12] and curse and Corrals married three and
[2:05:14] four or five times and get up there and
[2:05:16] be pastors and preachers and teachers
[2:05:18] vomit
[2:05:20] that's vomit that's a Bible word not my
[2:05:23] word their tables are filled with vomit
[2:05:26] that's not the power of God this is the
[2:05:30] power of God when this becomes living
[2:05:32] flesh that's God living in his church
[2:05:36] Hallelujah
[2:05:38] see
[2:05:40] so the bride he couldn't look at it but
[2:05:42] finally a bride has to be brought back
[2:05:44] again
[2:05:46] and he said I heard
[2:05:48] somebody was marching
[2:05:50] and he said I looked and here come that
[2:05:51] sainted bunch of little girls all clean
[2:05:57] smooth long hair flowing down their back
[2:06:00] brother says no paint no makeup none of
[2:06:03] the world's nonsense they didn't they
[2:06:05] didn't look like they went into a five
[2:06:07] and dime with a magnet on and covered up
[2:06:10] in every kind of nonsense Hallelujah
[2:06:12] this this bride was clean and she was
[2:06:15] smooth and she was Marching In the
[2:06:18] harmony of the word marching to the step
[2:06:20] of the gospel and what was it it was an
[2:06:22] old-timey song Onward Christian Soldiers
[2:06:26] hallelujah how many Christian Soldiers
[2:06:28] we got here today that are willing to
[2:06:30] march on to Zion
[2:06:37] oh my
[2:06:40] she was marching to the rhythm of the
[2:06:41] word
[2:06:42] that's sheet music
[2:06:44] that Jesus Christ composed himself oh go
[2:06:48] listen to Shalom go listen to the
[2:06:49] Masterpiece it was a symphony this bride
[2:06:53] was to play out the music that he wrote
[2:06:56] this is this is music see he wrote this
[2:06:59] oh friends do you understand do you
[2:07:03] understand that
[2:07:06] this isn't a report card

[2:07:15] in love with the King

[2:07:26] those things anymore and the word is now
[2:07:28] becoming behind skin
[2:07:30] oh my oh my oh my
[2:07:34] the kingdom

[2:07:38] today
[2:07:40] they want to run up and down the road
[2:07:42] and say there's a non-negotiable oh yeah
[2:07:45] what is it you have to believe the
[2:07:46] trinity
[2:07:48] really
[2:07:49] so you understand Paul didn't believe
[2:07:51] what you believe about that
[2:07:53] neither did Peter neither did John so
[2:07:55] does that mean they're out
[2:07:57] they didn't believe what the Trinity
[2:07:59] teaches today not at all not even a
[2:08:01] little bit not even third cousin twice
[2:08:02] removed
[2:08:03] laughs
[2:08:05] and believe it at all
[2:08:08] you know Paul Paul knew exactly who he
[2:08:10] was
[2:08:11] it's the word of God it's Christ it's
[2:08:13] Christ seeking to live in you that's the
[2:08:16] godhead it's Christ expressing himself
[2:08:18] from Genesis in a family and letting it
[2:08:21] go through the whole Plan of Redemption
[2:08:22] and restoring it back and that bride is
[2:08:25] literally living the sheet music of the
[2:08:28] word oh there's there's non-negotiables
[2:08:30] you better believe there's some
[2:08:31] non-negotiables first non-negotiable is
[2:08:34] you must be born again
[2:08:36] oh do your better good to join a church

[2:09:17] two non-negotiables you know the the the
[2:09:21] the the world tries to make the Trinity
[2:09:23] a non-negotiable there are two
[2:09:25] non-negotiable elements to redemption in
[2:09:28] the last days and neither one of them
[2:09:31] are a construct of human intellectualism
[2:09:36] you have to be born again by the baptism
[2:09:39] of the Holy Ghost
[2:09:42] and the only way that comes is when God
[2:09:45] Reveals His word and you agree and say
[2:09:48] Amen to every word that he has revealed
[2:09:52] every word that he reveals you have to
[2:09:55] say me Lord me right here
[2:09:57] Me Count Me In I'll take it that's me
[2:10:00] I'll believe it I'll not only blow not
[2:10:02] only hear it I'll receive it I'll act
[2:10:04] upon it
[2:10:05] amen hallelujah all act upon it
[2:10:08] see and and and and and then in the last
[2:10:11] day we had to have the perfect word
[2:10:14] it had to be restored back because it
[2:10:17] was Paul's perfect teaching that was
[2:10:19] taking them to a body change only they
[2:10:20] backslid
[2:10:22] and so it began to decline so if he's
[2:10:24] going to get it if he's going to get a
[2:10:25] bride raptured he can't come with some
[2:10:28] partial truth in the ages
[2:10:30] he's got to he's got to have a vessel
[2:10:32] that can go all the way back and pick up
[2:10:34] Paul's original teaching buy-ins by
[2:10:37] prophetic inspiration and bring the full
[2:10:40] message back to a full bride who can
[2:10:42] have full faith and get a full body
[2:10:43] change so another non-negotiable it had
[2:10:46] to be a prophet
[2:10:48] that is non-negotiable it had to come to
[2:10:51] a profit because you had to be born
[2:10:54] again by the Holy Ghost
[2:10:58] and Prophets are they rightly divide the
[2:11:01] word of Truth amen Maya I could just
[2:11:04] keep going I could keep going I could
[2:11:06] keep going we'll catch it for another
[2:11:07] time I'm already into overtime stand up
[2:11:10] with me friends
