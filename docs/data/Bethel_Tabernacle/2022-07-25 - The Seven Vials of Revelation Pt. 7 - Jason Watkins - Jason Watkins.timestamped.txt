[0:01] are you catching I just hope I'm not
[0:03] confusing you I hope it's clear
[0:06] what is wrong is the way of Cinema
[0:07] sometimes it's not even sin it's just
[0:09] misunderstanding of people I think each
[0:12] one of us has a right to express
[0:13] ourselves to our understanding
[0:17] not that we disagree with you brother
[0:19] this is known to ones at the end time to
[0:21] be different many of you here might be
[0:23] trinitarian preachers we don't want to
[0:25] be angry with you we love you a
[0:28] trinitarian preacher
[0:31] we love you
[0:34] amen but yet somehow we have other
[0:36] message preachers that we can't stand
[0:38] and we hate
[0:41] and we're out to destroy and out to take
[0:43] a sword to yet the prophet says I love
[0:45] you trinitarian preachers
[0:49] we don't want to be angry with you we
[0:51] love you if we didn't if I didn't
[0:53] believe that
[0:54] I'd never leave this church till I got
[0:57] down there on my knees and said God make
[1:00] me right
[1:02] I don't want that arrogant selfish
[1:05] Spirit mixed up with mine
[1:08] raise my hand and say I don't want it
[1:10] Lord
[1:11] I want my spirit to be pure
[1:15] how many can raise a hand clean
[1:18] Brotherly Love holy he says holy with
[1:21] Holy Spirit now if someone does anything
[1:23] wrong to me that's all right
[1:25] and though I might have the right to get
[1:27] back at them I don't want that in my
[1:29] life
[1:30] I want to have love
[1:33] I want to be ready to correct
[1:37] with love
[1:39] so it was a balance
[1:41] he brought correction you can bring
[1:43] correction you can stand for the truth
[1:45] you can stand on your convictions you
[1:47] can be uncompromising and unwavering
[1:50] but you can be angry and sin not
[1:54] I want to be ready to correct with love
[1:56] with love that absolutely answers out of
[1:58] you out yonder for it I don't mean to be
[2:01] different Methodist Baptist Catholic
[2:03] Presbyterian whoever you are I don't say
[2:04] these things to be different be Arrogant
[2:06] with you if I did I'm a hypocrite and
[2:08] should be down here at this altar
[2:10] praying through to God but I say it's
[2:12] because of love I say it because of love
[2:15] and see where you're going now I don't
[2:18] say this in myself and say it I'm
[2:19] presuming I give you thus saith the Lord
[2:22] that is the truth and I love you for
[2:24] those things God bless you I'd rather
[2:26] this is where I'm going to end I'd
[2:27] rather have a church listen just for a
[2:31] moment I would rather have a church that
[2:34] knows nothing about any spiritual gift
[2:37] and just be so in love with each other
[2:41] and with Christ I'd rather have that
[2:44] than every spiritual gift operating in
[2:47] the church
[2:50] I'd rather have a church so in love one
[2:54] with another so in Harmony One with
[2:56] another I'd rather have that than all
[3:00] the spiritual gifts in my church
[3:02] how could brother Branham say that
[3:05] he's preaching against well did not the
[3:07] Apostle Paul say I can speak all know
[3:09] all the Mysteries
[3:11] I can speak in the tongues of men and
[3:13] angels and have not love
[3:17] I have nothing
[3:19] and he says I would rather have that
[3:21] than all the gifts operate in the church
[3:23] now that might sound hard in a
[3:24] Pentecostal group but I would rather
[3:26] have it where there is gifts they'll
[3:29] fail where there is gifts they'll bring
[3:31] confusion where there is gifts that they
[3:33] can be questioned but where there is
[3:35] love it is perfect that's right and if
[3:38] notice there's the key and if you had
[3:41] perfect love you'd have perfect gifts
[3:44] that's right
[3:46] so work first with love
[3:50] that brings fellowship and fellowship
[3:53] brings gifts
[3:56] Give the Lord a hand clap of praise
[4:02] Lord we thank you this morning for your
[4:04] word how accurate it is
[4:06] how laser accurate it is
[4:10] Lord you hit the bullseye your word hits
[4:12] the Mark we fail Lord we miss it
[4:15] but your word hits the mark every time
[4:17] in our heart May It Be an Arrow of
[4:19] Deliverance
[4:21] Lord where we can be delivered from
[4:22] ourself to have true christ-like love
[4:25] not worldly inclusive everybody just
[4:28] gets in and it doesn't matter no that's
[4:30] not true love Lord
[4:33] that's not true anger either
[4:35] Lord but real righteous indignation is
[4:37] to be able to tell someone that they're
[4:39] wrong and still love them
[4:41] and still showing and reflect Christ
[4:45] that's what we want Lord we just raise
[4:47] our hand and say we want to reflect you
[4:49] and all of our nature and all of our
[4:51] actions and all of our reactions help us
[4:53] to reflect you
[4:55] Lord I pray you take this teaching take
[4:57] this service Lord the minister of your
[4:59] word in Jesus name amen amen
[5:07] amen

[49:54] and so father asking to you to you to
[49:57] touch him as well today we commit all of
[50:00] these things now in the reading the
[50:02] preaching and the hearing of the word
[50:03] there is a blessing the Bible says in
[50:05] just reading it there's even a blessing
[50:08] in just hearing it read so we're
[50:10] counting on you for that blessing today
[50:12] we commit it to you in Jesus name amen
[50:15] God bless you Luke chapter 17 while
[50:18] you're standing
[50:20] Luke chapter 17 I think that was all of
[50:23] my announcements
[50:29] amen
[50:49] amen praise the Lord
[50:53] Luke Chapter 17. now let me get all of
[50:57] my
[50:58] ducks in a row here
[51:02] we're continuing Today part 7 teaching
[51:05] on the seven vows of Revelation now
[51:07] we've just remind you again we're we're
[51:10] very deep into this series we've already
[51:13] covered
[51:14] um you know as far as like looking at at
[51:17] um at the seven vials as they relate to
[51:20] the symbology there we're really only
[51:22] dealing with One released into the air
[51:24] because uh it appears from everything
[51:27] that I can see as a student that the
[51:29] rest of it will be in the in the
[51:32] tribulation period so brother Branham
[51:35] only identified clearly the part that
[51:39] was released into the air and announced
[51:41] to us and I put the quotes up here that
[51:44] those judgments you are reading under
[51:45] that vial began with the Alaska
[51:47] earthquake and there that's why you see
[51:50] the world going into the situation it's
[51:52] in it's because there's a there's a an
[51:55] Airborne infection in the minds of
[51:58] mankind driving the insanity of the
[52:01] world and leading him to a tribulation
[52:04] period I'm glad we're going to be taken
[52:07] out amen do you want to hear come up
[52:11] amen do you want to hear come up
[52:13] amen will you make sure you hear come
[52:15] out
[52:16] because if you don't hear come out and
[52:18] you don't follow that you'll never hear
[52:20] come up
[52:21] amen amen Luke 17 and we'll we'll read
[52:28] this portion of it so Matt I I think I
[52:31] posted to you that we would go from Luke
[52:34] and then into Matthew but once we read
[52:36] Luke then put my PowerPoint up and I'll
[52:38] catch Matthew there amen Luke 17
[52:42] verse 24.
[52:45] for as the lightning
[52:47] that shineth out of one part under
[52:50] Heaven shineth unto the other part under
[52:54] heaven
[52:55] so shall also the son of man be
[52:58] in his day so this is all going to
[53:01] happen under Heaven before the bride
[53:04] goes home all right this is not going to
[53:07] happen in heaven this is happening under
[53:09] Heaven it's just like when you look at
[53:12] the tribes of Dan and Ephraim you can
[53:15] see it in the Old Testament but when you
[53:17] when you when you when you look at at
[53:20] God showing the the tribes on the other
[53:23] side that Dan and Ephraim are are
[53:26] omitted because they were put out of the
[53:29] family under heaven but when you read
[53:32] the millennial scriptures and the new
[53:34] heavens and the new Earth you find them
[53:36] put back because brother Branham said it
[53:39] was only under heaven but they're
[53:41] written in the palms of his hands they
[53:43] can never deny them they'll be restored
[53:45] in Heaven All right so so we read here
[53:49] something that's happening in human
[53:50] history uh from the lightning out of one
[53:55] part under Heaven shineth unto the other
[53:57] part under heaven so shall also the son
[54:01] of man be in his day but first must he
[54:05] suffer many things verse 25 and be
[54:08] rejected of this generation
[54:10] all right now that's uh that's uh it
[54:13] sounds like it's a one-off but you've
[54:16] just heard that it's from east to west
[54:19] so as the generations move in every
[54:22] generation he was rejected in every
[54:25] generation including this last
[54:27] generation this is why the unwise Virgin
[54:32] who is the remnant of the woman's seed
[54:36] she goes into the tribulation a Time the
[54:39] Bible says there's never been a
[54:41] tribulation like it in the earth say my
[54:43] it's like why did why did the seventh
[54:45] age the the first six uh ages of the
[54:48] foolish virgin didn't have to they're
[54:50] not gonna have to go through that you're
[54:52] correct why does the seventh because
[54:54] they rejected the consummation of all
[54:56] the ages and all the messages and
[54:58] everything they rejected the greatest
[55:00] message that the Earth has ever had
[55:02] Christ in his second appearing that this
[55:05] is the greatest uh of all of them
[55:08] because this is the consummation of
[55:09] everything all right so first must he
[55:13] suffer many things and be rejected of
[55:15] this generation now watch
[55:18] is going to now talk about the end time
[55:20] we're going to make a multi-millennial
[55:22] leap to the last age verse 26 and as it
[55:25] was in the days of Noah so shall it be
[55:28] also in the days of the son of man they
[55:31] did eat they drank they married wives
[55:34] they were given in marriage sounds like
[55:36] our day right until the day that Noah
[55:39] entered into the ark and the flood came
[55:42] and destroyed them all likewise also as
[55:46] it was in the days of lot
[55:50] now we've pointed out to you that this
[55:53] that's one of the unique Mark markers
[55:56] for the last day where the only age this
[56:00] is one way we're unique there's a number
[56:02] of ways there's one of them this last
[56:04] day bride must face the days of Noah
[56:08] and the days of lot simultaneously
[56:12] it's like a double barrel shotgun we're
[56:14] the only age that's ever had to face
[56:15] that see all right verse 28 likewise
[56:18] also as it was in the days of lot they
[56:20] did eat they drank they bought they sold
[56:22] they planted they builted but the same
[56:24] day that lot went out of Sodom it rained
[56:26] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[56:29] destroyed them all so once The
[56:31] Messengers to Sodom were gone off the
[56:35] scene the fire fell
[56:38] all right and the two Messengers to
[56:40] Sodom have gone off the scene all right
[56:43] but the same day that lot went out of
[56:45] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[56:47] heaven and destroyed them all even thus
[56:49] here it is here's another clue again
[56:51] even thus shall it be in the day when
[56:53] the son of man is revealed may the Lord
[56:56] bless the reading of his word and you
[56:57] can be seated
[57:05] amen
[57:12] amen
[57:14] praise the Lord so I I'm I'm I know she
[57:18] told me not to do it but I or not to
[57:20] make a big deal out of it but I sure am
[57:22] missing uh the first lady today and
[57:24] she's visiting with some friends and
[57:26] went to see sister Sherry so I'll
[57:28] probably only preach 15 minutes today
[57:29] because when I get out of here I'm going
[57:31] to get her
[57:32] so but I'll let you know when I start
[57:34] preaching don't start timing me till I
[57:36] till I let you know amen
[57:38] praise the Lord all right so now we're
[57:41] going to move to the overhead and we're
[57:45] continuing the seven vials of Revelation
[57:47] and today I want to take the subtitle
[57:51] earnestly contending for the faith and I
[57:55] I could have easily took taken that
[57:57] scripture and read that but uh it's it's
[57:59] not necessary you're familiar the church
[58:01] was warned to earnestly contend for the
[58:04] faith once delivered to the Saints
[58:06] that's because the Ephesus was going to
[58:09] fall away and it was going to go off and
[58:11] get worse and worse with each age Go off
[58:13] into the Dark Ages and then God would
[58:15] restore
[58:17] um in those same stages the four stages
[58:20] that ate it down the four stages would
[58:22] be its restoration and we are in the
[58:24] final fourth and last stage which is the
[58:26] fruit of Christ Living in the lives like
[58:29] fruit back in the top it's a bride tree
[58:32] amen and so we realize that we are now
[58:35] uh in that sequence of events it's a
[58:38] setting of History a setting of Prophecy
[58:41] as brother Brandon would call it so we
[58:43] find here then that uh we're going to
[58:47] continue now and I'm going to continue
[58:48] reading in the scripture but I wanted to
[58:50] put this on the overhead now we've read
[58:52] from the Gospel of Luke concerning the
[58:56] time when the ministry would go to the
[58:59] son of man now here's an important Point
[59:02] all right I got everybody's attention
[59:03] because we're subject preaching today
[59:06] it's kind of like teaching but I'm not
[59:08] suit so good at that I'm good at subject
[59:10] preaching so if I get going you'll
[59:13] understand why so and then you can start
[59:15] my 15-minute timer but but we find out
[59:18] that that when you when you look at the
[59:23] prophecy in the Book of Luke it shows us
[59:27] the hour that we have arrived at now
[59:29] that's important because I I'm saying to
[59:33] you that that's the that's the message
[59:36] we need to earnestly contend for the
[59:40] ministry of the son of man all right uh
[59:43] brought to us through the office of the
[59:46] son of man now I'm going to repeat some
[59:48] things that you all are taught well in
[59:50] but for the sake of the recording the
[59:52] archive and and streamers and visitors
[59:54] sometimes I have to repeat stuff when
[59:56] we're teaching like this but you're
[59:58] you're going to realize then that the
[1:00:01] that when God comes in restoration
[1:00:06] you're never going to diminish it's not
[1:00:09] a subtraction so when that which is
[1:00:12] perfect is come then that which is in
[1:00:15] part is done away you're familiar with
[1:00:17] that a lot of people take that to mean
[1:00:19] that when the perfect word comes we no
[1:00:22] longer need the gifts of the Spirit
[1:00:24] that's not what the Bible is saying
[1:00:26] because that's a reduction of the Holy
[1:00:29] Ghost you don't want to have that in
[1:00:31] your mind what it means is is that the
[1:00:34] way we operated them under partial
[1:00:36] understanding we no longer do it that
[1:00:38] way we now have full understanding amen
[1:00:42] so now it's a mature bride he was never
[1:00:44] coming to marry a little girl he was
[1:00:47] coming to marry a mature bride and
[1:00:49] that's the age we have arrived at so
[1:00:52] when he when he goes from the Son of God
[1:00:55] and he's in the he's in the ages of Son
[1:00:58] of God I still got your attention I'm
[1:01:01] going to really make some technical uh
[1:01:03] points here all right so when he was in
[1:01:06] the ages in the ministry of the son of
[1:01:08] God
[1:01:09] it's prophesied in Luke 17 that he's
[1:01:12] going to come at the end time in the
[1:01:14] last generation back in the office and
[1:01:18] Ministry he's coming back in the office
[1:01:21] of son of man to bring back the ministry
[1:01:24] of the son of man now the office is the
[1:01:26] prophet the ministry is the people who
[1:01:29] become the word
[1:01:30] because the ministry of the son of man
[1:01:33] is the word made flesh you got it the
[1:01:36] office is a prophet the office of Son of
[1:01:39] Man the ministry of the son of man is
[1:01:41] the word made flesh that's what Paul had
[1:01:43] in his day that's why this is a
[1:01:45] restoration of that original truth and
[1:01:48] that's the message we are to earnestly
[1:01:52] contend for
[1:01:54] I know it's and it's not about getting
[1:01:56] out I mean fine if you want to go on a
[1:01:58] street corner and declare Malachi 4 for
[1:02:01] um how
[1:02:03] you know but but what's but are you
[1:02:06] declaring it on the job are you
[1:02:08] declaring it in the schools by your life
[1:02:13] are you declaring it in your places of
[1:02:15] business is your life worthy of the
[1:02:18] Gospel does your life project the truth
[1:02:21] of what God has done in this hour
[1:02:25] see and so when he comes as son of man
[1:02:29] and he say all right then we don't have
[1:02:32] the age of Son of God anymore and
[1:02:34] there's where you'd be wrong because
[1:02:36] you're trying to make a reduction again
[1:02:38] remember that the that the ministry that
[1:02:42] Christ entered into remember when his
[1:02:45] Earthly Ministry he was son of man right
[1:02:47] he was the word made flesh am I right
[1:02:51] then then he went into the spirit and
[1:02:53] that's and now he's is in the ages and
[1:02:56] you say well he was in Son of God as a
[1:02:59] as a uh in the in the eternities
[1:03:02] interceding on behalf of the of the
[1:03:05] ignorance of the church well he
[1:03:07] eventually had to do that of course but
[1:03:09] that but that early church those first
[1:03:11] couple of early decades there was no
[1:03:14] ignorance they had the full Jubilee they
[1:03:17] had the token they had the opening of
[1:03:19] the word Paul understood Melchizedek
[1:03:22] Paul understood the coming of the Lord
[1:03:24] Paul understood the rapture
[1:03:26] you understand this message isn't an
[1:03:28] addition to Paul's teaching it's a
[1:03:30] restoration Paul understood election and
[1:03:34] serpent seed and baptism and the godhead
[1:03:37] and the Mystery of the Bride Body of
[1:03:39] Christ
[1:03:42] there is nothing we preach in this
[1:03:44] message that's not based on what Paul
[1:03:46] taught
[1:03:47] in fact is if you're teaching something
[1:03:49] Paul taught you're a false prophet
[1:03:52] see and brother Branham said that the
[1:03:55] reason that makes you a false prophet he
[1:03:56] said like the pope he's a false prophet
[1:03:58] he's a prophet because he's a preacher
[1:04:01] see he's a new testament Prophet New
[1:04:03] Testament preacher but he what he's
[1:04:05] preaching is contrary to scripture so
[1:04:07] that makes him a false prophet see you
[1:04:10] can be a you can be a real Prophet but
[1:04:14] that doesn't mean you're a true prophet
[1:04:17] you can a lot of false prophets Balaam
[1:04:20] was a real prophet
[1:04:23] but he was a false prophet amen so so we
[1:04:27] see that the that the anointing rain
[1:04:29] falls on the just and the unjust Delight
[1:04:31] so we find then that that brother pray
[1:04:34] you say well but he's the son of God
[1:04:36] because he's he's he's pleading
[1:04:38] fragrance of course he did as the as as
[1:04:40] they kept you know losing uh the
[1:04:43] understanding of the word it sealed up
[1:04:45] to the end time Christ sits back down in
[1:04:47] the eternities to intercede for his
[1:04:49] family but also but also also also the
[1:04:54] ministry of the Son of God brother
[1:04:56] Branham explained it this way that when
[1:04:59] he was in his Earthly pilgrimage as son
[1:05:01] of man word made flesh then he went into
[1:05:04] Son of God brother Branham says which
[1:05:06] was the supernatural
[1:05:09] because he wasn't flesh that's why the
[1:05:11] Bible says we we knew Christ after the
[1:05:14] flesh but we know him no longer after
[1:05:17] the flesh we know him by the spirit he's
[1:05:20] now Supernatural and that Supernatural
[1:05:23] Spirit was in every age and it's all the
[1:05:26] way down today and just because we come
[1:05:28] to the ministry and the office of the
[1:05:30] son of man it's not a reduction of the
[1:05:33] supernatural it's actually a perfection
[1:05:38] because once again the Supernatural is
[1:05:41] living in a family of God who are
[1:05:44] walking by the saith the Lord
[1:05:48] you get me
[1:05:51] it's an important transition you mustn't
[1:05:53] lose
[1:05:55] so
[1:05:57] so we find then that when we pick up now
[1:06:01] we're going to go to Matthew's gospel
[1:06:03] chapter 24 is where brother Branham
[1:06:07] would go for prophetic teaching many
[1:06:09] times immediately
[1:06:11] after the tribulation of those days
[1:06:13] shall the sun be darkened and the moon
[1:06:17] shall not give her light now it's coming
[1:06:18] to the end into the world and the Stars
[1:06:21] shall fall from Heaven and the powers of
[1:06:23] the heavens shall be shaken
[1:06:26] and then shall appear the sign of the
[1:06:30] son of man now that's an important
[1:06:32] prophecy catch it now there's an
[1:06:34] appearance all right then shall appear
[1:06:37] the sign of the son of man in heaven and
[1:06:41] now first let me say to you
[1:06:43] people sometimes mistakenly think this
[1:06:46] is the cloud over Arizona and that's not
[1:06:48] accurate because this is at the end of
[1:06:50] the tribulation there's another
[1:06:52] scripture that does refer to what
[1:06:54] happened in Arizona this ain't that all
[1:06:56] right all right and then shall appear
[1:06:59] you can see the description you can see
[1:07:01] the context immediately after the
[1:07:02] tribulation of those days it's at the
[1:07:04] end of the tribulation all right and it
[1:07:07] goes down verse 30 and then shall appear
[1:07:09] the sign of the son of man in heaven
[1:07:11] this is now Revelation 19 when he comes
[1:07:15] riding Out of Heaven on a white horse
[1:07:17] remember
[1:07:18] and his vesture dipped in blood his name
[1:07:20] is called the word of God
[1:07:22] amen and and the armies of Heaven
[1:07:26] following him which is the bride
[1:07:29] at the end of the tribulation all right
[1:07:31] this is why the scripture says that when
[1:07:34] they when they see him this is not Lo
[1:07:36] where we're going to read it here and
[1:07:38] then shall appear the sign of the son of
[1:07:39] man in heaven and then shall also
[1:07:43] then oh I'm sorry and then shall all the
[1:07:46] tribes of the earth mourn
[1:07:49] now it's hard to imagine you
[1:07:52] mourning to see Jesus
[1:07:56] I mean to us as a Believer is it not
[1:08:00] true that to see him in the skies when
[1:08:03] we meet him in the air
[1:08:05] is that not the quest of the of all
[1:08:08] Journey yeah the quest of all quests the
[1:08:10] Journey of all Journeys isn't that why
[1:08:12] we are a Believer isn't that why we're
[1:08:15] we're fighting it out isn't that why
[1:08:17] we've taken our stand isn't that why we
[1:08:20] believe what God has done to this day to
[1:08:22] see him in the air
[1:08:24] three of you
[1:08:26] just see him in the air
[1:08:28] about 12 of you just see him in the air
[1:08:32] to meet him at last the one I've lived
[1:08:36] for my whole life since a boy looked for
[1:08:39] that day that morning that breaks
[1:08:42] Eternal pride and fair oh my
[1:08:45] God
[1:08:47] then then shall appear the sign of the
[1:08:50] son of man in heaven and then shall all
[1:08:53] the tribes of the earth mourn and they
[1:08:55] shall see the son of man coming in the
[1:08:58] Clouds Of Heaven with power and great
[1:09:01] Glory so this is another description of
[1:09:04] Revelation 19 the armies of Heaven
[1:09:07] following him because it's the because
[1:09:10] it's the sign of the son of man and and
[1:09:13] the son of man is word made flesh see
[1:09:16] and it's coming in clouds and you're
[1:09:18] surrounded by a cloud of many witnesses
[1:09:23] Hallelujah
[1:09:24] see and and and in heaven with power and
[1:09:28] great Glory because at that point the
[1:09:31] queen is now speaking with the king in
[1:09:35] perfect Authority now it's Esther and
[1:09:37] the hazarus on the throne and Nehemiah
[1:09:39] at the time of feast of trumpets going
[1:09:42] back to restore Israel now Moses and
[1:09:44] Elijah Hallelujah friends have completed
[1:09:47] their course and a pride is in one voice
[1:09:50] with Christ and it's we've went through
[1:09:51] the whole tribulation and now we've come
[1:09:53] back out
[1:09:55] in in chapter 19 or Matthew 24 30. see
[1:10:00] now I can't just say that I got to prove
[1:10:04] it all right
[1:10:06] now because notice it doesn't say coming
[1:10:10] even though he he does come out of
[1:10:14] heaven and it's for real this is not a
[1:10:16] metaphor they actually see him
[1:10:18] right but now watch
[1:10:22] now John was so sure that he was going
[1:10:24] to see the Messiah till he said he's in
[1:10:26] our midst now now watch notice there's a
[1:10:29] great big difference in the sign of
[1:10:32] Jesus appearing and then Jesus coming
[1:10:35] those two different words means two
[1:10:37] different things the appearing over the
[1:10:39] Lord and the coming of the Lord all
[1:10:41] right the coming of the Lord is when we
[1:10:43] meet him in the air
[1:10:45] see but when when Revelation 19 occurs
[1:10:49] there's an appearing of that Lord with
[1:10:52] his bride in Perfection and the whole
[1:10:55] earth will see it and mourn
[1:10:57] so so so so so so so then accurately
[1:11:01] verse 30 is not the rapture
[1:11:06] the Rapture had taken place three and a
[1:11:08] half years prior and the world missed it
[1:11:11] this is why they mourn because now it
[1:11:14] becomes evident that that little man was
[1:11:17] right
[1:11:18] and the people that they held in
[1:11:20] derision and ridiculed are now appearing
[1:11:23] with him in clouds of glory and Power
[1:11:27] oh the Bible is so flawless
[1:11:32] see so he says
[1:11:34] the the at the bottom the appearing of
[1:11:36] the Lord and the coming of the Lord he
[1:11:38] go now now the appearing
[1:11:41] is that same yeah now the appearing of
[1:11:44] the Lord is now when he's appearing in
[1:11:47] his people
[1:11:48] see that's why the sign of the son of
[1:11:51] man appears because what is it it's the
[1:11:54] Lord and his people the glory in power
[1:11:57] in a cloud
[1:11:59] amen see so so we find then that his
[1:12:04] Spirit what is it his Spirit working
[1:12:06] among them proving that it's him with
[1:12:09] them getting them ready for the Rapture
[1:12:12] for the coming of the Lord to catch away
[1:12:14] his bride the appearing and the coming
[1:12:17] that is exactly how
[1:12:20] this is if they don't say it prayer
[1:12:23] although I think they will I think many
[1:12:24] who want to reject uh William Branham
[1:12:28] now but brother Branham said someday
[1:12:30] they'll say that little man was right
[1:12:31] and and I think maybe when California
[1:12:34] and then when all the plaques start
[1:12:36] coming but for sure
[1:12:38] at verse 30 of Matthew 24. for sure see
[1:12:43] because of this principle they're going
[1:12:45] to see the appearing and that's his
[1:12:47] coming all right and it but but what the
[1:12:50] significance of verse 30 is what what
[1:12:52] what that
[1:12:54] what that coming in Revelation 19 is as
[1:12:57] an appearing you follow me it's Christ
[1:13:00] working the spirit among them and you've
[1:13:03] got the word made flesh as it was in the
[1:13:06] days of lot as it was in the days of
[1:13:09] Noah so shall it be in the coming of the
[1:13:12] son of man the word made flesh again
[1:13:15] watch
[1:13:17] so he goes on uh
[1:13:19] oh wait
[1:13:21] okay now
[1:13:25] um did I get it yeah okay I'll make sure
[1:13:27] where I'm at
[1:13:29] all right now uh it's when he is
[1:13:32] presented people all right all right
[1:13:34] now the thing we have to do
[1:13:37] if if we can believe it and be concerned
[1:13:41] about it first we got to be convinced
[1:13:43] that it is God then when we're convinced
[1:13:46] then we are concerned I like that all
[1:13:49] right now I'm going to take something
[1:13:51] friends what
[1:13:54] what causes a preacher especially a
[1:13:58] pastor but all preachers but
[1:14:01] particularly pastors what what call
[1:14:04] what's the leading cause of the pastor
[1:14:07] losing sleep at night
[1:14:09] is people who actually see it
[1:14:12] and are convinced of it but aren't very
[1:14:15] concerned
[1:14:18] even though when you see it and
[1:14:20] acknowledge it that it's true then you
[1:14:22] already know we're at the end time
[1:14:24] because what you've now believed wasn't
[1:14:27] coming until the end time and you see
[1:14:29] the world going into chaos and you
[1:14:33] actually see the results you can read
[1:14:36] about the things happening in the
[1:14:38] tribulation and brother Branham in his
[1:14:40] vials series that's not titled that but
[1:14:43] as we've been teaching you from it where
[1:14:45] that was the theme of his heart because
[1:14:47] those are the things that that we need
[1:14:49] to know because of this Airborne
[1:14:51] infection that that when brother Brandon
[1:14:54] began to bring the word of God that that
[1:14:57] is a sign to you and I that we have
[1:15:01] arrived in the last days and that's
[1:15:04] where brother Brandon would say now
[1:15:06] listen to watch watch brother Brandon
[1:15:09] would say now he you can go in the Book
[1:15:11] of Revelation and read about some of the
[1:15:13] things that happened on the seventh vial
[1:15:15] let me give you some of brother
[1:15:17] branham's and I read them for you where
[1:15:19] brother Branham said man will go so
[1:15:21] insane that they will see ants crawling
[1:15:25] on the earth the size of multi-story I
[1:15:27] forget how many said 3 every story or so
[1:15:30] uh hi in their imaginary mind
[1:15:34] and their imaginary mind there's no ants
[1:15:37] the tribulation isn't going to produce
[1:15:38] ants multi-story buildings
[1:15:41] birds with wingspans five miles across
[1:15:45] like like Raptors like prehistoric
[1:15:48] creatures they're not actually going to
[1:15:49] be there but man in his imaginary mind
[1:15:53] is going to go that crazy
[1:15:56] and he'll run and scream that's
[1:15:58] tribulation things that are going to be
[1:16:00] happening Andy do you know do you know
[1:16:02] why they do you know why they arrive
[1:16:06] there because they're not convinced or
[1:16:09] concerned
[1:16:12] and they just keep feeding on the things
[1:16:14] of the world but you God has called you
[1:16:17] aside to say come out of her my people
[1:16:21] don't be like that don't get caught
[1:16:24] there in that insanity and the word has
[1:16:26] come today and I and and so what I want
[1:16:29] to try to drive into your hearts is if
[1:16:31] you're convinced then be concerned
[1:16:34] be concerned with your prayer life be
[1:16:37] concerned with your attended church
[1:16:39] attendance be concerned with the example
[1:16:42] that you set in front of your children
[1:16:44] be concerned
[1:16:47] as a teenager be concerned
[1:16:51] that your light you see
[1:16:53] when when Paul goes to a woman
[1:16:57] you know cutting her hair and
[1:17:00] and it's so I find it almost amusing if
[1:17:03] it weren't so sad
[1:17:05] and right away when people leave the
[1:17:07] message first thing the women do is cut
[1:17:08] their hair and put on pants and wear
[1:17:09] makeup
[1:17:11] and it's across the board it happens
[1:17:12] every single time
[1:17:14] and they say I say and well because I
[1:17:17] don't have to listen to William Branham
[1:17:18] anymore Time Out Hold Up Wait stop
[1:17:22] women cutting their hair it's not a
[1:17:24] William Branham Doctrine
[1:17:26] you won't have to worry about William
[1:17:28] Brennan that's a Saint Paul
[1:17:31] a woman putting on a garment that
[1:17:33] pertains to a man is not a William
[1:17:34] Branham teaching that's a Moses teacher
[1:17:37] see
[1:17:38] and and as far as Jezebel all you got to
[1:17:41] do is go back and look at Elijah
[1:17:43] and so it won't do you any good even if
[1:17:46] you believe William Brandon was false
[1:17:48] and even if you end up right
[1:17:50] you're still gonna have to deal with
[1:17:51] Paul and Moses and Elijah
[1:17:55] see that shows you how far the devil can
[1:17:59] break their mind
[1:18:02] and break their mind to think like that
[1:18:04] see and have no concern and Paul when he
[1:18:07] talks about a woman cutting her hair you
[1:18:09] have to realize the emphasis that Paul
[1:18:11] is trying to make when it comes to you
[1:18:13] know adorning herself uh which means
[1:18:16] beautifying there's nothing wrong with a
[1:18:18] woman beautifying herself brother REM
[1:18:19] said it's in her nature there's nothing
[1:18:21] wrong with that but it but it's to be
[1:18:23] done modestly
[1:18:24] in the spirit of Christ see and and
[1:18:27] brother Branham said you don't want to
[1:18:29] go walking like you went through a five
[1:18:30] and dime with a magnet on
[1:18:33] and and the length of your skirts
[1:18:35] matters the the your your upper Clothing
[1:18:38] Matters say why is it always on the
[1:18:40] women well okay you mean besides the
[1:18:42] fact that a woman's body's sacred you
[1:18:44] mean other than that
[1:18:46] because she brings life into the Earth
[1:18:48] and her body's sacred
[1:18:49] and and so and so so brother so Paul
[1:18:53] brother Paul
[1:18:54] his whole point is to say that what is
[1:18:58] what would be a travesty what would be
[1:19:00] so sad what would be so wrong
[1:19:04] this picture would be so wrong if you
[1:19:08] were in public
[1:19:09] and someone who didn't know you and saw
[1:19:13] how you were dressed
[1:19:16] and mistook you for an unbeliever
[1:19:20] and thought by the way you're dressed
[1:19:22] you're not even a Christian
[1:19:24] Paul is saying that would be horrible
[1:19:28] that would be such a slap to the face of
[1:19:32] the Lord Jesus that somebody would
[1:19:35] accidentally because of the attitude you
[1:19:37] had the words you were saying the things
[1:19:39] you were doing where you were going what
[1:19:40] you were doing what you were wearing how
[1:19:42] you were dressing how you were
[1:19:43] conducting yourself that anyone could
[1:19:45] see you and mistake you for a person of
[1:19:48] the world you are to be a bright and
[1:19:52] Shining Light see
[1:19:55] see so it's not it's not Paul trying to
[1:19:59] be hard on women they call him a woman
[1:20:00] hater and that is unjustified and it's
[1:20:03] unfair he was not he Paul loved the
[1:20:08] females of the of God's family and that
[1:20:11] his sisters in Christ he wanted them to
[1:20:14] be holy
[1:20:15] because they were uh they were a
[1:20:18] portrait of the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:20:20] Christ see and then he wanted men to
[1:20:23] take the position of of Christ himself
[1:20:26] as the high priest of the home
[1:20:29] you know I was just I was speaking to a
[1:20:31] young man here recently and I was giving
[1:20:34] him a testimony about another
[1:20:35] conversation I had with another young
[1:20:37] man recently and this other young man
[1:20:39] was married with Children and you know I
[1:20:41] felt the need uh this is some time ago
[1:20:44] quite a ways back it's nothing like that
[1:20:46] today and I felt the need to take him
[1:20:48] aside and say listen my dear brother
[1:20:49] because I could you could see love of
[1:20:51] the Lord and he was a firm believer and
[1:20:53] I said you've gotta you hear you've got
[1:20:54] a you've got a house full of youngins
[1:20:56] and I it's pretty easy to see that you
[1:20:59] know how to sow seed and produce human
[1:21:01] beings I I can see that you got a house
[1:21:03] full of children but do you know how to
[1:21:06] sow a spiritual seed do you know how to
[1:21:08] reproduce Christ in your family see it's
[1:21:12] one thing to be able to do it naturally
[1:21:13] that's just nature but what what what
[1:21:16] what the what the married sisters need
[1:21:19] my brothers what the what the single
[1:21:21] sisters who will be married eventually
[1:21:23] my brothers what they need is men who
[1:21:26] are living men in the image of their
[1:21:28] maker
[1:21:30] who are who are who are taking their
[1:21:33] position as a high priest in the home
[1:21:36] you remember as I've said before say it
[1:21:40] to young men all over the world manhood
[1:21:42] is not a gender you don't get to be a
[1:21:44] man just because you're a male brother
[1:21:46] Brandon said I've seen men 50 six foot
[1:21:48] 200 pounds and have ounce of man in them
[1:21:51] I've seen men 70.
[1:21:53] six foot 200 pounds didn't have ounce of
[1:21:55] man in them because manhood manhood is
[1:21:57] not a gender you don't get to
[1:21:59] automatically be a man just because
[1:22:00] you're a male of advanced years manhood
[1:22:03] is an office that speaks of character it
[1:22:06] speaks of loyalty it speaks of honesty
[1:22:09] it speaks of Integrity it speaks of
[1:22:12] perseverance it speaks of strength it
[1:22:14] speaks of determination Hallelujah it
[1:22:17] means you have the ability to make a
[1:22:19] decision for God and live that way and
[1:22:21] go forward and display it in your life
[1:22:26] there was the committal of Abraham that
[1:22:29] God so admired his his level of
[1:22:31] commitment
[1:22:32] didn't matter what happened he was not
[1:22:33] gonna he was gonna believe God's word
[1:22:36] going forward see
[1:22:38] all right I'm only going to get 15
[1:22:40] minutes to preach I've already get to it
[1:22:43] so brother Branham says
[1:22:46] you know it's about believing it and
[1:22:49] then being concerned about it if you're
[1:22:52] going to believe it be concerned enough
[1:22:54] to let it make the changes that you need
[1:22:57] in your life or your life is Unworthy of
[1:23:00] the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:23:03] since this gospel is dripping with the
[1:23:05] blood of the martyrs and the blood of
[1:23:07] Christ I don't think this Pulpit should
[1:23:10] ever let the gospel become a cheap
[1:23:12] gospel
[1:23:13] some easy believism
[1:23:16] come on preachers come on Amen come on
[1:23:18] amen amen don't ever let it be easy
[1:23:21] believe is if you get behind this Pulpit
[1:23:23] preach
[1:23:24] preach Hallelujah repent or perish
[1:23:28] Hallelujah we have no room for
[1:23:30] compromise
[1:23:31] he goes on in a couple months about a
[1:23:33] month or two later in perseverance did
[1:23:36] you know that the Bible speaks of the
[1:23:37] appearing of the Lord and also the
[1:23:39] coming of the lord it's two different
[1:23:40] Works search it and find it out if
[1:23:41] that's right they're peering and the
[1:23:43] coming is two different things all right
[1:23:46] you with me all right
[1:23:49] the appearing of the Lord is now he's
[1:23:52] appearing amongst his people there it is
[1:23:54] again see that's the appearing that's
[1:23:56] why in Matthew 24 30 it's an appearing
[1:24:00] of the sign of the son of man all right
[1:24:02] the Lord and his people all right
[1:24:05] appearing among his people we see him in
[1:24:07] his same works the appearing his holy
[1:24:10] spirit but his coming will be in a
[1:24:12] physical being it'll be to catch the
[1:24:15] church up you want to be a part of that
[1:24:17] you want to be in that number
[1:24:20] now when that angel of the Lord come to
[1:24:23] Abraham there in the time before the
[1:24:25] destruction now that was God appearing
[1:24:27] in human flesh and Jesus said as it was
[1:24:31] in the days of Noah so will it be in the
[1:24:33] coming of the son of man as it was in
[1:24:35] the days of lot he give the morals of
[1:24:39] what they were doing in the days of Noah
[1:24:42] now it's significant in the Bible that
[1:24:46] he didn't say as it was in the days of
[1:24:49] Enoch and Abraham
[1:24:52] see it was in the days of Noah and lot
[1:24:56] because Noah and lot are types of going
[1:25:00] through the tribulation Noah
[1:25:01] particularly the Jews the 144 000
[1:25:04] brother Branham said one place he talks
[1:25:06] about it and and it's a little bit
[1:25:08] ambiguous that it's also a type of the
[1:25:10] foolish virgin but his main point was
[1:25:12] Noah going through the tribulation uh
[1:25:15] was was the 144 thousand who goes
[1:25:18] through the tribulation to be purged
[1:25:19] amen and so and then and then you have
[1:25:22] lot the and brother Branham talks about
[1:25:24] Abraham up on the hill he had the sign
[1:25:26] of Melchizedek see and he not built a
[1:25:29] pyramid and walked home to heaven
[1:25:32] could you imagine letting this be built
[1:25:34] up you will one of these days it's going
[1:25:36] to be so built up in you you're going to
[1:25:39] get so close to Heaven that you're just
[1:25:40] going to step into another dimension
[1:25:43] Glory glory to God I look forward to
[1:25:45] that hour
[1:25:47] Hallelujah
[1:25:49] see
[1:25:50] as it was in the days of Noah all right
[1:25:53] in the days of lot watch the messenger
[1:25:56] to Abraham watch The Messengers to lot
[1:25:58] and the nominal church just come out
[1:26:00] come out and Abraham pleading for them
[1:26:01] notice the Angel God Elohim appearing in
[1:26:04] the form of human flesh
[1:26:06] shows that Elohim in the last days will
[1:26:09] appear watch
[1:26:11] not the coming of Christ but the
[1:26:15] appearing of Christ in human flesh in
[1:26:18] his church making his same signs so this
[1:26:21] appearing leads to that coming
[1:26:24] amen amen
[1:26:27] so not the coming of Christ but the
[1:26:29] appearing of Christ in human flesh in
[1:26:30] his church making his same signs and
[1:26:34] things he and things he did and hasn't
[1:26:38] done it in the church for 2 000 years
[1:26:41] see the appearing of Our Lord all right
[1:26:45] now now we can go forward now come back
[1:26:50] verse 31.
[1:26:52] you good
[1:26:55] and he shall send his angels with a
[1:26:59] great sound of a trumpet see this is how
[1:27:01] he does it and they shall gather
[1:27:03] together his elect from the Four Winds
[1:27:05] from one end of Heaven to the other
[1:27:07] that's now you're back to Matthew 13.
[1:27:09] see they they correlate Matthew 13
[1:27:12] Matthew 24 Revelation goes all the way
[1:27:15] from chapters one now we're all the way
[1:27:16] over to chapter 16 in the vials and you
[1:27:18] finally end up with a spirit and a bride
[1:27:20] say come this is all working together in
[1:27:23] Matthew 13 what did he do he would he
[1:27:27] would send his angels to do what
[1:27:29] separate the good from the bad that's
[1:27:31] his preachers that's his ministers they
[1:27:33] they sound a trumpet now we're not
[1:27:35] talking about the great trumpet see
[1:27:37] we're not talking about the trumpet to
[1:27:38] Israel we're talking I'm not talking
[1:27:40] about the great trumpet that brings the
[1:27:42] sleeping dead we're talking about the
[1:27:44] gospel trumpet that he will send forth
[1:27:47] his Messengers how do you know it's a
[1:27:49] true Messenger he'll have the true
[1:27:51] gospel trumpet for his hour
[1:27:54] he might not be pretty he might not be
[1:27:56] smart he might not be popular but he'll
[1:27:58] have the saith the Lord
[1:28:01] and it becomes it's incumbent upon you
[1:28:04] to follow that if you want to live
[1:28:08] and he shall send
[1:28:10] his angels and and it shall go on for me
[1:28:13] even after the bride is gone it'll be
[1:28:14] Moses and Elijah remember when the bride
[1:28:17] leaves Grace is Gone
[1:28:19] remember because Grace is the camp of
[1:28:21] the redeemed it's the encampment of the
[1:28:23] redeemed it's part of Elections part of
[1:28:25] your origin amen amen amen
[1:28:27] see and and and and and that ego
[1:28:30] anointing doesn't go back to Heaven that
[1:28:32] fourth flight that fourth creature it
[1:28:35] goes all the way as soon as the Gentile
[1:28:37] bride goes up Grace is over for the for
[1:28:39] the Gentiles because the bride takes the
[1:28:41] the grace and the blood of Christ with
[1:28:43] her
[1:28:43] because say we take the blood Shore you
[1:28:46] you are the blood of God by the spirit
[1:28:49] it's not the chemistry the chemistry ran
[1:28:53] down across and fell on the earth and
[1:28:55] claimed the Earth for a millennium but
[1:28:57] it's the Life In The Blood that's a
[1:28:59] token that comes into your life
[1:29:01] and when the bride leaves physically
[1:29:03] because she's now the word the blood and
[1:29:05] the spirit of God is in her she's the
[1:29:07] word made flesh she is Grace she's Mrs
[1:29:10] Jesus Christ
[1:29:13] she's under the eagle anointing just
[1:29:15] because a prophet went home just because
[1:29:16] the office of son of man went home that
[1:29:18] doesn't stop the ministry of the son of
[1:29:20] man or the Flying Eagle upon the bride
[1:29:24] that's why she has thus says in order
[1:29:26] she keeps still in other words her whole
[1:29:28] life is lived by thus Sith Lord and
[1:29:30] nothing else
[1:29:31] she she the womb is sealed she won't
[1:29:34] hear another man-made idea she won't be
[1:29:36] wooed by the siren song of Lucifer and
[1:29:40] Satan's Eden she closes her ears and
[1:29:43] eyes to that
[1:29:45] she wants only the word of God
[1:29:48] see
[1:29:50] and so so we find then that this is so
[1:29:53] beautiful so so he sends them and as
[1:29:56] soon as the bride leaves then the eagle
[1:29:58] anointing lifts up flies East picks up
[1:30:01] Moses and Elijah and goes to the 144
[1:30:04] 000. there in Israel not all Israel's
[1:30:06] Israel but God knoweth him that are his
[1:30:09] see
[1:30:10] so so it's it's the trumpets going and
[1:30:13] then of course it's the the proper
[1:30:15] Jewish trumpets Moses and Elijah
[1:30:16] operating and they're going to be the
[1:30:19] ones who give a verse by verse breakdown
[1:30:22] to Israel brother Brandon wanted to he
[1:30:24] he wasn't allowed because it wasn't
[1:30:26] necessary he gave verse by verse in the
[1:30:28] ages verse by verse and the seals when
[1:30:30] it came to the trumpets and the vowels
[1:30:31] wasn't necessary he took eight or nine
[1:30:33] services to show you the impact that the
[1:30:36] seventh vial is having on the day and
[1:30:37] hour that we live in
[1:30:40] he took these sermons to show you and
[1:30:42] taught on Revelation to show you that
[1:30:44] they were partially fulfilled in every
[1:30:46] age but they're coming because seven is
[1:30:48] the completion sevens all your sevens
[1:30:50] are the completion so in after the
[1:30:53] seventh age and it goes into the
[1:30:54] tribulation under the seventh trumpet
[1:30:56] then that's then that's the full cup of
[1:30:58] God's indignation and wrath poured out
[1:31:00] no wonder it says there's never been a
[1:31:02] day like it never will be again
[1:31:04] so I I feel like I'm going so fast I
[1:31:08] hope you're staying caught up all right
[1:31:10] I'll start my preaching in a few minutes
[1:31:13] and then and and he shall send his
[1:31:16] angels
[1:31:18] with the with a great sound of a trumpet
[1:31:20] and they shall gather together his elect
[1:31:22] from the Four Winds from one end of
[1:31:25] Heaven to the other
[1:31:26] now all right now he's going to back up
[1:31:29] and say okay now I'm going to give you a
[1:31:31] sign
[1:31:33] I'm about to show you a sign
[1:31:36] that that is so clear
[1:31:40] it won't seem clear to you now Church
[1:31:42] you're the early church you don't even
[1:31:44] know I'm not even going to tell you that
[1:31:46] it's going to be 2 000 years I'm going
[1:31:48] to let you think it's imminent in every
[1:31:50] age
[1:31:51] I don't want to discourage you brother
[1:31:52] Brian said I want to discouraged them so
[1:31:54] here he is he's not even going to let
[1:31:56] him know
[1:31:57] that it's going to be Seven Ages 2020
[1:32:00] centuries
[1:32:01] but he's coming now to the last one and
[1:32:04] there ain't another one
[1:32:05] and he's saying now I'm going to let you
[1:32:07] know how this is going to unfold I'm
[1:32:09] going to give you a sign when the
[1:32:11] lightning has traveled under the heaven
[1:32:14] prior to the Rapture has traveled under
[1:32:17] the heaven in human history
[1:32:19] all the way from east to west when that
[1:32:23] happens then you're going to see the the
[1:32:26] light it's going to look like Noah's day
[1:32:27] it's going to look like lot's day and
[1:32:29] that's the time when I'm going to reveal
[1:32:31] the office again of son of man and
[1:32:34] that's going to produce the ministry of
[1:32:36] the son of man and a people who are then
[1:32:39] the glory and power of God when he
[1:32:40] appears at the end time
[1:32:43] I mean this stuff is mind-blowing when
[1:32:45] you see it all put together you realize
[1:32:47] this was put together by a very
[1:32:48] brilliant mind
[1:32:50] I'm entertain something he accounted for
[1:32:52] everything there's nothing take courage
[1:32:55] in this there's nothing that you can
[1:32:58] encounter from the Cradle to the Grave
[1:33:01] that's not covered he's thought of
[1:33:03] everything
[1:33:05] he's thought of everything he has a
[1:33:07] contingency as a plan he has a remedy
[1:33:09] all you got to do is walk in his will
[1:33:11] and you'll walk in his remedy
[1:33:14] Hallelujah you got cancer doesn't matter
[1:33:16] by his stripes are healed you got
[1:33:19] depression doesn't matter by his stripes

[1:33:34] you'll plant it in your heart and
[1:33:36] confess it and thank God for it and
[1:33:38] don't never change it that seed will
[1:33:40] grow
[1:33:42] it will become a crop and you'll have a
[1:33:44] harvest of it lungs don't go back and
[1:33:47] take it up out of impatience
[1:33:49] and as soon as you doubt a promise you
[1:33:51] just dug it up you got to start over
[1:33:52] it's the imperishable seat just put it
[1:33:55] in the ground every farmer knows he's
[1:33:57] got to wait take care of it be convinced

[1:34:30] see upon the word of God that's why it
[1:34:33] comes
[1:34:34] all right I might not get to preaching
[1:34:37] today
[1:34:39] all right now all right now so now at
[1:34:41] the end time now learn a parable of the
[1:34:43] fig tree
[1:34:45] when his branch
[1:34:47] is yet tender
[1:34:49] and put it forth leaves you know that
[1:34:53] summer
[1:34:54] is nigh all right
[1:34:57] you know all right you know that summer
[1:34:59] is nigh so likewise
[1:35:03] when ye shall see all these things
[1:35:07] now now brother Brown said all of these
[1:35:10] things means just that it means the
[1:35:12] ministry of the son of man it means the
[1:35:14] days that the society is going to become
[1:35:16] like it did in the days of Noah
[1:35:18] men's mind he will continue all over the
[1:35:19] world it's going to become like it did
[1:35:21] in lot's time with perversion and sexual
[1:35:25] perversions and perversions of every
[1:35:27] imaginable kind
[1:35:29] to where they even they even want to
[1:35:31] have illicit affairs with the angels

[1:35:36] Devil you're talking about the nastiness
[1:35:38] of the devil don't mess around with him

[1:35:44] things to God's angels

[1:35:49] corrupt your whole mind and pollute you
[1:35:52] and put scars in your life you'll you
[1:35:54] might never get away from this whole
[1:35:55] lifetime God give you Grace to keep

[1:36:02] road and the baptism the Holy Ghost it

[1:36:10] wouldn't have went that way in that way
[1:36:12] and did this and that did that and all
[1:36:14] these scars and wounds I got but I
[1:36:15] didn't want to show you now but I wish I
[1:36:17] didn't have them I wish I'd have stayed
[1:36:19] true as a young man I wish I'd have just
[1:36:21] kept serving him and kept serving him
[1:36:24] Hallelujah
[1:36:26] thank God for keeping me from the things
[1:36:28] he did
[1:36:29] see
[1:36:30] so likewise he when you shall see all
[1:36:33] these things so it's all of these things
[1:36:36] and it's and and it's uh it's Israel
[1:36:40] putting forth its Leaf now we could go
[1:36:43] there and read that in the scripture uh
[1:36:45] but but it's in verse 32 here where
[1:36:48] we're reading right here now learn a
[1:36:50] parable of the fig tree that's Israel
[1:36:52] when its branch is yet tender and puteth
[1:36:54] forth leaves all right so that Nation
[1:36:58] the people the generation that sees that
[1:37:03] that generation is the one that won't
[1:37:05] pass away till everything in Matthew 24
[1:37:08] is fulfilled
[1:37:10] and we've already read to the end of the
[1:37:13] tribulation
[1:37:15] now you got to do the math backwards
[1:37:18] the generation that sees Israel and sees
[1:37:21] the days of Noah and the days of lot
[1:37:23] that generation that sees that
[1:37:27] start counting because that's God's
[1:37:29] timepieces Israel
[1:37:31] see
[1:37:32] verily I say unto you this generation
[1:37:36] the one that sees it all will not pass
[1:37:39] till all things be fulfilled
[1:37:43] all the way to the sign of the son of
[1:37:45] man appearing in the earth Mourns all
[1:37:47] the way to Revelation 19. amen
[1:37:51] I'm here to tell you
[1:37:53] there was a generation that I already
[1:37:55] saw that come to pass
[1:37:58] say yet was us not exactly
[1:38:03] it was them
[1:38:07] I saw
[1:38:09] this little girl
[1:38:11] interviewed she's now in her 80s
[1:38:16] I saw her interviewed and she tells she
[1:38:18] she's that little girl right there with
[1:38:20] the square you can see I've got it right
[1:38:22] there
[1:38:23] and she tells of the Horrors friends
[1:38:26] she's now in her 80s and uh and all of
[1:38:30] those children are passing away I think
[1:38:32] we lose so many of them every single day
[1:38:35] and that's the generation that saw
[1:38:38] Israel put forth its leaf and that's the
[1:38:41] generation that won't completely can't
[1:38:43] completely pass from the earth until all
[1:38:46] the way to the end of the tribulation is
[1:38:48] observed
[1:38:51] I want to ask you a question today
[1:38:53] now are you concerned
[1:38:56] I hope you're convinced you know it's
[1:38:59] one thing to be convinced but then
[1:39:01] you're going to want to be concerned
[1:39:05] amen and that is that is a burden in my
[1:39:08] heart musicians return come back I
[1:39:10] realize I'm at a junction if I go
[1:39:12] further I'll need another 45 minutes
[1:39:16] that is the generation
[1:39:19] that is going to see these children who
[1:39:23] are elderly adults now saw the Horrors
[1:39:26] they literally you're looking in the
[1:39:29] faces of humans who saw the putting
[1:39:34] forth of the leaf they this is the
[1:39:37] generation that goes back to Palestine
[1:39:39] after their Liberation and that's where
[1:39:42] they raised the six-point star of David
[1:39:44] and have their own flag and their own
[1:39:46] money and brother Branham goes back and
[1:39:48] takes up the U.N security Council and
[1:39:50] all the vote now he got their own flag
[1:39:51] in their own Army and their own money
