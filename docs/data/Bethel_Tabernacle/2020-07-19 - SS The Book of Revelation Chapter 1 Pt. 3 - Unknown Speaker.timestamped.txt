[0:00] word creation but he's more than Adam
[0:02] because now and the second item is a
[0:04] further because now he's he's the
[0:07] begotten the only begotten in other
[0:08] words a spoken word man born of a woman
[0:11] and the the only next and most obvious
[0:15] step that he would take as you can
[0:17] imagine and it's what he did is to then
[0:19] take the next obvious step and come down
[0:22] and live inside of people who are also
[0:24] born of a woman but born by sin and
[0:27] convert that child by a new birth and
[0:30] bring them back to the image of the word
[0:32] that they were originally intended to
[0:34] come by
[0:36] hallelujah and the last element of that
[0:39] as Paul would say is the change of our
[0:41] mortal bodies and then we will have a
[0:43] body likened unto his glorious or
[0:47] glorified body amen all right line one
[0:52] of my notes for today so it's it's I I
[0:57] will I will of necessity not move beyond
[1:01] revelation 1:1 for a while because it is
[1:05] the key to unlocking it will give you
[1:09] context to understand as you read the
[1:12] symbolism you'll need to understand
[1:15] everything I'm saying now in order for
[1:17] it to make sense or you'll end up as as
[1:21] brother Jose pastors fond of saying
[1:23] you'll end up with your cow your
[1:25] painting will be a cow standing in the
[1:28] top of the tree drinking coca-cola and
[1:32] so I laugh at uncle to him every time he
[1:35] says that so it's his it's his Louisiana
[1:38] spin on that a man but it certainly is
[1:41] accurate so so the life now so there now
[1:45] you can imagine alright wait I'm going
[1:48] to take my last some minutes here I'm
[1:50] not that clock there's a little slow so
[1:52] it's gonna need bumped up about two
[1:54] minutes brother Luther said it just at
[1:56] about 11 minutes till sorry my OCD won't
[1:59] let me see that be a minute and a half
[2:02] off like that amen sorry sorry buddy
[2:06] thank you I feel much better now so so
[2:11] we find that
[2:12] that that the life of Christ as it's
[2:15] unfolding to us it one of the first
[2:19] things that one of the first benefits
[2:22] that you can enjoy that the last age
[2:26] true church is going to need is that the
[2:31] life of Christ was was not to cause us
[2:34] to go on saying you know look at brother
[2:38] Branham look at brother Branham one of
[2:41] the one of the liberating things is is
[2:44] that we realized that that's not the
[2:47] concept that the message he brought was
[2:50] the final message and there's no other
[2:52] message coming it is our absolute on the
[2:55] scriptures because everything's got to
[2:57] tie back to the scriptures with
[2:59] understanding because the problem that
[3:02] the last day faced was that the
[3:05] traditions of man had taken us
[3:07] completely away from Christ not the
[3:11] historical figure but who he was and
[3:15] they turned him into a second of a
[3:18] three-person Godhead they butchered up
[3:21] the baptism found that the church was
[3:23] baptizing contrary to the original
[3:26] Church and so this revelation had to
[3:29] come to bring us back and place us back
[3:33] in the scripture so that we begin to
[3:36] understand what we're supposed to be or
[3:39] as Malachi 4 says it would take us back
[3:43] to the faith of the fathers or take us
[3:46] back to the gospel that Paul preached
[3:49] now if that's not true if that's not
[3:55] true then why do we have thousands of
[3:59] Christian denominations today and an
[4:02] additional tens of thousands of variable
[4:05] subsets of those denominations how would
[4:09] God manage to take a bride from that
[4:13] kind of a quagmire of man-made religion
[4:17] and do it fairly how would he take out
[4:21] of that kind of a
[4:22] meir 10,000 or more recorded
[4:26] denominations that the government
[4:28] recognizes and probably another 10 to
[4:30] 20,000 subsets beyond that how would God
[4:35] take a bride from that quagmire of
[4:38] man-made religion and do it fairly the
[4:41] obvious answer is then found in his own
[4:45] promise that when this gospel is
[4:48] preached in all the earth then the end
[4:50] would come when this gospel brother
[4:52] Jesus was saying this current gospel we
[4:55] we find that it would take that current
[4:58] gospel not 10000 denominational opinions
[5:01] on it and another 20,000 sub
[5:05] denominational opinions and all of these
[5:07] various movements and God would judge
[5:10] Jesus prophesied that as the Lightning
[5:13] comes out of the east and shines to the
[5:15] west so shall it be at the coming of the
[5:17] Son of Man so he his he answers the
[5:20] question for us today how would God take
[5:24] a bride out of this quagmire he would
[5:26] restore the original truth and that was
[5:29] his promise it's the obvious answer it's
[5:31] the only answer that he could that hid
[5:34] that would that there is where God could
[5:36] do it fairly he could raise a standard
[5:38] of the Word of God in this last day and
[5:41] a standard in battle when a standard is
[5:44] raised it's raised so the people can
[5:46] gather so that they in a battle in in
[5:49] the fog of war a standard is so that all
[5:51] the troops know where they're supposed
[5:53] to be and everybody can get in their
[5:55] position and if you're trying to fight
[5:57] in his army and you've got a
[5:59] misunderstanding of baptism or
[6:00] misunderstanding of who Christ was and
[6:03] his relationship to the Father which if
[6:05] you don't understand who he was as a
[6:07] human and his relationship to the Father
[6:10] then you can never understand as a human
[6:12] your relationship to the Father so then
[6:16] there is so so the first necessary
[6:20] element is that he restore back that
[6:23] first original gospel with its original
[6:27] teaching and accuracy and then you know
[6:32] then there is the choosing of that
[6:34] perfect time
[6:35] in an age when there are sufficient
[6:38] resources to propagate it around the
[6:41] world the nation you live in is not an
[6:44] accident it was not blessed to have the
[6:49] the the the highest rate of ability to
[6:53] propagate when when that gospel was
[6:56] restored God would need this western
[6:59] country to propagate it around the world
[7:02] so it's not about that
[7:04] that we were better people than anyone
[7:06] else it was that we fit into the vision
[7:09] of God's plan god bless you that's all
[7:12] the time we have for today god bless you
[7:14] service will begin after a five to ten
[7:16] minute intermission god bless you
