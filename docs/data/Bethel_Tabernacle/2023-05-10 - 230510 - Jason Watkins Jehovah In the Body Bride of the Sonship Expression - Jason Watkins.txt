here with you this evening we greet you all sufficient name of the Lord and I just want to say uh before I dive into uh sermon tonight um how much we enjoyed um the weekend we were able to stream and catch the Sunday school class and we've been in a good portion at least the first probably the first quarter of brother Don's sermon and then we had family Affairs to deal with and so today I have just been rejoicing around the word that Brother Don brought Sunday I thought it was fantastic amen and I it it probably strikes me that way particularly not only because of its content but because it's so conducive to the burden on my own heart amen for the word so have you come hungry tonight amen praise the Lord I want to thank you very deeply from the bottom of my heart on behalf of the entire tester family my wife's family gratitude and thanks for all the prayers the support the wonderful comments and uh my it's good to know in times like that that you have real family and friends amen that you know are upholding you and love and in prayer and so everything went well we were up there for an extended time and I was just testifying to some of the brothers today how that the Lord just was so very kind and we and sister Debbie actually had about almost a half dozen I think five or so very specific special request that she was asking the Lord as a special favor and wouldn't you know it one two three four and it was just just a beautiful thing to watch the Lord doing it and so amen and just prayer for that whole family in prayer for my wife and I we came back um extremely exhausted even sister Debbie wasn't able to make it here tonight just um very very exhausting because um not only the 10 days away but just the whole pressure of the organizing everything it all fell me and but the Lord came on the scene we had a wonderful wonderful memorial service for sister Linda and it was everything special that I'd hoped it would be she was certainly a very special person in my life amen and so it was a great privilege and great thrill for me amen I've known her since I was 15 and she's been uh she's been a gallant Warrior of the Cross you say you're talking like in the present tense like she's still alive yeah of course absolutely amen she has and remains a gallant Warrior of the Cross amen God bless you this evening we're going to turn to Romans chapter 12 and you'll recognize that amen if you were paying attention Sunday brother Don picked that up right there and we had a little bit of a Jubilee today amen he and I and brother Jason got a chance to meet and I was just testifying to him you know how much that meant to me because it's so close to my own thought tonight amen praise the Lord in Romans 12. we'll we'll catch verses one and two again Paul speaking here I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service the Bible knowledge commentary calls the people who've actually follow Paul's instructions here believer priests that's a fantastic statement how many want to be a believer priest tonight to present your bodies a Living Sacrifice not something dead not something historic but alive something present tense your everyday life all right well I don't want to get sidetracked let me read verse two and let you be seated and be not conformed to this world but be it transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God if there's ever a quest that I feel like I am on and that is to to to manifest the perfect will of God Amen and I I don't need to know what it is I just know I just know that it's the word and when I say I don't know what it is I'm simply meaning that I don't know what tomorrow holds for me but I know that whatever it holds as long as I'm manifesting this all as well amen amen let's pray father we thank you this evening for your great love your great Mercy to us now I pray that your great anointing be upon the word blessing both speaker and hearer Lord and tired in body and mind but so thrilled in my heart at the same time and I've desired Lord to stand here tonight and deliver this thought I thank you for the weekend and all your great blessing and all your lord your presence that we have felt and bringing us back safely joining us back to our family here Lord our Bethel family how much we love them and miss them and now here we are together again and I pray your great blessing now upon it all it's all for your glory in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated I want to ask for your undivided attention very quickly and um foreign I don't know what to do about that um so I can switch mics if that's needed uh someone just let me know um okay we'll try that amen hope that's better if not we can switch it out um I thought about doing some presentation tonight on the screen but it's a Wednesday night and I didn't want to do that we don't want to keep you too late and uh but I I want to move into this thought that's on my heart tonight and um I have a lengthy title it's rather cryptic and hard to grasp perhaps but I'll explain it quickly um you know and for certain uh so that you get a good understanding of it it's quite intentional and I'm taking the thought tonight Jehovah in the body bride of the sonship expression say that again Jehovah in the body Bride of the sonship expression now let me just help you understand where I'm going with that we were speaking about it today in fact is over our breakfast and we're referring back to Abraham and his promise now you've heard me talk about it before that you know the Bible tells us that there's none good no not one that there's not anyone who's been without sin and though we can we can look at the scriptural description of Abraham in the New Testament and it says Abraham staggered not in his faith and he staggered not at the promise of God and I've showed you how that the Old Testament reveals weaknesses in Abraham reveals how that he backslid and left the promised land and lied and did it twice uh and he you know wants to uh to Pharaoh where it nearly cost him his life and nearly cost him Sarah they pick up and he did made which I've I've said many times in picking up Hagar Israel to this day is paying for that mistake and so we find that then he he comes before abimelech the Philistine King and he's doing it again he's doing it again so it wasn't that Abraham didn't have his ups and downs like Elijah it wasn't that Abraham wasn't a man of like passions like Elijah Amen brother Brandon said that meant he had his ups and downs there was only one perfect man and that was Christ there's only one elected son and that's Christ how did I get elected because I was in Christ see and so so we find that what Abraham never staggered at was the promise Abraham Abraham was as far as his life was concerned an acceptance with God and a Justified State before God which is not an easy thing to get that it was actually imputed unto him not that he lived it to deserve it but that he didn't stagger at the promise in other words he believed the word and by believing the word for his hour God imputed all the righteousness of himself to Abraham wow see so so we find then that that to me this was so beautiful Sunday when brother uh don was reading from the wiestick expanded translation and that second verse how that he said to stop assuming an outward expression that does not come from within you and is not representative of what you are in your inner being I when you read that Brother Don I nearly jumped off the couch I couldn't believe what I was hearing this was so beautifully said and and and it goes on to say that that that you should but um not representative what you are on the inner uh your inner being but is patterned uh let me start again stop assuming the outward expression that does not come from within you and it's not representative of what you are in your inner being so it goes to show what brother Branham said there was another William Branham Town inside there see so but being but is TR but is patterned after this age so stop acting like you're you're a citizen of the age because you're not a citizen of of any age you're a citizen of Eternity see and so don't let your life be patterned like that but change your outward expression to one that comes from within and is representative of your inner being that is so powerful you know that that's when you go to look at some of the things that Paul talked about and Paul goes down a list and you know women call him a woman hater because you know he he talked about you know women not cutting their hair he talked about men uh having a short hair woman you know uh having long hair uncut hair and and it goes down into more than that he goes down into the areas of your life how you should live and how you should not live see and and the world loves the loves the ideology that well it's only what's in your heart that counts and and you say well you know God knows my heart I love him so it doesn't matter how I live first of all that's not novel that's not new that's gnosticism 101 and and I Irene has caught those gnostics the Sons of Satan so it does matter how you express the love of God in your heart and if the if God is truly in your heart you will obey the word of God and that's simple or you'll die trying and I I may not make it perfectly but I'll leave this world trying Hallelujah because it's my goal it's my everything and you know Paul when he a lot of people misunderstand they Paul what Paul is trying to get the church to understand is that how if I could say it like this how tragic it would be what a travesty What an unthinkable what a what a terrible thing if you as a real believer giving credit that you're a real one but that you lived in a certain way that was like the age and someone accidentally mistook you for not being a Christian Paul is like wow that's like the worst possible thing you could ever have happen is if your conversation or your lifestyle or where you went or your Recreation or how you dressed how you acted your attitude and your actions and reactions and somebody by mistake thought you weren't a Christian Paul is saying that is the most horrible thing to imagine happening to a child of God and we need to we need to take it we need to uh feel the weight of that friends it does matter and and Paul talked about a chaste conversation and that's not you know what you're saying out of your mouth merely but you're it's your it's the conversation of your life it that's why you're the final voice to the final age God doesn't need you to come and redo the shout what God needs you to do is be the Living Word see and so I I was so appreciating you know brother Don's angle that you're I wrote down some of his statements that just blew me over you're perfect by the blood but we're not we're not yet a finished work so he's still working I just say get out of the way and let him work I appreciated his reference to Ephesians 1 9-10 how that it was literally the very theme of the message it was the message in a nutshell that's exactly what brother Brandon was trying to get across to us in Christ is the mystery of God revealed having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to that which seemed good to him which good thing he purposed it himself with respect to an administration of the completion of the epoch of time tears here it is here's why the message came to bring back again to their original state all things in the Christ the things you're in the Christ he's bringing you back to an original state to all things in Christ the things in the heavens and the things on the earth in him because Christ is his word all right so so I love this statement Brother Don this one I'm gonna never forget this one we have to make the transition from becoming Believers to becoming becomers I want to run are like John dankba I want to run oh you know to think about it friend that that that as brother Dom was saying you can you can take that as a threat but you know it's it's not God trying to threaten you it's it's it's God it's God you know try it's God wanting you to come to this conclusion to say wow you mean all of this preaching and this hard line and this corrective preaching you can take it as a threat or you can say I oh God must love me he wants me to be like him and I thank God for it those are your two options he wants me to be free is there anything wrong with that he wants me to have a clean life he wants you to have a clean life he wants you to have a clean mind he wants you to have a clean home he wants you to have clean families how many can say me Lord me Lord I volunteer Hallelujah in the in the self-translation that I did some years ago the book of Romans I'm gonna from every re-familiarize you with that first and second verse the translation that I did verses one and two of Romans 12 I therefore I urge you Brothers in view of God's mercy to take every every day to start again therefore I urge you Brothers in view of God's mercy to take your everyday ordinary life you're sleeping eating going to work and walking around life and place it before God as a holy and acceptable sacrifice did I miss any important stage of your life this is your everyday walking talking life see whether you're at church on Sunday or at work on Monday see this is your spiritual act of worship and rational religious service to him verse 2. and do not conform yourselves to this age but be transformed by the word to operate the mind of Christ that you may be able to discern and follow God's will that is what is good well pleasing to him and perfect how many want to operate the mind of Christ do you know that you can separate yourself from the world and not be a person of the age but be a person of heaven and you will be the one God chooses to operate the mind of Christ because that's always been his plan so so it's amazing when I when I look at Romans 12. so so now I I I I should I should I should drop back to my opening volley to to finish that to to kind of get the other book into it so we we see Abraham making these kinds of mistakes but yet we see that because of his faith in the word god imputed righteousness to him by his faith see not of his Works lest anyone should boast and and and so so we find out that that when he he did that but everything everywhere that you read of his ups and downs and his backsliding was prior to him having the promised son once Isaac is born and now you have the office of sonship in Abraham's life now Abraham's life has been moved into sun oh my once that happened once sonship came about you never find again Abraham stumbling doubting falling I'm here to tell you that's what God sees In You and I and no wonder this is exactly my title Jehovah in the body Bride of the sonship expression you are perfect in Christ because you have believed the word and you've entered into an office of son you're the continuation of the son of God a direct quote you're part of God's godhead that's a statement see literally every son and daughter a part of God's godhead it's amazing how that this portion in Romans is all about God's work in you and your co-opting the process for yourself and cooperating in the vision it's a it's it's both it's God doing something and you saying I'll take that for me I'll be a part of it I'm gonna he says there I need to be a sacrifice I need to present my body and what's it going to do so that he can bring everything back to the original I'm going to co-op that plan I'm going to take a part of it I'm going to take advantage of it I'm going to cooperate in it how do you cooperate by living a Flawless life no by believing every word Hallelujah by by saying amen from my deepest realm in my heart and when I Stumble I'll go and repent and I'll say Lord you know I didn't mean to do that and that'll be true so it's amazing when I think about it how that this portion in Romans is all about God's work in you God working in you and and it's all about bringing you back to connect it with Ephesians 1 bringing you back to the original state and Paul says to present your bodies as your reasonable service 2 contains be it transformed by the renewing of your mind so it's an amazing thing that's going on here that God is doing and intending to have you as a partner see finishing the other end of it right yet by the time if we went on down to in our text by the time they get you get to verse 9 somehow they've turned it around to standards for judging other people by and and lose the whole realization that he's working in you somehow from verse one to two just just a few just eight or nine verses later by the time you get to verse nine now they're already starting to oh wow God's doing this great thing for me well let me now I'm going to be the chief judge and I'm going to judge everybody that's not living as good as me and you've missed the whole point say it's already ran you off in a ditch and those people you're criticizing are already ahead of you because they're just humbly believing God's word Hallelujah see you know as a preacher I think every minister in here would agree as preachers we really can't help people who don't think they need help you know people who've already put a check mark by their name on all these practical instructions you know not not not it doesn't occur to them that Enoch was daily walking upward I'm pressing on the upward Way New Heights I'm gaining every day see brother Branham described like that he said Enoch just kept walking higher and higher till finally he got closer to Heaven it was closer to come on into heaven than it was to go back to Earth and he said God just took him I'm here to tell you something friends I'm pressing on the upward way and I love it that it was God God who finished the last leg of the journey God God took him I don't I don't think I'm qualified to change my body into a glorified body but I know there's coming a trumpet and I know God is going to keep his word and God is going to finish what I can't finish Hallelujah brother Brandon makes some astonishing statements out of this message Christ is the mystery of God revealed he starts talking about the threefold plan now it's a three-fold plan because remember he has one goal and it's in three phases the goal is expression brother random said in all the Bible God had one goal in all the people's lives everything that we read it's all God expressing his one goal and then brother Branham says and tonight we're going to see what that is and the whole sermon is about God expressing himself in Christ Christ expressing himself in the church brother Brandon says it like this speaking of his three-fold plan first to express himself completely God in Christ second to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them not easy and thirdly here's the payoff to restore the kingdom that's me and you the kingdom to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first Adam all right so so phase one of God's threefold plan what's firstly for God to fully Express himself in Christ in the Earthly Tabernacle right so which of course you know I don't really have time to get into it tonight but that in other words to bring to fulfillment Exodus 40. because when you read Exodus 40 it's the whole Tabernacle how it's built every purpose every facet of it and it's all speaking about Christ he was in a body everything in all those verses I think 35 30 some odd more or more than that verses in Exodus 40. we don't have time to read it tonight I'm not really preaching on that but but one thing that is to be noted is that when you come when the when it's all finished and they get it completed verse 34 talks about how that that literally the glory of God came down and so literally the the the the the the Bible imagery that you're seeing is that that when it's all built according to God's word that that by faith every part was put together in obedience to God's word then the Tabernacle itself cries out with Glory and I mean when now now just follow it in the scripture because when you come to Luke Chapter 2 and now you've got God tabernacling that Tabernacle now in a body Angels appear and what do they say glory to God in the highest see and then and then so then Paul comes to to Romans chapter four I should I should probably I should probably just read that for you so Paul comes to Romans 4. he's talking about justification through faith all right so now he comes down here uh let me catch from verse 20. he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith see he staggered not at the promise but he was strong in faith he had ups and downs but he was strong in faith and he staggered not at the promise and what did that produce giving glory to God so at the when the Tabernacle is finished the Tabernacle declares Glory when Christ comes into his body the Angels declare Glory when Paul comes and says Abraham staggered not at the promise he was strong in the faith doing what what did that do it gave glory to God see and so then he goes on he says all right he says and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform and therefore therefore because of this Faith because his life his faith glorified God his his life didn't perfectly glorify God he had failures in it but what what glorified God was his faith and therefore God dismissed all of his failures and wouldn't even record them in the in the New Testament era and to say here's the Epitaph of his life he staggered not at the promise of God but whacked stronger the longer it went the the the strongest faith God see and so he says and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness sake that's fantastic brother Paul I'm glad to know that about Abraham Paul's not finished verse 23 . now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed unto him but for us also to whom it shall be shall be if we believe leave on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and raised for our justification now when he comes in Acts chapter 2 what is it doing it's bringing glory to God again because the word has tabernacled in flesh and you've got a bride body who has now entered into the office of son and what does your life do what does your faith do it brings glory to God see oh my wish I had time to preach on that so so when we look at Romans 1 and 2. so we see God giving us the instructions how to get to where he wants us to be make your bodies a Living Sacrifice don't be conformed don't don't don't let your outside look like the age because that's not the real you let your outside match your inside amen amen see and so so so so that this was now god's second phase there in Acts 2 he's gaining preeminence in his church and his body because that that that's that's just as important as phase one phase two is made possible by phase one phase one was God that manifesting himself fully in Christ but phase two is just as important because brother Brandon picks that up in the Rising Sun and he and he starts tying there in a few other places and he starts talking about Jesus raising from the tomb and how glorious it was and there had never been a man there have been many great men and many great men died for a very great cause but there had never been a man who could raise himself back up again after he died see and but and you know the whole audience there is rejoicing in that and then brother Branham almost like a wet blanket he says now that was fine that was great for him but what's that do for me I'm glad he raised but what about me if that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you it shall also Quicken your mortal body I'm so glad the devil can't stop that I'm so glad he's but it's already too late I've already believed I've already had it righteousness imputed I'm already walking the upper way oh my so he's coming into his second phase and so just like phase one makes way for phase two Romans 12 1 makes white for Romans 12 2. and in fact is verse 2 not only I mean verse 2 is what really glorifies God that it worked that he was a sacrifice and you're a sacrifice and he lived obedient and you live obedient and you allow you don't let your mind be transformed by the age see you you you you're transformed by the Holy Spirit see by how renewing of your mind to prove what is that good and acceptable thing so then it literally literally verse 2 is made possible by verse one and in fact it gives purpose to verse one so then when you come to God's third phase of restoring the kingdom that is all made possible and it actually gives it further purpose when you have because now it's actually combining verse 1 and verse two because now he's actually accomplishing his goal his goal was expression and he's coming to his third phase of restoring the kingdom don't think of somewhere over a rainbow in Alpha Centauri brother Branham says in the seventh seal he says this has been happening and this has been happening he said what is it it's the kingdom coming as it has been I'm here to tell you when uh why not when the mighty Angel descended and and when he comes to claim the book what is he doing he's going to get to the point where he calls for his Queen to stand by his side and I'm here to tell you that's going to happen oh one of these days a trumpet will sound in the dead and Christ shall rise and we which Our Lives remain shall be changed and caught up together so it all gives purpose and makes it even possible in fact is restoring the kingdom that's why Revelation 11 1 shows the bride's final view the final the final Testament of the Bride after Revelation 10 is completed the last thing you see is a measurable standard of an inner of an inner inner sanctuary and it says don't measure the outer court because that's given to the Gentiles they're headed into a tribulation but measure the inside where the Shekinah is where the pride is when she leaves the Earth she's in his very image see so here we see it helps our understanding in the godhead because first Elohim is in the Sun and now the expression of Jehovah he's now in an expression in his entire bride body see so so then it's fully Jehovah hence my title then it's fully Jehovah and the body Bride of the sonship expression see at producing and now manifesting and this is big it's now manifesting the great mystery of husband and wife see it's always been husband and wife because it's husband and wife who come together and bring forth A reproduction what what's what's coming what's coming reproduced the seed of the progenitor the very God of creation they're very Fountain way back there in eternity that brother Branham said oh that Fountain way back in eternity before there was even anything that Fountain was there and out of it was flowing Grace and love and mercy and God with his attributes of wanting to be a family and envisioned you and envisioned me I hope that I hope that burns in your heart tonight you're a Believer because he envisioned you oh my husband and wife are actually the original model to do what to bring forth A reproduction see so Christ you know it Christ the word of God which in fact was God it was with God and actually it was God see so it's Christ in you Paul said this great mystery it's Christ in you the hope of glory so it's God bringing forth his kingdom the original vision of God and the answer to the original question why why what the why of everything the wife of everything the whole purpose and the true meaning of life in the first place ain't what people say what's the whole meaning of life I'm preaching on it tonight this was the whole meaning of life this was the assistant the answer to all the questions see so when they come to him to Jesus in Matthew 16. um give me that brother Joshua uh Matthew 16 and what does catch uh maybe 13 through 19. let's just do that for now so he says here Matthew 16 13-19 oh I gotta hurry when Jesus came into the coast of caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying who do men that's one who do men say that I am so that's one question about a specific category of people who do men say all right that I the son of man am and they said well some say that thou art John the Baptist this is what people say some Elijah others Jeremiah one of the prophets now watch the distinction he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am so notice the distinction he draws that Brother Don was zeroing in on this that that real you that's down on the inside a part of God's literal DNA a part of your from God's Gene that's why you believe the word that's why you can't be lost that's why you can't be deceived see because this bride in the last day is prophesied that she's going to receive the restoration of the full word and then she's going to pick up where the first church began to decline and she's going to carry it on to a body change and there's not another age coming you are the last generation that will ever be in history you are the generation upon whom the ends of the world have come this is it we're wrapping up we're going home the craziness of the world should inform your thinking on that if nothing does so so when he he's he makes this distinction okay who do they say but who do you say see because Paul picks that up in in his letter to the thessalonicans also you know he starts talking about how that your children of the day you're not of the night they that are drunken or drunken at night but you are of the day we be not of them you understand he goes on so he's asked but but he said unto them whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of a living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven now that can only be a spiritual experience see because it's not something he learned from flesh and blood so it's spiritual it's some Supernatural and Jesus doesn't mince words my Father in Heaven taught you that see and I and I've taught it for years and showed you from the from the original Greek and I uh from the from the imminent uh Greek Theologian Spirit zodiatis the editor of one of my of my Bible I carried for years uh and I got this recent uh Spurgeon Bible which I love even more but but when you when I was I remembered as a young preacher and I was looking at zodiati's notes on that verse because he he made the point that it's unfortunate that people think of this term blessed art thou that word blessed that it somehow means fortunate or lucky and he says it doesn't mean that at all it says it's an unfortunate misunderstanding of the Greek language because in English you think oh blessed well he's he's fortunate he said it's not about being fortunate it's not about you know winning a lottery that literally this is his words of the meaning now ironically after he passed away a bunch of people got in there in his organization and they watered it all down after I got like my third edition they had changed that but I still got the first one in my storage and I've got it underlined and he he says it comes from a Greek word McKay it's from it's a word macarius from the root McCary Macario and and he says literally what it means Is possessing the characteristic of deity wow so Jesus isn't saying to Peter you're really lucky that you understand that you're really fortunate you're up you're ahead of the class you're you're ahead of your of your fellows that's not it he was saying Peter you recognize me and I recognize you I say that thou art Peter and you recognize me and I recognize you because we have a common father that we came from the same progenitor we came from the same gene pool Hallelujah and that's how you know who I am in the world flesh and blood never taught it they can't teach it it came from my father you are The Offspring of my father you are my brother you will be the when when the Holy Ghost comes you will be the continuation of my life Hallelujah see so he says and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church upon what rock a revelation how does it come it's given by God well how does that work because you're a part of God and you recognize the word you're a part of and you can't even deny it see so it's never been about people getting lucky or people getting smart it's not about that election is based squarely on Origin brother JD's been teaching that it's based squarely on Origin Jesus said I come from God I go back to God Jesus knowing that he came from God and went to God laid aside his garments see and so so he says Thou Art Peter Upon This Rock I'll build my church in the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven because I will give keys to the family I'm not going to give them to non-family nobody in non-family's not getting keys to my house but I'll gladly give my garage code and my keys to my family you understand so I will give Thee the keys to the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven this is Jesus prophesying knowing that his mind would be in Peter knowing that that's what the Holy Ghost would come for that this mind that was in Christ could be in you so that you could make your body a Living Sacrifice so that you wouldn't be conformed to the world not you not you you can be transformed by the renewing of your mind see and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven let me try to zip through these quotes real quick this is all from Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother Brandon picks up paragraph 216. now if you you're if you go go back and for those listening if you hit an archive and you're making notes you're if you pull up the quotes you're going to see that I'm reading and then I'm skipping and reading and skipping and reading because it's way too much to read uh to you but it's all there you can go back and get it paragraph 216. he said who do you think that I am now now there is the church he is talking to see what does man think I am all right so now do you have your distinction in mind you got that remember he's made a distinction all right so now we're going forward everybody got that all right today so here he says what does man think that I am and brother Branham just brings it up takes two Millennial leaps and brings it into our modern day he says well today he's a philosopher this social religion he was a good man we believe his teaching is right it's subject to be lived by I think it make us all better if we did it we ought to have it in our churches and so forth brother Branham says that's a Santa Claus that's a Santa Claus like a Santa Claus story paragraph 218 it's not expressions of some church that we should Express something it's a life that you don't live yourself but he comes in you and lives by himself and you become a prisoner put on the gods Lord oh and I love this I love this because this here's an angle brother Dom was trying to get you to you know let let go of your own mind there's a greater mind to be had see and so brother Branham says you become a prisoner to what what am I prisoner to to any human intellectual being at all you're you're you're you're locked away in Christ by Revelation you're not subject to man-made reasoning you're immune from that you're predestinated to be immune from the lie that's taking down the whole world and you've got an injected immunity that you cannot be deceived by that lie though it's taking down seven and a half billion humans it won't take you because why you have a characteristic of deity down inside of you see so he says you're led by the spirit and how do you know how do you know he says if you have the mind of Christ expresses himself through you shows that it's him and not you see so now we're coming back to our very daily walking around walking talking working living life now you're getting down to what it means to not be conformed Paul wouldn't say that if it was if it was needless see absorb that get that he's talking to believers and he's telling them don't be conformed see because you you can get that way but I'm telling you be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you can prove whose family you're in so they can prove God's word is true say why doesn't it just work automatically because God didn't want a kingdom of robots he wants a kingdom of Overcomers see you you've got it you've got to advance now to becoming a becomer not just a believer but a becomer so he says a real man is to lose his own thoughts and his own thinking not come up blindly like that no sir you you come up with your right senses he's talking about you know you're not insane you're not crazy like the world thinks you are Christ takes you over and expresses himself and now to the world you're an insane person see but in your mind that you know I can just speak for myself and I trust and hope that you have the same feeling when I look around at what this world has become and is becoming every day it has be it is becoming so twisted and so perverted and so impossible and I I disdain all of it I think it's crazy I don't want nothing to do with it I want to I want to escape it I want to see a new world I'm not interested in being a success story of this age Hallelujah I might have to live in an alley by but I'll have eternal life I'm not I'm I'm not putting all my chips on this life this life means very little it only matters the next life see and when Christ takes you over he'll Express that word right through you because it's him he is the word see and then you can see the expression of Christ not some illusion of some sort but a real genuine Christ expressing himself right through you how beautiful that's real Beauty see so he says he goes on here paragraph 225 dropping down he is asking the church his twelve out of the millions of that day he has 12 his church in the millions in the days of Noah he asked eight the whole thing paragraph 230 the whole thing is the revelation of God to do what to take Eve back to her rightly to her right position again with her husband notice and God is the husband of the church and the church is his bride so he says now Peter when he called said Thou Art the Christ the son of living God now watch blessed art thou Simon by Jonah which means son of Jonah see blessed art thou for Flesh and Blood never revealed this to you that's Peter the predestinated seed of God that had received this light and given the keys to the kingdom I'll build my church Upon This Rock a revelation of Jesus Christ all right now watch I'm just I'm taking my last five or six minutes all right Christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation now how important is it to be transformed by the renewing of your mind how important is it to not be conformed by the world how important is it see because if you can if you can accomplish what Paul is saying then Christ becomes the center of your life the center of your Revelation see and so Christ in you he says all right so so Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do see what God is trying to do what is the new birth then you'd say well brother Branham what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen see not you joined a church you shook a hand you done something different you said a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church is built upon what is it last one what is it it's Christ paragraph 236 what is it it's Christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself isn't that easy see that's God's purpose for Jesus Christ was to express himself to take his own laws and live by his laws and fulfill his laws by death and Christ God died in human flesh in order to condemn sin in the flesh see so so so Peter we want to take time to turn Peter talks about in First Peter 2 24 who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree Paul picks up in Colossians 2 10-14 and you're completing him which is the head of all principality and Power in whom also you're circumcised with the circumcision made without hands and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ buried with him in baptism wherein also you're risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the dead now watch first last two verses and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross so the Amplified says it like this in verse 14 having canceled and blotted out and wiped away the handwriting of the bond the note the bond with its legal decrees and its demands which was in force and stood against us hostile to us this note with its regulations decrees and demands he has set aside and cleared completely out of the way by nailing it to his cross by the way whis says it like this having obliterated the handwritten document consisting of ordinances the one which was against us which was directly opposed to us and he removed it out of the midst with the result with the result you want the result you want a cliffhanger with the result see that it no it is no longer there having nailed it to his cross the NLT says it like this he canceled the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to his cross Hallelujah the MSG says that old arrest warrant was canceled Hallelujah I'm here to tell you Luther nailed a 95 thesis to Wittenberg church but that was nothing compared to the book he nailed to his cross and I'm free tonight it's been canceled and removed Hallelujah oh friends that's where we live in the realities of God's word by by the by the sacrifice of himself see because our flesh is the problem I realize I just want to read these I thought I thought it was I got two more quotes right here because our flesh is the problem so he condemned sin in the flesh because your flesh was the problem so you know what he did he condemned sin in the flesh because you know why because I couldn't pull it off my heart loves him my heart believes his word My Flesh was the problem but my heart loves him My Flesh was a problem but my heart believes him so what did he do he knew I would believe his word he put a gene inside me but this old stinking flesh and so he condemned sin in the flesh and removed all the ordinance against you and against me forever now I stand perfect before God why because I'm good enough I got a book of rules no because I have believed his word like Abraham I believe his word [Applause] so brother Brandon says finally that he might bring to himself a glorious bride redeemed back that will believe only in the word of God and not swap it like he did for intellectual conceptions of man you see it that's Christ's idea that's God's idea the new birth reveals this it's a man who came up with this plan God well you you sure seem to count yourself pretty pretty amazing well it wasn't my plan I I was finished I couldn't do anything I couldn't even get out of the Dugout much less walk up to the to the to the batter's box but somebody came out on my behalf Hallelujah then the new birth in Christ pair of 240. the the new birth in Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things he did making the word manifest he's so so the question is what's going to happen when all of that group gets together see oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is why was Brother Don why was Brother JD laboring to show you the gene of God for weeks and weeks why was Brother Don laboring to try to get you to understand the real mystery of God what is this all about tonight what is it about to say this is Jehovah now tabernacling in his pride body and she's come into the office of son Hallelujah she's The Offspring of God see the blindness of the age I'm gonna say this come on musicians Anthony bring your team and come on I'll make these last comments to you the blindness of this age I want you to absorb this don't get distracted don't run out the door yet there's a great blindness on this last generation it's prophesied in the Bible you can read about it in Revelation 3. and the blindness of the age deceives this last generation of humanity into thinking in their pitiful state it deceives them into thinking they have need of nothing it that's the same as saying it deceives them into thinking they have all they need see but your revelation given to you by God tells you otherwise you're not deceived by that a blindness that's taking seven and a half billion people but your Revelation given to you by God tells you otherwise the world believes that they are making a better world to live in but a prophet said he acknowledged that that's what they think a prophet understood that he discerned their hearts and they didn't really want that but that's what prophets do and he said they think they're making a better world to live in by their knowledge brother Branham said they're actually making a better world to sin in and it's getting easier and easier at magnificently easier with every passing day that they eat from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil they are believing now what's causing this because they're believing a false word catch that they're believing a false word of the devil which brother Branham called a delusion by Satan see so they're believing a false word by the devil you try to tell them that they are destroying life which they will the end of the tribulation God don't have to destroy anything man he always let man destroy himself and you try to tell them that they're destroying life and yet they will say no we're improving life they're wrong they're wrong they say no we're improving life they're wrong now you have received a true word not a delusion by Satan you have received a true word and you have received a promise that when the seal is broken it releases the what's on the inside and brother Branham said that word is released and down comes an anointing upon the word to make it live to make it live inside of you Hallelujah on you say well brother Jason I don't I really don't believe that I'm accomplishing that you're wrong you're wrong he's doing more in you than you are aware the world believes they're creating life they're wrong because they're believing a delusion by Satan you're believing the engrafted word the unsealed mystery you say oh I don't think I'm making it I'm not overcoming you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong God has already overcome everything you have need of you're you're going in a Rapture because you have believed the word of God and it didn't come from man and Flesh and Blood didn't teach it but your father which is in heaven oh your faith in the revealed word is gaining more and more life from the Tree of Life how many want that life from the Tree of Life not the knowledge of of Good and Evil but from the Tree of Life oh let's stand friends can you absorb tonight that you are literally Jehovah Jehovah is now living in his bride body she's now the continuation of his life she's the expression in sonship God has accomplished this because he sent a word that was kin to you he sent a word and you believed it because there was a word inside of you and two omnipotents met and brother Brandon said when light struck that seed it come to life say brother Jason did you feel good enough to be a believer no but when light struck the sea I come to life oh do you think that you deserve to go on a Rapture quite actually no but light struck the sea and life has come forth hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God friends this is what God has accomplished oh my goodness wow Wow Wow Let's sing brother amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] come on now all together [Music] [Applause] [Music] God changing in pain

with that particular scholarship that whatever that scholarship does not cover in addition to other scholarships that he gets Clemson will fill in the Gap and give him the rest of the funding so he got a full ride so this means you're going to live in Greenville for a while boom um but you know I prayed that if it was the Lord's will that that would you know he would open the door and he
