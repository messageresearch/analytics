TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Good morning everyone. Good morning. Happy Easter. Looks like everybody's still uh getting their Easter finest on this morning. Just taking a little extra time. So, [laughter] the few that are here, God bless you. Amen. Let's stand. Let's pray. Father, we thank you so much for your goodness and your mercy. Lord, we thank you that your your word is alive and that it's real, Lord. It's not it's not just a myth or some history, Lord, but it's a living word that brings to pass whatever promise, Lord, that faith connects to, Lord. And so, we want to just come with faith, believing your word, receiving your word, Lord. Make it plain. Make it clear to us, Lord. Open it to our hearts. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. All right, you could be seated. So, I'm going to pull up that PowerPoint again. Thank you. Continuing on the gene of God part three and looking at the nature of man's life and its source as well as immortality and the inject injection of death and destruction. And we want to then relate it back to election and the genetics of the human race from the garden of Eden all the way to the new heavens and the new earth. So in this one um part three I [snorts] don't know what it's doing. It's going backwards. There we go. We want to look more at the gene of God and just kind of plant this seed as we go forward. So, G, as you could see, the word gene is there in the word Genesis. Genesis is actually the Greek translation for the word beginning, which is in Hebrewit. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. And so then we find in the New Testament this word begotten or born. And for for for Jesus Christ it's he's spoken of as the only begotten son of God. So the monogano is the word there. The unique or one-of-a-kind begotten son of God. So that word gene is right there as well. Again it speaks of beginning. same thing the beginning or or the start or to come into existence but it also looks at more than that the term gene when we look at the term gene we think we have to think of origin we can't just think of beginning we have to think of its origin so gene is a unit of heredity which is transferred from a parent to an offspring and is held to determine some characteristic of the offspring and so you know we talk about these these different terminologies the the gene of God and you know I'm not calling it genes of God of course in us is the genes of God we are the genes of God plural but what I'm really looking at is he is the or his origin and how that origin the gene of God then passes on to the predestinated seed through history and and you might look at me and think how does this all connect together that's that's going to be the point of this and future studies. So again, it speaks of origin, but not just of origin. It speaks of origin with its characteristics. The idea of nature, same idea behind the word attribute. Brother Baron says, "You're gene of God. You're an attribute of God." These words are closely connected together, just looking at a different aspect. I believe gene speaks of origin and attribute speaks of that characteristic that's in inserted into that gene that comes into us. We can we'll talk about how that comes into us as we go on. So our nature and our characteristics come from our origin and of course outside forces affect and impact that but ultimately we are limited by our nature and characteristics. 1 John 3 8-10. He that committh sin is of the devil, for the devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil. Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin, for his seed remainth in him, whose seed remains in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of God. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. Whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. This is a this this is looking at it as the the results. This is these are the results of the word of God coming forth, right? We're born what are we born of? We're we're begotten again by the word of truth, by the by the gospel. We hear the word, we we receive it by faith. God opens our hearts and we're born again. Right? So, and then a life is produced. So, he that commit commits sin is of the devil. He that is born of God doesn't commit sin. And we spoke about this last time looking back at unbelief. The only sin that God cannot forgive is unbelief. There's many attributes of unbelief. You know, scripture talks about them. Um, homosexuality, fornication, uh, cursing, gossip, lying, stealing, etc. These are all that's not sin. They're sins, but they're attributes of sin. And so, uh, he that's born of God cannot disbelieve God's word. Right? Well, you're born in sin and shaped in iniquity. you're you're born in unbelief. But when when you're converted, right? When you when you're when you're your heart is transformed by the power of God, you cannot commit sin. Why can you not commit sin? Because his seed remains in him. That's that's the origin, right? Born of God, the seed of God that remains in him and he cannot sin. As we look at the bigger picture, we're we're not trying to trying to present the idea that when you're born, the seed comes into you, right? Because if if you look at the bigger picture, your your your human birth, the the seed is there by the from the genes of God, from the genetics of God. That's all that's already there. And as we look at that, we'll we'll bear that out in the scripture. But again, this is showing the life source and then the characteristics or the attributes or how the gene is manifested in the life. If you're born of God, you're going to you're not going to sin. If you're from the devil, you you sin from the beginning, from the from from the beginning to the end. The word is manifested. What do you do? You disbelieve that word because you're a sinner. But if you if your seed comes from God, then the word comes forward and you believe it. Amen. Ephesians 2 1 and two. And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins, where in time wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience, among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as others Now notice it doesn't say you were children of wrath, but it says the nature that you had inside of you was just like the children of wrath. It says among whom we had our conversation. We were right among them. We were right among them. But you were always predestinated seed. But you were right there among them. You had the same nature. You have the same life. We have two natures, right? There's two natures in in the soul. So where did I stop? But God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ. By grace are you saved. Amen. So there's that there there has to be a life there. Again we look through scripture redemption. We see redemption. We see reconciliation. We see restoration. All those words have a re in front of it. In other words, it's bringing us back to something that we lost. God is bringing us back to the original life that we were to be born with. Right? He's bringing us back to the original condition that we were meant to come through Adam and Eve. John 10 26-28. But you believe not because you're not of my sheep. As I said unto you, my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish perish. Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. So we see there's two types of people in the world, sheep and not sheep. And the they're they're identified by a characteristic. those who are not of Jesus sheep what they they don't believe right you see Jesus is going back to origin this is not this doesn't work well if you're if you believe in free will and free choice God made you to be something he predestinated you you to be something he either predestinated you to be a sheep who hear the word or not a sheep who won't believe the word my sheep hear my voice. If you're not a sheep, you won't hear and you won't believe, right? So, it's not as though, well, you were you were a you were a dog or or you were a, you know, a pig and he changed you from being a dog or a pig to a sheep. No, he says you you sheep, you're out there living in the in the in the hog pen contrary to what God created to you to be. You're rolling around in the filth of the hogpen. And all of a sudden, the shepherd comes and says, "You're what are you doing? You You're not You're not a filthy hog. You're a sheep. Get out here." Then he washes us off and cleans us and put it puts us in in to feed on his his grass. Amen. To hear his voice. And that's important to understand. If you're looking at this verse and you think, "Well, just by my human choice, I become a sheep." That's not what it is. You're a pre-existing sheep. You have a pre-existing condition. That's your sheep or not sheep. If you're not sheep, you'll hear the words of Jesus. What nonsense. What garbage. What a hater. But if you're sheep, you'll hear that word and say, "Thank you, Lord. Thank you for the correction. Thank you for the conviction." He says, "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen." Right? So that rebuke, that chastening comes and we say, "Amen." And we fall at the altar and we say, "Lord, forgive me. Lord, cleanse me." And he does it. Amen. That's his love. John 11:52. And not for that, this is the this is the prophecy of Caiaphas. And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. So we see that there's children of God scattered through the whole earth. At this point in time, God is dealing with Israel, right? And he's saying there's children of God that are scattered all over the earth. And the word has to go out and go forward. And after his death, burial, resurrection, that word has to go through the apostles to to the nations so that he can gather his children together. See there, that's a pre-existing condition. children of God. They are children of God. Not they'll become children of God by the new birth. They are children of God and they're scattered out. And he says, I got to gather them not into one place but into Christ. Galatians 4 1-3. Now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differs nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all. Now I want to just plant this this this picture here is he's talking about adoption. And our word in English adoption means you take someone who is not your child and you make them legally your child. There's nothing in this picture that speaks of such an idea. This is not saying well I went out and found an orphan and made him my son. Is that what it's is that what this verse is telling us about? Absolutely not. It's talking about the placing. And it's it's talking about entering into the place where you're fully a son and operating in the authority that God wants you to be in. Now I say that the heir. So first of all he's the heir. He's the inheritor. His father owns the estate. He he's going to take ownership of that when his fathers dies. But he's in training. See, as long as he is a child, he differs nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all, but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. Even so, we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world. So, here's a here's the picture. The picture is our life before Christ. God has a purpose in it. Even though we're in bondage under the elements of the world. In other words, the nature the na the the ele what's the elements of the world. It's Satan the prince of the power of the air. You walked after the nature of the s the people that are the children of the devil. You had the same nature dwelling in you. You weren't the children of the devil. You're the you're you're you're the son of the father. But you by nature you were under bondage to the elements of the world. I guess that was our tutor. That was our governor to lead us to Christ. But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his son made of a woman, made under the law to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the the adoption hotheis, the placing of sons. And because look at that verse six, because you became sons. No, because you are sons. God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart crying, "Aba, father." It it doesn't say you become sons. He says because you are one that has come out from God. Because your origin is God. You are you can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That's the adoption. That's the placing of sons. That's entering in. So when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost, your name on the check is just as good. Why? You can, as brother Brad preached, you can speak that word soon as you receive the B. Now, we we might do it. We might need to grow in maturity a lot when we're first born again, but nevertheless, when God speaks to you and you speak, it's just it's just the same as God speaking. So now let's look at the other the other side of the coin, the other the other place. Genesis 3:14 and 15. Now, something different got injected into this, we'll say this God race. God God made Adam and Eve and what did he do? He placed his life into them. But then this foreign thing got injected. We're going to go into the all of these things in the scriptures, but I wanted to leave this here so you could see th this injection of a hybrid life. Genesis 3:14-15. And the Lord God said unto the serpent, "Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field, upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed. It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." All right. So from this verse, we can understand many things. First of all, the serpent is uh walks on two feet, right? His curse puts him on his belly. He wasn't originally on his belly. He was up on two feet. And we learn in Genesis 3 that he could speak and he could reason. He spoke to the woman and he reasoned with her. We also learn from her reaction to this happening that it was the norm. The serpent wasn't miraculously endowed with the capability to speak by the devil. No, he was able to speak. He was able to reason. He was just like man, but he wasn't made in the image and likeness of God. He didn't have a soul. He certainly had a spirit. He had intelligence. And he had the capability to to reason. And then we see here he says,"I'll put enmity between thee and the woman." Why? Because there was not enmity before. So there's now now he puts uh a repulsion. Something that the woman and and the serpent say we don't want anything to do with each other. And between thy seed and her seed. So seed simply means offspring. So between this so the serpent has offspring and the woman has offspring. We understand that this is a prophecy of the Messiah. The seed of the woman Jesus Christ the seed of the serpent serpent is Oops. That's where we have to come in and say who is that? Who is the seed of the serpent? [snorts] Where does that come from? Uh, this isn't meant to be going into serpent seed, although I feel like I want to, but I don't have those notes here with me, and I it's it's a lot of scripture. But but as you understand, there was a sexual act between Adam and Eve. Yes, but Eve and the serpent. And this produced twins. And we see this it's very well-known fact that you can have two uh two fathers and two different genetic sons through one uh woman if if they sleep together within the same period of time. It's called hetereroaternal superfeandation. Say that really fast over and over again. [snorts] It's a it's a scientific fact that it c can happen. And this is what happened. Cain and Abel were twins. And what happened right away? We could see the difference between the offspring. Immediately there's enmity. I mean, it doesn't take it doesn't take a scriptural genius to to put this together. He says there's going to be enmity between two seedlines. Then we fast forward to the next chapter and one's killing the other. Is it hard to is it hard to grasp that there's something strange going on here? There's the serpent seed line was from Cain. seed of the woman was through Abel and then Seth. But ultimately, this is a prophecy. This is a prophecy of Jesus Christ destroying the works of the devil, crushing his head. 2 Corinthians 11 2-4, I think, is one of the clearest scriptures. It's impossible to go away from reading this verse and bringing it back to Genesis and say, "Oh, well, she just ate an apple." What? Let's read it. For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy, for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chasteed virgin to Christ. So, right away, we see apousal and virginity is the picture. Now, don't run to apples. Don't run to eating fruit. The picture is virginity and espousal. All right. But I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtility. So your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom you have not preached, or if you receive another spirit which you have not received, or another gospel which you have not accepted, you might be bear with him. So there we have it. Let's let's go from the beginning to the end. He says, "I'm a I've I've aspoused you. You're engaged to Christ. You're a virgin." Not we're not a virgin by our own works. We're a virgin by the blood of Jesus Christ. He's cleansed us. He's transformed us. Now, we're a virgin and we're espoused to Christ. Then we skip forward and he says, "But I'm afraid that you're going to receive another gospel, another Jesus, another spirit." And what is he saying? I'm afraid you're going to commit adultery with false teaching false doctrine that you're going to bear with someone that's encouraging you to teach false doctrine. So then he we we go to the in between there is that he brings up serpent and Eve. Now, what in the world, if she ate a fruit, what in the world does the serpent and Eve and espousal and virginity have to do with eating an apple? Nothing. Nothing. Let's walk through this again. The church is engaged as a virgin to Christ. Eve was engaged as a virgin to Adam. Paul fears the church's adultery by accepting false word. He compares that then to the original sin. If Paul fears the church committing adultery and compares it to Eve's sin, then we can conclude by the scripture that if I can bring it up, Eve committed adultery with the serpent. This is plain scriptural exposition. I didn't have I didn't have to come up with a fancy dancing around the Bible to come up with this point. You got to dance around the Bible really fancy in order to arrive that an they ate an apple. We never even read the scripture of what Eve's curse was. He gave her a toothache, right? No. They ate an apple, then they realized they're naked. So, we should pass the apples again as the prophet said and maybe double them up since 1960s when he said it. Everybody needs at least 10 apples. No, it wasn't an apple. It was sex. It was adultery. It was And what what was the problem? It was injecting a a life that was not meant to be in this race of God's people in this genetic line of God. Now, a foreign life is inserted in there, right? Because e Eve Adam and Eve were both made in the image and likeness of God. Eve was taken out of Adam in the secondary creation so that she could be be deceived. The Bible says Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. She was able to be deceived. Then the the Cain's line comes in comes in is part from the image and likeness of God and part from the serpent. Right? So you have a hybrid and I'm getting way ahead of myself and I'll never be able to get there. Let me finish the thought that I started and left just left there. Eve said Eve's curse was what? What was her curse? I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy sorrow in thy conceptions. In pain you'll bring forth children. If they ate a a fruit of a literal tree. Go. Why is God talking about offspring? enmity between two people uh between the serpent and the woman and between genetic lines. And then he's talking about cursing re the reproductive process in a woman. It doesn't make sense. God's own principle, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. The the punishment should be commensurate with the crime. Well, that's what it was. It's exactly what it was. John 8:37, "I know that you're Abraham's seed, but you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you." I want to leave that there. They're Abraham's seed, right? They're they're physically from Abraham's line, but they but they're the word has no place in them. That's that is quite a statement. That is something that we should emphasize for a minute because you you can see now we're fast forwarding to the time where the seed of the woman, the prophesied ultimate prophesied seed of the woman is on the scene and we have people trying to kill him. So who is the seed of the serpent? Snakes. Maybe it's uh orangutang or maybe it's baboons. Gorillas who was trying to kill Jesus. It wasn't baboons, gorillas, or snakes, though he did call them vipers. A generation of vipers. Well, who was it? It was men and women that hated him, that didn't want to hear his word because why? There was no place for the word in them. their their their genetics were incompatible with the word of God. So we can we can flip this on the other way. How about Peter and James and John etc. there they heard the word they could receive it. They said that many many times they couldn't even understand what he's saying but they said you we know and are persuaded that you and you alone have the word of life. So why did they do that? because the word had a place in them. They were predestinated seed that had a place inside of their soul that was a receptacle of the word. It's just like a it's just like a cell phone or a laptop. You know, if if if I bring this up and start clicking, okay, I'm going to try to connect to Wi-Fi. I can't use my Bible to connect to Wi-Fi because there's no receiver for Wi-Fi in it. But if I go in here and connect to Wi-Fi, this this has a place to receive Wi-Fi. And that's the same principle. You have you have the Pharisees. There was no place there. [snorts] There was no receptacle for Wi-Fi in them when the Wi-Fi was going forward. They it just passed right through them. Passed right beyond them because it wasn't for them. But for the predestinated seed, those disciples, the word came forward and immediately said, "Ah, now I'm connected. Now I can receive information from the from my source." Amen. Well, I'm going to quit there. Let's stand. Gracious Father, we just come before you, Lord, and we're so thankful and so grateful for your word. I pray that you'd just continue, Lord, to bless us today. We thank you, Lord, for the resurrection of Jesus Christ. We thank you that because he lives, we live also, Lord. Lord, I pray that you'd bless this service, the the the the specials, the the uh worship that's about to
