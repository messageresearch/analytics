for those blood type also um brother donahue his aunt who had surgery um removing the growth is in fear of it being cancerous so let's just remember those two repair requests i mean is there any unspoken prayer requests about the uplift of hands amen so brother as you pray for the offering [Music] amen now i don't know if any of you has followed along with um brother donnie's daughter erica that she's been probably six months seven months battling cancer and you know they gave her a dose of some stuff for chemotherapy a week or two ago and they realized they gave her too much and you know brother donny was talking about you know pray for the doctors because you want the doctors not to make a mistake and they're human too and you know we know god can use doctors and stuff like that but she has been battling this for a long time i think she has two children and um i think she's about not quite 40 years old something like that so it's uh and brother donahue also has uh it's a load

amen [Laughter] amen well i'm still living off of the glory from wednesday night brother caleb wow what a job amen my goodness i think the devil is much more afraid of our brother now praise the lord amen amen praise the lord hallelujah [Applause] i want to by the help of the lord today to take um a continuation of what is uh the church of god and today we've been talking a lot about kingdom order and so today i'm going to take a subtitle kingdom order in servanthood amen kingdom order and servanthood amen that's a word that webster don't like he like he wants to always change it to servant or or hood but i don't like them mashed up but i found plenty of it's a more used a little bit archaic but i enjoy language like that at any rate so what is the church of god this should be i think according to the website part seven and uh we're taking um subtitle kingdom order in servanthood matthew 23 you have it say amen one single verse and we'll have prayer and let you be seated verse 12. you know i'm going to start um let's start in verse 11. let's start in verse but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abazed and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted amen father we thank you for your word today thank you for this assemblage of people thank you for all of the worship and praise and the free just the free atmosphere that we feel lord to deliver your word now my whole heart and mind is open before you of course lord i have notes here aplenty but you know lord i would never disobey if you wanted to change my whole thought i'd absolutely follow it lord you know father that i have proven that over the years i will always follow you as long as i know it's you so father make it clear we're going to go forward because we believe we have your thought for for today lord i'm convinced of it in my heart and mine but of course you're always welcome to jump in lord and add or take away as you see fit it's your anointing that we'll be following i'm just your servant that's it i'm just your assistant so lord i give it to you in jesus name amen god bless your friends you can be seated now i'm going to need my powerpoint straight up guys and uh i'm going to turn on here and let me make sure i'll know if it's working if it brings up my subtitle amen let's give it a try what is the church of god part seven ah it's it's working amen so kingdom order in servanthood amen how many want to be a servant of the lord you know some friends i i i have so little to um you know there's very little good i can say about myself but one thing that i appreciate that the lord has always given me from the time i was just a small child very young i mean i can remember all the way back to services in uh in gastonia north carolina um at the tabernacle there what was the name of that sister mom that tabernacle what was the name of that gas tabernacle of gastonia i don't remember it might have been the tabernacle the tabernacle amen amen so uh i am either from the ohio state university or i'm from the tabernacle amen so praise the lord and uh just five years old i couldn't have been hey mom maybe five i remember in those services sitting there thank you sir uh no anthony bring me my regular water that's for afterwards thank you i remember sitting there as just a boy desiring thinking to myself i didn't want to grow up and be a fireman or a policeman or whatever or even the president i wanted to be a servant of the lord amen just from a child and and that never left me it never left me all through my young teenage life and i wasn't um the voracious reader then that i am now but uh thanks sir when i did read um i my my books and my heroes were great missionaries amen and i always just envision myself you know just carrying the gospel to the deepest darkest areas of the world amen and so i appreciate being today god's servant and if i'm his servant then i'm your servant and remember that our text was he that is greatest among you shall be your servant this is a thought that should be on the front of your mind constantly as a christian don't let the kingdom order in servanthood be something in the back of your mind that you you know it's just a nice thing we look at or we think about it we consider we talk about it no no this should be front and center in the mind of a christian jesus said that the son of man now is there anybody greater than the lord jesus come on is there anybody greater than the lord jesus no not everybody combined wouldn't be greater than him and he said of his own self and his ministry the son of man now catch it the son of man because what is the son of man what's the ministry of son of man word made flesh so you're in the ministry of the son of man amen because you're the word made flesh is that right how many like that he said i'm the ministry i operate the ministry the son of man i have allowed the word to live through my flesh remember as we said to you a previous time that the goal of this book is to do away with the need for this book that when this book is fully manifested this will live behind flesh amen and that's the ministry of the son of man it's different from the office office of son of man is a prophet but the ministry of son of man is the word a prophet brings living inside of you that's why you're the final voice to the final age that's that's why that in revelation 19 you read about that group that rides out with jesus remember that on white horses and the bible says i heard voices in heavens and thunderings remember that did you know that in the hebrew that the word thunder and the word voice in the hebrew the same hebrew word see because it it literally means that the word now is is and brother branham talks about the voice of many waters and thunderings and lightnings that that's that's god's family that thundering is the voice of god in the people amen so so we find then that brother branham then would tie revelation 19 back to revelation 17 14. that brother branham did that because it's a group of people that had three distinct characteristics about them they were they were called they were chosen and they were faithful amen now listen friends you might make all kinds of mistakes in life you may not do everything according to the way that god has desired how many of us have failed come on see but you know my my wife my wife to me i mean to me she's the most perfect woman alive but you know what there's been some time she overcooked my toast a little bit yeah it's true uh it's true there's been times where she left a little mark of an iron you know in one of my pairs of pants but yeah but you know yeah and yeah but you know i'm gonna move on quickly but but but you know here here's the point i want to make it's a glorious point that has nothing to do with her faithfulness her faithfulness is that she reserves her betting ground for my seat alone she will not open her bedding ground to the seat of any other man see and she she's found faithful to me and the and the bride of jesus christ at the end of all of her ups and downs all of her failures all of her mistakes she was still found faithful because she reserved her mind her heart her soul to the seed of god alone and and we can say like brother branham lord you know i never did commit adultery against your word as soon as i understood it by divine revelation i've stayed faithful to it all these years once you revealed yourself to me lord and you became my husband i never accepted the seed of another no denomination no man-made creed no ideology nothing of the devil or the antichrist i i am faithful to his word so we find then that whosoever so there's something to be said about being humble to be god's servant jesus said the son of man came not to be served your king james uses the word minister he came not to be ministered to but to minister he came not to be served but to serve amen now i came across this saying i have no idea who wrote it it wasn't titled i don't know who wrote it if you ever find the source i would appreciate knowing it i thought it was wonderful watch now kingdom order in servanthood i love these three bars here i slept and dreamt that life was joy i awoke and saw that life was service i served and behold service was joy i love that i just love that now i want to go to some quotes of brother branham and i'm just going to say that if these quotes of brother branham if it sounds like that i'm aiming these uh these quotes that preachers here that's only because i am okay so that that's the only reason it'll come across that way all right but but now it's it's also to anyone who serves the lord in any capacity but especially preachers all right so so so i mean you know when when when you don't uh you know when when you don't when you're not humble to the to the leadership of the lord then then this is exactly why you end up out of the line in order of his word amen see so the line and order of god's word is paramount anything outside of the line and order of god's word in your life that's why i've been preaching on kingdom order because anything outside of the line in order of god's word will fail it must fail i don't care however long it goes and it might look like solomon talks about sometimes that that men who are even outside of the order of god's word that they brought prosper and solomon said their branches go out like a bombay tree but by and by you mark it down by and by it'll wither see because that's not eternal anything that's not eternal has to have an end i'm not here to extend my life i'm here to have eternal life see so in order sometimes you you you have to go back to go forward that you that's the order of the bible always there you know that's it's things new and old because in order to you know this message is not new this message is a restore restoration of the of the former so it's new it's new it's not new in the sense that it's another gospel because you can't bring another gospel the foundation is already laid part elated and you can't add to or take away from the word that's already established but what it is is it must go back and pick up the old to go forward so you've got to go back to go forward amen that that that that's why the message come to us in this day because the alpha church did not go on to a body change see and and instead of christ being able to come and get his bride uh matt i'm going to move this back a little bit because i'm getting some wind noise and i that little sock that little sock comes off what are you saying okay am i not there okay perfect so we find that that you know they they didn't go into a rapture they they fell away after the apostles and it was predicted and you see it already starting that's why the apostles were saying you need to earnestly contend for the faith once delivered because it was already starting to wane and slip and and you find that that that that because they didn't and instead of christ being able to come i've said this before but instead of christ being able to come and rapture a bride and receive his bride we find out that he had to sit back down in the eternities and seal up the word with seven seals and and intercede for on behalf of the ignorance down through the ages so that he could redeem his bride out of every age amen and so you know the the first part of the church ages is really the messengers those angels that were stars in his right hand they're just basically trying to hold the line and uh they're they're they're in a situation where it's just slipping further and further and they're trying to earnestly contend for the faith once delivered but we find them that under the restoration about the time of martin luther now he's going to begin to restore the brag tree see and and the problem was that those messengers never had a exact clear knowledge of what the original was so they just all they could do is preach the revelation they had and that was enough amen but we find that the promise was in matthew 13 that that at the end time god would send his messengers who under their prophet with their prophet and under their prophet would be a final voice to the final age they would separate the good from the evil amen and and and they would the rest would be committed to the to the burning of a tribulation and and uh redeemed would be taken into the garner and so you you find this is a constant order of god's word this is you see these patterns friends i can't tell you today i i can't words would fail me to express how important it is that you know and be willing because you have to be willing he won't force you and be willing to observe the line and order of god's word in your marriage in your home in your finances in your church attendance in your tithing and offering this is the line in order of god's word i mean it's you know it's it it it's it's you know he and i just say this for the benefit of the young teenagers who are starting to come on and starting to work jobs don't forget that brother diggs was reminding you of that the other service make sure that you don't steal from god that would be all such a horrible thing that you end up stealing from god but it's not just that it's also your offerings your free will to god you see that really is an indicator of where your heart is toward god and what you think about the word going forth amen praise the lord all right so so so this line in order this is why when we look at the at the line in order of god's word for what's to perfect this bride now you've got a a movement of wonderful people who have changed the order to say that you just need to gather and and just push play pushing play is a wonderful thing you should do it every day of your life you should listen to a tape of god's prophet every day of your life listen to two or three of them if you can if you can squeeze it in it's just as important as your bible reading and your prayer time which should also dominate your schedule amen come on amen see and and so they espouse now that let's just gather in a building to put to push play and now that that's perfectly fine for there in jeffersonville that that's perfectly fine because at least they're obeying the bible they're assembling they're coming together see but but what the short-sightedness of that is is what about the the now countless number around the world of families who are not gathering they've left churches and they now sit at home and push play and and and now there's where the problem is because 99 of the people in the world can't gather there only that group can gather what about all the rest who now have forsaken shepherds and for and they don't come around and there's benefits to you coming in the church there's benefits to you rubbing shoulders with one another there's benefits for being one for all and all for one and having an all to be to be in prayer for when you when you when you stay away you violate god's word and now you're taking a very good thing push play you're taking a very good thing and you're turning it into something to a disadvantage you see beautiful wonderful people love them no know all of those leadership there i know a law grew up around them wonderful people not talking about that not that not that at all but you see when you go off the line in order of god's word and you stop gathering i mean where where's where's the shepherd to bear your needs before god in prayer where where's the people to pray for you and pray with you and and pray for your young people and and see the gospel preached into their lives amen see that's what they're not thinking about works fine for the one percent that can gather there but what about the rest of the world they're leaving churches see and i'm gonna hear i'm here to tell you you need to come here for growth you need to rub shoulders there's some people who really grow you and you need that amen uh who was it just singing i need you you need me we're all a part of god's army stand with me agree with me amen i love that song brother fred has made that song famous among the bride we love that song might get anthony to try to sing that when he comes back up but but you know this is why the line in order of god's word is so important this is exactly why paul said don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together see so that brings it outside of the line and order of god's word and then you you end up you end up by that decision hindering you you you listen here here's something they're not thinking about you know teenagers have to have their own experience they can't get in on mom and dad's experience they've got to know christ personally i was raised in this message from the day i was born as a baby sat in brother branham's meetings prayed for healed miraculously under william branham's prayer that's why i was so glad when that baptist theologian tried to challenge me on that he said i bet you don't know a single person ever healed under his prayer i said well actually i know one pretty good mwah you know and so um so his only excuse was oh all you know is what your mom and dad told you well i'm sorry maybe you didn't have an honorable mom and dad i did i do so i believe what they told me and so so so you know uh the the point comes down to how that you know until that teenager gets a gets a hold of their own experience a church family the interaction the assembling ourselves together helps hang on to them it keeps them close to the fire until god can get a hold of their life when you just sit them in a house and all you do is push a push play if they don't that you might be liking it because you've got the holy ghost but to them it's just the letter until it's until it's a experience of the lord and what will happen is they'll hit they'll hit that mid teenage years and you know what will happen they won't sit there and listen to push play anymore they'll head out to the world they'll enter and marry among unbelievers i've seen it happen you can't fool me i hadn't been doing this too long i've been pastoring too long i've seen the consequence of what happens to teenagers when mom and dad don't visit the house of god with their family on a regular discipline basis they say well teenagers leave the church too sure they do of course they do but at least they've got better odds if they're here i can pray for them i can befriend them i can bring my my friendship upon them as a as a weapon as an influence i do that's how i raise my boys my boys were young men and you you eventually you realize you can't just make every decision for the life i didn't even want to do that so i just made sure that i built a relationship with them and today i still have a measure of control through influence over my sons because they love me and they trust me and i've built a rapport with them and and and i can receive advice from them they can receive advice from me this is the line in order of god's word amen oh let me get to my preachers all right listen up your brothers now but remember it's everybody see don't pitchfork this you preachers better you you preach listening everybody because we're all servants of god a group of methodist brethren that just received the holy ghost brother branham saying here uh the holy spirit came to my church and where i used to pastor and they was great men lived up in indiana and they had said brother branham after we've received the holy ghost we've been reading some books said should we wait on the lord and seek the lord to tell us our ministry i said don't do it at all he said well the book said i said but wait a minute brother if you ever take men that's so zealous that they want to always be doing something god couldn't trust that person if you'll notice in the bible the man that god used was the man was trying to get away from all of it that's the one that god used take for instance paul moses and so forth trying to run from the very cause see now brother branham is not against zeal he's not against the desire to serve god i had a desire to be a servant since i was a child but it but but there's a fine line that that comes between you letting god put your your your gift forward and you trying to push it forward and boy have i learned that the hard way too many times i'm sorry to say all right if a man's god would give man to do a certain thing and he was so zealous of it the first thing you know he'd be so swelled out but if a man doesn't want to do such maybe god can use him for a while anyhow if you just can get something out of him but men that usually wants to go and blast over the world and tear it down usually god can't trust him because he he can't he wants to do it himself he gets into his own way with it if a man don't want to go then god almost has to drive him to it that's the type of man that god usually uses in the scripture amen i wanted to be a servant of god i wanted to be a missionary i didn't want to be a pastor i didn't i ran from that like crazy when they first asked me to do it i said no way i knew what come with that i wanted to be a missionary i wanted to be loose to make you know just to go around the world but but but then i but then when god put put me in this position and i and i've always i've always just had to be driven to it and one day sister debbie and i were writing i was preaching meetings in phoenix and i had this tape playing here you him and brother branham makes this statement you know the only kind of man that god can use you know uh is a man that don't want to go and then god almost has to drive him to it and he said that's the type of man that god usually uses in the scripture and i just pushed paul's and i said i said to sister debbie i said i'll never get out of this she said why i said because i don't want to do it so bad and since that's true he'll never let me out i'm apparently i'm the guy he can use so so all right so now watch so i said watch here's the instruction you just live for him and love him with all your heart he will place you in the place that he desires for you to be that's right why try to take another man's place see we can't do that we must always abide in our calling where god has called us to and that's beautiful all right that is so so wonderful all right let me make sure i want to just carry on here uh i do all right now let's look at some more 1959 questions and answers god has a hard time trying to get somebody that he can deal with that that'll stay humble and meek and stay in the place until god calls him to do something you believe that see a man that god can bless and heal keeps and and he'll still keep himself a man not be an angel or a god as soon as a man gets blessed and has a little something given to him he wants to become a god he wants to become an angel he wants to become some great person what i do what me me and mine all of that that's the wrong attitude god's hunting for somebody who he could bless and pour out blessings and more he blessed the littler the man will become and you'll never get more of god until you become nothing remember that brothers my fellow minister brothers and all of you you'll never everybody it's not it's not just ministers it's anybody holding any position and it's anybody in the church of christ i'm preaching on what is the church of god are you part of the church of god then you have a calling and you'll never get more of god until you become nothing you've got to belittle yourself he that will exalt himself god will bring a base he that will humble himself god will exalt you've got to get little before you can get big and you'll never be big in your own self you'll only be as big as god will be big in you see and so even if you get big you're not big because it's all god all right not beautiful you're good everybody good breathe just breathe it's okay all right let me let your blood get going again all right lean not to thy own understanding 1965 why you're in the best class that there is sons and daughters of god isn't that wonderful why would you want to be anything besides that see well i like that company better than i i would with all the i like that company better than i would with all the kings and poe takes and everything else give me that humble bunch of people if they don't know their right hand from their left as long as they know god and love him and serve him that's the celebrity of heaven let me tell you something friends when we stay humble like that when that's our attitude there just is no way for satan to ever cause divisions among us it's it's totally impossible because we're constantly humbling ourselves before god and each other see no big eyes and little you see humble ourselves all right next one i think this is my last one from humble thyself 1963 you know people want power and really they don't know what power is that's true see all right so he's not condemning them it's not what this quote's about this isn't here to make you feel bad he's not condemning them he's not even saying anything evil about them these people imagine themselves doing great things for god and that's a good thing that's a wonderful thing that's heavenworthy see so but but they're going about it all wrong they have a misunderstanding of what real power with god is just say nothing of how to operate it see to have to operate it in a way that brings glory to god alone alone alone that brings glory to god alone now another side of it friends is when you know another side of it is sometimes when an evil spirit can be trying to influence you with pride that's a remember i used that bad word here i had to apologize to the church i said i'm sorry mothers your little kids are here but i'm going to use a very bad word pride see and so so because you know the this that pride leads to rebellion and rebellions witchcraft see so sometimes that that the the that an evil spirit can work on on trying to get pride working in our mind thinking more highly of ourselves than is good yeah this is the bible am i in the bible see you know this you've been hearing these verses read i shouldn't have to go and read every last one of them to you but we but we remember this is always the wrong way you remember simon the sorcerer you know who he he wanted himself as as the great person remember that peter dealt with him pretty harshly see you remember diotrophies in the in the book of acts who wanted preeminence among the people and i and i i just i tell you when i get around to minister of the gospel like that and you can see that he wants preeminence and domination i run from that a thousand miles an hour i run away at light speed amen i'm i'm not interested in that at all ain't going to give any my time to that unless i can see a humility in the man that believes he's nothing and that god is everything amen and he's not there to run people's lives i'm not here to run your life the holy ghost is here to run your life he's the pastor of this church amen diotrophies you know he wanted preeminence he resisted the authority of the elders of the church and he even refused to be corrected by the apostle john himself see you remember the pharisees that jesus dealt with who he said love the praises of the people they love that praise and position among the people and i just say to you today run from it ministers servants people who hold offices the church of jesus christ run from that run with all your might run run run from that see don't go nowhere near that spirit don't you have nothing to do with that kind of spirit so now in our quote that we've got up here you know we want you to see that that is that this is not dealing so much you know with that it's not dealing so much with a person under an evil influence brother branham is dealing here in this quote especially if you go listen to it on tape you can hear the sincerity in his voice and he's dealing with good people who love the lord he's not dealing with diagraphies he's not dealing with simon or the pharisees you're not a pharisee are you see so this quote isn't for you then this quote if if you're a pharisee this quote isn't for you because brother branham doesn't need to correct that jesus already did james already did peter already did paul already did already told what what happened to people who do that see and so brother branham here jesus you know this is more brother branham and a heartfelt concern that brother branham has for god's true family now you've said you're you're the family of god and sometimes you know brother branham in trying to deal with this because he knows that that god's family have good motives in desiring the power of god we have a good motive in that we have a good objective we want to see the enemy defeated we want to see healing we want to see salvation we want to see the holy ghost amen amen see i want to see the power of god in our young people and our married couples and our seniors we want to see the power of god moving and see the devil defeated see and so brother branham now is recognizing this that that this is can be even among god's family and um you know i mean listen brother branham himself admits to liking compliments remember the guy you know and uh he tried to upgrade brother branham said oh you know that man that was complimenting you said you know you you was liking that too good and brother adam says now the only difference between me and you sir is i'm honest and you're not see the reason you're mad is because you want that and you don't get it and if you be honest you want it and see and so it bugs you that the man didn't say it about you brother ram said when you can't see your brother blessed of god that's a problem with you not with god not the brother see and so listen friends these are things i've seen over over 30 plus years of ministry and so so so so this is now brother branham here his heart here brother branham's heart is to try to help honest people who honestly just want to be used of god amen they're not pretentious they're they're just misguided on how to go about it all right now um yeah i know g thank you so so so he says here now let's let's carry on so they're they're they're not pretentious they don't have a bad motive they just want to serve god and that's great that's awesome but now brother branham says people want power in a good way really they don't know what power is watch see they don't really know what goes with it all right you with me the way up is down always always if you want power it's a good thing see how humble you can get just get away from how much of your worldly thinking all your worldly thinking now that's not just sinful that's your flesh anything of your flesh see thinking of yourself more highly than is good all right get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before god then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building makes a big bunch of noise see because i love this love this love this because you have been able to conquer yourself you've been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to christ you see to humble yourself before him that's really power amen now i want to say this humbling oneself is not something a human can accomplish all on his own there's a human involvement there's a responsibility of you to do your part of it but you should never try within yourself alone to accomplish it there has to be an acknowledgement of god's greatness above you see see what i mean so say oh i acknowledge god's greatness above me then why are you always running against god's timing god's position what god wants for your life and you're always still trying to put your own self forward and then and then when the people don't receive you like that then then you're offended see no one's done anything wrong to you they're just they're just being people and and and the problem is not in the people it's not in god it's in you see so so it takes a deep listen hear me hear me it takes a deep you teenagers especially you're young i'm trying to help you to not go down this road as you grow older i want to tell you my years of experience have taught me that it takes a deep and personal surrender that only the power of god can enable you to reach see so humbling yourself isn't just walking around speaking in low tones staring at your shoes dressed in a potato sack and deflecting all compliments that's not humility that's that's that's man-made nonsense see all right and so so so you find that what it takes is a deeper if you find yourself kicking against the pricks of god's will for your life you need a deeper walk with god see all right so that's what it means to be little in your own sight to hold a constant vision of him before you as david did that's how that's why david who committed some pretty bad infractions but god loved him because david stayed little in his own sight even though he became a king you know how david accomplished that he just constantly kept the word of god before him constantly kept the word in other words he constantly stayed in a relationship he kept short books with god that's the greatest advice i can ever give to preachers especially young preachers is keep short books don't don't make joshua's mistake remember joshua he had that great victory there and uh you know crossed the jordan the waters will stay they come in he met he met the the captain of the lord's host he sacked jericho remember that and then here comes ai little bitty city and joshua didn't go back and consult god he didn't keep short books he just assumed oh we can just do this you won't even need the whole army just take just take a few divisions and you'll crush them anyway and got 36 men when they weren't supposed to lose a man got 36 men killed see now if he'd have been running short books he'd have went back to god and god would have said before you can go there's sin in the camp and 36 daddies would still have been alive follow me keep short books brothers keep short books with the lord check in with him constantly don't assume don't assume just because you sacked that city behind you that this will even be done in the same way see and so so he he kept the lord always before him so think of the now listen friends david's life i mean if you just put yourself there for a minute because sometimes we can think about our trials and get feeling sorry for ourselves and and and think of the mental anguish that david must have felt hiding in caves who saw dogging his every move and and how his mind must have been in a world because on you know on on on one side he had the promise of god through god's prophet that he was going to be king see now you just imagine that's in his mind but here he is in a cave and saw dogging is every movement i'm going to tell you something satan loves to do our lives that way and god allows it to see our reaction brother branham said god will allow things to happen to you on purpose just to see your reaction see remember i said this last time you get mad go off the handle real easy oh i just got mad no you didn't that was a spirit of anger amen see that was a spirit of anger say oh you know i lusted that just i just come from my childhood come from my past come from my jeans no no no no that's a spirit brother branham said habits are spirits see so so we find we find then that here he is you know that that a prophet had told him a prophet of god who he had confidence in had told david that he would that he would stand and you know he'd live in a palace with a royal crown on his head and royal robes clothing his body and yet now here he is driven from a quiet life of service into the wilderness on the run pursued as a criminal and yet in all of that and all in all of that in what should be a place of total despair and bewilderment he kept his trust in god amen now here he is god had told him thus saith lord i'm going to use you in a great way and now here he is having to flee and and he actually ends up having to flee to go to the philistines and stands before bimelech and has to has to feign insanity think of the degrading that david had to stand there and froth at the mouth and act like a crazy man and talk out of his head he's one of the smartest men in the room and he had to stand there before these heathen men and obey and and humble himself in order to save his life but do you know that it was now you think think about how bewildering that would be you're going to be a king you're going to wear a crown you're going to have roy robes going to live in a palace and here he is feigning insanity in a foreign land to a foreign king and it's at that exact time that david picks up his pen under inspiration and says i will bless the lord at all times how many times all times his praise shall be continually in my mouth my soul this is while he just left abimelech and he's writing my soul shall make her boast in the lord the humble shall hear thereof and be glad here was a man in a in a worse case than any of us have ever had and he says she's going to be glad she's going to humble herself and be glad oh magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears he didn't look very delivered but this is where his faith is see i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked upon him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles oh that's my life friends this poor man cried and the lord saved me out of all my troubles he finally does realize the throne say okay trouble's over he finally does realize the throne only then to allow the greatest failure of his life and in that he loses the he suffers the loss of his newborn child he ends up later deposed by his own son absalom who he loved you know ends up losing absalom in battle as as absalom tried to take the throne that god had given to david he comes to the end of his life now watch this i i think the lord led me into here and i'm going to finish up with david i want to talk a little bit about joseph i think the lord led me here because it's it's instructive to us lest we you know unless somebody licks your candy and you don't like it and and you just go you just go in into darkness and sit in doldrums and i just want to say to you what happened to you i don't care what you say it ain't going to compare to this it ain't going to compare to this and here's the psalm this brother wrote see so uh here he has uh he suffers the loss of a newborn child the sword never really leaves his house but he comes to the end of his life and now here at the end of his life he's laying on his deathbed you'd think surely the lord was let the man die in peace for goodness sake he's laying on his death bed only to have another son try to take the throne by a political coup and david literally has to come off of his death bed and secure solomon as the king according to his pledge that he made the bathsheba see and yet at that time in what most scholars believe a psalm to be written at the end of his life he pens what we know as the eighth psalm give me that eighth psalm g psalms eight these first five verses psalms eight one to five now catch it this is what he's writing he comes off his deathbed he can't even die in peace and he writes something like this oh lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth amen this is a man who has suffered immeasurably but that's his attitude see in all the earth who has set thy glory above the heavens verse 2 out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast ordained strength because of thine enemies that thou mightest steal the enemy and the avenger when i consider the heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained what is man thou art mindful of him you're so great god why are you paying attention to me and the son of man that thou visites him for thou has made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with glory and honor now this is david's idea about god because one thing that you need to understand friends is when you look there in verse 3 gideon put that back verse 3 when i consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers so it was it was literally as easy for god to create the heavens as it is for a human being to make something with his fingers rather than needing to use his arm just something you can just do with your little fingers that's all it was to god to make all the heavens and all the galaxies and all the universes it was just a little finger of god on the move see and so this is why that in contrast to god the heavens are tiny and they're they're the the commentators say they're so tiny that they were pushed and prodded into shape just by his divine digits see now that's how great he is that's how powerful he is that's how much that's how much higher he is than you and i see and so if we if you know think of the heavens then how that god has created with just his fingers if we really dwelt i'm going to tell you something friends if you really dwell on the vision of his greatness the vision of his mightiness then i'm here to tell you you would never fail to have faith no matter what the crisis that satan brought your way all you got to do is consider him stop looking at your dilemma look at him see see we'd see him as isaiah did you'd see the lord high and lifted up watching to see our reaction ready to move on behalf of his promises to us so it depends on what you're looking at see i can promise you the devil won't want you to look toward the heavens he won't want you to think about the majesty of god he'll want you to think about your own narrow little self and what happened to you see and that if he can get you there then he's got you defeated you'll you'll you'll never be able to serve god see because god can't even trust you he can't even trust you see man it can't control his own spirit god can't even trust him see watch so we love god amen amen amen amen see sometimes you know we're we're we're you you've got to look at god you've got to look away as brother branham said look away to jesus because you can look at your problem or you can look at what at david's god that's really your choices you can look at your problem your circumstance or you can look at david's god what's your choice today see sometimes we are found in his presence not worshiping as we should or not joyous as we should be now i'm gonna i'm gonna give you some help here because boy did this ever help me i'm gonna i'm gonna give you another side of it you ready all right we love god don't we we believe his word amen yeah we got problems i got a ton of them we got ups and downs constantly ins and outs on and off faith and fear word amen me guilty guilty see and so you know but we love god sometimes in this mad world we can find ourselves sitting unable to stand broken looking to the heavens and crying because the last thing i want to present in this sermon is to present you with the idea that no one should ever be sad or that no one should ever feel depressed i must not be a christian because i feel sad i feel depressed i i whereas my faith is weak my joy is gone i must not be a christian that's that's just what the devil would want you to believe see sometimes our wounds can be so great friends now listen sometimes your fellow brothers and sisters their wounds their their afflictions can be so great and they they can find themselves just as you can find yourself just as i can find myself and have unable to stand broken looking to the heavens and crying where is my joy of the lord come on all you holy people is that right where has all my strength gone sometimes we can see other people in this kind of shape and think oh it's just pride it's stubbornness before god but it may not be that at all amen see the lord help me to think about it in this way because a lot of times what you see you can be affected by it and you you see someone with a certain attitude and you just then your reaction is worse than theirs see and the lord the lord came to me at one of those 5 30 in the morning with me sitting in my chair in my living room in the darkness you hear me tell that a lot so it's how i start every day and the lord said okay let me change the picture i'm just going to flip the picture on you and i said okay lord what's the picture and the lord said what if a person came into church in a wheelchair they were paraplegic and they came in and the whole church was standing to their feet and praises to god and they couldn't stand would you feel animosity disdain would you feel contempt no you wouldn't you know what you'd do you'd feel compassion you'd feel empathy you'd you'd want you'd pray you'd want to pray oh god heal that sister heal that brother this is was the success of william branham this is why he was so successful that he had a love for god and god's family and he was determined he was the enemy of satan see and and the lord said let's go a little further and i was already crying and and the lord said what if they come in and they're not a they're not a paraplegic they're a quadriplegic they can't stand they can't even raise their hands and here you're saying raise up your hand stand your feet and praise the lord what if they're a deaf mute and they can't praise the lord they can't stand they're on a machine that's just breathing for them yeah or oh but they're in the house of god they come to hear the word because they're a christian amen amen listen brothers what we should have brothers and sisters don't let the enemy change your thinking we should have compassion for one another we should have faith for one another we should pray for one another hallelujah because sometimes the affliction or the wound or the damage it might not be in their flesh it might be in their spirit and it's unseen you can't see the wound you can't see the crippled condition but it's there and it's just as real as the flesh i tell you that's the time when we need to pray and say god help my brother help my sister and help me hallelujah we wouldn't judge them we'd have compassion we'd see broken condition and our hearts would go out to them what if it was a sinner what if it was an unbeliever who's trapped in the disease of sin and wants to be free and isn't free and they come into the house of god i understand we've got to have church order i understand we can't let people be indecent i understand we've had to send women home before ask them to cover up because they're indecent we'll always do that but i'm not talking about that i'm talking about where's our attitude what about our teenagers who don't have the holy ghost yet what about they're still struggling what about marriages and god needs to do something in there we should be praying we should be loving we should be caring we should have compassion this is a hospital that's kingdom order that's when you're a servant of god see see what if the affliction is something you can't see buried way down in the human spirit they need healing of a deep wound or some great loss where's our compassion then where's our burden of prayer see where's the desire to encourage their faith to accept god's healing you might be dealing with a child of god one for whom christ died a child that god wants free from sickness this is not a pharisee this isn't diotrophies this isn't this this isn't simon the sorcerer this is god's family that's the line in order of god's word this is what makes us servants my you know the sinner we should have a brother branham even talks about the prostitute on the street he said how do you know but she might just need a handshake and an invitation to church see makes people uncomfortable when you start reminding them of quotes like that what about mary magdalene seven devils on that girl amen what about the woman washing his feet and jesus said to her i say he said it publicly he didn't hide it she didn't get offended because he said it he said i say to you that her sins which are many are forgiven her they're all forgiving her i just want him to say that about me jason your sins which are many they're all forgiving you thank you lord thank you lord hallelujah your presence is my greatest gift of all oh my oh see the the bible actually when it when it says there he made him a little lower than the angels it actually says in in the in the hebrew text if you read it from the hebrew text it's saying you have made him uh you have made him to lack little of god see because remember you're built in the image of god and you lack very little from being god god made you in his own image and gave you a soul see and so think of how vulnerable that you are being created at this level but born in sin you see that i'll say it again think of how vulnerable the devil knows you are born at this lofty level but born in sin see i think it was brother uh matthew that preached uh about how that you know a man without the holy ghost he's just a brood he's just an animal he's one of the most dangerous enemies of the cross there is because he's built in the image of god but yet a man who's born again of the spirit of god is the greatest asset in the hand of god see and so so you got to know that the devil will surely capitalize on this reality you you need to know that and take steps to prevent his movement in and out of your life this is where you're humbling yourself humbling yourself isn't just a mental gymnastic humbling yourself is eliminating out of your life anything that would hinder the movement of god in your life that's humbling yourself see and you know this is why that we see god moving in this way now i want to take my last 10 minutes i want to come to joseph you got 10 minutes you know your love and all your loyalty should be to the lord god of heavens and earth at all times you know joseph from a very young man now you young men especially you senior youth young men you pay close attention to this joseph decided from a very early age that his life should be loyal to jehovah above all else and he did not attach joseph did not attach his hope of life merely to other human beings above god he never did that see humans will disappoint you amen no matter who they are amen intentionally or unintentionally see they are fraught with errors and weakness and the the human most likely to disappoint you will be yes you the human most likely to disappoint you the one that stares back at you when you stand in front of the mirror and unless you can see and acknowledge from the deepest realms of your soul that that guy in the mirror is filled with weakness and errors failure and constant disappointment await you unless you can see that god for who he really is failure and constant disappointment await you see joseph and then it'll it'll it'll follow you all of your life friends it'll follow you you know unless you can acknowledge unless you can acknowledge that you need god unless you can allow permit because he won't force himself unless you can allow the holy ghost now the holy spirit to keep you humble and and and keep you little in your own sight then that man in the mirror will torment you throughout your entire life you'll never be free of the ups and downs that he will cause you joseph even when his own blood brothers even when his own blood father and his own blood mother scorned him he never allowed it to darken his heart toward them amen he never stopped magnifying god before all men he never stopped doing that he never became bitter i'm leaping over his whole life i'm not going to deal in the in the trenches with it but you know the story you've read it from sunday school he was cast into prison on a false charge from potiphar's wife he never became bitter never even toward his fellow prisoners who disappointed him let him down broke their word to him abandon him leaving him you know uh in into rot in prison he never allowed his heart to darken even towards the egyptians that evilly mistreated him you know you see all the time that men who get treated wrong and then they come into political power then they go on a revenge track and get all their enemies joseph never did that these people lied on him put him in prison and it was their own ungodliness he never when he became the right-hand man to pharaoh he never went on a political revenge hunt when he came into power he and he never ever blamed god for any of his undeserved misfortunes like job of old he did everything right conducted himself correctly before men yet everything in his world turned out wrong his heart joseph's heart stayed perfect toward god toward his family toward his enemies see when he when he when he was reunited with his brethren it was genuine tears of joy even thinking what they had did to him he's standing there weeping when they know it's him he already knows it's them when they know it's him they think we're dead joseph's like no he's already been thinking about this this wasn't something he tried to push out of his mind i gotta i gotta stop thinking about what i did to me i'm gonna execute him i'm second man to pharaoh no he actually thought about what they did and he said this was god's doing he did it to preserve life i'm joseph your brother oh my what did he do friends he knew it was all the love of god and he saw the grander purpose he continually humbled himself to it at every point in his sad life his words to his brothers god did it see it was a revelation it was a revelation to joseph i'm here to tell you that that revelation it had to be an unfolding comfort over time that no matter i don't i don't think that joseph is standing there and he's been thinking about i'm gonna get him and suddenly he gets a revelation oh god you did that for good oh never mind i'm not gonna kill you i think joseph all through his torment was going this is the hand of god this is the hand of god i will glorify god i will not let my heart i will not let my mind become darkened see now no mortal can accomplish this on their own this was only possible by as a young man joseph made a decision to direct his whole heart to the love of god above all other things see and that kept his heart clean it kept his spirit pure and it kept his faith strong when all around him even his closest family and friends failed and stumbled in their human weakness joseph remained victorious and conquered himself so that he could remain and to god amen let me come to the end here i've got more than i can cover and i need to stop this is why the psalms are so good for use in teaching on human emotions and human affairs of life they offer such sure guidance sometimes we can get in a in a set of very confusing circumstances and the psalms david psalms you know david you know what david you know another thing david psalms do they they show his ups and downs like we all have amen amen yet they also show his ability to abide in his deep relationship with god no matter what was happening in his life what they show is the difference between complaining about god like israel did in the wilderness and pouring out your heart to god in total honesty because this pouring out of your heart i want to read a statement for a scripture because this pouring out of your heart may include your pain your fears your frustrations real or imagined doesn't matter whether it's imagined perception is reality to the person see and so the pouring out of your heart may include your pain your fears your frustrations but because listen don't feel bad because even jesus who in the days of his flesh hebrews 5 7 even jesus who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared so don't let the devil beat you up over that see even jesus himself but in the pouring out to god in prayer about our circumstances we still uh we we must still be willing to worship him and acknowledge his goodness acknowledge his goodness i've seen some people who blame god tragedies in their childhood tragedies in their life and you can see that they're angry at god it's never been god trying to hurt you that's the devil trying to do that it's been god trying to help you it's been god trying to save you all of this time see see we never find fault in god or his plan for our growth however painful however fearful however frustrating it may seem he is still in control [Applause] hallelujah now i want to give you this closing this closing thought i made this and i said it in a different way last time i want to say it again but in a different way your situation according to the scriptures your situation will endure don't bother asking me to pray you out of it it'll keep going until you accept his plan for you you'll never know peace as a son of god until you can accept his plan from you you know you either need to accept his plan or or maybe you have a needed adjustment i don't know maybe there's a needed adjustment that that that lays within the lesson that he's trying to teach you you know he he's trying to help you that's my message today for those who want to be a servant it ain't always going to be a bed of roses you're going to come up into chaotic and a lot of times not understand why does it have to go this way just remember he's trying to help you he's trying to grow you past your weaknesses in your flesh weaknesses in your mind weaknesses in your spirit he's leading you to believe him for all things amen see now i'll just i'll just close by saying this here's where i've had me here has been where i brother jason have have had to spend the greatest amount of time on the potter's wheel my whole life see because i uh you know it is is as you say what what's been your greatest need trusting him for things that i can't do is never a problem for me when i can't do it see but but always trying to take control when it's something i'm good at or something i can do see and and and i want to accomplish accomplish something that doesn't fit the direction that he has planned out for me you preachers remember that one i'm just telling you as a seasoned veteran i i preached out here at phoenix at a minister's meeting and they had two preachers in the morning they were going to use an elder minister and a younger minister and they said brother jason you're going first and i said when did i become an elder and i said i i still feel like a kid oh no brother jason i'm like okay well i guess i'm i got seven grandkids i guess that makes me elder i don't know when i became elder but i did so listen to your elder i'm telling you from experience through real transparency that's where i've gotten in trouble more than a few times see i've had to learn this the hard way too many times so you know what i do i humble myself much quicker than i used to i learn fast these days i make my vows to god not to lean on the arm of flesh and especially definitely not mine but to put my trust in him alone let's stand come brother anthony bring your team back this is what i have learned friends and this is what it means to me this is what it means to have kingdom order

to be your servant now i've learned today i've looked at the life of david i looked at the life of joseph we read numerous quotes of of brother branham we've looked at many scriptures and writings of paul and psalms from david and lord we see that i i think that today there'd be no way that that any real believer could say i haven't made my case in the word of god today i think that i have made a sound open and shut case that there is a way to go forward to be a servant of god and there is a way to go incorrectly trying to be a servant of god so i thank you for these people i thank you for our
