even important can i just do what i want and it will just work out [Music] am i dreaming man i gotta stop eating takis before bed i guess i'll just watch the show what am i supposed to do that ria boma is trying to overthrow me i know it oh great king jeroboam how may we advise you tell us your quandary as you know it is about the time for all of israel to go to jerusalem to give the burner office to the lord what happens when the people give their burnt offerings and their hearts to return to the lord what happens when they decide they want a bumbling idiot rehoboam how horrible your majesty that could never happen surely your people would stay loyal to you and what if they aren't we could lose everything they could have be killed no we must find a way to make the people stay here i have the perfect solution highness first we find their weakness then manipulate them it's quite easy your majesty do not listen to him he has impure motives me sire i feel attacked weakness sire what's the one thing that the people want to be like everyone else that's why we have a king in the first place what's the one thing that'll make them that made them stop worshiping jehovah when they hit the red sea listen king i am begging you do not listen to him his impure motives he is an evil counsel are you forgetting that god chose me to be king so i will do exactly as i see fit and i see fit to keep a watchful eye over all of jerusalem that's it i have a completely original idea that i came up with [Music] calling all israelites inhabitants of samaria come to the palace at once by royal decree people of israel listen to me the journey is far too long and dangerous this year to take behold thy gods which brought you out of egypt now you can worship at home like the neighboring countries behold these high places the priests and mainly i have built for you yes i am amazing yes i am spectacular thank you um king a man of god from jude is here to speak with you what do you want oh altar thou art unholy and a sinful snare unto the people of israel thus saith the lord a child shall be born to the house of david josiah by name and upon you shall he offer these priests of the high places that burn incense upon you he will shatter you and destroy these high places and the people of israel that will become oppressed they'll be conquered and they'll become a scattered people among the nations because they have worshiped idols jeroboam had no way of knowing the severity of the transgressions he had made and that every word the prophet spoke would come to pass he did not know that 300 years of sin and misery would come to pass before josiah would come or that israel would live in drought famine and servitude again and again and again because of his decision he did not know that his lineage would become gruesomely cut off and he would forever be known as jeroboam the son of nabat who made israel to sin and so began the 300-year trial of israel's battle with idolatry many kings came and went after jeroboam in israel likewise the kings of the house of david also arose and fell after rehoboam and judah the line of the kings in judah are as follows alrighty folks thanks for coming out tonight let's give a big welcome for the kings of judah first up we have king abijah son of rehoboam he defeated king jeroboam in battle and did that which was right in the side of the lord he reigned three years before he died [Music] next up king asa he did that which was right in the sight of the lord he reigned 41 years even though his heart was perfect with god the high places in israel were not removed [Music] coming in at third we have jehoshaphat he walked in the ways of his father david and sought not after balaam the lord god was with him let's give it up for jehoshaphat [Applause] meanwhile in israel king ahab and his wife jezebel rose to power they were all too happy about the high places on their side of the country well i'm so relieved to be over here in sumeria where we have these wonderful high places i look back in judah the ridiculous king david fan club lucifer is that you how are you i can't complain how about you i'm just doing horrible this poor little prophet man from the desert has been ruining our lives is that right ahab oh yeah he killed all of my priest and i just hate him ahab here is taking me out to buy some new lipstick to comfort me isn't that right ahab ah i'll come with you guys we'll figure out how to deal with this weird prophet guy what's his name again elijah he's nothing new okay back in judah jehoshaphat reigned for 25 years before dying of natural causes king jehoram son of jehoshaphat known for slaying all of his brethren and the princes of israel with a sword he walked in the ways of evil king ahab that's right after marrying king ahab's daughter johoram more like jehorable built high places in the mountains of judah he reigned eight years before dying of a supernatural stomach flu [Music] jezebel's grandson his mother athelia taught him the wicked ways of her family he did that which was evil he reigned one year before being killed by jehu who was instructed by god to destroy the house of ahab athelia jezebel's evil daughter massacred the members of the royal house of judah in an attempt to kill her own grandson referred to in the scripture as that wicked woman she also dismantled the house of god in devotion to belle she reigned for six years before being killed by soldiers loyal to her grandson joash her butter her body being trampled by horses king joash great grandson to ahab and jezebel had every reason to do wickedly toward jehovah but the high priest jehoiada who had him hid away from the murderous grandmother taught the boy king to serve god joash took the throne at only 7 years old he reigned for 41 years before being murdered by his own men [Applause] amaziah joe ash's son reigned for 29 years over judah he did that which was right in the sight of god at first he later backslid and his own men killed him just like his father usayah aka azariah began his reign at only 16 years old he reigned for 42 years and did that which was right in the sign of god and until the day he got a little too big for his britches and was smitten with a terrible case of leprosy jotham reigned for 16 years that was a mighty king because he did that which was right in the sign of god he died of natural causes [Music] he has he also reigned for 16 years in jerusalem and he did evil [Applause] he chose the ways of the kings of israel and worship bill he died of natural causes hezekiah reigned over judah 29 years he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all his father david hezekiah became deathly ill and almost died but prayed to the lord and was granted 10 more years before dying later of natural causes manasseh he was 12 years old when he first sat on the throne he reigned 41 years he did that which was evil in the sight of god yes he loved witchcraft and provoked the lord to wrath even sacrificing his own children in fire but then he was later captured and tortured by the king of assyria he called on god who delivered him back to his throne in jerusalem and manasseh served the lord from that day forward he died of old age king ammon reigned for two years in jerusalem he did that which was evil in the sight of god he trespassed even more than his father manasseh his servants conspired against him and slew him in his own home and now the moment you've all been waiting for he's eight years old and he's ready to serve jehovah josh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so you see a king godzilla shall cover those who do not obey his laws and do evil in his sight are we still going on about those idols guys come on the people need these they're getting tired of worshiping some invisible force plus you're gonna start losing popularity if you start changing things now i care not what others think of me only god's opinion matters we we must serve the lord to the best of our ability regardless of what other wicked men do what i will fit in with other servants of jehovah remember what our ancestor king david said the lord will bless the righteous and compass us with a shield bethel kaya i worry that judah is doomed we have broken god's law many times guys guys guys you're taking this way too seriously besides those high places they're classics no one gets hurt well minus the kids that got up sacrificed but still they were more than willing to get sacrifice probably oh king do not listen to this evil one he cares not for the ways of the lord hey look i'm just trying to help doesn't god know your heart and all that good stuff besides these old laws really confusing i've heard the word abomination like 10 times not 9 10 in like the last hour god's law protects us from blasphemers like you life is still isn't supposed to be this hard did god just slave save us from the egyptians just to be enslaved by the words of puffed up prophets it was a prophet that spoke of this very king his prophets are vindicated by his word and he changeth not oh you are so arrogant do you really think that you're the only one that has a right and everyone else has it wrong yes i refuse to give ear to this slander kid they behind me lucifer bring me my royal clubs and just as prophecy foretold when josiah was only 20 years old he began what other kings in judah had failed to do he tore down the high places built by evil kings in judah and then finally he destroyed high places throughout all israel established by jeroboam the son of nabat who made israel to sin i make my choice now to give to serve the lord that the one true god of israel and i shall not rest until this land is purged of idolatry [Applause] and when he had broken down the altars and the groves and he had beaten the graven images to dust the people worshiped the one true god [Applause] jeremiah the prophet god said before you is even formed in your mother's womb i knew you and sanctified you and ordained you a prophet over the nations is that right before he ever come to this mother's womb [Music] but he got mixed up in the wrong group that's where many a young man and young woman loses out getting mixed up in the wrong group one night they've taken him out give him a drink oh play a little game or do this or gamble a little it won't hurt that's the first several entities we know coming of the lord is at hand and the bible said in the last days that the devil would go about like a roaring lion he's going about to seek whom he may devour he don't care who you are he's going after our little kids he's going after the middle age going after the old people seeking whom he may devour oh we're gonna watch out we gotta watch out find out who you're fighting against we're not fighting against our brother and sister we've got a real enemy tonight it's the devil [Music] we if we're not careful we somehow believe that the presence of trial or the presence of difficulty or the presence of a storm means the absence of god but actually it's the opposite the presence of trouble and struggle and storm is the evidence that god is there paul says to timothy just because you're enduring hardness and suffering and great difficulty don't buy into the idea that the presence of the storm means the absence of god know that your trials and your struggles and your tests are proof that you're a child of god you're a son of god you're a daughter of the king and god's challenging you to mature you and to grow you but you have the opportunity if you'd like it if you want it i can't force you to take it god won't force you to take it but he offers you an opportunity today to be free of the bondage of your fallen flesh and live righteously live holy wake up smelling the the air of cleanness be able to lay your head on your pillow at night and be content i'm offering you the joy of the lord i'm offering you the the oil of gladness and god gives you your choice choose you this day who you shall serve in the garden of eden there was a tree of of knowledge and a tree of life man was given the privilege to choose either one he desired and so is it today you're giving your privilege as free moral agents to choose whatever you want to choose my advice to you is don't look at the modern things around you and the popularity and the glamour that you could be but choose rather by faith him that give the promise that someday he will come and will right in all wrongs and will give you eternal life and raise you up no matter if you take this spies way with the large few make that choice [Applause] [Music] mom dad yes good morning i'm so sorry about last night i think i'd like to go to camp now that's great i knew you'd make the right choice that's a wise choice son maybe you've found yourself in a similar situation have you allowed satan's high places to tower in your life do you wonder why you're here god has known and loved you from before the foundations of the world just as he told the boy prophet jeremiah before i formed you in the womb i knew you he knew what choices you make and he knew you would find yourself here don't pass up your chance at revival choose the side of the lord tear down the high places in your life take a stand for god today [Applause] [Music] [Music] you
