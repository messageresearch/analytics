[41:04] people amen so if it gets past me
[41:07] believe me my people will let me
[41:09] know um I want to take a title
[41:14] today precious in thy sight amen and uh
[41:19] I actually preached Wednesday night for
[41:23] brother blue boy we had a fantastic time
[41:27] amen and uh just love the Lord so sister
[41:31] uh sister Sharon actually showed up
[41:32] there her and sister Grace and dropped
[41:34] in on the service and I was so glad to
[41:36] see them I told sister Sharon she might
[41:38] have to hear the sermon twice but
[41:40] actually it's going to be a different
[41:41] approach today which I I wondered if it
[41:44] would be so some of the same material
[41:47] but angled a little different the Lord
[41:49] does it like that you know I I got I got
[41:52] stuff I preached in Arizona I haven't
[41:54] preached here yet we'll get around to it
[41:57] but but I want to take this sermon
[41:59] precious in thy sight and I want you to
[42:03] really quickly get on board because I'm
[42:06] going to use um I'm going to minister a
[42:09] lot by contrast and so you know
[42:12] comparative that's a lot of times you
[42:14] can if you can't get it when somebody
[42:16] explains it then they show you the
[42:18] contrast you go oh okay now oh I see why
[42:21] you said okay now it makes sense so I'm
[42:24] going to kind of use a little bit of
[42:26] contrast tonight
[42:27] this morning and so I want now to if you
[42:31] will turn with me to Philippians chapter
[42:35] 1 and we're going to have a lengthy
[42:37] reading I'm going to leave you
[42:39] seated so in Philippians 1 and we want
[42:43] to begin with verse one and we're going
[42:44] to read down through verse 21 now this
[42:49] is this is a beautiful book you know my
[42:53] Paul's letters to Galatians and
[42:55] Ephesians and Philippians these were
[42:58] these were such beautiful letters and uh
[43:01] there's a lot I could say about that I
[43:02] don't want to uh you know you you that I
[43:06] could say about all those books they
[43:07] have deep meaning to them but uh the
[43:10] book of Philippians if Colossians is the
[43:13] book of Christ because it talks so much
[43:15] about Jesus the express image of his
[43:18] person the express image of God and the
[43:21] the book of Philippians is certainly a
[43:23] letter to the bride and in fact is it's
[43:26] a really really the only church that
[43:28] Paul never really had to correct and so
[43:30] uh they they really were a beacon of
[43:33] righteousness and Holiness uh Philippi
[43:36] was located in Macedonia not on the uh
[43:40] water but near
[43:42] it so Philippians chapter 1 and verse
[43:46] one Paul and Timothy the Servants of
[43:49] Jesus Christ to all the saints in Christ
[43:53] um Let me let me start from my own Bible
[43:55] Paul and timotheus the Servants of Jesus
[43:58] Christ to all the saints in Christ Jesus
[44:01] which are Philippi with the Bishops and
[44:03] deacons Grace be unto you and peace from
[44:06] God our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[44:09] Christ I thank my God upon every
[44:12] Rememberance of you always in every
[44:16] prayer of mine for you all making
[44:18] request with joy for your fellowship in
[44:21] the gospel from the first day until now
[44:24] being confident of this very thing
[44:27] that he which hath begun a good work in
[44:30] you has he begun a good work in you well
[44:32] here's some here's some good news in a
[44:34] Troublesome world he that hath which
[44:37] hath begun a good work in you will
[44:40] perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
[44:46] so that's good
[44:48] and
[44:50] Troublesome because it means that if
[44:52] you're not cooperating he's going to
[44:55] keep doing it and you know he would like
[44:58] for you every parent you know uh
[45:01] sweetheart put that down that don't
[45:03] touch that but if that doesn't work
[45:06] other measures are
[45:08] required amen all right enough said all
[45:13] right verse seven even as it is meat for
[45:17] me to think this of you all because I
[45:20] have you in my heart boy do I know how
[45:23] that feels in as much as both in my
[45:26] bonds and in the the defense and
[45:27] confirmation of the Gospel ye all are
[45:31] partakers of my grace so that's a
[45:34] scripture that undergirds my constant
[45:38] statement to you we're all in this thing
[45:42] together amen and I I just hope that you
[45:46] understand my heart and my soul when I'm
[45:48] preaching as I look out over this
[45:51] audience this morning and this might not
[45:53] always be true but it happens to be true
[45:55] today I don't see a human being in here
[45:59] that I don't have full faith and
[46:01] confidence you're Sons and Daughters of
[46:03] God and will be with me in glory amen so
[46:06] no matter what I say in this sermon
[46:08] don't lose sight of what I think about
[46:10] you is that a deal now I need to hear
[46:13] you say it is that a deal amen all
[46:17] right amen sister Anna good to see you
[46:19] today praise the Lord all right let's
[46:22] carry
[46:24] on for God is is my record how greatly I
[46:28] long after you all in the bows of Jesus
[46:31] Christ and this I pray that your love
[46:34] may abound yet more and more uh Now
[46:39] Catch what he wants it to abound in in
[46:41] knowledge and in all judgment so it's it
[46:44] you wouldn't necessarily think of love
[46:47] as knowledge and judgment but that's
[46:49] because we think of human love the old
[46:51] fuzzy feeling that fuzzy warm feeling we
[46:54] call love that's just a human sensation
[46:58] of of of felo that's not Agape Agape
[47:02] Love Is the Love of God that is a that
[47:05] is his person remember God doesn't have
[47:07] love he is love and that that life or
[47:10] that love or that life is poured into
[47:13] our hearts by the Holy Ghost so you have
[47:16] that's why I said to you last Sunday
[47:17] there's a big difference between between
[47:20] loving God and having the love of God
[47:23] see you there you and I made that
[47:25] comment we I don't at all think that now
[47:28] I know there's a a hypocritical church
[47:31] that comes up at the Judgment bar and
[47:32] Jesus says there the king says they're
[47:34] all workers of iniquity I get that I'm
[47:36] not talking about that today I'm not
[47:38] preaching to that group today I don't
[47:39] believe any of those are here today uh
[47:42] but but but but just just and that's why
[47:45] I say you know I do see evangelicals and
[47:50] charismatics and Pentecostals and I see
[47:52] Catholics and I see methodists and
[47:54] Baptists who really do love the Lord
[47:58] they really do that's not fake that's
[48:00] not part of that necessarily that
[48:03] iniquity crowd God to be the judge of
[48:05] that thank the Lord but but but just
[48:09] remember yes they have a love for God
[48:11] but that's still not the same as having
[48:14] the love of God having the love of God
[48:17] is the new birth and that places you in
[48:20] the first resurrection and you go in the
[48:23] Rapture is that clear having just a love
[48:27] for God the unwise Virgin have a true
[48:30] love for God but they never get the oil
[48:34] they're not born again they actually are
[48:36] safe from destruction but they don't
[48:39] have the love of God they don't have the
[48:42] token so so I I I I I I'm going to be
[48:47] glad for all of those that make it and
[48:49] I'm sure some are going to make it that
[48:51] I didn't wasn't sure they were going to
[48:53] make it but I'm not preaching to that
[48:55] crowd today I believe I'm preaching to
[48:59] Believers as I look out over this
[49:01] audience today I don't see anyone that I
[49:04] would not firmly in the presence of the
[49:06] Holy Angels say I believe that person is
[49:09] going to be with me in
[49:10] heaven amen see why do you keep coming
[49:14] to hear the word because you're lovers
[49:16] of the word all right so all right let's
[49:20] carry
[49:21] on so so this I pray that you're not the
[49:26] fuzzy human
[49:28] thing May abound amen yet more and
[49:33] more you want my fuzzy my fuzzy feeling
[49:36] to abound more no I want the love of God
[49:41] to abound how do I know it's abounding
[49:43] you'll get a knowledge of the word
[49:45] you'll get an understanding of his
[49:47] nature you'll you'll follow along his
[49:50] character and his
[49:52] example because you can say
[49:55] anything
[49:57] see you can say anything word words are
[50:00] cheap uh but but it's but brother
[50:03] brandham said live me a sermon all right
[50:07] that's the one that God looks at it's
[50:09] the it's that heart reaction to the word
[50:11] of God I can tell you that much it's the
[50:14] heart reaction to the word in whatever
[50:16] form it came that's what gives the
[50:18] foolish virgin eternal life even though
[50:19] they arrive at the at the bar without
[50:21] eternal life am they're granted it
[50:24] because the king can see in their heart
[50:27] and they and he talks about works and
[50:29] they don't even remember doing them
[50:30] they're like well I mean I'm glad I did
[50:32] it but truth is sir I don't really
[50:34] remember doing it but see it was their
[50:37] heart's response to the word the the
[50:40] iniquitous crowd had all kinds of works
[50:42] and they were all
[50:44] invalid none of them counted the king
[50:47] the the king would not count it in their
[50:49] favor because he was looking at their
[50:51] heart see and it was full of iniquity
[50:55] all right so so it matters your heart's
[50:58] response to the word today amen that's
[51:02] what that's the for me friends all my
[51:05] life in Ministry more than 30 years and
[51:07] almost you know more than now coming up
[51:10] on 29 years pastoring this church that's
[51:13] always been the the uh the real vision
[51:16] of me as long as I can see your heart uh
[51:19] for God and I I know you're you you make
[51:22] mistakes I'm going to shock you so do I
[51:26] amen
[51:27] no
[51:28] really no I do for real don't look at
[51:31] sister
[51:33] Debbie I I'm I'm admitting it I
[51:37] do but in my heart I love God and in my
[51:41] life I have the love of God Amen and it
[51:44] causes me to go again and go again and
[51:47] go again and go again and I'm just never
[51:49] going to stop till the coming of Jesus
[51:51] Christ why because I've allowed the Holy
[51:54] Spirit to increase my love in the
[51:55] knowledge see and and not only more but
[51:59] more and more that your love may abound
[52:03] yet more and more in knowledge and in
[52:05] all judgment that you may approve things
[52:09] that are excellent see I'll break all
[52:11] this down a little bit as we go I just
[52:13] want to get it read or I'm never going
[52:14] to get
[52:15] anywhere that you may be sincere and
[52:18] without offense till the day of Christ
[52:20] being filled with the fruits of
[52:24] righteousness which are by Jesus Christ
[52:27] unto the glory and the praise of God all
[52:31] right now we're going to skip down um to
[52:35] verse 20 according to my Earnest
[52:39] expectation and my hope that in nothing
[52:43] I shall be ashamed but that with all
[52:45] boldness as always so now also in Christ
[52:50] shall so so now also Christ shall be
[52:54] magnified in my body
[52:56] whether it be by life or by death for to
[53:01] me to live as Christ and to die is gain
[53:07] amen now we will Circle back to
[53:10] Philippians if I don't run out of time I
[53:13] want to come back around to our to our
[53:16] text where we opened up with that where
[53:20] we were in the days of Eli and and
[53:22] Samuel ministered unto the Lord before
[53:24] Eli and the word of the Lord was
[53:26] precious in those days there was no open
[53:30] Vision now precious in the Hebrew which
[53:34] uh has the same basic meaning in the in
[53:36] the Greek also I looked I compared them
[53:38] both and they're pretty much exactly the
[53:39] same
[53:41] thing but precious in the Hebrew where
[53:44] we've read our text is a verb meaning to
[53:49] esteem to to be valuable to be costly so
[53:54] now it's a verb in other words it's
[53:57] action so it it's not just a a thought
[54:01] that you have in your mind oh isn't that
[54:03] lovely well what are you doing about it
[54:06] well oh that's a precious thing really
[54:08] well why do I see it sitting neglected
[54:10] and in danger of being destroyed well
[54:13] but my I love it I believe it's precious
[54:15] well then act like
[54:16] it if something's precious you care
[54:19] about it Am I Wrong something's precious
[54:22] you care about it see I've said many
[54:25] times that
[54:27] in marriage counseling when I see
[54:29] couples in having problems it doesn't
[54:32] take me very long A lot of times you can
[54:35] track it back to to finances and there's
[54:38] conflict because of finances that's
[54:40] that's all that's so often true but but
[54:44] even prior to that one is uh the the the
[54:48] first the number one and it's not only
[54:50] generally the first one but it's the
[54:52] number one vow that I see over 35 years
[54:56] of Ministry the number one vow I see
[54:58] broken in a marriage is the vow to
[55:03] cherish it goes out the window
[55:05] everything becomes old hat and just ho
[55:07] hum and and everything's taken for
[55:09] granted and and that's just a recipe for
[55:13] disaster so this word precious the word
[55:16] was precious in those days because there
[55:19] was no open Vision so when something's
[55:21] rare it's precious precious stones are
[55:25] are precious because they're rare amen e
[55:28] events that happen time that you get to
[55:31] spend with a loved one it's precious to
[55:33] you because it might be rare all right
[55:36] so it's a verb an action word meaning to
[55:39] esteem something in your actions to
[55:41] Value something in your actions to view
[55:44] it as costly it has the basic idea of
[55:47] being highly valuable and worthy you're
[55:52] with
[55:53] me now now you should already be re
[55:56] joing because I'm preaching on precious
[55:58] in thy
[56:00] sight so does he see me as valuable does
[56:04] he see me as worthy I know I don't but
[56:06] does he amen it indicates a high
[56:11] evaluation put on someone or
[56:15] something it indicates considering
[56:18] something worthy of preserving worth
[56:23] preserving such as a human life
[56:27] it can take on the idea of making
[56:30] something rare in certain positive
[56:33] usages the process of redeeming a person
[56:38] now now how much does that
[56:41] cost I'm going to give you a scripture
[56:43] just in a minute I want you to hold that
[56:44] one in your mind the process of
[56:47] redeeming a person is said to cost great
[56:50] effort it is used
[56:51] figuratively of making something scarce
[56:55] or rare you know uh in in life things
[56:59] that come our way in life now brother
[57:02] brandham goes back in the message hear
[57:05] his voice in
[57:07] 1958 there's three sermons where he
[57:10] really um drills down on this idea of
[57:15] the word being
[57:20] precious if I was preaching if it was a
[57:22] preaching sermon today I'd blow through
[57:24] that but this is more of a expository so
[57:27] is that okay we did that last Sunday
[57:30] seemed to be in that gear don't know how
[57:32] long that'll last but we're going to
[57:33] stay right with it brother brandham said
[57:36] in 1958 hear his voice and the child
[57:41] Samuel ministered unto the Lord before
[57:44] Eli and the word of the Lord was
[57:47] precious in those days for there was no
[57:49] open Vision brother brandham says
[57:51] you what is what a vision is then he
[57:55] asks a question
[57:56] here's his answer it's the direct word
[57:59] of the Lord the Lord's word was precious
[58:04] because there was no open vision and the
[58:08] problem with that is without a vision
[58:10] the people
[58:11] perish all
[58:13] right so this is an alarming problem
[58:17] brother Brenham is going to take up this
[58:19] subject and say listen if the if the
[58:22] word of God is rare in your life
[58:26] that could be a
[58:28] problem if the word of God is seldom
[58:31] consumed by you that could be a problem
[58:36] see and so you say well you know what
[58:39] what what if I'm in a position where I
[58:41] can't you know have a live Ministry I'm
[58:44] a shut in there's no church near me well
[58:46] then I would say that the word must be
[58:49] really precious to you and it is
[58:51] precious there's Saints in that
[58:53] condition who who get online spend money
[58:56] on an internet connection set in their
[58:58] living room and stream this service live
[59:00] and by archive and rejoice with you why
[59:03] because the word is
[59:06] precious you don't know what you have
[59:08] until you don't have it
[59:13] Amen brother brandham goes on to say the
[59:16] voice of God hearing his voice in that
[59:20] day was a rare thing see there was no
[59:22] open vision and it was a rare thing the
[59:25] real voice of God now fortunately that
[59:28] was going to get solved as Samuel
[59:30] started to grow he started seeing
[59:31] visions when he hearing the voice of God
[59:33] when he was very young so he says to
[59:36] hear the voice of God and and it's a
[59:40] rare thing now he's going to bring that
[59:41] into the modern day and into his cub
[59:44] scout day now just imagine what it is in
[59:46] our day so he says and it was a rare
[59:49] thing the real voice of God because the
[59:54] people had gotten away
[59:57] amen so now he's not blaming
[1:00:01] God he's not even goingon to he is going
[1:00:03] to throw some shade on the ministry but
[1:00:06] he's he's going to start out by saying
[1:00:09] the people had gotten away they had a
[1:00:12] church in that day that just didn't
[1:00:15] follow the Commandments of the Lord are
[1:00:17] you glad for a church that does really
[1:00:21] are you glad for a church that
[1:00:24] does I know it can be scalding sometimes
[1:00:27] just trust me when us ministers are up
[1:00:30] here scalding you it's scalding us we've
[1:00:33] already been hided you know got a hiding
[1:00:36] in the in the back office and so we're
[1:00:38] all in this thing
[1:00:42] together so he said they had a church in
[1:00:46] that day that just didn't follow the
[1:00:48] Commandments of the Lord they had a
[1:00:50] minister by the name of Eli and he had
[1:00:52] gotten away from God by just teaching
[1:00:55] the precept
[1:00:56] of what the people wanted to
[1:01:01] believe you appreciating your team here
[1:01:04] a little more
[1:01:06] today see preaching what the people
[1:01:09] wanted to
[1:01:10] believe if that isn't a parallel to this
[1:01:13] day he just taught the people and he
[1:01:15] looked he took his choice ones you know
[1:01:17] in the sacrifice and they put the hook
[1:01:19] in he always was taking the best and he
[1:01:21] told his sons to take the best of the
[1:01:23] Flesh and their hooks out of the
[1:01:25] offering and he says it just became a
[1:01:28] place where the offering was the main
[1:01:30] thing I don't ever want this place to be
[1:01:33] where the tithes and offerings are the
[1:01:35] main
[1:01:36] thing I want to preach the gospel if all
[1:01:39] of you stop paying tithes and offerings
[1:01:42] thank you that you do but you know shame
[1:01:45] on you if you don't cuz every real
[1:01:48] Christian does you're not a Christian if
[1:01:49] you're not paying tithes and
[1:01:52] offerings that's the that's that's
[1:01:54] direct quotes that's the scripture
[1:01:55] you're not preaching on that today you
[1:01:57] should be
[1:01:59] glad thankfully it's not a serious
[1:02:02] problem here it's a problem somewhat in
[1:02:03] every church that I've ever seen
[1:02:04] including this one but it's not a
[1:02:06] serious problem here praise the
[1:02:08] Lord um so so so brother Brandon is
[1:02:12] saying so the church just became a place
[1:02:15] where the offering was the main thing
[1:02:18] all right now I'll come back to brother
[1:02:20] brandom in us a little bit I want to
[1:02:22] read you some
[1:02:23] scriptures because you know
[1:02:26] now we're going to look at by comparison
[1:02:28] of some things the Bible called precious
[1:02:31] and hopefully this will inform your
[1:02:33] thinking as to what ought to be labeled
[1:02:36] precious and what ought not to be all
[1:02:38] right so you remember and I'm not
[1:02:41] necessarily going to read them all and
[1:02:43] Noah don't try to follow me because I'm
[1:02:44] going to go too fast just going to
[1:02:46] mainly quote and and and go quickly so
[1:02:50] but if you want to make a note when you
[1:02:52] go home in 1st Samuel 26:21 tells the
[1:02:56] story of of King Saul saying to David
[1:03:00] he's apologizing David I found out you
[1:03:02] could have killed me in my sleep you
[1:03:05] could have killed me when I wasn't
[1:03:07] looking you had several opportunities
[1:03:10] you didn't take them and he says David
[1:03:12] return home he starts calling him his
[1:03:14] son again s Saul's going insane by an
[1:03:17] evil spirit starts calling David his son
[1:03:19] I'll no more do thee harm because my
[1:03:23] soul was precious in Thine Eyes this
[1:03:27] day behold I have played the fool and
[1:03:32] have aired
[1:03:34] exceedingly except the Lord of harvest
[1:03:36] had left us a seed we would be all
[1:03:39] together like under Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:03:41] we have played the fool we have aired
[1:03:43] exceedingly but my
[1:03:46] soul was precious in His sight he cared
[1:03:51] about me he cares about
[1:03:53] you thank God
[1:03:57] amen so you remember the story from
[1:04:01] second Kings chapter 1 where the king
[1:04:04] sent to get Elijah down off the mountain
[1:04:06] he sent a captain with 50 and man of God
[1:04:09] all arrogant man of God King wants you
[1:04:15] ASAP well let's see if I'm a man of God
[1:04:19] if I be a man of God fire will come down
[1:04:22] and consume all of yall gone
[1:04:27] they were
[1:04:29] gone that's 51 humans
[1:04:32] incinerated in a moment from Heaven
[1:04:36] God's been known to Stone people from
[1:04:37] Heaven incinerate people from Heaven
[1:04:41] he's not to be messed with or trifled
[1:04:42] with he's a serious man you understand
[1:04:45] he cares about his word he cares about
[1:04:47] his Messengers be
[1:04:49] careful be careful when you're dealing
[1:04:51] with his Messengers or his servants be
[1:04:54] careful some times I I I I had one man
[1:04:57] one time many years ago doesn't go to
[1:04:59] this church many years ago and and began
[1:05:02] to just bash a certain Minister and I
[1:05:04] knew that what he was saying was
[1:05:06] actually accurate the brother had done
[1:05:08] some things of impropriety but I just
[1:05:10] stopped him I said brother be careful be
[1:05:12] very careful because that is a servant
[1:05:15] of the Lord whether he's whether he's
[1:05:17] not living a life Worthy is one thing
[1:05:20] but be careful because truly he does
[1:05:22] have an evident Min he does have an
[1:05:24] evident fruit of his Ministry and signs
[1:05:26] and wonders and he does preach the word
[1:05:29] uh so and he said well why why should I
[1:05:32] be careful if I'm right I said because
[1:05:33] you could be absolutely right and get in
[1:05:35] a lot of
[1:05:37] trouble be careful see so so he they the
[1:05:43] king does it again 50 more 51 more are
[1:05:46] dead now you 102 men have died uh
[1:05:49] between morning and noon and finally the
[1:05:52] third one comes and he's got his 50 and
[1:05:55] he gets on his hands and knees with his
[1:05:57] face to the ground and crawls up to the
[1:06:00] prophet and he says behold there came
[1:06:03] fire down from heaven and burn up the
[1:06:04] two captains of the former 50s with
[1:06:06] their 50s therefore let my life now be
[1:06:11] precious in thy sight amen and it was
[1:06:15] Elijah had mercy we find out that when
[1:06:19] the queen of shean I got to go quicker
[1:06:20] the queen of shean First Kings 10 when
[1:06:23] she came through the Bible said she came
[1:06:25] came to Jerusalem with a very great
[1:06:27] train with camels that bore spices and
[1:06:30] very much gold and precious stones and
[1:06:33] when she came to Solomon she communed
[1:06:35] with him of all that was in her heart I
[1:06:37] want to tell you something friends when
[1:06:38] you come to God bring him precious
[1:06:40] things bringing precious things making
[1:06:43] the first in your life this this being
[1:06:46] can do amazing things for you and your
[1:06:49] and your life and so she came with
[1:06:52] reverence and just a heathen Queen but
[1:06:54] God honored her
[1:06:56] 2 Chronicles when Solomon was building
[1:06:59] the house of the Lord and Solomon was so
[1:07:01] stressed out because it had to be a
[1:07:02] great Solomon didn't he just felt so
[1:07:05] inadequate so so no way I can do this
[1:07:07] how am I going to pull this off the
[1:07:09] house that contains my God has to be
[1:07:11] great how am I going to build a house to
[1:07:13] contain the God of all Heaven that
[1:07:14] created heavens and earth but here's one
[1:07:17] but so so really the answer to that is
[1:07:20] he couldn't but here's what he could do
[1:07:22] he garnished the house with precious
[1:07:24] stones for beauty and the and and the
[1:07:27] gold was the gold of parame and he built
[1:07:30] it out of the Cedars of Lebanon and he
[1:07:31] did all he could do I just say to you
[1:07:33] today in your life you can't ever be
[1:07:36] completely worthy of housing the Lord
[1:07:38] Jesus Christ but that's okay because
[1:07:41] when he comes in you you get credit for
[1:07:43] his perfect life just make sure you do
[1:07:46] what you can do at least bring gold and
[1:07:50] precious stones let that be your life
[1:07:52] Peter said you're built you're the T
[1:07:54] you're the living Tabernacle of the
[1:07:57] living God's presence so build it
[1:08:01] beautiful so so we find here's that
[1:08:05] scripture in Psalms 49 the price of a
[1:08:08] soul people making their boast about
[1:08:11] their power and they don't need God and
[1:08:12] they can go on without God thank you
[1:08:14] very much and God's reply is them that
[1:08:17] you can't even redeem your own
[1:08:20] brother what what do you think you got
[1:08:22] all this power none none of them can by
[1:08:25] any means redeem his brother nor give
[1:08:28] God give to God a ransom for him for the
[1:08:31] Redemption of their soul is
[1:08:34] precious and it ceaseth forever in other
[1:08:38] words Redemption does not come so
[1:08:41] easily see for for no one here's why
[1:08:45] because no one can ever pay enough money
[1:08:49] to live
[1:08:53] forever you understand the there's no
[1:08:55] amount of money there's no amount of
[1:08:57] worldly Treasures you could bring or
[1:09:00] works that you could do for God to earn
[1:09:04] eternal life whatever you did might have
[1:09:06] value but eventually that value is going
[1:09:08] to run out because you're going to be
[1:09:10] burning up time but but eternal life has
[1:09:13] no end to it and and God is just simply
[1:09:16] saying there's no one who who can pay
[1:09:19] enough money to live forever and never
[1:09:20] see the grave so here's the message you
[1:09:24] need him
[1:09:30] how precious are thy thoughts unto me D
[1:09:34] the psalmist said in Psalms
[1:09:36] 139 how precious are thy thoughts unto
[1:09:39] me oh God how great is the some of them
[1:09:43] David or Solomon I should rather say in
[1:09:45] the third proverb refers to wisdom and
[1:09:49] in wisdom he calls her precious she is
[1:09:53] more precious than Ruth rubies and now
[1:09:57] that's that's this is the wisdom of God
[1:10:00] and Solomon says you need to find
[1:10:02] her you need to find her and because her
[1:10:07] wisdom is is above rubies don't chase
[1:10:09] rubies see and in fact is he said and
[1:10:14] all the things that thou C desire are
[1:10:17] not to be compared to
[1:10:20] her so there's nothing you could make a
[1:10:23] list of today of I don't care how much
[1:10:26] how long your list was you know I want
[1:10:28] an education and I want money and I want
[1:10:30] friends and I want likes and I want this
[1:10:32] and I want that and I want power and I
[1:10:34] want I want Beauty and I want society
[1:10:37] and I want the world make a list check
[1:10:39] it
[1:10:42] twice none of it is equal to one thing
[1:10:46] finding W God's
[1:10:49] wisdom it's a chasing of the
[1:10:52] wind to to live a life without the
[1:10:54] wisdom of God he goes on in the 20th
[1:10:57] Solomon says again there is gold okay
[1:11:01] there is
[1:11:02] gold uh and a multitude of rubies okay
[1:11:06] I'll give that up there is gold there is
[1:11:08] a multitude of rubies they're there for
[1:11:10] the taking but the lips of knowledge are
[1:11:13] a precious
[1:11:15] Jewel the lips of knowledge I would
[1:11:18] rather give my children lips of
[1:11:20] knowledge than give them rubies and
[1:11:23] gold because I've seen too many parents
[1:11:26] give their kids rubies and gold and
[1:11:29] every kind of every kind of thing that
[1:11:31] the world to make them a success in the
[1:11:33] world a world that's burning
[1:11:36] down and I'm not opposed to having your
[1:11:39] children Excel but just remember if you
[1:11:42] win the rat
[1:11:44] race kill a
[1:11:47] rat brother brandom says he says they
[1:11:50] talk about you know this was before 69
[1:11:53] he said they talk about going to the
[1:11:54] Moon brother ad him says well I care
[1:11:56] about the moon he said they get up there
[1:11:58] they won't find nothing they did and
[1:11:59] they didn't and he said I want to pass
[1:12:01] the moon so fast they don't even see it
[1:12:04] hallelujah oh he said he said they they
[1:12:07] want this education and that education
[1:12:09] he said education
[1:12:13] civilization is all of the devil and
[1:12:16] will perish he says Heaven won't have
[1:12:19] any education and then the next breath
[1:12:22] says it'll be an education so far
[1:12:24] superior ior to this this won't even be
[1:12:27] thought of so where are you laying your
[1:12:30] Treasures young people what is your goal
[1:12:32] what's
[1:12:34] precious to
[1:12:36] you what's precious to you Mom and
[1:12:39] Dad how you how are you raising them how
[1:12:43] how are you raising them looking right
[1:12:44] in your eyes how are you raising them
[1:12:47] see those of you who aren't don't have
[1:12:49] children yet but children are on the way
[1:12:52] and what what are you going to
[1:12:54] do what's going to be your
[1:12:56] decision there's there's been parents in
[1:13:00] this church that I preach this kind of
[1:13:02] preaching to I've I've went through five
[1:13:05] or six generations of young people I'm
[1:13:08] getting old I I I dedicated them as
[1:13:11] babies baptized them with little kids
[1:13:13] and now they're grown adults blown out
[1:13:14] into the world because their parents
[1:13:17] didn't care enough to take what I was
[1:13:20] preaching and make the changes in their
[1:13:22] home and their children have followed
[1:13:24] them right into the world and we'll
[1:13:25] follow them right into the tribulation
[1:13:27] and we'll follow them right into the
[1:13:28] Lake of Fire if they don't find
[1:13:32] Christ
[1:13:35] W it's it's it's tragically sad so he
[1:13:40] says the lips of knowledge are precious
[1:13:43] jewels now I I want you to understand
[1:13:47] that that this lady wisdom that is more
[1:13:50] precious than rubies and that there's no
[1:13:53] collection of things that you could even
[1:13:54] desire to compare to her and these lips
[1:13:56] of knowledge that are precious jewels
[1:13:59] this is the very wisdom and knowledge
[1:14:01] that the world has rejected in every age
[1:14:05] amen so it shouldn't seem peculiar to
[1:14:07] you that I that preachers preach about
[1:14:09] this because the Bible says in Romans 1
[1:14:14] for the invisible things of him from the
[1:14:16] creation of the world are clearly seen
[1:14:19] being understood by the things that are
[1:14:21] made there's no way to deny the presence
[1:14:23] of God when you walk around in nature
[1:14:25] you're an idiot if you do that you're
[1:14:27] blind there's no way to look at the
[1:14:29] cosmos and see the Perfection and see
[1:14:31] how it all works and how all nature runs
[1:14:33] in continuity and and and and and to
[1:14:36] think that that happened by accident
[1:14:38] that is
[1:14:40] silly and if you have a creation you
[1:14:42] have to have a Creator because nothing
[1:14:45] something can't come from nothing so
[1:14:47] there has to be a cause there has to be
[1:14:49] a
[1:14:50] causer amen and nature is reflective of
[1:14:54] his Beauty just like I have had children
[1:14:58] and my children you all enjoy as friends
[1:15:01] beautiful young men and and they're an
[1:15:03] expression of me they came out of me
[1:15:05] that's what nature came out of God
[1:15:07] that's why it's beautiful that's why we
[1:15:09] love it amen because we're built out of
[1:15:12] we come out of the same thing that's why
[1:15:14] you love the word of God because a gene
[1:15:16] of God's nature was down inside you and
[1:15:19] it came to life
[1:15:21] Hallelujah see but but the world in in
[1:15:25] in in in large part has rejected it get
[1:15:28] that through your head I'm sorry that's
[1:15:31] true but it's never not been
[1:15:35] so he's going back all the way to the
[1:15:37] anti deluvian people the
[1:15:39] Ancients he said they saw God they saw
[1:15:42] the things that are made even his
[1:15:44] eternal power in Godhead so that they
[1:15:45] are without excuse no wonder Jesus
[1:15:47] preached to them in hell and Jesus went
[1:15:50] down there and told them said you ought
[1:15:52] to have listened to Noah you should have
[1:15:54] listen
[1:15:55] you didn't but you should have
[1:15:58] see and so he says they're without
[1:16:01] excuse because that when they knew God
[1:16:03] so at one time they did they glorified
[1:16:05] him not as God neither were thankful but
[1:16:07] became vain in their own imaginations
[1:16:09] and their foolish heart was darken
[1:16:11] professing themselves to be wise they
[1:16:14] became
[1:16:15] fools see and even as they did not like
[1:16:19] to retain God in their knowledge this is
[1:16:21] blistering this is an
[1:16:23] indictment you can't even hide I can't
[1:16:27] even I can't even make an excuse for
[1:16:29] these people even as they did not like
[1:16:31] to retain God in their knowledge you
[1:16:33] remember that knowledge that's more
[1:16:34] valuable than rubies that knowledge
[1:16:36] that's precious
[1:16:37] stones even as they did not like to
[1:16:40] retain God in their knowledge God just
[1:16:42] gave them over to a rep probate mind to
[1:16:44] do those things which are not convenient
[1:16:46] being filled with all unrighteousness
[1:16:48] fornication wickedness covetousness
[1:16:50] maliciousness full of Envy murder debate
[1:16:53] deceit malignity Whispers backbiters
[1:16:54] haters of God disrespectful proud
[1:16:56] boasters am I reading a headline out of
[1:16:59] the modern day or is this 2,000 year old
[1:17:02] text boasters inventors of evil things
[1:17:04] disobedient Parents Without natural
[1:17:07] understanding Covenant Breakers without
[1:17:08] natural affection a lot of parents
[1:17:10] suffer from that they don't have a
[1:17:12] natural affection to to live the kind of
[1:17:14] Life they should live in front of their
[1:17:15] children even though it's going to
[1:17:16] corrupt and poison them implacable
[1:17:19] unmerciful who knowing the Judgment of
[1:17:21] God that they which commit such things
[1:17:23] are worthy of death not only do the same
[1:17:25] but have pleasure in them that do them
[1:17:27] they'll they'll clap for the people who
[1:17:30] are against
[1:17:31] God I didn't make that up Paul didn't
[1:17:34] make that up that that's that that's
[1:17:36] true see so but but now that's contrast
[1:17:41] all right remember I told you I was
[1:17:43] going to keep going back and forth so
[1:17:44] you can get what precious is Isaiah 28
[1:17:48] 16 therefore thus saith the Lord behold
[1:17:52] I lay in Zion this is the remedy this
[1:17:55] the remedy for a Dying World this is the
[1:17:57] remedy that he prescribed for rebellious
[1:18:00] Israel behold I lay in Zion for a
[1:18:03] foundation a stone a tried Stone a
[1:18:07] precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation
[1:18:11] that's Christ that's a sure Foundation
[1:18:13] there is no other Foundation to build
[1:18:16] your life
[1:18:17] on besides
[1:18:22] that Jeremiah records in Lamentations
[1:18:26] 4:2 that the sons of Zion are comparable
[1:18:30] to fine gold and they're precious the
[1:18:33] sons of Zion how many sons of Zion do we
[1:18:35] have in here today the son the precious
[1:18:38] sons of Zion comparable to to find gold
[1:18:42] going into the New Testament I'm just
[1:18:43] hurrying along boy I got to hurry
[1:18:46] Matthew
[1:18:48] 26:7 there came un unto him a woman
[1:18:50] having an alabaster box of very precious
[1:18:52] ointment poured it on his head as he
[1:18:54] said at me and brother brandom talks
[1:18:56] about that precious ointment of this
[1:18:58] woman that even though when she went
[1:19:00] into the store to buy it she was worried
[1:19:03] because she knew he was a prophet she
[1:19:05] knew he'll know brother Ram says picks
[1:19:07] up in the narrative starts telling the
[1:19:09] story uh he says she she he said she
[1:19:11] said she'll he'll know where I got this
[1:19:14] he'll know but I got to do it anyway and
[1:19:16] she grabbed her little treasure box and
[1:19:18] broke it took out all of her money that
[1:19:20] she had made you know I going to tell
[1:19:22] you something
[1:19:23] friends he just wants your life it
[1:19:25] doesn't matter how bad you wrecked it it
[1:19:28] doesn't matter how soiled you made it he
[1:19:31] can clean it he'll take it right now it
[1:19:34] doesn't matter what
[1:19:37] happened but that that that that wasn't
[1:19:39] the point the point was she wanted the
[1:19:41] best for him and she told the
[1:19:43] storekeeper here's all my money I want
[1:19:46] the best I want the best he said Jesus
[1:19:49] wants your best he deserves your best he
[1:19:51] said you ought to make him first don't
[1:19:53] make him second he don't want to be
[1:19:55] second he don't deserve to be
[1:20:00] second see and so and then brother Bram
[1:20:03] you know he Segways to The woman there
[1:20:05] who came into Simon's house you remember
[1:20:07] that and they were all laughing at Jesus
[1:20:09] they all was there just like the world
[1:20:11] they're laughing at him they're all
[1:20:13] there to just ridicule him they're all
[1:20:15] there to just judge him and and and cast
[1:20:17] shade on him but brother Brandon talks
[1:20:19] about that woman that came in and fell
[1:20:22] at his feet began to wash his feet with
[1:20:24] her tears brother brandham said in all
[1:20:26] that unbelief in all of that hypocrisy
[1:20:29] he said it only took one woman to change
[1:20:32] the whole
[1:20:33] atmosphere and sins were forgiven and a
[1:20:36] soul was redeemed and 10,000 worlds of
[1:20:40] value was
[1:20:45] captured Peter says in uh first
[1:20:49] Peter uh six wherein you greatly
[1:20:53] rejoice now we're going to show you some
[1:20:56] contrast wherein you greatly Rejoice
[1:20:59] though now for a season if need be you
[1:21:01] are in heaviness through manifold
[1:21:03] Temptations verse 7 that the trial of
[1:21:06] your faith being much more precious than
[1:21:10] of gold that perisheth though it be
[1:21:12] tried with fire might be found unto
[1:21:16] praise and honor and Glory at the
[1:21:20] appearing of Jesus Christ oh I love that
[1:21:24] friends we're talking about something
[1:21:26] you know why it's more precious than
[1:21:28] gold because gold
[1:21:31] perisheth this preciousness of Christ
[1:21:34] never perishes Hallelujah whatever your
[1:21:37] suffering is today whatever trial you
[1:21:41] might be in right now just know this
[1:21:44] that your life there will be praise and
[1:21:47] it'll be honor and it'll be
[1:21:50] glory so do your wor Satan because once
[1:21:53] I get as brother how Howard Carol said
[1:21:56] go ahead Satan carry on old boy this is
[1:21:59] your day my day is coming Hallelujah my
[1:22:03] day is
[1:22:04] coming oh
[1:22:07] my so Peter says that on down in the
[1:22:09] 18th and 19th verses for as much as you
[1:22:12] know that you were not redeemed with
[1:22:13] corruptible things as silver and gold
[1:22:16] from your vain conversation received by
[1:22:19] tradition from your fathers but you were
[1:22:21] redeemed with the precious blood of
[1:22:24] Christ Christ Hallelujah he goes on in
[1:22:27] his second letter whereby are here's
[1:22:29] another contrast whereby are given to us
[1:22:32] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:22:34] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:22:37] the divine nature there's nothing you
[1:22:39] can do in your life more valuable to you
[1:22:41] than be a partaker of a divine nature
[1:22:45] when you are a partaker of divine nature
[1:22:47] you will never
[1:22:48] die when you're a partaker of a divine
[1:22:51] nature Satan is under your feet when you
[1:22:55] are a partaker of divine nature all
[1:22:58] Heaven is behind
[1:23:00] you how do I get that there's precious
[1:23:03] promises
[1:23:05] precious they're in the word do you care
[1:23:07] about them what is precious to you
[1:23:11] today is this
[1:23:13] precious if it is that's good if it's
[1:23:16] not that's real
[1:23:18] bad
[1:23:21] see it goes on Revelation 21 1011 and he
[1:23:25] carried me away in the spirit to a great
[1:23:27] high mountain and showed me that great
[1:23:28] City at Holy
[1:23:30] Jerusalem this is uh the the holy
[1:23:32] Jerusalem is a type of the Bride I don't
[1:23:34] have time to preach on that today the
[1:23:37] holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven
[1:23:39] from God having the glory of God and her
[1:23:43] light she even calls it a her she has
[1:23:46] the glory of God and her light was liken
[1:23:49] to a stone most precious amen even like
[1:23:53] a jasper stone clear as Crystal friends
[1:23:57] stop letting the devil beat you up with
[1:23:59] your failed past I'll promise you when
[1:24:02] you get to that City when you are that
[1:24:06] city you'll be clear as
[1:24:12] Crystal you'll be
[1:24:14] clear as
[1:24:17] Crystal verse n 21 verse 19 the
[1:24:20] foundations of the wall of the city were
[1:24:23] garnished with all all manner of
[1:24:26] precious stones so do you wonder why I
[1:24:29] say all the time that our future is
[1:24:32] bright how can you read that how do you
[1:24:34] read that and not think our future is
[1:24:36] bright see oh but the devil he don't
[1:24:43] matter is eternal life precious to you
[1:24:47] come on is eternal life precious to you
[1:24:50] have you been granted eternal life have
[1:24:52] you been given the opportunity to serve
[1:24:54] God then he don't matter hallelujah it's
[1:24:58] when you stop short of that lofty
[1:25:02] position in Christ now Satan
[1:25:05] matters now he matters when you don't
[1:25:08] when when when you don't when you stop
[1:25:10] short of allowing the mind which was in
[1:25:13] Christ to be in you when you stop short
[1:25:16] of letting the word dwell in you richly
[1:25:19] amen see when you're not willing to uh
[1:25:23] flee youthful lust when you're not
[1:25:25] willing to cast down vain imaginations
[1:25:28] when you're not W then Satan matters
[1:25:30] when you're not willing to do those
[1:25:32] things when you're not willing to bring
[1:25:33] every thought subject to the Holy
[1:25:36] Spirit CU if you bring that thought to
[1:25:38] the Holy Spirit he'll kill it if you
[1:25:41] don't you'll ruminate and next thing you
[1:25:43] know it'll lead to an act oh friends
[1:25:46] this is a rocket science this is
[1:25:47] overcoming 101 I want to be an
[1:25:50] overcomer the word is precious to me
[1:25:52] eternal life is precious to me the
[1:25:55] example I live in front of you is a
[1:25:57] precious
[1:26:00] thing see it's when you stop short of
[1:26:03] that lofty position now that's when
[1:26:05] Satan matters that's exactly when he
[1:26:07] matters and he plays for
[1:26:10] blood continuing with our quote from
[1:26:13] hear ye him or I'm sorry hear his voice
[1:26:17] 1958 and Samuel just uh he he says
[1:26:21] Samuel he means Eli of course and Eli
[1:26:25] just careless about the way that he
[1:26:27] handled the Commandments of the Lord and
[1:26:30] the real word of God was a rare thing
[1:26:34] that's the way it is today we go to
[1:26:37] church and we find the people going in
[1:26:40] and having some great drive on oh we
[1:26:42] want to make our denomination this year
[1:26:44] so many more bring bring your letter
[1:26:45] from the other Church Unite with us and
[1:26:47] slogans like a million more and 44 and
[1:26:49] all such as that trying to outgrow the
[1:26:51] next denomination and in doing so we've
[1:26:53] let the bars down to the Bible because
[1:26:56] that's really one of the only ways you
[1:26:57] can do it see uh if if you preach the
[1:27:00] fresh kill of the word only Eagles will
[1:27:03] gather see and so so but I like
[1:27:08] eagles amen I Jonathan's always trying
[1:27:12] to get me to go birding with him and he
[1:27:14] loves the Raptors and next time he says
[1:27:16] hey Dad you want to go uh you want to go
[1:27:18] birding uh for eagles and I'll say I'm
[1:27:20] going
[1:27:22] Sunday amen wow that's some beautiful
[1:27:25] ones whoa look at all them
[1:27:32] Eagles so he says um and in doing so
[1:27:36] we've let the bars down of the Bible
[1:27:39] we've got away and began to teach things
[1:27:41] different the prophets spoke of these
[1:27:43] days they did it didn't get here by
[1:27:46] accident prophets knew it was
[1:27:48] coming prophets spoke of these days that
[1:27:51] when they for teaching would teach the
[1:27:53] man's Doctrine and not God's Doctrine
[1:27:55] and we've seen so much of that it's gone
[1:27:57] on so long until today the in the in the
[1:28:01] remember there's Boy Scouts this is Cub
[1:28:03] Scouts this is kindergarten
[1:28:06] 1958 all right love to have those simple
[1:28:09] days for serving God again see and in
[1:28:13] the and in the Cub Scout days just by
[1:28:17] contrast think of about what it is now
[1:28:19] think of what your children have access
[1:28:21] to think of what you have access to see
[1:28:25] so he says and we've so much of that
[1:28:27] today and it's gone on so long until
[1:28:29] today the word of the word of the Lord
[1:28:31] is a rare
[1:28:33] thing that someone can come and say thus
[1:28:36] sayeth the Lord I I hope that's not true
[1:28:39] in our homes friends I hope it's not
[1:28:42] true for you and your family that the
[1:28:45] that partaking of the word of the Lord
[1:28:47] is a rare
[1:28:49] thing
[1:28:51] see we've had a lot of impersonation of
[1:28:54] that Satan is really on the job see and
[1:28:57] so he goes on I'm just trying to skip
[1:28:59] down it's a rare thing to hear the voice
[1:29:01] of the Lord to find a a person that can
[1:29:03] you know say the Lord spoke to me you
[1:29:05] notice that amongst the people anymore
[1:29:07] that they hardly hear a time you know
[1:29:09] and and he talks about prayer that they
[1:29:11] they can't say the Lord spoke to me
[1:29:13] because there's no more praying like
[1:29:15] there used to be and their homes were
[1:29:17] back then their homes were set in order
[1:29:19] by the book of the Lord and God was
[1:29:22] first in their home amen amen that a
[1:29:28] contrast see we got too many things
[1:29:31] ahead of the
[1:29:33] Lord that's a tough one this is 1958
[1:29:37] what is it in
[1:29:38] 2024 we got two many things ahead of the
[1:29:42] Lord you can't have the prayer meeting
[1:29:45] because Mr Godfrey is on TV tonight you
[1:29:48] can't have the prayer meeting because we
[1:29:49] love Lucy is on tonight or some kind of
[1:29:52] a foolish nonsense it's like that that
[1:29:55] takes up the time and we don't have time
[1:29:58] to hear the voice of the Lord you don't
[1:30:00] need me to cabbage on that brother
[1:30:02] brandham is blasting us
[1:30:04] already and those who do claim to be
[1:30:06] Christians just kneel down with a little
[1:30:08] prayer a little homemade Lord bless me
[1:30:10] bless family take care of us thank you
[1:30:11] good night next morning rise say just
[1:30:13] guide me through the day good day oh all
[1:30:15] right thank you see we first of all we
[1:30:18] do all the Talking we don't even give
[1:30:20] him a chance to talk back you have to
[1:30:22] spend some time doing that
[1:30:25] see and he says that if we would pray
[1:30:27] and pray until our soul comes into the
[1:30:30] presence of God and then just relax and
[1:30:32] listen to his voice but there's so many
[1:30:34] voices today and how there's so many
[1:30:38] voices today that takes the voice of the
[1:30:41] Lord away from
[1:30:47] us right right
[1:30:49] Eagles now Focus I don't see everybody
[1:30:52] saying amen okay okay now I'm focused
[1:30:55] right Eagles all right that's
[1:30:59] better so many
[1:31:01] voices they they so many people are
[1:31:04] listening to that see there's so many
[1:31:07] voices to take the voice of the Lord
[1:31:09] away there's a voice of pleasure so many
[1:31:12] people are listening to that where they
[1:31:15] can go home and have a good time or or
[1:31:18] where they can go and have a good time
[1:31:19] and many of them are professing to be
[1:31:21] Christians some kind of an old rock and
[1:31:23] roll coming up they just can't listen to
[1:31:25] what God say well I'm a Christian I read
[1:31:28] a Bible verse every day Jesus wept
[1:31:30] that's it go
[1:31:33] ahead but then to really get down and
[1:31:36] pray they got too many other things to
[1:31:42] do there's so many voices in the world
[1:31:46] so many things to attract our attention
[1:31:49] from God or distract our attention oh I
[1:31:52] would like to go into personal
[1:31:54] experiences he talks about that you know
[1:31:57] and and and would love to you know have
[1:31:58] personal testimonies and and and let me
[1:32:01] let me skip over some of this um and and
[1:32:04] how the Lord came and spoke to him he
[1:32:06] says oh he he is still the same Lord God
[1:32:09] and you hear him hour after hour
[1:32:11] speaking to you in your in your prayer
[1:32:12] Closet in your prayer room come out
[1:32:14] before the audience speak visible to the
[1:32:16] people the voice of God it was precious
[1:32:19] in the days of Samuel it's more precious
[1:32:22] today am for there was no open Vision
[1:32:27] Peter heard the voice and it changed his
[1:32:29] theology he went right straight to the
[1:32:31] Gentiles who he thought was a bunch of
[1:32:32] illiterate offcast but the voice of God
[1:32:35] not his teaching the voice of the Living
[1:32:38] God changed
[1:32:41] him now a much shorter quote he covers
[1:32:45] this subject again and in the voice of
[1:32:48] God in this last day is it all right you
[1:32:50] good I'm I'm going to stop here just in
[1:32:51] a minute don't what does B say I'm
[1:32:54] fitting to close don't get
[1:32:55] nervous all
[1:32:58] right the voice of God in this last day
[1:33:01] it's a very outstanding time this
[1:33:05] 1963 it's a very outstanding time we
[1:33:08] realize that where we're speaking from
[1:33:12] in the scripture there was no open
[1:33:14] Vision in the days of Samuel therefore
[1:33:16] where there's no vision the people
[1:33:18] perish we must have a vision and Visions
[1:33:20] come to the prophet and it's the word of
[1:33:22] the Lord spoken to him
[1:33:24] that's the beauty of this message
[1:33:26] because it came through a prophet so
[1:33:28] this message is the voice of God it's
[1:33:31] the vision given to a prophet see and we
[1:33:35] need the voice of God today to meet the
[1:33:37] need of the hour to meet the time that
[1:33:40] we're living in and after he has
[1:33:42] promised it we can rest assure that he
[1:33:44] will keep his promise that's the
[1:33:47] confidence that the believer has in his
[1:33:48] maker that he promised to meet the need
[1:33:50] last one absolute 1963 there was no
[1:33:54] prophet in them days to stand to the
[1:33:56] word and direct Israel so the word
[1:33:58] wasn't coming so every man did what was
[1:34:01] right in his own sight and that's about
[1:34:04] where we've gotten to again today
[1:34:06] Brethren see every man is right in his
[1:34:09] own sight say well if I want to take the
[1:34:11] Golden Rule if I want to do this on some
[1:34:13] religion I believe my religion do so and
[1:34:15] so and you find that everybody finds
[1:34:18] that God's Got Away listen to this
[1:34:21] Prophet God's Got Away the Bible say
[1:34:23] says there is a way that seeth right
[1:34:26] unto a man but the end thereof is the
[1:34:28] ways of death and there's nobody wants
[1:34:31] to die that's that's separation we don't
[1:34:34] want to separate from God a we we want
[1:34:38] to live life and he says life is the
[1:34:41] greatest treasure that man can have and
[1:34:43] now we've got to find out what is life
[1:34:45] and he Jesus said my word is life that's
[1:34:49] the life that you should have the word
[1:34:53] living in in you I've given you the
[1:34:56] problem and I've given you the
[1:34:58] solution the word living in you the
[1:35:03] vision that the prophet had is that when
[1:35:05] he you know that that to show us one of
[1:35:08] the one of the beauties that beautiful
[1:35:10] things that came out of the opening of
[1:35:12] The Seven Seals is that she is
[1:35:15] him she's no longer her and I've taught
[1:35:19] on that before she's not she's not
[1:35:21] corporally him I said I didn't die for
[1:35:25] you you don't pray to me you understand
[1:35:28] but so she's not literally him in that
[1:35:30] Corporal sense but she is the Corporal
[1:35:33] extended body he she is the word made
[1:35:36] flesh in the Earth again just like Jesus
[1:35:38] was when he walked the shores of Galilee
[1:35:41] only he was born without sin you were
[1:35:43] born in sin now brought back to a
[1:35:45] sinless condition and the plan of God
[1:35:47] rolls on she is him because Hebrews 13:8
[1:35:50] gives us the key she's the same as him
[1:35:55] when you say she is him that's not
[1:35:57] that's really in a way just saying I'm a
[1:36:00] Christian the problem is the whole world
[1:36:03] says I'm a Christian but they're not the
[1:36:05] same as
[1:36:07] him and that's the real rub Hebrews 138
[1:36:11] has no application in their daily life
[1:36:14] they're not him they're they're they're
[1:36:16] admiring the fine qualities of Jesus but
[1:36:19] they've never had a a heart replacement
[1:36:22] they've never come under the power of
[1:36:24] God and been made a new creation go
[1:36:26] through the Regeneration with him they
[1:36:29] the the disciples said oh yeah we can do
[1:36:31] that absolutely and Jesus said can you
[1:36:33] can you eat what I'll eat and go through
[1:36:35] what I'll go through you've got to be
[1:36:37] with me in the Regeneration yeah Lord we
[1:36:39] can do that absolutely you're going to
[1:36:40] resurrect no wait a minute hold on oh
[1:36:43] before I resurrect I first got to I
[1:36:45] first got to die wait what yeah and then
[1:36:48] I got to be buried oh hold on then I
[1:36:51] resurrect now how many want it amen she
[1:36:55] is him are those who were willing to die
[1:36:59] and be buried and then raised with him
[1:37:03] because she's got to be the continuation
[1:37:05] of the word of God she's the she's the
[1:37:08] multiplication she's the multiplied
[1:37:10] expression that's what Genesis 1 128 is
[1:37:13] pointing to he said to Adam be fruitful
[1:37:16] and
[1:37:17] multiply Hallelujah brother brandham
[1:37:19] said he already knew in spok word
[1:37:21] Original Seed he already knew nothing
[1:37:23] could multiply unless something died and
[1:37:26] so there was going to be a death and it
[1:37:28] was going to be the Lamb of God who
[1:37:30] would die for the sins of his family
[1:37:33] Hallelujah and you've got to go through
[1:37:35] the Regeneration with him and be willing
[1:37:37] to die to yourself and die to the world
[1:37:40] and be buried and the world has no more
[1:37:43] and then you're born again and renewed
[1:37:45] you resurrect with
[1:37:48] him she is him see you be come
[1:37:55] literally what the bride's image is and
[1:37:57] I'm going to close right here because I
[1:37:58] can't dare go to my next event we'll
[1:38:00] have to make it another
[1:38:03] part what you find
[1:38:05] happening is that the the family of God
[1:38:09] in this last day is now she's no longer
[1:38:13] just a part of God because they had a
[1:38:15] partial understanding but now she's the
[1:38:19] fully unveiled word of God she's all the
[1:38:24] revelation of the mystery of his
[1:38:27] person you get that so that that's why I
[1:38:30] can come here today and take a sermon
[1:38:32] like this and and and and i' I've had to
[1:38:35] just put it like brother Brandon put it
[1:38:36] and just as they say put it in the brass
[1:38:38] tax just lay it out there and say Here's
[1:38:41] contrast here's people who didn't value
[1:38:43] the word of God here's people who did
[1:38:45] what say
[1:38:47] you what say you there's people in
[1:38:50] history who valued who held his word
[1:38:53] precious
[1:38:54] and there's people who didn't what say
[1:38:56] you choose choose this day whom you will
[1:39:00] serve choose who is precious to you
[1:39:03] choose what is precious in your life
[1:39:06] amen let's stand to our feet
[1:39:09] friends choose this dayu what is
[1:39:13] precious to you praise God while the
[1:39:17] musicians come and and and and play I
[1:39:21] want you just to Bow your heads with me
[1:39:23] just for
[1:39:27] moment everybody getting to their
[1:39:31] Post Bow your heads with me for a
[1:39:40] moment Lord there
[1:39:43] was so much more word to get to and but
[1:39:49] I I I I'm okay I I feel like that's
[1:39:52] exactly you you you were in control of
[1:39:54] it you ordained everything that was
[1:39:58] said and if you give me life and if
[1:40:00] there's a tomorrow and if we're assemble
[1:40:02] again here together before your coming
[1:40:06] although we would take your
[1:40:08] coming but if we if we have a tomorrow
[1:40:13] Lord I guess today the real burden of my
[1:40:17] heart if I really bring it down to the
[1:40:20] Brass tax the real burden of this
[1:40:22] Shepherd 's heart for the people Prophet
[1:40:25] called it a burden of the word for the
[1:40:27] people and that word is
[1:40:30] this what is precious to
[1:40:37] you what what do you hold as valuable
[1:40:41] and in what
[1:40:43] order do you assign
[1:40:46] it preciousness there's many things that
[1:40:49] are
[1:40:51] precious but what is the
[1:40:53] how would you set the order if you made
[1:40:56] a list of those things what would be the
[1:40:58] order in your list would would Christ
[1:41:00] and his
[1:41:02] life would being would following him
[1:41:05] through the Regeneration be at the top
[1:41:07] of your list and if you've already
[1:41:10] accomplished that and you're already
[1:41:11] born a new in Christ then then what's at
[1:41:15] the top of your list what ought to be
[1:41:17] there is that your life would bring
[1:41:20] forth a testimony of the word of God
[1:41:25] that that would be the first and
[1:41:26] foremost things of course you're going
[1:41:28] to have other things you've got life and
[1:41:30] living and families and jobs and bills
[1:41:32] and the functions of living I get that
[1:41:35] of course we've mankind has faced that
[1:41:38] since the fall to earned by the sweat of
[1:41:40] his brow children go to school I'm all
[1:41:42] for it I love it that's not the we get
[1:41:45] jobs we get careers praise the Lord
[1:41:47] thank God for his
[1:41:49] Bounty but surely that's not at the top
[1:41:52] of your list
[1:41:54] list surely
[1:41:57] everything that you could ever want to
[1:41:59] do is under and subject to living your
[1:42:04] life and making Christ the center making
[1:42:06] him
[1:42:07] first reading his word praying communing
[1:42:12] with him letting that come out through
[1:42:14] your life and through your flesh and
[1:42:16] your life becomes an
[1:42:18] example of the Bible so that people who
[1:42:21] will never read the Bible Act will read
[1:42:24] it by reading
[1:42:26] you surely that's true
[1:42:28] friends I came here today with faith in
[1:42:31] my heart that that's true about all of
[1:42:33] us if you're here today and you've never
[1:42:35] known him in the power of his
[1:42:37] resurrection in his power and his
[1:42:39] resurrection see that's what the Bible
[1:42:42] actually says to know him in in the
[1:42:44] power and the
[1:42:47] resurrection so I don't just want to
[1:42:49] know him in power I want to know him in
[1:42:50] his resurrection and if I'm going to
[1:42:52] know him in his resurrection I got to
[1:42:53] first die and be buried could never know
[1:42:56] him in the power of His and Resurrection
[1:42:59] unless I'm willing to first die and be
[1:43:01] buried and then I can rise with
[1:43:04] him then I can live my life in
[1:43:06] fellowship with his sufferings and allow
[1:43:09] patience to have her work and allow the
[1:43:11] trials and fiery things to bring
[1:43:14] preciousness into my
[1:43:16] life Lord one
[1:43:19] day we were lost and undone we had no
[1:43:22] chance
[1:43:24] but my soul was precious in thy
[1:43:27] sight I thank you for that Lord I raise
[1:43:30] up my hands why don't we raise up hands
[1:43:32] all over the building say Lord we thank
[1:43:34] you thank you that our souls were
[1:43:37] precious in your sight thank you Lord
[1:43:39] that you didn't give me to the devil he
[1:43:41] wanted me but you wouldn't give me and
[1:43:43] he couldn't take me Lord because I
[1:43:45] belonged to you and now I've surrendered
[1:43:47] to you now the devil don't matter he
[1:43:48] can't stop me my whole life is given to

[1:44:48] to see you had a beauty and a harmony
[1:44:51] with the Lord and the spirit flow flowed
