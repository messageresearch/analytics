[0:00] [Music]
[0:10] When the music fades
[0:14] and all is stripped away
[0:18] and the simply comes,
[0:23] [Music]
[0:23] [Applause]
[0:26] longing just to pray.
[0:31] something that's a word
[0:34] that will bless your heart.
[0:41] I'll bring you more than a song.
[0:46] For a song in it is not what you have
[0:52] required.
[0:57] You search much deeper within
[1:02] through the way things appear. You're
[1:06] looking into my heart.
[1:13] I'm coming back to you.
[1:17] Oh, worship.
[1:20] It is all about you.
[1:25] All about you.
[1:27] Jesus,

[2:22] King of endless world.
[2:25] [Music]
[2:26] No, it could express
[2:30] how much you deserve.
[2:33] [Music]
[2:38] Though I'm weak and bold
[2:42] and all I have is yours.
[2:46] Every single
[2:48] prayer
[2:50] [Music]
[2:53] I'll bring you more than a song.
[2:58] For a song itself
[3:01] is not what you have required.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; I'll search much deeper.
[3:09] You search much deeper within
[3:14] through the wave pain.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; You're looking
[3:20] my heart.
[3:26] I'm coming back to
[3:29] heart worship.
[3:33] All about you. Let's give the Lord a
[3:35] wave offering this morning. all about
[3:38] you, Jesus.
[3:41] I'm sorry, Lord, for things I've made.
[3:49] It's all about you.
[3:53] All about you, Jesus.
[3:58] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[4:04] [Music]
[4:05] All about you.
[4:09] All about you, Jesus.
[4:14] I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I made.
[4:21] All about you.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; Say,

[4:34] Amen. Brother Luther, if you come. Amen.
[4:39] Amen. Is there any unspoken prayer
[4:41] request by the uplift of hands? The Lord
[4:45] knows all the needs. Amen. And all the
[4:48] desires. Come on, my brother. Amen.
[4:54] Praise the Lord.
[4:56] Amen.
[4:58] Looking unto Jesus, the author and
[4:59] finisher of our faith. Amen. look
[5:02] anywhere else and
[5:04] you're not going to rise to the place
[5:06] that you should be. Amen. He is high and
[5:08] lifted up. Let's pray.
[5:12] Father, as I sit there this morning
[5:15] looking at so many different things,
[5:16] Lord.
[5:19] But Father, when I look up
[5:22] or that Sunday school lesson,
[5:25] Lord, there's nothing in myself that is
[5:28] worthy
[5:30] except what you've planted there.
[5:33] No man can come to God unless you draw
[5:35] him, Father. We gather together
[5:38] believing that you've drawn each and
[5:40] every one of us, Father, to yourself.
[5:44] I pray that you would just bless each
[5:46] and every heart. Help us, Lord, to look
[5:49] to you, the author and finish of our
[5:51] faith this morning.
[5:53] Comfort our hearts concerning all of our
[5:55] burdens. Lord, I pray that your
[5:58] presence, your Holy Spirit, would sweep
[6:01] through this building this morning,
[6:03] Father, touch each and every heart, dear
[6:05] God, help us, Lord, save the sinner,
[6:08] heal the sick, encourage the weak and
[6:11] the feeble, dear God.
[6:14] Lord, that we could be that invincible
[6:16] army that you for ordained before the
[6:19] foundation of the world. As we collect
[6:22] the tithes and offerings, I pray that
[6:24] you bless the cheerful giver. Father,
[6:27] Lord, we remember those that are not
[6:28] here with us in body, but in spirit. We
[6:32] remember those that are streaming. Let
[6:35] there be something said, even if it's
[6:37] just one word, that would encourage and
[6:40] strengthen our hearts. Father, in Jesus
[6:43] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[6:46] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand. Amen.
[6:50] Happy to be in the house of the Lord,
[6:52] the key of G. Amen.
[6:56] Living below
[6:59] in this old sinful world.
[7:04] Hardly a comfort can afford
[7:11] striving
[7:13] alone
[7:14] to face temptation.
[7:17] So
[7:19] where could I go to the Lord? Everybody
[7:24] sing now. Say where.

[15:52] to count for something
[15:58] to leave their mark

[19:11] No need to add
[19:14] [Applause]
[19:15] to worldly riches.
[19:18] [Music]
[19:20] I only seek
[19:26] eternal gain.

[31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So thankful for that.
[31:33] He lives not not off someplace far away,
[31:39] but he he lives right here amongst his
[31:41] people. and not just amongst his people.
[31:44] He's living in his people.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the one that's made the
[31:48] change. He's the one that's working out
[31:50] his perfect will and character and life
[31:53] within us. I'm so thankful for that.
[31:56] Amen. It's not just a matter of what
[31:59] someone else has told me, but I'm a
[32:01] witness of his resurrection because his
[32:04] resurrection has taken place in me.
[32:07] Amen. So thankful for that and so
[32:10] thankful to be with you here this
[32:13] morning.
[32:14] And uh we're going to go directly to the
[32:16] word. Want to speak on the subject love
[32:19] is not always love.
[32:25] And um I think this is the fifth fifth
[32:30] time I've spoken this in uh two and a
[32:34] half weeks. My my family's heard that uh
[32:38] four times. This will be the fourth
[32:39] time. So, the Lord has something for us
[32:42] to learn, I believe, even when we hear
[32:44] the same message over and over again.
[32:46] And if you listen to me streaming
[32:48] somewhere before, praise the Lord. Keep
[32:51] pulling on the word and maybe you'll
[32:52] pull me in a direction that I never went
[32:54] thought I was going to go before. So,
[32:56] amen. First scripture I want to look at
[32:58] is in 1 John chapter 4
[33:04] uh verse 16
[33:11] and we we have known and believed the
[33:15] love that God hath to us. God is love
[33:20] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[33:23] God and God in him. May the Lord add the
[33:26] blessing to the reading of his word. You
[33:28] can be seated.
[33:32] Amen. So God is love
[33:36] and then he that dwelleth in love is is
[33:38] dwelling in God and God is dwelling in
[33:41] him. So we see then the importance of
[33:44] love. But even even more and deeper than
[33:47] that is that we need to understand the
[33:50] what love actually is because not all
[33:54] things that we as humans as Americans as
[33:56] English speakers call love are actually
[33:59] love.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; And so not all love is God.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; God is love. But not all love as we
[34:06] define it and as we speak about it is
[34:09] God. And this is the place that people
[34:11] are so confused in our modern culture uh
[34:15] especially in America amongst people and
[34:18] then it then it is sort of becomes
[34:20] different sayings that people have and
[34:22] then it becomes some people's religion
[34:24] based on those sayings and they they say
[34:27] things like um love is love
[34:31] and then well what do you mean by that?
[34:33] What are you talking about? Of course,
[34:34] it's got got nice rainbow uh colors on
[34:38] the statement that love is love. And
[34:40] they've taken and stolen the sign of
[34:42] God's covenant to place it onto
[34:45] something that's so uh wicked and
[34:47] perverted as the homosexual movement.
[34:50] And love is not always love. Many times
[34:52] what people call love is actually evil
[34:55] and is actually hateful and is actually
[34:57] damaging to people's lives. And there's
[35:00] a great danger in that. And so when we
[35:02] think of that, think of love, we really
[35:04] have to think about as Christians in
[35:06] this hour when somebody says, "Oh,
[35:09] they're using actually as a weapon to
[35:11] control you."
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? That the word love
[35:16] has been weaponized to control whether
[35:19] or not you speak the truth.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; To control whether or not you confront
[35:24] over sin. Here's another great saying
[35:26] that we have that ties into it. Judge
[35:29] not. Don't judge me
[35:31] &gt;&gt; now. Don't judge me. Okay, we're judging
[35:34] you. You just you just gave us uh uh our
[35:38] antennas now that we must judge what
[35:40] this person is saying.
[35:43] The spiritual man judges all things, yet
[35:45] he himself is judged of no man. And not
[35:48] only that, but finish the statement of
[35:50] what Jesus says, the entire paragraph of
[35:53] what he's speaking about about judge
[35:54] not. He says because with what measure
[35:57] that you meet, the same will be measured
[35:59] back to you. So if we're measuring it by
[36:01] the word, which is what we all should
[36:03] be, not our own judgment, not our own
[36:05] thoughts, not our own ideas, but
[36:06] measuring it by the word, then we have
[36:09] some good judgment happening. And that's
[36:11] what that's what we're required to do.
[36:14] And so if I if I can
[36:18] put forward what I'm going to speak
[36:19] about at the end just to give you a give
[36:22] you a picture as we're going into it is
[36:24] love is not love unless it's ordered
[36:26] properly.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Love is not love unless there's correct
[36:33] boundaries
[36:36] &gt;&gt; and and a correct understanding of the
[36:39] orders. And we'll talk about that more.
[36:40] I don't want to get so far ahead of
[36:42] myself. But so God is love. But do you
[36:45] know that's not the only thing that God
[36:47] is.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; So God is love. It's not that God has
[36:50] love or God becomes love or God God
[36:54] loves. God is love. That's that's who he
[36:59] is. That's his character. That's his
[37:02] nature. That's his identity. So if
[37:06] unless we're defining love based upon
[37:08] what God is, then we're actually missing
[37:12] the entire picture. Secondly, John also
[37:14] tells us that God is light and in him is
[37:17] no darkness at all.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; And then third, the Lord Jesus tells us
[37:22] that God is spirit. I know we have in
[37:25] our King James it says God is a spirit,
[37:27] but it literally is God is spirit.
[37:30] That's what God is. And so if we can
[37:32] understand the the the nature and the
[37:35] characteristics and the attributes of
[37:37] God, all of those characteristics and
[37:40] that attributes flow out of God being
[37:44] love and light and spirit.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; And so being that he's light, it can't
[37:51] there can't be any shades of of darkness
[37:54] in him. So God's love is not accepting
[37:58] darkness,
[38:00] right? It's light that's penetrating.
[38:02] It's light that's holy. It's light and
[38:08] love together that's good. And so in
[38:11] order for God to be good, if God has a
[38:13] standard a standard and someone comes
[38:16] against that standard, then God must
[38:18] move against the person who's coming
[38:21] against his standard.
[38:23] He un unless we understand God who God
[38:27] is in the fullness of his nature. If we
[38:29] have an approach to God where we where
[38:32] we hear people say, you know, I just
[38:35] couldn't see Jesus saying that to a
[38:37] person after after saying some
[38:39] convicting words, something that's
[38:42] direct and to the point. I couldn't see
[38:44] Jesus saying that.
[38:47] You can tell that somebody's never read
[38:49] the Bible
[38:51] when they say things like that because
[38:52] there's about 10 to 15 circumstances of
[38:56] Jesus directly calling people names
[39:01] &gt;&gt; and mocking them
[39:04] &gt;&gt; and even the prophets themselves mocking
[39:06] evil and mocking the devil.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; And so
[39:11] by our terms and standards, not very
[39:13] nice, right? not not very loving. Don't
[39:17] Jesus would never say anything like that
[39:21] to sinners. He said, "Unless you you
[39:25] think the people there that the Tower of
[39:27] Saleom fell on were such wicked sinners
[39:30] more than everybody else, but I tell
[39:32] you, unless you repent,
[39:34] &gt;&gt; you will all likewise perish." In other
[39:36] words, he's telling you the tower should
[39:38] fall on you also.
[39:41] Don't think, don't think because the
[39:43] tower fell on them that you don't
[39:44] deserve the same, that you're somehow
[39:47] better than them. No, absolutely not.
[39:50] You deserve exactly the same. You
[39:51] deserve God's just wrath and punishment.
[39:55] And un unless we understand that very
[39:58] basic point, then we've never even we
[40:01] never even heard the gospel. We never
[40:02] have understood the gospel.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:06] We could never have a true understanding
[40:07] of repentance unless we understand our
[40:09] own sinfulness and our own sinful nature
[40:12] and our own need to submit our thoughts
[40:15] and our lives completely to him.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; It's not just a matter of God is love
[40:20] and he just okays everything that we do.
[40:23] You don't even know God.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Exodus 34
[40:28] verse 6. I love this because Moses asks
[40:32] the Lord, I want to see your glory. And
[40:36] this is a place where he takes Moses and
[40:38] he puts him in the cliff of the rock and
[40:40] Moses just sees the back parts of the
[40:42] Lord. Right? And I find it so astounding
[40:45] because it was it's not as though
[40:48] the Lord came and said,
[40:51] "Just see my uh manifestation. That's
[40:54] enough to see my glory." It's actually
[40:57] not enough. Many people were in brother
[40:59] Brandham's meetings and saw the pillar
[41:01] of fire and they got healed and they
[41:03] never got saved
[41:05] &gt;&gt; and they're in hell today because they
[41:07] never repented and gave their lives to
[41:09] the Lord. There's people that I mean
[41:12] they all perished in the wilderness. We
[41:14] hear that and our fathers did eat mana
[41:16] in the wilderness and Jesus says they're
[41:18] everyone dead. Guess what? They saw the
[41:21] pillar of fire come down and light up a
[41:23] whole mountain and the voice of the
[41:25] words speaking to them and it still
[41:29] &gt;&gt; wasn't enough because they didn't even
[41:32] that in that in that case we could say
[41:34] they saw his glory. It's got to go
[41:37] beyond just that.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; The Lord passed by before him and
[41:42] proclaimed. So there has to be a
[41:44] proclamation. There has to be a voice go
[41:47] along with the presence. If there's not
[41:49] a voice that goes along with the
[41:50] presence, the presence will not do you
[41:52] any good. There has to be a word that
[41:55] goes forth. And then it has to go
[41:56] further than that because the people
[41:58] heard the words and they all perished in
[41:59] the wilderness. It has to go to
[42:02] spiritual revelation to your heart. The
[42:04] proclamation has to go from out there to
[42:06] in here.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; And so he comes forth. I want to see the
[42:10] glory of the Lord. The Lord passes by
[42:13] and what he what does he do? That's it.
[42:15] No, he proclaims. So the Lord himself is
[42:19] going to proclaim Yahweh Jehovah,
[42:23] Yahweh Elohim, the Lord God. And then he
[42:26] then he goes off and he begins to give
[42:28] us a list of attributes so that we would
[42:32] understand who he is. Merciful and
[42:35] gracious,
[42:36] long-suffering, patient, patient,
[42:39] and abundant in goodness and truth,
[42:44] keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving
[42:47] iniquity and transgression and sin.
[42:50] Amen. We want it to stop there. But if
[42:53] we stop there, then we don't even know
[42:55] who God is.
[42:57] and that will by no means clear the
[42:59] guilty, visiting the iniquity of the
[43:01] fathers upon the children and upon the
[43:04] children's children unto the third and
[43:06] to the fourth generation. So, in order
[43:08] to really understand God's love, we also
[43:10] have to understand he's a God of of
[43:13] wrath. He's a God of judgment. And so,
[43:16] right here when he gives his he starts
[43:19] out with those things which which we
[43:22] view and look at as the things we're in
[43:25] great need of, right? We're all in need
[43:27] of those things. And yet the other part,
[43:29] without the other part, the first part
[43:32] doesn't make any sense without
[43:34] understanding that God does not clear
[43:36] the guilty. How is it possible? He says
[43:38] he forgives iniquity and transgression
[43:40] in sin. And then in the next voice, next
[43:43] in the same sentence, he says, "I don't
[43:45] clear the guilty and I visit your sins
[43:49] upon the uh your children and to your
[43:52] grandchildren and to your
[43:54] great-grandchildren." My goodness. So,
[43:56] how does that work?
[43:58] &gt;&gt; God always has a means to to break the
[44:01] chains. God always has a means to stop
[44:04] the sin from passing to generation to
[44:06] generation. God always has a means to
[44:09] clear the guilty. But he won't just
[44:11] automatically do it. You have to come
[44:14] his way. You have to approach him. It
[44:17] has to come in repentance and faith
[44:20] and and uh getting immersed in water in
[44:24] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[44:25] being filled with the Holy Ghost. And so
[44:28] there you have to come his way for your
[44:31] guilt to be cleared.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so there's there's there is a
[44:36] a clear delineation that God is making
[44:39] when he's putting in this. God himself
[44:42] has boundaries
[44:45] to his love. You say his love is
[44:47] eternal. It's it's it goes on forever.
[44:51] It never changes. Absolutely correct.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; And yet he also has boundaries. And he
[44:57] says, "If you do this, then this is
[44:59] going to come."
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. and and the great deception
[45:03] that the children of Israel had and that
[45:05] the pe the prophets in the days of uh
[45:08] Isaiah and Jeremiah and Ezekiel, all of
[45:12] them said, "No, no, God's not going to
[45:13] send us out of the land." It says right
[45:16] in the word, "If you don't obey the
[45:19] scriptures, I will send you forth out of
[45:21] the land." And here you have the
[45:23] prophets, thus sayeth the Lord, you
[45:24] shall not be driven out of the land. God
[45:26] God sees and knows everything that's
[45:29] going on and he will deliver us out of
[45:31] their hands. And the and the true
[45:32] prophets are saying, "Thus sayith the
[45:33] Lord, you're gone. You're finished."
[45:37] And what's God calling to them to
[45:39] repent? So what's the devil calling them
[45:41] to do? Don't repent.
[45:44] You're fine just like you are. Just stay
[45:45] this way. And God is saying there's a
[45:48] there's a pathway just as he says
[45:50] through Jeremiah. If at any time that I
[45:53] prophesy and I speak forth and say that
[45:56] this nation will be plucked up, if they
[45:59] listen and hear that and repent, then I
[46:01] will repent of the word that I spoke to
[46:03] them.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Right through the prophet, he explains
[46:06] that to them and the people and the
[46:08] people of Israel just say there's no
[46:10] need for repentance. We're the chosen
[46:12] people.
[46:14] What an attitude. Many, many times in
[46:17] the message, we have the same attitude.
[46:18] We are the message believers. We're the
[46:20] greatest believers of all time.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; There's no one been ever been like us
[46:24] before.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Unless you repent, you'll also perish.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; As brother Brad was speaking about
[46:35] humility this morning, we that's that's
[46:38] what we need. That's what God's looking
[46:39] for.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; All right, I better keep going. I'll
[46:42] never get anywhere.
[46:45] Again, we have to see the balance in who
[46:48] God is. If we don't rightly see the
[46:52] balance in who God is, we'll never
[46:54] understand what love is. And ultimately,
[46:57] we'll never know God himself.
[47:02] In adoption number four, brother
[47:03] Brandham says, "I said, 'Oh Lord, that's
[47:05] what I'm here at the church for, trying
[47:06] to set the church in order, telling you,
[47:08] brother and sister, there's only one
[47:10] thing can enter that. That's perfect
[47:12] love. Not because you're loyal loyal to
[47:15] Brandham Tabernacle or the Methodist
[47:16] Church or Baptist Church. Them's all
[47:19] right. Or we could say the message
[47:20] churches.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Them's all right. You should be. But oh
[47:24] friends, you've got not because you
[47:26] spoke with tongues, danced in the
[47:27] spirit, because you cast out devils, or
[47:29] moved mountains with faith. That's all
[47:31] right. For that's all right. But still,
[47:33] unless that real perfect love is in
[47:36] there, that was where perfect love was.
[47:38] He's talking about the the the uh beyond
[47:40] the curtain of time. That's where
[47:42] perfect love was. And that's the only
[47:44] thing that'll let you in there. That's
[47:47] the only thing that can stay there. It's
[47:49] the only thing that there was there. Oh
[47:51] my. It's an adoption. God before the
[47:55] foundation of the world. And how
[47:57] &gt;&gt; critical that is perfect love. And
[47:59] again, we can we can say this church
[48:02] preaches love and we can mean something
[48:04] completely different
[48:06] &gt;&gt; than the scripture. or this church is
[48:08] loving and we can mean something
[48:10] entirely different than what the word
[48:12] says. And that's that's the great danger
[48:16] that is posed by the work of the enemy
[48:19] is that people think that they know what
[48:20] love is without searching it by the
[48:23] scriptures and seeing what it actually
[48:25] and truly is. I love this
[48:28] next uh series of verses. John
[48:32] 21 verse 15. It's amazing.
[48:37] the Peter. This is this is the
[48:39] circumstance that Christ has been raised
[48:41] from the dead. They're out fishing and
[48:44] Jesus comes to them and Peter throws on
[48:47] his fisherman's coat, jumps in the
[48:48] water, swims there and all all of them
[48:51] come in and there's waiting fish
[48:53] sandwich
[48:54] cooking over the coals that Jesus had
[48:57] spoken into existence. And there he is.
[49:00] And this after this happens, he has a
[49:03] conversation with Peter. And again, this
[49:06] is the man that had great words that he
[49:11] would never
[49:13] deny the Lord Jesus, that he would go to
[49:15] the very ends with him, that he would
[49:17] surrender himself completely, and that
[49:20] he he he would die with him if it had to
[49:23] be. Right? And then as the Lord Jesus
[49:27] said, "Satan has desired to sift you as
[49:30] wheat, but I've prayed for you that your
[49:32] faith would fail you not." Amen. And so
[49:37] Peter goes and right in front of the
[49:40] Lord Jesus denies him the third time.
[49:44] And and what epic failure after amazing
[49:48] words were spoken,
[49:50] great commitments were made by mouth.
[49:54] And yet the life didn't line up with it.
[49:58] What he did didn't line up with the
[50:00] commitment that he felt that he made.
[50:03] And so now we have a different Peter. We
[50:06] don't have the same blustery Peter,
[50:08] loudmouth Peter. We have a Peter that's
[50:10] been thoroughly humbled.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; And look at and Jesus is humbling him
[50:16] further and pointing it out. So when
[50:19] they had dying, Jesus saith to Simon
[50:21] Peter, Simon son of Jonas lovest or the
[50:24] word agape. Agape thou me more than
[50:27] these. So we'll get into definitions
[50:30] later, but just think of it as brother
[50:32] Bandham said, divine love. Agape is
[50:34] divine lovestape
[50:37] thou me more than these? He saith unto
[50:40] him, yay, Lord, thou knowest that I
[50:43] felio thee.
[50:46] So, Filelio, of course, is speaking of
[50:48] friendship or fondness. So, he's Lord,
[50:52] you you know that I'm fond of you. He
[50:55] saith unto him, "Feed my lambs." And and
[50:58] that that statement here by the Lord
[51:02] Jesus is re reaffirming Peter. Look at
[51:06] Peter. Does he deserve in his current
[51:09] condition for the Lord Jesus sake, go
[51:11] and be the pastor?
[51:14] I'm leaving. You're in charge. You
[51:16] preach to the people.
[51:18] This is this is this should shock and
[51:21] jar us. We know the history 2,000 years
[51:24] later. But put yourself in that moment.
[51:27] This is the man who was so weak that he
[51:31] he after all his promises, he denied the
[51:35] Lord Jesus.
[51:37] He refused to even say, "I know him."
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Let alone anything beyond that. And so
[51:43] here he is. He's speaking to Peter.
[51:46] Number one, he's revealing to Peter his
[51:48] own heart. And number two is he's
[51:51] saying,"I
[51:52] know all that. And yet I see something
[51:55] way beyond
[51:57] what you even know you're capable of.
[52:00] I'm seeing something. See a bigger
[52:02] picture. I'm seeing the place that I'm
[52:03] calling you to. Not just where you are
[52:05] in this moment. In this moment, no,
[52:07] you're in not any condition to this, but
[52:10] I see something bigger. I see something
[52:12] deeper. I see a a higher calling that I
[52:16] have for you. And it's in you to do it.
[52:20] My goodness. Talk about amazing grace.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Verse 16, he saith to him again the
[52:25] second time, Simon son of Jonas, agape,
[52:29] thou me? He saith unto him, Yay, Lord,
[52:32] thou knowest that I feel ow thee.
[52:36] He saith unto him, feed my sheep. So
[52:40] again, we're we're repeating. I believe
[52:43] there's a there's a third one. I believe
[52:44] this is a a triple reinforcement to the
[52:48] triple denial. Amen.
[52:51] Because he he's he's saying to Peter, I
[52:55] know I know I see you. I see what I've
[52:58] made you to be. And I see that there's
[53:00] more for you to enter enter into. And
[53:02] I'm speaking the word over you that's
[53:04] going to carry. Because we we just look
[53:05] at this. Jesus knows he's omn omnisient.
[53:09] He knows everything and he just says
[53:11] what's going to happen. Don't you
[53:13] realize that God has put us in this same
[53:15] position
[53:16] &gt;&gt; for one another, for our children,
[53:19] &gt;&gt; for the believers that are around us? We
[53:21] can speak the word that carries them
[53:24] further than they ever really knew that
[53:26] they could go themselves.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; That's this is agape love. Now Jesus is
[53:32] demonstrating what agape love is. And
[53:35] Peter is humbling himself saying,"I I I
[53:37] don't I know I don't have the strength
[53:39] to even claim divine love. I'm not
[53:43] claiming agape love." Yeah, I'm fond of
[53:44] you. I'm here, right?
[53:47] Feed my sheep. It's a shocking
[53:50] statement. He saith unto him the third
[53:53] time, Simon son of Jonest, feel thou me?
[53:57] Are you even fond of me, Peter?
[54:00] &gt;&gt; I mean, this is cutting right to the
[54:02] heart of Peter.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:06] Peter was grieved because he said unto
[54:08] him the third time, Filelio, thou me.
[54:11] And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest
[54:14] all things. Thou knowest that I felio
[54:16] thee. Jesus saith unto him, feed my
[54:20] sheep.
[54:24] Verily, verily, I say unto thee, when
[54:26] thouast young, thou gest thyself, and
[54:29] walkest wither thou wouldest. When
[54:31] you're young, you did whatever you
[54:33] wanted to. You didn't s you didn't
[54:35] surrender yourself to the Lord. You just
[54:38] thought what you wanted to do and you
[54:40] went and you just did it.
[54:43] But when you're when you shall be old, I
[54:45] mean, think of it in the terms of you
[54:47] denied me three times. Put it against
[54:49] like that. You did what you wanted. You
[54:51] protected yourself. You saved yourself
[54:54] and denied me. You went wherever you
[54:57] wanted to. But when you're old, you'll
[54:59] stretch forth your hands, and another
[55:02] shall guard thee, and carry thee whether
[55:05] thou wouldest not. So what is being said
[55:08] here? You failed before
[55:10] &gt;&gt; by doing your own will. Here, you're
[55:13] going to surrender yourself completely
[55:15] and you won't fail and you'll go with me
[55:18] to the cross
[55:19] &gt;&gt; there when you're old. And so if we can
[55:22] really understand that even in the
[55:23] context of agape love is agape love is a
[55:28] full surrender to the will and purpose
[55:30] of God. We give ourselves over
[55:32] completely to him. Not knowing what the
[55:35] results are, not knowing what's going to
[55:37] happen, but giving ourselves totally
[55:40] over to him so that he can have his way
[55:43] with us.
[55:46] And even if you can can look at it,
[55:48] God's love towards us calls us to
[55:50] something a lot more than we think of
[55:53] ourselves.
[55:55] A whole lot more than we think of
[55:57] ourselves. And and that's amazing
[55:59] because that's the love that's supposed
[56:02] to be shed abroad in our hearts by the
[56:04] Holy Ghost is the kind of love that sees
[56:07] something in someone. I mean, you look
[56:09] at this. You look at the Corinthians.
[56:12] This is another expression of agape love
[56:15] in the Apostle Paul.
[56:19] I read the I read 1 and 2 Corinthians
[56:21] and by the time I'm done, these rotten
[56:24] knuckleheads, what are they doing?
[56:26] They've got they got to they got to rely
[56:28] on Paul to do everything. And here they
[56:31] are. They got all this sin and
[56:33] perversion in in the church, and they're
[56:35] not even doing anything about it. They
[56:36] just let it continue on.
[56:38] And Paul has to make the decision for
[56:40] him. And at the end of the day, what is
[56:43] what does Paul say? He says, "I have
[56:45] confidence in you
[56:48] that the God within you, that the Holy
[56:51] Ghost within you will bring you to the
[56:54] right thing." And I'm like, "Paul,
[56:55] that's a mistaken, misplaced confidence,
[56:58] my friend. What are we doing?" And yet
[57:00] we understand they you read second
[57:02] Corinthians and they did do the right
[57:03] thing and they did put the sin out from
[57:06] from among them and they did follow the
[57:09] order that Paul gave by the scriptures
[57:11] and it's it's what the Lord wants that's
[57:14] the vision I believe that the Lord wants
[57:17] us to have of one another. Yes, we can
[57:20] acknow Jesus is not denying that Peter
[57:23] was a mess.
[57:25] In fact, he was hitting him literally
[57:27] between the eyes and telling them,
[57:30] "Enter into what I have for you. Enter
[57:32] into more. There's that more. There's a
[57:34] higher place that God has for you.
[57:36] There's a deeper walk that he has for
[57:38] you. There's a higher revelation.
[57:40] There's a higher position that he's
[57:42] calling called you into. Keep going
[57:44] forward.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Feed my sheep."
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Peter Pet uh Lord Lord Jesus um I have
[57:51] to have a word here. Peter has
[57:53] disqualified himself from ministry. He's
[57:56] shown himself as completely unfaithful.
[57:59] And I have to say, I can never look upon
[58:01] him as a minister again. That's how we
[58:03] do.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; And we have a 50/50 chance. Maybe we're
[58:14] right. But maybe the words that we
[58:17] speak,
[58:19] God will take them, plant that in a
[58:22] person's soul and use them and carry
[58:25] them to a pl a level that we never
[58:27] imagined that they could go to. You by
[58:30] your words have the power of life.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Romans 12
[58:38] verse 9. And let love, this is the word
[58:41] agape, let agape be without
[58:44] dissimulation.
[58:46] Dissimulation
[58:47] is something that's like concealment of
[58:50] the opinions, sentiments or purpose. It
[58:53] includes the assuming of a false or
[58:55] counterfeit counterfeit appearance which
[58:58] conceals the real opinions or purpose.
[59:02] It's fake is what it's saying.
[59:05] It's don't have a fake love. Don't have
[59:09] a pretend love. Don't say things that
[59:12] you actually don't mean. Say what you
[59:15] mean and do what you say. That's love.
[59:19] Otherwise, it's just like a fake.
[59:21] Another way to look at this is like, you
[59:23] know, in boxing when they throw a fake
[59:25] punch just to throw him off and then hit
[59:26] him here. That's don't love like that.
[59:30] Don't love with a fake punch.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Let it be real. Let it be genuine. Then
[59:36] right along with love, we understand
[59:39] abhore that which is evil.
[59:42] So for love to be correct, there also
[59:45] has to be hatred.
[59:52] Strange. How can it be? How can that be
[59:55] the case? Because we love even our
[59:59] enemies, right?
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Are our enemies evil? I hope so. Oh, I
[1:00:03] hope they're not good.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; If your enemies are good, then you may
[1:00:07] want to look in the mirror a little bit
[1:00:09] and find out if you're good or evil.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; But if if our enemies are evil, right,
[1:00:18] then what's going on here? Love
[1:00:22] our enemies. There's a there's a vast
[1:00:25] difference between abhoring that which
[1:00:28] is evil and abhoring that who is evil.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? The person themselves is
[1:00:35] doing evil, but God doesn't call you to
[1:00:39] hate people that are evil. It it calls
[1:00:43] He calls you to hate what they do.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; And he calls you even to have boundaries
[1:00:49] in your life to prevent it from
[1:00:51] negatively impacting you in a way that
[1:00:54] would damage your own faith and your own
[1:00:57] spiritual health. Now, there's some
[1:00:59] people they have a very high calling,
[1:01:01] right? and they they can take that evil
[1:01:05] that that person is doing in such a way.
[1:01:08] But most of us are not in that
[1:01:10] condition. We have to have a a strict
[1:01:14] boundary and not let evil get close to
[1:01:16] us because it will drag us down to the
[1:01:18] pit with it. But there are specific
[1:01:21] gifted people that can go into the face
[1:01:22] of evil and deal with it
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; in such a way that it would it would
[1:01:28] bring deliverance.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; And freedom. I believe the Lord's
[1:01:32] calling us all to be that person.
[1:01:35] But I also I also know we also have to
[1:01:38] understand our own weakness. Right.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Sure. Amen.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; You know, it's it talks about that
[1:01:45] saving the person who's going into the
[1:01:48] fire but hating even the garment that's
[1:01:51] stained by sin, right? And so, wow,
[1:01:55] you're you're sa you're you're putting
[1:01:56] yourself at risk to to save someone
[1:02:00] while also hating their garments,
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; which speaks of their works,
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; what they've clothed their lives with.
[1:02:08] And so, my goodness, let's let's come up
[1:02:11] with a 10step plan to figure that out. I
[1:02:14] think it's going to take the Holy Spirit
[1:02:16] in you
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; to accomplish such a thing and a lot of
[1:02:20] prayer
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; because it it it's a huge balance to
[1:02:25] have in all of that to hate what is evil
[1:02:28] and love your enemy who's evil.
[1:02:31] But again, it has to be there because if
[1:02:33] it's not, we will ourselves be polluted
[1:02:36] by sin and evil.
[1:02:39] Then it says, "Cleave or hold closely to
[1:02:42] that which is good." Again, these aren't
[1:02:46] just a bunch of sentences that are
[1:02:48] randomly picked by some algorithm and
[1:02:51] thrown out there. This is Paul writing
[1:02:53] very specific instructions that are
[1:02:55] meant to be close together. For love to
[1:02:57] be without fakeness and falseness, we
[1:02:59] have to hate that which is evil and
[1:03:01] cleave to that which is good. Otherwise,
[1:03:03] it will be a disordered and perverted
[1:03:05] love.
[1:03:08] be kindly affectioned
[1:03:10] one to another with brotherly love in
[1:03:13] honor preferring one another. So in in
[1:03:17] these two verses it has all three kinds
[1:03:19] of love that are spoken of in the New
[1:03:22] Testament. There is a fourth one that
[1:03:24] the New Testament doesn't speak about
[1:03:25] but it's in the it's in the Greek
[1:03:27] language which we'll speak about in a
[1:03:28] moment. But here it says be kindly
[1:03:31] affectioned one to another. This is the
[1:03:33] word fileo stoos. So it's combining two
[1:03:37] different kinds of love into one word.
[1:03:38] Felio which is friendship or fondness
[1:03:42] and stoay which speaks of family love or
[1:03:45] you can call it affection as they
[1:03:48] translate it there kindly affectioned.
[1:03:50] And then the other one is brotherly
[1:03:52] love. We're all familiar with that.
[1:03:53] That's Philadelphia.
[1:03:55] All right. So you have agape fileio sto
[1:04:00] spoken of there. And the fourth type of
[1:04:03] love, I can't remember my next screen.
[1:04:06] Yeah. And the fourth time type of love
[1:04:09] is called aeros or romantic or as we
[1:04:13] call it in our day and age, falling in
[1:04:15] love.
[1:04:18] And so as we look at this, we got we
[1:04:20] have divine love, we have friendship, we
[1:04:24] have affection or family. Stoay is like
[1:04:28] someone you're in close contact with
[1:04:31] that you have affection towards. And
[1:04:34] then romantic love aeros. So the number
[1:04:38] two, number three, and number four,
[1:04:40] these are all
[1:04:42] human loves.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Love on a human level. And that doesn't
[1:04:48] mean they're bad,
[1:04:50] right? We look at them and say they're
[1:04:52] human loves. We we have to rise above
[1:04:54] all this and have agape. That's true.
[1:04:56] And yet these are things that God
[1:04:59] designed us to be a part of. If you
[1:05:02] remember, one of the curses of the last
[1:05:04] days is that people would be without
[1:05:06] natural affections.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; And so God God put us in bodies to have
[1:05:12] this. And that's a whole sermon in
[1:05:13] itself. But God puts us in these bodies
[1:05:17] and we're in a certain family and we're
[1:05:19] connected to a certain area and we're
[1:05:20] connected to a certain church and people
[1:05:22] around us and people that we work with
[1:05:24] and so forth and someone that we marry.
[1:05:28] All of these different things. And these
[1:05:29] are human loves that he wants us to ha
[1:05:32] wants us to have and expects us to
[1:05:34] naturally have. Each of them would be
[1:05:37] things that are important parts of the
[1:05:39] human life. without them human life
[1:05:43] would be utterly intolerable and
[1:05:45] impossible. So we can't look at it as oh
[1:05:48] these are bad.
[1:05:50] If we look at the stature of the perfect
[1:05:52] man what's before agape Philadelphia
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; filio love. So even even within that the
[1:05:58] Holy Spirit is working within our hearts
[1:06:01] to bring us to a place where we have the
[1:06:03] right kind of friendship one to another
[1:06:07] and sto and aeros all of these different
[1:06:10] things. If we think about aeros I'll
[1:06:13] just take a few minutes to to comment on
[1:06:15] this.
[1:06:17] If if we look at this romantic type of
[1:06:20] love that we have it's a good thing.
[1:06:24] It's a positive thing. Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; It is part of the human experience.
[1:06:28] Without it, there would be no more
[1:06:30] children. You wouldn't be here today
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; if there wasn't such a thing called
[1:06:34] aeros love. Uh
[1:06:38] and so God has designed us in such a way
[1:06:42] that our bodies work and we will fall in
[1:06:45] love with someone. And we but the
[1:06:48] problem is is that in America and this
[1:06:50] is kind of the problem all in all in
[1:06:52] love is that culture tries to define
[1:06:55] actually what love is and they flip it
[1:06:58] upside down and they put aos love is the
[1:07:02] god that rules this earth and they put
[1:07:05] this as the most important thing and
[1:07:07] when you fall in love you have to obey
[1:07:09] that and so when love as CS Lewis says
[1:07:13] when love reaches its height it ceases
[1:07:17] to be a god and it turns into a demon
[1:07:21] because it takes it takes control. It
[1:07:23] overrides any other thing, any other
[1:07:26] connection, any truth, goodness,
[1:07:29] anything I have to do. I have to obey
[1:07:32] this sensation of falling in love. And
[1:07:36] again, the the human life
[1:07:40] you can this falling in love can go in a
[1:07:42] thousand different directions.
[1:07:45] It can go in the right direction and it
[1:07:46] can go in wrong directions. That's what
[1:07:49] we see many times. a ma a man is at
[1:07:52] working in close proximity at a job and
[1:07:54] he's has a secretary and they work in
[1:07:57] close proximity and they're talking to
[1:07:58] each other all the time and they're
[1:07:59] telling about each other's lives and
[1:08:01] then suddenly they're sharing their
[1:08:02] hearts and then the next thing you know
[1:08:05] they're shacking up together.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Because they fell in love. I'm leaving
[1:08:09] you because I just don't love you
[1:08:11] anymore. And this is the level of idiocy
[1:08:14] that we've reached in in our day today
[1:08:18] because they have no understanding of
[1:08:19] what love is. They think it's a feeling,
[1:08:21] an emotion. It's something comes over
[1:08:23] you. We don't have any control about it.
[1:08:25] It's like a virus. It's like COVID 19.
[1:08:28] We don't have any control over it. It
[1:08:29] just comes and what do we do? What do we
[1:08:31] do? I mean, what would you do? I fell in
[1:08:32] love with this person. Well,
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; tell yourself to stop.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; I couldn't do that. Well, we live in a
[1:08:39] world with people that have no
[1:08:41] self-control. That's true.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; But if you're a Christian, one of the
[1:08:45] fruits of the spirit is self-control.
[1:08:46] And those things can happen to
[1:08:47] Christians. You can work in close
[1:08:49] proximity to a sister or to a brother
[1:08:51] and there maybe there's a problem in
[1:08:54] your marriage and your husband or your
[1:08:56] wife is not fulfilling something in your
[1:08:58] heart that's that's that's troubling you
[1:09:00] and instead of uh dealing with it
[1:09:03] one-on-one directly as husband and wife,
[1:09:06] you start uh catching feelings for
[1:09:08] someone that's not your spouse. And what
[1:09:11] do you do that? That should shock you so
[1:09:13] bad
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; that you'll drop everything to make it
[1:09:17] right with the Lord and with your
[1:09:20] spouse. Because the thing is, these
[1:09:22] things do happen. Let's not let's not
[1:09:25] get our halos so perfectly polished in
[1:09:28] one another's presence that we don't
[1:09:30] understand. These things happen. It
[1:09:31] happens in message churches. It happens
[1:09:34] to pastors at the pulpit falling in love
[1:09:37] with someone they're counseling.
[1:09:40] And what happens?
[1:09:42] You you have to have boundaries. You
[1:09:44] have to have you have to understand the
[1:09:46] limits. You have to know
[1:09:49] what love is.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; A person that had that really has love
[1:09:53] will understand and be like Joseph. And
[1:09:56] even if it leaves them naked, they run
[1:09:58] as fast as they can
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; and get out get out of the place.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Because it it is all of all of these
[1:10:05] things. And we've so deified it in
[1:10:07] Disney and Hallmark and all these
[1:10:09] different places that falling in love is
[1:10:11] the greatest thing that can ever happen
[1:10:12] to you. And it's wonderful as long as
[1:10:14] it's done right. If you're
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; if if you're little kids and you're 12
[1:10:20] years old and you fall in love and you
[1:10:22] obey the feelings of falling in love,
[1:10:24] there's something wrong. If it's
[1:10:26] especially if it's in a church, where
[1:10:28] are the parents? They should be involved
[1:10:29] with their kids to know what's happening
[1:10:31] in their hearts and in their minds.
[1:10:34] Amen.
[1:10:35] And then, you know, you you can take
[1:10:37] that and people can fall in love and
[1:10:39] they can get everything out of order and
[1:10:42] destroy their entire lives by falling in
[1:10:44] by by quote unquote falling in love.
[1:10:47] That's fine. It's good. It's good to
[1:10:51] fall in love. We thank the Lord for it.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; I thank the Lord for it or I wouldn't be
[1:10:56] here.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; But the issue is what do we do with
[1:11:01] that? Do we keep it in order? a a young
[1:11:05] a young lady and a young man. They start
[1:11:08] talking to each other. The young man
[1:11:10] gets permission from the young lady's
[1:11:12] father to speak with her and they begin
[1:11:15] to fall in love. And she keeps her
[1:11:17] boundaries. He keeps his boundaries. Dad
[1:11:20] is always communicating with the boy and
[1:11:22] with the girl. This is wonderful. Praise
[1:11:26] the Lord.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; None of none of us men of God would ever
[1:11:30] say this is bad. Don't do that.
[1:11:32] this is happy. This is joyful. Anytime
[1:11:35] you see, you know, a husband and wife
[1:11:37] joined together, uh that's that's a
[1:11:40] cause for rejoicing, especially when
[1:11:43] they're believers and they're walking
[1:11:44] with the Lord. It's this is amazing and
[1:11:47] we love that. But it when we keep it in
[1:11:50] the right boundaries following the word,
[1:11:53] that's when God can bless it in such in
[1:11:56] such a way that he would be glorified
[1:11:58] even in the midst of our aeros love.
[1:12:01] See, and I want to keep that in balance
[1:12:03] because we can speak about falling in
[1:12:05] love in such a way that we make
[1:12:07] everybody scared of it and nervous and
[1:12:10] well, you it's like a superpower that uh
[1:12:13] you have to be careful about you. It it
[1:12:17] uh it could make your life amazing
[1:12:21] or it could ruin the whole city.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; It could save the planet or it could
[1:12:28] destroy the universe.
[1:12:31] And so we have to realize that it's
[1:12:34] something that we don't we don't obey it
[1:12:37] apart from the word.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to leave that now.
[1:12:42] Human loves without its proper balance
[1:12:45] with divine love at the center of it end
[1:12:47] up being complicated forms of hatred.
[1:12:51] Think about it this way. When God tells
[1:12:54] a husband to love his wife, do you know
[1:12:56] what word they you that Paul uses to
[1:12:58] love his wife? Husbands, love your wives
[1:13:01] even as Christ loved the church. He
[1:13:02] doesn't use aeros.
[1:13:05] He uses agape love.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:13:10] we can fall in and out of love in our
[1:13:12] lives. And you're married and you've
[1:13:13] made a eternal commitment to your wife.
[1:13:16] Divorce is never an answer, never an
[1:13:18] answer, never an option. You're going to
[1:13:20] work through everything with all your
[1:13:22] heart.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Even then, you'll have times where aos
[1:13:26] is high and aos is low. Amen.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; These things the this this is normal.
[1:13:33] It's a part of the experience and young
[1:13:35] people should know that because when it
[1:13:36] happens you'll wonder am I getting a
[1:13:38] divorce? What's happening? No, you're a
[1:13:42] human being.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; You're living in a human body. No one
[1:13:46] can maintain a house love every day of
[1:13:49] their life. Otherwise, they'd never eat.
[1:13:51] They'd never sleep.
[1:13:55] They'd never get any ounce of work done.
[1:14:00] You're not meant to stay in that. And
[1:14:02] you have to understand that. And when
[1:14:04] you understand that, your life will be
[1:14:05] much happier.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Cuz because we look at it, love is a lot
[1:14:11] more than a feeling. Love is work. Love
[1:14:14] is action.
[1:14:16] All right. So let's think about some
[1:14:18] situations and circumstances where
[1:14:20] people speak about love in another way,
[1:14:23] in a family love.
[1:14:25] So consider a mother. She loves her son
[1:14:29] so much she just smothers him.
[1:14:33] She smothers him to with love to the
[1:14:36] point he literally can't function as a
[1:14:38] separate human being from his mother.
[1:14:41] She won't let him. She has a need in her
[1:14:44] heart
[1:14:46] for for some reason there's a lacking in
[1:14:48] her own heart that in order to feel uh
[1:14:52] complete as a human being. She has to do
[1:14:55] everything for her son and she has to
[1:14:56] control everything for her son. He
[1:15:00] doesn't know how to take care of
[1:15:01] himself. He isn't allowed for sure isn't
[1:15:04] allowed to find a wife because that
[1:15:05] would break his mother's heart.
[1:15:08] Everyone would say, "My goodness, this
[1:15:10] mother sure loves her son."
[1:15:14] But this is a kind of love that is
[1:15:17] choking all life out.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; This is a kind of love that's not
[1:15:21] allowing him to be a man. I would just
[1:15:23] say, "Where's dad?" Because a mother
[1:15:26] embraces
[1:15:28] and protects and nurtures and a father
[1:15:30] says, "Hey, son, you're going to be a
[1:15:31] man. Go work.
[1:15:35] Do something." And mom says, you say,
[1:15:38] "Quiet. Time for this kid to be a man."
[1:15:44] All right.
[1:15:46] I hate to always blame men for stuff,
[1:15:47] but we're kind of responsible for our
[1:15:49] homes.
[1:15:55] Amen. So, this isn't love. Not letting
[1:15:58] someone grow in their in their just in
[1:16:01] their human life
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; and independence.
[1:16:05] Uh, this isn't love.
[1:16:08] Again, it's a complicated form of
[1:16:10] hatred. Who who would look at this
[1:16:12] mother and tell her, "You don't love
[1:16:13] your son." She would say, "Are you
[1:16:15] crazy? I live for him. I literally live
[1:16:17] for him." And we say, "You're crazy,
[1:16:20] actually, cuz you don't even understand
[1:16:22] what love is. You think love is a form
[1:16:26] of holding an infant towards you, but
[1:16:29] this is a 13-year-old boy. This is
[1:16:31] weird.
[1:16:32] This is imbalance. This is out of order.
[1:16:40] Another situation you could consider a
[1:16:43] mother who lost her son in an early age
[1:16:46] and she has a family. She has a husband
[1:16:49] and she spends the rest of her life
[1:16:52] mourning and complaining about what has
[1:16:56] happened. Certainly, it's a horrible
[1:16:58] sorrow. Certainly, she needs counseling.
[1:17:00] She needs prayer. She needs love. But if
[1:17:04] she's drowning in her inner sorrow,
[1:17:06] making her husband miserable, her
[1:17:08] children miserable, and everyone else
[1:17:10] around her miserable, it's an imbalance.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; And everybody would say, "My goodness,
[1:17:17] she loved her son."
[1:17:20] Again,
[1:17:24] the son doesn't belong to mother. The
[1:17:26] son doesn't long belong to father. The
[1:17:28] son belongs to God. And God decided to
[1:17:32] take him. And it breaks our heart. And
[1:17:34] our hearts break together. But at some
[1:17:36] point, we have to just surrender and
[1:17:37] say, "Lord,
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; you want me to live my life for the rest
[1:17:42] of my family. You want me to take care
[1:17:45] of my husband, to take care of my my
[1:17:48] children, and to enjoy them." And so
[1:17:52] what what ends up happening is
[1:17:54] bitterness comes and what it is is an
[1:17:58] idol has been made out of that sun and
[1:18:01] everyone has to bow down to it. And if
[1:18:03] you don't, you'll find out quick that
[1:18:05] you've committed blasphemy.
[1:18:09] And again, these are difficult
[1:18:10] circumstances and situations, no doubt,
[1:18:12] without question. And we all go through
[1:18:14] difficult circumstances
[1:18:16] and and trials, but we have to see God's
[1:18:19] big picture. And we have to ask the Lord
[1:18:21] to help us to see the situation through
[1:18:24] his eyes,
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; not merely through our own eyes.
[1:18:28] Another thing you could consider a
[1:18:30] father that dotes on spends all his time
[1:18:32] protecting and guarding his daughters
[1:18:34] without allowing them to grow. He's
[1:18:36] focusing all his energy on loving his
[1:18:38] daughter
[1:18:40] without spending any time and energy
[1:18:43] loving his wife.
[1:18:46] Now if he had love in his heart, true
[1:18:48] love in his heart, he would understand
[1:18:51] that the best way to love and protect
[1:18:55] his daughter is to
[1:18:58] show how much you love her mother. That
[1:19:01] that would come first before anything
[1:19:03] else.
[1:19:04] And this instinct to protect and guard
[1:19:07] your daughter is a good thing. But when
[1:19:09] it stifles her growth, stifer stifles
[1:19:12] her ability to become a woman, it's not
[1:19:15] love anymore.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; So if if we look at this,
[1:19:27] love often
[1:19:29] claims for itself divine authority.
[1:19:31] Actually, it almost always does.
[1:19:34] When when people speak of love, they
[1:19:38] look at it and they say,
[1:19:40] "This is this is everything. This means
[1:19:43] everything.
[1:19:44] How can you come against me?" This is
[1:19:46] why I say they use the term love as a
[1:19:49] club to beat pe people over the head and
[1:19:51] control them with it. It isn't love.
[1:19:57] Love, true love sets free. Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; And love truly given is given freely,
[1:20:05] not under force or co coercion.
[1:20:12] All right.
[1:20:14] Man, have I taken a long time to get
[1:20:16] this. Not very far. So, let's look at
[1:20:19] agape. I guess we'll spend the next uh
[1:20:23] 15 I guess I'll just preach like brother
[1:20:25] brother Jason does. He goes till about
[1:20:27] one o'clock. So, we'll do that, too.
[1:20:30] So looking at Agape,
[1:20:33] Brother Banham says this, "And hear ye
[1:20:34] him." Men and women, hear me today as
[1:20:37] your brother. Let all your little isms
[1:20:38] and your little sensations drop. Find
[1:20:41] the love of God. I'd rather have his
[1:20:43] love than every gift he's got in his
[1:20:45] kingdom. Give me his love.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; That's what the world is looking for
[1:20:50] today is to see a display of real love.
[1:20:53] It'll win souls when you got love. They
[1:20:55] can tell it when you got love. We got
[1:20:57] too much makebelief love. We got too
[1:21:00] much love, felio love, trying to make it
[1:21:02] agapea love. We real we need real godly
[1:21:07] love. Amen.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; And from that time, brother Brandham
[1:21:11] says, "But let me tell you a little
[1:21:12] secret. The most powerful force in the
[1:21:14] world isn't speaking with tongues or
[1:21:15] interpreting tongues or being honored by
[1:21:17] God to be a minister or to be evangelist
[1:21:19] or to be a prophet. The most powerful
[1:21:22] weapon that I've ever found in my life
[1:21:24] is love.
[1:21:27] Amen. So, let's think about that for a
[1:21:29] second. As a as a believer or me as a
[1:21:33] minister,
[1:21:35] whatever it might be, we should
[1:21:36] understand it isn't the anointing that's
[1:21:40] the most powerful force.
[1:21:43] It isn't my ability to make you
[1:21:45] understand what I'm saying is the
[1:21:48] greatest force. What is the greatest
[1:21:50] force? It should be the love that I have
[1:21:51] for the people that I'm preaching to.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:54] That would be the place where power
[1:21:56] would come forth from. That would be the
[1:21:58] place where there would be uh
[1:22:00] transformation in people's lives is that
[1:22:02] the the the the preacher of the word has
[1:22:05] love and that's the place where the
[1:22:08] powerful force will come from. It's
[1:22:10] great to be anointed. It's great to be a
[1:22:12] good speaker. It's really good that
[1:22:14] people can understand what you say when
[1:22:15] you're preaching.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; But that's not it.
[1:22:20] Love is the thing that's going to bring
[1:22:22] change and bring transformation. So,
[1:22:24] brother Bham says the filelio love which
[1:22:26] the Greek word comes from friendship
[1:22:27] like you have for your wife. There's a
[1:22:30] difference. It'll make a a m a mother
[1:22:32] for that baby run through a blazing
[1:22:33] fire. Her life life means nothing.
[1:22:35] That's felio. What will agape o do? See
[1:22:39] the godly love. We must love divinely
[1:22:42] love one another. Then you don't see
[1:22:43] your brother's mistake. If he does make
[1:22:46] a mistake, you never look you you look
[1:22:49] over the top of it and you love him
[1:22:52] anyhow. Jesus is that example in John 21
[1:22:55] speaking to Peter. See that's it. Love
[1:22:57] those that love you then then does this
[1:22:59] not the sinner do the same thing but
[1:23:01] love those who doesn't love you. That's
[1:23:04] what shows the spirit of God is in you
[1:23:07] because he loved you when you were his
[1:23:09] enemy and he loved you. And if it's that
[1:23:11] spirit, if that spirit's in you, it'll
[1:23:14] make you love your enemy as you do your
[1:23:17] friend. Now,
[1:23:19] this is the place where many people get
[1:23:21] so tripped up. I just, this isn't my my
[1:23:23] notes, but I feel like this is a
[1:23:26] a tension that's going on in my mind.
[1:23:30] So we see that to love our enemy and
[1:23:33] that mean that to us many times that
[1:23:35] means throw off all the boundaries. Let
[1:23:38] them do whatever they want to because
[1:23:40] Jesus said if someone slaps you on the
[1:23:43] right cheek, give them the other cheek
[1:23:44] also. And we take this to mean a lot of
[1:23:47] different things. And the fact is God
[1:23:50] himself wants us to have boundaries to
[1:23:54] not let evil people destroy you
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; because evil people will try to take
[1:24:00] control of your life so that you can
[1:24:02] never follow the leadership of the Holy
[1:24:04] Spirit. That isn't love to let someone
[1:24:07] control you and then they're telling you
[1:24:09] everything that you should do and then
[1:24:10] you feel like, well, if I love them,
[1:24:12] I'll just do everything that they told
[1:24:13] me to do. Because Jesus said to if
[1:24:16] someone asked me to go a mile, I should
[1:24:18] go two miles with them. And so all these
[1:24:20] scriptures are going through our mind
[1:24:22] and it's a it becomes a conflict and we
[1:24:24] find ourselves we have no spiritual
[1:24:26] life. We have no walk with the Lord.
[1:24:28] We've been carried on down the line of
[1:24:30] evil that we never imagined would come
[1:24:33] into us and it's all because the devil
[1:24:35] misqued and misused the scriptures in
[1:24:39] our minds. Love is not a feeling and
[1:24:41] it's never a feeling that we're supposed
[1:24:42] to have towards our enemy. It's they're
[1:24:45] our enemy. You're a human, not an
[1:24:48] angelic being.
[1:24:50] You're not God himself.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; He can rise above all that. You're a
[1:24:55] human. You're God doesn't expect you to
[1:24:59] to allow evil to control your life.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Just because they ask for something.
[1:25:05] Evil never stops asking.
[1:25:10] And God tells us demands that we tell
[1:25:13] people no. And he demands that we're not
[1:25:15] equally yolked together with
[1:25:17] unbelievers.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; I've seen this happen many times. Even
[1:25:21] in my own life when I was a brand new
[1:25:22] Christian, I couldn't understand this
[1:25:24] because all my friends were wanting to
[1:25:26] do this and do that and it would end up
[1:25:27] the next thing I knew I was someone's
[1:25:30] trying to pass me a joint
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; or or
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; a can of beer and I'm like, what did I
[1:25:37] do? I was just trying to love my friends
[1:25:38] and talk to them about the Lord.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Then I heard a preacher say, "You got to
[1:25:42] break that yoke.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; There's a yoke that you have together
[1:25:46] that you've had. You were buddies. You
[1:25:48] were partying together. You're cussing
[1:25:51] together. You're doing all this
[1:25:53] perverted stuff together. Now you're a
[1:25:55] Christian." And you have to tell him
[1:25:56] that. You have to say, "I'm a Christian.
[1:25:58] I'm seeking to follow the Lord." What
[1:26:00] are you doing? You're placing up a
[1:26:02] boundary and you're breaking the yoke
[1:26:04] between you and you're saying, "I'm a
[1:26:05] Christian. I'm going to follow the Lord.
[1:26:08] I'm I want you to help me. I want to be
[1:26:10] your friend. I want you to come to
[1:26:12] church with me. I want you to know the
[1:26:14] Lord like I know the Lord. And I want
[1:26:16] you to help me. So if there's a party,
[1:26:18] don't invite me. And if I hear about a
[1:26:21] party, make sure I'm never there. And
[1:26:24] make sure I don't drink or or smoke
[1:26:27] marijuana or cuss. You help me towards
[1:26:31] that. Let's be friends. If not, we can
[1:26:32] just shake friend hands and leave as
[1:26:35] friends
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; be done.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; And the Lord used that. What does that
[1:26:40] do? That suddenly takes you from being
[1:26:43] the influenced to the influencer.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Right? And that's what you have to do.
[1:26:48] That's what boundaries do.
[1:26:50] Evil is trying to control you. Evil is
[1:26:53] trying to manipulate you. Evil is trying
[1:26:55] to have his hand on you so you can never
[1:26:57] do what God wants you to do.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Right? And so boundary says no, I serve
[1:27:03] one master, the Lord Jesus Christ, not
[1:27:06] you. And I have to order my life
[1:27:10] according to the word, not according to
[1:27:12] what evil people that want to control us
[1:27:15] would tell us to do. Oh, that's not very
[1:27:18] nice.
[1:27:20] Are we call is that a fruit of the
[1:27:21] spirit? Being nice.
[1:27:24] It isn't a fruit of the spirit.
[1:27:27] It's great to be nice, but you can't
[1:27:28] always be nice if you want to follow the
[1:27:31] leadership of the Holy Spirit. If you
[1:27:33] read through the four gospels and at the
[1:27:35] end you say, "Man, Jesus was nice." You
[1:27:38] are dyslexic or you can't read.
[1:27:44] Jesus is not nice.
[1:27:47] G Jesus is dangerous
[1:27:51] and
[1:27:53] towards sin and towards evil. And we're
[1:27:55] supposed to be the same.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; We we're supposed to wield the weapon of
[1:28:00] the word, not to hurt, but to heal.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And that's the thing that people don't
[1:28:05] understand is Jesus is that's many
[1:28:08] message believers don't understand that
[1:28:09] they just wield the word like it's a
[1:28:11] battle axe
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; and they're doing it to harm people and
[1:28:15] build themselves up. No, it's a weapon
[1:28:18] that's created to heal,
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; to cut away evil, to cut away. It's a
[1:28:26] It's a surgical strike. It's It's not a
[1:28:29] mad berserker whipping his sword in
[1:28:33] every direction, doing untold damage to
[1:28:36] people's hearts and minds.
[1:28:39] And so we re we realize in all of this
[1:28:42] agape love is far beyond what we think
[1:28:46] being nice is.
[1:28:48] And again, I've I don't know how many
[1:28:50] times I've said that when I've preached
[1:28:51] here. If you went and looked at all the
[1:28:54] things I said, that's probably one of
[1:28:55] the things I've said over and over
[1:28:56] again. And it is such a danger because
[1:28:59] we think that being nice and giving
[1:29:02] people the things that they ask for is
[1:29:04] what the Lord wants us to do. And it
[1:29:07] isn't.
[1:29:09] It absolutely isn't. Yes, absolutely.
[1:29:12] There's circumstances when you when when
[1:29:14] it's time for you to give, don't just
[1:29:16] give one mile. Give two miles. Give
[1:29:19] extravagantly. And also, the Lord
[1:29:21] doesn't even want you to give out of
[1:29:23] constraint. He wants you to give
[1:29:25] willingly and as a cheerful giver. So,
[1:29:28] if you give because you're forced to
[1:29:29] give, God looks at and says, "What kind
[1:29:31] of stink is that?" Yeah.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; God doesn't accept our works because we
[1:29:36] feel like we're forced and trapped into
[1:29:38] it. He wants us to give freely,
[1:29:41] willingly, and joyfully. And if we
[1:29:44] can't, then we have to go examine
[1:29:47] ourselves before we give to that person
[1:29:48] that's asked of us.
[1:29:51] Amen. Does this making sense?
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:03] So if we look at I'm never g this this I
[1:30:06] have an entire sermon to preach in 20
[1:30:08] minutes.
[1:30:10] We'll just do the best we can and trust
[1:30:13] the Lord.
[1:30:15] From the church ages book, brother
[1:30:17] Brandham says, you see, they could not
[1:30:19] figure out God's love. They thought that
[1:30:21] love meant no suffering. They thought
[1:30:22] that love meant a baby with parental
[1:30:24] care. But God said that his love was
[1:30:27] elective love. The proof of his love is
[1:30:29] election. that no matter what happened,
[1:30:32] his love was proven truly by the fact
[1:30:34] that they were chosen unto salvation.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the proof of his love is
[1:30:40] looking backwards to election. Right?
[1:30:43] They were chosen by him. No matter what
[1:30:45] circumstances were, he chose them before
[1:30:48] the foundation of the world and he loves
[1:30:49] them and nothing can separate them from
[1:30:52] the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
[1:30:54] our Lord. Because God has chosen you to
[1:30:56] salvation through sanctification of the
[1:30:58] spirit and belief of the truth. He may
[1:31:00] commit you to death as he did Paul. He
[1:31:02] may commit you to suffering as he did
[1:31:04] Job. That is his prerogative. He is
[1:31:06] sovereign. But it is all with a purpose.
[1:31:09] Again,
[1:31:11] all all the things that we go through
[1:31:14] have a purpose behind them, right? And
[1:31:18] so he's not changing subjects. He's
[1:31:20] talking about love. So in other words,
[1:31:21] love has a a purpose.
[1:31:25] in it.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; If he did not have a purpose, then he
[1:31:29] would be the author of frustration and
[1:31:31] not of peace. His purpose is that after
[1:31:33] we have suffered a while, we would be
[1:31:35] made perfect, be established,
[1:31:37] strengthened, and settled. As Job said,
[1:31:39] he puts strength in us. You see, he
[1:31:42] himself suffered. He learned obedience
[1:31:44] by the things that he suffered. He was
[1:31:46] actually made perfect by the things that
[1:31:48] he suffered.
[1:31:50] And we'll script skip forward from the
[1:31:52] uh to the middle there. In plain
[1:31:54] language, the very character of Jesus
[1:31:56] was perfected by suffering. And
[1:31:58] according to Paul, he left his church a
[1:32:01] measure of suffering that they too by
[1:32:03] their faith in God while suffering him
[1:32:05] for him would come to a place of
[1:32:08] perfection.
[1:32:12] So here we see that there is a purpose
[1:32:15] behind
[1:32:16] the love. So God's God's love has a
[1:32:20] purpose in it. It has an end in mind. It
[1:32:22] has a function towards it. It's not just
[1:32:24] God's feeling towards this. It looks
[1:32:26] back to election, but that election
[1:32:28] carries a function in it, which is right
[1:32:31] here. That he is going to allow
[1:32:34] circumstances and situations in in our
[1:32:37] lives. And we can look even deeper and
[1:32:39] say the word itself, the word itself
[1:32:41] changes us. And then the word coming up
[1:32:44] in conflict with circumstances in our
[1:32:46] lives and us overcoming that's molding
[1:32:48] us and shaping us into the image of
[1:32:51] Jesus Christ. If Jesus character was
[1:32:53] perfected by suffering, the same will be
[1:32:56] for us.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the purpose is so that we
[1:33:00] would grow up and to be in the image of
[1:33:02] Jesus Christ. So that's God's love. We
[1:33:05] think God's love is, oh, we're going to
[1:33:08] heaven. That's it.
[1:33:11] Well, that's true, but you missed a
[1:33:13] whole lot of the story. You missed back
[1:33:15] to election so that his election would
[1:33:19] carry us all the way through to that
[1:33:21] place. But then what's in the middle?
[1:33:23] What's going on in the middle here? Is
[1:33:25] there no purpose? It's just go out and
[1:33:28] get big houses and name it and claim it
[1:33:32] whatever you want. Easy life. No. He is
[1:33:35] going to bring us through trials and
[1:33:37] circumstances that cause us to grow into
[1:33:39] the image of Jesus Christ. So what is
[1:33:42] God's purpose in love? We've talked
[1:33:44] about it before in Sunday school class,
[1:33:46] but it's love. Divine love, real genuine
[1:33:49] love is a power or force that extends
[1:33:53] itself for the purpose of spiritual
[1:33:55] growth in others.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; If we can look at it and understand it
[1:33:59] that way is this that is love. You say,
[1:34:03] "Love your enemy."
[1:34:06] You do. You want their spiritual growth.
[1:34:08] That's far beyond being nice. You want
[1:34:11] to see them grow spiritually. And so
[1:34:14] you'll do like Jesus did because Peter
[1:34:16] did evil. Let's not just let's not just
[1:34:20] mix the mix the words. Oh, Peter just
[1:34:22] made a little mistake. I mean, Peter did
[1:34:24] evil. He did the thing that's supposed
[1:34:28] to get us denied before the Father in
[1:34:30] heaven.
[1:34:33] He he did an awful thing, a sinful
[1:34:35] thing. And here was the Lord Jesus
[1:34:37] looking far beyond that. Not looking
[1:34:40] merely at the mistake that Peter made.
[1:34:42] Yes, looking at the mistake he made, but
[1:34:44] look, as he's looking at it, calling him
[1:34:46] to something higher and deeper and far
[1:34:48] further than Peter could ever imagine
[1:34:50] himself doing at that that moment.
[1:34:53] That's love.
[1:34:55] That is love. Because it love's focus is
[1:34:58] the same focus as God. God's focus is
[1:35:01] not our comfortability in life. God's
[1:35:03] focus is that you will be like Jesus
[1:35:05] Christ. That you will be Jesus Christ in
[1:35:08] the flesh in this day.
[1:35:13] Skip this.
[1:35:15] Love is a power, right? Love extends
[1:35:18] itself unto others. Love's purpose is
[1:35:22] spiritual growth.
[1:35:26] So love is a power that extends itself
[1:35:29] for the purpose of spiritual growth.
[1:35:32] So defining evil, the opposite of love.
[1:35:37] Foundationally, evil is anything that
[1:35:40] goes against the purpose of God, that
[1:35:43] fights against the purpose of God.
[1:35:50] Genesis 3 9-12. Brother Mark, I made
[1:35:53] this PowerPoint
[1:35:54] a few weeks ago. So, nobody can blame me
[1:35:58] for attacking brother Mark.
[1:36:02] If you don't know what I'm saying, it's
[1:36:03] it's something that happened in the EV
[1:36:05] group. He Anyways, God, I love you,
[1:36:09] brother Mark. You know,
[1:36:12] and the Lord God Tabby will like this,
[1:36:15] I'm sure. And the Lord God called unto
[1:36:17] Adam and said unto him, "Where art
[1:36:19] thou?"
[1:36:21] And he said, 'I heard thy voice in the
[1:36:23] garden, and I was afraid because I was
[1:36:26] naked, and I hid myself.
[1:36:28] Uhoh.
[1:36:30] And he said, Who told thee that thou was
[1:36:33] naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree
[1:36:36] whereof I commanded thee that thou
[1:36:37] shouldest not eat? And the woman And the
[1:36:41] man said, The woman whom you gave to be
[1:36:46] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I
[1:36:49] did eat. Uhoh.
[1:36:53] What's the problem here? This is evil.
[1:36:57] How do we know it's evil? Adam was
[1:37:00] hiding himself. Adam felt guilt
[1:37:04] himself. And so because of that guilt
[1:37:06] that he and Eve had, they hid and ran
[1:37:09] away from the one that they should have
[1:37:10] been running to. And so out of this
[1:37:13] guilt, here comes the man. And instead
[1:37:16] of taking responsibility
[1:37:19] for his own life, what does he do? He
[1:37:21] actually in blames God
[1:37:24] says, "Look, it was the woman you gave
[1:37:26] me. She's deficient. Not only is she
[1:37:30] deficient, your choice and your design
[1:37:33] itself was deficient."
[1:37:36] That's a that's a huge problem because
[1:37:40] he refused to take responsibility for
[1:37:42] his own actions. He not only blamed the
[1:37:45] his wife, he blamed God himself.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; And God was coming to the responsible
[1:37:51] party first
[1:37:53] because he made man first and he took
[1:37:55] the woman out of the man. The woman was
[1:37:57] made for the man. The man was the head
[1:37:59] of the woman. So he was coming to the
[1:38:01] responsible responsible party and the
[1:38:03] responsible party said, "God, you're at
[1:38:06] fault because your designs are flawed.
[1:38:11] This is evil. Then the woman says,
[1:38:16] "The serpent begaled me and I did eat."
[1:38:19] So Adam says, "God's at fault."
[1:38:22] And the woman says, "The devil's at
[1:38:24] fault."
[1:38:26] But who who reaps the consequences of
[1:38:28] it? The people at fault. God cursed
[1:38:33] Adam. God cursed Eve because they're the
[1:38:36] ones that sinned. And this is the
[1:38:38] problem of evil in people's lives.
[1:38:43] The next story, we're all familiar. I
[1:38:46] just want to go quickly over it. We have
[1:38:50] Cain. Did Cain take responsibility for
[1:38:53] his actions? First, he says, "All right,
[1:38:56] I'll solve this problem that God doesn't
[1:38:58] accept my offering by eliminating the
[1:39:00] one who did the more excellent
[1:39:02] sacrifice. If I eliminate him, then I'll
[1:39:05] be fine." And God comes and and speaks
[1:39:09] with him, offers him mercy, offers him
[1:39:11] grace, and he punishes goes directly to
[1:39:16] and punishes Cain. And Cain's response
[1:39:19] is, "I'm sorry, Lord. Forgive me of my
[1:39:22] sins." He He yells out, "My
[1:39:27] punishment is greater than I can bear.
[1:39:31] My goodness, this is evil."
[1:39:34] And if you think about this, this really
[1:39:36] summarizes
[1:39:38] how people behave and act in their lives
[1:39:41] in a very very significant way. They can
[1:39:45] never progress. I mean, they can't even
[1:39:47] progress uh as humans
[1:39:51] when they're sitting there blaming their
[1:39:53] problem on someone else,
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; let alone to say spiritually. If they
[1:39:58] can't own the fact that their lives are
[1:40:01] ruined
[1:40:02] and they blame it on somebody else, it's
[1:40:04] their children's fault, it's their
[1:40:06] wife's fault, it's this person's fault,
[1:40:08] someone else did it, this the government
[1:40:10] did it, uh the my wife didn't do this,
[1:40:15] my this person didn't do that, the
[1:40:17] church didn't help me, the this person.
[1:40:20] Never taking responsibility for your own
[1:40:23] actions and behavior.
[1:40:25] We have to we have to own the problem.
[1:40:28] If if there's a problem in our life, it
[1:40:29] probably is reflected back to us by the
[1:40:32] mirror.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; And you can we can always put blame on
[1:40:39] someone else, but God puts us in various
[1:40:42] circumstances and his Holy Spirit is
[1:40:43] living within us to help us overcome.
[1:40:46] And I get it. There's times and there's
[1:40:47] circumstances to have boundaries and
[1:40:50] move away from the problem. I I I get
[1:40:53] that. And that that's absolutely true.
[1:40:56] And there's times and circumstances
[1:40:57] where someone is being abused or
[1:41:00] whatever it might be and they've got to
[1:41:02] put physical distance between
[1:41:03] themselves. I'm not saying that. But at
[1:41:06] the same time, we all have to realize
[1:41:08] our own responsibility for our own
[1:41:12] lives. And if we don't do that, then
[1:41:15] we're doing the opposite of love. We're
[1:41:17] doing evil.
[1:41:20] Look at this. Evil seeks to preserve
[1:41:22] itself. What was Adam doing? What was
[1:41:25] Eve doing? What was Cain doing? They
[1:41:27] were It was self-preservation. Pointing
[1:41:29] the finger at someone else. It's has a
[1:41:31] scapegoat.
[1:41:33] Okay, Abel's my problem here. Then God's
[1:41:36] the problem. The devil's the problem.
[1:41:38] This one's the problem, but never me.
[1:41:41] And it has for its purpose the hindrance
[1:41:44] of spiritual growth. That's what evil's
[1:41:47] end is. Is to hinder the spiritual
[1:41:49] growth. not only of itself but of anyone
[1:41:53] in its own path. Why? Because
[1:41:56] love exposes that which is evil.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Love will reveal something that's evil.
[1:42:05] And what evil's response is? We've all
[1:42:07] done evil.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; We've all hindered people's spiritual
[1:42:10] growth. We've all done things in our
[1:42:12] lives that have been evil. Let's just
[1:42:14] own that fact right now.
[1:42:18] At the same time, a person that's truly
[1:42:20] evil will never own their fault. It will
[1:42:23] always be someone else's problem. And
[1:42:25] what are they doing? They're refusing
[1:42:27] for themselves any kind of growth.
[1:42:31] And they're hindering anyone around them
[1:42:33] from ever experiencing spiritual growth
[1:42:36] on their own.
[1:42:38] And that's the problem with evil people.
[1:42:40] They're actually not even aware that
[1:42:41] they themselves are evil
[1:42:44] and that they're practicing evil.
[1:42:46] They think they're normal. They're
[1:42:47] average. And in most circumstances, they
[1:42:50] think their judgment is so high and far
[1:42:53] above others that everyone should submit
[1:42:55] and surrender themselves to their idea
[1:42:58] and the way that they look at things.
[1:43:01] They never evaluate the fruit of their
[1:43:03] lives. All around them is confusion and
[1:43:06] hurt and anger, pain, and wickedness.
[1:43:10] But they'll always tell you very
[1:43:11] clearly,
[1:43:13] "What else was I supposed to do?
[1:43:16] What would you have? You would have done
[1:43:18] the same thing as me. We're just trying
[1:43:20] our best to live a good life and to be
[1:43:23] happy. And what are they doing? They're
[1:43:25] controlling people around them. They're
[1:43:26] manipulating people around them. They're
[1:43:29] telling lies.
[1:43:31] It's like it's like Lionus in Peanuts. I
[1:43:35] think it's Lionus who's all he's dirty.
[1:43:37] Everywhere he goes, there's dirt
[1:43:38] following.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; That's an evil person. Everywhere he
[1:43:41] goes, there's dirt following. And he's
[1:43:44] like, "My goodness, why are all these
[1:43:45] people so dirty?" You, pal.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; You corrupt everything that you're
[1:43:51] around. You destroy everything that
[1:43:53] you're around. And then again, it's not
[1:43:56] your fault.
[1:43:59] And I know this sounds extreme,
[1:44:03] and it is extreme.
[1:44:05] And there's different levels and layers
[1:44:07] that this can be manifested. But
[1:44:09] ultimately, this is the place and this
[1:44:11] is the problem that God sees and God
[1:44:13] looks at. Think about the I've I've said
[1:44:16] this in Sunday school before. Think
[1:44:18] about the difference between two diff
[1:44:19] two kings. This is the part I'll close
[1:44:22] with.
[1:44:24] You have King Saul and you have King
[1:44:26] David.
[1:44:28] Now, King David,
[1:44:31] what did he what what was his problem?
[1:44:34] Adultery and murder.
[1:44:38] crimes punishable by death, right? What
[1:44:42] was Saul's problem? He followed God's
[1:44:45] command 99%.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; So, all of us would look at it and and
[1:44:52] look at Saul and look at David and say,
[1:44:54] "My goodness, he attacked the
[1:44:56] Amalachites. I mean, they're basically
[1:44:58] done.
[1:44:59] There's pretty much no one left." And
[1:45:02] they want to have make a sacrifice. They
[1:45:04] want to have special meetings. going to
[1:45:06] have a camp meeting. They're going to
[1:45:08] make a special sacrifice of of all these
[1:45:11] animals. My goodness, it's a great
[1:45:14] revival going on of worship to the Lord.
[1:45:18] They've got they've got they've got
[1:45:20] cows, they got sheep, and my it's going
[1:45:22] to be a big big revival.
[1:45:26] And uh the prophet comes to both of
[1:45:29] these men.
[1:45:31] Samuel comes grieving and says, "What's
[1:45:34] the sound of this sheep? I've come I've
[1:45:37] obeyed the commandment of the Lord."
[1:45:39] That's what Saul says. Hallelujah. Bless
[1:45:42] God. I've done what the Lord asked me to
[1:45:44] do. Says, "Why are why what's why is
[1:45:47] there mooing and and bowing? What's
[1:45:50] going on here?"
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Right? He said, 'Oh, the people saved
[1:45:54] some of the best for a special revival
[1:45:58] meeting
[1:46:00] for a sacrifice to the Lord. All right.
[1:46:03] Well,
[1:46:07] you've rejected the word of the Lord.
[1:46:08] And because you've rejected the word of
[1:46:10] the Lord, the Lord has rejected you from
[1:46:13] being king. And Samuel turns to walk
[1:46:16] away. What does he do? He grabs He grabs
[1:46:19] Samuel. Saul grabs Samuel. Why did he
[1:46:22] want Samuel to stay? Oh, forgive me
[1:46:26] though. I've I've sinned against the
[1:46:27] Lord. No, stay. Stay. Honor me in front
[1:46:31] of the people.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I've sinned, but honor me in front
[1:46:34] of the people.
[1:46:37] And And God departs from Saul at that
[1:46:42] moment. And he's he in God's eyes, he's
[1:46:45] finished. And here we have the other
[1:46:49] king. Adultery, murder. He's
[1:46:51] disqualified himself from ever serving
[1:46:53] God. In our eyes, he's finished.
[1:46:56] In our eyes, we take Saul 99 days out of
[1:47:00] a hundred
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; because on the outside, we see someone
[1:47:04] who did their in our in our mind in
[1:47:06] obser observation. Boy, he did his best.
[1:47:09] But those people, you know, it was a
[1:47:11] hindrance to him. That's not God's
[1:47:13] heart. That's not God's mind. David over
[1:47:15] here commits adultery, has the man
[1:47:17] murdered, and he comes to to David and
[1:47:20] confronts him and tells us tells a
[1:47:23] little parable and says, "You're that
[1:47:24] man.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; You're the killer. You're the
[1:47:27] adulterer."
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; What's David's response? And this is
[1:47:31] where it's different. And this is where
[1:47:32] God's vision and viewpoint is so
[1:47:34] different than ours.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; And I have taken away your sin. Amen.
[1:47:42] Amazing grace. God is looking far. What
[1:47:46] was David? What did Saul Saul said? You
[1:47:49] know what, God? I refuse to grow
[1:47:51] anymore. And I'm not the problem. The
[1:47:54] people are the problem. What did David
[1:47:56] say?
[1:47:58] Oh, I'm a miserable, wretched sinner.
[1:48:01] And I need I've sinned against He sinned
[1:48:04] against man. He sinned against a family,
[1:48:07] two families. He sinned against a
[1:48:09] kingdom. But what was his focus? against
[1:48:12] thee and thee only have I sinned.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; That was the heart of David and God
[1:48:17] wiped out his sin and removed it as far
[1:48:19] as the east is from the west. So the
[1:48:22] problem isn't for in God's mind the
[1:48:25] problem isn't our individual sin. The
[1:48:28] problem is what is the our response to
[1:48:31] him when he confronts us over it? Do do
[1:48:35] we refuse to receive his love? Because
[1:48:37] that's ultimately what it is. He's
[1:48:39] offering to King David and King Saul
[1:48:41] spiritual growth. Here's an opportunity
[1:48:44] for you to grow. Would you like to grow?
[1:48:48] Saul says, "No."
[1:48:50] What does that show? That shows the
[1:48:52] value of his relationship with Almighty
[1:48:55] God. He evalued his image, what he
[1:48:59] looked like,
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; his position higher than he valued God.
[1:49:04] What did King David say?
[1:49:07] I've broken the heart of my father. I've
[1:49:10] sinned against God. And God says, "This
[1:49:12] is a man after my own heart." I wouldn't
[1:49:15] say that about an adulterer. That might
[1:49:18] ruin my ministry.
[1:49:22] Boy, this adulterous murderer, he's sure
[1:49:24] a man after my own heart. But look at
[1:49:27] how much higher God sees. That's
[1:49:31] elective love. And that's love with a
[1:49:33] purpose. musicians, if you come. That's
[1:49:36] a that's love that has a vision of what
[1:49:39] I'm going to make this man into.
[1:49:41] Regardless of how messed up he is, he
[1:49:46] wants to grow. He wants to become more
[1:49:50] like Jesus Christ. Amen. Romans 8:28
[1:49:53] says, "And we know that all things work
[1:49:55] together for good to them that love God,
[1:49:58] to them who are the called according to
[1:50:02] his purpose."
[1:50:04] Amen. So God is actively working things
[1:50:07] for good. But remember what do what is
[1:50:10] good? How do we define what is good?
[1:50:12] Because verse 35 in Romans 8 says,
[1:50:16] "Shall tribulation, distress,
[1:50:18] persecution, famine, nakedness, peril,
[1:50:19] or sword separate us from the love of
[1:50:21] God?" No, it won't separate us. So this
[1:50:24] good isn't good circumstances in our
[1:50:26] life. What is the good? Well, the very
[1:50:28] next verse tells us exactly that. Romans
[1:50:30] 8:29, for whom he did forno, he also did
[1:50:34] predestinate to be what? Conformed to
[1:50:38] the image of his son, that he might be
[1:50:40] the firstborn among many brethren. So
[1:50:44] again, this is looking exactly at what
[1:50:46] brother Brandham said. Love is elective,
[1:50:49] right? But that elective love is for a
[1:50:51] purpose. What's the purpose? So that we
[1:50:53] would be conformed to the image of his
[1:50:57] son. That's what God's love is sent for.
[1:51:00] That's what that's what he's he's
[1:51:02] dealing with us to to accomplish in our
[1:51:04] lives. And that's the kind of love that
[1:51:07] he wants us to have. This isn't just a
[1:51:10] love that's far off coming down from
[1:51:12] heaven towards you. This is a love
[1:51:14] that's supposed to be in every one of
[1:51:16] us.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Because it's the love, the agape of God,
[1:51:20] which is shed abroad in our hearts by
[1:51:22] the Holy Ghost. So we first have to have
[1:51:25] this outside source come into us to
[1:51:28] cause us to be able to have the right
[1:51:31] kind of love, agape love and not not
[1:51:34] that's supposed to be our love to God,
[1:51:37] right? That we love we trust him and we
[1:51:39] love him regardless of circumstances
[1:51:43] and we know that his end in mind through
[1:51:45] all of our circumstances is that we
[1:51:48] would be like Jesus Christ. This is the
[1:51:50] ultimate aim. This is this is your
[1:51:52] purpose in life.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; He wants you to enter into that purpose
[1:51:56] in your life that divine love is flowing
[1:51:59] through you.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; It's not a feeling. It's not an emotion.
[1:52:04] What is it? It's an action. It's God's
[1:52:06] love coming forth from you. His power
[1:52:10] working in your your life to bring forth
[1:52:13] spiritual growth in other people's
[1:52:15] lives. Amen. That's God's end. That's
[1:52:17] God's purpose. I love it. Let's stand
[1:52:19] together. We'll pray.
[1:52:23] Heavenly Father, we thank you so much
[1:52:26] for your word. We thank you so much for
[1:52:29] your love for us. Father,
[1:52:31] we look Lord, we just want to even take
[1:52:34] a few moments myself, Lord. ask that
[1:52:38] you'd
[1:52:40] look upon our hearts and minds and
[1:52:43] lives, Lord. And
[1:52:46] if there's places where
[1:52:49] we're doing evil things, hindering the
[1:52:52] spiritual growth of our families or
[1:52:54] those around us, Lord, I pray that you'd
[1:52:56] convict our hearts
[1:52:58] and help us to have this vision. Lord
[1:53:02] to love our families well. We have to
[1:53:05] have this spiritual growth in mind and
[1:53:08] we have to have this ordered love
[1:53:12] according to the word. Not according to
[1:53:14] our own thoughts, our own feelings, our
[1:53:15] own emotions, the definitions of the
[1:53:17] world, but the word flowing forth
[1:53:20] through us, Lord, that your love would
[1:53:23] come forth to everyone we meet. Father,
[1:53:26] we commit ourselves, Lord, to you.
[1:53:30] We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. Amazing
[1:53:35] [Music]
[1:53:39] grace,
[1:53:41] how sweet
[1:53:44] the sound

[1:57:30] Gracious Father, we come before you,
[1:57:32] Lord, and we pray that you'd just water
[1:57:35] this word by your spirit in our hearts,
[1:57:39] Lord. We don't just come to church to
[1:57:42] fulfill our obligation for the week,
[1:57:44] Lord, but we come to be changed and to
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; to be made more like Jesus Christ. Not
[1:57:50] to be confirmed
[1:57:52] in our wrong ways of thinking, wrong
[1:57:55] attitudes, or to hear what we want to
[1:57:57] hear, Lord. But we come Lord that we
[1:58:00] would be corrected and that Lord your
[1:58:03] Holy Spirit would
[1:58:05] scour out every place in our heart
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; that it would only be that perfect love
[1:58:12] that's coming forth from us. Father, we
[1:58:15] want to commit each one to you, Lord,
[1:58:19] this afternoon.
[1:58:20] Commit them into your hands. Lord, may
[1:58:22] your hand of grace and your hand of
[1:58:25] protection and your hand of love be upon
[1:58:28] each one, Lord, as they go forward. Use
[1:58:30] them mightily, Lord, in their lives, in
[1:58:33] their homes, in their families, their
[1:58:35] places of work. Father,
[1:58:38] do do mighty supernatural works in their
[1:58:41] lives for your glory. We ask it in
[1:58:43] Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you,
[1:58:45] saints.
