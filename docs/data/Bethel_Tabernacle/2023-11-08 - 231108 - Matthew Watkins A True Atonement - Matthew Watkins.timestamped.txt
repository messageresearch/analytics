[25:32] the Lord Jesus tonight amen happy to be
[25:34] in his house amen Ephesians chapter 4 if
[25:37] you have your Bible we go straight to
[25:39] the word amen Ephesians chapter 4
[25:43] Brothers I did send you some slides if
[25:44] you just have that up and ready that
[25:47] would be
[25:49] awesome Ephesians chapter 4 we're just
[25:51] going to read a um scripture from here
[25:55] and then another portion in Zechariah
[26:05] amen praise the Lord Zechariah Chapter
[26:15] 12 amen praise the Lord trust that you
[26:18] came with a hunger amen upon your heart
[26:20] just to receive from the Lord and hear
[26:22] from the Lord Lord just um really
[26:24] weighing my heart burdening me heavy for
[26:26] this thought I'm to preach here and so I
[26:29] just um been looking forward to being
[26:31] able to come here tonight and just
[26:33] waiting to see what the Lord will do
[26:34] don't really have a really put together
[26:37] thought just more things uh put together
[26:40] notes but just things really upon my
[26:42] heart and so I just want to be able to
[26:44] express them I pray that just trust that
[26:46] you'll pull on the word of the Lord amen
[26:48] and believe that the Lord can speak to
[26:50] you amen that's a that's a that's
[26:52] important because the Bible says you've
[26:53] got to mix the word with faith and so
[26:57] the Bible says he that cometh to God
[26:59] must first believe that he is and that
[27:02] he's a rewarder of them that dig
[27:04] diligently seek Him amen so you first
[27:06] got to have faith to say Lord I believe
[27:08] you could speak to me amen how many will
[27:11] raise a hand and say Lord I believe you
[27:12] can speak to me amen tonight and I want
[27:15] to hear your voice amen wanted to hear
[27:18] the voice of the Lord amen Zechariah 12
[27:21] first we'll look at Ephesians chapter 4
[27:24] and let's just begin reading here at
[27:25] verse 11 and he gave some
[27:29] Apostles and he gave some Apostles and
[27:32] some prophets and some evangelists and
[27:36] some pastors and teachers for the
[27:39] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[27:41] the ministry for the edifying of the
[27:44] body of Christ till we all come into the
[27:49] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[27:52] of the Son of God unto a perfect man
[27:56] unto the measure of the stature of the
[27:59] fullness of Christ so how long will
[28:02] these gifts be in operation until
[28:04] then that we henceforth notice this be
[28:08] no more children tossed to and fro and
[28:11] carried about with every wind of
[28:13] Doctrine by the Slate of men and cunning
[28:16] craftiness whereby they lie in weight to
[28:19] deceive but speaking the truth and love
[28:22] that's important May grow up into him in
[28:25] all things which is the head
[28:28] even Christ from who the whole body
[28:30] fitly joined together and compacted by
[28:33] that which every joint supplieth
[28:37] according to the effectual working in
[28:39] the measure of every part maketh
[28:41] increase of the body under the edifying
[28:45] of itself in love you notice that in
[28:49] both places in Ephesians speaking the
[28:52] truth in love and then he goes on in
[28:55] verse 16 and says where every joint's
[28:57] going to supply the entire body
[28:59] everything's going to work the Bible
[29:01] says the effectual working in the
[29:03] measure of every part not just the
[29:05] preacher not just the Deacon not just
[29:08] the pastor but every part so you see in
[29:10] the body there's a there's a role for
[29:12] everybody to play and the Bible says Mak
[29:16] an increase of the body unto the
[29:18] edifying notice that of its s in love
[29:23] verse 17 this I say therefore and
[29:25] testify in the Lord that you henceforth
[29:29] walk not as other Gentiles walk in the
[29:32] vanity of their mind having the
[29:34] understanding darken being alienated
[29:36] from the life of God through the
[29:38] ignorance that is in them because of the
[29:40] blindness of their heart who being past
[29:44] filling what an amazing place to get to
[29:48] to where your past
[29:50] filling did you know you can get to that
[29:52] place we all can get to that place to
[29:56] where we're past filling these are
[29:58] Gentiles this is who he's speaking of
[30:00] don't walk as other Gentiles walk right
[30:03] who being past filling have given
[30:05] themselves over into lasciviousness to
[30:07] work all in cleanness with greediness
[30:10] verse 20 but you love this verse have
[30:14] not so learned Christ amen but you have
[30:20] not so learn Christ if so be that you
[30:25] have heard him and have been taught by
[30:27] him as the truth is in Jesus that you
[30:31] put off concerning the former
[30:33] conversation the old be that you put off
[30:36] let me read that again verse 22 that you
[30:38] put off concerning the former
[30:40] conversation the old man which is
[30:42] corrupt according to the deceitful lust
[30:44] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[30:46] mind and that you put on the new man
[30:50] which after God is created in
[30:52] righteousness and true Holiness
[30:53] wherefore putting away lion speak every
[30:56] man truth with his his neighbor for we
[30:58] are members one of another be you angry
[31:01] and sin not let not the sun go down upon
[31:04] your wrath neither give place to the
[31:07] devil let him that stole steal no more
[31:10] but rather let him labor working with
[31:12] his hands the thing which is good that
[31:15] he may have to give to him that needeth
[31:17] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[31:21] of your mouth amen but that which is
[31:24] good to the use of edify
[31:27] that it may Minister Grace unto the
[31:31] hearers and grieve not the holy spirit
[31:35] of God whereby you are sealed unto the
[31:38] day of redemption let all bitterness and
[31:41] wrath and anger and clamor and evil
[31:46] speaking be put away from you with all
[31:49] malice and be you kind one to another
[31:54] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[31:57] even as God for Christ's sake hath
[32:00] forgiven you Lord
[32:01] Jesus Lord I just bow my head God just
[32:04] now and surrender Lord I completely
[32:08] surrender my vessel my thoughts Lord the
[32:11] things that you've burdened upon me Lord

[33:03] them the hearer we ask it in Jesus
[33:05] Christ's name amen amen you can be
[33:08] seated
[33:11] tonight I'm struggling on where to begin
[33:14] I just have so many things the Lord has
[33:16] just uh burdened me with and I don't
[33:19] know uh really even as I stand here
[33:21] right now I don't have a real continuity
[33:24] or clear Direction uh but I just believe
[33:27] I I rest because I know that that's how
[33:29] the Lord intended this to be here
[33:32] tonight and so I you just pray for me as
[33:34] I just begin to just labor here and just
[33:37] pour my heart out as I just minister to
[33:39] you I'm speaking here tonight and I've
[33:41] titled this a true atonement I want you
[33:44] to look at Zechariah Chapter 12 if you
[33:46] could quickly um Zechariah Chapter 12
[33:49] very familiar scripture and we didn't
[33:51] read
[33:54] itans let's look here just for a moment
[33:57] in in Zechariah 12 and let's just read a
[34:01] few verses here uh from verse one the
[34:04] burden of the word of the Lord for
[34:06] Israel saeth the Lord which stretches
[34:08] stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth
[34:11] the foundation of the earth and forth
[34:15] the spirit of man within him behold I
[34:19] will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling
[34:22] unto all the people round about when
[34:25] they shall be in The Siege both against
[34:27] Judah and against Jerusalem and in that
[34:31] day notice this you're going to see
[34:32] these words a lot in this in the chapter
[34:35] 12 and chapter 14 and in that day will I
[34:39] make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for
[34:42] all people all that burden themselves
[34:45] with it shall be cut in pieces though
[34:47] all the people of the earth be gathered
[34:50] together against it in that day there it
[34:52] is again saith the Lord I will Smite
[34:55] every horse with astonishment and his
[34:57] rider with Madness I will open mine eyes
[35:00] upon the house of Judah and will Smite
[35:02] every horse of the people with blindness
[35:05] verse six and in that day I will make
[35:07] the governors of Judah like a hearth of
[35:10] fire among the wood uh verse eight in
[35:13] that day he says it again verse 11 and
[35:15] in that day and so you see that the Lord
[35:18] here in in in Zachariah and I'm just
[35:20] going to speak here just for a moment
[35:22] what an incredible time that we're
[35:25] living in I mean
[35:27] unbelievably uh unprecedented like
[35:29] nothing we've ever seen before really
[35:31] what we see happening in our world today
[35:34] in the land of Israel and then beyond
[35:36] Israel not even just the nation of
[35:38] Israel what they're facing and what
[35:40] they're processing uh their in their own
[35:44] nation is very uh it's incredible
[35:46] because it's such a contrast to what we
[35:49] here in the west see in our civilized
[35:51] modern world where it looks like the
[35:54] entire world has turned their back back
[35:57] against Israel what an anointing listen
[36:00] friends this isn't just something that's
[36:02] just happened overnight this is
[36:03] prophetic what you're I believe truly
[36:06] what we're seeing I don't know that's
[36:07] the culmination of the of World War III
[36:10] and and the and the beginning of the you
[36:12] know the tribulation period and a
[36:14] Rapture hey I'm all for it sign me up if
[36:16] this is what this is about then praise
[36:18] God I I'm right here right in line for
[36:21] it I don't know if that's what this is
[36:23] but we know that this is prophesied we
[36:25] we read about this in Zechariah chapter
[36:27] 12 13 and 14 and it covers such a broad
[36:31] scope uh of of of the of the of of the
[36:34] just in those three chapters it covers
[36:36] just a broad scope of Prophecy and we
[36:39] know that there's actual events these
[36:42] aren't uh generic things that you read
[36:44] about here what I love about the Bible
[36:47] is that the Bible is very specific these
[36:50] are things that are actually going to
[36:52] take place on a very real way and it
[36:54] prophesies actual event
[36:57] uh in the world it talks about uh how
[37:00] that there will be an entire Confederacy
[37:02] uh an entire world Army a world nation
[37:05] that something will come to unite the
[37:08] world against this little bitty tiny
[37:11] nation of Israel right and the scripture
[37:14] says that they would come under they
[37:15] would come under the anointing of this
[37:17] that it would be a unification you know
[37:21] and I don't have time and I'm not really
[37:22] going to teach on this here tonight but
[37:24] I'm just going to go as the Lord leads
[37:26] me it's incredible because I was just
[37:28] reading today in in brother bam in the
[37:30] Feast of the trumpets and it begins to
[37:32] talk about how that uh how that that
[37:35] that all of these these uh spirits that
[37:37] were Unleashed at the river Euphrates
[37:40] these um uh you know these demon Spirits
[37:43] these Chargers he said were released
[37:45] against Israel and and he talks about
[37:48] how that they were released under the
[37:50] six seal and we all know this very well
[37:53] that that that six seal is a tribulation
[37:55] seal and you you say well we're not in
[37:57] the tribulation period well that's right
[37:59] we're not in the tribulation period you
[38:01] see we got to understand and if you
[38:03] study the message you realize that
[38:04] brother Brandon preached and taught that
[38:06] there was an actual happening or a real
[38:09] taking place of that six seal that
[38:12] tribulation period but yet even before
[38:14] that six seal there was a
[38:16] pre-tribulation anointing that was
[38:19] released from that seal into the
[38:21] atmosphere a pastor spent uh many sermon
[38:24] series upon that preaching on the vials
[38:26] and the plagues and so we know brother
[38:28] bandam talks about the the you know the
[38:30] first six seal the first six seals are
[38:33] covered in Revelations chapter six and
[38:35] in Revelation six you have all six seals
[38:38] you just have the don't have the seventh
[38:40] seal uh you know but here uh how many
[38:42] knows what the the seventh seal is it's
[38:44] the coming of the Lord but we know the
[38:46] coming of the Lord is an actual event
[38:48] that takes place the the Rapture the the
[38:51] the Advent of Christ the actual uh
[38:53] second coming but we know that that
[38:56] coming had uh multiple phases to it and
[38:59] there was a revelation given of the
[39:01] seventh seal listen friends I truly
[39:03] believe the seventh seal is open here
[39:05] tonight now though the coming of the
[39:07] Lord hasn't physically happened yet we
[39:09] know that the coming of the Lord started
[39:11] with a shout that would gather a bride
[39:14] around a message and it would come in a
[39:16] shout a voice and a trumpet can you say
[39:18] Amen tonight and we know that brother
[39:21] bham says that what what the trumpets
[39:23] are to Israel the seals are to the
[39:25] Gentiles
[39:27] and so the prophet of God would begin to
[39:29] teach us and show us how that under
[39:31] Revelation 6 there was uh six seals but
[39:34] the seventh seal was left off and in
[39:36] fact you turn your Bible over to
[39:38] Revelations chapter 7 and there's no
[39:40] seventh seal you don't find the seventh
[39:42] seal until Revelations chapter 8 because
[39:45] the prophet said that there was he
[39:47] called it uh uh a a an interval of time
[39:50] and he said Revelation 7 was between the
[39:53] sixth and the chapter 6 and chapter 8 in
[39:57] other words between the Sixth Seal and
[39:59] the seventh seal there would be an
[40:00] interval of time Revelation 7 which the
[40:03] prophet of God said was to Israel it was
[40:06] the calling of the
[40:08] 144,000 right and so we know that that
[40:11] that even though this hasn't taken place
[40:14] yet in time chronologically yet yet the
[40:17] seal was open and the anointing of that
[40:20] pre-tribulation six seal literally Came
[40:23] Upon the heart of Stalin ikan Hitler and
[40:26] brother bam said what was those plagues
[40:28] that came to that trumpet that sounded
[40:30] all the all the seven trumpets sound
[40:32] under the Sixth Seal you say brother mat
[40:34] well this isn't making sense brother bam
[40:36] said the sick seal is the Tribulation
[40:38] seal we're not in the tribulation oh God
[40:40] I hope we're not in the tribulation
[40:42] period yet but yet we know that even
[40:44] though the six seal happening of the
[40:46] tribulation period hasn't taken place
[40:49] yet because Mercy still here there's a
[40:51] gentile dispensation still going there's
[40:54] still the calling out of the Bride
[40:55] that's still happen happening right now
[40:57] brother bandam said what is this this is
[40:59] the Feast of
[41:00] Pentecost right and the prophet of God
[41:03] said when did the Feast of Pentecost
[41:04] start it started on the on the on the on
[41:07] the uh uh in the book of Acts when when
[41:10] God poured out the Holy Ghost upon the
[41:12] church what was that that was the Feast
[41:15] of Pentecost and brother bham says that
[41:17] that Feast last all the way through all
[41:19] seven Church
[41:21] ages so all the way there's a feast of
[41:23] Pentecost from Ephesus all the way to
[41:25] the AG that you're living in you say
[41:27] when does it end brother bam said it
[41:29] ends with the calling out of the Bride
[41:31] now that's not the calling of you or
[41:33] your soul that means when God takes the
[41:35] Gentile body off of the Earth the
[41:38] Pentecostal Feast is over and then the
[41:41] prophet says then what's next is the
[41:42] Feast of atonement brother Bron picks it
[41:44] up and he says notice the Feast of
[41:46] atonement is not a it's not a feast of
[41:49] to slay the lamb again can you say Amen
[41:52] it's not a feast to slay the lamb he
[41:54] says but it's to grieve over the the
[41:56] lamb that was slain he says because
[41:58] under that Feast of atonement those Jews
[42:00] will look upon him who they've pierced
[42:04] and they'll mourn you can't imagine that
[42:06] now the arrogancy that the Jews have now
[42:09] and the way that they talk about Jesus
[42:10] and the way they talk about Christ my
[42:12] goodness friends listen that's just the
[42:14] blindness that God put in their hearts
[42:17] but one day he's going to send two
[42:19] prophets and those prophets are going to
[42:21] preach the same message that you have
[42:23] preached to you tonight listen friends
[42:25] Moses and Elijah in Revelations 11 they
[42:27] won't preach a different message they
[42:29] won't preach something new they'll
[42:31] actually be preaching the message of the
[42:34] hour and the Bible says that that
[42:36] they'll receive the sealing of the Holy
[42:39] Ghost oh my brother and my sister if the
[42:42] message that J that Moses and Elijah
[42:44] will preach will seal the 144,000 what
[42:47] do you think it'll do to a gentile
[42:49] believer who preaches the message of the
[42:51] hour the true atonement it'll seal you
[42:54] to the day of your Redemption H
[42:58] Hallelujah and so brother bam says what
[43:00] was it those two prophets Moses and
[43:02] Elijah that that that prophetic Ministry
[43:05] would turn the hearts of the fathers
[43:07] back to the children it would be the
[43:10] ministry of Elijah and Moses that would
[43:12] do this brother bam says it's literally
[43:15] who they were I just read it today he
[43:18] talks about Elijah Elijah was never
[43:19] killed and he says so he's got to die
[43:22] Moses was never killed Michael the
[43:24] Archangel disputed with Satan over the
[43:26] body of Moses brother Adam says why
[43:28] because he was never buried he was he
[43:30] never mortally died he still got to die
[43:32] that's why the prophets in Revelations
[43:34] 11 will have to die and their body lay
[43:36] in the streets but you say brother M
[43:38] could it really be as brother Brandon
[43:40] was just hearing him say this today they
[43:41] say brother bam you say could it really
[43:43] be Moses and Elijah and he says well
[43:45] look on in in in in Mount
[43:47] Transfiguration there was Moses and
[43:49] Elijah with Jesus
[43:52] Christ and so so what was this this was
[43:55] a it was a spirit let me get back to my
[43:58] thought here tonight it was a spirit
[44:00] that was released under the sick seal
[44:04] and it went into the atmosphere listen
[44:06] friends the world you live in is
[44:08] literally under the anointing of a
[44:11] tribulation seal amen that's why the
[44:14] Bible that's why the brother Bon would
[44:16] prophesy and say I prophesy to you in
[44:18] the name of the Lord the world will go
[44:21] completely insane amen wow you're living
[44:26] in
[44:27] it wake up you're living in it I don't
[44:30] care how good South Carolina is down in
[44:32] the South how good it is in the South
[44:33] how we're the Bible bound how we're a
[44:35] Christian Nation founded on judaic
[44:37] Christian values listen friends that's a
[44:39] that's a day of History that's yesterday
[44:42] that's not
[44:43] today people are living on the Mirage or
[44:45] a memory of the past I'm here to tell
[44:48] you right now the world has gone
[44:50] completely insane it is drank the it is
[44:53] ingested the spirit of the sick SE
[44:56] that's why you see the the hatred for
[44:58] Jews hatred for the for the little land
[45:00] of Israel doesn't make
[45:03] sense doesn't make any sense the only
[45:06] way it could make sense is that it was
[45:08] prophecy being
[45:11] fulfilled that's right you believe that
[45:14] tonight it doesn't make any
[45:17] sense you couldn't put a rational reason
[45:19] why would the world you see the world
[45:21] uniting mobs and protest all around the
[45:25] world they had to shut an entire airport
[45:27] down in Russia when the refugee Jews had
[45:30] flown out of Israel and flown to Russia
[45:33] they had to shut the airport down
[45:35] because there was thousands of
[45:36] protesters ready to mob and assault
[45:40] these Jews who are running from refugees
[45:43] from Israel from the
[45:47] war
[45:48] how you say oh my goodness brother Matt
[45:51] that listen friends I'm going to tell
[45:52] you there's only one way how and that's
[45:55] because there's a spirit of destruction
[45:57] brother brandom says before God could
[45:59] ever destroy the world they have to get
[46:02] into the spirit of destruction first
[46:05] amen and so the world that you live in
[46:07] today is getting into the spirit did you
[46:10] know brother brandom said that he says
[46:13] before God could ever destroy the world
[46:16] they would have to fall under the spirit
[46:18] of
[46:19] destruction that's why that that that
[46:22] that's exactly why you live in a world
[46:23] full of hatred hatred
[46:28] senseless hatred yeah amen I thought
[46:31] about this today I thought it it doesn't
[46:32] even make sense it's it's just s
[46:36] senseless hatred listen friends the
[46:39] world that you live in that you rub
[46:40] shoulders with every single day is a
[46:42] short-tempered uh a
[46:45] toxic hateful uh listen friends there's
[46:49] a kindness is a thing of the past in the
[46:51] world we live in amen do you believe
[46:54] that anybody believe that here tonight
[46:56] am and so it would it would have to be
[46:58] this way the world is getting under the
[47:01] spirit of destruction and listen friends
[47:03] I'm just here to go ahead and preach
[47:05] this to you tonight if the world can get
[47:07] into a spirit of destruction under a
[47:10] sick seal how much more can the bride of
[47:12] Christ come under the anointing of the
[47:15] seventh seal under the seventh messenger
[47:17] with a Rapture anointing to change our
[47:21] bodies I say before God can ever change
[47:23] our bodies we got to come under the
[47:24] anointing of a seven seal the coming of
[47:27] the Lord to say Lord I don't want any of
[47:29] this hatred and Malice in the world I
[47:31] don't want any of the spiritual uh Lady
[47:33] of SE a world that I live in God I want
[47:36] an anointing of the Rapture to come and
[47:38] indwell my body indwell my mind Lord
[47:42] Jesus so what would it be it would be a
[47:45] even even prophesy this is what
[47:47] Zechariah prophesies
[47:49] here and you notice this it's the it's
[47:52] the you see it in in it appears 16 times
[47:56] times and in in verse 12 and verse 13 he
[47:59] keeps saying this in that day you notice
[48:02] there in your Bible look at Zechariah
[48:03] Chapter 12 again and he says in that day
[48:07] all the prophets would talk about this
[48:09] and say the day of the Lord they would
[48:10] the Bible refers to this over and over
[48:12] the day of the Lord this is the day of
[48:15] the Lord this means the day of judgment
[48:18] meaning when the Lord
[48:21] judges amen now we already had a a a we
[48:25] already had a supernatural Cloud up here
[48:28] and then brother bham says what did you
[48:30] notice when You' seen that it was the
[48:32] white wigged one supreme deity in
[48:35] Authority judging right
[48:38] hello and so we know this was Christ
[48:41] judging when the Lord would establish
[48:44] his throne uh the then listen friends
[48:47] God has allowed a period of time for
[48:51] man ands and kingdoms to rise and ru
[48:55] rulers to rise and Kings to rise both
[48:58] great and small but there's coming a
[49:00] time when the day of man is over and the
[49:03] day of the Lord
[49:05] begins Hallelujah he's allowed man to
[49:08] live his time there's a day when God
[49:10] allows Satan to be the prince of the
[49:12] power of the air but that day is coming
[49:14] to an end one day can you say Amen that
[49:18] there there is a time there's an
[49:19] allotted time when God allows Satan to
[49:22] be the God of this world
[49:26] amen but there's coming a day yes sir
[49:29] when he dethrones
[49:32] Satan the Bible calls it the day of the
[49:36] Lord It's referred to 16 times it's when
[49:39] there was when Christ returns as the
[49:42] Supreme judge now let's look at it verse
[49:46] one uh chapter if you look at Zechariah
[49:48] Chapter 13 turn in your Bible if you
[49:50] could just here for a moment I want you
[49:52] to look at this here with me and so
[49:55] Zachariah chapter 13 just one chapter
[49:57] over and verse
[50:00] one I got to get off of this because
[50:02] it's not it's just a foundation for
[50:04] where I really want to go so uh let's
[50:07] just read this here and in that day
[50:08] notice there it is again and in that day
[50:12] uh let me pull up the full yes uh shall
[50:14] be a fountain open to the House of David
[50:17] and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for
[50:18] sin and for in cleanness and it shall
[50:21] come to pass in that day that I will cut
[50:23] off the names of the idols out of the
[50:25] land and they shall no more be
[50:26] remembered and I also will cause the
[50:28] prophets and the unclean Spirit to pass
[50:30] out of the land and it shall come to
[50:32] pass notice this here he he continues to
[50:35] go on uh we're just going to skip
[50:37] through some of this but I want you to
[50:38] notice this here it speaks of the siege
[50:41] of Israel that means an entire Gentile
[50:44] Army that surrounds we were just there
[50:47] me and brother Jason uh then brother
[50:49] Travis and our wives were just there in
[50:50] Israel and we got to go there to the to
[50:53] tell megiddo the hill of megiddo
[50:55] literally where the battle of Armageddon
[50:58] will take place it's incredible to me
[51:01] when I was watching when we was just
[51:03] standing there looking and we went out
[51:04] to the Outlook there in that little city
[51:07] and you could just see this Mass just
[51:09] this Valley that is the valley of
[51:12] Armageddon and and it's just this
[51:14] massive Valley this flatland with these
[51:16] mountains on this side and mountains on
[51:18] this side and you just seen for as far
[51:20] as you could see just a a a a flat land
[51:24] uninhabited just out in front of you
[51:25] maybe a road out in the middle and I
[51:27] just sat there and thought to myself and
[51:29] thought my goodness imagine imagine one
[51:32] day coming very soon little did I know
[51:34] just a month later Israel would go be be
[51:37] in
[51:37] war and I thought to myself standing
[51:40] there I thought isn't it incredible as
[51:42] we looked at that to think the Bible
[51:44] prophesies that God will bring all the
[51:48] nations of the earth to this
[51:51] field
[51:53] Amen to this one g geographical GPS
[51:58] location now notice here God says I will
[52:01] make Jerusalem a cup of trembling in
[52:05] other words this isn't going to be a
[52:06] random happening or a random event God
[52:09] wants to make sure it's clear I'm the
[52:11] one calling the shots here amen as I
[52:14] stood there and looked I thought it was
[52:15] incredible here was the great battle of
[52:18] Armageddon that's going to take place
[52:20] and brother bandham says that great
[52:21] battle of Armageddon will simply be the
[52:25] Final War the final
[52:28] battle from the war that started in the
[52:31] Garden of
[52:33] Eden and so through that battle that
[52:36] starts in Eden and yet through all the
[52:39] way down through history there's been a
[52:41] war that's been waging you've been
[52:43] caught in the middle of it but the
[52:45] prophet of God says the final battle
[52:48] will take place in the battle of
[52:52] Armageddon and it will be a it will be a
[52:54] glor Global Army a a a global you want
[52:58] to talk about
[53:00] anti-Semitism anti anti Zionism the
[53:02] Semitic people the hatred for the
[53:05] restoration of the of the nation of
[53:08] Israel you want to you think that it's
[53:10] hatred right now imagine the entire
[53:13] world will turn their back on that even
[53:16] this nation listen friends they talk the
[53:19] the the the the the Bible shows you this
[53:21] nations in Revelations chapter 13 it'll
[53:23] speak like a dragon one day
[53:25] today and that gentle lamb that that
[53:28] gentle oh we just listen friends they
[53:30] the rulers of this world don't even
[53:32] realize it that they're under a
[53:33] pre-tribulation anointing that will
[53:35] eventually lead them to turn their back
[53:37] on that little nation of Israel yeah
[53:40] amen how many believe that here
[53:44] tonight and so there's a there's a
[53:46] there's a a a a a a an escalating this
[53:50] is what has to happen we know this that
[53:52] these kind of things must happen there's
[53:55] got to be an escalation of hatred for
[53:58] the
[53:59] Jews something has to take place because
[54:02] the Bible said it would amen you say do
[54:05] you I don't I don't like it I don't want
[54:07] it but I can't stop it right amen and
[54:10] people can't stop it even those that
[54:12] will stand against them can't stop it
[54:14] because they're under an
[54:15] anointing and so there would be such an
[54:18] extreme hatred for this tiny little
[54:22] small nation that sits in the Crossroads
[54:25] of the
[54:26] world this little bitty nation of people
[54:31] why why does why do you think do you
[54:34] think it's the Jewish life do you think
[54:36] it's their language is it Hebrew that
[54:37] they hate is that what causes the hatred
[54:41] is it the way that they dress is it the
[54:43] way that they look is it the color of
[54:45] their skin it must be racism it must be
[54:47] just they hate the tone listen friends
[54:49] there's one reason why the hatred could
[54:52] come to that level I'm going to tell you
[54:54] why because God set his love for that
[54:57] little
[54:58] nation and the devil hates what God
[55:00] loves oh friends do you realize why why
[55:04] all hell is against you cuz God has set
[55:06] his love on you listen friends when all
[55:09] hell rushes in you ought to you ought to
[55:11] take you ought to rejoice and say God
[55:14] that must prove you've got a lot of love
[55:16] I might not feel like I'm much Lord but
[55:18] you must think an awful a lot about
[55:21] meall and the Bible says here it will it
[55:24] will that the entire world will come
[55:27] against them even in chapter 12 it goes
[55:29] into detail to the attack of all the
[55:32] worldwide United Nation Army and it
[55:35] talks about how Israel be will be
[55:37] invaded it's it's it says here it's the
[55:39] burden notice this in verse one the
[55:42] burden the
[55:43] burden of the word of the
[55:46] Lord this is what God is saying this is
[55:49] this is important here Zachariah begins
[55:51] and says this is a burden from the Lord
[55:55] it's a message from the Lord It's
[55:58] directly from the Lord this isn't
[56:01] zachariah's message Zachariah is just
[56:04] the messenger yes amen you know what
[56:08] they did with Zachariah they murdered
[56:11] him y Jesus tells us that in Matthew 23
[56:14] they hated the
[56:16] prophets why because the prophet is who
[56:19] the word of the Lord comes to listen you
[56:22] won't you won't have any hatred from the
[56:24] Devil as long as you don't have the word
[56:26] of the Lord but when you have the word
[56:27] of the Lord and you preach the word of
[56:29] the Lord you speak the word of the Lord
[56:31] you take a stand for the word of the
[56:33] Lord Jesus said they hated me they're
[56:35] going to hate you
[56:38] too and so it's a burden he says the
[56:40] burden the the the the word of the Lord
[56:44] concerning Israel and and he and he says
[56:47] here's what's going to happen it's going
[56:49] to be a this this burden means a weighty
[56:53] revelation it's it's a revelation this
[56:56] is this is a this is like Jesus talked
[56:58] about woe unto them this is something
[57:01] burdensome this is something heavy and
[57:04] then he goes on to say I will make I
[57:06] will make Israel notice this from god
[57:09] notice the
[57:11] prophecy what you're seeing here is God
[57:14] you see God in action through prophets
[57:17] through priests through Kings through
[57:19] people but now you're seeing God
[57:21] himself in action amen okay
[57:26] and God is saying I'm going to be the
[57:28] one orchestrating this there will be
[57:31] people that will be players but I will
[57:33] be in control there will be rulers that
[57:36] will be players or actors in this drama
[57:39] Satan actually will be the prime actor
[57:42] oh yeah little does he know why did
[57:44] Brother Adam say when would Jesus When
[57:46] God says I'll bring all the nations of
[57:48] the earth as I sat there and looked at
[57:50] that field and I was talking to brother
[57:51] Travis I said isn't incredible that God
[57:53] says I'll gather all nations to this
[57:55] field and you say why would God do this
[57:57] to bring all and he goes on and zachar
[57:59] says because I'll have them all in one
[58:02] place to pour out my wrath upon them
[58:09] amen God says there's going to be
[58:12] players but God is going to be the
[58:15] director yes amen God is the one doing
[58:19] this that's why from verse two to verse
[58:21] 9 you read these statements God says in
[58:24] verse 2 Zechariah 12 God says in verse
[58:27] two behold
[58:30] I I personal pronoun I will do this
[58:34] behold I will make Jerusalem verse three
[58:39] I will strike verse four I will open
[58:44] verse six I will make verse N I will set
[58:48] verse 10 I will
[58:51] pour what is he saying here in the first
[58:54] person you don't find this anywhere else
[58:56] in the Bible God is saying I want you to
[58:59] catch this this is something that I'm
[59:01] going to be doing this is Sovereign this
[59:03] is this is God saying I'm going to be
[59:06] the one in control of the future of the
[59:09] world oh can you say Amen let me say
[59:12] this the the civilization is not some
[59:15] random thing that's like a clock wound
[59:17] up that God just wound up it's just
[59:19] going through time and one day the wrong
[59:21] person will will push the wrong button
[59:23] and all the world will end and all time
[59:25] will end listen friends that ain't how
[59:27] God runs
[59:28] things amen God knows the specific day
[59:33] hour minute hallelujah amen and he's
[59:36] making this clear in Zechariah Chapter
[59:39] 12 I I want to remove all possibility of
[59:44] you wondering how human history will
[59:49] end there's not going to be any mystery
[59:52] the world is not going to come to an end
[59:54] by some great random event or some
[59:57] Collision some great environmental
[59:59] catastrophe and eventually global
[1:00:01] warming will just cat the catch the
[1:00:03] atmosphere on fire and everyone's going
[1:00:05] to burn or some comment from the you
[1:00:07] know stratosphere is going to implode
[1:00:09] the world Listen friends it's not going
[1:00:11] to be some random event it's not going
[1:00:14] to be something that goes wrong are you
[1:00:16] catch are you hearing me tonight it's
[1:00:18] not going to be something that just
[1:00:19] mishap just a mishap that happens and
[1:00:22] everybody's listen that's how people run
[1:00:24] their lives
[1:00:25] they the anxiety and the nervousness
[1:00:28] that the the the world is completely
[1:00:30] drunk with is because they have no
[1:00:34] Revelation and when you have no
[1:00:36] Revelation everything is uncertain yes
[1:00:40] amen it's uncertainty that produces
[1:00:44] anxiety it's uncertainty of what's going
[1:00:46] to happen that produces fear at the
[1:00:48] Bible prophesies and said men's Hearts
[1:00:51] will actually
[1:00:53] fail
[1:00:56] to and say I'm so glad I've got a
[1:00:59] revelation I'm so glad I've got a
[1:01:02] stability I've got an answer to the
[1:01:04] devil's question there's nothing
[1:01:06] uncertain about my life everything has
[1:01:08] already been mapped out planned out
[1:01:10] orchestrated to
[1:01:12] [Music]
[1:01:14] God we're not going to be blasted you
[1:01:16] know into some tiny bits because of some
[1:01:19] comment or some asteroid but let me say
[1:01:21] it this way God says the ending of all
[1:01:24] time time is clearly defined in
[1:01:27] scripture amen and here's how it's
[1:01:30] defined I will I will set I will pour I
[1:01:37] will bring
[1:01:39] amen God's saying you know who's going
[1:01:42] to bring the world to the to its
[1:01:43] conclusion
[1:01:46] me not Putin not Biden not Trump if he
[1:01:51] gets
[1:01:53] reelected
[1:01:55] I'll say that again not Trump if he gets
[1:01:57] reelected listen there will be players
[1:01:59] there will be actors but it will be God
[1:02:02] listen I just want to tell the devil
[1:02:04] tonight you don't control my life in
[1:02:06] fact you don't have any levers of my
[1:02:09] life in your control you don't have any
[1:02:12] Avail you don't have access to the
[1:02:13] buttons that control my life my life is
[1:02:16] surrounded and shielded by almighty God
[1:02:19] and God pulls the levers and God pushes
[1:02:21] the buttons that's why I can say Lord it
[1:02:23] doesn't matter what happens to me I may
[1:02:25] breathe my last breath here on this side
[1:02:27] it's because you chose that exact moment
[1:02:30] at that exact time and you know best
[1:02:32] lord the devil doesn't say when my life
[1:02:35] ends brother bandham said that the devil
[1:02:37] can't even touch you can't take you
[1:02:39] until God's finished with
[1:02:41] you we ought to get a resounding
[1:02:45] amen and so it's this hatred that comes
[1:02:49] uh the the the description of the Bible
[1:02:51] says all the nations of the earth will
[1:02:53] gather against Jerusalem and Judah
[1:02:56] against the people of Israel and so the
[1:02:59] Bible talks about this and talks about
[1:03:00] it says it's a cup of of trembling this
[1:03:04] this this word cup is I can't pronounce
[1:03:06] the uh the the the word that that the
[1:03:09] the the the uh Hebrew word here but it's
[1:03:11] not like a cup like a like a cup of
[1:03:14] coffee but it's a cup it's it's because
[1:03:17] a cup like that is something that
[1:03:19] someone drinks from but this is
[1:03:21] something that the the the the Bible
[1:03:23] uses this word here and it says that
[1:03:25] it's a not just a coffee cup but it's
[1:03:28] actually a large Basin Amen in other
[1:03:31] words all the nations of the Earth have
[1:03:34] drunken of the wine of her
[1:03:37] fornication it's not just a little
[1:03:39] anointing that comes upon the nation of
[1:03:41] America but it actually engulfs the
[1:03:44] entire
[1:03:46] world
[1:03:48] globally do you know that that is the
[1:03:51] power of a spirit a spirit can bring an
[1:03:53] anointing globally not just to one
[1:03:56] person but to many that's why the Holy
[1:03:59] Ghost is the same in America as it is in
[1:04:02] Africa the Holy Ghost is the same in
[1:04:04] Africa as it has in as as it is in
[1:04:07] Russia and the same spirit that comes
[1:04:10] upon the world in the end time is The
[1:04:12] Same Spirit that's anointing Russia it's
[1:04:14] anointing China it's anointing America
[1:04:17] the Bible says they have all drank from
[1:04:19] the wrath of her fornication can you say
[1:04:22] amen amen and so this is this is the age
[1:04:27] that you live in it's an age of
[1:04:30] hatred it's an age of inclusion where
[1:04:33] you have our group and our people and
[1:04:36] our click and our Circle this is where
[1:04:39] denominationalism forms from the same
[1:04:42] exact Spirit of unity is upon the
[1:04:44] denominational church that's why it's
[1:04:46] called The Binding of the
[1:04:48] tears because they have to have
[1:04:50] something to unify them something to be
[1:04:53] identified with can can I turn a corner
[1:04:54] here tonight something to be identified
[1:04:58] with but it's the same Spirit a spirit
[1:05:01] of
[1:05:04] hatred you know I I just I just hear
[1:05:06] today just just hearing God's Prophet
[1:05:09] talk about Divine love and I thought you
[1:05:12] know Divine love is something so
[1:05:14] different than human love because human
[1:05:17] love is fleeting it's
[1:05:19] emotional you love when it's good but
[1:05:22] you don't when it's not but Divine love
[1:05:25] is a love that's not not
[1:05:29] conditional it's not it's not
[1:05:31] constrained or controlled by exterior
[1:05:38] circumstances and so God says God says
[1:05:41] while the world has dranken from a from
[1:05:44] a basin of
[1:05:46] hatred amen I'm going to give a basin of
[1:05:49] divine
[1:05:50] love I'm going to send gifts to the body
[1:05:54] now listen they not not evil things
[1:05:56] these are good things things to
[1:05:58] encourage things to strengthen amen why
[1:06:01] does God send gifts to the body not to
[1:06:03] tear down but to build
[1:06:06] up you ought to never use your gift to
[1:06:08] tear down that's not why God gave it to
[1:06:11] you he gave it to build up he gave it to
[1:06:15] to to strengthen it's what we read here
[1:06:18] in our in our Bible in our opening text
[1:06:20] in in in Ephesians to where every joint
[1:06:23] Supply
[1:06:24] and so we live in an age where the Bible
[1:06:27] the scripture talks about that they'll
[1:06:29] be heady high-m minded amen right amen
[1:06:34] how many here believe right now you you
[1:06:36] you live under the Fulfillment of that
[1:06:41] scripture where they're heav high-minded
[1:06:45] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:06:49] God doesn't mean they won't be lovers of
[1:06:53] God you see a uh one of the most binding
[1:06:55] Spirits is a religious spirit oh yes
[1:06:58] Amen to say I love God but I don't want
[1:07:01] his
[1:07:03] word but I'm here to say Lord I want
[1:07:05] your word I want all of your word not
[1:07:09] just some of it listen friends not just
[1:07:12] a part of it but all of it amen as
[1:07:16] brother brandham says it won't just be
[1:07:17] the they won't just point you to one
[1:07:20] part of the word but the whole
[1:07:22] word the entire so God says I'm going to
[1:07:25] send gifts and it's incredible to me
[1:07:28] because you know brother Bron preached
[1:07:30] this in Romans 12 and he talks about the
[1:07:33] diversities and the varieties of gifts
[1:07:36] even in Romans 12 it says let ministers
[1:07:38] wait on their Minister and teachers wait
[1:07:41] on their teaching and those that exhort
[1:07:44] wait on their exhortation and so God
[1:07:47] clearly says in Romans 12 there's
[1:07:49] diversities people are different not
[1:07:52] everybody's the same amen I'm going to
[1:07:55] turn a corner here so just stay with me
[1:07:57] here just for a moment but you know
[1:07:59] human nature carnal nature Fallen nature
[1:08:03] that you still have after you're born
[1:08:07] again I said carnal nature Fallen nature
[1:08:11] human nature that you still have well
[1:08:14] I'm filled with the holy ghost from the
[1:08:16] head of my from my head to my toes man
[1:08:18] it comes out of it comes out of my mouth
[1:08:20] I'm overflowing with the with the Holy
[1:08:22] Ghost come on that's fine that's good
[1:08:26] praise God for it you still live with a
[1:08:28] sticky
[1:08:31] nature and in that sticky nature if
[1:08:34] you're if the the if in that I'm just
[1:08:35] going to move on let me keep
[1:08:38] going you know what it is about Fallen
[1:08:41] nature you know what you know what
[1:08:42] people like people like everything to be
[1:08:46] in their box
[1:08:49] right and anything that's outside of
[1:08:51] their box uh it's lesser than good we'll
[1:08:54] just call it that less than ideal but
[1:08:58] people listen the Bible speaks clearly
[1:09:00] about diversities of gifts teachers we
[1:09:03] just read it in Ephesians chapter 4 and
[1:09:05] he gave some teachers a prophets
[1:09:08] Apostles evangelists pastors for the
[1:09:11] edification of the body not the tearing
[1:09:15] down not to give place to hatred and
[1:09:18] bitterness and Malice and envy but the
[1:09:21] Bible goes further didn't we just read
[1:09:22] about it to be kindly affectionate one
[1:09:26] towards
[1:09:28] another but people do you realize this
[1:09:31] is what makes up a
[1:09:34] cult that's what makes up a coat is one
[1:09:40] culture only room for your
[1:09:44] favorite and your
[1:09:47] preference oh boy it's quiet in here did
[1:09:49] you hear
[1:09:51] that this is what makes up a cold I'm
[1:09:53] just telling telling you read it right
[1:09:55] from Brother Google if you
[1:09:57] want when you only have room for your
[1:10:00] flavor or your kind or your idea or your
[1:10:03] purpose listen friends I'm just going to
[1:10:05] go on and say a lot of things that we
[1:10:06] call uh sinful and wrong and right
[1:10:09] really just are our
[1:10:11] preferences I'm not I'm I'm not here I'm
[1:10:13] here to preach to you there's things
[1:10:14] that are clearly wrong and clearly right
[1:10:17] but if we're not careful we get so
[1:10:19] clammed down and narrow-minded that we
[1:10:21] put anything outside of how we were
[1:10:23] raised how we grew
[1:10:28] up but God is a god of
[1:10:32] variety God is not a God who cuts anyone
[1:10:35] out let me just goe and preach to you
[1:10:37] there are no orphans in God's family
[1:10:40] there are no outcasts in his family
[1:10:43] there are no rejects in his family in
[1:10:46] fact God doesn't put anybody
[1:10:50] out we put people
[1:10:52] out
[1:10:54] we cut out anything and every everyone
[1:10:56] that's not like us doesn't talk like you
[1:10:59] look like you this is really where
[1:11:02] racism is this is it's the same exact
[1:11:05] Spirit you say brother man where in the
[1:11:06] word are you going it's the same exact
[1:11:08] spirit that you're seeing in Zechariah
[1:11:10] 12 that comes upon the entire
[1:11:13] world because they won't
[1:11:15] unify because they won't be different
[1:11:18] because they want to be different they
[1:11:20] won't come under order they won't come
[1:11:23] under the Harmony the same
[1:11:26] Rhythm and many people think that the
[1:11:29] biggest listen I'm just going to go and
[1:11:31] preach here for a moment I just reading
[1:11:32] from my notes God makes everyone
[1:11:35] different I'll go a little bit further
[1:11:36] and can I bring it down just a little
[1:11:38] bit more not everybody's the same not
[1:11:42] everybody thinks like you not everybody
[1:11:45] thinks the thoughts that you think not
[1:11:48] everyone has the same perspective that
[1:11:50] you have not everybody is the same uh
[1:11:53] listen not everybody preaches the
[1:11:56] same if we're not careful we think that
[1:11:59] the only one who's preaching is the man
[1:12:01] who's got the the the foam cover filled
[1:12:03] with
[1:12:05] Slava or he's not red-faced or he's not
[1:12:09] yelling and screaming listen I you
[1:12:12] obviously would know that's I've got a
[1:12:13] preference I prefer preaching I I prefer
[1:12:17] spitting and screaming and red face
[1:12:20] yelling but God didn't make everybody
[1:12:23] that way amen amen
[1:12:27] hello God didn't make everybody some
[1:12:30] people are
[1:12:31] are you know you know what what can
[1:12:34] cause so much confusion and so much
[1:12:40] disharmony
[1:12:42] is Unity is not all of us agreeing on
[1:12:46] everything I'm just going to go ahead
[1:12:48] and preach because I'm out here on a
[1:12:50] limb and I got one option I'm just got
[1:12:52] to keep going
[1:12:54] Unity is not all of us agreeing on
[1:12:57] everything you might disagree with me
[1:12:59] I'm positive I'll disagree with
[1:13:02] you you might not share the same exact
[1:13:04] opinions that I do does that put me out
[1:13:06] and you in or me in and you out
[1:13:12] nope so people say oh well you know
[1:13:15] we've got we've got problem with
[1:13:16] intellectual intellectual people uh you
[1:13:19] know because brother bandom had so much
[1:13:21] to say about intellectual preaching and
[1:13:23] I'm all I'm against it brother Brandon
[1:13:25] was against dry-eyed
[1:13:27] intellectualism but listen friends
[1:13:29] there's been as many spitting screaming
[1:13:32] slobbering Dynamic Fireball preachers
[1:13:35] that have stood behind pull pits and led
[1:13:37] lives of
[1:13:40] adultery the problem has not been the
[1:13:43] preference the problem has been they
[1:13:46] haven't been filled with the Holy
[1:13:48] Ghost
[1:13:50] hello the problem is not the type of
[1:13:52] person
[1:13:53] ality because I've
[1:13:56] learned there's different
[1:13:59] personalities and people are different
[1:14:02] and people look at things different and
[1:14:04] people view things different I got a
[1:14:05] question it doesn't matter what I think
[1:14:07] or what you think it only matters really
[1:14:09] right what God
[1:14:11] thinks amen and so so not all of us are
[1:14:15] the same people from the South are
[1:14:18] different I don't care what you say than
[1:14:20] people from the north Amen brother Ken
[1:14:25] he ain't from there
[1:14:27] anymore people from the East are
[1:14:30] different than people from the West take
[1:14:33] my word for it right brother Matthew
[1:14:35] very different my father-in-law told me
[1:14:37] when I first moved to Arizona I was 18
[1:14:39] years old he said Matt you got to get to
[1:14:41] you got to learn something because I
[1:14:42] just wanted after church I wanted to go
[1:14:44] over to people's house and fellowship
[1:14:46] and have lunch and spend the day
[1:14:47] together people weren't like that out
[1:14:48] there the church got over and they were
[1:14:50] G man back to their cars all to their
[1:14:52] different locations he said you got to
[1:14:53] realize people in Arizona are a lot like
[1:14:55] the cactus they're real sticky don't get
[1:14:57] too
[1:14:59] close they're different now not all of
[1:15:03] them are like that there's some born no
[1:15:04] I'm just
[1:15:06] kidding I really mean not all of them
[1:15:08] are like that you go into different
[1:15:09] parts of Arizona they're not that way
[1:15:10] you go into certain Southern Parts more
[1:15:12] towards the desert listen people are
[1:15:15] different people from the East are
[1:15:17] different than people from the west and
[1:15:19] there's good about them and there's bad
[1:15:21] about us and there's positives about
[1:15:24] them and negatives about them and
[1:15:26] there's positives about the south and
[1:15:29] believe it or not some negatives about
[1:15:31] the south Amen in fact it would be our
[1:15:34] area that would be called The Rebel
[1:15:37] State and you think that doesn't pass on
[1:15:39] down to people to have a rebellious re
[1:15:42] rebel against Law and Order right amen
[1:15:45] all right you true Saif Southerners you
[1:15:47] got to say Amen to the word of God it's
[1:15:49] true
[1:15:51] anyway listen not not all people are the
[1:15:54] same H there's different flavors there's
[1:15:57] different foods it even gets bigger when
[1:15:59] you look at different countries amen
[1:16:02] different countries people approach
[1:16:05] things
[1:16:06] different do you know in China when I
[1:16:08] was in China in 2014 whatever it was do
[1:16:11] you know that over there it's a good
[1:16:14] thing when the church
[1:16:18] splits because it means your church has
[1:16:20] grown to such a size that you're going
[1:16:21] to have attention from the government so
[1:16:23] you actually have to go in and split the
[1:16:25] church and one Pastor takes one group
[1:16:28] and another Pastor takes another group
[1:16:30] imagine trying that here in the
[1:16:33] States but in China it's a good thing
[1:16:35] the church in chind doall when it split
[1:16:37] it got over 200 people two brothers
[1:16:38] Pastor got together got with the
[1:16:39] minister and said let's pray God gives a
[1:16:41] finds he sends the right man which one
[1:16:43] of you out of all these brothers to to
[1:16:45] to lead the other Church they split the
[1:16:47] church down the middle half the church
[1:16:48] went down to a church about 30 miles
[1:16:50] down the road One Church of the north
[1:16:52] one Church of the South wow it's
[1:16:56] different it's a different Playbook try
[1:16:58] to play by our Playbook over there and
[1:17:00] say well you know you the the word of
[1:17:02] God is clear listen the word of God is
[1:17:04] clear but there's differences in
[1:17:06] varieties and
[1:17:09] applications okay Lord this is what you
[1:17:11] wanted me to preach
[1:17:12] now does that mean that God is only
[1:17:15] going to Rapture the people out of the
[1:17:20] South or the people in the United States
[1:17:23] of America they asked brother Bon that
[1:17:24] question we got to live in Tucson we got
[1:17:25] to live in Indiana does everyone got to
[1:17:27] move move listen friends this is this is
[1:17:30] the thinking that's upon carnal
[1:17:34] nature and so do does it mean that God
[1:17:37] only loves people from this place or or
[1:17:39] this country or does it mean the that
[1:17:41] the bride of Christ around the world
[1:17:43] will all act the same talk the same even
[1:17:47] look the same listen they don't all look
[1:17:48] the same and certain cultures I visited
[1:17:51] in certain countries the way that that
[1:17:53] they dress it's modest there's modesty
[1:17:55] they're dressed according to the message
[1:17:57] of the hour but there's
[1:18:00] differences and so God never intended to
[1:18:04] make us all the same Amen to look the
[1:18:07] same hello
[1:18:09] somebody he didn't want us to all look
[1:18:11] like Southerners I know some of us
[1:18:13] believe that that that that that we
[1:18:15] should but that's not how God intended
[1:18:17] he didn't ever let me just go further
[1:18:19] and say he doesn't even want every
[1:18:21] Church to look like each other amen amen
[1:18:26] he doesn't want this church to match
[1:18:28] another church and that church to match
[1:18:30] another church and that would do
[1:18:32] everything the same way I'm afraid if
[1:18:34] we're not careful that's what's happened
[1:18:36] in the message is everybody has a
[1:18:38] benchmark and they all try to be like
[1:18:40] this one or be like that one or look
[1:18:42] like this one or look like that one
[1:18:44] whatever happened to The Sovereign body
[1:18:46] the local assembly being led by the holy
[1:18:51] ghosten
[1:18:55] amen if we're not careful we lose our
[1:18:57] sovereignty of local
[1:19:00] bodies and I'm afraid even live
[1:19:02] streaming services that's been great we
[1:19:05] do it I love it thank God for it but
[1:19:07] listen friends God Satan will take any
[1:19:09] of these things and pervert them in such
[1:19:11] a
[1:19:12] way I've watched it happen and to where
[1:19:15] you have you have you have preachers
[1:19:16] preaching to a YouTube audience because
[1:19:19] the pastor of this church I've heard it
[1:19:21] myself I'm preaching only here locally
[1:19:23] but I've heard it myself how One Pastor
[1:19:25] was telling another Pastor how that he
[1:19:28] had got up that Sunday and blasted this
[1:19:30] other Pastor because of what that Pastor
[1:19:32] said to his pull pit that he streamed
[1:19:33] his service and he heard what that meant
[1:19:35] so he got behind his pulpit and I'm just
[1:19:37] thinking where are the people in all
[1:19:40] this they might as well dismiss and go
[1:19:44] home if this is what it's really became
[1:19:46] about if we're not careful we become no
[1:19:48] different than the Republicans and the
[1:19:50] Democrats I'm just going to preach it if
[1:19:53] we're not careful we become no different
[1:19:54] than Republicans and Democrats and
[1:19:57] groups over here clicks over here
[1:19:59] denominations over here brotherhoods
[1:20:01] over here what happened to the body of
[1:20:06] Christ I heard one brother saying I
[1:20:09] thought it was so powerful he said you
[1:20:11] know it's just how you tune an
[1:20:12] instrument you don't tune that guitar to
[1:20:14] a tuning pick and then take that guitar
[1:20:17] and you go over to the piano and then
[1:20:19] you tune the piano to that guitar that
[1:20:21] was tuned to the tuning pick then you
[1:20:23] take that piano and you tune the organ
[1:20:25] to the piano that was tuned to the
[1:20:26] guitar that the guitar was tuned to the
[1:20:28] tuning pick then you take the organ and
[1:20:30] you tune it tune the mandolin to the
[1:20:32] organ that was tuned to the piano to the
[1:20:34] guitar that's not how you do it you say
[1:20:37] well I wouldn't they work because
[1:20:38] there's always going to be subtle
[1:20:39] differences what you do is you have one
[1:20:41] absolute Hallelujah you have one
[1:20:44] absolute the word and everybody's tuned
[1:20:47] to the word and when you're all tuned to
[1:20:49] the word you'll get the same result
[1:20:51] you'll get the same manif estation you
[1:20:53] get the same Holy
[1:20:58] Ghost and so was God just going to
[1:21:02] send was God going to make everyone look
[1:21:04] the same act the same all churches all
[1:21:06] preachers will be the same you ain't
[1:21:08] called you ain't even anointed if you're
[1:21:09] not yelling in your voice decimal
[1:21:11] doesn't reach over
[1:21:13] 80 well send me that quote brother send
[1:21:17] me that scripture where does it even say
[1:21:19] it in the Bible listen to what the word
[1:21:21] of God says here turn up my PowerPoint
[1:21:22] if you could listen this is what the
[1:21:25] word this is what the word preach means
[1:21:28] the mark 16:15 he said unto them go you
[1:21:30] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:21:32] to Every Creature this is the word
[1:21:34] Caruso to be a Herald Proclaim properly
[1:21:39] to Herald to
[1:21:42] Proclaim this is why brother brandom
[1:21:44] says you can live a sermon louter than
[1:21:47] you can preach a
[1:21:49] sermon cuz your life can Proclaim
[1:21:52] something
[1:21:53] and affect somebody that my sermon can
[1:21:55] never
[1:21:56] touch it means to announce a message
[1:21:59] publicly and with conviction persuasion
[1:22:03] to be a Herald to officiate as a Herald
[1:22:05] to Proclaim after the manner of a Herald
[1:22:07] always with suggestion of formality
[1:22:09] gravity and Authority which must be
[1:22:11] listened to and obeyed I didn't hear
[1:22:13] screaming I didn't hear getting voices
[1:22:15] over 80
[1:22:17] decimals say brother Matt why are you
[1:22:19] harping on that because I'm here to tell
[1:22:20] you there's a spirit in the world that
[1:22:23] comes upon the entire nation that if
[1:22:25] we're not careful we get under the same
[1:22:29] order of the unification of the world we
[1:22:31] all got to be the same look the same act
[1:22:33] the same talk the same when God is a god
[1:22:36] of varieties and not everybody is the
[1:22:39] same
[1:22:41] amen not all churches are the
[1:22:45] same you ever go overseas how many here
[1:22:47] raise your hand have you've been
[1:22:48] overseas been on a missionary trip not
[1:22:50] to not to Canada
[1:22:54] that's not even overseas how many has
[1:22:56] been on a missionary trip okay good then
[1:22:59] you would know I'm preaching this and
[1:23:00] I'm not just making this up not all
[1:23:02] churches look like our churches in the
[1:23:05] USA brother math that just means they
[1:23:07] haven't caught the Revelation they need
[1:23:08] to close those churches up they need to
[1:23:11] get on live stream take video take
[1:23:13] cameras take pictures look like us dress
[1:23:15] like talk like us act like us sing the
[1:23:17] same songs we sing uhuh that's not what
[1:23:20] it's not God's church amen
[1:23:23] and so does it mean that the bride of
[1:23:25] Christ were around the world well listen
[1:23:27] of course it doesn't mean that because
[1:23:30] what God was going to send to dress the
[1:23:32] bride it wasn't going to be a Southern
[1:23:35] Culture it wasn't going to be a northern
[1:23:38] culture in fact it wasn't going to be an
[1:23:40] American culture can you say Amen today
[1:23:43] but what would dress the bride would be
[1:23:45] the word and it would be a culture from
[1:23:48] above it would be a Heavenly language it
[1:23:51] would be a Heavenly dress code it would
[1:23:53] be a Heavenly
[1:23:54] tongue it would be varieties of people
[1:23:58] with different skin types with different
[1:24:00] languages in different countries but all
[1:24:03] LED under the same Holy
[1:24:06] Ghost then what would be the same it
[1:24:08] would be the same gospel message that
[1:24:11] was resounded and delivered at Pentecost
[1:24:13] would be preached throughout the entire
[1:24:15] bride amen can I get a loud amen here
[1:24:18] tonight listen the prophet of God says
[1:24:20] in Ephesian Church age that is her
[1:24:23] standard that's the pattern there is no
[1:24:25] other pattern what God did at Pentecost
[1:24:28] would be the pattern until the church
[1:24:30] ages in God will not
[1:24:33] change so it Loose I got to move on the
[1:24:37] the the the the the so the spirit and
[1:24:39] the bride would say come so her message
[1:24:42] would be the same I'm not saying that
[1:24:44] you change the message I'm not saying
[1:24:46] it's this church over here that believes
[1:24:48] it this way and we believe it that way
[1:24:49] and that's not what I'm saying amen amen
[1:24:52] I'm saying that there's people that are
[1:24:54] different God didn't make us all the
[1:24:56] same and that's the way God designed
[1:25:00] itah let's hear how brother Brandon
[1:25:02] dealt with people that didn't believe
[1:25:05] like him not that this is the anointed
[1:25:07] ones at the end time not that we
[1:25:08] disagree with you brother to be
[1:25:10] different many of you here might be
[1:25:14] trinitarian preachers
[1:25:20] yeah we don't want to be angry with you
[1:25:26] we love
[1:25:31] you it's amazing to me that a prophet
[1:25:34] could have love for a trinitarian
[1:25:35] preacher who believes in three Gods
[1:25:37] whether he knows it or
[1:25:39] not and yet we can stomp out stifle out
[1:25:42] and talk so disparagingly of another
[1:25:44] brother who believes the
[1:25:46] message but might see something a little
[1:25:48] different than what you see amen amen we
[1:25:52] love you if we didn't if I didn't
[1:25:55] believe that I'd never leave this church
[1:25:58] till I got down there on my knees and
[1:26:00] said God make me
[1:26:04] right a trinitarian
[1:26:07] preacher and yet it's okay for us to
[1:26:10] talk disparagingly about people who
[1:26:11] don't believe like
[1:26:15] us I don't want to be arrogant listen I
[1:26:18] love this he says I don't want that
[1:26:20] arrogant selfish spirit mixed up with
[1:26:23] mine me neither Brother Brandon I want
[1:26:25] my spirit I love this I want my spirit
[1:26:28] to be pure and
[1:26:30] clean Brotherly Love holy with the Holy
[1:26:34] Spirit oh how many just identify with
[1:26:36] that and say I don't want that arrogant
[1:26:38] SE selfish spirit I want my spirit to be
[1:26:41] clean I want it to be holy before
[1:26:46] God if someone does anything wrong to me
[1:26:48] that's all right and though I might have
[1:26:51] the right to to get back at them I don't
[1:26:55] want that in my
[1:26:59] life oh God help us to get back to this
[1:27:02] kind of
[1:27:03] spirit to where we care about the
[1:27:06] spirits that we have in our
[1:27:09] life I don't know about you friends I'm
[1:27:11] just going to be honest with you when I
[1:27:12] read those words I I I nearly collapsed
[1:27:15] I was just cried and cried my eyes out I
[1:27:17] said God there's so many things that I
[1:27:19] could say I don't want that in my life
[1:27:22] and I I look at things in my life and I
[1:27:24] sometimes friends I'll be honest with
[1:27:25] you I look in the mirror and I hate who
[1:27:27] I am oh yeah I believe that any single
[1:27:29] one of us could could say that and say I
[1:27:31] don't like who I am I don't like how I
[1:27:34] act sometimes sometimes I'm
[1:27:36] temperamental sometimes I'm selfish oh
[1:27:38] come on somebody be honest here tonight
[1:27:40] sometimes I say the wrong thing
[1:27:42] sometimes I lose my temper but I'm
[1:27:44] saying tonight I don't want that in my
[1:27:46] life I want to be clean of that
[1:27:51] jesusall
[1:27:52] though I might have the right to get
[1:27:53] back to them I don't he says I don't
[1:27:55] want that in my life I want to have
[1:27:59] love I want to be ready to correct with
[1:28:02] love with love that absolutely answers
[1:28:04] out yonder for it I don't mean to be
[1:28:06] different Methodist Baptist Catholic
[1:28:09] Presbyterian whoever you are I don't say
[1:28:11] these things to be different to be
[1:28:13] Arrogant with you if I did I'm a
[1:28:15] hypocrite and should be down here at
[1:28:17] this altar praying through to God but I
[1:28:19] say it it's because of love
[1:28:22] and I see where you're going now I don't
[1:28:24] say this in myself and saying I'm
[1:28:26] presuming I give you thus saith the Lord
[1:28:29] that is the truth and I love you for
[1:28:31] those things did his love stop him from
[1:28:35] saying the cutting hard things he had to
[1:28:38] say no it didn't stop him but his
[1:28:41] attitude and his Spirit was clean before
[1:28:45] God and it was love that constrained him
[1:28:48] to say it listen in birth pains 1965 if
[1:28:51] I'm make mistakes forgive me I'm not a
[1:28:54] theologian I don't criticize
[1:28:57] theologians theology is all right it's
[1:29:00] what we need but sometimes I criticize
[1:29:03] the condition that we've gotten into
[1:29:05] that doesn't mean to any certain
[1:29:09] individuals it's just the message amen
[1:29:12] can I go further I wish that it wasn't
[1:29:15] mine to give it tears me
[1:29:18] apart you mean this was the disposition
[1:29:22] of a true prophet of
[1:29:24] God he didn't come with that message of
[1:29:27] Wrath and destruction he didn't come
[1:29:30] there licking his chops oh I can't wait
[1:29:31] to get out there and just that wasn't
[1:29:34] the true that wasn't the evidence of a
[1:29:35] true that wasn't the spirit of a true
[1:29:37] Prophet
[1:29:39] hello he says it tears me to Pieces
[1:29:42] because you know how you feel of your
[1:29:43] own children don't you hate to give a
[1:29:46] don't you hate to have to give a child a
[1:29:48] scolding balling out or something though
[1:29:51] I'm a parent too and I know what it
[1:29:53] means and I trust you forgive me God's
[1:29:55] power to transform if somebody would
[1:29:58] come to me something contrary I would
[1:30:00] kind of just argue and argue and argue
[1:30:02] with them and when they didn't see it my
[1:30:05] way I'd get on WhatsApp and i' paste it
[1:30:07] to this person and to that person and to
[1:30:10] that person and say oh that brother's
[1:30:11] just going under intellectualism he's
[1:30:13] just a dry-eyed b you know Reformed
[1:30:15] Baptist he don't even believe the
[1:30:18] message brother bham said something
[1:30:22] contrary I would kind of misunderstand
[1:30:24] it myself I wouldn't want to criticize
[1:30:27] what anyone says we're not to criticize
[1:30:31] each other I'm not guilty of doing that
[1:30:34] I thank the Lord I have criticized sin
[1:30:36] and unbelief but no individual person
[1:30:39] see I don't we are brothers I love this
[1:30:42] and sisters
[1:30:44] striving we are coming down to where
[1:30:46] sister Florence came yesterday morning
[1:30:48] we all got to come that way and it's not
[1:30:51] my purpose to try to criticize a brother
[1:30:54] or sister that wouldn't agree with
[1:30:57] you
[1:30:59] amen I'm afraid as one brother said so
[1:31:02] perfectly we have the message of William
[1:31:04] brandham but we don't have the spirit
[1:31:07] that William brandom delivered it
[1:31:11] in I see a lot of this I should hear a
[1:31:13] lot of this
[1:31:15] amen as one brother said we have the
[1:31:18] message he preached but I'm afraid we
[1:31:20] don't have the spirit in which the
[1:31:22] messenger gave it brother bam says that
[1:31:24] in the church age book it's got to be
[1:31:26] the message and the spirit of the
[1:31:28] message it's got to be set in the spirit
[1:31:30] of
[1:31:31] Christ Hello
[1:31:33] friends it's not my purpose to criticize
[1:31:36] a brother or sister that wouldn't agree
[1:31:37] with you no be it far from me to do that
[1:31:40] I don't think you'll ever find a tape
[1:31:42] that I called anybody's name on which I
[1:31:44] felt many times the person was wrong but
[1:31:47] that's between them and God but what is
[1:31:49] wrong in the way of sin and misunder
[1:31:51] understanding sometimes is not even sin
[1:31:54] it's just misunderstandings of people
[1:31:56] and I think I think I think each one of
[1:32:00] us has a right to express ourself to our
[1:32:05] own understanding
[1:32:08] amen oh God help us to have that kind of
[1:32:11] an
[1:32:12] attitude I think each one of us has a
[1:32:15] right to express ourself to our own
[1:32:18] understanding but you see what a cult
[1:32:20] does is it cuts off anyone who doesn't
[1:32:23] line up with my understanding amen all
[1:32:27] right we'll keep going the way to have
[1:32:29] Fellowship I'd rather have a church
[1:32:31] listen just a moment I'd rather have a
[1:32:33] church that knows nothing about any
[1:32:35] spiritual gift and just be so in love
[1:32:38] with each other and with Christ I'd
[1:32:41] rather have that than every spiritual
[1:32:43] gift operating in the church amen amen
[1:32:47] now that might sound hard in a
[1:32:48] Pentecostal group but I would rather
[1:32:51] have it
[1:32:52] where there is gifts they'll fail where
[1:32:54] there is gifts they'll bring confusion
[1:32:56] where there is gifts they can be
[1:32:57] questioned but when there is love it is
[1:33:00] perfect that's right and if you had
[1:33:03] perfect love you'd have perfect
[1:33:06] gifts that's right so work first with
[1:33:09] love that brings fellowship and
[1:33:13] fellowship brings gifts
[1:33:18] amen and a Pentecostal Church the spoken
[1:33:21] word the original seat is just as bad
[1:33:24] listen to what he identifies with the
[1:33:26] Pentecostal church because brother
[1:33:28] bandham always stood no matter oh my
[1:33:30] goodness I just went way back I'm sorry
[1:33:31] we're not going to repeat these as
[1:33:34] brother brandham uh uh says this is this
[1:33:36] is it he always stood between two things
[1:33:40] I was just hearing the token message
[1:33:41] last night and brother Brandon begins to
[1:33:43] talk about how that we've made
[1:33:44] Thanksgiving a
[1:33:47] tradition and he talks about how that
[1:33:49] one he says everything's just became a
[1:33:51] tradition anymore and he says I was
[1:33:53] watching a Billy Graham meeting and he
[1:33:55] says I watched as they as Billy Graham
[1:33:57] gave the altar call and he says I
[1:33:59] watched a bunch of boys up there around
[1:34:02] the altar punching each other in the arm
[1:34:04] laughing cutting Co giggling hollering
[1:34:07] then
[1:34:08] praying brother Ram says that's not how
[1:34:11] you come to the altar of God you don't
[1:34:13] come giggling and laughing and hooping
[1:34:16] and shouting and
[1:34:17] hollering but he's preaching on the
[1:34:19] token to be identified with your lamb
[1:34:23] and he says when you come to the altar
[1:34:24] you're coming to die yeah amen and so
[1:34:29] brother random hits against that that
[1:34:32] that that that that that uh that take
[1:34:34] towards towards a confession a
[1:34:36] repentance to where it's just made light
[1:34:39] of and he says he says people can pray
[1:34:41] for healing oh God heal me of this heal
[1:34:43] me of that he says but when it comes
[1:34:45] down to real repentance real self-
[1:34:48] sacrifice real dying out to oneself all
[1:34:51] they don't want anything to do with
[1:34:54] that and he says but then Thanksgiving
[1:34:57] has become a tradition and he says I'm
[1:34:59] going to put it in your lap when you
[1:35:01] come to the altar in a dry-eyed
[1:35:03] confession it's just a tradition yeah
[1:35:07] amen and so the prophet of God
[1:35:09] identifies always between two groups the
[1:35:12] Pentecostal group and the Baptist group
[1:35:15] you say well which one was he identified
[1:35:17] with right down the middle of the road
[1:35:19] amen and whether you to accept this or
[1:35:22] not I can show it to you in the message
[1:35:23] brother brandham said he drew from both
[1:35:26] groups they both had a truth both were
[1:35:29] in ditches and I don't want to be in
[1:35:31] neither
[1:35:33] one can I get a hearty amen listen what
[1:35:36] brother ad says in Pentecost church is
[1:35:38] just a bad just as bad a bunch of
[1:35:40] jumping and shouting and speaking in
[1:35:41] tongues and things like that you say
[1:35:43] brother mat you preaching and againsts
[1:35:44] jumping and shouting my goodness you
[1:35:46] know me I'm not preaching against that
[1:35:48] amen but listen to what he says sh
[1:35:52] shouting and speaking in tongues when it
[1:35:53] comes down enough temper to fight a
[1:35:56] buzle and turn you out of their
[1:35:59] congregation you take a person that
[1:36:01] speaks with tongues enough temper to
[1:36:03] fight a buzo and talk about the

[1:36:30] life that changes your
[1:36:34] temper cuz you can have all of the
[1:36:36] jumping and shouting and and
[1:36:41] rejoicing or better have the love of
[1:36:45] Christ down in your heart that'll make
[1:36:47] you encourage one another not talk about
[1:36:50] each other

[1:43:04] anything we ought not make any excuse
[1:43:07] for anything in our personality of how

[1:43:52] heart even as I prepared for this
[1:43:54] message as I was listening to the Token
[1:43:56] not what I preached here tonight but I'm
[1:43:57] just here at the end uh brother BR talks
[1:44:00] about being identified with our
[1:44:02] atonement you know what it means it
[1:44:04] means to be identified with a dying out
[1:44:07] to
[1:44:08] oneself back to our
[1:44:12] sacrifice back to to real genuine love
[1:44:17] if we read in Ecclesiastes chapter 4
[1:44:20] grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby you're
[1:44:22] sealed unto the day of your your
[1:44:24] Redemption then he goes right after
[1:44:27] that he goes right after that and start
[1:44:30] saying don't walk as G other Gentiles
[1:44:32] walk with tattling and back bitings and
[1:44:35] Malice and hatred these things shouldn't
[1:44:37] be named amongst us listen friends I'm
[1:44:40] just going to say this we have the
[1:44:42] example from a prophet of God a true
[1:44:45] Prophet on how to be a
[1:44:49] man
[1:44:52] can I get an
[1:44:53] amen I said we have an example of a true
[1:44:56] prophet of what it means to be a
[1:44:59] man and he wasn't a
[1:45:01] but he also wasn't a
[1:45:04] chauvinist he also wasn't an arrogant
[1:45:07] person he also wasn't a hotty attitude
[1:45:09] person in facts you knows it's been said
[1:45:11] many times brother the Billy Paul said
[1:45:13] the greatest miracle was that you
[1:45:15] couldn't tell his enemies from his
[1:45:17] friends yeah amen amen
[1:45:21] amen we have the example from a prophet
[1:45:25] on how to not be a
[1:45:29] jellyfish not be a compromise you think
[1:45:31] brother bandom compromised with those
[1:45:33] trinitarians when he got to run
[1:45:35] trinitarians he just sort of put his
[1:45:36] Doctrine to the side and said you know I
[1:45:38] just sort of sort of be a chameleon and
[1:45:40] any group of in no that's not what the
[1:45:41] prophet of God did he took a stand for
[1:45:43] the word of
[1:45:44] God we have the example of what it means
[1:45:47] to have a stand for the word of God you
[1:45:49] don't have to be a jellyfish to have
[1:45:51] love you don't have to be a compromiser
[1:45:54] to have love can I get the church to
[1:45:56] give me an amen here tonight come on I
[1:45:57] need them right here at the end you
[1:45:59] don't have to be listen friends you
[1:46:01] don't have to be a jellyfish or a
[1:46:03] compromiser or a weakling without a
[1:46:06] backbone to still have
[1:46:09] love one for
[1:46:11] another we have the example of a prophet
[1:46:15] who could take a stand not be a bad not
[1:46:18] be a compromiser not be a jellyfish but
[1:46:21] still a Man Who Loved a man who was
[1:46:24] gentle a man who was kindly affectionate
[1:46:27] you say the sign of the son of man was
[1:46:29] the ministry of discernment of heart I
[1:46:31] truly believe that but I believe there
[1:46:32] was more to the sign of the son of man
[1:46:34] than just the ministry to discern the
[1:46:36] thoughts and the intents of the heart I
[1:46:38] believe we've seen more in a prophet of
[1:46:39] God I believe we' seen the maturity of
[1:46:41] the nature of Christ in a human being
[1:46:45] and I say God don't just give me the
[1:46:47] message give me the spirit of the
[1:46:49] message
[1:46:51] oh don't just give me doctrines give me
[1:46:53] a
[1:46:55] life give me something that's
[1:46:59] real give me something that breathes
[1:47:02] something that's real something that can
[1:47:04] touch something that can feel something

[1:49:12] just give me this one this one

[1:49:39] heart as a Believer born of the spirit
[1:49:41] of God you know deep down inside of your
[1:49:43] heart there's something there Lord
[1:49:45] that's not like you there's something
[1:49:48] there Lord that I can't find in the the
[1:49:50] word is not identified in the nature of
[1:49:52] Christ I can't justify that
[1:49:55] thing I can't I can't give it I can't I
[1:49:58] can't put any kind of excuse to
[1:50:03] it I know there's things in my life
[1:50:06] things in my flesh oh brother Matt that
[1:50:09] I just I won't free of I I say like the
[1:50:13] prophet of God says I don't want that in
[1:50:15] my life how many honest hands could go
[1:50:17] up before the Lord mine up and sayl I
[1:50:21] don't want that arrogant cruel
[1:50:24] cruel-hearted
[1:50:25] that Spirit of temper I don't want that
[1:50:28] in my life
[1:50:31] Lord say brother Matt is there a cure
[1:50:34] can it be cured is there an answer to my
[1:50:37] bitterness is there an answer to my
[1:50:39] temper oh my brother I got hope for you
[1:50:42] tonight there's hope there's an answer
[1:50:44] to that there's a cure for that Spirit
[1:50:47] of anger there's a cure for that
[1:50:49] bitterness there's a cure for that
[1:50:51] temper it's the true atonement the true
[1:50:55] Holy
[1:50:56] Ghost that's been restored back to you
[1:51:00] where you could really take on the
[1:51:01] spirit of the Lamb that nature not a
[1:51:05] nature to say give me my rights but that
[1:51:07] nature of the Lamb to say I'm going to
[1:51:09] lay down my rights I'm going to become a
[1:51:12] true
[1:51:14] sacrifice oh that runs so contrary to
[1:51:17] the world but it's in the nature of the
[1:51:18] seed that's down inside of you I just
[1:51:21] want to say by an uplifted hand to say
[1:51:22] God give me that true give me that true
[1:51:26] real thing Lord that
[1:51:28] changes give me the fruits of the spirit
[1:51:30] Lord give me that I I want all of it God
[1:51:34] not just part of it I don't ever want to
[1:51:36] settle for any part of my
[1:51:40] Humanity I want to say like David said
[1:51:42] in Psalms 51 I wonder if you could pray
[1:51:44] that prayer David says create in me a
[1:51:48] clean heart amen
[1:51:51] created
[1:51:53] me I love that word because it's so
[1:51:56] special cuz David realize Lord this
[1:51:58] isn't something I can manufacture I've
[1:52:01] tried it in all my best efforts I've
[1:52:02] tried to give myself a Clean Heart Lord
[1:52:05] but I'm going to use a word that only
[1:52:06] applies to the Creator create in me a
[1:52:09] clean heart Jesus and here's another
[1:52:12] word I want to pray and I want you to
[1:52:14] raise your hand if you uh resonate renew
[1:52:16] the right Spirit Within Me oh God renew
[1:52:22] the right
[1:52:23] Spirit Within Me Oh god listen friend
[1:52:27] that's a prayer I can't pray for you you
[1:52:29] got to pray it for yourself you can
[1:52:31] raise your hand and that's wonderful
[1:52:32] that you identify but if you really want
[1:52:35] it if there's really something down
[1:52:36] inside of you you've got to ask the Lord
[1:52:38] and say God I'm praying like David
[1:52:40] create in me a clean heart renew a right
[1:52:44] Spirit within me take not your Holy
[1:52:46] Ghost take Not Your Spirit Away From Me
[1:52:48] Lord

[1:52:53] God you can do it Lord Jesus I believe
[1:52:56] it with all my
[1:52:58] heart as I close here tonight Lord you

[1:53:15] raise my hands and say I want it Lord

[1:54:18] right in the world to live but gave up
[1:54:20] his right God and I'm asking tonight let
[1:54:23] me be identified with that true

[2:03:59] if you have one amen we'll take time
[2:04:01] just for a couple then we'll let you go
[2:04:03] brother JD has a special one from Sister
[2:04:05] Amy he wants to
[2:04:07] give amen so this is a testimony from
[2:04:11] Amy this happened on Saturday um at the
[2:04:15] Youth Camp I'm just going to read what
[2:04:18] she says during the day I was feeling
[2:04:20] off very weak tired and shaky and felt
[2:04:22] my heart
[2:04:23] racing I went back to our room to rest
[2:04:25] hoping that that would do the trick it
[2:04:28] didn't change much so I got ready to
[2:04:30] head down to the cameras get the cameras
[2:04:33] ready for service sister Ruth chatted
[2:04:35] with me a little and decided to call
[2:04:37] Meredith who wanted to check me out
[2:04:38] before service she took my blood
[2:04:40] pressure a couple times which was
[2:04:42] alarmingly high uh 220 over 120 well
[2:04:46] above stroke levels sister mer has made
[2:04:49] the call to have me stay back from
[2:04:50] service and rest and rehydrate my blood
[2:04:53] blood pressure and heart rate came down
[2:04:56] to 170 over 90 so I went ahead and went
[2:04:59] to bed I was streaming the service I
[2:05:01] made it through all the preaching and
[2:05:02] about half of the prayer line when I
[2:05:04] noticed I was feeling badly again I
[2:05:07] turned the service off to go to sleep at
[2:05:09] some point after that I don't know when
[2:05:11] I startled awake to my face feeling
[2:05:13] tingly and my lips starting to feel numb
[2:05:16] my first thought was I wonder if this is
[2:05:18] what the start of a stroke feels like I
[2:05:20] should probably call someone but but
[2:05:22] don't remember anything after that I
[2:05:24] woke up later when people started coming
[2:05:26] back after service and one of the first
[2:05:27] things Jason told me was that Sister
[2:05:30] Sarah had gone and stood for me in the
[2:05:31] prayer line when I told the testimony to
[2:05:34] sister Rachel she she said she'd been
[2:05:37] streaming the service as well and
[2:05:38] towards the end she suddenly had the
[2:05:40] thought that something horrible was
[2:05:42] going to happened to be in my sleep she
[2:05:43] immediately rebuked Satan and prayed for
[2:05:45] me as I began to real realized fully
[2:05:49] what had happened and how how God had
[2:05:51] intervened I remembered an experience
[2:05:53] that I had two weeks prior to Camp that
[2:05:55] gave me the Fuller picture I was home
[2:05:58] alone with Addie and I was looking I was
[2:06:00] looking at her thinking of a trip that
[2:06:02] we have planned for Christmas time a
[2:06:04] thought was dropped into my mind that I
[2:06:05] wouldn't go on that trip because I would
[2:06:07] die before that I didn't say anything
[2:06:10] but was shocked Addie completely unaware
[2:06:12] out of the blue started asking me
[2:06:14] questions about dying and suddenly
[2:06:16] started crying saying mommy I don't want
[2:06:18] you to to die I asked her where that
[2:06:21] came from she said it just popped into
[2:06:22] her head we immediately rebuked Satan
[2:06:25] out loud and went to
[2:06:26] prayer uh she says I've seen both a
[2:06:29] cardiologist and primary care doctor the
[2:06:31] cardiologist said my heart looked good
[2:06:33] he didn't see anything that he was
[2:06:34] worried about and my doctor said that
[2:06:37] it's likely that I had a TIA a mini
[2:06:39] stroke lasting less than 5 minutes but
[2:06:42] that there is nothing that they can do
[2:06:43] to test for it as there was no damage so
