[2:20] good morning everyone let's stand and
[2:22] pray
[2:25] gracious heavenly father we come before
[2:27] you now lord and we ask that your spirit
[2:29] would be present with us
[2:31] lord take your word make it alive in our
[2:34] hearts
[2:35] lord fill us with your spirit
[2:37] with your light with your love
[2:41] we want more of you lord
[2:42] we ask in jesus name amen
[2:45] all right you can go ahead and be seated
[2:50] this is part two of the message of the
[2:52] apostles last time i don't even really
[2:55] know exactly what happened but
[2:57] i uh
[2:59] opened my notes and
[3:00] then proceeded to ignore them for 30
[3:02] minutes so it loosely had something to
[3:05] do with the message of the apostles but
[3:07] i guess the lord had a message he wanted
[3:10] to get across and
[3:11] and
[3:12] so we're going to do part two but really
[3:14] it's the beginning of
[3:16] the message of the apostles
[3:18] so
[3:19] let's pull that powerpoint up again
[3:28] we got it
[3:33] all right
[3:34] wonderful
[3:36] so what is
[3:38] the apostolic message so
[3:40] first of all the message of the apostles
[3:42] is the authoritative
[3:44] teaching of the church that means it's
[3:48] the foundation of the church but more
[3:50] than just the foundation
[3:52] it's the building
[3:54] it's the whole thing
[3:55] we don't have
[3:57] the right to make our own message our
[3:59] own theology
[4:01] built on some foundation of the apostles
[4:04] the original message of the apostles is
[4:07] the pure
[4:09] gospel
[4:10] it's the final
[4:11] word now that doesn't mean god doesn't
[4:14] god stops revealing himself
[4:17] throughout the ages that's not true he
[4:19] continues to reveal himself
[4:21] that's not but everything that he
[4:23] reveals himself is through that message
[4:26] of the apostles
[4:28] in every age
[4:30] we have to return
[4:32] back to the message of the apostles
[4:35] what do we got going on here
[4:38] no powerpoint for a minute okay
[4:41] so again every age we have to return to
[4:44] the apostolic message
[4:46] that is the call to the church and
[4:49] even even more in every age every every
[4:52] local church
[4:53] has to continually judge itself
[4:56] not based on what we think is the right
[4:58] thing to do but judge itself
[5:01] based on the apostles message
[5:04] and teaching
[5:06] salvation is found
[5:09] in one thing
[5:11] that's in the message that the apostles
[5:13] brought
[5:14] it's not merely in calvary
[5:17] you can't stop there you have to
[5:19] continue on
[5:20] calvary will do nothing for you
[5:23] unless you receive the holy ghost
[5:26] how in the world are you going to get
[5:27] the blood applied to you without the
[5:30] holy ghost the life is in the blood
[5:32] there's no chemical blood
[5:34] we don't need to go on a crusade and
[5:37] find
[5:39] the holy grail in hopes that we can get
[5:41] some of the dna of jesus somehow or some
[5:44] there's we don't need
[5:46] even if we found it
[5:48] it would be totally useless
[5:50] to us because the thing that's useful to
[5:52] us to bring forgiveness and salvation
[5:57] is the holy ghost
[5:59] you're not walking in the new testament
[6:01] message
[6:03] without being baptized in the holy ghost
[6:09] all right
[6:10] so
[6:11] second corinthians 5 17 looking at
[6:15] the essential
[6:18] reality of
[6:20] the new testament of the message of the
[6:22] apostles
[6:24] it's not
[6:25] an inherited faith
[6:27] religious confessions
[6:29] statements of faith
[6:31] the core reality is what
[6:34] an experience with god
[6:37] that transforms a person's heart and
[6:39] restores them to the image and likeness
[6:43] of
[6:43] god
[6:44] and that all comes through the
[6:46] historical
[6:48] work of god through who
[6:52] not a prophet not a priest not a king a
[6:54] prophet a priest and a king
[6:56] jesus christ the prophet the priest
[6:59] the king
[7:01] jesus christ through his death
[7:03] burial resurrection and ascension
[7:07] we
[7:08] see this shed forth upon us that's what
[7:10] the apostle peter said
[7:12] on the day of pentecost
[7:13] through his death burial resurrection
[7:16] and ascension
[7:17] he jesus has shed forth
[7:20] this
[7:21] upon us
[7:23] what did they shed what was shed forth
[7:24] the holy ghost
[7:27] so that what is the essential reality of
[7:29] the new testament well what is the new
[7:31] testament
[7:33] there's a promise of a new covenant
[7:35] in through jeremiah
[7:37] i will make a new covenant not after the
[7:40] old covenant not
[7:42] laws written on tables of stone but the
[7:44] word written on our heart
[7:46] so if there's a new covenant there's
[7:48] bloodshed
[7:50] and there's a word written in our heart
[7:52] that's what the baptism of the holy
[7:53] ghost is all about that's the core
[7:56] reality of the message of the apostles
[8:00] there is this transforming power
[8:03] in christ to restore us back
[8:06] to what we were created to be in the
[8:08] first place second corinthians 5 17 says
[8:10] therefore
[8:11] if any man be in christ
[8:15] he's a new creature a new creation old
[8:18] things are passed away
[8:20] behold all things are become new his
[8:23] sins are washed away they're cast in the
[8:26] sea of forgetfulness
[8:27] and he himself has a completely
[8:30] different
[8:31] nature
[8:33] that's the message of the apostles
[8:35] it brings healing and wholeness
[8:38] shalom peace
[8:40] to the entire human being
[8:45] all right so what is salvation salvation
[8:48] in the greek new testament is a word
[8:49] that essentially
[9:02] your desires are new your attitudes
[9:05] are transformed forever your pain
[9:09] your spiritual pain
[9:12] is healed
[9:13] your spiritual scars your spiritual
[9:15] wounds
[9:17] are healed
[9:18] this is the message of the apostles
[9:24] so how do we how do we receive it
[9:26] well
[9:27] it starts with faith
[9:29] matthew 16 16-18 says
[9:32] simon peter replied you are the christ
[9:34] the son of the living god and jesus
[9:37] answered him blessed are you simon
[9:38] barjona for flesh and blood has not
[9:41] revealed this to you but my father who
[9:42] is in heaven and i tell you you are
[9:44] peter and on this rock i will build my
[9:47] church and the gates of hell
[9:49] shall not prevail
[9:51] against it peter is not the rock his
[9:53] name means little stone
[9:55] even jesus himself is not directly the
[9:59] rock
[10:00] the rock is that revelation that peter
[10:03] received of who jesus christ is
[10:07] that's this is the foundation it's not
[10:09] the whole building
[10:11] you can't stop there say i be all i can
[10:14] do is all i've done is believe
[10:16] that's all you do then when you have
[10:18] when you have received this revelation
[10:21] you will
[10:22] receive the holy ghost
[10:24] but this is the foundation
[10:26] we
[10:28] god bridges the gap
[10:31] for us and in us
[10:33] by giving us
[10:34] the revelation of who jesus
[10:37] is
[10:38] it's not a matter of we figured it out
[10:41] we heard a message we decided to make a
[10:43] decision for jesus
[10:45] we prayed the sinner's prayer
[10:47] all these things are additives to the
[10:49] word
[10:51] they're not they're not scriptural you
[10:53] can't find praying the sinner's prayer
[10:56] in the new testament you can't find
[10:58] going through
[11:01] new believers classes in the new
[11:02] testament catechism all those things
[11:05] they're added to the word what does the
[11:07] word say i'm getting way ahead of myself
[11:09] but this is the conclusion
[11:11] of this message is what does the word
[11:13] say
[11:14] it says rep believe believe on the lord
[11:16] jesus christ you'll be saved
[11:19] it doesn't stop there
[11:22] they ask what men and brethren what
[11:23] should we do
[11:25] pray the sinner's prayer go to catechism
[11:27] classes
[11:29] no he said repent
[11:32] and be baptized
[11:34] every one of you in the name of jesus
[11:36] christ for the remission of sins
[11:38] and you shall receive the gift of the
[11:41] holy ghost so what is it faith
[11:44] repentance
[11:46] that water baptism and then holy ghost
[11:48] baptism
[11:50] this is ultimately the message that the
[11:52] apostles brought to us so that we can
[11:54] have what jesus did for us
[11:57] applied to us
[12:01] romans 10 9
[12:04] says because if you confess with your
[12:06] mouth
[12:07] that jesus is lord and believe in your
[12:09] heart that god raised him from the dead
[12:12] you will be saved again
[12:14] this is speaking about a true
[12:17] confession
[12:18] a true
[12:19] repentance
[12:21] it's not just limiting this well if i
[12:23] just confess jesus jesus is lord i'm
[12:25] going to heaven i live anyway no it's
[12:29] this there's there's a whole
[12:31] rest of the new testament there's not
[12:33] just romans 10 verse 9
[12:35] there's other things in the new
[12:37] testament which we just mentioned in the
[12:39] book of acts
[12:40] faith repentance water baptism holy
[12:43] ghost baptism
[12:45] those those steps and then how do i know
[12:48] that i've went through those steps
[12:50] the very same life that was in jesus
[12:52] lives itself through you
[12:53] not because you're pushing it forcing it
[12:55] because
[12:56] he's doing it
[12:59] so that niche the teachings of the new
[13:01] testament
[13:03] form around these this foundational
[13:05] experience
[13:07] that we have with god
[13:10] so there's things like who god is who
[13:12] jesus is who we are
[13:14] in god the work of the
[14:43] you
[15:03] can grow
[15:04] can grow
[15:05] more into the image of jesus christ
[15:09] romans 8 14 says for as many as are led
[15:13] by the spirit of god
[15:15] they are the sons of god to be a son of
[15:18] god
[15:19] means to have a relationship
[15:22] a connection
[15:23] with god it's not a mere title
[15:26] without meaning
[15:28] sonship means
[15:29] there's a close connection
[15:32] even even more than that there's kinship
[15:35] there's a similar nature between the two
[15:38] they share genetics they share a home
[15:41] they share they there's an upbringing
[15:44] there there's a background there
[15:46] it's not a mere title you're i'm a son
[15:48] of god what does it mean
[15:50] means you are led
[15:52] by him it means you hear
[15:55] from him
[15:56] means you follow him what did jesus say
[15:59] follow me
[16:01] as many as are led by the spirit of god
[16:03] they are the sons of god some of these
[16:05] simple things
[16:07] that we hear
[16:08] we want to be a disciple of jesus that's
[16:11] following him not following
[16:13] men not even following men that are
[16:15] called by him but it's following him
[16:21] but the church changed that message
[16:24] over time
[16:26] the church fell away and that's why i
[16:28] say it's a danger
[16:29] to us you say oh we're protected we're
[16:32] in the message
[16:34] if you've looked around a little bit you
[16:36] realize that we're not
[16:38] safe or protected because we're in the
[16:40] message
[16:41] we have to examine ourself
[16:44] pastors need to examine themselves
[16:46] deacons need to examine themselves each
[16:49] of us as believers have to examine
[16:51] what are we accepting what are we
[16:53] receiving are we is our lives
[16:56] is the church i'm going to
[16:58] is the people i'm around are we
[17:00] conforming to
[17:02] what the apostles taught
[17:05] councils were formed
[17:07] in order to decide
[17:10] which doctrines were correct
[17:13] instead of relying on god
[17:15] they formed a political association
[17:20] between those who some who agreed and
[17:22] others who disagreed
[17:28] so
[17:30] after the apostles died you know you
[17:32] understand that we have a certain
[17:34] worldview
[17:35] we look as americans we look at things
[17:37] in a certain way
[17:39] and when other people
[17:40] you know even even to different regions
[17:43] when other people talk in a certain way
[17:46] we understand it differently
[17:48] just a little example is
[17:51] in the north when you say bless your
[17:53] heart it means
[17:55] you're a blessing thank you so much
[17:57] but try to say that to someone down here
[17:59] bless your heart and be like why are you
[18:01] insulting me i did something nice for
[18:03] you and you're calling you're calling me
[18:05] an idiot
[18:08] but that's different what the different
[18:11] parts of the world different places look
[18:14] at things differently and think
[18:16] differently
[18:18] and so
[18:19] when you go from the apostles who are
[18:22] all jewish
[18:24] they have a whole background and of
[18:26] course many things that they
[18:28] held to and held on to
[18:31] even even
[18:32] long past god since since god moved past
[18:35] that
[18:36] they were still struggling with peter
[18:39] struggled
[18:40] uh because not because of himself but
[18:43] because of those looking at him from the
[18:44] outside
[18:46] with eating with gentiles just being
[18:48] around gentiles even after god showed
[18:51] him a vision says don't call what's
[18:54] what i've made clean unclean
[18:57] sends them to them preaches the word
[19:00] he goes on a missions trip with paul
[19:02] sits down and eats bacon and pork chops
[19:06] and
[19:08] then james sends some people
[19:10] to look in on the church there
[19:12] in in galatia
[19:15] and peter says oops i'm going to get in
[19:17] trouble better back away
[19:20] this this is a whole
[19:22] mindset that's taken on for
[19:26] thousands of years
[19:27] right
[19:29] so
[19:30] some things are good about it some
[19:32] things are bad about it but the basic
[19:35] foundation
[19:37] of the jewish understanding is
[19:39] we are in a relationship to obey god
[19:43] and god is who he says he is who he
[19:45] declares himself to be
[19:48] in the
[19:49] in the greek in in roman
[19:52] world
[19:54] philosophy is king
[19:57] and reason is king it's part of why
[20:01] john as as an apostle
[20:05] wrote what he did in john chapter 1 in
[20:07] order to bridge the gap
[20:09] to say
[20:10] you know that that logos that you think
[20:13] created everything and his reason and
[20:15] logic actually
[20:17] god that's god
[20:19] and that god
[20:21] came down and was made flesh
[20:24] and of course they took that
[20:26] and brought a misunderstanding of what
[20:28] that meant
[20:29] as time went on so
[20:31] you look sh there's a shift from a
[20:34] biblical way of thinking
[20:36] to a greek philosophical way of thinking
[20:40] so around the year 150 justin martyr
[20:44] a writer they call him an apologist
[20:46] defender of the faith
[20:48] writes in his letter that john in that
[20:50] the word of john 1 1
[20:53] is a second god
[20:56] right then around the year 2 200 never
[20:59] used before but the writer tertullian
[21:02] uses the word
[21:03] trinitas in latin
[21:06] first time it's ever used in connection
[21:09] with the god of israel
[21:12] so even at this time though there's no
[21:14] doctrine of three co-equal co-eternal
[21:16] persons
[21:17] it wasn't until 30 years later
[21:20] origen who was
[21:22] who was a theologian and actually his
[21:24] but his main job was he was
[21:27] the president of a philosophical
[21:29] university
[21:31] so get understand the backgrounds of
[21:33] some of these men
[21:35] so here is a theologian slash
[21:37] philosophy professor
[21:40] so i have a major in philosophy so i can
[21:42] understand how absurd this is
[21:46] he's going to he's going to bring his
[21:48] philosophy that he's developed which is
[21:51] that
[21:53] the son is actually eternally begotten
[22:00] the eternal generation that's the
[22:02] doctrine the eternal generation of the
[22:04] sun the sun is in the trinitarian
[22:07] thinking the sun is generated from the
[22:09] father but it's any it's eternal
[22:12] it can't have any beginning or end so
[22:14] the sun is just eternally
[22:17] going forth
[22:19] from god so origen in the year 230
[22:23] is the first person
[22:25] who puts this
[22:26] idea forward
[22:28] that there is an eternal
[22:30] sonship there is an eternal
[22:33] son before this
[22:35] every apologist every theologian
[22:37] believed in the two stages of the logos
[22:41] so first you have the logos is in god as
[22:44] his thought or plan
[22:46] then it comes forth just prior to
[22:49] creation it comes forth as a thought as
[22:52] a spoken word
[22:54] and becomes his
[22:56] god's body or theophany his visible
[23:00] representation
[23:02] towards his creation
[23:03] so the two stages of the logos first
[23:05] it's in god as a thought then it's out
[23:07] of god just how brother branham explains
[23:09] it that's the logos which went out of
[23:12] god in the beginning
[23:15] so that that was the common
[23:18] understanding origin
[23:19] developed the philosopher developed
[23:22] a thought that changed that from
[23:26] being a time where the sun began just
[23:28] prior to creation
[23:30] to having an eternal
[23:34] son
[23:36] so then you fast forward 100 years just
[23:39] about a hundred years later
[23:42] and there is a division
[23:46] in the church the next 50 to 100 years
[23:48] there's division
[23:49] and there's two different viewpoints
[23:51] going on i'm sorry i'm giving you a
[23:53] history lesson but
[23:54] hopefully hopefully it's a blessing
[23:57] there's two different ideas and that one
[23:59] is called the aryan
[24:01] viewpoint of the godhead and one is
[24:06] futuristically called the trinitarian
[24:09] viewpoint you could say it it's an
[24:11] argument
[24:13] over
[24:14] one letter
[24:16] one letter it's the word
[24:19] the letter i
[24:21] the
[24:22] the trinitarian viewpoint said
[24:25] the son is of the same substance
[24:28] as the father homo usias
[24:31] the aryan viewpoint was
[24:33] the son is of a different substance he's
[24:36] cr he's a created
[24:37] being again both of this is a false
[24:39] dichotomy both of them
[24:42] have a wrong understanding but these are
[24:44] the two
[24:45] major understandings that led to the
[24:48] council of nicaea so these two sides are
[24:51] warring against each other so at the
[24:53] council of nicaea you know that santa
[24:55] claus punched
[24:57] somebody in the face at the council
[24:59] [Music]
[25:00] so arius who is the main defender of
[25:03] this
[25:04] they're not this that
[25:05] the sun had a beginning let's put it
[25:07] that way because the the person that
[25:09] wins the victory writes the history
[25:12] right
[25:13] so the trinitarians won the victory they
[25:15] write the history so i don't believe
[25:17] that arius actually
[25:19] held to the viewpoint that the
[25:20] trinitarians said he held to i
[25:24] i strongly believe he held to the
[25:26] earlier viewpoint
[25:29] which tertullian irenaeus
[25:31] all these men that there was two stages
[25:34] of the logos first it's in god
[25:37] as a thought then it comes out of god as
[25:39] a word expressed
[25:41] two stages it's not eternal there's a
[25:43] birth process there it's eternal in god
[25:46] but then it comes forth an expression
[25:49] at a time just before creation
[25:52] so
[25:53] i think that's the viewpoint that arius
[25:56] held to so
[25:58] saint nicholas
[25:59] saint nicholas
[26:01] was a mem was a part of the trinitarian
[26:04] faction at the nicene council
[26:07] so arius got up
[26:08] gave his viewpoint
[26:10] and
[26:11] santa claus came up and punched him in
[26:13] the face
[26:14] for real that's not that's not a joke
[26:17] that's not fake fake news
[26:19] it's a true story
[26:21] and he was he was actually rebuked by
[26:24] constantine
[26:25] for his bad behavior
[26:29] so
[26:30] again this is
[26:32] a political thing the council of nicaea
[26:35] it wasn't a holy ghost anointed
[26:39] event it was
[26:42] the the emperor says i have a division
[26:45] there's christianity is going like
[26:47] wildfire through my empire their empire
[26:50] is getting weakened lots of political
[26:52] intrigue going on emperor's getting
[26:54] assassinated
[26:56] constantine moving his
[26:58] capital
[26:59] now having a
[27:00] two different capitals
[27:04] one in one in what we call turkey and
[27:05] one what in rome
[27:07] italy
[27:09] and all this is taking place so near his
[27:12] uh his winter capital
[27:15] uh in constantinople
[27:18] he has a a council in the city of nicaea
[27:22] it's just if you take it by a car i've
[27:24] driven by it it's
[27:26] it's a now defunct city in icia but it's
[27:28] about
[27:29] an hour car ride from istanbul which was
[27:32] constantinople
[27:35] so
[27:36] this they hold this council because the
[27:38] emperor says
[27:41] not only are we having political
[27:43] divisions military divisions now we have
[27:46] religious divisions and this is going to
[27:49] pull my
[27:50] empire apart
[27:52] so in order to solve this problem what
[27:54] does he do he calls
[27:56] a church council and gets two factions
[27:58] together
[27:59] to speak about what what what is the
[28:02] right doctrine
[28:04] it's a political affair
[28:06] it's not there's there's no one that can
[28:08] say oh my goodness this is how the holy
[28:11] spirit led the church
[28:13] it's all about
[28:15] politics political connections
[28:17] and i've run out of time so let's stand
[28:20] we'll continue this at the end of the
[28:22] month i'll be go i'll be leaving this
