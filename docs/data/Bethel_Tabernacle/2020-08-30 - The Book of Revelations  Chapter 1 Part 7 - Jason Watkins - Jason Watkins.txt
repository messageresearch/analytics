TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] hey man good morning god bless you all greet you in the name of the lord we want to get right into our lesson this morning amen i'm going to need somebody to speed that clock up because it is way slow but um i know it's time for me to get rolling here so we're continuing uh in our series on the book of revelation we want to go through it um verse by verse however we announced last time that we're not going to do as exhaustive a breakdown as we had been doing we are going to save that exhaustive breakdown for podcasts that we're gearing up for now and i've actually already been covering the material on the daily uh bible study call-in that i'm a part of amen been teaching it there for some number of months now so we've got good material laid out we're going to start covering that in our new podcast we'll be making announcements about that soon enough so we're going to um take more of a overview but we still want to look at it verse by verse just not spend a great deal of time on each verse and then you'll still be able to get uh the the the full teaching of it with the podcast show all right so the revelation i just want to look at these verses as we go down them so we have they started out with the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass now what i'm going to do today is i'm going to just go over verses 1 2 three four five six seven and eight and i think if i can get to eight um then we will have a that'll be within our time limits for today and you'll understand better uh how i'm doing this so if you if you hear me repeating some things that are in previous lessons it's only because that midstream i'm adopting a new way of going about it so i just want to make sure we all stay caught up and on the same page so we found that in our very first verse the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john we found here a number of things in our previous studies how that jesus christ which pre jesus christ predated the the man born of mary he was the logos as john said he was with god in fact was god all things were made by jesus christ according to john's gospel and according to matthew's epistle to the ephesian church there's not anything that was made that was not made by god in christ in the form of the logos the pillar of fire so we realized then that that pillar of fire came down and anointed an earthly man born of a woman but virgin born by the spoken word of god so that he could be a tabernacle for god to dwell in and god plainly says that this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell in and so he goes forth and he has a wonderful ministry but we realize by the teaching of the scripture that jesus did not complete uh all of the things to be completed by christ and being god and flesh he he completed the part of purchasing at calvary but we realized that when he left the earth he left a measure of suffering for his bride he left a further fulfillment for his bride and this is what revelation chapter 1 verse 1 is referring to that this is a revelation of jesus christ in other words it is the ministry of christ now in the church because he's about to address a letter to seven churches john is going to turn and see him standing in the midst of seven lamp stands or seven golden candle sticks and we find that you have all of the imagery around you have the the seven lamp stands you have seven stars you have seven spirits seven lamp stands before the throne seven eyes seven horns all of these various uh points of imagery and they all reflect the work of that same jesus that created the world that same jesus that worked through the old testament prophets that same jesus that lived in the nazarene that and he was completely god he was the god-man and then uh we find that he being a prototype of a of a new kingdom of a coming kingdom that once again his life the life of christ would live in a again in a body of flesh in the world and so this is what the book of revelation is given for for the church to understand her position in context to what in in in position to according to what jesus lived on earth he's now living that in his bride he sent and signified it by his angel these are things that must shortly come to pass so shortly he's going to live out through seven ages at the end time he's going to bring forth an angel he's a signifying angel that is going to show john the day of the lord and is going to explain to john and walk with john through a two-year vision unrolling vision and how that you're going to find that god is going to bookend the first age and the last age with prophet messengers all right and then verse 2 carries right in with the same theme speaking of john who bear record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ so john representing the bride in her life is going to bear a testimony and what's that testimony going to be it's going to be a record of the life of god not just the historical record of his ministry in the gospels but his continuing work the bride with christ living in her is going to go through seven ages and she's going to be a living testimony her life is going to bear record of jesus christ and of the things that he saw so the things that he saw he's seeing future events he's called up to the lord's day blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy verse 3 and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand this is an interesting word blessed we find that that it one of the things that it does not mean is it does not mean fortunate that's a that's a shallow rendering of this word blessed that you you'll find that when the angel came to mary and he said unto her blessed art thou among women uh jesus said to peter blessed art thou simon because simon was able to identify the word simon caught a revelation even prior to his full conversion he was believing on christ but the holy ghost hadn't yet been given but yet he had a gene of god that could recognize who jesus was when the rest of the theological world had a misunderstanding of who he was as it was then so is it today and so this term blessed we realize it means that those people who are able to receive the revelation of their hour blessed are you for your eyes see and your ears hear blessed art thou mary above other women why because mary was able to say amen to every word of god mary was able to say be it unto me she heard a prophecy that sounded impossible and by every by every measurable metric was impossible there's nothing in nature nothing in science nothing to suggest that a human being can be born can be born by a complete virgin conception where there is neither male seed provided nor the female egg provided the only thing god needed was a was an incubation place and that was in the body of a woman because a woman calls the fall in genesis she's going to be given the grand privilege to restore it back you are the bride of jesus christ we are receiving the word he's indicating that the people who are going to catch the revelation of jesus christ from verse 1 who are going to be a living testimony of that record in verse 2 are blessed of god because you have an ability you have an ability to hear the word see it hear it recognize it and act upon it because your whole life becomes an amen to every word verse 4 john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne a very in-depth verse here so you're going to notice that he's not writing to the church in jerusalem these are churches in asia so these are this is indicative of the fact that the gospel is going to go into all the world and jesus said when it goes into all the world it's going to pick up a gentile family and go around the world through seven continuous and contiguous and overlapping ages and it's going to find god's bride in every corner of the world in every age that she lives in and so we realize then that from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne we realize that it's a capital s spirits it's not it's so it's speaking definitely of god but it's not saying that god is seven persons it's not that there's seven holy spirits and so you realize then that it's god in a form it's god unveiling himself in seven messengers he called them seven stars and he told john the interpretation of the stars in his right hand and the seven lamp stands and so it becomes very clear to us that he's going to manifest himself through seven ages by seven messengers that are going to gather seven ages of people and it's from him which was and is and is to come so in every age the true church is going to be identified because as christ she will be the same yesterday and forever the bride is always the bride the holy ghost produces a bride of christ in every age limited understanding as she had she was always the image of god in the earth and you could identify her in each age because she displayed the characteristics in all seven ages the seven spirits of god god moving seven times through seven messengers through seven ages to catch seven groups of people through two thousand years and jesus christ was the same yesterday today and in future days to come verse 5 and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood now you'll find here in verse 5 it calls him a faithful witness the only time in the bible you have these two terms put together faithful witness the next time you see it here you're seeing it in the first age now you don't see it again until the last stage revelation chapter 3 picks it up in the laodicean age that now he's called you're going to notice the faithful and there's a new word and true witness because we realize that the last aids bride is going to be a demonstration that every movement he made in all seven ages is true and so the the faithful witness is now the faithful and true witness because in seven ages the seven spirits of god have taken the revelation of jesus christ to the church and she's become the living embodiment of the word and she's at the end time she's a faithful and true witness now you find that that goes along exactly again she's called that again in chapter 17 because the bible speaks of her and i don't have time to turn to with all these scriptures this morning but if you go into chapter 17 you'll find that the bride of jesus christ ends up at the end time faithful now that corresponds perfectly to revelation one and five revelation 3 14 it picks up again in chapter 17 and then when you've and then when you find it comes again the next time it's in revelation 19 because now he christ rides out on the white horse and he's called the word of god and he's and he he has earned the title faithful and true and so we realize now that he let let's let's i'm gonna i'm gonna turn to that one real quick because i wanna i don't wanna i don't wanna miss this all right i might catch 17. um no we don't we're not going to have time i'm not because i'd have to read too much of it but we look at 19 and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and honor and power unto the lord god we come down to verse 11 and i saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat on him was called faithful and true all right now he's called a faithful witness in chapter one he's called faithful and true witness in chapter three in chapter 17 we find the exact same language referring to his bride that she's also faithful she's a faithful witness but you notice here this is why that jesus there's two things you're seeing in chapter 19 first that that he that he doesn't have the word witness it just simply says faithful and true because the time of him needing a witness in the earth is over the bride's already been taken she's already been raptured and when he comes out the the people of the earth wail because of him because they can see they thought they were in his family they realized they're not when they see his family following him on white horses and he's he's he he's not a witness anymore because the time of the witness is over he the bible just simply says he's called faithful and true and look at all of these badges and medals and ribbons of honor he's called faithful and true and the bible goes on down and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his his name is called the word of god the armies of heaven follow him out of his mouth go with the sharp sword verse 16 and he had on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords you know something that's amazing that you can go and you can there's clips of it today where you have men who never served in the military never picked up a gun never fired a shot never got shot at were never in the military and they will dress up in military garments and put on a big salad bowl right over here of ribbons and metals and they'll have insignias and badges and eagles and lightning strikes and everything and they go in public impersonating men of honor and they never served like that but they want that notoriety and it works fine to the unknowing public until a real military man sees him and a real military man knows there's something not right about this guy and he starts to question him where were you stationed when was this what was the name what did you have what unit where and because the guy immediately can't answer all those questions they denounce him and expose him as a fraud because why is he a fraud because he's wearing insignias he hasn't earned he's wearing a uniform and medals and ribbons and names and titles he hasn't earned but in revelation 19 jesus can wear all of these insignias he can wear the mighty god he can wear the faithful and true he can wear a king of kings and lord of lords he can wear why can he wear it because in chapter 17 a bride was found faithful and he said she would in chapter one he proved it in chapter three he solidified it in chapter 17 and when he comes writing out in verse in chapter 19 friends i'm here to tell you you're looking at one worthy to wear these titles and insignias amen so then all right let's keep moving we're going to we're going to run out of time here i'm just trying to go as quick as i can so then we come back verse verse six and hath made us kings i love this see he finishes that in verse five he's the first begotten of the dead the prince of the kings of the earth and uh and unto him that loved us and washes from our sins in his own blood verse six and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever now you realize that uh there's two things here a king and a priest this is what he's making his family into how's he doing it by the revelation of verse one because the bride is seen in verse two and she's living out a witness and she's blessed because she can say amen to every word in verse three and john is literally writing to her and seven spirits are gonna be sent to her and we come to jesus christ who produces who is a faithful witness he produces a people who are faithful and true witness and in verse 6 he literally makes us kings kings mean dominion kings mean that you have power you have authority over the flesh over the devil over sin and over the world now sometimes we don't always feel like we have say man if i got all this authority i don't i sometimes brother i'm being honest brother jason i don't always feel like that i've got that authority and if i do i don't always get to exercise it well let me tell you the good news is you're also a priest and the thing about a priest is he has access to god and so how do you get your kingly authority how do you get that to work how do you become an overcomer because you're also a priest by the holy ghost and that gives you direct access to god who you can approach who can empower you because the bible teaches us he's the same yesterday and today and forever from him which was and which is and which is to come and behold verse 7 he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all the kindreds of the earth shall wail not rejoice you go into denominational churches today and if they're preaching on the rapture of the church you're going to get the escalator version you're not going to get the true version you're going to get the escalator version what i call the escalator version where they believe that the rapture of god's family is someday gabriel is going to step out on a cloud blow a golden trumpet a great celestial you know ethereal escalator is going to drop down from heaven jesus is going to come down like donald trump and tell the whole world you're saved and we're all going home and he's going to take everybody home that's that's an escalator version that's a modern interpretation that's not true that's not going to happen the bible says that when they see him coming in revelation 19 which is what this is referring to they will wail because of him it won't be a happy appearing because they they thought they were the family of god up until the moment they realize they're not because the family of god is following the lord on white horses and so he cometh with clouds this is not first if you take first thessalonians 4 16 down through first thessalonians 5 chapter chapter 5 verse 2 you'll find that jesus when he comes in a shout voice in a trumpet in verse 2 of chapter 5 he refers to it as a thief in the night now that's exactly what jesus said referring to a thief cometh in the night all right so we find that the this is not verse 7 is not the rapture of the church because the rapture of the church is recorded as a thief in the night in 1st thessalonians 5 2. this is one that every eye sees him this is revelation 19 where we read a few minutes ago and they that and they which pierced him now you've got a double meaning natural and spiritual because the 144 000 are going to recognize him that's what zechariah 12 deals with zechariah 12 and 13 that they shall look upon him whom they pierced and they shall even ask him where did you get these scars and he's going to say in the house of my friends and the bible says that the house of david will separate husbands from wives in the house of levi in the house of shimaya and all of these various places and they're going to lament and mourn like someone who's lost a firstborn child and so we realized that they were going to realize they pierced him but his message is going to be to them like joseph back in genesis he's going to say listen my brethren god did that don't be angry with yourselves somebody had to slaughter the lamb god blinded you you were his family you were the ones who could take it and he knew it so he blinded you allowed you to kill the lamb because somebody had to kill the lamb i had to be sacrificed and so joseph's message is be happy rejoice eat your food you're my brethren i'm going to take care of you from here on oh friends what a day paul said if the casting away of them be glorious how much more shall oh in that day when those jews are reunited back to christ what a day that's going to be but also in the spiritual side the people wail not only the jews because of a of a literal crucifixion but the but the gentiles because of a spiritual crucifixion and a prophet that seventh spirit that angel that seventh star with the seven spirit of christ upon him said and stood in this day and said i indict this generation for the second crucifixion of christ and i do so in the presence of the judge and so the whole world is weeping and wailing because they will see him who they pierced and he says in verse 8 finally i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord here it is which is and which was and which is to come the almighty understand this friends that from the first church age to the last church age he's been almighty from where we are now unto a body change i will promise you you can count on several things he'll be like he always was if that's how he'll be and that's how he will be the same yesterday today and forever how he was then is how he'll be now and how you can count on him to be tomorrow in whatever you're facing trying to get home say how am i going to do it because the same one that is that that is and was and which is to come is the almighty and there's no power that can keep you out of it once the almighty has inducted you into his family praise the lord i made it brother luther i got all the way through eight verses god bless your friends you i think you'll get some idea of the pace we're going to use now we're going to go verse by verse but we're just not going to comment exhaustively so that's your preaching teaching lesson today god bless you sister welcome god bless you happy to have you today i understand we're getting some singing out of you guys so uh yeah no no no maybe it's definite for sure amen so god bless y'all streaming at home driving
