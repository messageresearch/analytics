[26:21] lord i found out they can't leave it on
[26:23] i told them they should leave it on all
[26:24] the time but they said they can't do
[26:25] that because it creates a loops of some
[26:27] kind so
[26:29] amen over my head but anyway those
[26:31] brothers seem to have it all together
[26:32] but we're happy to be here tonight happy
[26:35] to have you all in the house of god amen
[26:38] we're gonna go right to the scripture
[26:39] we're really on a tight schedule tonight
[26:41] and i gotta
[26:43] i gotta set the
[26:44] set the standard
[26:46] amen i've put these other brothers under
[26:48] a strict guideline and
[26:50] and so uh i kind of didn't put myself
[26:53] under one but
[26:55] but uh anyway i i kind of did kind of
[26:57] didn't kind of did left it left it and
[27:00] left me a little bit of wiggle room but
[27:02] i would like to move right along uh
[27:05] we're going to have the order the way
[27:06] we're going to do it is i'm going to
[27:08] take this opening segment
[27:11] um and i added a few minutes to my to my
[27:14] part
[27:15] but then we're going to go straight to
[27:16] the communion now that's a little
[27:18] different for us we're going to go i'm
[27:19] going to preach that list a little bit
[27:21] we're going to go straight to the
[27:22] communion and then immediately after the
[27:24] communion service we're going to hear
[27:25] from our other brothers and then when
[27:28] they go through their portions then we
[27:31] will dismiss for the foot washing for
[27:32] those who can stay it'll be starting to
[27:34] get a little late by then but we're
[27:36] trying not to get you out very late at
[27:37] all i'm aiming i'm aiming at 9 30 we'll
[27:40] see how that how close to that we can
[27:42] get but uh that wouldn't be too bad if
[27:44] we slip out and did foot washing and
[27:46] then come back in just for a dismissal
[27:48] prayer
[27:49] amen does that sound all right praise
[27:51] the lord so god bless you first
[27:53] thessalonians chapter 1
[27:57] amen praise the lord
[27:59] get to use my new bible for the first
[28:01] time
[28:02] and uh
[28:03] i love it my it's uh i never had a
[28:06] spurgeon bible with his annotations and
[28:08] notes and outlines never had that before
[28:11] so i really appreciate that
[28:14] i was
[28:15] going to
[28:16] start there at verse 1 but i tell you
[28:18] what
[28:19] brother caleb let's just drop down and
[28:21] read verse 5
[28:24] for our gospel came not unto you in word
[28:28] only
[28:29] but also in power
[28:31] and in the holy ghost
[28:33] and in much assurance that's a lot isn't
[28:35] it look at it again didn't come in word
[28:38] only but here's what came with the word
[28:40] power
[28:41] and in the holy ghost and in much
[28:44] assurance
[28:46] as you know what manner of men we were
[28:48] among you
[28:50] for your sake
[28:52] father we thank you for your word
[28:54] tonight i ask now that you bless it
[28:57] mightily lord let it go to all peoples
[29:00] now as we have definitely
[29:03] a feeling on our heart to go in this
[29:05] direction and been thinking on it lord
[29:07] for weeks now coming to just a little
[29:10] short time in your word as we lord the
[29:12] word prepares our hearts so we wouldn't
[29:14] want to just jump straight into
[29:17] uh the communion we want to have at
[29:18] least a little bit of the word lord to
[29:21] uh to add on to what the worship service
[29:24] has been able to accomplish and have
[29:26] hearts and minds
[29:28] prepared to receive your supper we
[29:30] commit it to you in jesus name god bless
[29:32] you friends you can be seated
[29:42] one of the things that i had said to the
[29:44] brothers they were just looking you know
[29:46] wondering what um i had on my heart on
[29:49] my mind as far as
[29:51] you know
[29:53] kind of a list a little bit of a pointer
[29:54] for them tonight
[29:56] what out what kind of was the vision of
[29:58] my heart and i i just i just said to
[30:01] them brothers whatever is on your heart
[30:03] that the lord would impress amen you
[30:05] know you might reflect a little bit
[30:07] about the the year that's passed and
[30:09] correlate that to the year coming you
[30:12] know i i thought to myself that if i
[30:14] were to do that tonight i don't want to
[30:16] really spend much time uh thinking about
[30:20] this past year other than to say i'm
[30:22] grateful to god amen to be here tonight
[30:25] with you i'm grateful to god for what
[30:27] he's done in our lives friends i'm so
[30:30] thankful to the lord and i'm glad uh for
[30:33] what we were able to accomplish
[30:36] uh the word went forth amen
[30:39] people were healed sick people were
[30:41] healed lost people found christ many
[30:44] have
[30:45] found a deeper experience with the lord
[30:47] in their lives i've spent this whole
[30:49] year hearing testimony after testimony
[30:52] of the great things that god did i i
[30:54] trust that our our young people are
[30:56] still
[30:57] reveling in the meetings that we held
[31:00] amen as this year goes out and the
[31:02] things that god did for you at that time
[31:04] don't forget it don't let it don't let
[31:06] it just pass by uh absorb what god did
[31:09] for you during that time
[31:12] you know i
[31:13] one of the last thing that i thought
[31:15] that i might say
[31:16] concerning this past year
[31:19] jesus made this statement
[31:21] how that he says
[31:23] when ye shall have done
[31:25] all those things which are commanded you
[31:28] say here's what you say
[31:31] you don't say i'm going to disney world
[31:34] like the world does they get some big
[31:37] accomplishment i'm going to disney world
[31:39] you know
[31:40] we're not here to to brag about our
[31:43] accomplishments jesus said it's a little
[31:45] hot whoever's on the mic for me that's a
[31:47] little hot at least up here it is anyway
[31:49] so likewise ye when ye shall have done
[31:53] all those things which are commanded you
[31:55] say
[31:56] we are unprofitable servants
[31:59] we have done that which was our duty to
[32:02] do
[32:04] i just think that that's a perfect
[32:06] um attitude adjustment amen if if you
[32:10] know we're coming to a communion service
[32:12] and i'm just thinking lord what what
[32:15] could i ponder what could i put my mind
[32:17] on that would give me the kind of
[32:19] humility and the kind of sincerity that
[32:22] i need and i think luke 17 10 is a very
[32:25] good place to start when we've done all
[32:27] that we all that we have been asked to
[32:29] do everything that god asked you to do
[32:32] in 2022 now i'm not going to ask you for
[32:34] a show of hands and i hope you don't ask
[32:36] me
[32:37] i'm not going to ask for a show of hands
[32:38] for everybody that did everything god
[32:40] asked them to do in 2022
[32:42] please don't ask me and i won't ask you
[32:45] don't ask don't tell okay
[32:48] all right but that's a bad analogy
[32:51] [Laughter]
[32:53] but i i think i'm thankful to god that i
[32:57] can stand here today and say lord you
[32:59] know i i
[33:01] you asked me to do things i didn't get
[33:02] them all done but even if i had i want
[33:05] to have the kind of humility that stands
[33:07] in your presence tonight and say lord i
[33:09] owe you everything
[33:11] i got nothing coming i only did what was
[33:14] my duty and i'm not even sure i did a
[33:17] great job on that but but i know this he
[33:20] did a great job i know this that
[33:23] the bible says let the weak we all feel
[33:25] weak at times let the weak say i'm
[33:28] strong
[33:29] what you ought to say is i i can do all
[33:32] things through christ who strengthens me
[33:35] that's what i want to take into 2022
[33:38] that's what i want to take into the new
[33:40] year to say i
[33:42] i'm not going to base it on my 2021
[33:44] record because if i based it on that i
[33:47] probably come up short again but i'm
[33:49] going to say no i'm going to let that go
[33:52] i'm going to count it to the lord i'm
[33:54] going to ask for his mercy and i'm going
[33:56] to press into the new year with a new
[33:58] vigor and a new zeal and say lord i want
[34:00] to i want to hit every mark
[34:03] i want to check every box that you ask
[34:06] of me in this year and he's asking quite
[34:08] a bit
[34:10] because we're in a day and we're in an
[34:12] hour friends very serious brother
[34:14] branham makes a number of statements and
[34:16] i'm going to read through a bunch of
[34:18] quotes here very quickly i would have
[34:19] put them on the screen but it would have
[34:21] slowed me down
[34:22] brother madam talks about when he was in
[34:24] in india the methodist bishop and many
[34:26] of them come over to meet me said
[34:28] brother branham we heard these things we
[34:30] preached the word we know more about
[34:32] theology perhaps and all the americans
[34:33] put together and because the bible is an
[34:36] eastern book and i said and that's right
[34:37] i said but we want to see someone
[34:40] anointed with the holy spirit and here
[34:43] it is that can make it live again
[34:46] that's that's the theme of what i want
[34:48] to say to you tonight going into 2022 i
[34:52] want to see the word live again see
[34:55] somebody that can make it live again
[34:58] that's it we want somebody who can
[35:00] produce what the bible says it will do
[35:02] otherwise we want to see the faith in
[35:04] other words he's saying we want to see
[35:06] the faith that was once delivered to the
[35:09] saints now if you're wondering what kind
[35:11] of church they had in the days of the
[35:13] apostles they made the word live
[35:16] how many want that
[35:18] so now i'm i'm wanting to go forward but
[35:21] i'm wanting uh uh i'm wanting a rerun of
[35:24] that a very early day in the day ahead
[35:26] of us i'm looking out at it ahead of us
[35:28] and i say lord let this be the most
[35:30] apostolic year that bethel tabernacle
[35:33] has ever enjoyed to see the power of god
[35:36] moving to see people's lives being
[35:39] changed
[35:42] you don't realize friends what an
[35:44] impossibility that is in the day and
[35:46] hour that we live in
[35:48] he goes on he says here in 1955 here in
[35:51] 63 the world falling apart we've already
[35:53] got it god god gave it to us it's his
[35:56] promise for this hour we look in the
[35:57] bible we see it everywhere through the
[35:59] bible anointed ones come
[36:01] anointed ones come on and made that word
[36:03] live again right in the hour for that
[36:05] hour we've got messiah this is him he
[36:08] holds up his bible this is him the word
[36:11] in the beginning was the word it was
[36:12] with god was god and the and it remains
[36:15] god hebrews 13 8 same yesterday day and
[36:17] forever we know what's supposed to take
[36:19] place in this day we're wanting a
[36:21] messiah and god gave us the messiah his
[36:24] promised word for this day
[36:26] don't undervalue the promised word

[36:45] in his revealed word you're not waiting
[36:48] to see messiah he's already among us

[37:25] that's my vision for 2022 friends
[37:30] he says
[37:32] somebody to anoint it and make it live
[37:34] again yes sir it's a real messiah it's
[37:36] the word of god both heavens and earth
[37:38] will pass away my words are never passed
[37:40] away he goes on there in 63 there's a
[37:42] manner that can turn on the light
[37:43] sometimes
[37:44] the grain lays in the earth dormant all
[37:46] through the winter like winter
[37:48] wheat sowed in the ground but when that
[37:50] sun gets just right oh it's to live see
[37:53] and it can't live without the sun and
[37:55] god has made promises for every age and
[37:58] every day and when the light gets right
[38:01] and shines upon that it'll produce now
[38:05] listen it's not i'm not here saying you
[38:07] got to go produce it the word in you has
[38:11] the power to produce itself that's what
[38:13] brother branham taught us it you you
[38:15] have you have that which is everything
[38:18] you have needed for a rapture is in you
[38:20] now all it's got to be brought is into
[38:22] the presence and the atmosphere of
[38:25] messiah
[38:26] and it'll it'll bring that winter it
[38:28] might have been dormant it might have
[38:30] been winter but i'm here to tell you the
[38:32] sun is just in the right position it's
[38:34] going home time and you should have an
[38:36] expectation that your life can match the
[38:40] promise of this hour if you're a
[38:41] believer
[38:43] because you've got the seed of the seed
[38:44] of god in you you've got the word for
[38:46] this hour we've got the time met
[38:48] prophecy what's to hinder us friends
[38:51] see we let the devil sometimes uh get us
[38:54] in this mindset that oh nothing's
[38:56] changing nothing's happening there's
[38:58] plenty happening
[38:59] and there's opportunity glory i want to
[39:01] really emphasize that tonight there is
[39:04] opportunity aplenty for god to move in
[39:07] your life
[39:09] and god made a promise for every age and
[39:11] every day and when the light gets right
[39:13] and shines upon it it'll produce just
[39:14] exactly what the word said because he is
[39:17] the light and the life so so
[39:20] i would ask you a question tonight what
[39:22] are you looking for
[39:24] what are you looking for are you looking
[39:26] for a new year to just be like the old
[39:28] one i don't want it to be like the old
[39:30] one say well a lot of good things happen
[39:32] i didn't go in the rapture
[39:36] i wouldn't mind a repeat of all the good
[39:37] things i wouldn't mind avoiding all the
[39:39] bad things but i didn't get to go on the
[39:40] rapture i'd like to go in the rapture
[39:42] i like for 2022 to be the best year of
[39:45] the bride's life
[39:47] hallelujah the best year in history
[39:50] he says in looking unto jesus 64 the
[39:52] mechanics don't run the church it's the
[39:54] dynamics the holy ghost that gets into
[39:56] the into this word see that's that's
[39:59] dynamics when the holy ghost gets into
[40:01] the word all right
[40:03] it's not a seminary that teaches you
[40:05] theology and greek interpretations but
[40:06] it's the dynamics of the holy ghost in
[40:08] there to set that a fire and to bring it
[40:11] to pass and to make it to make it to
[40:14] make it live just exactly what the
[40:17] promised word for this hour not the
[40:19] mechanics the dynamics it takes
[40:21] mechanics and dynamics the word and the
[40:24] spirit they are the one that gives life
[40:29] he says later in paradox
[40:31] now what is it christ coming to his
[40:33] bride
[40:34] christ is the word we all know the
[40:36] anointing is christ that comes on the
[40:38] word that makes the word live is that
[40:40] right congregation says
[40:42] amen
[40:43] that is the anointing christ is the
[40:46] anointing the spirit that comes upon the
[40:48] word that quickens the word to make it
[40:50] live now
[40:51] the word is in your heart you believe in
[40:54] divine healing whatever more we we we do
[40:58] we do
[40:59] we do believe in those things we do
[41:01] believe in divine healing we do believe
[41:03] in the power of god we do believe in the
[41:05] anointing of the holy ghost i believe in
[41:08] that stuff
[41:10] hallelujah he says in the oddball how
[41:12] many feel like an oddball to this world
[41:15] you can lay a seed out there on the
[41:16] ground no matter how much the seed is
[41:18] germatized and lay it there it's got to
[41:20] have an atmosphere to make it live now
[41:22] watch listen now we're turning now we're
[41:24] going to the next step
[41:25] so it's not just the season it's not
[41:27] just the sunlight but watch it could be
[41:29] dramatized but what's it got to have an
[41:31] atmosphere the sun has to come to a
[41:34] certain power before bring it to a
[41:36] certain atmosphere an egg has to have an
[41:39] atmosphere or it won't hatch no matter
[41:41] how fertile it is
[41:42] it's got to have an atmosphere
[41:46] now this is what i have proven to be
[41:49] true
[41:50] i can testify to you tonight friends
[41:52] that that when you don't keep that that
[41:55] seed gene of god not only the seed gene
[41:59] of god down in you but the seed of the
[42:02] word should be a constant
[42:05] there should be a constant intake of the
[42:07] word of god there should be a constant
[42:09] intake of the presence of god there
[42:11] should be a constant communion between
[42:14] you and the son see the son of god but
[42:18] when we don't keep that atmosphere of
[42:19] the holy ghost and we don't keep feeding
[42:21] on the word then i'm here to tell you
[42:23] something friends you live an
[42:25] underachiever's life
[42:27] you remember i said that i promise you
[42:30] that if you don't increase your intake
[42:32] of the word of god and if you don't
[42:34] increase your fellowship with the lord
[42:36] in prayer and fellowship and the
[42:37] assembling of the saints and the
[42:38] fellowship of the saints and you don't
[42:40] and you don't have more of that then you
[42:42] know what you do you're you're gonna you
[42:45] and you you say 2021 if i'd be honest i
[42:48] feel like an underachiever you'll just
[42:50] repeat it
[42:51] you'll just repeat it i'm gonna tell you
[42:52] something i made up my mind years ago i
[42:55] was done with being an underachiever i
[42:57] want to i want to excel i want to
[43:00] achieve everything that god has for me
[43:04] at the beginning of 22 i want a purpose
[43:06] to give my mind
[43:09] more to the word of god and the things
[43:11] of god and take advantage of the
[43:14] anointing that was prophesied for this
[43:16] hour
[43:18] see and so
[43:20] so you know
[43:22] the truth of the matter is friends
[43:25] i i can't make it happen for me
[43:27] you can't make it happen for you
[43:30] a prophet is here telling you god is
[43:33] already here to make it happen
[43:36] all i can do all you can do is slip into
[43:39] the stream of prophecy and allow your
[43:42] life to be to be molded to have more of
[43:46] the word of god more of the fellowship
[43:49] of god more of the anointing more of the
[43:51] spirit of god that's how you're going to
[43:54] be an overcomer in 2022 if you slip into
[43:57] the stream of it friends i promise you
[43:59] it'll carry you along
[44:01] you'll find yourself if if the lord
[44:03] tarries another year i hope he doesn't
[44:05] but if he does you'll find yourself at
[44:07] the end of 2022 saying brother jason
[44:10] this was a better year for me than 2021.
[44:13] you might make less money you might get
[44:15] sick more but you'll still say this was
[44:17] a better year for me than 2021 because i
[44:21] stopped being an underachiever and i
[44:23] started focusing my life and taking
[44:26] advantage of the opportunity that god
[44:29] has given us in this hour
[44:31] see when you do that friends when you
[44:33] step into the stream of the promise with
[44:36] your heart and your mind prepared then
[44:39] god is obligated to make all things
[44:42] possible to you
[44:44] you believe that
[44:45] let's say it again that's a big point
[44:47] when you're willing to slip into the
[44:48] stream and let and let all of these
[44:51] things come together
[44:52] let the the sunlight is in the right
[44:54] spot the word is here the people are
[44:56] here christ is here messiah is here and
[44:58] all you've got to do is slip into that
[45:00] stream and god will be obligated god
[45:03] will be obligated to make all things
[45:05] possible for you
[45:09] he says and i think in a group like this
[45:11] christians hatch out or are born again
[45:13] in such an atmosphere as this this is
[45:15] the kind of atmosphere i was born under
[45:17] no matter where i go in the world the
[45:19] cold world the mission fields and so
[45:20] forth i can even stand and close my eyes
[45:22] and think of this atmosphere and god's
[45:25] provided place of worship going fast
[45:27] and i think that's what's the matter
[45:29] with the church today we're lacking that
[45:31] dynamical power
[45:33] watch now to press this word and make it
[45:37] live for this day so there's a there's
[45:39] this notion of you pressing this notion
[45:43] of you getting on board this notion you
[45:45] can't make it happen but you can be a
[45:47] participant in it and that's how exactly
[45:50] god has always desired to do it
[45:53] in with and through in you all through
[45:56] you all above you all amen so that so
[45:58] that god is all in all i'm here to tell
[46:02] you you're in that all right
[46:04] you're in you're part of that or you're
[46:06] in there with jesus and god is wanting
[46:09] to make his life come forward in all
[46:13] he says
[46:14] god's provided place of worship he
[46:15] carries on martin luther had the
[46:17] mechanics and dynamics of his day john
[46:19] wesley had them of his day pentecost had
[46:22] them of their day what about our day
[46:24] what about it
[46:25] what about our day
[46:27] this isn't luther wesley azuza this
[46:30] isn't the days of brother branham and
[46:32] his tent meetings
[46:33] this isn't the day on on 8th and penn
[46:36] the seals are being preached you're not
[46:38] you're not you're not at parkview junior
[46:39] high and and listening to this day the
[46:42] scripture is fulfilled
[46:44] you're not you're not you're not in
[46:45] phoenix you're not in tucson today
[46:47] you're here
[46:48] you're not in 1963 64 65 you're at the
[46:51] end of 2021 what say you church what
[46:54] about it
[46:55] what about you what about me what about
[46:57] us
[46:58] it can't just be a god of history it's a
[47:00] god of the future
[47:03] hallelujah
[47:05] this is another time what about our day
[47:07] this is another time the church should
[47:09] be full fully grown now
[47:12] ready to go meet with the manifestation
[47:14] of every blessing that he promised in
[47:15] the bible
[47:16] operating in that one great body where
[47:18] he promised that he would meet the
[47:19] people and be worshipped in this great
[47:22] church of his so how so how ready should
[47:25] i be
[47:27] that's a good question
[47:28] how ready should i be ready to meet him
[47:32] that's what he says
[47:33] this church should be fully grown now
[47:37] ready to go meet christ
[47:40] where should you be say brother jason
[47:42] where should i be in my life you should
[47:43] be ready to meet him
[47:46] that's that's like
[47:47] that's like real time
[47:50] you should be ready to meet him in real
[47:52] time
[47:53] not not somewhere over rainbow but right
[47:55] now i'm not here you know i i i i tell
[47:59] you something friends i'm not here like
[48:01] a prophet with a gift of discernment
[48:03] that can discern your heart my wife and
[48:05] i we were coming up the road listening i
[48:06] said i want you to listen to this and i
[48:08] played her just a little clip one of my
[48:09] favorites and brother branham just goes
[48:11] into that discernment with a lady
[48:13] standing there and he breaks from her
[48:14] and breaks out over the audience and
[48:16] she's traveling and he's got them all in
[48:18] the same car and he can see me say i see
[48:19] all y'all and oh yeah lady you and sir
[48:22] you're in the same car you're coming
[48:23] from another country 2 000 miles away oh
[48:26] you come from canada and and she's got a
[48:28] tumor she's got a thyroid he's got a
[48:31] problem he's standing there with another
[48:33] lady who says he says that's your wife
[48:35] no it's not it's actually your sister
[48:37] and and i mean this woman here is is
[48:39] shock and the audience is in shock and
[48:42] disbelief nobody can believe my goodness
[48:44] what is he tied into
[48:46] and then he prays a simple prayer for
[48:48] her and then right as he comes out of
[48:49] his prayer then all of a sudden an
[48:51] urgency hits his voice and he says
[48:53] everybody everybody stand up quick he
[48:55] said the holy spirit's sweeping through
[48:56] the building hurry everybody in
[48:58] wheelchairs blind halt man whatever
[49:00] stand up quickly he's moving all over
[49:02] the building
[49:03] i'm here to tell you something friends
[49:04] oh i i may not be that prophet i'm not
[49:07] here with that kind of discernment but
[49:09] you know uh but the word is
[49:12] say brother jason what do i need in my
[49:14] life will you tell me how about you tell
[49:17] me how about you tell yourself what it
[49:19] you need you you you tell me what's the
[49:21] need in your life and be honest before

[49:28] honest before the lord what is the
[49:29] biggest need in your life i tell you
[49:31] something i'm glad as brother branham
[49:34] says we ought to be a mature we ought to
[49:36] be preparing for the coming ready to
[49:38] meet the lord and i i'm glad that i have
[49:41] sown the seed i was thinking about it
[49:43] today i thought lord i'm glad that i've
[49:45] spent all these years sowing the seed of
[49:47] the word i've sold it in this
[49:48] congregation for years and i'm going to
[49:51] tell you something it's paying off i
[49:52] have a mature assembly i have people who
[49:54] know god who know the power of god who
[49:57] understand the word of god who aren't
[50:00] afraid to believe god for anything
[50:03] to reach out and take miracles
[50:06] oh and bring them in bring them right in
[50:08] among us i tell you friends you're not
[50:09] little children anymore
[50:12] i i don't have to hold your hand
[50:14] constantly thank the lord i told you the
[50:16] other sunday how proud i am of this
[50:18] assembly i meant it i think we have a
[50:20] very spiritually minded assembly you're
[50:23] you're a child of god you've known the
[50:25] lord all of these years and oh you know
[50:28] but but but if i come to you tonight and
[50:31] say well what does it mean to be ready
[50:33] to meet the lord well what if i said to
[50:34] you tonight that that suddenly like
[50:37] brother branham had come over him and he
[50:39] said everybody quickly the holy spirit's
[50:41] moving across the building what if i
[50:43] suddenly stood up here and said to you
[50:45] thus saith the lord it's we got 30
[50:47] minutes left friends here we are we
[50:49] thought we were looking to 2022. guess
[50:51] what we're not going to make it we got
[50:53] 30 minutes
[50:55] we got 30 minutes left
[50:57] from now
[50:59] what would you
[51:00] want to have in place
[51:03] now we're dealing with the question
[51:05] how ready should i be
[51:07] you should be ready to meet the lord
[51:10] well what does that even mean
[51:12] what does that look like
[51:13] how ready should i actually be
[51:16] what if i said you only had 30 minutes
[51:19] and he was going to be here
[51:21] see
[51:22] now i know i got enough sense to know
[51:25] we got things in our life that the lord
[51:26] might put on our heart and say you need
[51:28] to make that right it might happen in
[51:29] this service tonight
[51:31] and i know 30 minutes isn't enough time
[51:33] to sometimes run out and fix everything
[51:34] that if you really thought
[51:37] the lord was really going to be here in
[51:38] 30 minutes
[51:39] no make that 29.5 minutes
[51:43] if i had some magical way to suddenly
[51:45] put an urgency on you to where you
[51:47] became convinced my goodness 29 minutes
[51:51] and some seconds he'll be here
[51:53] what you say oh you know what a lot of
[51:56] things that you think i don't need to go
[51:57] fix you might think different
[52:01] say oh i i'm i'm okay with my level of
[52:04] sincerity 2021 is good enough i don't
[52:06] need to be any more spiritual than that
[52:08] i promise you if i said you had 20 less
[52:11] than 29 minutes now
[52:13] you wouldn't think you had enough
[52:15] sincerity i know i wouldn't i wouldn't
[52:18] think i had enough sincerity and i know
[52:20] we can't run out and and fix everything
[52:22] in 30 minutes or 28 minutes or 29
[52:24] minutes but you know something you could
[52:26] make a commitment in your heart right
[52:27] now
[52:28] that's all the thief on the cross could
[52:30] do
[52:31] he couldn't come down and go fix
[52:32] anything but you know what he could do
[52:33] he couldn't believe christ right at that
[52:34] spot he could have said lord remember me
[52:37] when you come into your kingdom oh my
[52:40] what what about 30 what if it was three
[52:42] what commitment
[52:44] if it was three minutes
[52:47] what kind of commitment would you make
[52:48] in your heart
[52:50] you got the lord's supper the communion
[52:52] table here before you represents the the
[52:55] broken body and the blood of the lord
[52:56] that he shed for us
[52:58] and i'll tell you something friends we
[53:00] need to come to it with a humility but
[53:02] we need to but you need to understand
[53:04] that god doesn't want you in a beat down
[53:06] humility god wants you in a supernatural
[53:09] humility god's not interested in human
[53:11] humility it's not about staring at your
[53:14] feet when you walk and dressing in a
[53:15] potato sack and and speaking softly
[53:18] that's not humility that's not always
[53:20] humility that's religious
[53:22] that's not necessarily spiritual
[53:25] you understand but real humility when
[53:28] when when brother bisical told me one
[53:29] time he said he asked brother branham
[53:31] our brother brandon ask him said brother
[53:33] eddie do you know what real humility is
[53:36] and he said i think i do brother branham
[53:38] he said what would you say it is and he
[53:40] said it's when you can say amen to every
[53:42] word of god
[53:44] i want that kind of humility friends
[53:47] i want that kind of humility oh what if
[53:49] you could hear it coming what if what if
[53:52] what if your senses could actually pick
[53:54] it up brother describes it sometimes i
[53:56] remember one time he described about how
[53:57] that what annoying thing starts coming
[53:58] in he said you know you're he said i'm
[54:00] praying and he said then i start to get
[54:02] a little lifted up and i keep praying
[54:04] and i press a little higher this is a
[54:06] prophet now and he said i i feel myself
[54:08] rising into another atmosphere and he
[54:10] says then i hear him coming
[54:12] and he now i don't understand this don't
[54:14] get me outside nothing to explain it any
[54:16] better because i don't understand any
[54:17] better what i'm about to tell you
[54:18] but he says he says i can hear it
[54:21] starting to roll in and he said it's
[54:22] coming in like one plus one is two two
[54:26] plus two is four
[54:28] and he's giving the idea it's like a
[54:30] it's like it's ramping up
[54:34] and he said and he said and then he said
[54:36] when that happens i just raise up my
[54:37] hands and he said it just sweeps me up
[54:39] into another realm and that's when i see
[54:41] visions and visions break out in front
[54:43] of me
[54:44] oh i'm going to tell you something
[54:45] friends i'm not here to try to duplicate
[54:47] a prophet's life but what if you could
[54:49] what if i said he'll be here in three
[54:50] minutes and suddenly you went i feel it
[54:53] i hear that and suddenly we begin to
[54:54] hear
[54:57] i'm gonna tell you the hair'd stand up
[54:58] on the back of your neck you'd raise up
[55:01] both hands you'd get up on your feet
[55:03] tears would roll down your face it
[55:05] wouldn't be fear it wouldn't be sadness
[55:07] it'd say on the day i've waited on all
[55:10] my life is now coming upon me
[55:13] hallelujah that's the kind of that's the
[55:15] kind of power that god has one of these
[55:18] morning's friends it's gonna sweep us
[55:19] into another realm
[55:21] oh my i wanna i wanna know what it feels
[55:24] like i i wanna have that warm urgency in
[55:27] my heart i wanna i wanna feel god moving
[55:31] in our lives
[55:32] what would be your
[55:34] your last thoughts or your last words
[55:38] as i wind up to a close here
[55:41] what would be
[55:43] your last thoughts or your last words
[55:47] as you felt it rushing in
[55:50] just when you started to feel yourself
[55:52] lifting up into that other dimension
[55:55] oh
[55:57] what a different service we'd have
[55:59] instantly even from right this minute
[56:01] we're sitting here in a nice
[56:03] air-conditioned building we're waiting
[56:04] to take the lord's supper but friends
[56:06] that that reality is just a breath away
[56:10] that reality is just right here it's
[56:12] just in another dimension it's all
[56:14] around us i tell you in 2022 we need to
[56:17] set our mind and set our focus i want to
[56:20] move into that realm
[56:22] i want to have more of that working in
[56:25] my life what all of those things that
[56:27] you're reading brother jason let me give
[56:28] you this final two quotes
[56:30] proving his word
[56:32] he says
[56:34] he
[56:35] is the quickening power
[56:37] he is the spirit the dynamics that comes
[56:39] into the mechanics the words that make
[56:42] it live it ha it and it
[56:46] all has to work together
[56:49] or it just don't work
[56:51] see
[56:52] it's so you can't just have
[56:56] mental assent to true teaching
[57:00] you can't just agree mentally that the
[57:02] word is accurate
[57:04] the word is accurate whether you agree
[57:06] with it or not
[57:08] the rapture is not depending on you to
[57:10] agree with it this word is accurate
[57:13] the message of the hour is accurate it
[57:16] doesn't need you or me to judge it it
[57:18] just needs me and you to live it
[57:21] amen
[57:22] and so it all has to work together it's
[57:25] got to take the whole bible
[57:28] the whole christ the full gospel finally
[57:31] he says
[57:32] trying to do god's service without it
[57:34] being his will without it being god's
[57:36] will
[57:37] 1965 old church here and across the
[57:40] nation listen to your humble servant
[57:42] will you he says look where you were a
[57:45] few years ago when this first started
[57:47] now look what impersonations has
[57:48] capitalized on it and great millions and
[57:50] billions of dollars has flown into
[57:52] organizations
[57:55] see they're they're building great big
[57:56] buildings and
[57:58] and
[57:58] those denominational systems
[58:01] that
[58:02] that despised brother branham reaped
[58:04] millions off of his ministry
[58:06] he poured he poured
[58:08] souls and people into their churches
[58:11] when when when churchianity was dying in
[58:14] america and and william branham
[58:16] spearheads a campaign a spearhead's a
[58:18] revival that sweeps around and every
[58:20] other global evangelist started up under
[58:22] him
[58:23] and went forward
[58:25] and he says then what have they done
[58:27] it's all just been capitalized on and
[58:30] it's all a bunch of impersonations and
[58:32] billions of dollars has flown into
[58:33] organizations see
[58:35] still away from the word of god
[58:37] buildings and organizations is not the
[58:40] way god stirs his spirit he stirs it
[58:44] right into his word
[58:46] to make it
[58:47] live
[58:50] i i love the the renovations we've done
[58:53] to this property i i love the ideas that
[58:55] we have going forward but i want to tell
[58:58] you something friends if we didn't have

[59:17] off the side of the road and mash all
[59:18] their mash it all down mash all the
[59:20] weeds down and it'd just be an old brush
[59:21] arbor and they'd get in there singing
[59:23] and playing a tambourine shouting and

[1:01:15] years and knowledge of the word of god

[1:01:18] drew me up an outline and
[1:01:20] preached some
[1:01:22] quiet you know

[1:01:34] supper but lord i
[1:01:36] i that's not what i felt in my heart i i
[1:01:39] felt in my heart i wanted to come to
[1:01:40] this service lord with uh with uh with
[1:01:43] the prepared supper before me to say
[1:01:45] lord it it works the gospel works and
[1:01:48] we're believers and and we want to see
[1:01:50] the power of god this is what a prophet
[1:01:52] taught us that we're to expect
[1:01:54] this is what a prophet taught us where
[1:01:56] to look for
[1:01:57] we're to look for the power and
[1:01:58] demonstration of the holy spirit lord as
[1:02:01] we come to this supper
[1:02:03] may the sincerity of our heart be great
[1:02:07] may our humility lord to say amen to

[1:02:14] lord not to i wasn't here my my whole
[1:02:17] theme as you well know father my whole
[1:02:20] theme wasn't to just
[1:02:22] pep the people up and say oh let's
[1:02:24] charge in and have a bunch of power of
[1:02:25] god the whole challenge of it was
[1:02:29] to have more of the word and the
[1:02:32] fellowship of the spirit in my life i'm
[1:02:34] not trying to make it happen i'm not
[1:02:37] trying to make anything happen you will

[1:03:04] closeness to god that i ever have at any
[1:03:07] point in my life
[1:03:09] i believe lord that that people who
[1:03:11] accomplish that that would be the people
[1:03:13] who break out of this dimension and go
[1:03:16] into another realm
[1:03:18] that's the ones that'll do it lord
[1:03:22] i don't know what'll happen lord it
[1:03:25] i i don't have confidence
[1:03:28] i wish i did i wish i could stand here
[1:03:30] and just say oh it's okay as long as you
[1:03:33] come to this church and you believe god
[1:03:34] sent a prophet and you're a believer

[1:03:38] get sincere very dedicated you'll be
[1:03:40] fine the lord will the lord will just
[1:03:41] jerk you in anyhow i i like saying that
[1:03:45] i it gives me hope to believe none none
[1:03:47] that i that are under my care would be
[1:03:49] lost but lord i don't have the
[1:03:51] confidence
[1:03:53] in that
[1:03:54] like i like the confidence i have in
[1:03:57] tonight and what i've said
[1:04:00] that i have a great confidence i know
[1:04:02] that the people
[1:04:03] who follow these
[1:04:06] this message that i've given out here
[1:04:07] tonight these quotes that i've read and
[1:04:09] these challenges that i've made i know
[1:04:12] those are the people that will take i
[1:04:14] have a hundred percent confidence those
[1:04:17] are the people for sure
[1:04:19] who will go in the rapture
[1:04:22] and people who just won't who just don't
[1:04:25] and year after year they just allow
[1:04:28] carnality in their lives and they just
[1:04:30] oh i'll get serious with god someday and
[1:04:33] one of these days they're going to wake
[1:04:35] up and there ain't going to be another
[1:04:36] day to do that
[1:04:38] i pray tonight father that there'll be a
[1:04:41] a sincerity in our hearts lord to press
[1:04:44] press into this type of relationship
[1:04:47] that a prophet has described in these
[1:04:50] quotes
[1:04:51] where it is a it is a recreation
[1:04:54] of the early church
[1:04:56] that church was on fire lord that church
[1:04:59] was fervent that church had faith that
[1:05:03] church had zeal that church was
[1:05:06] determined to be separate from the world

[1:05:14] grant that to us grant to us that desire
[1:05:18] to to say lord i want to make my
[1:05:20] commitment this year at the end of this

[1:05:26] going to give my mind more to reading
[1:05:28] and hearing your word i'm going to give
[1:05:30] my heart more to fellowship and prayer
[1:05:33] i'm going to give my schedule more to
[1:05:35] being at the house of god and being
[1:05:36] among the saints and putting my shoulder
[1:05:39] to the wheel with everybody else lord
[1:05:42] and and be all for one and one for all

[1:05:55] be the only one
[1:05:56] i just don't believe i will be i believe
[1:05:58] there's plenty of people in here tonight
[1:06:00] and listening online who say lord
[1:06:03] oh father
[1:06:04] i'll raise up my hands and say i'm
[1:06:06] determined in this new coming year to
[1:06:08] press when i take this communion supper
[1:06:11] tonight i'm taking it with a greater
[1:06:13] purpose i'm taking it with a greater
[1:06:15] determination i'm not just completing
[1:06:17] symbolism this isn't just ritualism i
[1:06:20] lord i'm identifying myself with
[1:06:23] something
[1:06:24] so i committed to you in jesus name
[1:06:27] amen
[1:06:30] paul says here as brother luther begins
[1:06:32] to prepare the items
[1:06:36] now concerning or excuse me
[1:06:40] for i have received of the lord
[1:06:42] that which also i delivered unto you
[1:06:45] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:06:47] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:06:50] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:06:53] and said take heed this is my body
[1:06:56] which is broken for you
[1:06:58] this do in remembrance of me
[1:07:00] after the same manner also he took the
[1:07:02] cup and when he had sucked saying this
[1:07:05] cup is the new testament in my blood
[1:07:07] this do ye as oft as you drink it in
[1:07:11] remembrance of me
[1:07:12] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:07:16] drink this cup
[1:07:17] you do show the lord's death till he
[1:07:20] come
[1:07:21] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:07:24] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:07:26] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:07:28] and blood of the lord
[1:07:30] now i love
[1:07:32] this next verse
[1:07:35] because
[1:07:36] when i i remember when i was a teenager
[1:07:39] growing up
[1:07:40] and i love the lord and i believed the
[1:07:42] message but you know i still
[1:07:45] i couldn't go in on my mom and dad's
[1:07:47] coattails i had to have my own
[1:07:49] experience with god
[1:07:51] and i and i this that that 27th verse
[1:07:55] was so foreboding to me
[1:07:57] it seemed like such a harbinger of doom
[1:07:59] every time i would read it wherefore
[1:08:01] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:08:03] this cup of the lord unworthily shall be
[1:08:05] guilty of the body and blood of the lord
[1:08:08] you can carry on sister ruth
[1:08:10] but then but then one day the lord just
[1:08:13] reminded me just read the next verse
[1:08:17] verse 28 but let a man examine himself
[1:08:21] and so let him eat of that bread
[1:08:23] and drink of that cup
[1:08:26] your requirement
[1:08:28] to eat this bread and drink of this cup
[1:08:30] is not that your report card has
[1:08:32] straight a's
[1:08:34] from the year past
[1:08:36] but that you're here tonight and you're
[1:08:38] willing to be examined in your heart by
[1:08:40] the presence of god you're willing to
[1:08:42] stand under the fountain of the word and
[1:08:44] wherever god has touched you and said
[1:08:47] this needs this needs improved this
[1:08:48] needs fixed this needs redone this needs
[1:08:50] repented this needs you to say amen amen
[1:08:53] amen amen lord all my life under the
[1:08:57] blood right now

[1:09:20] and say god help me
[1:09:22] god help me how many want to how many

[1:24:14] turn there myself
[1:24:25] and i had it marked excellent

[1:24:34] for i said in my haste
[1:24:36] 22 yes i'm sorry
[1:24:38] um for i said in my haste
[1:24:41] i am cut off from before thine eyes
[1:24:43] nevertheless thou heardest my voice the
[1:24:46] voice of my supplications when i cried
[1:24:48] unto thee
[1:24:49] amen y'all can be seated
[1:24:52] um
[1:24:54] knowing that this is a new year's eve
[1:24:57] service um kind of wanted to think about
[1:25:00] the last year really two years going
[1:25:02] into 2022.
[1:25:05] um
[1:25:06] you know the last few years have been
[1:25:07] really dark and kind of
[1:25:10] psychologically depressing and it feels
[1:25:12] like there's a lot of darkness
[1:25:14] especially more than there ever seems
[1:25:15] like before and
[1:25:18] i've
[1:25:19] it seems like there's just been this
[1:25:21] wave of almost psychological
[1:25:22] manipulation
[1:25:24] um and it had my mind thinking about um
[1:25:27] certain things that i've experienced in
[1:25:29] and some of my education and and
[1:25:31] different things and
[1:25:32] um i wanted to just take a few minutes
[1:25:34] and talk about um
[1:25:36] something a phrase you some of you might
[1:25:38] have heard it
[1:25:39] have you ever heard the term gaslighting
[1:25:42] people you use it a lot
[1:25:44] in the news you get some talking head
[1:25:45] and saying oh this politician is lying
[1:25:46] he's trying to gaslight the american
[1:25:47] people well what that effectively means
[1:25:50] is it's somebody who's trying to lie to
[1:25:52] you and tell you that what you saw and
[1:25:53] what you experienced didn't actually
[1:25:54] happen and then it's all a lie it's all
[1:25:56] fake you're crazy you don't know what
[1:25:58] you're talking about and you don't
[1:26:00] believe you're lying eyes right um well
[1:26:04] this is actually a term that comes from
[1:26:06] the psychology world um it is
[1:26:08] actually a tactic that abusive people
[1:26:10] will use to keep their victims under
[1:26:13] their thumb right because if you've got
[1:26:15] some abusive relationship say um some
[1:26:17] man beating up his wife he can't just
[1:26:19] beat her up and then
[1:26:20] because she'll just leave right he has
[1:26:22] to also psychologically manipulate her
[1:26:24] keep her in the relationship so she
[1:26:25] doesn't just
[1:26:27] go away from him so
[1:26:29] um it's the idea that you're going to
[1:26:30] keep somebody psychologically
[1:26:31] manipulated that they're not going to
[1:26:32] know what's the truth they're not going
[1:26:33] to know what's real they're going to be
[1:26:35] completely confused and they're not
[1:26:36] going to trust their own judgment and
[1:26:38] have faith in their own
[1:26:40] knowledge of what's happening and
[1:26:42] you wonder how in the world did the term
[1:26:43] gaslighting
[1:26:45] get attached to that well actually comes
[1:26:47] from an old movie that was actually
[1:26:50] originally a play written back in the
[1:26:51] 1800s called the gaslights
[1:26:54] um and so i figured i would just take a
[1:26:56] little bit of time and tell you the
[1:26:57] story because i thought it was very
[1:26:58] interesting i figured if brother branham
[1:27:00] could preach on a pack of cigarettes i
[1:27:01] can preach on an old movie um so um
[1:27:05] the the story goes that there was a man
[1:27:09] who's kind of a charlatan and a con
[1:27:11] and he finds about finds out about this
[1:27:14] woman who is an heir or an heiress
[1:27:16] rather to an estate
[1:27:19] the problem is she doesn't know that
[1:27:20] she's an heir to the full extent of the
[1:27:22] state she doesn't know what she really
[1:27:23] got um she got a house and then
[1:27:26] somewhere hidden in that house that she
[1:27:27] doesn't know about is actually an old
[1:27:30] family heirloom it's a some sort of
[1:27:32] treasure of some kind
[1:27:33] and
[1:27:35] the
[1:27:36] this man realizes that she doesn't know
[1:27:38] what she's got he knows that somewhere
[1:27:40] in that
[1:27:42] house somewhere is hidden this treasure
[1:27:44] and he's got to get access to it right
[1:27:46] he wants to get access to this thing he
[1:27:48] doesn't care about her he just wants
[1:27:49] that treasure
[1:27:50] so he convinces her to marry him
[1:27:53] and the whole time they're living in
[1:27:55] this house
[1:27:56] he is trying to get this treasure right
[1:27:58] now
[1:28:01] ain't that just like the devil
[1:28:03] right he doesn't care about us he
[1:28:05] doesn't care about anything but he'll
[1:28:06] tell you all kinds of sweet nothings to
[1:28:07] get into your life to get you
[1:28:09] to go along with what his plans are
[1:28:11] because he knows that you have something
[1:28:13] that he he doesn't have and he doesn't
[1:28:14] have access to it right um
[1:28:17] i don't really have time to read it but
[1:28:18] brother branham talks about um how that
[1:28:21] uh satan wanted humanity specifically
[1:28:23] because he he couldn't reproduce himself
[1:28:25] he has no creative power humanity
[1:28:27] actually has creative power and satan
[1:28:29] doesn't have that he can't build an eden
[1:28:31] without us
[1:28:32] can't build in his eden without the
[1:28:34] cooperation of humanity so his only path
[1:28:37] to satan's eden is to is to manipulate
[1:28:39] humanity into building it for him okay
[1:28:43] so
[1:28:45] this guy
[1:28:46] um
[1:28:47] he's
[1:28:48] he also has a problem because he doesn't
[1:28:50] like this woman he doesn't actually love
[1:28:52] her and he just wants the
[1:28:54] treasure so
[1:28:56] he needs to get rid of her but he can't
[1:28:58] kill her
[1:28:59] because that's he's got another problem
[1:29:01] see there's there's a third person in
[1:29:03] this story and i'm gonna i'm gonna take
[1:29:05] a little bit of poetic license with this
[1:29:07] particular story so if you go back and
[1:29:09] watch the movie it don't
[1:29:11] it's not going to be uh
[1:29:13] exactly accurate so
[1:29:15] this third character is a is a
[1:29:18] is a policeman right and he he kind of
[1:29:20] liked this girl going way back right
[1:29:22] they kind of grew up together and they
[1:29:24] they liked each other they had a bit of
[1:29:25] a relationship right
[1:29:27] he
[1:29:29] when they were younger but as you know
[1:29:30] time went on and they kind of fell apart
[1:29:32] right and you know that's
[1:29:34] kind of how we get when we're young and
[1:29:36] we're in church and we get a little bit
[1:29:39] of a relationship with god and we maybe
[1:29:40] get baptized but then time goes on and
[1:29:42] become teenagers and the devil convinces
[1:29:44] us that we need to be in a relationship
[1:29:45] with this guy
[1:29:47] and so
[1:29:48] you end up in a relationship that you
[1:29:49] didn't really want to be in the first
[1:29:51] place with somebody who doesn't actually
[1:29:52] love you and now you're trapped
[1:29:56] and
[1:29:57] this policeman he knows what's up he
[1:29:59] knows that this girl got taken for a
[1:30:01] ride
[1:30:02] and
[1:30:04] he knows that he cares about her and he
[1:30:06] can't just go
[1:30:07] he can't just go haul her away they're
[1:30:09] married he's got to have he's got to be
[1:30:11] able to use the law to justify handling
[1:30:13] the situ the situation and he knows that
[1:30:15] if he just investigates it far enough
[1:30:17] he'll he'll solve the situation because
[1:30:19] the law will always solve it
[1:30:22] so
[1:30:23] um
[1:30:25] and he knows and so the our villain he
[1:30:27] knows he can't just kill the kill the
[1:30:28] girl because law man will get him right
[1:30:31] there's there's there's an authority
[1:30:32] that won't let him do that so what he
[1:30:34] does is he starts
[1:30:36] manipulating her he starts convincing
[1:30:37] her
[1:30:38] that everything that she knows is a lie
[1:30:42] and he does stuff like he will move her
[1:30:44] keys around or he'll
[1:30:46] move the dishes around when she wasn't
[1:30:47] looking and then she'll be like wasn't
[1:30:49] that sitting over there no honey it was
[1:30:51] always the way it is right now
[1:30:53] and she starts doubting herself she
[1:30:55] starts getting a little bit
[1:30:56] you know feeling a little bit weird
[1:30:57] about it and he starts slowly ramping it
[1:30:59] up until
[1:31:01] find like one day she goes to a friend's
[1:31:03] house and he repaints some of the walls
[1:31:04] and she goes like why is that green oh
[1:31:06] honey it was always green
[1:31:09] you know
[1:31:10] and we get you know we'll have
[1:31:11] experiences we'll have things that we
[1:31:12] know happened we we had
[1:31:15] we saw something in the word we we know
[1:31:17] where we stand and then the devil come
[1:31:18] along go oh no you're it wasn't ever
[1:31:20] that way you never got that deliverance
[1:31:22] that you thought you got
[1:31:23] right
[1:31:24] and
[1:31:26] he slowly starts ramping it up ramping
[1:31:28] it up and she starts getting a little
[1:31:30] bit she starts getting farther and
[1:31:32] farther into her own head
[1:31:35] and she starts really doubting herself
[1:31:38] and she starts not associating with
[1:31:40] people
[1:31:42] because she she feels bad she feels like
[1:31:43] she's going crazy
[1:31:45] and this guy is convincing her that
[1:31:46] she's nuts
[1:31:47] and she's nothing wrong with her
[1:31:49] she knows the truth and she's being
[1:31:52] convinced that shh everything that she
[1:31:53] knows is a lie
[1:31:55] and so she stops associating with her
[1:31:57] friends because she's she's so
[1:31:59] put off by everything she doesn't know
[1:32:01] what's what's real and what isn't
[1:32:03] you know in christians when we're going
[1:32:05] through a hard time
[1:32:06] and we don't know where we are
[1:32:08] and things get really dark
[1:32:10] and the first thing we'll do is we'll
[1:32:13] start isolating
[1:32:15] right
[1:32:16] i mean
[1:32:17] really in any abusive relationship one
[1:32:20] of the first signs is see the abused
[1:32:22] party will always start self-isolating
[1:32:24] because that abuser is trying to keep
[1:32:25] you keep the the abused away from other
[1:32:27] people who can help them
[1:32:29] right trying to trying to draw draw a
[1:32:31] line and a wall
[1:32:33] and so
[1:32:35] in this the in this story the villain
[1:32:38] he's always around her he doesn't let
[1:32:39] her be around other people without him
[1:32:41] there right it's like whenever you get
[1:32:42] around you know when you're going
[1:32:43] through a hard time and the devil's just
[1:32:45] beating you down
[1:32:47] you know you get around church people
[1:32:49] and that's when the devil is going to
[1:32:50] start attacking you in your mind
[1:32:52] right it's when you get away out away
[1:32:53] from yourself and get nice and isolated
[1:32:55] then then he'll give you some relief
[1:32:56] make you think that's what you want
[1:32:58] right make you think the solution to
[1:33:00] your psychological pain is to not be
[1:33:02] around people
[1:33:04] so
[1:33:06] he's always he's always there always
[1:33:08] always questioning her in front of other
[1:33:09] people always doing everything he can to
[1:33:10] make her feel make her doubt what she
[1:33:13] knows is the truth
[1:33:15] and so
[1:33:17] as time goes on he gets more and more
[1:33:19] grand in
[1:33:21] what he does to get her to doubt herself
[1:33:24] and at this point she's completely
[1:33:26] isolated doesn't go out anymore doesn't
[1:33:28] doesn't
[1:33:30] gather together you know with her with
[1:33:32] her people
[1:33:34] and the final thing that he does to get
[1:33:37] her
[1:33:38] to break
[1:33:40] because in the in the story it's back in
[1:33:42] the old days before they had electric
[1:33:43] lighting
[1:33:44] they had gas natural gas lamps on all
[1:33:47] the walls and he went to all the valves
[1:33:49] and he turned the gas down and it got
[1:33:52] any slowly over time
[1:33:54] until the lights
[1:33:55] got darker and darker
[1:33:57] and all the shades are pulled and she's
[1:33:59] walking around the middle of the day in
[1:34:00] almost perfect darkness
[1:34:02] and there's no lights and she's going
[1:34:03] around going man
[1:34:05] it's dark in here
[1:34:07] and he's going oh no this is how bright
[1:34:09] it's always been
[1:34:10] you've always been in darkness
[1:34:14] and that's where we end up
[1:34:16] the devil will get us so cornered
[1:34:18] and so surrounded and so convinced that
[1:34:21] the trial that we're in has always been
[1:34:23] there
[1:34:24] and
[1:34:26] that we're crazy and then we're hopeless
[1:34:28] and that there's there's no light and
[1:34:29] there never was any light
[1:34:32] and finally she just breaks down she's
[1:34:34] going through a mental breakdown and
[1:34:37] he's like oh honey
[1:34:40] we'll just take you to the mental
[1:34:41] hospital
[1:34:42] you're clearly going insane we'll take
[1:34:44] you to the mental hospital they'll be
[1:34:46] able to help you
[1:34:48] and so she goes and starts packing her
[1:34:50] bags to go check herself into the
[1:34:51] instant institution
[1:34:54] because she's a perfectly normal person
[1:34:56] who knows the truth knows that there's
[1:34:58] light outside and is so convinced that
[1:35:00] her life is nothing but darkness
[1:35:02] that she's going to go check herself
[1:35:04] into
[1:35:05] a prison cell effectively
[1:35:07] and
[1:35:09] that is what the devil will do to you he
[1:35:11] will get you to go check yourself into
[1:35:13] your own prison cell
[1:35:16] and he'll tell you that that's what you
[1:35:18] want that oh well you know
[1:35:20] this this
[1:35:22] disease that you have
[1:35:23] you know it's it's all you're going to
[1:35:25] have it's what you have you're never
[1:35:27] going to get out of it just accept what
[1:35:28] you have right
[1:35:30] or you know the psychological problem or
[1:35:33] uh this marital problem or financial
[1:35:35] whatever it is anything that the devil
[1:35:37] is going to he will convince you that
[1:35:38] what you have is not only
[1:35:41] you know correct and that you you there
[1:35:43] isn't anything outside of it but also
[1:35:46] that you kind of deserve it
[1:35:48] right
[1:35:50] so
[1:35:51] this is the little part in the movie
[1:35:53] right it's literally dark and you know
[1:35:54] we're surrounded by a lot of darkness in
[1:35:56] the world and sometimes it's going to
[1:35:56] get feel really dark in the world
[1:35:59] well this is when our hero comes in
[1:36:02] because he knows what's going on he
[1:36:03] knows this girl is isolated he knows
[1:36:05] there's something wrong
[1:36:06] and so he he decides
[1:36:09] one day he's going to go knock on the
[1:36:10] door
[1:36:11] he's going to see what's going on so he
[1:36:12] knocks on the door the policeman
[1:36:14] and she opens the door and she's packing
[1:36:17] her bags to go
[1:36:18] take herself away to the
[1:36:20] padded room
[1:36:21] and
[1:36:22] he walks in there and he's kind of
[1:36:24] talking to her is like so how's it been
[1:36:25] oh that's nice
[1:36:26] why is it so dark in here
[1:36:29] and she goes
[1:36:30] it's always been this dark it goes no
[1:36:33] it's not
[1:36:34] look and he turns the light on
[1:36:36] and then her eyes come open she's like
[1:36:38] whoa
[1:36:39] it's lighting here
[1:36:41] there's i wasn't crazy after all
[1:36:44] right the devil's gonna convince you
[1:36:46] that you're you're crazy but there's a
[1:36:48] man who can turn lights on right no
[1:36:50] matter how dark it's going to get for
[1:36:52] you there's a man who can turn on the
[1:36:54] lights no matter how dark it gets in the
[1:36:55] world no matter how dark it gets in your
[1:36:57] life no matter how convinced you are
[1:36:59] that what you have is going to be there
[1:37:01] forever
[1:37:02] it's a lie
[1:37:04] it's always been a lie it's always going
[1:37:06] to be a lie there's always light in the
[1:37:08] world and there's a man who can give it
[1:37:10] to you it's not me but it is the
[1:37:12] policeman
[1:37:14] who by the way i thought this was
[1:37:15] interesting
[1:37:16] he now has the grounds to throw out this
[1:37:19] this villain
[1:37:20] right who's a deadbeat and a bum who has
[1:37:23] no ability to contribute to this
[1:37:25] relationship other than abuse okay he
[1:37:27] can now deal with that because the woman
[1:37:29] is on his side
[1:37:31] she's accepting the deliverance that
[1:37:32] he's bringing her
[1:37:34] okay
[1:37:35] and
[1:37:38] in in our particular story not only is
[1:37:40] he the the law man he's also the one who
[1:37:42] wrote the law and the white wig judge so
[1:37:44] he's going to
[1:37:45] find this person guilty and kill him
[1:37:48] that's the poetic license um
[1:37:50] so
[1:37:51] he's going to kill this villain on the
[1:37:53] spot and that is the deliverance that
[1:37:55] the lord is offering you today i don't
[1:37:57] care how dark and this is
[1:38:00] going forward into the new year i know
[1:38:02] things are going to get dark it's
[1:38:04] prophesied that it's going to get dark
[1:38:08] it's not going to get any any better
[1:38:10] and it's only going to get worse but no
[1:38:13] matter how dark it's going to get there
[1:38:15] is somebody who has light and can
[1:38:18] deliver us
[1:38:19] and um
[1:38:21] and uh that's uh
[1:38:24] what was on my heart
[1:38:25] and i got 40
[1:38:27] 38 seconds left so and uh

[1:53:20] his word it says the lord thy god is
[1:53:22] with thee wherever thou goest no matter
[1:53:24] what it is how hard it is how great the
[1:53:26] obstacle is that doesn't matter if it's
[1:53:29] down through the valley of the shadow of
[1:53:31] death the lord thy god is with thee
[1:53:33] wherever thou goest how joshua could
[1:53:35] call israel together and say stand here
[1:53:37] and watch the glory of the lord god is
[1:53:40] with us god made that promise amen
[1:53:43] friends god said to joshua every place
[1:53:45] that the souls of your feet set that's
[1:53:48] yours i'll give it to you
[1:53:51] that's yours friends he said that he
[1:53:54] gave it to us they were those were two
[1:53:56] men if you go back and listen
[1:53:58] to this week you should go back and
[1:53:59] listen to one in a million friends they
[1:54:01] were one in a million because they were
[1:54:03] the two that made it to the promised
[1:54:04] land they were given eyes that could see
[1:54:07] that land they knew god had promised
[1:54:09] them that land they knew that whatever
[1:54:11] the giants if you go back and read that
[1:54:13] story the the other the other messengers
[1:54:15] said that they were that they were
[1:54:17] giants that they they couldn't overcome
[1:54:19] but joshua and caleb said to them no
[1:54:21] friends we have a promise from the
[1:54:22] almighty god that we can overcome that
[1:54:25] land we can possess it and we are at
[1:54:27] that time now friends i'm telling you
[1:54:29] we're at that time
[1:54:31] in one in a million there i have it
[1:54:32] right here the quote when israel and
[1:54:33] egypt there was approximately two
[1:54:35] million people left at the same time
[1:54:37] everyone heard the message of the
[1:54:38] prophet everyone saw everyone saw the
[1:54:41] pillar of fire every one of them was
[1:54:43] baptized to moses in the red sea amen
[1:54:45] every single one of them shouted in the
[1:54:47] spirit they beat the tambourines they
[1:54:50] run up and down the bank with me with
[1:54:51] miriam when moses sang in the spirit
[1:54:53] every one of them drank from the same
[1:54:56] spiritual rock
[1:54:58] they everyone ate fresh manna every
[1:55:00] night every one of them two but two
[1:55:03] out of a million
[1:55:04] made the land that's one in a million
[1:55:06] two two million and two of them made it
[1:55:08] that's one in a million what was the
[1:55:10] test they all drank the same rock they
[1:55:12] all like the same manna that we're
[1:55:14] eating this morning but the word test
[1:55:16] proved it when it came to the time of
[1:55:18] kadesh barnia when they were to go into
[1:55:20] the promised land they could not go over
[1:55:22] till it was tested by the word friends
[1:55:25] this this is tested by the word this
[1:55:27] message that we're living in now has
[1:55:29] been tested by the word and it's been
[1:55:30] proved it's been proved over and over
[1:55:32] again and i'm living it today i can say
[1:55:34] with all my heart i'm living it today
[1:55:36] have i fallen have each one of us fallen
[1:55:38] since especially each one of us has
[1:55:40] fallen we've come short paul would say
[1:55:42] oh wretched man that i am i am i am the
[1:55:45] greatest sinner among all of us but but
[1:55:48] i am here by the glory of god to
[1:55:50] encourage you to stand and to go into
[1:55:53] the promised land in this in this new
[1:55:54] year it says
[1:55:56] um we can make it we're like
[1:55:58] grasshoppers to them they're great
[1:56:00] walled city the opposition was too great
[1:56:02] but caleb and joshua stilled the people
[1:56:05] they said we're more than able to do it
[1:56:07] amen why because god said it before they
[1:56:11] left the promised land he said that i'm
[1:56:12] gonna give you the land i'm gonna give
[1:56:14] it
[1:56:15] and it will be yours
[1:56:17] and they were one out of a million amen
[1:56:19] friends
[1:56:21] amen friends we're gonna turn to um to
[1:56:24] joshua real quick just ending ending
[1:56:28] chapter joshua 14
[1:56:30] verses 6 through 9 and it says then the
[1:56:32] children of judah came up unto joshua
[1:56:34] into gilgal and caleb the set the son of
[1:56:37] jeffernua the kazai said unto them thou
[1:56:39] knowest the thing that the lord said
[1:56:40] unto moses the man of god concerning me
[1:56:43] and thee in gadesh barnea forty years
[1:56:46] old was i when the servant when moses
[1:56:48] was a servant of the lord sent to me to
[1:56:49] kadesh barnea to spy out the land and i
[1:56:51] brought him word
[1:56:52] as it was in my heart nevertheless amen
[1:56:55] friends nevertheless can we say
[1:56:57] nevertheless my brethren that went with
[1:56:58] me made the heart of the people melt but
[1:57:01] i followed the lord i want to i want to
[1:57:03] be able to say that on that day oh
[1:57:06] well done my good and faithful servant
[1:57:08] because i follow the lord and moses
[1:57:09] sweared on that day and surely the land
[1:57:11] where thou on hath trodden shall be
[1:57:13] thine inheritance and thy children
[1:57:15] forever because thou hast fully followed
[1:57:18] the lord and this new year friends let's
[1:57:20] just fully follow the lord and we'll
[1:57:22] take stride amen praise the lord
[1:57:25] [Applause]
[1:57:40] god bless you all
[1:57:43] usually takes me about 15 minutes just
[1:57:44] to get started so
[1:57:47] we're going to do better here
[1:57:49] amen i want to speak about thought
[1:57:52] distortions
[1:57:53] so you got it up for me
[1:57:55] we're
[1:57:57] coming into the new year and you start
[1:57:59] to think about
[1:58:01] plans and and making plans and wanting
[1:58:04] to improve yourself coming into the new
[1:58:06] year
[1:58:07] we think of things like renewing our
[1:58:09] purpose
[1:58:10] making new goals
[1:58:12] spending more time in devotions
[1:58:14] losing weight etc etc etc
[1:58:18] all right what is brother brent let's
[1:58:20] see what brother branham talks about
[1:58:22] with new year's resolutions he says some
[1:58:24] people say
[1:58:25] well
[1:58:26] you should live a better life turn a new
[1:58:28] page this is new year's oh how many
[1:58:30] resolutions did you make and all of you
[1:58:32] broke them it'll never work it's dying
[1:58:35] out and a rebirth a regeneration a new
[1:58:38] creature in christ jesus that's what the
[1:58:40] world needs today that's what the church
[1:58:42] needs today is an old time apostolic god
[1:58:45] shaken holy ghost revival that's right i
[1:58:48] don't mean a bunch of fanaticism i don't
[1:58:50] believe in a bunch of emotional worked
[1:58:53] up but i mean a real true blood-borne
[1:58:56] salvation that sets men free from sin
[1:58:59] and makes him a new creature in christ
[1:59:02] that's what we need
[1:59:03] that's what we need
[1:59:06] but we want we want to we want to grow
[1:59:09] right that's the we make a new year's
[1:59:11] resolution we want to grow
[1:59:12] we want to improve ourselves
[1:59:14] right
[1:59:15] but you're not going to improve yourself
[1:59:17] just by writing something you want to do
[1:59:19] on a piece of paper
[1:59:21] or deciding to do something in your mind
[1:59:24] just like brother branham said
[1:59:26] that's that
[1:59:27] none of you have kept them
[1:59:29] none of you followed through sometimes
[1:59:31] you make it through january
[1:59:34] most the time you don't even make it
[1:59:35] that far
[1:59:38] romans 12 1-2 i beseech you
[1:59:41] therefore brethren by the mercies of god
[1:59:43] let this be our new year's resolution
[1:59:46] that you present your bodies as a living
[1:59:47] sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which
[1:59:50] is your reasonable service
[1:59:52] and be not conformed to this world but
[1:59:54] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:59:56] mind that you may prove what is that
[1:59:57] good
[1:59:58] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[2:00:03] proverbs 23 verse 7 for as he thinks
[2:00:06] thinketh in his heart so is he
[2:00:10] we hear that quoted often but we don't
[2:00:11] look at this next part eden drinks saith
[2:00:14] he to thee but his heart is not with
[2:00:16] thee in other words
[2:00:18] he says one thing but his thoughts
[2:00:21] are different than what he says
[2:00:24] his thoughts line up with his actions
[2:00:27] but his words are a lie
[2:00:29] so don't let your new new year's
[2:00:30] resolution prove that you're a liar
[2:00:35] don't let it do that
[2:00:38] go deeper
[2:00:40] understand when you're making and if
[2:00:42] you're making a new year's resolution i
[2:00:44] don't like to do that i like to live
[2:00:46] just a consistent life
[2:00:48] but let's put it this way many times you
[2:00:50] come to the end of the year thanksgiving
[2:00:52] rolls around the years coming to end and
[2:00:54] you say you start to examine yourself
[2:00:56] that's good
[2:00:57] we should do that every month
[2:00:59] we do that every week
[2:01:01] every day
[2:01:03] a few times a day
[2:01:06] continually but
[2:01:08] as you think in your heart so are you so
[2:01:11] understand if you want something to
[2:01:13] change in your life
[2:01:15] you have to first change your thinking
[2:01:19] and what do we want to do as christians
[2:01:21] we want to think think as the word has
[2:01:23] us think
[2:01:24] not our own way not the way culture
[2:01:26] tells us not the way people tell us
[2:01:27] around us not the way our parents raised
[2:01:30] us god bless them whatever they did
[2:01:32] they're not the word of god they're not
[2:01:33] the absolute we want to think god's ways
[2:01:37] all of us have
[2:01:38] right now inside of our mind
[2:01:41] thought distortions
[2:01:43] we think about ourselves
[2:01:45] contrary to the word of god
[2:01:47] and we just continue to do that in
[2:01:52] emotional weight in things about
[2:01:53] emotions and things about mentally
[2:01:56] physically spiritually all these
[2:01:59] different things we think about
[2:02:01] ourselves our lives our purpose
[2:02:04] incorrectly
[2:02:05] and we communicate back to ourselves
[2:02:09] incorrectly again
[2:02:11] again brother bam says we have no
[2:02:13] thought coming
[2:02:16] what does that mean it means that we are
[2:02:18] to think as the bible speaks
[2:02:21] we're to think biblical thoughts message
[2:02:24] thoughts
[2:02:25] truth
[2:02:26] let let our thought life
[2:02:29] shape our actions
[2:02:32] so what are thought distortions habitual
[2:02:34] ways of thinking
[2:02:36] that are often inaccurate and negatively
[2:02:38] biased
[2:02:39] we have to make no effort
[2:02:41] to think the way we think
[2:02:43] we just that's how we think
[2:02:45] but we need to examine ourselves
[2:02:48] and we need to be careful because the
[2:02:50] way you think is going to shape your
[2:02:51] actions
[2:02:53] simply put anything contrary to biblical
[2:02:55] truth is a thought distortion
[2:02:58] if it's not according to the bible
[2:03:00] throw it in the trash can
[2:03:02] and reshape your way of thinking
[2:03:06] i i couldn't stand here and tell you i
[2:03:08] could go down a list of types of thought
[2:03:10] distortions and i have a list of types
[2:03:12] of thought distortions i'll probably
[2:03:14] skip right past it
[2:03:16] but
[2:03:17] all of us
[2:03:18] have to go before the lord
[2:03:20] and let the holy spirit search us
[2:03:23] to where we think we're thinking
[2:03:25] incorrectly and it's producing the wrong
[2:03:27] kind of life
[2:03:29] that we have in us
[2:03:31] and around us the wrong atmosphere
[2:03:34] the wrong attitude and the wrong
[2:03:36] decisions
[2:03:38] so what's wrong with just thought
[2:03:39] distortions
[2:03:41] you deceive yourself self
[2:03:43] with the words that you speak to
[2:03:45] yourself in your mind
[2:03:48] but also your thoughts then produce the
[2:03:51] actions
[2:03:54] wrong thinking produces wrong actions
[2:03:56] which then produces wrong consequences
[2:03:59] in your life a natural example
[2:04:02] something stressful happens i'm probably
[2:04:04] guilty
[2:04:05] something stressful happens in your life
[2:04:07] and you habitually respond it doesn't
[2:04:09] take any thought it just naturally
[2:04:11] happens you go and start eating
[2:04:14] to calm down your stress
[2:04:18] is that supposed is is that what that's
[2:04:19] for
[2:04:21] is that what food is for
[2:04:23] is that what god wants us to do
[2:04:25] are we turning to the right thing that
[2:04:26] can help us
[2:04:28] what's the consequence
[2:04:30] stress is momentarily relieved
[2:04:32] but ends in increased stress and being
[2:04:35] overweight and unhealthy
[2:04:39] so renewed thinking says stressful event
[2:04:41] happens i need to respond the way the
[2:04:43] bible wants me to respond go to prayer
[2:04:47] and to reading the bible
[2:04:48] for your comfort
[2:04:50] that's true worship of god i'm in
[2:04:53] trouble let's go eat
[2:04:56] what's your worshiping your god is your
[2:04:57] belly
[2:04:59] you're worshiping food
[2:05:01] don't turn to that for comfort we turn
[2:05:03] to the lord for comfort
[2:05:05] and then what's the consequence of doing
[2:05:06] that
[2:05:08] god is working i'm receiving peace and
[2:05:11] stress is relieved
[2:05:14] source of thought distortions
[2:05:16] it's satan
[2:05:18] seeking to destroy mankind
[2:05:21] through deceit
[2:05:22] and doubt
[2:05:24] and to use that deceit and doubt
[2:05:27] to perpetuate deceit and doubt
[2:05:30] throughout the world
[2:05:32] it's a man-centered means of immediate
[2:05:36] survival
[2:05:37] but long-term destruction
[2:05:42] types of thought distortion polarized
[2:05:44] thinking everything's black and white
[2:05:45] either a person's an angel or a devil
[2:05:48] today they're an angel and then they do
[2:05:50] me wrong now they're devil
[2:05:53] over generalization
[2:05:54] you take
[2:05:56] you take one
[2:05:58] quickly
[2:06:00] you you experience one event in your
[2:06:02] life and then all other events that
[2:06:05] happen in the future are exactly like
[2:06:07] that event that happened before no
[2:06:08] they're not
[2:06:09] it's not how it works
[2:06:12] catastrophizing every
[2:06:14] ordinary worries and difficulties you
[2:06:18] figure out what the worst thing that
[2:06:19] could possibly happen and then you
[2:06:21] fixate that the catastrophe is coming
[2:06:24] everybody
[2:06:28] personalization you take things
[2:06:29] personally when it has nothing to do
[2:06:30] with you
[2:06:34] assuming you could be assuming you're
[2:06:36] purposely left out of something
[2:06:38] or assuming
[2:06:40] that someone speaking is oh that they
[2:06:43] were they they were
[2:06:45] speaking that against me
[2:06:48] you don't know that ask them
[2:06:50] you think that you know that but you
[2:06:52] don't know that
[2:06:55] mind reading
[2:06:57] that's when we assume we know what other
[2:06:59] people are thinking
[2:07:00] without considering all the evidence
[2:07:03] or even asking
[2:07:04] the person what what the case is what
[2:07:07] the situation is
[2:07:10] mental filtering ignoring anything
[2:07:12] positive in a situation and focusing
[2:07:14] completely on the negative
[2:07:16] interpret everything through a negative
[2:07:18] mental filter this leads to anxiety
[2:07:21] leads to depression suicidal thoughts
[2:07:24] holding on to guilt
[2:07:28] if you confess your sin to the lord
[2:07:30] ask for forgiveness
[2:07:31] made things right
[2:07:33] you don't need to hold on to the guilt
[2:07:34] anymore
[2:07:35] that's the devil distorting
[2:07:38] your mind saying i'm guilty i'm terrible
[2:07:40] i'm bad
[2:07:42] the thing's already been paid for
[2:07:44] stop thinking that way and think what
[2:07:46] god said if i confess my sins
[2:07:49] he's faithful and just to forgive my
[2:07:51] sins and cleanse me from all
[2:07:52] unrighteousness let's go let's move
[2:07:54] forward
[2:07:55] the past is the past i'm going i'm going
[2:07:57] forward with god
[2:08:00] emotional reasoning the thing that i
[2:08:02] feel
[2:08:03] is my absolute
[2:08:05] the thing that i feel
[2:08:06] the emotion that i feel is the truth
[2:08:09] okay you feel what you feel acknowledge
[2:08:11] it talk to somebody about it it's fine
[2:08:14] but don't judge what's really happening
[2:08:16] in the world
[2:08:18] based upon your emotions your emotions
[2:08:19] are not the truth the truth is the truth
[2:08:24] um
[2:08:25] labeling
[2:08:26] i'm a drunk i'm a failure i'm fat i'm
[2:08:28] ugly it's my stress
[2:08:30] i'm an anxious person it's my cancer
[2:08:33] etc etc you're not your failure and
[2:08:36] you're not your current situation
[2:08:38] you are you
[2:08:40] you're who god said you are
[2:08:42] you're defined by god you're not allowed
[2:08:44] to define yourself sorry
[2:08:47] you can do it if you want to but you're
[2:08:49] only hurting yourself
[2:08:51] listen to what god says about you you're
[2:08:53] fearfully and wonderfully made
[2:08:55] you're made in his image and likeness
[2:08:56] you're a son and daughter of god
[2:08:59] you couldn't possibly be anything better
[2:09:01] in the whole universe than that
[2:09:05] so stop thinking
[2:09:07] those other thoughts
[2:09:09] so they're not of god
[2:09:12] all right
[2:09:13] first corinthians
[2:09:15] 2 16.
[2:09:19] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[2:09:21] that
[2:09:22] he may instruct him
[2:09:23] but we have the mind of christ
[2:09:26] it is god's purpose for us to have the
[2:09:28] mind of christ not just about spiritual
[2:09:30] things but in every aspect of our life
[2:09:33] because
[2:09:35] the reality is the things that happen in
[2:09:37] this physical body impact your spiritual
[2:09:40] life the things that happen in your
[2:09:42] spirit your mind those five senses of
[2:09:44] your mind that impacts your spiritual
[2:09:48] life
[2:09:49] the the things that happen in your soul
[2:09:51] obviously impacts your spirit all of it
[2:09:53] does
[2:09:54] we want to have the mind of christ in
[2:09:57] each and everything amen
[2:10:02] we have to allow god into our thought
[2:10:05] life
[2:10:06] to change the way we habitually think
[2:10:09] probably the most blinded all of us are
[2:10:12] is in this area
[2:10:14] we think the way we think and it's
[2:10:16] perfectly logical
[2:10:18] it might not be
[2:10:20] it might not be it check it by the word
[2:10:23] are my is the way i'm thinking according
[2:10:25] to the word it's really easy to get
[2:10:27] caught up in the way you think
[2:10:29] and you get in this circle people that
[2:10:31] get caught in these things
[2:10:33] they're not healthy
[2:10:35] they're not spiritually healthy
[2:10:37] they're harming themselves and they're
[2:10:40] missing out on the good things that are
[2:10:41] all around them
[2:10:43] no not everything is black and white no
[2:10:45] not everything brother jason does is
[2:10:47] perfect or i do or the musician does
[2:10:51] name somebody that's even a professional
[2:10:53] musician who's perfect everything that
[2:10:55] they play they're not
[2:10:58] none of you are perfect none of you are
[2:10:59] either angels or demons
[2:11:02] your sons and daughters of god you make
[2:11:04] mistakes
[2:11:05] i make mistakes but we keep going
[2:11:07] forward
[2:11:08] we keep pressing forward
[2:11:10] and we
[2:11:12] submit our thoughts to god
[2:11:14] second corinthians 10 5 casting down
[2:11:16] imaginations and every high thing that
[2:11:18] exalts itself
[2:11:19] against the knowledge of god and
[2:11:20] bringing into captivity
[2:11:22] every thought
[2:11:24] every thought
[2:11:26] to the obedience of christ you want to
[2:11:28] have the mind of christ let's bring into
[2:11:30] captivity every thought
[2:11:32] to the obedience of christ
[2:11:35] well while
[2:11:37] amy sent me a little something about
[2:11:40] having just a few minutes to live
[2:11:42] brother jason you're saying well if
[2:11:43] there's just 30 minutes to live we have
[2:11:45] a pattern jesus christ
[2:11:47] what did jesus do with his last minutes
[2:11:49] of freedom
[2:11:50] his last time of freedom
[2:11:52] he washed feet
[2:11:54] he washed his disciples feet and he went
[2:11:56] and he prayed
[2:12:00] that's the that's these are that's just
[2:12:02] an example a small example
[2:12:05] we need to have the mind of christ
[2:12:08] in everything
[2:12:10] not just in spiritual things or church
[2:12:12] stuff
[2:12:14] everything
[2:12:17] last thing
[2:12:18] from the pergament church age in the
[2:12:20] church ages book brother branham says
[2:12:21] here's the secret of this
[2:12:23] the word is in the bride as it was in
[2:12:25] mary
[2:12:26] the bride has the mind of christ for she
[2:12:28] know what knows what he wants done with
[2:12:30] the word
[2:12:31] she performs the command of the word in
[2:12:33] his name for she has thus saith the lord
[2:12:36] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[2:12:38] and it comes to pass
[2:12:40] like a seed that is planted and watered
[2:12:42] it comes to full
[2:12:44] harvest serving its purpose that's the
[2:12:47] mind that we need to have
[2:12:49] that covers everything we've got to get
[2:12:51] we've got to allow the lord
[2:12:54] to purge us
[2:12:55] of our distorted and habitual way that
[2:12:57] we think
[2:12:58] so that the word is the only thing
[2:13:00] that's there amen god bless you
[2:13:04] [Applause]
[2:13:22] brother matthew was supposed to uh be
[2:13:24] taking this portion

[2:18:45] now verse 1 saint john 13 1. now before
[2:18:48] the feast of the passover
[2:18:50] when jesus knew that his hour was come
[2:18:52] that he should depart out of this world
[2:18:54] unto the father
[2:18:56] having loved his own which were in the
[2:18:57] world he loved them unto the end
[2:19:00] and supper being ended the devil having
[2:19:03] now put into the heart of judas iscariot
[2:19:05] simon's son to betray him
[2:19:07] jesus knowing that the father had given
[2:19:09] all things into his hands and that he
[2:19:12] was come from god and went to god he
[2:19:14] riseth from supper and laid aside his
[2:19:16] garments and took a towel and girded
[2:19:18] himself after that
[2:19:21] he poureth water into a basin and began
[2:19:23] to wash the disciples feet and to wipe
[2:19:26] them with the towel wherewith he was
[2:19:28] girded
[2:19:29] then cometh he to simon peter and peter
[2:19:31] sayeth unto him lord does thou wash my
[2:19:33] feet
[2:19:34] jesus answered and said unto him what i
[2:19:37] do thou knowest not now but thou shalt
[2:19:40] know hereafter
[2:19:42] peter saith unto him thou shalt never
[2:19:44] wash my feet
[2:19:45] jesus answered him if i wash thee not
[2:19:47] thou hast no part with me
[2:19:49] simon peter saith unto him lord not my
[2:19:51] feet only but also my hands and my head
[2:19:55] jesus saith to him he that is washed
[2:19:58] needeth not save to wash his feet but is
[2:20:01] clean every wit and year clean but not
[2:20:03] all
[2:20:04] for he knew who should betray him
[2:20:06] therefore said he ye are not all clean
[2:20:09] so after he had washed their feet and
[2:20:12] had taken his garments and was set down
[2:20:13] again he said unto them know ye what i
[2:20:16] have done to you you call me master and
[2:20:19] lord and you say well for so i am
[2:20:22] if i then your lord and master have

[2:20:33] done unto you

[2:20:38] is not greater than his lord neither he
[2:20:40] that is sent greater than he that sent
