[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning praise the lord everybody's happy well i got volunteered to teach the class this morning and so um i have been at my home church there my other home church have been teaching the i think they call it the upper class sunday school classes i think it's 12 and up and we've been going through the life of susannah wesley but we'll take a different turn today and uh amen i don't know this brother doug bowman pleasure to meet you brother doug amen just wanted to get a good look at everybody that i got in my my class so uh brother doug if you didn't know already i i'm brother dale and uh this was home for us these are my children here grandchildren and uh so we're we're relatives and and uh things so uh if you have your bibles i would like for you to stand with me as we take a verse of scripture and we'll amen turn to the book of revelations chapter 3. and i want to read one one verse there you can just bring up my powerpoint if you have it and chapter 3 and we want to read verse 14. amen revelations 3 and verse 14. it says unto the angel the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of god let's pray father we thank you lord today that we can be gathered lord is a sunday school class today lord to study lord no doubt there are many that are viewing lord from remote places and we just pray father today lord that their hearts will be encouraged and or that we as your children will be edified lord by the teaching of the word of god and we thank you for it in jesus name amen god bless you have your seats um we could we could spend a lot of time on uh many parts of this one verse of scripture uh namely the last part of it uh the beginning of the creation of god no doubt but jason has uh exhaustively spoke on that and uh i personally uh uh have much to say about that myself but today i want to just focus on one four-letter word called amen and the word amen is a when we take it from the perspective of the of what the prophet of god had to say about it it begins to be amplified uh in our ears the simple definition of the word when we start to break it down is it's very basic but when we start getting into some of the things that the prophet of god said about it then it begins to take on some some very potent uh meaning to us so do i have uh control of this up here okay and then i have to figure out the gadgets here i don't know the single button on one side the up down it's already on it's broke oh did somebody help me oh i can do it all by myself if somebody helps me amen so uh revelations 1 and 8 here oh okay good deal says i am the alpha and the omega now this is important when we're looking at the word amen because he has designated himself as the amen so when he uses this language here i am alpha that's the the the beginning the the a the greek alphabet and omega being the z of the greek alphabet the beginning and the ending so we understand that but we're gonna we're gonna come to something momentarily that uh you may not have ever realized it kind of goes uh kind of just gets caught in the narrative he says uh which is and which was and which is to come the almighty now he says uh going going on here in the book of revelation i want to just touch a couple of these just to clench the nail here he says when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the a and the z the first and the last and so the the word amen is from this is from the greek lexicon is a most remarkable word it is translated transliterated directly from the hebrew into the greek new testament and then into the latin and into english and many other languages so that it is practically a universal word now and and i just wanted to hit this because uh some of you may have caught the news uh there the other day there was a congressman i believe it was and so he was trying to bring in this uh gender neutrality and try to be respectful and he said amen and a woman or something like that not even realizing that he was just taking some carnal and it's supposed to be a a a a an educated man and he just and he thought that amen meant something that had to do with men and you know and so he just started throwing a woman in there well you know if he had half a lick of sense that's texas for if he was had any intelligence um that he would that he would uh that the word amen had nothing to do with man or woman but that it had but there was a universal word that that literally means faithful uh is directly uh uh related it's it's uh i like this in the from the lexicon it says that it has been called the best known word in human speech remember it comes from hebrew and it was trans literated down into greek and then into latin and now into english and so being one of the so if you want to say amen in spanish amen hebrew amen you know turkish amen it's it's in every language like hallelujah you know you it's it's a universal phrase that means uh in the hebrew it means it was from uh believe or faithful thus it came to mean surely or or tr sure or truly uh it's an expression of absolute trust and confidence so that when you say amen to something that has been said that you believe and have confidence in that it's the truth and you're and you're resting on that so that when you know something is said you know that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen amen what is it you have confidence in that you have complete trust that that is the truth and that it is a faithful saying that it is a faithful saying and that uh it's uh it's a true saying and so when jesus here in in uh in revelations 3 he said i'm the faithful and true witness he's using this language almost repetitively i'm the amen i am true i am faithful i i'm i'm unchangeable and so the word amen in a literal sense is solid firm foundation or the word firm metaphorically it could be faithfully or faithful verily the word verily is there we're going to inject that in a moment from the greek we'll see that it's used quite frequently in the new testament uh if if the word amen is used at the beginning of a statement uh or of a discourse such as verily verily i say unto you is this very common language in the new testament the lord jesus actually john is the only one that used the double amen amen at the beginning in his writings i think he's like 25 times that john uses verily verily where the other gospels they don't use that they only use the singular uh usage of the word verily but uh in in john uh many times but i reference john chapter 1 1-4 because in the beginning was the word the amen is that right and so he starts in the beginning with the word amen and he that amen became flesh in verse 14 and dwells among us so then at the end of a phrase it means so it is so be it uh it may be fulfilled you know you're saying that amen what's being said yeah you believe it and so uh it was a custom which passed over from the synagogues to the christian assemblies and when uh he had read or uh discoursed he had offered up solomon prayer to god and others responded amen and thus made i like this phrase here i should have capitalized it and thus made the substance of what was uttered their very own and that's right from the greek lexicon i i just i had to print that because that so that now then when something is said you know the works that i do shall you do also amen that you made that substance yours they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen amen that becomes your substance that becomes your possession and brother braham said when you take a promise of god and possess it as your own personal private property amen amen then you then now then what you have you you you have substance faith for faith is a substance is that right amen so i think that's where i'm supposed to be i hit it like three times yes so placing the the word amen at the end of a statement is a way of accepting agreeing or endorsing what came before from the old testament and and we're going to reference the old testament usage so that we can pick up what jesus said uh and what brother branham uh reveals to us in the church age book here but i wanted to inject this the bible says blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting to everlasting and then all the people said amen and praise the lord so now then there was this acceptance and and that uh this god of israel was from everlasting to everlasting basically an old testament uh uh version of hebrews 13 8. this thing's about backslid i think jesus uh from the new testament was fond of saying i'm just just following this narrative from the from the greek lexicon uh was fond of saying amen before making a statement now watch this this uh this as he goes on here this is tremendous making a statement or giving a message when used in this way the word amen has slightly different implications leading off with amen not only implies that what follows is true but also that the person making the statement has firsthand knowledge and authority about about it saying verily verily before making a statement is a strong claim to truth presented from an intrepid or a fearless attitude that word intrepid means undaunted amen that it means that it's it's fearless it's it's it's absolutely uh that it's undaunted in the face of any opposition or danger and so when jesus is saying verily verily i say unto you and then he comes forward with some uh profound statement such as you know i i i wanted to go back and pick up a bunch of references but then i'd get over and preaching on those scriptures so uh you you just go through the book of john and you'll find where where jesus speaks using uh these this he said you must be born again verily verizon you must be born again so he wasn't this wasn't some uh uh thing that he was guessing on but he had firsthand knowledge and it wasn't a it was a he was he was fearless in saying this because he knew the necessity of the new birth and that without the new birth you could never see the kingdom of god of which he had seen he said i came from god and i returned to god and so he was he was explaining there's one way to get there and it's only through the new birth verily verily would imply that the that what follows is that person's own original idea and so he wasn't he wasn't making this up as he went along but he was speaking he said i don't i don't do anything but what my father shows me so when jesus leads off with the words verily verily he's actually saying i know this is true firsthandedly since many of the comments are on heavenly or spiritual or godly issue jesus uses use jesus's use of verily verily is part of i love this consistent claim of deity he was not speaking as a man he was speaking as a as god he was the fullness of the godhead bodily so uh let me catch up to myself here i like the statement he says jesus is not merely aware of these truths he is the one who originated them the amen of god he in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god the bible says that all things were were for him and by him and without him nothing is made that is made so i'm just kind of finishing up here on this lexicon commentary he says the disciples and others listening to jesus so we're speaking from you know brother brown said it's an eastern book and if you want to know if you really want to understand then sometimes you need to know the eastern customs and so you know we inject this here that the disciples they understood what jesus was saying when he said verily verily when he said verily verily i say unto you the disciples were like okay this ain't this is not just a man speaking this is god himself and he has first-hand knowledge of what he's saying and so uh so the disciples understood the use of these phrases in exactly that way so when we read jesus's words and see statements beginning with verily or truly or some variation we should recall the deeper meaning that those claims are not only jesus's opinion on truth and and i and i i want to bring that down into our day that when brother branham is saying thus saith the lord or he's he's making an emphatic statement that you know he had firsthand knowledge that god spoke those words to him he knew that anointing in such an intimate way that he wasn't this wasn't brother brahms opinion on many things if it was he told you it was his opinion but when he comes forward with the word of god and makes those declarations uh you know concerning you know hair or dress or you know false doctrine or you know baptism or whatever the case might be he was bringing it from the from the from the point of the word that uh it wasn't just an opinion those are uh not just his opinion but those are his thoughts about which he has intimate personal first-hand knowledge and that last sentence is my own thought i injected there that at that moment he was bringing the thought to word so that when jesus is coming and he's and he's just speaking those letters and read in your new testament then then then that was the thoughts of god that already had existed for all eternity and now it was that season that time for that word to be to come from the thought process into the word process and then once the word is spoken then it has to come to pass amen and so uh we are blessed people in this day to see these things what's what's the cutoff moment time i got five okay from uh searches we we would see jesus brother brown says well that's what you should do that's right because the infallible word of god but did you ever try to ask god to make it manifest this is a and just take that thought right there that he's asking this question did you ever try to ask god to take the words that he spoke that he thought that he spoke in his bible and now make it real to you because the word it has to be materialized somewhere and so if he's the amen and you can amen the word watch what he says not just a historical christ but a risen christ now many people accept christ as their savior because well they're afraid of hell others are afraid to die without it but have you accepted him as your lord watch what he can do who can stand in the innermost part of you and open up the doors of your faith and just let you let yourself be in his hands i'm sure if you do he will punctuate every word in here with an amen why because he's the one that wrote it for it's his own spirit that wrote the bible is here to make it say amen because he is the ab the author of this bible so if you want the word to become real you have to pray you have to ask god lord let it become real you know i don't want to be a this isn't guesswork anymore i want reality we can't have uh you know intellectualism we can't have information we these things are good but we've got to have reality in the hour and time that we live jesus is giving us the description of himself in relation to the last age and so this is from the church age book and uh talk about the the the days of grace are winding up we're down into the 21st century uh told us about all the things concerning the ages and the characteristics to the last age to us he gives us one final look so here we are to the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen he gives us one final look at his own gracious and supreme deity and this is the capstone revelation of himself the supreme deity of jesus christ and him being the amen watch i want you to see the implications of what's going on here amen stands for the omega the last all right watch what it says here this is from the church age book where the man said it stands for approval it stands for prevailing promise and so if you look at the word prevailing there it means that it's a promise or the amen is here for a particular time that there's a current event there's modern events that are being made clear by prophecy and that this is uh having most appeal or influence or prevalent or relevant to the time to the age to the moment and so he is the amen so it's not he was the amen he is the amen so it stands for an unchanging promise hallelujah here is jehovah of the old testament the god of the amen here is jesus of the new testament the god of the amen hear o israel the lord thy god is one god and there it is again the jehovah of the old testament is the jesus of the new he is the god of the amen he never changes and what he does never changes he says it and stands fast he does it and it's done forever amen and none can take from what he says or add to it so let it be a man so let it be aren't you glad you serve that kind of a god it stands for the seal of god the amen stands for the seal of god so now then let us just extrapolate out what as brother braham said the evidence of the holy ghost is that you can amen every word of god amen it stands for uh it's something that you believe that god has put in there it's the holy spirit and god's holy spirit will what say amen to every word that's in the bible for it wrote the bible amen so how many times has the preacher ask you can you say amen well i'm here to give you a little insight to that that he's not asking you did you understand it he's asking you are you born again amen he's asking you are you full of the holy ghost can you say amen he's asking you have you been filled with that spirit that wrote the bible amen so amen means a whole lot more now than what it has ever meant before and brother jason and brother matt and the local preachers here they're going to really really they'll probably give me double offering for teaching you this amen why because they the preacher wants to hear you say amen not to vindicate himself but to vindicate you to finish for that you can hear yourself say amen i believe that i'm making what he's saying my own personal property i want to believe that i want it to be part of me i want to make it real to me i want the amen that wrote it i want him to come out of me and say amen to the word the word because he is the amen and so that so he's asking can you say amen he's not saying can you can you say yes i understand yes i believe you know yes i i'm in church i'm awake i'm vertical i'm taking nourishment no that's not what he's saying he's saying can you say can what's in you respond to the word of god in a positive way identifying what spirit is motivating you today let's stand our kind father we love you and we appreciate you today lord we just we want this word that we believe to become a living reality in our souls lord we pray for lord this revelation of this truth we see this final picture this last final identification that you gave to the ages and this is all they get there is no more and so lord we we want to amen our portion we want to amen the message of this last days with all that's in us that we can not just understand it but that we can become it that we can be the very manifestation of a thought that would became word that now has to become flesh let it be our flesh let it be you that lives in us and we'll be careful to praise you for it bless your children today bless the furtherings of the servants the service and we'll give you all the thanks and praise in jesus lovely name amen god bless you amen
