[0:00] All right. Uh, good to be in the house
[0:03] of the Lord tonight. We're running.

[0:19] invite you into our pres into the the
[0:21] the atmosphere, Lord, that you would
[0:24] come down and create your presence, that

[0:30] your word, Father. That we'd be edified.

[5:03] [Music]
[5:16] Jesus lifted me.
[5:21] Is that your testimony this evening?
[5:24] The name of Jesus lifted me. Somewhere
[5:28] along the line, Jesus had to come and
[5:30] say, "You're mine."
[5:33] That's going to happen in your life
[5:35] somewhere at some point and each one
[5:38] knows when it has or when it hasn't.
[5:41] We all want the has
[5:45] talked to my children many times.
[5:48] I've surrendered to Jesus
[5:51] and I look at James and says, "I show
[5:54] you my faith by my works." You know, and
[5:57] it's funny. Some people the works just
[5:59] go to church.
[6:01] Just live a Christian life.
[6:04] Amen. So, all I want to do be a simple,
[6:07] humble Christian.
[6:09] He'll take care of the rest. All the
[6:11] signs and the wonders. Do the Christian
[6:13] work first. Just live a Christian life.
[6:16] Signs follow.
[6:18] And I don't know why I'm going on, but
[6:20] praise the Lord. I love the Lord this
[6:21] evening.
[6:23] I love you. Also, someone told me a
[6:25] couple weeks ago, you said you love the
[6:28] Lord when you were praying, but you
[6:29] didn't say you loved us. I went back and
[6:31] I actually did. I did say it. So, there.
[6:35] Praise the Lord. If you can't love your
[6:37] brother or sister, how can you love
[6:38] Jesus whom you haven't seen? Amen. You
[6:41] love the Lord this evening. Amen. I love
[6:45] you, too. Let's pray.
[6:49] Father, I love you.
[6:51] I can look back at what I was, Father,
[6:54] before that precious day that's so
[6:57] precious in my heart, Father,
[7:00] where you came and you met me.
[7:03] Changed my life forever.
[7:06] I thank you for that.
[7:08] As we gather this evening, Lord, it's
[7:11] it's to give you honor, glory.
[7:15] May you be pleased with what you hear
[7:17] and what you see this evening.
[7:20] Lord, give us great comfort for it's a
[7:22] great day of darkness.
[7:25] Lord, we love you and we praise you. As
[7:28] we gather your tithes and your
[7:30] offerings, Father, bless the cheerful
[7:31] giver.
[7:33] Lord, bless the ministering of your
[7:34] word, the greatest form of worship.
[7:38] Bless your people, Father. And Lord, so
[7:42] thankful that you lifted me.
[7:45] You are sovereign in your revelation,
[7:47] Father.
[7:48] But we pray we hold that token dear to
[7:51] you, Father.
[7:53] Lord, that you would hear our hearts
[7:55] cry.
[7:57] Remember our children, our loved ones.
[7:59] Father, bless the tithes and offerings.
[8:01] Bless those that are streaming. Father,
[8:05] Lord, I don't want to forget anyone
[8:08] whether they're here or not.
[8:11] But I pray that your will would be done
[8:13] in our lives. Father, help me surrender
[8:16] more and more. I pray in Jesus Christ's
[8:19] name. Amen.

[26:04] Amen. Do you mean that tonight?
[26:07] Is that just a chorus? You came to
[26:09] church and started singing and everybody
[26:11] else was singing or are you thinking
[26:13] about it? Are you considering what
[26:15] you're saying? Is that really what you
[26:17] mean? You can have all this world, but
[26:19] give me Jesus. Think about that.
[26:22] I hope you're saying it because you you
[26:24] meant it, not just because
[26:27] it sounds nice.
[26:29] It does sound nice. It's wonderful. It's
[26:32] words of life.
[26:34] It's words to live by. Amen. Let's pray.
[26:37] Father, we we come before you, Lord, and
[26:40] we're so thankful for your grace and
[26:42] your mercy to us, Lord. We're so
[26:44] thankful that you've called us, Lord,
[26:47] and and delivered us into a revealed
[26:50] word, Lord, that changes and transforms
[26:53] our lives, that makes us new creatures
[26:56] in Christ, Lord, that it continually as
[26:59] we feed on it, makes makes us more and
[27:03] more into the image of Jesus Christ.
[27:06] That's what we're here for, Lord, is to
[27:08] be heuned into that image, Lord. To be
[27:11] made more like Christ and to have more
[27:13] of the the the manifestation of Christ
[27:17] on display in and through our lives.
[27:19] Lord, we ask that you would do that work
[27:22] in us. That you would be glorified and
[27:25] lifted up. Lord, help us all to move
[27:27] ourselves out of the way and let the
[27:29] Holy Spirit flow through us and
[27:31] accomplish your purpose. Father, we
[27:33] commit ourselves to you. We ask these
[27:36] things in the name of Jesus Christ.
[27:38] Amen. God bless you, saints.
[27:42] Good to be here tonight.
[27:45] I always miss it when I'm gone
[27:48] this last weekend and and traveling up
[27:50] to uh Dayton, Ohio. Uh ser services went
[27:54] well, but always like to be here at home
[27:57] with you all. So glad to be back and um
[28:01] going to be speaking on a subject that's
[28:03] going to kind of start a series
[28:05] um tonight
[28:08] uh called the gene of God.
[28:11] and
[28:13] and so there's probably three or four
[28:18] ser services that I'll need uh over who
[28:21] knows how long when I'll be done with it
[28:23] but
[28:25] um it's going to take me three or four
[28:26] services at least to do and I'm probably
[28:29] being very optimistic. So, um, with that
[28:33] said, let's turn in the scriptures to
[28:36] First John
[28:38] chapter 3,
[28:43] and we're going to look at verse 7.
[28:58] Then once I'm done with this, Ethan, if
[28:59] you want to pull up the PowerPoint.
[29:02] Little children, let no man deceive you.
[29:06] He that doeth righteousness is
[29:08] righteous, even as he is righteous. He
[29:12] that committh sin is of the devil. For
[29:15] the devil sinnth from the beginning. For
[29:18] this purpose the Son of God was
[29:20] manifested, that he might destroy the
[29:22] works of the devil.
[29:24] Whosoever is born of God doth not commit
[29:27] sin, for his seed remainth in him, and
[29:31] he cannot sin
[29:33] because he is born of God. In this the
[29:38] children of God are manifest, and the
[29:40] children of the devil, whosoever doeth
[29:42] not righteousness is not of God, neither
[29:45] he that loveth not his brother. Amen.
[29:49] May the Lord add the blessing to the
[29:51] reading of his word.
[29:53] And so you can be seated.
[29:59] So looking at the gene of God, we're
[30:02] going to look at the nature of man's
[30:05] life and its source as well as
[30:08] immortality.
[30:10] And then we're going to look at the
[30:11] injection of death and destruction
[30:14] that came as a result of sin. Then I
[30:17] want to relate that all of that back to
[30:19] election and the genetics of the human
[30:22] race and the gu from the garden of Eden
[30:24] all the way to the new Jerusalem.
[30:27] So that was our scripture we read there
[30:31] 1 John 3. And if you look at it and
[30:33] study it closely it's bringing a
[30:36] comparison between
[30:39] the children of God and the children of
[30:41] the devil. Right? And so here we have
[30:44] the children of God. They don't commit
[30:46] sin.
[30:48] Now raise your hand if you've never
[30:50] sinned in your whole life.
[30:52] Somebody laughed.
[30:54] And Luther raised his hand and he's
[30:56] looking to the blood. Amen.
[31:00] But each of us are are born in what?
[31:04] We're born in sin, shaped in iniquity.
[31:07] We came into the world speaking lies.
[31:09] We're born with a sin nature. We were
[31:11] born walking and living in unbelief.
[31:14] Right? That's what that's what sin is.
[31:16] Sin is unbelief. And then we had the
[31:19] attributes of that unbelief manifested
[31:22] in our life. Lying, drinking, smoking,
[31:25] adultery, what choose whatever direction
[31:28] you you you you went to. Even if you
[31:31] looked partially good, you're still born
[31:35] in sin shaped in iniquity, you're dead.
[31:39] And you need to be quickened by the
[31:41] spirit of God. And so none of us are in
[31:44] this condition from the moment that
[31:45] we're born. However, if we're looking at
[31:48] it, we're looking at the results, right?
[31:51] That's what we're looking to. And I
[31:52] don't want to I don't want to jump way
[31:54] way far ahead of myself in this topic,
[31:56] but I'm I'm bringing the end right here
[32:00] at the beginning. And so you're you're
[32:02] you could see where I'm going with this
[32:04] as we go. The two strains, the two
[32:07] streams, all based on election.
[32:10] Yeah. Though th though the Bible speaks
[32:13] clearly that we sin but it it never says
[32:16] that you are of the devil.
[32:20] It it makes that distinction but it says
[32:22] we are walking after the works of the
[32:26] devil.
[32:28] Sons and daughters of God definitely
[32:30] we're born in in the condition that we
[32:34] do walk after the works. But you don't
[32:36] go from being a hog to a sheep. You do
[32:40] have a nature change. Yes. But if you're
[32:43] a sheep, you're a sheep,
[32:44] right?
[32:45] You you're you're you might have been
[32:46] dirty and rotten and doing all the works
[32:48] that a pig would do was doing, but you
[32:50] are a l one of one of his lambs. You
[32:55] know, the scripture says because you are
[32:56] sons, he sends forth the spirit of his
[33:00] son into your heart. If you're not sons,
[33:02] then the spirit of the his son, it can't
[33:04] come into your heart. It's not
[33:06] compatible. Though you were born and you
[33:09] were walking after the prince of the
[33:11] power of the air, but you weren't of the
[33:13] prince of the power of the air. You just
[33:15] had a nature within you that came by
[33:18] hybridization that was in your life,
[33:20] injected into the human race, put pushed
[33:23] forward in you. But when the word of God
[33:25] came, there was something there that
[33:28] could respond. It was God's grace
[33:30] calling you, opening your heart,
[33:33] revealing himself to you so that when
[33:35] the spirit of God began acting and
[33:37] moving actively to save you, you could
[33:41] surrender.
[33:42] Amen.
[33:43] Not apart from his grace, not on your
[33:45] own,
[33:46] but by election, he works to open your
[33:49] heart and change you. Right?
[33:54] And so that's where we're that's where
[33:56] we're going with this.
[34:03] So let's start. We're going to look at
[34:04] life and immortality.
[34:06] Second Timothy
[34:09] 1 vers9.
[34:12] Who has saved us and called us with a
[34:13] holy calling, not according to our
[34:16] works, but according to his own purpose
[34:20] and grace. Amen. It's not according to
[34:22] what we've done. It's not according to
[34:25] you're a good person. You're doing good
[34:27] works. All your good works are
[34:30] filthiness in God's sight.
[34:33] Amen.
[34:34] It was it was according to his own
[34:36] purpose and grace
[34:38] that he called us which was given us in
[34:41] Christ Jesus before the last revival.
[34:44] Amen.
[34:47] Before the world began.
[34:50] So that purpose and grace was there for
[34:53] all eternity.
[34:55] before the world ever began.
[34:57] Amen.
[34:58] And so it was God who saved us. It was
[35:00] he who called us to that holy calling,
[35:04] but is now made manifest
[35:07] by the appearing of our savior Jesus
[35:10] Christ.
[35:11] Look what Jesus did. We saw that he came
[35:13] to destroy the works of the devil. In
[35:15] the scripture we read, it says he
[35:17] abolished death. Wait a minute. Why are
[35:20] we all still corrupting and dying and
[35:23] our family members are are still dying?
[35:26] Yeah.
[35:28] Doesn't matter what what we see here. He
[35:30] has he has done the work to abolish
[35:33] death.
[35:34] He died on the on the cross. He rose
[35:37] again. He he took the keys of death and
[35:39] hell. Death has no more power over us.
[35:43] It has no no more victory over us
[35:45] because Christ raised from the dead.
[35:47] Because he raised from the dead, we will
[35:49] raise too.
[35:50] Amen.
[35:50] He's already abolished death.
[35:52] Can you say amen?
[35:53] Can can we live like that on a daily
[35:56] basis and not be in fear of all these
[35:58] things? A death has already been
[36:00] abolished. Why are we afraid? Why are we
[36:02] worried?
[36:04] And not only abolished death, but he has
[36:07] brought life and immortality to light
[36:11] through the gospel.
[36:14] So it is through the death, burial and
[36:16] resurrection of Jesus Christ. And that's
[36:19] what everybody says, but they leave out
[36:21] the last part which is the part where it
[36:23] gets applied to us which is the baptism
[36:25] of the Holy Ghost by the new birth.
[36:28] Amen.
[36:28] That's that is the gospel. You can you
[36:31] can talk about the gospel and say I
[36:33] believe the gospel all day, all night,
[36:35] all your life, but until it's been
[36:37] applied by the baptism of the Holy
[36:39] Ghost, it doesn't bring any effect to
[36:42] you.
[36:42] Amen. I believe the gospel. Satan
[36:45] believes the gospel also, but you don't
[36:46] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[36:49] So, you want the death, burial, and
[36:51] resurrection effectively applied to your
[36:53] life. Have you received the Holy Ghost
[36:56] since you believed?
[36:58] That's the question. You have to answer
[36:59] for yourself. I can't answer it for you.
[37:02] Young people, your parents can't answer
[37:04] it for you.
[37:05] You, between you and God, you have to
[37:08] know the answer to that question. Have I
[37:11] received the Holy Ghost since you
[37:13] believed?
[37:14] That's good. You started out right. You
[37:16] believed, but you got to continue and
[37:19] get the application of that belief for
[37:22] yourself.
[37:24] Amen.
[37:25] So through the gospel, we see life and
[37:30] immortality brought to light. In other
[37:32] words, life and immortality was once a
[37:34] hidden mystery. Mhm.
[37:36] Life and immortality. They had an idea
[37:38] of how it would come, but they had they
[37:41] didn't have the full fullness of the
[37:43] understanding. Different prophets, Job,
[37:46] Isaiah, different ones spoke about that.
[37:50] But really, it was never fully brought
[37:52] to light until Christ came and sent his
[37:56] apostle, the Apostle Paul.
[37:58] He's the one that made it clear.
[38:00] Amen. Jesus spoke about it, but if you
[38:02] read what Jesus said, you think there's
[38:04] just a general resurrection and the the
[38:05] the the good the righteous and the
[38:08] unrighteous will be raised up at the
[38:09] same time. There'll be judgment and you
[38:11] go in. But no, Paul gives the
[38:13] revelation. He he brings forward the
[38:15] hidden mystery
[38:17] that was that was there planted in the
[38:19] scripture to say, "Hey, there's there's
[38:21] there's different aspects of this
[38:23] resurrection." And there's a there's a
[38:25] people that are going to be alive on
[38:26] earth
[38:28] that are going to be changed and there's
[38:30] going to be people that are dead that'll
[38:32] be raised up and these pe these people
[38:34] will go and meet the Lord in the air.
[38:37] Only that group.
[38:39] See, these things weren't known,
[38:41] right?
[38:42] That wasn't understood. That was a
[38:43] hidden mystery in the Old Testament and
[38:46] it was revealed by Jesus Christ. Isn't
[38:49] it interesting that you say, "Well, I'm
[38:51] going to take what Jesus Christ said."
[38:54] Okay, that's what people will tell you.
[38:56] I'll take it over the apostles. You
[38:58] You're just a liar. That's what you are.
[39:02] Amen. Because you cannot there's there's
[39:06] no way you can go to the scripture and
[39:08] say, "Well, Jesus Christ abolished death
[39:10] and brought life and immortality to
[39:12] light through the gospel." 100% true.
[39:14] But remember that the revelation of the
[39:16] mystery didn't even come through the 12
[39:18] disciples that were with him.
[39:20] Uhhuh.
[39:20] It came through an apostle that was out
[39:23] of due season.
[39:25] Born out of due season. He he he was
[39:27] called. He was anointed. He was sent
[39:30] with a message apart from and separate
[39:33] and distinct from all of those
[39:35] 11 apostles.
[39:37] Yeah.
[39:38] And so these again, these are important
[39:40] points. If you for fast forward from the
[39:42] first church age to the seventh church
[39:44] age, one born out of due season,
[39:47] not under the Pentecostal revival,
[39:48] Elijah,
[39:50] man in the spirit of Elijah to to
[39:52] restore us back to these hidden
[39:54] mysteries.
[39:55] Yeah.
[39:57] That Paul brought out. Man, if I preach
[39:59] like this, it's going to take 17
[40:01] services to go through it.
[40:05] So, so the point I'm trying to bring out
[40:08] here and and and show is God by
[40:12] revelation has made known to us this
[40:16] understanding, right, of life and
[40:19] immortality.
[40:20] Amen.
[40:21] And so it was it was hidden now by the
[40:24] gospel. We know what it is. G Jesus life
[40:28] acted it out. Paul revealed what it was
[40:32] in detail
[40:34] and then those things got left off
[40:36] hidden and then the seventh church age
[40:38] messenger
[40:40] brought us back to what Paul unveiled.
[40:48] So let's go to the beginning. And the
[40:50] Lord God commanded this is Genesis
[40:51] 2:16-1 17.
[40:54] He commanded the man, saying, "Of every
[40:56] tree of the garden, thou mayest freely
[40:58] eat." And I'm really going to try hard
[41:00] not to get stuck on serpent seed when
[41:02] I'm going through this, but you never
[41:03] know what happens.
[41:06] Of every tree of the garden, thou mayest
[41:08] freely eat. But of the tree of the
[41:09] knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
[41:12] not eat of it. For in the day thou
[41:15] eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.
[41:18] So this is the that's the point that I
[41:19] want to get to is this is the
[41:21] punishment.
[41:22] Yeah. death,
[41:24] right?
[41:25] That is what if you sin, you're going to
[41:28] die.
[41:30] It didn't say if you sin, you're going
[41:32] to burn in hell for eternity.
[41:35] The punishment is death.
[41:37] Amen.
[41:38] God is removing immortality.
[41:45] So, Adam
[41:47] was created with immortality,
[41:52] right?
[41:53] He was only subject to death if he ate
[41:55] of the tree of the knowledge of good and
[41:56] evil.
[41:58] Again, it's not eternal conscious
[42:00] punishment being tormented in a burning
[42:03] hell. It says, "The day you eat thereof,
[42:07] that day you will die."
[42:10] Amen.
[42:17] So Adam ate of the tree. They both ate
[42:19] of the tree of the knowledge of good and
[42:21] evil.
[42:22] And this resulted in inherited death and
[42:25] inherited sin nature for the human race
[42:30] and as a result inherited condemnation.
[42:34] Yes.
[42:39] Let's look at some of the scriptures
[42:41] speak about that.
[42:44] 1 Corinthians 15
[42:47] 21 and 22. For since by man came death,
[42:51] by man came also the resurrection of the
[42:54] dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in
[42:58] Christ shall all be made alive.
[43:02] Amen.
[43:02] Amen.
[43:06] Romans 5:12, wherefore as by one man sin
[43:10] entered the into the world and death by
[43:14] sin and so death passed upon all men for
[43:18] that all have sinned. Right? So they're
[43:23] they're saying they're he he's bringing
[43:25] this together. All have sinned and
[43:28] receive condemnation, but they all sin
[43:31] because they were in Adam and sin passed
[43:34] into him. So death comes to us,
[43:37] condemnation comes to us because we are
[43:40] bound to come to that sin
[43:43] no matter what. We have that nature.
[43:48] Romans 15:16-19.
[43:52] Whenever I'm making the PowerPoints, I
[43:53] always struggle to know if everybody's
[43:55] going to be able to see it. So I hope I
[43:57] hope it's all right for
[44:00] most of you. If you're aged like brother
[44:03] Luther,
[44:06] he might have to move up to the front.
[44:12] Romans 5:16-19.
[44:15] And not as it was by one that sinned, so
[44:18] is the gift. For the judgment was by one
[44:21] to condemnation. You see that right
[44:23] there? The judgment was on Adam. And the
[44:27] result for you and I that come from Adam
[44:30] is condemnation.
[44:31] Yeah.
[44:33] So in other words, Adam is the head was
[44:38] is the head the original head of all
[44:40] mankind.
[44:41] And when he sinned, we sinned in him.
[44:45] And so sin was imputed from Adam to us.
[44:52] Right.
[44:52] But not only sin, a sin nature.
[44:55] Sure.
[44:56] and uh and the condemnation that comes
[44:59] with it.
[45:01] What is the condemnation? Death. We're
[45:03] all condemned to die.
[45:04] Yeah.
[45:05] Even if you never even reach the age of
[45:07] accountability as a baby, you're still
[45:08] going to you'll you can die before you
[45:10] reach the age of accountability because
[45:13] that is imputed to you. Mhm.
[45:16] For if by one man's offense death reign
[45:19] by one,
[45:21] much more they which receive abundance
[45:23] of grace and of the gift of
[45:24] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[45:27] Jesus Christ. Now this is where
[45:30] universalists take this and isolated
[45:33] against the rest of the scripture. They
[45:34] say, "See, everyone was in Adam died."
[45:39] And so, everyone that's in Jesus Christ
[45:42] will be made alive whether they know it
[45:44] or not because it it wasn't whether Adam
[45:48] you you didn't know what happened. It
[45:49] was just imputed to you. So Jesus became
[45:52] the replacement head of mankind. And
[45:55] because of that, everybody's saved
[45:58] regardless of what that's what the
[46:00] church down the road on Ladies Island,
[46:02] that's what they believe in, the
[46:03] universalists,
[46:05] and that's what they think. But of
[46:07] course, you have to throw away the rest
[46:09] of the Bible. Amen.
[46:14] And of course, maybe if you didn't
[46:17] understand serpent seed and how that
[46:19] interacts with predestination, then you
[46:22] might come to that understanding,
[46:24] incorrect understanding.
[46:32] Where did I quit?
[46:35] I knew I didn't finish that. Therefore,
[46:36] as by the offense of one, judgment came
[46:39] upon all men to condemnation. Even so,
[46:42] by the righteousness of one, the free
[46:44] gift came upon all men unto
[46:46] justification of life. It says all men,
[46:49] everyone saved. I've talked to people
[46:52] that's that's their line of reasoning.
[46:54] Okay, fantastic. So, let's read the rest
[46:56] of the Bible.
[46:57] What about the fellow that lifted up his
[46:59] eyes in hell? Was he saved?
[47:07] For as by one man's disobedience many
[47:10] were made sinners, so by the obedience
[47:14] of one shall many be made righteous.
[47:17] Paul is trying to point out
[47:23] imputate imputed
[47:25] sin, imputed righteousness. You know
[47:28] what imputation means? It means to take
[47:31] what's what belongs to someone else and
[47:33] put it on someone else. If just like
[47:35] Christ, he he was righteous and by faith
[47:38] we receive him. We we receive his
[47:40] righteousness.
[47:42] Right.
[47:42] Right. When Adam sinned, we receive
[47:45] everything that he got.
[47:48] Everything that Adam got because Adam's
[47:49] the head of the human race.
[47:51] Amen. So everything that Adam did and
[47:53] got, we we are the we are the
[47:56] beneficiaries of
[47:57] which I don't want to be the
[47:58] beneficiaries of that. But we have no
[48:00] choice. That's what that's the condition
[48:02] we're born in.
[48:03] But thank God another one came. God made
[48:05] a plan of redemption. He replaced Adam
[48:08] with a new head
[48:10] of of the elected seed of God
[48:14] so that we in him would be made
[48:16] righteous. Not because of anything we've
[48:18] done. We're it's already done. As
[48:20] brother Luther raised his hand, I've
[48:22] never sinned one day in my life. No, not
[48:24] because of me, but because of what God
[48:26] has declared over me through Jesus
[48:29] Christ. That's been imputed to you. It's
[48:31] on It's already on your account. It was
[48:34] on your account long before you were a
[48:36] twinkle in your mom and dad's eye.
[48:43] So here we see also
[48:47] um in addition, you know, when we're
[48:49] looking at this and we're talking about
[48:52] death being the punishment,
[48:54] uh we're not trying to say there's no
[48:56] such thing as a literal hell or a lit
[49:00] literal place of punishment that a
[49:03] person goes to when they die. You know,
[49:06] in in some uh understanding, the people
[49:09] believe that when you die, your soul
[49:11] goes to sleep. Whether you're righteous
[49:14] or unrighteous, your soul goes to sleep,
[49:17] and you're just awaiting the
[49:19] resurrection, and then some will be
[49:23] thrown into the lake of fire, which is a
[49:25] second death, and they die, go out of
[49:26] existence, and then the others will come
[49:29] be raised to life. some some different
[49:32] denominations even Martin Luther believe
[49:34] that after a sort um soul sleep some
[49:37] some Presbyterians and John Calvin and
[49:40] different ones had that understanding
[49:43] but you we can't get to that
[49:44] understanding from scripture see in the
[49:47] Old Testament there's scriptures that
[49:49] you can read and you might think you
[49:51] know I will I praise you when I'm in the
[49:53] grave David says that and there's other
[49:55] scriptures that you could read and say
[49:57] oh I must sleep when I when I when I
[50:00] Why? I must I must uh just go to sleep
[50:03] and there's nothing and I don't know
[50:06] anything. Even Job alludes to something
[50:08] like this as well. But it's because life
[50:12] and immortality was a mystery to them.
[50:14] They didn't h have a full understanding.
[50:17] They had a partial understanding.
[50:18] Certainly the body goes to sleep and for
[50:21] from the perspective of the living, the
[50:23] dead's not doing nothing.
[50:25] But that's not go from God's
[50:27] perspective. Right.
[50:29] And so we we understand uh from
[50:32] scripture that in the Old Testament days
[50:34] under that dispensation from Adam all
[50:37] the way to Christ that there was two
[50:40] sections of what we call the grave or um
[50:47] of uh uh one was called paradise. That's
[50:50] where the righteous went to. This was in
[50:51] the in the heart of the earth. The Bible
[50:54] speaks of that. And one section was
[50:56] torment.
[50:58] This was there when Christ raised from
[51:00] the dead. Those people that were in many
[51:03] of the dead, many of them that slept
[51:06] raised up
[51:07] with Christ at the resurrection. Says he
[51:09] led captivity captive, gave gifts up to
[51:11] men. He he took them with him. When he
[51:14] went when he ascended to heaven, those
[51:16] saints that slept ascended up to heaven
[51:21] with him. That paradise emptied out. The
[51:23] prophet says,
[51:24] "Yeah,
[51:25] and they they went there, but hell
[51:27] didn't. The place of torment didn't.
[51:30] Those people are still there." So, let's
[51:32] read that. Luke
[51:34] 16 19-23.
[51:37] There was a certain rich man which was
[51:39] clothed in purple and fine linen, and
[51:41] fair fared sumptuously every day. Then
[51:44] there was a certain beggar named
[51:45] Lazarus, which laid at his gate full of
[51:48] sores,
[51:50] and desiring to be fed with the crumbs
[51:52] which fell from the rich man's table.
[51:54] Moreover, the dogs came and licked his
[51:56] soores.
[51:58] And it came to pass that the beggar died
[51:59] and was carried by the angels into
[52:02] Abraham's bosom. See, this is that
[52:04] section of in the in the heart of the
[52:07] earth called paradise or Abraham's
[52:09] bosom.
[52:10] Amen.
[52:11] The rich man also died and was buried.
[52:14] And in hell he lift up his eyes being in
[52:17] torments and seeth Abraham a far off and
[52:21] Lazarus in his bosom. So somehow
[52:25] this man, this rich man in hell is able
[52:28] to see across this gulf and see what the
[52:32] Can you imagine the torment
[52:34] being in hell and looking across and
[52:37] seeing someone just relaxing with
[52:40] Abraham
[52:43] just enjoying himself
[52:46] and he's there in hell being in torment.
[52:50] This is a real place.
[52:52] They don't want you to preach about hell
[52:54] anymore in this this day and age.
[52:56] But this is hell. This is the punishment
[52:58] that a person's get if their blood if
[53:00] their sins are not covered by the blood
[53:03] of Jesus Christ.
[53:04] Amen.
[53:05] If this is what people people that say,
[53:07] "I want to get what I deserve." This is
[53:10] what they get. This is what they
[53:12] deserve. Being in torment.
[53:21] And he cried and said, "Father Abraham,
[53:24] have mercy on me and send Lazarus that
[53:27] he may dip the tip of his finger in
[53:30] water and cool my tongue, for I am
[53:34] tormented in this flame." So, this is a
[53:37] man, he's in hell, and he has a memory
[53:40] of his life on earth.
[53:42] He remembers what happened on Earth. And
[53:46] um Siri, you found something on the web.
[53:48] Congratulations.
[53:49] Um,
[53:52] usually usually Siri tells me she
[53:54] doesn't understand. So,
[53:58] sorry Siri, it takes a revelation.
[54:03] So So
[54:06] here he has a memory of his life on
[54:09] earth. He sees a man that he knew
[54:13] uh enjoying himself.
[54:14] Yeah. Amen. And he says, "Dip, please
[54:18] have have mercy on me. Dip the tip of
[54:20] his finger in water and cool my tongue,
[54:22] for I am tormented in this flame."
[54:26] But Abraham said, "Son, remember that
[54:29] thou in thy lifetime receivest thy thy
[54:31] good things, and likewise Lazarus evil
[54:34] things. But now he is comforted, and
[54:36] thou art tormented."
[54:39] And besides all this, between us and you
[54:41] there is a great gulf fixed, so that
[54:43] they which would pass from hence to you
[54:45] cannot, neither can they pass to us that
[54:48] would come from thence. Then he said, I
[54:50] I pray thee therefore, father, that thou
[54:53] wouldest send him to my father's house.
[54:55] Now you see a man in hell realizing
[54:58] there's no hope for him.
[55:01] So he says, please help my family.
[55:03] So he has memory of himself. He has
[55:07] memory of his relation to his family and
[55:10] even has a desire deliver that my family
[55:14] from this torment because they're on the
[55:17] same road that I wound up in this place
[55:20] on.
[55:21] Amen.
[55:25] For I have five brethren that they he
[55:27] may testify unto them, lest they also
[55:30] come into this place of torment. Abraham
[55:33] saith unto him, they have Moses and the
[55:34] prophets. let them hear them. And he
[55:37] said, "Nay, Father Abraham, but if one
[55:38] went unto them from the dead, they will
[55:40] repent." And he said unto him, "If they
[55:42] hear not Moses and the prophets, neither
[55:44] will they be persuaded, though one rose
[55:46] from the dead."
[55:49] If the word has no impact on you,
[55:52] a supernatural
[55:54] uh vindication is also not going to have
[55:57] any impact on you.
[55:58] That's right. Amen.
[55:59] They have the word. What did G what did
[56:01] what was said? They have the word.
[56:03] Yeah. They can read this in the word
[56:06] that
[56:06] there's a synagogue down the road. They
[56:08] can listen to it. And if they believe
[56:10] that,
[56:12] they'll enter into paradise,
[56:14] but if they keep living the way they are
[56:16] and refuse to repent, they will end up
[56:18] in torment. And so will you.
[56:21] If you don't repent
[56:23] and give your life completely to Christ
[56:26] and be fully covered by the blood of
[56:29] Jesus Christ and filled with the Holy
[56:31] Ghost, same results. Yeah.
[56:34] Same results. We You have the word.
[56:37] You heard the word preached.
[56:39] Even if someone's raised from the dead
[56:40] and comes testifies to you, supernatural
[56:42] things happen at this church all the
[56:44] time.
[56:44] If that has If the word don't have
[56:46] impact, that's not going to have any
[56:47] impact either.
[56:49] Let the word that's being proclaimed
[56:51] have its impact. Respond to it.
[56:54] Repent.
[56:55] Give your soul to God.
[56:57] Amen.
[56:57] Otherwise,
[57:00] torment.
[57:01] Amen.
[57:06] So as we read there in scripture,
[57:09] there's certainly a place of punishment.
[57:14] But
[57:16] nevertheless, that never changes the
[57:18] fact that the final punishment for sin
[57:21] is ultimately death.
[57:24] And death and hell will be cast into the
[57:27] lake of fire. This is the second death.
[57:33] The picture that the orthodox
[57:34] theological world gives you is that all
[57:36] souls are immortal.
[57:39] All souls have eternal life and they
[57:41] will be around for all eternity.
[57:44] The soul will either go to hell in
[57:46] conscious torment for all of eternity or
[57:48] the soul will go into paradise for all
[57:51] eternity.
[57:54] But this is not the picture that the
[57:56] Bible gives us. That's right.
[58:01] And I I have no desire
[58:03] to lessen the impact of the fact that
[58:07] hell is a place of torment
[58:09] and it's a place that no one wants to
[58:11] end up at.
[58:12] Amen.
[58:13] Nevertheless, the soul will certainly
[58:17] be annihilated.
[58:19] If you don't have etern there's only one
[58:21] form of eternal life. If you don't have
[58:23] that eternal life dwelling in you from
[58:26] that the very life of God, then you ca
[58:30] you cannot continue to exist for all of
[58:33] eternity. You will go out of ex
[58:35] existence, but you will be punished
[58:37] according to your works. Scriptur is
[58:39] very clear on that. The devil will be
[58:41] punished for millions or billions a
[58:43] year. The prophet says
[58:47] other people will be punished for I
[58:48] don't know how long. God is a just God.
[58:51] Yeah. He He gives an eye for an eye. He
[58:54] will punish you according to your works.
[58:56] But but don't think, well, I was a
[58:59] really good person. I'll only spend 13
[59:02] minutes in hell. I don't want to spend
[59:04] any time
[59:06] in torment,
[59:08] right?
[59:09] Amen.
[59:10] Why Why would you Why would you do that
[59:12] when God is offering mercy? Every
[59:14] Wednesday and Sunday, every Thursday,
[59:16] every Friday, every sat, every day, God
[59:19] is continually If you're still here on
[59:22] earth,
[59:22] he's offering you mercy.
[59:24] Did the sun rise?
[59:27] Did your car start? Could you eat some
[59:30] food?
[59:30] Yeah.
[59:32] Did it rain? Did it rain on the plants?
[59:37] Oh, did you breathe air? Amen.
[59:39] Yeah.
[59:40] Then God is showing mercy. So respond to
[59:43] him.
[59:44] Yeah.
[59:45] Before it's too late.
[59:50] So
[59:53] one thing that you see, and I'm sorry if
[59:55] that's hard to read.
[59:59] Does does all mankind have an immortal
[1:00:03] soul?
[1:00:04] So let's look at scriptures. There's two
[1:00:06] words used to speak of immortality in
[1:00:09] the Greek New Testament. One is
[1:00:12] speaking of undeaying and the other is
[1:00:14] speaking of deathlessness.
[1:00:16] Here's the first one. Aparos Aparosia
[1:00:21] means unccorruptability or unending
[1:00:24] existence.
[1:00:27] Romans 2:7.
[1:00:29] to them who by patient continuence in
[1:00:32] welloing seek for glory and honor and
[1:00:36] immortality
[1:00:38] eternal life. Then 1 Corinthians 15:53,
[1:00:42] for this corruptible must put on
[1:00:45] incorruption, and this mortal must put
[1:00:48] on immortality. So you see in 53 it has
[1:00:51] the two two ver in the same verse, it
[1:00:54] has the two different words that are
[1:00:56] translated as immortal right in it.
[1:01:02] So the mortal must put on immortality.
[1:01:04] It doesn't say the mortal is immortal.
[1:01:07] Says the mortal has to put on
[1:01:10] immortality. The corruptible must put on
[1:01:13] incorruption. Romans 2 says for those
[1:01:16] who by patient continuence in welloing
[1:01:21] seek glory and honor and immortality. It
[1:01:24] doesn't say they're de facto immortal.
[1:01:30] Again, it's easy for the Christian world
[1:01:33] and theologians to come up with
[1:01:36] doctrines apart from scripture. Oh man,
[1:01:39] they come up, they write huge books on
[1:01:43] systematic theology showing that there's
[1:01:46] immortal souls and they speak about this
[1:01:49] and talk about this, but it's not a
[1:01:51] scriptural even scriptural terminology.
[1:01:55] 1 Corinthians 15:54.
[1:01:58] So when this corruptible shall have put
[1:01:59] on incorruption, and this mortal shall
[1:02:02] have put on immortality, then shall be
[1:02:04] brought to pass the saying that is
[1:02:06] written, death is swallowed up in
[1:02:07] victory. Verse 52 is another one. In a
[1:02:10] moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at
[1:02:12] the last trump, for the trumpet shall
[1:02:14] sound, and the dead shall be raised
[1:02:16] incorruptible.
[1:02:18] 1 Peter 1:4 to an inheritance
[1:02:20] incorruptible and undefiled and that
[1:02:23] fadeth not away reserved in heaven for
[1:02:27] you.
[1:02:30] Then here's that other word that's used.
[1:02:32] Athartos
[1:02:34] means undecaying, being born again, not
[1:02:37] of corruptible seed, but of
[1:02:39] incorruptible by the word of God, which
[1:02:42] liveth and abideth forever. Never is the
[1:02:46] terminology immortal or incorruptible
[1:02:49] applied to the state of a condemned
[1:02:52] sinner.
[1:02:54] It's never used in reference to a to a
[1:02:56] sinner.
[1:03:00] First Timothy,
[1:03:02] did I just stay in one place and keep
[1:03:03] going?
[1:03:05] Can we I wish we
[1:03:08] brain keep working.
[1:03:11] All right.
[1:03:16] 1 Timothy 6:16,
[1:03:19] "Who only soul, single, alone,
[1:03:23] hath immortality, dwelling in the light
[1:03:25] which no man can approach unto, whom no
[1:03:28] man has seen, nor can see, to whom be
[1:03:30] honor and power everlasting." So God
[1:03:33] alone has immortality.
[1:03:36] God alone has eternal life.
[1:03:43] John 5:26, "For as the Father hath life
[1:03:45] in himself."
[1:03:48] Keep up, Dears,
[1:03:52] Ethan, you can help me out back there,
[1:03:54] too.
[1:03:57] For as the Father hath life in himself,
[1:03:59] so hath he given to the Son to have life
[1:04:02] in himself. So God has eternal life. He
[1:04:05] places that life in his son.
[1:04:08] 1 John 5:12, he that hath the son hath
[1:04:11] life. Now, if you have the son, you have
[1:04:14] that immortal eternal life.
[1:04:17] Amen.
[1:04:18] He that hath not the son of God has not
[1:04:21] that immortal eternal life.
[1:04:28] Immortal, as we've we as we've just
[1:04:31] said, you can relate immortality back to
[1:04:34] eternal life.
[1:04:35] Yeah. For God so loved the world that he
[1:04:38] gave his only begotten son that
[1:04:39] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:04:41] perish but have everlasting life.
[1:04:48] So again, it's a gift.
[1:04:51] This is a gift. For the wages of sin is
[1:04:53] death, but the gift of God is eternal
[1:04:56] life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[1:04:59] Eternal life, immortality is a gift from
[1:05:03] God. Amen.
[1:05:07] It's not the default for every human
[1:05:09] being that's born.
[1:05:13] It's a gift.
[1:05:17] Brother Brandham says, "Everything,"
[1:05:19] this is in thirsting for life, 1957,
[1:05:22] "Everything that has a beginning has an
[1:05:24] end, and it's things that has no
[1:05:25] beginning that has no end. And there's
[1:05:27] only one eternal life, that's in God."
[1:05:30] Amen.
[1:05:31] All other life has an end.
[1:05:33] Amen. But God has no end because he has
[1:05:35] no beginning. And we being parts of God
[1:05:38] have eternal life with God. But
[1:05:40] everything that has any other type of
[1:05:42] life had a beginning. It has an end.
[1:05:45] Only eternal things laugh
[1:05:48] last. Now the word forever comes in a
[1:05:51] conjunction forever and forever. Forever
[1:05:53] is a space of time. But eternity is no
[1:05:56] begin or or end.
[1:05:59] It's just a perfect circle. There's no
[1:06:01] end in it at all. It's eternity forever.
[1:06:04] Like you see forever and conjunction
[1:06:06] forever, two spaces of time. But
[1:06:08] eternity and eternal life means the same
[1:06:11] thing. See, it's in the same category
[1:06:12] that it had no begin, neither does it
[1:06:15] have an end. It's forever the same, ever
[1:06:18] was and ever will be the same.
[1:06:21] Amen.
[1:06:24] So the English definition that brother
[1:06:25] Brandham applied to eternal is no
[1:06:28] beginning and no ending.
[1:06:32] See, he says the word eternal means
[1:06:34] eternity, which had no begin, has no
[1:06:36] end. So, let's examine.
[1:06:40] See, we're at 8:15.
[1:06:42] We're going to try to make it to the end
[1:06:45] of examining
[1:06:47] the words that are translated as eternal
[1:06:52] in the New Testament. So, there's two
[1:06:54] different words. We're going to look at
[1:06:56] those. We're going to look at every
[1:06:57] instance in the New Testament and we're
[1:07:00] going to translate it as though it me is
[1:07:03] it means eternal every single time. So
[1:07:05] you're going to see how absurd that is.
[1:07:13] Here is ion.
[1:07:16] It means properly an age. Notice that's
[1:07:19] the very first definition that they
[1:07:20] gives here. properly in age
[1:07:24] by extension perpetuity by implication
[1:07:28] the world specifically Jewish a
[1:07:31] messianic period present or future and
[1:07:34] then then they go on to list each way
[1:07:36] that it's translated in the Greek New
[1:07:39] Testament age course eternal forever
[1:07:42] more
[1:07:44] beginning of the while the world began
[1:07:48] without end okay So,
[1:07:51] how can it be all of those things at the
[1:07:53] same time? Seems strange.
[1:07:57] They're they're they're all completely
[1:07:58] different meanings.
[1:08:01] So, let's look at it. Colossians 1:26.
[1:08:04] Even the mystery which hath been hid
[1:08:05] from ages and from generations, but now
[1:08:08] is made manifest to his saints. Even the
[1:08:11] mystery which has been hid from
[1:08:12] eternity.
[1:08:15] Does that make sense?
[1:08:16] The mystery was hid from eternity. know
[1:08:18] the ages. This is the word ion from ages
[1:08:22] and generations. Both these words have
[1:08:25] reference to a period of time.
[1:08:28] Ephesians 1:21 far above all
[1:08:30] principality and power and might and
[1:08:33] dominion in every name that is named not
[1:08:36] only in this eternity but also in that
[1:08:37] which is to come.
[1:08:40] doesn't make sense in this world or you
[1:08:42] could say in this age and al but also in
[1:08:45] that which is to come. 2 Timothy 4:10
[1:08:48] for Deus has forsaken me having loved
[1:08:52] this present eternity.
[1:08:54] Huh? How do you have a present eternity?
[1:08:57] You can't you can't have a present
[1:09:00] eternity.
[1:09:02] Eternity has no beginning and no ending.
[1:09:06] So here at this present age,
[1:09:12] 1 Corinthians 2:7, but we speak the
[1:09:14] wisdom of God in a mystery, even the
[1:09:16] hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[1:09:19] eternity to our glory.
[1:09:23] Does it work?
[1:09:24] No.
[1:09:25] No, it doesn't. Before the ages.
[1:09:28] That's what this is.
[1:09:29] Yeah.
[1:09:31] Hebrews 5:6. as he saith al saith also
[1:09:35] in another place, thou art a priest for
[1:09:38] eternity after the order of Melkazedc.
[1:09:40] Again,
[1:09:42] he's not a priest for eternity. He's a
[1:09:44] priest for redemption.
[1:09:46] That ministry of priesthood comes to an
[1:09:48] end.
[1:09:49] Yeah.
[1:09:49] Turns from priesthood to to be a king.
[1:09:52] That's
[1:09:52] right.
[1:09:53] So, this is for here. Here it's forever,
[1:09:56] which is a period of time.
[1:09:57] Yeah.
[1:09:59] Matthew 13:40. As therefore the tears
[1:10:02] are gathered and burned in the fire, so
[1:10:04] it it shall be in the end of eternity.
[1:10:12] Does it work? Doesn't work.
[1:10:14] So shall it be in the end of the age.
[1:10:19] All right. So those those are those
[1:10:20] words ion. Here is Ionios.
[1:10:24] They are definition is without beginning
[1:10:26] and end that which has been and always
[1:10:28] will be. See, there's uh the definition
[1:10:31] that we're looking at
[1:10:33] without beginning, without end, never to
[1:10:34] cease, everlasting. That's the
[1:10:37] definition that they get. And I'm going
[1:10:39] to show you be careful at looking at the
[1:10:42] definition in Strong's concordance and
[1:10:45] the because the scripture does not bear
[1:10:48] that. This is the meaning. It's directly
[1:10:51] connected to the last word that we used
[1:10:55] second Peter 1:11. And for so an
[1:10:58] entrance shall be ministered unto you
[1:11:00] abundantly into the eternal kingdom of
[1:11:02] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 1
[1:11:04] Corinthians 15. We understand there's a
[1:11:06] time where the son submits the kingdom
[1:11:08] back to the father. That's when we go
[1:11:10] from the millennium. That's right.
[1:11:12] That's the kingdom of our Lord and
[1:11:13] Savior Jesus Christ when he sits on the
[1:11:15] throne of his father David. Then the end
[1:11:19] comes and there's a new heaven and a new
[1:11:23] earth and a new Jerusalem. There's an
[1:11:25] end to the king the kingly work of
[1:11:28] Christ.
[1:11:32] Romans 16:25. Now to him that is of
[1:11:35] power to establish you according to my
[1:11:37] gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ
[1:11:40] according to the revelation of the
[1:11:41] mystery which was kept secret since
[1:11:43] eternity began.
[1:11:47] Again, this word which means has no
[1:11:49] beginning and no ending is directly
[1:11:51] connected by the apostle to a word that
[1:11:54] me has literally began
[1:11:58] since the ages began
[1:12:01] since the creation of the world. That's
[1:12:04] what it's referring to.
[1:12:07] Jude 1:7, even as Sodom and Gomorrah and
[1:12:10] the cities about them in like manner,
[1:12:12] giving themselves over to fornication
[1:12:14] and going after strange flesh are set
[1:12:17] forth for an example, some suffering the
[1:12:19] inven.
[1:12:23] So I have a question. If they're
[1:12:26] suffering the vengeance of eternal fire,
[1:12:28] in other words, they're still being
[1:12:31] tormented. Sodom and Gomorrah is still
[1:12:33] being burned.
[1:12:36] Where is it? Why can no one find it?
[1:12:38] Right.
[1:12:39] It should be very easy to find with a
[1:12:41] satellite.
[1:12:42] There's a place that's burning with
[1:12:44] sulfur and ashes.
[1:12:47] H somewhere in the Middle East. Really
[1:12:50] tough to find.
[1:12:52] No, the fire was eternal because it was
[1:12:54] God.
[1:12:55] But what did that eternal fire do? In an
[1:12:58] instant burned up that city.
[1:13:00] Uhhuh. Amen.
[1:13:01] So there's eternal fire for you.
[1:13:03] Yeah.
[1:13:06] Matthew 25:46.
[1:13:09] And again, and these shall go away into
[1:13:12] everlasting punishment, but the
[1:13:14] righteous into life eternal. If you look
[1:13:17] up the Strongs, everlasting and eternal
[1:13:20] are the exact same word, ionios.
[1:13:24] So if life is eternal, that's this is
[1:13:27] what theologians say. If life is
[1:13:29] eternal, then punishment also must be
[1:13:32] eternal. But I submit to you based on
[1:13:35] everything that we've read is that we
[1:13:37] have to understand the context.
[1:13:42] First you understand the context of the
[1:13:43] verse,
[1:13:45] right?
[1:13:46] You can't say since eternity began
[1:13:48] because it don't make any sense. It's a
[1:13:50] logical contradiction. You have to say
[1:13:52] since the ages began, right? And so here
[1:13:55] we have eternal punishment and eternal
[1:13:58] life. Well, the punishment is eternal.
[1:14:00] He makes his judgment and it never
[1:14:02] changes.
[1:14:04] But that doesn't tell us is it conscious
[1:14:08] eternal
[1:14:10] torment.
[1:14:11] That's a different answer. That's a
[1:14:13] different question. Those are two
[1:14:14] different things.
[1:14:15] Life eternal. We have to understand what
[1:14:18] life eternal is based on the context of
[1:14:20] the rest of scripture. Amen.
[1:14:22] Does that mean we just live for a
[1:14:23] thousand years and then we're we we die?
[1:14:25] Or does that mean we will live with no
[1:14:27] end?
[1:14:29] Well, scripture will reveal what it is.
[1:14:38] So, we've explained this already. Those
[1:14:40] there are two words in the Greek
[1:14:42] translated as eternal. It depends on the
[1:14:44] context.
[1:14:46] What does it mean? If does it mean an
[1:14:47] age? Does it mean a something that has a
[1:14:49] beginning and ending? Does it mean
[1:14:50] something that has no beginning and no
[1:14:52] ending? As you even saw in the first
[1:14:54] definition,
[1:14:57] they had so many definitions that
[1:14:58] completely contradict themselves.
[1:15:01] So, it's a word that is open to
[1:15:03] interpretation based on the context.
[1:15:07] Not open to whatever we want it to say.
[1:15:10] Right.
[1:15:10] Scripture doesn't work like that. First,
[1:15:13] you have to understand, and that's why
[1:15:15] brother Brandham makes the point over
[1:15:16] and over again, it has to dovetail from
[1:15:18] Genesis to Revelation. You can't take
[1:15:20] one scripture isolated against the rest
[1:15:22] of the Bible and say, "See, I told you
[1:15:23] so. You didn't tell me anything."
[1:15:25] Because you're just looking at one Bible
[1:15:27] verse, and you have to look at the whole
[1:15:28] of Re Revelation, the whole of
[1:15:30] redemption history, the the whole the
[1:15:33] whole all of it
[1:15:34] to be consistent.
[1:15:45] you know, I'm going to I'm going to call
[1:15:46] the musicians up and uh
[1:15:51] start to close.
[1:15:53] So again, if it if eternal if ionios is
[1:15:57] used in conjun conjunction with God or
[1:16:00] with life or with the almighty
[1:16:03] or a quality of the almighty, we can
[1:16:05] understand it means it never had a
[1:16:07] beginning, it never has an end, right?
[1:16:10] But if it's speaking of something that
[1:16:12] has to do with time, then we also we
[1:16:14] also understand that you can't make it
[1:16:16] eternal.
[1:16:18] The context is very clear and actually
[1:16:20] very easy to understand. And so when
[1:16:22] you're looking at this, I've never I've
[1:16:24] still not seen a scripture that says
[1:16:26] that
[1:16:29] a sinner under condemnation
[1:16:33] lives for all of eternity. Musicians,
[1:16:35] come on up. I wasn't kidding around.
[1:16:44] And so
[1:16:46] it's it we went through them. It's easy,
[1:16:49] very clear to understand. The next thing
[1:16:51] I want to go into, I just this if I went
[1:16:54] into it, it would take another half an
[1:16:56] hour and I I don't want to uh do that.
[1:16:59] This is a lot of material and I don't
[1:17:02] want to overwhelm. But um the next thing
[1:17:05] I want to look start to look at is the
[1:17:07] scriptures that speak clearly that Jesus
[1:17:10] speaks directly about hell. So that we
[1:17:13] can see that and relate it back and say,
[1:17:15] okay, is is Jesus really is Jesus or the
[1:17:19] apostles is the Old Testament really
[1:17:21] telling us about an eternal hell that
[1:17:23] has no ending?
[1:17:27] We'll we'll look into that. No, it's
[1:17:28] not. I'll tell you that already. But we
[1:17:31] want to see it in the scriptures because
[1:17:32] many people will bring you many ideas
[1:17:34] and thoughts and they'll take the
[1:17:35] scripture and you'll get you'll get so
[1:17:37] nervous. I don't know how to answer.
[1:17:39] Well, the Lord has answers for all of
[1:17:41] it.
[1:17:42] Amen.
[1:17:43] And most of it is very simple and easy
[1:17:45] to understand.
[1:17:48] You know, one one that Well, I'm not
[1:17:51] going to go there. Just let's let's
[1:17:52] stand up and pray.
[1:17:57] Father, we we thank you so much for your
[1:17:59] goodness.
[1:18:02] Lord, we thank you so much for for your
[1:18:04] word. Lord, I I can say I can testify,
[1:18:08] oh Lord, I would be in so much confusion
[1:18:10] if you hadn't sent sent a prophet in
[1:18:12] this day.
[1:18:15] Lord, I thank you, Lord, that in such a
[1:18:17] humble way,
[1:18:20] you brought to us this truth. Lord, even
[1:18:24] Lord, doing it in such a way that you
[1:18:26] would
[1:18:28] make us humble ourselves. Lord, it's
[1:18:30] just the way you did all through
[1:18:31] scripture.
[1:18:32] [Music]
[1:18:35] You didn't bring a message through
[1:18:41] some great theologian.
[1:18:44] You didn't bring it through a doctor of
[1:18:47] divinity, but you took a life. What
[1:18:51] encouragement this is to us, Lord. I
[1:18:54] thank you for it. You took a life, a
[1:18:56] humble life.
[1:18:58] Born in a place that most of us wouldn't
[1:19:02] want to be born in. Raised in a way that
[1:19:04] we probably wouldn't want to be raised
[1:19:06] in, Lord. Right in the midst of all
[1:19:10] kinds of terrible things, Lord. and you
[1:19:13] protected that life and you molded that
[1:19:16] life and you shaped that life but you
[1:19:19] kept it so humble Lord
[1:19:23] to bring such an incredible
[1:19:26] rich glorious beautiful incredible
[1:19:29] revelation to our hearts
[1:19:31] [Music]
[1:19:33] and yet
[1:19:35] many pass right over it. You just like
[1:19:39] the scripture says, "We thank you,
[1:19:41] Father. You've hid these things from the
[1:19:44] wise and prudent, and you've revealed
[1:19:46] them to babes as such as would learn."
[1:19:51] Lord, thank you for your grace. Thank
[1:19:52] you for giving us eyes to see and ears
[1:19:55] to hear. Lord,
[1:19:56] amen.
[1:19:58] Pray that you'd continue to teach us,
[1:20:00] Lord. Help us to be a light to this
[1:20:03] little area, Father,
[1:20:06] to this community.
[1:20:09] May you anoint us, Lord, to be witnesses
[1:20:13] and to testify of the things you're
[1:20:15] doing in this hour.
[1:20:18] We ask these things in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:20:24] Amen.
[1:20:27] [Music]
[1:20:29] Think about his goodness.
[1:20:35] Think about his grace
[1:20:41] that brought us through.
[1:20:45] [Music]
[1:20:48] For as high as the heavens above,
[1:20:54] [Music]
[1:20:55] great is the measure
[1:20:59] of our father's love.
[1:21:06] [Music]
[1:21:08] Great is the measure
[1:21:11] of our father's
[1:21:14] love. Amen. Think about his love verse.
[1:21:19] Think about his love.
[1:21:23] [Music]
[1:21:25] Think about his goodness.
[1:21:29] [Music]
[1:21:31] Think about his grace
[1:21:37] that brought us through.
[1:21:41] [Music]
[1:21:44] For as high as the heavens above,
[1:21:49] [Music]
[1:21:52] great is the measure
[1:21:55] of our Father's
[1:21:58] love.
[1:22:02] [Music]
[1:22:04] Great is the measure
[1:22:08] of our Father's
[1:22:11] love.
[1:22:13] Amen. Let's Let's come forward.
[1:22:16] I don't have any uh prayer requests yet.
[1:22:19] I don't know if Brother Jason has any
[1:22:22] that he's going to quickly forward on to
[1:22:24] me, but I know there's prayer requests.
[1:22:30] We all have them.
[1:22:33] But um
[1:22:35] we'll give a time to testify as well. If
[1:22:39] anybody has a prayer request that you'd
[1:22:41] like to make known now, Jason, go ahead
[1:22:44] and do that.
[1:22:45] Um, so there's a brother in Arizona,

[1:22:55] right out of his heart basically blew up
[1:22:58] and it um dumped a bunch of broken
[1:23:01] tissue throughout his body and created
[1:23:03] blockages which gathered his
[1:23:05] extremities. And um the doctors have
[1:23:08] basically said he's going to die and if
[1:23:10] he doesn't they're going to have to
[1:23:11] amputate his hands and feet and the end
[1:23:12] of his nose and all kinds of horrible
[1:23:14] stuff.
[1:23:14] Oh my.
[1:23:15] And um everyone out there is praying
[1:23:18] earnestly for this brother. And I it's
[1:23:20] been on my heart real strong. And um
[1:23:23] we're just not accepting that at all for
[1:23:25] this brother cuz I mean
[1:23:27] this to have this man have his hands and
[1:23:30] feet cut off that's just not acceptable.
[1:23:31] Amen. So if we could pray for that.

[1:26:11] Lord. You're still a supernatural God.
[1:26:14] Contrary to what many say, they don't
[1:26:16] believe in miracles. They don't believe
[1:26:17] that the supernatural power of God and
[1:26:20] but we we believe Lord. We've seen the
[1:26:22] supernatural power of that you've done
[1:26:25] for us in our own lives, Lord. We we've
[1:26:28] seen it, Lord. And we've heard the
[1:26:29] testimonies. No doubt we'll have
[1:26:30] testimonies tonight of your supernatural
[1:26:32] power of God. Lord, we thank you for
[1:26:34] that. So, we're believing for brother

[1:26:46] things that are on people's hearts and

[1:27:28] Amen. Amen. Any testimonies tonight?
[1:27:34] Sister Emily.
[1:27:36] [Music]
[1:27:40] So, uh Wesley, my nephew, he was one of
[1:27:43] the groomsmen at the wedding. It was the
[1:27:45] tall blonde. Um him and his girlfriend
[1:27:49] uh were up in northern Idaho just like a
[1:27:51] day or two after the wedding and rolled
[1:27:55] a pickup truck head over
[1:27:58] heels or whatever end over endow into a
[1:28:02] icy river and um he was ejected out of
[1:28:06] the passenger window and um he it's just
[1:28:12] a miracle that he's alive. He um busted
[1:28:14] up his arm and they had to climb up this
[1:28:18] um bank to get to a car to wave a car
[1:28:20] down and um get get him took him all
[1:28:24] night to get to a hospital that would
[1:28:26] that would do surgery. So, he was
[1:28:28] bleeding and he's does have some PTSD
[1:28:30] about it. He's just um it's playing in
[1:28:33] his mind. So, some emotional problems,
[1:28:36] but he's alive and well. And my mom
[1:28:39] said, "Well, about three years ago, I
[1:28:41] was praying for my family that God would
[1:28:44] God would deal with our family." And
[1:28:45] it's been like a lot of stuff going on
[1:28:48] with our family, but um he about a month
[1:28:51] ago, he told my dad that he wanted to
[1:28:54] serve God. And he asked for a Bible. And
[1:28:56] his girlfriend is a nominal Christian.
[1:28:59] And my sister said that um even just
[1:29:02] here at the airport, she got food and
[1:29:04] she said, "Grab his hand." And she's
[1:29:06] like, "Let's pray for our food, Wesley."
[1:29:07] and he's lived in a household that's
[1:29:09] been um a worldly household. But anyway,
[1:29:13] it's just God's moving and it's a
[1:29:15] miracle that he's alive and I'm it was a
[1:29:16] miracle that he was at the wedding and
[1:29:18] it's just he's a special kid.
[1:29:20] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:29:24] [Applause]
[1:29:29] [Music]
[1:29:33] God bless you. Um, I have a chop saw and
[1:29:37] if anybody knows when you're working on
[1:29:39] a chops or anything, it has a guard that
[1:29:42] when you pick it up, the guard comes
[1:29:45] down and covers the blade. When you pull
[1:29:47] it down, the guard comes up, the blade
[1:29:50] engages the wood or whatever you're
[1:29:51] cutting. Well, my guard was a little
[1:29:56] messed up. So, I was basically I was
[1:29:58] trying to hold it up while I was cutting
[1:30:00] and then it got stuck up. So, I was
[1:30:02] like, "Okay, we're good. I can just But
[1:30:05] that's not what happened. Now this guard
[1:30:07] is like 8 inch plastic covers the thing
[1:30:11] and as I went down to cut
[1:30:14] it dropped down and the thing just kind
[1:30:16] of exploded. Went everywhere. I was
[1:30:18] standing right there and I I didn't
[1:30:21] think all I heard was a noise. I didn't
[1:30:22] see anything. Didn't get hit with
[1:30:24] anything. Um I was probably picking up
[1:30:27] pieces for a couple of days. picked up
[1:30:30] piece on the other side of the garage,
[1:30:31] outside the door, but I was standing
[1:30:33] right there and it I was just I didn't
[1:30:35] really realize at the time, but I was
[1:30:37] just like, "Thank you, Jesus." I could
[1:30:39] have been, you know, cut a little bit,
[1:30:41] cut a lot, but
[1:30:42] I didn't get cut at all.
[1:30:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:46] [Applause]
[1:30:52] I just have a quick testimony. I was
[1:30:53] going into Charleston this morning alone
[1:30:57] and um some of the traffic was right
[1:31:00] over a crest and they had all suddenly
[1:31:03] slammed on their brakes. So I started
[1:31:04] slamming on merry brakes and I was
[1:31:06] within a very tiny bit of hitting the
[1:31:09] car in front of me. But thank thankfully
[1:31:11] I stopped dead and so I'm just thankful
[1:31:13] that the Lord protected me and my
[1:31:15] vehicle.
[1:31:16] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:20] Any
[1:31:23] others?
[1:31:25] [Music]
[1:31:27] Can we sing? Uh, let's just worship the
[1:31:30] Lord before we go. I love you, Lord.
[1:31:35] I love
[1:31:38] you, Lord.
[1:31:42] And I lift
[1:31:46] my voice
[1:31:50] to
[1:31:52] worship
[1:31:56] you,
[1:31:58] oh my soul.
[1:32:03] Rejoice,
[1:32:05] [Music]
[1:32:07] take joy,
[1:32:10] my king,
[1:32:15] in
[1:32:16] what
[1:32:18] you hear.
[1:32:23] Let it be a sweet
[1:32:27] sweet
[1:32:29] sound
[1:32:31] in your
[1:32:33] Oh, worship him tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:32:38] Amen.
[1:32:40] I love
[1:32:43] you, Lord,
[1:32:47] and I live
[1:32:51] my voice
[1:32:57] to worship
[1:33:02] you.
[1:33:04] Oh my soul,
[1:33:09] rejoice.
[1:33:13] Take joy
[1:33:16] my king
[1:33:21] in
[1:33:22] what
[1:33:24] you hear.
[1:33:29] May it be a sweet,
[1:33:33] sweet
[1:33:35] sound
[1:33:37] in your knees.
[1:33:41] Sing that song. There's none like you.
[1:33:45] There's none like you.
[1:33:53] No one else can touch my heart like you
[1:33:58] do.
[1:34:00] [Music]
[1:34:02] I can search for all eternity
[1:34:07] long
[1:34:09] and find
[1:34:11] there is none like you.
[1:34:16] Sing it again.
[1:34:19] There is none like you.
[1:34:28] No one else can touch my heart like you
[1:34:33] do.
[1:34:36] I could search for all eternity
[1:34:41] long
[1:34:43] and find
[1:34:45] there is none like you.
[1:34:49] Amen. Heavenly Father, as we dismiss,
[1:34:51] may we be filled with the Holy Spirit,
[1:34:54] filled with love, filled with your
[1:34:57] presence. Lord, truly there's none like
[1:34:58] you. We thank you for that, Lord. We
[1:35:00] thank you that we know you in spirit and

[1:35:11] us. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[1:35:16] Greet one another. God bless you.

[1:35:22] youth meeting

[1:35:28] Sister Sarah's house. Uh that's senior
[1:35:30] youth 13 and up. God bless you all. No
[1:35:33] one else can touch my heart like you do.
[1:35:41] I can search for all eternity long
[1:35:47] and find

[1:35:58] There is none like you.
[1:36:03] Jesus,
[1:36:06] no one else can touch my heart like you
[1:36:11] do.
[1:36:14] I could search for all eternity long
[1:36:21] and find
[1:36:23] there is none like you.
[1:36:32] flow like the river wine.
[1:36:39] Healing
[1:36:41] comes from your hand.

[1:36:50] are safe in your arms.
[1:36:56] There is none like you.
