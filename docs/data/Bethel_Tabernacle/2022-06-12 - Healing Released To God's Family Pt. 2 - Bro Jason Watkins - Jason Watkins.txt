lot of wave offering just worship him for a few minutes because he lives all fear is gone because i know he holds the future [Music] is just oh my he's certainly worthy of all of that the bible commands us it's not a recommendation he commands us to give his name the honor that it's due his worthiness friends where would we be i wouldn't stand a chance amen praise the lord greet you in the name of the lord today i'm going to make just a few quick announcements um write right fast before we turn into the book of revelation amen amen pause that right quick while i make these announcements um i want to first thank the lord that we're in service today amen uh thankful to the lord for all the testimonies i've had quite a few testimonies even some more coming in this morning from brother bruce and different ones and over previous days and uh thankful to the lord that he's brought everybody uh through this recent virus outbreak and it wasn't too severe it was a pretty much of a mild case most everybody got through it in a few days and but we've still we've got a few still um with a handful just a small handful kind of following the uh the new recommendation from the cdc they've lowered it from 10 days now to five days i think they realize that we pretty well all contacted it amen it's pretty well i think everybody around the world has probably come into contact with it and and people who have been vaccinated still get it people who aren't get it so what amen so we we just realized that these things are coming upon the world and i think that they realized that um the the part that was really lethal when it first came out and human bodies weren't used to it and we lost a number of very precious people in the message but it was all in god's control it was all in god's hands and so that's why we made a decision we would never operate in fear uh we would always do what was prudent and try to use the better part of wisdom but and so we we suspended wednesday and i hated doing that i always hate doing that um but uh i i do think it was the right decision elsewise i wouldn't have done it and so um we want to just uh be praying for those who are still on the last parts of recovery most of them i've got reports doing good but they're just um just continuing uh to wait out those five days so it's all good amen i want to give you a reminder so we want to be praying for them don't forget that and i want to give you a reminder that today i i think we've called it for 4 p.m uh sister jean will be continuing her amazing journey into the message of the hour and so she she left us last time as a young 21 year old mother uh receiving the holy ghost and just giving her testimony and so we we're it's uh kind of aimed at the senior youth but everybody's invited we let everybody that wanted to come last time we just keep uh the adults toward the back and we set all of the senior youth up here on the side near the front we put sister gene over here amen so i i'm looking forward to it again and uh it's not it's not going to be easy you know to cover 81 years of life and god dealing with her from a little girl amen and you know and and and dylan bringing her up and how she came to the message i think today she's planning to try to come from a 21 year old young mother and and tell you how brother eddie came in and how he got the holy ghost and and how they came to hear the message of the hour and they were living in texas and up through 1964 uh when they came to uh be in the meetings there with brother branham so i'm looking forward to that she'll need a third party amen to take it from there to now i want to know how she made it to here amen he said well you're a son you should know you can't believe how many things i heard her say in part one i thought wow i never knew that so we've been thoroughly enjoying it the young people have been the older people have been and so it's really wonderful i want to announce a senior youth gathering uh on this coming saturday uh june 18. uh we're going to have it out at brother michael and sister wanda gonzalez home amen that's a great place to do it i've i've actually got some plans when the weather cools off to do some campfire stuff out there brother mike and sister wanda live in an amazing it's a paradox it's like the wilderness but yet it's there's a modern home and you're driving out this road brother kenneth i don't know if you've ever been to their house but you're driving out this road and you think nobody could even live out here this is this is swampy and it's like a primitive campground back here and only cavemen would live back here and suddenly you round up you round a curve and boom there's a house like who who put a house back here and so it's a wonderful way to get away and feel like you're in the wilderness and you're actually 15 minutes from walmart amen so i uh we we're looking forward to some of that so this saturday i'll announce the time i don't have it worked out with mo just yet i want to see what's going to be best for them but that'll be this saturday and uh i've got a a film that i want to show you that i got from sister emily cobb uh and it deals with uh it's a documentary on life and dna and things like that and i'm going to tell you something friends i was told that this thing would bring you to tears and it pretty well did it was astonishing how god makes science prove his word and it it left me speechless at times and i i was thought of so many places in the scripture where if they just took god's word for it they could have saved billions of dollars in research and and just said well this is what happened and here's why here's how we're here and here's why we're here amen and then uh brother matt smith is gonna follow up the film with a bible lesson related to uh he's got a topic that he's been studying that's going to marry up to that really well so matt and i worked that out together and so we're looking forward to that this saturday at the gonzalez's home amen we want to be praying for brother jason uh his upcoming missionary trip leaving tuesday gonna be gone from june 14 to june 29 visiting turkey egypt and norway and so that's wonderful we're just uh thanking the lord that things are starting to open back up and brother jd getting back to the nuts and bolts of his ministry we even enjoyed having him here uninterrupted and i know the the his wife and kids have enjoyed that and uh but amen the lord is calling our brother overseas so we want to keep him in prayer and we've um helping to try to sponsor some of that so god bless you um in all of that let's turn in our bibles to the book of genesis chapter 1 praise the lord you love him say amen all right genesis chapter 1 and we're going to begin reading from verse 29 amen let me get myself to the right spot i i'm wanting to continue today with uh the sermon that i started i was shocked when i looked on the website saying how long it's been since i've stood here preaching and it's been quite a while so i i tried to start preaching behind brother abraham the other service and boy i sure could have done it but but uh it i was my fox's tale was on fire amen so we want to get back into it today and i want to continue this thought from weeks ago uh a tithe i titled it healing released to god's family genesis 1 29 we begin and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree which is in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to everything that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life i have given every green herb for meat and it was so and god saw that everything that he had made behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made let's go to the back of your bible to revelation chapter 16. we're going to catch just one single verse which is the 17th verse amen revelation chapter 16 and verse 17 and the seventh angel poured out his violin to the air and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done want to also as we go to prayer be remembering brother brad is away ministering and the devil was battling his throat this morning want to keep him in prayer this morning and so let's let's just be remembering god's servants that are ministering away amen father we thank you for your word this morning lord we thank you that you have brought it to us with such clarity and now i stand here this morning lord god that and asking that you would be mindful of your word that we need at this hour lord it's all before me and i have so much lord it's been even a struggle to try to figure out exactly what can be covered today and so we give it into your hands lord we're asking for your mercy on the traveling ministry team members father brother brad preaching there this morning in north carolina for brother jewell i pray you will bless his his efforts his throat strengthen his body may your holy spirit have perfect sway during those services lord may brother jewels assembly be blessed under the word we pray for brother joe how to show his family away in florida today ministering lord there in in panama city i pray father that the great anointing of the holy spirit would be upon our brother as he brings the word father be here with us now we commit ourselves into your hands in jesus name amen god bless you amen you can be seated now i i'm i want to just kind of take maybe 15 or 20 minutes to build a foundation so that that will enable me to refer back to my foundation you're going to hear me do that you understand how brother jason works i'm very structured and i'm not a teacher per se but i i am a subject preacher and i'm generally very focused and i have things laid out i don't always get to follow them sometimes the lord we get hijacked and the lord takes things in the way he wants it to go i'm only trusting that that as i have it laid out in front of me it seems to be the way the lord has anointed me thank you brother anthony and uh as i said that i've had a lot that i want to say from being out of the pulpit for some time now and i'm not going to try to say it all today so you know me you know my way i i like to make sure you retain and i don't over tax your attention span or oversponge your mind with information so don't worry just sit tight and uh and we're going to come to the real burden of my heart today but i i want to just weigh in with connecting genesis to revelation for a few minutes is that okay is that okay all right so i i was noticing on uh on a leading science magazine that i have read for years uh from a very young man and i i've noticed that one of the the themes that they kind of established a theme almost like a mission statement and i thought that's uh rather odd the first time i read it but i i realized that they're actually keeping it at the forefront it's as if it's what they want to be in the front of everyone's mind and all their subscribers they want this to be in the front of your mind and the statement goes like this this is the most exciting time to be alive in history to which i rarely can read a magazine and say amen but i could say amen to that now not for the same reason that they're believing that it's the greatest most exciting time to be alive in history but for time meeting prophecy and our part that we see our lives are literally walking through the bible right now i it is my great goal in this small series to try to tie some things together for you so that my aim is that by the time i get finished you're going to realize that there is nothing happening that's an accident there is nothing that has happened that is an accident and there is you know we we we we find that i want to make this statement that by being obedient to the word that we can destroy everything that satan comes against our lives with and that's an important point because satan now has reached a time where a prophet would identify that he's now the god news flash world here listen up earth satan is the god of the age this is actually now satan's eden brother branham says as god took 6 000 years to build his eden now satan has had 6 000 years to build his and he's built it methodically he's built it with with with intent he's built it with a lot of malice and a lot of forethought and you say what are what is the motive and the objective of lucifer he goes about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour he comes only for one reason and that's to steal and that's to kill and that's to destroy now he has a notion that he wanted to have a kingdom and be worshipped like god and a prophet discerned the very secret of lucifer's heart lucifer didn't like that he got outed by the prophet when the prophet said satan here's what you said in your heart and i'm gonna write it in a book and i'm gonna and god's gonna see that the whole world gets to read it that you said in your heart i will ascend and be like the most high i will put up my throne in the in the in the north uh and and this will be uh satan's attempt i realize i have this in my pocket i've set it out here to make an announcement this is somebody's watch it's been sitting back there for three months someone please claim it or it'll go to the lost and found and from there someone some strange will be wearing it so if it's your watch uh you can come up here at the end of service and get it it's an incline watch like a nice ladies watch so there you go all right let's leave it sitting there brother so we keep that reminded um and and we'll we'll put it lost and found soon all right now so we find then that that everything that we see happening satan has desired now he cannot and you want to be real aware of this satan you you shouldn't imagine that he's trying to build a kingdom alongside the kingdom of god it's not like he's saying to god you know you got your kingdom and your family and your people but hey i don't really want to be a part of that i want to go over here and build up my own kingdom now you could almost you you'd be excused for making that assumption the world seems to think of it that way but the prophet gives gives him away in that he wants to put his kingdom in the north exactly where the kingdom of michael was established so he's not saying i want to have a kingdom along with your kingdom and let the people choose which which kingdom they want to live in he doesn't want a two kingdom system he wants to destroy he wants to replace the kingdom of christ you get that so now you wanna you're gonna wanna be aware that everything he does has the main objective oh please hear these words his main objective is to destroy god's kingdom and since you happen to be god's kingdom then he wants to destroy every every move he makes every morning when he wakes up that's his plan to wipe to destroy the wisdom of parents to destroy the discernment of ministers to destroy the pursuit of young people to to set goals and dreams and he he's very crafty and he's very cunning and he can make it look like it you'll have an advantage but but you just remember every motive and every objective he has is the uh is the establishment of his kingdom at the cost of the annihilation of christ's kingdom if you if you lose sight of that then this is why too often times we find and i'm gonna i'm gonna go ahead and give you i'm gonna go ahead and put a ribbon on you i'm gonna go ahead and give you a medal today and to say i'm gonna believe by faith that every one of us in here are sons and daughters of god and yet you might find it strange to hear me say god sent me to preach this sermon to sons and daughters of god and say to you that this is exactly why you don't always find yourself having the victory you know you ought to have being seeing the promises of god come to pass in your life and i'm going to tell you something friends it's it's almost entirely if not entirely the fact that we lean towards you know towards satan's economy and it at the at the cost of dedicating ourselves to god's economy in god's kingdom and i've seen that have devastating consequences i've seen young people with that that go down the the way and they for reasons that are many sometimes they pick a path young people pick a path going forward they have a certain goal certain things they want to accomplish in the world something they want to be there's some image in their mind and it's not always that they can articulate exactly what the image is and and it's not that they have a poster on their wall and saying i want to be like this person or i want to be like this situation but it's it's the satan is oftentimes too crafty for that it just comes across sometimes as a as a desire to pursue the excellence as it's measured by the world standards and i can tell you something friends the way the world measures success and the way god measures success are they are they are completely opposite and and in fact his brother branham said if you're going to be uh if you if you're lusting to to have success in the world and you want to be you know uh that in the world he said you might as well forget this because this this is going to ruin your chances of being globally accepted this is going to ruin your chances of being globally popular this book will destroy all of your dreams to be somebody famous and admired among humanity but but the the beauty of it is that you're gonna want it to do that because everything in this world is going irreversibly irretrievably no way to stop it it's plunging off the abyss and going to ash and cinder and only those who made this their goal are going to be looking at a world after this world is over you got me so so we find then that this is satan's goal and it brings upon us a responsibility that we have to take the responsibility of our portion now this is where the the problem so often comes i said a few minutes ago how that you know young people and we have a lot of senior youth our senior youth group is pretty large more than now now nearly 30 and and so uh or more and so it's very relevant what i just said concerning the the pursuit of success in this world young people don't live in a mirage under a delusion of the devil thinking that the success of the world is your goal it's not your goal is eternal life because that's the only thing that'll last it's the only thing that matters everything else is going to destruction but then but then there's the sometimes it's it's not even that sometimes a you know a young person will make that choice no matter how what church they were at no matter who their parents were no matter what kind of raising no matter you you can't you can we can't save our children all we can do is train them up in the ways of the lord and try to live an example and pray for them and apply the token to them say well that sounds pretty feeble that's that's more power than than a nuclear reactor that has more power prayer and love and the holy spirit are the are the strongest forces and the strongest weapon and and too often times we we we find ourselves even parents and ministers and leaders we don't avail of all the opportunity that is right in front of us to have that kind of power and have that kind of influence sometimes you're gonna you're gonna go to the wall and you're gonna hit on all eight cylinders and the preacher's gonna do everything he can and everybody's gonna be praying and sometimes that young person will still stray sometimes they'll go a long ways and finally the holy spirit will bring him back because everybody kept praying and everybody kept believing and we kept loving and we kept hanging on to god and god brought them back and they come back cut up scarred and bruised and wounded and burnt and blistered and and you say needlessly yeah in one sense but maybe maybe god had to put them through that to make them useful somewhere down the road you know i i'm not saying it can't happen i'm just simply wanting you to open your eyes to understand what's happening see and then sometimes the it really becomes very bad because you know the sometimes ministry sometimes parents don't take the responsibility they they themselves aren't very spiritual and so they still want to live with one foot in the world and one foot in the holy spirit and children of god remember i already put a medal on you today don't think i'm not calling you a child of god you know you you you you still lusting for the things of the world you believe god you believe the message you're true you love the lord you really do for real no kidding but yet there's there's not that taking of that responsibility of resisting the enemy of and you can't resist the enemy until you surrender yourself to god that nobody ever successfully resisted the devil shall resist him and he'll flee from me no he won't you first the first part of that verse is that you humble yourself that you submit yourself unto god resist the devil it's a it's a two-stage process and and there's where people they don't mind saying oh i'll just resist the devil and i'll i'll just keep my family away from the really bad things but where's the where's the real total surrender that that can allow god to come down into a home and find order and get behind order and drive the order of his word forward and you begin to see miracles in your home and in your life and in your family i'm here to tell you something friends that that that that if we are willing to be obedient to the word you say well this happened this happened this happened this happened i got this disadvantage this disadvantage this is this disadvantage that's a lie of the devil to make you live in a pity party the you are the most privileged people that have ever walked the earth god revealed his word to you you are such a microscopic minority in in billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions of people and there's a little sliver of the elect lady and god has revealed to you and your eyes have come open amen see oh this happened to me that happened to me it's happened to all of us but let us rejoice in all things let us give thanks let us let the bride hath made herself ready stop giving yourself the excuse for carnality stop blaming it on someone else say it's me o lord standing in the need of prayer you are phenomenally privileged phenomenally uh advantaged and all god is simply trying to get you to understand is he started it perfect by the time we get to revelation 16 a seventh vial is working in the world pouring out judgments and the bride is on the cusp of going home and the world is on the cusp of going into a tribulation and god is going to restore it all the way back and i just say i intend to be a part of that restoration i don't intend to go down with laodicea i intend to step on a millennial world i intend for that for my family and i'm willing i'm willing to say i will do what is necessary to submit myself to god humble my heart to his word give up all my dreams set my motives and objectives for his kingdom and teach my children and teach my grandchildren and be an example to christ of christ in the world and when you see that lacking when you see disorder in families and homes and marriages and young people and preachers and churches and ministry when you see things that are out of order and you see that god can't bless it god can't prosper it then it becomes careful how i say this it i don't want to diminish being right but you know you can you can be right in your understanding of a certain thing but if you go about it out of god's order then god can't get behind it even though what you're doing is right even though your motive your objective is pure but if you don't but if you don't submit yourself to god's order god's way of doing it see and and and this is why paul deals with families say my it's almost like paul's a third of his ministry is psychology well he's dealing with people who have a psyche he's dealing with people who have minds so it becomes necessary for paul to say things like you know cast down vain imaginations anything that exalts itself in your mind against god's word say well what is that what does that even mean it means that when the enemy comes along enticing you with some advancement in life or some entertainment or some recreation that you that you know is not according to god's character that's the time where you cast that down and say i will not do that i will not go that way i will submit myself to the word of god i will resist the devil and i will have victory because it's super sad to see young people who almost don't even get to get out of the gate there's no i've seen that so many years i i've had my heart broken more times you know trying to see young people that come up and i dedicate them as babies and baptize them as a as a tween and and and and then see them see that see the parents just not care enough because they still themselves are still caught between lusting for god and lusting for the world and and and the children are just left to go and then and then see them blow out and see them go into the world and they're out there even today and i pray for them constantly they're still out there today and even if they come back they're coming back wounded burnt blistered scarred scratched scorched and he say oh brother jason you you're trying to step on parents toes i'm not trying to step on anybody's toes if i'm stepping on toes i want to step on my own and say lord i want to press harder and i want to be even more of an example and i want to i want to preach it harder and i want to try to warn you that we're we're at the time where elements under the trumpets and vials and seals are pouring out into the earth and there's no remedy for it this earth is burning down but god is taking a bride home and god has has victory for you right now in satan's eden at his zenith god can still establish his throne and his authority in your home and in your children and in your marriage and in your job and in this church and we can see the supernatural i don't know what you want out of a church but that's what i want i i can't i can't account for people who just want a social gathering i can't even relate to that i that that's nauseating to me i've been in churches where just a social affair and and had to go for various reasons and oh my goodness get me out of here hallelujah that's a it's it's makes sometimes the things you see are just so now i i i i understand that people have been years under misinterpreted theology so you got to watch your attitude you got to keep your spirit right to pray in the right way but let me just say at the end of the day i'm glad that i have a church of believers i'm glad i get to preach to people who believe every word of god i can't account for the world i can't even get my mind around it anymore i've been serving god too long i've been in the presence of the sun too long and maybe it's baked my brain i hope it has i hope it's baked out all the notion of the world and put the love of god down in my heart and i hope it's putting it in your hearts god has released healing to his family and boy do we need it not just speaking physically we need it emotionally we need it mentally we need it spiritually we take our portion of the responsibility to become overcomers see there's uh yeah you just keep me in prayer i'm just just trying to follow the the lord i've got so much here that i don't want to get bogged down in i'm watching the clock and i'm determined to deliver my burden it's been on my heart for so long and and and and i and i may even i may even wait for a next installment to give you the foundation that i promised you to to show you how we got to here and uh because i feel like i'm already uh pouring out my heart and the holy spirit seems to be anointing it so we're just gonna keep going and i'll but i do wanna i do wanna back up and show you how the unfolding drama because that's what brother branham called it that's his word it's all a great to god it's a drama and and oh my if i would just take the time today to but i will and show you how we got to where we got to and that that there's nothing you know that that there's nothing accidental and there's nothing that's in disorder in god's prophecy or that or that somehow you know the world is is is spun out of control of god's word or that god has somehow let it get away from him that's that's not happened no god's not say the world's crazy it's just spun out of control god let it get away from him that's what the world thinks they're wrong they couldn't be more wrong everything is working the in fact is the exact opposite is true and and if i if i get a chance in another installment we can we can show you that through the history and through through the through what god shows us in prophecy i just feel i'm gonna skip that today uh because i i want to keep moving and you know we we have been given in this in this healing that is released to god's family it's it's very oftentimes hard say brother jason you know why do preachers just hammer at carnality and sin so much because there's no way i can get a man to a doctor unless i can join me sick you understand i can't get a man to salvation unless i can show him he's lost i have to prove it to him see and so that's why a lot of times you think you're fine and as a minister of the gospel i know you're not fine you're good you're a child of god but you're not fine and things aren't fine and and the holy spirit anoints preachers to come to a pulpit and say press harder strive let's let's move up let's let's keep pressing there's a there's a there's a mark and there's a high calling and here's the good news there's a prize hallelujah i like prizes i i like to know i haven't labored in vain i haven't ran in vain and you say i'm running for my life you're running to life hallelujah running for your life means you're running away from death and there's nothing better to do than run away from death and so we have to realize that god has sent a word in this hour so that we can take back every possession that god gave us in the garden of eden and everything he intended for us in the garden of eden said i've given you every tree i i've given you the ability brother branham said as they as they as they ate of those trees and said it he said it renewed their youth it renewed the adam and eve it renewed their youth daily and and you know they they would even go to sleep at night and father would come down and brother branham nobody can dramatize it like him he says that here he would come and he would say now children did you enjoy your day in my paradise oh yes father we learned so many things oh well now it's time to go to sleep now you've got to rest your bodies and you're going to eat of the tree it's going to renew your youth and brother ram said he would kiss them on the cheek kiss them good night tuck them in and he said he would just step back this is part of his thinking that that god looked on everything that he has had made and said well that's just that it's well it was very well so just understand friends when you're laying in your bed at night in slumber and you're asleep there's an all-seeing eye watching you and i want to know that he's standing there going this is very well this is very well this son of mine this daughter of mine this church this family this parent this young person this preacher oh it's not only good it's very good don't you don't you friends don't you want god to have that opinion of you and i you see preaching like this makes you cognizant of the fact that you're not just here you're not just a human life you know a little blip on the radar and you're just part of some you know uh part of humanity and millions and billions that have been down through the age and well what's after this and nobody knows and they got all kinds of terms for it and whatever you know the afterlife they call it and and then some of them they don't even know what if that's true and they just say well whatever's next i'm so glad i don't live in that kind of blindness i'm so glad i know what's next and since i know what's next i know where i came from and that and since i know where i'm going and where i came from then i know why i'm here and then that gives me purpose in my life and and gives me a drive to strive for these things and this is why paul would say whatsoever things are lovely and of a good report these are the things you think on him and and you know you don't you don't entertain the notions of the devil because that's gonna that's gonna harm you because he said you can eat of every tree but now there is one tree that if you eat off of it it'll kill you i've given you every tree for your life i've given you everything that you need for life to have life and more abundantly that's what jesus desire for us that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly but there's a warning there's a contrast there's an enemy lurking who wants the annihilation of this kingdom you're part of and and since the kingdom is not a geographical piece of dirt the kingdom is the people you don't have a kingdom if you don't have people and so his goal then is to destroy the people what does he care if a millennial world is here and it's going to be here what does satan care if the millennial world is here and none of god's people make it and all he's got to do is wait out the thousand years and then he gets released and then it's just all his see so so so there's there's this whole idea then of removing hindrances now let me give you an example when we talk about removing hindrances we're all aware it's not a secret that through brother eddie's gene pool i inherited a tendency to build up a cardiovascular disease and that's not it's a condition it's not like a disease like a virus or something it's a it's simply that my body produces um a lot of different things that can plug up my arteries i brother eddie was like that he had triple bypass surgery at 64. uh his mother died at 50 years old suddenly and really uh no one really understood why until we understand it now it was coming down that strain i actually thought it had skipped me until a year ago i found i had a funny little feeling and went and found i was almost dead and i was i was the doctor according to his report i was i was minutes or hours from crossing i'm glad i didn't not that i wouldn't have enjoyed being there but i wouldn't have wanted to leave you all i wouldn't wanted to leave my family i wouldn't wanted to leave my wife and my children and my grandchildren i love life but like brother branham said jesus didn't want to die he he was young he had his brother and he he loved him and he he loved life and and i'm and i i have spent many an hour thanking god for preserving me when when it when the enemy was lurking unknown no one knew that he was working undetected and and he was trying to snuff me out but what i found out was that in a realm i couldn't see angels were moving to interdict every time the devil would do it here something would happen and i caught a symptom i went to a doctor they did a test oh no you're fine all the tests looked fine all tests looked fine well let's just do one last thing and they caught it and then and then i've had to keep up with that i had to have a recent another continuing procedure and i i've had to make lifestyle adjustments because i know this that until the god is finished with me i'm immortal i know that i can't i can't be killed until god is finished with me amen neither can you hallelujah so this is what to say the devil ain't nobody listen you're you're hearing a man say that who looked in the face of death a couple of times and i'm telling you i've been to the edge and my testimony is satan ain't nobody he ain't nobody he don't run nothing but his mouth he has no jurisdiction over me or you we don't live by the mercies of lucifer we live by the mercy and the grace of jesus christ amen hallelujah so so what did they have to do to save my life they all they did was remove hindrances you understand my heart was beating strong all my organs are functioning perfect i didn't have some kind of abnormality some disease i didn't have any of that i didn't have none of that i was a healthy man but i had unknown hindrances that was that were blocking the flow of life-giving blood and so all they did they didn't go in and rebuild my heart they didn't go in and pump some some some you know some futuristic thing in me all the doctor did was go in and whoop open up and remove the hindrances and then you know what happened my body just did what it does my heart kept right on beating now blood can flow now oxygen is moving and now i'm i'm gaining my health back i'm gaining strength back i'm gaining endurance back and all i did was remove blockages you see once that happened then the divine healing that's built into me took over see so when you become willing to remove hindrances hindrances that keep you from having a fervent prayer life hindrances that limit the power of god moving through your life hindrances that block god's vision for you that he had in genesis when he says i've given you all of these things to do what for life i've given you my word so you can live i put you here and saved you from from your fallen condition and i i made you so that you're a light you know so that so that you go out into a dark world and that your your light shines and the devil wants to put that out and all he's got to do all he's got to do to interrupt god's plan in your life he can't do anything about your gene you're a gene of god you're going to believe the word you can't not believe it there's no way to not say amen because there's an alien life inside you that'll start screaming amen and it'll bring your body subject to the word and and and if you want then god will then god will god will take other means but he will bring you to his word but you know i don't want to i i regret now saying my why did i let that come on me why did i not why did i not pay attention when i was young and now i have to have doctor's intervention i got to have procedure now i got to have another procedure i got to do all these things because there's no there's no roto-rooter there's no drano to get that out all they can do is try to keep it from getting worse and they can open it up with the stents and things like that but but but there's regret within my life as much joy as i have that god that had medical science that could save my life or otherwise y'all had a different pastor but but i but but i do have a sense of regret and i said i've said to my sons and i said to my grandsons and i say to all you don't don't get there because you can't reverse it so while you're young and while you're healthy stay healthy and and make sure because i told my boys as you're aging you can't believe how hard that becomes and so you're you're healthy now stay that way because you can't reverse it you can improve your health you can improve your fitness but when it comes to cardiovascular blockages you can't reverse that he said i'm saying so so so many times i've seen in the spiritual world and people be so wonderfully gifted and so wonderfully talented and and they don't remove the hindrances in fact is they allow hindrances and satan fills up young people with hindrances and fills up homes with hindrances and fills up parents with hindrances say oh my well we're doing a pretty good job i don't deny that i don't i've already given you a medal for being a son and daughter of god but i'm here to tell you if you want to really see the power of god moving all you have to do is get rid of hindrances that's what you say well based that on scripture easy paul said that we should run the race that we should lay aside lay aside those things that so easily hinder those things that so easily beset you and run that you may run this race i want to run this race see so when you become willing to remove hindrances from your life when you're willing to take up the responsibility of emptying out then divine power will take it from there just like divine healing built into my body took over once they removed the hindrances that's all i needed to do see and i i thought to myself that god takes the best things out of our control and it's a good thing i because i don't have to spend one minute regulating the functions of my body i don't have to make the divine healing work you understand it just works because god put it in me and so all i all i need to do is regulate the intake physically emotionally mentally spiritually regulate the intake amen and exercise and that's why that's why the bible would say we're to exercise our faith you don't exercise your faith if you don't have a prayer life you never do you never do come into church coming to church friends is is where it's a house of correction you get corrected you get you learn about god you learn about the bible but i'm here to tell you something prayer is where you have the relationship and it's it's very amazing how that that that that brother branham talks about prayer and i i could go into so many examples today that prayer to a prophet was not some willingly thing it was not just saying a prayer that's almost become a cliche that's almost like you know be blessed have a nice day say a prayer and brother ram said christians don't say prayers catholics do that they say prayers we pray it's a big difference see and but the whole world is say a prayer for me you know you know uh you pass somebody yes be blessed what does that even mean okay you want me to be blessed so explain to me how do you want me to be blessed you know i'd like for you to be blessed too let me tell you how you need to you need to go home and clean up and become a real lady become a real man become a real gentleman give your heart to god repent of your sins get the holy ghost and then you'll be blessed then you'll be blessed there's no way god can bless disorder god doesn't do that he's not santa claus see and so so we find out that when you're willing to take the responsibility and empty out then divine power takes it from there and and and and when you establish order in your life then that's what god can get behind and so and that's exactly why the natural types of spiritual it's always the natural typing the spiritual it's never the other way around because the spiritual is the more real you see the natural's just a shadow so the premise of life from genesis i'm i'm i'm gonna hit my pause place here in just a few minutes you okay you okay okay i've only been going about 50 minutes so let me get these last 10 and i'll we'll push paul's stan pull the chute and jump out or jump out and pull the chute you know don't open the chute in the in the plane so the premise of life is built on the foundation that you made of every tree for sustaining your life for your youth to renew itself daily and this friends this is exactly why his mercies are new every morning and you should avail yourselves every morning of those new mercies don't pass them my goodness you're going to need them see brother branham would talk about prayer you know when uh when the when welch evans come to him and he is his car is stolen and brother branham didn't say well brother welch let's say a prayer no he said well now let's pray and if you go read the testimony you know what you're going to find brother branham thought this through he this wasn't just lord we we we love you thou great illuminating father and we hope you'll give his car back to him brother branham actually got down and presented a case he realized that on his knees he was in the throne room of god suddenly and that's where prayer takes you if you don't you know that this is often times why husbands don't treat their wives correctly because they don't they don't understand the husband wife because they don't have relationship with christ in prayer and and that's why sometimes wives don't reverence their husbands that's why homes get out of water a lot of times that's why you get homes where you know the wife is the spiritual leader which is upside down as brim or brother abraham brothers remember brother abraham teaching us that how many men are not ashamed to raise your hand remember their brother abraham was teaching us that and he takes deborah in the bible and he shows us how that you know why why did god have to have a woman because he you know why why isn't there a man somewhere that he can follow the order of his word with and and he's got to have a woman now she's not leading the church god there's a woman trying to say that to brother brandon said no that's politics deborah wasn't leading the church that but she was in politics and these men come to her and she and she's the daughter of god and she gives them a a a a prophecy and you're going to have victory go fight them go kill them that's the enemy and they said okay we'll do it but not let you go with us and here's men afraid to go into battle as the woman's leading them brother abraham broke it down how that that's an upside down home i'm here to tell you something brothers you're the spiritual head of your home not your wife and it's a shame on you if she has to be and i've seen i've seen too many sisters forced into that role and they're not designed for it and they're and they're gonna misguide the family and i've seen families run it run run shipwreck here and go over here and get shipwrecked here and go get shipwrecked here because a woman is not designed to do that i'm not saying she's not smarter a lot of times she's smarter in many things than the man which is why he's kind of crazy to not to not take her advice a lot of times i think a man's ridiculous that thinks he can figure everything out for himself why'd god she's got the other half of your wisdom man you're you're running to half speed are you kidding me and you think you can make the best choice and she's just nobody well that's stupid i'm sorry children i'm sorry sorry mothers i didn't mean to use that word i'm so sorry i don't want to get on a roll but but but but but i'm trying this is what brother abraham was showing us brothers we need to have spiritual men who know how to pray who know how to lead a family who i want to tell you something as i've said to you before and brother branham says it on tape if you'll be in abraham she'll be a sarah but he said if he won't be how can she see so we need strong men warriors of faith and warriors of prayer who take the word of god and take the leadership and take the responsibility and remove hindrances from the whole see it it's it otherwise it becomes upside down otherwise it becomes out of order and god can't bless it even if your principle is right even if your doctrine is right even if what you're saying is right if you're if it's a woman leading it then it's out of water it's contrary to god's word and there's no way god can get behind that anything that's a direct tape quote anything is there anything outside of anything anything would include everything am am i wrong anything outside of the line and order of god's word will fail that's thus saith the lord that's a prophet it will fail it has to fail because god can't bless disorder and so brother branham gets down now here's an example for you brothers he gets down on his knees and he gathers the brother with him and he starts to build a case and he says he doesn't just say oh in jesus name go get your car lord bring it back he says now lord we're here to put a case on your altar today now here's my brother lord he's poor he drives 15 hours every sunday just to be in church he he's he's worked with his hands he's he he's got you know knots and blisters where he's a mechanic and and lord he has a hard life and and and this is the life you have for him and but he's faithful and he's loyal and brother branham goes into a lot of detail he's laying out a case because he knows he's talking to someone and he's giving the lord a case to consider like hezekiah turned over and said lord and he began to pour out his case and i i've served you faithfully and i can't get my home in order in that amount of time and lord you you're a merciful god and and and god considered his case and thought about it and said okay i'll add this many years to your life and and and brother branham goes into detail lord now here's some some evil person has come you you think brother branham is saying anything to god god don't know but if you're gonna if you're gonna if you're gonna operate like that then you might as well just look up and go you know thank you is that prayer say hold on i gotta go pray you know okay no he god of course god knew but god wants your involvement he wants it he wants it to be a union he wants you to pour out your case he wants you to realize you're talking to him you've lifted yourself up into another atmosphere he does the same thing when the brother they're in florida they're fishing and he gets snake bit and brother branham doesn't just reach down and go in the name of jesus christ i rebuke this this poison you know what he does he gets down and he starts talking now lord now we're way back here in the wilderness and i can't pack this man out lord he's twice my size and we're so far from medical help lord and we're just trying to fish and enjoy nature and the devil has come and now my brother's laying here in agony and i mean brother branham goes into this whole deep narrative telling god everything he already knows and and now lord we we we kind of have an emergency and what we need you we need you to come like right now right now because i can't get him out of here and it's too far anyway and so lord we got kind of like an emergency i need you to come right now and brother branham goes into this detail and he says when he when he opened his eyes he said the brother's laughing at him said brother bill he said even the pain is gone even the pain is gone and just like that god kept his promise they'll take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it won't even hurt them but i'm here to tell you it took a man who knew how to pray it took a man who knew how to approach the throne of god it took a man who had spent a lifetime moving hindrances out of his life so the so the anointing could flow so the spirituality could could saturate his mind he could speak according to the word of god i'm here to tell you friends the world is is burning down around us and it's ready for a tribulation and a bride is ready to go home but while we're here god wants victory in my life and he wants victory in your life and he has released a healing to his bride the world is in a sickness it's in a disease a state of disease and and insanity and it's all neurotic and gone crazy and there's everything's upside down and families are blown apart and kids you know seven eight years old don't even know if they're a boy or a girl and and and and the sanctity of marriage is gone and and everybody's dismissing god the only one who can help the book of revelation said they would do that see so from that perfect life we come to the end of six thousand years of human history from genesis to revelation and the earth is ready now to plunge into judgment it's ready to renew itself and there's a the the earth is saturated with voices so many talking heads and so much polarization and and nobody's even listening anymore and man has just gone crazy and you know the whole atmosphere is is just saturated with opinions and and you know when god decided to send a voice into the earth to sin now i'm not talking about the gospel trumpet the gospel trumpet john said i heard one speaking sounded like a trumpet to the whole world moses on mount sinai you know the bible says the trumpet sounded and it whacks louder and louder and louder so i'm not talking about that i'm talking about that that when moses met him personally at the burning bush god didn't god didn't shout at distance hey come up here moses actually saw it and said i will turn aside and i will go see and by the time he got there it's not loud it's not shouting nobody down through the canyon nobody's still hearing it it's not a trumpet blast it's god saying no moses you're coming near don't come near until you take your shoes off this is holy ground which meant moses is coming near see and so it's it shows how it i mean elijah knew to wait for it when god when god god's remedy in a world where everybody's shouting and voices of every kind to give you your opinion they ask you a question and give you your answer to which i tell them you can ask me the question but you don't get to give me my answer you want to know what i think i will tell you but don't ask me and give me my give me my answer i've had people try to do that in my in my office coming for council and they give me a question and tell me the answer like why why are you here you know i already know you don't want to hear my answer you got your own and i know where this is going to go i know it's going to go 30 years have taught me where that's going to go i've seen it too many times i've never i've never seen it fail where people can't humble themselves as as paul talks about you know you know that don't don't make it and i'm paraphrasing the scripture don't make it hard on the ministry who god has put over you don't be worrisome to them humble yourself submit god has put them there for your soul god has put them there to guide you see and and and and and so i mean if if you're if you're going to be your own pastor why do you need one see so so so and i'm not even preaching on that today i'm just trying to i'm trying to get us to remove hindrances and some of the some of the let me tell you something friends some of the you know i i just i i i hate to think that you know your greatest hindrance lives between your two ears seen that too many times you know and that's not the way god designed our lives to be so you've got all these loud voices but when god brought his voice he brought it small and still by design elijah knew to wait on that and there's something to be said about having your spiritual sensitivity so unhindered so unshacked so unpoisoned say i i can't hardly hear god oh well get all the toxins out say well i'd like to do that but every time i every time i repent uh they come back to me well then get what's bringing them out get what you're feeding on this ain't rocket science get what you're feeding on out and it'll stop re-poisoning you how many i i mean i've experienced that where i went to the lord and the lord delivered me and i was free and then found myself back sometime later asking for the same thing and the lord just like you know this is gonna keep happening until you get that gone and that's where we are precious friends this this 21st century is full of stuff that poisons your spirit and your mind and your children and and don't don't think they'll be okay they won't be okay you're not okay and we'll never be okay as a church we gotta i just say let's take a stand for god's word and let's be real christians let's be real believers and then we can go to god and it doesn't matter nothing can stand in the way of our prayer [Applause] but we move these hindrances and then god can speak draw not an nigh hither put off thy shoes from thy feet let me give you this and i'll stop anthony come bring your team brother anthony this word nigh draw not nigh hither this is of course an action word it's a verb meaning to come near or to approach now don't let your attention this is just brothers and sisters coming to their instruments it's not a eighth wonder of the world okay pay attention it means to draw near it means to approach the basic concept of drawing nigh is is close spatial proximity of the subject and the object and although it is also possible for this word to introduce actual contact the the verb is also used in a temporal context to indicate the imminence of some event and i if there was ever a time when i can say to you there's an event that is imminent the the coming of the lord is imminent it's upon us if there was ever a time when you need to draw nigh and his promise is if you'll draw nigh to me i'll draw nigh to you could you think of anything better than to have a subject which is you and an object which is god coming together hallelujah friends that's the that's the real burden of my heart for today that god has sent a healing god has sent a remedy and what's it to do is it to teach you more doctrine no it's not limited to that is it to make you have better theology no it's not it's not all about that it's about an invisible union it's about a closeness it's about a it's about a a subject and an object coming together how many want to draw nigh unto him there's there's there's no way that that that is going to work alongside of hindrances and so i want to say to you today take the medicine take the healing get rid of the hindrances let god restore and renew and strengthen and build up your faith and exercise it thereof this is what god has offered to you and i even in a world that has gone completely and totally and effectively insane stand with me a world that has went off a cliff and over the edge and don't forget my my very beginning to show you that satan's whole motive and objective is to displace the holy spirit in your life you remember that today when you leave here when you go home when you get up tomorrow on the job when you go into schools or to the market or to the work or wherever you go you just remember that satan has a beat on you and he's his whole attempt is to displace god from the throne room of your heart so that he can have preeminence and that's why brother branham would say however much you're willing to empty out he said god is willing to come in and fill that place i i'm so glad i can come here today and though we can paint a dismal picture of the world i can tell you there's healing there's a medicine there's a medicine that not only can heal you but it has the power to inoculate you from further infection oh my i wish they had a wish they had a vaccination like this one my this one is free hallelujah and it works every time and it works for your whole life if you'll follow its principles if you will if you'll remove hindrances from your life it'll work automatically because this is an omnipotent your gene is an omnipotent and that's why brother branham said it's two omnipotents meet and when that happens friend life life comes forth is that what you want today amen bow your heads with me as we pray and i'm just gonna have to pause there's so much more to be said lord i thank you for your word today and as i stand here lord in the pulpit at this present moment standing here i feel satisfied that we can stop right here i feel satisfied that enough has been said i feel satisfied in what was said now i when i say i feel satisfied lord i feel your satisfaction in it all that therefore i'm satisfied if i didn't feel you were satisfied i wouldn't be satisfied but lord i feel that everything that was said today was set under the unction of the holy spirit and i'm quite positive that you always do you're always dealing with things that even i have no idea even why it said or barely remember what i said somebody said why did you say this i said i don't know okay well tell me what i said and then even when i hear what i said i'm not even remember why i said it lord but i know that you're a god in charge of all of our lives and you understand that the real me boy am i glad for that you understand the real me so lord it's quite an easy thing for me just to throw up my hands and say lord just take over just take over because you know me better than me you know me better than anybody you know what i need you know what i'm missing you know what i'm slacking you know what you know what my strengths are my weaknesses are my gifts are my talents are you build me i'm curiously made by you so lord why why would i not surrender my life to the all-knowing all-seeing all-powerful being who is the genesis of it all i commit myself to you today i commit this audience i commit the invisible audience who we're listening today i commit us all men and women married and single young and old father all throughout throughout everyone under the sound of my voice lord now all i can do is put the word out there follow your leading and drop the word lord as the as boaz in the image of in the in the uh the bible imagery of christ said to the servants drop handfuls of purpose for for ruth lord that's all i've done today at your command i've dropped these handfuls of purpose for your children but lord now you're the one who it was boaz who drew her into the tent it was boaz who reached her parched corn from his hand to her hand so lord now i pray that today you'll take the word that was said i feel satisfied in my heart that it was you i committed to you now in jesus christ's name amen amen you love the lord amen let's sing a song or two they're the glory oh yes and the other and the on earth do you agree with that lord i lift my hands in worship as i praise your holy name you deserve you deserve the glory and the honor and the honor hallelujah lord i lift my hands in worship as i praise your holy for you are for you are great oh yes you do me recall so great there is no one else like you [Music] there is no one else like you for you are great you do miracle so grace there is no one else like you there is no one else like [Music] oh you deserve it lord and the honor let's raise our hands lord i lift my hands in worship as i praise your holy name you deserve the glory lord you deserve it today and the honor lord i lift my hands in worship as i praise your holy name you are great you're great you do miracles so great [Music] [Music] so great there is no one else like you there is no one else like you you love him you love the lord he's worthy of all of our praise and all of our honor to tell you something friends he's worthy of dedicating your life to him he's worthy of getting you out of the way you getting you out of the way don't don't don't i know it sounds comical don't let your hindrance be don't let your hand your greatest hindrance live between your ears don't do that the world does that that's why they can't hear god because they can't get over their own upside down thinking and and and and we're here to say to humble ourselves brother branham talks about that the that the real spirit that's all that's that's to be on his family at the end time you know what it is you know where it starts is to say i'm wrong i'm wrong that's the quickest way to get god's attention is when you will raise your hands in his presence and say lord i'm wrong and i've been wrong and i don't want to be wrong hallelujah friends oh as paul said you did run well what hindered you you did run well galatians what hindered you who bewitched you that you've left these principles that i saved your life on oh you want to raise up those hands today and say lord i'm i've been wrong and i don't want to be wrong i want to be right i want to have your blessing on my life i want to remove the hindrances from my life i want to march forward in victory i want to forget what i think and forget forget what the devil says and and lord dismiss those things from my mind and think on your word and think on your promise and think on the healing that you have given in this day lord that healing can only help those people who will take it if they won't take the medication then they can't get the benefits and brother brandon would say father he would say people say oh i said brother branham i took the medicine he said no you didn't oh no i did i know i no you didn't he said because i happen to know that the medicine cures that problem and i still see you with the same problem i know you didn't take it so father help us today help us as i lean into that lord feeling driven in my spirit to just lean into it one more time before dismissing this audience god has provided healing god has provided direction god has provided order god has given us the holy ghost god has given us his word he's opened it to us let us avail ourselves of everything that he has given to us grant it to us today lord we commit this audience into your hands dismissing them in the name of jesus christ we don't dismiss them from your presence go with them lord be with them throughout the day in the afternoon and in their homes and at night and tomorrow the next day and the next day bring us back together lord god one of these mornings is going to be our last morning lord and we don't know when that morning will be either might be the end of all mornings for us individually or it might be the end of every morning for your bride around the world whichever comes first i want to
