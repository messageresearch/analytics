[0:01] has cruel markings
[0:04] and scourgings
[0:06] yay moreover bonds
[0:08] and imprisonment
[0:09] he like what that i thought hebrews 11
[0:12] is the faith chapter
[0:14] that's exactly right it is but god let
[0:17] us know in the beginning
[0:19] what faith did
[0:21] to stop things
[0:23] but then he dropped it right down in the
[0:26] back and the end part he also let you
[0:28] know what faith can do while you're
[0:30] going through things
[0:34] the ones that were sought asunder
[0:37] cruel markings
[0:38] they had the same faith of the one that
[0:41] stopped the mouth of lion quenched the
[0:43] violence of fire
[0:45] see sometimes god
[0:47] stops faith can stop things
[0:49] but also faith can keep you while you're
[0:51] going through things
[0:54] so don't get discouraged when hard times
[0:56] come just keep pressing on
[0:59] amen
[1:00] you know
[1:01] brother branham said that the first
[1:03] doctrine jesus ever preached
[1:06] was you must be born again
[1:08] and when i heard him say that i said if
[1:10] that be truth which i believe it is
[1:12] i said uh i ought to be able to find
[1:14] that in genesis
[1:16] and i found that in genesis
[1:19] the birth
[1:20] the new birth is actually preached in
[1:22] genesis chapter one
[1:24] and uh and i always want to try to build
[1:26] my way up to something
[1:28] when and when we talk about earth
[1:31] we got to remember the prophet god said
[1:33] when god was creating the earth
[1:36] he also had your bodies in mind because
[1:38] that's why our bodies come from
[1:40] it comes from the dust of the ground
[1:43] and i began to look at in the book of
[1:45] genesis
[1:47] how that god did these things he had us
[1:49] in mind
[1:50] now in isaiah 45 it says
[1:54] for thus says the lord that created the
[1:56] heavens
[1:57] god himself that fallen to earth and
[1:59] made it
[2:00] he has established it
[2:03] he created it not in vain he found it to
[2:06] be inhabited now when i read that
[2:09] scripture i think of natural
[2:11] and spiritual because we are earth god
[2:14] created us will earth he did not create
[2:17] the earth in vain
[2:19] he created the earth so that it would be
[2:21] inhabited
[2:22] so when i read that scripture i said he
[2:25] did not create me in vain
[2:27] he created me to be inhabited
[2:29] inhabited by what him
[2:33] god want to live in us that's why jesus
[2:35] said me and the father we want to make
[2:37] our abode in you you look that word in a
[2:40] bold up it means permanent residence
[2:45] god want a house
[2:48] hello god don't want rental property
[2:53] he won't bought property
[2:55] that he purchased himself
[2:57] can we say man you know when you got a
[2:59] rental house with someone you get old
[3:01] enough get married get a house
[3:03] when you got a rental house
[3:05] uh you'll do things to it you'll paint
[3:08] it but i promise you because it's a
[3:10] rental house you're gonna get cheap
[3:12] paint
[3:14] you're gonna put cheap stuff in it
[3:16] because it's not yours you say well i'm
[3:18] just going to do a little something in
[3:19] it but i it ain't mine so why put my
[3:21] best in it
[3:24] amen but now when you buy your own
[3:28] you're going to want to put the best in
[3:29] that house
[3:31] that right you're gonna get the high
[3:32] grade paint and uh good material you
[3:34] want the best in the house can we say
[3:36] praise the lord but you ain't gonna do
[3:38] too much to a rental vessel
[3:41] but you wanna bought house to do
[3:43] whatever you wanna do in it and if that
[3:45] be the case god won't bought houses that
[3:48] he purchased himself that's why he want
[3:50] to invest things in it
[3:52] come and say praise the lord
[3:54] you see
[3:55] gifts and callings is without repentance
[3:58] people can have a lot of gifts and do a
[4:00] lot of things and wonderful things and
[4:02] still not make it to heaven
[4:05] can we say amen see judas is carried
[4:07] judas is carrying it was rental property
[4:12] balaam was rental property
[4:14] huh
[4:15] god used them but paul was bought
[4:18] property
[4:19] so god invested more and i'm here to
[4:22] tell you you are not rental property
[4:25] you've been practiced by the blood of
[4:27] jesus christ and god will invest
[4:29] everything inside of you
[4:32] amen
[4:34] he said he created the earth
[4:37] it was without form
[4:38] and darkness was upon the face of the
[4:40] deep there was no shape it was no form
[4:43] there was no order
[4:45] actually that's you and me when you came
[4:48] out of your mother's womb
[4:51] praise the lord that's right the same
[4:53] way he done the earth it's the same
[4:55] thing he'd done to you and me
[4:57] and then it said and darkness
[4:59] was upon the face of the deep you and i
[5:01] was born in darkness
[5:04] we was born in sin shaping iniquity we
[5:07] come in this world liar do you realize
[5:09] the very moment you come out of your
[5:11] mama's womb you was a little liar
[5:16] everything inside of you to do wrong was
[5:18] right there inside of you nobody had to
[5:20] teach you you know it's amazing nobody
[5:22] got to teach you how to do wrong
[5:25] it automatically comes because it's the
[5:27] nature that we was born with
[5:29] can we say praise the lord but you know
[5:32] god was not worried how the condition of
[5:34] the earth was looking at that time
[5:36] without form and in darkness that wasn't
[5:39] bothering god because god knew what lay
[5:41] beneath
[5:44] can we say amen god knew what was down
[5:46] there so god had to do some things that
[5:49] the things that was planted down there
[5:51] he wanted them to grow god said i need
[5:53] to do some things and what did he do
[5:55] amen the bible tells us in genesis
[5:58] darkness went upon the face of the deep
[6:00] and remember all of the seeds and things
[6:02] down the land they couldn't grow
[6:04] they needed that sunlight to come so
[6:06] they could grow but what did god do
[6:08] first the bible tells us even though it
[6:11] was looking in that type of situation
[6:13] but before anything could change the way
[6:16] god wanted the spirit of god had to move
[6:21] hey man
[6:23] the earth state would have stayed in
[6:24] that same kind of shape but when the
[6:26] spirit of god moved things started to
[6:29] happen
[6:30] the same thing with you and me you could
[6:32] come to church after service after
[6:34] service after service amen after service
[6:37] got the service but ain't nothing gonna
[6:39] happen to you in your life until the
[6:41] spirit of god come and move in your life
[6:44] then it begins to bring changes
[6:49] amen
[6:50] the same thing god did to the earth when
[6:52] the spirit of god moved when the spirit
[6:54] of god moved the bible tells us amen
[6:57] i'm sorry and then verse 3 said and god
[7:00] said let there be light
[7:02] see amen you can sit in service after
[7:05] service but when god's spirit began to
[7:07] move upon you the words now no longer
[7:10] just become words
[7:12] sermons just don't become servant they
[7:13] become light to you now you begin to be
[7:16] able to see
[7:19] amen praise the lord and then the
[7:21] beautiful thing about it he said let
[7:23] there be light and there was like now
[7:25] you're coming to church you're coming
[7:27] into service and it began to mean more
[7:29] to you
[7:30] and the thing that i love about the most
[7:32] in this scripture the bible said god saw
[7:35] the light that it was good and then god
[7:37] divided the light from the darkness that
[7:39] the same thing you'll be going through
[7:40] in patterns in your life when the spirit
[7:43] of god move upon you you come to church
[7:45] you're hearing the word the word becomes
[7:47] light and then the bible says he
[7:49] separate light from darkness you'll get
[7:51] to a place in your life you don't have
[7:53] to be rebuked
[7:56] huh there's a scripture in the bible
[7:58] amen something says i i get tired of
[8:01] coming to church getting rebuked getting
[8:02] corrected but there's a scripture in the
[8:04] bible where you can come to church and
[8:06] not get rebuked
[8:08] and the bible said that he that is
[8:09] spiritual judges himself
[8:12] amen when you judge yourself correct
[8:14] yourself and you're wrong when you come
[8:16] to church god won't rebuke you because
[8:18] you already took the word yourself and
[8:21] corrected yourself
[8:24] if you're tired of getting rebuked stop
[8:26] doing the wrong thing
[8:28] do the right thing then you won't get
[8:30] reviewed because judgment begins at the
[8:32] house of god
[8:37] praise the lord
[8:40] see
[8:43] the message is grace
[8:45] it's also judgment
[8:48] it spans everything
[8:50] redemption compassion judgment grace
[8:53] everything is in the message
[8:55] i don't try to pick one spot and stay on
[8:57] one spot what the message is i take it
[8:59] for exactly the way it is the way the
[9:01] prophet of god brought it
[9:04] he say things
[9:06] amen he say things and it'd be
[9:08] judgmental correction but all of it's
[9:11] out of love
[9:14] can we say man
[9:15] listen to this
[9:17] i want to read this mess
[9:19] from investment
[9:22] to me he gives a warning
[9:24] he says
[9:25] if you got something in your heart
[9:28] for god
[9:30] and you won't express it
[9:32] and so forth and just keep putting it
[9:35] off
[9:36] well later on
[9:38] later on you know keep putting it off he
[9:40] said that little desire
[9:43] you once had to serve god will be taken
[9:47] from you
[9:49] i didn't say that he said and i believe
[9:51] it
[9:53] praise the lord you know sometimes
[9:54] people say well the prophet said it they
[9:56] just want to throw it off of them no he
[9:58] said it and i'm saying what he said and
[10:00] i believe what he said
[10:04] he said the devil will come
[10:07] in and steal that away and then you
[10:10] won't have a desire to serve him
[10:13] so that's a warning
[10:15] when god dealing with your heart don't
[10:17] keep pushing it off pushing it off i'm
[10:19] going to get right into it i'm going to
[10:20] get right i'm going to get right no
[10:22] receiving right at that moment when he's
[10:24] dealing with you
[10:25] don't let the devil come and steal that
[10:27] from you
[10:29] he did so if you have the least desire
[10:33] not a big desire
[10:35] the least desire he said there must be
[10:38] something that
[10:40] he talking to these businessmen he said
[10:42] there must be something even brought you
[10:44] to this breakfast this morning there is
[10:46] something faith come by hearing hearing
[10:48] of the word and there must be some
[10:50] desire or you wouldn't even be here so i
[10:53] believe how many of you desire to be
[10:55] here
[10:57] that's god pulling on you he says in the
[11:00] mess of christ the mystery god revealed
[11:02] he said why do you hunger
[11:07] he the church why do you thirst
[11:10] he said it's the father trying to reveal
[11:14] this hidden secret to you
[11:17] but you let so many things get it out of
[11:20] you
[11:20] you let your job you let your wife you
[11:23] let your husband you let your children
[11:26] you let the cares of the world
[11:28] you let some pastor
[11:30] you let somebody else get that out of
[11:32] you when you know that way down in your
[11:35] heart you're thirsting it's hung and
[11:37] hungry is god trying to reveal to you
[11:40] the revelation the last days is here
[11:43] see he laying things out where things
[11:45] can happen to try to pull things from
[11:47] you
[11:48] it can be family it can be friends
[11:52] it can be husband it can be wife
[11:55] when god trying to deal with you and
[11:57] distractions come but i believe brother
[11:59] and sister we need to do like we
[12:00] preached the other morning when the
[12:02] devil wanted to bring something to you
[12:04] tell him no deal
[12:06] can we say praise the lord
[12:08] all right
[12:12] in the message identification
[12:16] i really love this quote
[12:18] he said i'm sure tonight
[12:21] that we ought to find ourselves
[12:24] somewhere
[12:25] in some character
[12:27] of the bible
[12:31] so that we would know the outcome
[12:34] of that character
[12:36] and know what our outcome would be
[12:40] what that means when you're going
[12:41] through something find some character in
[12:43] the bible that's going through what
[12:46] you're going through see what their
[12:47] outcome is
[12:49] then you'll be able to see what your
[12:51] outcome will be
[12:53] praise the lord i read that quote right
[12:56] there because he said find the character
[12:59] so i want to deal with a character
[13:01] called asaph
[13:02] there's so many that we can deal with
[13:04] but i want to deal with him uh
[13:06] especially deal with him but to do that
[13:09] i want to paint you a picture about a
[13:12] self we read in psalm 73 about a self
[13:16] but let's go backwards
[13:19] to see who this man is
[13:21] are you with me first chronicles 6.
[13:24] let's go to verse 31
[13:29] it said in these
[13:31] are they whom david set over the service
[13:33] of the song
[13:34] in the house of the lord
[13:36] after the ark had rested
[13:40] they ministered before the dwelling
[13:41] place of the tabernacle of the
[13:43] congregation with singing
[13:45] until solomon had built the house of the
[13:46] lord in jerusalem
[13:48] and they waited on their office
[13:50] according to their order
[13:52] verse 33 says
[13:54] and these are they that waited
[13:56] with their children
[13:59] of the sons of the carnage hermits and
[14:01] singers and the son of joel and the son
[14:04] of shemio notice saying they waited with
[14:07] their children so it's going to start
[14:09] naming one different ones that was able
[14:12] to even minister before the ark of the
[14:14] covenant
[14:15] and it's going to just bring it you're
[14:16] going to bring it down now drop with me
[14:19] to verse 38 i'm going to do a bunch of
[14:20] jumping but i want to paint a picture
[14:23] it said the sons of isaac the son of
[14:25] cohas the son of levi and the son of
[14:28] israel and his brother
[14:30] asaph
[14:32] now he's bringing asaph on the scene the
[14:36] one that we read in psalm 73
[14:39] see i just stopped at the first verse
[14:41] just to mention asaph's name but i'm
[14:43] taking you back to show you the position
[14:46] that this man had a man in the economy
[14:48] of god
[14:50] and he said his brother asaph who stood
[14:53] on his right hand even asap the son of
[14:55] baraka
[14:57] shemia now let's turn to first
[14:59] chronicles 15.
[15:07] excuse me for going a little fast but be
[15:09] a limited time here
[15:11] first chronicles 15.
[15:14] it said david we're gonna go to verse
[15:16] one david made him houses in the city of
[15:19] david and prepared a place for the ark
[15:21] of god
[15:22] pitch for a tent
[15:24] and david said none ought to carry the
[15:26] ark of god but the levites
[15:28] for them that the lord chosen to carry
[15:30] the ark of god and to minister into it
[15:33] forever
[15:34] david gather all israel together to
[15:36] jerusalem to bring up the ark of the
[15:38] lord to his place
[15:40] which he had prepared for it now i want
[15:43] to jump down to verse 11.
[15:45] and david call for zadok a b athena the
[15:48] priest and the levites uriel aci joel
[15:52] shemia eliot and at minidad he said unto
[15:55] them you are the chief of the fathers of
[15:58] the levites sanctify yourself both you
[16:00] and your brethren i'm just reading these
[16:02] things uh you know
[16:04] now when we talk about the art of the
[16:06] covenant
[16:07] you have to understand that was
[16:09] extremely important to the children of
[16:11] israel the ark of the covenant
[16:13] represents the word the ark of the
[16:15] covenant represents christ so that's
[16:18] nothing likely to be played with
[16:21] it was serious to them amen praise the
[16:23] lord so now we're just setting up
[16:25] something verse 13. he said before
[16:28] because you did not at first the lord of
[16:30] god made a breach between us that we
[16:32] sought him not after the new order you
[16:35] remember when they brought the ark the
[16:36] levites then carried some innocent men
[16:38] lost their lives so david showing the
[16:41] importance of this ark you don't touch
[16:43] it anybody can't touch it
[16:46] you can't handle it any kind of way
[16:48] you got to respect it that's the same as
[16:51] christ you got you can't approach him
[16:52] any kind of way
[16:54] you got to respect him you got to
[16:55] reverence him you got to honor him you
[16:57] just can't come up with an attitude like
[16:59] cain
[17:00] hey man cain had an attitude take what i
[17:02] got and i'll leave it and the prophet
[17:04] god said god left it
[17:06] we can't bring god anything we got to
[17:08] approach him the right way
[17:12] amen let's go down to verse 16.
[17:15] david speaking to the chiefs of the
[17:16] levites to appoint their brother and to
[17:19] be singles with instruments of music
[17:21] plastering hearts and symbols sounding
[17:24] by lifting up the voice with joy notice
[17:27] he appointing people to be able to play
[17:30] in front of the ark that's a serious
[17:33] position even just playing music
[17:36] he putting them there think about the
[17:38] ones he put in there i don't think they
[17:40] just said well look at me he chose me
[17:43] what do you want me to do no i think
[17:45] they was thankful
[17:48] oh
[17:49] i got a position
[17:51] to play in front of the ark they was
[17:53] very humble at their approach to these
[17:56] things
[17:57] amen listen what he says
[17:59] verse 17
[18:00] so the levites appointed hemium the son
[18:03] of joel and his brethren
[18:06] asaph he comes up again the son of
[18:08] baraka and the sons of maria their
[18:10] brother ethan the son of kushaya now
[18:14] notice it put he's showing who he
[18:16] appointed to amen to play in front of
[18:19] the ark a south now go to verse 19.
[18:23] so the singers haman asap and ethan were
[18:27] appointed to sound symbols with uh
[18:30] symbols of brass and showing their
[18:32] position how they was appointed amen
[18:35] just keep following when we're building
[18:36] a picture now go to chapter 16.
[18:45] verse one
[18:47] so they brought the uncle god
[18:49] set it in the midst of the tent
[18:51] with david had pitched for it and they
[18:53] offered birth sacrifices and peace
[18:55] offerings before god
[18:58] verse 4
[18:59] and he appointed certain of the levites
[19:01] to minister before the ark of the lord
[19:03] and to record and to thank and praise
[19:06] the lord god of israel now notice verse
[19:09] 5
[19:10] it said an asaph
[19:14] the chief
[19:17] so in other words
[19:19] when he first called in asaphenyl it was
[19:21] just asap asaph asaf but now he's
[19:26] calling asap the chief
[19:29] so now he's been elevated in his office
[19:32] to be
[19:33] chief
[19:35] amen
[19:36] that's important mean leader
[19:38] chief a leader the one to be in the
[19:40] forefront he placed a south there
[19:45] and then next to him zechariah jl
[19:48] shimmer martha
[19:50] and just skip on down and uh i want to
[19:52] just with plasterings and with hearts
[19:55] he said but asaph made a sound with
[19:58] symbols he's the chief now
[20:00] got to verse 7.
[20:03] he already remained asap the chief
[20:06] which is a very important position in
[20:09] rome now look what david does
[20:12] amen let's go down to verse
[20:15] seven this first chronicles 16 7. he
[20:18] said then on that day
[20:20] david delivered
[20:22] first
[20:23] this sum to thank the lord
[20:26] in the hands of asap and his brethren
[20:30] think about that king david don't wrote
[20:33] a song
[20:35] now he don't wrote the psalm
[20:37] now he's walking up to asap
[20:40] and finally put it in asap's hand
[20:42] how do you think asap fell
[20:45] i'm pretty sure he would like
[20:47] when david says hey self

[20:53] amen i can see yourself
[20:55] thank you

[21:17] for king
[21:19] david
[21:20] look at the importance get it straight
[21:22] from the king
[21:23] that's how we ought to feel about the
[21:25] message
[21:26] this message that we believe comes
[21:28] straight from the throne of god
[21:31] that's why we have to reverse it and be
[21:32] so thankful and be careful how we think
[21:34] about it
[21:36] amen follow with me
[21:38] go down to verse 37.
[21:42] so he left there before the ark of the
[21:43] covenant
[21:45] of the lord
[21:46] let me read that again so he left there
[21:49] before the ark of the covenant of the
[21:51] lord
[21:52] asaph and his brethren
[21:54] to minister before the ark continually
[21:57] as every day's work required
[22:01] other word asaph was a man that was
[22:04] constantly
[22:05] in the work of god in the things of god
[22:08] he was always there
[22:10] what a man can we say what a man
[22:14] what a position what a place to be
[22:16] placed in oh my my praise the lord amen
[22:20] let me just go read now turn to first
[22:22] chronicles 25.
[22:35] first chronicles 25 moreover david verse
[22:38] one more over david and the captains of
[22:40] the whole separated to the service
[22:43] of the sons of asaph and herman and
[22:45] judah who should prophesy with hearts
[22:47] with plasteries with symbols and the
[22:49] normal of workmen according to their
[22:52] service boss
[22:53] verse 2
[22:54] of the sons of asaph he began to give
[22:57] their names he said then it says the
[22:59] sons of a self under the hands of a self
[23:02] which prophesied according to the order
[23:04] of the king so everything
[23:06] they keep showing you
[23:08] they was under a south
[23:10] asia had a very important role as a
[23:14] leader
[23:16] this is the asap we read in psalms 73.
[23:22] are you with me so far
[23:24] now let's go back to psalm 73
[23:34] you get it say amen
[23:42] it starts out a psalm
[23:45] of asaph
[23:47] other words he wrote this
[23:51] he gonna one thing we're gonna find
[23:53] about asaph
[23:55] he we found he's a a very influential
[23:59] person
[24:00] in a position
[24:02] but we're gonna find some things about
[24:04] him that we wouldn't have known if he
[24:05] never wrote it
[24:08] are you with me
[24:09] it says a psalm of asaph
[24:12] he starts off truly
[24:14] god is good to
[24:16] israel even to such as our of a clean
[24:22] heart
[24:23] he's giving god praise
[24:25] showing how good god is
[24:28] are you with me
[24:29] now verse 2.
[24:32] he said but as for me
[24:36] my feet was almost gone
[24:39] my steps had well now slipped
[24:44] that's interesting there's a change
[24:47] he's saying otherwise i'm almost
[24:49] finished
[24:50] but what would make a man say something
[24:52] like this
[24:53] with such a position now talking about
[24:56] his feet is almost finished slip he's
[24:58] almost gone what would make a man say
[25:00] something like that
[25:03] listen what he says
[25:06] for i was envious
[25:08] at the foolish
[25:10] when i saw the prosperity of the wicked
[25:15] this man had everything
[25:18] planned before the ark of the covenant
[25:20] placed in a position
[25:22] but now his eyes don't change let me put
[25:26] it to you in plain words looking at the
[25:29] world
[25:32] what would you say about a man like that
[25:35] what's wrong with you
[25:37] you got such a position in the play and
[25:39] now you're gonna let the world shake you
[25:41] wouldn't you say that
[25:43] brother what's going on in your mind
[25:45] thinking like that what's wrong with
[25:46] asap that's what we would say about him
[25:49] with such a position they're gonna let
[25:50] the be envious at the wicked
[25:53] that's why i say about people amen when
[25:55] god don't call you into this message and
[25:57] you don't let something like the world
[25:59] pull you away from it
[26:05] you crazy we gonna lead
[26:06] you're gonna leave christ you're gonna
[26:08] need the word what is wrong people are
[26:10] losing their minds
[26:12] but asaph was letting the world looking
[26:15] at what the world had
[26:17] and didn't let it pull him
[26:22] all right let's keep reading
[26:26] verse four
[26:28] for there are no beings in their death
[26:30] but their strength is firm i want you to
[26:32] learn something about this scripture i'm
[26:34] sure you don't read it before
[26:36] but what you're gonna learn about this
[26:37] scripture
[26:38] well asaph
[26:40] because he's looking being envious of
[26:42] the wicked
[26:44] whenever you do things like that look at
[26:46] the world
[26:47] the next thing the devil will do in your
[26:49] life make you compare church with the
[26:52] world
[26:54] he'll put you in comparison mode
[26:58] this is what happened to asaph
[27:00] listen what he said now when he's when
[27:02] you see the word there
[27:05] there when he say there there he's
[27:07] speaking of the world
[27:09] then i think he's going to talk about
[27:10] dave he's going to speak of church
[27:12] people all right notice now he said
[27:15] there are no bears in their death but
[27:17] their strength is firm
[27:19] now they are not in trouble
[27:21] as other men
[27:23] neither are they plagued like other man
[27:26] now they and there he's speaking of the
[27:28] world but who is other man
[27:32] the other man is church people
[27:36] he comparing the world with church
[27:39] people are y'all with me this morning
[27:42] keep following with me
[27:47] he said verse 5

[27:52] neither are they playing like other man
[27:55] you know what that devil he's something
[27:57] else

[28:10] having a good time having fun but me
[28:13] plagued
[28:15] can't express myself can't be free
[28:17] played
[28:21] see when you get in that shape
[28:23] the devil becomes your minister
[28:28] and he talks and he's got some good
[28:30] sermons
[28:31] and all of his sermons is based upon
[28:34] reason
[28:36] that's exactly right you remember the
[28:38] prophet of god said reason he said
[28:40] that's how the devil was successful and
[28:42] getting eve he said he's also successful
[28:44] today with the same thing reasoning
[28:49] are you with me
[28:51] let's keep going on
[28:54] verse seven
[28:55] they all stand out with fatness they
[28:58] have more than heart wish he's breaking
[29:01] a comparison again oh they got
[29:03] everything in the world they got the
[29:05] entertainment everything to make you
[29:06] happy and so forth he just said they're
[29:08] just some happy people

[29:18] heavens
[29:19] their tongue walks through the earth he
[29:21] talks about how the world is have you
[29:23] ever seen the time of a generation

[29:30] no fear no conscience of god they'll say
[29:33] anything

[29:44] bad about god something that shook me i
[29:46] said man don't say that

[29:50] but today people don't care one thing
[29:53] that people don't got no reverence for
[29:54] god no more thanks to hollywood to
[29:56] comedians and things like that making
[29:58] jokes about god to people that don't
[30:00] really care like look at god as he's a

[40:08] all that he done for me and brought me
[40:10] this far and i i'm even mad at the
[40:13] thought of thinking that
[40:15] this is where asaf is at
[40:17] i can't believe i got this far
[40:19] but i'm so thankful god pulled him back

[41:31] were going through all of this hard time
[41:33] thinking wrong god was right there who
[41:36] do you think being with you all alone

[41:58] we did not come here
[42:00] to waste time
[42:02] we did not come here just to see faces
[42:04] we've never seen before that is not the
[42:07] purpose we came here for lives to be
[42:10] changed
[42:11] and you can leave this camp with a
[42:12] testimony i've been changed i've been
[42:15] renewed i've been restored
[42:19] then you can be a testimony to somebody
[42:21] else walking with their head hanging
[42:22] down you gotta lift your head up look at
[42:25] it kind of have your head down it's time
[42:27] to lift it up
[42:30] because god is the one brought to you
[42:31] here's the one keeping
[42:33] but you'll always fall when you try to
[42:35] keep yourself
[42:37] it's not my power not by might it's by
[42:39] god's spirit
[42:40] he's the one that keeps us
[42:45] they said i said
[42:47] verse 24
[42:49] he got a whole different attitude
[42:51] he said thou shalt count his thou shall
[42:53] guide me
[42:55] with thy counsel
[42:57] and afterwards received me the glory
[42:59] otherwise you're going to guide me with
[43:00] your accounts and then i'm going to be
[43:01] raptured up out of here
[43:03] he's giving god praise now not the world
[43:07] amen
[43:11] verse 25
[43:12] who have i
[43:14] in heaven but thee
[43:16] there is none upon earth that i desire
[43:19] to be
[43:21] besides thee
[43:24] my flesh
[43:25] and my heart fellas man this man just
[43:28] being honest
[43:30] she sounds like this be superman oh i'm
[43:31] strong
[43:32] i'm good
[43:34] i got it
[43:37] he being
[43:38] honest just being honest see even as
[43:41] preachers
[43:42] we can appear like superman
[43:45] but we got things we have to deal with
[43:46] too
[43:50] people sometimes you might just give a
[43:52] testimony of things you go through and
[43:53] you know people do some time
[43:57] you
[43:58] you're a preacher though what that got
[44:00] to do with it
[44:04] what's that got to do with it you think
[44:06] preachers are immune to problems and
[44:08] trials no we just know how to hide them
[44:10] better
[44:14] and we do it for your sake
[44:17] because you see us defeated you're gonna
[44:19] be like
[44:20] whoa whoa
[44:23] huh
[44:24] but god got leaders today he got true
[44:27] ministry today that will stand anything
[44:30] that the devil wants to bring
[44:32] even though we had to have some battles
[44:34] we'll still stand and you can too
[44:40] my flesh
[44:41] and my heart faileth
[44:43] because god is the strength of my heart
[44:46] and my portion forever
[44:49] for low they that are far from thee
[44:51] shall perish that has destroyed all of
[44:54] them that go whoring from thee he said
[44:57] but it is good for me to draw near to
[45:00] god i have put my trust in the lord god
[45:03] that i may declare
[45:05] all his
[45:06] works
[45:09] he is restored
[45:13] same asap same frame same body but
[45:16] different thoughts
[45:17] restore it back to those original
[45:19] thoughts
[45:21] brother did you get that video for me
[45:26] i want to show you something
[45:28] some of you
[45:29] some of you i've never seen it don't
[45:30] matter but you probably don't i preached
[45:32] something about this years ago
[45:35] but i want to show you something my
[45:36] interest is this
[45:39] paul said we should not be ignorant
[45:41] of certain devices
[45:44] you got to understand
[45:47] and be able to discern
[45:48] how the devil works because you know
[45:50] that comes to maturity according to the
[45:52] book of hebrews when we can be able to
[45:54] discern good and evil
[45:56] because we're living in a generation
[45:58] they call
[45:59] good evil and they call evil good this
[46:02] is the generation we're living in it's
[46:03] all twisted up
[46:05] but i want to show you something
[46:07] to those that are struggling you know i
[46:10] can see
[46:11] there's some strong young people here
[46:13] you can just sense it
[46:15] then you can see some that are hurting
[46:17] going through something
[46:19] but i still get excited because the ones
[46:21] you that are strong and you know where
[46:23] you're standing you're here to help
[46:26] because you can identify with yourself
[46:28] in the younger more than we can i'm 55
[46:31] now
[46:32] and some things i can't relate to
[46:35] i'm just being honest
[46:37] i'm gonna give y'all a secret but
[46:39] i'll just go ahead and tell you i don't
[46:40] do it now but you know
[46:43] i was thinking one day i said man i'm
[46:44] getting old
[46:46] i said i can't relate to some of these
[46:48] things these young people do
[46:50] what's going on here
[46:51] if i tell you what i did
[46:53] i got on facebook
[46:59] and you know what i did
[47:00] i read y'all conversations you give
[47:03] reading conversations so whoa
[47:06] this is how they think
[47:08] and then when i go to preach a youth
[47:10] message
[47:11] i'm actually taking their notes
[47:14] of what they think and preaching to them
[47:16] and they think it's discernment no i
[47:18] studied your notes
[47:23] you're told on yourself
[47:30] praise the lord
[47:33] you always tell on yourself
[47:35] you know brother branham said
[47:37] if i go into a man's room
[47:40] or his office i just need to see what he
[47:42] painted on his wall but whatever
[47:44] pictures on his wall
[47:46] tells about him
[47:48] so when you post something on facebook
[47:49] that's a
[47:51] you telling me about you
[47:56] you can't hide it you just tell on
[47:57] yourself
[47:58] oh come on
[48:07] where'd that come from
[48:10] i'ma tell you where it come from it
[48:11] comes from games
[48:14] it comes from thugs
[48:16] now you want to be a message thug
[48:21] that's nonsense man you're trying to
[48:23] identify yourself what the world is what
[48:24] you're doing
[48:26] hello
[48:28] and it's cool no it's not
[48:31] the devil just creeping up so easy till
[48:33] you get so used to those types of things
[48:34] until it becomes normal to you
[48:36] and say ain't nothing wrong with that
[48:38] you tell on yourself
[48:44] man some of these signs they do with
[48:46] their hand
[48:47] i get crimps trying to do that stuff
[48:51] so the way they do it he lets you know
[48:52] it's an anointing
[48:54] to make their body disfigure and they
[48:55] hand disfigure that's a spirit
[48:59] but it's cool
[49:00] and then you know of course
[49:04] being in the message when you try to
[49:05] identify the world life that's you
[49:09] oh yeah you cuz they can spot you
[49:12] you're gonna try to act cool
[49:15] yo what's up they're like
[49:18] he can't even do it right
[49:20] cause you try to live in two worlds
[49:21] there
[49:22] they laughing at you but if you keep
[49:24] standing there you'll adapt to it
[49:27] it'll become normal to you
[49:32] this message
[49:33] this word is so powerful
[49:37] even if you just come into church
[49:40] it might not be boring again but keep
[49:42] coming to church
[49:43] it still puts an anointing on you that
[49:46] people can identify
[49:51] soccer right
[49:54] oh especially the most slick boys
[49:57] sometimes your sister you think you're
[49:58] all strong and powerful but he can still
[50:01] see that little innocence is on you hmm
[50:04] and then if you ain't careful you'll
[50:06] break
[50:08] because they study you girls study bars
[50:11] too
[50:13] there's nothing right but it don't got
[50:14] so bad now we got the slickers in the
[50:16] message
[50:19] trying to manipulate girl's mind
[50:21] then you got girls in the message
[50:22] turning them into a white boy's mind
[50:24] it goes both ways when it shouldn't be
[50:27] neither
[50:29] it shouldn't be neither
[50:31] you ought to want to serve the lord
[50:32] there's nothing wrong wanting to get
[50:34] married
[50:35] nothing wrong with it but it's how
[50:37] people do it brings the problems
[50:41] i've been in this message 30 years
[50:45] but jason i know you've probably been
[50:46] longer than me
[50:48] but you i would have never
[50:50] never thought i would hear the words of
[50:52] young people being divorced
[50:55] in this message
[50:58] when i start hearing them like what they
[51:01] say this just lasted six months what
[51:03] doesn't last three months
[51:04] what's going on
[51:06] and sometimes there's a minister you
[51:08] actually said did i preach hard enough
[51:09] lord did i pray that i do all i can you
[51:11] don't want to blame yourself
[51:14] what happened
[51:15] but what's happening
[51:17] people ain't getting a new birth
[51:23] when you were born again
[51:25] you're going to make sure you married
[51:26] somebody that's born again
[51:29] and you say brother brother they're
[51:30] going to make sure we will have no
[51:32] problems oh yeah you're going to still
[51:33] have problems but you got something
[51:35] inside of you to help you with them
[51:36] problems
[51:38] are you with me
[51:41] i'm gonna
[51:43] just go ahead and show that brother if
[51:44] you got it up there
[51:46] oh
[51:47] you already got it
[51:49] you did that jeremy
[51:52] you the man
[51:53] [Music]
[51:56] i want y'all
[51:58] [Music]
[52:14] [Music]
[52:16] oh
[52:20] [Applause]
[52:23] [Music]
[52:29] how many y'all know what that is
[52:33] it's called implosion
[52:36] that's what it's called
[52:42] there's actually only 10 companies
[52:45] they say in the world can do that
[52:50] because it's a it's a it's a craft
[52:53] that's been passed and the companies
[52:55] that do it
[52:57] it comes from generational families
[53:01] that started doing it so they passed it
[53:03] from generation to generation to
[53:05] generation
[53:06] only 10.
[53:08] but they don't call them
[53:10] construction crews
[53:13] they call them destruction crews
[53:18] this is something
[53:19] that is a very unique art
[53:22] i actually seen pictures
[53:24] where they can bring a building down and
[53:26] got building just right beside it
[53:28] and it never bothered the building
[53:30] beside it the only thing bothering the
[53:31] other building beside is the dust that
[53:33] it creates
[53:35] that's how good and precise they are
[53:39] now one thing about this i just wanted
[53:41] to put this and bring it in with asap
[53:45] that building
[53:46] once they start the implosion
[53:49] pushing the detonator
[53:52] it's not even a minute
[53:54] that building comes down
[53:57] now it might took
[53:59] 20 years to build it
[54:02] but just a minute
[54:04] to bring it down
[54:08] are you with me but here is what they do
[54:12] i read some of their notes i'm just
[54:13] going by memory cause they've been years
[54:15] since i i just thought about this on the
[54:17] way to church actually like brother can
[54:18] you put a picture up there
[54:20] what they do
[54:22] they would get a uh when they want the
[54:24] building to be destroyed they would get
[54:26] they would go to the courthouse
[54:28] and get the the original architectural
[54:31] papers
[54:32] of the building they want to look at the
[54:34] blueprints
[54:36] they want to see the strong points they
[54:38] want to see how it structure that's what
[54:40] they they study it
[54:42] so what they're studying
[54:45] they want to see what all of the main
[54:46] points are that holds the building up
[54:50] see
[54:51] the brain the building down they just
[54:52] need the main points
[54:55] they don't need to put explosives into
[54:56] every part of the building they just
[54:58] need to put it in main points so as they
[55:01] study
[55:02] then they go on the site
[55:03] they look around start drilling holes
[55:06] putting dynamite in different places
[55:07] different place it takes them a little
[55:09] while to get them all there but they're
[55:10] just loading all of the dynamites
[55:13] i'm here to tell you
[55:15] satan is the same way
[55:19] he studies you
[55:22] and what he does
[55:24] he studies where your strengths are
[55:27] where your strong points are
[55:29] them the ones he want to blow up in your
[55:31] life to bring you down see the thing
[55:33] about an implosion
[55:34] is different from explosion
[55:37] explosion things go out
[55:40] but implosion it goes in other words it
[55:43] brings its own self down by its own
[55:45] weight and its own
[55:46] gravity but it needs something to start
[55:49] it
[55:50] right cause you say amen
[55:52] so in this right you notice when he
[55:55] played the video you heard a lot of
[55:56] noise
[55:58] you just heard boom boom boom boom boom
[56:00] but the building wasn't going down as
[56:02] yet
[56:03] what was happening all the explosions
[56:06] was going off breaking the building down
[56:08] then all of a sudden it just comes
[56:10] down
[56:13] satan is the same
[56:15] way
[56:18] are you with me
[56:21] he studies you
[56:24] some people
[56:26] are built up
[56:28] just on emotions
[56:31] they're just emotional people
[56:33] and the devil knows that
[56:36] so what he'll start doing putting places
[56:38] in your life that stir your emotions it
[56:40] stirs your emotions up to get you to a
[56:42] place to get so bad till you get
[56:44] depressed
[56:46] you know when you get depressed you
[56:48] don't go up
[56:50] you go down
[56:52] because it's depression it's all over
[56:54] just pushing you down but the devil
[56:56] found places in your life to be able to
[56:58] do that
[57:01] are you with me
[57:04] i've seen people sit in church
[57:08] myself as a pastor
[57:11] and begin to see
[57:12] the devil putting explosives in their
[57:14] lives
[57:17] you see when somebody implodes in the
[57:19] church even amongst you young people
[57:23] when you see somebody fall remember the
[57:26] building is the one that fall but when
[57:28] the dust spreads it affects those that
[57:30] are around it
[57:34] you hear a lot of negative things about
[57:36] the message
[57:37] this one don't fail listen to this this
[57:40] that's the devil just want to put in the
[57:42] bombs even in your life
[57:44] trying to get you to fall the only thing
[57:46] you just got to push away
[57:48] are you with me
[57:49] but gravity
[57:52] if you get to a place you feel so
[57:54] condemned
[57:55] and the devil want to keep you in that
[57:57] con condemnation thought what actually
[58:00] you're going to start doing nobody got
[58:02] to push you down
[58:03] you will bring yourself down with all of
[58:06] that grief you're now imploding
[58:11] now you're walking around like a zombie
[58:13] smile sometimes but you know what's
[58:15] inside you're dying
[58:18] are you with me
[58:20] you see what was happening in the asaph
[58:22] life by him looking at all the things of
[58:24] the world the devil just planted
[58:26] explosives there planting explosives
[58:28] there that's all the thing the devil was
[58:29] doing but i'm so thankful
[58:32] with these implosions once they got
[58:34] everything set it's a pride for that
[58:38] company to see that building come down
[58:40] they just stand far off
[58:42] you ready guys
[58:45] you ready yeah then they push the
[58:47] detonator kick
[58:51] yeah yeah and then the building just
[58:53] come down
[58:55] that's pride
[58:57] see that satan's pride
[58:59] when he can see a building
[59:01] come
[59:02] down
[59:04] are you with me he just loves it i got
[59:06] another one i got another one i got
[59:08] another one
[59:10] but i happened to run across a video
[59:13] where they did an implosion
[59:16] and the building didn't come all the way
[59:17] down
[59:19] the company was tore up it was like
[59:23] big old building just lopsided
[59:27] wow
[59:28] wow it didn't come down
[59:31] and when i thought about that
[59:32] i said praise god
[59:35] praise god
[59:37] my mind went to sampson
[59:43] you see when samson started doing wrong
[59:47] he already had bombs inside of him
[59:48] before he got to delaware
[59:52] delilah was just a detonator
[59:56] he was already loaded
[59:59] time at the time doing wrong doing wrong
[1:00:01] doing wrong they were just playing it
[1:00:02] there playing it there planet that
[1:00:04] planet there then when it got to delilah
[1:00:09] but what they didn't realize
[1:00:12] she the detonator was pushed
[1:00:15] but the building didn't go all the way
[1:00:17] down
[1:00:23] amen
[1:00:26] oh we got samson now
[1:00:29] we got him
[1:00:31] but they didn't realize as he was
[1:00:33] walking around grinding
[1:00:36] talking to the lord
[1:00:38] while he talking to god
[1:00:40] repenting god was putting bombs in
[1:00:43] simpson
[1:00:46] now anybody didn't know what was coming
[1:00:48] you see god had to put samson eyes out
[1:00:51] so he can see
[1:00:55] all right
[1:00:56] see this is how god works jesus said
[1:00:59] whatever going to offend
[1:01:01] that going to stop you going into the
[1:01:02] kingdom of heaven he's going to cut it
[1:01:04] off
[1:01:05] if your hand offends cut it off foot cut
[1:01:08] it off he don't literally mean you want
[1:01:09] you to cut it off what he's saying
[1:01:11] whatever's going to get in the way cut
[1:01:13] it off
[1:01:15] see sampson eyes was in the way
[1:01:18] he had a lust problem
[1:01:21] it's hard for a man to lust when he
[1:01:22] blind
[1:01:24] god said these eyes is getting this man
[1:01:25] this brother in trouble let me let them
[1:01:27] put them eyes out of them so i can let
[1:01:29] him really see
[1:01:30] when samson's eye were taken out
[1:01:33] now he can see
[1:01:36] praise the lord that's why god stopped
[1:01:38] thing cut things off in your life cause
[1:01:40] he wants you to see not to hurt you but
[1:01:43] he wants you to see that this girl you
[1:01:45] think is for you is not for you
[1:01:48] this boy you think is your friend is not
[1:01:49] your friend he wants you to see
[1:01:53] huh
[1:01:54] and all of a sudden sampson repenting
[1:01:57] and repenting they didn't realize those
[1:01:59] locks
[1:02:00] was growing back
[1:02:03] they didn't realize it and he said just
[1:02:06] once more lord
[1:02:08] and then all of a sudden he had to be
[1:02:10] led by a child but what they didn't
[1:02:12] realize he was loaded
[1:02:14] yeah samson were packed with nuclear
[1:02:16] weapons
[1:02:18] of the holy ghost get ready to do
[1:02:20] something to the enemy as he was walking
[1:02:22] down down the philistine making smart
[1:02:24] laughing god had that detonator doing
[1:02:26] this like this keep on walking son
[1:02:29] keep on moving son
[1:02:31] now you're in the right spot
[1:02:33] and then god said push
[1:02:35] food

[1:02:39] amen let him load you with the holy
[1:02:41] ghost you'll go back take back what the

[1:03:06] you have been loaded with the word to do
[1:03:08] what the no good ain't how to fight the
[1:03:10] devil that's what you mean to quit with
[1:03:13] through these sermons

[1:03:27] time no more

[1:03:31] but i got to do like jeremiah root out
[1:03:34] pluck up
[1:03:36] tear down but at the end plant and build
[1:03:40] that's why we had to rebuke sometimes to
[1:03:42] push them demons back from you friends
[1:03:45] it's not to condemn you
[1:03:48] oh lord my time is up god bless you

[1:04:21] somebody say praise the lord
[1:04:24] my goodness thank you brother burly for
[1:04:25] that
[1:04:26] don't you just love the word of god
[1:04:29] did you watch how god just turned that
[1:04:30] right back around here brother john
[1:04:32] preached on
[1:04:33] restoration last night brother burley
[1:04:36] preaching on
[1:04:38] asaph restored and got right there to
[1:04:41] the end with samson what was god doing
[1:04:43] god was taking a son who had fallen
[1:04:46] so low but it doesn't matter how far you
[1:04:48] go or how low that you fall
[1:04:51] god can always bring you back
[1:04:54] amen give god another handclap of praise
[1:05:07] hallelujah
[1:05:12] amen you know whether john was preaching
[1:05:14] last night i thought of it again today
[1:05:16] as i heard brother burley
[1:05:19] and brother john showed that picture of
[1:05:21] the
[1:05:22] the building that was being restored
[1:05:25] and showing the different images of the
[1:05:27] before and after
[1:05:28] and i thought it was so profound
[1:05:31] when brother john started showing those
[1:05:33] images because it shows that restoration
[1:05:36] as he said is a process
[1:05:38] and you know oftentimes that process in
[1:05:40] your life can be discouraging
[1:05:43] you know my mind goes when uh
[1:05:46] god took his people out of babylon and
[1:05:48] through ezra and nehemiah they started
[1:05:50] rebuilding the walls you know before
[1:05:52] jerusalem when they came back
[1:05:54] from babylon
[1:05:56] jerusalem was
[1:05:58] everything about what was
[1:06:01] because everything that they could see
[1:06:02] visually everything that they looked at
[1:06:06] all they seen was walls that were torn
[1:06:08] down
[1:06:09] destruction and ruin
[1:06:12] and you know sometimes in your life when
[1:06:14] and i'm just speaking specifically here
[1:06:17] because this is just how the lord dealt
[1:06:19] with me hearing brother burley even this
[1:06:21] morning
[1:06:22] you know sometimes ruined trying to
[1:06:24] rebuild something or trying to get back
[1:06:27] you know can be discouraging when you
[1:06:28] look around and all you see is the
[1:06:30] problems you get to camp and there's
[1:06:33] excitement and you've got your brothers
[1:06:36] and sisters and you're you're on fire
[1:06:37] but then you go face
[1:06:39] monday morning as brother john said
[1:06:41] we're preaching to you not for a
[1:06:42] momentary experience but where the
[1:06:46] ministry you heard this morning was to
[1:06:48] so that you have something to fight the
[1:06:50] devil with on monday when you go home
[1:06:54] you go home and it's not camping it's
[1:06:56] not excitement and it's not that you
[1:06:58] don't have that licks of fire and that
[1:07:01] faith that you feel in the atmosphere
[1:07:03] when the words being preached and all
[1:07:05] you see is all what what isn't and
[1:07:07] what's out of place and what's ruined in
[1:07:09] your life and you want to get back but
[1:07:12] you got to know how you know what you
[1:07:13] know what the children of israel had to
[1:07:15] do they couldn't become overwhelmed by
[1:07:18] what they seen they just had to pick up
[1:07:21] a tool
[1:07:22] and one brick at a time
[1:07:26] one step at a time and so you today i
[1:07:30] want you to look at your life and say
[1:07:31] lord i may not be what i need to be but
[1:07:34] i'm gonna pick up my hammer i'm gonna
[1:07:36] pick up my tool i'm gonna pick up my axe
[1:07:38] and one brick at a time lord i'm gonna
[1:07:40] take a step of faith
[1:07:43] until i'm standing like you had in your
[1:07:45] mind before the foundation of the world
