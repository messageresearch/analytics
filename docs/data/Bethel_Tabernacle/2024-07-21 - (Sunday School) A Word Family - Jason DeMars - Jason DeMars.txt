morning everyone God bless you let's stand go ahead and bring the PowerPoint up brother Mark we're going to start a new topic for Sunday school now so let's pray Heavenly Father we just want to commit this time to you Lord we pray that you would be glorified and magnified that you'd help me to step out of the way and that your anointed would come Lord and take your word and break it down to the people's hearts Lord and may the spirit of Revelation be activated in their hearts and in my heart as well Lord we Commit This Time To You For Your Glory we ask in Jesus name amen 1 Corinthians 117 for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated brother brandham says that mothers are the backbone of the family and that is the truth amen we can see as in type that the reason this world hasn't been gone into full chaos under the wrath of God is that the bride is still here the scripture says he that lth will let until he be taken out of way of the way and then the man of sin will be revealed the son of predition who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worship so he sits in the temple of God receiving worship so the the Antichrist will come only when the bride is taken out of the way so the bride there is then the backbone as brother brandham spoke about building a home we turning a corner where these different things that he speaks about the bride the bride being a type of the of the home in that sense so then what are fathers if mothers are the backbone what are fathers well fathers are to reflect Christ in the home and in the family so then fathers must be the foundation right the scripture says that no other Foundation can be laid than what is laid which is Jesus Christ and so of course it says we're built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets but what's the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ and so that's the foundation of the family that's what the home is built upon that's that's what the children who live in the home are built upon that's what they stand on top of so whatever whatever level the whatever layer that the husband lays whatever level of walk that he has that's the foundation that his family is going to walk upon that's the foundation that his home is going to be built upon so in a family then sons are to be in the family under preparation to be that Foundation under preparation the the vision isn't let's have fun let's get an education those things might go along with it but the the vision that fathers should be placing with their sons is you're going to be the foundation of a new home you're going to be a patriarch you're a patriarch in training that's your purpose that's what God has for you that's what God is doing for you so you need to find your life mission and that's what fathers should be preparing their sons to find is to find their life mission and we know specifically uh in general what a man's life mission is but secondarily as we all have a different calling within that General Mission and that General uh command to all believers so then daughters in the home should be under preparation to be a field right they should be in preparation to be mothers to be nurturers to be life multipliers remember brother brandham says the life comes from the father so the father plants the life but the mother grows the life and transforms it in multiplied for format right so on when we're looking at the hour that we're living in under the seventh seal it under the uttering of the seven Thunders that's to reveal all the mysteries of the word and it's to bring the restoration of the word in the hearts of the Believers so in that restoration it brings a Oneness between Christ and his bride so that those in the bride actually become a reflection of the vision and mind that Christ has she becomes the manifested glory of Christ our families need to be a reflection of that as well it's not good enough to just say that it's out in the world but it should be reflected within our families as we read woman is the glory of the man and the man is the glory of God so man then if we look at glory when you see Glory you should see of the manifestation of who that person is Right glory hearkens to manifestation we call it the shikina glory anytime we say the glory of God it's God manifesting himself in who he is so that he can be expressed and made visible and so when we say the man is the glory of God we're saying he's a reflection of the the the vision and the mind of God so then we translate that down the woman is the glory of the man so then the woman actually has to enter into the vision the mind the mission of the man so that he then be she then becomes an expression and a manifestation of the man the woman is the glory of the man the man is the glory of God it's the it's glory flowing down together they make the full image and likeness of God but it must flow down through that Vision we as the bride take the mind of Christ Christ doesn't take the mind of the Bride Christ doesn't follow his bride around waiting for her to give him a vision and an understanding of what to do no he himself has the understanding he himself has the vision and goes forward and walks in the vision and our wives need to take forth the mind the purpose the vision of their husband and become a reflection of that now what if what if the husband has no vision has no Mission well of course you you've you've exploded the whole thing to start with and the woman is going to make up her own vision and she's going to begin to resent the man for a lacking a vision and a mission right so the Bible says without a without the vision the people perish we understand that's speaking of the prophetic Ministry but even even taking it further we can understand that there should be a purpose there should be a reason there should be a function we have to get rid of our own vision and get God's vision and when we have God's vision for ourselves as men we can go forward in that Vision then your wife can respect you see a man's vision and Mission can't be his wife if if your whole vision of life and mission is life I'm going to find a wife I'm going to find a wife you're actually you're ending up in idolatry because the mission can't be the wife because then you're leading your wife into that vision and she's now making it all about herself now you've led her into idolatry this is uh the Magical World of Disney and Hollywood that makes the vision all about finding the girl well God God gave adam let's look to the beginning when God created Adam created Adam first what was the vision that he he gave adam a pre-existing Vision what was it take dominion and multiply well he doesn't have a problem taking dominion and subduing the Earth but he can't multiply by himself so what did God do he said this isn't good that man's alone I'll make him a help meat it speaks of both being the same and opposite at the at the same time she's the same but different why is she different she is to be the reflection she is to be able to help the man complete the vision and the mission that God has set forth for him now she now the man can really complete it because he has his helper right and so when he plants the life in his helper that's how multiplication can take place so a man can't multiply right a woman she's able to multiply with her husband a man can subdue a woman has a struggle to take dominion and subdue because she's the weaker vessel so now the man together with the woman they can complete the mission together the mission isn't each other the mission is to manifest God and to spread his Rule and dominion over the Earth First in the family and then beyond all right let me go back to my PowerPoint brother brandham speaking indoors indoors some time ago I read a story of the days of our Noble one of the greatest presidents I think the N Nation ever has had was Lincoln not because he come from Kentucky but because he was a great man he was deprived of an education but yet with something in his heart some purpose I like a man of vision I like people that got that's got something they're fighting for just not just lay around well whatever what comes along will be all right oh be up and at it and Lincoln never let his education stand in the way he had something to do I think every Christian ought to be that way find your purpose and go do it every member of this chapter just not well we have a bre breakfast once a month that isn't it or once every Saturday have a purpose in life something you're going to do God has placed you here do something about it every member of every Church there's a Revival in town the Revival is there for a purpose let's get something out of it let's do something about it when I he hear of a church this is from as as the eagle stirs or Nest when I hear of a church that hasn't got any ambition to grow there's something wrong with that church the Church of the Living God has a high ambition and another thing the Church of the Living God is built high because it's got high high anticipations and expectations say well we belong to the church Our Father served this church years ago that might be fine but the Church of the Living God can't sit still its Ambitions is to go higher and farther we see the blind healed today we're watching tomorrow for the dead to be raised we when we see nature obey his voice we're looking for the coming of Christ its Ambitions is high it's anticipations is high its expectations is high it's built high it's set up as a memorial the Christian at his work is set on a hill his Ambitions is high to win his boss or somebody else to Christ that's right his expectations is high somewhere that God will give him a chance to speak to somebody amen one more from a prisoner but before I say about Moses I'd like to make that statement that God always has to take any man that will serve him truly to be his prisoner a man has to surrender every ambition he's got everything that he is everything his life soul body will Ambitions and everything else and become a complete a prison to Christ who is the word to serve God Amen so our Ambitions have to be set High because God sets them high and he's called us to high Ambitions but it's not our own Vision it's not our own ambition it's entering into the vision ambition purpose mission that God has for us as individuals right back to the point I was making before so Adam came with a pre-existing mission unfortunately many of us we come and we're like I just want to get married I want a wife right good that's a good thing and then we figure then we we stumble along and then we have kids and we go I better figure this thing out what's my what's my mission what's my vision and frankly many men never figure it out and they're just carried along their wife carries them they like each other kind of and then they resent each other because the man's just flying foundering have have your vision and walk forward in that Vision if God hasn't shown you yet walk forward in what you're doing now and wait on him and he will show you he promised if you asked he would show you right so you come with the vision and a you know you you hear the you hear the perversion that women like a bad boy nice guys you know women don't like nice guys nice guys are simply begging them for a woman they're begging for a woman and she looks at and that and says what a that guy's weak guy don't have a vision he's not a manly man and the and the the bad boy he knows what he's doing he knows what he wants to do woman comes and he says I'm going to keep going on this Direction that's a perversion you see that women will do that because they want a man with a A Vision with a mission that he's already walking in but they they the real godly woman will see that and see the ungodly man she won't want that she'll want a Christian man with a real Vision to walk in see not not just saying oh I just you know I just want to I just want to find a wife that's all I want that's all I care about I just want to please my wife and everything okay you please God in everything you follow him and then God will set those things in order in the family because God tells you to love your wife even as Christ loved the church but when you put that first and you put that to a place of idolatry that's not the right Vision that's not the mission that Adam was given Adam wasn't given the mission to find a wife God found a wife for him right and and and Eve it's not your mission to go find a husband God will lead you to a husband God will open the door you let him direct you you let him guide you because you want his way and his purpose not your own purpose not your own mind not just because of he's cute or what whatever it is or because she's cute we were talking about we're living in a different we're living in the age that the seventh seal has been broken to us we're not living in denominational ages we're not living in baby ages we're to take the word and be mature in the word we're we're to be men and women of vision understanding what our purpose and what our place is in a word family all right now let's look at some statistics importance of a father fatherless homes produce in America 63% % of Youth suicides 71% of high school dropouts 90% of all homeless and runaway youth 85% of all children who show behavior disorders 71% of all pregnant teenagers recently uh a little meme was going around and they were asking uh homosexuals no homosexual has all five of these and they start good at math and they're like oh yeah I'm good at math a good relationship with their father and they went through hundreds of them none of them had good relationships with their father that's that's what that's what these people felt importance of a father that's involved continuing in the Faith of Our Fathers 90% of children remain faithful when their fathers truly walk with God regardless of mother and when it's just mother Walking with God less than 50% of children remain faithful to what they've been taught so we see that the father leading the family is the critical Foundation as I said as I said at the beginning the father leading the fa family consistently in the word with a vision of the mission that God has called him to do that is the place that your children will walk upon and again statistics are statistics nothing is a guarantee but we know when a father is involved when a father is connected when a father is leading his home the likelihood of children Walking with God is going to be very high amen very high very little chance of them walking away but without a vision with a husband that's not involved not connected not walking with God not leading his family in the word it's less than a 50% chance all right first Timothy 58 but if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own house he has denied the faith and is worse than an Infidel it's interesting that the Apostle Paul would speak so rashly about this he he he he speaks in other places about women being in their place and if they're not in their place it's uh like saying that the word of God is being blasphemed amongst the people but here when he says a father that wouldn't provide for his own uh household as literally his life has denied the faith what his life is expressing is literally a denial of the word you it's just as I mean denying the faith that's when people would come for persecution they'd stand before Caesar worship the idol so to not providing for your own household is like offering incense to the emperor think about that so this is a critical thing in the Christian Life For Men is providing for their household and I'll say it's not just a financial thing providing for the home it's it's providing what God has has ordained and purposed for the family am it's providing spiritually it's providing financially it's providing emotionally physically etc etc to be that protector to be that Guardian to be that Keeper of the home and the family and to Sher that duty to run away from that Duty Paul says you're worse than an unbeliever you're an apostate wow how critical is that I don't know how to overemphasize this point I think it's key and critical for men to understand this it's not just about a job it's far beyond that a job is a job and providing for a family is the start it's just the start of it 1 Corinthians 1613 watch ye Stand Fast in the faith quit you like man be strong amen the word quit you like men is andrii it means to render Brave or manly to show or behave oneself like a man one of the key attributes of Manliness Godly a Godly Man is bravery he's not a he's not a wimp he's Brave he's ready to take the stand he's ready to take the punches he's ready to take the heat for his family he's not watching and cowering andh I don't I don't know what's going to happen uh behind the skirts of his wife but he's standing there taking the blows from the devil and from hell and from the enemy on the outside and he has to be strong strength is critical in manliness that is a very expression of what God created us to be is to be strong both spiritually and physically the the man is not to be the weaker vessel the man is the stronger vessel right the scripture declares that the woman is the weaker vessel I think that's one of the most obvious things that anyone that has eyes to see can acknowledge even though our society today would say men and women are exactly the same they're not and when women take the place of men in society it becomes a great danger for everyone amen it's it's totally wrong and I'm not going to comment about politics right now even though my brain is trying to force me to but that's the truth a woman in the pulpit she's not designed for that she's not designed to take the blows and the Bible says a woman is more easily deceived than a man so she's not designed for that but man is designed for that ma man isn't designed to multiply right he he can't do it on his own he has to have a helper to do that that's what his wife is for a man is not designed to be the nurturer of a home and of a family though the the the the wife a woman is designed to nurture and to help unify a family a man is designed to subdue to be strong to quit you like men be brave Joshua was told to be strong and courageous well in in our day and age we just put that off that's just spiritually strong well they flow into each other the guy was about to go fight a war I think he was talking about spiritual and physical strength strength take the strength that you have and give it to God and let him use it in First Corinthians 6 just refer to it 9- 11 Paul gives a list of things that will deny you entry to the kingdom of God and one of those lists of items is being effeminate men that are effeminate God hates it it's confusion it's even connected to what we've refer to for how you dress Deuteronomy 22:5 it's an Abomination to God for a man to dress like a woman and a woman to dress like a man how much more is it an Abomination for a man to act like a woman to act female to be sissified God hates it and he says unless you act unless you act like a man you're a provider you take responsibility men are designed to take responsibility for others and you'll never be happy and you'll never find meaning until you take responsibility for others God wants you taking responsibility for your wife for your sons for your daughters not to P you don't pass it off on the pastor you don't pass it off on the church you don't pass it off on the youth group you dad must lead and teach your family because because when you get old and you never took time to teach your family and to bring them the word and to show them what the message is and they walk away from all of it you can't blame your pastor your pastor is not going to eat the fruits of that your youth minister is not going to eat the fruits of that you are when you have grandkids and children scattered to the Four Winds of evil because you refuse to lead your home amen you refuse to teach them you refuse to take control you know it's I don't know how I want to close this out I I don't want to be lambasting you as as I close it out but let's put it this way Brothers we we have to realize that we have choices and decisions to make for our children you can't say well I don't know they're just they're they're just on social media too much well take their phone away take authority don't be a do what has to be done to save your family you are to be a redeemer you are to be a redeemer of your family take the authority that you have okay as they get older the things change and by the time they're 18 they should know how to take responsibility for themselves because you've shown them all through the years am and they're gradually getting more reliable and more spiritual ual responsibility but I'll remind you sorry Gideon that it your brain is not fully formed until you're 25 so your decision making is poor up until 25 so if you're not 25 yet probably should get some help from your father in your decision making first your heavenly father and then your Earthly father not just you Gideon it's all it's every one of us it was me when I was a dumb 24 year old and I can say see with perspective and I can say that that's the truth I was growing and learning that's why they uh insurance companies make your insurance go down when you turn 25 but the point is is we we can't just push the responsibility off or be so sissified that we don't take control and Leadership over our families and we can't leave the leadership to our wives because our your wife will resent you for not taking the leadership for not making the decisions she'll hate that so you think well I'm just empowering my wife oh you're a great feminist God bless you you're not empowering your wife you're ruining her you're hurting her you're damaging her you're ruining your own marriage because you refuse to be a man and a word family their head is is Christ first and then the man and secondarily is no no one else should insert themselves between this relationship between husband and wife the pastor is not the head of any wife in the church the husband is the head of the wife and when a when pastors we've stories are replete with it of nickan spirits and it always targets the women it controls the women and then the women control the men in the church and it's a perversion and it's wrong a healthy church is made up of Healthy Families a good pastor equips the husbands to lead their families a good Minister helps them be equipped to properly lead their homes and take headship over their families so that everything is order in order so a healthy church is made up of Healthy Families a pastor that inserts himself between these relationships the church becomes sick so sick homes produce sick churches because it's out of order many time sometimes the pastor think he's doing something right because the husband is a cissified man that will not lead his family so he thinks well I'll go help lead his family well you're doing wrong by that
