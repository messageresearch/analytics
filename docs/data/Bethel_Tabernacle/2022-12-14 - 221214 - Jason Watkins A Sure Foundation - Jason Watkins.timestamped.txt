[23:45] amen amen
[23:49] want to take a thought tonight called
[23:51] the sure Foundation I like a sewer
[23:54] Foundation I like a sure thing my I
[23:56] don't like to I never did like to gamble
[23:58] I gambled one time in my life and I sit
[24:01] down with some friends at a poker table
[24:03] I lost a dollar and 85 Cent I was so mad
[24:08] I was destroyed I mean that I I worked
[24:11] hard for that dollar in 85 percent that
[24:14] was back in the day and that was that
[24:16] was way more money than it is now but
[24:18] but uh that that broke me
[24:21] I said I will never gamble away my
[24:24] hard-earned money again that's the
[24:26] stupidest thing in the world
[24:27] praise the Lord
[24:29] but I like a sure thing amen praise the
[24:32] Lord how many know that the Lord is a
[24:34] sure thing
[24:35] my let's read
[24:38] in from verse one and let you be seated
[24:42] Romans 9 we're going to go 1 through 16.
[24:47] I say the truth in Christ I lie not my
[24:50] conscience also bearing me witness in
[24:53] the Holy Ghost
[24:54] that I have great heaviness and
[24:56] continual sorrow in my heart
[24:58] for I could wish that myself were
[25:01] accursed for Christ for my brethren my
[25:03] Kinsmen according to the flesh who are
[25:06] Israelites to whom pertaineth the
[25:09] adoption and the glory and the covenants
[25:11] and the giving of the law and the
[25:14] service of God and the promises
[25:16] whose are the fathers and of whom as
[25:19] concerning the flesh Christ came who is
[25:22] over all God blessed forever amen not as
[25:26] though the word of God hath taken none
[25:29] effect so it didn't matter that an
[25:33] entire nation
[25:35] turned him down
[25:37] think about you talking about a Titanic
[25:40] failure that you you get worried about
[25:42] your failures stopping God a whole
[25:44] nation failed
[25:46] a whole nation failed and that did not
[25:49] stop the promise of God it didn't even
[25:52] delay it
[25:54] the Holy Ghost still fell in the upper
[25:56] room
[25:57] amen
[25:58] all right watch
[26:02] not as though the word of God hath taken
[26:04] none effect for they are not all Israel
[26:07] which are Israel neither because they
[26:10] are the Seed of Abraham are they all
[26:12] children but here's the real mystery in
[26:16] Isaac shall I seed be called so Isaac
[26:19] was the Christ line the Christ's seed so
[26:24] this is going back to election it
[26:25] doesn't matter that they were had Jewish
[26:28] blood connecting them genetically to
[26:31] Abraham those were the men who called
[26:33] Jesus the devil
[26:36] and they were genetically connected to
[26:37] Abraham but they were not really Israel
[26:40] because Israel is a faith seed this is
[26:43] how you are sons of Abraham because
[26:46] you've now been enjoined back to Abraham
[26:48] through Christ amen watch just by your
[26:51] faith in him all right verse 8. that is
[26:55] they which are the children of the flesh
[26:57] these are not the children of God but
[27:00] the children of the promise are counted
[27:03] for the seed for This Is The Word of
[27:06] Promise at this time will I come and
[27:09] Sarah will have a son and not only this
[27:12] but when Rebecca also had conceived by
[27:15] one even by Our Father Isaac for the
[27:18] children being not yet born neither
[27:21] having done any good or evil that the
[27:24] purpose of God according to election
[27:26] might stand not of works but of him that
[27:29] calleth it was said unto her the Elder
[27:33] Shall Serve the younger now that that
[27:36] absolutely if you look at that naturally
[27:38] that God broke his own scripture
[27:41] because the the rights of the firstborn
[27:44] were were instilled in scripture and yet
[27:49] even when he when Jacob ends up Crossing
[27:53] his hands with the son of Joseph the
[27:55] sons of Joseph and you say how how could
[27:59] Esau have been the older the eldest but
[28:04] yet the blessing went to the younger
[28:06] that is contrary to God's word but not
[28:08] just stop and think for a minute
[28:10] if Jacob
[28:12] was in the mind of God before the
[28:15] foundation of the world and existed
[28:16] before Stardust and Esau didn't then who
[28:20] really was older
[28:23] amen who really was the eldest son all
[28:26] right so your Earthly condition is never
[28:28] going to affect your heavenly position
[28:32] oh I'm going to preach
[28:35] wow I told you I like a sure thing
[28:39] amen
[28:41] verse 11 for the children being not yet
[28:44] born here I'm reading it again neither
[28:46] having done any good or evil that the
[28:48] purpose of God according to election
[28:49] might stand not of works but of him that
[28:52] calleth it was said unto her the Elder
[28:54] Shall Serve the younger as it is written
[28:56] Jacob have I loved but he so have I
[28:59] hated
[29:00] amen let's let's bow our heads
[29:04] father we thank you for your word and
[29:06] the divine inspiration that we feel
[29:08] already now Lord I just commit myself
[29:11] into your hands for the delivery as I
[29:14] have done throughout this day Lord
[29:16] committing myself into your hands as
[29:18] I've studied it Lord and now it's up to
[29:21] you to be the preacher to make it
[29:22] effectual it'll have to be you so I
[29:25] completely now Just Surrender myself I
[29:28] put Faith In You Lord and I commit it to
[29:30] you in Jesus name amen God bless you
[29:33] friends you can be seated
[29:37] foreign
[29:52] amen
[29:57] so it's it's amazing how that God is
[30:00] going to pull all of this off and you
[30:03] find out that everything is designed
[30:07] around his purposes now this is a
[30:11] beautiful thing because in one sense you
[30:14] could look at this tonight and and and
[30:16] and I hope there's nobody in here
[30:19] tonight who would be on the outside
[30:21] looking in and saying well you know I'm
[30:23] not sure I'm a part of that promise you
[30:25] know what if I'm what if I'm like Esau
[30:27] then there's really going to be nothing
[30:29] I can do about it well you know when
[30:31] brother Branham when brother Branham
[30:33] goes to the Book of Revelation and you
[30:36] read in the Book of Revelation these
[30:38] very ominous Prophecies of of Mayhem and
[30:42] destruction and chaos and and I mean you
[30:46] know this this is global uh the
[30:48] tribulation the Bible says there's never
[30:51] been a day like it in all of history
[30:54] and there never will be another they
[30:57] like it thank God and so when we look at
[31:00] all of these masses of humanity that the
[31:03] Bible shows in Prophecy that are going
[31:07] to be destroyed you know first of all
[31:09] you have to remember that it's not that
[31:11] God doesn't give Every Man a legitimate
[31:13] chance to save himself God gives Every
[31:17] Man a legit chance it's not a facetious
[31:20] chance and even those who are outside of
[31:23] his elected family God is not a just God
[31:27] if he doesn't give every man at least an
[31:29] opportunity now God can predestinate by
[31:32] his foreknowledge because he knows who
[31:34] will and who won't but we realize that
[31:36] election goes even Beyond his
[31:38] foreknowledge it's just not a matter of
[31:41] him knowing that you won't disbelieve
[31:44] his word for your hour what he knows is
[31:46] really is that you can't
[31:51] you see when you understand election
[31:53] correctly you understand that you're
[31:56] actually a part of God that you're
[31:58] actually the same material that God's
[32:00] made of your life of his life word of
[32:03] his word amen and that is really the
[32:06] security that is the sure thing in God's
[32:10] elected family it's not even you know to
[32:12] the rest of the world they actually have
[32:15] to choose whether to save themselves
[32:17] actually you don't even make a choice
[32:20] you have to accept God's choice you have
[32:24] to be born again and God will will will
[32:27] follow you around and conk you on the
[32:30] head and and he'll trip you and and push
[32:34] you into Briars and push you into
[32:36] campfires and push you over a cliff if
[32:39] he has to but he will get you because
[32:41] you're his and he won't lose anything of
[32:44] himself
[32:46] you see but so you do have to accept it
[32:49] but God knows you will and you are
[32:52] elected with your names put on the
[32:53] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[32:54] foundation of the world Jesus said
[32:57] concerning that group
[32:59] you have not chosen me
[33:02] I have chosen you
[33:04] so this becomes a short thing and when
[33:06] brother Branham is going down in the
[33:08] book of in the in the Book of Revelation
[33:10] and he talks about you know the millions
[33:13] I mean the Book of Revelation makes it
[33:15] clear you've got you know we're north of
[33:17] seven and a half billion humans in the
[33:20] world and you've got a Bible prophecy
[33:22] showing us and teaching us very clearly
[33:25] that only a sliver of humanity will
[33:27] escape it
[33:29] so you got seven and a half more than
[33:32] seven and a half billion billion people
[33:35] and only a sliver of humanity are gonna
[33:39] Escape that because as I've said there's
[33:41] no way out but up
[33:43] and so we have been already called up
[33:47] into a higher opening of the word we've
[33:49] already been called up into a new and
[33:52] living day so I'm going to tell you
[33:54] something friends when that Rapture
[33:56] comes it's going to be a very short step
[33:58] for you you just believe that it's going
[34:00] to be a short step to the body change
[34:02] I'm gonna get up like I do every day as
[34:06] serving God you're going to get up every
[34:08] day like you do being a Christian and
[34:10] you're going to be thinking about
[34:11] thoughts that a Christian has and one
[34:14] and suddenly you're going to turn around
[34:15] brother random said you have a funny
[34:17] little feeling maybe like a little pain
[34:20] and that's the last pain you'll ever
[34:23] feel
[34:25] in your life
[34:28] you'll turn around and they'll stand
[34:30] those loved ones who've gone on ahead of
[34:32] you
[34:33] oh friends
[34:35] I'm pretty sure I won't need to use
[34:37] WhatsApp to let everybody know
[34:41] oh man I believe I can just shout into
[34:44] the atmospheres and hear all y'all
[34:46] shouting back yeah they're at our house
[34:48] too
[34:51] oh my what an hour but brother Branham
[34:54] comes back you know to realities of all
[34:56] of the billions that perish because they
[35:00] refused God's mercy God didn't force
[35:03] them to go there God never sent anybody
[35:04] to Hell who don't want to go there
[35:07] he doesn't he tries to keep everybody
[35:08] from going there hell wasn't even made
[35:10] for humans
[35:11] so he tries to heal brother and said if
[35:13] you go to hell you'll fight every step
[35:14] of the way he'll put every barricade he
[35:16] can God loves life
[35:18] his throne is established in Mercy he's
[35:20] not some troll under a bridge you're
[35:22] waiting to take revenge on all the
[35:24] people who rejected him he already died
[35:26] for people who rejected him
[35:28] people who murdered him he asked God to
[35:31] forgive them in their blindness
[35:33] so you're not going to impugn God as
[35:36] some evil monster but yet the reality is
[35:40] and it's heartbreaking to God and it's
[35:42] heartbreaking to us and brother Branham
[35:45] talks about the millions that'll die in
[35:47] an atomic Inferno and brother Branham it
[35:50] broke his heart his languages he said
[35:52] and he he includes all of us he said now
[35:54] that makes our heart bleed
[35:59] but the reality is if it went on another
[36:02] thousand years he says there wouldn't be
[36:04] one more name added to that book
[36:08] see and so you know you can you can open
[36:11] up a calendar I was showing somebody
[36:13] just the other day you can take a
[36:15] calendar and and you can you can click
[36:18] it open and when you're let me let me
[36:21] just do a quick demonstration show you
[36:22] the demonstration I was talking to
[36:23] somebody and I said okay so here here's
[36:26] a calendar with all of these dates and I
[36:29] mean here we go now I don't know where
[36:32] it is but there's a date in here that
[36:34] God has
[36:36] the Rapture is happening
[36:38] it's not a metaphor it's it's a date now
[36:42] I might have just skimmed over it not
[36:44] even knowing
[36:45] I might just go like that and the Lord
[36:46] would have went you just
[36:48] passed it
[36:50] I might be over here now you even when
[36:53] even when we're gone these dates are
[36:55] still going to be valid because the
[36:57] time's still going to carry right on and
[37:00] I mean I mean listen friends if you
[37:02] think about it for a second here here
[37:04] I'm already in 2024 and I can just keep
[37:07] going now I'm in 2025 and I can just
[37:09] keep going I'm in 2026 27 28 29. do you
[37:15] realize that that 2034 I mean think
[37:19] about it friends if if we if we today go
[37:24] in the Rapture at 2022 then
[37:28] 2034 you'll only be a couple hundred
[37:30] years past the millennium
[37:33] I mean I mean I I I'm sorry actually I'm
[37:36] thinking wrong I I we you have to go to
[37:39] all the way to 30 22.
[37:43] so I will be alive in the 24th century
[37:46] the 27th century the 28th and a half
[37:49] century time is still going to go on
[37:52] you're not going to die we which are
[37:55] alive and remain are going to be changed
[37:57] and caught up with the Lord and I will
[38:00] be alive on the earth in the year 27 15.
[38:07] yeah sure
[38:09] so you know the I I do that
[38:12] demonstration just to make the point
[38:14] that the Rapture is a real thing
[38:17] and and and so now we come down to our
[38:21] life here because while we're here then
[38:23] what's this life all about I'd say as
[38:25] I've said many times this life is not
[38:28] really so much about this when it's
[38:29] about the next one
[38:31] which is to say this life is preparing
[38:34] you for that one
[38:36] this life is a proving field
[38:39] training grounds amen and so you know
[38:43] brother Branham talks about the history
[38:45] of humanity coming down through brother
[38:47] Branham always when you go into various
[38:49] sermons one style that he loved to do
[38:53] and he's brilliant at it is going back
[38:55] and picking up Old Testament characters
[38:58] and bringing The Narrative of their life
[39:00] in in a thrilling sermon and I mean
[39:03] brother Branham had such an ability to
[39:05] go back and pick up somebody and just I
[39:08] mean in the next minute you're there
[39:09] you're just there you're just like wow
[39:11] and here you know brother Branham says
[39:13] it you know it must have been a a hot
[39:15] day when Amos topped the Hillside and he
[39:19] looked down and said as the sun beat on
[39:21] his head and his eyes narrowed as he
[39:23] looked at the sin of Jerusalem
[39:25] I see myself there wow I'm pulled right
[39:29] in that's a good Storyteller is Master
[39:31] at it
[39:33] so brother Branham would often times now
[39:35] but when you when you think about that
[39:37] there there's more rhyme and reason to
[39:41] that than just telling a good story
[39:45] because Paul didn't say they're good
[39:48] stories Paul said they're they're
[39:51] examples
[39:53] so an example is an example of something
[39:56] so this is an example of something
[39:59] coming and when it comes you're going to
[40:02] go back to the example and look at the
[40:04] example and then you'll understand when
[40:07] it becomes a greater reality
[40:09] and so that's why brother Brandon would
[40:11] use the illustration he said I could
[40:14] take my hand and put it against a wall
[40:17] and and and it and it's it it's not very
[40:20] defined but as it gets closer and closer
[40:23] it gets sharper and sharper but that's
[40:25] just the shadow it's not actually the
[40:28] positive and my hand is the positive so
[40:31] all the Old Testament was a shadow
[40:34] prophets priests Kings they all
[40:36] foreshadowed Jesus Christ
[40:39] you understand but they also but then
[40:41] when you realize that Jesus Christ that
[40:45] Jesus Christ isn't the only Christ in
[40:49] the godhead when you realize that his
[40:51] body his church his bride is a part of
[40:55] him and part of that great Eternal being
[40:59] then you realize that all of those
[41:02] Shadows are for me as well those Shadows
[41:05] spoke of something that I'm that I can
[41:07] relate to today
[41:11] the Bible is filled with the miraculous
[41:15] and uh and I'm taking this title tonight
[41:17] a sure thing and I I want you to
[41:21] understand tonight friends that the
[41:23] promises of God to his family are a sure
[41:27] thing
[41:28] and as brother Brandon was saying it
[41:30] makes our heart bleed but you know he
[41:33] said he goes on to say there he says
[41:35] really the only thing you can do is just
[41:38] be glad you see it
[41:41] and I'm I'm sorry that I can't prevent
[41:44] seven and a half billion people from
[41:46] rejecting it
[41:50] it's me to know that I have friends in
[41:53] in the world and then community and
[41:55] neighbors and business associates and
[41:59] unless they come the way that I have
[42:01] come they'll never they're going to end
[42:04] up there and not that that just that
[42:06] hurts my heart
[42:07] but but uh but I can't stop it as much
[42:10] as I regretted and God regrets it but
[42:13] God can't stop it either because that
[42:15] would deny people's free moral agency
[42:19] so he pleads with them and pleads with
[42:21] them and brother Branham says he sends
[42:23] preachers and gifts and wonders and
[42:26] signs and miracles and the power of the
[42:28] Holy Ghost and he's got a he's got a
[42:30] church and a bride in the last day
[42:31] moving throughout our communities being
[42:34] a light to say hey there's another way
[42:36] there's another way there's another way
[42:40] and I it's bad as it pains my heart that
[42:42] I can't I know ultimately I can't
[42:45] prevent seven and a half billion people
[42:48] but I can be very glad I see it I can be
[42:52] very glad I believe it and I'm
[42:53] determined to believe it I'm determined
[42:55] to believe it even more tonight
[43:02] it has a supernatural element
[43:05] that can do anything
[43:09] for your good
[43:11] God has thought of
[43:14] and God desires it's very clear in the
[43:18] scripture by all the examples
[43:20] and just the very fact that God
[43:22] intervenes
[43:24] to help his family
[43:26] with the miraculous with the
[43:29] supernatural brother Branham in the
[43:31] message hearing
[43:33] receiving and acting and I preached this
[43:36] hearing recognizing and acting
[43:38] at his Tabernacle about four months
[43:41] prior to this
[43:42] and but and of course recognizing he
[43:45] changes it here to hearing receiving
[43:46] because you know recognizing and then
[43:49] acting when you act when you hear
[43:52] receive and act upon it then
[43:55] then it recognizing becomes obvious it's
[43:58] obvious you recognized it so it becomes
[44:01] obvious in the action you take
[44:03] so he says here that there's talks about
[44:07] starts talking about delivering power
[44:09] now this this catches my attention
[44:11] because I'm not perfect yet
[44:15] I know that shocks y'all
[44:18] no for real I'm not no I'm not kidding
[44:20] no I'm really not I'm really not
[44:24] amen sorry sweetheart but I'm just not
[44:28] you doing here
[44:32] but I want to be
[44:35] I mean we I want to be like Jesus
[44:38] I'm a Christian say why do you want to
[44:40] be like this I'm a Christian he lives
[44:42] inside me I can feel something inside me
[44:44] trying to be a different part a
[44:46] different me
[44:47] and I and me desires that I desire that
[44:51] me to be me oh my it's hard to put into
[44:54] words isn't it but we all get it as I'm
[44:57] describing it to you you're getting it
[44:58] you're a Believer you're a Christian you
[45:00] know the battles we face and we want to
[45:03] be Overcomers and and brother Branham is
[45:06] bringing a sermon to show you this is
[45:09] how you become an overcomer it's a
[45:12] formula that's a sure thing
[45:15] you hear
[45:17] you receive it
[45:19] you you act upon it which means you
[45:22] recognized it now recognizing it is not
[45:24] just meaning that I recognize it as the
[45:26] word of God but I recognize that it's
[45:29] mine
[45:31] I recognize it's for me and if nobody
[45:35] else wants it I want it and if nobody
[45:38] else gets it I'm gonna get it and if
[45:40] nobody goes in a Rapture I'm going
[45:43] rapture
[45:45] so I recognize there's something to
[45:48] begot
[45:49] and I recognize there's something I want
[45:52] to get
[45:53] and so the the formula is very simple
[45:56] much like Peter's formula was simple it
[45:58] wasn't complicated for the Holy Ghost
[46:00] baptism
[46:01] which is the new birth
[46:03] they said what must we do these men were
[46:05] this wasn't a willy-nilly question these
[46:07] men were desperate
[46:10] Peter in a in one sermon
[46:12] in one sermon Peter had taken all their
[46:15] ideology of their entire life and all
[46:16] everything they'd trusted in Traditions
[46:18] and Bloated pieces
[46:20] and everything that these devout Jews
[46:22] had believed all their life since a
[46:24] child Peter with one indictment sermon
[46:27] had pulled the wool had pulled the rug
[46:30] out from underneath them and they
[46:33] realized we are lost they are realizing
[46:35] what Paul would later say that just
[46:38] because I'm I that's just because I've
[46:40] got the genetics back to Abraham now I'm
[46:43] realizing my goodness all of these
[46:46] abrahamic gened people killed the
[46:49] Messiah
[46:50] some suddenly imagine the The Epiphany
[46:54] that they had imagine the paradigm shift
[46:56] in their mind everything I've trusted in
[46:59] I'm I'm I'm not even secured in the
[47:03] Kingdom
[47:04] this isn't a small thing they're coming
[47:06] to Peter what must we do
[47:10] repent
[47:13] right but but I mean what must we do
[47:16] repent
[47:19] that's it yes
[47:23] touch it yes
[47:26] that's too easy it's not as easy as you
[47:29] think
[47:31] because you you got to face that man in
[47:33] the mirror
[47:35] you say well I repented well did you
[47:38] really
[47:40] did you really because repent means to
[47:43] take everything about you that ever was
[47:46] and ever in every plane of reality
[47:50] and throw that aside and make a complete
[47:54] turn completely totally and say I'm
[47:57] going this way now
[47:59] and this is why people repent at an
[48:03] altar and all they do is get some
[48:07] forgiveness for their past sins but they
[48:09] never really fully totally completely
[48:12] surrender in Repentance and when they
[48:15] don't do that the Holy Ghost doesn't
[48:17] come that Gene of God though it may be
[48:20] sitting there will not come to life
[48:21] until you have repented
[48:25] until you have so thoroughly surrendered
[48:28] you and given up your whole life that
[48:31] there's no way God will not seal a
[48:34] person into into that position without
[48:38] the without a full unfettered uh you
[48:42] know
[48:43] unmitigated no parameters no no holds no
[48:48] deals no ifs maybes it's a complete
[48:52] total repentance
[48:54] I don't want to be me anymore I want to
[48:58] be him
[48:59] and I am completely giving my whole life
[49:02] to him today
[49:04] and and then your first Act of obedience
[49:07] is to go to the water that's just a
[49:09] public demonstration you're trying to
[49:11] say to the world I have thoroughly
[49:13] repented I'm not the same man I used to
[49:16] be and that's the one the Holy Ghost
[49:18] will come in and change you and you'll
[49:21] never be the same person again
[49:25] because why you heard and you received
[49:30] and you acted upon the word of God
[49:35] and so people would come brother Branham
[49:38] speaking in the third person would say
[49:40] now you say but brother Branham I just
[49:44] can't throw these cigarettes down
[49:47] he says no you just haven't got the
[49:50] right remedy yet see you haven't got the
[49:54] care of it yet you just you just get the
[49:57] holy spirit in there and see how you can
[50:00] do it then picks up the old Shepherd in
[50:03] the Old Testament how he had a script
[50:05] bag and when he had a a lamb who was
[50:08] sick
[50:09] and if he can if he can get he's got a
[50:12] limestone over here that that line will
[50:15] bring healing into into the stomach of
[50:17] the Lamb he's all sick and throwing up
[50:18] and won't eat so the shepherd needs to
[50:21] get him to lick on the Limestone well he
[50:23] won't do that because Line's nasty and
[50:26] so what he'll do is he'll reach in his
[50:27] script bag and pull out some honey and
[50:29] smear it on the lime now the Sheep will
[50:32] go there immediately and start licking
[50:35] on that honey and what will happen is
[50:37] he'll be licking and licking and licking
[50:38] and his tongue will go numb and he'll go
[50:40] right into the lime and never know and
[50:42] end up healed
[50:44] and so brother Branham says I've got a
[50:47] whole script back here talking about
[50:48] Honey in the Rock my brother full of it
[50:51] and I'm going to put this honey here on
[50:53] the Rock and the rock is Christ Jesus
[50:55] not on something else but on Christ
[50:57] Jesus and you sick sheep go to licking
[51:00] I'm telling you watch this while you are
[51:03] licking on the honey raise up your hands
[51:06] and praise him that's the way you do it
[51:10] and in there you'll get some of the
[51:12] Limestone you'll get some of God's
[51:15] healing virtues
[51:17] and the beauty of it is the type isn't
[51:20] just for physical sickness it works the
[51:22] same way you'll get some of your sins
[51:25] forgiven not some but all of them and
[51:28] you get the Holy Spirit baptism
[51:31] so that's why we bring you to church and
[51:33] that's why we preach this is Honey in
[51:35] the Rock and as you hear it and you
[51:38] receive it and you act upon it
[51:41] and you end up healed you end up born
[51:44] again you end up full of the Holy Ghost
[51:46] oh what a plan friends and it's it's to
[51:49] one come one come all Hallelujah
[51:54] he says while you're licking on that
[51:56] honey
[51:58] something will happen to you
[52:02] this is why the best thing from somebody
[52:04] once the white brother Brandon answer
[52:05] the question the way he did how do we
[52:07] get closer to God read your Bible and
[52:09] pray
[52:10] because what are you doing you're
[52:11] looking on the honey
[52:12] see
[52:13] he says what will it do
[52:16] it'll separate you from the things of
[52:18] the world
[52:19] and it'll call them as nothing
[52:22] that you might live for Christ and do
[52:24] for Christ certainly yes sir that is
[52:25] such a statement
[52:27] that it will
[52:29] separate you from the things of the
[52:31] world
[52:32] now I love this
[52:34] and it'll call them as nothing that
[52:36] means that
[52:37] it won't just tell me
[52:40] stop doing that sinful thing and I go oh
[52:42] I better stop it I want to go to hell I
[52:44] want to miss a rapture and you're still
[52:47] just fighting it in your own your own
[52:48] battle you're still just trying to use
[52:49] gritted teeth
[52:51] you're just trying to you're just trying
[52:52] to tough it out
[52:54] you know and that that's not what the
[52:56] Holy Ghost is comes for the Holy Ghost
[52:58] comes to bring you peace that passes
[53:01] understanding peace like a river oh this
[53:04] is what does it do it'll happen
[53:06] something happens down onto you on the
[53:08] inside and those things that used to
[53:11] have such an appeal to you
[53:13] supernaturally mean nothing
[53:16] they mean nothing anymore I can stand
[53:19] here today how many believers who have
[53:21] been born again the spirit can say I
[53:23] used to I can't believe I used to go
[53:25] after those things they mean nothing to
[53:27] me now nothing I wouldn't do it for
[53:29] money it means nothing to me now
[53:34] why because I found out it was wrong no
[53:36] because my nature got changed and now my
[53:40] nature loves this my my nature and that
[53:43] that's the whole battle because this
[53:45] flesh will sometimes stumble and trip
[53:47] and and and then I've got a big old war
[53:49] and a fight and I gotta track him down
[53:51] to his knees get on your knees boy no I
[53:53] I like what he'll know you don't get on
[53:55] your knees boy oh it's church night
[53:57] we're going to church no I don't want to
[53:58] go you're going to church
[54:00] Hallelujah you're going to read your
[54:01] Bible you're going to pray because
[54:03] that's me taking over
[54:05] Hallelujah
[54:07] I'm hearing I'm recognizing I'm acting
[54:12] upon it
[54:15] see
[54:17] man and Brethren what can we do this was
[54:19] the question they asked Peter repent
[54:21] every one of you
[54:24] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[54:25] Jesus Christ for the remissions of sins
[54:27] and you shall
[54:29] not maybe
[54:31] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[54:35] brother Brandon says it like this I see
[54:39] a church
[54:40] speaking in tongues she shouting
[54:43] praising God prophesying and doing great
[54:46] Miracles and signs I look down the
[54:49] scripture it's a promise then I heard I
[54:53] recognized and I went into action he
[54:56] says amen I've been in action now for 31
[54:59] years oh let me tell you something
[55:01] brother I see a church full of the power
[55:03] of God I see a church living righteously
[55:06] I see a church making it into a Rapture
[55:08] how do you see that brother Jason
[55:10] because I see the promise of God's word
[55:12] and I see people who have heard and
[55:14] they're received and they're acting upon
[55:17] the promise of God
[55:19] see
[55:22] it put me in action
[55:25] I've been in action for 31 years it put
[55:27] me in action that's what the Holy Spirit
[55:31] does

[56:00] because it's a sure thing

[56:07] to do
[56:08] just
[56:09] surrender

[56:17] brother Branham said once that one when
[56:20] that Revelation struck him what do I
[56:23] have to do Just Surrender he'll take
[56:25] care of the rest of it brother Ram says

[58:50] you know what that that's a laugh line
[58:52] we laugh at that because that's funny
[58:57] that let me give you brother Brandon's
[58:59] word that's ridiculous
[59:02] to the carnal mind
[59:04] see it's hilarious
[59:06] to humans
[59:08] brother Branham compared he says can you
[59:10] imagine saying I'm going to go I'm going
[59:13] to take my wife and a mule and a stick
[59:15] and a baby and I'm gonna go take over
[59:18] Russia and tell Putin get out I'm in
[59:20] charge
[59:22] uh you wouldn't get out of your county
[59:24] before they had you locked up
[59:26] see you're going insane
[59:29] and he says we're going Moses I'm going
[59:31] down to take over how ridiculous to the
[59:33] carnal mind they say poor old Moses I
[59:35] guess the sun got too hot for him
[59:36] brother Ryan says no he said the he said
[59:38] I don't know what I don't know what the
[59:40] s-u-n did he said but one thing that
[59:42] happened is he got in the presence of
[59:43] the son and he said that got really hot
[59:46] and so no wonder the world thought he
[59:49] was crazy he hadn't been in the Su in
[59:51] too long he'd been in the in too
[59:53] long
[59:54] Hallelujah I love brother Richie told
[59:57] his former Pastor when he tried to when
[59:58] he jumped ship from the message and
[1:00:00] tried to take brother Richie with him
[1:00:01] and and brother Richie just looked him
[1:00:03] straight in the iron been his Pastor for
[1:00:05] all of his life and said buddy you left
[1:00:06] me in the sun too long
[1:00:10] I said I've been laying in the presence
[1:00:11] of the son all these years and I'm sorry
[1:00:15] you can go ahead to Perdition if you
[1:00:17] want to but I'm going to go all the way
[1:00:20] I'm going while I'm staying with the
[1:00:22] word
[1:00:23] you left me in the sun too long my
[1:00:26] so he says he goes he says so he says
[1:00:29] the pillar fired a burning bush see
[1:00:33] and that Pillar of Fire you know before
[1:00:36] Abraham was I am
[1:00:39] and the pillar of fire you know who
[1:00:41] shall I who shall I say sent me tell
[1:00:44] them I am hath sent you
[1:00:46] which was I preached on that before that
[1:00:49] you've always got to see where the I am
[1:00:50] is because it's it's always going to be
[1:00:52] God in a manifestation of of Flesh so
[1:00:56] you see where the I am is no matter
[1:00:57] who's who whatever prophets on the scene
[1:01:00] that's the I am because that's the word
[1:01:02] of God coming through him so Moses just
[1:01:04] go tell him you're me
[1:01:06] see and then and then don't worry that's
[1:01:09] going to sound ridiculous but then
[1:01:10] you'll cast down your stick and it'll
[1:01:12] turn to a snake and they know I'm the
[1:01:13] one that can do that and then you'll put
[1:01:15] your hand in here and bring it out it's
[1:01:16] leprosy lepers you put it back in it's
[1:01:18] clean they'll know I'm in you
[1:01:21] they'll know that you're speaking on my
[1:01:23] behalf they'll know that when they when
[1:01:25] they're hearing you they're hearing me
[1:01:27] oh Hallelujah friends that's why I'm
[1:01:29] glad for a prophet who brought a
[1:01:31] Supernatural Ministry and did things
[1:01:33] that only God could do
[1:01:36] because why it tells me this is a sure
[1:01:38] thing
[1:01:39] Hallelujah
[1:01:43] you see it's
[1:01:45] when you when you realize that coming
[1:01:47] from Genesis
[1:01:49] you you it's almost like there's a
[1:01:51] tunnel if I could try to picture this
[1:01:53] you can just follow me if I can just
[1:01:56] make it into into a description
[1:01:59] you know if you if you could look down
[1:02:02] this law this big tunnel and just look
[1:02:04] all the way back to Genesis
[1:02:06] and all down through the tunnel you
[1:02:09] would see people sticking their head in
[1:02:11] and waving at you and there would be
[1:02:13] Jonah
[1:02:14] here it'd be you know here be David and
[1:02:17] back here it'd be you know here's Joshua
[1:02:19] and way back here is Moses and keep on
[1:02:21] going back you're looking well back and
[1:02:22] way back there's Abraham going hey
[1:02:26] hey you know
[1:02:27] and then Abraham move left who's that oh
[1:02:31] it's Enoch oh wow
[1:02:33] see Enoch step to the right who oh it's
[1:02:36] able
[1:02:37] you'd be seeing all the way back to
[1:02:40] Genesis and you'd be seeing all the
[1:02:42] family of God and and the beauty of it
[1:02:45] is that that that that that every one of
[1:02:48] them was carrying forth the the plan to
[1:02:53] restore what fell
[1:02:55] because when God slew a lamb that was
[1:02:58] the beginning of the restoration
[1:03:00] and it was just simple and Abel caught a
[1:03:03] revelation I need to kill a lamb kill an
[1:03:04] animal and put him on an altar that's
[1:03:06] really all he understood
[1:03:07] he understood that it's going to take
[1:03:09] blood see
[1:03:10] and so from there it goes on and goes on
[1:03:13] and God adds on and adds on finally by
[1:03:16] the time you get to Enoch now Enoch's
[1:03:20] not bringing a lamb to an altar Enoch's
[1:03:22] building a giant monstrosity he's
[1:03:25] building this massive pyramid to that to
[1:03:28] this day they call the Great Pyramid
[1:03:32] because he's building a revelation
[1:03:35] you're you're seeing a manifestation of
[1:03:38] of a restoration this is this from in
[1:03:40] Seven Generations because seven is
[1:03:42] completion you'll you'll see seven
[1:03:44] blocks of seven it's like seven Church
[1:03:46] ages you can fit those in blocks of
[1:03:48] seven all the way back through the Old
[1:03:49] Testament makes a beautiful study but
[1:03:51] you can see from that by the time it
[1:03:54] gets to comes to Enoch now he's the
[1:03:56] seventh from Adam and so you're you're
[1:03:58] seeing a building blocks of Revelation
[1:04:00] Revelation revelation
[1:04:02] and then and then when and then when it
[1:04:05] all recycles under Noah and then what
[1:04:08] happens it starts over with Abraham and
[1:04:10] Noah comes out he's got a covenant and
[1:04:13] then it and then it's it's going to go
[1:04:14] and go and go and finally God's Gonna
[1:04:16] reach and find a heathen worshiper born
[1:04:18] in a heathen family with Heathen parents
[1:04:21] and Heathen customs and he's going to
[1:04:23] say Abram follow me where are we going
[1:04:25] just follow me
[1:04:27] and I'm just going to show you just
[1:04:29] going to leave everything behind and
[1:04:31] before Abraham there's no Jews
[1:04:35] Abraham is the first Jew
[1:04:38] you understand so so he's going to
[1:04:40] follow left his home not even knowing
[1:04:43] where he was going but God was going to
[1:04:45] lead him all the way and so so what
[1:04:48] you're seeing is that at every step this
[1:04:51] tunnel back to Genesis that God is
[1:04:54] showing the elements of the Genesis life
[1:04:57] when it was in force
[1:05:00] he's showing all through the Old
[1:05:03] Testament I I really got to labor on
[1:05:05] this for a minute because I'm going to
[1:05:06] give you some examples he's showing that
[1:05:09] in all of these stories that God is for
[1:05:12] foreshadowing
[1:05:14] that eventually when I get all the way
[1:05:17] to the end it's going to bring you back
[1:05:19] to the beginning
[1:05:21] and the Millennium is the seventh day
[1:05:24] never got finished so in the circle of
[1:05:27] things I I started here and the whole
[1:05:31] thing is just a big circle to bring us
[1:05:33] back to that seventh day and thusly
[1:05:36] everything you see through the Old
[1:05:38] Testament is is snapshots of the kind of
[1:05:42] power that was here and will be again
[1:05:46] amen and that that kind of power that
[1:05:49] was there is accessible to you here
[1:05:53] oh my
[1:05:55] see and so so I mean people resist
[1:05:58] Divine Healing and Supernatural power
[1:06:01] And yet when I look back in Genesis
[1:06:05] I mean healing Supernatural power huh
[1:06:09] Adam had control of nature yeah
[1:06:14] Adam could just speak and change the
[1:06:17] direction of the wind
[1:06:18] raise it or lower its temperature
[1:06:21] Adam could do landscaping by his words
[1:06:26] he could say 3 6 9 11 17 and no 20 okay
[1:06:33] I want all of y'all over here tree 14 3
[1:06:37] and 2 and 7. I want you all back over
[1:06:40] here on here and I need this mound to
[1:06:42] kind of level out push back up over here
[1:06:44] and I need a big Mount here with a
[1:06:46] waterfall coming down through here what
[1:06:47] are you doing Adam I'm building Eve a
[1:06:49] little garden here I love her and and
[1:06:51] and and I want her to have a nice place
[1:06:53] and I'm going to build it just for her
[1:06:56] and God walked with this man
[1:06:59] and visited him every day in the cool of
[1:07:02] the day
[1:07:03] and God came down and they spoke lip to
[1:07:06] ear face to face this is what we're
[1:07:09] headed back to so would you just
[1:07:11] remember everything you're seeing in the
[1:07:14] Old Testament and in Christ and in the
[1:07:17] early church is all it's all Snippets of
[1:07:21] that life
[1:07:22] and it's it's it's just stretching it
[1:07:25] out over 6 000 years to bring it all
[1:07:27] back and Heap it all up all the way in
[1:07:29] the Millennium when it's completely
[1:07:30] restored
[1:07:32] so so so when we when we see Adam in
[1:07:36] control of nature see and so I I mean I
[1:07:40] I just say to myself thank God because
[1:07:44] if there's a power that can control this
[1:07:46] nature
[1:07:48] oh my I'm not worried about moving the
[1:07:50] wind or replanting a tree I'll get a
[1:07:52] tractor but I would very much like to
[1:07:55] control this nature
[1:07:57] I would very much like to have access to
[1:07:59] that kind of power
[1:08:02] amen and so we see these preacts these
[1:08:07] these these preacts of demonstration all
[1:08:10] through the Old Testament now
[1:08:13] let me catch something for you watch I'm
[1:08:16] just going to go down this list very
[1:08:17] quickly
[1:08:18] everything that you're reading here
[1:08:21] these are miracles
[1:08:24] that took place in the Old Testament
[1:08:27] all right
[1:08:29] so if we go all the way back to Exodus 7
[1:08:32] we'll begin
[1:08:34] we find that water is made blood
[1:08:38] we find did you know that could happen
[1:08:41] water is turned into blood
[1:08:44] frogs are produced out of thin air
[1:08:48] they're spoken into creation so are lice
[1:08:51] sow our flies
[1:08:53] boils Thunder locusts Darkness death of
[1:08:58] the firstborn
[1:09:00] this is all the power of God
[1:09:02] demonstrating itself this is all the
[1:09:05] kind of power that that God has intended
[1:09:08] for his family to not only wield but to
[1:09:11] be in perfect control of
[1:09:15] death of the first form the Red Sea
[1:09:18] Mara's waters are sweetened Manna is
[1:09:21] sent water from the rock of her Freedom
[1:09:23] Aaron's Rod is budding nadab and abihu
[1:09:26] are consumed the burning of tibera
[1:09:28] earthquake and fire water flowing from
[1:09:31] The Rock serpent healing the Israelites
[1:09:33] a serpent on a pole
[1:09:36] I mean that this is these are acts of
[1:09:38] God that term that even insurance
[1:09:40] companies use today is well earned it's
[1:09:42] an act of God see
[1:09:44] and so we find that water is Flowing
[1:09:47] from Iraq a serpent on a pole is healing
[1:09:51] people's bodies balen's eyes is speaking
[1:09:54] the River Jordan is divided the walls of
[1:09:57] Jericho fall down the Sun and the Moon
[1:09:59] stand still
[1:10:02] water flows from a rock
[1:10:07] these are Genesis powers
[1:10:10] Unleashed
[1:10:13] this is God this is this is brother
[1:10:16] Brandon would say all the lives of all
[1:10:20] the people was all one goal that God had
[1:10:22] in his mind of expression and it was God
[1:10:25] expressing it wasn't it wasn't just you
[1:10:27] say well these were situations that
[1:10:30] arose and so God came in on the rescue
[1:10:32] don't be so sure that a lot of it wasn't
[1:10:35] God setting things up
[1:10:37] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:10:39] I've had God work in my life
[1:10:41] and put me in a situation and then bring
[1:10:44] it around and bring a miracle and I come
[1:10:46] out and and I'm thanking God and I'm
[1:10:48] thinking Lord did you set me up just so
[1:10:50] that could happen they here's a man sick
[1:10:52] in the days of Jesus and they said who
[1:10:55] sinned in this case his which parents
[1:10:58] sin he's Jesus said nobody this was only
[1:11:00] done so that God could get Glory now I'm
[1:11:02] going to go I'm getting ready to go to
[1:11:03] work
[1:11:04] see and so I mean and that's just powers
[1:11:08] of of God moving in nature the
[1:11:11] Philistines are strained before the ark
[1:11:13] the men of Beth Shemesh are smitten
[1:11:16] Thunder
[1:11:18] have you ever read in first Samuel the
[1:11:21] Philistines here is Samuel trying to
[1:11:24] hold a church service
[1:11:26] and he's offering a sacrifice and right
[1:11:28] when when when he's in church the
[1:11:31] Philistines come trying to kill
[1:11:32] everybody and there's not even enough
[1:11:35] time to Marshal the army they don't need
[1:11:38] it the Bible said God thundered from
[1:11:42] heaven and smote them
[1:11:45] broke them to pieces with just Thunder
[1:11:48] you're talking about a shock wave can
[1:11:50] you imagine I've had thunder so loud I
[1:11:53] jumped off the ground but I've never
[1:11:55] seen Thunder that smashed men's bones
[1:11:58] and bursted uh uh their bodies but
[1:12:03] literally Thunder destroys a Philistine
[1:12:06] Army go over read it in first Samuel
[1:12:08] chapter seven thunder and rain in the
[1:12:10] Harvest the sound and the mulberry trees
[1:12:13] I love that story
[1:12:15] so David you're gonna go kill the people
[1:12:16] you're going to kill the enemy okay to
[1:12:19] what I do okay go go in the field and
[1:12:20] lay down and hide
[1:12:22] well I don't sound like I'm gonna kill
[1:12:23] anybody it's okay just pay attention I
[1:12:25] just need your whole Army just to lay
[1:12:27] down
[1:12:28] in the in the High Grass near the
[1:12:30] mulberry trees okay Lord this doesn't
[1:12:32] really sound like something Cicero would
[1:12:34] do this is what kind of battle plan is
[1:12:36] this
[1:12:36] and the Lord said here's what's going to
[1:12:38] do David
[1:12:39] you're going to get your whole Army it's
[1:12:40] going to lay down be quiet and when the
[1:12:42] enemy comes out he said wait until you
[1:12:46] hear the sound of Marching In the tops
[1:12:49] of the trees
[1:12:50] and you'll know that me and my Army have
[1:12:53] went out ahead of you just fall in
[1:12:55] behind
[1:12:57] that's all you got to do when I do that
[1:12:59] just fall in and by the time they fall
[1:13:01] in and get there the Army's already
[1:13:03] slaughtered can you imagine being the
[1:13:04] army that got slaughtered By Angels
[1:13:08] this is God demonstrating Genesis life
[1:13:12] do you understand what the Holy Ghost is
[1:13:15] it's to bring that's why brother Branham
[1:13:18] said I see a church with power and
[1:13:20] tongues and prophecy I see Overcomers I
[1:13:23] see Victory I see young people follow
[1:13:25] the Holy Ghost why because it's Genesis
[1:13:29] this word is taking us back to that it's
[1:13:31] not just happenstance it's not just God
[1:13:34] being a faithful friend this is a you're
[1:13:36] part of a grand scheme a grand plan the
[1:13:40] Plan of Redemption would blow your mind
[1:13:46] thunder sound in the mulberry trees
[1:13:48] Uzziah struck Dead jeroboam's Hand is
[1:13:50] wither the winner of seraphats has meal
[1:13:53] reproduced say
[1:13:55] Those Old Testament days were something
[1:13:58] right where I was in India with brother
[1:14:00] James walls
[1:14:02] he went to a sister
[1:14:04] and preached in her in a church in India
[1:14:08] and
[1:14:10] and uh he preached on this Widow who had
[1:14:13] her meal multiplied in her oil
[1:14:16] and when he was done preaching a woman
[1:14:20] come forward to get the pastor to say
[1:14:23] I'm the Widow
[1:14:26] she never know the stories in the Bible
[1:14:27] she said I'm the Widow and the Pastor
[1:14:30] said we all know your widow's sister
[1:14:31] we're praying for you God will send you
[1:14:33] perhaps another husband she says no no
[1:14:35] no no no she said this man preached my
[1:14:39] life
[1:14:39] he said what do you mean
[1:14:41] she said at my home I have no money I
[1:14:45] have nothing and me and my child but
[1:14:48] every day I go to my flower and my meal
[1:14:51] and it's full to the top and I scoop out
[1:14:53] and scoop out and make us food and I
[1:14:55] close it back and I get oil and dip it
[1:14:56] out and cook our food and the next day
[1:14:58] it's all full again
[1:15:01] she was the woman in the Bible
[1:15:03] in the 20th 21st century
[1:15:07] you think that's a myth that's a true
[1:15:09] story they went and interviewed her and
[1:15:11] took her picture brother James told me
[1:15:13] said brother Jason he said I wanted to
[1:15:16] see it with my own eyes he said I he
[1:15:19] said we arranged he said come to my
[1:15:21] house I'll fix everybody a meal he said
[1:15:23] sister your Widow you have nothing she
[1:15:25] said don't worry God is feeding us and
[1:15:27] they get to her little bitty her little
[1:15:30] bitty Shack and I've been in some of
[1:15:31] them
[1:15:32] and the pastor brother James he's a big
[1:15:35] old boy he could eat and he's there and
[1:15:38] the pastor's there and a bunch of other
[1:15:39] people and she just she goes over and
[1:15:41] opens up her meal Cooks all kinds of
[1:15:43] cakes and oil and makes it all up and
[1:15:45] feeds him brother James said we ate too
[1:15:47] we were busting and he said I'm sitting
[1:15:49] there and there's the meal right on the
[1:15:50] counter nobody's touching it he said I
[1:15:52] watched her dip out of it and dip out of
[1:15:54] it and dip out of it and scoop out of it
[1:15:55] and scoop out of it and he said when it
[1:15:57] got done he said I walked over and I
[1:16:01] took the lid off of the tin again he
[1:16:04] said brother Jason the manufacturers uh
[1:16:07] print was in the top of the of the meal
[1:16:10] he said it pushed it up and and tattooed
[1:16:14] it
[1:16:15] and he said I opened the oil and it was
[1:16:18] about you couldn't move it because it
[1:16:19] would spill over
[1:16:20] he said while we were sitting there
[1:16:22] feeding our faces Angels were just
[1:16:23] walking over and dumping more in
[1:16:27] I'm here to tell you you're serving the
[1:16:28] god of Genesis power
[1:16:30] you're not in this thing by accident
[1:16:32] this is for Real

[1:17:18] oh as Paul said what can I say more for
[1:17:21] time would fail me to tell him Gideon
[1:17:22] and a parrot and of Samson and of
[1:17:25] jephthah and of David also in Samson and
[1:17:27] all the prophets who through faith
[1:17:29] subdued kingdoms who brought
[1:17:31] righteousness who obtained promises
[1:17:34] Hallelujah women had their dead reached
[1:17:37] back this is your life this is what God
[1:17:39] has called us to
[1:17:43] we're not we're not weaklings we're not
[1:17:45] left defenseless in this world Genesis
[1:17:48] is returning no wonder we see tongues
[1:17:51] and prophecy and power and miracles
[1:17:53] taking place
[1:17:57] and God having provided some better
[1:17:59] thing for us that they without us should
[1:18:02] not be made perfect
[1:18:04] that 40th verse clearly meant
[1:18:08] that the things were not finished
[1:18:10] happening
[1:18:12] those he Paul said he goes down this
[1:18:15] whole list this and this and this and
[1:18:17] this and this and yet all these having
[1:18:20] obtained a good report through faith
[1:18:22] received not the promise God having
[1:18:24] provided some better thing for us that
[1:18:27] they without us should not be made
[1:18:28] perfect it clearly means that they're
[1:18:30] not finished they're not going to be
[1:18:33] made perfect until it was happening in
[1:18:35] the church and the early church isn't
[1:18:38] going to be made perfect until it's
[1:18:39] happening in you
[1:18:41] until it's happening in me that's why
[1:18:43] the Rapture is such a momentous it's all
[1:18:46] the ages all coming to Perfection now
[1:18:49] think of the privilege that you have you
[1:18:52] are your life of overcoming you hearing
[1:18:55] recognizing and being willing to act
[1:18:58] upon the word of God is going to raise
[1:19:00] the sleeping Saints from the grave
[1:19:04] oh my
[1:19:06] we see Abel with his ability to hear and
[1:19:09] recognize and to act
[1:19:10] on the revealed word
[1:19:13] so that that's that's something that
[1:19:15] started
[1:19:16] and it has to finish
[1:19:20] trying to skip some things and go down
[1:19:21] told more I was going to preach 25
[1:19:22] minutes
[1:19:23] it's probably gonna laugh at me when I
[1:19:25] get home
[1:19:30] Abel started with a lamb
[1:19:33] God coming all the way from Abel's lamb
[1:19:37] to the time of Abraham's day
[1:19:40] and you went from a lamb to God standing
[1:19:43] in a human form
[1:19:46] you see the progress
[1:19:48] and that foretold Christ's first coming
[1:19:52] and his second coming again
[1:19:55] that as it was in in the days of lot as
[1:19:58] it was in the days of Noah and brother
[1:19:59] Branham goes back to Abraham on the
[1:20:01] mountain he's not down there with lot
[1:20:03] because why he heard he recognized he
[1:20:05] acted on the word of God
[1:20:07] he stayed separate and now God is
[1:20:10] visiting him and listen friends
[1:20:14] when you look at it like this way when I
[1:20:16] when I started to view this today and I
[1:20:18] started thinking about it
[1:20:20] and I thought
[1:20:22] you know here here God is coming
[1:20:25] standing in a human form
[1:20:28] and he's got a further demonstration now
[1:20:31] of Genesis life that Adam enjoyed even
[1:20:34] even to Creation power now is is is to
[1:20:38] provide a sacrifice because
[1:20:40] Abraham doesn't have a sacrifice it's
[1:20:43] going to take creation power to create
[1:20:46] one
[1:20:48] and when you realize
[1:20:50] that's what we're going to have to have
[1:20:52] is creation power
[1:20:54] now we all fall back and go man I ain't
[1:20:57] hardly got enough power to cure a
[1:20:59] headache
[1:21:00] how am I going to change my mortal flesh
[1:21:03] remember friends God created the lamb
[1:21:07] God created that RAM on the Mountaintop
[1:21:09] so when you think about it three things
[1:21:12] happened in Rapid succession God made
[1:21:15] the call God issued the requirement and
[1:21:18] then God provided the solution to his
[1:21:20] own demand
[1:21:21] Hallelujah God made the call to him God
[1:21:24] issued the requirement and then God
[1:21:26] provided the solution to his own demand
[1:21:29] so when we read that 16th verse of our
[1:21:32] Tech our opening text so that it is not
[1:21:34] of him that willeth nor of him that
[1:21:36] runeth but God that showeth Mercy you
[1:21:40] see Abraham's part was only Abraham's
[1:21:43] part your part was only to hear and to
[1:21:46] recognize and to act upon it Abraham
[1:21:49] heard it Abraham saddled it up Abraham
[1:21:52] acted upon the promise of God
[1:21:56] he stumbled in weakness
[1:21:59] Abraham had weaknesses
[1:22:01] Abraham Baxley went off down to Egypt
[1:22:04] run from Hard Times see he stumbled in
[1:22:08] human weakness yes but his faith never
[1:22:11] staggered at the promise
[1:22:13] you know why and how I know that because
[1:22:15] he kept going
[1:22:17] and that's really what it is to us
[1:22:20] friends
[1:22:21] we keep going
[1:22:23] we stumble Abraham stumbled he stumbled
[1:22:27] again he stumbled again he stumbled down
[1:22:29] in Egypt he stumbled to the Philistine
[1:22:31] King he's still stumbling but yet he's
[1:22:33] also still going he stumbled again and
[1:22:37] he kept going again how many here today
[1:22:39] can say I'm a true son of Abraham I
[1:22:42] stumbled and then I stumbled again but
[1:22:44] I'm going again but then I stumbled
[1:22:47] again now what are you going to do I'm
[1:22:48] gonna go again well then what I'm gonna
[1:22:50] go again and again and again Hallelujah
[1:22:53] so so the thing that slaps the Devil's
[1:22:56] face in the end friends is when you when
[1:22:59] you think about it like this that that
[1:23:01] all of that failure and success and
[1:23:03] failure and success and repenting and
[1:23:06] keep going all of that had one
[1:23:08] accomplishment it put Abraham in the
[1:23:11] tent door and the plains of mammary when
[1:23:14] the when God came and visited him to
[1:23:16] confirm a promise I'm here to tell you
[1:23:19] yes I got ups and downs yes I got
[1:23:21] weaknesses but I've heard I've
[1:23:23] recognized I'm acting on the word of God
[1:23:25] I'm going to keep going forward and you
[1:23:27] say my life has been this and my life
[1:23:29] has been that and I've had this failure
[1:23:31] all I can tell you is all of that put
[1:23:33] you here right now in this service and
[1:23:38] you have the opportunity to slap the
[1:23:40] devil's face and say no matter what it's
[1:23:43] been I have heard and I have recognized
[1:23:47] nice to act upon the word of God
[1:23:53] this is the privilege of the redeemed
[1:23:56] you have the it's handed to you
[1:24:04] listen to what he did
[1:24:06] the Lord appeared to him in the plains
[1:24:07] of memories he sat in the tent Door In
[1:24:09] the Heat of the day
[1:24:11] he lifted up his eyes and looked and
[1:24:12] three men stood by him and when he saw
[1:24:14] them
[1:24:15] he ran to meet them from the tent door
[1:24:17] he ran
[1:24:19] you know what he did
[1:24:21] bowed himself
[1:24:23] toward the ground
[1:24:26] every excuse
[1:24:29] and every success
[1:24:32] and every failure
[1:24:34] and every promise
[1:24:36] and every repentance
[1:24:39] brought him
[1:24:40] to that moment
[1:24:44] and what was his response to all of it
[1:24:48] surrender
[1:24:50] he bowed himself
[1:24:53] to the ground
[1:24:55] that's where you need to be at this
[1:24:57] evening
[1:24:58] bow yourself to the ground because
[1:25:00] that's what a prophet said what can I do
[1:25:03] surrender
[1:25:05] what can I do brother Jason surrender
[1:25:08] her oh friends let's stand to our feet
[1:25:11] this evening I don't want to go any
[1:25:13] further I've got more notes but I feel
[1:25:15] the unction of the holy spirit this is a
[1:25:17] moment where the Holy Spirit can just
[1:25:19] sweep down over an audience I'm here to
[1:25:21] tell you something friends you have you
[1:25:23] have heard you have recognized and you
[1:25:26] have acted upon the word of God come
[1:25:28] musicians Cumberland Anthony
[1:25:30] this is what it this is what it all
[1:25:33] comes down to is to be able to to be
[1:25:35] able to surrender
[1:25:38] brother Brandon makes an interesting
[1:25:40] statement I'm going to read this last
[1:25:41] thing
[1:25:43] as they play
[1:25:46] at their choosing just something soft
[1:25:48] and
[1:25:49] appropriate
[1:25:54] now listen to your prophet
[1:25:57] because now it's really gonna what this
[1:26:00] next few lines here this thing's really
[1:26:03] going to turn northward and come home
[1:26:05] all right this is going to come right to
[1:26:07] your heart
[1:26:09] he says God gives a promise
[1:26:13] and when his Spirit comes
[1:26:15] it fulfills that promise
[1:26:19] first thing you hear it preached
[1:26:23] it's what you did tonight
[1:26:25] then you recognize
[1:26:27] that that's God's truth
[1:26:29] now
[1:26:31] how many recognize tonight what you
[1:26:32] heard
[1:26:34] how many have proven that it's God's
[1:26:36] truth
[1:26:39] then
[1:26:40] you go into action
[1:26:45] see
[1:26:46] look at that one-man invasion of Moses
[1:26:49] down into Egypt
[1:26:50] seemed impossible didn't it because
[1:26:52] really the bottom line is there's times
[1:26:55] where we come to our life
[1:26:57] and and you might be there tonight I
[1:27:01] certainly know I've been
[1:27:03] where I'm about to describe
[1:27:06] where something has a grip on you but
[1:27:09] you don't want it to because you want to
[1:27:10] serve God
[1:27:13] anything from a debilitating physical
[1:27:16] fitness sickness
[1:27:18] to a debilitating spiritual sickness
[1:27:20] where the devil has got something on you
[1:27:23] and you want free and you fight it and
[1:27:25] you fight it don't remember that
[1:27:27] remember the man came oh brother Brandon
[1:27:29] if I could just quit these cigarettes if
[1:27:31] I could just quit sinning brother Brown
[1:27:32] says no you just ain't found the right
[1:27:34] thing yet
[1:27:35] you just ain't found the right remedy
[1:27:37] yet see
[1:27:39] he says Moses this was totally
[1:27:41] impossible but the strange part of it is
[1:27:45] he did it
[1:27:47] and you can do it
[1:27:50] said why how did he do it why he heard
[1:27:53] the right voice he recognized and he
[1:27:57] obeyed
[1:27:58] and you say now what's brother Brian I'm
[1:28:00] here I'm reading these last quotes this
[1:28:03] this is I'm getting ready to read you
[1:28:04] the statement that inspired this whole
[1:28:06] sermon tonight
[1:28:09] you say
[1:28:11] I can't do it
[1:28:14] you should go and listen
[1:28:17] to this sermon
[1:28:19] in June of 1960.
[1:28:22] hearing
[1:28:23] and not recognizing but receiving
[1:28:25] hearing receiving and acting
[1:28:28] and brother Branham screams it out yes
[1:28:31] you can
[1:28:32] you say I can't do it yes you can
[1:28:38] Obama didn't invent that
[1:28:40] the prophet invented that
[1:28:43] yes you can
[1:28:45] if God speaks to you
[1:28:47] recognize it to be his promise go into
[1:28:50] action and see what God does we'll take
[1:28:53] over the crippled says I can't walk yes
[1:28:56] you can
[1:28:58] Jesus said so amen that's right whatever
[1:29:00] things you desire pray and believe you
[1:29:02] shall have them maybe the man's got
[1:29:04] cancer says I can't live yes you can
[1:29:07] God said so Moses she's going down to
[1:29:10] take over Egypt why it's impossibility
[1:29:13] but he said but I'm going to do it
[1:29:15] anyhow I want to take some friends you
[1:29:17] think Moses didn't stop along the way
[1:29:19] and think about that murdered Egyptian
[1:29:22] he buried in the sand you think he did
[1:29:24] he didn't think about I mean God even
[1:29:26] knew in advance he would Smite The Rock
[1:29:28] twice
[1:29:29] God even knows I've got failures yet
[1:29:32] I'll make but he still calls me
[1:29:34] he still calls me and in spite of my
[1:29:37] past in spite of weaknesses I might have
[1:29:39] tomorrow I'm here to tell you say I
[1:29:41] can't get free yes you can
[1:29:43] I almost called this sermon tonight yes
[1:29:46] you can
[1:29:47] I could hear it for days I've been going
[1:29:49] around I hear that I hear the prophets
[1:29:51] in my mind I can hear his voice yes you
[1:29:53] can he's so positive he's so sure I'm
[1:29:56] here to tell you if you've heard the
[1:29:58] word and you've recognized the word and
[1:30:00] you're acting upon the word you just
[1:30:02] here recognize and act and brother
[1:30:03] Branham said see what happens see what
[1:30:06] God does God will come and do more than
[1:30:09] you can think to ask so it can't be
[1:30:12] healed yes you can I can't go free yes
[1:30:14] you can I can't get over yes you can yes
[1:30:18] you can
[1:30:19] because it's God's promised word in this
[1:30:22] hour
[1:30:26] sometimes we don't want to
[1:30:29] even sometimes we you know Spurgeon
[1:30:32] talks about people who gather the most
[1:30:33] manna he says he who chooses to gather
[1:30:36] much Mana will find that he may have as
[1:30:39] much as he desires
[1:30:41] friends let me tell you something don't
[1:30:43] leave
[1:30:44] when I when I was in marketing one of
[1:30:46] the things they always taught me

[1:30:53] the customer but don't leave it on the
[1:30:54] table
