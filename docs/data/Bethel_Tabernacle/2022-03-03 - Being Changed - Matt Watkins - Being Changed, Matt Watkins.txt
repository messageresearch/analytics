aren't you so grateful the lord can visit us when we invite him amen he comes where he's invited romans chapter 7 i'd like to just take a text here and a thought that i know that i won't have time to finish i just feel so overloaded and weighed down and um but that's all right we'll get to the portion the lord has for us and then and then the lord if he sees fit we'll continue this some other time romans chapter 7 we just want to begin reading here and i want to um i want to title this being changed being changed let's just begin reading here at verse seven let's let's move beyond that we're just going to save time verse 12 wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good was then that which is good made death unto me god forbid sin that it might appear sin worketh death in me by that which is good sin by the commandment might become i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i if then i do that which i would not i can send unto the law that it is good now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin we bow our heads tonight lord jesus we just need you right now father we need your help have mercy lord god upon us i pray that you would just have grace that you would pour it out abundantly lord to your children those lord that have gathered here tonight on a wednesday those that are listening by stream or by later maybe in an archive i pray that your word would just come and meet their need we believe father that you're the same today yesterday and forever that you don't change lord i pray god that you would come by your word by your promised lord that you would be wherever two or three are gathered there you would be in our midst so we're gathered here tonight lord in your spirit we've invited you we've sang we've worshipped lord we've read your word now god i pray that you would come and do what we can't do in every heart and every life may you get glory from it in jesus christ's name and the church said amen you can be seated romans chapter 7 if you'll hold that there with me and then also just have my powerpoint ready i'm going to read some things that i have on the powerpoint and then there are some things that i didn't have time to put up but i just want to go through them i believe it's so important that we uh romans 7 especially is what you would maybe call a debated controversial passage and many opinions have been taken upon this passage uh by different if you read just commentaries of biblical commentators you'll find a multitude of different opinions some believe maybe paul was not referring to himself was this a reference that he's speaking about his own struggle or is he just speaking generically or generally about people is paul talking about a person who's not been born again and this is a pre-state when he speaks about and says i'm no good thing in my flesh and i find that a law that when i would want to do good evil's present and i find that the things that i want to do i don't do and those things that i don't want to do i find myself doing and so paul is talking about this inner nature this two natures this this flesh that wars against this nature of the spirit and he begins to to relate here and we've preached this has been spoken on many times i'm not going to get too bogged down into the teaching of it but i just want to highlight just a few things because i believe it's important we have a biblical understanding of and a right understanding of the truth of what paul is actually saying here and i'm so glad we have the light of the message that has brings clarity in the midst of confusion we always have an answer and so is paul speaking about here in this romans 7 14 through is he's speaking about a person who's not born again this is this is what paul experienced prior to being born of the spirit or is this a believer is he speaking about the struggle of a person who's been born again or is he saying that this is something that takes place before you receive the baptism of the holy ghost and then after you receive the baptism of the holy ghost then that struggle is over and and and there's no more war and the war is over and now you live by the law of the spirit well let me just say that the in in one way as much as there is answers in in every time that you have a question and there's multiple answers there's usually truth in both answers and and most people are seeing a part of truth but maybe not all of it then the other one who would give a different answer sees a portion of that truth but maybe he doesn't see all of it so you could say it could apply to anybody is paul speaking here generically about anybody yes is he speaking about himself personally yes he's telling us about a real personal struggle that's why he says uh o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me so he's speaking personally here is he speaking to a struggle uh prior to the new birth and pride and then after the new birth yes both both are true this is something that that uh that i believe brother branham answers so clearly and i'm just going to read and i wish i would have had time to put it on the screen and i didn't so let me just read here and you just pay attention as best that you can i'm going to skip a lot of this because a lot of it just is very long brother branham says let me just kind of polish it up as you can see paul said in me as two persons two persons one wants me to do wrong the other one wants me to do every time i start to do right then wrong hinders me you are an outward man which is controlled by six senses you are an inward man controlled by one sense which is faith and this faith disagrees with all six senses if the sixth senses don't agree with faith let me read that again he says and this faith disagrees with all six senses if the six senses don't agree with faith but one is contrary to the other now as long as the six senses agree with the faith wonderful but when the six senses disagrees with faith lead then leave the six senses alone now for instance here jesus made a statement a promise the inside man says that's true the outside man reasons that it can't be true to you then ignore the outside man and accept the inside man [Applause] now that's the same thing paul is speaking of he was sold under under the law to carnal sin every one of us is the same that's the reason we have the troubles we do of married four or five times and that all kinds of sin adulteries and everything else along in our life is because of those things we are carnal and that part must perish but then inside we are a spirit man soul inside and that's faith in god's he says and that's faith in god's word then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by faith by accepting what god said that's important you've got to accept what god said or you'll never bring this outward intellect under subjection to what faith tells you right how can i take a cocker bro listen to this what brother says i'm going to take a cockle burrow and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be done is because inside that cocklebur has been transmitted from a cocker bore we from a cockapur wheat a cocker bro to a germ called wheat life then you bury that cocklebur and it'll produce a grain of wheat because there has been a life of wheat put in it and the life of that cocklebur has been taken out but the nature of the cocklebur is still sticky and it will be until this new life has been fully developed out of the ground and raised up again when it comes forth then it's no more cocklebur but wheat but listen but while it's here on earth and in the out of the earth a cocklebur it's still sticky but it's got the nature on the inside of it that's wheat and as long as you're in this life listen to me very carefully because this is the way brother branham says this is just beautiful hallelujah uses this and he's answering romans 7 what paul is speaking of here he says and as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ and all the sin is gone from you see that's the thing may i say this brother adam begins to speak about an indian and he talks about this man who he could only say uh me sick and you i'm gonna skip this but brother madam speaks of the indian man and he's saying me sick and that's the only english and billy paul's trying to get him to tell him what what's your problem because daddy told me not to take anyone with a tummy ache or something small it's got to be major and chief just kept saying me sick and brother and meets him later he's been converted and brother branham has a talk with him and and let me just move it here and he and and he says uh come to find out he said i talked to that missionary he said brother branham uh he said he said that's all he can say he said i taught him to say me sick that's the only thing that's right so that's the thing about it let me just move because i want to make sure i don't yeah here it is right here he says someone told me though he was converted he received the holy ghost and he said to him how are you getting along he said pretty good and pretty bad this is the chief pretty good and pretty bad he said well how do you mean pretty bad and pretty good he said well since me received the holy ghost he said there's been two dogs in me and one of them a black dog and one of them a white dog and said they argue all the time they growl and fight at one another and said the white dog wants me to do good the black dog wants me to do bad said well chief which one of them wins the fight chief said that depends on which one chief feeds the most so i think that's a good answer here see there just depends on the warning of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of god that does it that does it let's go just a little bit further here any brother adam's speaking here and he says he says uh angelic beans i love this he says about 60 some odd years after pentecost here he's sent his angel to signify things unto his servant john that must must shortly come to pass now when the book brother branham's speaking of john and the john in the book of revelations and he says he says it was wrote before the foundation of the worlds and he says angelic beings associate together oh i hope you get that that just dropped right down free he says look if you've got the holy spirit and if you've got the holy spirit in you then you're a candidate for association with the unseen world and the supernatural so if you've got the holy ghost brother branham says then you're a candidate to an association with an unseen world and to the supernatural he says no wonder people can't believe in those things they've never come in contact they've got nothing in here to believe with but when the holy spirit comes into the heart quickly he begins then a twofold being amen amen so now brother madam says when the holy spirit comes into the heart now he's a twofold two of you two persons he becomes a twofold being one of the earth to die and one in heaven to live in his body he is still subject to death but in his soul he's passed from death unto life in his body he has his earthly contact with his five senses in his spirit he has his contact with god through the holy ghost and the angels of god visits them and speaks with them and they are messengers sent from god to reveal and to bring messages from god to the individual amen so what do you become when you become born again with the holy ghost you're a candidate for angels to angelic godly angels to influence you to minister to you to teach you to lead you to guide you remember brother branham answers that question when they said what about an angel does an angel follow you and brother madam says absolutely doesn't the bible say that the angels of the lord encamp about them that fear him and brother venom begins to talk about a baby when it's born he says there's an angel there that's waiting for that life to give it breath that it becomes a living soul and he says and that angel is there remember brother branham says that there was always he said i should have served the lord he said i wish i would have came to the lord earlier sooner than he did and he says but a spirit hung over me remember so there's they remember remember this young people i'll just say it to all of us there's always before you're born of the spirit of god and after you're born of the spirit of god there's always two spirits trying to influence you there's a spirit if you're not born of the spirit of god and you're sitting here tonight unregenerated by the holy ghost and you're born how you were born into the world there's a spirit a demon angel spirit that has been assigned to you he knows all about you the devil studies you he knows your makeup he plays on your complexes he plays on your the things that you receive generationally by your parents he plays on your attitudes he and the devil will always be there to try to prevent you from receiving the holy ghost but there's also a spirit that follows you that's trying to encourage you and anoint your faith and bring you to the baptism of the holy ghost there's always a war going on it's which one are you going to surrender to he says and the angels of god visits them speaks with them they're messengers they bring messages to the individual he's out to get the first things first he says you can't put the cupola on before the foundation is laid so we got to remember that put things first seek ye first the kingdom of god we know brother branham says we know we make mistakes now he's speaking to a born-again believer here we know we make mistakes and it's funny to me because the same people who will teach that romans 7 is prior to being born again well do you know what if you are if you're suggesting that paul is saying that romans 7 at war and have this battle i'm carnal there's no good thing in me and and when i want to do right evil is present and and that i find then that the things that i want to do after the spirit i don't do and the things that i don't want to do i find myself doing if if someone wants to say that's prior to being born again then what you're saying is is that after you're born again you don't sin anymore you don't make mistakes anymore and it's funny how those people will only classify the big mistakes they forget that the sin is sin and pornography and pride is both sin and there's not either one of them that's any worse than the other right bitterness even unforgiveness jesus said if you don't forgive those your father in heaven can't even forgive you it's amazing how we classify and categorize sin jealousy is as sinful as meth as method or or marijuana or alcohol it's as sinful you hold on to unforgiveness someone did something to me you could be born of the spirit of god sitting in church but if you hold on and let a root of bitterness come into your heart and you can't forgive somebody who wronged you you're as in sin that's sinful as smoking a joint now i know legalists don't like to hear that but did not didn't paul say though i speak with the tongue of men and angels though i have prophecies though i have dreams and visions if i don't have charity all of those things mean zero well that's true so brother man says you meant so what is it it would have to be if you if you say it was romans 7 is speaking to someone who's prior to boring and then that means that you don't make mistakes that the war is over and there's no struggle and there's no battle well the problem with that teaching is it's not biblical and it's not according to the message so if you want to teach it that's fine but it's not according to what brother branham taught i'll stick with what brother and i'm talking he says we know we make mistakes but you mustn't look at that listen it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have them but you see it's following his rules following what he said to do stumble and falling doesn't have one thing to do with it a real true servant if he will stumble he will get up again hello if he wobbles god pulls him right back in the path as long as he's in the path of duty but if he's off the path of duty god's not even obligated to him but as long as he's in the path of duty god's obligated to him knowing that he's just a man or a woman he's obligated to that person as long as they're in the path of duty i love that so what would it mean it would have to mean this is this war this struggle that takes place even after you're born of the spirit of god let me just cut to the chase here friends because it's what's in my notes and what i'm preaching on it is it is essential it is absolutely essential to the believer that you are being changed not that you are changed not that you were changed but that you're continually changing change is so important to the christian and i know we don't people don't like change but god uses everything he changes things by seasons you have high times and low times you have good times and bad times you have times of mountain and times of valley you have times of victory and times of defeat and let me just say this way god has designed your life that way his design growth only comes through winter spring and summer it's got to go through death before life can come again so you you're always it's important that we're that we realize we understand the makeup of how we're made because if we understand ourselves we'll live in victory a lot more than we live in defeat amen amen because if satan can do anything if he'll come if he has victory over you he'll take a person who's born of the spirit of god has the baptism of the holy ghost and beat them up and bomb them with their mistakes and their faults and their failures and their shortcomings to a place to where they're defeated they have no faith they have no what they feel they have no authority to speak to the devil they have no authority to speak to their problems if he can back you up into a corner that's why brother branham says he has no weapon of his own except getting you to doubt your weapon and if satan could be accomplished any if satan can accomplish anything he'll beat the family of god up so much that they have no confidence to speak in jesus name [Music] but let me just tell you god doesn't look at your mistakes god doesn't look at your failures god doesn't even look at them that's what brother branham says he says god doesn't even see them he looks at your heart and he judges what's inside of you now we still believe in the baptism of the holy ghost we believe it in this church let me just stop here for a minute and say we still believe in altar calls we do we believe that in this church you say well where was that in the words that altar call in the bible well where's where's it where's a lot of the things that we that that you do here today you're not going to find an exact scripture in a verse an exact place where the new testament church they didn't have a sound system but we have a sound system they didn't have screens and technology but we used technology they didn't have the internet but we so the gospel through the internet what is an altar it's a place for you to does it does it save you no does baptism no it's not about an altar call that you come up to an altar and and you and you and you and then be by transferring because you went to the altar you're going to be born of the spirit of god no more than baptism but what what is what what what does it do then brother matt it's a public confession or something that you're doing publicly which the bible does teach if you confess me on earth i'll confess you before my father in heaven we still believe in the altar i don't believe we see it enough in our churches let me just preach by the inspiration of the holy spirit we don't see it enough anymore in our churches just speaking to my grandma here just yesterday yesterday or maybe the day before about this and we were just reminiscing about even brother caleb when and when brother caleb gave his heart to the lord and my grandma was reminiscing she said he was squalling and bawling like a baby but you know what god did something for him at the altar we don't see enough of that our young people don't come to altars anymore except for camp meetings except for young people except for youth camps it should be you know why they don't you do you wear them at well why aren't young people our old people are coming to the altar anymore so what are kids going to do they're going to follow with the example of parents and adults say brother matt why are you preaching on that because the lord told me to so i'm just going to we believe in the altar we should never get rid of the altar we believe in a place where you can make a confession where you can come up here and surrender your life whether it's for repentance or a renewing or restoration or bodily healing that you need in your body or your spirit or your mind we believe in shouting we believe in speaking in tongues it's what we believe in in this church we believe in those things we believe in dancing in the spirit we believe in healing of the body through the through the prayer of faith because the bible says the prayer of faith shall save shall heal the sick amen we believe in the laying on of hands because the bible tells us in the book of james what is james speaking of something you say brother he said anoint them with oil does the oil have anything is there any this is this is uh classic olive oil is this oil because it's sitting in this pulpit and because it's sitting in this church and because our pastor touched it does that somehow make it divine and if i could just take this and dump it a better knot my lid might not be tight if i could just dump it on myself that there's any kind of transferences there is in and of itself is there any value uh no but when you have when there's faith mixed with something physical why did jesus pick up mud and dirt and he spit into the dirt and he rubbed it together and then he rubbed it in the man's eyes and the eye the blinded eyes became open what was he what was jesus portraying that god cares about your physical condition and god could use something very natural and very physical if you'll have faith he'll honor that faith and virtue comes through it amen that's why we believe in anointing oil because the bible tells us to do that was there any is there significance in the oil it's representative of the oil of the holy spirit that's why baptism does it save it is there any value in the water if it's hot or if it's cold if it's clean if there's bleach or whatever it is there's no value in it but it's you doing something physically naturally and god honors that physical action he backs it up by his word that's why we believe in it why why why why do we believe we believe in the baptism of the holy spirit we believe in visions we believe in divine dreams we believe in prophecy and the fulfillment of prophecy that's what we believe you want a statement of faith there it is part of it why do we believe in these things brother matt because they're because there's a faith that's been restored to a church and we defend that faith hallelujah brother branham says here he says now he says he says that we don't let me just get back to my thought here for a moment so there's a part of that that that is always with you there's something inside even in your nature there's a war there's a struggle there's a battle always taking place and you've always got to be being changed there's something the lord does in our life and it's amazing because you have all these you have in this with the world the the world that we live in today and i perhaps it's maybe it's been that way for much longer than i've been alive but there's we see it i see it more than ever before you have counseling and there's books on counseling and christian counts and i believe in counseling counseling is very important it's a part large part of of what we what what we're doing even when we're ministering sometimes the words counseling to needs we believe in counsel but it's been there's all kinds of psychologists and you've got to go see a psychologist for this and for this mental condition you could only see this kind of a doctor and then he diagnoses that and then he writes you a prescription and gives you some kind of drugs and for some people outside of god delivering them that's what they need because god uses medicine we believe that hello we do believe in that and but but it's it's it's amazing because there's all kinds of councils and counselors and books on relationships and all kinds of manuals on how to do it right and how to raise children writing and how how to live it how to how to be successful and there's books on counseling on marriage and there's advice on just about any subject from marriage to physical exercise physical problems physical diseases uh child raising finances business all kinds of of of of counseling available and all kinds of experts who have degrees and are they're professionals and what they do yet yet we live in a world that is more divorced and more broken homes and more broken lives and depression and anxiety and and even in churches today divorce is a common thing married two three four times he said brother matty against preaching against christian counsel no no by by no means am i preaching against that but you say brother matt then what is the problem if there's so much counsel and there's so much help why aren't we being helped because no one's taking the counsel why does lives why would a lot why does christian lives not change when a life doesn't change it's because you're not taking the council right now how are you changed because you take the the council and when you take the counseling from the word of god your life can change tragically we spend so much time and we spend so much time praying for god to change our circumstances praying for god to change your business or your boss or to your wife and change my husband change my church if you'll change my pastor you'll change this lord if you'll change this about me when no one's no one's looking inwardly and saying maybe it's not what needs to be changed around me but maybe something needs to be changed inside of me being changed is when you can look down and say like david change my heart oh god don't just change change my circumstances but change me lord change the situation that's good god can do that sometimes but how many times does god before he can change that situation he's got to get you to change first change my sibling change my friend change this problem change this change this situation you see god the bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord so that means anything that happens whether it's a crisis in your life or some great difficulty god has orchestrated those parts of your life and there to bring change sometimes they're negative sometimes they're hard sometimes they're difficult but it's through difficulty that change can come sometimes it's very hard sometimes it's very difficult sometimes it's unfaceable and you can't even face it and you don't want to think about it but god's using that in that that circumstance that's so great to you and it's and he's trying to do a work down on the inside of you something that can change the inside of the inside something that can dig deep enough let me just look into some of these issues and some of these things that even that we're born with and we go through life even after we're born again of the of the spirit of god and we've came we've came to the baptism of the holy ghost but how many things do we bring over into our new creation life our new creation life because that's what the bible says you are when you're in christ you're a new creation old things are passed away behold come on somebody bible reader help me out here behold all things have became new that means you don't carry over your temper from the old creation to the new creation that means you don't carry over your bitterness that you had in your heart against what happened to you into the new creation or at least you shouldn't god should be able to change that but how many times have we carried things over and we live and we're fine and everything's kosher and we we pet it we don't want anybody to preach against it we don't want to have to touch it we don't want to have to confront it but you see god will take what god will do if you're son of god if you're a daughter of god god will change you if you want change yourself because the holy spirit will lead and guide you into all truth the holy ghost is constantly working on your character he's constantly working on your personality you say my personality absolutely the holy ghost is trying to change your personality oh but that's who i am that's that's my identity uh no friends my personality should be the person of jesus christ and so every day we live our personality should cha you say i don't want to change my personality i don't want to change who i am god does the holy spirit does when you're you realize when you look in the mirror and you see your reflection whether you like that or reflection or you don't like that reflection whether you like what you see you don't like what you see let me tell you something that's not you that's not who you are that's not who you are sometimes we become so chained to our our identity whether it's our roots the country we're from the family we were born in the family we were raised in the church that we go through we we we we we we get so how can i say it we get so prideful of us we don't even realize as a son or daughter of god the real you lives deep beyond that flesh that you see on the outside when the when when the worms have destroyed this flesh and the the skin worms has destroyed my skin and my hair falls out and my body begins to decay the real me is still living right so this isn't even me you're not even seeing the real me i've never seen the real me but one day the bible says we'll see him and it says when when when he doth appear we'll be in his very image so who are we holding on to and so you see your makeup even the things that you the things that you have in your life i want to go through this because we got a lot of quotes if you put up that first powerpoint i want you just to to follow along it's a lot to read but i believe it's important brother branham says here and let me just turn this clicker on and make sure i have control of that he says in zacchaeus the businessman if you went into a doctor's office and told him you were sick told him your symptoms and he was in a hurry he would probably give you a little prescription some anesthetic in it some sort of aspirin the doctor's merely trying to get rid of you just at that time because he hasn't time a real good doctor before he gives the medicine would diagnose the case thoroughly till he found out what was wrong then give you the medicine sometimes we find people going through these prayer lines out across the nations and they just run up and think that the lord ought to kill them right then but there's something maybe down in there and we set before the lord until he reveals that what that is there's something there's a reason for everything there's a reason for everything maybe prayers even something that you've prayed over why hasn't the lord answered that there's a reason for everything well i'm born of the spirit of god i've got the holy ghost but bitterness and unforgiveness and the lord can't even hear your prayer that you're praying amen if you hold on you hold on you say well brother matt what are we talking about very very practical very simple little things but there's a reason for everything you you have a temper and you you you've you've you've guarded you've you've met you've justified you've justified that temper you've justified that attitude problem that's not according to the scripture and you we we call ourselves christians well we we might be we call ourselves born of the spirit of god well you might be but hold on to that temper and the attitude and never let god correct that and it makes sense why certain things don't happen and come to pass in your life he says there's a reason for everything and you've got to find the reason first that's why it's so important that you never settle or you never get content with how your christian life as it stands right now brother you may have came through some amazing circumstances god may have brought you from the uttermost maybe even the gutter most and you might sit here tonight and you're thankful for how god's fire god has brought you but don't ever get content let me say it this way until you've got a new body and you're you've got a brand new body and your body's changed don't ever get content and don't ever stop saying let me be changed lord let me die to myself let me die to my mind what my thinking is i've got to constantly be being changed and i don't want to make excuses for any thing in my life he says then you can find what to work on i found someone not programming excuse me on the interviews this morning a person i guess they're still here in this building about speaking with tongues the person genuine person real person lived right they've heard me say the evidence of the holy ghost wasn't speaking in tongues and it isn't but i advise that person to ask god to let them either speak in tongues or prophesy hold on a minute brother branham now you just preached that speaking in tongues is not the evidence of the holy ghost but you've prayed for this person and actually advised that person to ask god to let them speak in tongues or prophesy why because it's the nature so this person who came to brother branham had was questioning whether they were born of the spirit of god and brother branham knew that they were born of the spirit of god but he knew that in their nature for whatever reason when we say in their nature it could be their upraising it could be the country they're from it could be what their pastor has preached it could have been the church that they were in maybe what their mom told them the kind of environment that they were and maybe everybody in their church was shouting and jumping and doing jericho marches and speaking in tongues and now this person is constantly living with a fear and a bad well i never did that and maybe and you think well brother madam wouldn't you just say whoa well my goodness sister tongues is no evidence of the holy ghost you just need to let that go you just need to cast that down brother branham knows that even though the sister is born again there's something in her nature that won't never settle until she speaks in tongues isn't it amazing that the prophet of god didn't just cut her off and and even if though that you don't need to look for that you should not about to be looking for signs but he says actually it's in her nature so i'm going to i tell you and advise you ask the lord that the lord will let you prophesy or speak in tongues you know what i did that i prayed i prayed that same prayer i prayed that same prayer and the lord years later wasn't right away wasn't instantly was completely unbeknownst to me in a prayer closet coming back from a missions trip and i spoke in tongues for two and a half hours spoke in tongues many times after that you say brother matt do you believe in tongues i do because it's biblical brother branham says i would that my entire church spoke in tongues now does that mean that if you don't speak in tongues oh there's something wrong no absolutely absolutely it's not the pray more than tongues but for an interpretation of those tongues a prophecy of those tongues is paul said if the unlearned come in and that they just hear an unknown tongue what does it edify except the person who's speaking and he says but if an interpretation comes forth then the unlearned would say god must be with them right i say that just you say brother matt why did you even say that i just mentioned that because because god knows your makeup and he knows what kind of person that you are even brother and when he speaks about the book of james lay your hands upon the sick and the brother says well brother adam isn't real gentile faith just to say speak the word like the roman centurion he says absolutely it is he says but god will meet you at whatever level of faith that you give him god will condemn sin he'll come down if that's what your faith needs he's not going to sit up there with his hands crossed amen he says because it's the nature the first thing he says uh i went to the person and found their birthplace and what sign they were born under and could tell what their birth was i went to their birthplace i went to their birthplace you mean but where you're born could have an effect on you after you're born of the spirit yes and sometimes those things of where we're born we need to let go of that's why we preach here all the time you're not a south carolinian you're not an american you're not a minnesotan you're not from idaho you're not from tennessee you're from a colony in heaven a civilization from a kingdom and so after abort after you're born again you've got to let go of your past you've got to let go of where the way that you were made up if it doesn't line up with the word of god and brother adam says the first thing i went to the person this is the person asking to speak in tongues do i have the holy ghost he says i advise you to pray that you speak in tongues he says the first thing i went to the person found the birthplace what sign they were born under and could tell what their birth was which way it's set in their natural nature sets them in a certain line he says then when they're born again they're over here in another nature amen right but brother matt does that mean that that old nature there in another nature and now that old nature is just that was a day of yesterday no that sticky carnal nature will be with you till you die and he says then when they're born again they're over here and then when you find into his nature that's the inside conscience inside conscience it's been one of the most amazing things that i have noticed along the lines of my ministry for our lord jesus is the peculiarity of people and the study of human life is one of the greatest things that a person can study to watch the nature of people you go to different parts listen to this he says you go to different parts of the nation and worlds to where you go you'll notice that there's a difference there's a different attitude that people take towards christ towards his service towards his servants towards worship and one of the things has been that one type of meeting will be just wonderful in one part of the country or it won't work in the other part of the country [Music] because people by nature now remember that's not their new nature and most so many times message believers will go well i'm just not from the south and i'm from up north and we're a little bit more cold and chilly and we don't we you know we're like the bereans and who are more noble than the thessalonicans because listen friends you're not a berean you're not a thessalonican you're not a no you're not from ohio you're not from the north you're not from the south that might have been your birth nature but when you come into christ all things are made new and now you're from the land of promise the land of the holy ghost and you say lord change me not into how they do it in the south not how they do it in the north change me of how they do it in the word of god let my life be a mirror image of that lord is that what we want oh is that what we want church to say we want a body a church we're not we're not denomination we're not this name we're not that name we're we follow another ordinance we have another order we have another law that we live by and he says he says here now listen he goes further and i'm going to run out of time let me just go through this 20th century prophet listen to him talking to his sister excuse me sister i have to rally i've relaxed my mind once in a while now we'll be strangers i see that you're strictly a stranger to me you're from away from here come from another city you've got a lot of trouble in your heart you've got heart trouble to begin with is that right whole lot of blackness i see a black sheep keep following you and brother man says oh it's a lie somebody's total eye on you now she's having heart trouble and now brother branham goes into her not her body he doesn't diagnose her heart that a doctor with a heart cath could do that they could go in there and look at the natural heart but brother adam goes further than that and says that the the reason you're having an outside natural reaction your nervousness your high blood pressure your your heart problem it's actually not anything to do with the body but the body's just responding to an issue that you have in your spirit that's why brother madam says there's a reason for everything and so he starts to go down her look into her life and say oh it's a lie somebody's told a lie on you that was a man that was professing divine healing he said you was a witch yes you could hear the woman in 20 century prophet she begins to weep is that true and you've got a whole story in your church something another about is that right you're pastor sick right now he's got polio is that right yes sir sister don't pay no attention to what them people tell you they're lying and the only thing wrong with your heart is that nervous condition got your heart worked up go home in peace and god bless you you're all right god bless you you're not a witch what did he do there was no kind of supernatural tongue spoken over her he simply diagnosed the problem in her natural flesh and when the enemy was exposed she was free because what brings freedom exposing the devil when you can expose him in your nature and in your life and say that's not me that's not who i am freedom comes to a believer all you got to do is expose the enemy listen he says you believe with all your heart believe god will heal you of that tb believe he will make you well if i'd ask him lord jesus i pray you'll heal the woman makes you get completely whole i ask the blessing in jesus christ's name amen go on your road rejoicing saying thank you lord and you will get well and then strangely listen he says he's you know this that was the end of that quote there that that last one listen to my brother man says and he care to you care do you he he cares do you care and then strangely sorry for the words just if you can't see them too well i have some of the other ones larger i think strangely i went to a place where i made an odd turn instead of turning around i went to make a turn the lights flashed on a lovely couple on the outside two fun two fine young ladies that i had just married two fine young ministers and satan after seeing the minister one of them his ministry being set and he took a life's companion right there this altar they went he's trying to be careful to not give away who that is he's just he's he's covering their identity but he's telling you about a problem that this brother had and he says that just married them this after they went away happily on their honeymoon and the enemy jumped on this young man and i'm saying this to express what i'm saying does he care somehow with faith that would not take no they turned and returned back here knowing after they was all the way over and way in the east here somewhere on their honeymoon returned back and i was sitting waiting and i walked in fine handsome young man his wife sitting on the outside crying her little companion of the man of the other brother come running which is a friend of this young man saying brother branham such and such has happened went there and seen this handsome young man sitting there just in the peak of his life leader young men sitting there and satan bound him he never noticed but i took my hand left to shake his hand right to see if some disease had plagued him but there was no sign of vibration coming right out of the room from praying and fasting and waiting on the lord the anointing of the holy spirit was there and that's why it led us see and then seeing the shadow of darkness over him i never said what i was doing but in less than a couple moments time it was all gone the coldness of his hands left he was shouted in praising god a few minutes to find himself and here they sit right here this morning sitting in the audience see how satan was trying to upset that young man by referring to him of some complex to be built back which the holy spirit knew and i seen it by the vision of the lord so what does brother branham say he says here's this man goes this honeymoon and then enemy jumps on him and you say well what happened well brother branham reveals it right there in the church service he says that old complex and it's something in his mind that he had long let go of tried to jump back on him something from his nature something from his mind and brother branham says god showed it by vision the holy spirit i've seen it by a vision of the lord but god cared for that i love that but god cared for that man god cared for that young boy he cared enough not to just let that man but what was it something in his nature was affecting him now a minister had already let go of that but the devil has a way of digging up your past the devil has a way and you've committed it to god and you might have prayed and committed it to god but you've constantly got to be washing your mind you've constantly got to be bringing every thought that is contrary to the word of god subject to the holy spirit that's why the bible says the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but they're spiritual to the tearing down of strongholds and it says take captive take every thought that's contrary to the word of god take it prisoner and he says god cared for that young boy just coming in a few moments ago a lady my house at 8 27. wow just coming in a few moments ago a lady sitting here in the aisle no just got her a seat and somebody sat down she said nine years brother random i've tried to get a hold of you she said i'm so desperate i hear late i couldn't even get a prayer call the lady moved back prayer card let me move back said brother branham just a word with you standing there a vision broke over this fine young fine looking young woman and see that her heart was burdened and she was trying to work to make a living and a great thing happened now brother madam can't give the details but he's given you enough to let you know it was something naturally that was affecting her spiritually and he says something had happened way back in the time listen way back in the time of her parents that it caused this great thing to happen to her and the lord jesus revealed it showed what it was and there in a moment's time took it from the woman she went around rejoicing and now sitting here in the audience with us now rejoicing with tears as she's wiping her eyes knowing the truth of the thing was made known and that poor little neurotic woman that was nervous she didn't know what to do with herself thinking she was gone and there was no holy spirit and this is her and this is her last day she had tried for nine years she was about to be at the end of despair god cared for that little woman which no one cares for see what a time he does care don't ever let the devil lie to you and tell you that that god doesn't care i was just talking to me and rachel talking the other day about the story brother brandon the the fish who the the the the lure had went so deep in in his in his belly and ripped the guts out and and there's the fish laying there on the top of the water floating for a half hour brother adam says there and he says there the holy spirit came to me voice spoke to me and said speak to that little fish give him back his life and brother man says here in my pocket he said stuffed in my pocket was the prayers i think it was little children with polio he said i had those prayer requests i had been holding needing to pray for he said of serious conditions if maybe it wasn't children it was someone with with a grace and multiple great sicknesses and he says yet the lord with all of these great needs wants me to speak to that little fish that little insignificant brim brother man says why did he do that just to show you he cares about the little things glory god cared for that little woman which no one cares for what a time he does care when he was here on earth i say he cared for the people so much until he healed their sick comforted their hearts told them about a place where he would go and prepare for them and would come again to receive them he cared for them and notice he cared so much until when he knowed he must leave in order to bring this to bring this great thing to us he said i'll not leave you comfortless i'll send the holy spirit and he shall continue my care for you until he until he returns there's no one cares like jesus and knowing that he sent back the holy spirit to continue to comfort his people does he care certainly he cares now he was to continue care for the people his people here on earth in the same manner that he cared for them when he was here brother brandon begins to relate and i'm just going to move through this quickly but i'm just going to relate some of this story here and then we'll skip some of it he begins to relate a dream and we've read this here before and preaching the entire message on it we're not going to go that direction but i just want to show you something prophet of god begins to tell of this dream and he says and he's speaking here he says one night the lord woke him up morning we're sitting there here and i looked it's brother roy and he says i looked there in jerusalem lords communion table i was talking his brother roy has a dream he couldn't understand it but lori's sitting present looking at me right now he saw it he called me up in houston or out in arizona sent me a letter and i called him back said you were sitting there brother brandon this is his dream you were sitting there brother branham and i saw that big pillar like come in and get you and take you away from the lord's table and you went westward because he was sitting on the east side watching me go west that's like coming and taking me out said it was one morning like it was a vision got up in the bed about three or four o'clock in the morning and something like that and saw this happen and he screamed looked like for days brother bill come back and roy and i have been real brothers we live together hunt together we're just brothers and he screamed for me till he was hoarse in his throat come back bring him back bring him back here come that pillar of fire coming back or a cloud come back and he set me at the head of the table notice and i had been changed i had been changed it was a mystery to brother roy me being changed to look different i lay this up here for something i want to remember and brother adam takes a note and he lays it there in front of the on the top of the pulpit big letters being changed and he says when i give him the interpretation of it that's funny if you don't read the rest of this you got to be wondering what's brother branham talking about he's been changed has he got his body change is he in a new body is a theophany body this must be some ethereal something's about he's going west there must be something about brother breaking up the seals and oh he's changed and maybe it's that white you know they you you could call it a a million different things notice what brother bannon begins to say that change was i'm going to skip two of these here he says i had been preaching for years and i've become an old man an old veteran preacher had a lot of hard battles maybe i'm scarred and cut up on the inside from fights because my law the lord gave me was not to not back to kiss the babies and men marry the young and to bury the old but it was to hold a two-handed sword at the battlefront against the wiles of paganism and demonology and all the powers of darkness and fight it with the word of god till i seen the enemy defeated and he says i've been cut many times so he begins to relate something in his nature this is something in his flesh this is something he's born of the spirit of god he's filled with the holy ghost he's preaching the gospel but he says something in my nature i've been cut many times let's skip through a lot of these we'll just skip through them just to save time get to the important context of it he says and these rickey's this is just through this he says and these rickeys and raketas that have so sassed the word called them ricky and raketa god give me to understand i shouldn't do that god gave me to understand i shouldn't do that now you got to be careful with what you take even listening to the tapes and listen and what brother branham's saying when he even relates as if you're not careful you'll take those tapes of brother branham saying a bunch of rickeys and raketas and then we think as message believers that ought to be our attitude oh these just bunch of heathen and bunch you ain't got the holy ghost and you ain't born again and you don't even have the spirit of god what ought our nature to be brother adam says the lord had showed me i shouldn't do that because that's many of them are still his children they can't help because they act so much different isn't it amazing that the lord cared about his attitude towards people and you don't think he cares about our attitude towards people how about we go further than just the people on the outside what about the people on the inside you don't think the lord cares how we treat each other oh he does he cares how not just the minister standing behind the pulpit how he treats i got a great responsibility here lord hold me accountable for my attitude that i have towards you because you're the purchase of his blood the bride of jesus christ but let me go further than that god cares how you treat each other he cares about your attitudes that you have one towards another let's just move a little bit further husband he cares about how you treat your wife he cares about your attitude towards your husband children young people he cares about how you treat your parents parents he cares about how you treat your children and the attitudes and how you look at them and how you view them and how you speak to them amen can we go on good i'm glad luther agreed we can go on berluther i heard an amen right over the internet thank you brother he says they can't help it because they act so much different some of these old cold formal churches has got them that spirit upon them they're in much in prison as israel was in prison just as much as moses went down to deliver them from slavery human beings that love jesus christ would serve him if they only knew what to serve him by and they're in bondage under denominationalism that tells them don't you do this and don't you do that but the call of god must come whoever wants to march towards the promised land let him march we're on our road to that promised land amen let them come march we're on our road to meet christ at the end time and i wanted to bring this to you so that you would see and show you that the mistake that a man can make being sincere moses lost the feeling of his people because they wouldn't listen brother roy you see your dream and now i can't go with a ministry like that until i feel different in my heart about it no matter if god did tell me but that is that change you mean it wasn't some ethereal thing and his body changed it's theophany it was all about the opening of the seals no it was about an attitude problem that he had towards unbelieving non-message believing people people who were in denominations who didn't believe him and if god cared his how much he would care about his attitude towards them how much more he'd care about how we treat our spouses and our children and our pastor and the deacons and the sound guys and how the sound guys treat the sound guys how the musicians treat each other how you treat each other how i look at you how i speak to you how i talk to you say brother man does that mean we could never make a mistake no we'll get upset we'll get we'll get mad at each other we're not we got a sticky nature i may rub you the wrong way you may rub me that wrong way but i say god changed me to where i can repent and i can humble myself and say brother will you forgive me sister will you forgive me i'm sorry i didn't mean to act that way i care about you the lord cares about you and he cares about how we treat each other [Music] this is the change brother roy had seen him brother branham something in his heart had changed he says that brother roy that's what something's got to change me because i in my heart if i go out there feeling the way i do now i still feel that they ought to have heard the message they ought to have done it and i don't have the feeling for people that i should have until i get that feeling there's no need of me going because i'd be a hypocrite you know that you until you get the feeling for that person who you or you may be concerned about their sin you may be upset by their condition you may be upset by what that what they're doing and your reputation and your image and how it makes you look and but listen until you can care for that person you ought not even say anything to them because you can't help them well hey man until we can have the right attitude how could we ever minister to someone who needs ministering you could be so right and you could be 100 percent right about how you're viewing the situation but if you you could be a hundred percent right but if you've got the wrong attitude you're 100 percent wrong i say that to me i say that to brother matt so you receive it too but i say it to me brother matt until your attitude is right how can you help someone until you can care like jesus cared amen i just want to make sure i get some all of this what was important yes he says and then it might have been he says it might be he says and then it might have been this that i've tried to think of it this afternoon that i had stood here with all my heart told you exactly the truth and tell you of my complex and make my open confession because and ask you to pray that my inside being i'm praying saying lord don't just change my outside but change my inside being how many could pray that how many could raise a hand and say lord change my inside being that would be changed towards people that i could do as the lord did let's stan we're gonna have to stop there musicians if you could return bower heads with me if you could we'll just bow our heads pray he cares i care lord lord i raise my hands here today every heart lord i bow mine with these people uplifted hands lord i just preached this message and didn't get to really where i felt like you wanted me to get to but you know you know what's best lord you know where i should stop just gonna stop right here i'm just gonna say lord with an uplifted hand and i'm gonna pray it by faith invite anybody that would be here want to pray it with me i just want to say lord would you change me change my personality change my way of thinking if it's not according to your word lord would you change that inside being inside of me the innermost part of my being lord you care about these little things in our life you showed us even your prophet said that little fish that his life had been taken was his life had been given back to to show you you care about the little things lord then if you care about those little bitty things in our life the lord forgive me for my attitudes i raise hand and say i repent lord repent of anything that i've said that be contrary to how you would have said it i repent for my temper if i've let my temper get the best of me i repent for the gossip i've spread and things i've said about people that i should not not have said let my tongue go and say something to tear somebody down lord you care about that i just raised my hands i'll humble myself and say lord jesus would you forgive me lord and would you change me that i think like you that i speak like you that i care like you oh i could just raise my hands and say give me a heart that cares like you care for people give me a heart lord that looks like where i could huh even if i no matter if i'm going to humble myself and lay down my pride i want to be changed lord i want to be changed one day you're going to change my body one day lord you're going to change me at the very atomic level this skin my hair my eyes every part about me my entire body my spirit everything i think one day lord there's gonna come a change that sweeps over my body and all of my problems are gone and all of my complexes are gone and all of my fears will vanish all of those things will change but now lord so that i can receive that change i've got to be willing to change now so i just surrender myself maybe someone would want to raise a hand and say lord i want to change then so help me to change now let me adjust
