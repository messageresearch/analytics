========================================

15 Joshua 24 14 15 24 Joshua 245 and 16 it says I'm sorry let's start at verse 14 now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord amen we're going to take a title this morning on sincerity and Truth sincerity and truth let's just bow our hearts Heavenly Father we thank you for this day thank you for the reading of your word Lord we pray that you break the bread of life to us this morning and father in this Lord simple Sunday school lesson Lord that You' come down father father most importantly that you'd come and minister to us through father your word father be with Pastor father as he's preparing we love you now we just commit our hearts to you father in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you take your seats this morning Amen to set the scene here for the chapter that we just read there in Joshua this was Joshua's last declaration to the people of Israel it was uh it was his last sermon if you will to his congregation he gathered all the tribes of Israel together he gathered the elders and the judges and the officers together to hear what God and and the people were were there to hear what God had to say one last time through this faithful servant Joshua and as we read his words began to describe all the things if you go back and you read the whole chapter actually you start at chapter 23 we don't have time to get into it but if you go read chapters 23 and 24 his words began to describe all the things that the Lord had done for them from the days of Abraham all the way to the Escape at Egypt to the Red Sea Deliverance to the batt Battle of Jericho and all the way down into the most previous victory that God had led them into and then after all that he made this remark he made these remarks fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth choose you this day whom you will serve and as a leader to say that you know whichever way you decide to go you know whether you decide to choose the the way of serving gods and Idols it doesn't matter as a leader he said as for me and for my house we are going to serve the Lord and that was a Leader's declaration Amen to say it doesn't matter what you do what I'm going to do is I'm going to serve the Lord and I want you to follow suit with me I want you to follow the word I'm saying amen and uh a few verses later it says he comes back and there's some back and forth between the Israelites and him and they kept saying you know we will we're going to serve the Lord we're we we we will and we're going to obey the words and so Joshua he made a covenant with them and it and set them a statute and an ordinance the Bible says so he put their their Covenant on this great Stone and it was to be a witness forever that Israel had made this oath to serve God and you know um back in verse 15 when when Joshua says in sincerity and truth I believe the Lord kind of was giving him some insight into what goes on into the hearts of his people you know sincerity is so important in our walk with Christ amen the Bible places a high value on it um and you know even so much to say that it came before truth we're going to get into that in just a second and we'll touch on it but it's important but the problem with sincerity alone is that it if it lacks its counterpart which is truth then it's dangerous amen some some of the most sincere people in the world have been deceived and led down a wrong path because truth wasn't involved in what they were sincere about amen you can go you can go read you know stories of even in this latest Century of of men who had gifts of leadership amen they had a gift of leadership but they LED these people down a path that was destructive amen and they the people that W went into their you know Clans and into their things they were sincere people but it lacked the truth and we're going to get into this in just a minute it didn't lack the whole truth amen it lacked it had 99% of the truth amen a lot of times 99.9% of what the serpent said to Eve was true there was just a sliver of falsehood you know and and it seems sometimes it can seem harmless you know but in that case and in our case it's between life and death um you know you think about Cain and Abel there in the Book of Genesis brother bham says this many times Cain was sincere in his heart amen when he provided the sacrifice on the altar he was completely sincere in what he was doing but that didn't make it right amen you know because if you go and read that Genesis chapter 4 uh Abel was a shepherd and Cain was a tiller of the ground and of the of the the the um you know Farm amen thank you and so what he was doing he was sincere in his heart and I want you to think about this for a moment his sincerity just as Sin was just as sincere as Abel was led his sincerity led to the first murder in the history of the world it led to provoke emotions called jealousy and rage things that previously weren't even known in the world because a man was trying to do a service to God without a revelation amen and imagine this it led to the first time in all of history that a mother had to grieve over her dead child and it led to the first time that a father had to grieve and to comfort his wife after blood was shed because of what because of a sincere heart amen so you got to be careful when in your in your service to God sincerity is important but it's got to have its counterpart truth amen it's so important you know and if you think about it what Satan does now in our modern society is exactly what he did back there in the Garden of Eden it's it's exactly what he did with Cain it may not look exactly the same you know culture changes things change his tactics don't change though they just become a little bit more crafty in the way that he does things amen it may not look the same as it did back there he attracts a modern Church world with the lure of sincerity amen a sincerity without the truth and the very same thing it was the very same thing that that it did in the times and and in the Book of Genesis it's exactly what he's doing in the church world the modern Church world today it it leads people to a form of Jesus and it's going to lead people to a form of Jesus a form that you can read in the Bible amen everybody has the ability to read the Bible it's a book everybody can read the book and see what the word say but it lacks the ability to have a true relationship with Jesus called Christ amen it lacks the ability to have a truth behind whatever sincere thing is in their heart and and you see that same that same Spirit just like Kane you know they'll have you know they'll have million dollar altars and buildings but you know but the most that they do in those places of worship is maybe repeat a prayer that doesn't go any higher than the ceiling amen it's the same thing that Cain did he had a beautiful altar with the nicest fruits and the nicest grains and you know wow it it was way more appealing than Abel's altar it it's way it seems almost more appealing to the to the Natural Eye you know and if you look at the sacrifice of Cain you know Abel's altar had had blood sacrificed on it blood splattered on it it took the life of something that was close to him you know he was a he was a shepherd and and his sheep meant something to him a true Shepherd their sheep means something to them amen so for in order for this to have taken place it meant that it was close to Abel's heart amen it meant that this sacrifice wasn't just you know taking something that he had you know laying in his house this this was something that was close to his heart and his soul amen and he had it because he had that Revelation amen his relationship with God meant more than the relationship that he had to those sheep although that was kind of everything to him God meant more and still in this day it's it's exactly what what God's what God requires it it requires life it requires the blood atoning in our life to cleanse us continually amen he's shed the blood thank the Lord he shed his blood so that he would be a constant continual atone atonement for our sins amen but it's got to come that way God's provided way can't come any other way and and you can't say that those people aren't sincere Amen in the church world I mean they these people the people that are in denominations and systems that believe with all their heart they know they believe some some of them may believe in in lighting a candle or burning an incense or repeating a prayer amen and and and that's what they believe that it takes to worship God and you know I you you meet them and they're the most some of the most sincere individuals that you ever meet I mean they're more sincere than than me sometimes amen they're more sincere than you sometimes if you're really honest amen they they could put us to shame and they truly think that they're worshiping God but it but it's contrary to what the Bible says is worship amen we are to worship Him in spirit and in truth amen and Jesus saith I am the way I am the truth the life no man cometh to me except unto the cometh unto the father but by me sometimes from you know the outside looking in it may look more appealing to go the way of Cain's sacrifice the way the natural the natural side of things it looks you know look at the appeal of Cain's sacrifice it looked amazing there was no mess there was no blood there was no death and and you know the anybody can look at that and say well that's a lot that's a lot fancier than this that's a lot nicer looking that's a lot more appealing but you've got to look past the surface of things because past the surface is where God is going to get into the life of Abel and although he was the first man to be murdered he was pleasing to God Amen Abel's offering like I said just it required something that was that was uncomfortable it required that death and spiritually it requires the same thing today it requires us to go further than some nice flowers or some repeating a prayer or going to church and those things are important I don't want to discredit those things and I don't want to discredit the people that do those things I don't think there's anything wrong with those things amen but it's not enough amen repeating something from the scripture isn't enough if it's not life to you if this word is just words if it's just something that you read in the morning and it doesn't become life a living reality to you then it's not enough amen it's got to be a reality brother Benham says in wisdom versus Faith 1962 he says just like the this Easter will be they'll spend millions of dollars Across the Nation to put some flowers on some altars altars wasn't made for flowers it's for sacrifice see it's just the same old Spirit of Cain that same see the same old old devil from Eden see what what happened Cain thought surely you know this man was sincere because it meant life or death to him and them people don't think they're Hypocrites amen don't think that those people are hypocritical in what they're doing they're sincere you say then they could be sincere and wrong sure a man can take arsenic sincerely thinking he's taking castor oil or something something else see sincere that don't do it it's truth not sincerity truth them women over there in Africa sacrificed their little babies to God the alligators are you that sincere no how many of them stand the Chinese and break their bones to Kitchen gods and how many of the M mahian uh mohammedans and up in there and the firew Walkers and put them things in there and hooks in their flesh hooks in their mouth sew their mouth up some of them put a stick and brother vam this isn't just here say brother bham went and he saw these things amen he witnessed this stuff and he got a he said I got a statue up there little figurine weigh sacrifices to God to think he'd go to heaven a priest puts a stick in his mouth wraps it around his head with a with a chain comes down puts his head behind him chains his feet he can't eat or drink or eat spit nothing till he dies you don't see you you won't see Christians making a sacrifice like that you won't even believe the truth the word see now Beauty he said surely God will receive I'm going to catch this in just a second now Beauty he said surely God will receive look how pretty my altar is see that same Spirit today of wisdom well if we build this denomination surely God will receive us he won't receive nothing but the word amen he won't receive nothing but the word and something he catches there is that it's it's subtle there at the end he says surely God will receive is that Pride can follow this attitude surely God will receive this sure look how pretty my altar is you know a sincere heart without the truth backing it up remember what we saw in Cain it it it breeds the wrong thing amen sure it looks nice from the outside but Proverbs 14 says just talk about Pride for a second there um there is a way that seeth right into a man but the end thereof are the ways of death and that bread hatred and anger and jealousy amen a sincere heart bred those things amen and out of those came what murder off from what the heart of a sincere and a beautiful sacrifice you know humility is uh humility is a necessity when you're approaching God there a couple scriptures here first Peter 56 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time James 4 chap uh 4:6 God resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble James 4:10 says humble yourselves in the sight of God and the Lord shall lift you up it can't be look at my sacrifice look at what I did for the Lord look at what I can do for the Lord look at our fine churches God resists that kind of attitude amen you know in my opening statement I had made a comment I wanted to touch on the the importance of true sincerity for a moment the prophet makes this statement and it's really important to look at both sides of the fence on this because I have the full quote if if you want it just let me know and I'll send it to you but this comes from the message getting in the spirit 1961 the prophet's talking about man-made systems and organizations and he says that's what we've tried to do for 2,000 years and Pentecostal people you're doing the same thing trying to pick him up by organization you'll never do it separate ating yourself from the other brothers you've got to come back and we got to be one I don't care if the man's wrong if he's wrong and sincere in your in his heart and you're right and your belief and wrong in the way that you're acting I'd rather be in his place than in yours that's right I'd rather be wrong in my Doctrine and right in my heart God will respect it more so if a man is wrong what of it help him he needs help love him if you can't love your enemy the same way as you love those who love you then you're no better off than the publicans that's right that's what the church failed to see I hope you get it tonight so God will brother ROM says God will respect it more the prophet said because he's got the right motive and he's got the right attitude the right Spirit behind it so if you're a little mixed up in your Doctrine that's okay now it's not okay to stay that way amen God leads you into all truth the spirit of truth will lead you into to all truth amen but it's okay because you've got the right Spirit and the right attitude behind it amen and God respects that more because he knows that you're malleable he knows that you if you the moment you hear it oh thank the Lord Lord thank you for correcting me amen but if you've got the other side of things if you've got the right Doctrine but the wrong attitude and the wrong spirit amen look at what that thing breathes it's not that it will be impossible With God all things are possible amen and I'm thankful for that but if there's Pride involved Pride goeth Before Destruction God resisteth the proud he gives grace to the humble and it's so it it's so vital to check our attitude to check our spirit to check your motive and your objective in doing things you could have the scriptures lined up you could have every quote lined up you could say bless God I've got this thing and you have the wrong attitude and it's wrong it's you have the wrong attitude about it amen but if you approach it with the right attitude amen then God can take that thing amen he can take whatever maybe wrong Doctrine or maybe whatever whatever you're doing maybe sincerely but you're doing wrong he can correct that amen glory to God and and and just to take a little turn this morning just got a few minutes here when it comes to to serving the lord and I said this it it's important to be malleable it's important to let God correct you and and let God provide Clarity in your life because what happens as men and as women as humans is that we can some sometimes we can get something in our hearts that we want to do and maybe it's a service maybe it's a service for the Lord maybe it's something we felt led to do or we felt led to say to someone and then we act upon it but sometimes just because we had an inclination to do something or to say a certain thing that doesn't necessarily mean that it was the that was what the Lord was looking for that's why it's critical at every juncture in your life every decision that we look at the word amen we look at what the word says about it first because human tendency is that if we do something that we think is right we'll convince ourselves to keep keep doing it but the more you do it that doesn't make it more right amen the more you do something wrong it doesn't make it more right you need to correct that thing and then God will make it right in your life amen I hope that's clear this morning the more you do it the more it doesn't it just produces the wrong thing and the more that you do it it can produce the wrong thing and then eventually you have got this Forest of things that you don't even know where it started well it started with a sincere heart maybe but it wasn't right with the word and and you know maybe just some natural examples you know if if you learned how to do something a certain way and you know you were taught how to do it the wrong way that can happen sometimes and now you've been doing it a long time it's still the wrong way to do it amen people can get comfortable in that you know especially religion you know they'll come comfortable in the way they worship God and comfortable in their Church attendance and comfortable in every aspect of their Christian walk I don't want to go down a list just comfortable in it and and Joshua knew that concept well he knew how important it was to check with God at every Crossroad because because why because he learned the hard way amen you remember aen and you remember the wedge that had gotten in the camp you remember the sin amen but he kept on going with God you know he said you're going to conquer every foe you're going to conquer every enemy so he sent out a few hundred men to go and fight this battle but there was sin in his Camp amen and he lost men wives lost husbands he lost brothers because he didn't check with God before a juncture a critical juncture in his life and he learned the hard way sometimes we have to learn the hard way sin had gotten in his Camp so when Joshua came to preach his last sermon he make sure to note to the Israelites he makees sure to note to this next Generation he says put away the strange Gods which are among you and and incline your heart unto the god of Israel you know he he recognized you know maybe the gods and the idols had made their way into the their Dwelling Places and into their heart and he said put those things away serve only Jehova and serve him with sincerity in your hearts and truth you know and as as people of God I believe it should be you know I believe it should be our heart's desire to follow the whole counsel of God I I want to have a sincere heart when I serve him I want to be I want to be more sincere you know brother Bram had that had that time you know the angel said you need to be more sincere I want to be more sincere amen but I don't want it to stop there I want the truth and I don't just want some portion of the truth that's going to take me 99% of the way I don't want a sincere walk with walk with the Lord that's going to be the wrong sacrifice amen I want to come God's provided way and I want the truth Amen to change my life because you can be sincere in your heart saints of God but you can be wrong in you can be wrong in the scripture and it takes the whole thing out of cater you watch that with Cain we watch that in that example it's so important to have a duality of both of those things amen because the truth is what sets us free glory to God and and and if you're wrong in something just remember God God is able I mean we're all wrong wrong in something we all we all got our we're all humans we all think we're right in what we do but God God is the one that's right in what he does amen and you just have to have the right attitude you know there was that example just this is the last last thing here there was that example of of a man by the name of Apollos Apollos in the book of Acts and the Bible said that he was instructed in the way of the Lord he was fervent in spirit and he spoke accurately the things of the Lord those are the things that that the Bible says about him but he was only teaching what he knew and that was the baptism of of John amen so when two individuals that did have the baptism of the Holy Ghost repentance unto baptism through Jesus Christ heard that he was preaching these things aquill and Priscilla they took him aside they explained the things of of God the Bible says more accurately amen and what did he do he heed to what they said and it was he became a great uh help in the word working of the Lord he because he heeded to what he said sometimes it's just it was just a detail it was just a small deta an important detail amen it was important detail but it was a detail in his life that God had to correct he did and they took him away I love the way that they put it they took him away privately spoke him spoke to him the things of the Lord accurately and he accepted it amen no matter what the case and that God is able amen aren't you glad for that let's just bow our hearts this morning Heavenly Father we thank thank you for the the word Lord we thank you for your presence this morning we pray father for the worship Lord we pray that we can enter in Lord today in spirit and in truth we commit our hearts to you now in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you
