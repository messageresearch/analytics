[0:10] stand and have a word of prayer.
[0:16] Gracious Father, Lord, we come before
[0:18] you this morning, inviting you into our
[0:20] Sunday school service. That Lord, that
[0:23] you could your spirit could move even
[0:25] here. That Lord, that I would come to
[0:28] you with an open heart. That Lord,
[0:30] something that might be said could
[0:33] perhaps touch the heart of someone who
[0:35] would hear it. We could have
[0:37] instruction, understanding of your word.
[0:40] Father with which to some ammunition,
[0:43] Father, with which to fight the spirits
[0:45] of these this age. We ask these things
[0:48] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[0:49] Amen.
[0:51] Want to um going to if the Lord Lord
[0:56] willing um kind of continue my thought
[0:58] from last week um title being why are we
[1:01] here? And I I want to take for a a part
[1:03] two sort of a subtitle today, the
[1:06] three-fold purpose of God.
[1:09] Um, I'm going to try to go a little kind
[1:11] of slow. There's old military saying,
[1:13] slow is smooth and smooth is fast,
[1:15] right? So, I'm going to kind of slow
[1:16] down, take my time, and try to go
[1:17] through it a little kind of smoothly,
[1:20] and hopefully we can go get through it
[1:21] quickly. It is a large topic, and I
[1:24] probably won't be able to get it all
[1:25] done today. But, um, for a t uh a text,
[1:28] I I want to read two places. Um, well,
[1:30] we'll we'll read one scripture briefly,
[1:32] and then you y'all can sit down. So,
[1:34] we're going to read Genesis chapter 3
[1:35] and verse 4.
[1:37] Um, and uh, for the sake of time, I'll
[1:40] just read it. If they put it up on the
[1:41] screen, you can read it there. Or if you
[1:42] fast, you can turn to it. Um, Genesis 3
[1:46] and verse4.
[1:47] And the serpent said unto the woman,
[1:49] "You shall not surely die. For God doth
[1:52] know that in a day you eat thereof, then
[1:54] your eyes shall be opened, and you shall
[1:56] be as gods, knowing good and evil." And
[1:59] when the woman saw that that the tree
[2:00] was good for food, and that it was
[2:02] pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be
[2:05] desired to make one wise, she took of
[2:07] the fruit thereof to eat, and gave also
[2:08] to her husband with her, and he did eat.
[2:11] Y'all can be seated.
[2:13] Um,
[2:19] I also want to read Revelations 21.
[2:24] Um, and we'll start at verse one. And it
[2:26] says Revelations 21 and verse one, "And
[2:30] I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for
[2:31] the first heaven and the first earth
[2:33] were passed away, and there was no more
[2:35] sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, New
[2:38] Jerusalem, coming down from God out of
[2:41] heaven, prepared as a bride, adorned for
[2:44] her husband." And we skip down to verse
[2:46] 9. And there came unto me one of the
[2:50] seven angels, which had the seven vials
[2:52] full of the seven last plagues, and
[2:54] talked with me, saying, Come hither, I
[2:56] will show thee the bride, the lamb's
[2:59] wife. And he carried me away in the
[3:02] spirit to a great and high mountain, and
[3:04] showed me that great city, the holy
[3:06] Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from
[3:11] God.
[3:12] Now, I I read these two scriptures
[3:15] because
[3:16] I want to illustrate something um sort
[3:19] of a a key point, right? And it's kind
[3:22] of right there in the subtitle. Um that
[3:26] there's a purpose to the Bible. There's
[3:27] a purpose to God's plan. Everything that
[3:29] is and has been created has a point.
[3:32] There's a a plan for it in place.
[3:36] And the Bible is, you know, written by
[3:40] the greatest storyteller that ever was.
[3:42] And every storyteller, every good story
[3:46] begins with a conflict, right? It begins
[3:49] with a a crisis. It begins with a
[3:51] problem that needs to be solved.
[3:54] And then the story is about how we go
[3:57] about what trials and tribulations we go
[3:59] through and what the the process was to
[4:03] resolve that. And then the conclusion of
[4:05] the story, the final act of the story is
[4:08] the protagonist returning back to where
[4:11] they started with the solution to the
[4:13] problem, right? That we return that the
[4:16] the the way a good story ends is when
[4:19] we're back where we started with the
[4:21] problem solved that made us leave in the
[4:23] first place.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; And that's ex So I'm showing you in the
[4:28] beginning. This is, you know, Genesis
[4:30] chapter 3 kind of right there in the
[4:33] beginning of
[4:36] here's the crisis, right? Here's the
[4:38] crisis. Adam and Eve, man falls
[4:42] and it the the method by which they fall
[4:46] is that Satan came in and disrupted the
[4:50] family.
[4:51] &gt;&gt; He broke the the structure, the unity of
[4:54] God's family. And it ends the conclusion
[4:57] of the story, the final act is the the
[5:02] God's people returned back to where they
[5:05] started
[5:06] &gt;&gt; with the initial conflict, the the sin
[5:09] resolved,
[5:10] &gt;&gt; right? We have a resolution. And so, but
[5:12] ultimately the the beginning state and
[5:14] the ending state is God's family in
[5:17] unity back in an Eden condition as a
[5:20] family under
[5:22] &gt;&gt; in God's house.
[5:26] Um and I want to read
[5:28] um
[5:30] this is from oneness in 1962 February
[5:33] 11th.
[5:35] Now the first man and first woman in the
[5:36] garden of Eden was in perfect harmony
[5:38] with God so much that God could come
[5:40] down at any time he desired and talk
[5:43] lipto ear with Adam and Eve. Now that is
[5:46] perfect oneness. God and his creation.
[5:48] God speaking lipto ear with Adam and
[5:50] Eve. And they were so perfect in harmony
[5:52] with God till they were one with God.
[5:56] God and his family was one. And any man
[6:00] and his family, a correct, good, noble,
[6:02] obedient family is one with another. I'm
[6:07] going to read that again. Any man and
[6:09] his family, a correct,
[6:13] good, noble, obedient family is one with
[6:18] another. any family. And if there's
[6:22] something in the family that moves them
[6:24] apart, then it's not right.
[6:27] &gt;&gt; The family's broken somewhere. They
[6:29] should all be one. Father with mother,
[6:32] mother with father, children with
[6:33] parents, parents with children, all in
[6:36] agreement. And when you see that, you'll
[6:39] see one lovely picture. That's God's
[6:43] purpose.
[6:44] Okay? That's God's purpose to see
[6:48] families in unity one with another.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:52] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna I'm gonna re emphasize
[6:54] something. He says any man and his
[6:58] family, a correct, good, noble, obedient
[7:02] family,
[7:04] if your family
[7:07] does not have oneness, does not have
[7:08] unity, if there's a wedge between
[7:10] parents and children, it is not a good
[7:12] family.
[7:14] Right? Because he says that's what the
[7:16] prophet said. A good family is one that
[7:18] has oneness. If there's not oneness, you
[7:22] don't have a good family.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:25] &gt;&gt; If there's a wedge between husband and
[7:27] wife, you do not have a noble family. It
[7:31] is not a good thing. Okay? Anything that
[7:35] comes between the members of the family
[7:37] is wrong. You cannot have dissension in
[7:41] the family if because what happens is we
[7:46] let things come into our family and
[7:48] break up the family unity
[7:51] and
[7:55] you know parents man it's just such a
[7:57] big thing um where to even begin with
[8:00] this listen when you have the hearts of
[8:03] the children leave the home because
[8:04] there's been a wedge there's been an
[8:06] emotional or spiritual wedge driven into
[8:08] the home because something was said,
[8:11] something was done. Now the the children
[8:13] are offended, right? The dad made a
[8:15] mistake or or didn't take the time to
[8:17] take care of the emotional needs of his
[8:19] children and now there's an emotional
[8:20] wedge there that's that the devil is
[8:22] hammering farther and farther down and
[8:24] it's driving those children's hearts out
[8:25] of their home. Yeah, they still live
[8:27] there, but they don't live there in
[8:28] their heart. They're looking for every
[8:30] excuse to go out the door.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; Right? Amen.
[8:33] &gt;&gt; You could have a husband and a wife that
[8:35] something was said, something was done.
[8:37] Might have been something minor, but
[8:38] it's just another straw on the camel's
[8:40] back and eventually something breaks and
[8:43] now the the wife's heart leaves the
[8:45] home. Husbands husband Yeah. They're
[8:47] they're under the same roof. They're
[8:50] married in name only,
[8:53] &gt;&gt; right? They they're effectively trying
[8:55] to raise children in a broken marriage
[8:57] out of wedlock because the the the love
[8:59] that binds the marriage together is
[9:01] broken.
[9:02] And this is this is the goal of Satan
[9:04] because and you know it's the Satan it's
[9:06] Satan's goal because that was his goal
[9:08] in the very beginning. That's what he
[9:09] did in the Garden of Eden.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:11] &gt;&gt; Right? That's how Satan attacked God and
[9:15] his family was to drive a wedge and drag
[9:18] God's family to family court. Right? Now
[9:21] we have a marriage and divorce
[9:22] situation. Now we have, you know, Adam
[9:26] raising children that aren't his. Now we
[9:29] have stepchildren involved because
[9:32] that's how Satan will attack God's
[9:34] children every single time. It's not a
[9:36] coincidence
[9:38] that we see the social issues that we
[9:40] have today because that's the product of
[9:42] when you let Satan run the world.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[9:47] Um
[9:50] and so God if God's great purpose and we
[9:52] want to get into this. What was God's
[9:54] three-fold purpose?
[9:56] This is from Christ is the mystery of
[9:57] God revealed.
[9:59] Um, now God had a purpose and a hidden
[10:02] mystery. And that's what I want to speak
[10:04] on to the church this morning. The
[10:06] hidden mystery of God that he had in his
[10:09] mind before the world ever began. And
[10:12] now and how that it's unfolded itself
[10:15] right down to the present hour that
[10:17] we're living in. See, then you will
[10:19] understand clearly. Then you will see, I
[10:22] believe, what is being done.
[10:26] And um I'm just kind of taking some
[10:28] excerpts because we don't have time to
[10:29] go through the whole thing. But um he
[10:32] says, "See, God has this all to himself.
[10:35] It's a secret. And that's the reason
[10:37] there was silence in heaven for a space
[10:39] of a half hour and seven thunders
[10:41] uttered their voices." And John was even
[10:43] forbidden from writing it. See, the
[10:45] coming of the Lord, that's one thing he
[10:47] hasn't revealed yet of how he'll come
[10:50] and when he will come. So here he is,
[10:52] brother Brandham talking about that part
[10:54] of this mystery is the seventh seal,
[10:56] right? The the sealing of the seals that
[10:58] that that even John there was a silence
[10:59] in heaven for the space of a half hour.
[11:01] John isn't allowed to write because
[11:02] there's a there's a mystery that's being
[11:04] bound up here, right? There's a mystery
[11:06] going to be tied up that's going to be
[11:07] released in the last day.
[11:10] And God's keeping it a secret, right?
[11:11] He's got a big secret that's from before
[11:13] the foundation of the world. It's the
[11:14] whole point of everything.
[11:19] And he says, "And he has showed or
[11:20] revealed it in every type that's in the
[11:24] Bible." Therefore, the entire Bible is
[11:28] the revelation of God's mystery in
[11:30] Christ. The entire Bible is an
[11:33] expression of one goal that God had one
[11:37] purpose.
[11:39] He wanted to achieve in the entire
[11:41] Bible. And all the acts of the believers
[11:43] in the Bible has been in type and
[11:46] expressing what God's great goal is.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; Okay? So the entire Bible from cover to
[11:53] cover had one purpose behind it, right?
[11:56] It's what brother Brandham just said. He
[11:58] has one purpose in the entire Bible.
[12:01] There's a goal that he's trying to
[12:02] achieve. It's it's the reason he did
[12:04] started from the very beginning before
[12:05] the foundation of the world. That's what
[12:07] he set out to do. That's the whole
[12:08] reason he built all of this.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. is to achieve one goal.
[12:15] Notice God has a threefold purpose in
[12:18] this great mystery secret. God in his
[12:21] great mystery secret that he had before
[12:24] the world began, he got a three-fold
[12:26] purpose in it. And now what we want to
[12:30] go up this morning is what is that
[12:33] three-fold purpose? I'm sure you all can
[12:36] just rattle off the three-fold purpose.
[12:38] what the three purposes are off the top
[12:40] of your head.
[12:42] Anybody?
[12:44] Nope. I couldn't either.
[12:47] That's why it's Sunday school.
[12:52] So, he says, um,
[12:55] right? So, so here we have God. He's got
[12:57] three purposes, right? It's a three-fold
[13:00] purpose he's got in this mystery. The
[13:01] whole reason the world has began is
[13:03] wound up in this. Yeah.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; Now,
[13:07] uh I might be able to read the quote if
[13:08] if I have it. Um but I'll summarize it
[13:11] because time flies when you're having
[13:13] fun. Um I'm going to summarize it into
[13:16] three bullet points,
[13:18] but it is in Christ the mystery of God
[13:20] revealed. I highly encourage you all to
[13:22] go listen to and read that. Um but he
[13:26] has I'm going to just summarize it.
[13:30] Number one, the first purpose was
[13:32] Jehovah expressed to his people as a
[13:36] father.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; Two, to have preeminence in his people
[13:41] who take on his nature and express his
[13:44] life
[13:45] as a husband to his wife. And three, the
[13:50] redemption of God's family back to their
[13:52] original state as they were in the
[13:54] Garden of Eden, a united family.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God's threefold purpose, I know
[14:01] this is rocket science, three-fold
[14:04] purpose was to have children, a wife,
[14:07] and a family.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; Wow. Shocking. I know. But but ser I
[14:14] mean, but but we kind of we because it's
[14:16] so simple, we don't take it seriously.
[14:18] Right.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; The problem is we don't take it
[14:21] seriously and then we end up deviating
[14:24] from God's plan because we're not taking
[14:28] his purpose in life seriously,
[14:31] right? It's vital. It's not a small
[14:33] thing. Family order and family
[14:35] structure, the way husbands treat their
[14:37] wives and the way wives treat their
[14:39] husbands and the way children interact
[14:40] with their parents is not
[14:43] uh it's not a side benefit of the
[14:45] message of the hour.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; Okay. It's the whole point,
[14:50] right? It's not just like a thrown in on
[14:53] the deal. It's the whole deal,
[14:57] right? It's God's purpose is to have
[15:00] unity in his people down to the family
[15:03] unit because it's a small microcosm of
[15:06] what he's trying to do on the whole.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; Right? And you know, you don't we we
[15:12] talk about the family structure is a
[15:14] type of God's family. That's not
[15:16] nothing, right? Types are very, very
[15:19] important to God. Types and shadows and
[15:21] reflections because
[15:24] &gt;&gt; God communicates in types. God's ways
[15:27] are so much above ours, we can't
[15:28] comprehend them. We can't wrap our head
[15:30] around God's laws in their entirety. So
[15:32] what does he do is he takes one of his
[15:35] laws and he condenses it into a story
[15:38] and he packs it down into a little flesh
[15:40] and blood example and puts it in the
[15:42] Bible so that we can see what is God's
[15:45] great universe spanning law condensed
[15:47] into the flesh and blood of fallen man.
[15:50] Right? That's what a type is. It's a
[15:52] reflection of this massive thing
[15:54] condensed into a small thing into into
[15:57] your life. And so that's why types are
[16:00] important. You know, Moses, I'll give
[16:03] you a an example.
[16:06] Moses smites the rock. Water comes
[16:09] forth. They need water again later. And
[16:13] he's the God tells him to speak to the
[16:15] rock and instead Moses gets a temper
[16:17] about it and smites the rock again.
[16:21] And then because of that, Moses was not
[16:24] allowed to enter the promised land.
[16:26] Okay.
[16:28] Brother Brandham said it's because Moses
[16:30] broke God's type, right? God couldn't
[16:33] allow him into the promised land because
[16:34] he broke the type. The type being that
[16:38] Christ, the rock, was smitten 2,000
[16:41] years ago. Water came forth, spirit came
[16:44] forth, fed the people, right? There's an
[16:46] outpouring of of the spirit at the day
[16:47] on the day of Pentecost. And then fast
[16:50] forward in our day, we don't smite the
[16:52] rock again. He's the high priest of our
[16:54] confession. We speak to the rock. And
[16:56] the same Holy Ghost that poured out on
[16:58] them then would pour out again.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[17:03] And and when that happens, it would take
[17:05] them into the promised land, right? That
[17:07] that happened right before they enter
[17:08] the promised land, which is the Holy
[17:09] Spirit, right? The the full
[17:10] manifestation of the Holy Ghost. What
[17:13] Moses did was he got himself out of the
[17:16] type of those that would speak to the
[17:17] rock as the high priest of their
[17:19] confession. And instead he put himself
[17:21] into the type of those who had crucified
[17:23] Christ aresh because he smoked him
[17:25] twice.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; Right? Instead Moses got out of this
[17:29] type and into a different type. And
[17:32] because of that, God can't allow Moses
[17:35] to go into the promised land for the
[17:37] same reason God can't allow the
[17:38] denominational world to have the
[17:40] outpouring of the Holy Spirit, a true
[17:42] actual Holy Ghost experience because
[17:44] they've crucified Christ twice.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; Right. They're not they're not you uh uh
[17:51] speaking to the rock. And if God allowed
[17:53] Moses to enter the promised land, then
[17:56] the denominational world in this day
[17:58] would have precedent, they would have
[17:59] legal precedent with God to have full
[18:01] access to the outpouring of the Holy
[18:03] Spirit like the bride does when God
[18:05] can't allow that. So because God can't
[18:08] allow it here, he couldn't have allowed
[18:09] Moses into the promised land.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; Right? The type has to follow. And
[18:14] that's exactly what we do in the modern
[18:16] day when we think oh well the family
[18:19] structure and and children and the
[18:21] relationships between family is not that
[18:24] important that it's just a side we don't
[18:26] center it as one of the core fundamental
[18:29] purposes of our lives. What ends up
[18:32] happening
[18:33] is when you break fellowship in the
[18:35] family, you're moving out of the type of
[18:38] of God's children in the Garden of Eden,
[18:41] and now you're moving into the type of
[18:43] God's children on the other side of a
[18:44] flaming sword.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; Right. That that what the fall did was
[18:49] it it had to it pushed God's children
[18:51] out of his presence, out of that
[18:53] lip-to-ear communication, and put a
[18:55] flaming sword between them that says,
[18:57] "We can't communicate. you there can no
[18:59] be no direct communication because
[19:00] there's sin in the in in the uh in you
[19:03] and if you tried to enter God's presence
[19:04] it would kill you right not not that God
[19:07] would strike you dead but that just your
[19:09] existence would cease to be right if if
[19:11] if God is the is the the life of God is
[19:15] the you know cosmic bleach that
[19:19] dissolves sin to its very essence and
[19:22] just disintegrates it. If you enter
[19:24] God's presence sinfully you will
[19:26] disintegrate.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Right. It's not it's not God striking
[19:30] you dead. It's it's just it's matter and
[19:33] antimatter. They it dissolves, right?
[19:38] This is why God puts a flaming sword
[19:40] there. You can't do this because he
[19:41] doesn't want you doesn't want you to
[19:42] disintegrate. So because so when you
[19:46] when you break communication in the
[19:48] family and the family the the the
[19:51] relationship between husband and wife is
[19:53] broken the relationship between mother
[19:55] the the parents and the children is
[19:56] broken and everything's in disarray in
[19:58] the family God can't speak in that
[20:01] family that family is now there's a
[20:04] flaming sword between that family and
[20:05] God.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:08] I have scriptures
[20:14] 1 Corinthians 11 and verse three. But I
[20:18] would have you know that the head of
[20:19] every man is Christ and the head of the
[20:21] woman is the man. The head of Christ is
[20:24] uh head of Christ is God. Every man
[20:26] praying or prophesying have having his
[20:28] head covered dishonereth his head. But
[20:31] every woman that prayeth or prophesieth
[20:33] with her head uncovered dishonoreth her
[20:36] head. For that is even all as if she
[20:39] were shorn. And then skipping to verse
[20:40] 13. Judge in yourselves. It is. Is it
[20:45] comely that a woman pray unto God
[20:48] uncovered? Doth not even nature itself
[20:52] teach you that if a man have long hair,
[20:54] it is a shame unto him? But if a woman
[20:57] have long hair, it is a glory to her,
[21:00] for her hair is given her for a
[21:03] covering. But if any man seem to be
[21:05] contentious, we have no such custom,
[21:09] neither the churches of God.
[21:13] So if a woman cuts her hair, she
[21:17] dishonors her h her head and as such it
[21:21] is unseammly for her to pray.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; That's what that's what Apostle Paul
[21:25] just said. Okay? She dishonors her head.
[21:28] If a woman dishonors her head, she no
[21:31] longer has access to God. There's a
[21:34] flaming sword between her and God.
[21:37] Right?
[21:39] There's a wedge between husband and
[21:41] wife. That's what the what he just said.
[21:44] If the woman dishonors her head and
[21:45] allows a wedge to come between her and
[21:47] her husband, she can no longer have
[21:49] access to God until that's resolved.
[21:52] Right? Brother Ram said she can't pray
[21:54] with cut hair unless it's a prayer of
[21:56] repentance.
[21:59] Now going to 1 Peter chapter 3.
[22:02] Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to
[22:05] your own husbands, that if any obey not
[22:07] the word, they also may be without the
[22:10] word be one by the conversation of the
[22:12] of the wives. While they behold you,
[22:15] chasteed your chasteed conversation
[22:17] coupled with fear. whose adorning, let
[22:19] it not be that outward adorning of
[22:21] plating hair, and of wearing of gold,
[22:23] and of putting on of apparel, but let it
[22:25] be the hidden man of the heart, and that
[22:27] which is not corruptible, even the
[22:29] ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,
[22:32] which is in the sight of God of great
[22:34] price. For after this manner in the old
[22:37] time, the holy women also who trusted in
[22:40] God adorned themselves, being in
[22:42] subjection unto their own husbands, even
[22:44] as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him
[22:47] Lord, whose daughters ye are, as long as
[22:50] you do well, and are not afraid with any
[22:52] amazement. So, here's Peter laying out
[22:55] in pretty practical terms what it means
[22:57] to honor your head as a woman. And then
[23:00] he says in verse 7, likewise ye
[23:02] husbands, dwell with them according to
[23:05] knowledge, giving honor unto the wife as
[23:08] unto the weaker vessel and as being
[23:10] heirs together of the grace of life,
[23:13] that your prayers be not hindered.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; So if a man does not honor his wife and
[23:19] treats her with the dignity and respect
[23:21] that she deserves as a child of God and
[23:23] as the as the she's doing all this
[23:26] stuff, right? cuz cuz he said that um
[23:29] uh where is it? Uh but let it be of the
[23:31] hidden man of the heart in that which is
[23:34] not corruptible, even the ornament of a
[23:36] meek and quiet spirit which is in the
[23:38] sight of God of great price. Right? That
[23:41] when a woman is behaving like a lady,
[23:43] God sees her as of great price. She is
[23:46] very valuable to God when she's behaving
[23:49] like a lady. And if and if the woman is
[23:50] behaving like a lady and the man does
[23:52] not honor her accordingly, God cuts him
[23:54] off.
[23:56] Ouch.
[23:58] Right. Husbands, treat your wives like
[24:01] they are the purchase of God. They God's
[24:04] blood paid for that woman.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; Paid to save her. And if you don't treat
[24:08] her as such, you have you have you have
[24:11] dishonored God and his family. And God
[24:14] will cut you off right there. You have
[24:18] driven a wedge into your home. You have
[24:20] you've treated her disrespectfully. And
[24:22] there God puts a flaming sword between
[24:24] you and him. your prayers will not be
[24:25] answered. Right?
[24:28] The same I mean this goes all the way to
[24:30] the bottom the the way h you know I'm
[24:33] running out of time so I can't really go
[24:35] too much into more into it today but I
[24:38] will just end with this.
[24:41] This is what I was going to hope to end
[24:44] on last time but here we are. Um I just
[24:48] wrote a bunch of questions rhetorical
[24:50] questions. I'm not going to take a quiz.
[24:52] Um,
[24:55] I said, "Do we suppose
[24:57] do we suppose that if family was the
[24:59] purpose of God when he formed our bodies
[25:01] that our biology and therefore
[25:03] psychology would contradict that?"
[25:06] Right? Do we think that we just special
[25:08] and that, you know, we don't we're not
[25:10] just naturally inclined to follow God's
[25:12] word and our biology if that's how God
[25:13] built us? Do we suppose that if God made
[25:16] us in his image, with his attributes,
[25:18] and with the same needs of the heart as
[25:20] himself, that we could just ignore them
[25:22] and suffer no consequences?
[25:25] Do we suppose that if God's great
[25:27] purpose was to have a family that
[25:29] Satan's disruption of that original
[25:31] family was a coincidence?
[25:34] Do we suppose that this modern that in
[25:37] this modern age so intent on disrupting
[25:39] the original pattern of the family is
[25:42] also a coincidence?
[25:44] Do we suppose that our individual
[25:46] freedom and liberty can run contrary to
[25:48] the foundation of our existence and the
[25:51] result and result in lasting
[25:53] fulfillment?
[25:55] Do we suppose the that the natural does
[25:58] not type the spiritual?
[26:01] Do we suppose that we can tr truly be
[26:04] the fulfillment of the invisible union
[26:05] between the earthly bride and the
[26:07] heavenly groom when we do not have a
[26:09] revelation on what God means by the word
[26:11] marriage?
[26:13] And do we suppose that God is
[26:16] unconcerned with the unity in our
[26:19] earthly families given his entire
[26:22] purpose of being is tied to having a
[26:25] united family?
[26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:30] If the three-fold purpose of God and the
[26:32] entire Bible culminates in a marriage
[26:34] complete with an invisible union, a
[26:36] wedding supper, a millennial honeymoon,
[26:37] and finally king and queen sitting on
[26:39] the throne together, do we then suppose
[26:41] that he is nonchalant about the line and
[26:43] order of his word concerning earthly
[26:45] marriages?
[26:48] And that's where I've got to stop. We're
[26:50] out of time. God bless you all. I love
[26:54] you guys.
[26:56] I will see you later.
