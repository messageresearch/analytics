Brother Luther, I wonder if you could come and take up the offering this morning. How many's got a need this morning? Amen. Lift it before the Lord. He's very mindful of his people this morning. Amen. Welcome to all the guests. Come on, brother. All our visitors today, just enter into the worship with us and the word of God. Amen. Um, I got a couple of uh church order announcements. We just [music] want to repeat a little bit what we said on Wednesday. Um, you know, it and and it was funny that Joe Hartell got up here and said, "If [music] you wanted to take notes on your cell phone," and I was back there like, "No, no, no, no, no." But, you know, if you use your cell phone for worshiping the Lord or taking a notes in the service, that's fine. It's up to you. It's in your heart. It's not like people can sit there and look over your shoulder. You're texting a friend or something. God knows. Um, so if you're using it for the kingdom, Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; If you're reading your Bible on it, all that, that's good. But once we get in here, we do want to just focus on the Lord. This this is a sanctuary. Um, so one of the things I'm going to say it this way that I've been requested to talk about was we have a nursery for the moms and the babies. And um, you know, Brother Brandham said talked about moms that had to go in and out, take care of the babies and stuff like that. [music] He said, "God sees that and God will honor that." And and um I had babies long time ago and they it it's a job that's mom's job is like the the best job on the planet. Also one of the hardest. Um and we do appreciate you. And [music] so and you realize when your little one's fussing or something and you need to go to the nursery, you know, we're not going to be sitting there going, "Oh, you need to go." So, we just want to bring that up. Um, now I mentioned something about they didn't ask me to mention this part about gum. Okay? And anybody that reads the message knows what brother Brandham said about chewing gum in the sanctuary. Okay? He said it grieves the angel of the Lord. [music and clears throat] So therefore, that's why I mention it, not because um it's my thought. I try not to take my thoughts. So, um, we would appreciate it. We, um, don't allow chewing gum in the sanctuary. You know, if you, if [music] you inadvertently come in, it's not like a, you know, a felony or anything. You just, you realize, okay, just go get rid of it one way or another. &gt;&gt; Um, I'm not here picking on anybody. Um, I'm just doing [music] a job back there. And um I guess you could say I'm guarding [music] the door. So we would appreciate it if if you're chewing gum, just get rid of it. And the other thing is this is [music] when like just before services is starting and stuff, those doors back there don't block out hardly any noise. And I know sometimes you meet a [music] sister you haven't seen or a brother and you're right at the door and you're you're talking and it's a little loud. comes right in the sanctuary. And you got people in here that are, you know, maybe reading their Bible, praying in preparation for the service. So, I'm just I just ask this is me asking cuz I sit back there, you know, if you would move away from the back doors, do it off to the side or [music] something so that until we get it rebuilt and there's a vestibule and stuff back there, we need to kind of take care of that. You love me? &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Let me hear you say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, that's none of that is me. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray. Father, I love you this morning. And Lord, the Sunday school that we heard, Father, and so many people can make it dos and don'ts, but Lord, if we just get the doer in our hearts and Lord, walk before you by faith, Father, it's it's pleasing for us to be able to please you in walking according to your word. I pray that you'll bless our visitors, bless the service this morning. Father, we come for [music] one purpose. to gather together in the name of Jesus Christ. You said you'd be there in our midst. May we with open hearts looking to you this [music] morning, receive what you have for us. And we pray that you'd receive our worship that it would be in spirit and truth. It would be pleasing to you. We love you, Lord. We worship you. Pray for those that are streaming. I want to mention [music] the sick amongst us, Lord. Those that might be streaming, fighting things like cancer, [music] just Father, I pray for them in the name [music] of Jesus Christ. You'd comfort them today. We know that you're a healer. [music] Grant us the faith and revelation to receive it. Father, as we collect the tithes and offerings, Father, I pray that you bless the cheerful giver. We thank you for the bounty that you give us, Lord. Nobody here is begging bread. We thank you for that. Bless your people, we pray in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you greet one another in the name of the Lord as we sing this song? We haven't sung this one in a little bit. Someone needs some help. These are the days of Elijah [music] declaring the word of [singing] the Lord. Put your hands together. And these are the days [music] of your servant Moses righteousness being [music] restored. And though [singing] these are days of great trials of famine and [music] darkness [singing] and sore. Till we [music] are the voice in the desert crying prepare ye the way of the Lord.

Come [singing] for the weak [music] and the strong just the same. and all will [music and singing] believe in the power [music] of his name. Come [music] Jesus, come.

Happy to have you here in the house of God with us today. Amen. And we want [clears throat] to get to the word. I sure enjoy was enjoying all of that singing and uh step out and see a lot of visitors here. God bless you. We're happy to have you all here today with us. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you all. We're going to invite you to Matthew chapter 13 this morning. Amen. [clears throat] I've had a thought um going simmering as they would say on the back burner for some weeks and been trying to wait for the uncction of the Holy Spirit to come to it. And I think today, Amen. I thought how appropriate, Sister Esther, and then would sing that. You know, today could be the day. Amen. Praise the Lord. What if today was rapture day? &gt;&gt; Oh. My goodness. Amen. Make us all want to roll around on the ground, don't it? [laughter] Amen. So, I want to speak to you today from a burden of the word the Lord put on my heart called drawing near to God. I think that nothing um is of more paramount importance than that you would not just draw near to God, but live near God. And I think by the help of the Lord, we'll be able to demonstrate that today in the word. Amen. Drawing near to God. But really the the emphasis and I want to remember I want to tell you what I'm going to tell you. Then I'm going to tell you, then I'm going to tell you what I told you. Amen. So the emphasis today is to draw near to God and to live there. Turn around, shake hands with somebody standing near you. Amen. Say, "God bless you. We're happy to have you in the house of God today. Amen. [clears throat] Praise the Lord. Nothing like the family of God. Amen. Praise the Lord, buddy. What you doing slipping here on me like this? Amen. Praise God. Brother Bob, different ones, other different ones. God bless you there. Happy to have you all here. Amen. Uh pray. Oh, this must be uh uh um Aby's family. Is this your family, Abigail? All right. Praise the Lord. God bless you. Happy to have you. Amen. Happy to have all these visitors here today. Amen. Amen. We're not about to call brother Randy and Sister Anna visitors. They're family. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, we're happy to have all of you here, different ones today. God bless you, brother. Amen. Amen. Brother Jack, I appreciated that quote you sent me. That was just spot on. Amen. Matthew chapter 13. We're going to catch, we're going to go through 17 verses, but we're only going to read the first nine, and we will let you be seated. [clears throat] The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the seaside, and great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat, and the whole multitude stood on the shore. And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a swer went forth to sew. And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the wayside, and the fowls came and devoured them up. Verse five. Some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and forth with they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth. Um and when the sun was come up, they were scorched and because they had no root, they withered away. Some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked them. Verse eight, but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit, some, now catch this nuance. Some brought forth a hundfold, some 60fold, some 30fold. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. Let's pray. [clears throat] Father, we thank you for your word this morning. And I just settle my heart and mind now, master, to look into these great and precious promises. It's by these very things that we are partakers of the divine nature. And Lord, there could be no greater desire than to partake of the divine nature. And I have a burden on my heart, a particular Lord. And I'm certainly be preaching to myself today. And I I'm I just know that it'll help others as it has helped me, Lord. And so I commit it to you. I commit myself into your hands as your servant, just as your assistant here at the pull pit. You're you're the preacher this morning, Lord. They sang a song. We step forward. We're only here to assist you. I pray you'll give us all hearing hearts and the visible audience and the invisible audience out across the airways. May it be all to your glory. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. God bless you, friend. You can be seated. Praise the Lord. Amen. Anelisa's parents here with us as well. Amen. Happy to have different ones. I'm trying so hard, sister. Good to see you again. God bless you here with us on a Sunday morning. Amen. Happy to have you all here in the house of God. I don't know [clears throat] where to begin other than just to begin at the beginning. And I've tried. And that might seem simple, but you'd [clears throat] be amazed at how much time I've spent just trying to figure out where to start. Amen. Because I I'm um I I'm a person of order. And um and I and and and I I like to be ordered as I go along. So, you know, when we look at the parable of the sewer, my goodness, it's been preached on, you know, through the through the centuries to the church and there's been every every look at it and almost we've over, you know, turned over every stone and looked under every and looked in every aspect of it. And I've heard some real amazing sermons taken from Matthew 13. First of all, Matthew 13 is the church ages in symbol form that is later augmented in the book of revelation. So whenever you read those first three chapters of the book of revelation, you can find every bit of it in Matthew 13. They all overlay you, you know, and I I don't want to get into the um into the nooks and crannies of that today because I'm that's not really my burden. There's a a number of things we could say here. You know, one of the one of the things that I that I that I when I look at that that's sewn by the wayside is the kind of a person who just hears the word and they're indifferent to it. They're ambivalent. They're just there's it means nothing to them. And and that's a sad state to be in. And I I had a sister one time who said to me she came for prayer because her mother who was an unbeliever and was in a denomination and she was very much opposed to her daughter being involved in the message and told her it was a cult and she should stay away from it. But her mother was angry. The sister wasn't coming to you know to try to to say I know this. I understand she doesn't understand what I see but I can't deal with the anger. What do I do about the anger? My mother's getting so angry. And I said well sister praise the Lord. She said, "Praise the Lord. How is that possibly I could praise the Lord? My mother's angry." And I said, "Well, that's the second best response she could have." She said, "How is that anything a second best response?" And I said, "Well, what if it didn't mean anything to her?" And she would just pat you on the head and say, "That's nice, darling. God bless you. Carry on." And it meant nothing to her. And it would just it went in one ear and it went out the other. And that is actually the overwhelming uh fulfillment that we see in the world today. The people uh they don't uh you know they they they don't see any need they don't see any need for real ferveny or to really believe a gospel that actually changes their life. I've said for years that when you haunt too long between two opinions, brother Brandham said that'll give you spiritual amnesia. And what'll happen to you? what I've seen happen too many times and I've I'm I'm sad to say that my experience teaches me that I've seen it even in people who ended up later on getting a hold of themselves coming to their senses, the Holy Spirit getting a hold of them and they proved out to be sons and daughters of God and became firm believers. So I so I know it can happen to believers where if if you if you wait around too long and you don't really commit yourself to ferveny. What'll happen is Satan will finally bring you a version of the gospel. And there's almost 40,000 different versions &gt;&gt; at this point and hearing 40,000 different versions of the single gospel. Remember friends in the early alpha church of the days of the apostles every church was a message church. There was no such thing as a church, a Christian church that didn't preach the message because they were preaching Paul the messenger, preaching his doctrine. And the whole church was founded on the apostle on the doctrine of the apostles and prophets. So it's only it's only after the church began to decline that after 2,000 years we end up with almost 40,000 variations, denominations, countless independent Christian movements and organizations. But there's only one true version. And if you and if you wait too long and and you don't, you know, you just KIND OF STAY AROUND THE FIRE, you you like you love God, you you enjoy the presence of God, you come to church, you are a believer, BUT YET THERE'S THERE'S REALLY UM THERE'S REALLY NOT THAT REAL COMMITT TO where the Lord can COME IN AND REALLY SEAL UP THE vessel and seal the BOX CAR CUZ HE WON'T SEAL IT AS LONG AS HE knows the heart's not fully committed. NOW, THE BOX CAR IS NOT YOU LIVING A PERFECT enough life to get the Holy Ghost. That's not what that means. The box car is a is a is an illustration of the human heart. And when the Holy Spirit sees that your repentance is not complete, not full, not thorough, not absolute, not total, he will not seal that in. You've got to repent. And that means complete absolute abandonment of me. Now that I've met him, I don't want to be me. I want to be him. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THAT COMES, YOU DON'T NEED TO WAIT 40 DAYS. YOU DON'T NEED TO WAIT 10 DAYS. YOU DON'T NEED TO FAST AND PRAY. THE HOLY GHOST IS THE PROMISE to you when your HEART HAS FULLY REPENTED AND ACCEPTED GOD'S WORD FOR THE HOUR in which you live. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when believers, EVEN GOD'S GANED FAMILY, IF I COULD SAY IT that way, linger too long and not and don't make that commitment, finally the devil will lead them to a version of the gospel that they want to be true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A VERSION THAT DOESN'T REALLY REQUIRE FERVENY OR A WHOLE lot of change WHERE THEY CAN STRADDLE THE FENCE AND BE LIKE THE the charismatic evangelical Christian world that IT GOD JUST, YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL IN MY HEART. GOD DOESN'T CARE HOW I live and I don't need TO CLEAN UP MY LANGUAGE OR CHANGE THE WAY I DRESS OR STOP GOING WHERE I GO. I THOSE THINGS DON'T MATTER. OH, THEY MATTER. &gt;&gt; They matter. If you want the power of God living in your life, it m your ferveny matters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here I am doing what I didn't want to do and getting into the trenches of this. But I I'm not it's not up to me. I just have to I just have to I'm just here to assist. Amen. SO, AND THEN OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THE MAJORITY of the world who are they they were they the gospel came, they heard it, they appreciated it, they might have even agreed with it and then went went out the door and like looking in a mirror, they forgot the kind of person the word showed them they were and they went right on. They go right on with their own life. You go to the stony ground. It's not a ground full of stones. It's that's not what it's saying. It's talking about like if you've seen it maybe hiking in mountain areas where you have a A BIG BOULDER JUTTING OUT and there's a little thin veneer of soil on it and a little bit of moss and some flowers growing. But but but it's only there because it stays in the shade. If that if the sun would move or IF THAT BOULDER OR SOMETHING WOULD SHIFT THAT BLOCKS THE SUNLIGHT and the sunlight would hit it, IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH root structure TO RES TO HANDLE the the the heat of the sun and so therefore IT WITHERS. IN OTHER WORDS, IT GETS OFFENDED. IT BECOME IT ANONS WITH JOY WHEN IT HEARS THE GOSPEL BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE JUST WANT a reprieve. THEY JUST WANT A A BREAK from sin. as brother Matt UH WATKINS PREACHED SOME YEARS AGO THAT PEOPLE ARE SOMETIMES VERY SORRY FOR THE WHAT SIN HAS CAUSED IN THEIR LIFE. THEY'RE VERY MUCH REPENTANT OVER THE DESTRUCTION, BUT THEY'RE BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS BEING SORRY FOR THE sin that led to that. &gt;&gt; Amen. AND SO PEOPLE ARE KNOWN WITH JOY. BUT THEN AS SOON AS IT AS SOON AS YOU BEGIN TO realize that this is supposed to make changes in your life, then you become offended at the word because you feel like it's telling you what to do. And that and and THE WORD IS NEVER DOING THAT. IT'S TELLING YOU WHAT YOU WHAT YOU IT THE WORD IS TRYING TO GET YOU TO UNDERSTAND. I KNOW GOD IS SAYING I KNOW HOW TO MAKE YOU HAPPY AND FULFILLED AND THAT IS TO KEEP MY WORD. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT GOD FORCING HIS WORD UPON YOU. IT'S GOD OFFERING YOU ETERNAL LIFE AND THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT AND THE AND THE AND LOVE AND JOY AND PEACE AND HAPPINESS AND THE POWER OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIEND. THERE'S NOTHING LIKE LIVING a real fervent Christian life. Amen. &gt;&gt; But then OF COURSE IT COMES TO THAT WHICH IS AMONG THORNS AND that's a whole massive sermon in itself because this is this is where I THIS IS JUST WHERE I HAVE IN MY STUDY OF WHAT BROTHER BRANDHAM has said about it and the various scriptures I I can see when I read that about the thorns THAT IT SPRANG UP. IT WAS IT WAS GOSPEL SEED. It was the Jesus CALLED THE GO THE GOSPEL SEED AND IT'S GOOD SEED. IT'S JUST GOT TO GET IN GOOD GROUND. IF IT IF it lives like Lot did in Sodom, HE HAD A RIGHTEOUS SOUL. YOU UNDERSTAND? AND IT VEXED HIS RIGHTEOUS SOUL. BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID HE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE PLAIN NERVE TO STAND AGAINST IT. I JUST SAY, LORD, I DON'T NEED, YOU KNOW, I DON'T NEED A FIREWORKS. I JUST NEED THE PLAIN NERVE. GIVE ME THE PLAIN NERVE TO WALK IN THIS SODOM WORLD AND STAND AGAINST IT IN MY LIFE AND LET THE WORLD KNOW WHOSE SIDE I'M actually on. &gt;&gt; No compromise. Amen. &gt;&gt; We we just recently I I mentioned to you that we had something in the works and there was an organization uh of of of evangelical Christian men and and they go around and they build churches for people and they do it for free and they just you just have to buy the material AND THEY SHOW UP HERE LIKE AN ARMY. You you've seen them. THEY THEY'LL BUILD THEY'LL THEY ACTUALLY WERE SAYING WE CAN COMPLETELY DRY in your next phase AND THEY WOULD DO IT OVER A WEEKEND AND WE WOULD SAVE TENS AND TENS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS cuz they would do all the labor for free. And it WENT THROUGH THEIR PROCESS AND WE WERE PRE PRELIMINARILY FAVORED AND THEN IT WENT TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND WE WERE MORE FAVORED AND IT WENT RIGHT TO THE DECISION LINE AND THEY FOUND OUT THAT WE LEAN TO THE teachings of William Brham and they pulled the plug. Pull the plug AND WE WERE ALMOST READY TO ANNOUNCE TO YOU GREAT TIDINGS OF JOY. WE'VE GOT A CREW COMING TO BUILD IT OVER A WEEKEND. AND THEY SAID, "LOOK," THEY WROTE US A QUESTION SAID, "WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON WILLIAM BRANDAM?" THEY WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER. They went on AND HEARD THE PREACHING THAT GOES ON IN THIS PULL PIT. AND THEY THEY PULLED THE PLUG AND THE THE MAN WHO WAS AT THE HEAD OF IT WAS A PASTOR AND HE SAYS, "NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING FOR THOSE BRANDOMMITES." [snorts] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY? IT'S THEIR LOSS. They'll see on THE DAY OF ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT, THEY MISSED A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY for the blessing of God. See, I'M NOT GOING TO SWEAT IT. THE LORD THE LORD THE LORD KNEW IT WOULD HAPPEN. THE LORD HAS GOT US. THE LORD'S GOT THIS. SEE, SO SO YOU KNOW I I WANT THE PLAIN NERVE TO STAND AGAINST the the the the the the Christian light, message light, WHERE YOU KNOW I GET TO BE A BELIEVER OF WILLIAM BRANDOM WHICH IS NOT ANY HIGHER THAN THE devil believes. I get to believe THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL AND I GET TO UNDERSTAND THESE MYSTERIES WHICH THE DEVIL DOES ALSO. I I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT SATAN KNOWS WHO WILLIAM BRANDHAM WAS. SATAN HAS A LONG TRACK RECORD OF LOSSES FACING THAT PROPHET'S MINISTRY. HE WAS QUITE GLAD TO SEE HIM GO. IT PROBABLY SHOCKED THE DEVIL THAT THE LORD WOULD LET HIM TAKE HIM, THAT THE DEATH ANGEL WOULD COME LIKE THAT. I HAD A MAN SAY TO ME, "YEAH, HE ONLY DIED IN THAT HORRIFIC CAR CRASH BECAUSE OF HE OBVIOUSLY HAD DISPLEASED GOD." AND I SAID, "REALLY?" I SAID, "SO, WHAT ABOUT JOHN THE BAPTIST WHO HAD HIS HEAD CUT OFF? WHAT ABOUT ST. PAUL WHO HAD HIS HEAD CUT OFF. WHAT ABOUT PETER WHO WAS CRUCIFIED UPSIDE DOWN? I SAID, "SIR, YOU'VE LET A DEVIL TELL YOU THAT AND IT'S GOING TO DESTROY YOU IF YOU KEEP BELIEVING IT." &gt;&gt; It's a the history is replete WITH GREAT WARRIORS OF THE FAITH WHO WENT DOWN and and we could say ALL DAY LONG, WHY DIDN'T THE LORD PROTECT THEM? THEY'RE THEY'RE ALIVE STILL. I [screaming] PROMISE YOU, THEY'RE NOT UNHAPPY GOING, "MAN, I JUST WISH THE LORD SHOULD HAVE STOOD STOOD up for me." WHAT DO YOU THINK THE CHILDREN OF STEVEN ON THE FIRST NIGHT HOME WITHOUT DADDY? &gt;&gt; How do you THINK THEY FELT? &gt;&gt; OH, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. YOU NEED TO DRAW NEAR to God. You need to live near to God. &gt;&gt; This world is falling apart rapidly. Brother Matthew was just sharing in the minister's chat this morning about a move that the new American POPE FROM THE UNITED STATES HAS NOW UH BEGUN TO PUT FORWARD that it was Jesus Christ alone who saved the world, not Mary as an intercessor. And he's he's LOWERING THE BAR SO THAT THE SO THAT THE PROTESTANTS CAN BECAUSE THAT WAS A MAJOR OBSTACLE. WE CAN'T HAVE MARY IN BETWEEN US AND JESUS. AND NOW THE US POPE IS SAYING, "WELL, YOU DON'T NEED TO." GUESS WHAT? IT WAS JESUS ALONE. WE BELIEVE THE SAME THING. COME ON. LET'S BE FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; There are things happening in the business world and in technology and and in the markets and things and there are some amazing things going on with gold. And don't you think and I'm not here to give you a perspectus on investing. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT THE MILLENNIUM IS COMING &gt;&gt; AND THIS WORLD IS ON ITS LAST LEG AND IT'S ABOUT TO FADE OUT AND THEY'RE MOVING INTO A SITUATION YOU CANNOT DEFEAT PROPHECY. GOD HAS SEEN THIS AGE. THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO, WROTE ABOUT IT IN DETAIL, SENT A PROPHET TO GIVE US THE INSIDER INFORMATION. I'M SO GLAD MY HEART IS NOT FAILING FOR FEAR. I HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR. I KNOW WHO'S IN CONTROL OF IT ALL. &gt;&gt; SO, we come to the the THE THE SEED SOWN IN GOOD GROUND. In the parable of the swer, we see this nuance within the good ground. And and AND YOU KNOW, I JUST WONDER I AND I'VE WONDERED FOR YEARS. And I I'm not here today to try to establish this as an uh what I'm about to SAY AS SOME DOCTRINE. It's just the best that I can surmise as a student of the word. BUT YOU KNOW, SOME BRINGS FORTH A HUNDRED and some brings forth 60 and some brings forth 30. Now, I got no problem with that. Perhaps it's that his great dispensational angels and his prophet messengers are hundreds and maybe maybe his his martyrs and ministers are in the 60s and AND MAYBE JUST YOU KNOW HOUSEWIVES AND FARMERS ARE IN THE 30S. I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY WHAT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ABOUT ONE BEING BETTER THAN THE OTHER. THE GROUND IS LEVEL at the foot of the cross. THAT'S REALLY NOT THE POINT THAT I I'M GLAD I DON'T HAVE THE WEIGHT OF THE MESSAGE ON MY SHOULDERS LIKE WILLIAM Brandham had. &gt;&gt; I I'm GLAD THAT I DIDN'T BROTHER THEY BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY PEOPLE SAY OH I JUST WISH I had that gift. He said you don't even know what you're saying. Said it's a razor's edge from insanity. AND HE AND SO I I'M GLAD I DON'T HAVE THERE THERE WERE THINGS THAT THAT I CRUISE RIGHT THROUGH THAT THAT THAT GOD DOESN'T COME TO ME LIKE HE DID TO THE PROPHET AND PUT HIM ON THE CARPET OVER AND AND AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT LEVELS OF UNGODLINESS. WE'RE all on the carpet over that. BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT SUPER SUPER CLOSENESS. YEAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND AND I JUST SAY, LORD, I HERE HERE HERE HERE'S THE AT THE END OF THE DAY, HERE'S WHAT I SAY TO THIS WHOLE 100. HERE'S THIS 30, 60, 100 IS WHATEVER GOD HAS CALLED ME TO BE. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF HE ONLY WANTS ME TO BE A 42. I'D LIKE TO BE 100% OF MY 42. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? THEN I'LL HEAR WELL DONE JUST THE SAME AS WILLIAM BRANDON WILL HEAR WELL DONE. AND I WANT TO HEAR, "WELL DONE, MY GOOD AND faithful servant." &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter TO ME IF HE'S CALLED ME TO BE A 19 OR A 12. CAN I BE A 100% OF MY 12? &gt;&gt; SEE, IF I IF I'M A 74, I DON'T WANT TO SHOW UP AS A 57. &gt;&gt; I don't want to do that. IF I'M A 61, I DON'T WANT TO SHOW UP AS A 25. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE A 100% OF WHATEVER HE HAS CALLED ME TO. AND THAT'S WHERE LIVING NEAR TO GOD, THAT'S WHAT IT'S REALLY ALL ABOUT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SO MANY SCRIPTURE VERSES BECAUSE WE WE wonder today. We could wonder AND IT'S A FAIR QUESTION AND YOU SHOULD ASK IT. AM I CAN I? AND I BELIEVE YOU CAN. AND AM I COMING UP SHORT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Of the precious promises. When I look AT SO MANY SCRIPTURAL VERSES, I THINK ABSOLUTELY IT can be. You know, we we we Paul even spoke about that lest a promise any of you seem to come short of it. He's talking to believers. &gt;&gt; We're not TALKING ABOUT A NEW BIRTH. But what is God able to do living through you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you're the bottleneck. &gt;&gt; You're the hindrance. I would like to be an unhindered conduit for the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. nothing between my soul and my savior. That's certainly I've repented. I'VE RECEIVED THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, BUT I DON'T WANT MY I don't want the Lord coming trying to use the mind of Christ and my mind is can muddying the waters. Or God HAS AN INTENTION, BUT I GOT MY INTENTIONS. WELL, WHY DO I GOT MY INTENTIONS? MY INTENTIONS SHOULD BE HIS INTENTIONS. &gt;&gt; THE THE THE THE DESIRE EVE WAS TOLD, "THY DESIRE SHALL BE TO THY HUSBAND." THAT MEANS THAT WHATEVER HIS GOALS ARE FOR ME, THEY'RE MINE. THEY'RE MY GOALS. DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY WERE. I MIGHT HAVE SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE GA GETTING AN EDUCATION FOR A BIG CAREER AND I'VE GOT MY PLAN SET AND I'M GOING TO GO FORWARD. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, GOD CAN COME DOWN UPON MY LIFE AND GO, YOU'RE ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO DO ANY OF THAT. I'VE GOT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLAN FOR YOU. YOUR QUESTION IS, DO I DO I HINDER OR DO I COOPERATE IN THE VISION? AND I WANT TO TELL YOU AS A MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL, FORGET WHAT YOU WANT. FORGET WHAT YOU THINK. TAKE HIS LIFE. TAKE HIS MIND. TAKE HIS PLAN. IT'S THE ONLY PATH TO REAL TO REAL PEACE. &gt;&gt; AND REAL CONTENTMENT, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT. Real contentment is to be able. And only you can know whether this is true of you or not. And if it's not, let me encourage you that it could become true by the end of the service. When you lay your head on your pillow at night, NOT JUST ANY NIGHT, how about tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can lay with your head on YOUR PILLOW AND STARE AT THAT DARK ceiling and it's just you and your thoughts and God. And you can go to sleep knowing I am operating in the perfect will of almighty God. There is nothing that will give you such peace and safety and rest and contentment as that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF COULD WE COME SHORT? I I CAN SEE SO MANY SCRIPTURES. I CAN SEE BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKING ABOUT A MILLION SOULS. He said it should have been 10 million. What? He said, "What if I'd HAVE GONE WHEN HE FIRST CALLED ME?" &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, I didn't say it. He said it. &gt;&gt; He's asking a question. Maybe it's somewhat rhetorical. I don't know. BUT HE'S ASKING THE QUESTION, you know, IF I IF I'D HAVE JUST WENT WHEN HE FIRST CALLED ME. SEE, and and then and then in when when you hear brother Brandham giving his life story uh at Angelie's Temple in 1959, which is the best version of the life story in my opinion. Uh it's the one I grew up at the tabernacle. They would play it once a year and I loved that. It was my favorite service in the year. Uh it's what caused me as just a seventh grade junior high school student to to my what was in my book bag was Footprints on the Sands of Time. And I would sit near the side of with my back to the wall where I knew that prophet had been. And I would walk around. I'd sneak in in the darkness and walk around where he was standing preaching those great sermons. I stood with my back to the atrium area where he comes down and walks down a gang way. And he's walking around in there for hours after preaching it. They can't even get him back to HIS RIGHT MIND. AND HE'S WALKING AROUND. THIS DAY, THIS SCRIPTURE IS FULFILLED IN YOUR HEARING. AND WALKING AROUND AND AROUND THIS DAY, THIS SCRIPTURE IS FULFILLED IN YOUR HEARING. AND I AND I WOULD READ MY FOOTPRINTS ON THE SANDS OF TIME BOOK AND I WOULD CRY AND WEEP AND other students would come up, "What's wrong with you? ARE YOU OKAY? I'M FINE." AND I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO TELL THEM WHAT I WAS DOING. BUT I I HAD A LOVE FOR GOD AND I KNEW I NEEDED I NEEDED SOMETHING IN MY HEART TO CHANGE WHO I WAS TO WHAT I WANTED TO BE. I'M SO GLAD I FOUND JESUS. I'M SO GLAD I WAS CALLED TO THIS MESSAGE. I'VE NEVER REGRETTED IT A DAY IN MY LIFE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD I DO? WHAT WOULD I WHAT WOULD I HAVE TOLD MY FAMILY? HOW WOULD I WHAT WOULD I HAVE TOLD MY CHILDREN? I WANT THEM TO LIVE FOREVER. &gt;&gt; I WANT THEM TO HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. WHAT WOULD I DO? WHERE WOULD I TAKE THEM? HOW WOULD I KNOW? THANK GOD. OH, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO OPEN MY EYES. YOU COULD HAVE EASILY PASSED ME BY. FOR THE AGE I WAS LIVING IN WAS WRETCHED, POOR, AND BLIND. BUT [screaming] I HEARD RECOGNIZING YOUR DAY. SERPENT SEED AND PERFECT FAITH. THE BREACH AND THE MESSAGE OF GRACE AND LORD I thank thee. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham even confessing IN SUCH IN SUCH HUMBLE HONESTY HOW HE MISSED THE VISION OF THE BEAR. &gt;&gt; HE CONFESSED THAT HIMSELF. HE SAID I MISSED IT. IT'S IT'S ON ME. &gt;&gt; He he said THE LORD WAS TELLING ME ALL THE TIME TO GO WITH THESE BROTHERS BUT I WANTED TO STAY WITH THIS ONE. AND HE SAID, "AND THE BEAR WAS THERE. THERE WERE WITNESSES." BROTHER BISCOLL WITNESSED. HE SAID, "WE SAT AND WATCHED HIM FOR ALMOST AN HOUR AND AND TAKE HIM, SHOOT HIM." HE SAID, "NO WAY. NO WAY, BROTHER BRANDHAM. THIS IS THIS IS HIS THIS IS THE VISION." AND BROTHER BRANDHAM HAD WENT IN ANOTHER DIRECTION and has to come back to his OWN PULLPIT. DON'T THROW SOMETHING AT ME. I'M JUST TELLING YOU WHAT HE SAID. &gt;&gt; And he came back TO HIS OWN PULLPIT AND SAID, "I MISSED IT." &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT'S NOT PEOPLE SAY, "OH, THAT PROVES HE'S NOT A PROPHET. HOW STUPID." THERE ARE SO MANY PRO PLACES IN THE BIBLE WHERE YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT A TRUE PROPHET IS. PROPHETS MADE MISTAKES, HUMAN ERRORS, AND IT GOT THEM IN TROUBLE AND THEY HAD TO REPENT. BUT GOD, RICH IN MERCY. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T THROW THEM OUT. HE KEPT USING THEM. &gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD BECAUSE THAT GIVES ME A HOPE. AND I THINK, WELL, I GOT A CHANCE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IF HE IF HE IF THIS MAN WAS CALLED TO BE A HUNDRED AND AND HE'S MADE A FEW STUMBLES AND GOD KEPT USING HIM, IF I'M ONLY A 26, WELL THEN I GOT A CHANCE. &gt;&gt; Israel failed to keep its commitment to Jehovah AND THEY LOST OUT ON MANY promises of God. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS GOD didn't fail. &gt;&gt; ISRAEL LOST OUT. GOD PROMISED THEM THINGS and when they didn't GET THEM, IT LOOKED LIKE GOD'S IT LOOKED LIKE THE PROPHET WHO PROPHESIED it must have been A FALSE PROPHET. &gt;&gt; BUT IT HAD nothing to do with HIM BEING A FALSE PROPHET. IT WAS THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM TAUGHT US EVERY PROMISE IN THE BIBLE IS CONDITIONED. &gt;&gt; It's based ON A CONDITION. YOU'VE GOT TO meet the conditions. MANY TIMES IT'S JUST THAT YOU BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; YOU ALREADY CAN'T MAKE IT HAPPEN. SO YOU JUST BY FAITH YOU WALK AND YOU BELIEVE IT. YOU TESTIFY TO IT. BUT SOMETIMES THERE'S THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO DO. &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU DON'T DO IT, YOU MISS THE PROMISE. AND THAT'S NOT GOD'S FAULT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO WE WE READ ON HERE. UM, [sighs] GO BACK, KEVIN, AND LET'S PICK UP THAT 10TH VERSE BECAUSE WE WE'RE GOING TO READ ABOUT TAKING AWAY WHAT GOD PROMISED AND GIVING IT TO ANOTHER. Verse 10. AND THE DISCIPLES CAME AND SAID UNTO HIM, why speakest thou unto them in parables? Now, notice this answer. He, Jesus, okay, &gt;&gt; this isn't Matthew. This isn't the gospel writer Matthew's answer. This isn't William Brandoms or Paul's answer. This is Jesus's answer. He answered and said unto them, "Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given." People, you know, I've had a Baptist preacher get so mad at that concept, he wanted to fight me physically. So, so what we WHAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE world cannot receive the things of God's kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're they're foolishness to that man. SO, SO THUS WE SEE A TAKING AWAY FROM THOSE WHO WILL NOT APPLY the word. THAT ONE BY THE WAYSIDE. HE HEARD IT. HE HAD A CHANCE. He didn't take it. And so, WHAT WAS GIVEN TO HIM WAS TAKEN AWAY. ONLY THAT IT WAS THE FOWLS OF THE AIR. IT WASN'T WASN'T GOD GOING BACK on his word. It was the fowls of the air. The demons took it &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE MAN DIDN'T CARE about it. &gt;&gt; The one in the in the in THE STONY GROUND AND WHO WENT ON WITH JOY AND GOT ALL PERSECUTED AND GOT ALL ANGRY AND GOT AND AND GOT DEFENSIVE AND DIDN'T WANT TO BE TOLD BUT YOU KNOW SAID, "OH, Y'ALL ARE JUST A LEGALIST. YOU'RE JUST A CULT." NOTHING DOING. I IS, YOU KNOW, I I I'M SO GLAD THAT I HAVE THE ABILITY TO SIN AS MUCH AS I WANT TO AND GET BY with it. &gt;&gt; Say, well, could you tell us how much of that uh you how much sin would you like to have? Zero. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT LEGALISM OR KEEPING A BOOK of rules and codes. It's that God changed my nature and I don't like the things of the world. I like righteousness. I like it. I LIKE HOLINESS. I LIKE IT. IT'S PEACEFUL TO ME. IT'S ASSURING. IT FEELS SAFE. &gt;&gt; I'm not living this thing FROM GRITTED TEETH. MY MY only The ONLY TIME I GRIT AND NASH MY TEETH AND HAVE ANGUISH IS WHEN I FAIL TO KEEP IT. &gt;&gt; AND I HAVE TO GO BACK AND REPENT. LORD, I'M SO SORRY. FORGIVE ME. NOT ONLY DOES HE FORGIVE YOU IF YOU'RE HE'S FAITHFUL AND JUST TO FORGIVE, BUT HE WILL ALSO CLE THAT'S THE BEST PART OF IT. HE'LL CLEANSE YOU FROM ALL UNRIGHTEOUSNESS SO THAT NO STAIN IS LEFT ON ME. MY MIND IS CLEAN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO THEIR FOOLISHNESS TO HIM THE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NOT THAT GOD TOOK THE FRUITS of of of the person away who lived among thorns. It was the thorns that took the fruit. THE THORNS CHOKED THEM BECAUSE THEY CHOSE TO LIVE IN THAT. SEE? [sighs] SO HE HE GOES ON. SO SO THUS WE SEE THEN UH UH TAKING AWAY FROM THOSE WHO WILL NOT APPLY the word. Verse 12, for whosoever HATH TO HIM SHALL BE GIVEN, and he shall have more abundance. BUT WHOSOEVER HATH NOT FROM HIM SHALL BE TAKEN AWAY EVEN THAT he hath. See, SO THEY DIDN'T PUT FAITH IN THE WORD OF GOD. SO EVEN WHAT THEY HAD THEY THEY THEY THEY DIDN'T WANT GOD IN THEIR THE ANCIENT PEOPLE WHO KNEW GOD and when they knew God they chose not to worship him as God &gt;&gt; and therefore their their evil minds and conscience were darkened so that they could never be a believer again. GOD IS NOT GOD'S OBLIGATED TO TO CALL every man once and he's never failed to do that. HE'S NEVER FAILED TO OFFER a legitimate chance to save yourself from THIS UNTO GENERATION. GOD. JUST BECAUSE GOD KNOWS WHO WILL AND WHO WON'T, THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE FORCES PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; HE JUST KNOW HE CAN WRITE IT BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHO WILL AND WHO WON'T AND WHO WON'T WHO WON'T WANT THAT. BUT HE EVEN THE ONES WHO HE KNOWS WON'T DO IT, HE STILL GIVES THEM A CHANCE. HE GAVE CAIN A CHANCE. HE GAVE JUDAS a chance. &gt;&gt; HE GAVE ESAU A CHANCE. HE GAVE HE GAVE DAYAN AND KORA A CHANCE. &gt;&gt; ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO GOT SWALLOWED UP BY THE EARTH, MOSES SAID, "MOVE AWAY." AND THEY DIDN'T. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SEE? SO THEREFORE, VERSE 13, THEREFORE SPEAK I to them in parables, because they seeing see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, WHICH SAITH, BY HEARING YOU SHALL HEAR, AND SHALL NOT UNDERSTAND, and seeing you shall see and not perceive. Here's why. IS IT BECAUSE GOD IS UH IS EVIL? NO, NO. HERE'S WHY. For this PEOPLE'S HEART IS WAXED GROSS. &gt;&gt; That means IT IT STARTED OUT IN A FALLEN CONDITION AND IT GOT WORSE AND WORSE. &gt;&gt; And they worsened themselves as they went along. It waxed gross. See? &gt;&gt; AND THEIR EARS ARE DULL OF HEARING and their CATCH AND THEIR EYES THEY have closed. Jesus actually adding an ADDENDUM TO TO ISAIAH'S PROPHECY. THEIR EYES THEY HAVE CLOSED LEST AT ANY TIME THEY SHOULD SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND HEAR WITH THEIR ears and should understand with their heart and SHOULD BE CONVERTED AND I SHOULD HEAL THEM. SEE? SO WHY DO YOU THINK HE DROVE ADAM AND EVE OUT OF THE GARDEN OF EDEN AND PUT A FLAME ANGELS WITH A FLAMING SWORD TO GUARD THE WAY TO THE TREE OF LIFE? HE'S NOT GUARDING A TRAIL. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A TRAIL HEAD. HE'S NOT GOT ANGELS GUARDING A PATH. HE'S GUARDING THE WAY. HE'S HIDING THE REVELATION BECAUSE IF THEY COULD CATCH THE REVELATION OF THE TREE OF LIFE, WHICH IS CHRIST, THEN THEY WOULD LIVE FOREVER IN A FALLEN CONDITION. AND GOD CAN'T GOD, THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF KINGDOM HE'S GOING TO HAVE. I'M SO GLAD. &gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD THAT HE THE ETERNITIES ISN'T GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE SINNERS. &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE RIGHTEOUS AND THE AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD SHALL BE FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA. SO, SO WE'RE GOING TO SOMEWHERE THAT'S GRAND, FRIENDS, AND IT WON'T HAVE THE MUCK AND MIRE OF THIS WORLD THAT we seem so unfitted for. &gt;&gt; A NEUROTIC AGE THAT, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, WE SEEM UNFITTED FOR. It's true. We're not. We're not fitted for it. We were meant to live in a paradise, but we we these things have their purpose, and I'm going to come to it. I'm watching the clock before I turn turn a corner on us. AND SO, SO HE HE DROVE THEM OUT. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S GUARDING. HE'S STILL DOING IT. JESUS WAS STILL DOING it in his day. He was standing THERE CUZ THE SWORD IS THE WORD. AND HE WAS USING THE WORD EXCEPT YOU eat the flesh of the son of man, drink his blood, you have no LIFE IN YOU. THAT WAS THAT WAS THAT WAS NOT A DIRECT QUOTE, BUT THAT WAS A TAUGHT PRINCIPLE IN THE BIBLE. AND JESUS IS SAYING, YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHAT THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS IN YOUR MODERN DAY. AND SO WE WE REALIZE THAT HE WAS STILL GUARDING THE WAY USING THE SWORD SO THAT THEY COULDN'T EVEN AND MANY GOT OFFENDED AT THAT KIND OF A SAYING. AND WHO CAN BELIEVE THIS? This is a hard saying. Jesus never rushed to explain it. He never OH, DON'T LEAVE ME. HOLD ON, GUYS. HOLD ON. WAIT. WAIT a second. Uh sit down. You know, let me just Come on. Wink wink wink. Let me give you the insider. This is why I said that. Come on. It's all good. I love you guys. He just let him go and he turns to his disciples. You going to go too? And Peter said what we all say. &gt;&gt; Lord, where in the world am I going to go other than this message? &gt;&gt; It doesn't take me but about three seconds to lift my head up above, look around at what else is out there and go, "No, thank you. I'll stay right here. [laughter] There's nothing out there that even remotely appeals to me." Amen. &gt;&gt; AND SO FOR THIS, OKAY, VERSE 16, BUT BLESSED ARE YOUR EYES, FOR they see, and your ears, for they hear. For truly, VERILY, I SAY unto you, that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them, and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard THEM. FRIENDS, YOU REALIZE HOW PRIVILEGED that the This IS WHY PETER WOULD SAY, "YEAH, THE PROPHETS HAD IT WRITTEN, BUT WE HAVE A MORE SURE WORD OF PROPHECY THAN THEY HAD." CUZ IT WAS JUST IN IN ON IN A SCROLL. IT WAS JUST IN A SCROLL, BUT WE HELD HIM. WE HANDLED THE THE WORD OF GOD, THE WORD OF LIFE. WE ATE WITH HIM, SLEPT WITH HIM, FISHED WITH HIM, TALKED TO HIM. WE HAVE A MORE SURE WORD OF PROPHECY. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING TODAY BECAUSE THE BECAUSE THE MANIFESTED WORD BUT LIVING BEHIND SKIN IS THE GREATEST IS THE GREATEST FORM OF THE WORD &gt;&gt; MORE IT'S IT'S IT'S GREATER AS GREAT AS AS THIS IS IN WRITTEN FORM HOW MUCH GREATER DOES IT BECOME WHEN IT LIVES BEHIND SKIN &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND I CAN SAY TODAY WE HAVE A MORE SURE WORD OF PROPHECY THAN MALACHI HAD WHEN HE WROTE IT BECAUSE WE HAVE LIVED IN THE DAY TO SEE ITS FULFILLMENT &gt;&gt; AND NOT ONLY THAT, WE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOW WE ARE THE FINAL VOICE. WE ARE THE LIVING WORD. WE ARE THE ONES UH WITH A VOICE TO THE WORLD &gt;&gt; PROVING WHAT A PROPHET SAID. &gt;&gt; SAY, "OH, YOU KNOW, I JUST WISH WE HAD THAT SAME GIFT AND IF WE COULD JUST SHOW THOSE signs and prove it TO THEM." WILLIAM BRANDHAM did that for 33 years. It went around the world seven times. Wasn't something done in a corner. It didn't prove anything to them. They still they looked right at it and stayed unbelievers. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you something, friends. The there there was one man and he walked and he walked a a life. I'm not saying he wasn't a human being like Elijah with like passions and up. AND BROTHER RAM SAID THAT MANY HAD HIS UPS AND DOWNS. ELIJAH HAD THEM. PAUL HAD THEM. WILLIAM BRANDHAM HAD THEM. I HAVE THEM. YOU HAVE THEM. BUT GOD DON'T HAVE THEM. AND THE WORD DON'T HAVE THEM. SO SO IF I IF I CAN'T LIVE A PERFECT LIFE, LET ME HAVE PERFECT FAITH IN A PERFECT WORD. AND LET THE WORLD HEAR MY PERFECT TESTIMONY &gt;&gt; FROM MY PERFECT FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, [clears throat] SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT GOD KNOWS WHO WILL AND WHO WON'T, but that doesn't take away at all the [snorts] the legitimate opportunity to gain what they can all the way. I mean, that's so that's so powerful that God will actually let them go all the way and gain eternal life. Maybe they were never ordained to be the 30, 60, or 100. But but God is so fair and is so kind and so loving and doesn't even rejoice even in the death of a sinner. GOD WOULD LET ALL MEN COME TO KNOW HIM. GOD SAID TO ISRAEL, "WHY WILL YOU DIE? WHY WILL YOU NOT COME TO ME AND LIVE?" JESUS SAID THE SAME THING. You won't come to me that you may live. See, we we've GOT A WORD TODAY AND PEOPLE WON'T COME TO IT THAT THEY could live and HAVE ETERNAL LIFE, PASS FROM DEATH TO LIFE. BUT GOD IS SO BENEVOLENT AND SO KINDHEARTED AND HE'S NOT A OLD DOEY GRANDPA LIKE ME. HE'S HE'S HE'S VERY MUCH UH UH ABOUT HIS WORD AND YOU GOT TO KEEP IT. BUT LISTEN, IF YOU'LL JUST WALK TOWARD HIM AND GET CLOSE TO HIM, HE'LL NOT ONLY GIVE YOU THE WORD TO BELIEVE, HE'LL GIVE YOU THE FAITH TO BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; You can't lose. IT'S A SLAM DUNK. WHO WOULDN'T TAKE THIS KIND OF DEAL, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; BUT YET, THE WORLD IN MASS does not, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And because of that, they will not be able to impugn the king when he sits on the throne in judgment. Nobody will, as I've said to you before, you don't hear it. You don't, you know, they they make a little bit of an appeal. Hey, we did all these things in your name. And he'll just say, well, but I never knew you. Your hearts were full of iniquity. You notice that they don't re rebut that. There's nobody marching. There's nobody holding up signs. There's no demonstration. &gt;&gt; You know, they just go bow their head and go quietly away to their to their fate because they know they earned it. Well, sin pays wages, friends. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; It ain't wages you want to collect, but the problem is you can't avoid them. So you talk about God going to the wall in justice and fairness even will uh give them the opportunity to save themselves from destruction and even ARRIVE AT THE JUDGMENT BAR WHERE there's no mercy &gt;&gt; and give them eternal life. SO WHO'S GOING TO BLAME GOD IF PEOPLE END UP IN HELL OR END UP IN A LAKE OF FIRE? WHO COULD LITERALLY RAISE AN OBJECTION TO THIS KIND OF A KING &gt;&gt; WHO GAVE THEM EVERY OPPORTUNITY AND THEY STEPPED OVER EVERY BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IF YOU GO TO HELL YOU'LL STEP FIGHT YOUR WAY EVERY STEP BECAUSE CHRIST WILL PUT EVERY KIND OF BARRICADE AND YOU GOT TO KICK IT ASIDE AND STEP OVER IT BECAUSE YOU WANT WHAT YOU WANT when you want it &gt;&gt; see SO WE UNDERSTAND ALL RIGHT WE UNDERSTAND these things the you know the the real kicker is that ALTHOUGH HIS IT'S TRUE THAT HIS FAMILY can't be lost because their names are in the lamb's book of life and and it is true that they have passed from death to life, they can actually never come into the judgment. Their sins went before them in Christ. It's all settled when they get there. BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE THINGS GOD WANTED TO DO IN OUR lives had we only been willing to live nearer to him? Can I carry on? &gt;&gt; Now I'm coming coming a little closer to my burden. An easy life. That is when I say an easy life that means comfort uh without friction. That's the way I want to word it to you today. Comfort without friction will literally insulate you and it'll protect you from God's sharpening process. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll say that again. A life of ease and comfort will protect you from God's sharpening process and allow and you will languish and in levels of failure that you will never escape, never overcome, never get the victory over and you'll see the family of God all around you growing forward. And you'll long because you're a son of God, too. You're a daughter of God for real. You are truly you are a believer. But you but you surren you insulate yourself and you you move away from his sharpening PROCESS WHICH IS THE SAME THING AS moving away from him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a big point. That's an important point. And even believers choose it all too often or you know at least we get too comfortable. You know, here we are climbing to Mount Zion and sometimes we find a ledge that's pretty comfortable and we just stay there and and decide to stop climbing. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, why should I?" Cuz the age is getting worse. &gt;&gt; You understand? You know, if if if a flood is coming in and and I get comfortable on a 20ft ledge and and it's a 30ft tidal surge, I better be higher than 20t. &gt;&gt; You understand? So, this is why I'm always saying, reach up, grab you a higher handhold, and pull your cell phone up. Keep climbing. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT HOME YET. THE WORLD'S GETTING WORSE. KEEP CLIMBING. &gt;&gt; DON'T GET COMFORTABLE IN LEODYSIA. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO YOU MIGHT GET RELIEF WHEN YOU PRAY for a life of ease and comfort. You can get some relief, but you'll you're certainly not going to grow virtue. You're certainly not going to grow stability. And by no means will you grow spiritual maturity. No way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, people think sometimes that Oh, you know, I just want to if I just had a life on a 90 foot yacht, fully crewed and sailed the Caribbean all my life with billions of dollars, you know, uh I could avoid all the pain and all the troubles of the world, you know. But can I say to you today, friends, that that that that's only delaying the final end. That's just a baby cradle rocking you to sleep heading toward the fall. &gt;&gt; The whole world is ending. The house is on fire. You can't stay here. &gt;&gt; I I want you to understand, get your minds around that. Young people, I know you're young and you feel like you got your whole life ahead of you. You do. Could I could I encourage you TO MAKE IT BEYOND 70 YEARS, you know, or or or 70 PLUS 10 MORE OR 20 MORE? BECAUSE EVEN IF EVENTUALLY WE ALL DIE OR WE ALL GO IN A RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T ESCAPE IT. SO IF THAT'S THE CASE, THEN WHILE I'M HERE, LET ME TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE ETERNAL LIFE I CAN CUZ I'D LIKE TO LIVE FOREVER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. you know, um I remember years ago I I was preaching on, you know, where where Jesus talks about a rich man and and he said it's it's, you know, it's seemingly impossible uh because it you'd be easier to, you know, crawl through the eye uh a camel to crawl through the eye of a needle than to for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. And I remember saying just as a young preacher, you know, probably didn't realize how impetuous I sounded, but I said, "It's amazing to me why everybody seems to want to be that which Jesus said would be almost impossible to go to heaven as [laughter] what what is it you're chasing?" See, so the the the the apostle talks about um you know the many have pierced themselves through pierced themselves through with riches. &gt;&gt; See, SO SO SO WE REALIZE THEN that that 1 Corinthians 1:26, if you can, you don't have to catch it, but you can Kevin. 1 Corinthians 1:26, "For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh." There's nothing wrong with being a wise man, but when you're a wise man after the flesh, you the only way you can be that is when you deny the supernatural. [sighs and gasps] For you see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called. Yes. &gt;&gt; See, uh, James 2 and5, it's just a, you don't have to try to keep up, Kevin. I'm going to go fast. James 2 and5. Hearken, my beloved brethren. Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, &gt;&gt; and heirs of the kingdom, which he hath promised to them that love him? Back to 1 Corinthians 1:27-28. But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. And God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty, and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yay. And things which are not, to bring to not things that are. Now, the man who's gonna WHO'S GOING TO RUN AFTER THE world would read this these two verses right here. base things of the world and THINGS WHICH ARE DESPISED hath God chosen. And people who want their cake and eat it too and and want their life to be, you know, ONE ONE BIG PARTY, THEY READ THAT AND GO, "NO, thank you. I got too many plans and dreams." Well, go on. YOU YOU'RE PLANNING AND DREAMING YOUR WAY INTO A tribulation period. &gt;&gt; Well, you're going to lose it all anyhow. &gt;&gt; See? AND SO SO SO WE FIND THAT VERSE 28, THE THINGS of the world and THINGS WHICH ARE DESPISED HATH GOD CHOSEN. YAY. And things which are not to bring to not things that are. In other words, to show them how foolish they were for choosing the world. &gt;&gt; It means that character &gt;&gt; which we know to be a a victory, not a gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Real character. Real integrity, &gt;&gt; real patience, real strength only forms when life isn't easy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Struggle, &gt;&gt; disappointment, &gt;&gt; and delay are the tools God uses to shape you. &gt;&gt; Struggle. DISAPPOINTMENT, DELAY. THESE ARE THE TOOLS THAT SHAPE CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; THESE ARE THE TOOLS THAT SHAPE REAL INTEGRITY, PATIENCE, AND STRENGTH. THERE'S SO MUCH, BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT SO MUCH POWER, SO MUCH REAL POWER IN THE HEAVENS. WHY WOULD ANYONE ACCEPTS A ACCEPT a substitute level for your life when the heavens are full OF THE REAL? WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? HOW FOOLISH ARE YOU TO TO CHASE AFTER THE WORLD THAT'S PERISHING AND IGNORING THE THE DIVINE AND the righteous and THE ETERNAL THINGS THAT GOD HAS AND THE WAY HE WANTS TO BUILD REAL CHARACTER. IT YOU KNOW WHEN I SEE THAT IT IT CLEARLY SHOWS ME THAT YOU HAVE A VERY DISTANT VISION OF HEAVEN. RIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You have a a distant vision of what heaven will be in the world to come. If God if you would allow the Holy Spirit to really crystallize your vision of of the next world coming, the next life coming. You you young people have grown up into adults and married and got children now and been hearing Brother Jason say for years for decades, this life ain't about this life. It's about the next one. &gt;&gt; See? &gt;&gt; AND SO WHEN YOU'VE GOT A DISTANT VISION OF of heaven and what the world to come will be, then then THEN YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND WHY GOD BURDENED MY HEART TODAY. THAT GOD WANTS TO DRAW US NEAR TO HIM, &gt;&gt; NOT HAVE A DISTANT VISION OF WHAT HEAVEN IS JUST, YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT THAT I MEAN, YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE BIBLE. WHEN MOSES CAME AND THE AND THE FIRE CAME DOWN ON THE MOUNTAIN, MOSES SAID, "NOW, THE NEXT DAY, COME NEAR, COME CLOSE." AND WHEN THAT HAPPENED, THE PEOPLE RECOILED AND RAN BACK AND MOSES PLEADED WITH HIM, "NO, NO, NO, NO. DON'T GO AWAY FROM HIM. Come close to him. HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. YOU'RE GOING TO BE HIS COVENANT PEOPLE." NO, NO, MOSES. That's pretty scary. That's a lot. I don't think I can live up to that. You just go be a holy man for us and just tell us what he said. And that's what the world does today. Friends, that is not the family of God. THE FAMILY OF GOD wants to move close to him. &gt;&gt; AND I KNOW SOMETIMES IT CAN MAKE YOUR life look scary and it can make you have anxiety because YOU DON'T KNOW HOW AM I GOING TO EAT AND HOW WHAT AM I GOING TO WEAR? AND JESUS SAID, WHY WOULD YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT? YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWS THE THINGS YOU HAVE NEED OF. DO DOES THE SPARROW WORRY? DOES THE LILY WORRY? OH, YOU'RE AND HOW MUCH MORE ARE YOU THAN A SPARROW to God? &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN SEE THAT. I MEAN, ELIJAH DID THAT WHEN ON MOUNT CARMEL, THE FIRST THING HE TOLD THEM WAS COME NEAR. &gt;&gt; I mean, BEFORE HE DOES ANYTHING, HE HE, YOU KNOW, THE THE PROPHETS OF BAAL. AND AND SO SO PUT THIS IMAGE IN YOUR MIND NOW. HERE'S THE 400 PROPHETS OF BAAL. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN KILLED YET. HERE'S THEIR FAILED CHURCH SERVICE. THEY COULDN'T GET THE FIRE TO COME DOWN. AND ELIJAH'S GOING TO COME AND REBUILD THE ALTAR and call down the fire of God according to what God had told him. He only did what God told him to do. And the first thing he says is come near. Draw near. Now you now to IF HE'S SAYING DRAW NEAR TO ME, then he's saying move away from them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T DRAW NEAR TO GOD AND STAY NEAR THE WORLD. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. BROTHER BRANDHAM IN IN DEEP CALL IT TO THE DEEP. He'll say, "Uh, is this the patient?" Yeah. He says this. He says, "All right, come near sister." He says, "Now," and she steps forward. Now, that won't hurt you. See, that's just his presence. SO, SO YOU KNOW, WE WE CAN SEE this whole idea OF GOD IS TRYING TO BRING HIS REALITY. I MEAN, LISTEN FRIENDS, DO YOU REALIZE THAT THE MESSAGE IS NOT IT'S NOT JUST A A COLLECTION of books and tapes and quotes. You know, it's a person. &gt;&gt; You know, IT'S IT'S THE WORD TRYING TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU. I IT'S IT'S GOD [screaming] SENT THIS MESSAGE TO DRAW YOU NEAR TO HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Psalms Let's look at some OF THE EXAMPLES. PSALM 69, brother Kev. Uh, verses 15 to 18. Let not the water flood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, AND LET NOT THE PIT SHUT HER MOUTH upon me. HEAR ME, OH LORD, FOR THY LOVING KINDNESS is good. Turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies. HIDE NOT THY FACE from thy servant, for I am in trouble. Hear me speedily. Draw nigh unto my soul and redeem it. &gt;&gt; Draw nigh unto my soul &gt;&gt; and redeem it. Um Psalms 119, brother Kevin and verses 145. I'm going to catch some from the KJV and I'll catch some from the NLT and a couple from the AM. So you you'll read these first through uh with me, but I'll move quickly to other ones. Now Psalms 119 145 and 146 I 146 I cried with my whole heart. Hear me, oh Lord, I will keep thy statutes. I have cried unto thee, save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies. Verse 147 and 148 from the New Living Translation. I rise early before the sun is up. I CRY OUT FOR HELP AND PUT MY HOPE IN YOUR WORDS. I STAY AWAKE THROUGH THE NIGHT THINKING ABOUT YOUR PROMISE. Verses 149, 150, 151 FROM THE AMPLIFIED. HEAR MY VOICE ACCORDING TO YOUR STEADFAST LOVE, O LORD. Quicken me and give ME LIFE ACCORDING TO YOUR RIGHTEOUS DECREES. THEY DRAW NEAR WHO FOLLOW AFTER wrong thinking and persecute me with wickedness. THEY ARE FAR FROM YOUR LAW. YOU are near, O Lord, nearer to me THAN MY FOES, AND ALL YOUR COMMANDMENTS ARE TRUTH. YOU UNDERSTAND THE THE WORD PLAY ABOUT BEING FAR FROM GOD. IF YOU'RE FAR FROM GOD, YOU'RE NEAR THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE FAR FROM THE DEVIL, YOU'RE NEAR GOD. THERE'S ONLY TWO POWERS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, SO WE FIND THEN THAT GROWTH AND EASE ARE OPPOSITE in nature. Growth and ease &gt;&gt; are opposite &gt;&gt; in nature. Asking for one uh at least in a certain measure is a is a willingness to decline the other. I'll say it again. Growth, spiritual growth or ease. Asking for one &gt;&gt; in a certain measure is a willingness to decline the other. If I'm going to ask for growth, I've got to be willing to accept at least in a certain measure that I'm going to have less ease. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's not opposed completely to ease and the peace that passes understanding. But what what's what got you the ease? Was it moving away from God near the devil? It's not condemning comfort. It's just being honest about the tradeoff. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Amen. It's not condemning comfort. It's just being honest. And you need to be honest today about the tradeoff. You'll find that thread. It's it's woven all through the scriptures. You You know, you can you can think of Romans 5. Let's catch these, brother Kevin. Romans 5. You good? &gt;&gt; Romans 5 3:4. Tribulation workketh patience and patience experience and experience hope. So Paul IS SAYING, YOU KNOW, THAT THAT THAT SUFFERING IS LITERALLY the the crucible. It's literally the the forge. You all know what a forge is. And and and that these kinds of things that that SUFFERING IS LITERALLY THE FORGE WHERE character is made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, JAMES 1 2:4, COUNT IT ALL joy when ye shall fall into diverse temptations, KNOWING THIS THAT THE TRYING OF YOUR FAITH workketh patience. So, THE EASY LIFE, IF YOU'LL NOTICE, LET LET LET'S LET'S READ 2, THREE, and four in in their entirety. Go back to go back to verse two, my brethren. Now, I want you to I want you to notice what you're not going to hear. You're you're not going to hear anything about the easy life. &gt;&gt; It's going to be vacant. My brethren, count it all joy when you follow it fall into diverse temptations. Verse three, knowing this that the trying of your faith workketh patience. Verse four, but let patience, let it, allow it, permit it, &gt;&gt; because you might, you might decide not to. Let patience have her perfect work. You understand? She's working on you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Let patience have her perfect work that she that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. Oh my goodness. SO, WE NOTICE THAT THE EASY LIFE DOESN'T GET mentioned because the easy life teaches nothing. &gt;&gt; The easy life teaches nothing. That's why it's not in those verses. Hebrews 12 verse 11. Here's here's the Apostle Paul being very honest. He's going to say what we would be afraid to say, but Paul has said it, so we can say it. Hebrews 12:11. No chastening for the present seemth to be joyous. Oh my goodness. Did he say that out loud? He wrote in a book. &gt;&gt; NO CHASTENING FOR THE PRESENT SEEMTH TO BE JOYOUS, but grievous. Let's just BE REAL. LET'S BE HONEST. COME ON. LET'S BE HONEST. LET'S BE REAL. NO CHASTENING FOR THE PRESENT SEEMTH TO BE JOYOUS, BUT GRIEVOUS. NEVERTHELESS, EVEN IN SPITE OF, ALTHOUGH THAT'S TRUE, AFTERWARD, it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness. &gt;&gt; I'LL I'LL TAKE THAT KIND OF A PAYMENT PLAN. A LITTLE PAIN NOW FOR A LOT OF PEACE LATER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; First Peter 17. Faith. Now, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FAITH TRIED BY FIRE. 1 PETER 1:7. LET'S LET'S let's I want to read it together. It's a short verse. Catch it. We're gonna get there, brother Kev. &gt;&gt; All right, good deal. THAT THE TRIAL OF YOUR FAITH being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto the praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; SO, SO THEN, SO THEN REFINEMENT MEANS HEAT. &gt;&gt; And heat means discomfort. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Refinement means heat. &gt;&gt; Heat means discomfort. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; YOU CAN TRACE IT ALL THROUGH OTHER EXAMPLES OF THE BIBLE. THANK YOU, brother Kevin. Things we won't HAVE TIME. I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME. And I I don't want to I could take you to I could take us to Joseph and his years in prison. We could look at David in his exile. What? Not only from Saul, BUT THEN HIS OWN SON chasing him off the throne. Even Jesus in the wilderness. AND AND REALLY THEY IT WOULDN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU WERE STUDYING JOSEPH OR YOU'RE STUDYING DAVID OR YOU'RE STUDYING JESUS. THEY ALL SHOW YOU A PATTERN THAT THAT THE PRICE OF A GROUNDED SOUL IS A LIFE THAT HAS BEEN TESTED. &gt;&gt; So you can pray for God to make you strong. You can pray for God to make things easy. But not both at once. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I I couldn't help but think this and I jotted it down in my notes. I I could stand any one of you up here in front of me and I could talk about I could say, "Oh, I I see dark clouds ahead for you. I see some suffering and some loss and some pain." But then don't cry pilgrim because I also see on the other side of it you get through it and the sun starts shining and you're happy and you'd think I was a prophet and I'm not a prophet at all. I can just read my Bible. &gt;&gt; You understand? I don't have to be a prophet to do that. You don't have to be a prophet to realize that. You can just read your Bible. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? SO, SO GOD HAS USED THIS METHOD TO PURIFY his church for 2,000 YEARS. DON'T EXPECT HE'S GOING TO COME TO THE MOST IMPORTANT AGE, THE CONSUMMATION OF ALL THE AGES. &gt;&gt; To you people UPON WHOM THE ENDS OF THE WORLD HAVE come to you who ARE GOING TO BE THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE AND SUDDENLY MAKE IT EASIER. &gt;&gt; OH, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. YOU CAN GROW IN character and and and and or you CAN GROW IN COMFORT, BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT THE PRICE OF ONE IS THE LOSS OF THE OTHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You need to take that home with you today. YOU NEED TO NOT FORGET that that YOU CAN GROW IN CHARACTER OR YOU CAN STAY COMFORTABLE BUT THE PRICE OF ONE IS THE LOSS OF THE OTHER. Ease never builds character. EVERY VIRTUE PAUL PETER TALKS ABOUT THE SEVEN VIRTUES. WE START OUT WITH FAITH AND IT GOES UP TO VIRTUE AND GOES ON UP THROUGH TEMPERANCE and meekness and holiness and godliness and brotherly kindness and all these things. NONE OF THESE ARE THAT BY THESE YOU MAY BE A PARTAKER OF THE DIVINE NATURE AND ALL OF THESE THINGS WHEN THEY BUILD IT IN US WHEN THEY WHEN THEY BUILD THESE CHARACTERS IN US I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT EVERY ONE OF THOSE ELEMENTS COSTS a struggle &gt;&gt; SO IF YOU PRAY FOR STRENGTH HOW MANY PRAY for strength &gt;&gt; a third of you &gt;&gt; well you're like ultra men ultra come On how many pray for strength? My goodness, I pray for it every day. &gt;&gt; If you pray for strength, then expect resistance &gt;&gt; because you can't pray for strength and comfortable life in the same breath. &gt;&gt; See, you can pray for comfort. &gt;&gt; You can pray, Lord, comfort me in my loss. Comfort me. Encourage encourage my faith. But you can't pray for the for the Jesus said of John, what what you out to see? you know, a prophet. You did you see him in king's palaces and eating delicate foods? He said, "Not John. He was a man of the wilderness." And so, so we realize that that that that every prayer that we pray uh for character is a prayer for is you're praying for the days that test it. &gt;&gt; You and it has to be that way because ease and depth. I I read I READ THIS FROM A COMMENTARY. Ease and depth DON'T GROW IN THE SAME SOIL. I have no idea who said it, but as a commentary, I picked up on it AND PASTED INTO MY NOTES. Ease and depth don't grow in the same soil. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; We're talking about spiritual depth. Spiritual real spiritual depth and ease don't grow in the same soil. &gt;&gt; You understand? AND AND AND SO TH THIS IS EXACTLY WHY AND AND LET ME SAY TO YOU THIS TO THE TO THIS FRIENDS I DON'T WANT TO FORGET IT THAT WHEN WE PRAY FOR STRENGTH THEN I'M I'M SAYING TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO EXPECT RESISTANCE BUT PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THE RESISTANCE IS THE ANSWER NOT THE OBSTACLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE RESISTANCE IS NOT THE OBSTACLE. IT'S GOD ANSWERING YOUR PRAYER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I SAID TO YOU LAST WEEKEND, WE talked about and I I closed out and I'm going to close out with this today. We found that WE FOUND SATAN. WE FOUND LUCIFER, you know, and taking one, you know, he's he's got his name. His name is Lucifer, but he's the devil. That old serpent and the devil, you know, and he Yeah. Because he takes titles just like God takes titles. And so, you know, he's he's Lucifer before the fall. He's like he's attributed as the serpent, you know, in the fall and and then he's then he's the devil. And then when he comes into the because, you know, the devil is fighting against Job. And then when he comes to the Gospels, he what is he? He takes Jesus in the wilderness. And what is he? He's a tempter. See, he's an oppressor, the apostle calls him. And then in the BOOK OF REVELATION, HE'S CALLED A DRAGON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So he takes titles JUST LIKE GOD DOES. DEPENDS ON DEPENDS ON THE AGE and what's GOING ON AT THAT TIME. IT'S ALL THE SAME PERSON. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL THE ARCHANGEL, THE FORMER ARCHANGEL LUCIFER WHO STOOD BY THE THRONE. AND WE SAID THIS LAST TIME. IT DIDN'T OCCUR to him when he WAS, YOU KNOW, CONCOCTING HIS PLAN UH THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE LIKE GOD AND HE WAS GOING TO LIVE IN THE NORTH AND TAKE THE THRONE AND BE ABOVE THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD, BE ABOVE THE STARS. AND WE WE FOUND OUT THAT ALL THE WHILE HE'S GOT SIGNS OF REDEMPTION ALL AROUND HIM. AND HE'S STANDING BESIDE OF A THRONE THAT THAT DAVID SAID WAS ESTABLISHED IN MERCY. IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE THRONE IS ESTABLISHED IN MERCY. AND I WAS SAYING TO YOU LAST TIME AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NOTHING NEEDING REDEEMED. THERE WAS NO USE FOR MERCY BUT IT BUT GOD HAD IT IN HIS PLAN JUST LIKE WHEN HE SAID TO ADAM AND EVE IN IN GENESIS 1 26 27 28 29 YOU'RE YOU GOT TO BE FRUITFUL. YOU GOT TO MULTIPLY. BROTHER BRANDHAM TAUGHT US THAT THE ONLY WAY SOMETHING COULD MULTIPLY IS SOMETHING HAD TO DIE. AND SO EVEN BEFORE THE FALL, GOD ALREADY KNOWS THERE'S GOING TO BE A FALL. HE ALREADY KNOWS THERE'S GOING TO BE A REDEEMER. AND LUCIFER IS STANDING THERE BESIDE OF A THRONE WITH MERCY AND SIGNS OF REDEMPTION EVERYWHERE. AND IT DOESN'T OCCUR TO HIM THAT EVEN IF HE DOES GET THE UPPER HAND ON GOD'S FAMILY, GOD WON'T LEAVE THEM THERE. THAT HE'S GOT A THRONE TO UNDO WHATEVER SATAN HAS DONE IN YOUR LIFE AND HAS DONE IN MY LIFE. THERE IS NO THAT'S WHY THERE'S NO WEAPON FORMED AGAINST YOU THAT CAN PROSPER BECAUSE HIS THRONE IS ESTABLISHED IN MERCY. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HE WOULD EVER DO TO GOD'S CHILDREN. GOD RICH IN MERCY WOULD REDEEM THEM FROM IT. &gt;&gt; THE CHOICE COMES DOWN TODAY TO THIS FRIENDS AND I'LL CLOSE WITH THIS. THE CHOICE REALLY COMES DOWN TO THIS IS THAT GOD IS LOOKING FOR DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH. HE'S LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO WILL WHO WILL BE WHO WILL BE, YOU KNOW, LIKE LIKE LIKE LIKE JESUS WAS ON THE SEA OF GALILEE. YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID? HE CAST OUT DEVILS. SAY, "OH, HE CALMED THE WINDS IN THE RAIN." He did, but we had a little bit of prophetic inner inner insider trading knowledge. &gt;&gt; We had a prophet that said, "Well, see what was happening was there was a devil on every wave trying to drown him." See, so brother Brandon, so Jesus, when he's SAYING, "PEACE, BE STILL," HE'S NOT TREATING the symptom. He's going after the cause. &gt;&gt; He That's what the gospel does. The gospel is not interested in treating your symptoms. The gospel is here TO CAST OUT DEVILS. YOU'LL HAVE PEACE AND SAFETY IN YOUR LIFE IF THE GOSPEL CAN CAST OUT ALL THE DEVILS FROM YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, LISTEN. ARE YOU YOU GOOD? I'M I'M ALMOST FINISHED PREACHING, BUT LET ME JUST GIVE YOU MY HEART. SO, here's brother Brandham in the wilderness and a terrible storm is coming. AND AND WE KNOW BY INSIDER INTEL, BY PROPHETIC intel that when you see those hurricanes and tornadoes AND THOSE GREAT STORMS, BROTHER RANDOM SAID, "SEE, that's a collection of demons. &gt;&gt; They go about to kill, destroy. See, they hate God and all of his creation." And and he says, "See, that's a that's a collection of demons that do that. That's why when we pray, we know what we're praying for. I'm not praying I don't need to pray that God will keep those winds from blowing my house over. I'm praying that God will rebuke the devil and that these things won't come nigh unto us. See, because we are God's family. AMEN. SO, SO NOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM, HE'S HUSTLING TO GET BACK TO CAMP. And he said, "Sleet is hitting me in the face and it's getting dark." And he said, "THOSE THINGS COME IN LIKE THAT." And he said, "I'm running back down TO GET BACK TO CAMP." AND HE SAYS, THE HOLY SPIRIT SAYS, "STOP. TURN AROUND. GO BACK TO" AND HE SAYS, "Go back." There's a prophet, A HUMAN. GO BACK INTO THAT DARK THAT DARKNESS. OKAY. OKAY. I I don't get it. Looks like I'm about to go kill myself, but I'm going TO GO WHAT YOU SAID. And he stands on there with wind and sleep and storms and demons. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. And God says, "Speak to the storm." WHAT IS HE DOING? HE'S ISSUING THE WORD BECAUSE WHAT WAS THE PROMISE OF THE WORD? THAT IF YOU SAY TO THIS MOUNTAIN, IT'LL BE THE MIND OF GOD OPERATING IN YOU. THAT'S THE THIRD PULL. THAT WAS PART OF THE THIRD PULL. SPEAK TO THE STORM. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "I SAY THAT THIS STORM MUST GO BACK AND THE SUN MUST COME OUT AND SHINE." HALLELUJAH. GOD IS LOOKING FOR YOU AND I TODAY TO TAKE THE WORD OF GOD AND PUT IT ON OUR LIPS AND SAY, "I DRIVE OUT EVERY DEMON. I DRIVE OUT EVERY DARKNESS. I I TAKE AUTHORITY OVER MY HOME, OVER OUR CHURCH, OVER MY FAMILY AND MY CHILDREN." &gt;&gt; AND I AM NOT SUBJECT TO HIM. HE IS SUBJECT TO ME. &gt;&gt; OH MY. THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHY DAVID SAID, "BLESSED IS THE MAN UH CHILDREN ARE THE HERITAGE OF THE LORD. BLESSED IS THE MAN THAT HATH HIS QUIVER FULL OF THEM. THEY SHALL CONTEND WITH THE WITH THE ACCUSERS IN THE GATE. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO GO TO THE COURTROOM BECAUSE THE FATHER HAS BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED. HE'S BEEN CALLED A LIAR AND A TRAITOR AND A BLASPHEMER AND A CULT LEADER. BUT THERE ARE CHILDREN THE THE FATHER DOESN'T HAVE TO ANSWER. HE DOESN'T HAVE TO DEFEND HIMSELF BECAUSE CHILDREN WILL WALK TO THE COURTROOM AND SAY, "LOOK AT MY LIFE AND LOOK AT HIS LIFE AND LOOK AT HER LIFE." AND WE ARE PROOF THAT OUR FATHER RAISED US CORRECTLY. WE ARE PROOF. WE ARE LIVING TESTIMONY. AND THAT'S WHAT GOD IS LOOKING AT IN THIS SATAN'S EDEN WITH SATAN, I'M HERE TO TELL THE DEVIL, YOU WILL NEVER ASCEND TO THE THRONE. NOT ON MY WATCH. YOU WILL NEVER BE ABOVE THE STARS OF HEAVEN. NOT ON MY WATCH. YOU WILL NEVER LIVE IN THE NORTH. YOU WILL NEVER YOU'LL NEVER BE LIKE [screaming] GOD.
