specials and all the worship this morning wonderful to come just into such an atmosphere of the presence of the Lord we just want to give give ourselves completely to him that he would move and work in every life here um greetings to our visitors today God bless you God bless you all appreciate you being here number of people are away traveling to various different places want to remember them all in prayer for traveling mercies brother Matt has been up preaching a youth camp in Edmonton and I've heard some wonderful reports from the Believers up there that the Lord is moving in a mighty way amongst the young people also brother Jason and sister Debbie are in Arizona remember the service there in prayer and remember them uh in your prayers for traveling mercies also just want to ask everyone to keep me in prayer as well I'll be going on a missions trip to the Middle East um from March 6th to the 24th so pray for me pray for my family as well and we just want to go to the Lord amen Heavenly Father father we just come to you in the name of Jesus Christ we ask that your Holy Spirit would come and move amongst us in a supernatural way Lord we just want to lay ourselves aside

that end We Gather Lord to be molded and shaped by the word into the Lord Jesus Christ we commit ourselves and commit the service into your name and into your hands the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you Gideon if you want to bring up the power point I spent the night uh the the evening last night in prayer seeking the Lord and you know sometimes you have a message burning in your heart all week you can't wait to get in the study and sometimes you spend four or five hours just praying to get through to the Lord for a thought and you think better come soon Lord I ain't going to be there'll be no sleep tonight be no rest tonight but he always he always makes a way it just came came just in a Just one thought I didn't even know the direction really that it would go or what Vision I just had the thought come to my mind strengthen the feeble needes amen and so we're going to look and turn to Hebrews chap 12 and verses 12 and 13 we're going to return back to this frequently through the through the service wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed amen may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated of course as we read this we see the scripture says starts with wherefore means on a because of and so then we know that this is connected to the previous thought that came forward which is was about the Lord's correction and we'll read that starting at verse 5 and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth so we understand that not all things that we go through we think it's because God's angry with us right we take this approach this has happened because God's angry with us I don't want to get ahead of myself but I'm going to lay that here is that's the wrong way to think the wrong way to look at it and we'll we'll I'll leave that there we think that but that's not right verse 7 if you endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not well we live in a day that if you chasing your children you not in South Carolina but in many states you'll wind up in jail you'll wind up having your children taken away from you can you imagine that's the society that we live in we have so departed from anything that's true and foundational and right into total Madness as I think about this you know some things have totally colored the way we look at everything how what is that feminism has colored the way we look at everything and a real man being a man is considered a horrible thing and he shouldn't be manly or Express manhood that's totally against the word of God that's totally against God's vision for family and home this the other part feminism has colored our our minds the other part that's colored our minds is modern psychology everyone has become a pop psychologist this happened because of this thing in my life and this I do this because of this okay but you're responsible for your own actions it may have happened because of that but everyone has an excuse for how they behave because Mom was this and dad was that and grandfather and this and that we know that God visits the sins of the fathers unto the children to many generations but then we've taken this and the scripture says and condemns this thought is the fathers eat sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge and God says everyone will die for his own sins so to get that idea in this pop psychology World well this explains a lot it helps me to understand because my dad was this and was that that's TR that might be true it might not be true to it might simply because you're making excuses for yourself and you're not going according to the word of God you're going to answer for what God says God provides the means for healing for deliverance for wholeness you can't just sit there and say my dad my mom Grandpa and then expect to get away with that excuse God Is A Healer God is a deliverer the gospel comes to change us not to leave us in the place blaming something on something hap that happened in the past but that's pop psychology and even even if you examine it closely much of our pop psychology that we see that's accepted in the world even psychologists say it's nonsense which psychologist psychology is all based on Marxism and uh uh modernistic feminism and so we we have to understand God deals with you as with a son when you're being chastened now we we see that and we read that we can't imagine how that could be if God loves us he he just Pats us and babies us and and does everything nice for us no he's raising children to be mature sons and therefore he corrects us he spanks us spare the rod and spoil the child so God spanks us I remember uh Amy always telling the girls we don't get physical spankings anymore like you you're getting uh when they were younger and but God still deals with us and gives us spankings amen and that's his love because if you're without chastisement where of all our partakers then are you bastards and not Sons can I just say this we're filled with a world and America of bastards yeah they live and act like bastards even if they're even if they have their father around they're acting like a bunch of bastards why because they have no correction and they cannot stand chastisement if they're corrected they will let you know I do I never need to be corrected thank you I am always right and I always look at everything right and I always see everything right you're a fool that's what you are that's right furthermore verse 9 we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live my for they verily for a few days chasen us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chastening for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby all right so we see that God brings to correction to us in our lives and the corre correction that he's bringing to us actually could cause us to faint the Bible says don't faint when you're corrected but it it there is that he's he's saying that because there is that possibility that we would faint because we see the circumstances and we apply the wrong thing to the circumstances and it leads us to look at it differently and we I give up I can't go on he says don't do that the correction is described as something that does not seem joyous but rather Grievous the NLT says no discipline is enjoyable while it's happening it's painful so I want to come back to what the discipline is to produce because that's what the scripture says there but first I want to look more at this painful Grievous correction that God gives to us out of love I think brother Caleb really if you listen to the Sunday school if you didn't go listen to it he laid the foundation for today's message I love when the Lord puts that together you know in the denominational World they get together with meetings and all the Sunday School people and everyone coordinates with the pastor what they're going to talk about we don't have to do that we just coordinate with the Holy Spirit and he works everything else out not that there would be anything wrong with coordinating that but simply just to say the grace of the Lord you see when he directs us uh psalm there we go get caught up there Psalms 118 Verse 18 the Lord hath chastened me sore but he hath not given me over unto death so the Lord can chasen a sore some and sometimes he does and again I before I go forward I want to make this statement is that two things things one is when you look when you preach about this everyone starts to get nervous and think the preacher is going to point out that I'm going through what I went through because of the sin in my life the preacher is not going to do that today the preacher is just going to preach the word right the word applies we don't want to be so soft soaped that we think we have to be padded and babied say we go we go we all go through things because of of the sins that we commit and God is correcting us because of that we'll look at that more but I also want you to understand is sometimes it's just a tri predestinated trial that you're supposed to go through but even in that situation God is beating off the dross he's beating off the Flesh and the attributes of the flesh that you still have in your life he's doing that and so when he's chastening us sore know that that's his love amen Psalm 119 verse 67 before I was afflicted I went astray but now have I kept Thy word h Affliction comes and it causes us to know I need to I need to stay and stand by the word I need to to go with what God says not with what I think what I want to do because ultimately what what why did the Affliction come you were going astray so is that God's hatred for you does that mean God's angry with you that means he loves you because you're going astray and he's going to keep you in the way Psalm 11971 it is good for me that I have been Afflicted that I that I might learn thy statutes now there's really no there's no other way it's through the preaching of the word we learn this the word of God the statutes but it's also through the afflictions that we face in our life you're not going to learn any other way it's when the word God gives you a promise let's just simplify it God gives you a promise he never under any circumstances even in Paradise gives you a promise and a commandment and doesn't put some kind of trial in the way to test whether you believe that word or not even in the Garden of Eden where it was perfect God tested whether they believed the promise whether they would follow the word and so anytime God gives you the word trials will come if you don't obey that word afflictions come so either way you're going to get trials and get get Affliction you say that's not fair that's not right I'm just telling quoting you to what the word says this is the life this is the experience of the Life of Christ and we'll never know him until that word is tested in us we know him in the power of His Resurrection The Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death so it doesn't just say knowing him in the power of his resurrection we'd all be happy and thankful if that's all that there was but it continues on and it says that in the we know him in the fellowship of his sufferings so when we are facing afflictions we're facing trials that is the place that we know him more now this is where the problem comes in in our minds and in our understanding is that we value comfort more than we value knowing god that's the problem we want to be babied we want to be padded we want it to be simple we want it to be easy and it's just not that way that is not what God has ordained for this life he's not made it so that you would be babied he's made it so that you would be a reflection of Christ now if you just want to go the way of the world and follow follow the devil and the world have it your way but the the path of knowing god is the path of Trials and affliction because he loves you he has an end in sight for you his love isn't simply oh I just pour out the blessings and the money fills your bank account and you drive the best cars I mean that's what the the charismatic movement would have you to believe but it's false Doctrine it's a lie God provides God meets your needs but sometimes God takes you through terrible and horrible things he might take you through losing everything but what will you gain everything the real thing what is the real thing knowing him loving him there's nothing better than that and so when we get we struggle is because we're looking we're valuing something that's wrong we're valuing something outside of God Psalms 1821 for I have kept the ways of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God okay David you haven't wickedly departed from your god I've got some stories to tell okay so what is he saying so what is he saying here what is David saying is David David didn't just simply leave God behind he didn't say you know what I don't believe this anymore I don't he he sinned absolutely but he didn't wickedly depart from God as in he says I don't believe it I don't accept it when he was confront he made a horrible mistake I mean it's beyond measure the Bible ordains death for him double death he he achieved the death penalty twice in one case and God pardoned his sin and forgave him but he didn't wickedly depart from God he he made a horrible mistake but he didn't lose his faith he simply sinned against God see and so when we're talking about this Affliction this trial these things that we're going through we're not talking about someone that's just walked away from God but someone who through the weakness of the Flesh and the infirmities of the mind we go astray we sin each one of us does that as long as we're here in this flesh we are going to sin it's not until this is a new body now he's growing us and there should be a pro procession of growth in our life but we're never going to achieve sinlessness until this body is changed to be like an unto Jesus glorious body 1 John chapter 1 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us we all we all sin and I think the closer you are in your walk with the Lord the greater awareness you have of your your own weakness and your own sin but thank God there is a remedy if we walk in the light as he is in the light he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness through that blood we are changed and transformed amen so God uses afflictions and trials to lovingly correct us they're painful they're Grievous they're not pleasant for the moment but I want to I want to talk about this I want to look at job as an example I want you to understand when I'm when I'm speaking of this I'm not trying to paint every Affliction and trial that you're going through it's because it's because you've sined you better figure it out you want to we want to live in Grace right we want to understand understand the grace of God and too often we get so tied up in this idea that if I'm if I'm living like this I'm not going to make it well if you're living like that as an expression of who you are on the inside of the inside if you're living wrong from that then you're not going to make it but if you've made a mistake if you're walking with God you love the Lord you've made a mistake you can't be in this position where you're constantly wondering do I have the Holy Ghost do I did I make it did I do this you can't you can never have rest and you can never have peace in your heart if you're constantly wondering well to today I was real good I'll make the Rapture if it happens today but to yesterday if it happened yesterday I wasn't going to make it because I was in the middle of being rude to my family or whatever whatever it might might have been I wasn't in the right you're not ever going to make it by your own works by your own achievements by being good you're not going to good yourself into the Rapture that's what the blood of Jesus Christ is for it cleanses us but the evidence of being cleansed by the blood is that he is changing and transforming us and you're not satisfied with staying in the condition of worldliness and sin you hate it you don't want it and you're seeking God and saying God take this from me that's that's what he's doing in us and we can look to Jo as an example he thought his trial came unjustly because I've done everything that I'm supposed to do so God must be unjust in this no you don't understand job trials don't just come because you've sinned Trials come because God wants to mature us that was job's job La was lacking in Revelation that even the perfect sinless Messiah had to be tried through suffering and had to be made perfect through suffering so no it wasn't it wasn't your sin job it was simply that God was trying you that God had a purpose he wanted to two things he wanted to prove himself to Satan through job and secondly he wanted to bring job to maturity through suffering and we find that woven all throughout the Book of Job there's both of them are understanding God in such a simplistic way if things are easy then you did right if things are bad then you did wrong this is the this is the mentality we still have many times and we're here we're listening to the seventh Church age messenger preach the the sovereignty of God and salvation and the power of God and the what justification really means and we're still thinking this if things are going going bad for me it's because I'm a secret sinner if things are going good for me it's because I'm doing right this is this is just natural for man to look at things and think of things this way but the Bible says no that's not true that's not accurate and until we find our rest in the fact that the things that we're going through are are to mature us and to get us closer to Christ we'll continually to be relying on our own works you'll never be saved by relying on your own Works how can you think well I I felt a good anointing at the service today I'm right with God but I felt nothing the the next day so I'm not right with God stop looking at the outward where is your faith do you believe God's word am do you believe that you're not saved by coming to the Altar and a minister laying his hands on you that's never what salvation Ever Was supposed to be God can use all these things as a means but Salvation is not by the altar call Salvation is by faith alone in Christ alone whatever outward display we have God deals with us differently he dealt with me in a car all by myself deals with some people coming to the altar deals with some people right in your chair some everybody is different how he deals with but it's the same thing that he saves Us by and that's Faith amen stop this immature nonsense of thinking things are bad I'm I did bad well that might be true he might be correcting you but the fact is if you un if you really understand your condition before God then you're actually going to understand he's trying to make us like Christ whether it's my sin or whether it's a predestinated trial let's get closer to Christ you don't well I got to figure out what sin it is do you know that God gave you the Holy Spirit and he's obligated to correct you that verse we just read we look at it from our perspective saying well God corrects us and it's really hard and it's very difficult but from God's perspective it means there's a actual promise connected that if you're a son he will chastise you he will correct you because what what what is this ultimately connected to is that the shepherd will not lose one sheep he he that's what he said I will not lose one you can read it I think it's John chapter 10 not one sheep will be lost so he's going to do what it takes to make sure the Sheep gets there in the condition that he wants it to get there and so he'll correct the Sheep he'll he'll he'll he'll give him healing ointment he'll bring him to food he'll do whatever it takes no matter how how difficult how hard the circumstances are for him he's going to do it no matter how difficult you make it for him let's put it that way he is going to come after you and he is going to get you because it would be a shame to the shepherd to lose a sheep so he's not going to lose you so if you find if you're dealing with chastisement then praise God he's dealing with you as Sons what was job's answer ultimately what was job's answer God does what he wants to that's that's the that's the final answer job so you say why did this happen to me God does what he wants to and he he knows how to produce the the right effect in his sheep to make them mature right he's bringing us to maturity he's perfecting us and so he's going to bring those circumstances upon you to accomplish those purposes why did he do this why did this happen y'all I don't know I barely have my own stuff figured out I don't know what I'm doing I'm all I know is one thing is I'm holding God's hand amen and I believe he's leading me that's what's important that's the most important thing as I said before Jesus suffered in order for him to be brought to maturity and it was certainly not because of the sins that he had done at the same time we spoke of David David suffered badly in his life before he became King when he was unworthy really of the suffering he suffered why because God was using that to bring him to maturity so that when he would become king he would be the kind of King that God wanted him to be but then later in in life the sword was never to depart from his home because he sinned in the matter of Uriah the hittite that was reaping what he sowed you're going to reap what you sowed right that's not that's simply a principle that God has put in place you say well God's angry with me because no you just are reaping what you sowed that doesn't mean God's angry with you if you have confessed your sin he's faithful and just to forgive your sin and to cleanse you from all unrighteousness that that's repentance you've repented you've turned away from it you've asked him to cleanse you it's in the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered no more but you'll still have consequences for our we have consequences for the things that we do and there's there's other examples of people suffering unjustly and doing it and submitting themselves to God and God accomplishing a great purpose the Apostle Paul he he suffered from something he asked God to deliver him from it three times and God said my power this is given to you keep you humble because my power is made perfect in weakness and so again God has all I'm not here to stand and say I can tell you all the plans and purposes and everything that you're going through God's doing this and go I can't do that I could lay out to you what the scripture says it's up to God to show you and sometimes he'll just say trust me but God I want to know why do you trust me that's what he ask us to do go through this and trust me and know that I have a purpose cuz cuz job sat there argued with his buddies back and forth they argued and argued and everybody had the right point and at the end who came and made the final statement I'm he he said I'm God I do what I want to basically that's that's the summary of all that he said I can do exactly what I want to and you have nothing to say about it that's Faith that's trust because we know the character of God we know that he's doing something we know his promises we know what he says and so we can just grab hold and move forward second Corinthians chapter 7 verse 9 now I Rejoice not that you were made sorry but that you sorrowed to repentance for you were made sorry after a Godly manner that you might receive damage by us in nothing verse 10 for Godly sorrow worketh repentance to Salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world Works death verse 11 behold the selfsame thing that you sorrowed after a Godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yay what clearing of yourselves yay what indignation yay What Fear yay what vehement desire yay what Zeal yay what revenge in all things you have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter so there is correction that God brings that leads to sorrow and that's supposed to lead to repentance right God is that's his love he's bringing a spanking it hurts and you're supposed to repent other this otherwise the spanking just keeps coming you repent you turn to God and you walk forward right it's a great blessing from God that he deals with us this way it means that he's trying to produce himself in us and again none of these things are to be considered God the wrath of God upon his children the wrath of God never comes upon his children because Christ himself took the wrath upon himself Christ took our sins upon himself and he was punished by God's anger in our place so as far as we're concerned God's anger is done it's finished when Christ said it's finished on the cross it was finished he took your place you don't have to experience God's Wrath you say well how do I know the difference between God's corrective love and God wanting to prove something through my life that's difficult to answer God will deal with you God will show you if he's wanting to correct you with something I'm I'm pretty sure I'm well acquainted with stuffing sin and not not wanting to make it right and God putting his thumb on me and making it known the way he wants to make it known and me having to to make those things right I'm pretty sure if you're a Son of God if you're a daughter of God you're probably acquainted with that so God has your number he knows where you live he knows where you're at and he will deal with you and he will correct you instead of holding on to that and trying to just let go God will deal with you there's no sin too great that God can't heal and God can't deliver obviously there's consequences for what we do but yet we know that God heals God delivers God forgives how do we know the difference well God is dealing with you to make you like Jesus Christ just like we said said either by correction or by trials if you're confused don't ask me ask God because he wants to lead you he wants to deal with you you need to know him in that way that you know what he's dealing with you about get alone go in go off in the woods go somewhere get alone with God and let him deal with you let him speak with you you know you hear about brother brandham having to get away he he has a heavy feeling something is is not right he he gets away to the woods or he gets away to a place where he can pray why aren't you why aren't we doing that take the time if that heavy feeling comes God's trying to speak something to you well go and listen let him speak seek him and he'll find him well I'm afraid God know no longer loves me due to the circumstances of my life or some painful thing I experienced you've not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin you know what that means you haven't given your your life you haven't died in your fight against sin yet Christ did in his battle against sin he died we're all given a path by God to walk and we're all given crosses to bear we don't understand why we're going through what we're going through that sometimes it's supposed to be that way so that you walk by faith and not by sight sman Church age chapter 4 brother brandham says you see they could not figure out God's love here we can read along together yeah you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen un unto salvation because because God hath chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth it's not circumstances that you're saved by it's not thinking that you're blessed by God it's not feeling an anointing that you're saved by you're saved by faith do you believe that Jesus Christ died for your sins that he's given you the holy spirit it's through faith that you're saved so my circumstance you don't understand my circumstances I might not but somebody else might but whether I understand the circumstances or not I do understand God's word and God's word declares it's not by your situation do you know that you he loves you but that it's by the word that you know that he loves you he has said it you receive it that settles it that's what faith is the approach to God 1955 brother brandham says he wants us to if the Earthly parents wants us to do well what about our Heavenly parent the Lord Jesus he has to correct us and the scripture says if we cannot stand CH chastisement or a whipping child correction then we become illegitimate children and not the children of God see if you're really born again get it now if you're really born again there's nothing can separate you from God that's right neither starvation perils trials suffering death nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus you see how we connected that together regardless even if it is correction over your sin in your life that's between you and God that's not and and and and again based on experience I've seen churches I've seen pastors this doesn't happen here but it happens it has happened where something horrific happens in someone's life and that pastor says see you weren't respecting the church you weren't doing this this happened because of that what a reproach and it's caused people to to walk away from everything because they thought God hated me because of this happened that's not the truth right it's not God's anger cuz there's nothing can separate you from the love of God in Christ Jesus No Angel no devil no preacher no nothing and that has to be your experience and you have to say no matter what anybody says I don't care if the whole world turns against me I don't care if my pastor turns against me and the whole church kicks me out God's word is true if everybody turns against the message I'm going to stand with the word that has to be your conviction you're not doing this because of what so and so is doing so and so this one over here if brother Jack stays faithful I'm going to stay faithful no we we believe God Trials Come whether it's for correction or for a simply a trial nothing will separate you from the love of God even that trial in itself we know for a fact it's the love of God when well it's because I sinned it's the love of God well it's not it's because I because he's just giving me a trial to mature me it's the love of God either way you have to understand that what is coming to you is God's love to make you more like Jesus Christ to conform you to him and to prevent you from going in a direction that you shouldn't go sometimes we get to a thing and we we we have 10 different leadings from the the Lord I must do this I must do that I have to go there and it sometimes you feel like am I schizophrenic what's going on Lord I want to know what you want me to do what does he say to do is simple brother brandham tells us and it it's just the most incredible truth that I've ever I've ever read in my life to be honest with you about how to find the leading of the Lord brother Bram says you you lay yourself aside you pray you ask God you get yourself neutral about it then when you get yourself neutral what what direction should I go Lord you get yourself neutral if the L he said sometimes the Lord will deal with by visions well not me that's how brother Bram was dealt with he said not everybody's that way but as you're praying sometimes you're leaning towards that you're leaning towards that but when you get there he said wait on the Lord and wait and then wait and wait right because it's in the waiting where the Lord will correct us and redirect us but when you've waited on him you've prayed you've got yourself neutral you're leaning towards a direction brother Bram says if you start going towards the direction because you've done what you know you're supposed to do God is obligated to correct you to stop you from going the wrong direction and so what he'll do is he'll s trials he'll send afflictions he'll send a hedge of thorns to direct you back to the way that you're supposed to go either way it's the love of God do you see what I'm saying if we're if we're seeking him he's we're going to go through trials if we're not seeking him he's going to correct us with trials so either way what are we going to do we're going to be more like Jesus Christ in the approach to God 1955 say brother brandom I'm a Christian and I got a sickness now I wonder why it come God may be purging you amen give you some trials make you draw a little closer to him pray a while then heal you that you can have a testimony amen Romans 5 verse 2 by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashame because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us so we see again there's a there is a procedure that the Bible has for getting you to this place where the love of God is shed abroad in your hearts there's a there's a process that God takes you through through trials through tribulations tribulations produce what patience what does p patience produce experience in other words it furthers your experience with God you know God more intimately you know if if if life is just easy for you how much do you really know God how much do you understand who he is not much but as you go through life as you struggle as you go through trials and afflictions you know him more and more and that's where your experience increases and that's where your hope then increases now hope doesn't mean a wish in the Bible hope means an Earnest expectation amen and it's directly connected with faith faith hope and love right so there's there's an Earnest expectation of what that God is going to do what he said he will do he has a promise for you you hold on to that no matter what no matter what circumstances no matter how long it takes you hold on why because God said so that settles it but I want you to think about this I I think too so many times we think about trials and we think about afflictions and we think about it wrong we think about it about how y'all are looking right now man this guy's preaching on trials and afflictions wouldn't you shut up about that well you're living it and I'm living it I want to preach where you're at because this is where I'm at the Holy Ghost dispensation we're actually called higher than job we're not called to argue with our friends about why we're going through what we're going through or argue with ourselves about why we're going through what we're going through we're called much higher 1 Peter 412 and 13 beloved think it not strange concerning the fely fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you aren't we we're always shocked something difficult's happen and we're just under a shock how could this happen Peter says don't do that don't think it's true strange but Rejoice see that's the that's the higher calling that we have under the Holy Ghost dispensation we're not called under job's dispensation to argue about it we're called to rejoice in it what a difference rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding Joy amen 2 Corinthians 1:7 and our hope of you is steadfast knowing that as you are partakers of the suffering so shall you also of the consolation if you're a partaker of suffering you can automatically say hallelujah I'm going to be a partaker of the consolation because why because God said so God promised I will receive Comfort am James 1 2-4 dear brothers and sisters when Troubles of any kind come your way consider an opportunity for great joy for you know that when your faith is tested your endurance has a chance to grow so let it grow for when your endurance is fully developed you will be perfect and complete needing nothing see this is the end that's what God is leading us to that's what tribulations and troubles that come our way there for a purpose we can know as Christians this is for a purpose this is not meaningless what I'm going through God is working something in me for his eternal purposes whether it merely be a in this life that he's making us more like Jesus Christ or he actually could be creating a crown for us in that new body if we pass this trial if we pass this Affliction it will cause us not only to grow in this life but it'll produce a reward in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus there's absolutely I want to start to turn a corner there's absolutely no such thing as a true perfected faith that would come without trials afflictions difficulties broken hearts tears and pain we are ordained to go through such I don't think we need to to go into the scriptures on that it's so clear we're ordained to go through trials and tribulations and sufferings the devil is against us the world is against us they hate the word of God and they're battling against it because you're living by the word by by default the devil and the world is against you we're ordained to grow through these things but God takes them and harnesses them to use them to mold you and shape you so that you would become strong it's not God's Wrath against you it's his love to ensure that you come out like Jesus Christ now let's look at those verses we read before no chastening for the present when you're going through it it's not joyful right it's painful yeah but actually there should be something according to the scripture there should be something down further than on the outside on the inside of the inside that there would be a joyfulness raise up now you say I'm not there yet I'm probably not there yet either but guess what I believe that God is bringing us to this that when we go through trials and afflictions that it goes from being drudger to being joyful do we say we thank God for the promise instead of looking oh my it's horrible what I don't know what to do we look ahead to the promise of consolation and deliverance instead of focusing on the problem if you look ahead to The Promise You Can Be Joyful if you focused on the circumstance it's it's just painful and it's not it's Grievous but we're called higher amen I believe he's training us to go higher so that there's this joy in the it's not because we're masochists we don't want to go through the bad thing the the hard things the trials but we know that we're looking at a promise and so we can Rejoice I think most of the problems fall away when we can look to the promise and rejoice instead of just focusing on I have this problem I have this trial most of the trouble is in our the battle is in our mind to stay in perfect peace because why the devil wants us to worry about and try to fix our circumstances instead of looking to God trusting in Him and let him resolve the circumstances I want to look at this in the NLT as we kind of turn the the corner towards closing just turning the corner I'm not saying I'm closing very soon we're just turning the corner in that direction I'm not going to be like brother digs you know he starts and preaches 5 minutes he says don't get scared I'm about fixing the clothes well an hour later he still hasn't closed and we appreciate that he's not because we wouldn't be happy if he preached just for 10 minutes all right so Paul writing to the Hebrews says so take a new grip with your tired hands and strengthen your weak knees Mark out a straight path for your feet so that those who are weak and lame will not fall but become strong so in all of this we understand that this correction because this this this is the verses preceding God's correction right so God has God has corrected us so God is trying to accomplish a purpose what purpose so that we would become strong I get this picture in my head I don't know if you've all have seen this but there's this uh this little German advertisement where an old grandfather he starts out he's so weak and through the year he begins to lift up this kettle bell and he's just taken the kettle bell and he's lifted it up and everybody's like what's this crazy old man doing he's doing it no matter what rain shine no matter what he's doing it but little by little he's doing this and he's becoming stronger and becoming stronger and at the end then he's able to lift his granddaughter up so she could put the star on top of the Christmas tree but the point being is that's the picture I'm getting in his mind you're in a condition this this is saying feeble knees we weak grip so think of that you've you've come to this this condition in your walk with the Lord where your knees are feeble that's not where the Lord wants you to be he wants you to be at the end he wants you to become strong so what it's going to do he says take a new grip your hands might be weak but start taking a grip strengthen your knees how do you do that just you have to make a flat path and start walking that's what you have to do make that path straight and just start walking and what will happen you'll get strong that's God's purpose your faith muscles might be weak you might be in a place where every circumstance every trial that comes your way you're questioning everything and you're wondering what's the purpose behind this why is there why is this happening I'm saying right now you can take this opportunity to take a grip take a new grip grab a hold of the word of God start walking you don't H you don't have to live in in this constant worry about your circumstances you can change the circumstance you can change where your faith is it just takes a little step take one step today take two tomorrow take three the next day take four the next day that's the picture that you're getting you get in my mind feeble knees I see just an old shriveled up old man he's just walking around he can barely stand up but you begin to say okay now sit in that chair stand up and every day you start to do a little something and and little by little instead of being scrunched over like this you're like this and then you're like this and then you're like this and then you're have your hands in the air rejoicing because God has made you strong you were once lame you were once weak you once you couldn't do anything you could even hardly lift anything but then step by step you went from being that weak cowardly Christian that every circumstance cows us down and oh my oh it's it's horrible he wants you to be a joyful Christian he wants you to take the trials of the afflictions and not be sad and and weepy but to rejoice in them from your soul not faking it but a reality in your heart say how do I get there one step and one walk with God at at a time every day but if you stop what happens when you're working out brother Chris what happens what happens to me I I'll just say that he's he's more consistent than I am what happens to me and brother Erin when we stop lifting weights we start to get weaker all of us you start to get weaker you you're you know and that's the direction that the world wants to take us Bend us over and be weak so that we can't do what God wants us to do right that's the spiritual Direction the devil wants to take each one of us by our circumstances so that we don't resist amen resistance is where strength comes right so you're going to resist the devil every day you're going to get stronger and stronger and stronger but if he just sometimes he just comes with a flurry of punches and you're just laid low and what happens you just lay down and you just get beat instead of standing up and say I will not submit to you Satan sometimes just saying that out loud you can get the strength to walk forward and get stronger and get stronger Hebrews 54 speaks of that but strong meat belongs to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil reason of you speaks of training literally speaks of training so by training you're developing the skill to recognize between good and evil so that this is the hour that we're living in God is giving to us not the first principles of the doctrine of Christ but he's giving us the strong meat the Mysteries revealed the seals open so that he's giving us that to us so that we can be in training to walk in strength so that we don't have to be beaten down by our circumstances but that we can be joyful in the midst of them so how do we strengthen our weak knees and how do we get a new grip I want to look at a quote from brother brandom is pretty incredible Redemption incompleteness and joy I'm trying something for the glory of God just asking God to help us to give us Souls into the kingdom and Believers that will strengthen their faith and move up even without anything else just will just move right up and say listen to that even without anything else we'll just move right up and say God I believe you on the word that's it there is the initial and first and best way that's right take God at his word amen take God at his word but he doesn't finish there then if you can't do that then of course God sends other things in such as gifts and signs to confirm his word to confirm it to every believer that's his love so the way that we actually strengthen our faith is to move out without any move up without anything else and say God I believe you you upon your promise for me regardless of circumstances regardless of Trials regardless of how I feel regardless of what pain you might be going through you just take God at his word you say that seems so simple yes it is it's God in Simplicity take him at his word that's the mature place that he wants us to be read listen to Listen to or read perfect Faith this is just exactly what brother Bam's talking talking about he wants you to believe the word from that chair that you're sitting in right there or the one at your home or the one in your car believe his word accept healing and go forward and confess it no matter what what you see that's what God that's the perfect faith says if you had perfect Faith you wouldn't need a prayer line yeah that's what he's taking us to now I believe in prayer lines I believe God works through prayer lines if you don't have faith enough brother bam says he sends gifts such as gifts but he's trying to take each of us higher into Realms of perfect Faith amen and I don't believe in shaming people oh you know if you had faith brother Chris you wouldn't come to the prayer line no that's nonsense that's religiosity sometimes I need that we all need that we're all in the place where we need his grace and his grace is there he says even if you can't do that he sends a gift your way but what is I believe we can we can bring it to this point is that he sends those gifts and signs so that they would bring you to the place that you would be in maturity in the word take him at his word and just believe it no matter what regardless of circumstances regardless of how you feel regard I mean look I'm not standing here saying hey this is what I this this is what I have and you guys come come and and get what I have I'm standing here preaching this I need it circumstances sometimes swallow me up but that's not where I'm supposed to be sometimes my faith gets so weak and I I wonder why when God has proven himself over and over and over again so supernaturally that no one should doubt it and yet no that not how I'm going to be moving forward I'm going to take God at his word I'm going to say he said it and I'm going forward by faith regardless of how I feel Isaiah 35 says something like what brother brandham says in Hebrews 12 he says you take the grip you strengthen your knees but here in Isaiah 35 it's it's commanding someone to strengthen the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees say to them them that are of a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your God will come with vengeance even god with a recompense he will come and save you amen even if you don't have the faith to rise above every circumstances God will send a minister to you or a Believer to you to say if you're fearful if you're feeling weak Don't Be Afraid God is coming to save you then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped then shall the lame man leap as in heart and the tongue of the dumb shall sing for in the wilderness shall Waters break out and streams in the desert amen this is already happened through the gospel this is already here for you I'm tell I'm I'm speaking before you and I'm speaking over you now God has come to save you so go go ahead and leap Don't Be Afraid leap with joy because you're saved Amen in the sardian uh Church age it brought uh it brought forth a free Bible to the people again the Lutheran age brought forth a free Bible they made their press and begin to give the world the Bible God bless the lutherans for that yes sir they put the Bible back in the lady's hand again was just priest alone never even had to look at it because it was the pope said and he was the god so whatever he said that did it so now the Lutheran Revival what they wanted to strengthen now you got the Bible in your hand Now read it believe it don't lay it up on the Shelf say well we got a Bible that ain't going to do you no good there's too many lutherans in Pentecost today there's too many Lutheran in the message today laying the Bible around and taking what somebody else says about it brother read the word search the scriptures for they are they which testify of me said Jesus in them you think you have eternal life that's the thing to do read the word strengthen that's the word if you look if you run that back I think it's in the the this that church age smean Church age or sardian church age he speaks about that to strengthen strengthen what you have right and this is Brother brandom commenting on that how are you going to strengthen what you have read the Bible read your Bible every day look don't just read it to check it off the list but really Feast on the word take it into your heart take God's promises over your circumstances read over them again and again and again recite them back to the devil an expectation 1961 brother brandom says I look at the way the Pentecostal church is getting oh God professing Holiness and what Have We Become salt salt that lost its Savor God bring back the Savor back to the Salt quickly that it might contact this rottening world it's a Savor if it contexts and it's got life in it it'll save God make us savers of the world Grant it Lord put the Savor in us to strengthen the church that people might walk in this door and see the power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus moving among the people showing himself alive forever more amen may we not look to the applaud of the people or the opinion of the people or 40,000 in a meeting to make a Revival oh God that isn't a Revival I pray that the holy spirit will get a hold of a few hearts and shake the church and cause a real Pentecostal Revival Grant it Lord amen we'll never be able to have the power of the Resurrection in our Our Lives if we're not walking as triumphant Christians that's what God's called us to be is walking in Victory not on this level where everything's beating us down and we can't stand up on our feet that's going to come the beating is going to come that's not a question we we established that there is going to be punches thrown your way there's going to be kicks there's going to be a battle and you're going to have to face it whether you like or not but the question is not whether you're going to face it the question is will you walk in Victory will you walk as a triumphant Christian or will you let the circumstances beat you down so that your faith cannot operate and the power of the Resurrection will never be manifested in your life in that way and we have to know him in the power of the his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings it's both together and how you'll know him whe When You're Going Through The Fellowship of his sufferings look at Paul all everything that he he wrote To Us everything that we read it wasn't someone that had a good and easy life many of them are written from prison and I'm I'm promise you prison now is a pleasure compared to what it was in Roman Roman times 2 Corinthians 2 verse 14 now thanks be unto God which always causeth us to Triumph in Christ and maketh manifest the Savor of his knowledge By Us in every place for we are unto God a sweet Savor of Christ in them that are saved and in them that perish to the one we are the Savor of death unto unto death and to the other the Savor of Life Savor means the aroma the aroma of Life unto life and who is is sufficient for these things Paul asked that at the end who is sufficient no no none of us are sufficient for it but I want to go back to that verse 14 thanks be to God so he's giving thanks for what which always causes us to Triumph in Christ you say well I don't feel very triumphant this verse at the end acknowledges that sometimes you won't feel very triumphant and at the core you're not sufficient but this is what this is the reality do you believe God's word then if you are filled with the Holy Spirit and you're one of God's elect then we can say categorically that in Christ you're always walking in Triumph no because I stop it this has nothing to do with what you think with how you feel and with what you say the Triumph has already been accomplished Christ has already defeated the works of the devil right that's what happened at Calvary at the Resurrection the the the the work is finished the devil is defeated well why I have all these troubles and trials because he's using you to finish the Triumph now think about this if you look at this you look at this verse he causes us to Triumph the word triumph literally means a triumphal procession so if you if you think about this you might see in in in reading books or see in the Roman age when the military would come in to Rome there would be a great assembly of people there and the military the general would come at the head riding on riding on horses and so forth and the military would March behind and everyone's rejoicing because there has been a victory that's already been accomplished and so what this is speaking of is a victory's already been won a victory's already been achieved and we're in the company in the army with Christ and we're walking behind him and he's causing us to walk in Triumph that's not a question that's not a maybe you always are triumphing so can you say I'm walking in Triumph do you believe that he has won the battle and you're just in the procession because he won the battle for you your life so then we can go a little bit further and extrapolate from this that your life is actually meant to be a triumphal procession in a triumphal procession is everybody sad is everybody sorro no they're joyful why because they know the victory is won we're walking forward the enemy might be trying to come against us but we're walking in Triumph no matter what why because Christ has already won the victory you don't feel very triumphal sometimes right I I I I sense that you're saying that I'm saying that myself but either way the word says I am so do you believe it or not it's a matter of Faith your life then does what if you're walking in that triumphal procession of Christ your life does what it produces an aroma an aroma to do what to make manifest his knowledge so what is your life your life is actually a manifest estation of the knowledge of Jesus Christ that is what your life is supposed to be expressing so what is your life expressing is it expressing the Triumph of Christ it should be there's nothing that should prevent you other than you you're the greatest enemy well the devil's brought this the devil's brought that if you're in Christ the devil has no say about it the word declares it over you the triumphal procession is leading us along and we're spreading wherever we go the beautiful Aroma of Christ for some it speaks of it looks like death to them for others it looks like Grace to them amen the gospel does not come in word only right it's not just us saying we believe it but it's in manifestation it's in demonstration it's in the power of God on display in your life that's what making it manifest means it's not just well he has a stamp of Christian on him he's made his confession no The Life of Christ is flowing through him so that everyone around knows wow what's that smell Something's Cooking around here something wonderful some wonderful smell well some people it's a horrible smell why because they're walking and living in death it's as the Bible said if our gospel be hid it's him hid to them that are lost amen 1 Corinthians chapter 2 yeah verse 3-5 and I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and a power so that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God Amen that that's not just for preachers that's for every one of us it's not to come just in plausible words you made the best argument no it's to come in the power of God the power of the Gospel to heal to deliver to transform a life that's how it's supposed to come and your life is to be an expression of that uh Second Corinthians chapter 4 but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the sight of God Amen what is our life what is our ministry that's for every one of us again we put that too much on preachers every one of us is ordained to take take the word and to be the manifestation of the truth that's what our ministry is that's what we're called to you are to be a manifestation of the truth by the word not apart from the word but by the word that is our Triumph in Christ he's called us to hire things Saints he's called us to higher Powers higher manifestations of the truth higher demonstrations of the truth not to not to these low things he's called us to Great Victory let's walk in it but it starts by faith starts by believing what God Said applies to me and then walking forward as though that's the truth with what hope not a wish hope but an Earnest expectation God said so that settles it if someone's sick any one of you can go lay hands on them and they can be healed we should have that understanding we should have that mind mindset when we come across a person that's sick and Afflicted father do you want me to pray for this person and then pray and you can with expectation believe that they're going to be healed amen the correction that we receive from the Lord is to cause us to become strong it's not to keep us in a in a low place in a weak place we misunderstand what it is it's caused us to have the strength of the Lord so that we can walk in that triumphal procession with Christ amen you musicians if you come Christ has defeated the enemy and we simply March in Triumph with him and as we March in Triumph with him our lives manifest the truth that we have that has been revealed to us amen how many of you want to accept Christ's Triumph for you just move forward with him as though you're walking step by step in this procession what what is this walk that you're walking in it's a walk of Triumph a walk of Victory a walk of overcoming you say I feel defeated I feel this just get up and start walking Saints stop listening to the lies of the enemy do what you know you're supposed to do it's not complicated God has brought the word to us he sent a message this day it's brought it into such a simple way who complicates it the devil don't stop listening to him tell him he's already a defeated being when brother brandham let's all stand when brother brandham made the people stand and he had them put hands on one another what did he say Satan you are a defeated enemy you're a defeated being he he is defeated amen Triumph he's already defeated regardless of what you went through what regardless of the trial regardless of the sin that you've committed repent and walk with God he's not telling you to wallow in the mud he's telling you to walk and be strong get a new grip make your knees strong how do you make my knees strong take the word and stand there and believe it confess it and act as though it's coming to pass in your life because it is amen no matter what you feel no matter how you view yourself throw the way you view yourself in the trash can and take what God said about you you you can say it with me I am a triumphant Christian say that with me I am a triumphant Christian now say it like you mean it I am a triumphant Christian that is what God's word says about you I want to read this before we pray there's not one word God has promised but what will come to pass he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall not fail every promise is perfect and on that one promise in scripture I will not leave my Holy One to see corruption nor suffer him to see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell now Jesus knew that corruption sets in the body after 72 hours the nose falls in Undertaker present would know that now the corruption sets in the body and David said by the Holy Ghost a man inspired the word of the Lord coming to this Prophet said I will not suffer my Holy One to seek corruption and he knowed before one cell would corrupt amen he would be up out of the grave amen why he was the word fortified by the word and he rose up he conquered death hell and the grave and himself come back in the form of the Holy Ghost to fortify his army for this last day amen in this big Onslaught where these great intellectual Giants rising up reasoning against the word but I will not leave you comfortless I will come again and be with you and in you again he said I will pray the father he will send you another comforter which is the Holy Ghost he will abide with you forever what is it the word God's artillery in the human being manifesting the resurrection think of it that great conqueror he's in you he's in me he is the great conqueror he has brought the word it's going to come to pass it never fails now circumstances come and they're try their purpose the devil is trying to get you to disbelieve the word God is trying to bring you to maturity that's the confrontation if you're walking in Triumph and the conf confrontation comes you can simply say God's word says this I'm walking in that I'm not walking in the doubt that the devil's trying to bring me the circumstances are ordained of God to perfect you they're not ordained to God of God to destroy you or to bring you on a low level they're ordained to make you more like Christ and the question is how will you respond the devil has a way for you to respond and that's to take you low to make you weak to make your faith inoperable God's not doing that to to create that in your life he's trying to make you strong so that you can realize you can take him as at his word and he will do it amen let's [Music] pray father we realize that the great sin which separates man from you is unbelief all the other things that that we do Lord is coming as a as a result of unbelief father all evil in this world is a result of unbelief Lord we just want to Cast Away reasonings Cast Away of every High thing

feeling and and things that are not even real 99% of the time things that the devil has made up in your mind just be let go of that just say right now I'm letting go of that and I'm walking with
