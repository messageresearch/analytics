spirit of worship amen we want to continue tonight with part two of a brand new book amen I enjoyed my time in the word Sunday I trust it's a benefit to you I believe it would be and uh believe it'll be tonight as well amen don't you love God's word my goodness there's nothing like it it's my whole hope open States my whole life my whole life is invested Amen in the study and preaching of God's word I wouldn't have a different life amen for anything praise God Revelation chapter 21 catch those first five verses um we'll actually just read the first three and we'll let you be seated and then we'll finish reading four and five after your verse one and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their god let's pray Lord we thank you for your word tonight now father just as I read it I already feel the pulsation of the Holy Spirit Lord no wonder the Bible testifies of its own self that whosoever would read it there's a blessing in reading it there's even a blessing Lord in just hearing it read so father we're thanking you for that tonight now we've gathered Lord in the midweek here for our little midweek uh filp Lord we need a fresh surge of the Holy Spirit we need a fresh anointing upon the word of God lord we need something to give us strength and give us courage father to fight the fight of Faith to carry on Lord God I pray Lord that we not just carry on but carry on Victorious for we have already found out Lord that we are predestinated father we are we are ordained to not fall we are predestinated to stand Lord victoriously and so tonight father we give ourselves Lord wholly and completely to that thing which gives us all of our strength it is our whole hope and stay it is your word Lord you value your word above your own name the Bible teaches Jesus so we commit it to you now in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated we're going to continue reading verse four and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former Things Are are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said now that's the one you can put your confidence in the one seated on the throne behold I make all things new now since the one on the throne said it you can Bank on it because he don't change his mind and nobody can stop him Hallelujah so he says I and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful I think it's a pretty amazing deal that the Lord is offering us you know I I years ago many years ago I had a friend uh from back in the day probably almost 30 years ago don't even know if he's still living he was he was uh senior to me so I don't even haven't heard from him in a long time may have uh went on he he was a wonderful Christian man and couldn't quite see you know the word of God as we see it but I could sense in him a real love for the Savior and uh I'm going to tell you something friends that's what the Lord will be looking for on that day when when those who are granted eternal life you know we already know they they didn't they didn't receive the message because that's why they went through a tribulation said well you know they should have went to the Judgment they did they went went through the tribulation period and then they came to the Judgment bar and they were granted eternal life and he had a sign that always admired in his office when I was there and he did bookkeeping for me bookkeeping for the church and uh the sign had a picture of the Lord Jesus and it's it's the Lord saying to the to whoever is reading and saying I never told you it would be easy I only told you it would be worth it and every time I would come into Robert's office I would just stare at that sign I would say yes Lord oh I don't want it easy I don't need it easy it wasn't easy for him it wasn't easy for the Saints of old I'm not looking for Easy Street or a flowery bed of ease friends I'd like to know that I made it through and I fought my way and I saw the enemy put down and I saw the Lord Jesus lifted up I've often thought I'd like that to be my last breath in this world is calling Satan a liar and Jesus true Hallelujah and so I'd like to agree with these words his words are true and faithful and so you've got this one seated on the throne that's that's laying out a case here that I would just say it ought to be a a deal you can't refuse because I mean he's going to wipe away all tears there's going to be no more death there's going to be no more sorrow there's going to be no more crying there's going to be no more pain the former things are passed away and oh boy I wish that was true tonight I wish that a lot of my former things were just passed away but he's saying they're going to be passed away and all things are going to be made new now we found the echo of that in Isaiah 65 where he said the former shall not be remember remembered you you you recall that we read that in our text on Sunday Isaiah 65:17 and 18 behold I created new heavens and a new Earth and the former things the former shall not be remembered nor come into mine I love that we had quite a bit to say about that and I still feel it reverberating in my soul this evening be but be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create could I say to you tonight in the words of this highly esteemed Prophet be glad and rejoice be glad I know the world is tough I know there's problems I know there's the devil I know we got issues but be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing in her people Joy is coming a painfree world dismissed let's just go out in the churchyard and Shout a while and people drive by and say what are y'all what's y'all's problem well we got a lot of problems now but we're headed the reason we're shouting is because we're headed for a painfree world not only will you no longer feel the pain of traumas past traumas how many got them past trials traumas and trials and past failures and and all your losses I've had some pretty epic losses friends but I'm here to tell you that all of those former things they're going to be unremembered because they won't even come back to my mind you're like me life can give you many regrets and painful memories some of you young people don't know a whole lot about that yet although I imagine it doesn't take too long to get them piling up by the time you get some years on you life has given you a lot of regrets and a lot of painful memories that come on let's be honest we'd really like to get them out of our mind I mean let's just tell the truth we'd like to get them out of our mind we so wish wish that we could undo them well there they won't exist Hallelujah that world will be filled with all that I ever loved and all that ever loved me that can't be for just one man because the Bible says I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy Hallelujah brother brandham let me have my PowerPoint brother Josh brother brandham carries on here in the message I uh I I I congratulate any who did some homework and got this message out I had some people writing me from overseas saying okay you talk me into it I'm going to listen to Future home again amen praise the Lord oh let's see I think I'm on are we up and running oh there we go beautiful all right so a brand new book part two look at that subtitle that's weird isn't it not a simulation that's conspiracy theory this is not a simulation but it is a shadow I'm not going to say a whole lot about that tonight we're gonna have some of this for Sunday it looks like we are not in a simulation this is real but it is a shadow so there is something far more real say man the regrets I got I don't see how changing location you're going to leave this existence just understand that every regret every loss every failure is in a shadow and it won't exist in a positive Hallelujah my brother Brandon is goes on here to say and I'm not going to say a whole lot more about that but you know there's um there there brother brandham said some fascinating things uh about that and I I'm not I'm trying to resist not going down that path tonight but you know the I can just I will just give you just a little teaser that science on The Cutting Edge we're talking about we're not just talking we are talking about Einstein's theory of general relativity including his theory of special relativity which is different which is further including String Theory including super String Theory including brain Theory there's all kinds of Cutting Edge scientific theories that if they would have just took a Kentucky Hillbilly's word of how he explained it it wouldn't be Theory anymore it' be scientific law and they would understand but they're too prideful I'm glad God gave me a perfect Faith to believe in a perfect promise and you're going to see that all of those theories recognize multi-dimensional levels now they've got it all wrong they some of them got five Dimensions some of them need 10 some of them strength Theory needs 10 11 and uh you know and there's all kinds of different ones but but but we know that there are other dimensions and and and and I'm not going to go any further than that all right so brother brandham says here now here here was our scripture from Isaiah we've already read that okay brother Brandon picks up here paragraph 101 now the reason I've got these quotes on here is because they're lengthy and then I got some a few other shorter quotes that are not up here because I want to give you a little bit of of change up all right so let's read along here you're going to see some of the things that we've been teaching from now he's called The Church through justification called it through sanctification then filled it with the Holy Ghost and Fire and he took it through a process that he himself self the Holy Spirit himself the Son of God could dwell in the human heart now it has got to go through that before he can come uh into it so here is where we were on Sunday where brother brandham is showing that he puts you through the same thing he puts the Earth he puts the Earth through the same thing he puts you and incidentally may I say he himself went through he went through the exact same things you understand when the Holy Ghost came upon him in the water he didn't need to be born again but he he did get an empowerment for his ministry it wasn't for a new birth like you you're born in sin you need a new birth and you need an anointing upon you to go forward in faith and power and I'm here to tell you there's power in the Holy Ghost see because you're still in a you're you're still trapped you know uh uh in in in a body that is so uh unbelievably weak now Christ of course at the same time was in every way temptable the difference between he and you is that he never even one time failed to always do that which pleases the father now there's no one who could have pulled that off except God himself which is the only proof I need that Jesus wasn't a second person he was the person cuz no human could have done what he' done unless he was more than a man he was a God man see so he says he says all right now it has to go through that before he can come into it notice he done the world uh notice he done the world where that bride the world excuse me notice he done the world where that bride is going to live in the same way his same Plan of Salvation notice the anad deluvian world after he after it had repented by through the Bride of that day Noah catch it now it repented through Noah so so Noah's life the Earth got credit for its justification because sons of God lived for God so surely you wouldn't go away now thinking all this is just rules this is so far beyond rules and rs this is a manifestation of a literal life that created it all and is now living inside of his family living through them it's far more than just that's why denominationalism is worthless because all it is is is just it just puts you in a box and makes you a box Christian see and it doesn't even have the box right so he says it by through the Bride of that day Noah he gave it a water baptism covered it over with water then justification showing that he's on his road to call this Fallen World from Eden back to its restoration again then Christ came and shed his blood upon it cleansing it and claiming it see that's the world that we live in now see how Satan watch this now see how Satan here in the scripture tried to make him break God's plan now he's talking about Jesus in the wilderness he the spirit of God comes on him in the water this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell immediately he goes into the wilderness to receive his fiery trials and you know there's where brother brandham says him and Dr Davis always debated over you know that the fact that after John baptized Jesus then Dr Davis said then Jesus turned around and baptized John and brother brandham says no he didn't do that brother Roy he did not do that John baptized him and the spirit Came Upon him and he straightway went up out of the water and he said you know in the whole debate is Billy you know you just don't know your Bible and your uh um Dr Smith tried to tell him the same thing he said well I know the author real well and I mean they those doctors of divinity got every way they want to prove it till finally a prophet just just put it on the brass tax and he said one time in another place he said I know he didn't do that because he stood me there on the bank and I watched it take place and he said he came straight up out of the water and the spirit of God descended on him and he went straight into the Wilderness I'm here to tell you something friends you got in insider trading understanding see so he says says not now he says um see how Satan here in the scripture tried to make him break God's plan to receive it give it to him when he took him up on the mountain and tried to give it to him without the purchase of the blood Satan you know said well if these Stones you're hungry which he was turn them into into bread and I you know the other day I was uh at at at at brother Chris's and and we were we have a Tuesday Morning Bible study there with his crew and I was just I took the a thought some week or two ago and I said you know when Jesus went into the Wilderness you know he left his guns in the ranch house he left all his weapons on the table he went into the Wilderness unarmed except with the word brother brandham said now he had great power he could have turned those stones into bread but he didn't want to use his great power he because he was showing a road map for you and I he was giving us the way forward so that it when it would be your turn to be the word made flesh you'd know how to beat the devil and you wouldn't need the kind of power he had access to cuz you've got the same thing he's got but you've only got a spoonful of it he was the whole fullness of the godhead bodily he could have spoke the devil out of existence had it served his purpose right then the devil jumping up thinking he's somebody and his very life is sustained by God think about it friends the world thinks they're in control they're in control of nothing and all of history has been not only not only uh not only has has prophecy been the Catalyst of all history but it's been the sustainer of all history it's been the controller of all history he's got his foot on the throttle and on the break and he puts it in park or he pulls it in drive and me the best laid plans of mice and men mean nothing to God why do you fear Him friends your heavenly father has got the whole plan under his under his control under his domain your heavenly father news flash is God but now Satan wants to give him a shortcut you know showed him all the kingdoms of the world showed him America brother B say showed him America showed him Russia showed him everything showed him all the future all the kingdoms that would ever be and said they're mine and Jesus didn't argue because the whole world been Fallen it's all bro the whole thing was broken and Satan had Dominion of it Adam lost it lost control of it and Satan is now controlling it the only thing he can't get his hands on is that book of life he tried but brother Brenham said his Filthy Hands couldn't hold it and it went back to the original thank God the book with my name is safe in The Throne Room of almighty God and Satan can't get near it wo hallelujah hallelujah oh my and so he says I'll give them to you all you got to do is worship me and see brother brandham says he's trying to give he here in the scripture trying to make him break God's plan to receive it give it to him oh you know when he took him up on the mountain and tried to give it to him without the purchase of blood now watch him go back and pick up the father of the faith and Abraham's going to show the type he says did you notice how Abraham when they tried to give him the land he bought it with so many shekel of silver before the people as an insign as a witness let it be known this day that I bought this burying Place see purchase it and Satan tried to give him the kingdom which belongs to him now he tried to give it to him as a gift but he wouldn't receive receive it cuz it's see watch then Satan could still have a claim on it now a rightful claim is a legal problem if somebody's got a legal claim you got a title you own some property but that thing somebody's got a legal claim against that you got a house you got a building and somebody has filed a legal claim and that then that's got to go to court and that's got to a decision's got to be made so he's saying here if if he could have Talk Jesus into that then Satan could still have a claim on I'm so glad he didn't do it so glad he didn't take the bait I'm so glad he didn't try to avoid pain and sorrow and crucifixion Hallelujah see so he says amen he says he had had a claim on it but it had to be bought amen he was the word in the fullness thereof they couldn't deceive him into it thank God boy they might could have tricked me but they couldn't deceive him into it then then it it is now to get a baptism of fire see it has now what happened he says Christ came and called The Church Church to repentance uh in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission sanctify the church and with the fire of God come down and burn out all the filth and come and dwells in the human heart now the world to be redeemed for this redeemed person he uses the same he uses his same method you understand it's his method to come down and burn it out of you is his method to come down and Destroy old friendships and wreck old relationships that's him you understand to put you on a different course and maybe upend and you might have a a tremendous investment in a certain course of life and God has come down and flipped the whole script and you're now moving away from everything you sunk so much into and now but I'm here to tell you five minutes into his way is worth more than 50 years in the wrong way he baptized it with water after the anad deluvian destruction shed his blood upon it to sanctify it and claim it it's his Satan tried to say I'll give it to you he said no sir I'll buy it Let It Be A Witness he was lifted up for an ins sign and he bought it he Pur purchased it you say it's his true but what's his is mine if you don't believe what a hus what that everything a husband has belongs to the wife ask sister debie I'll promise you Brothers everything you got belongs to her Hallelujah thankfully everything that's hers is mine also this whole thing is a love affair that's why a marriage depicts Christ in his bride so it is his he bought it but it's mine because it's his so how did it become yours when it was his cuz I'm his Hallelujah the devil hates that and I'm glad he hates it I want to say it again he bought it and I own it Hallelujah I have legal rights to it I'm not just claiming it it's not just a a word salad I'm not just offering a cliche I own eternal life Hallelujah but now watch but now it has to go through a baptism of fire Holy Fire from God which cleanses the earth and the heavens around it then it's purchased so that the redeemed can live on it live in it in peace notice the baptism of fire is to cleanse it from sin from sickness from disease germs from sinners from the devil and all his group he's to be cast out into the Lake of Fire you want peace in your life takes fire that's an odd way of getting to peace well it's not just getting you to a peace it's getting you to the peace and the difference between a piece and the piece is a piece comes and goes and it depends on how good you feel and how well people are treating you and how many zeros are in your bank account and as your car running all right soon as those things collapse you ain't got a whole lot of peace I'm here to tell you that there's a peace that passes understanding that the worse it gets the more peace you have you're an enigma you're an anomaly the devil can't figure out the harder he makes it on you the more love God and believe his word see so he says all right so so so here all right so it has to go to the Lake of Fire okay we got that one Holy Fire from God comes down from God out of Heaven Burns it up notice to make it ready for God to dwell in for God in the new world that is to come is to dwell in the Earth because you say God he dwells in the human heart but he and his bride becomes one and they go to their home in the new world this is poetry and the same Plan of Redemption is used to redeem both world and the persons that live in it see the heart has to be cleansed like that before God can come down in the person of the Holy Ghost which is Christ coming down and dwell in the human heart it first must be repented see it's got to be cleansed he's not going to live inside this is where where brother Brandon would constantly say to those Pentecostal women and he says you get out there in the front yard and you're half naked just so men can see you and lust after you and you claim you got the holy spirit said I'll remind you sister he's a holy spirit not a filthy spirit so there no way to make that claim there's no way to claim you have the Holy Spirit and not living holy I don't deny you've got a spirit but it ain't the Holy Spirit certainly not anointing you when you do stuff like that not even saying you don't love God but as I've said to you and taught you there's a big difference there's a Grand Canyon siiz difference between having a love for God and having the love of God the love of God is the person of God living down inside you all right so he says um all right so here we go it must be baptized in water in the his name to show who it belongs to then it must be cleansed by the blood of Jesus and then the Holy Fire and holy ghost from God come down and burns out all the desire of sin all the nature of the world and therefore see now watch and therefore he that sins willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth then again the Bible said it's impossible for a man that's born of God for man that's born of God cannot sin he does not sin there's no way for him to sin how can he be a sinner and and a redeemed at the same time so brother Brandon is saying th this would create a conundrum if you don't understand the meaning of it so you know if you it it once once you realize what real Sin is is unbelief it's not in brother Brandon I just heard him today sister Debbie playing a tape through the house and as I come through and he's he's talking talking about you know I was saying I was saying you know drinking's not sin adulter is's not sin gambling's not sin all these things are not sin and he said there was one poor old black sister there he said she had about all she could take and said she got to her feet and said brother Brandon pray tell what is sin then he was happy she did it he said it's unbelief you do those things cuz you're not converted see the desire of the world is still in you and so that is still a habit of your life see all right so um all right so how can I be in the pawn shop here's a legit question how can I be in the pawn shop and out of the pawn shop at the same time see oh he redeemed Us by his blood his Spirit he cleansed us and then comes to dwell in us the church not the denomination now the church all right so now I'm going to take that down and I'm going to give you some pieces of some other stuff he says he goes on in this same message and then I've got a different one from a different message and I'll let you know when we make the transition back and forth so in case you put it down in your notes so brother brandham begins he goes on down in this future home and he's talking about he picks up the narration of John saying I saw a holy city New Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven heaven and it was as a bride adorned for her husband so so everything about the city is is working in the bride you see how in Congress it is for people to imagine that they're not like him but they'll go to that city the whole city and them are operating on the same thing he's doing he's doing the Earth the city the bride his family Jes Jesus himself it all has to come through water blood and spirit it all has to come through justification and sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you can't end around or short circuit or Bypass or step over any of those pieces see so the the world tries to do that but they're going to get a rude awakening so he says he's asking the question now where did John see the city on he says just exactly like it did upon the Earth Jesus was part of the earth that the Holy Ghost descended upon right Jesus his body so that that's why brother Brandon would paraphrase the scripture as only a prophet has authority to do at that level and where he says that you know you read in in your Bible and it says the the the spirit of God descended like a dove and a voice spoke and said this is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased and brother brandham said the spirit of God descended like a dove and said this speaking of Jesus this man his body made out of the dust made out of the Earth this is my part of the earth this is God saying that this you got your part you're living in it that's your part of the earth said well I'm going to shed it one of these days well you're going to pick it back up every element that you are it's just going to be glorified it's going to go from Shadow to from a negative to a positive from Shadow to real it the the shadow only looks real because you're part of the Shadow you're in the shadow looking at the shadow so it seems real and it is a certain it is real we're not in a simulation it is real but I'm here to tell you there's a greater real and you've got your part of the earth and Jes and God was saying now you now here's my part of the earth that you're going to walk around my heaven in your part of the earth and I'm going to Walk Around Heaven in my part of the earth and this is my part of the earth and I've come to claim it and I'm going to start with this part of the earth and with this part of the earth I'm going to claim all the rest of the earth and all the other bodies and parts of my family that came out of the Earth or will come out of the earth that's you and me today I'm here to tell you when he came down to bring the spirit of God on Jesus he wasn't just thinking about Jesus he was thinking about Mrs Jesus Hallelujah you you you say I'm a Christian today you've been you've been in the works to be a Christian for thousands of years God already knew you were coming and already knew you would be a believer you can't not be a believer you're part of the same word so he so you see how he's he's tying it all together the Earth your body the New Jerusalem it's all the same thing see so so this is why this is why brother Brandon would say now this is the holy spirit in word form I thought the Holy Spirit was a person this is him in word form see so so now you you you you come and say well who was Jesus he was the Holy Spirit in human form see so where's now he's the holy spirit in Bride form you understand so so he says and It Came Upon him it descended and it remained upon him forever it could never leave him he and God are one always has to remain so John saw the holy city New Jerusalem descending like a comet or a dove down out of Heaven settling Upon A redeemed entire Earth to do what to claim Every Act attribute that he had made the Earth for and you're like brother Jason is he talking about people every man that was represented in the eternity and every woman is redeemed then she's been scoured and burned by fire Jesus in his fiery Temptation in the wilderness for 40 days after that notice it was ready for his ministry that's why you're ready for your ministry because you now have the Living Word of God it's a living bread it's a living reality hallelujah it's not no wonder organized religion can't do it no wonder denominationalism can't do that it can't produce that see so just as Jesus loved the father's Plan of Redemption in the word he loved it far too much to let Satan give him a shortcut I'm glad just as he loves the Earth that he created brother brandham goes on to talk about how that the whole reason of John's vision is because now there's been a millennium and a millennium has gone on for a thousand years but he brother brandham says there's he's not going to leave it in in the in the Millennium because the poor O Earth is still stuck in time it's still stuck in time excuse me but I don't really want to go to heaven at this age I'd like to be back like my grandkids again I want a new body I want a new Heaven the Earth is old like a garment but I'm here to tell you it's going to get a complete makeover Hallelujah the the Earth's Crush brother bom talks about the Earth's Crush for hundreds of miles will explode out the there's going to be fresh virgin soil Hallelujah friends going to be a new atmosphere that goes all the way up to that new city hallelujah oh my so he loves it too much to Le you know the Earth that he created he's not going to leave it Trapped In Time Forever in the seventh day now he he loves you too much see he loved the father's word too much to take a shortcut if he you're going to see how imp Peril you'd be here in a minute see he loved the the father's word of redemption he loved the whole notion of redemption too much Bible said he'll see his seed and be satisfied he loved that Vision far more than he dreaded his suffering amen so you know just like golden my ear said of the of the uh radical people who who have assaulted them since they became a nation and she says I she says the I think she uses the word Arab or Palestinian I can't remember which is such a political upside down bunch of nonsense she herself was and could prove she was a Palestinian go to my hair she said this whole nonsense like the Palestinian are different people she said I'm a Palestinian and so so she says when the Palestinians or when the Arabs I don't remember specifically she said when they love she she said they they say we kill their children we we loathe killing their children we only we kill their children because they're trying to kill us and the parents are trying to kill us and said I'll tell you when she said I'll tell you when you have peace said it to a reporter she said when they love their children more than they hate us we'll have peace when they love their children more than they hate us we'll have peace so he loves you too much to take a shortcut he loved God's Plan of Redemption he loved the Earth too much to leave it trapped in time and he loves you he he he loved us too much to take a short cut to the kingdom uh to the kingdom of Christ without the baptism of the Holy Ghost listen friends let me say it like this in plain language he loves you too much to let you go to heaven without the Holy Ghost it's not going to happen you're going to have to have the Holy Ghost in fire say oh it's he it's too much of a demand it's not a demand it's love see so the Plan of Redemption was too important to Jesus his reward was too precious to him as I said the scripture says he'll see his seed and be satisfied we show showed you Sunday oh I got to hurry we showed you Sunday how that Isaiah there saw the Lord high and lifted up Daniel saw him on the throne John saw him in heaven he he later describes a white throne and he that sat on the throne from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away now so now now you're coming to the Judgment bar and brother brandham says see Satan offered him that and had he took it then Satan could have a legal claim could you imagine after God working for 6,000 years to get to that great white Throne judgment and now we're already past the Rapture we're past the 144,000 we're past the tribulation we're past the Millennium we're at the Judgment bar we're just getting ready for the new heavens and the new Earth and they bring the Bible talks about how the enemy is brought before him and the Bible says that they shall narrowly look upon him and humanity is going to be stupified to say is this the is this the man that made Nations tremble and and did all that the stuff in the world and all the history really yeah and and now everything's ready the angels are ready to see him destroyed the bride is ready the day we've waited on our Tormentor is about to be finished and Jesus steps forward to to to send him to the flames and he says just a second and he pulls out illegal because this is God on the throne who can't be unjust and and can't lie and he's he's Bound by his own word he can't do anything contrary to his word and the devil could say just a second could we could we play Replay the videotape please how how far do you want to go back well I need a thousand years from the Millennium then about 2,000 years let's go back about 3,000 years and uh go back to right when he came into the Wilderness and yeah you mean the bread and all past that oh you you mean the the put him up on a and said jump off now go a little past that yeah keep going fast forward fast for okay stop right there now let's play hit play they're all mine and I'll give them to you worship me could you imagine if this if as brother Bram said on God's Great television screen that stretches across the whole sky can you imagine the gut punch it would be to you and me and all of our loved ones and the thing we've waited on and Paul fought for and Peter died for and Luther took a stand on and the of fathers and brother brandom around the world seven times Moses and Elijah in the tribulation and 144,000 and the millennium's already done and we're ready to we're at the Finish Line we're ready to cross over but there's a hitch Jesus took a shortcut what does that mean and brother Bram goes on to describe here said see if he had had a claim and then the whole thing breaks down the whole thing collapses and everything that we've ever lived for is finished hence when Satan would come back at the Judgment bar and file suit against your Redeemer and win the case if he wins the case against your Redeemer then you lose your Redemption and and and and and and you know even though he he remained faithful through those fiery trials everything that Satan could put him through had he had victory at that last moment it all of the victory wouldn't have mattered I'm here to tell you something friends I plan to believe this word all the way across the finish line I'm not looking to uh live all my life for God and get right here to the finish line and suddenly my faith wobbles and I want the world and I've never been born again if I've never been born again I want to be born again tonight if I don't have the Holy Ghost I want it tonight I want it in this service I don't even want to leave the building until I've got Jesus all way Hallelujah he remained faithful to death even the death of the Cross they stripped him they beat him they hung him on a cross between Heaven and Earth they laughed at him they mocked him they crucified him and they walked away and left him crying for his father father I'm so glad that he did they said come down save us save yourself and save us and what they didn't know is that he could have come down and he could have saved himself but had he saved himself he couldn't save you oh I'm so glad that he stayed and he endured oh he was Faithful Friends how does the world turn him down how do you wait one more minute how do you not give him your whole heart and your whole life and your whole mind you owe him everything everything we owe him everything make this last point I want to close I got a few minutes before 8:30 brother brandham in in the message three kinds of Believers very late in' 63 he says I was speaking to a couple this afternoon about how that you cannot totally annihilate anything human beings can't annihilate they can tear down not annihilate someone said well what about taking and burning a piece of of paper does that annihilate it no sir it only breaks the chemicals apart the heat of the fire it goes right back to the gases what it was in the beginning you cannot annihilate and if this world stood long enough that same gases that and chemicals that was in that paper could come right back and be a piece of paper again that's exact you cannot annihilate exact see now he I don't I don't know is he meaning it's come back to a tree and be remanufactured I don't know he doesn't explain it but it makes sense to me I if if time would go on long enough it could eventually through the process of Nature and through the process of manufacturing if that was needed become paper again you the point is you you can't annihilate anything he says God then if there is a rection to is if there is a resurrection to everything back again and no Annihilation then there is a resurrection of the just yeah and we are got to come back now that's the beautiful point he's making he's trying because you know Paul would say if there be no Resurrection if Christ is not raised and you're in your sins and it's all worthless anyhow see so if he didn't raise and then if you don't raise then then if you live this life and you go to the grave and then nothing is there to bring you back and then what what is what's it all been about and so brother brandham is trying to bring a comfort because people say my goodness you know what if I'm fed to Lions what if I'm burned in a fire what if I you know um sit on you know what if I'm in a nuclear explosion what if I get torn apart what if my ashes get thrown to the Four Winds doesn't matter brother Ram said the trumpet will sound he'll know it's me it'll all come back together anyway see and so so his point is that look don't worry about that you you've had all kinds of losses friends you've had things that God ordained that you should be but the devil through life through life through just life and and a lot of opportunities we talked about it earlier that we've missed out on and a lot of regrets that we have I'm here to tell you nothing is annihilated I don't care how bad you broke it or the devil broke it or you and the devil together broke it I'm here to tell you what everything that God ever ordained in you you're going to get it you're going to come back to it no wonder he could say everything I loved and everything that loved me God is given it God has given it because he couldn't lose it see so it's got to come back that's all there is to it there's no way at all of doing no matter if you're burned up if you're drowned wherever takes place they cannot annihilate so brother brandham is making the point that there has to be and there will be a Redemption of bringing back what once was and that nothing can be annihilated but it but but it also makes the indirect point that none of my sins that have been annihilated can ever come back on me no matter how long I'm alive on the other side they can never come back on me because he annihilated them oh glory to God friends all of my sins in the sea of God's forgetfulness never to be no wonder he could say I make Jerusalem a joy I make the people rejoicing Hallelujah friends that doesn't matter you might have been complicit I'm here to tell you every time you make a mistake and you repent brother Bram says the error you made goes back on the head of the devil and he'll have to answer for it not me he'll have to answer for it all my sins are in the blood of the lamb and they're annihilated from my life oh we ought to stand up to our feet and raise up our hands and say thank you Lord Jesus thank you aren't you glad he didn't take a shortcut aren't you glad he didn't take the easy route see so he says just remember that every part of you was here this this ought to give you such power no matter what the devil tries to front on you with tomorrow just remember that every part of you was here when God spoke the world into existence he put your body right here then and there is nothing can take it away except God it's all back in his hands again he couldn't leave the Earth on that seventh day because it was still in time and if time went on long enough and there was no Annihilation then a sinful world could reform you see why it has to have a holy fire do you see why you have to have a holy fire you see why putting your name on a book and shaking a preacher's hand can't work you see why man-made religion is of no value you have to have Holy Fire it's got to annihilate every trait and any claim Satan has ever could ever or will ever have on me exactly Mo on me on you my loved ones on your loved ones on the earth that we love that God loves and created friends I'm here to tell you something he baptizes us with the Holy Ghost in Fire and just as his vision of me listen his vision of me doesn't include any trace of my mistakes not his vision now I know that's hard for you to get your mind around because you're in the shadow but I'm here to tell you that his vision of me does not include it doesn't leave behind Trace elements of my failures it doesn't leave behind residue it doesn't leave behind any DNA it doesn't leave behind any forensics it's completely annihilated out of existence and no matter how long the world will ever go it'll never be charged to me again I'm free are you free tonight do you know him and the power of his resurrection bow your heads with me over the building Lord we thank you we thank you for your word tonight thank you for your anointing to preach it Lord with all my heart tonight I stand Here Lord with all these people we're aware lord of the shortcomings we've had through life down the down the River of Life Lord many things that Came Upon Us and Prophet said that's just out of the human grab bag it just you know it's not so much luck of the draw but it but it it's all known and ordained of God anyway so he knows all about it there's a provision he's got you he's got this it's all in his hands Lord tonight we can let off the pressure we can relax in the arms of Jehovah we can believe for every word that it applies to me Lord Jesus if I haven't said it lately can I say it tonight thank you for not taking a shortcut thank you Lord thank you well I sure have toen plenty but not you you never took one I'm so grateful I
