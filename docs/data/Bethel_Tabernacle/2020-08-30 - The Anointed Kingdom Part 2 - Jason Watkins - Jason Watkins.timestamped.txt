[31:35] all right
[31:51] praise the lord praise the lord
[31:57] real quick um last week
[32:01] throughout last week we were um
[32:04] persecuted pretty harshly through
[32:07] someone in our community
[32:09] and um it was kind of rough because
[32:12] the person attacked not only
[32:16] our business but our character and
[32:19] one of the statements that she made
[32:21] publicly was that we were wolves in
[32:23] sheep clothing
[32:26] so
[32:28] uh caitlyn and i both took that pretty
[32:30] personally
[32:32] but um you know the more we just really
[32:36] listened to the lord as he was speaking
[32:38] to us through that trial was that you
[32:40] know
[32:41] we're supposed to be persecuted we're
[32:43] supposed to stand out and be a
[32:44] difference
[32:45] and um so i just kept
[32:48] thinking how to handle the situation and
[32:51] i tried to reach out to her in love
[32:54] she didn't want to communicate with us
[32:57] and so
[32:57] you know i just kept feeling you know
[32:59] lord you didn't say anything
[33:02] when you were being beaten and bruised
[33:05] and
[33:06] um so he just kept saying keep your
[33:08] mouth quiet
[33:10] and just keep living living the life
[33:13] so i'm only singing this
[33:17] [Music]
[33:20] it's a hard song because my dad
[33:26] so i hope i could get through it
[33:30] and i'm thankful he came up and sang
[33:32] with me
[33:35] because i'm a backup singer he's the
[33:38] lead
[33:39] so if you know it just sing it because i
[33:41] don't want to sing about myself

[38:44] sing and just sitting here
[38:46] and not really realizing or not wanting

[38:55] man so i really appreciate that that's
[38:57] awesome i really like it
[38:58] man let's give them a hand hey man
[39:14] clear skies grew black
[39:19] his angry thunder rolled in
[39:25] smashing waves driven
[39:29] by mad howling wind
[39:35] one lonely vessel
[39:40] so close to home
[39:45] and one frantic captain
[39:50] barely keep in control
[39:56] the lighthouse on the hill
[39:58] [Music]
[40:01] could have ended his plight
[40:06] but it's dim beacon's glow
[40:11] hardly cut through in the night
[40:13] [Music]
[40:16] though he strained he could not see
[40:20] [Music]
[40:22] for the lack of some light
[40:27] he heard the crack of the hole
[40:30] the ship soon was full was the captain's
[40:34] last
[40:36] night
[40:38] and all to the thanks
[40:43] of a lazy light keeper
[40:45] [Music]
[40:48] the fire did burn
[40:53] but it was only within
[40:58] it did not reach out
[41:03] to the ones that were needy
[41:06] [Music]
[41:08] poet could not reach out
[41:13] for there was soot on the limb
[41:19] one man a drift
[41:22] [Music]
[41:24] on life's troubled sea
[41:29] i maintain this lighthouse
[41:34] and it's all up to me
[41:38] [Music]
[41:40] but my beacon shines
[41:45] through this darkened world of sin
[41:50] or will he like the captain
[41:56] soon see his end
[41:58] [Music]
[42:00] oh i don't want to be
[42:05] a lazy light keeper
[42:10] hope my fire does burn
[42:15] but isn't only within
[42:21] will it reach out
[42:25] to the ones that aren't
[42:30] oh can it reach out
[42:33] [Music]
[42:35] or is there soot on my lid
[42:40] oh i don't want to be

[44:53] that flows beneath the throne
[44:58] and the surface that reflects

[55:34] those seven compound redemptive names
[55:37] lord
[55:38] what a promise it was what a comfort
[55:41] it was what are letting off of the
[55:43] pressure it was to your prophet
[55:45] when standing there hearing seeing that
[55:48] that that
[55:49] that that on the mountain seeing those
[55:52] crosses and that rainbow
[55:53] and a voice saying jesus that jehovah of
[55:57] the old testament

[56:02] great release for him

[56:06] scripture you confirmed it lord it's
[56:08] confirmed to us today

[57:28] controller yep got it right here so once

[57:33] sure that that's working good i'll wait
[57:34] to turn it on
[57:35] uh i won't turn it on just yet for the
[57:37] mat
[57:38] all right revelation chapter 21
[57:42] verse 1 through 7.
[57:47] i saw a new heaven and a new earth for
[57:50] the first heaven and the first earth
[57:52] were passed away
[57:54] and there was no more sea and i john
[57:57] saw the holy city new jerusalem coming
[58:00] down from god out of heaven prepared
[58:03] as a bride adorned for her husband
[58:07] you can have confidence friends john saw
[58:09] it
[58:11] john saw it he wrote you a letter saying
[58:14] hey
[58:15] i saw it and i heard a great voice out
[58:19] of heaven saying
[58:21] behold the tabernacle of god is with men
[58:24] and he will dwell with them and they
[58:26] shall be his people
[58:28] and god himself shall be with them and
[58:30] be their god
[58:32] and god shall wipe away all tears from
[58:34] their eyes and there shall be
[58:35] no more death neither sorrow nor crying
[58:39] neither shall there be any more pain for
[58:42] the former things are passed away
[58:45] and he that sat upon the throne said
[58:49] behold i make all things
[58:53] new and he said unto me write
[58:56] for these words are true and
[58:59] faithful and he said unto me it is done
[59:03] i am alpha and omega the beginning
[59:06] and the end i will give unto him that is
[59:10] a thirst
[59:11] of the fountain of the water of life
[59:13] freely
[59:14] he that overcometh shall inherit
[59:18] all things and i will be his god
[59:22] and he shall be my son
[59:26] may the lord bless the reading of his
[59:28] word as you're seated
[59:36] all right so you should be on that
[59:40] number uh 12 title
[59:43] it's a blank screen but let's have that
[59:45] number 12
[59:46] screen pulled up so i'm correct that i'm
[59:49] going to use this hey matty so it's not
[59:51] going to work in the propresenter okay
[59:54] all right praise the lord now i would
[59:57] think that the
[59:58] that blank 12 that number 12 screen
[1:00:00] would have a golden bar at the bottom
[1:00:02] i don't see that so let me advance
[1:00:05] um yeah okay you're not up yet very good
[1:00:10] all right
[1:00:14] go to slide 12.
[1:00:17] and slide 12 should be a black blank
[1:00:20] screen magnificent you're a beautiful
[1:00:22] man son thank you
[1:00:23] all right so
[1:00:27] so we're we're taking this thought and
[1:00:28] continuing on the anointed kingdom how
[1:00:31] many are glad to be the kingdom of god
[1:00:33] you know the kingdom means people you
[1:00:36] don't have kingdom without people
[1:00:37] and so it's a kingdom of saints
[1:00:40] amen it's a kingdom of christ
[1:00:44] and let me say it like this it's a
[1:00:45] kingdom of christ's
[1:00:49] it's a kingdom of kings and priests amen
[1:00:53] and so and it's real and it's coming say
[1:00:57] how do you know i'm already in it
[1:01:01] how how do i know i'm going to get my
[1:01:03] body changed it has so many weaknesses
[1:01:05] and i make so many mistakes
[1:01:07] well i you know you know the victory i
[1:01:09] get is i realize
[1:01:10] i'm a triune being so yeah i make
[1:01:14] mistakes but not all of me does
[1:01:17] this flesh which hasn't been converted
[1:01:19] and this mind which is
[1:01:20] this spirit's not converted and
[1:01:22] sometimes it thinks wrong
[1:01:24] and sometimes it does wrong but there's
[1:01:26] a part of me
[1:01:29] that's already translated
[1:01:34] and what he has begun he will finish
[1:01:38] so your change is coming it's already
[1:01:42] started so there is a kingdom
[1:01:48] and it's only going to get greater and
[1:01:50] greater brother branham
[1:01:51] that's one of the last things he points
[1:01:53] to us points out to us in the seventh
[1:01:55] seal
[1:01:56] and he just starts talking about he
[1:01:58] doesn't talk about what's happening in
[1:01:59] heaven
[1:02:00] he starts talking about what's happening
[1:02:02] he says right here in this service
[1:02:03] he said we got a leukemia child and a
[1:02:05] cancer patient and this over here and
[1:02:07] this boy and this girl
[1:02:08] and he said what is it he said what is
[1:02:11] it because they had been miraculously
[1:02:13] healed and
[1:02:14] and healed in a different way it seemed
[1:02:16] to be more of the spoken word the power
[1:02:18] of the third pull
[1:02:19] and brother brown says what is it what
[1:02:20] is it friends it's the kingdom coming
[1:02:24] as it has been
[1:02:28] so the kingdom is already among us
[1:02:30] friends don't look for another message
[1:02:32] the kingdom message is here now look for
[1:02:35] another message to give you a rapture
[1:02:37] the rapture message is here
[1:02:39] and all you need is to have faith and
[1:02:41] they say i'm trying to have faith how do
[1:02:43] i get more faith start aligning
[1:02:45] the other two parts of you with the
[1:02:47] inside part of you
[1:02:49] and i'm here to tell you a supernatural
[1:02:51] faith not yours
[1:02:52] his will begin to overtake and it'll
[1:02:55] work in your life
[1:02:58] the devil fears you'll get that
[1:03:02] so he tries every way in the world to
[1:03:04] distract you he's magnificently
[1:03:06] successful
[1:03:08] sometimes i am so impressed with lucifer
[1:03:13] and his ability to dupe god's family
[1:03:16] without a single weapon and brother
[1:03:19] branham said jesus took every weapon
[1:03:21] from him
[1:03:22] and the only weapon he has is a
[1:03:24] psychological warfare weapon
[1:03:26] and he said the only weapon satan has is
[1:03:28] if he can get you to doubt your weapon
[1:03:31] other than that he's a weaponless
[1:03:33] defeated foe
[1:03:35] that we face
[1:03:40] on june the 4th in 1940
[1:03:44] winston churchill stood before the
[1:03:46] parliament of england
[1:03:48] to give an account of the disastrous
[1:03:52] defeat of dunkirk but the
[1:03:56] to announce also the very successful
[1:03:58] unprecedented
[1:04:00] saving of the entire british army
[1:04:04] and it was a feat unparalleled in war
[1:04:07] history
[1:04:08] it stands to this day as a seemingly
[1:04:11] an impossible task because
[1:04:14] literally everybody just ran down they
[1:04:16] didn't have enough navy ships to get
[1:04:18] them home
[1:04:19] so everybody the call went out over the
[1:04:21] radio and
[1:04:22] everybody ran down to their fishing
[1:04:23] boats and got on their fishing trawlers
[1:04:26] and got in their little motorboats
[1:04:28] and crossed the channel at peril with
[1:04:31] with enemy
[1:04:32] aircraft dropping bombs and trying to
[1:04:34] strafe them sometimes
[1:04:35] airplane squadrons a hundred numbering a
[1:04:38] hundred
[1:04:39] just trying to strafe the beaches and
[1:04:41] bomb the boats coming
[1:04:43] and and they went in there and loaded
[1:04:45] the entire
[1:04:46] british expeditionary force evacuated
[1:04:49] them from dunkirk and saved the british
[1:04:51] army
[1:04:51] and got them back across the channel
[1:04:54] and churchill while he acknowledges
[1:04:59] you know belgium's complete defeat
[1:05:03] the likely defeat of france while not
[1:05:06] conceding that they should stop
[1:05:07] fighting gives perhaps the greatest
[1:05:10] speech of his life
[1:05:11] and he had two more that followed it but
[1:05:14] they think that this speech
[1:05:16] probably was the greatest one he ever
[1:05:19] gave you can actually hear
[1:05:21] a recording of it i have a actual
[1:05:24] recording of it it's quite inspirational
[1:05:26] the entire speech about
[1:05:27] 12 13 minutes long but i wanted to come
[1:05:30] to one particular part today
[1:05:32] the most famous i would say by far and
[1:05:35] the most one referred to
[1:05:37] where he's just giving his resolve to
[1:05:39] the british people
[1:05:41] as bad as it looks as dire as the
[1:05:44] situation
[1:05:45] is and he didn't mince words and he
[1:05:47] didn't sugarcoat it
[1:05:49] and he said we should expect an invasion
[1:05:51] of our island
[1:05:53] and they were convinced that that was
[1:05:55] what hitler was going to do and hitler
[1:05:56] was in fact planning to do that
[1:05:59] when you know young airmen
[1:06:02] from the british royal air force took
[1:06:05] off in their spitfires and
[1:06:06] a little thin wall of defense and
[1:06:09] somehow the hand of god helped them
[1:06:11] to repel overwhelming numbers that were
[1:06:14] attacking them
[1:06:16] and churchill saying we should expect it
[1:06:19] because
[1:06:20] it's the next logical move this was
[1:06:23] napoleon's idea this is hitler's idea
[1:06:26] and we should prepare ourselves but he
[1:06:28] wanted to give a resolve
[1:06:31] to the british people that
[1:06:34] invade they might but surrender we won't
[1:06:40] and he said we shall defend our island
[1:06:45] whatever the cost may be
[1:06:48] we shall fight on the beaches we shall
[1:06:51] fight on the landing grounds
[1:06:53] we shall fight in the fields and in the
[1:06:57] streets
[1:06:58] we shall fight in the hills
[1:07:01] we shall never surrender
[1:07:06] and even if he goes on to talk about how
[1:07:09] that even if they do
[1:07:10] occupy this island they won't keep it
[1:07:14] as long as we're alive we will fight
[1:07:19] we finished last time talking about how
[1:07:22] that
[1:07:23] you know and i made that statement to
[1:07:25] you i will never stop
[1:07:26] fighting the devil that he cannot have
[1:07:29] my ground you know why because it's mine
[1:07:36] now it's supremely mine because the
[1:07:38] creator gave it to me
[1:07:41] everybody can run around the world
[1:07:44] national parliaments and governments can
[1:07:46] say
[1:07:47] this is our boundary country and this is
[1:07:49] our country
[1:07:51] you know native americans can say
[1:07:54] this land is our land and you took it
[1:07:56] from us well i only know and i'm not
[1:07:58] i'm not diminishing the the horrors that
[1:08:00] were done to them that this nation is
[1:08:02] still paying for
[1:08:03] but i don't know of but one track of
[1:08:05] land
[1:08:06] that was ever actually deeded to some
[1:08:08] humans
[1:08:10] and that was in palestine in the land of
[1:08:13] israel
[1:08:14] and god sent abraham on a mountain
[1:08:17] and said now look as far as you can see
[1:08:20] northward southward eastward and
[1:08:21] westward
[1:08:22] everything you can see i'm giving it to
[1:08:26] you abraham
[1:08:27] i built it i own it
[1:08:31] i'm giving it to you i don't care what
[1:08:32] those people that live there say
[1:08:35] i don't care what happens in history i
[1:08:37] don't care tyrants
[1:08:38] will rise and fall but this is your land
[1:08:42] and if they dispossess you from it and
[1:08:44] even if i allow it i will take it back
[1:08:47] for you
[1:08:48] and i will bring you back and i will put
[1:08:50] you back on it
[1:08:51] it's your land and you can never lose it
[1:08:55] and i'm here to tell you something
[1:08:56] friends that's our land in the holy
[1:08:58] ghost by the holy ghost

[1:09:02] of jesus back to abraham

[1:09:16] israel
[1:09:17] it's it's more than that i'm reading
[1:09:19] about a city
[1:09:21] i'm reading about a mountain that's not
[1:09:23] even on the earth yet

[1:09:26] heavens and the new earth and i'm going
[1:09:28] to live there because he said i would

[1:09:33] was an overcomer i was in christ
[1:09:35] and i overcome the deception of this
[1:09:37] hour and therefore

[1:09:45] promise of god that i can live above sin

[1:10:15] my peace my tranquility my success
[1:10:17] that's fighting words friends and you
[1:10:19] might as well get used to it now you're
[1:10:21] gonna have to fight
[1:10:22] so come on fight on the beaches fight in
[1:10:25] the streets fight on the landing fight
[1:10:26] in the hills don't ever surrender
[1:10:30] you don't have to surrender you have the
[1:10:31] champion of all champions
[1:10:37] it's promised john saw it it's mine
[1:10:42] i'll not surrender my inheritance
[1:10:45] to the devil without having fought that
[1:10:48] to me would be
[1:10:50] i don't think i could live with that i
[1:10:53] live
[1:10:53] i do i do get through failures
[1:10:57] and i do realize sometimes i get pushed
[1:10:58] off a hill
[1:11:00] but it wasn't because i wasn't fighting
[1:11:04] i mean if i if i lost territory and
[1:11:06] something happened in my home or my
[1:11:08] family or my children and it was because
[1:11:10] i wasn't fighting
[1:11:11] i don't think i could handle that i mean
[1:11:13] we're going to fight it's going to be
[1:11:15] battles you're going to win some you're
[1:11:16] going to lose some
[1:11:18] but don't worry the war is won
[1:11:21] and all he's asking you to do is fight
[1:11:24] and it has nothing to do with the size
[1:11:27] of the dog
[1:11:28] in the fight it's the size and amount of
[1:11:30] the fight that's in the dog
[1:11:33] jesus was not a big man brother branham
[1:11:36] saw him
[1:11:38] brother i'm sorry i'm just hovering
[1:11:40] above and he said i stood there looking
[1:11:42] at him said he was a small man
[1:11:44] he said in stature he might weigh 140
[1:11:46] pounds
[1:11:47] just a small man and he said and
[1:11:50] and he said i saw he said i thought in
[1:11:52] my dreaming i bit my
[1:11:54] finger and he said i'm trying to figure
[1:11:56] out is this a vision because he had had
[1:11:57] those he didn't even call him visions
[1:11:59] early called him a trance
[1:12:01] and he's just a young man and he said i
[1:12:04] i thought i'll get his attention oh he's
[1:12:06] looking he's looking eastward i'm going
[1:12:07] to walk
[1:12:08] around till i can kind of see him i
[1:12:09] don't want to be rude
[1:12:11] and he's trying to clear his throat
[1:12:21] i'd do the same thing
[1:12:27] you know or or maybe you'd be so
[1:12:29] terrified you wouldn't hardly be able to
[1:12:30] make a sound
[1:12:36] and he said i saw the sagebrush blow
[1:12:39] and he said when the sagebrush blew he
[1:12:42] said
[1:12:43] his garment started blowing in the wind
[1:12:47] it was real wasn't just a vision that
[1:12:51] was real
[1:12:53] and he said he looked at me and he said
[1:12:56] i said jesus
[1:12:58] and he said he turned and looked at me
[1:12:59] and put his arms out to me like
[1:13:02] you know welcoming and he said it's the
[1:13:04] last thing i remembered till
[1:13:06] daylight he said it was a look no artist
[1:13:08] could capture
[1:13:10] he said that that hoffman's head of
[1:13:12] christ which we have here
[1:13:14] the hoffman's head is a is a is a um
[1:13:17] what do you call
[1:13:18] a crop of that and and he said that's
[1:13:21] the closest he'd ever seen
[1:13:23] ex but he says except for his size he's
[1:13:25] not that big of a guy
[1:13:28] isn't that amazing every prophecy now
[1:13:30] that looks like him in the face but he's
[1:13:31] not that big
[1:13:32] he's a small man and he said when he
[1:13:35] looked he said no artist could catch
[1:13:36] those eyes
[1:13:38] and he said it looked like that you just
[1:13:40] wanted
[1:13:41] he a man of that that looks so
[1:13:44] so sorrowful that you could just want to
[1:13:47] break down and cry
[1:13:48] he said yet at the same time a look
[1:13:52] that was such a way that if he would
[1:13:54] speak just speak the world would end
[1:13:57] amen well tell you something friends
[1:14:00] that man lives
[1:14:03] in you
[1:14:07] hallelujah and you need to take
[1:14:10] ownership of that today
[1:14:11] and do whatever is necessary to give him
[1:14:16] rulership over the other two fallen
[1:14:19] sides of you he lives in a reborn state
[1:14:22] of you inside that soul and i just say
[1:14:24] lord
[1:14:25] take over my mind take over my life take
[1:14:28] over my body i
[1:14:29] i don't want to lose ground i want to
[1:14:31] gain ground
[1:14:33] i'm not here to sign a treaty with the
[1:14:36] devil i'm not here to give him quarter
[1:14:38] i'm never going to surrender
[1:14:40] and every morning god's mercies are new
[1:14:42] so you know what i do every morning you
[1:14:43] know what i did this morning
[1:14:44] i woke up and nullified the victories of
[1:14:47] satan from the day before
[1:14:48] i took back all my hills hallelujah i
[1:14:51] took back all my land
[1:14:54] hallelujah
[1:14:58] brother branham says in the message
[1:15:01] perseverant
[1:15:05] he says now you're ill you've been into
[1:15:08] a doctor
[1:15:09] see he would advise an operation
[1:15:14] that operation is on the colon yes the
[1:15:17] patient says
[1:15:19] here's another thing you're you're
[1:15:22] desperately in need of a
[1:15:24] spiritual yes amen you haven't been
[1:15:27] feeling right
[1:15:28] you've kind of washed away a little and
[1:15:31] you want to come back
[1:15:33] that's right the man says well
[1:15:36] you're back
[1:15:40] well you wanna you've kind of washed
[1:15:42] away a little bit
[1:15:44] but you wanna come back yes you're back
[1:15:47] congratulations you're back oh my
[1:15:51] well you're back now go believing with
[1:15:54] all your heart
[1:15:55] you'll get well in jesus christ's name
[1:15:58] your sins
[1:15:59] are forgiven you now go believing
[1:16:04] now it's interesting because brother
[1:16:07] branham i didn't continue the quote just
[1:16:09] to save us
[1:16:10] time putting more slides up brother
[1:16:12] branham says he comes back to microphone
[1:16:14] he says hey now did you hear that
[1:16:16] said his sins were forgiven he said now
[1:16:18] you you heard my voice he said but that
[1:16:19] wasn't me that said that
[1:16:21] so that was him he's the only one that
[1:16:22] can say that oh you're
[1:16:24] you're healed and hey your sins are
[1:16:26] forgiven say
[1:16:28] oh well that's not even scriptural it
[1:16:29] sure is scriptural
[1:16:31] that's exactly what jesus said you're he
[1:16:33] forgave their sins and healed their
[1:16:35] sickness
[1:16:35] because it's all in the same atonement
[1:16:38] see
[1:16:39] so so he comes down and and
[1:16:43] and and and the takeaway for me
[1:16:47] is is that any time that
[1:16:50] satan is successful now come on let's be
[1:16:53] real honest today
[1:16:54] sometimes he is sometimes you're
[1:16:58] you you get driven off a hill it doesn't
[1:17:01] mean you're not a child of god
[1:17:03] see sometimes this means a lot of
[1:17:05] corrections headed in
[1:17:07] see sometimes we listen friend to doubt
[1:17:10] any word of god is equal to doubting
[1:17:12] any other word of god so if if you
[1:17:16] if you don't if you don't exercise the
[1:17:19] word of god
[1:17:20] in a transgression and you commit that
[1:17:22] transgression
[1:17:24] that is no worse than looking at a
[1:17:26] promise that he speaks about your
[1:17:27] healing in the atonement and deny that
[1:17:29] and claim your sickness that's just as
[1:17:32] bad that's just as insulting to god
[1:17:34] that's just as much losing a heal or
[1:17:36] losing a hill
[1:17:39] you understand so so anytime
[1:17:42] satan is successful in taking land from
[1:17:45] me
[1:17:45] in any way in any way it happens
[1:17:49] then i'm going to tell you something it
[1:17:51] is a drawn out battle
[1:17:54] it is a drawn out battle because i'm
[1:17:56] going to be
[1:17:57] praying in the mornings i'm going to be
[1:17:59] praying when i go to bed
[1:18:00] i'm going to have a lifestyle of going
[1:18:02] to church i'm going to be reading my
[1:18:04] bible
[1:18:04] i'm going to be listening to tapes i i'm
[1:18:07] it's going to be a long drawn out battle
[1:18:08] and even if i do lose a hill
[1:18:10] it's going to be a big battle because
[1:18:14] i'm
[1:18:14] fighting every day because i just don't
[1:18:17] walk off my land
[1:18:20] that's that's being a christian that's
[1:18:22] what a christian is i might get drove
[1:18:24] off of it by my own
[1:18:26] weakness my own doubt and not taking god
[1:18:29] at his word and not overcoming like i
[1:18:31] could have
[1:18:31] there's no temptation taking you but
[1:18:34] such as his common demand
[1:18:35] get over yourself nobody's picking on
[1:18:38] you
[1:18:40] you ain't special god satan satan
[1:18:43] attacks us all
[1:18:45] you understand but within that
[1:18:47] temptation god makes a way for you to
[1:18:49] escape now he doesn't say you'll take it
[1:18:51] but he does make it
[1:18:54] there is a way and if you don't escape
[1:18:56] and i've had to come to that look at
[1:18:57] that man in the mirror and go you know
[1:18:58] you could have got out of that
[1:19:00] i know and that's what takes me to my
[1:19:02] knees
[1:19:04] come on am i the only part-time center
[1:19:06] in here
[1:19:09] i've passed from death unto life that's
[1:19:10] why i can talk like that because i know
[1:19:12] the devil ain't nobody
[1:19:14] i've already passed from death to life
[1:19:16] i'm in christ i'm in the kingdom
[1:19:17] the lord lives in me and i tell the
[1:19:20] devil all the time you do not matter
[1:19:22] you do not matter you're a big puppet
[1:19:24] that's all you are
[1:19:26] and if even if you're able to pull
[1:19:28] something off on me and bring me to a
[1:19:30] trial well it went past my father
[1:19:32] because i got his promise that you can't
[1:19:34] come after me unless he lets you
[1:19:36] ha
[1:19:40] and so so i don't just walk off my land
[1:19:43] i fight to keep it and it is always come
[1:19:47] on those of you who are born again of
[1:19:49] the holy spirit will identify with this
[1:19:51] it is always a regret in my heart
[1:19:55] if he's able to finally push me off of
[1:19:57] it
[1:19:58] that's the that's a sign of the holy
[1:20:01] ghost birth
[1:20:03] see a failure is not a sign that you
[1:20:07] don't have the holy ghost
[1:20:09] what is a sign that you do is that you
[1:20:12] repent
[1:20:14] else why why did you repent if you
[1:20:16] really wanted to do it the bottom line
[1:20:18] is your flesh might have but the real
[1:20:20] you didn't want to do it that's why i
[1:20:22] repent
[1:20:22] how did i get in that condition of not
[1:20:24] wanting sin because i got born again
[1:20:29] see and so it and so
[1:20:32] it's always a regret truly it's a regret
[1:20:36] in my heart
[1:20:37] if he's able to finally push me off my
[1:20:39] land but it is equally a great sense of
[1:20:42] pleasure
[1:20:43] when i take it back from him in a moment
[1:20:47] like brother branham with the man in the
[1:20:49] line you've been kind of washed away
[1:20:52] you've really got a spiritual need yes
[1:20:54] yes amen that's true
[1:20:55] and you really want you want to come
[1:20:57] back it's been a long battle
[1:20:59] yes and you want to come back yes you're
[1:21:02] back
[1:21:04] the devil's been victorious and you want
[1:21:06] to seem defeated yes he's defeated
[1:21:08] you want to come back to victory don't
[1:21:10] you yes you're back
[1:21:12] i i i fight him every day in a
[1:21:15] protracted battle
[1:21:17] and even if he pushes me off my heel
[1:21:19] he's gonna have to fight me
[1:21:21] but i take great pleasure brother jack
[1:21:24] in walking back up with a blood stain
[1:21:26] banner
[1:21:26] and putting it down like cerebache and
[1:21:29] say i
[1:21:30] claim this mountain and i take it back
[1:21:33] in a moment
[1:21:35] i don't have to go do penance i don't
[1:21:37] have to crawl on glass

[1:25:16] we'll take it right now
[1:25:17] it's yours he's a right now god
[1:25:21] this is the hour you don't have to back
[1:25:22] up from the devil come on you're the
[1:25:24] bride of jesus christ
[1:25:26] he died for you he ascended he gave back
[1:25:28] his life
[1:25:29] who does the devil think he's messing
[1:25:31] with
[1:25:33] there's power in the blood of jesus
[1:25:36] there's power in the name of the word of
[1:25:38] god
[1:25:42] all right now brother branham gives a
[1:25:45] beautiful example car lovers love this
[1:25:47] one where he
[1:25:49] talks about a shined up beautiful i
[1:25:51] think he uses a cadillac even
[1:25:54] and uh simoniz job and i guess that's an
[1:25:57] old-fashioned word for
[1:25:59] buffing and waxing i guess who's old
[1:26:01] brother luther does that mean never mind
[1:26:06] okay thank you sir i'd rather lose my
[1:26:09] buddy he's the one i can pick on
[1:26:13] he gives it back trust me
[1:26:14] [Laughter]
[1:26:18] yeah so so brother branham is shining up
[1:26:20] this car and my
[1:26:22] goodness it's got chrome everything and
[1:26:25] it's
[1:26:25] it's it's beautiful it's luxurious it's
[1:26:28] got a
[1:26:29] powerful engine it's got a tank
[1:26:32] full of gasoline it's it's ready and
[1:26:36] raring to go
[1:26:37] but in order for that car to serve any
[1:26:40] purpose
[1:26:41] other than eye candy you're gonna have
[1:26:44] to get in it turn the switch and there's
[1:26:45] gonna have to be a spark
[1:26:47] happen inside that combustion area to
[1:26:50] ignite that gasoline now that gasoline
[1:26:52] is loaded with power
[1:26:55] it is it it is extremely gasoline is
[1:26:59] extremely volatile
[1:27:01] and the fumes even the fumes can blow up
[1:27:04] so i understand it's very volatile
[1:27:07] substance
[1:27:08] it's filled with power unreleased
[1:27:13] you and brother branham says unless it
[1:27:16] gets a spark
[1:27:18] it might as well be water for all the
[1:27:21] good it would do you now that's true
[1:27:24] i could douse you in water i could douse
[1:27:26] you in gasoline you'd like the gas
[1:27:28] you'd like the water a lot better but
[1:27:30] you wouldn't be in any more danger as
[1:27:32] long as nobody comes around you with a
[1:27:33] match
[1:27:35] the gasoline can't release its power i
[1:27:38] mean water is
[1:27:39] is hydrogen oxygen it has power too but
[1:27:42] gasoline has an incredible amount of
[1:27:44] energy inside of its molecules and what
[1:27:47] happens is when a spark brother branham
[1:27:50] calls it now he talks about mechanics
[1:27:52] and dynamics
[1:27:53] and the mechanics are the word
[1:27:57] it's a car it's got wheels it's got a
[1:27:59] transmission got an engine
[1:28:01] it's got a tank full of gas and one
[1:28:04] place you know we go out here and we try
[1:28:05] to figure out do i need a
[1:28:07] you know 87 octane 89 90
[1:28:10] throw on 93. brother brahm said he he
[1:28:13] in one place calls it this is a hundred
[1:28:15] octane
[1:28:17] another place he says it's a thousand
[1:28:19] octane
[1:28:20] another time he says it's ten thousand
[1:28:22] octane
[1:28:26] oh i i wrote a letter to brother uh
[1:28:29] uh brother doug baker and you know you
[1:28:31] you hear the old joke
[1:28:32] about somebody being a rocket scientist
[1:28:34] and you know i i've done that before one
[1:28:37] time
[1:28:38] you know when i was had a sermon i was
[1:28:39] going to preach and i was
[1:28:41] and brother branham called us astronauts
[1:28:44] and we're in the astronaut age and the
[1:28:45] and it's 10 000
[1:28:46] octane you know and it's no it's not the
[1:28:48] horse and bugging it's not the car
[1:28:50] it's not the airplane we're blasting off
[1:28:52] and so i
[1:28:53] i needed some items in best buy and i
[1:28:55] walked in
[1:28:56] and i walked up to the counter i don't
[1:28:58] know what about me made them think to
[1:29:00] ask me these questions
[1:29:01] and uh seemed like i needed some some um
[1:29:06] a way to i was looking at a projector
[1:29:08] and some things i was gonna i said well
[1:29:09] i'm teaching
[1:29:10] a class and uh they said oh said what do
[1:29:13] you what do you what do you do for a
[1:29:14] living i said i'm a rocket scientist
[1:29:18] like four or five of those black shirts
[1:29:20] uh what do they call them you know at
[1:29:22] best buy
[1:29:24] i said now hold on i'm a spiritual
[1:29:27] rocket scientist
[1:29:28] they were like what's that
[1:29:32] but brother doug baker is actually a
[1:29:33] real rocket scientist and so
[1:29:36] you know he he's the real deal and so i
[1:29:37] wrote to him uh yesterday and asked him
[1:29:39] about what's what's with this 10 000
[1:29:41] octane
[1:29:42] uh brother doug is that rocket fuel how
[1:29:44] is that working and he gave me this
[1:29:46] long little you know scientific which i
[1:29:48] love that kind of stuff he gave me this
[1:29:49] long scientific paper
[1:29:51] and he kept apologizing i'm sorry to go
[1:29:53] so far he said but the only way to
[1:29:54] explain is to explain it all and i'm
[1:29:55] like i love it keep it coming
[1:29:57] got a whole sermon out of it i'm going
[1:29:58] to preach amen
[1:30:01] amen and so so so we find that this
[1:30:04] that this word that you have in this day
[1:30:07] is a hundred no a thousand no ten
[1:30:09] thousand octane it's got a lot of
[1:30:13] power but it's gotta have a spark
[1:30:19] so brother branham now in god's provided
[1:30:21] place of worship
[1:30:24] he says here all right he says now
[1:30:28] and that's what's the matter with the
[1:30:30] church today
[1:30:31] we're full of theology
[1:30:35] without any dynamics in it that's right
[1:30:38] see
[1:30:39] in other words you've got to have a
[1:30:42] spark
[1:30:42] to the gasoline or the gasoline is no
[1:30:45] more than
[1:30:46] it's it's not even as good as water as
[1:30:49] long as it hasn't got the spark of fire
[1:30:51] to it
[1:30:52] now that's a true statement you can't
[1:30:54] drink it
[1:30:56] it can't save your life unless you're
[1:30:58] gonna burn
[1:30:59] gasoline it's a it's a worthless element
[1:31:03] it has no value but to stink up your
[1:31:05] garage and
[1:31:06] contaminate your driveway and get on
[1:31:08] your hands you got to go wash them
[1:31:10] it's dangerous the fumes are dangerous
[1:31:12] unless unless you're going to put it
[1:31:14] in a gasoline-fired engine and use it
[1:31:18] it's worthless so they send their
[1:31:21] preachers to bible study for years and
[1:31:24] years and years and they fill up their
[1:31:26] tank with gasoline
[1:31:28] and it's you know it's it's not pure
[1:31:30] gasoline but at least it's gasoline they
[1:31:32] they can get something out of it the
[1:31:34] problem is they never get a spark
[1:31:36] and so all it does is stink up a church
[1:31:40] and stink up people's lives and nobody's
[1:31:43] ever cleaned because they're just
[1:31:44] getting doused in gasoline i don't want
[1:31:46] any dousing gasoline
[1:31:47] give me the water of the word put up put
[1:31:50] a
[1:31:50] put a flame to it and i'm here to tell
[1:31:52] you you got a 10 000 octane something
[1:31:55] that'll take that vehicle down the road
[1:31:58] it'll cause the blind to see it'll cause
[1:32:00] the death to hear the lame to walk
[1:32:02] it'll cause the loss to get saved it'll
[1:32:04] give the holy ghost to your children and
[1:32:06] your family
[1:32:06] it'll cast out devils we're going to
[1:32:10] tell you some friend this word i've said
[1:32:11] it to you so many
[1:32:12] times god didn't send a prophet his
[1:32:14] seventh and last star
[1:32:15] just to fill your head full of gasoline
[1:32:20] it's not about greater theology it's
[1:32:22] about a life
[1:32:23] we're part of a kingdom a kingdom of
[1:32:26] priests a kingdom of saints
[1:32:28] a kingdom of christ's a kingdom of
[1:32:31] messiahs
[1:32:33] hallelujah so he says it has to have a
[1:32:38] spark
[1:32:40] as long as it hasn't got the spark of
[1:32:42] fog
[1:32:43] to fire it so that's the way so now
[1:32:47] so now dynamic power let me get caught
[1:32:51] up to myself here
[1:32:54] all right so now so when we talk about
[1:32:57] dynamic power now watch this
[1:33:03] there is a dynamic power
[1:33:06] to disappear this bride
[1:33:09] you understand that there is a dynamic
[1:33:12] power
[1:33:14] upon the word and brother branham said
[1:33:17] when the
[1:33:17] when the dynamics come on the
[1:33:20] mechanics that you're feeding on
[1:33:24] dynamics hit that then mechanics
[1:33:28] become dynamics
[1:33:32] so in other words the word that you
[1:33:35] are feeding upon turns you into the fire
[1:33:39] that ignites you
[1:33:40] the fire that ignites you is jesus
[1:33:42] christ
[1:33:43] so what does it turn you into misses
[1:33:45] jesus christ
[1:33:48] amen that's not just fancy language
[1:33:51] that's not just you know
[1:33:53] lofty thinking that's reality
[1:33:58] so there is enough dynamic power now in
[1:34:01] this
[1:34:01] word that we have to literally disappear
[1:34:05] a bride around the world
[1:34:06] in a moment in an instant
[1:34:10] in the blink of an eye power's not the
[1:34:16] problem
[1:34:18] power's not the problem the gasoline got
[1:34:21] loads of power locked up in it
[1:34:24] the fire of the holy ghost is not not
[1:34:28] the problem god's not
[1:34:29] lacking in what he has for this church
[1:34:32] what the problem in too many of god's
[1:34:35] children and hear me as i'm calling you
[1:34:37] god's children
[1:34:39] because what makes you a child of god
[1:34:40] because you're a christian no
[1:34:42] that's only when you found out you
[1:34:44] already were
[1:34:46] you understand you didn't become a
[1:34:48] christian you found out you just started
[1:34:49] cooperating in the vision
[1:34:52] when you got born again so we find out
[1:34:55] that
[1:34:55] that what is missing in too many
[1:34:57] children of god
[1:34:58] is a personal experience
[1:35:02] with the source
[1:35:05] of the fire a personal experience
[1:35:10] we feel revelation of the word
[1:35:14] and a lot of times people end up
[1:35:20] in a place of false security sons and
[1:35:22] daughters of god sit in message churches
[1:35:25] sometimes for years sometimes decades
[1:35:29] they believe the word they believe the
[1:35:31] teachings
[1:35:32] and they have a gene of god
[1:35:36] they listen peter understood who jesus
[1:35:38] was because of the gene of god
[1:35:40] long before he ever got the new birth i
[1:35:43] understand
[1:35:44] that gene was enough to recognize you're
[1:35:46] the christ the son of the living god
[1:35:48] and jesus says blessed art thou simon
[1:35:51] you know you
[1:35:52] no man told you that god gave you that
[1:35:55] so there's lots of people
[1:35:57] with god-given understanding of prophecy
[1:36:01] peter was understanding a modern event
[1:36:03] made clear
[1:36:05] this was the word that was prophesied to
[1:36:07] come and stand in a human being virgin
[1:36:09] born and be the son of god and peter
[1:36:10] connected the dots and said you're the
[1:36:12] one
[1:36:13] he still wasn't converted and sometimes
[1:36:17] we
[1:36:17] we we feel that because we have a
[1:36:21] a revelation of the word and we say i
[1:36:24] have a
[1:36:24] a gene seed of god and i agree
[1:36:28] with the teachings of the message but
[1:36:31] clearly
[1:36:32] clearly it's more than that
[1:36:36] and it must be more than that
[1:36:45] the message of the hour
[1:36:48] is not doctrine it's a person of christ
[1:36:52] the word and it's got to become a
[1:36:54] reality
[1:36:56] in your heart and when it does it
[1:36:59] becomes
[1:37:00] something something that you you you
[1:37:03] to you personally that that that's far
[1:37:07] more
[1:37:08] than agreement with doctrine the new
[1:37:11] birth becomes
[1:37:12] so much more than that to you it's more
[1:37:15] than just agreement with doctrine
[1:37:18] it it it was always to be a personal
[1:37:21] thing of revelation when you come into
[1:37:24] contact with christ
[1:37:26] and and and while listen
[1:37:29] the experience of the new birth
[1:37:32] while it often can affect you and often
[1:37:35] does and you hear testimonies from
[1:37:36] people say
[1:37:37] i i got the holy ghost and this happened
[1:37:39] to me in this sensation i shouted dance
[1:37:41] ran screamed
[1:37:42] loved everybody for two weeks and felt
[1:37:44] dizzy and i mean there's all kinds of
[1:37:46] things that can happen
[1:37:47] all of it be perfectly god doing it
[1:37:51] see but you got to understand it's
[1:37:54] always got to be something personal to
[1:37:56] you
[1:37:56] while it can have often have an effect
[1:38:00] affect you physically in profound
[1:38:04] profound physical ways it's i want to
[1:38:07] say it like this
[1:38:08] it's beyond physical amen
[1:38:12] it's more real than physical
[1:38:17] physical is such a shallow way to think
[1:38:19] of the new birth some physical emotion
[1:38:22] or sensation
[1:38:23] this is something that's more real than
[1:38:26] physical
[1:38:26] and that's why it has always been folly
[1:38:29] to
[1:38:30] to to label it as any describable
[1:38:34] physical experience see
[1:38:38] because it's deeper than that it's
[1:38:41] deeper than something i can feel
[1:38:44] it's something deeper than
[1:38:48] you can even explain
[1:38:52] you know it's there it's hard to put
[1:38:54] into words
[1:38:56] only a person who has had the same
[1:38:58] experience
[1:38:59] says i get it they don't even have to
[1:39:02] pass words you just go you know there's
[1:39:03] that
[1:39:06] yeah oh it's changed my whole life and
[1:39:08] and and people around you start going oh
[1:39:10] tears start rolling they're not even one
[1:39:11] telling the story and they're crying
[1:39:12] listening to yours because they're
[1:39:13] remembering their experience
[1:39:16] this is something that brother branham
[1:39:19] was talking about how it's missing and
[1:39:21] and so so it's something that's deeper
[1:39:24] than you can even explain and and hence
[1:39:26] brother branham's description of it
[1:39:28] as a personal revelation a personal
[1:39:32] revelation uh a a
[1:39:35] it's a it's a reality of happening
[1:39:38] within you
[1:39:39] that is so profound it changes you
[1:39:42] into a brand new person
[1:39:47] that's not a light statement brother
[1:39:50] branham called you
[1:39:52] a brand new unit
[1:39:55] paul said old things are passed away
[1:39:59] all things have become new i'm not here
[1:40:03] to put something as a carrot so far out
[1:40:05] there you just sit here and say
[1:40:07] man i can never attain that you probably
[1:40:10] have more attained it than you even are
[1:40:12] aware of and the devil's got you you
[1:40:14] know
[1:40:15] afraid because you got this weakness or
[1:40:17] that weakness but
[1:40:18] tell me about your heart tell me about
[1:40:21] your love for god
[1:40:22] and your love for his word tell me how
[1:40:24] that you don't want to sin anymore
[1:40:26] i'll start to tell you about the holy
[1:40:28] ghost tell me you wanna you love
[1:40:31] righteousness and you love purity and
[1:40:32] you regret your weaknesses
[1:40:34] now you're starting to get to an
[1:40:36] experience friends
[1:40:41] brother branham says here in christ is
[1:40:44] the mystery i i don't have it on the
[1:40:46] slide i i added it later
[1:40:48] after i was completed with the
[1:40:50] powerpoint brother branham says what is
[1:40:52] the new birth then you say well brother
[1:40:54] branham what is the new birth
[1:40:56] now i'm going to read this quotes to you
[1:40:57] upside down
[1:40:59] because i'm going to read you what he
[1:41:02] said
[1:41:03] after something he said that i'm going
[1:41:05] to read you
[1:41:06] second does that make sense
[1:41:10] well brother branham what is the new
[1:41:12] birth it's the revelation of jesus
[1:41:15] christ personally to you see
[1:41:18] not you joined a church you shook a hand
[1:41:20] you done something different you said a
[1:41:21] creed you promised to live by a coat of
[1:41:23] rules
[1:41:24] but christ the bible he is the word
[1:41:28] that was revealed to you and no matter
[1:41:30] what anybody says what takes place it's
[1:41:32] christ
[1:41:33] pastor priest whatever it might be
[1:41:36] it's christ in you that is the
[1:41:38] revelation
[1:41:40] that the church was built on
[1:41:45] now he says further or
[1:41:48] prior look christ in you
[1:41:52] so here here say well then okay bring it
[1:41:54] down and give me some brass tacks
[1:41:57] so that i can have a north star
[1:41:58] somewhere i need to get my bearings
[1:42:00] on my spiritual condition all right i'm
[1:42:02] going to do that for you
[1:42:04] christ in you makes him
[1:42:07] the center of life of the revelation
[1:42:11] say i got a revelation of this message
[1:42:13] well let's look at your life
[1:42:16] and i'll give you a doctor's opinion i'm
[1:42:19] a spiritual doctor
[1:42:20] and i'll give you my my spiritual
[1:42:22] medical opinion on whether or not
[1:42:24] you've got what you think you have if
[1:42:27] you have
[1:42:28] a real revelation of this message that's
[1:42:30] not doctrinal theology
[1:42:31] that's a an intimate relationship with
[1:42:34] the person of the word
[1:42:36] see and what it does is
[1:42:39] it makes him the center of the life of
[1:42:42] the revelation see
[1:42:44] christ's life in you
[1:42:47] makes him the center of the revelation
[1:42:49] christ in the bride
[1:42:51] makes the bible the complete revelation
[1:42:53] of christ
[1:42:55] that's a strange statement christ in the
[1:42:58] bride listen to what he says
[1:43:00] christ in the bible all right makes the
[1:43:03] bib
[1:43:04] christ in the bible makes the bible um
[1:43:07] let me back up in the center of the
[1:43:09] revelation all right here it is christ
[1:43:10] in the bible makes the bible the
[1:43:12] complete revelation of christ
[1:43:14] christ in you makes you the complete
[1:43:17] revelation of the whole thing
[1:43:19] then you see what god is trying to do so
[1:43:22] the whole validity
[1:43:26] of the bible is the fact that you're
[1:43:30] it amen so
[1:43:33] why does why do i validate the bible
[1:43:34] because you were born a sinner
[1:43:37] and you had no way to be this and when
[1:43:40] you suddenly are this
[1:43:42] and this comes off the page and starts
[1:43:44] getting written behind skin and you
[1:43:45] start living it
[1:43:46] it you validate this
[1:43:49] that's that's the dynamics on the
[1:43:52] mechanics
[1:43:53] that's a kingdom that's a church with
[1:43:56] authority
[1:43:59] see all right let me go to my next slide
[1:44:03] uh this one all right
[1:44:06] it's not sh
[1:44:12] witching oh there we go
[1:44:15] beautiful okay no matter what
[1:44:18] watch no matter how well we're taught
[1:44:23] how well we'll believe
[1:44:26] and how much can't you read along with
[1:44:28] me
[1:44:29] and how much of the bible that we say is
[1:44:32] true
[1:44:33] and we believe it all true it's got to
[1:44:36] be the dynamics has got to be there
[1:44:39] the spark to set that word of fire
[1:44:42] and make it start rolling that's the
[1:44:45] whole purpose i have in a car
[1:44:48] and i ain't got a car i'm not jay leno i
[1:44:50] i can't fill a garage full of cars i can
[1:44:52] go stare at
[1:44:53] i got to have a truck because i got to
[1:44:55] drive
[1:44:56] i don't want to walk to walmart i don't
[1:44:58] want to go to walmart at all but i don't
[1:45:00] want to walk anywhere i go
[1:45:02] i got to have a truck the purpose of
[1:45:04] having it the reason i pay payments on
[1:45:06] it
[1:45:07] is because i'm going to use it god
[1:45:09] didn't put you here as just a trophy
[1:45:11] bride
[1:45:12] you're here to be a kingdom of christ
[1:45:15] you're not you're you're
[1:45:16] you're when you're sitting on a cell on
[1:45:18] the hill as a light
[1:45:19] that that's an activity that's not you
[1:45:21] to stand up there with a smile on your
[1:45:23] face
[1:45:24] that's the life of the word living out
[1:45:26] of you
[1:45:27] because the life is the light of men
[1:45:31] hallelujah if there's no life there's no
[1:45:34] light
[1:45:37] see so
[1:45:41] so he says it's got to put the word
[1:45:44] of fire and make it start rolling it's
[1:45:46] got to have that
[1:45:48] if you don't the church sits still
[1:45:51] the car sits still you'll sit still
[1:45:55] i don't want to sit still i don't want a
[1:45:58] church that sets steel
[1:46:00] i don't want a kingdom i don't want to
[1:46:02] be a part of a kingdom that's set
[1:46:04] still come on we're marching to zion
[1:46:10] you got a purpose for being here i
[1:46:13] challenge you today to accept the
[1:46:15] purpose of god
[1:46:16] in your life and say today jesus make me
[1:46:20] the perfect vision of every purpose you
[1:46:22] have in my life
[1:46:27] no matter who no matter
[1:46:32] how much you say
[1:46:35] i sympathize i believe
[1:46:38] every word of that you've got to have
[1:46:41] something to spark that
[1:46:43] off to make that 100 octane go to firing
[1:46:48] and the big church of god go to moving
[1:46:50] on
[1:46:51] it's got to take the dynamics with the
[1:46:54] mechanics
[1:46:55] nothing wrong with the mechanics but
[1:46:57] lacking
[1:46:59] dynamics
[1:47:03] as a pastor
[1:47:07] quite naturally i'm sure that you would
[1:47:09] understand that my concern
[1:47:12] very naturally
[1:47:15] is that is that you have that
[1:47:18] supernatural spark
[1:47:22] to ignite the word the gasoline
[1:47:25] that you say you believe in that you're
[1:47:26] feeding on
[1:47:28] first of all you're going to need to
[1:47:30] feed on it if you want to have anything
[1:47:32] to ignite
[1:47:34] carr can man that electronic ignition
[1:47:37] can be firing
[1:47:38] every one of them spark plugs firing all
[1:47:40] the wires everything hitting good
[1:47:42] but you ain't got no gasoline in that
[1:47:43] tank
[1:47:45] you ain't going nowhere you ain't gonna
[1:47:47] get it running
[1:47:48] you're going to be pushing it why would
[1:47:51] i push a car i can drive
[1:47:54] say well that'd be crazy well then then
[1:47:56] which then then look at our lives and
[1:47:58] say
[1:47:59] sometimes we just have to listen friends
[1:48:00] sometimes you got to be honest enough to
[1:48:02] go
[1:48:02] man look at that man the mirror and go
[1:48:03] man you're crazy here you are pushing
[1:48:06] your way through life when you got a
[1:48:08] perfect engine and gasoline and a spark
[1:48:10] and this thing could take off and pass
[1:48:12] everybody
[1:48:13] amen what do we want as a church bethel
[1:48:16] tabernacle
[1:48:17] those of you here those of you who are
[1:48:19] streaming at home the the other half of
[1:48:21] the alphabet what is it we want
[1:48:22] friends i'm here to tell you i want a
[1:48:24] fire breathing church
[1:48:26] i want something that can burn the
[1:48:28] robber i want something that can go down
[1:48:30] the track and beat everybody else
[1:48:32] i want to set new speed records i want
[1:48:34] to do something for the kingdom of god
[1:48:36] i don't want to sit still
[1:48:39] hallelujah i don't want to get
[1:48:41] comfortable
[1:48:42] we get so comfortable laodicea is
[1:48:45] designed
[1:48:46] to cuddle you
[1:48:49] rub you caress you
[1:48:52] go to sleep little baby
[1:48:57] why why so he can destroy your life
[1:49:02] so he can invade your home there's no
[1:49:03] strong man there see
[1:49:07] so as a pastor my concern naturally then
[1:49:10] is that you have that supernatural spark
[1:49:12] to ignite the gasoline you're feeding on
[1:49:15] i'm not okay
[1:49:16] i'm not okay brother jason is not okay
[1:49:19] with you
[1:49:20] just having a tank full of gas
[1:49:24] i appreciate the ministry of this church
[1:49:26] it fills up your tank
[1:49:29] let me tell you something friends god
[1:49:30] has gifted bethel tabernacle with some
[1:49:32] incredible ministry
[1:49:34] preaching teaching encouraging
[1:49:36] strengthening devil
[1:49:38] casting out preaching we've got that
[1:49:40] here but i'm not
[1:49:41] satisfied with you just having a tank
[1:49:44] full of gas
[1:49:45] and no spark to turn mechanics into
[1:49:48] dynamics
[1:49:54] here's another quote i don't have a
[1:49:56] slide for but i want to use it
[1:50:00] it is the rising of the sun but oh i'm
[1:50:02] so glad that there is a 10
[1:50:04] 000 octane power the word of
[1:50:07] god and the holy ghost to light it up
[1:50:13] but brother jason i thought that you
[1:50:15] have told us the seed gene is the trump
[1:50:17] card of it all and
[1:50:19] it's all election by origin and if i've
[1:50:21] got to see
[1:50:22] gene of god listen friends the devil
[1:50:24] would love to side track you with that
[1:50:26] very valid argument
[1:50:27] that's a very true argument that's a
[1:50:29] truth in the scripture all
[1:50:30] all the father hath given me will come
[1:50:32] to me that's not
[1:50:34] the issue here i'm talking about being
[1:50:36] able to get in
[1:50:37] jesus being able to get in his car and
[1:50:40] go down the road
[1:50:42] you understand i'm not talking about you
[1:50:43] getting into heaven that's john's
[1:50:44] already saw it you're gonna be there
[1:50:46] i'm talking about the lord jesus saying
[1:50:48] i need to run an errand i need a truck
[1:50:49] real quick oh there's one right there
[1:50:51] and drop right down into me or drop
[1:50:52] right down into you
[1:50:53] i did there there's there's a there's a
[1:50:55] young person at that school
[1:50:56] and i i need a car real quick that i can
[1:50:58] drive up those hallways and go witness
[1:51:00] to her
[1:51:00] oh there's a young lady who's a
[1:51:02] christian who loves me i'll go get in
[1:51:03] her and i'll go witness to that sinner
[1:51:06] hallelujah friend you think that's fairy
[1:51:07] tales that's how god operates
[1:51:11] that's how he operates he's looking
[1:51:14] every day to be a witness through his
[1:51:16] family
[1:51:17] why i heard the testimony sister needham
[1:51:19] brother ken and and the persecution
[1:51:21] they're come on
[1:51:22] they've come under and and and and jesus
[1:51:25] always went to stuff like that brother
[1:51:26] branham was the most criticized paul was
[1:51:28] the most criticized to this day
[1:51:30] people hate paul's so bad they they
[1:51:32] criticize him 2000 years
[1:51:34] after he died come on you think they're
[1:51:37] not going to go after william branham
[1:51:38] he's only been gone
[1:51:39] 50 some years they go after paul he's
[1:51:41] been gone 2 000 years and they still go
[1:51:44] after him
[1:51:45] still call him a woman hater still say
[1:51:47] he it was a hostile takeover of the
[1:51:49] church and he was a secret sinner
[1:51:51] oh there's a website against william
[1:51:53] brano every one of you bring me i'll
[1:51:55] show you
[1:51:55] five against jesus
[1:51:59] bring me bring me one of william branham
[1:52:00] i'll show you two or three about
[1:52:02] christianity and the apostle paul
[1:52:05] that what's what's new about that's not
[1:52:07] original that's not new
[1:52:09] that's just dummies
[1:52:12] who don't want it to be true too bad it
[1:52:14] is
[1:52:17] it's got 10 000 octane so so
[1:52:20] you know this whole idea of the seed
[1:52:22] gene of god
[1:52:23] and this is exactly why you know so
[1:52:27] many too many say how many too many
[1:52:31] you know who are actual seed gene
[1:52:35] children of god they were born that way
[1:52:38] some of them have already made their way
[1:52:40] into message churches have already been
[1:52:42] baptized
[1:52:43] and have all already believing and
[1:52:45] already got tanks full of gasoline
[1:52:48] and never have had the spark that could
[1:52:51] give the car
[1:52:52] power so that jesus could drive around
[1:52:54] in their life
[1:52:58] never live to the potential of
[1:53:01] god's vision for them
[1:53:04] say is that possible yup
[1:53:09] they did an article i read recently
[1:53:13] i thought it was astonishing brother
[1:53:15] branham deals with this
[1:53:16] that's how i knew how credible it was
[1:53:20] brother branham talks about uh
[1:53:24] brother sheridan and they were breeding
[1:53:27] cattle
[1:53:29] and and brother branham brother brown he
[1:53:32] said you know i'm
[1:53:32] i'm against all that inner breeding kind
[1:53:34] of stuff we ought to leave nature the
[1:53:35] way nature
[1:53:35] is he was against hybrid anything and so
[1:53:39] he
[1:53:39] brother branham talks about that in the
[1:53:41] in the breeding of bulls and he said
[1:53:42] i've
[1:53:43] i've looked under the microscope to see
[1:53:44] the the male seed
[1:53:46] how it fertilizes the egg and brother
[1:53:48] branham talks about one in a million
[1:53:49] you're familiar with that so so we find
[1:53:52] then
[1:53:53] just let me give you some some science
[1:53:55] here there
[1:53:56] there are about 40 million
[1:54:00] as a minimum to 1.2
[1:54:04] billion male sperm cells in a discharge
[1:54:09] so when they're breeding these cattle
[1:54:12] and and this is a
[1:54:13] this is every animal this is from human
[1:54:15] to cattle to monkeys to everything these
[1:54:16] these numbers all
[1:54:17] line out and there's about anywhere from
[1:54:21] 40 million to 1.2 billion
[1:54:24] that comes from that bull and
[1:54:27] there it's released with every discharge
[1:54:30] now watch this watch these numbers
[1:54:32] 40 million to 1.2 billion
[1:54:35] in the discharge yet
[1:54:39] only 2 million of these persistent
[1:54:42] swimmers
[1:54:43] actually reach the cervix
[1:54:47] for the 2 million seed that inner
[1:54:50] the female cervix around
[1:54:53] one million actually make it to the
[1:54:56] uterus
[1:54:58] for the one million cells that actually
[1:55:01] reach the uterus
[1:55:02] only about 10 000 make it to the top of
[1:55:04] the uterus
[1:55:06] for the 10 000 cells that make it to
[1:55:08] this point
[1:55:09] only around half of them actually go in
[1:55:12] the right direction heading to the egg
[1:55:13] cell
[1:55:15] for the nearly 5 thousand seed
[1:55:19] that make it to the utero tubal junction
[1:55:24] only around one thousand of these reach
[1:55:26] the inside of the fallopian tube
[1:55:29] for the one thousand that enter the tube
[1:55:31] only around 200 are
[1:55:33] actually reach the egg in the end
[1:55:36] only one cell out of this group of 200
[1:55:40] actually penetrates and fertilizes the
[1:55:44] egg
[1:55:46] and brother branham is saying you're
[1:55:47] talking about one in a million
[1:55:49] that was child's place one in 40 million
[1:55:52] to 1.2 billion
[1:55:54] and one and it just keeps reducing keeps
[1:55:56] reducing keeps reducing people
[1:55:58] people hate election by origin but you
[1:56:00] can see it in nature
[1:56:02] and so the magic of conception then
[1:56:07] then then you've got the whole time
[1:56:08] because the magic of conception this is
[1:56:10] why an animal breeding you see
[1:56:12] that's where brother brown said the fall
[1:56:13] of a of a
[1:56:15] human female animal that that was part
[1:56:19] of that shows that she fell from grace
[1:56:21] because
[1:56:21] she can have that act all the time but
[1:56:23] in nature it's not like that
[1:56:24] in nature you you can have the bulls and
[1:56:27] the cows you can have the
[1:56:28] dogs and the female dogs running around
[1:56:30] the yard it won't matter but if one of
[1:56:31] them comes in heat you better put
[1:56:32] somebody up
[1:56:34] and we find that that it can only happen
[1:56:38] you know during this time and and in
[1:56:40] this certain week
[1:56:42] uh once once that has once that act has
[1:56:45] happened
[1:56:45] and and you you get survivability rates
[1:56:48] and i don't want to get too deep into
[1:56:49] the science of this
[1:56:50] but i want to i want to read this so the
[1:56:52] male cells are capable of surviving
[1:56:55] more than six days in the female body
[1:56:59] research has shown
[1:57:02] that the research has shown
[1:57:05] that visible visible that you can see
[1:57:08] with your naked eye under a microscope
[1:57:11] that visible zinc sparks
[1:57:15] are released along with calcium levels
[1:57:18] at the time
[1:57:19] of fertilization when that one in a
[1:57:22] million when that one in 40
[1:57:24] million to 1.2 billion gets in the egg
[1:57:27] and fertilizes it zinc sparks are
[1:57:30] released
[1:57:30] along with calcium levels and this
[1:57:33] fertilization releases
[1:57:35] a flash of light
[1:57:38] and according to scientists the size of
[1:57:41] the zinc sparks
[1:57:43] the zinc spark determines the eggs the
[1:57:45] egg's ability to grow
[1:57:47] and into a healthy embryo
[1:57:50] and here brother branham is saying
[1:57:54] here we got plenty of mechanics but
[1:57:56] without a spark
[1:57:58] without a flash of light say what is the
[1:58:00] holy ghost it's a flash of life
[1:58:03] because life is the light halloween god
[1:58:05] is even testifying
[1:58:07] in nature itself you have every
[1:58:10] mechanical part
[1:58:11] of a son of god as a gene as a seed gene
[1:58:14] of god you've got every mechanical part
[1:58:16] as a son of god from the foundation of
[1:58:18] the world but you still
[1:58:20] have to have that supernatural
[1:58:23] experience
[1:58:24] there has to sparks have to fly
[1:58:27] it has to be a light that is seen
[1:58:30] hallelujah
[1:58:32] if it's something in the natural you can
[1:58:34] better believe it's in the spiritual
[1:58:36] and i want to know that i've had the
[1:58:38] spark i want to know i've had the flesh
[1:58:40] of light
[1:58:42] i want to know that i have conceived in
[1:58:44] me the life of the lord jesus christ
[1:58:49] why do i need that to unlock all that
[1:58:51] power
[1:58:53] all that power to do what i listen
[1:58:55] friends oh
[1:58:57] power to power to move mountains power
[1:58:59] to speak storms
[1:59:00] i don't need to go to palestine and move
[1:59:02] a mountain to fulfill jesus words
[1:59:04] i don't have to stand on a mount in
[1:59:06] colorado to to speak a storm out of
[1:59:08] existence
[1:59:09] how about i speak to the mountains and
[1:59:10] storms in my life
[1:59:13] how about we have enough fire and spark
[1:59:15] and light on the word of god
[1:59:16] to have the holy ghost take over our
[1:59:18] homes and our lives
[1:59:21] unlocking the power to live out the
[1:59:23] portion
[1:59:24] of the word to live out the portion
[1:59:29] to live out to live out the portion of
[1:59:33] the word
[1:59:34] for your day brother branham says here
[1:59:39] in
[1:59:40] the ever pro wow i'm gonna
[1:59:44] i'm gonna wrap up here right brother
[1:59:46] branham says i just got
[1:59:48] a few quotes i wanna i wanna get you
[1:59:49] these quotes and we'll stop
[1:59:51] ever present water from the rock
[1:59:55] says tell them repent and be baptized
[1:59:58] in the name of jesus christ for the
[2:00:01] remission of their sins and these signs
[2:00:04] shall follow them that believe now
[2:00:06] you're back on the road
[2:00:07] back to the same water the same water
[2:00:11] will give the same refreshments it will
[2:00:13] give the same scourge to the body it
[2:00:16] will
[2:00:17] it'll give the same cleansing power
[2:00:20] it'll give the same healing power it'll
[2:00:23] do the same thing it did then
[2:00:25] if we'll only get back to the same
[2:00:27] spirit
[2:00:29] now do you think that's poetic license
[2:00:31] or brother branham just trying to be
[2:00:33] like walt disney and make you feel good
[2:00:34] or is that the word of god see
[2:00:38] watch next slide all right
[2:00:43] let me get to the next one
[2:00:47] now i love this watch
[2:00:51] life in a grapevine will bring forth
[2:00:53] grapes
[2:00:54] you know why that's true because genesis
[2:00:56] said every seed to bring forth of its
[2:00:58] kind
[2:01:00] if it did last year it'll bring the same
[2:01:03] this year that's the law of god
[2:01:04] the law of god is that if this is a
[2:01:07] grapevine
[2:01:08] leave it alone it'll produce grapes
[2:01:12] see if you have the real spark of life
[2:01:15] in you i can pretty much leave you alone
[2:01:19] if i had a whole church with everybody
[2:01:21] with the spark
[2:01:23] and the gasoline on fire you know
[2:01:26] i wouldn't have to preach against sin at
[2:01:28] all i could just stand here and we could
[2:01:30] talk about the glories of god
[2:01:32] and every time a devil poked his head in
[2:01:33] the back door we bash him and he and he
[2:01:36] would get tired of coming around
[2:01:38] amen that's that's a book of acts church
[2:01:42] that's what i'm after that's what's
[2:01:44] promised to us in this last day
[2:01:46] amen a promise of the return of that
[2:01:48] church
[2:01:50] so he says you can interbreed it
[2:01:54] with something else while it's on my
[2:01:58] mind matt
[2:01:59] that looks perfect but this and that
[2:02:02] are not they're not correct that and
[2:02:04] that's perfect
[2:02:05] in framing so just just a note to self
[2:02:08] so watch what he says you can interbreed
[2:02:11] it
[2:02:12] with something else but then leave it
[2:02:13] alone
[2:02:15] and it'll come right back to the same
[2:02:17] grapes again next one watch
[2:02:19] he says so we've interbred the church
[2:02:23] with pentecostalism i love this term
[2:02:27] baptistism methodism
[2:02:30] presbyterianism with anglicanism
[2:02:33] and every other kind of an ism why don't
[2:02:37] you
[2:02:37] leave it alone come back to the vine
[2:02:40] it'll come back to the same power amen
[2:02:43] amen
[2:02:44] i i he says amen amen i like that
[2:02:47] now so
[2:02:51] we can talk about the fact that you know
[2:02:54] if i if i took this segment of my sermon
[2:02:57] i would speak to people who have had an
[2:03:00] experience of the holy ghost
[2:03:02] but who have grown cold
[2:03:06] coveted has went a long way into making
[2:03:09] some people cold
[2:03:12] see how about if i add
[2:03:15] to pentecostal baptist methodist
[2:03:18] presbyterian anglicanism and all the
[2:03:20] other isms
[2:03:21] how about we add this one not to add to
[2:03:23] brother branham but we could add easily
[2:03:25] worldlyism carnalism see
[2:03:29] and so this this is my concern
[2:03:32] for revival because i know that the
[2:03:36] promise of the word of god is
[2:03:38] we have the bride's revival
[2:03:41] and these elements and things that are
[2:03:43] happening in the world ought not to be
[2:03:45] taking us down
[2:03:47] these are the times when it's time to
[2:03:48] rise up and excel
[2:03:51] to have complete victory over the enemy
[2:03:53] that this
[2:03:54] demon of covet i'm gonna tell you
[2:03:56] something friends if you think about
[2:03:57] this i was talking about wayne lawson
[2:03:58] the other day
[2:03:59] he was he was reciting this it's so
[2:04:01] inspiring
[2:04:02] that this covet brother wayne said
[2:04:04] brother jason he said i see this covet
[2:04:06] as a demon of separation
[2:04:10] isn't it funny how the devil's tried
[2:04:12] since the days of the prophet even
[2:04:13] brother branham warning the church
[2:04:15] he said now you're one great big happy
[2:04:17] sweet group now but remember my warning
[2:04:19] say well let it stay that way
[2:04:20] even if he has to bring somebody in uh
[2:04:22] an imposter and inject them with a
[2:04:23] poison they'll start running through the
[2:04:24] church
[2:04:25] and and don't you side with it remember
[2:04:27] that love that brother pray for him
[2:04:29] he'll either come in or go out become
[2:04:30] one of you
[2:04:31] or leave and and satan has always been
[2:04:34] trying and he's been very successful
[2:04:35] splitting churches splitting families
[2:04:38] splitting marriages
[2:04:39] are all in the name of the message of
[2:04:41] the hour
[2:04:44] under the authority of the king's word
[2:04:46] taking the misinterpreting the
[2:04:47] scriptures
[2:04:48] and and and breaking away and then
[2:04:50] they're against this one and then you've
[2:04:52] got a split and then there's a division
[2:04:54] and satan but you know that the beauty
[2:04:56] of it is the true
[2:04:57] church of god that true pure bread body
[2:05:02] of christ with the holy ghost has
[2:05:05] weathered every one of those
[2:05:06] i've been raised up in this thing i've
[2:05:08] been in church splits i've seen
[2:05:10] church splits you're not going to see
[2:05:12] more and have more experience than me
[2:05:14] my parents were in the meetings i was
[2:05:15] born in it i've been raised in it i've
[2:05:18] i i've lived at numerous places i've
[2:05:20] lived in the north i've lived in the
[2:05:21] south i've lived in the deep south i've
[2:05:22] been around the world
[2:05:24] i'm here to tell you the bride of jesus
[2:05:26] christ just just surmounts every time
[2:05:28] that happens
[2:05:28] she just steps over it and keeps on
[2:05:30] walking
[2:05:32] every time somebody rises up with the
[2:05:34] camp and people get pulled aside
[2:05:36] the bride of christ stays right on the
[2:05:37] word and even sometimes some of them
[2:05:39] come out of that and go
[2:05:40] what was i thinking yeah what were you
[2:05:42] thinking come on back let me let me
[2:05:44] let me wash you up real quick okay now
[2:05:46] you're just fine hallelujah friends
[2:05:48] that's the power of the word of god
[2:05:52] now here we are we've got a we've got an
[2:05:56] affliction that's going around the world
[2:05:59] and satan has been able to divide us
[2:06:03] literally only half this congregation
[2:06:07] can even be here at any given service
[2:06:11] not saying we're not well i'm not saying
[2:06:12] we're going to stop doing that i'm just
[2:06:13] saying
[2:06:14] you know we we've got our thinking on
[2:06:16] that i've covered it thoroughly we want
[2:06:17] to see it end
[2:06:19] but we're trying to provide the right
[2:06:20] kind of testimony we found a way to work
[2:06:22] around it so we're working around it
[2:06:23] but you know if you just think about it
[2:06:24] for a second what is one of the best
[2:06:27] ways sometimes
[2:06:28] as a preacher brother wayne and i were
[2:06:30] talking about this and relating
[2:06:31] man that is so true i've had that happen
[2:06:33] he said yeah me too
[2:06:34] yeah so many times in a church you start
[2:06:36] preaching
[2:06:37] and and yeah you ever wonder why brother
[2:06:40] jason
[2:06:41] is like kooky on making you turn on
[2:06:43] shake hands
[2:06:45] you think that's just my ocd
[2:06:49] do you know i do that around the world
[2:06:51] you know why i do it
[2:06:52] because it breaks the breaks the power
[2:06:54] of devils
[2:06:56] because you reach out and you take
[2:06:57] another believer by the hand
[2:07:00] we we got to bind our faith what do we
[2:07:01] do we say lay your hands on one another
[2:07:05] we we we gather up here around the the
[2:07:07] pulpit how many times for years i say no
[2:07:09] don't stand in the aisles get up in here
[2:07:11] tight do we need this
[2:07:12] we need this bonfire to be big
[2:07:15] we can't even do any of that now
[2:07:19] i can't even turn around i can say shake
[2:07:21] hands within your family and just give a
[2:07:22] virtual shake to everybody else and wave
[2:07:24] at them
[2:07:26] this covet has been a literal separate
[2:07:28] it's been the most successful way that
[2:07:30] satan's been able to literally separate
[2:07:31] us
[2:07:31] and i'll tell you something friends he's
[2:07:33] separated a lot of people from coming to
[2:07:34] the house of god
[2:07:35] and it's affecting lives
[2:07:38] it's affecting lives it's i'm going to
[2:07:40] tell you something friends
[2:07:41] if you are at home and afraid of covid
[2:07:44] shame on you cast that thing down
[2:07:47] believe in the power of god
[2:07:49] we've got we've got distancing here we
[2:07:51] wear mask here we got
[2:07:52] hand sanitizers here i'm here to tell
[2:07:54] you satan has pulled one
[2:07:57] and i'm here to say we're not we're not
[2:07:58] going to violate the the ordinance but
[2:08:00] i i just believe that that we got to
[2:08:02] come to grips and say
[2:08:03] i need more of god i need more of the
[2:08:05] holy ghost i need a fresh fire
[2:08:08] that's what bethel tabernacle needs
[2:08:09] that's what i'm preaching about
[2:08:11] i want us to be the anointed kingdom
[2:08:15] the anointed kingdom where the devil has
[2:08:19] no way
[2:08:21] to get a foothold we need a revival
[2:08:24] meeting i've been trying to brainstorm
[2:08:26] how can i have a revival meeting
[2:08:28] i don't know man i've thought about
[2:08:29] putting a big old ginormous tent out
[2:08:30] here they say
[2:08:32] you know if you're outdoors that's why
[2:08:33] they say
[2:08:35] you know protesters they can get out
[2:08:37] there because they're outdoors okay
[2:08:38] fine we'll put a big old tent so we'll
[2:08:40] all be outdoors
[2:08:42] and if they let them do it outdoors they
[2:08:44] got to let us do it outdoors amen
[2:08:47] i'd like to run about 10 nights in a big
[2:08:49] tent revival out here
[2:08:50] i'd show them what to what the what the
[2:08:52] world needs
[2:08:54] we'd bring in some gospel revival
[2:08:56] preachers in here and we'd blow this
[2:08:57] place up
[2:08:58] hallelujah friends that's what i want i
[2:09:00] want to see the power of god moving
[2:09:02] we're almost home
[2:09:04] the devil's raging i want to see the
[2:09:06] power of the living god moving among us
[2:09:09] it's promised to us it's promised to us
[2:09:13] let me finish up here i think i got
[2:09:15] three more slides yeah three more
[2:09:16] exactly
[2:09:18] watch let's stop with these
[2:09:21] still gotcha
[2:09:25] i need not that one
[2:09:28] i need that one the future home
[2:09:32] of the heavenly bridegroom and the
[2:09:33] earthly bride just like
[2:09:35] all the curse of sin
[2:09:39] is gone when the holy ghost accepts you
[2:09:42] you don't accept it it accepts you see
[2:09:45] because it's god's attribute see if it's
[2:09:48] the holy ghost means god's spirit and
[2:09:50] it's the attribute the thought of god
[2:09:52] has accepted you because you were
[2:09:55] ordained
[2:09:56] for that purpose so you've got a gene of
[2:09:59] god
[2:10:00] you are one in 40 million to 1.2 billion
[2:10:04] but you still got to have the spark
[2:10:08] you got the ma you got the gasoline you
[2:10:10] got the gene of god but you still got to
[2:10:13] be born
[2:10:14] again see to release the power in the
[2:10:17] word
[2:10:20] he goes on next slide he says
[2:10:23] yet you was born in sin so you ordained
[2:10:26] for that purpose
[2:10:27] yet you were born in sin but god had
[2:10:30] that attribute and here you
[2:10:31] expressed yourself here on earth and he
[2:10:34] comes down and gets you see
[2:10:35] you're back here and here is where you
[2:10:38] belong
[2:10:38] sin has lost its power could i say to
[2:10:41] you today
[2:10:42] that's where you belong where brother
[2:10:44] jason do i belong
[2:10:46] in here do i belong in beaufort do i
[2:10:48] belong in another state
[2:10:49] you but you you belong where sin has
[2:10:51] lost its power
[2:10:53] and wherever you're ever your g your
[2:10:55] geographical location is
[2:10:56] matters not that matters way less than
[2:10:59] that you dwell where
[2:11:00] sin is not see
[2:11:04] and so so he says you're in where you
[2:11:07] belong
[2:11:08] see sin has lost its power
[2:11:11] that's right the desire of sin has done
[2:11:13] gone from your heart
[2:11:15] when the holy spirit comes in you are a
[2:11:18] restored person
[2:11:20] and then when the earth is restored
[2:11:23] by the same thing there can be no more
[2:11:26] cursing no more storms no more winds no
[2:11:28] more typhoons
[2:11:30] you are reconciled man and god has met
[2:11:32] the new earth
[2:11:33] will be put on its eden beauty again the
[2:11:36] new earth will spread forth
[2:11:38] her uh after her baptism of fire
[2:11:45] listen friends let me give you a a a
[2:11:48] word of encouragement let me leave you
[2:11:49] on an encouraging note
[2:11:52] sin will not stop the earth from
[2:11:54] changing back to its original condition
[2:11:58] thank god i
[2:12:01] i i look in the news headlines and i
[2:12:04] just have to look away
[2:12:06] i try to read oh i'm so sick of it
[2:12:09] i'm so sick of it it's so twisted it's
[2:12:13] so perverted
[2:12:14] everybody hates everybody everybody's
[2:12:16] lying
[2:12:18] good causes have been hijacked by bad
[2:12:20] causes and and
[2:12:21] and things and and insanity and chaos in
[2:12:25] the streets
[2:12:26] i'm i'm done with it and i want to i
[2:12:29] want to live on another planet
[2:12:32] you know the planet i want to live on i
[2:12:33] want to go live on planet jesus
[2:12:36] and the prophet said you've got enough
[2:12:38] power in you to speak a world into
[2:12:40] existence
[2:12:40] and go live there i intend to speak
[2:12:43] planet jesus into existence
[2:12:44] and i intend to live there i'm tired of
[2:12:47] this world
[2:12:48] i want his world i want his life and i
[2:12:50] don't care all the chaos all the lies
[2:12:52] all the nonsense i don't care who wins
[2:12:54] the president i don't care who does what
[2:12:56] when where or how
[2:12:57] it's not going to stop what john saw
[2:13:00] john saw it he said it's real i saw it
[2:13:05] hallelujah why brother jason
[2:13:08] why did why can it not be stopped
[2:13:12] for the same reason you can't be stopped
[2:13:14] because it's god's attribute
[2:13:16] the new world is part of his attribute
[2:13:19] you're part of his attribute this earth
[2:13:21] is part of his attribute
[2:13:23] do you do you think friends for a moment
[2:13:26] when god had the earth standing and and
[2:13:29] it was darkness covered the face of the
[2:13:31] deep
[2:13:32] there was no garden of eden there was no
[2:13:34] trees nothing darkness covered the face
[2:13:36] of the deep
[2:13:37] and the sun was already there and the
[2:13:40] seed was already in the earth
[2:13:42] but in between was this thick dark
[2:13:44] blackness
[2:13:46] and it was cutting off the rays of light
[2:13:48] all it needed
[2:13:49] was to strike the earth clear back the
[2:13:51] water and strike the seed and life would
[2:13:52] come forth
[2:13:53] because life was in the seed and
[2:13:56] you know i think in all of that chaos we
[2:13:58] look today and say man it's chaos it's
[2:14:00] darkness it's terrible how's the
[2:14:01] how's the light of god's sunlight how is
[2:14:04] the is the rising of the sun and we
[2:14:06] we say that until it becomes almost a
[2:14:08] cliche what does it really mean
[2:14:10] brother jason i'm here to tell you
[2:14:11] something friends no more than the chaos
[2:14:14] of that earth when god said
[2:14:15] let there be light he wasn't creating a
[2:14:18] sun and he wasn't creating
[2:14:19] seed he was speaking to that darkness
[2:14:23] and i when i think about that i wrote my
[2:14:24] own self this question do you really
[2:14:26] think
[2:14:27] that god looked at that darkness
[2:14:29] standing between the sun and the seed
[2:14:30] and said
[2:14:31] who how will i get this seed to match my
[2:14:35] vision
[2:14:35] of it as a flourishing plant i see it as
[2:14:38] a flourishing plant how am i ever going
[2:14:40] to get there
[2:14:41] i'm here to tell you something friends
[2:14:43] that darkness couldn't stop it
[2:14:46] you know why light as brother graham
[2:14:48] said light is 10
[2:14:49] million times more powerful than
[2:14:51] darkness
[2:14:53] all you need all you need today
[2:14:57] say brother jason sum it up give me my
[2:14:59] one piece of advice before you send me
[2:15:01] home
[2:15:02] my one piece of advice brother anthony
[2:15:04] bring your team and come on back

[2:15:13] light
[2:15:15] stand
[2:15:19] think about your life friends think
[2:15:21] about where your life is
[2:15:24] do you stand in the darkness as a seed
[2:15:27] gene of god
[2:15:28] you're a christian where are you
[2:15:29] standing
[2:15:31] think about that seriously now for a
[2:15:33] moment i want you to think real
[2:15:36] seriously because you know there i i
[2:15:38] have because there's been a spark i have
[2:15:41] the ability to stand in the light say
[2:15:42] brother jason i've had that same spark
[2:15:44] too well

[2:16:08] life and maybe you've did all kinds of
[2:16:11] things and covered it and hybrid it and
[2:16:13] everything
[2:16:13] but if you just leave it alone and let
[2:16:15] it come back to nature
