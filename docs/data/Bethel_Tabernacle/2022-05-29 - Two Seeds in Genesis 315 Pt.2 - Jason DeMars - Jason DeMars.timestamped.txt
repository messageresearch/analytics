[1:44] so
[1:49] [Music]
[2:18] everyone god bless you
[2:20] let's stand and pray
[2:24] heavenly father we just come before you
[2:26] lord and we want to
[2:28] lay our hearts before you
[2:30] lord and ask that your your holy spirit
[2:33] would come and
[2:34] take your word and break it open to our
[2:36] hearts lord only you can do that
[2:39] pray that you'd reveal yourself to us
[2:40] more and more lord
[2:42] keep your hand upon each one of us we
[2:44] ask in jesus name amen
[2:47] all right we're going to continue on
[2:48] part two of serpent seed
[2:51] i'm gonna
[2:52] read the opening scriptures genesis 3 14
[2:55] and 15
[2:58] and the lord god said unto the serpent
[3:00] because thou hast done this thou are
[3:01] cursed above all cattle and above every
[3:04] beast of the field upon thy belly shalt
[3:06] thou go
[3:08] and dust shalt thou eat all the days of
[3:10] thy life and i will put enmity between
[3:12] thee and the woman
[3:14] and between thy seed
[3:16] and her seed thy offspring and her
[3:19] offspring
[3:20] it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[3:23] bruise his heel may the lord add the
[3:25] blessing to the reading of his word you
[3:26] can be seated
[3:32] so we see there there was there the the
[3:35] serpent was changed
[3:37] from being upright
[3:38] two feet could
[3:40] speak could reason
[3:42] to being
[3:43] what we now
[3:44] see as a snake on his belly
[3:47] and
[3:49] secondly we see in that that god put in
[3:52] enmity between the serpent and the woman
[3:55] okay we get that but then he says
[3:58] between
[3:59] the offspring of the serpent and the
[4:01] offspring
[4:03] of the woman
[4:04] all right so is that why we're so afraid
[4:07] of snakes i guess
[4:10] does god does god look at this and say
[4:14] is the story of the bible two different
[4:17] lines one of
[4:19] snakes
[4:20] and one of god's people
[4:24] well no it's not it's not about animals
[4:27] having trouble with humans there is
[4:30] later on
[4:32] it speaks of that
[4:33] with adam and and so forth but
[4:36] uh and and noah
[4:38] but here we're looking at
[4:41] two seed lines
[4:43] and that's what scripture bears record
[4:44] of
[4:46] before we go forward the next screen
[4:47] just to
[4:49] kind of summarize what we talked about
[4:50] last time
[4:52] caleb next screen
[4:54] god's command
[4:55] is to multiply and replenish the earth
[4:58] so that's what he commands them in the
[5:00] beginning
[5:02] then the next thing he says do not eat
[5:05] from the tree of knowledge
[5:08] next you see god putting enmity between
[5:11] two genetic lines the offspring of the
[5:14] woman and the offspring of the serpent
[5:17] then the next thing you see is god
[5:20] cursing the birth process
[5:23] and putting eve's desire
[5:25] towards her husband
[5:28] look at those four things
[5:31] you could see
[5:32] three of them all
[5:34] pertain to each other they all line up
[5:37] they're all the same
[5:39] thought
[5:40] but number two
[5:43] not to eat from the tree of knowledge
[5:45] doesn't fit does it
[5:49] it's not
[5:50] if we're going to take that literally it
[5:52] doesn't fit
[5:53] it doesn't make sense so
[5:56] as we saw before we take it
[5:57] allegorically because scripture itself
[6:01] speaks of the other tree as allegorical
[6:04] what how do we find that that's in in
[6:07] revelation chapter three
[6:09] he says i will give you or chapter two
[6:11] actually
[6:12] i will give to the overcomer to eat of
[6:15] the tree of life which is in the midst
[6:18] of the paradise of god it's
[6:21] it's still there in the midst of the
[6:23] paradise of god it hasn't left
[6:25] and we since we can't literally find a
[6:28] geographical location on planet earth
[6:30] where we can
[6:31] we are cut off from we can't get to it
[6:33] and there's a tree there that if we ate
[6:35] it we would get eternal life it sounds
[6:37] like a mythology
[6:39] we understand it isn't a mythology it's
[6:41] an allegory
[6:42] and it's speaking in uh
[6:46] allegorical terms to eat
[6:49] is the action the tree of knowledge is
[6:51] the life that's behind that action
[6:53] really if you come down to it it's
[6:56] it's headed up in one the tree of life
[6:58] the lord jesus christ i will give you to
[7:01] eat of the tree of life you're going to
[7:04] partake of jesus christ
[7:06] then the tree of the knowledge of good
[7:08] and evil there's some good there's some
[7:10] evil who does that that's the devil
[7:13] summed up in the devil but really what
[7:15] it is is is going backwards looking at
[7:18] that you see that this is god saying
[7:22] don't
[7:23] do it the way i've said to do it
[7:25] reproduce yourself the way i've said to
[7:28] do it don't reproduce
[7:30] another way
[7:31] do it the way god intends and you'll
[7:34] bring forth life
[7:37] we'll look at that more later
[7:40] now let's go into the context of the
[7:42] rest of scripture second corinthians 11
[7:45] 2 and 3 for i am jealous over you
[7:47] with godly jealousy for i have espoused
[7:49] you to one husband
[7:51] that i may present you as a chaste
[7:53] virgin to christ but i fear
[7:55] lest by any means as the serpent
[7:57] beguiled eve through his subtility
[8:00] so your mind should be corrupted from
[8:02] the simplicity that is in christ
[8:04] for if he that cometh preacheth another
[8:06] jesus whom we have not preached or if
[8:08] you receive another spirit which you
[8:10] have not received or another gospel
[8:12] which you have not accepted you might
[8:14] well
[8:15] bear with him
[8:17] look screen
[8:18] so
[8:20] number one the church is engaged
[8:23] as a virgin to christ
[8:26] and this is in type
[8:28] of eve being engaged as a virgin
[8:32] to adam
[8:33] paul fears the church's church's
[8:36] adultery
[8:37] by accepting a false word
[8:41] he then compares that
[8:43] to the original sin
[8:45] if paul fears the church committing
[8:47] adultery and compares it to eve sin
[8:50] then we can conclude by the scripture
[8:52] that eve committed adultery with the
[8:56] serpent
[8:58] it's a it's a
[8:59] that was a perfect perfect logical
[9:02] progression right there that's totally
[9:04] scriptural just to say that
[9:07] adultery you know you read the different
[9:08] things that people speak about
[9:10] brother branham or write about brother
[9:12] branham and how it's just crazy
[9:14] that they believe that the original sin
[9:17] was an adultery my goodness the context
[9:19] of scripture is so clear it's crazy not
[9:22] to see that
[9:24] all right let's go forward
[9:26] proverbs 30 verse 20
[9:29] such is the way of an adulterous woman
[9:32] she eateth
[9:33] oh
[9:34] she eats
[9:37] eat of the tree of the knowledge of good
[9:39] and evil which is in the midst of the
[9:40] garden so such is the way of an
[9:42] adulterous woman she eats and wipes her
[9:44] mouth and saith i have done no
[9:47] wickedness
[9:49] so here the act
[9:51] of adultery is spoken of as eating
[9:55] all right
[9:56] song of solomon 4 12 a garden
[9:59] enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring
[10:01] shut up a fountain sealed
[10:05] song of solomon 4 16 a waco north wind
[10:08] and come thou south blow upon my garden
[10:10] that the spices thereof
[10:12] may flow out let my beloved come into
[10:14] his garden and eat his pleasant fruits
[10:17] song of solomon 5 1.
[10:19] i am coming to my garden my sister my
[10:21] spouse i have gathered my myrrh with my
[10:23] spice i've eaten my honeycomb with my
[10:25] honey i've drunk my mind with my milk
[10:27] eat oh friends drink yay drink
[10:29] abundantly
[10:30] oh beloved
[10:32] song of solomon 6 2
[10:34] my beloved has gone down into his garden
[10:36] to the beds of spices to feed in the
[10:38] gardens and to gather lilies
[10:41] so
[10:43] again allegorical language it's clear
[10:46] we're
[10:47] we're letting scripture
[10:50] interpret scripture
[10:52] script the context of scripture uses the
[10:55] terms eating garden etc
[10:58] attached with this very thing even
[11:01] fruits
[11:02] so it's it's clear from the context of
[11:05] scripture that it's not a far-fetched
[11:08] big nonsense garbage
[11:10] about serpent seed it's so and it's not
[11:13] just brother branham telling us
[11:15] it's from genesis to revelation
[11:18] we wouldn't know i wouldn't know if
[11:19] brother branham didn't tell me
[11:21] i'm not saying that but as you study and
[11:24] read through the scripture
[11:26] it unfolds itself it continually unfolds
[11:28] itself
[11:31] so again
[11:33] he puts enmity between thy
[11:35] seed
[11:37] whose seed
[11:38] the serpent's seed
[11:40] that even the terminology it's not made
[11:42] up terminology who's god speaking to the
[11:45] serpent
[11:46] he has a seed who is it
[11:48] answer the question
[11:52] who is the serpent
[11:54] seed who who
[11:58] is it snakes
[12:00] is it brother mark is it boa
[12:02] constrictors
[12:05] what is he talking about well the
[12:07] context of scripture
[12:09] will teach us that there's
[12:11] two seed lines one is the seed of the
[12:13] serpent one is the seed of the woman
[12:15] we we know ultimately this is a prophecy
[12:18] of jesus christ this is the first
[12:21] declaration of the gospel
[12:24] but you can't take just that and miss
[12:26] the rest
[12:28] because it even jesus points out the two
[12:31] different seed lines
[12:33] genesis let's start right away
[12:36] there's going to be enmity okay where's
[12:39] the enmity
[12:40] let me find let me find out what's where
[12:43] is that going to be genesis 4 8
[12:46] and cain talked with abel his brother
[12:47] and it came to pass when they were in
[12:49] the field that cain rose up against abel
[12:51] his brother and slew him
[12:53] and then 17 through 19 and cain's knew
[12:55] his wife
[12:56] and she conceived and bear enoch and he
[12:58] builded a city and called the name of
[13:00] the city after the name of his son enoch
[13:02] and unto enoch was born irad and iran
[13:04] beget
[13:09] and lamech took unto him two wives the
[13:11] name of the one was ada and the name of
[13:14] the other zilla so
[13:16] who is the originator of polygamy
[13:21] serpent seed
[13:25] i'll just leave that there
[13:28] genesis 4 20 through 24.
[13:32] and ada bear jabil he was the father of
[13:34] such as dwell in tents and of such as
[13:36] have cattle and his brother's name was
[13:38] jubal he was the father of all such as
[13:40] handle the harp and organ
[13:42] and zilla
[13:44] she also bear tubal kane an instructor
[13:46] of every artificer of in brass and iron
[13:48] and the sister of tubal kane was nema
[13:51] and lamack said unto his wives ada and
[13:53] zilla hear my voice e wives of lamech
[13:56] hearken unto my speech for i have slain
[13:58] a man to my wounding and a young man to
[14:00] my hurt if cain shall be avenged seven
[14:02] wholefold truly lamech 70 and
[14:06] sevenfold we see our first tyrant
[14:09] so who invented tyranny
[14:12] serpentseed
[14:16] all right we continue on go to the new
[14:18] testament
[14:20] jesus speaking to the pharisees but now
[14:22] you seek to kill me
[14:24] a man that's told you the truth which i
[14:25] have heard of god
[14:27] this did not abraham you do the deeds of
[14:31] your father then said they to him
[14:34] we be not born of fornication
[14:37] we have one father even god
[14:40] all right
[14:41] why in the world do they say we be not
[14:43] born of fornication well
[14:46] later christian interpreters say well
[14:48] this this means that they think jesus
[14:50] was born
[14:52] of fornication but that's not the
[14:54] context at all
[14:56] the contact is says you're not doing
[14:59] you're doing the deeds of your father
[15:02] you're not doing what abraham did and
[15:03] the jews instantaneously know what he's
[15:06] talking about
[15:07] they know the entire context it's not
[15:09] confusing to them what jesus is saying
[15:12] it's not even a parable he's exactly
[15:14] straight and direct with them and he
[15:17] says we're not born of fornication
[15:20] we have one father even god who's the
[15:22] other father that then jesus was talking
[15:24] about you are of your father the devil
[15:28] next verse
[15:29] and the lust of your father will he will
[15:31] do
[15:32] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[15:34] abode not in the truth because there is
[15:36] no truth in him
[15:37] when he speaks a lie he speaks of his
[15:39] own for he is a liar and the father of
[15:42] it he's the father of murderers and the
[15:45] father
[15:46] of liars
[15:51] who's the first murderer
[15:54] cain
[15:56] so what is jesus saying
[15:58] satan is the father of cain and you
[16:02] pharisees
[16:04] and cain was a liar
[16:06] you're a liar just like him he's con
[16:09] it's so obvious to the jews
[16:11] the the pharisees he's saying you're a
[16:14] bunch of serpent seed
[16:16] you want to kill me because you're doing
[16:18] the works of your daddy and they knew
[16:20] right away oh it's talking about the
[16:22] devil
[16:26] first john 3 12 not as cain
[16:29] who was of that wicked one and slew his
[16:32] brother and wherefore slew he him
[16:34] because his own works were evil and his
[16:36] brother is righteous
[16:38] people will take this and say well it
[16:39] doesn't really say exactly that the
[16:42] devil was cain's father
[16:47] just as he was of that in other words
[16:48] this nature was like the devil well
[16:50] where did he get his nature from
[16:53] if his parents
[16:54] were
[16:55] genetically godly
[16:58] one of them could not be deceived one of
[17:00] them could be deceived
[17:01] and that was the result was cain how was
[17:03] he of that wicked one adam wasn't the
[17:06] wicked one
[17:07] that would mean god was the wicked one
[17:10] it's not going to work
[17:12] if you look at
[17:14] i believe it's the book of luke
[17:16] and in the genealogy
[17:19] notice i don't know if all king james
[17:22] bibles do that but
[17:23] most of them i think do in luke
[17:26] where it goes through the genealogy and
[17:28] it says the son of the son of the son of
[17:31] the son is in italics
[17:34] that means it's not in the original
[17:36] greek
[17:37] it is added for understanding so really
[17:40] what it's doing is of mathat of hell of
[17:44] of of of
[17:45] this is the common way of stating a
[17:48] genealogy
[17:49] so this
[17:51] john saying of the wicked one is simply
[17:55] genealogy we could we could add for
[17:57] increased understandings who was of who
[18:00] is the son of that wicked one
[18:04] that gives a full understanding of what
[18:06] john is writing
[18:09] matthew 13 37 through 39 he has answered
[18:14] and said unto them he that soweth the
[18:15] good seed is the son of man the field is
[18:17] the world the good seed are the children
[18:19] of the kingdom but the tares are the
[18:21] children of the wicked one the enemy
[18:23] that sowed them as the devil the harvest
[18:25] is the end of the world
[18:27] and the reapers are the angels
[18:29] now i know people can people going back
[18:31] in my mind i'm thinking just what's
[18:33] striking me is
[18:34] back in john
[18:36] 8 44 you could say well we're all from
[18:39] noah
[18:40] so this is only spiritual
[18:43] there's no such thing
[18:44] as a pure
[18:46] serpent seed on the earth right now and
[18:49] that would be an accurate statement
[18:51] there is no such thing the serpent seed
[18:54] race
[18:55] the serpent seed genetics is in all of
[18:58] us
[18:59] that's why we're born with a fallen
[19:00] nature because that genetic line got in
[19:03] us that's why we have that's why that we
[19:05] needed the perfect blood of jesus christ
[19:07] that's why we need to be born again our
[19:09] first birth is wrong
[19:11] and so okay yeah
[19:13] that is spiritual now by
[19:15] by election it's not just by genetics
[19:17] and every child born from this family is
[19:20] going to be this and
[19:21] some of the many false doctrines
[19:23] surrounding serpent seed that
[19:25] you know
[19:26] black people say white people are
[19:28] serpent seed and white people say black
[19:30] people are serpent seed come on man
[19:32] we're not stupid
[19:37] it all goes back to noah we're all from
[19:39] one blood
[19:40] we're all the same color
[19:43] just varying degrees of melanin
[19:46] that's not what that's about
[19:48] what this is what this is
[19:50] really about is going looking backwards
[19:53] we understand
[19:55] how this fallen nature got into the
[19:57] human race
[20:00] and
[20:01] looking at that why
[20:03] if it's just spiritual why is it why is
[20:06] the word
[20:07] born of fornication in there
[20:09] why is it speaking of the son of
[20:13] right
[20:14] why would these pictures continually
[20:16] come in why would every context we look
[20:18] at eating of the i want to emphasize
[20:21] this again
[20:22] i think it's important when we look at
[20:24] eating
[20:25] of one of those trees
[20:27] eating of one of those trees produces
[20:29] eternal life
[20:31] okay produces eternal life but i asked
[20:33] the question didn't adam and eve already
[20:35] have
[20:37] eternal life
[20:38] they didn't need to eat anything
[20:41] to get eternal life
[20:42] they had it
[20:44] so what was the issue the issue is what
[20:46] is it going to produce
[20:48] you're going to produce something you're
[20:50] going to produce a fruit of the tree of
[20:52] the knowledge of good and evil cane
[20:54] we're going to produce a fruit of the
[20:56] tree of life jesus christ
[20:59] right so
[21:01] it's by it's about the life source
[21:04] and that life source continues on
[21:07] and that yes it was genetic at one point
[21:09] in time but then the sons of god
[21:12] uh abel's line and the daughters are not
[21:15] able's line cestline
[21:17] and the daughters of men
[21:18] keynes line got together and this became
[21:21] a hybridization
[21:23] now it becomes not it doesn't become
[21:26] physical genetic lines but it comes by
[21:29] election
[21:30] predestinated now it becomes a spiritual
[21:32] line but those
[21:34] just as important is the spiritual line
[21:37] the life
[21:39] what's behind it right
[21:41] that's that's what this is looking at
[21:43] it's the life behind a person and the
[21:46] life that's in you is all
[21:49] is always going to be declare itself
[21:52] if you're predestinated seed
[21:54] you're going to hear the word
[21:56] and that's going to produce the life
[21:59] of your father
[22:01] if you're
[22:02] if if you're
[22:04] spiritually serpentied
[22:06] when you hear the word you're going to
[22:08] hate it you're going to fight against it
[22:10] now we all have a nature in ourselves
[22:12] that will do that until the spirit of
[22:14] god comes and changes us
[22:18] but the import the the main thing
[22:20] looking at all of this to understand is
[22:22] that this
[22:23] seed line continues on
[22:26] otherwise jesus wouldn't talk about it
[22:27] in the new testament it would just be
[22:29] just be an old testament doctrine back
[22:31] there before noah it's a cool thing to
[22:33] understand but it has no application or
[22:36] impact now no
[22:38] it continues forward there's two seeds
[22:41] and brother banham over and over again
[22:44] they're both religious
[22:46] they're both crying out for something
[22:47] for for for something outside of
[22:50] themselves
[22:51] to meet their need
[22:53] but one can recognize can hear
[22:56] and receive and submit to the word
[22:59] one of them hears the word and man they
[23:01] are so angry
[23:05] when you pre just preach
[23:08] just preach the real
[23:10] living manifested word in this hour
[23:13] just watch people declare themselves
[23:17] you see on the missions field it's so
[23:19] happened so many times oh we they we
[23:22] have a wonderful church we have lots of
[23:24] people here and you come and you preach
[23:26] straight the message and you see oh
[23:30] 50 50
[23:33] 30 70.
[23:36] we came and preached the message
[23:38] real real
[23:40] gentlemanly carefully wisely
[23:43] and 70 percent of the church leaves all
[23:46] right
[23:46] well praise the lord every seed declares
[23:49] itself
[23:51] quickly get to that place where you
[23:53] preach the word
[23:57] otherwise you waste a lot of time
[23:59] every seed will declare itself but it's
[24:01] it's
[24:02] make it a confrontation over the word
[24:04] not a confrontation over the authority
[24:06] of the pastor not a confrontation over
[24:08] the
[24:08] we got a nice church nice this a nice
[24:11] that
[24:11] it's about the word
[24:13] amen
[24:14] and that's going to make that's going to
[24:16] make people grow
[24:17] and that's going to make people go
[24:21] we don't want anybody to go we want them
[24:23] all to grow that's our hearts desire so
[24:26] i'm going to just kind of at a
[24:28] breaking point but i'm going to press
[24:30] forward for a few more minutes
[24:33] so screen i think
[24:35] 33 looking at some of the history on
[24:39] this topic
[24:42] in jewish tradition
[24:44] these different rabbis from history you
[24:47] may or may not probably are not familiar
[24:49] with them
[24:50] and also the writing
[24:51] um
[24:52] targum pseudo-jonathan
[24:54] asserted that adam was not the father of
[24:57] cain rather
[24:58] eve was subject to adultery having been
[25:01] seduced either by by either samael the
[25:04] serpent
[25:05] in the garden of eden or the devil
[25:07] himself
[25:09] uh christian exegesis of the evil one
[25:14] in first john
[25:15] 3 10 through 12 have also led some
[25:17] commentators like tertullian to agree
[25:19] that cain was the son of the devil
[25:23] so
[25:24] breaking it breaking that down
[25:26] if you look at jewish writings from
[25:28] history
[25:30] it's very clear that they believed in
[25:32] serpent seed it's not something new it's
[25:34] not something new it's not something
[25:36] invented it's not a 20 20th century
[25:38] doctrine it goes back
[25:41] to the time of jesus
[25:46] and earlier
[25:47] this is a quote from tertullian
[25:51] having been made pregnant by the devil
[25:53] she brought forth a son
[25:58] oh man i've got to quit right here this
[26:00] takes too long to explain
[26:04] we'll we'll quit here let's stand and
[26:06] pray
[26:10] amen heavenly father we're so thankful
[26:12] for your goodness and your mercy lord we
[26:14] pray your blessing on the service today
[26:16] we pray
[26:17] that our hearts would be
[26:19] clear and clean lord

[26:29] we desperately need you
[26:32] move in lives lord
[26:33] convict our hearts cleanse us from sin
[26:36] encourage our hearts father we ask in
