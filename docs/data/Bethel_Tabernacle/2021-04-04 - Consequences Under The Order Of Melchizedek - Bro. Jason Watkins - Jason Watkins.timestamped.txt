[20:25] [Music]
[20:32] amen
[20:48] [Music]
[21:14] so
[21:16] [Music]
[21:26] all the windows fastened down i spent
[21:30] the night
[21:31] in sleeplessness and rose at every sound
[21:37] half in helpless sorrow and half
[21:41] in fear the day would find the soldiers
[21:46] breaking through to drag us all away
[21:57] well just before the sunrise
[22:00] i heard something at the wall
[22:05] the gate began to rattle
[22:08] and the voice began to calm
[22:12] i hurried to the window
[22:15] and looked down into the street
[22:19] expecting swords and torches and the
[22:23] sound
[22:24] of soldiers feet
[22:32] there was no one there but mary
[22:35] so i went down to let her in
[22:40] john stood there beside me
[22:43] she told us who were cheap and
[22:47] she said they've moved him in the night
[22:50] and none of us knows where
[22:54] the stone's been rolled away and now his
[22:58] body
[22:59] isn't there
[23:03] we both ran toward the garden
[23:07] john ran on ahead
[23:10] we found the stone and the empty tomb
[23:13] just the way that mary said
[23:17] but the winding sheets they'd wrapped
[23:20] him in
[23:21] was just an empty shell
[23:24] how and where they'd taken him
[23:28] was more than i could tell
[23:37] well something strange had happened
[23:40] there
[23:40] just what i did not know
[23:43] [Applause]
[23:44] john believed a miracle
[23:48] but i just turned to go
[23:51] circumstance and speculation
[23:55] couldn't lift me very high
[23:58] cause i'd seen them crucify him
[24:03] and then i saw him die
[24:05] [Music]
[24:11] well sudden back inside the house again
[24:15] the guilt and anguish came
[24:19] everything i promised him just
[24:22] added to my shame when at last
[24:26] it came to choices i denied i
[24:30] knew his name and even if
[24:34] he was alive it wouldn't be
[24:38] the same suddenly
[24:47] the air was filled with a strange and
[24:50] sweet perfume a light that's shown
[24:54] from everywhere drove shadows
[24:57] from the room jesus stood before me
[25:03] with his arms held open wide
[25:07] and i fell down on my knees
[25:10] and just clung to him and cried
[25:17] [Music]
[25:20] he raised me to my feet
[25:23] as i looked into his eyes
[25:27] love was shining out from him
[25:30] like sunlight from the skies
[25:34] guilt and my confusion
[25:37] disappeared in sweet release
[25:41] and every fear i'd ever had
[25:45] just melted into peace
[25:58] [Music]
[26:00] he is alive
[26:03] he is alive
[26:07] he is alive and i'm forgiven
[26:10] heaven's gates are open wide
[26:13] he's alive hallelujah he's alive
[26:20] he's alive and i'm forgiven
[26:24] heaven's gates are open wide he's alive
[26:30] he's alive
[26:34] he's alive and i'm forgiven
[26:37] heaven's gates are open wide he's alive
[26:44] he's alive
[26:47] he's alive
[26:52] [Music]

[41:41] close to him he said the pastor you know
[41:43] pulled him in and said
[41:45] son you need to you need to be in the
[41:47] army of the lord
[41:49] and uh he said i am in the army of the
[41:52] lord
[41:54] and the pastor said well why don't i
[41:56] ever see you in church
[41:58] and he pulled the pastor aside and
[41:59] whispered i'm in the secret service
[42:03] [Laughter]
[42:06] so for all of you secret service agents
[42:08] today god bless you
[42:10] [Laughter]
[42:12] we're happy to have you amen praise the
[42:15] name of the lord
[42:18] wow i i want to just turn right away
[42:21] this morning
[42:23] to romans chapter 7 and i heard the
[42:26] invitation to have some more singing and
[42:28] that's not a bad idea maybe after the
[42:30] preaching
[42:30] that's the time you're supposed to
[42:32] worship anyway really
[42:34] uh the most is after the preaching of
[42:37] the word so brother ken when you come
[42:38] back up if you want to
[42:40] have the backside with a couple of songs
[42:42] that'd be amazing
[42:46] all right now
[42:49] so i sent that to you brother bradley
[42:53] and if you will put that
[42:56] up please i'll go ahead and read from
[42:58] there
[42:59] i have you turned in your bibles to
[43:02] romans 7.
[43:03] but i want to read from a different
[43:06] translation today for good
[43:07] clarity and um
[43:11] you're welcome to read along in your
[43:12] king james version if you'd like but
[43:14] this is really a really nice translation
[43:16] i like how it's worded and it certainly
[43:19] fits the scripture perfectly and
[43:21] everything brother branham
[43:23] taught us i believe friends that that
[43:26] the bible
[43:28] is as taught to us by god's prophet
[43:32] is our absolute amen this word
[43:35] friends this is what heaven and earth
[43:37] will be judged by
[43:39] i'm glad that god sent a messenger in
[43:42] this hour
[43:43] uh who was who who lived an exemplary
[43:47] life and was able to be used of god
[43:50] to unseal and unlock the bible to us
[43:53] it's a book of redemption
[43:55] that we find that john saw
[43:59] there he saw you know a
[44:02] a seven sealed book in the hands of the
[44:05] one who sat on the throne
[44:07] and brother branham gave that seven
[44:09] sealed book a title
[44:11] he called it it's the book of redemption
[44:14] and it's the it's not just a book of
[44:16] names although it includes every name
[44:19] that came from the mind of god but it
[44:21] was the whole plan of redemption
[44:24] so in symbol form we can see that it
[44:27] looked like
[44:28] a a seven sealed book in the hand but
[44:31] remember john is seeing symbolism
[44:33] what that book is is the bible
[44:36] because it the bible is the book of
[44:38] redemption
[44:39] but it was sealed it was locked up and
[44:42] all all the ages could do was probe at
[44:44] it
[44:45] but it was promised in the last day it
[44:47] would be completely unlocked unsealed
[44:49] unveiled
[44:50] and and there's how you find your
[44:52] identification
[44:54] when those names remember it doesn't
[44:56] call names like jason watkins or don
[44:58] gurgle it doesn't call it like that
[45:00] what it sends forth is the mystery of
[45:02] the plan
[45:04] and as you identify in that plan you're
[45:06] identified in the mystery you're part of
[45:08] the word
[45:09] see and that's how you're able to
[45:12] see the word of god for this hour that's
[45:15] why
[45:15] you can't not see it
[45:20] because it's part of you it's why you
[45:22] can't
[45:23] not my favorite double negative you
[45:26] can't
[45:26] not believe it because it's part of you
[45:30] amen so uh i want to read do we have
[45:34] that
[45:34] uh screen up guys uh if you don't it's
[45:36] okay i can just read it aloud
[45:39] uh yeah yeah no worries i'll give you
[45:43] you're holding up is that one second or
[45:45] one minute okay
[45:46] okay all right well the y'all haven't
[45:49] gotten to see me standing in this
[45:50] position for a while so you can gaze at
[45:52] me just a little bit
[45:55] it's me yeah i'm not i'm not half the
[45:58] man i used to be but
[46:02] but it's still me and we're thanking the
[46:04] lord
[46:05] um for the opportunity to continue to
[46:09] serve his majesty the king
[46:11] amen praise the lord all right praise
[46:14] god so romans 7
[46:16] now i'm taking for a title for my
[46:19] sermon today as you can see here in us
[46:22] as a subtitle to our scripture
[46:24] this i'm about to read you the
[46:25] consequences of calvary okay
[46:28] but now i'm i'm preaching a sermon
[46:31] because i've you remember
[46:33] before i had to take some time off i was
[46:35] preaching on consequences
[46:37] and so i've had this sermon working on
[46:39] it and the lord has added to it daily
[46:41] such as he would
[46:43] uh and it's large i don't know that i'll
[46:45] get it all today but i'd like to
[46:47] but i want to take a furtherance of that
[46:49] consequences series and preach today
[46:51] on consequences under the order of
[46:55] melchizedek now so
[46:58] so why would i take consequences of
[47:00] calvary and then the consequences
[47:03] uh under the order of melchizedek
[47:05] because brother branham
[47:07] in referring to easter easter
[47:10] morning when jesus rose from the grave
[47:14] and he said there never was a day like
[47:16] it
[47:17] see and uh there had been many good men
[47:20] but there had never been a man like this
[47:21] man
[47:22] see and that uh it ended all of the fear
[47:26] you know that that job dealt with if a
[47:29] man dies shall he live again it finally
[47:31] proved it
[47:32] it proved that job's revelation was
[47:34] correct he said i know in the last days
[47:37] i'll see my redeemer he'll live and i'll
[47:39] see and a lot of people who had
[47:41] confidence in job wanted to believe that
[47:43] but now
[47:44] it had come to pass and now there was no
[47:47] doubt
[47:48] the only way you could doubt the
[47:50] resurrection as brother branham says
[47:52] you know just like you doubt the sun is
[47:54] shining he said you'd have to run down
[47:55] in a basement
[47:57] black out all the windows close all the
[47:58] doors cut off all the lights and stay
[48:00] down there in the darkness and just say
[48:02] there is no sun there is no sun there
[48:04] and
[48:06] what a resurrection this is amen
[48:09] sheep brother branham said she's no
[48:11] longer his mouthpiece she became her own
[48:13] mouthpiece
[48:14] and therefore now god will confound her
[48:16] through the prophet and his
[48:17] and the bride isn't that beautiful
[48:20] so what a resurrection this is
[48:24] that we've been made alive out of cold
[48:25] traditions you could still be there
[48:27] friends if it wasn't for the mercy
[48:29] and the grace of god
[48:33] but let's look and see the consequences
[48:36] of calvary and how that it
[48:38] it set us free all right
[48:41] um i'll let you advance it brother brad
[48:45] so let's go to the first slide and i'll
[48:47] just read here along with you brother
[48:48] brad you can just advance as
[48:50] you'll hear me keep reading paul in
[48:53] romans 7 speaking to hebrews are
[48:56] speaking to
[48:57] jews he said you you must surely be
[48:59] aware brethren
[49:01] for i am so he says
[49:04] all right verse 14 again for we know
[49:06] that the law
[49:07] is a spiritual thing that proceeded from
[49:10] god
[49:11] but i am a carnal fallen man sold into
[49:14] slavery with sin as my master
[49:16] i don't understand myself at all for i
[49:19] continually
[49:20] fail to accomplish what i truly of our
[49:22] lord jesus christ
[49:24] because i was chosen to not just be
[49:27] redeemed
[49:29] but i was chosen to be redeemed to be
[49:32] conformed
[49:33] to the image of god's son
[49:37] that's what the holy ghost is given
[49:40] for see but we have to
[49:43] constantly bring our body in subjection
[49:47] to the holy spirit and and if you
[49:51] let if you that's why the bible says
[49:54] let the mind which is in christ be in
[49:56] you you don't have to do that it's your
[49:57] choice
[49:58] but you have to let it you have to allow
[50:00] it you have to let
[50:02] the word of god dwell in you richly
[50:06] because if you do that the the lord will
[50:08] the lord will slip
[50:10] the lord will reach down on the uh you
[50:12] know on the on the vehicle that is this
[50:14] fallen flesh
[50:15] and he'll slip it out of gear and slip
[50:17] it into neutral and then the inner man
[50:19] will just drive everything
[50:20] but if you're not careful you'll come
[50:22] along and put it back in gear and drive
[50:23] it for a little while and end up carnal
[50:26] end up disgraced don't do that
[50:29] see let like brother richie taught us to
[50:32] say
[50:33] you know people say the lord is my
[50:34] co-pilot richie says
[50:36] if he ain't driving richie ain't riding
[50:39] so so that's that's where we want to be
[50:43] all right let's bow our heads now and go
[50:45] to the lord in prayer
[50:47] we thank you lord for this beautiful to
[50:51] where i'm at and my title consequences
[50:54] under the order of melchizedek
[50:56] all right so just like
[51:00] when we take the aaronic
[51:04] priesthood under aaron okay
[51:07] now that that un operating under that
[51:10] priesthood
[51:12] there were certain consequences based on
[51:15] what you did or didn't do you understand
[51:18] and so i i don't want to get bogged down
[51:21] into dealing with that you're
[51:22] you're you're perfectly aware of that
[51:25] that
[51:25] the law was a very rigid set of rules
[51:28] and regs
[51:29] and specifications that had to be kept
[51:33] uh very meticulously there was
[51:37] it was so uh rigid that
[51:40] there was not even a sacrifice you could
[51:42] offer for intentional sin
[51:46] there was no offering david could offer
[51:48] for what he did with bathsheba
[51:50] there was no offering to offer for that
[51:53] and and the the sentence was just simply
[51:55] death you're going to have to die
[51:57] and uh for what he did to uriah as sin
[52:00] from our lives the best that could
[52:02] happen in the old testament
[52:04] was the innocent blood of an animal but
[52:06] you couldn't even
[52:07] they had to stay in paradise in the
[52:09] lower regions of the earth they couldn't
[52:11] even go into the presence of god
[52:13] until jesus christ resurrected
[52:16] and his blood was still wet on the cross
[52:18] when he brother branham says he
[52:20] grabbed satan around the throat and
[52:22] slammed him on the ground and snatched
[52:24] the keys from him
[52:26] and then stepped over and probably
[52:27] stepped on him stepped over him
[52:29] and went and opened up paradise and led
[52:32] all of those captivity
[52:34] captive he took them captive and took
[52:37] them into the presence of god
[52:39] and also uh he also you know will put
[52:43] every kind of distraction
[52:45] in your life to keep you from realizing
[52:47] it now
[52:49] so what a great resurrection that was
[52:52] but then we realized that when the
[52:54] church and of course they had to as i
[52:55] said in my opening comments
[52:57] the church then had to go off and fall
[53:00] away that seed had to go into the ground
[53:03] because what the church had received
[53:06] was the ministry of the son of man now
[53:09] remember that when we talk about the
[53:12] ministry of the son of man
[53:14] brother branham would refer back to
[53:17] melchizedek
[53:18] who sat with his back to the tent
[53:21] and discerned the thoughts of sarah's
[53:24] heart behind him
[53:26] and in this sermon who is this
[53:28] melchizedek
[53:29] brother branham turns his back to the
[53:32] audience and starts discerning people
[53:34] and in fact is he said now there's a man
[53:38] he said he's behind me i'm looking right
[53:41] at be killed
[53:42] and you couldn't kill god you understand
[53:45] but you could kill the temple that god
[53:47] was living in
[53:48] that temple could get sick that temple
[53:50] aged at 30 he looked 50.
[53:52] you follow me so now this is why the
[53:56] bible could say this is why that he
[53:59] and all wise was tempted in all ways as
[54:02] we are tempted
[54:04] so but yet he never made a transgression
[54:06] see
[54:07] so there's nothing you can experience
[54:09] that he's not
[54:10] qualified to be a high priest for when
[54:13] you say lord i got this problem
[54:15] jesus can say i get it
[54:18] jesus can say i feel you because i lived
[54:21] that
[54:22] i know what that feels like and so
[54:25] there's nothing you could encounter from
[54:27] the cradle to the grave that he wouldn't
[54:28] understand
[54:30] you see and therefore he's the high
[54:32] priest
[54:33] of our confession so so now
[54:37] in that temptable body in that
[54:40] body that could get sick in age and die
[54:42] that could be
[54:43] tempted brother adam said jesus was
[54:45] tempted with women
[54:48] because he's a flesh man you understand
[54:51] he he didn't want to die as a man he
[54:53] said he was young he had his brethren he
[54:55] wanted to live he's praying in the
[54:57] garden if it's possible let it pass
[54:59] but then he says not my will so he had
[55:02] his own will he had a will a human will
[55:04] this is a great mystery of god in christ
[55:08] and so but we find that that he humbled
[55:11] himself
[55:12] on a daily basis and said i do always
[55:15] that which pleases the father
[55:17] he did that by his own decision
[55:20] so so so now not only was he the
[55:24] qualified
[55:25] lamb for your atonement
[55:28] but he also lived the perceptive side
[55:32] of the word and its commands on your
[55:36] behalf
[55:37] because the bible says word on top of
[55:39] word precept
[55:41] upon precept so jesus lived
[55:44] those precepts for you because you're
[55:48] always going to stumble and fluff them
[55:50] up
[55:50] you understand you repent but you still
[55:53] are doing it
[55:54] and so we find that that that because
[55:56] that he was the
[55:57] lamb of god for our atonement to bring
[56:00] to pay the price for adam's sin
[56:03] he also lived the perceptive side of
[56:06] perfection on your behalf
[56:08] so that makes him not just our atonement
[56:11] but it makes him our
[56:12] total satisfaction
[56:15] now only then now
[56:18] paul could say now there is therefore
[56:22] no condemnation to them which are in
[56:25] christ
[56:26] how could there be paul said it wasn't i
[56:29] that died it was christ that died don't
[56:31] blame me
[56:32] don't judge me i didn't die christ died
[56:35] and he rose again on my behalf and he
[56:38] lived his whole life
[56:39] on my behalf and the most incongruous
[56:43] logical unfair unreasonable
[56:46] thing that god could ever do is god
[56:50] traded the perfect innocent for the
[56:52] totally guilty
[56:54] that's the love of god that's how much
[56:58] god wants you to understand today that
[57:00] he
[57:01] traded christ for you
[57:06] that's why brother brennan would say
[57:07] what's more precious the blood of jesus
[57:09] christ or what it purchased
[57:12] i mean what's more what what was more
[57:15] valuable to me
[57:16] my money or this device well i'm holding
[57:19] it aren't i
[57:20] yeah so obviously this was more valuable
[57:22] to me than my money
[57:23] and i gave somebody my money and now
[57:25] i've got the device
[57:27] the blood of jesus christ was very
[57:29] precious to god
[57:30] but what was more precious is what god
[57:33] spent it on
[57:35] he spent the blood on you he spent that
[57:38] blood on me
[57:40] now so we find then that
[57:45] that now and that's why so so when it
[57:48] comes to melchizedek now what's the
[57:50] significance of this
[57:51] and i'm gonna have to connect these dots
[57:53] for you and go slow
[57:55] so when you realize that christ
[57:59] was lit was living again
[58:03] that example of the son of man
[58:07] the word made flesh that's what
[58:09] melchizedek was
[58:10] he wasn't born he was created god built
[58:13] a body and stepped in it
[58:14] it's not the same as jesus jesus was the
[58:16] only begotten
[58:17] of the father so brother branham uses
[58:21] melchizedek
[58:23] as and he says this this is the example
[58:26] that every son and daughter is going to
[58:28] come to you're not going to become jesus
[58:30] christ you're going to become
[58:31] mrs jesus christ understand when brother
[58:34] branham says
[58:35] she is him she's not he's not saying
[58:37] she's literally him
[58:38] what he's saying according to hebrews 13
[58:41] 8 she's the same as him
[58:43] [Music]
[58:44] understand she's the same as him he's
[58:47] him i'm
[58:48] we're we're the bride and and and and
[58:50] therefore
[58:51] it's it's under her prophet the bride
[58:54] under her prophet who's under christ is
[58:56] the final voice to the final age
[58:59] so i'm here to tell you something
[59:01] friends you know we
[59:02] we we have the authority invested in us
[59:05] but christ is still the preeminent one
[59:09] jesus christ is is the preeminent
[59:12] brother branham said any
[59:14] teaching any doctrine that diminishes
[59:18] the supremacy of jesus christ is a false
[59:21] doctrine
[59:22] see so we have one lord one faith
[59:25] one baptism and so we realize that
[59:28] yes the bride comes into a relational
[59:31] relationship where
[59:33] it's so close that the spirit and the
[59:35] bride say come
[59:37] they're speaking in one because why it's
[59:39] been there's been an invisible union
[59:42] what what's what's the invisible part
[59:44] about the world don't see it
[59:47] the world looks at us and says oh it's a
[59:49] cult it's an off scour it's nothing it's
[59:51] uneducated it's illiterate
[59:53] and and and and it's led you know led
[59:55] with false teaching but
[59:56] but we happen to already know that's not
[59:59] true
[1:00:00] that what we are is simply what god
[1:00:02] promised he would do
[1:00:03] he would reproduce himself in a bride
[1:00:06] who would be a product of this
[1:00:09] not a product of man-made ideology
[1:00:13] so when so when when so melchizedek is
[1:00:16] the model
[1:00:18] that brother branham would go back to
[1:00:21] for the minute to show the ministry of
[1:00:23] the son of man he would go there
[1:00:25] and he would go to to into saint john's
[1:00:28] gospel
[1:00:28] to the woman at the well see and and
[1:00:31] then he would say
[1:00:32] look here it is again a man meets a
[1:00:34] woman and there's segregation there's
[1:00:36] political strife
[1:00:37] and and here he's standing in a prayer
[1:00:39] line says now we're just like back the
[1:00:41] woman at the well he said i'm just a man
[1:00:43] it's just a woman and so so now when you
[1:00:46] look at jesus
[1:00:48] and nicodemus comes to him in the middle
[1:00:51] of the night
[1:00:53] and he says you know we who's we
[1:00:56] the whole sanhedrin all the
[1:01:00] teachers we know
[1:01:03] you're come from god because nobody
[1:01:06] could do
[1:01:07] what you're doing we haven't seen that
[1:01:10] since
[1:01:11] the man that met melchizedek we haven't
[1:01:14] seen anyone
[1:01:15] who could literally not only
[1:01:18] discern the secrets of the heart because
[1:01:20] prophets could do that
[1:01:22] remember elisha told the king of israel
[1:01:25] what the king of syria was thinking in
[1:01:27] his bed chamber remember that
[1:01:29] but but we're not talking about just
[1:01:31] simply discerning the thoughts of a
[1:01:33] heart
[1:01:34] but now discerning the thoughts of a
[1:01:36] heart and
[1:01:37] speaking eternal life and granting
[1:01:40] because
[1:01:40] now jesus can forgive sins you
[1:01:43] understand
[1:01:44] you you eat of him and you'll never die
[1:01:47] you understand so so nicodemus is saying
[1:01:52] we haven't seen that because when he
[1:01:54] came
[1:01:55] not only did he discern the thoughts of
[1:01:58] sarah's heart
[1:01:58] but he confirmed the promise and the
[1:02:00] next year she had a baby
[1:02:03] so there couldn't be nobody but god and
[1:02:05] so what we're saying you jesus is we
[1:02:08] know
[1:02:09] that that that that was typing you we
[1:02:12] know that that
[1:02:13] that that was a pre-figure of the
[1:02:15] messiah and you must be because we
[1:02:17] haven't seen anybody that could do that
[1:02:20] with all of the above and check all the
[1:02:22] boxes
[1:02:23] since that day and so so you realize
[1:02:27] then that this is why brother branham
[1:02:28] would say
[1:02:29] that that ministry of the son of man
[1:02:31] that's why
[1:02:32] it would repeat in the end time because
[1:02:35] the ministry of the son of man
[1:02:37] wasn't simply just in the seventh
[1:02:41] church age the ministry of the son of
[1:02:43] man was in the upper room that's what
[1:02:45] came on them
[1:02:46] jesus said a little while and the world
[1:02:49] won't see me but you'll see me because
[1:02:51] i'll be with you even in you
[1:02:53] and when christ come into his church
[1:02:55] that was the word made flesh
[1:02:57] and that's the ministry of the son of
[1:02:58] man you understand
[1:03:00] and so they not only had the ministry of
[1:03:02] the son of man but they had
[1:03:04] the office of a son of man and paul
[1:03:06] because paul was a prophet
[1:03:09] but but when the prophet leaves the
[1:03:11] scene when the office of son of man
[1:03:13] leaves the scene that doesn't mean the
[1:03:14] ministry of the son of man left
[1:03:16] because the ministry was still in the
[1:03:17] church our prophet went home
[1:03:19] more than 50 years ago that does not
[1:03:22] diminish the ministry of the son of man
[1:03:24] and this bride in fact is as she's grown
[1:03:27] and matured it's increased
[1:03:31] and and and it's and it's a recognition
[1:03:33] of who you are
[1:03:34] and your place in the kingdom of god is
[1:03:36] what gives you authority there's nothing
[1:03:39] to garner authority more more
[1:03:42] than by receiving the revealed word
[1:03:46] of the hour so we find then that
[1:03:52] no wonder not now no wonder
[1:03:57] brother branham would say on it
[1:04:00] for easter what a resurrection that was
[1:04:03] at calvary
[1:04:04] but what a resurrection this is because
[1:04:08] now what happened at calvary we've got
[1:04:10] it again
[1:04:11] see they had that in the early church as
[1:04:13] i was saying
[1:04:15] they they that the the early church
[1:04:19] took what israel as a nation rejected
[1:04:22] what it israel been promised
[1:04:23] say what was the upper room brother
[1:04:25] jason what was the upper room what was
[1:04:27] that all about
[1:04:29] and why did they have to wait 10 days
[1:04:32] because what that was all about was the
[1:04:34] jubilee
[1:04:35] which is 50. and christ had raised and
[1:04:38] had been among them for 40 days and 40
[1:04:40] nights
[1:04:41] and he was leaving but there was 10 days
[1:04:43] remaining they couldn't get the holy
[1:04:44] ghost until the 10th
[1:04:46] till 10 more days because it had to be
[1:04:47] 50. and the jubilee
[1:04:50] say what was the jubilee the jubilee
[1:04:54] was when he would no longer write his
[1:04:57] laws on stone
[1:04:59] but he would write them in their hearts
[1:05:02] and he would take out their old spirit
[1:05:05] and he would give them a new spirit and
[1:05:07] then he said then i'll give you
[1:05:08] my spirit this is what christ
[1:05:11] came to do we don't hear no more of
[1:05:14] melchizedek he showed what he would be
[1:05:16] when he became a man and when he became
[1:05:17] a man
[1:05:18] hallelujah then christ gave
[1:05:21] he said a little while they won't see me
[1:05:23] but you'll see me i'll be with you even
[1:05:25] in you
[1:05:26] what was transitioning remember they
[1:05:27] wanted jesus
[1:05:29] to to go to the let's be make you a king
[1:05:31] now
[1:05:33] and jesus said no we can't do that he
[1:05:36] said i've got to be betrayed in the
[1:05:37] hands of centered and killed and dries
[1:05:39] on the third day oh lord
[1:05:40] well i'll never let that happen and
[1:05:43] peter meant it i mean he grabs a sword
[1:05:46] and whacks off the ear of the of the
[1:05:48] high priest servant i promise you he
[1:05:49] wasn't aiming for his ear
[1:05:54] he wasn't aiming for his ear and and so
[1:05:57] you know jesus has to put your sword
[1:05:59] away and has reach and recreate a new
[1:06:01] ear on the man and
[1:06:02] you know and so so we find that that
[1:06:06] that what's happening coming into the
[1:06:08] church
[1:06:08] was the jubilee which was the abstract
[1:06:10] which was what
[1:06:11] adam had lost adam had lost the book of
[1:06:15] redemption that
[1:06:17] john sees in the hands of the one on the
[1:06:19] throne
[1:06:20] i understand well why is it a seven
[1:06:24] sealed book on the in the hands of the
[1:06:27] one on the throne
[1:06:29] why is it a seven sealed book because
[1:06:32] when it was released
[1:06:34] to the church as the jubilee which
[1:06:37] restored the abstract
[1:06:38] which gave him the title deed which gave
[1:06:40] him the holy ghost which made the son of
[1:06:42] man ministry
[1:06:43] but then that church backslid after the
[1:06:46] disciples went away and the apostles all
[1:06:48] died you understand
[1:06:50] so now and of course it had to the seed
[1:06:52] had to go into the ground
[1:06:54] jesus told them when they wanted to make
[1:06:56] him king
[1:06:57] we can't do it that way because if i
[1:07:00] don't die
[1:07:01] then i'll just never have a family i'll
[1:07:04] be alone
[1:07:05] see and i didn't come here to stay alone
[1:07:08] that was how i was in the eternities
[1:07:10] i created all i got i kicked this all
[1:07:12] off so that i wouldn't be alone
[1:07:14] and now you're here wanting to interrupt
[1:07:16] my plan don't interrupt my plan peter
[1:07:18] get out of the way
[1:07:19] the cup my father hath given me to drink
[1:07:22] shall i not drink it are you kidding
[1:07:24] i've invested all my whole life to drink
[1:07:26] it and now i'm right at the moment
[1:07:28] and i'm going to get the big payoff i'm
[1:07:30] going to finally have my
[1:07:31] family that i lost that adam lost
[1:07:34] control of and the devil held it i'm
[1:07:35] finally going to get him back
[1:07:38] you understand and so when he died and
[1:07:41] went down and
[1:07:42] body slams the devil takes the keys from
[1:07:45] him opens up the prison doors ascends
[1:07:47] back
[1:07:47] up on high scene of many for 40 days and
[1:07:50] 40 nights
[1:07:51] ascends into glory sent back his life
[1:07:54] into the church
[1:07:55] now the title now the book is opened
[1:07:58] again
[1:07:59] now the title deed the abstract the
[1:08:02] power the authority is back in the
[1:08:04] church again
[1:08:05] amen the ministry of the son of man
[1:08:08] the minute the the the the ministry of
[1:08:11] melchizedek
[1:08:12] is among them
[1:08:16] but that seed had to go into the ground
[1:08:19] you get me
[1:08:20] because if it if it if it didn't then
[1:08:24] only that early church would be and what
[1:08:26] about me and you
[1:08:27] yeah you know we were at the back of the
[1:08:30] line going keep it coming
[1:08:32] keep it no no no don't stop keep it
[1:08:34] coming
[1:08:36] you know and so so it had to go under
[1:08:39] the ground it had to fall away and when
[1:08:41] it falls away
[1:08:42] when they fall away into sin well
[1:08:45] instead of christ coming to
[1:08:46] get his bride for a rapture he has to
[1:08:49] sit back down
[1:08:50] close the books seal it in seven seals
[1:08:53] and wait for the seventh age
[1:08:55] because because this is the mystery of
[1:08:57] life and he can't let somebody
[1:08:59] have access to the mystery of life in a
[1:09:01] fallen condition
[1:09:02] you can't do it on a hybrid gospel
[1:09:04] that's why in the book of genesis he had
[1:09:05] to guard the way to the tree of life he
[1:09:06] ran them out
[1:09:07] lest they put forth their hand take of
[1:09:09] the tree of life in a fallen state and
[1:09:10] live forever
[1:09:12] now the whole plan's messed up so god
[1:09:14] simply seals it up sets back down christ
[1:09:16] steps back in the eternities to
[1:09:18] intercede for the ignorance but he
[1:09:20] promised that in the last day
[1:09:22] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:09:24] angel when he begins to sound
[1:09:26] the mystery be finished why because now
[1:09:30] when john saw the heavenly host
[1:09:34] he he saw he a strong angel standing
[1:09:36] beside him
[1:09:37] there's there's the mighty one on the
[1:09:39] throne there's the sea of glass
[1:09:41] there's the four and 20 elders there's
[1:09:43] angelic host
[1:09:45] there's everybody there but when he when
[1:09:47] he's weeping
[1:09:48] because no one can open it amen
[1:09:52] then somebody who's who was already
[1:09:57] at the end of the book and saw the whole
[1:09:59] thing was standing there
[1:10:00] and knew it's all going to be okay puts
[1:10:04] a handle and says don't weep john he's
[1:10:05] got this it's okay don't worry
[1:10:08] trust me i'm already here in the lord's
[1:10:09] day i'm already at the completed cycle
[1:10:11] and i see we make it
[1:10:13] so don't fear stop crying the lion of
[1:10:16] the tribe of judah hath prevailed
[1:10:17] and when john turned to see a lion he
[1:10:19] saw a lamb and brother branham said
[1:10:20] john had not noticed the lamb because he
[1:10:23] had been back in there
[1:10:25] behind interceding in the eternities he
[1:10:28] stepped forward out of the eternities
[1:10:30] friends and he come and took the book
[1:10:32] and broke the seals
[1:10:34] and sent it down to his prophet with
[1:10:36] express
[1:10:37] instructions tell the people to eat
[1:10:40] this and when they eat this they'll turn
[1:10:43] it'll turn them into me
[1:10:45] because this is my seed hallelujah
[1:10:49] what a resurrection that was what a
[1:10:51] resurrection this
[1:10:52] is amen
[1:10:56] amen what an easter time.
[1:11:01] so you must come under the order of
[1:11:03] melchizedek which
[1:11:05] can only come by the message of the hour
[1:11:08] because the order of melchizedek
[1:11:10] is the order of perfect atonement
[1:11:13] perfect redemption see as i said that
[1:11:16] seven sealed book with that was a symbol
[1:11:19] what it was was the bible it was the new
[1:11:21] testament
[1:11:22] because it was in the new testament that
[1:11:24] all the abstract rights were going to be
[1:11:26] restored
[1:11:28] everything man was going to have access
[1:11:29] to god again like adam had
[1:11:31] man was going to have power and
[1:11:32] authority his family like adam had but
[1:11:34] adam lost it all now it's being given
[1:11:36] back
[1:11:37] now they're getting their abstract title
[1:11:39] back now they've got the holy ghost now
[1:11:40] they've got the jubilee
[1:11:42] and so when they go off into failure
[1:11:45] it's sealed up to the end time
[1:11:46] where it's released again and now a
[1:11:49] bride
[1:11:50] and listen friends that early church
[1:11:53] could not avoid
[1:11:55] falling away because that seed brother
[1:11:57] branham said it like that over and over
[1:12:00] and over
[1:12:01] he said it had to go in the ground
[1:12:04] it had to it had to it
[1:12:07] had to go into the ground but now at the
[1:12:10] end time you realize
[1:12:12] there's no more ages
[1:12:16] the bride leaves the seventh church age
[1:12:18] and goes in a rapture
[1:12:20] and therefore god has predestinated this
[1:12:24] bride
[1:12:24] is predestinated to not fall
[1:12:28] you can't fall it's already been
[1:12:32] fixed in the mind of god and it will
[1:12:35] happen and it is
[1:12:37] happening and i know you don't feel
[1:12:40] worthy i don't feel worthy we have our
[1:12:42] ups and downs
[1:12:43] i'm still trapped in this flesh but i
[1:12:45] got an inner man that loves god
[1:12:47] i got an inner man what a resurrection
[1:12:50] this is amen
[1:12:54] so under this order under this order we
[1:12:57] are priests and kings
[1:12:59] over our flesh the world
[1:13:02] the devil and sin under this order
[1:13:06] that's why
[1:13:07] outside of this order of the revealed
[1:13:09] word you're not a king and priest over
[1:13:11] that
[1:13:12] you can't you're not a priest you can't
[1:13:15] summon redemption for your children
[1:13:18] because you're outside of the atonement
[1:13:20] you see when you're a priest
[1:13:22] you're you have to be authorized and now
[1:13:25] i can
[1:13:26] take my token and apply it to my home
[1:13:29] and claim all of my children why
[1:13:33] because i've got the authority of a
[1:13:35] priest
[1:13:36] because the the the example of
[1:13:39] melchizedek the word made flesh
[1:13:41] this minister of the son of man is
[1:13:43] living in me today i have the token
[1:13:46] i have the abstract i have the power
[1:13:48] behind the jubilee
[1:13:51] we have power to cast out devils and
[1:13:53] heal the sick and raise the dead
[1:13:56] preach the gospel and drive back spirits
[1:13:58] of unbelief
[1:14:01] you're in a place of liberty today
[1:14:04] see so under this when i live that way
[1:14:08] then i'm a king over my flesh not the
[1:14:10] other way around
[1:14:12] i'm a king over the devils why brother
[1:14:13] abraham would always remind us
[1:14:15] we don't live by the mercies of lucifer
[1:14:19] stop acting like you do stop letting him
[1:14:21] tell you that you do
[1:14:22] you don't live by his mercies he don't
[1:14:24] run nothing but his mouth
[1:14:26] he doesn't run my life he makes no
[1:14:28] decisions about my life all my life is
[1:14:30] in the hands of god
[1:14:31] see so but but we realize that our life
[1:14:36] then is a
[1:14:37] is to be a constant maturing growing
[1:14:39] because remember
[1:14:41] we were redeemed to be conformed to the
[1:14:43] image of his son
[1:14:46] all right so i'm
[1:14:49] really going to have to hurry wow can't
[1:14:51] believe the time is flying like that
[1:14:53] so so then for the bible says for though
[1:14:56] we
[1:14:57] walk in the flesh we do not war
[1:15:00] after the flesh that's why we read
[1:15:02] romans 7.
[1:15:04] you're free from it you don't no one can
[1:15:07] make you be a sinner anymore
[1:15:10] you actually now have a fighting chance
[1:15:12] to try to serve god
[1:15:15] that's real freedom people leave the
[1:15:18] word claiming they want freedom the word
[1:15:20] is the only thing that gives you freedom
[1:15:22] because now it actually makes you able
[1:15:25] to try to serve god
[1:15:27] see and you say yeah but i still fail
[1:15:30] the bride that goes home brother branham
[1:15:32] says in the church age book right at the
[1:15:34] end
[1:15:35] near the church age book that that that
[1:15:38] as the bride
[1:15:39] receives this word and it's an
[1:15:40] identification with her lord
[1:15:43] see then he says then as the
[1:15:47] then as the headstone nears
[1:15:50] and she becomes more and more like him
[1:15:53] uh then than that then he said that
[1:15:56] lifts her from the earth and she goes in
[1:15:58] a rapture
[1:15:59] he doesn't ever say you reach fleshly
[1:16:02] perfection
[1:16:04] he says when you go when you get lifted
[1:16:06] off the earth you're fighting
[1:16:08] trying you're trying
[1:16:11] you've now got a fighting chance you now
[1:16:14] don't have to worry about your failures
[1:16:16] you know why
[1:16:18] because they don't count
[1:16:21] and someday you're going to just realize
[1:16:23] just that i am an elected child of god
[1:16:26] ordained of god to believe this word and
[1:16:29] failures i may have but there is now
[1:16:31] therefore no condemnation to me because
[1:16:33] i
[1:16:34] am in christ there's no one who can even
[1:16:36] accuse me i can't be indicted
[1:16:37] i'm above the law it doesn't apply to me
[1:16:42] hallelujah see
[1:16:46] so we find then that you know
[1:16:49] abraham you know that it's typed in
[1:16:51] abraham if you see the bible
[1:16:53] talks about uh ishmael that ishmael was
[1:16:56] a son of the flesh he was a son of his
[1:16:58] desire
[1:16:59] but he also had a son of the promise you
[1:17:02] understand
[1:17:03] and so the son of the promise didn't
[1:17:05] come the way the son of desire came the
[1:17:07] son of the flesh
[1:17:08] and so we realized that that that the
[1:17:10] seed line of christ comes through the
[1:17:12] child of promise
[1:17:14] not through this flesh you're not going
[1:17:16] to score enough
[1:17:17] points in your flesh to get home
[1:17:22] the ticket is too expensive and you
[1:17:24] can't afford it
[1:17:26] all the good works go to a convent live
[1:17:29] in a seclusion
[1:17:30] pray constantly and mumble prayers you
[1:17:33] the price is too high
[1:17:35] you can't pay it and the good news is it
[1:17:38] don't cost you a dime it's already been
[1:17:40] paid
[1:17:42] hallelujah so
[1:17:45] we hear this message to come up this is
[1:17:48] what john heard come up higher
[1:17:50] this is the this is the start of the
[1:17:52] rapture that's what people they
[1:17:54] get so confused on well but chapter four
[1:17:56] is the physical rapture of the church
[1:17:59] but we find and that in a sense that's
[1:18:02] true because that's
[1:18:03] the bride goes physically in a rapture
[1:18:05] at the end of the seventh age that she
[1:18:06] doesn't go into an eighth age she
[1:18:07] ends goes at the end of the seventh age
[1:18:10] but at the same time the rapture's not a
[1:18:12] one lightning strike event the rapture
[1:18:14] is a three-phase cycle
[1:18:16] so yes chapter four begins the rapture
[1:18:19] of course
[1:18:19] it's the shout it's the ministry
[1:18:21] melchizedek it's the son of man
[1:18:23] it's the scene for the opening of the
[1:18:24] book it's the time brother i'm called
[1:18:26] it's a time of setting of judgment
[1:18:28] it's when it's when the world is making
[1:18:30] their choice and the bride is making her
[1:18:33] choice
[1:18:34] i'll tell you something friends brother
[1:18:36] jack duff says it so beautifully
[1:18:38] you'll never hear the the
[1:18:41] word come up unless you first hear and
[1:18:44] obey the word to come out of
[1:18:46] [Music]
[1:18:48] if you refuse come out of her my people
[1:18:50] you'll never hear come up
[1:18:52] the only way you hear come up is you got
[1:18:54] to hear come out
[1:18:56] come up and go in hallelujah
[1:18:59] oh my you know we see
[1:19:03] this world that we live in and i've seen
[1:19:06] it coming
[1:19:08] we've talked about it you know uh
[1:19:11] but but it's it's hard to get our minds
[1:19:14] wrapped around the fear that it created
[1:19:16] in us the apprehension and it that
[1:19:19] doesn't make us bad people just makes us
[1:19:21] human
[1:19:22] that we knew that these things would
[1:19:25] start coming into the world
[1:19:27] and you know because every year we go
[1:19:30] away say oh i
[1:19:32] i wish things could go back to normal
[1:19:34] well
[1:19:35] every year we go further away from
[1:19:37] normal
[1:19:39] and it's not going back you understand
[1:19:42] it can't
[1:19:43] can't get better it must continue to get
[1:19:45] worse and worse till jesus comes
[1:19:48] so so every year it it it it
[1:19:51] goes further away from normal and it
[1:19:53] doesn't even matter what the graph shows
[1:19:54] in the short term like you look at a
[1:19:56] graph of the stock market it looks like
[1:19:57] it's going up and down but if you
[1:19:59] if you back up and take a broader look
[1:20:01] you can see yeah it's going up and down
[1:20:03] while it's going up it's still going up
[1:20:06] and so you're
[1:20:06] watching a broad trend and so i mean you
[1:20:09] you you you come up to the first woe and
[1:20:12] it looks like wow
[1:20:13] perfect time for the end of the world
[1:20:15] world war never had happened
[1:20:17] but yet they solved that problem the
[1:20:19] angels were stopped
[1:20:21] see because it would have just went to
[1:20:23] the first one the second or third one it
[1:20:24] was wrapped up and he couldn't let that
[1:20:25] happen because i wasn't even born yet
[1:20:28] i i still had to come and believe the
[1:20:30] word see
[1:20:31] you say how ordained were you to believe
[1:20:34] the word
[1:20:35] i stopped a world war
[1:20:41] how ordained was i to believe it i
[1:20:42] stopped the world war
[1:20:44] god said it wouldn't matter if i'd have
[1:20:45] been the only one he'd have stopped it
[1:20:47] for me
[1:20:48] said you can't hold up we got i got a
[1:20:50] servant where's he at well he ain't here
[1:20:51] yet
[1:20:53] but he's on his way well where's he at
[1:20:55] well his grandfather's here but we'll
[1:20:56] get to his dad and then he'll get here
[1:21:00] but anyway you got to stop because we
[1:21:02] can't leave him
[1:21:06] oh my
[1:21:09] and so so we realize that a lot of times
[1:21:12] in the short term i mean
[1:21:13] between the first and second well it
[1:21:15] looked like oh
[1:21:16] we escaped it we got we got kind of got
[1:21:18] back to normal
[1:21:20] you really did and you were just heading
[1:21:21] more toward the second whoa
[1:21:24] and when finally world war ii was over
[1:21:26] they danced and blew horns and trumpets
[1:21:28] and shot
[1:21:29] fireworks and danced in the street and
[1:21:31] and gi's you know kissed nurses
[1:21:34] remember all the big pictures and v-v-e
[1:21:36] day and then v-j day and or
[1:21:38] the other way around but but we find
[1:21:41] that that
[1:21:42] and it says oh and and then the the
[1:21:44] 1950s roll in and there's prosperity and
[1:21:46] the american dream and it looks like oh
[1:21:48] wow
[1:21:49] but you know what all it was was just
[1:21:52] gradually getting worse still
[1:21:55] a lot of times you know you could have
[1:21:56] little respites in between
[1:21:59] you know ups and downs of your life and
[1:22:00] it looks like maybe
[1:22:02] maybe you know okay finally okay they
[1:22:05] finally got some
[1:22:06] some antivirus medication for this
[1:22:09] terrible virus killing all these
[1:22:10] millions of people
[1:22:11] and uh well guess what it you know
[1:22:14] there's five more behind this one
[1:22:18] it's not getting better
[1:22:22] and when those five come there's ten
[1:22:24] more behind that one
[1:22:26] so i just say let's throw off the fear
[1:22:28] now
[1:22:29] let's just throw it off now because it
[1:22:31] ain't gonna stop
[1:22:32] i'm just gonna have to trust the lord oh
[1:22:34] sure i'll do what's prudent i'm happy to
[1:22:36] do what's prudent
[1:22:37] i'll i'll take the measures and take the
[1:22:39] steps and take a shot and do whatever
[1:22:41] they want i want to be prudent i want to
[1:22:43] be safe
[1:22:44] i don't want to risk infecting other
[1:22:45] people i don't want to have
[1:22:47] residual effects of a virus but the
[1:22:49] joe's suffering just from residual
[1:22:51] effects
[1:22:52] bar has been gone from him for a long
[1:22:53] time so i don't even want
[1:22:56] there's nothing wrong with prudent
[1:22:58] preparation and caution
[1:23:00] that's sensible you're you're not
[1:23:03] sensible to not do that
[1:23:04] but but the fact of it is operating in
[1:23:07] prudence and operating in fear
[1:23:09] two different things i will not
[1:23:12] be afraid especially me
[1:23:17] i'm here to tell you something friends i
[1:23:18] thought i was fine when i wasn't
[1:23:24] you know you know who was conspiring to
[1:23:26] take me out
[1:23:28] me and my on-again off-again
[1:23:30] relationship with lucifer
[1:23:35] that's who conspires to do you the most
[1:23:37] harm it's your on-again-off-again
[1:23:38] relationship with him
[1:23:40] you know i had i i had reached i didn't
[1:23:43] know
[1:23:44] i had reached a point of no return i had
[1:23:46] already crossed the line
[1:23:48] i was perhaps hours or days away from
[1:23:50] passing away and no way to stop it
[1:23:53] you understand and so so so
[1:23:57] so so you know we when i began to
[1:24:00] look at it this way and i i i didn't
[1:24:03] know
[1:24:04] that my natural heart was struggling to
[1:24:06] live
[1:24:07] i didn't know that i felt fine i felt a
[1:24:10] little tired
[1:24:11] had a little bit of funny indigestion
[1:24:12] feeling when i walked
[1:24:14] never imagining my whole life i've been
[1:24:17] athletic and strong and
[1:24:19] and even when i would go have ekgs they
[1:24:21] put me on an ekg and tested my
[1:24:23] ekg'ed me with 12 leads every four hours
[1:24:27] i never gave so much blood in all my
[1:24:28] life every four hours
[1:24:30] took a couple gallons that not really
[1:24:32] but took
[1:24:34] took blood out of me and i don't mind
[1:24:36] you know nurses are
[1:24:37] love it because i'm an easy stick they
[1:24:39] say my veins show and
[1:24:40] and it was really and i don't ever not
[1:24:42] afraid of needles but my
[1:24:44] goodness again you're here again you
[1:24:46] were just here four hours ago yeah and
[1:24:47] we'll be here in four hours from now and
[1:24:49] four hours from then
[1:24:50] all through the night the next day and
[1:24:52] you know no
[1:24:53] enzymes are showing up blood was fine
[1:24:55] ekg was fine
[1:24:57] miss wykins you've got the heart of an
[1:24:58] athlete i've had so many doctors tell me
[1:25:00] that because my heart is strong
[1:25:01] ejection fraction is strong but no one
[1:25:03] knew
[1:25:05] that the line's leading for the blood
[1:25:07] supply that the heart was being starved
[1:25:10] because the arteries leading to it were
[1:25:12] backed up
[1:25:14] you understand and so i i i i didn't
[1:25:17] know my heart was struggling to live
[1:25:19] i couldn't tell that my natural heart
[1:25:22] was being starved of
[1:25:23] of the life-giving resource it needed
[1:25:26] sometimes we get that way spiritually
[1:25:30] and you think you're fine when you're
[1:25:31] not
[1:25:33] because the holy ghost you live by the
[1:25:35] holy ghost and the holy ghost feeds on
[1:25:37] the word
[1:25:38] the heart lives by the blood and the
[1:25:39] oxygen if it can't get it the heart dies
[1:25:43] the holy ghost feeds on the word if he
[1:25:45] can't get it
[1:25:49] if all he ever gets is worldly
[1:25:50] entertainment and he never gets this
[1:25:53] say how do i give him this read it
[1:25:57] hear it read hear it preached about
[1:26:01] talk to the talk to the author of the
[1:26:03] book
[1:26:05] turn on a tape come to a church service
[1:26:07] fellowship a brother or sister
[1:26:09] [Music]
[1:26:10] whatsoever things are good and lovely
[1:26:13] and of a good report think on these
[1:26:14] things
[1:26:15] see and so you know i
[1:26:18] i can tell you friends what i found out
[1:26:21] is
[1:26:22] that you know my choice to live a
[1:26:25] healthy lifestyle was taken from me
[1:26:28] because i was always conspiring you know
[1:26:31] with the enemy of my flesh
[1:26:33] you know and i mean i was just waiting
[1:26:36] for them to
[1:26:37] create an iv with nacho cheese doritos
[1:26:40] in it
[1:26:40] because i was hooked on that for years
[1:26:45] and inactivity and eating bad foods and
[1:26:48] eating things that weren't good for me
[1:26:50] and hey when i was in my 20s and 30s my
[1:26:52] young body just handled all that stuff
[1:26:54] it didn't work what that wasn't it
[1:26:56] wasn't working anymore once i got older
[1:26:58] and no one knew that because i had no
[1:27:01] signs of it
[1:27:02] and i i hope you're catching the the the
[1:27:05] spiritual i can tell you friends that if
[1:27:07] your lifestyle is made up
[1:27:09] of a lack of good food and proper
[1:27:11] exercise and you eat bad and
[1:27:13] consume bad things and smoke cigarettes
[1:27:15] and drink and take stimulants and live a
[1:27:18] wild life

[1:27:25] dealt with
[1:27:26] and and you know just just like the same

[1:27:50] many
[1:27:50] fathers have perished trying to save a
[1:27:52] drowning child because they themselves
[1:27:54] they didn't realize how unhealthy they
[1:27:56] were what they could have done in their
[1:27:58] 20s they can't do now
[1:27:59] and i'm here to tell you something
[1:28:00] friends let a spiritual demon come into
[1:28:03] your house and get a hold of your child

[1:34:09] brother branham says in the laodicean
[1:34:13] church age
[1:34:15] he says now i said a moment ago oh
[1:34:18] here's the one i was
[1:34:20] butchered up trying to quote it to you
[1:34:21] from memory
[1:34:23] he says i said a moment ago that the
[1:34:26] false vine came into full fruition in
[1:34:28] this age
[1:34:30] her fruit would mature and ripen
[1:34:33] he says that's correct now we see that
[1:34:37] we see the false vines fruit fully
[1:34:40] grown mature ripened the world can't get
[1:34:44] enough of it
[1:34:46] and it's madness and it's poisonous
[1:34:50] listen friends the the earth isn't going
[1:34:52] to just keep going on
[1:34:54] not in not god's done with man running
[1:34:57] things
[1:34:58] god's done with satan's eden he's not
[1:35:00] just going to let it keep going the last
[1:35:02] only thing that's done is to accomplish
[1:35:04] his purpose
[1:35:05] to find that last name in his plan and
[1:35:08] that's all we're here for doing now
[1:35:10] we're not even here we we got to stop
[1:35:13] saying brother branham said now all we
[1:35:14] got to do is lay in the presence of the
[1:35:15] sun
[1:35:16] and ripen that was half century ago
[1:35:19] i'm pretty sure we're ripened i'm pretty
[1:35:22] sure we know what he wants done with his
[1:35:24] word i know we have thus saith the lord
[1:35:27] amen
[1:35:28] and we know what he wants done with his
[1:35:29] word and so we're trying to find that
[1:35:32] last seed and we
[1:35:33] have an exodus in front of us but i'm
[1:35:35] saying it for contrast because i'm
[1:35:37] preaching on consequences
[1:35:38] see on consequences he says the evil
[1:35:42] spirited church
[1:35:43] full of iniquity will be revealed as the
[1:35:46] mustard seed
[1:35:49] that grew into a tree wherein large
[1:35:51] files of the are you remember in matthew
[1:35:52] 13 when jesus gives that parable that a
[1:35:56] mustard seed is a it's the
[1:35:57] tiniest little seed
[1:36:01] and when it gets planted it grows a tree
[1:36:04] and the fowls of the air lodge in it and
[1:36:06] we find out from the book of revelation
[1:36:09] that that was a tree of the antichrist
[1:36:12] and the ones that are lodging in its
[1:36:14] branches those fouls
[1:36:15] are demons understand
[1:36:19] and it was all from this one little tiny
[1:36:21] seed
[1:36:22] see it's consequences the false
[1:36:25] seed of discrepancy got planted it grew
[1:36:27] tree
[1:36:29] and the tree housed the fowls and the
[1:36:30] fowls have taken over the world
[1:36:33] all from a little seed so don't don't
[1:36:36] plant
[1:36:36] seeds of discrepancy stop doing that
[1:36:39] because they grow
[1:36:41] plant this and then this all over they
[1:36:44] say well i've planted so many weeds now
[1:36:46] it doesn't matter plant this
[1:36:48] it'll it'll kill out the weeds and
[1:36:50] you'll grow a crop a crop of
[1:36:52] righteousness in your life
[1:36:55] he says the evil spirited church full of
[1:36:57] iniquity
[1:37:00] will be revealed as the mustard seed
[1:37:01] that grew into a tree wherein lodge the
[1:37:03] fowls of the air
[1:37:04] at her head would be the antichrist the
[1:37:05] mystery of iniquity all this is true
[1:37:08] now watch here's a contrast and
[1:37:12] all this is true and if this is true
[1:37:15] then it must also be true that the bride
[1:37:18] church will mature
[1:37:21] now i don't have to convince you at all
[1:37:23] that the antichrist has matured
[1:37:27] i mean what we see on the streets and in
[1:37:29] the news
[1:37:30] is unimaginable
[1:37:34] it's mature well if you can see that say
[1:37:36] well i don't see it in me do you see
[1:37:38] that
[1:37:38] yes well then it's in you so what i
[1:37:42] don't see it doesn't matter
[1:37:43] you see it there yeah i see it then it's
[1:37:44] in you because they're growing together
[1:37:47] see
[1:37:50] her rightness shall be an identification
[1:37:54] with her lord
[1:37:56] by means of the word
[1:37:59] and her head will come to her
[1:38:03] uh is the is the mystery of godliness
[1:38:06] don't sing just yet just keep the music
[1:38:07] playing
[1:38:08] is the mystery of godliness see
[1:38:12] which indeed is christ and as the false
[1:38:16] church
[1:38:16] with all cunning and diabolical power
[1:38:20] made up of political force physical
[1:38:23] force
[1:38:23] and demons of darkness come against this
[1:38:26] true vine
[1:38:28] are they the true vine
[1:38:32] with the fullness of the spirit and the
[1:38:34] word will do the very acts of power that
[1:38:36] jesus did then
[1:38:38] as she nears her headstone becoming
[1:38:42] like him wasn't necessary that she had
[1:38:45] to
[1:38:45] be an exact perfect human being she's
[1:38:48] nearing the headstone she's becoming
[1:38:51] like him
[1:38:51] through the word jesus will come
[1:38:56] that the bride and groom may be forever
[1:38:58] united as one
[1:39:03] say brother jason i see what the
[1:39:07] word requires and i'm i'm not there

[1:41:36] that's all that needs to happen
[1:41:39] jesus multiplies you don't
[1:41:43] jesus you better be glad because if he
[1:41:46] only added and subtracted if you spent
[1:41:48] the last 20 years serving the devil
[1:41:49] you'd need 20 years to serve the lord
[1:41:51] just to get even
[1:41:53] thank god he multiplies
[1:41:57] by the powers of magnitude oh
[1:42:00] friends i've seen god take a life full
[1:42:03] of sin for 20
[1:42:04] 30 years and turn it around and in three
[1:42:07] months
[1:42:07] it's such a different person though
[1:42:09] nobody even recognizes that person
[1:42:12] oh i get to live you know what happens
[1:42:14] friends
[1:42:15] i want to say this
[1:42:19] because of who
[1:42:22] this melchizedek was
[1:42:26] because that has repeated in the end
[1:42:28] time day
[1:42:29] because that that means that now the
[1:42:32] word is open
[1:42:33] and i can feed on it and i can believe
[1:42:36] it
[1:42:38] do you know what that means that i get
[1:42:41] to live
[1:42:42] a different set of consequences than the
[1:42:45] ones i created
[1:42:49] because he lives because that ministry
[1:42:53] is back again
[1:42:53] in the earth because the book is open i
[1:42:56] get to live a whole different set of
[1:42:59] consequences

[1:43:18] forward i'm not going to allow the devil
[1:43:19] to hinder me anymore
[1:43:21] i'm entitled because i have believed his
[1:43:24] word
[1:43:27] i'm entitled to a whole new set of
[1:43:28] consequences
[1:43:30] and the devil says you got to pay for
[1:43:32] what you did
[1:43:34] nope but you did it no no
[1:43:38] i didn't do it the other me did it
[1:43:41] not the real me paul said i find there's
[1:43:45] two me's going on here brother branham

[1:43:48] living down inside there
[1:43:49] that actually wasn't the son of charles
[1:43:51] and elle branham and he did all kinds of
[1:43:53] things
[1:43:54] but his life don't count once i'm in
[1:43:56] christ because
[1:43:58] when god looks at my record he don't
[1:44:00] look at that man he looks at christ
[1:44:04] and christ lived perfect so what that
[1:44:06] man did doesn't matter
