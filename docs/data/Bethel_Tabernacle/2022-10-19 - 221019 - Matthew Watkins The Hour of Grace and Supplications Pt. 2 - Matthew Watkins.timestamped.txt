[30:44] Lord Zechariah Chapter 12 we just want
[30:46] to minister to you on part two of the
[30:50] hour of Grace and
[30:52] supplications let's just begin reading
[30:54] here uh in Zechariah let me actually if
[30:56] you have that PowerPoint
[30:58] um brother uh Caleb just have that ready
[31:02] for me if you could I'm not going to get
[31:03] to it right away but uh we will turn
[31:06] there we will uh pull that up here in
[31:08] just a moment um Zechariah Chapter 12
[31:12] the burden of the word of the Lord for
[31:13] Israel saith the Lord which stretcheth
[31:16] forth the
[31:17] heavens and layeth the foundation of the
[31:20] earth and forth the spirit of man within
[31:24] him behold I will make now notice as out
[31:28] the last time that we spoke on this this
[31:30] is not something that Israel was going
[31:33] to do but this is something God says I'm
[31:35] going to do now just while I have you
[31:38] standing let me just bring you up to
[31:40] speed here in Zachariah Zachariah was
[31:43] very much like uh Ezekiel and he was
[31:46] very much like Daniel in Daniel chapter
[31:48] 12 where his prophecy or what he speaks
[31:51] of part of it would be specific to
[31:54] Israel at the era that Zachariah lived
[31:57] but then he would turn to Zechariah 12
[32:00] and he would begin to speak things that
[32:02] we would call apocalyptic or Endtime
[32:05] prophecy Daniel does this in Daniel 12
[32:08] and he begins to speak of symbology and
[32:10] you see some of the same symbols that
[32:12] you find in Revelations Ezekiel does the
[32:14] same thing he sees the will in the
[32:16] middle of a will and so we know that
[32:18] Zachariah is speaking here of a Time
[32:21] time's very important remember don't
[32:24] think of when we say God is timeless it
[32:26] doesn't mean God is outside of
[32:28] time but that all time is inside of God
[32:32] it's very important how you look at that
[32:33] make you make God that he's Timeless and
[32:36] that he doesn't care what happens in
[32:37] time no he actually David said all of my
[32:40] time here on Earth from the first breath
[32:42] to my last is in your
[32:45] hands and so notice here Zachariah is
[32:47] going to begin to speak about something
[32:50] prophetic that would come now we know in
[32:52] Zechariah 12 he's speaking of Armageddon
[32:54] and we know that that's the war of all
[32:56] Wars the end of all things the Day of
[32:58] Reckoning of all humanity and all time
[33:01] now brother Brandon would say it this
[33:03] way that the war of Armageddon was the
[33:06] final battle or the final chapter in the
[33:09] war that started in heaven when Michael
[33:12] prevailed over Lucifer and kicked him
[33:14] out of heaven and he came to Earth and
[33:16] he would say it this way Heavenly
[33:17] battles became Earthly battles and so
[33:21] throughout all time in all history
[33:23] everything from the beginning when Adam
[33:25] and Eve are kicked out of the Garden of
[33:26] Eden all the way through the prophets
[33:28] the Kings the priests all the way to
[33:30] Jesus Beyond Jesus the New Testament
[33:32] Church beyond the New Testament Church
[33:34] all of the ages all the way till
[33:37] 2022 God has been pulling the levers and
[33:42] God has been pushing the buttons not man
[33:44] now man is the god uses men but men come
[33:48] under the anointing of the Potter who is
[33:51] working his
[33:52] vessel behold I will make Jerusalem a
[33:55] couple of trembling unto all people
[33:56] round about when they shall be in Siege
[33:58] both against Judah and against Jerusalem
[34:00] verse three and in that day will I make
[34:02] Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all
[34:05] people all that burden themselves with
[34:07] it shall be cut in pieces though all
[34:10] people of the earth be gathered together
[34:12] against it and that day sayeth the Lord
[34:14] I will Smite let's move on down and I
[34:16] want to say it's verse uh eight let me
[34:18] just pull it up here and that Day verse
[34:21] eight in that day shall the Lord capital
[34:25] L O R D here's Jehovah this is God in
[34:28] that day shall the Lord defend the
[34:32] inhabitants of Jerusalem there is no one
[34:35] that defends his people greater no one
[34:38] who you'd rather have on your side than
[34:40] the Lord and he says I will defend
[34:43] Jerusalem and he that is feeble among
[34:46] them at that day shall be as David so
[34:49] the spirit of David comes back upon
[34:51] these Jews upon this people and he says
[34:54] and the House of David shall be as God
[34:56] as the angel of the Lord from before
[34:58] them verse 9 here's our verse here and
[35:00] it shall come to pass that I will seek
[35:02] to destroy all the nations that come
[35:04] against Jerusalem verse 10 and I will
[35:06] pour upon the House of David notice not
[35:10] to all Israel not to all of the the
[35:12] nation but upon this house and upon the
[35:15] inhabitants of
[35:17] Jerusalem here's what he's going to pour
[35:19] out the spirit of
[35:23] Grace unmar didn't deserve it don't know
[35:26] why I received it but somehow I have
[35:29] Grace and supplications Lord Jesus we
[35:33] just bow our heads here before you now
[35:35] Lord just we come subservient Lord to
[35:38] your spirit for Lord truly we're here
[35:41] Lord only as a tool in your toolbox I
[35:44] pray God that you would use me Lord
[35:46] tonight God by the inspiration of your
[35:48] word you've placed something just a
[35:51] little thought upon my heart I pray
[35:53] father that each and every person that
[35:54] would be here Lord would be sensitive to
[35:57] your spirit that wants to speak to them
[35:59] I pray God I pray you would just keep me
[36:01] from saying anything that would be
[36:03] displeasing to you Lord or something
[36:05] that would be contrary I pray you would
[36:07] just have complete control in this
[36:10] service we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[36:12] amen you can be
[36:15] seated and he says I'll pour out the
[36:18] spirit of Grace and supplication
[36:28] so he says the spirit of Grace I could
[36:31] just stop here and and there's so much
[36:33] I'm not going to get to get to tonight
[36:34] and that's all right Lord will have
[36:35] another time for us I'm sure but he
[36:38] pours out the spirit of Grace now this
[36:41] is what the people need the most this is
[36:43] the stubborn hard-hearted stiff necked
[36:47] people as they were as their history
[36:49] tells us stiff necked and hard-hearted
[36:52] but God is going to give them what they
[36:54] need the most he going to pour out his
[36:57] spirit
[36:58] of Grace unmar favor didn't deserve it
[37:01] don't deserve it but I'm going to pour
[37:03] it out upon you and he says and the
[37:06] spirit of supplications this was such a
[37:08] powerful thing when I read this because
[37:11] if you click up on the Lexicon the
[37:12] meaning of this word desperations it
[37:15] means prayer and that's wonderful it's
[37:17] wonderful that he gives them the spirit
[37:18] of prayer thought it was amazing because
[37:21] here he's going to pour out thank you
[37:23] he's going to pour out the spirit of
[37:25] Grace and prayer
[37:28] and so there's a there's something that
[37:30] comes upon them Zechariah 14 we'll just
[37:33] skip it and not you not take the time to
[37:35] read it because we read it last time and
[37:37] he says behold I'll gather all nations
[37:40] against Jerusalem I'll gather a United
[37:43] Nations Army now there's a bright future
[37:47] coming for Benjamin there's a bright
[37:50] future coming for Israel there's a
[37:52] bright future but before the brightness
[37:55] comes the most horrible day that
[37:59] Humanity has ever experienced amen the
[38:02] Bible says it this way that there's
[38:05] never been a day like it Jesus said this
[38:07] in the Book of Matthew there's never
[38:10] been a day like it and there will never
[38:12] be another day like it again it's called
[38:16] the day of the Lord now you know that
[38:20] you could look at this and say Israel
[38:22] has had many days that you could say
[38:24] were times of great trouble uh they've
[38:27] had many times you could just look at
[38:28] their history and the but the Bible says
[38:31] that there's never been there's there's
[38:33] such as a day as never was before even
[38:36] to that time so the Jew the Jewish
[38:38] people have known many days of trouble
[38:41] they've known many times of trouble this
[38:44] is what the Bible refers to as Jacob's
[38:46] trouble they've known many times of
[38:48] trouble you could just look historically
[38:50] here and know that it's a people who've
[38:52] been troubled from the very beginning of
[38:54] their history when Adam uh curses the
[38:57] entire human race and they go out from
[39:00] the Garden of Eden and they and they and
[39:02] they sojourn into the world there's been
[39:04] nothing but sorrow as was prophesied and
[39:07] was promised there's been Horrors that
[39:09] have fallen upon this people from the
[39:12] fall of Samaria all the way to the
[39:13] tearing of the kingdoms between the
[39:15] North and the South to the you go read
[39:17] the book of mccabes it's amazing history
[39:20] of a man named Antiochus epiphanies and
[39:23] just was a tyrant almost like Hitler and
[39:26] some of the things and it was Jude the
[39:27] house of Judah Benjamin Judah Who Rose
[39:30] up the the war of the macbes uh that
[39:33] that that that fought against this man
[39:34] and his army you can read all the way
[39:36] through the destruction of Jerusalem by
[39:39] the Romans also we read about it in the
[39:41] Bible by Nebuchadnezzar when he takes
[39:43] them into captivity into Babylon uh the
[39:46] persecution throughout the church uh
[39:48] through through the church through the
[39:50] through the Dark Ages excuse me uh to
[39:52] the 20th century just here not long ago
[39:55] the Holocaust yeah amen and so it's just
[39:58] been trouble after trouble after trouble
[40:01] after trouble but yet the Bible says
[40:04] this will be
[40:06] worse than any of those troubles this is
[40:10] a day that'll be worse than all of those
[40:12] combined there's never been a day like
[40:14] it there'll never be another day like it
[40:16] let me say this that when the day of the
[40:19] Lord comes you better be on the Lord's
[40:22] Side when the day of battle comes you
[40:24] better be on the right side of the army
[40:26] cuz you're not facing a General you're
[40:27] not facing Putin you're not facing a
[40:29] nuclear bomb you're facing god Jehovah
[40:33] the creator of the heavens and the Earth
[40:35] and so this will be a worse time than
[40:37] any other time and he says I'll gather
[40:40] all nations in Zechariah 14 against
[40:42] Jerusalem to battle and he says and the
[40:45] the houses will be rifled and he speaks
[40:47] of just in in detail of of just some
[40:51] Horrors that'll befall that nation and
[40:54] that city as all the nations of G
[40:57] Gentile armies all the nations a United
[41:00] Nations Army has unified and solidified
[41:03] against this nation now what's amazing
[41:07] is that they don't know it but God is
[41:10] the one who said I'll gather all
[41:14] nations so will it'll be it'll be oh
[41:16] it's just the agenda of this Republican
[41:18] or this Democrat or it's Putin or it's
[41:20] over here don't you realize these are
[41:22] just puppets in the hands of God who's
[41:25] controlling all time by a book of
[41:27] prophecy this isn't a newspaper or just
[41:29] a good book or a novel this is
[41:32] controlling his
[41:35] story this isn't H it's not history it
[41:37] teach you history in school do you
[41:39] realize history is just his story it's
[41:42] the drama that's
[41:44] unfolding and you're part of it and I'm
[41:47] part of it and I want to say Lord what's
[41:49] my purpose in all of it so he's
[41:52] controlling all things he brings all
[41:54] these nations against Israel and God
[41:56] says in Zechariah chapter 14 because I'm
[41:59] going to bring all those Nations and I
[42:02] thought it's incredible here's one spot
[42:03] brings them to one stage at one
[42:06] geographic location so that his Cup of
[42:09] Wrath can be poured out upon all those
[42:12] Nations because at the day when it seems
[42:15] like all hope is lost the Bible says the
[42:18] Lord steps in the
[42:20] battle and when the Lord comes to your
[42:23] Aid I wouldn't rather have any you
[42:25] wouldn't want anybody to can fight for
[42:27] you than to say Lord fight my battles
[42:30] I'll stand behind Lord and I'll keep
[42:32] just praising you and worshiping you as
[42:34] you go Mighty in battle in my life am
[42:38] and so we we know this that here from
[42:40] history even from time all the way from
[42:42] the beginning time was going to be a
[42:44] very important thing to God we know that
[42:47] Israel is his time piece you want to
[42:49] know where you're at where God is at in
[42:51] the Gentile dispensation the grace age
[42:54] which we're still under right now but
[42:56] there's coming a day where the Bible
[42:57] says when the fullness of the Gentiles
[42:59] comes and when Grace is over I'm glad
[43:02] it's not right now there's still mercy
[43:04] here at on The Mercy Seat and so but we
[43:07] know that that there will come a time
[43:09] when that gospel goes back to that
[43:11] Nation when he that is filthy will be
[43:14] filthy when he that is Holy will be holy
[43:16] when he that lth will let till he be
[43:18] taken out of the way we know all of the
[43:20] the prophecies that speak of a Time
[43:22] friends let me just say it this way I
[43:24] believe we're approaching those moments
[43:27] right
[43:28] now it's not just an accident time it's
[43:31] not just a clock that someone's wound up
[43:33] and it's just spinning and it'll stop at
[43:35] any given random moment no but God has a
[43:38] specific time and a specific day and a
[43:41] specific
[43:43] moment when God says the
[43:48] end and John said it this way in the
[43:50] Book of Revelations time shall be no
[43:53] more amen and so you say what happens at
[43:57] that moment then whatever you are he
[43:59] that is filthy let him be filthy he that
[44:01] is Holy let him be holy that's why the
[44:03] Bible says make your calling an election
[44:07] sure because the only thing you take
[44:09] with you when you leave this world is
[44:12] the character that God has molded in you
[44:14] and it better be I say Lord let it be a
[44:16] reflection of Jesus Christ let my life
[44:19] be a a a conduit it for the reflection
[44:22] of
[44:23] Christ and so notice here if you have
[44:26] that second power point the God of all
[44:28] time brother the Caleb the one you could
[44:29] put up notice here just for a moment as
[44:31] we look at this as we know this thing
[44:34] that we we would call time and I I don't
[44:37] have really the time speaking of time to
[44:40] really cover this how I want to but
[44:42] we'll just get to what we can and then
[44:44] we'll leave the rest as to the Lord and
[44:47] so notice here I if you look at this we
[44:50] we ministered on this years ago here at
[44:51] the church I'm just going to cover some
[44:53] principles that we covered then but we
[44:55] notice here it would we be what they
[44:57] would call academically as the
[44:59] philosophy of History anybody writing a
[45:01] book or or who's who's studying or
[45:04] historian they're going to have a
[45:06] certain philosophy it just means how
[45:08] they View events in the past in the
[45:11] present and events coming how they view
[45:14] how do you view this linear line that we
[45:18] call time and we understand everything
[45:20] about it not just the time of yesterday
[45:23] but we understand our own life as time I
[45:25] was young I was a teen I grew up and now
[45:28] you look always in the past and then
[45:30] you're planning your future then you're
[45:31] here you are in your present so you
[45:33] judge everything and you measure
[45:34] everything by time that's how God made
[45:37] us we're creatures of time and so we're
[45:40] subject to that and so none of us are
[45:43] getting any younger amen right none of
[45:47] us are getting any and you know all of
[45:49] us are we're not we're you know you can
[45:51] do things to improve yourself and to
[45:52] improve your health and that's wonderful
[45:54] the Bible says bodily exercise profiteth
[45:58] hold on I didn't say to say that the
[46:01] bodily exercise profiteth don't miss it
[46:04] it does
[46:05] profit it might be little I is it
[46:08] amazing how everyone just love to waake
[46:10] up
[46:12] little you beat me to the
[46:15] punchline body bodily exercise profited
[46:18] little So you you're you're always
[46:20] breaking down you're on a constant cycle
[46:23] of breaking
[46:25] down even even even even in your own
[46:27] body here today your body's always dying
[46:29] all the time or always moving one one
[46:32] step closer to the Grave our time is
[46:34] going to run out one day oh but it's
[46:37] only a a contrast of a negative to a
[46:40] positive if there's a world that has
[46:43] death and there must be a world that has
[46:45] life if there's a place where people get
[46:47] old there must be a place where people
[46:49] are young if there's a place where
[46:51] there's sickness there must be it's law
[46:53] of contrast a place where there's no
[46:56] aging and no no sorrow and no
[46:59] sickness I love how the Apostle Paul
[47:01] said if in this life only I had hope I
[47:05] would be of all men most miserable if
[47:09] only this life was and you take all of
[47:13] the best moments of life and you can
[47:16] have some good ones you can have some
[47:18] photographs and show some of the best
[47:20] moments of your life and there's High
[47:21] Times I'm thankful for God giving us
[47:24] times of vacation and Times of joy we
[47:27] enjoy our our time with our little ones
[47:29] and our children as we watch them grow
[47:31] we we we we enjoy each other's company
[47:33] each other's Fellowship you could go and
[47:35] travel the world and see some beautiful
[47:37] magnificent places and your life could
[47:40] be filled I believe God gives you times
[47:42] of goodness in your life even on this
[47:45] side of
[47:46] Eternity now without Christ they all
[47:49] mean
[47:50] nothing without Christ it's all
[47:52] meaningless and
[47:53] hopeless but you can even have good
[47:56] times you can have great times but let
[47:57] me just say this you could you could
[47:59] pile all of them together and and and
[48:02] and if life's meaning was just this life
[48:05] only could you
[48:08] imagine could you imagine after you You'
[48:11] have loved ones who you love and you
[48:12] watch them go and you take them to the
[48:15] to and you you visit them at the
[48:17] graveyard and at the cemetery and that's
[48:19] could you imagine if this was it if this
[48:21] was all right
[48:23] amen one man said it and it's it's
[48:26] always stuck with he said life would
[48:27] just seem like a sick joke that someone
[48:30] played on
[48:31] me you know I can relate with that and
[48:34] say as you get older you start to
[48:36] realize there's sorrow that comes with
[48:37] life there's hard times that come with
[48:39] life and if all if all I had was just
[48:42] this life oh it just makes me stop and
[48:44] say I'm so thankful for a reality of an
[48:48] eternity I'm so thankful for a reality
[48:50] that this life is not the end of it all
[48:54] oh this life is not where it all stops
[48:56] when you breathe your Last Breath it's
[48:57] where it all
[49:00] begins and I've tasted of that how do
[49:03] you know it's real because I've tasted
[49:05] of a little piece a little portion of it
[49:07] here it's why the Bible calls grieve not
[49:10] the Holy Spirit where whereby you're
[49:11] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[49:13] what is the Holy Ghost it's the earnest
[49:15] means the down
[49:16] payment so I've received the down
[49:19] payment and God's going to pay the rest
[49:21] of the bill one
[49:23] day notice this here and and so you have
[49:26] have all of the philosophy that you
[49:28] could look at time means how do you look
[49:30] at time how do you look at this linear
[49:33] line of time and men have different
[49:36] views on this and it's very important
[49:38] with what with what lens they view time
[49:41] and the pattern of events that happen
[49:43] not only in our lifetime but lifetimes
[49:45] gone by that we read about and study
[49:47] about and so when you when you when you
[49:50] when you look at this here the the the
[49:53] the if you go to the next slide I don't
[49:55] know if I have I do good pray the Lord
[49:57] I'll I'll go ahead and Advance it here
[49:59] if I have it good thank you these are
[50:00] way too small to read I'll read some of
[50:02] them for you but these are the different
[50:05] the these are the different views we
[50:07] could call it that of of History you
[50:10] have this what they call the cyclic View
[50:13] and it just means that history's just a
[50:16] big cycle it's just like a big
[50:18] roundabout it's just going around and
[50:19] around and around it's really going
[50:21] nowhere there's no pattern there's no
[50:24] purpose it's just time is just this big
[50:27] clock that man has you know wound up and
[50:29] it's just unwinding and unwinding and
[50:31] and one day whenever that stops winding
[50:34] it's just going it just and history just
[50:36] keeps repeating and it does there's
[50:38] truths to all of these history just
[50:40] repeats itself over and there's
[50:42] yesterday we had good news and then
[50:44] tomorrow had bad news and my grandpa had
[50:46] good news and then he had bad his
[50:47] grandpa had good news then bad news his
[50:49] grandpa before him had it's just one big
[50:52] I'm just here and this is just my part
[50:53] and we're just going in a circle you
[50:55] know just like a roundabout just a a big
[50:56] old roundabout you know like like we you
[50:58] see around here you just sort of get on
[51:01] the roundabout you know when you come
[51:03] into life and and then you get a career
[51:05] and you go to college and you find your
[51:07] vocation in life and then you pursue
[51:09] that then you get a family and you have
[51:11] children and then you just you just go
[51:13] through this cycle of life where you
[51:14] wake up every morning you tell your
[51:16] family goodbye you go to work that day
[51:19] you spend the day at work you come home
[51:20] you greet your family greet your kids
[51:22] veg on entertainment go to bed wake up
[51:25] the next day go back to the job work
[51:27] full eight eight hours a day come home
[51:29] greet the family see see the children
[51:31] vegal entertainment go back to bed wake
[51:34] up the next day go back to work work
[51:36] eight hours a day spend the day get home
[51:39] greet the kids veg on entertainment then
[51:40] you go to bed then you wake up oh
[51:45] my and you just get on this long
[51:47] roundabout with really no direction and
[51:49] I'm just living life I'm just aimless
[51:51] and and then really The Man Without God
[51:53] this is really his life it's just a a
[51:55] big circle just a big old roundabout you
[51:58] know the point of that roundabout is to
[52:01] get off of the
[52:02] roundabout you don't go on a traffic
[52:04] circle and just go around and around and
[52:06] around and around and around if you do
[52:08] people think he is not from
[52:12] here that's a northerner excuse
[52:17] me he's not from here why they just go
[52:20] around and around in people's lives so
[52:21] this way they just go around and around
[52:24] and it's one up day uh day one one day
[52:26] is up and one day's down and one day's
[52:28] up and one day is down and they just go
[52:30] they just get off they get on the
[52:32] roundabout and they get off about where
[52:33] they got on they retire then they they
[52:35] just fade off you know this is I thought
[52:37] about this today and I know preaching
[52:40] another sermon here but I was thinking
[52:41] about this just this afternoon I thought
[52:43] it's just like the Book of Judges where
[52:45] the Bible says in judges they had a
[52:47] judge and the people serve God as long
[52:50] as the judge was alive then when the
[52:51] judge would die they'd go back into sin
[52:53] they'd get into slavery they'd get into
[52:55] bondage God would send them Deborah he'd
[52:57] send them Samson and oil all these
[52:59] judges all these men then they would
[53:01] serve God and they would come to Revival
[53:03] and then they would right when that
[53:04] judge would die right when Grandpa's
[53:06] dead and and Grandma's dead and that
[53:08] that anchor that was in their
[53:11] life then they fall right back into sin
[53:13] go into slavery into bondage then God
[53:15] sends another judge and it's just this
[53:17] repeated circle of Circle of up and up
[53:20] and down but you know what's so powerful
[53:21] about that Circle in judges is that
[53:24] judges in the Book of Ruth were
[53:26] originally bound together in the Jewish
[53:29] Bible today judges and Ruth is one book
[53:32] because why what was going to be
[53:33] different about Judges Ruth was not
[53:35] going to be a circle Ruth was going to
[53:38] be a
[53:39] line it was going to be a progression it
[53:42] was going to lead to a Royal Line it
[53:45] wasn't about circles and going up and
[53:47] going down and going up and going down
[53:50] but it was going to be about a destiny a
[53:52] purpose a calling a plan that God had
[53:56] planned for this little woman and she
[53:58] had a future and it wasn't a future of
[54:00] Judges circles but it was a future to go
[54:03] on a Royal Line and bring forth the
[54:06] promise of God in her life do you
[54:08] realize friends we've not been called to
[54:10] the circle of the rest of the world of
[54:12] the grind but you're part of a Plan of
[54:14] Redemption amen and you've got to
[54:17] recognize I'm part of the story that's
[54:19] unfolding here amen it just repeats and
[54:23] goes around and around and then you have
[54:25] the Epic View
[54:27] and it goes forward but it goes forward
[54:30] in ups and downs and you hope your life
[54:32] ends on and up and not a down you go up
[54:36] and then you go down and good times and
[54:38] there's bad times there's rich people
[54:39] and there's poor people there's
[54:41] inflation and then there's deflation
[54:43] that's how they view history and this
[54:45] this epic view then you have the the
[54:47] optimistic view now this is incredible
[54:50] because this optic M view of history
[54:52] says history is getting better and
[54:55] better all all the time we're
[54:58] progressing it's Progressive it's just
[54:59] going better things are going to get
[55:01] better this optimistic view life is
[55:03] we're we're we're increasing this it's
[55:05] almost like a the the the the you know
[55:07] this is heaven on
[55:09] Earth and some people This Is How They
[55:11] view life it's just get better it's all
[55:13] about here and just make my life better
[55:15] let because we're getting better science
[55:17] has advanced I'm thankful science has
[55:19] I'm thankful for modern medicine amen
[55:22] but that view that that is just going
[55:24] it's going to get better and life is is
[55:26] getting better all the time this was the
[55:28] most common view held at in the
[55:31] 1900s it's the most common view that
[55:34] some it all up in this one word
[55:37] progress life is just going to get
[55:39] better time is just going to go get
[55:41] better you know history uh uh science is
[55:45] going to keep discovering this was the
[55:56] isn't about Earth is not about a curse
[55:58] Earth is about a blessing life on and
[56:01] Earth is in humanity is all about it's
[56:03] it's uh what what can we have here now
[56:05] not what we invest for tomorrow but
[56:08] Jesus says where your treasure
[56:11] is there your heart will be
[56:15] also so if you treasure this life and
[56:18] this is where your Treasures are this is
[56:20] where your heart will be also
[56:23] right and so this was the this was
[56:25] thought that the 20th century was going
[56:28] to be the best Century it was going to
[56:31] be the best age ever with all the modern
[56:36] discoveries it's going to help us
[56:38] discover and and and and fix all of our
[56:40] problems life is going to be good it was
[56:43] just going to get better and better
[56:44] man's evolving education in evolving
[56:47] education and Science and Technology and
[56:50] boy do we have it ever than we ever have
[56:53] we've had it more than we now than we
[56:54] ever have before yeah right and science
[56:57] is just going to get better and they
[56:59] entered the 20th century with this High
[57:02] Hope a British prime minister heard a
[57:04] man speaking this the other day he went
[57:05] he won an entire election on that slogan
[57:08] up and up and up and on and on and on up
[57:10] and up and up and on and on and on
[57:14] progress and then they built a boat
[57:17] called the
[57:19] Titanic and they said we're going to
[57:21] build a boat our technology is so
[57:24] powerful this age is so one just such
[57:27] optimism that not even God himself can
[57:32] sink
[57:33] it this was the largest manmade moving
[57:38] object ever
[57:40] built and inside of this largest ever
[57:44] built object was
[57:48] in identified I thought this is
[57:51] incredible all of the latest cuttingedge
[57:55] technology at that time were all housed
[57:58] in this
[57:59] boat this was man's greatest
[58:03] achievements it was the symbol of
[58:06] optimism it was the symbol of hope it
[58:09] was the symbol of progress and man said
[58:13] it's so powerful and so good we've
[58:15] created such an invention that not even
[58:19] God himself can sink it so you know what
[58:21] God
[58:24] did yeah yep he sunk
[58:28] it and with the Titanic going to the
[58:31] bottom of the ocean still today the
[58:34] Titanic the most popular shipwreck in
[58:36] history with the Titanic going to the
[58:38] bottom of the ocean the all of that B
[58:43] all of that progress and all of that
[58:46] High Hope was like a bubble that you
[58:51] popped and this was the first major
[58:54] disaster of the 20th century
[58:56] and what what did it do and now it's a
[58:58] challenge to man and you know you say
[59:01] brother the mat then what followed that
[59:03] World War
[59:05] I and now the entire world goes to war
[59:09] this was supposed to be the best of the
[59:12] best it was supposed to be the greatest
[59:14] of the greatest man is going up and
[59:15] Darwin said we're evolving we're getting
[59:17] better science and social and and and
[59:20] our culture would just we'll get Kinder
[59:23] we'll get nicer we'll get happier we'll
[59:25] get more joy more money means more joy
[59:27] but what did what did it produce
[59:29] addictions and drugs and alcohol and
[59:32] depression and anxiety what is
[59:34] technology really brought the world Amen
[59:38] he's gone completely insane
[59:42] yes and what was thought to be as the
[59:45] greatest turned out to be the worst yeah
[59:48] amen it turned out to be the worst all
[59:51] the optimistic view of History uh turned
[59:54] out to be the worst so then what did you
[59:56] you have you have the pessimistic I
[59:58] think I had on the ne the next slide
[59:59] there the pessimistic I don't like
[1:00:02] pessimism I'm not a pessimistic person I
[1:00:04] don't believe Christians should be
[1:00:06] pessimistic people we're called to be
[1:00:09] optim optimistic
[1:00:12] people that's not just a car a
[1:00:14] personality trait a Christian always
[1:00:16] sees the glass half full not half
[1:00:20] empty but this was the pessimistic view
[1:00:22] of history that it's not getting better
[1:00:25] it's getting worse worse and worse and
[1:00:27] worse and and destruction is unavoidable
[1:00:30] and there's global warming and the
[1:00:32] melting of the polar caps and it's all
[1:00:33] going to go towards doom and destruction
[1:00:35] and the whole world's going to end
[1:00:37] they're
[1:00:39] right
[1:00:40] am so what do you have you have the
[1:00:43] optimistic view who look towards
[1:00:44] something man always has a good desire
[1:00:47] but the Devil comes in and perverts it
[1:00:49] and then you have the pessimistic view
[1:00:51] you can represent these uh you could you
[1:00:54] could you could represent these even by
[1:00:55] L here you have the cycle then you have
[1:00:57] the Epic view uh that that goes like
[1:01:00] that then you have the optimistic view
[1:01:02] where time and history is getting better
[1:01:04] and better and better and then you came
[1:01:06] with the pessimistic view to where
[1:01:08] everything's getting worse and we're not
[1:01:10] getting better we're going worse and
[1:01:11] worse and history is getting worse and
[1:01:13] times and people are getting more evil
[1:01:15] and they're right they are time man is
[1:01:17] slowly destroying himself if you haven't
[1:01:21] read the news lately and I'm not
[1:01:22] recommending that you do man's getting
[1:01:25] worse wor time's getting worse history
[1:01:28] is getting worse man is going completely
[1:01:30] insane the only sanity is in Christ the
[1:01:34] only peace is not in money or women or
[1:01:37] popularity or Hollywood or education or
[1:01:40] or whatever they want drugs they want to
[1:01:42] give people the only opium that I need
[1:01:45] as a man is this opium right here this
[1:01:48] is all of my joy is David said this is
[1:01:51] my
[1:01:52] portion this is my daily bread all of my
[1:01:55] happiness comes from this word that's
[1:01:57] right and so pessimism what is it it's
[1:02:00] getting worse and it's getting worse and
[1:02:02] they're right but let me tell you we
[1:02:03] don't believe in an optimistic or a
[1:02:05] pessimistic view you say what view do
[1:02:07] you view time with I have the God
[1:02:09] view I have the view where things will
[1:02:12] get worse and worse and worse but
[1:02:15] suddenly at the bottom of it all when it
[1:02:18] goes completely insane suddenly after it
[1:02:21] gets all the way to the bottom out of
[1:02:23] nowhere there's a Rapture of the
[1:02:27] church this is what the Bible calls the
[1:02:30] harpazo which is just a word to mean we
[1:02:33] shall be called up which means to be
[1:02:35] snatched it means to be snatched I say
[1:02:38] Lord snatch me I'm ready right now God
[1:02:41] get me out of all of it Lord this is my
[1:02:44] hope I'm looking
[1:02:46] for this is how I'm viewing time and my
[1:02:49] life and all of it is that God has a
[1:02:52] plan and he's working all things after
[1:02:55] his his
[1:02:58] purposes amen and he's got a purpose you
[1:03:02] believe that he's got a a
[1:03:04] purpose a purpose and I'm in the middle
[1:03:07] of all of that you know when I let me
[1:03:09] just say this and stop for a moment and
[1:03:10] say when I read the word of God I'm glad
[1:03:13] I can read the history I can read what
[1:03:15] what God did in Israel I could read what
[1:03:17] God did in the in the gospels I could
[1:03:19] read what God did in the New Testament
[1:03:20] Church but when I read the Bible I'm not
[1:03:23] just reading it as history I'm read that
[1:03:26] it's his story and in his story I want
[1:03:29] to say God where am I where's my purpose
[1:03:32] Lord what have you called me to Lord
[1:03:36] it's one thing to recognize God in
[1:03:38] yesterday or God in tomorrow but where's
[1:03:40] he at right now come on Church do we
[1:03:43] believe he's the same yesterday today
[1:03:47] and forever am he he said I'll have a
[1:03:51] church that has no spotter no wrinkle or
[1:03:53] blemish or any such thing
[1:03:56] and Revelations the the lady ofan church
[1:03:58] he said to him that
[1:04:01] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:04:03] on my Throne what does that tell me that
[1:04:05] in this age of Darkness there's going to
[1:04:08] be somebody who overcomes the devil the
[1:04:12] Bible says they overcame him by the
[1:04:14] blood of the lamb and the word of their
[1:04:16] testimony what is a testimony it's a
[1:04:20] test I think it was brother Donnie or
[1:04:22] maybe it wasn't said what is breakdown
[1:04:24] testimony test I
[1:04:28] moany God gives me a testing I'm
[1:04:31] moany we moan over it but it's it's for
[1:04:34] our good it's for our Perfection God
[1:04:36] sends it in our life to produce
[1:04:39] desperation in our hearts do you realize
[1:04:42] that this is why God sends trouble to
[1:04:47] the
[1:04:48] believer it's not to produce bitterness
[1:04:51] it's not to produce anger towards God
[1:04:55] it's just the Bible says he never laid
[1:04:57] charge on God he never blamed God and
[1:04:59] through all of
[1:05:02] it but T but but but pressure comes God
[1:05:08] sends and allows pressure in your life
[1:05:12] and God could bring that pressure
[1:05:13] through manifold Temptation manifold
[1:05:16] trial manifold uh storms that would just
[1:05:19] mean it would be various it'd be
[1:05:20] something different for everybody let me
[1:05:22] tell you something here tonight if you
[1:05:24] feel like that you're in the greatest
[1:05:26] battle you've ever fought let me just
[1:05:27] tell you I am too brother if you feel
[1:05:30] like you're under some of the greatest
[1:05:31] pressure you've ever been let can
[1:05:33] somebody else witness and say you're not
[1:05:35] alone in that if you feel like that all
[1:05:38] hell is against you let me just tell you
[1:05:40] if the devil told you he's only against
[1:05:42] you that's a lie he's against all of us
[1:05:45] if you feel like you're in the greatest
[1:05:47] time and the some of facing some of the
[1:05:49] darkest times of your life let me just
[1:05:51] tell you he's attacking on all sides
[1:05:54] just as all Nation surrounded Israel all
[1:05:57] the faculty and and Kingdom of Satan has
[1:06:01] been raging against you because you're a
[1:06:03] believer of the word of God but just as
[1:06:05] he pours out a spirit of Grace and
[1:06:07] supplication on them he's pouring it out
[1:06:10] upon us and I just raise my hand and say
[1:06:13] Lord let me receive your spirit of Grace
[1:06:16] cuz I need it more than anything else
[1:06:19] and if you've got to Pro give me trials
[1:06:21] to produce desperation
[1:06:26] that's that's I didn't I didn't say that
[1:06:28] I thought it was incredible when I
[1:06:30] looked up that word he pours out I'll
[1:06:32] pour out upon the House of David the
[1:06:34] spirit of Grace and supplications and I
[1:06:37] clicked a little deeper in the Lexicon
[1:06:40] and it gave me the definition not just
[1:06:42] prayer but desperate
[1:06:45] prayer and I thought out of more than
[1:06:47] anything else listen you cannot I'm
[1:06:50] going to close you cannot manufacture
[1:06:57] desperation you can't you can't with all
[1:07:00] of your all of your willpower no matter
[1:07:04] how you say I just I'm so desperate
[1:07:05] listen you that's not something you can
[1:07:07] choose you know what that is that's a
[1:07:09] result that's a fruit of of of like the
[1:07:12] olive you know how you get the olive oil
[1:07:14] because you crush the olive yeah and
[1:07:17] then you get the olive
[1:07:19] oil this is what Jesus was in Gethsemane
[1:07:22] that's what Gethsemane means it's the
[1:07:24] crushing yeah man it got quiet awfully
[1:07:29] fast it's the
[1:07:31] crushing it's the it's the
[1:07:34] pressure and it's the
[1:07:36] breaking and so Gethsemane was a it was
[1:07:39] a crushing I thought about this today
[1:07:41] you you can't you can't produce it you
[1:07:43] need it more than anything else you need
[1:07:48] desperation sister Brenda Lewis wrote a
[1:07:51] song maybe some of you have never heard
[1:07:53] it called lord make me Des desate lest I
[1:07:58] perish make me to hunger and
[1:08:02] thirst for
[1:08:03] you amen you can't hunger and thirst for
[1:08:07] him hunger is not something that you
[1:08:09] manufacture it's something that you just
[1:08:11] have and I say Lord make me to hunger
[1:08:15] and thirst if I've became so distracted
[1:08:18] by this world and the cares of this life
[1:08:20] that I've got my attention and my focus
[1:08:21] off of your story then Lord make me to
[1:08:24] hunger how many could pray that here
[1:08:26] with me and say Lord Make Me
[1:08:31] desperate make me desperate Lord no
[1:08:33] matter what you got to send me through
[1:08:35] this is the hour of Grace and
[1:08:37] supplications and God is producing
[1:08:40] pressure oh I I I just want to I feel
[1:08:43] like that's so from the Holy Spirit
[1:08:45] right now that pressure you feel in your
[1:08:47] life that might be you say who is that
[1:08:49] come who is that the Lord may allow the
[1:08:51] devil as he as he allowed the devil to
[1:08:53] afflict job but let me tell you
[1:08:55] something the devil couldn't touch job
[1:08:58] unless God gave him permission and the
[1:09:00] devil can't touch you you're a son and
[1:09:02] daughter of God Satan came and said you
[1:09:04] got job hedged up I can't even get to
[1:09:07] him the devil let us in on a secret that
[1:09:09] for the Sons and Daughters of God he has
[1:09:11] you hedged up it's why the Bible says
[1:09:14] the angels of the Lord encamp those that
[1:09:16] fear Him you may not see them you may
[1:09:18] not feel them you may not hear them take
[1:09:20] confidence tonight there's Angels
[1:09:22] surrounding your home there's Angels
[1:09:24] surrounding your life there's angels
[1:09:26] that are watching your children when you
[1:09:28] let them out of your when you when you
[1:09:29] send them to school or you send them to
[1:09:31] work there's an Angelic presence that
[1:09:34] covers God's
[1:09:36] family amen and he can't touch you
[1:09:40] unless God gives him permission
[1:09:45] first and so what does God do to produce
[1:09:48] desperation he brings you through
[1:09:51] pressure yes amen amen and he brings you
[1:09:54] through some some some some some moments
[1:09:57] in your life to where it looks like that
[1:09:59] God has just gone and you say why did
[1:10:01] this happen to me and how could this
[1:10:03] befall me and what did I do the first
[1:10:06] that question you Lord what have I done
[1:10:08] you start to turn over every stone and
[1:10:10] law and you begin to where did I go
[1:10:11] wrong and where did I go off course and
[1:10:13] I look at my life and and God doesn't
[1:10:15] answer my prayer anymore and I just feel
[1:10:17] so far and I feel like the I I I used to
[1:10:19] talk to him and I used to sense his
[1:10:21] presence and now it must have been
[1:10:22] something I've done I'm sure I missed a
[1:10:24] turn I'm sure I went all that's exactly
[1:10:26] what the devil wants to lie to you and
[1:10:27] get you to accept what is it it's God
[1:10:30] producing pressure in your life so that
[1:10:32] it'll produce desperation to say Lord I
[1:10:36] don't want to miss you I want to be
[1:10:37] ready Lord I want to be fervent I want
[1:10:40] to be that that virgin in the Bible the
[1:10:42] wise virgin who was burning the midnight
[1:10:46] oil amen and she was trimming her
[1:10:50] lamp Prophet said that I had to quote
[1:10:52] this is lamp trimming time
[1:10:56] this is lamp trimming time and I say
[1:10:59] Lord let me trim my lamp let me make
[1:11:02] sure I've got the oil of the Holy
[1:11:04] Ghost I don't want to be like that
[1:11:06] foolish virgin who the Bible says when
[1:11:08] the master came that they didn't have no
[1:11:10] oil in their vessel amen they go to the
[1:11:13] city and buy can we have some we don't
[1:11:15] have enough to spare only enough for
[1:11:17] oursel amen then what do do go to the
[1:11:19] city the Bible says when the bride when
[1:11:21] the groom came and they came backwards
[1:11:23] yeah he was already gone oh friend let
[1:11:25] me to say don't be called unaware that's
[1:11:27] not your destiny that's not your purpose
[1:11:30] there's others who will fulfill that but
[1:11:32] you're not called to fulfill that you're
[1:11:34] not the licorn believer of Lady OA
[1:11:36] you're the Overcomer of this age you're
[1:11:39] not those who are laxad desico and all
[1:11:41] you want is a feel-good sermon and a
[1:11:43] good feel-good comfort zone Vibes but we
[1:11:45] want to say Lord give us your word alive
[1:11:48] and living let it be something that
[1:11:50] feeds us Lord and is real in our life oh
[1:11:54] that's why God has given you the faith
[1:11:55] for the supernatural why it's part of
[1:11:57] your
[1:11:59] inheritance We Believe for that we look
[1:12:02] for that not just a god of yesterday but
[1:12:05] a god of today who's alive
[1:12:08] amen who speaks and we hear Hallelujah
[1:12:13] who speaks and we hear that still Small
[1:12:16] Voice not always in a big booming loud
[1:12:19] as Elijah went through the earthquake
[1:12:21] and through the fire and and and and and
[1:12:23] through the wind but but the Bible says
[1:12:25] God wasn't in any of that he was in that
[1:12:27] still Small Voice I say Lord let me be
[1:12:32] sensitive enough to hear that
[1:12:36] voice because when he speaks oh it's not
[1:12:40] the voice of a man speaking it's not the
[1:12:43] voice of a man that can fail but when he
[1:12:45] speaks he dissolves all doubts oh
[1:12:49] friends can you can you witness that
[1:12:50] here tonight you might have searched for
[1:12:52] answers and you might have got good
[1:12:54] advice from this man or this woman or
[1:12:55] this brother sister but really when God
[1:12:59] speaks amen it answers all questions it
[1:13:03] removes all doubt and you realize your
[1:13:06] purpose and your calling and you say
[1:13:09] Lord what do you have me to do I want to
[1:13:11] be ready I want to be a servant that can
[1:13:12] be yielded and ready
[1:13:15] Lord I want to be ready Lord when your
[1:13:18] spirit gives me unction don't let me be
[1:13:20] so distracted that I miss it Lord let me
[1:13:24] be sensitive to that
[1:13:27] voice Grant it
[1:13:30] Lord the hour of
[1:13:34] Grace and
[1:13:36] supplications let's all stand to our
[1:13:38] feet this

[1:13:58] alive that he's the same yesterday today
[1:14:01] and
[1:14:02] forever why don't we just bow our heads

[1:14:29] sayeth the Lord It's not him who runneth
[1:14:31] or him that willth but God that showeth
[1:14:33] Mercy Lord all of these scriptures that
[1:14:35] we could quote here tonight Lord they
[1:14:37] prove one thing lord it's not up to us
[1:14:40] to manufacture it's not us up to us to
[1:14:43] whoop up or to build up or to try our
[1:14:45] best or determine in ourselves it's just
[1:14:48] up to us to yield and to surrender and
[1:14:51] to become
[1:14:53] subservient and humble ourselves enough
[1:14:56] to become subservient Lord and
[1:14:59] submissive to whatever your word says I
[1:15:01] just raise my hand and say Lord I accept
[1:15:03] it here tonight I yield all my thoughts
[1:15:06] I yield all of my opinions I check them

[1:15:11] know nothing except Jesus Christ and him
[1:15:14] crucified let me know nothing Lord let
[1:15:17] my life be made up of not my agenda or

[1:15:45] trials and the tribulations that you
[1:15:47] pour out upon us father Lord help us to
[1:15:49] not let them become and make us bitter
[1:15:51] or make us angry Lord but if let it do
[1:15:54] what it's a purpose is to do and that's
[1:15:56] to produce desperation in our life that
[1:15:59] we could say Lord draw us closer to you
[1:16:01] than we've ever been before draw Our
[1:16:03] Lives closer to match your word more
[1:16:06] than it's ever been before Lord Jesus we

[1:16:56] know when it might be your last
[1:16:59] time and we are faithful to the calling
[1:17:02] if you're not faithful to the calling
[1:17:04] you're missing out on the
[1:17:05] blessing God has given us as I heard
[1:17:09] pastors say a
[1:17:11] testimony and that testimony doesn't
[1:17:14] come without a test and I don't know who
[1:17:16] I'm talking to and God I I prayed and I
[1:17:19] said Okay God even on the way over here
[1:17:22] give us the right words to say I don't
[1:17:25] want to go up there and speak for me I
[1:17:27] want to speak for you and let everything
[1:17:29] that I say tonight bring you
[1:17:33] glory and I understand now better than I
[1:17:37] ever have in all my life I'm a man of 68
[1:17:42] years years ago I I I had a heart's
[1:17:45] yearning and desire to go on the
[1:17:47] missions field and God has allowed my
[1:17:51] wife Mary and I to smuggle Bibles into
[1:17:54] China
[1:17:56] wow I made history in the pastor's
[1:17:59] Church in the Philippines he announced
[1:18:01] at the end of my message you have made
[1:18:03] history you're the first black man he
[1:18:04] said to ever preach from my pull
[1:18:10] pit I said God use
[1:18:14] us he's taken us to Mexico to Jamaica we
[1:18:18] were in Romania serving the people who
[1:18:21] were homeless and living under the salt
[1:18:25] under the
[1:18:26] streets down there with the
[1:18:27] infrastructure and visiting the
[1:18:30] hospitals where young people and older
[1:18:32] parents who were trying to keep
[1:18:34] themselves warmed and their cold
[1:18:35] temperatures would burn severely and did
[1:18:39] not have anything to treat the the burns
[1:18:42] except
[1:18:43] Vaseline and you know what Vaseline does
[1:18:46] to Burns increases the the
[1:18:49] burn when we showed up when we had
[1:18:52] medical treatment that we took from for
[1:18:56] with a team we
[1:18:58] purchased burn cream and we showed up
[1:19:01] because they told us you have to put
[1:19:02] this garment on and we looked like the
[1:19:04] medical staff but when we walked in and
[1:19:06] they all looked at us and feared our
[1:19:09] presence because we look like everybody
[1:19:11] else and they didn't want any more of
[1:19:12] this cream this Vaseline but we had
[1:19:16] healing bomb I'm going to want you to
[1:19:19] think on that word healing bom
[1:19:25] to apply to severe burns severe injuries
[1:19:28] somebody here tonight has been severely
[1:19:32] injured and God has brought you through
[1:19:35] he's come and knocked at your door
[1:19:37] because he is the healing
[1:19:47] bom and he's waiting for you to receive
[1:19:53] him I did not know that in January well
[1:19:57] late December as a school teacher over
[1:20:00] in Savannah I would drive from Buford to
[1:20:04] Savannah and teach elementary
[1:20:07] school and when I said to my students
[1:20:09] I'll see you next year it was our
[1:20:11] Christmas break we didn't
[1:20:14] know
[1:20:16] that the enemy had a different
[1:20:21] plan so I long ago asked God to use in
[1:20:24] Ministry and also allow me to be a
[1:20:27] teacher well he's given me a prophetic
[1:20:29] Ministry and he's also allowed me to
[1:20:31] teach in my
[1:20:35] Ministry and as I made several trips to
[1:20:38] South
[1:20:40] Sudan walked the grounds at a 115 degree
[1:20:44] temperature my pastor friend and I
[1:20:47] walked nearly 10 miles carrying our
[1:20:49] backs to get to a village of
[1:20:52] 16,000 refugees
[1:20:55] who had fled the assault of a
[1:21:00] machete and assault rifles they slept in
[1:21:05] the
[1:21:06] bush and one young man who was one of
[1:21:09] the refugees from years past talked
[1:21:14] about as a young teenage boy running
[1:21:18] with thousands of other young men and
[1:21:21] coming across a fallen elephant and
[1:21:24] having to eat from the the meat he was
[1:21:28] one of the stronger ones who could tear
[1:21:30] that flesh of an elephant with his own
[1:21:33] teeth and then bite it into smaller
[1:21:35] bites to give to the younger boys so
[1:21:36] they could survive having lost his own
[1:21:40] parents behind him he kept pressing
[1:21:43] forward I want you to think on that
[1:21:46] pressing
[1:21:49] forward in the latter part of December
[1:21:53] my testimony I can't get it all without
[1:21:57] asking my wife Mary my bride of 46
[1:22:02] years to come and and help me out and
[1:22:05] I'll call her up and she'll she'll help
[1:22:08] me with the specific
[1:22:11] details but as
[1:22:14] I we were preparing to go
[1:22:18] to
[1:22:20] Florida with family our daughter and
[1:22:23] grandkids we were going to go and I was
[1:22:25] a passenger Mary and Jess our daughter
[1:22:28] was up front and I'm sitting
[1:22:30] behind entertaining the kids behind me
[1:22:33] and I'm leaned over because there was a
[1:22:35] little irritation on the side of my neck
[1:22:37] on the right side right here felt like
[1:22:39] about the size of your knuckle if you
[1:22:41] pull it up like that and just pinch it
[1:22:43] off there's a little bump there and I
[1:22:45] thought what it's not a shaving bump I
[1:22:48] don't know what that is and I leaned
[1:22:51] forward and said to my wife and daughter
[1:22:52] do you see this anybody else see this I
[1:22:55] can see what I feel and they looked at
[1:22:57] it Mary saids do you think we should go
[1:22:59] home and I said no we'll be fine let's
[1:23:01] just go on and have a good time at the
[1:23:03] end of our Florida trip we were to go to
[1:23:06] San
[1:23:06] Diego visit our son and daughter-in-law
[1:23:09] for Christmas they had invited and sent
[1:23:12] tickets for us to come out so it was at
[1:23:15] the end of our coming back we were going
[1:23:17] out for Christmas Day and coming back on
[1:23:18] the
[1:23:19] 29th is that
[1:23:22] right in the two weeks span of time this
[1:23:26] little irritation of a bump that Mary
[1:23:29] says was about the size of an avocado
[1:23:32] seed had grown to where it was pushing
[1:23:35] up behind my right ear and down under my
[1:23:39] clavicle big
[1:23:42] Mass
[1:23:44] before getting the attention that we
[1:23:47] needed God was using this to his glory
[1:23:58] an
[1:23:59] oncologist who was alarmed at at the
[1:24:02] report of Dr Kenneth Brown some of you
[1:24:04] may know him he's a ear nose and throat
[1:24:07] specialist here in Buford I'd gone to
[1:24:09] him because my daughter-in-law in bluon
[1:24:11] who's a nurse said Dad this is not
[1:24:14] something you take to your general
[1:24:16] practitioner you need to go see an ear
[1:24:17] nose and throat specialist I called Dr
[1:24:19] Brown he had me come in he diagnosed and
[1:24:23] thought it was a cyst
[1:24:25] gave me the name of that cist and I went
[1:24:27] back home and Googled images and it
[1:24:29] looked just like what I had looking at
[1:24:31] in the mirror and I said okay he's spot
[1:24:33] on he called it what it
[1:24:35] is and uh he liked to take a biopsy of
[1:24:39] it they took a biopsy of it and then
[1:24:41] when they came back and he called and
[1:24:43] spoke to Mary and said I don't know what
[1:24:46] it is but I don't
[1:24:47] it's spreading very
[1:24:51] quickly not sure if it was Mal malignant
[1:24:54] or
[1:24:57] beny but he said I need to get in touch
[1:24:59] with some oncologist and then one
[1:25:00] oncologist they called him back out of
[1:25:03] several calls on January 12 says I can
[1:25:06] see him Dr Brown says got good news he
[1:25:09] said the problem is I can't see him
[1:25:10] until the 19th Dr Brown's response was
[1:25:13] if we wait till the 19th I don't think
[1:25:15] he'll be
[1:25:18] here
[1:25:19] wow what's today's date
[1:25:27] this is in
[1:25:30] January that was a devil's plan yeah I
[1:25:35] heard pastors say God's Got A
[1:25:38] Plan you know sometimes we look
[1:25:41] for joyful moments happy moments and we
[1:25:44] look to eliminate all the trials and
[1:25:47] troubles
[1:25:48] and no we're looking for a way out by
[1:25:53] eliminating all those challenges that
[1:25:55] life will bring our
[1:25:58] way but I want to tell you that it is
[1:26:01] through those
[1:26:03] things that we'll find our joy Pastor
[1:26:07] said all your answers are going to come
[1:26:09] right
[1:26:11] here and I'm going to tell you he spot
[1:26:18] on because what we found
[1:26:21] out is that
[1:26:26] because of that report from the
[1:26:28] oncologist that says I can see in in
[1:26:30] seven days Dr Brown moved right on we
[1:26:33] got in touch with the MUSC up in
[1:26:37] Charleston and we were taken in and I
[1:26:40] literally spent seven months I've gone
[1:26:42] through six rounds of
[1:26:44] failed
[1:26:50] chemo the doctors outlined we'll do this
[1:26:53] first step if that fails we'll go to
[1:26:56] this step if that fails we'll go to step
[1:27:00] three step four if that
[1:27:03] fills we're probably going to go
[1:27:06] to car T something I never heard of they
[1:27:11] would harvest my cells Harvest SE tea
[1:27:15] cells they would hook me up to a machine
[1:27:17] that would take blood through a portal
[1:27:20] feed it into a machine that's running
[1:27:22] constantly for five hours long
[1:27:24] now I'm looking at the blood going
[1:27:26] through this tubing going into that
[1:27:28] machine and some coming back into my
[1:27:30] body and then this little bag that's
[1:27:32] hanging on a pole that's empty is now
[1:27:35] filling up with tea cell tea blood
[1:27:39] cells I said how do you know when it's
[1:27:41] going to get enough they already
[1:27:44] programmed it the machine would
[1:27:46] automatically cut off when it had
[1:27:49] enough God gave man the
[1:27:52] mind to come up with something something
[1:27:54] so elaborate talking about technology
[1:27:57] being
[1:27:58] Advanced Pastor just didn't know how
[1:28:00] much he was telling my
[1:28:05] story The advancement of Technology
[1:28:08] allowed man to come up with a machine
[1:28:10] that would empty blood out of my body
[1:28:13] put the good stuff back in here and
[1:28:14] harvest tea cells that they would send
[1:28:16] off to get engineered that would come
[1:28:18] back and be brought back into my
[1:28:22] body when they open up a book and had a
[1:28:24] meeting with us and they said here's
[1:28:27] what this is all
[1:28:28] about I'm skipping because I'm listening
[1:28:31] to him but I'm looking on here and I see
[1:28:33] the bullets that said this thing can
[1:28:36] cause
[1:28:38] death I closed the
[1:28:43] book I did I closed the book and I don't
[1:28:46] want to read
[1:28:48] it but I knew we had already gone
[1:28:51] through step one step two step three
[1:28:53] step four now we're
[1:28:56] step five they're going to come in and
[1:28:59] give me another thing they gave me a
[1:29:00] shot of radiation because all the other
[1:29:02] things that stopped had failed and this
[1:29:05] big it has started to diminish and we
[1:29:09] were praising God for it but then he
[1:29:11] says like wamo you know you hit that
[1:29:15] little popup head it goes down but it
[1:29:18] pops up over there and you you hit it
[1:29:21] over here and it pops up over there and
[1:29:22] that's kind of respon cancer was doing a
[1:29:26] number of CAT scans where they introduce
[1:29:29] fluid that lights up everything on the
[1:29:31] inside so they can see what they're
[1:29:33] looking for back in January this thing
[1:29:37] that we could
[1:29:39] see with black against a white
[1:29:43] background and it was so large that it
[1:29:46] was down under here that we couldn't
[1:29:49] see it had pushed nodes that was swollen
[1:29:53] about about the size of a tangerine
[1:29:55] under my armpit
[1:29:57] here up under my shoulder back here
[1:30:00] under my left knee behind the leg there
[1:30:03] was another that was about that size and
[1:30:05] I saw this thing is moving and moving
[1:30:07] moving my right eye was now pushing out
[1:30:11] of the
[1:30:14] socket I see you
[1:30:18] clearly the voice of God is saying to
[1:30:21] you I see you clearly amen
[1:30:26] I know where you
[1:30:31] live he alone is able to make all things
[1:30:35] work together
[1:30:44] am for the good of those who love
[1:30:47] him I'm laying up in the hospital MUSC
[1:30:50] and I said God you've allowed me to make
[1:30:53] history in the Philippines you've
[1:30:55] allowed us to smuggle Bibles into

[1:31:09] Sudan walking among 26,000 refugees and
[1:31:14] stretching out my hand and praying for
[1:31:15] them because in that camp on the same
[1:31:19] ground that they slept on there's
[1:31:21] animals running around and there's feces
[1:31:25] and there's human sickness and there's
[1:31:28] extreme 115 degree temperature and you
[1:31:31] got several families living on the one
[1:31:33] tent roof
[1:31:40] overcrowded I've done all that and I've
[1:31:42] never been hospital all my life Wow but
[1:31:45] here we
[1:31:46] are I visited others in the hospital I
[1:31:49] prayed for others in the hospital but
[1:31:52] I'd never on my own account been
[1:31:54] hospitalized and here I am on my 68th
[1:31:57] birthday getting birthday balloons from
[1:31:59] my family and cards and
[1:32:09] chemo but
[1:32:13] God but
[1:32:17] God did you hear
[1:32:20] meall but God hallelujah amen
[1:32:24] there was a night it was a horrible
[1:32:26] night I could tell you each little
[1:32:29] detail G gory details about the
[1:32:32] different chapters of this sickness and
[1:32:34] the doctors that would say your
[1:32:35] headaches that had you crying out like a
[1:32:38] baby were worse than the worst migrain
[1:32:42] headache my bladder was so messed up I
[1:32:44] had two inserted in my back one hanging
[1:32:47] on either side that was collecting my
[1:32:49] urine that had to be emptied every day
[1:32:52] yeah
[1:32:57] they say you'll lose your your hair I
[1:32:59] lost it
[1:33:00] all I didn't even have eyebrows
[1:33:06] Brothers all the way down to my feet I
[1:33:10] mean you know you ladies that might take
[1:33:13] the
[1:33:15] razor I didn't have to take the razor I
[1:33:18] didn't have to shave any longer a kind
[1:33:20] of I don't have to shave but I'm looking
[1:33:23] in the mirror and I'm thinking oh my
[1:33:25] gosh I see this little raised skin up
[1:33:28] here where eyebrows were usually there
[1:33:30] but there's no there's no hair I looked
[1:33:33] kind of
[1:33:36] freakish now when I'm used to I lost 60
[1:33:40] lbs
[1:33:48] wow and at one night after a horrible
[1:33:52] night of being awaken and awaken and
[1:33:55] awaken because constantly they were
[1:33:56] coming into my room I had a visit from
[1:34:00] my second oldest son and his family he
[1:34:05] came in with a question Dad how you
[1:34:07] doing I I'm I'm doing pretty good right
[1:34:10] now right now he said joh you rest last
[1:34:13] night and I said I'm glad you asked I
[1:34:15] get to tell somebody last night
[1:34:19] Josh I said I'm so used to hear him him
[1:34:23] come in and getting interrupted right
[1:34:25] the time I'm closing my eyes and sleep
[1:34:26] is coming over me and then there's
[1:34:28] somebody waking me
[1:34:30] up I said but I I I felt this Presence
[1:34:34] at the door and I look over to my
[1:34:38] right the lights were low but I saw a
[1:34:42] shadow and I thought here they come
[1:34:45] again but the holy spirit quickened in
[1:34:47] my spirit there's not one of
[1:34:50] them and
[1:34:52] I I
[1:34:55] stiffened because I
[1:34:58] knew it was the angel of
[1:35:02] death
[1:35:06] it you can't come in
[1:35:11] here and I said it twice and I turned my
[1:35:15] way away from
[1:35:17] that and I looked over to the dark side
[1:35:20] of the room but it wasn't dark because
[1:35:22] it wasum at by a
[1:35:29] presence I
[1:35:34] it and my
[1:35:37] thought it has to
[1:35:40] be and then I was interrupted in my
[1:35:42] thoughts by these words I'm not going
[1:35:47] anywhere wow and I reached out and
[1:35:50] grasped and I said I'm not letting you
[1:35:53] go
[1:35:55] and I held onise God praise the Lord I I
[1:35:59] I just have to share this I wrote it
[1:36:01] down so I make sure I said it right my
[1:36:04] son is ining good night he was at the
[1:36:06] house sending me a
[1:36:09] message I wrote it down so I could read
[1:36:11] it to you because it was on my heart to
[1:36:13] to share this and then I want to ask
[1:36:15] Mary to come up as a Christian
[1:36:19] believer our ministry should be an
[1:36:21] honest and a proven one I hope your walk
[1:36:24] with the Lord is as an honest one and a
[1:36:26] proven one there should be no doubt as
[1:36:30] to our commitment to God our walk with
[1:36:32] God should be such that if our message
[1:36:34] of glad tidings be hidden it's only
[1:36:37] hidden to those that are
[1:36:38] sinners good right those that are lost
[1:36:41] our Creator God knows of our trial our
[1:36:44] our frail nature and it's intended that
[1:36:47] we take no credit for the greatness of
[1:36:49] his saving power we may find ourselves
[1:36:53] pressed on every side perplexed
[1:36:55] persecuted and struck down but we are
[1:36:59] not
[1:37:04] crushed we are not driven to despair we
[1:37:07] are not
[1:37:08] deserted and are not nor will we ever be
[1:37:15] destroyed from The Book of Romans 5
[1:37:20] veres 1 to3 1 2 and and
[1:37:25] three therefore since we have been
[1:37:27] justified by faith we have peace with
[1:37:30] God Amen through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:34] through him we have also obtained access
[1:37:37] by faith and to this grace in which we
[1:37:40] stand and we rejoice in the hope of the
[1:37:42] glory of God not
[1:37:45] only that but we rejoice in our
[1:37:48] sufferings
[1:37:50] knowing that our suffering produces wife
[1:37:56] tribulation
[1:37:58] tribulations
[1:38:02] produce patience patience patience
[1:38:06] produces
[1:38:07] character character
[1:38:14] produces okay you don't have that up
[1:38:16] there I'm sorry the
[1:38:18] character
[1:38:20] produces hope
[1:38:23] and the word of God
[1:38:26] says hope does not put us to shame amen
[1:38:30] amen because God's love has been poured
[1:38:34] into our hearts through the Holy Spirit
[1:38:37] who has been given to
[1:38:39] us
[1:38:41] and there are things that I I can recall
[1:38:46] but there was such a great period a gray
[1:38:49] gray horrible gray period during this
[1:38:51] whole episode this whole Journey that I
[1:38:54] could not at
[1:38:57] the announcement they would come in and
[1:39:00] say because they were checking for
[1:39:03] neurotoxicity they would come in and
[1:39:05] insert a needle into my back that was
[1:39:08] about that long and they tell me I'm
[1:39:12] going to feel a little nudge and I felt
[1:39:14] more a great More Than A little nudge I
[1:39:16] felt an extreme pain but I did it five
[1:39:18] times they want to make sure that the
[1:39:19] cancer that was showing up on the scan
[1:39:23] uh pull a picture if you will picture
[1:39:25] number one who has the
[1:39:29] control I got it back
[1:39:33] there I don't know if you have it where
[1:39:35] it says number one I saw Travis when
[1:39:37] they were at my home
[1:39:39] today asking what order I wanted they
[1:39:41] shared in not number
[1:39:46] one
[1:39:47] picture yeah yeah that one looks okay so
[1:39:51] you can see on the right side of the
[1:39:52] neck this huge
[1:39:57] growth well you heard me talk about that
[1:40:00] go to the next one that was after they
[1:40:03] cut and taken a couple of biopsies and
[1:40:06] the wounds were trying to heal but I
[1:40:09] couldn't I couldn't keep my head
[1:40:11] straight I couldn't turn it to the right
[1:40:13] because of the pressure of this thing
[1:40:14] was so intense so intense it it kept me
[1:40:18] from turning to the right and at night
[1:40:21] time I couldn't lay my head over on my
[1:40:23] left side because I'm pulling against
[1:40:25] this thing and I'm learning to sleep in
[1:40:27] a different pattern because this is the
[1:40:29] only comfortable spot and if I turn it
[1:40:32] was Awakening me with extense just
[1:40:34] intense pain and go to the next
[1:40:37] one there's another view after I started
[1:40:41] losing almost all
[1:40:47] hair taking selfies and then go to the
[1:40:50] next one please
[1:40:54] that
[1:40:55] large growth on the side of my neck
[1:40:58] would be uppermost
[1:41:02] one I didn't know but the scan showed
[1:41:05] the cancer was up into the back of both
[1:41:07] eyes which now I know this is why my
[1:41:11] eyes are constantly running tears and
[1:41:13] Mary said you're okay cuz your eyes are
[1:41:15] all red puffy it was a cancer that was
[1:41:17] up in there wow
[1:41:20] brother thank you
[1:41:25] anyway all the black that you see on
[1:41:28] that skin on that white background was
[1:41:32] cancer so when they told us that it was
[1:41:35] spreading quickly it was very
[1:41:39] aggressive and my organs that are not
[1:41:42] very clearly visible you couldn't see
[1:41:45] them because they were hidden they were
[1:41:47] masked by the
[1:41:52] cancer the Bible teaches that the
[1:41:54] prayers of the
[1:41:58] righteous I'm I'm waiting for you Avail
[1:42:02] is much now he didn't say a little
[1:42:07] much I thank God that there are those of
[1:42:09] you who in this body stood with us as
[1:42:12] Watchmen on the wall
[1:42:16] amen cuz I heard about your prayers my
[1:42:19] response to people as I would say to you
[1:42:22] don't quit
[1:42:25] because we were on The Winning Side I've
[1:42:27] heard Pastor talk about that praise to
[1:42:29] God that you're on the winning
[1:42:31] side we were on The Winning Side God was
[1:42:34] proving himself faithful the Bible
[1:42:35] teaches that he watches over his word to
[1:42:37] perform it in our lives he didn't say
[1:42:40] wait till you're gone then I I'll show
[1:42:42] you what you missed out on or I'll show
[1:42:45] the devil and shake my fist at him uhuh
[1:42:47] you thought you want but God allows us
[1:42:49] to
[1:42:50] experience his miraculous healing power
[1:42:55] amen amen thank you for a
[1:42:59] testimony but I had to endure the test
[1:43:02] sometimes we are taken and we are shown
[1:43:04] the struggle sometimes he takes us
[1:43:06] through the struggle and sometimes we
[1:43:08] have to have that attitude of Shadrach
[1:43:11] mesach and abendigo where we say no
[1:43:13] matter no matter what
[1:43:26] and because I said and I fed myself and
[1:43:29] Mary who was there at my side every time
[1:43:33] I open my
[1:43:35] eyes in a glimour of hope she was there
[1:43:37] I could not even respond to the staff
[1:43:41] the medical staff who said tell me your
[1:43:42] name and date of
[1:43:44] birth I'm 68 years old now I can't tell
[1:43:48] you my first and last name I couldn't
[1:43:51] tell you as a teacher
[1:43:53] been teaching for years I could not
[1:43:55] count from 100 to Zero by
[1:43:58] 10
[1:44:01] backwards I'm looking at my wife my eyes
[1:44:03] pleading I'm tearing I'm looking at her
[1:44:06] pleading silently help
[1:44:09] me I'm embarrassed I
[1:44:13] can't I couldn't move couldn't raise my
[1:44:16] arm couldn't get off my
[1:44:18] bed I showed Travis and Pastor M Matt
[1:44:23] picture where they had wires on both Sid
[1:44:27] of the head with
[1:44:29] patches monitoring Mary says it it
[1:44:33] looked because these wires were feeding
[1:44:35] information to a machine that people
[1:44:38] were monitoring and they were looking
[1:44:39] for
[1:44:40] neurotoxicity and looking to see if any
[1:44:43] neurological stuff was affected by the
[1:44:47] cancer and and and it put me in
[1:44:52] ICU for how long a
[1:44:55] week um I was in
[1:44:58] a desperate
[1:45:02] place but your prayers Avail it
[1:45:06] much your prayers availeth
[1:45:10] much your
[1:45:15] prayers
[1:45:17] ath much praise the Lord amen and it's
[1:45:21] because of your prayers and the prayers
[1:45:24] of the righteous added to
[1:45:27] yours because God had given us
[1:45:29] opportunity to smuggle bies into China
[1:45:31] we had people all over the world praying
[1:45:34] for us here in
[1:45:39] Buford and God was
[1:45:43] faithful because he heard your prayers
[1:45:47] thank and then he decided on our last
[1:45:50] Cat Skin a little over two weeks ago
[1:45:53] about three weeks ago when I was up for
[1:45:54] my last visit and we were to go back in
