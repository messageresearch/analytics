[13:55] brother caleb and sister joy had bought
[13:57] a house
[13:58] and they have a new house it's new to
[14:00] them
[14:02] it's not recently new but i've been
[14:04] twisting his arm trying to get him to
[14:06] do a youth meeting to open up his home
[14:09] so on saturday

[14:37] this or not but
[14:38] he's going through paramedic training

[14:45] you set aside a year of your life
[14:47] and he's still doing firefighting and
[14:49] all these other things
[14:51] so joy doesn't get to see him much
[14:54] and when i see him he's always tired so

[31:18] a
[31:18] thought that came to me very early this
[31:21] morning
[31:22] and just want to look to the lord to see
[31:25] how many have a need amen i have
[31:28] great needs in my life and i know that
[31:31] that the
[31:32] lord is here to answer them
[31:35] all amen
[31:38] [Music]
[31:40] why don't you go ahead brother travis
[31:43] and give me that
[31:44] image
[31:46] [Music]
[31:48] this is a curious image it's very nice
[31:50] image whoever did it
[31:52] did a very nice job this title my sermon
[31:55] tonight now
[31:56] i got this just to give you a little
[31:58] insight
[32:00] i i woke up very early this morning
[32:03] probably a little after
[32:04] four o'clock and just immediately began
[32:07] praying asking the lord
[32:10] you know i had material but i never get
[32:13] i never know
[32:14] for sure if that's the material he wants
[32:16] me to use
[32:17] and so i just i'm always looking to say
[32:20] lord
[32:21] i don't mind last-minute changes and i
[32:24] just
[32:25] prayed there for a little while and just
[32:26] talked to the lord about the service
[32:28] tonight about this service
[32:30] i knew you know we'd have some people
[32:32] here and you'd have needs like me
[32:34] amen and i just always remind the lord
[32:38] of that
[32:39] that lord these are your people and they
[32:42] have needs and i
[32:43] know that you'll meet and i
[32:47] drifted back off to sleep and
[32:50] i don't know somewhere some i forget
[32:52] maybe sometime after six
[32:54] i woke again and immediately started
[32:57] praying again lord it's wednesday
[32:59] there's going to be people gathered and
[33:01] a little more than
[33:03] a little more than 12 or 13 hours from
[33:05] now your family is going to come and
[33:07] gather in a building
[33:08] and we're going to look to you and you
[33:11] just let us talk to lord i don't know
[33:12] how you pray but i talk to him like i'm
[33:14] talking to you
[33:15] he's my friend amen i have a very
[33:18] personal relationship with him and
[33:21] i just laid there and just prayed a
[33:23] little while and just prayed
[33:24] just specifically about this service
[33:27] and i said of course lord you know in my
[33:30] notes there's several different things
[33:31] i've been looking at and could carry on
[33:33] very easily
[33:34] with any one of them and i you know i
[33:37] must
[33:38] have drifted back off just laying there
[33:40] praying
[33:41] and i think sometime then after seven
[33:43] which now by now is really late for me
[33:45] to sleep
[33:47] and sometime after seven o'clock i just
[33:50] came bolt awake and the lord
[33:54] began to speak to my heart immediately
[33:58] he said i want you to go to church and i
[34:01] want you to tell the people the king is
[34:03] coming amen
[34:06] and it it broke before me as an image
[34:08] and i i don't know if i was still in
[34:09] that
[34:10] i'm not a prophet i don't see visions
[34:12] but
[34:14] i don't know if i was in that twilight
[34:16] between wake fully getting awake i know
[34:18] i've i said i won't bolt awake but
[34:21] this was happening as i was coming bolt
[34:24] awake
[34:25] and i heard that and i saw that image
[34:27] and i saw
[34:29] myself excited
[34:33] and i was running to tell everybody the
[34:35] king is coming
[34:36] amen and i i started
[34:39] after i got awake and i got my bearings
[34:41] i said lord that's a wonderful
[34:43] sermon what you're gonna have to build
[34:44] it for me because it's brand new that's
[34:45] all i got the king is coming
[34:48] and so you know i realized that
[34:52] to get to that place friends the world
[34:55] is not a
[34:56] a very peaceful place the war
[35:00] paul talks about how that we fight not
[35:02] against flesh and blood
[35:04] amen but against principalities
[35:07] powers high wickedness in high places
[35:10] powers of darkness
[35:11] now you need to understand that that
[35:14] that battle
[35:16] that's the same battle in revelation 12
[35:19] where
[35:20] lucifer fought against michael and that
[35:23] started before genesis
[35:25] that started back in the eternities that
[35:27] battle's been raging all the while
[35:29] it it it it fell down into the earth
[35:32] you know what happened in the garden and
[35:34] that battle's been raging and god's
[35:36] family's been fighting it
[35:38] and paul was saying hey we're still
[35:40] fighting it
[35:42] and revelation 12 shows that it's going
[35:44] to finally come to an end
[35:45] and but here we are fighting it
[35:49] and i'll tell you something friends
[35:52] fight
[35:53] with confidence amen because the king is
[35:56] coming amen
[35:58] and so i i kept thinking about this all
[36:01] morning
[36:01] we got a fight there's a battle it's
[36:03] raging and i s and that's the way the
[36:05] lord led me and i
[36:06] i jumped on checking
[36:09] pardon this little testimony but you
[36:11] know i'm taking all this time but i just
[36:13] want to put you
[36:14] put you in the vision with me
[36:17] and i was just making sure checking
[36:20] messages that came in through the night
[36:22] any prayer requests i
[36:23] was catching up getting ready for the
[36:25] bible study this morning
[36:27] catching the last part of brother jd's
[36:30] morning study that's really good
[36:32] if you all want a good bible study to
[36:34] you come on at 7 hey
[36:35] jd 7 30 so you can sleep an extra half
[36:38] an hour and catch a bible study
[36:40] and then uh and then right from there i
[36:42] jumped straight had just a quick little
[36:44] bit of time and
[36:45] jumped into the uh morning lesson there
[36:48] with those brothers from different i say
[36:50] the west coast it's actually going
[36:51] everywhere now it's all kind of all over
[36:53] up in
[36:54] canada and everywhere but
[36:57] as i was thinking about all that and so
[36:59] i'm looking for prayer requests looking
[37:01] for any
[37:03] who's the teacher is it me who is it and
[37:05] i i
[37:06] checked which i rarely check i tell
[37:08] people all the time don't send me stuff
[37:09] on facebook messenger because i might
[37:10] check it once
[37:12] maybe once a month um i'm on whatsapp or
[37:15] you can
[37:15] hit me up sms but i rarely see
[37:19] facebook messenger stuff but i i just
[37:22] for some reason
[37:23] checked it and my sister sister lisa
[37:26] had posted this on our website and when
[37:28] i saw that i went
[37:29] pow perfect
[37:33] and i thought i'm gonna take that image
[37:35] and i'm just gonna show it to the church
[37:36] and tonight i want to speak to you on a
[37:39] battle plan
[37:41] i hope you got one you're gonna need one
[37:46] amen you believe it so we're going to
[37:49] hit first thessalonians 5 we're going to
[37:51] hit ephesians 6.
[37:53] so to open your bibles i want them just
[37:56] to leave that there rather than turning
[37:58] to
[37:59] rather than putting it on the screen
[38:00] let's just open our bibles to first
[38:02] thessalonians 5
[38:04] 17 and
[38:07] you know this is for
[38:10] for me first thessalonians is a
[38:13] scripture that
[38:14] that actually means quite a bit to me
[38:16] especially
[38:18] this fifth chapter
[38:23] and for the reason is is that this was
[38:26] one of the very
[38:27] first sermons i ever took in my ministry
[38:31] nearly 30 years ago when it went uh
[38:34] as a when i evolved to a pulpit ministry
[38:37] and i love this passage i would love to
[38:40] start
[38:41] at verse one um and i and and let's just
[38:45] let's just do that
[38:46] let's start at verse one and i'm going
[38:48] to skip
[38:49] a little bit of it but of the times and
[38:53] seasons brethren you have no need that i
[38:56] write into you
[38:58] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[39:00] day of the lord
[39:01] so cometh as a thief in the night for
[39:04] when they shall say
[39:05] peace and safety then sudden destruction
[39:08] cometh upon them
[39:10] as travail upon a woman with child and
[39:13] they
[39:14] shall not escape
[39:17] but ye brethren are not in darkness
[39:21] that that day should overtake you as a
[39:23] thief
[39:24] ye are the children of the light and the
[39:27] children of the day
[39:28] we are not of the night nor of the
[39:30] darkness isn't that wonderful
[39:33] now let's look at verse um
[39:39] verse 16.
[39:42] rejoice evermore amen
[39:46] pray without ceasing
[39:49] i just want you to think about that pray
[39:50] without ceasing you know there are
[39:52] people
[39:53] there are certain uh sex of religion
[39:57] there there's a sect in the uh i forget
[39:59] now it seemed like it's somewhere in
[40:01] europe
[40:02] and i saw a documentary on it and it's
[40:04] it's a movement
[40:06] where uh they literally
[40:09] move their lips all day long they take
[40:12] that literally
[40:13] and they they're never not praying
[40:16] and you know i i thought and i i saw it
[40:19] and i thought well
[40:21] i don't i don't really think that's
[40:22] required of us but you know something
[40:25] in the day and hour that you and i live
[40:27] in part of your battle plan
[40:29] needs to be heavy doses of prayer
[40:33] it's never been it it is
[40:36] and it is an essential business
[40:39] is prayer if there was ever uh uh
[40:42] uh something essential it ought to be
[40:45] prayer
[40:46] it's more important brother branham said
[40:48] you you know you can study too much
[40:50] you can read too much but you never can
[40:53] pray
[40:54] too much prayer is the greatest weapon
[40:58] love is the strongest force and prayer
[41:00] is the greatest weapon
[41:02] and i have found in my experience over
[41:05] the years
[41:06] that very often times people
[41:11] get into jams and it never occurs to
[41:14] them to pray
[41:16] and they run to every expert and every
[41:18] person to try to get some
[41:20] help and and sometimes i find that god
[41:24] has to strip you down to
[41:27] to to just take every other option away
[41:30] from you
[41:30] until he gets you down to your last best
[41:33] option that should have been your first
[41:34] option
[41:35] prayer sometimes he strips us down to
[41:38] our last best weapon
[41:41] and i i think that it is so undervalued
[41:44] now
[41:45] ephesians chapter 6 verse 11
[41:48] turn there with me
[41:53] ephesians 6 and we'll read 11 12
[41:57] and 13.
[42:03] put on the whole armor of god
[42:06] that you may be able to stand against
[42:09] the wiles
[42:10] of the devil for we wrestle
[42:13] not against flesh and blood but against
[42:16] principalities
[42:18] amen do you believe that
[42:23] against powers against the rulers of the
[42:26] darkness
[42:27] of this world against spiritual
[42:30] wickedness i mean it sounds like we are
[42:32] really outnumbered
[42:34] i want you to look at this this is you
[42:36] here's what's arrayed
[42:38] against you all right
[42:41] principalities powers
[42:44] rulers of darkness spiritual wickedness
[42:48] in high places wherefore or because of
[42:52] that
[42:52] or now that you know all that here's
[42:54] some good advice
[42:55] take unto you the whole armor of god
[42:59] that you may be able to withstand in the
[43:02] evil day now if language means anything
[43:06] i can say if you don't take the whole
[43:09] armor you won't stand
[43:11] amen you will get taken down
[43:15] it requires the whole armor that you may
[43:19] stand all right that you may be able to
[43:22] withstand
[43:23] in the evil day and having done all
[43:27] to stand then 14 goes
[43:30] stand therefore having your loins girt
[43:32] about with truth
[43:34] and having on the breastplate of
[43:36] righteousness it goes on down about
[43:38] talking about the whole body armor
[43:41] and and it's amazing i've always heard
[43:44] it since i was a kid i've heard
[43:45] preachers say
[43:46] there's no armor here for your back
[43:50] so don't run whatever you do
[43:53] you'll take an arrow from behind don't
[43:56] run
[43:56] you've got armor you've got a shield you
[43:59] got a sword
[44:00] use it all right so if you don't
[44:04] if you if you don't do that if you fail
[44:06] to have a battle plan there's a saying
[44:09] uh uh that talks about how that
[44:12] those who fail to prepare
[44:15] prepare to fail yeah uh those who
[44:18] prepare
[44:18] those who fail to prepare uh now i've
[44:22] got it all messed up see my
[44:24] those who fail to prepare
[44:27] say it again
[44:30] if you fail to prepare prepare to fail
[44:34] amen let's pray
[44:38] master we thank you for your love and
[44:40] your kindness to us
[44:42] i stand here lord and i my heart is just
[44:47] just full lord to think on this thought
[44:49] throughout the
[44:50] entire day lord i've just pondered it
[44:53] and pondered it and pondered it
[44:55] and i i feel such a such an excitement
[44:58] in my heart to give this announcement to
[45:01] the people tonight
[45:03] don't fear the king is coming lord we
[45:06] have a battle plan we
[45:07] we have a plan satan is turned loose
[45:11] upon the world like a roaring lion going
[45:13] about
[45:14] but father we have a plan we're prepared
[45:16] we have been prepared
[45:18] for this day that we are living in for
[45:21] quite a while now lord and
[45:23] i believe it is my belief in my heart
[45:26] that lord it's all been by design we
[45:29] would have desired to see
[45:31] lord the catching away of the church
[45:34] decades ago
[45:34] decades ago but father i know that you
[45:38] have had
[45:39] all things under your perfect control
[45:42] and you are clicking along without any
[45:45] there's no reservation in you lord
[45:47] there's no shadow of turning in you
[45:50] father it's it's a it's it now must be a
[45:53] word that comes into the bride because
[45:54] we
[45:55] realize this thing can't just keep going
[45:58] it can't just keep going lord we've come
[46:01] to that time i believe
[46:03] as we said to the church last weekend we
[46:06] are those upon whom the ends of the
[46:08] world have come
[46:09] now lord i've i've prepared the people
[46:12] have sang
[46:13] worship and there's been songs people
[46:15] have come out
[46:16] now that's humanly that's all we can do
[46:19] now father it's going to be up to you
[46:20] and of course the enemy
[46:22] will try to hinder it every way he can
[46:24] but father we're looking to the unseen
[46:26] now
[46:27] i put my faith and confidence in you
[46:30] in jesus name amen god bless you friends
[46:33] you can be seated and i want you just to
[46:35] leave that up brother just
[46:37] leave that image up for me
[46:50] you know the scripture
[46:53] has a number of prophecies
[46:57] regarding the end time that are very
[46:59] unique
[47:00] i i'm not going to turn to them all
[47:02] tonight in fact as i doubt that i'll
[47:04] turn to any other scriptures because i
[47:06] want to leave
[47:06] that up and i want to move quickly i
[47:08] decided not to use a powerpoint for that
[47:10] very reason
[47:12] but but we we're going to find out
[47:14] friends
[47:15] that that when the bible talks about for
[47:19] instance jesus will talk about and
[47:21] it's very familiar to us where when the
[47:23] fig tree puts forth
[47:25] its bud and and we know of course that
[47:28] that is uh more than more than a half a
[47:31] century ago
[47:33] well more it's probably 70 uh probably
[47:36] 70 i think it was 70 years in 2018.
[47:40] and so now here we are moving 70 plus
[47:44] years
[47:44] into the fulfillment of that scripture
[47:47] and
[47:48] to me you know you say wow i thought
[47:51] that generation
[47:52] wasn't to pass and until all things be
[47:55] be finished and be fulfilled but we also
[47:57] have to remember
[47:59] that it's it that jesus also said and
[48:02] all of these things and brother branham
[48:03] emphasized that i think i mentioned that
[48:05] to
[48:05] sunday that jesus that brother branham
[48:07] talks about that's not
[48:09] just the fig tree but when all of these
[48:11] other
[48:12] things begin to come forth and put forth
[48:15] their leave put when all these other
[48:19] things begin to be come into fulfillment
[48:21] now when you read if you're just
[48:24] a a prophecy reader and there's people
[48:27] who just do nothing but study prophecy
[48:29] i'm glad that when i study prophecy i
[48:32] have an
[48:32] answer in the word of god because it's
[48:34] very foreboding
[48:36] and when you read the things that are to
[48:38] come on the world i mean
[48:40] doom and gloom is almost an
[48:41] understatement you're like wow i mean
[48:44] how is anybody going to be able to stand
[48:46] what are the believers going to do
[48:48] when these kinds of things begin to fall
[48:51] upon the earth
[48:52] and it's a fair question you know it's
[48:55] uh
[48:55] it's something to consider and i'm i'm
[48:58] here to tell you and
[48:59] i want to make this point before i get
[49:00] too deep into my notes
[49:06] it is valid and it is noteworthy
[49:10] and you should have confidence in the
[49:13] fact
[49:13] that you are predestinated not to fail
[49:16] that you
[49:17] are that you have a gene of god and
[49:20] that according to the prophecy of jesus
[49:23] there is no way to deceive that last day
[49:26] bride
[49:27] he's already promised himself you
[49:30] amen all right and so
[49:34] you know you're going to find brother
[49:35] branham's going to make some statements
[49:37] and i i was surprised when i when i read
[49:40] the statements in warrior david it's
[49:42] 1955
[49:43] and brother branham is making such a
[49:46] case for election
[49:48] that even even i was stunned i thought
[49:50] wow
[49:52] this is 1955. this is this is a decade
[49:55] away
[49:56] from brother branham even using the term
[49:59] a gene of god
[50:00] amen but yet when he when he begins to
[50:04] speak about these quotes let me let me
[50:06] read you just a couple of statements
[50:07] that he says here
[50:08] so in the message the great warrior
[50:12] david so he says now
[50:16] we know it's it's god's will
[50:19] to save the lost that's easy all right
[50:23] we know it's god's will to heal the sick
[50:27] now watch now if we can positionally
[50:31] place ourself in his will
[50:34] then it's over he's about to pray for
[50:36] sick people and he's simply trying to
[50:38] get them to understand
[50:40] he's trying to build up their faith and
[50:41] trying to get them to think correctly
[50:43] about the word of god
[50:44] and in order for that to happen the
[50:47] people are going to have to place some
[50:49] confidence
[50:50] not in their flesh but in the fact that
[50:53] christ
[50:54] through election and by the new birth
[50:58] places you positionally in christ and so
[51:01] it's
[51:02] it's almost as if to say it's really not
[51:04] on you it's on him
[51:06] amen all you have to do
[51:09] is begin to confess that and to believe
[51:12] it
[51:13] and walk in it allow this word i'm here
[51:16] to tell you something friends there is
[51:18] nothing more valuable
[51:20] in your life than allowing the word to
[51:22] be the lord and master
[51:24] because the word of god knows every need
[51:27] you
[51:27] you have or will ever have and it
[51:30] already has the answer
[51:32] watch what he says he goes on now here
[51:35] he says
[51:37] so last night
[51:41] he said we were speaking of how that
[51:44] gifts and callings are without
[51:45] repentance
[51:46] it's god's election and foreknowledge
[51:50] is what makes the thing so if we have a
[51:53] desire
[51:54] the bible says it's not him that willeth
[51:57] or him that runeth but it's god
[51:59] that showeth mercy see it's not whether
[52:02] you will
[52:03] or whether you won't or where
[52:06] your desire is
[52:10] it's it's whether it's god's will or not
[52:14] all right watch or what you see so so he
[52:18] says
[52:20] so he says foreknowledge
[52:24] is what makes the thing so if we have a
[52:26] desire the bible said it's not him that
[52:28] willeth or him that runeth
[52:29] it's god that showeth mercy it's not
[52:31] whether you will there it is it's not
[52:32] whether you will
[52:33] or whether you want to amen amen
[52:37] amen it's not whether you will
[52:40] or whether you even want to or where
[52:43] your desire is
[52:44] it's whether it's god's will or not
[52:48] see then we have to find out god's will
[52:52] and if it's that perfect we can just set
[52:54] our faith to that and say
[52:56] that's it and we can run right all the
[52:59] way
[53:00] the will of god runs so you you realize
[53:03] here tonight i want to encourage you
[53:05] with something friends
[53:06] i know the world is falling apart i know
[53:10] you're there is a great army arrayed
[53:13] against you
[53:14] i know the world is burning down i get
[53:16] it disease
[53:17] judgment plague coming pre-tribulation
[53:20] uh
[53:21] things happening in the earth we've been
[53:22] talking quite a bit about it
[53:24] and there's never been a time where
[53:26] god's bride
[53:27] was facing more attack mentally
[53:31] emotionally spiritually
[53:34] but i'm here to tell you something
[53:36] friends you're held up not
[53:37] even by your own choice or by your own
[53:39] will or by your own grit you're held up
[53:42] because
[53:42] he chose you in him before the
[53:45] foundation of the world
[53:50] so he goes on now watch so it's whether
[53:54] god's will
[53:54] or not all right now
[53:59] he says how many christians here raise
[54:01] up your hand and i think we'd we'd
[54:03] in this building not we'd all put our
[54:04] hands up all right
[54:06] so how many christians in here raise up
[54:08] your hand all right
[54:11] you ready for this you got a seat belt
[54:13] on you're not a christian by your desire
[54:19] you're a christian by god's desire
[54:24] i i just i just i just see the devil
[54:26] getting hit between the eyes
[54:28] pow no man can come to me except my
[54:31] father draws him
[54:33] you was elected this is 1955.
[54:37] was elected by god before the foundation
[54:41] of the world to be a christian
[54:44] that's why you're a christian that's to
[54:46] say well i made a choice
[54:48] you were born to make that choice i have
[54:51] a desire
[54:52] that's actually god's desire hallelujah
[54:55] and it's beginning to operate it feels
[54:57] like your desire
[54:58] [Applause]
[54:59] amen amen isn't that amazing
[55:03] now i want you to catch the point
[55:05] brother branham is not just trying to
[55:07] preach a pep rally that i mean that's
[55:10] pep rally material
[55:11] that's not what his aim is he's trying
[55:14] to get the people in this audience
[55:16] where he's preaching this sermon he's
[55:18] trying to get him to understand look
[55:20] if that's all true then you ought to
[55:22] have the greatest amount of confidence
[55:24] in the world why would you then not
[55:26] believe god for whatever your need is
[55:29] whatever you're facing whatever your
[55:31] battle
[55:32] is right now and you might be facing
[55:34] multiple battles
[55:36] on multiple fronts and i'm here to tell
[55:38] you as soon as that one of those battles
[55:40] is over there's another one waiting
[55:42] behind it
[55:42] so why don't you just go ahead and make
[55:44] up your mind now
[55:46] well god's in control and i'm gonna keep
[55:49] going forward
[55:50] because i'm not even a christian because
[55:53] i decided to be
[55:54] i'm a christian because he decided to be
[55:58] well if that's true then how would he
[56:00] not help me win the battle
[56:03] you get the picture all right
[56:07] so he says here and he says you know
[56:11] that
[56:11] people you know you're not a christian
[56:13] by your desire you're a christian by
[56:14] god's desire no man can come except my
[56:16] father draws him first
[56:17] he was elected by god before the
[56:19] foundation of the world to be a
[56:20] christian that's scripture
[56:21] jesus said no man can come except my
[56:23] father calls him first
[56:25] he was elected called then when god
[56:29] elected you
[56:30] he called you and you heeded to his call
[56:33] then he poured the anointing oil on you
[56:36] the holy ghost
[56:38] when the cruse of oil he says now and he
[56:40] he
[56:41] he goes back to david being anointed
[56:44] by samuel and i don't want to get ahead
[56:46] of myself but i want to just give you
[56:48] this foundation
[56:50] and he goes back to where david is being
[56:53] anointed in the anointing oil being
[56:55] poured on him brother branham
[56:57] shows that it's an old testament type
[57:01] of you receiving the holy ghost all
[57:03] right
[57:04] and then here in 1955 he's been
[57:07] preaching all these years
[57:08] and he makes that statement and he says
[57:11] when he poured
[57:12] he says what does the oil represent in
[57:14] the bible holy spirit when he poured the
[57:16] oil
[57:16] upon him he baptized him with the holy
[57:19] spirit and symbol for him
[57:20] and brother branham says amen i hope you
[57:22] get that that just come fresh
[57:27] now not that the oil was the holy ghost
[57:29] brother madam always knew that and
[57:30] brother rabbis knew it would take the
[57:31] holy ghost but it's the first time he
[57:32] goes back in the life of david
[57:35] and he says wow i never caught that
[57:37] before and that just come fresh when
[57:39] david got the anointing oil poured upon
[57:42] him i'm here to tell you something
[57:43] friends
[57:44] brother branham is going to go on in
[57:46] this quote to say
[57:48] at that moment david was king
[57:52] amen and he's a scrubby boy
[57:55] brother brown caught him a scrub
[57:58] had all these big you know jesse's got
[58:01] all these
[58:02] you know sons he's here's all these big
[58:04] strapping
[58:06] you know warrior these guys are all in
[58:07] the army and and david's just a little
[58:10] little scrub out there and tending the
[58:12] father's sheep
[58:14] and as soon as he gets the holy ghost
[58:16] he's a king
[58:18] amen and and so when when you realize
[58:21] friends that to me this is so beautiful
[58:24] because
[58:25] once you get the baptism of the holy
[58:27] ghost you're you're
[58:28] you're already in position to defeat any
[58:31] devil
[58:32] any time any place under any condition
[58:35] you don't have to grow
[58:36] into that you don't have to come way on
[58:38] down the road and eventually after a few
[58:39] years
[58:40] i'll be able to live like a christian
[58:41] nonsense you're already a king when the
[58:44] baptism of the holy ghost comes upon you
[58:47] you already have authority
[58:50] see he says not sparingly he poured it i
[58:53] went all over him
[58:55] a whole hornful that's the way god
[58:58] pours the holy ghost on a man not
[59:01] sparingly
[59:02] just baptizes him into it anointing him
[59:06] with the spirit
[59:07] notice here it is right then when that
[59:10] anointing struck him
[59:12] he was positionally placed as king now
[59:15] you're positionally placed as his bride
[59:18] that's what the token has done in this
[59:21] hour
[59:21] i'm here to tell you something friends
[59:23] the reason the king is coming is because
[59:25] there's a bride to receive him
[59:28] hallelujah and that is what the devil is
[59:31] fighting the devil
[59:32] can't stop the king he's already taken a
[59:36] beating
[59:36] from the king but he's after the bride
[59:39] he's trying to stop
[59:41] his bride but he can't stop her because
[59:43] a bride has been prepared
[59:45] for this hour like esther you've been
[59:47] prepared you've been brought on the
[59:49] scene
[59:49] i don't know why you weren't here a
[59:51] hundred years ago i don't know
[59:52] you know why this happened in your life
[59:54] but i know this you're a believer
[59:56] because
[59:56] he decided you were hallelujah
[1:00:00] you've got faith because it's his faith
[1:00:04] and it does not matter i'm here to tell
[1:00:06] you it does not matter what you're
[1:00:08] facing
[1:00:09] the devil can't stop you if you
[1:00:13] accept that you are now positionally
[1:00:16] placed
[1:00:17] in christ as the bride
[1:00:20] with full authority glory amen amen
[1:00:24] amen anointing oil struck him
[1:00:29] he was positionally placed as a king
[1:00:32] amen
[1:00:34] you are positionally in christ jesus
[1:00:37] as kings and priests the moment you
[1:00:40] receive the holy spirit
[1:00:41] god places you in the kingdom and air
[1:00:44] what a beautiful picture there you are
[1:00:47] it's amazing
[1:00:50] he says here's david in this battle
[1:00:56] and it's an interesting thing when you
[1:00:57] think about the battle
[1:00:59] of david because you know he's he hears
[1:01:02] this giant brother ram said that that
[1:01:04] giant was making his boast
[1:01:06] but on that day he probably should have
[1:01:08] shut up because david come into the camp
[1:01:11] and until an anointed positionally
[1:01:15] placed
[1:01:16] child shows up the devil can say
[1:01:18] whatever he wants
[1:01:20] amen this is why you see the things that
[1:01:24] he does
[1:01:24] because positionally placed sons and
[1:01:26] daughters of god
[1:01:27] are are rare in the earth and so you you
[1:01:31] have the devils
[1:01:32] in control of the government why say why
[1:01:34] do they do such evil things
[1:01:36] really say you know in in the halls of
[1:01:39] education why do they teach
[1:01:41] such such things contrary to the
[1:01:43] scripture you really have to ask that
[1:01:46] why do we see the fabric of society so
[1:01:48] vile so polluted
[1:01:50] you know well what are they feeding on
[1:01:53] see and so so we find but
[1:01:57] but once i i'm going to tell you
[1:01:59] something friends
[1:02:00] you should walk around every day
[1:02:02] realizing
[1:02:03] that you are a duly authorized agent of
[1:02:07] almighty god
[1:02:08] and i don't care what situation you walk
[1:02:11] into
[1:02:12] and how many non-positionally placed
[1:02:14] people are there
[1:02:15] with all of their filth and all of their
[1:02:16] doubt you're a different person
[1:02:19] as paul said you're not of the darkness
[1:02:21] you're of the light you're a child of
[1:02:22] the light you're not of the night you're
[1:02:23] of the day
[1:02:24] paul is drawing a line of demarcation
[1:02:27] between them and says
[1:02:28] you're not them and they're not you
[1:02:31] understand and so so when we go forward
[1:02:35] you you know we have to have this
[1:02:37] attitude and i'm here to tell you you're
[1:02:38] going to need it in this hour
[1:02:40] and you're not going to successfully
[1:02:41] deploy it without a big prayer life
[1:02:45] and a confession that you believe the
[1:02:47] word of god and laying in the word and
[1:02:48] stop
[1:02:49] feeding on all everything from the world
[1:02:51] otherwise you'll be
[1:02:52] anemic and poisoned and weak and you
[1:02:54] won't have no effective power you might
[1:02:56] be a child of god that you won't have
[1:02:58] any effective power
[1:02:59] because you're not prayed up you're
[1:03:01] you're you're contaminated with too much
[1:03:03] of the world
[1:03:04] and that's where i read to you i think
[1:03:06] it was sunday where paul said you're
[1:03:07] gonna have to be
[1:03:08] careful about being overcharged with the
[1:03:12] things of the world
[1:03:13] amen at the last days don't be a glutton
[1:03:17] of laodicea
[1:03:19] we live here but we we live here as you
[1:03:21] know
[1:03:22] as as not as i'm from here i'm not from
[1:03:25] here i do live here
[1:03:26] but i'm not from here this world is not
[1:03:28] my home
[1:03:32] and we find that once david showed up
[1:03:35] now it's a different story
[1:03:37] because now you have in symbol in type
[1:03:41] a man who has the oil poured on him
[1:03:44] who is anointed by god who's called and
[1:03:48] elected to this position
[1:03:50] and you and you've now the king
[1:03:53] is in a tent hiding amen
[1:03:56] but the real king is out there going why
[1:03:59] don't we go kill him
[1:04:01] right and the real the the the national
[1:04:05] king
[1:04:06] is in there he don't have his armor on
[1:04:09] he's not planning to fight at all when
[1:04:10] david's ready to go fight he says okay
[1:04:12] well let me put my armor on you he don't
[1:04:13] have it on himself
[1:04:16] and and you know when david says you
[1:04:18] know i haven't proved this brother
[1:04:20] bradham said
[1:04:20] you know a theological degree doesn't
[1:04:22] work for a real servant of god
[1:04:26] i can't use creeds to fight him this
[1:04:28] armor i haven't proved these things
[1:04:30] you know let me go in the way that i
[1:04:32] know to go how was it that you went
[1:04:34] i i i recognized but brother branham
[1:04:37] tells it so
[1:04:38] in such in such great detail how that
[1:04:41] when david was out there
[1:04:43] and that lion grabbed a one of the
[1:04:46] sheep of his father and brother branham
[1:04:50] says i mean it wasn't like david was
[1:04:52] like
[1:04:54] boy is he going to pay david was
[1:04:56] actually afraid like you and i would be
[1:04:59] and he had to pray and brother branham
[1:05:02] said here was his prayer
[1:05:03] lord that's my father's sheep and i've
[1:05:07] been
[1:05:07] i've been put in this position to
[1:05:09] protect that sheep and you're going to
[1:05:11] have to help me lord because i'm going
[1:05:13] after him
[1:05:14] he had no ability to do it himself but
[1:05:16] he was trusting
[1:05:17] on his position that the father had
[1:05:20] placed him in
[1:05:21] and he knew if he did that then a
[1:05:23] supernatural god
[1:05:24] would have to come on the scene and a
[1:05:26] lion would get killed
[1:05:27] by a scrabby boy
[1:05:31] bear the same way and fortunately
[1:05:34] you know when he when he says to uh to
[1:05:38] to saul let me go in the way that i know
[1:05:41] and you know fortunately there was still
[1:05:44] enough in that backslid preacher
[1:05:46] you know saul prophesied with the
[1:05:48] prophets
[1:05:50] he's a backslid preacher and fortunately
[1:05:53] there was just enough gumption left in
[1:05:55] him
[1:05:56] to let david do it now it's interesting
[1:05:59] i want you to think about this for a
[1:06:00] minute
[1:06:03] because you've got a number of
[1:06:05] categories here
[1:06:07] you've got the king
[1:06:11] who's saying you can't do it
[1:06:15] you've got the army of israel
[1:06:20] cowering back amen
[1:06:23] you've got a giant saying
[1:06:27] saying here's what i'm going to do to
[1:06:29] you and giving him
[1:06:31] all of these bad prophecies i'm going to
[1:06:33] feed you to the fowls of the air
[1:06:35] you've got david's own family
[1:06:39] david's own family this when i thought
[1:06:41] about this it blew my mind
[1:06:43] here's his own family his brothers
[1:06:46] who saw him get anointed
[1:06:50] by a vindicated prophet they saw
[1:06:53] samuel they were standing there and they
[1:06:56] saw
[1:06:57] samuel thus saith the lord this
[1:07:00] is god's king and even his own brothers
[1:07:05] who were who were in the meetings and
[1:07:08] saw the miracles
[1:07:10] amen who walked and saw the supernatural
[1:07:14] and could not deny it
[1:07:16] and and and and and you know family
[1:07:18] members as it were because uh
[1:07:20] because you know brother branham said
[1:07:22] they're my brothers and because they
[1:07:24] claim the name of jesus and i claim it
[1:07:25] and
[1:07:25] you know and even even even trinitarians
[1:07:28] and oneness he said they're my brothers
[1:07:29] we're one
[1:07:30] and here you've got all of his brothers
[1:07:32] who saw the anointing knew it
[1:07:33] on him knew it was thus saith the lord
[1:07:36] could not deny it they
[1:07:38] there's no way to undo what they were
[1:07:39] standing there witnessing
[1:07:41] and yet here they are saying oh they
[1:07:43] even are starting to question his
[1:07:44] motives
[1:07:47] even starting to question his character
[1:07:49] i know why you're here
[1:07:52] you're acting like you're a christian
[1:07:54] but i know that's not
[1:07:56] why you're here you know you're a
[1:07:58] mischievous
[1:07:59] kid and you're just a punk and you're
[1:08:01] just trying to you know stir up some
[1:08:03] trouble
[1:08:04] and here is david standing there like
[1:08:06] christ
[1:08:08] perfectly completely innocent of that
[1:08:13] he had he only had one motive and you
[1:08:16] know what his motive
[1:08:17] was not to go face a giant his motive
[1:08:20] was to defend the honor of god amen
[1:08:25] david it wasn't like that david felt
[1:08:27] like ultraman david said
[1:08:29] look the the name of jehovah's in
[1:08:32] question here
[1:08:33] i can't let the name of jehovah be
[1:08:36] questioned
[1:08:37] and and brother branham talks about that
[1:08:38] he said you know even if i go down in
[1:08:41] defeat
[1:08:42] then i would still i'd still rather go
[1:08:44] down
[1:08:45] i'd still rather get defeated trying to
[1:08:46] defend the honor of the lord
[1:08:49] it's just like that like the three
[1:08:51] hebrew children told the king said well
[1:08:53] we don't know
[1:08:54] whether he'll deliver us or not we know
[1:08:55] he can but here's
[1:08:57] but that's that's a moot point your
[1:08:59] majesty
[1:09:01] we we don't know if he will we know we
[1:09:02] can we don't know if he will but that
[1:09:04] has nothing to do with it
[1:09:06] we're here to tell you that we're not
[1:09:07] going to defile
[1:09:09] the name of our lord by worshiping an
[1:09:11] idol
[1:09:12] do what you want to do we're not doing
[1:09:15] it
[1:09:18] and they had no idea the furnace was
[1:09:21] gonna be
[1:09:21] hit seven times hotter they had no idea
[1:09:25] it's gonna get so hot even their captors
[1:09:27] are gonna get fried putting them in
[1:09:29] there
[1:09:29] they had no idea a fourth man was coming
[1:09:32] in the fire
[1:09:32] but the fourth man was already waiting
[1:09:34] on him
[1:09:36] they had to be willing by faith by a
[1:09:38] commitment
[1:09:39] not not faith that we're we're going to
[1:09:41] get delivered
[1:09:42] but a committal that we're not going to
[1:09:45] bow
[1:09:47] and it doesn't that constant the
[1:09:48] consequences are
[1:09:50] of no concern to me i'm not worried
[1:09:52] about how this turns out
[1:09:54] i don't worry will i live or die or will
[1:09:56] i sink or swim i'm here to defend the
[1:09:58] honor of the name of the word of god
[1:10:01] and i'm gonna stand on it and then it's
[1:10:03] up to god friends you understand
[1:10:05] when you when you face a devil in that
[1:10:07] kind of frame of mind the devil don't
[1:10:09] know what to do with you
[1:10:11] because it wouldn't do him any good to
[1:10:12] threaten you it doesn't matter it won't
[1:10:14] do him any good to bring symptoms on you
[1:10:16] you don't care
[1:10:18] you don't care i'm here i'm going to
[1:10:19] claim the word of god well but you got
[1:10:21] this problem it doesn't matter that has
[1:10:23] nothing to do with the promise
[1:10:24] i'm going to claim the word of god i'm
[1:10:25] going to stand on it will he heal you i
[1:10:27] don't know
[1:10:28] it doesn't matter if he takes me i'll be
[1:10:30] healed if he leaves me then he'll heal
[1:10:32] me one
[1:10:32] way or the other i'm going to get healed
[1:10:38] and so we find then that
[1:10:41] we have to identify ourselves
[1:10:44] it's important now i want you to think
[1:10:47] for a minute which crowd do you belong
[1:10:48] to
[1:10:51] the family the army
[1:10:55] the king goliath
[1:10:58] the philistines their king their army
[1:11:03] you know what's amazing say about jason
[1:11:06] sometimes
[1:11:07] i just feel so alone and outnumbered
[1:11:10] there was one human
[1:11:12] in two national armies facing off
[1:11:17] two multi-ten thousand multi-tens of
[1:11:20] thousands
[1:11:21] army squaring off and kings on both
[1:11:25] sides
[1:11:26] and there was one human being on
[1:11:29] in all of that who was willing to say i
[1:11:33] will defend
[1:11:34] the name of god amen i want to tell you
[1:11:37] something friends
[1:11:39] i have made up my mind if the whole
[1:11:42] world won't serve him i'm going to
[1:11:46] if the whole world rejects him i'm going
[1:11:48] to accept him
[1:11:50] and if i have to walk alone brother
[1:11:52] branham said if i have to uh
[1:11:54] lay lay on my belly and and drink branch
[1:11:56] water and eat soda crackers he said i'm
[1:11:59] it doesn't matter what i they said well
[1:12:00] brother billy you preached to a
[1:12:02] to a to a post you preaching like that
[1:12:04] he said then i'll preach to the post
[1:12:06] amen i'm here to tell you something
[1:12:08] friends we're not looking for numbers
[1:12:10] we're not looking for popularity
[1:12:12] and god hasn't called you to success
[1:12:16] god has called you to be faithful not
[1:12:19] necessarily successful
[1:12:21] the devil would like to put you on that
[1:12:23] treadmill
[1:12:24] but success isn't measured that's not
[1:12:26] how god measures success
[1:12:28] i'm successful because he chose me he
[1:12:30] desired me
[1:12:31] he called me hallelujah he elected me he
[1:12:35] has anointed me
[1:12:36] and i'm going forward the king is coming
[1:12:39] and he's going to have a queen here to
[1:12:41] receive him he's going to have a bride
[1:12:42] and i made up my mind i'm in them
[1:12:44] i'm one of them i'm part of that number
[1:12:48] i have a battle plan today what's your
[1:12:49] battle plan to believe every word
[1:12:52] what's your battle plan to pray without
[1:12:53] ceasing what's your battle plan
[1:12:55] i'm gonna put on the whole armor of god
[1:12:57] because i know this ain't no joke this
[1:12:59] ain't disneyland or fairy tale
[1:13:01] this is real war and there's armies
[1:13:03] arrayed against me
[1:13:05] and i'm outnumbered i'm out gunned
[1:13:08] i might only have a slingshot
[1:13:14] i might only have a slingshot
[1:13:18] but i'm gonna fire missiles at that
[1:13:20] enemy and say you're gonna hit him
[1:13:22] between the eyes that's pretty hard to
[1:13:24] do david couldn't do that
[1:13:25] brother ram said when david hurled that
[1:13:27] stone and he said that stone took off
[1:13:30] and he said the holy spirit caught that
[1:13:32] stone in midair and guided it right
[1:13:34] caught him right between the eyes oh and
[1:13:36] tell you something friends if you want
[1:13:37] to hit a bull's eye on the devil
[1:13:39] ask the lord to guide it amen amen don't
[1:13:42] try to do it in your own power it's not
[1:13:44] about my own power it's not about how
[1:13:45] great i am it's about how great he
[1:13:47] is you believe it amen
[1:13:51] we find that you know
[1:13:55] the the brother branham had i read this
[1:13:57] quote to you last time about how that
[1:14:00] you know god is going to bring forth a
[1:14:02] bride tree which is the tree of life
[1:14:04] restored back to him as husband and wife
[1:14:06] and the garden of eden how's he going to
[1:14:08] do it by the same word
[1:14:11] and the same god made manifest in
[1:14:13] husband and wife
[1:14:14] catch it the same god
[1:14:18] made manifest in husband and wife
[1:14:21] the same god the same single being
[1:14:25] is going to manifest himself in christ
[1:14:28] the word
[1:14:28] and in the bride amen so do you realize
[1:14:32] that that
[1:14:33] equates you that that equates you to
[1:14:36] this
[1:14:39] that's why brother branham would say put
[1:14:41] this on your lips and it's the same as
[1:14:42] deity speaking
[1:14:43] amen see
[1:14:49] which is a more powerful version
[1:14:52] of the bible this
[1:14:55] ink on paper put together and glued and
[1:14:57] stapled by
[1:14:59] uh a publisher or this word
[1:15:03] living behind skin amen
[1:15:06] brother brahms said when the books are
[1:15:07] closed for the last time there were to
[1:15:10] be flesh
[1:15:11] that's what the devil's afraid of
[1:15:15] amen that's what the devil's afraid of
[1:15:17] he's not afraid of
[1:15:18] ink on paper there's life in this book
[1:15:21] we don't disregard our bibles we love
[1:15:23] our bibles
[1:15:24] and it takes faith in these words in
[1:15:27] this ink on paper it takes faith
[1:15:29] to activate it to make it work but when
[1:15:31] it comes to working it's looking to work
[1:15:33] behind skin
[1:15:34] that's always been god's desire is to
[1:15:37] have his word that was the
[1:15:39] adam didn't have a bible amen you
[1:15:42] understand
[1:15:43] adam didn't have a bible adam didn't
[1:15:46] control nature by saying
[1:15:48] in the name of jesus when stop
[1:15:52] you understand jesus is his name in
[1:15:54] redemption because there's a fault he's
[1:15:56] going to redeem a family
[1:15:57] but but the whole plan of god is god was
[1:16:01] going to have an economy of faith a
[1:16:03] kingdom of faith a kingdom of children
[1:16:05] who would not just quote his word who
[1:16:07] would not just mentally agree with his
[1:16:09] word
[1:16:10] but who would be living manifestations
[1:16:12] of his word
[1:16:14] the word made flesh has always been
[1:16:17] god's plan
[1:16:19] and sacrifices and offerings thou hast
[1:16:21] had no pleasure
[1:16:22] but a body has thou prepared me
[1:16:25] amen jesus didn't even
[1:16:29] carry a bible i'm just making a point
[1:16:33] you understand i'm not not subtracting
[1:16:35] this is this is
[1:16:36] this is our book and this is the book
[1:16:40] faith in the in this book backs down
[1:16:42] devils but you understand that
[1:16:44] that eventually the books will be closed
[1:16:48] hallelujah i want to know that that my
[1:16:51] whole life
[1:16:52] is one one complete unified
[1:16:55] person who has complete faith perfect
[1:16:58] faith
[1:16:59] to take any challenge of the devil you
[1:17:01] say oh oh my the world's been going on
[1:17:03] the world's been going on you know
[1:17:05] it's interesting because in the early
[1:17:07] days of the church and they
[1:17:09] they didn't know brother branham talks
[1:17:10] about that in the church age series
[1:17:13] how that you know god didn't let them
[1:17:14] know that there's going to be would it
[1:17:16] discourage them it's going to be 2 000
[1:17:17] years you know they
[1:17:18] every age has believed in the imminency
[1:17:21] of his coming and
[1:17:22] you even have disciples saying you know
[1:17:24] he he he won't terry and he'll come and
[1:17:26] and he wasn't actually by his standards
[1:17:29] because he was going to come in the last
[1:17:31] days plural the last two days the last 2
[1:17:33] 000 years and he was going to work
[1:17:37] all down through the church ages
[1:17:39] remember in teaching on the book of
[1:17:41] revelation
[1:17:42] that that the bible he's all the time
[1:17:44] saying
[1:17:45] i'm alpha and omega
[1:17:48] and brother branham says notice he
[1:17:50] doesn't mention the middle
[1:17:52] i'm alpha and omega i'm the beginning
[1:17:54] and i'm the ending
[1:17:56] now he is in the midst of his seven
[1:17:58] lamps brother branham even
[1:18:00] even used it he says if you're standing
[1:18:02] in front of all the seven lamps
[1:18:04] and he said if you notice he said when
[1:18:06] he stretches out at his hands
[1:18:07] his hand is touching ephesus and
[1:18:10] laodicea
[1:18:12] well what about the other five in the
[1:18:13] middle he's walking in the midst of his
[1:18:15] lampstands don't
[1:18:16] imagine that he's not in every age but
[1:18:19] the difference
[1:18:20] is that in every age while he's in every
[1:18:23] age
[1:18:23] everything in the age is not him men are
[1:18:26] starting to inject theory and creed and
[1:18:29] man-made opinion and they're starting to
[1:18:31] change the word of god
[1:18:32] but he says i'm alpha when it was
[1:18:34] perfect and i'm i'm omega
[1:18:36] because i'm going to bring it back to
[1:18:37] perfect i'm going to bring back a token
[1:18:40] i'm going to bring back a jubilee i'm
[1:18:41] going to bring back an abstract
[1:18:43] and there's going to be a people just
[1:18:45] like paul stand at the last day
[1:18:48] and conquer this enemy once and for all
[1:18:54] so you are the ones upon whom the ends
[1:18:56] of the world have come
[1:18:57] you are that omega you are that fullness
[1:19:00] and now we find ourselves here
[1:19:03] in a most amazing hour
[1:19:06] unique by many standards
[1:19:11] the the the church you know as it began
[1:19:13] to
[1:19:16] as it began to uh
[1:19:19] as time just kept happening amen
[1:19:22] and time you know the people the people
[1:19:24] had believed they looked for the coming
[1:19:26] of the lord it was going to be any time
[1:19:27] it's going to be any minute
[1:19:29] they met on the first day of every week
[1:19:30] just like we do they went house to house
[1:19:33] they had prayer meetings they
[1:19:34] took the lord's supper they had life
[1:19:38] they understand they they worked jobs
[1:19:41] they paid taxes
[1:19:42] they you know they had families just
[1:19:44] like you and i
[1:19:46] they they had some persecution going on
[1:19:48] but but but we realized that
[1:19:50] that was because in many cases they were
[1:19:53] going to have to give their lives
[1:19:55] whereas the battle there and during
[1:19:58] those bloody times in the ages
[1:20:00] was that they would give their lives but
[1:20:02] brother branham actually says
[1:20:04] in a way in a certain fold that
[1:20:08] it was almost an easy out
[1:20:11] because if life just got too bad and too
[1:20:14] tough and you just want to go to heaven
[1:20:15] so bad
[1:20:16] he said you just step out and go the
[1:20:18] pope is the antichrist and they would
[1:20:20] kill you
[1:20:21] and you could just go quickly and get it
[1:20:23] over with just go okay i just can't tell
[1:20:26] you anymore
[1:20:26] i'm going to go out on the street corner
[1:20:27] and declare that rome is the false
[1:20:29] prophet and the pope is false prophet in
[1:20:31] rome is the beast
[1:20:32] system and and and yeah they might
[1:20:34] torture me
[1:20:35] the rest of the day and half tomorrow
[1:20:36] and then they'll kill me and then i'll
[1:20:37] be in glory
[1:20:39] and brother branham talks about how that
[1:20:41] that that option is not open to us
[1:20:44] any and here we have to strive strive
[1:20:47] daily keep striving keep slogging it out
[1:20:50] and you're in a worse age than them
[1:20:53] you're in a worse age than them you
[1:20:55] you've got the convergence of noah and
[1:20:57] sodom
[1:20:59] you've got the convergence of you know
[1:21:01] you you you've got
[1:21:02] we're we're the time you're at the time
[1:21:04] where all the kings of the earth
[1:21:07] are in our are our uh
[1:21:10] that's a crass way to say it oh i'm not
[1:21:12] going to say it that way
[1:21:13] all kings of the earth are are are
[1:21:16] in the bed chamber with the beast system
[1:21:20] all the captains of the sea are in her
[1:21:22] commerce
[1:21:23] amen so and and so here we are we're so
[1:21:26] outnumbered globally the whole system
[1:21:30] of politics and religion and education
[1:21:33] social
[1:21:33] entertainment everything is oh you're
[1:21:35] swimming upstream friends
[1:21:38] every day of your life you're you're
[1:21:40] constantly having to press press
[1:21:42] press press press you believe it
[1:21:46] and and we find that that now you've got
[1:21:49] the
[1:21:50] the you know you're not we're not
[1:21:51] dealing with a city a little city in the
[1:21:54] plains called sodom
[1:21:56] now we're dealing with sodom
[1:21:59] multiplied globally
[1:22:02] in the highest offices and now every
[1:22:05] system
[1:22:06] from politics to religion to news to
[1:22:09] entertainment
[1:22:10] social values write to the neighbors
[1:22:13] in your neighborhood
[1:22:16] amen who are no doubt nice people but if
[1:22:19] you begin to say here in 2021
[1:22:22] homosexuality is a mortal sin you're
[1:22:24] gonna go to hell for it
[1:22:25] they would go wow aren't you wow you
[1:22:27] shouldn't say that are you
[1:22:29] that's so politically incorrect you need
[1:22:31] to be more accepting
[1:22:34] i'm accepting of of god's word
[1:22:38] i'm against no man
[1:22:41] i'm against the devil and i'm for god
[1:22:45] and however that makes the chips fall
[1:22:47] the chips fall
[1:22:48] but i'm here to defend the name of god
[1:22:51] i'm here to defend his honor
[1:22:52] and so we find that that you've got the
[1:22:55] days of noah you know what the days of
[1:22:57] noah were
[1:22:58] that every man's mind
[1:23:01] over the whole world was
[1:23:04] evil continually
[1:23:08] that means that 24 7 365
[1:23:13] all the population was evil now you've
[1:23:16] got
[1:23:16] that increased sodom increased
[1:23:20] all the kings and captains of the earth
[1:23:22] increased and it's all converged in this
[1:23:25] last day
[1:23:26] but he's promised i'm coming back with
[1:23:28] an omega
[1:23:29] i'm coming back and you're you're
[1:23:30] talking about outnumbered you might feel
[1:23:32] outnumbered friends
[1:23:33] you're you're you know when the early
[1:23:35] church when they didn't see it
[1:23:37] happening it looked to them like
[1:23:39] nothing's happening
[1:23:40] and so much that the apostles have to
[1:23:42] start preaching
[1:23:44] hey hey come on earnestly contend for
[1:23:46] the faith come on y'all
[1:23:48] we need to earn it stop slipping you're
[1:23:49] starting to slip you know earnestly
[1:23:51] contend for the faith can you imagine
[1:23:53] what pastors had to put up with
[1:23:55] when all the last when the last
[1:23:56] disciples and apostles were gone
[1:23:59] and those grievous wolves started coming
[1:24:01] in can you imagine
[1:24:02] loyal pastors pounding it away in the
[1:24:04] pulpit come on saints you know that's
[1:24:06] not what paul taught us
[1:24:08] come on friends that's not what peter
[1:24:10] preached on the day of pentecost you got
[1:24:11] to have a real new birth
[1:24:13] and and slowly and slowly and slowly you
[1:24:15] know that beast system took it all over
[1:24:17] and you're here now in satan's eden he's
[1:24:21] the god of this age
[1:24:22] it's over spread the whole world the
[1:24:25] convergence of every possible bad thing
[1:24:27] that could ever happen
[1:24:28] is now upon us you better have a battle
[1:24:31] plan
[1:24:32] you better be ready you better have some
[1:24:34] armor on
[1:24:35] hallelujah amen
[1:24:38] amen
[1:24:42] because this is where we have arrived
[1:24:46] we find that you know we we can feel
[1:24:49] like and i gotta
[1:24:49] close and i'm trying to close in seven
[1:24:51] minutes
[1:24:53] once brother dig says don't get scared
[1:24:54] i'm fitting the clothes
[1:24:57] and then he'll preach another hour
[1:25:00] i'm not going to do that
[1:25:04] so we we can find that
[1:25:07] it's almost as if there's been this long
[1:25:11] very long um
[1:25:14] not a pause but a really long space of
[1:25:18] time many decades
[1:25:20] since a prophet opens the seals
[1:25:23] 1963 on penn street here in a little
[1:25:27] podunk town still pretty much that
[1:25:30] and and and one of the greatest events
[1:25:34] the one of the greatest bible events
[1:25:37] that was that was ever going to happen
[1:25:40] for god's family the opening of the
[1:25:43] seven seals
[1:25:45] 2 000 years in the making
[1:25:48] ever since the church fell away and
[1:25:50] christ has to sit back down seals the
[1:25:52] word up
[1:25:53] intercedes on behalf of ignorance for
[1:25:55] seven church ages
[1:25:57] comes to the end and now he's gonna
[1:25:58] break it open
[1:26:00] and he's gonna bring back the he's gonna
[1:26:02] make the mighty god
[1:26:04] it's gonna be unveiled amen
[1:26:08] and when he unveils when when he has the
[1:26:10] unveiling of god
[1:26:12] suddenly we realize oh wow we already
[1:26:15] knew he wasn't three but
[1:26:17] now we we realize why the oneness were
[1:26:19] wrong
[1:26:20] because now we see his body is included
[1:26:24] we see that his body is included brother
[1:26:27] brown talks about how that when you're
[1:26:28] born in the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:26:30] you're brought into the very deity of
[1:26:32] jesus christ amen
[1:26:35] that you're part of god's godhead this
[1:26:38] is his economy this is the kingdom he's
[1:26:39] been trying to build
[1:26:41] and it looks like wow there's been such
[1:26:43] a long time
[1:26:45] you know that it it it it seems like
[1:26:48] from the time of the shout
[1:26:50] you know to the time when the trumpet
[1:26:52] sounds and we're going to have a
[1:26:53] resurrection of the saints and
[1:26:55] you know it just seems like a lot of
[1:26:57] things have had to happen and here we're
[1:26:59] we're still here but it's been necessary
[1:27:02] amen first of all all those names had to
[1:27:05] be caughty
[1:27:06] we can't leave here without that last
[1:27:08] name on the lamb's book of life
[1:27:10] amen i mean the bride has been
[1:27:13] has been has been being fit to the word
[1:27:16] not the other way around
[1:27:18] the word was never going to change the
[1:27:19] bride had to be fit to it
[1:27:21] she had to be she had to grow across
[1:27:24] these decades the bride
[1:27:25] has had to grow into her position as the
[1:27:28] final voice to the final age
[1:27:30] and you know something i mean let me
[1:27:32] just throw this out here this might seem
[1:27:33] like a
[1:27:34] almost like a an awkward elephant in the
[1:27:36] room but i'm just gonna say it the way
[1:27:37] it feels on my heart
[1:27:39] you know all these decades since
[1:27:42] even before prophet left we had people
[1:27:45] you know having other little camps and
[1:27:47] other little ideas even when a prophet
[1:27:48] was there and the prophets got to go
[1:27:49] take trips and rebuke them and change
[1:27:51] them and
[1:27:51] calm them down and you know and he keeps
[1:27:53] calling he said they're my children
[1:27:55] you know and and you had men
[1:27:58] misunderstanding who the prophet was
[1:28:00] what the word was what it was to do
[1:28:02] they misunderstood the seals they
[1:28:03] misunderstood marriage and divorce they
[1:28:05] they're doing things wrong and brother
[1:28:06] brandon's having to try to fix it and
[1:28:08] and they're saying oh mercy's over
[1:28:09] brother brennan should we quit our jobs
[1:28:12] or should should we still should we
[1:28:14] still work and brother brown said
[1:28:16] well the only one that will work as a
[1:28:17] christian man of course
[1:28:19] he said good grief y'all don't have i
[1:28:21] not brother branham even felt like
[1:28:24] he was responsible yeah he said my
[1:28:26] goodness
[1:28:27] how could you come up with that of
[1:28:29] course there's still mercy
[1:28:30] of course you should still keep your
[1:28:32] jobs brother branham should we he's
[1:28:34] getting letters and getting phone calls
[1:28:36] brother branham
[1:28:36] should we meet under under the bridge
[1:28:39] what
[1:28:41] yeah i heard i heard there's a man in
[1:28:43] his yard we heard the
[1:28:44] it was the rapture was happening and
[1:28:46] brother brown said sir you you
[1:28:48] you've got me confused i don't know what
[1:28:50] you're talking about
[1:28:53] but yet we find that god
[1:28:57] has family members sometimes who get a
[1:29:00] little confused
[1:29:02] amen those disciples all ran for the
[1:29:04] hills in the garden of gethsemane they
[1:29:06] all lost their mind
[1:29:08] it took a little while for them to come
[1:29:10] back around and
[1:29:12] peter thought he had he'd sealed his
[1:29:14] doom i i i love that statement
[1:29:16] i heard some years ago brother paula
[1:29:17] fontaine may he's talking about those
[1:29:19] disciples
[1:29:20] you know fled and and and lost their
[1:29:22] mind and then had to come back around he
[1:29:24] said you know something friends
[1:29:25] let's just admit this it said this thing
[1:29:27] ain't over yet
[1:29:29] come on could we have that attitude this
[1:29:31] thing ain't over yet
[1:29:32] rather than condemning the rest of the
[1:29:34] world who maybe don't agree with it
[1:29:36] exactly like us
[1:29:37] why don't we make our calling and
[1:29:38] election sure put on the whole armor
[1:29:41] stay in prayer and let's just be the
[1:29:43] right example
[1:29:46] amen i don't i don't believe
[1:29:50] and in fact as i i know for sure
[1:29:53] there there are groups within the
[1:29:55] message
[1:29:56] that love this message love god's
[1:29:58] prophet and
[1:29:59] and and i don't exactly agree with their
[1:30:01] position
[1:30:02] they don't exactly agree with mine but
[1:30:05] you know
[1:30:06] get around them sometime talk to them
[1:30:07] you know what you'll find out
[1:30:09] they love this message as much as you do
[1:30:11] they love a prophet as much as you do
[1:30:13] they in fact is they think you don't
[1:30:15] love it quite enough and
[1:30:17] and i just say okay there's this group
[1:30:18] and there's that group and i understand
[1:30:20] we're going to have fanaticism
[1:30:22] my point is that jesus you know it i i
[1:30:25] that's what i love that scene i i play
[1:30:27] it over and over where jesus is standing
[1:30:29] there to his fishermen
[1:30:30] in in in the uh in in that uh chosen one
[1:30:34] of the greatest
[1:30:34] most epic jesus stories bar none
[1:30:38] running away the second next competitor
[1:30:41] is miles behind it the greatest
[1:30:43] jesus story i've ever encountered and
[1:30:46] he's standing there
[1:30:48] and he's mad he's filled up their boat
[1:30:50] to where it's sinking with fish and
[1:30:51] peter's falling on his knees and
[1:30:53] go away from me i'm a sinful man and
[1:30:55] jesus invites him to follow him
[1:30:58] a sinful man a failure and jesus says
[1:31:00] follow me
[1:31:03] and later when he calls matthew they
[1:31:05] can't believe it do you understand what
[1:31:06] he hits guy's a traitor
[1:31:09] he's taxing us and cheating us he works
[1:31:13] for rome
[1:31:15] and and yet this is and jesus tells him
[1:31:17] he says
[1:31:18] he says i'm gonna make you fishers of
[1:31:21] men
[1:31:22] fishers of men and he makes the
[1:31:24] statement he says i want you to go
[1:31:26] and he says i want you to bring all
[1:31:29] kinds in
[1:31:30] bring go to go to everything catch
[1:31:34] everything you can and he says i'll
[1:31:37] separate them later
[1:31:40] i just about start screaming every time
[1:31:42] he says that
[1:31:44] says go catch them go find them bring
[1:31:46] them in get all kinds i'll separate them
[1:31:48] later i don't need you to do it i just
[1:31:49] need you to catch them
[1:31:51] i'll send forth my angels and that's the
[1:31:53] ministry of the last day
[1:31:54] but we're not separating them based on
[1:31:56] our theory we're just preaching the word
[1:31:58] of god
[1:31:58] and the word of god people who can't
[1:32:00] take it run away from it
[1:32:02] but i'm here to tell you something
[1:32:03] friends we got we might be splittered
[1:32:05] here and splintered there in this group
[1:32:06] here in this group there
[1:32:07] but i'm here to tell you it's not going
[1:32:09] to be a misunderstood doctrine that's
[1:32:12] gonna
[1:32:12] you're never gonna keep somebody whose
[1:32:16] name is on the lamb's book of life i
[1:32:18] don't care what the condition of their
[1:32:20] life is
[1:32:20] or the condition of their teaching is
[1:32:22] they're gonna be there
[1:32:23] there's not gonna be one empty chair at
[1:32:26] the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:32:29] how about we just have the love of god
[1:32:31] and just keep preaching it and keep
[1:32:33] living it and keep loving and keep
[1:32:35] letting god
[1:32:36] sort out his family this is our battle
[1:32:40] plan the king
[1:32:41] is coming we need to be an array we need
[1:32:44] to be ready we need to choose
[1:32:46] who am i in the david story
[1:32:50] who am i choose friends
[1:32:53] choose who you want to be are you going
[1:32:56] to be the backslid
[1:32:57] son of god in the tent the king
[1:33:02] you're going to be the backslid preacher
[1:33:04] have ain't got enough courage to put his
[1:33:06] armor on anymore
[1:33:08] you're gonna be the the family who saw
[1:33:12] the
[1:33:13] miracles of god and then try to try to
[1:33:15] turn around and attack it
[1:33:18] you're gonna be goliath
[1:33:22] got to be in the army i got one man i
[1:33:24] want to be like david
[1:33:27] there's an anointing came on david
[1:33:31] david prophesied when he got out in that
[1:33:34] field now
[1:33:35] catch it he didn't he didn't prophesy
[1:33:38] until he went to war and when he went to
[1:33:42] war
[1:33:43] and actually armed himself with his
[1:33:44] slingshot the the
[1:33:46] the war tribe the you know the the the
[1:33:48] war room we've already figured it out
[1:33:50] the king wants me to go in his arm i
[1:33:51] ain't gonna do it take my own
[1:33:53] okay go i've already went past my
[1:33:55] brothers i don't care what they say
[1:33:57] i know everybody's afraid but i'm gonna
[1:33:59] go facing
[1:34:02] he gets five smooth stones takes his
[1:34:03] sling and heads to heads to the field of
[1:34:05] battle
[1:34:07] and when that giant makes his boast
[1:34:09] against david an anointing falls on
[1:34:11] david and david starts prophesying
[1:34:14] now there's two prophecies going forward
[1:34:16] one from
[1:34:17] one from christ and one from antichrist
[1:34:20] and they're both pretty much saying the
[1:34:22] same thing i'm going to take your head
[1:34:23] off and feed it to the fouls of the air
[1:34:26] and david said you know it's not that
[1:34:29] david had
[1:34:30] bigger more brave sounding words than
[1:34:33] goliath
[1:34:34] but david had a secret and here's what
[1:34:37] goliath was missing
[1:34:39] this cost him his life david said
[1:34:44] your boast is because of your shield and
[1:34:46] sword
[1:34:47] you're coming at me with your shield and
[1:34:49] your sword and your spear
[1:34:51] but i'm coming at you in the name of the
[1:34:54] lord
[1:34:55] that's the difference goliath i'm not i
[1:34:58] got a slingshot i'm not even trusting in
[1:35:00] the slingshot i'm coming to you
[1:35:02] in the name of the lord god that's that
[1:35:05] was the difference and that made
[1:35:07] david victorious and goliath got a
[1:35:10] uh let's say a rude awakening he went to
[1:35:12] sleep never woke up
[1:35:16] that's what it takes friends that's what
[1:35:18] it takes it doesn't matter i i
[1:35:20] understand how the devil
[1:35:21] can come into our lives disrupt our home
[1:35:24] challenge you
[1:35:25] challenge you for your family amen i
[1:35:29] i had a a wonderful uh
[1:35:32] conversation a sister sent me

[1:35:38] praying for her children
[1:35:40] pray i tell you we need more mommies
[1:35:42] like that praying and it's it's the
[1:35:44] burden of her heart that all of her kids
[1:35:46] make it
[1:35:46] i can tell you that was sister debbie's
[1:35:48] burden nothing mattered didn't matter
[1:35:50] as long as all of her kids made it in
[1:35:53] and and mothers praying that prayer
[1:35:55] and and and she gave me a testimony here
[1:35:57] here i had a testimony of getting up at
