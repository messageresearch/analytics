TRANSCRIPT
========================================
us lord giving us understanding and revelation lord helping us to grow in our walk with you lord i just pray that you would be with us this morning i just rebuked satan in the name of jesus christ all the trouble that the devil's trying to give give to us this morning we we just resist him and come against him we father we know that you have a great plan for us today and you're going to do something marvelous we see all the resistance from the enemy so we know that there's a great purpose going on lord and i know you're going to overcome it we we ask your anointing upon speaker and hearer in jesus name amen god bless you we're going to continue on the subject of the fruit of the spirit in the last days if you can bring up my powerpoint that'd be great first but we're going to look at uh this is part three so we're going to look at ephesians 4 11-13 we'll read that and then you can be seated and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god and to a perfect man under the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ amen may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word he can be seated brother brad i'm a little hot in the monitors if you turn it down just a little bit or no no control all right all right so untold trials on the booth and with sound and camera and everything else so just keep everybody in prayer and that's why that's why i'm rebuking the enemy he's been fast at work but we're going to overcome him amen so let's go let's go back to the second screen there verse 11. all familiar with this this scripture here it's the fivefold ministry these are or you could call it the ascension gifts ministry christ ascended and then gave gifts unto men and he gave some apostles prophets evangelist pastors and teachers all right for the perfecting of the saints this word perfecting is a different word than you see in verse 13 perfect man the word perfecting there isn't speaking of maturity it's speaking of equipping so in other words it's like it's providing the uh uniform like if you're if you're thinking of the military it's providing a uniform for the military in this case it's dressing the bride with the equipment she needs to overcome which of course the ministry is not doing that of their own strength their own power of their own self it's christ's ascension gifts ministry it's not the person is not a gift it's christ to his church working and operating through a human vessel to equip the saints for what purpose verse let's go back to verse 12. i'm not controlling it up here so if you don't mind going back to verse yeah for the for the equipping of the saints for the work of the ministry so so the the five-fold ministry is equipping the the believers the bride for the work of the ministry so we call the five-fold ministry but their work they're ministering for the church to be able to have their ministry see so there that's that's the balance there we're equipping the people we're not perfecting the people brother branham says the the blood perfects the bride right so and it's the bleeding bloody word those two things are connect connected together and yet we understand it's not the pastor perfecting the people it's not the prophet not the apostle it's christ perfecting the people but this is not speaking of perfecting in that sense in the sense that we're talking about usually when you see the word perfect in the new testament it's speaking about maturity growing to maturity to full age that's not this word it's different it's equipping dressing making ready preparation so that they can have they can fulfill their work of the ministry because we understand the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man every believer to profit with all for the common good so the gifts of the spirit are divided by the spirit to every believer the way he he wills for that to happen and so through that ministry the body of christ is edified edified it's not just for the preacher to edify the body it's all of us all of us it's every joint supplies something every member of the body again it's a mistake to look at these scriptures and approach it the way brother banham rebuked it in the church ages book what did he say in the church ages book the best we can see is a few anointed ministers and the people just sit there and try to take it in that's not what this verse is talking about he says it's a far cry from what the apostle paul said in order which was all participated in spiritual worship so that's what this verse is actually saying directly what what the prophet is telling us in the church ages book so all of us together participate in this ministry five-fold ministry is a part of it the body ministry is a part of it verse 13 says till until so this purpose it's there's a purpose for this equipping of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ it's till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god there's that word unto a perfect man a mature a fully grown man under the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ so this is a growing process and it starts he sends the ministry of the word that ministry of word equips the saints for the work of the ministry for the building up of the body of christ and then as we're built up by the restored and revealed word for our day then we can come to the unity of the faith the knowledge of the son of god unto a mature man but the perfecting is not on the preachers the perfecting is on the work of christ and the blood of christ and the work in the body as a whole we can't just put it out on a portion of the body it's the whole body has a part of that the anointed ones at the end time next screen no wonder they couldn't see him no man come to me except my father draws him and all the father has given me in the roots will come to me see you get it oh how we should love him adore and praise him to see the fruit of the spirit in the last days and the bride tree ripening ripening in the top of the time so that's that's the hour we're living in we're we're to be ripening ephesians 4 11-13 that is god's purpose to ripen us what is ripening you come to maturity that's what this is that's what this is about that's what the message is sent if the holy if the holy spirit is working in your life what is it what is the holy spirit doing bringing you to to maturity all at different stages of course but we're all reaching one stage which is being made ready for the rapture ephesians 1 22 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all so the body is the fullness of him that filleth all in all that's just another that's like a title for god who's the who's the one that feels all in all god so the body is the fullness of god when's the last time you heard that preached in the denominational church they've got no understanding they've got no concept of that brother branham came and he's teaching it of course it was foreign to us it was it seemed crazy but here he is and christ is the mystery of god revealed god's only provided place of worship says the fullness of the godhead bodily is in the bride wow what a statement what a revelation but it's right there in scripture plain as day next screen christ is the mystery of god revealed when i think of it i just see denominations pass off the scene and everything else just going see when i see god's great purpose revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in christ the fullness of the goded bodily and then to bring that fullness of godhead bodily into a people that he could have the preeminence the oversight the leading that's what he's doing that's what he's doing today that's why we're still here that's why he's working in your life he's bringing the preeminence because you you and i together have to be the expression of the fullness of the godhead bodily not us as individuals us as individuals together in a body will do it christ is the mystery of god revealed now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church the preeminences all that god was he poured into christ oh that christ all christ was was poured into the church the believers beautiful all right next screen and then the screen after that yes hebrews 5 11 of whom we have many things to say so this is speaking about melchizedek of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing you are dull of hearing for when the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness free is a babe but strong meat belongs to them that are full of full age that's that same word where it said a perfect man in ephesians same word a full age them that are perfect is another way to say that them at a full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil i find it astonishing in in this that paul is telling them i have a lot more to tell you about melchizedek but you can't understand it right now right but then he goes on and and he lays the foundation so remember the message is restoring it's not bringing something new and yet there's something laid there that paul puts in you'd say in mystery form about melchizedek that everyone probed at tried to understand but it took the opening of the seven seals for the real truth of who melchizedek was and how that relates to us to be revealed and so it had to come in the hour of full age so don't miss that connection it's the revealing of the word right in full age that's going to produce full age right so we're in the fullness of time in the church ages so you and i we need to come to the fullness of the word the fullness of the understanding of who melchizedek is and how that applies to us and we have it we have it lord just continue to reveal it to us hebrews 6 1 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on into perfection that can be a little confusing they're leaving the principles so it's like oh yeah we have those principles but forget them we don't need those anymore or that's you know that we need the foundational principles we never leave off completely repentance from dead works faith towards god baptism etc etc don't leave that off because people have to get saved and come through that process and yet if that's where we're stuck like all the denominations and so forth we're just stuck there we can't go on to perfection we can't go on to maturity if we don't have the foundation we can't go on to maturity either so don't get it out of place we must have the foundation and we have to continue on once that foundation is laid if you're just stuck there forever you can't grow and be made ready for a rapture of the doctrine of baptism oh i never even finished reading that verse let us go on into perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith towards god of the doctrine of baptism and of laying out of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment and this will we do if god permit god did not permit them in that age to go on to perfection why the apostles passed away and they began to make their slow descent falling away from the original faith but in this day we're making a slow descent on the other direction we're making a slow a slow not descent ascent using the right word is important a slow ascent to perfection to be ready for the rapture in the stature of a perfect man brother branham says you get it these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection and they're they're under souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to its perfection that when christ does come all right philippians 3 7. looking where i'm at for time i've got 14 slides left i'm pretty sure i won't get through them but we'll do our best but what things were gained to me those i counted but lost for christ yea doubtless and i count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ so when i'm seeing these verses i'm starting to see paul saying there's a process going on there there's something that i'm reaching forward to that i'm going that i'm growing into it's not a matter of i got filled with the holy ghost it's over with for paul i got filled with the holy ghost my life has changed but there's something that i have to grow into there's something that i have to win there's a race that i have to run verse nine and be beef and being found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousnesses which is of god by faith that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death well paul you received the holy ghost don't you already know him right yes but he's saying there's more that i may know him and the power of his resurrection so this is something to understand when you're looking at being made ready for the rapture this isn't just about knowledge about things this isn't just about personal growth right this is about knowing him knowing christ in the power of his resurrections and resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering being made conformable to his death so we our our goal is not necessarily our personal growth our goal is actually a person right that's what we're looking at that's who we're looking at that's who we're looking forward to seeing verse 11 if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead why it's a it's a strange statement here paul is a christian he's desiring to attain like achieve as a goal the resurrection of the dead if you look at the weast expanded translation of the greek it says if by any means i might arrive at the goal namely the out resurrection from among those who are dead so clearly he's referring to something different than the general resurrection everyone's going to be in the general resurrection whether you're whether you're saved or lost but there's some people that are going to be in an out resurrection so there there's there's going to be a special and we understand this clearly it's the rapture that's what he's talking about and he's saying i want to arrive at this goal my goodness let that sink in for a second there's a goal that we want to arrive at that we want to move towards that paul says that i want to attain so again don't get it out of order can you can you earn it by your good works of course not you can't earn it by your good works no what is it though it's a outworking when you have faith without works is dead when you have faith true revealed faith i'm not just talking about human faith or faith that denominations have i'm saying true revealed faith that's come to you as a gift of god into your heart to see all that christ is in this day then when what's going to happen it can't not happen is you grow god is changing you god is transforming you and so the goal that we achieve and obtain is him working in us there's there's more scriptures that i want to look at and i will definitely not get to today but it says work out your own salvation with fear and trembling i can't but he says work it out with fear and trembling because it is god working in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure so we put our efforts we put our strength we put our whole being into it because god is working in us what if god isn't working in you then you won't put your whole being you won't put your whole heart you won't put your whole strength into it see when god is in you it produces something in you i mean really in you in the soul not just an anointing on the flesh not just a feeling and emotion but something that's anchored in your soul it produces a life philippians 3 12 not as though oh my i had already attained not as though i had already made acquisition either were already perfect fully mature but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i'm apprehended of christ jesus i love the west expanded translation now that not that i'd already made acquisition or that i have now already been brought to that place of absolute spiritual maturity beyond which there is no progress but i am pursuing onward if i may lay hold of that for which i have been laid hold of by christ jesus so why did he lay hold of us why did he reach down and choose us and pull us out of this muck and mire and filth and sin of this world just so you could be saved and live by ever like everybody else no he reached down to pull you so that you would grow to this place of absolute maturity where it's christ in you fully revealed fully manifested in perfection in your life that's why he laid hold upon you that's why he chose you that's why he called you that's why he justified you is so that you can be remade in the perfect image of jesus christ verse 13 brethren i count not myself to apprehended or laid hold of but this one thing i do and this is our challenge right now today this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind the past past revivals past achievements past wonderful things that have happened forgetting those things now we always remember the blessing i always remember having kovid and i always remember god delivering me from that in a mighty with a mighty outstretched arm i'll always remember that that's not what it's saying what it's saying is don't just rely on past things past revivals past achievements past successes you got to keep going forward you got to keep pressing there's a race that you got to run and it's not over until this body is changed and we have to reach forth reach forth reaching forth is like stretching forth the neck in other words when you're running a race and there's a finish line there you're sprinting and you don't just i'm just gonna jog through it i mean you are sprinting and you lean forward to break that tape so that you win and he says i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling or it's actually literally means the upward call of god in christ jesus so what is he saying let's break it down he's saying i am running forward stretching forth my neck pressing forward sprinting as fast as i can towards the rapture why why would he say that why just sit in church and come to church and and then millions of people are going to be raptured now paul is saying i'm pressing i'm pushing forward i'm getting more like christ i'm feeding more on the word i'm i have my own revival personal revival whether no one else has it but i have my own personal revival that i'm running towards running forward pressing fighting putting all my exertion all my sweat all my blood all my tears into what achieving the rapture and i know i can never achieve it i know it's the grace of god but it's the grace of god working in me paul said i he he's comparing himself with the other apostles and he said i work harder i did more than all of them yet well it wasn't me it was the grace of god that was in me and let that be our statement we know our works cannot achieve anything our works cannot change anything but his work in us i believe will bring us to this place of what i'm talking about today you don't have to put your effort into it you just have to surrender to the working of the holy spirit and he'll push you forward amen let's stand and pray heavenly father we just come before you now lord and we ask that your holy spirit would have your way in us lord bless the the worship bless the preaching of the word lord may our hearts be ready and under expectation and anticipation of what you're going to do today lord we just now want to stand together and rebuke the enemy in the name of jesus christ lord may everything be set in order lord may our hearts and minds be able to be focused completely on the word and and on you today we ask in jesus name amen
