so uh this song has a special meaning to it for me uh couple months ago uh my pastor said something that uh really struck me and it really touched me it uh he said that we're not fighting for victory but rather we're fighting from a position of Victory and I just think that's so powerful to know we know it's already won and we can fight knowing that so uh I wrote this song uh in light of [Music] that I go to war and every day the battles are in my mind and I fight so hard but too much on my plates when the battle was never [Music] mind and the devil he tells me that you've got to fight so so hard cuz there is a chance that I'm lose Lo but the word tells me there's nothing to fear you have already won already won when you choose [Music] him I'm not fighting for victory cuz victory's already [Music] won I'm not fighting for victory cuz victory's already [Music] won already won and I have a God who king of all Kings my savior is second to none and I don't have to worry about finding a place I'm identified with the sun and sure I'll have strugles that won't go away it's just a part of this old skin of mine but I have a Jesus who's got power in his name who's bestowed me with Grace Divine I'm not fighting for victory cuz victory's already won I'm not fighting for victory cuz victory's already won [Music] oh all already [Music] won asking it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and it will be open to you victories already mine believe it receive it the devil has no Authority no sickness no worry God's already given me victory believe it receive it the devil has no Authority no sickness no worry God's already giving me Victory oh oh I'm not fighting for victory cuz Victory is already B I'm not fighting for victory cuz victory's already [Applause] won
