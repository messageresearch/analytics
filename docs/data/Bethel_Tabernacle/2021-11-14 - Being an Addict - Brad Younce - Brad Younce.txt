i got i'll have some more in that same chapter romans chapter 6 verse 19 you'll probably wonder about this scripture when you hear the title i don't do things i do i do strange things anyway when i put my scriptures up i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness may god add a blessing as you can have your seats for the title it's being an addict yeah we're going to be addicted to something you're either going to be addicted to the things of the world or you're going to be addicted to things of god the definition for an addict is a person who is addicted to an activity a half habit or a substance to become dependent on an addictive substance as an alcoholic or a narcotic to something compulsively or obsessively a fanatic a follower a junkie i'm here to tell you this morning i'm a fanatic for christ you go to these ball games and you see these people they go crazy when their team scores i was at a a restaurant last night and some football game on there and some person up and uh jumping up and screaming you're kind of like wow wish you was in church what would you do if you was a fanatic for jesus christ how's it gonna make you feel and act you know you know don't get me wrong when i say this but i'm a junkie i'm a junkie for jesus christ a junkie is obsessive dependence on something if i'm going to be a junkie i'm going to it's going to be for him i'm dependent on jesus christ i'm dependent on his healing i need his healing i'm dependent on his joy because i'm a junkie for jesus christ amen you know i need him every hour that's my addiction i'm addicted to jesus christ addiction is a thirst it's a longing for something something you have to have you can't go without it you need it that is being addicted in romans 6 12 it says let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body which is to be king to exercise kingly power to reign to exercise the highest influence to control a desire a craving a longing how many has a longing for jesus this morning neither yield your members has instruments of unrighteousness we have done that unrighteous unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members has instruments of righteousness unto god for sin shall not have dominion over you which is exercise lordship to be the lord of to be king over to rule to have dominion over you supreme rulers sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace hallelujah to that and i speak in verse 19 i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your member servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness we used to be addicted to this world these fingers at once used to smoke cigarettes these fingers that held alcohol or these fingers that done stuff on the internet you shouldn't have it's addicted to the world they're used now they're used for good now we can raise our hands these same these nicotine same fingers these things of the world we can actually raise these hands now because we're addicted to the right thing and still you're yielding our members to service to the devil we change changed yielding our members to servants of god taking your hands like i said it used to do wrong now they're used for good amen in 6 22 and now being made free from sin you become servants to god you have your fruit unto holiness and to everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord you know they had these rehab places you know aaa and they have these drug drug rehabs they'll put you in there say six months they take that thing away from you if it's alcohol they won't let you have alcohol and they'll think you're cured but you'll leave that place and you're still addicted to it i've seen a sign out here coming into beaufort it says i am my i am not my addiction i kind of disagree with that and you know where they're coming from but you are your addiction if you're alcoholic that's your addiction that's who you are but if you're jesus christ you're addicted to him that's who you are so amen to that you know you just got to let them to christ christ is how you overcome your addiction you we have a place you could come to we're not going to lock you up for six months it only takes one minute in the presence of god to overcome the addiction of this world you know you have not been to be addicted to cigarettes or alcohol i'm sorry you might not be but you could be addicted to shopping you could be addicted to hunting and golfing and all the things of the world not saying those things are wrong but we can become so addicted to it that we forget this addiction we forget the word addiction a heart that harbors addiction you got to get to get to the cause and the cause is the devil you have to understand who the devil is you got to understand he's the one that's causing all the addiction let me read this little quote here i love his quote and i'll read it several times overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks a lot of people said there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's the devil he's against you and then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him recognize who your enemy is this morning oh that's what satan's greatest triumph is get you to recognize we don't we don't know who the devil is we don't recognize you recognize who he is though you feel his effects you know what he what he does to you he'll have you addicted to things of this world but i've seen the effects of god on what on the people of or people of god what the effects of god will make you do it'll make you happy it'll give you joy it'll give you peace are you addicted this morning hallelujah addictions are a serious problem it's a very serious problem of the world i've got a serious problem this board i'm addicted to jesus christ i'm addicted to love i'm addicted to peace i'm even addicted to going to church i'm addicted to the holy ghost i love the way it makes me feel when the holy ghost comes oh you got the joy of jesus christ inside your heart you got the longing for this word let's do a little word test on us this morning let's see let's see what you're addicted to let's see if you're addicted to the word of god the word should become a necessity a basic necessity of your living it's like it's like getting up eating breakfast and drinking a cup of coffee or your water you need that you need this more you need coffee we need this but we need water we let's let's find out if you have the symptoms let's see if you have symptoms this morning here's the word test to see if you're addicted put whatever your addiction is into this right here you will always be thinking about it the word you will try to get to know all about it the word you will find out where you where you can get it the word the right stuff amen you get the word anywhere but excuse the right word you will always find a way to indulge in it hallelujah whenever possible you know how it is when you get there you got to have that cigarette you got to go get it this is the way we should be with the word you will never stay away from it no matter what others say you would have you would have made it a habit in your life how many wants a habit that habit you will miss it if you don't get it you know how you get i've got to have this alcohol where's it at i got i miss it already i ain't had it since this morning you could never stop letting it influence you don't let this word ever stop influencing you hallelujah you will share it with your friends brother jd you'll share it won't we you'll share it with your friends you will always lean on it for comfort when you are stressed out [Laughter] that's the word test as a child of god do you have those symptoms do we have those symptoms this morning if you don't you're not addicted you just use the word dependent on your need wow it's like a medicine when things go wrong and when you need to solve a problem when you are in a struggle when you need a healing but you're not addicted to it we only want it just for a little bit this will make me feel good just for a moment the only way to check out whether you have withdrawal symptoms there are signs that you show when you do not indulge in what you're addicted to if you would draw yourself in the word you feel guilty i feel guilty if i don't listen to enough tapes or i don't pray enough or read the bible i feel guilty that's a good that's a good sign you're addicted you can't concentrate on your daily tasks or you wait for urgency of the moment when you get in touch with the word if you don't have any withdrawal symptoms from the word this morning it don't make a difference in your life it has to make a difference the bible says your word is a lamp to my feet and a light in my path you can't be without that lamp you can't be without that light in this day it's a dark day we gotta have the light we need this word to survive in this world i'm gonna go a step further we need this world to survive to overcome this world oh mercy that's the basic requirement is the addiction of god word addiction in your life and keep track of your withdrawal systems recognize that you have an addiction if you got the wrong one recognize it's wrong and change it we could change our addictions today there's two different kinds of addictions one in the world we don't know that and a godly one let me skip here a little bit amen first corinthians see if you're addicted to satan and the things of the world jesus is here for you in john 8 8 36 that the son has set you free you are free indeed first corinthians 6 9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived nor fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor infinite nor abuser themselves with mankind nor thieves door covenants nor drunkers nor revelers nor extortioners shall unhurt the kingdom of god these people are addicted they're addicted to the wrong thing paul says and such were some of you but you are washed and are sanctified you are justified in the name of the lord jesus by the spirit of our god all things he says are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient paul's quoting a slogan that the immature corinthians used all things are lawful for me he said if you're quoting this scripture to justify looking like the world here's what paul calls you immature christians all things are not expedient it's not profitable it could be good to control to collect or contribute in order to help hence to help be profitable is it profitable to you he said all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any to have power authority to use your power to be the master of you he says you're not gonna let this be the master of you paul says i will not be brought under the law of under the power of an addiction he's not going to be brought under that power addiction because he that overcome what's edifying you he said all things are lawful to me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me he's trying to say it again but all things edify not it don't build you up he don't restore you it don't promote growth in christian wisdom and health what is edifying you is it the things of the world or is it of god in first peter 2 4 to whom coming as a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious ye also are lively stones and you're built up a spiritual house a holy proof to it to offer up a spiritual sacrifice lively stones is this you this morning to be alive you're quick to live to breathe to be among the living you're not dead it's living water you're alive you're living water this morning if you're addicted to jesus christ this is what you are oh lord and verse in verse 9 peter 2 ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into marvelous light which in times past you were not a people you were not a people in times past but are now the people of god one time you weren't we were just roaming this world nothing but now we are somebody hallelujah about lost my place which had not obtained mercy but now you have mercy hallelujah we didn't have mercy at one time but now we do we have become lively stones we have become living water addiction is a thirst for something you're longing for it god has placed something in you to thirst we have a thirst for this world you can have a thirst for this world or one for god in psalms it says the heart pantheth after the water brooks so pantheth my so after thee o god panith means to long for do you long for it i'm long for it this morning my soul thirsteth for god for the one living god when shall i come and appear before him my soul thirsts for god my soul don't thirst for some dead religion my soul ain't thirsting for muhammad or buddha my soul ain't even thirsting for brother branham there's only one person i'm thirsting for this morning and that's the lord jesus christ there's my addiction like i said i'm addicted to it i hope you can tell i hope you leave this place addicted we could change our addictions right here this morning in john 7 37 in the last day the great day of the feast jesus we know we well familiar with that scripture this was during the feast of the tabernacles jesus was in jerusalem this was the eighth day the eighth day signifying the end of the feast on this day they had the ceremony of drawing and pouring water attending the usual rejoicings as on others days at which time there was great rejoicing piping dancing and this ceremony they say is a tradition of moses from mount sinai and refers to some secret and mysterious things yea they plainly say that it has respect to the pouring forth of the holy ghost they draw the holy ghost isaiah 12 3 therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation now this is referring to jesus when he is when he is the water that we drink he is the one our soul longeth for he's the one that we need to be addicted to and john back in john 37 saint 73 in the last days the great day of the feast jesus stood up and cried most times he'll sit down and teach the people but this got a hold of him he stood up and cried this out saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink this word right here to suffer a thirst those who say to thirst painfully feel their want of eagerly long for these things by which the soul is refreshed to support his strength jesus is saying who is thirsty who wants it so bad it hurts i want it so bad it's hurting i long for god let him come to me and drink you have courage he's encouraging you this morning to come up here and drink to take of the water of life freely or take of his grace freely salvation by him is free you know costs that's nothing just surrendered heart and the pardon of sin according to the riches of grace and justification is freely by his grace so all other blessings and this that they may drink abundantly that they may partake of it largely there is a fullness of grace in christ there is abundance of it that give it to his people it's exceeding abundant he's not going to run out brother brown said that blessed holy thirst that god gave you to thirst after him you've perverted into things of the world and craving for the things of this world that's tough right there john 6 35 and jesus said unto him i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst we eat this bread it's like it's like bread in restaurants my wife fix bread i love it you kind of say i'm addicted to it i'm addicted to bread i'm also addicted to the bread of life he's living down on the inside we love it he's your bread he's your water it's a woman at the well we know what her addiction was she's addicted too many husbands [Laughter] she comes as a whale and jesus asked her for a drink you know how the story ended she changed her addiction because jesus said whosoever drinketh of this water shall never thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that i give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of springing how many got that whale up until everlasting life and the woman said sir give me that water i'm saying the same thing sir give me that water brother i said thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith that he give me a drink thou would has asked of him and he would have given the living water when whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up unto everlasting life that same living water is mentioned but this time it's not called a river it's called an artesian well that's where people make their mistakes because it's called a well it's called a well and a river and they think that in one place it is eternal life given by the spirit and the next place when it's called by a river implying a great dianism it has to be the spirit now given has an endowment of power we go so many places with that but i won't it's the endowment of power it's one and the same but it's a spirit that gives life and power that came at pentecost okay i barely could not do that but jesus says he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water out of your inner most being will flow rivers of living water what are you thirsting for drink from jesus christ that out of you shall flow jesus christ hallelujah nothing but the spirit of god the holy ghost is flowing out of you hallelujah man skip a little bit and when we receive the holy ghost it'll make you do the same things that it did at the jews at the end of that feast you'll shout you'll rejoice we won't sit around feeling sorry for ourselves with this world in such a turmoil hallelujah the believer upon drinking by coming unto jesus in faith would have rivers of living water pouring out of him you'll have so much water pulling out of you it'll flow onto your sister beside you the brother beside of you everybody's going to be wet with the holy ghost we're being addicted by by god i'm about i'm about finished here i'm going to run out of time barrett said they refuse to drink from the fountains of living water what makes all these things in this world today what makes these ladies wear little shorts what makes them wear them blouses that you can see their clothes through what is it he said his hungry children are thirsty blessed are ye when you hunger and thirst after righteousness jesus says you will not come to me he said listen the reason they do it is because that they have rejected the fountains of living water and have drunk from a hollywood broken cistern they receded through an old vulgar television and so forth like that in the very plan that they've done they went right straight back to eden where it began you don't have to wait until the next camp meeting the next special service the next youth camp it could happen right here today you can become addicted to god change your addictions change it the only way you change it is the holy ghost on the day of pentecost he poured out his blessings upon the people peter comes staggered out of the upper room drunk on the holy ghost he was addicted where before he was lying he wasn't he was even fishing naked but all of a sudden on the day of pentecost the power of god dropped down he could he come staggered under the drunk of the holy ghost oh bro i feel it right now i feel that power dropping down right now the anointing holy ghost it'll make you forget those things outside that door you won't want to leave this building without being this addicted to this holy ghost hallelujah let's all stand hey man let's pray father there's only one thing we want to be addicted to that's you lord we just pray if we have those addictions that hinders us from being fully surrendered to you lord may we just put that stuff aside father may you just come down with that same holy ghost that you fell the day of pentecost and may you would just anoint us may you fill us may our addiction be just on you father knowing that's the only only way we're going to get out of this world is you inside of our souls father lord we want to eat and we want to drink this word until we become nothing but jesus christ reflecting out of these bodies to this world outside father lord we just grant it or may you anoint the the further part of this service may you know what to sing it may you know brother jason fathers he brings forth the word father we're look we're looking and hearing what you're going to have for us in jesus name amen god bless you
